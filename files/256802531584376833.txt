https://twitter.com/Ka_Te_03Y/status/1121446609672269824 yeah I guess this needs more RevStar pics. This time with Junna and Nana
oh flysubs right
I forgot what name of that subber for Revue Starlight
I think Flygon-something subs iirc is a recommended subs for you to watch it
(lol I get that pun)
yup
oh I forgot about that
it just takes place on a stage and the girls there have to fight for the top star title
the action there is similar to how Symphogear does with singing while battling
yup.
but I am sufficient with XDU and Bandori GBP
I lowkey wished I have a phone that can suffice for more games like Re-Live
wait, you haven't watched Revue Starlight yet?

like, Gamagoori jumping from a high height and making his move is so awesome and manly
probably through pictures or some sort
needs more manliness from Gamagoori
Sanageyama is probably the third freak-est of all freaks
Maria still loves you
that's ok Tsubasa
oh right will do

Shirabe is slowly downloading Maria lol
look at how Maria plays with a stick controller <@!193408538909868033>
Maria vs Shirabe on a fighting game lol
does anyone have a pic where izanami from blazblue and shemha miku are in it together? I forgot to save the link
<@!468591607332208641> ah that is the one thanks
I mean it depends on you
yeah, dbfz is like that
so I just searched on S1, and Bushimo is one of the producers of S1
^
because it's a huge fighting game that can be accessible to beginners with its easy inputs
honestly, if anything about Dragon Ball that I like, it's just dbfz
other than that, DB fans are just annoying
only reformed Piccolo is what I like there
and the stupidity of Vegeta
who support Goku's actions
ah yes Dragon Ball fans
that show, is sick
fuck yeah
saint seiya
ah yes
I just had a bad experience with Jojo fans
yeah I can see that honestly
the real manliness
fist of the north star, oh yes
it's possible
that makes the delay worth it honestly
used a lot of resources and gathered the transformations from 1st to 4th seasons with Edgebikki pose
anyways setting that aside, holy cow. Bushimo did a great job on the 1st episode
that's honestly the reason why I stay away from the jojo community
like dude, there are no jojo references at all
when it's clearly not
worst part is people are gonna spam "Is that a motherfucking jojo reference!?"
I honestly never get why Jojo is everywhere
and the plot is not living to my tastes
like why tf is the women in jojo too manly looking
uhhh, you should think about that more carefully. I don't know if you will like the artwork and the story of jojo
oh mb
under night in birth exe latest
with the game
and the tutorial there gives you an in-depth help
oh hey, since you tried those, wanna try UNIST? it's a beginner friendly game though inputs can be a bit technical
Definitely would lead to Tsubasa or Genjuro dueling against him since they rebelled against him
He's just going to extremes and ignoring other people's opinions
Fudou is really asking to be killed
What the heck I thought he is a seperate villain
I knew Fudou is evil, but not to this extent
~~pretty much, like ddlc~~
"Well done Tsubasa Kazanari!"
Me: Oh here it is!
since I was looking forward to the reactions of the watcher there at  Kirika's transformation, and the Milaarc kill part
man, I am such a bad guy lol
I am watching Symphogear XV episode 2 reaction videos
what if Ver sees Noble Red instead? 👀
she has her original sin erased like Hibiki
I wonder what will the creators do with her in the story
speaking of Miku, remember AXZ's last part?
probably
should XV make Ignite module return, or just let them fight without the Ignite module?
yo uhm, <#337805317276565525> ?
Ver took advantage of that and he became a troll
at least Ver did something heroic, though idk if that would be really heroic
*snickers* up until Ver completely foiled that one
it's incomplete
they will probably do Kirika's transformation again
1st season I think
and she will probably do some whipping around with her weapon
ah yes that
exotic way
in a rather...uh
the sequence, will be Maria dancing with her extendable dagger
Tsubasa would honestly take few episodes before doing so
there was someone who predicted Chris' transformation after all lol
and I was a little bored so I kinda want to do it on a whim
I guess, I just wanted to take a guess
actually nvm
if I got it wrong, what bet should I take on?
I am bored that I want to bet on Maria transformation
oh that Zesshoushinai episode isn't it? Well Tsubasa wasn't affected by it so
oh right I completely forgot about that
TV trope chest insecurity comes into play
imagine if Tsubasa does meet her
alright we waiting for Maria transformation eyyy
yoooooooooooooooooo
saw the latest XV preview featuring Maria
about Fudou's strength, was it because the Noble Red were weak, or is it something else?
tbh, idk if Noble Red would go turn against Fudou immediately
oh right
or *should we* make it as a meme material?
boob missiles are probably a meme material
showcases how Maria breaks free from shackles
shiet that transformation
I love how she fired rockets from that location
Saint Germain is bae
huh
I am pretty sure one of the opening back then showcased her working out
was it not shown that Maria has abs?
...as appalled I am to say this, you have a point
like divine protection
nah, I am pretty sure Tsubasa can battle him well, unless he has something dirty on his sleeve
just a sakimori/warrior's resolve battle
I want Tsubasa to duel on Fudou 1v1 without any gear, but that will have to wait I guess
without the use of gear that is
nah, I want Tsubasa to duel her grandfather and settle the score
the cocksucker did it
rhythmic gymnastics
yesssssssssssssss
*what if she wanted to do karaoke with Maria instead of Hibiki?*
she became a seductress
LOL Milhi
yomigaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
LOL yes I remember Shaman King
didn't Tsubasa went against Fudou since AXZ?
the shaman king is way better btw
he was just being threatened
Genjuuro is not the type to give his gear users up
eyyy thanks
yo <@!400844698140409856> mind if I share that pic to my Symphogear peeps outside this discord?
I will see for it later hehe
what reaction would that Maria obsessed fan have?
I am gonna wait for outside998's reaction regarding Maria today hehehehe
*you know, cause SG is dead, and she basically "revived" her*
as in shaman king
shaman*
I wonder how shenshoujing would be tapped at a later time
most likely, Tsubasa would need one more episode just to recover
next episode would probably be *complete* Kirika transformation
wait I think that does count as Fudou killing Milaarc for that
if Fudou denied giving her the blood
ok nvm, but that is a what if
dying due to deficiency of blood
or how about this
*you know what Millaarc did after all*
Millaarc 90%
befriending, 50/50
ok here's the thing. What's the point of abducting Miku if there's nothing to be gained from her? Unless, they know what Miku got her original sin erased
how would he know Miku?
is this the reason why we won't have Idolm@ster Million Live anime yet? The producer of 765 productions was being held hostage
also I noticed this, but it looks like Ignite modules are no longer needed since the gear users gained new armor
since when did Miku's bringing of flowers scene became a meme? lol
wow
yeah do not
jojo is bad
listen here
*what happened to Persona reference? lol*
wait, are the gear users shamans?
Shaman King honestly
I mean considering the op
chris with her parents probably
idk about that one dude
Well we will see
a wild possibility that is
well I am considering it as a possibility
hm fair enough
one of them is shenshoujing
there is gonna be something significant happening with Miku aside from the abducting
*if that would happen*
after the concert
he questioned the bikers
Ogawa returned actually
He is Tsubasa's manager
Ogawa will probably have more action here
if there's taste for that series
variety for me
and LOL Tsubasa almost fainted there
~~I might want to share it to scare off people~~
and where's the source for that pic?
solo what is that
...
As appalled I am to say this, with the plot twists on going, the chances of her switching sides have been raised
didn't Tsubasa turned against Fudou back then?
wait, for what reason would Tsubasa side with Fudou?
Fudou probably slayed an eight headed man eating snake
Odin?
Chris is uh....
since she wields the name of a king
Maria is an empress
Hibiki knows no remorse. She wielded an infinity gauntlet, even targeting Miku
*if that's the case, he must be either Odin or Thor*
uhhhhh
in her S1 armor?
inb4 Fine was the real ally all along
I like his manliness
I'd be sad if that was the case
~~are you saying, Genjuuro is the secret final boss?~~
wow, this is my first time seeing this
anything with a blade would feel weird
scythes
swords
wait, if there is heart rockets and punches..
~~is she secretly Cagliostro?~~
like Cagliostro?
that drawing will haunt me in my dreams
I am not gonna sleep later on tonight LOL
or is she about to?
lol you should blame me as well for that
just to lead me with *different* links
I clicked a picture of Tsubasa
heck is this
what the
wait...
I am jumping in
https://poohadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Tsubasa_Kazanari
LOL yes that
what don't tell me you forgot that solo
uh what was that pooh term again?
because that sword has different types of swords
btw, is it really fitting for Tsubasa's sword to be aligned with Susanoo, or can it be aligned with Izanagi's as well?
I was just merely being silly here a little while ago lol
Well they are blades alright
*does that mean Kirika and Shirabe are doing incest?*
wait, if Shul Shagana and Igalima are sons of a god
what's Shul Shagana and Igalima again?
yes I know heh
Soul Eater huh, that's interesting
let's digress this discussion
then again, fans will just iterate it with their interpretation of it over and over again here
that's a much more better ring to it
oh yes Persona
just watch Shaman King so that you will know
I don't want to iterate it
she's a sham-- eh nevermind
the past few seasons were kinda like that
tbh, I really want Miku to be more than a supporter of Hibiki
being shot yes
oh right
no bullets?
like Ragyo?
that's where the bug placed on the Noble Red comes in yes?
just to hold people hostage
huh, it does make sense since Fudou was basically going to SONG's headquarters
reeeeeeeeeee
good night everyone
yeah I am gonna go sleep
*for research purposes*
btw I still need the sources of those images
Oh my gosh just, why!?
why the heck did artists draw them in the first place!?
those images will haunt me to no end
rip my sleep times
oh my gosh, you just made my "I am not gonna sleep later tonight" to "I will never be able to sleep again"
Noooooo
~~I kinda want to scare off people while crediting the artist~~
I am still wondering about that source
*he invaded the Philippines! How dare he!*
oh right
the definition of sakimori glory that is
yes, he wants the sakimori glory to himself
so that leads....to what precisely?
and yes he knows about SSJ as well
probably something that he needs for firepower
but as for why Ichaival was the reason, is a mystery
that he retired
yes, it was when Ichaival was lost
It's no surprise as to how he was able to know where Gen and the SONG staff are
pls no
like a certain fire user from an *academia* who is blonde and died in the story?
Dr. Ver lol
she kinda looks malnourished there
hot?
uh....
she's actually that...
wow
btw, when did Hibiki lift Miku?
but then he became a "hero" for killing Yamatano no Orochi
Susano'o initially was expelled out of hurting Amaterasu
formerly that is
I mean he's a sakimori after all
and Gen?
what if Miku is actually stronger than Hibiki?
wait...
they won't renounce their following of Fudou immediately
Noble Red will honestly still think about it
nobody should underestimate her
Miku did a javelin toss and marathon
Tekken style
he was a spy during his mission wasn't he?
oh Yatsuhiro
you saying there's a possibility that Gen was following Fudou?
*I mean not precisely to begin with but rather, during his times as a former division 2 leader*
*what if Fudou wasn't human to begin with?*
I wonder if Hibiki does that to every cats LOL
*guitar sounds continues to play*
*fxxk this sxit I'm out*
this is anime
oh wait, why am I wondering about this
I mean Germain, did punch along with Hibiki
*I wonder if Hibiki's punch has Germain's force as well. Or is it just her pure force?*
Ai des--- (someone stop me)
and Chris only started to work out once she entered Kyudo
oh right
Look at Hibiki and Chris
how the heck are the huge eaters in this show not gaining fat?
oh speaking of malnourished
but what if the fragments were not necessary to speak to Hibiki?
she just needs to showcase it
I know Tsubasa has reached the point where she is out of her shell already without Kanade's help
yeah same
Otherwise, she is just...
She really has to stand on her own feet without Kanade reminding her.
tbh, I kinda want Tsubasa to be able to sort things on her own though she is already doing that
ok what if there are three choices
I mean, she really has to be the last place. The arc is about Kazanari bloodline now
too embarrassed to kiss each other lovingly I guess
and samurai wielding poses
or just yeah kendo
I kinda want it like bleach ichigo's multiple slashing
I am shivering at the thought of Tsubasa's transformation

also please no fudou haunting to my dreams
well I am gonna go sleep for reals now
man that's sad
...
though I guess I am most likely rioting
me as well for TsubaMari
The last person I want to be killed is Tsubasa honestly
after discovering deicide that is
philosophical, you mean like the explanation at AXZ ep 11?
shiet, now this one is a hard one
how about divine guidance that shall allow Kanade to speak through Hibiki?
hm...
I mean, considering SG...oh wait right
though YTT did it more accurately
man gotta appreciate how CR added the subs for the songs
too small
"Oh, here we are gonna showcase round 2 of Hibiki's song!...or so at least that what's you thought. Sike mofo"
man, other anime studios, take notes
~~yes, make bikki jealous~~
really? that's great
I mean Chris owes her life to the both of them
and maybe even TsubaChris
honestly, I kinda find it sad that ChrisMiku is short
that as well
she is a strong girl after all
not that she minds
Chris will probably be on her own
I really want that kind of music back since it fits Tsubasa so much
Actually you know what? I really want her G song vibe back in XV
she does
huh
and yeah that electric shamisen is really OD
in her G song that is
uh is it really *Ken*, or is it *Tsurugi*?
her downfall started at GX
same honestly
the classic
ah yes
hm...who were you talking about?
as for Tsubasa, well...I just hope her new song will be much better than the other songs she has
XV has demonstrated that as well, so I am really glad she received that song
yes that as well
they remained top 1 in terms of over all likeability
Chris songs were consistent from the first season
Tsubasa's songs weren't so consistent from the very start
now that I have thought about it
and now all that is left is Tsubasa I guess
2 more waiting days of the OD song coming from Yukine Chris then
tfw when Yukine Chris' song is gonna be out on the 31st
but I understand why people don't mind them
personally I enjoyed the unison songs
something better, imo
and Tsubasa needs a redemption from her songs
this is the last season
wish XV would release an OD XV Tsubasa song
so much for me being a Tsubasa fan lol
my top 5 are Chris a-side songs
and there is no trio songs *yet* for now
but rather, everyone is singing at the start
the show didn't went to a trio only song
I remembered XV episode 1
oh right, those are the classics
I am really surprised by that
I mean, Tsubasa and Shirabe?
tbh, the last thing that fans expect is probably Kirika and Shirabe not doing unison with each other. but it's not a bad thing for them
hitsuai is the real od song for me out of the three
what are your opinions about unison songs?
speaking of that
fair point
for me it's either a hit or a miss
dubstep isn't for everyone actually
so rest assured
well there would be no ignite this season
personally I like Chris' ignite but yeah I know what you mean
wait, Hanasuki Yuki isn't a B-song?
just an improvement of it and I shall very much love it
and that was demonstrated here in this season
instead of brain dead brawns, there exists tactics that can outwit the opponent
they were real wise with how they want to control to where the Symphogear users would fall
but they showed they are more than that
the villains in XV are weak
but anyways
I never said about a fight having kills
what
at least Kirika and Hibiki against SG felt kindof a real fight
Tsubasa and Shirabe vs prelati is just a race crash lol
I mean, that's how you view it so, I guess you can have that
was to become naked
the only screentime he did
sad that it turned out to be Adam
Tiki is more fitting to be a puppet tbh
idk what the heck did Tiki did other than to become a monster
as for Tiki...she was basically an autoscorer who uh...
same with the other 3
Garie is part of Carol's personality
and holding SONG HQ hostage
though I have to credit him for doing a diversion tactic
as for Fudou, we will see
and that's where the senseless fool thing comes in sadly
ok, but what are your thoughts regarding Ryoko/Fine's plan?
and Chris...was an example of that
G was basically being a senseless fool and being controlled to that plan sadly
destroyed by a no name...I won't say
Fine was probably the last person to be tactical
wasted
he's just an a-hole tbh, but that's all he is
*Morgana voice* Let's not do that
YTT twitter said it, but I just don't know in which part of it has Bye Bye Lullaby tone
I am wondering, where's the part in Take This All Loaded that has Bye Bye Lullaby tone?
Tsubasa was given the gauntlet of those...things
what the heck, just when I thought Chris had it rough the most
just saw the screenshots. I did expect conflict within the Kazanari clan, but I am not expecting Tsubasa to go through a mental grueling experience
Just the thought of that makes me shiver
I just read that someone was speculating that the blood in front of Tsubasa was Maria's in the preview
Which is why she accompanies her a lot of times
Miku is the one who kept Hibiki away from depression
I just realized this just now. And yes, I deduced this one rather late
Oh wait...
He might not be human to begin with
Hundred of years old, yet he has that strength?
To be passed on to his next generations
All he cares about is his blood as a "sakimori"
Like imagine being the grandpa, who impregnated his son's wife
Made Yatsuhiro's wife gave birth to pass on his legacy, who is basically Tsubasa
It was inevitable that Tsubasa will encounter Fudou once again
*while Fudou and Akira are just...*
It's sad that the one who doesn't made his wife pregnant, is the actual good father
Is Yatsuhiro a somewhat decent dad?
Well I guess he probably has a bulletproof body or something like that
I like how Genjuro did not raise his hands even when he was pointed with a gun
Tsubasa song and transformation might wait for another episode or so. Though I think it's Tsubasa's turn now
Also this might be an episode where either a: Vanessa will be tortured or b:Vanessa will be executed
(I am trolling here actually lol)
Color me surprised
Shieeet you have a name like that?
Uh who you?
*sweats*...please
In a strange way
Wow clever
Because he's just doing the opposite of being a Sakimori
Exactly
Do you know what Sakimori means?
Ok, but let me ask you this
He wasn't actually human to begin with
better safe than sorry
but honestly I guess
it will air at 1:00 am JP timeone
wait, there's still 52 more minutes
who do you mean solo?
wait, you saying they bit the bite of those who feed them?
but yeah, the most logical one would be Hibiki
wild guess: It is Chris who protected Miku
also they brought back Zettou Ame no Habakiri music woah
that cliffhanger
what the hell!?
but is that all there is to it?
yes precisely
so take it with a grain of salt
I mean I am bad at story telling, I am just merely stating possibilities
what if that Deus Ex Machina would occur to Noble Red as well?
well in the case of what happened before, there's always Deus Ex Machina that happened to the Symphogear users
how about some application with deus ex machina?
we are just merely stating possibilities
woah chill
and it's clear on how Fudou stepped on the blood
including *her discovery* last season
As for Elfnein, they might threaten her to spill the beans
yes, there's no basis on what they will do with Miku *yet*
she did turn against Fudou after all
yeah it's weird
oh good point
*thanks to that, Tsubasa will answer to Japan government*
yes, all hail the vampire
love it
the iaido, and the samurai showcasing
heck yeah
*why didn't Tsubasa catch it instead of making havoc?*
and all of a sudden, it increased so much
it peaked at Gekko no Tsurugi
I can hardly believe Symphogear XV pulled out a song that is top tier
btw Cypher, let's talk about something else. How do you like the new song with Zettou Ame no Habakiri music returning to the song?
what, but didn't you mentioned you drank wine? shouldn't you be resting your mind at this point?
we will just see
likewise here, who probably did add fuel to fire
*I mean fans can be real impatient, so the only thing subbers(unless they are dedicated enough) has to do is to do last minute translations*
but yeah, Yatsuhiro wouldn't overstep
well, last minute translations I guess
btw, is it strange that Yatsuhiro would talk like that in front of Genjuro?
but still I want Chris and Miku moments back
At least in this episode, Miku remembers about Chris
If you are about best songs, it's really assorted, but my top 5 is chris songs
I got infected with the CR virus *gasp*
Oh wait why did I spell Hibiki like that LOL
Shirabe transformation just lack color for me
Tsubasa > Chris > Maria > Kirika > Hibikie and > Shirabe for me
Tsubasa always have the best transformation
Too OD
*btw, wouldn't it be funny for Zesshoushinai when it comes to Genjuro passing a paper to the government would be that paper is revealed to be a crappy drawing from Hibiki or Elfnein?*
unless, they can make improvisations with that one
I mean, it was probably a failure to begin with
strange that the chateau would make it a return
Ok I will stop
Get it, cuz *crunchy...roll* haha
I feel like I want to eat Crunchyroll because it's food
"you want to watch this anime at our website? Nah! We won't show it to you!"
"oh hey, I see you, and you live at the Philippines"
I regret not making a joke about Crunchy during the time I was hungry recently man
Because of how the anime there are not shown in my perspective
I can never understand how this website works
Freaking CR dude
like Tsubasa
and that's where Miku will never forget something she'll see in the next episode
*and she will be*
Ok guys let's move on with something else
Too innocent I have to say
Never mind
*and she does that in front of her fans?*
*What if her armor is her clothing?*
Ok...try to think it of this way
You're still too young to know what the armor purging mean
You'd better not know
Meaning if
It's a letter i
Then yes I know what you mean
Iykwim
*Tfw when Chris never has a bazooka, or a cannon*
Chris probably asked Elfnein for one
She just guns the hearts of her fans with love
Trick question
And Iaido showcase
I'd prefer to see her as Ann Takamaki from Persona 5 instead ty
likewise here lol
also the fact that you watched Detective Conan makes me like you eyyy
because same VA
dyk, Kanade Amou is Conan Edogawa?
oh speaking of Detective Conan
*oh also, I am saying this not just because it's for translation purposes, but I will stop here because I might go personal with you*
and you will understand them 😉
just take it easy man <@!176508209576673280>
because Crunchyroll ain't got no relent when it comes to me visiting it
I watch the release of subs from gogoanime to watch the show immediately before I got spoiled
Milaarc: Omae wa mou shindeiru
No name smugace: Nani!?
it's just that, they dismissed it
tbh, that discovery was only known ever since Hibiki punched a huge worm
beside him, was the rocket driver since GX
where he mentioned that he heard a song
there was one covered face in AXZ episode 11
where the information of deicide was leaked
oh speaking of GX, do you remember those guys who was shown in AXZ?
wow...that's...
did Chris forgot to turn her missiles off?
Nastajja, or whatever her name is
I forgot her name because her name is too freaking lol
if you are talking about a "decent" family, it would probably be Maria's "Mom"
also Milaarc, that hypnosis
or, is it just part of his plan to do that? idk
yet, Yatsuhiro doesn't want to turn his back on Fudou
you know those samurais that leap at air, and slash their enemies like yoooooooo
I mean, she is a trained samurai who can do high jumps
and a little bit of Gekko no Tsurugi iirc
Ah Zettou Ame no Habakiri vibes
yes. "that"
you have that picture about Chris and Maria comparison right Kerrik?
she's setting up a bad example to Kirika and Shirabe...oh wait
why is Maria always smoking?
guess it's time for me to burn my dread
and welp, one month of waiting for Tsubasa's song
teaches you how to be logical
yeah detective conan is a great first anime
good idea hehe
oh right
oh huh well that's understandable
how was it? 👀
btw outsided998, I haven't heard your thoughts about Maria's transformation
I'll leave it to you guys to know who he is I suppose
that works as well
should we leave it that he is a no name?
I like how Symphogear doesn't give him a name ~~yet~~
oh true
that's the face of someone who has fear
I should've noticed that
wait that guy is sweating?
and then now he's red gush
he turned into yuno gasai
I am down for that
oh yes
milaarc is an mk character?
wait does that mean
that's some mortal kombat thing I have to say
for the purpose of surprise
yeah, they should've went to show that he was obliterated by Milaarc, unless there is someone else who just appeared out of the blue
if Miku were to be killed
slashed herself, as a "fakeout" that's one possibility
majority here says it's coming from that smugface
that pic kinda looks like Laidback Camp anime for some reason lol
~~did she learn to hate pancakes from Ogawa?~~
they did repeat that animation, but in a different setting
I just noticed that wow
better off him dying like a dog
now that's just too anti-climatic
she survived a zesshou, not just once, but twice in S1
Yatsuhiro is possible to be killed
I mean, who was the one who repaired Maria's Airgetlam?
of course, to troll us
then what was the point of the last scene from AXZ?
very good to hear
still eyy, you did sang that well
because the VA of Kirika is known to have variated voices
likewise here
I am sorry
oh shiet, that was you?
24 seconds in, and I just heard...uh...idk what is this
what is this?
LOL freaking Bleach reference xDDDD
oh nvm
Nastajja maybe
maybe Tsubasa's persona will be the girl whom Milaarc killed lol
oh right
Tsubasa has grown by herself already
not that it is a bad idea but
I swear...if Serena became the persona/spirit of Maria like how Hibiki does, then I am gonna be so sad cuz Tsubasa will have Kanade duet with her
how does that work?
*apple amalgam ver* uhhhh...
3 days...oh
wait what happened to AT-X?
7/13 25:00 TOKYO MX/BS11 
⚡️7/13 25:50 TVA
⚡️7/14 26:05 MBS ※放送日時変更
⚡️7/16 21:30 AT-X
different channels https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1149514379802468352?s=20
let me see where's the trailer video of it brb
it's the former actually
meaning it's 1:30 at sunday
iykwim
and SG a piano
give Maria a bass instrument
you know what would be a good idea for Symphogear?
sometimes leading myself to recklessness
I am too courageous
and my ears burned
I clicked it
do not click it
whatever you do
my ear burns
5 seconds in
reeeeeee
Wfc, don't jinx it
To having Hibiki summoning a Persona
I love how Symphogear went from gear fights
*Noble red probably*
*Are you saying...that I should've read them before watching the episodes?*
There are keywords for each episode?
Wait
Also Symphogear XV episode 6, can I have an explanation of your preview pics?
So there's no need for her to return
Plus Tsubasa has already grown without the need of Kanade's guidance
And at that point, she is at the age of retirement
Kanade's VA is very old
*that's something the subber has all the answers to*
And that sword is the same sword as a gift to Amaterasu as an apology from Susanoo
Ah that one right ty
I forgot the name
Totsuka uhhh...
It's just a sword used by Susanoo to kill Yamatano no Orochi(or eight headed serpent) Though that sword is the same as Izanagi's
What
As in *gun*
Next mistranslation would be Gun-Gnir
Oh right
For commie lol
And Ichaival is Ichiibal
Yup
I view it as a meme lol
I love how my entry point for Symphogear is the translation of ame no habakiri as heavenrend
Ya ya ya o yaaaaaaa!
Ya ya ya *Ame no Heavenrend*
Heavenrend is life
*do that at home yo*
*Now Hibiki can no longer do...uh...play with Miku*
I love that HibiMiku with SG LOL
but enough memes, looking forward to the Symphogear XV episode tomorrow
I searched ame no heavenrend in this server, and I am surprised that I am not the first one to think of that wow
there will probably be an explanation soon enough
that may be the case, but that still doesn't hold water.
because there was no word about it *yet*
was that confirmed though?
I am really appalled by it when it comes to normal circumstances, but since it was done by the assistance of Milaarc, there's a high possibility of it
deym, <@87512939107450880> , you were somewhat on point that Tsubasa would betray SONG
next thing that Cypher might call out.*Fudou will give a special power to Tsubasa*
and just when I thought she just grew up without the need of her guidance anymore
btw, I know this was mentioned, but I got a little annoyed once Tsubasa mentioned Kanade. I thought she wouldn't be needing answers from Kanade
and on that vulnerable state of rage, Tsubasa received that seal
now I understand why she would target her
oh wait, I remembered how Milaarc's said that her target is Tsubasa.
Yeah Tsubasa is definitely not on the right track
Ah just curious
Btw outside998, what was your reaction to Tsubasa deflecting Maria's hand away? 👀
Something like that yes
Werewolf huh let's see
I have been wondering...is there anything outside of the show that is related to Lulu Amel?
https://twitter.com/max_tevo/status/1160574932071407616?s=20
*what if Symphogear will cross fates in BBTAG?*
I guess you are right ninryu
Hence how I know Tsubasa has grown so much
To be fair, my thought of Tsubasa was how she progressed in each season since I am a Tsubasa fan and understood her for the most part
My apologies if what I have worded did offend
I guess I may be overreacting when it comes to the latest episode. I might have placed Tsubasa on a pedestal
It's only in the op so far
Where Tsubasa nearly died
It's season 1 is it?
Uhhhhhh
Zombified Kanade?
*please no Kanade. I mean the idea is not bad, but personally I know Tsubasa can stand on her own without Kanade's help. Or so at least that's what I thought up until I watched the latest episode*
I would
Who's gonna bet that Maria will slap Tsubasa hard to snap out of it?
oh huh, then that means Milaarc can choose whether to disintegrate the body or not according to her will
I just noticed, why does that smugface got burned to nothingness after getting killed by Milaarc while the girl who was killed in episode 2 has her corpse still there?
Though that's just a *possibility*
Putting the apple song and the remark of Vanessa together on the same page can tell you that Vanessa knows something about the FIS or Maria
Idk, the fact that she *may* have known that Maria has a sister lingers
*where exactly is the joke?*
Vanessa: Oh hey yo, dyk Maria that I know that you have a sister and there was something found on a war from a faraway country related to Airgetlam? Jk it was just a joke
*uh should I continue this one? I will warn you that the next one will have memes*
Who wants to make his school rise up against people who are against his school
Fudou is actually the dean of the school of Japan
Oh wait, no
Euphonium?
how to defy laws of science for human body - have an almost uncontrollable demon within
Now I feel happy that I shared my story hahahaha
I gave him the good ol meme story
*remember that you are literally asking for it*
Ok if you are interested in my story, just ping me
LOL
*speculating* uh wasn't what you said about Chris a *declaration*?
Honestly, I keep seeing that you jump to conclusions, and that is not a healthy one
Too early to say
But eh, I am still happy my girl Yumi first came there. I am maining her day 1
People be complaining on how Houmaru, or Asuka did not come into bbtag as a first character representative
Yes exactly
Lol, I am feeling Yumi today. Still hyped after that bbtag announcement
Just a *disaster* mom but still does her job well
But seriously yeah Maria is still a mom
*yeah idk about that one*
*Tfw when Chris can do a better job at being a mom*
True
*Maria doesn't hate it*
Exactly
Say <@193408538909868033> do you think she should muster her courage and be able to reach out to Tsubasa? Because her training scene makes me think she has low willpower to do so
Right now she has the capability to take care and speak out to Tsubasa I think. Her willpower to do so is just weak
I wish Maria can eventually be strong and be able to face Tsubasa like how she wanted to reach out to her
Anyways I digress here
Only did Shirabe made me remember LL a bit
After bandori and symphogear came to my life, I barely know the existence of LL
I can only think of Eli Ayase when Shirabe sings, other than that Shirabe is Shirabe
Yeah, she's in the 30's age
Shirabe's voice makes me think that she is a grown woman like Eli wow
Reminder to myself that I should've done before: Watch Symphogear before Love Live
Then again, I guess I should've expected it since SG
Who the heck would have thought the cast from GX would return
This episode is real crazy
Now that Carol and the autoscorers have returned, chances of the past characters returning will be there
I swear that ending has made me think that Fine will most likely come back
fair point
*what's the difference?*
it's honestly my thought that Elfnein's way of alchemy can pretty much invent almost everything
If anything, alchemy can honestly make a body
do alchemists create *almost everything*?
*I am your other self whom you keep denying. Isn't that right, me?*
*imagine if GX pulled a Persona 4*
*like you know, that app*
pokemon shipping list? do you mean the pokemon combination names?
wait, if Elfnein is a manfestation of Carol, then how the heck did Carol receive that appearance? since she was Elfnein body in the past
Elfnein is a mere manifestation of Carol
*shujin!*
I was so close to making it Caroline
shieeeet
make the ship of carol x elfnein uhhh...
eyy that's some wacky thing, but not that I hate it
LOL Crunchy messed up the thumbnail
*btw, if Carol did return, imagine if Dr. Ver would rise up from the rubbles that are above him and scream "Boku wa eiyuu da!"*
she has an unfinished job
*I think at this point, Carol would be staying up until she did her job*
*imagine Miku singing would be computerized like a certain synthesizer*
"what is symphogear? a miserable pile of machinery. but enough talk, have an alchemy" - elfnein probably
*with no revertion. Which definitely would not happen*
*inb4 Carol would be there from now on*
LOL that's one cursed meme
*you probably know what will happen*
*welp if Maria ever runs into Garie again*
so we talking about subs eh? *should I do the sword gear joke/topic again?*
all of my yes
yesssssssss
since I want Maria, to have a strong will power to reach out to Tsubasa
it's Maria's turn
please, I've seen enough Kanade when it comes to Tsubasa
and eventually maybe slap her on the face to snap out of it
yeah Maria can do that
she is now almost clingy to Kanade
what the heck
but this episode...
tbf, I understand the point of having Tsubasa ask Kanade questions for guidance
why is it that Tsubasa is the only one who went through that path?
Chris is the type of character to have a very strong character arc and improvement
ugh...Tsubasa wen't throught a character arc, and then improved her character, then XV made her go to ground zero
yes, pretty much
also has anyone thought that in this episode, Tsubasa is secretly scheming?
she won't do things without data
nah, elfnein is too meticulous
he's a villain btw
He was the one who solved the problem of the linker
I am just thinking about that for the lolz
so I hope XV won't do that
ok seriously that is a bad move
LOL precisely Voyeur
deleted that degeneracy coming from mine
that was a bad wording of mine mb
ok screw that
the reason why she is still there, is because during in G, Tsubasa wants Maria
let's be honest when it comes to Maria.
*cuz using that phrase reminds her of Ver*
oh wait, imagine if Maria would say "Ai desu yo" in an awkward manner to Tsubasa LOL
now it's time for Maria to teach Tsubasa what *ai* is
*I wish that would happen*
Well gonna sleep early, good night everyone
Now I can sleep ty
Oh hey that's great as well
Brb gonna find some pics
I need TsubaMari to cleanse my soul so that I can sleep peacefully
I swear, if ever I get to see those images again, I will have insomnia for eternity
Now I am not gonna be able to go to sleep
<@279341087494242304> you crazy
I am just messing around a bit here lol
I know
*replace every desu with dess*
"moshi moshi. dare *dess* ka?"
But boy they were wrong
People doubted me that SSJ is impossible to return
Yeah I know, still it has SSJ elements in it
That's just a hybrid of it
Though
Now they brought SSJ back
Hah! <@124136423153467392> you said it's an impossibility.
Maybe Shemha is the anti god killer
Fudou will not waste that power
Shemha will last for 2 or more I think
What if, *Miku actually saved herself*?
Miku is top, she knows what she is doing
Tsubasa regress
Agreed
Yes please don't bring her back
Goooooosh, the last thing I want to hear is Kanade back
*is Miku actually naked*?
Btw, I love that removing of the robe part
You are gonna make me have insomnia
Chossei pls don't make me remember of those 2 cursed pics
Silly right?
*you know the green colors*
*Don't get me the wrong way but uh...those colors resonate to me as a prostitute color*
I mean, past adulthood
Oh wait, she woule be a granny if that's the case
Or maybe past adulthood
Sometimes, that outfit makes me think that Miku is at the age of 30s
Symphogear referenced Old and New Testament from the Bible
The Christian Bible
Bible more precisely
*no no better plot twist, Miku is the protag from the very beginning*
*and Tsubasa is Susanoo who bullied her*
*wait what if, Miku is actually Amaterasu*
It's just a weird thing from me
Yeah let's scrap that
Idk why I would think that way, but sometimes it reminds me of a ragged dress that prostitutes usually wear
Look at where its guns are
Btw this is Paildramon
Or at least almost no one
You talk like HibiMiku is dead but no one talks about ChrisMiku
You know that Digimon
What if, her guns will be like Paildramon?
Since Tsubasa is still working with SONG
It's my guess about it
She wasn't fully controlled, she was in fact controlled when needed to
The classic
Ah Saint Seiya
*LOL btw, that's Tsubasa imagining she has imaginary boobs*
I need to focus on Symphogear
I played too much of that game that I thought the old testament was there
It's only the new Testament
Oh shiet I completely forgot
It needs to be outside of firing
So that doesn't count
Well she did fire
Oh that
Bass vs Chris in G? What do you mean?
Yes that's the only time she did a close combat attack
You know like physical contact
Has anyone remembered how many times did Chris attacked close to her opponents with her weapons?
She has more firepower
Oh right
*Imagine if Chris was trained from a military, would she wield grenades along with her guns?*
Yet she wields a heavy blade
Tsubasa doesn't wield a longsword
Lol, Chris hasn't wielded a bazooka btw
Gosh Miku aged so much
Yeah I guess her singing will put me in an eternal sleep
*Is it bad that I actually want this Shemha Miku to sing a lullaby before I go to sleep?*
Hey <@87512939107450880> ya boy is waiting for you here
Shieeeeeet
My thought is cowboy but uhhhh
I don't get the Yeehawkine part
Btw, why does it that Tsubasa there looks like she is in a wedding dress?
*you are so dead Yukine*
LOL
She's firing lasers once she kicks
LOL, imagine if Miku's weapons or fighting style are her legs
Need to stop this one, gn
Ok I am gonna go to sleep cuz my thirst is increasing
*or commercials similar to that*
Also wow Shemha Miku is a different person alright cuz shemha. *She looks like she is doing a bathrobe commercial*
I keep falling for that
That undress
Oh yes
Du ra bla datto!?
Shem-ha is elegance
Shem-ha is beauty
I feel like I missed that part
what episode is that again in S1?
that gif
wait
Guess I will look forward to that episode then
I guess I will wait for it after her betrayal episode
I am still waiting for an episode where Tsubasa will have her redemption arc
and now she desired to kill anyone who took a life
before, she shoved everyone away from her
that aggressiveness is too much
yeah
and that was exactly what Fudou wanted
Well, she would be a monster if she took a life
the slap that shall remove the seal. It was that simple wow
yeah slap out of it
Tsubasa did save Maria before
I am glad that they chose Maria to snap Tsubasa out of it
a final boss for Tsubasa to deal with
oh wait, that was during amalgalm
what the heck
also they brought back Tsubasa's musical note hair just by de transforming
lol, that's twice the crime she has escaped though that's against her own will
oh right
guess that's farewell to her innocence
I can't believe Miku actually killed people
LOL, that's the third time
*like a bad ending but a rather satisfactory one*
*btw, am I the only one who would love it when Fudou gets killed/arrested but Miku wins at the end?*
nah you can see that on the gif
probably Vanessa might come back as a half body that is still kicking
is she Aizen, or Ichigo?
LOL Miku just did the Bleach hand
Millaarc was incapacitated
no more of that
oh right
wow
Hibiki is actually manly
I like it if it is a Persona reference though
no more jojo references
pls gosh
I am not sure if Hibiki's arrest will be lifted
I would be smiling if Tsubasa's persona would be Yatsuhiro
also I love how unarmed Maria walked up to an armed Tsubasa so that she can slap her
btw, is nobody talking about how he supplexed Gen?
so that Tsubasa would become a monster he desired
Fudou also wants Tsubasa broken down even if he dies from it
she has grown out of Kanade
just no more Kanades
yeah same
ah I am glad that Maria was the one who slapped her out of it
yeah, and she received that slap from Maria
<@87512939107450880> what do you think of the betrayal of Tsubasa?
I think that may lead to where SSJ comes from
at least possible people that has relation to him shall suffice
does anyone know who else has relation to Ver other than the FIS kids and Fine?
you mean my question? whenever
yeah who
did Miku have recollections of SSJ or nah?
at the end of XV
i'd love it if Miku can escape two crimes
probably Vanessa will struggle
very much
yes
oh
idk his age
News flash: 70 years old geezer supplex a martial artist from 40 feet above
then how would it be possible for the mummy to be Shem-ha
wait, did Noble Red retrieve that mummy?
to begin with what is Shem-ha?
*you probably know who that is Naoto*
whenever I hear Murakumo, I always remind myself of a certain yandere robot
probably Adam
just rewatched and that was during her combat with the alca-noise
*run!*
oh my gosh, thirsty Kaliks is here
hint: *look below*
https://twitter.com/heavenrend/status/1167858879109066752?s=20
sliced
oh right
noble red
maybe they were just scratched
ok I rewatched that one and it doesn't seem like they were obliterated
And she needs to rest so
Besides, Hibiki only gained a Persona just because SG gave her help
Just the Amalgalm gears
Nah no more Personas okay?
deym, how metallic are Maria's heels
I guess she did kick her
dropkick!
LOL...imagine that
it was rather...metallic
no, I don't think she kicked Tsubasa
ok maybe not footdiving, what's the term again?
and Maria dueled her til she slapped her
except she just did wave slashes
now Tsubasa just did the same
eyy remember when Maria posed after footdiving Tsubasa in the pool?
no name politician
that politician is a no name btw
heh
cuz symphogear isn't k-on
lel, if possible they might extend it like k-on. then again, it's not likely
eyyy thanks Kaliks for sharing this one
holy cow, the beginning of this song is so sick I got shivers down to my spine
glad that I found it hehehe
welp Symphogear wiki doesn't have the audio of Tsubasa's song yet so I resorted to finding it here
it was the Buddhism chants isn't it?
let me guess
or does YTT have those translations already?
been waiting for Symphogear wiki to translate it
havent seen the translation of the lyrics
are there no shields for Tsubasa to go with her sword? 😔
what did Adam say again last time?
"hey, you see this one? yeah I have a wine in plastic on my chest. and you thought it was blood. LOOOOOOL"
lololol, if Yatsuhiro actually siked in front of Fudou and Tsubasa, they will be pissed
lel Symphogear
but rather...a godzilla resembling monster
oh wait, the preview is not showing the scorpion
idk
or is Miku the beast?
they haven't released the beast
what color is the scorpion from the opening?
wait uhhh
I was just kidding
things like these wouldn't happen
if it weren't for humanity's curiosity
Maybe Ver was right
btw, has this season even showed or explained who the custodians are?
yet it was excavated
it just didn't work out in the end
idk, I think Fine may do something that shall lead people to salvation or peace
he isn't human to begin with
even goes measures to die just to control Tsubasa
he is a great villain alright
*the nightmare of those pictures reeee*
no, I am just glad you didn't mentioned those cursed ones
you are close to making me not sleep
oh my gosh close one cypher
loljk
*cuz I am a memer and sadist*
*if there is Symphogear VN, I want side with Ver option*
right
formerly
oh wait
where's black ranger?
wait
but then a shower of a meteor or some sort just shows up
LOL, Hibiki will be crying
and the last episode after fighting a giant, baby medabot
like Metabee from 1st season of medabots
*what if she "died" after the gears stopped her, but then she returns in an orb?*
lol good question
*why would anyone be baited by previews?*
the "failed to do errands" guy
oh wait was it three? I forgot that guy was obliterated
2 counts...
*I am not jinxing it btw*
just dont jinx it
*ahahaha looks away*
but nope, she just returned
like they thought they killed Miku
btw, what if Miku disappears and the cast assumed Miku just died, and then she returns in an orb, unconcious?
*remember kids, don't allow yourselves to eat the food on the hook, or you are just fishes for being baited*
lel, those preview are just baits
flat body
lel, Fudou just buffed himself from his original...uh...
that's my point
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and just summoned that thing on the background
lel, what if he actually has mystic powers? he did a spell with his fingers
he probably got exposure to some deity power or something
good idea, S1 flashback
that would be epic
and it reveals that Miku is alive
though no new cast
That will just be zesshoushinai
deities always use ware when referring to themselves
a true deity
I love how she says ware
reeee
man those eyes
since when did Vanessa became a creep?
I actually want Shem-ha Miku to sing me a lullaby
I love Shem-ha Miku
Hibiki is actually a masochist
look at Noble Red, she just erased their humanity
like humanity
wait...what if the Shem-ha works the same way as SSJ...but erases something else?
*what if Hibiki doesn't need to hit Miku? but rather Miku hitting herself?*
heh, I plan to play Okami fully soon enough
why does it looks like the face of Amaterasu?
that face
wait
rice and rice
oh the deep voice, soothes my soul
I actually want deep voice Shem-ha Miku back in shinais
did the creators, or did Shirabe and Kirika learn how to leet speak
jeez look at that leet speak
yes, that dress is so outstanding
the absolute face of beauty
~~part of me thinks that I don't want her to return to her original form~~
shem-ha Miku, so good
Close enough
When is Hibiki's birthday?
Wait
19 days and 3 hours left before XV ends...reeee
Ah how I wish time will stop for the reason that I want to look at Shem-ha Miku forever
Eyyyy
Iykwim
Psst <@139432096023183360> *soft voice* hakanai
Or did Kerrik just translate that one or...?
I love the heavenrend edit of the comics lol
I miss Kerrik’s meme translation of the comics
*Sad that the progressions of the episodes won't have Shem-ha Miku forever*
*Shem-ha Miku is better though*
seems like it
so partly it is his fault that caused this
he used a double edged sword
more specifically the curse of balal
Enki was the reason for starting the events of Symphogear
so let me get this straight
let me review the battle of Shem-ha again
hm...
with her deity powers
idk...I think it's possible Fine could've gone to the moon herself
really strange on why she would choose the moon over the ruins...but I guess she probably wants none of it left
but rather...the system Enki has started
what if Fine's goal wasn't to destroy the moon
wait...something has surfaced my mind
that body size wow
why does she look like a lollipop there
beautiful
lel, Tsubasa lost that top position ever since episode 2
other than that, it is just a marriage of power
if this is what I think it is, then wow. I loved that one
I love how she can be portrayed as a toothpaste commercialist
LOL
and it seems, it was only used for Maria's cannon and nothing else
also I searched about what does the dragon have in relation with airgetlam
she even guided Tsubasa like how Kanade did
I love how Maria increased her willpower
Take that out of context and it shall be nsfw
and yeah I love Miku voice of Shem-ha
no wonder Fine did not went to the moon herself
oh so it was hidden
Symphogear will have a 1 hour episode?
Wait what
not some no name white shem-ha
we need more shem-ha Miku
*sees Orange Heart* eyyy
It's the FIS
If there's one thing I can think of
But what relation does it have I wonder
To begin with Maria did recognize the sound
Shenshoujing is the medium used to moderate Shem-ha's control
Also how was Shem-ha manifested in Miku again? There was mention of an original plan from what I have read but it was the other way around
Story is solid overall in XV, but something tells me it will be a bit rushed
Ok in all honesty I got a feeling XV would have the ending rushed with some aspects being left for the viewers' theorization
*Why did he go for the 1 blade only when he can do the works with his left arm with a shield*
*Btw, Enki would've won the fight had he brought a shield to be held by his left arm*
With possinly greed taking over that villain
Good idea
Ah yes
Remnants of despair clones would be roaming around the world
That would be funny
Lol like Junko Enoshima
Oh fair point
Lol sometimes I did wonder if the creator did think of something else for motivation
Ah right
To begin with what was the motivation that made you say it was generic?
But N intervened
He almost killed the 2nd protagonist
And the DNA splicers
The only time Ghetsis has the upperhand, is when he has Kyurem
Ah yes that as well
Yeah N would've beated him
Oh right
If that villain would be in an action anime, that would be nice
But at the end...he was betrayed by his "father"
N wanted to liberate Pokemon
You know I was thinking of a villain with a goal of setting free of something...like N for instance
guess that's probably the last we will see from them
with them disappearing after that
hm...they used their last ounce of strength to create a daedalus end path to prevent them from being hit from the explosion
anyways did Noble Red just transmute like what Saint Germain and the other two did?
*mainly cuz of the similarities of both of them*
*btw, has anyone thought that Kirika can get along with Ruby Rose?*
it's a 6v1 lol
now it's all the gear users ganging up on Shem-ha with Shenshoujing who controls Miku
before it was just Hibiki who managed to erase Shenshoujing from Miku, even though Tsubasa and Chris assisted her
guess I am near being old and crusty by that time
wow
I can't believe that saving the world in Symphogear is basically using memes
that was supposed to have asterisks btw
oh LOL
"F**king slaves, get your a** back here Shem-ha!"
"Why are you running Shem-ha"
"This is how we do action in Uganda Shem-ha"
"Spit on the non believers"
"LMAO, Shem-ha do u kno de wae?"
Enki: Shem-ha lives and dies by the meme
lol why am I bringing back that meme from the grave
Hibidad: I am not even using 1% of my power
and Shem-ha will be no more
lel add the memes
farfetched idea I know
inb4 Hibiki's dad works for a computer related company
that's because she has a flawless body
or at least most of them
LOL all the Maria fans are thirsty fans
"Ah yes, step on me Maria. Yes please the deeper the better, ahhhh <3"
"I actually wanted to be sat down by Maria's axx"
"Maria4life is not online for weeks. Rip him"
rip
and then some of the people who is in that server died
and chatting in the concert channel
voice chats
lol
What a tragedy that happened to the fan
LOL
there were even Buddhists who watch the concert
when there's danger on going
to the toilet btw
leaving the two girls to go to the toilet
btw, idk what the heck Ogawa is doing
at least the first concert of Tsubasa and Maria didn't have casualties
*oh guess they are all screwed then*
and watching the concert
and that is having a television
Lel, there's a ticket that you can show off and get it for free
anime ja nai
not that it is a bad thing
lel, we are basically filling this channel with Symphogear memes and dirty talk
is Kanade a trap?
futabiki
yes, but I prefer not to
Lel, imagine if saving the world was actually sharing the image of Maria's axx
if it doesn't, well that's understandable
if it does, ah good service to the fans
The Elfnein and Carol kiss moment from GX episode 13 probably doesn't count
idk if the creators would do a kiss scene in an action focused anime called Symphogear
Would it be the best ending if SSJ got destroyed?
Wait speaking of Shem-ha...I wonder what will happen to SSJ?
3 more days...it is inevitable...but guess we will be seeing the last of Shem-ha Miku soon...
oh right
she's probably part of the SONG
of the Symphogear
although...Miku probably got admitted or acknowledged by SONG as a user
but I think it's probably the last time we will be seeing SONG working now
That SSJ returning to Miku took me off guard
wait wait wait that ending...did the creators left us to imagine what will be the ending?
and yes I think Chris x Tsubasa is a good ship for me'
LOL, the writers should have created a love triangle for Miku with Chris being in it
why is Chris so forever alone
Chris parents only at the opening
btw...what do you guys think of Ver returning as a spirit or some sort?
wait...Fine was the cause? I thought it was Enki
btw...what do you guys think of Fine from the beginning up until today? Is she a hero or no?
oh right
what
gogoanime.co
oh yeah <@87512939107450880> what do you think of Kanade's return in spirit? Idk how to react with that one
oh wait really?
Symphogear did it first
but now I learned
at first I thought Revue Starlight was the first to introduce singing while fighting
it's always that scene
LOL that mountain punching?
but now I am into it
initially I got interested
I started Symphogear since almost last year...ever since a Revue Starlight fan introduced me to this series with the meme "Watch Symphogear"
heh, it was a blast watching Symphogear
uh what does it say?
...ok nevermind I guess I am sad too as well
come on why did you bring this up
man...I am not ready for the feels
no reason otherwise
heh I like that. Doing it just because you want to do it
oh you started after commie? interesting...
btw, at what year did Yametetomete started? It seems like they started at AXZ zessoushinai
wow even the wiki has been long deserted
dead before I could even return to it
yup...
brings back memories
btw Sorano is that uh...Sadone from BGHS?
tfw when waiting for an anime but that means getting old soon enough
the manga yes
Yagate Kimi Ni Naru season 2 please
does LWA have a manga, or did it start as a movie only?
I'd like to imagine future Miku appearing like this
when the creator calls it
oh wow
LOL yes Bleach reference
or Symphogear has their own fighting game
LOL, if there's something that would be returning for Symphogear...it's either Symphogear crosses fates with BBTAG
*Ver is the hero we don't deserve*
Boku wa eiyuu da
the metanoia opening
the opening
also why is the scorpion from the opening not shown there?
possibly
strong in attack and weak in defense is that what you are saying?
for the latter...why wouldn't Shem-ha last song by that logic?
also why are battles against villains this season so quick?
Grenadier yes
idk what anime that is
those bullets
about that girl who uh
wait...didn't Chris reference that one anime
since they seem to be two sides of the same coin "even so"
and sore de mo
I am really thinking on the difference between datto shite mo
yes I know
lol if all the gear users were men it's probably not datto shite mo it would be sore de mo
Guess there are people who still haven't fully watched all the episodes and I told something that comes afterwards
I spoke too soon
Wait what the heck
His reaction to the ending was on point
Watching Eternal Oblivion's reactions in this season gives me life
Something like...singing perhaps.
Probably taking music related courses
Oh the shinai right
Tfw when Chris being accepted for college was shown, but no graduation scene shown
Lol Shirabe and Kirika thought Chris back then as a major flunkie
Her accuracy of aiming and calculations with her weapons shows how skilled she is at math
Oh wait, maybe she can be a math teacher as well
As a thanks for the XV memories
Heh I suppose I shall be here one last time before this channel closes
yo <@!102691114762371072> mind if this channel will be up a little bit longer? I have something on the works for this one heh
you guys forgetting Yusuke's katana?
