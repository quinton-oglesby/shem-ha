https://twitter.com/nyanmaru1121/status/1362037507790016523/photo/1
good to know i'm not the only one thinking that
realy liked all previous wixoss but the new one i just coudn't even watch 3 episodes, worth picking it back?

<@!173112001684439040>
the glasses lowers the center of where you tend to look at, without it my center of attention is in the middle of the forehead
without the glases i feel that bellow the eyes and over the mouth is too empty, so i'm more on the with glasses side

masterpiece

oh yeah, didn't see so 170 ich
the forhead it at 170
175 if we remove the hat
at least
but probably 170+
and we dont have carol 'transformed adult' form height iirc
chris is 153 cm
anyway, here is a cute biki
and i prefered the dual scarf instead of the mono
and for XV biki, the design is good, but she looks like a shiny pokemon with all the gold
I personaly dont realy like the S1 compared to other gungnir designs cauz all  gears designs in S1 have too mutch black and particularly gungnir have the design visual center in in the crotch area.
for tsubasa design, i'm liking more the G and XV designs, but cant realy explain why except her GX gear design is a bit too revealing
GX & AXZ gungnir is the best change my view, it got cleaned up from before and doesn't look like a shiny pokemon like in XV
ep 8, it was the right leg
it's the chris plot device aunt and the anoying kid playing 1 leged football from the start of axz yeah
some og artwork

cute biki

cute <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
the comf
welp, found it, was on it searching for like 15 mins
heyy, i'm looking to find back a fanart of burning x-drive hibiki that face thorward us with a dark background and everything is lit up by her gear flames, anyone has it? I think I lost it in my sea of SG fanarts

as a fellow tsubasa fan, gouf never disappoint <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
my parents bought their first house and my sister was born at that age <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
look at me, i'm 23 and i'm still single, watching anime, memes and playing genshin
2016 was 6 years ago <:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149> i'm old
was browsing my folder and found this
wait long enough || and the artist is deleted || (sorry)
well then, nevermind <:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
cant we change the bot to use saucenao? it looks like ascii2d have a lot of miss that saucenao doesn't have
3_skip https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/86359876
gouf the goat as usual
it's maria
üçø meanwhile me as an european üçø
but the current situation in the us is crazy even for me, like when there is peasefull protests for blm, there are cops driving over people and when reps are doing this there are like no cops to stop them
I mean, since i'm french, i'm kinda getting used to protests sinse 3 years lol
oh no, private company enforsing their TOS, what a shame
with what is happening now, the kirigear fig for july is verry optimistic tbh
i might check it out then
is the manga finished or not
like every magical girl anime basicly
yes
MS site is the darkest MS that i watched to be fair
true, forgot about them because i coud't be free when they released
and all of that with almost zero advertisement for it
like there were almost none 3 years ago but now we got fate, the shinkai's movies, liz no aoi tori and soon violet evergarden
i think cinemas are starting to gasp the fact that there is demand for anime in the big screen
there were 2 screenings at the same time originaly but they oppened a new room when i ordered because others were full
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<@!114081181611458563> lol

going into details to what happends in every floor
it is filling the voids that the aincrad arc made
boths
and not skipping 99% of the thing due to time constraint
you can find them in the 7 seas
did you like (spec ops asuka) || torture bdsm rapeich || scene?
except gekidol, i realy didn't like that one
and bonus: this season has a lot of ecchi, so cya, going to the horny jail
+
altho, it's an idol show and not a lot of ppl like it
I personaly realy like it, it's like the hidden treasure from this season, a good show that's going under the radar of most
yup, same thing for me, but it's just a secondary character, I dont expect her to be present that mutch
release the Aoi!
might watch it, thanks for the rec
slime 300 episode 1 was kinda meh but i realy liked episode 2
86 is verry promising and good so far
vivy is my favourite of the season and is a must watch so far, dont sleep on it!
higehiro is for a dose of wholesome romance but the manga goes a bit downhill, will still be nice tho
kinda yeah
trigger studio is nautorious for making alien plot twists at the end of their series (franxx, kill la kill, they are also old employees of gainax that made guren lagan, evangelion)
in zombie land saga last episode
am i the only one who feel like the song intro was made by element garden ? (around 13:30)
today episode beeing like
https://tenor.com/view/crab-dancing-crab-party-rave-cool-moves-gif-15701153
I got it listed as 24 episodes on mal, is it a split cour?
the reason why she sound familiar
spoted a megadeath party (takt op.) <:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
|| <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> ||
it's more yuri bait than anything realy
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
probably, the brain is basicly a muscle you have to train, but I dont realy want to do it with the short amount of time
the only free time I have is in the week end and if I dont rest, i wont be able to perform for studies and work.
And reading books in english can count as working, so yeah, I wont train my brain for this anytime soon
it's not a reading problem, it's like the auto translation layer in my brain that's draining me mentaly
70 pages is personaly a bit short for my liking because I like reading stories in 1 sitting, or at least a big chunk of it
In one session
and my most I read is like 500 pages in french
I can do like 50-70 pages before having to stop
I cant read english books, it's staining my brain a bit too mutch x)
I'm not planing to read the LNs because it's not translated in french but it was to contextualise myself to know where in % of adaptation we were
by the way, anyone know where in the LN the anime stoped?
I now need a S2 announcement
part 1 was exceptional but I found the || shin's brother arc in that part boring ||
part 2 is a bit bellow that and more predictable than part 1, but still both parts are 10/10 for me, I enjoyed that anime way too much
some characters are just there to cause drama
the manga is half super sweet it will give you diabetes, and the other half make you die of cringe
and it's also a complete story, wich is rare in the anime world
also as for underrated stufs, I found Egao no Daika very underrated, but it's just my taste.
it might have deserved 7, but not 6
at one time they think that we were making accounts just to bump up the rating, then they went after that type of things and it lost basicly nothing in score and they were surprised by it (they expected maybe 1 full point of drop or smth)
MAL thinks symphogear is overrated AF.
niche shows are allways disliked on mal aparently
me when watching this DAL episode
|| I have yet to be spoiled for what's to come, but that seems pretty obvious that marie will save him with her fish juice  <:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696> ||
||wasn't she unlocking the 30th deph in the prologue? But I dont think the current scale was the same as back then||
amongus the anime basicly, before it was even a thing
kanata to astra
it's fine. pretty average but it has a self contained story within the season, which only like 1% of anime do
yeah but that means "reincarnated" and "genious" and there are dozens of isekai with that name
or the meme nickname can be YuriSekai
or TenTen acording to anilist, but I find it less explicit, cauz there are like dozens that can have the same
MagiRevo
yeah ep4 it is
except biki who has a bit more between amalgam reveal episode (ep4?) and ep 8
i find it cool, and amalgams have like 2 mins max of screen time in xv
kirika amalgam has a smaller hat in the anime
last oav is already subed on the "cat sound website"
