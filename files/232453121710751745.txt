it's a CM3D2 mod


Side ponytail Chris  is so cute<:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

design is spoiler territory now when it's in the art and cd?
it's just bootleg evil nekomusume <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ||her bod is superior though||
are the reason hibiki is with dmjii now because chris is graduated?
When everyone else is jobbing, she takea center stage
just give me a pure all out battle
no more power ups pls
there is something wrong when her* xdu event managed to handle it better
haha no
>sensible
>chris's arc
i guess you could count the bavarian involvement too, if they actually planned that to be implemented way later than they imagined
except most of the ideas presented in the sequels were a follow up to what we've known and have been not been properly hinted at from the first season, topdad being only in the keywords comes to mind
of course they do, but for the sequel's case im sure it was made because the first one sold enough
didnt someone say it was originally meant to be standalone? so that was a lie?
```
Back in season 1, there was an interview in the Design Works book that describes how Symphogear first got started. One day I'll get around to finishing my translation, but for now here's the gist: Agematsu wrote down a bunch of ideas into a notebook. He gave this notebook to Kaneko and asked him to write a story. However, they only had 13 episodes to work with so Kaneko picked only some of those ideas to use. ```
and theyre supposed to be the so called :representative" for overseas anime
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
i thought they already implemented that?
>html 5 addon
only normies use it anyway
good
>2003 anime
par for the course for most seasonal anime nowadays, i keep wondering what it was like back then when people were genuinely interested and not forget everything about it after the season ends
Too busy talking about the latest hit meme animu of the season
xv can blow for all i care, just want to see my lovely wife one last time
unless someone like junichi directs again
excpetion to the rule, its not happening again
haha yeah right have you seen precure
>getting arcs
>males
3 more weeks until chris transformation <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
its on nyaa
oh its out already? idk why people are spoiling themselves with the music when its going to be in the show though
but then people still spoil themselves anyway <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
it has always been just bikkis since gx afaik
Neapolitan = brown, yello, pink. Shirabe is black haired = fail
And commie's joke fails because cag makes a joke on the characters while theyre not in gear form, the first thing that should come to anyones mind is their gear colors since their first confrontation
since theres no upper boss to mess with them
its all about getting shit done rather than running around willy nilly
yes
its all about what they can do and less about power levels, millarc is less powerful yet she managed to fuck up tsubasa, vanessa accomplished more than the other villains in less episodes
at least theyre not pretending to
good thing xv is avoiding that and villains are actually jobbing now
Dont diss exceed, its a cool name https://youtu.be/L2OBpsUK5PU
If theres wa references maybe
WA is geah related <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Did he really involved in a game before wild arms? I didnt know since theres no article of him
Better emulate it
The ps4 ver is really bugged, you can crash rsndomly and lose the progress you were at
mind you 3 isnt bad i just found it really padded
so that means i pretty much played all except 5 and the remake, in terms of story id rank them 2>1>xf>4>3
its all written by kaneko except 5 he only produced it
well if id recommend which one to play first 2 (or 3 depending on your taste) is pretty much a good entry
play 2, it's the closest to s1 in terms of feel and themes
And then they sneer on twitter at people for not "getting the joke", fuck commie seriously
Its 4
Ep 4 should be up
Isnt it 2 eps every 1 xv ep
What did CR translate i wonder?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Renne best girl
Cold steel is the weakest in the series anyway
Its a little subtle but she does comment on chriss size
Tbh by real life standards her sizd is pretty modest
but aoi said it will be hype
>I hope angst and disaster will happen
im not ready for having to wait every week
so we got an indian english character now, interesting
who is this dumb monkey boy

imagine how bikki would feel if carol killed them all on the spot <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
that would just give her more excuses to put off work
what good is reviving the dolls for? have them as elf9 personal toy pet?
2nd 1 is better because they talk about mechanical parts
are people forgetting how mindflay is amplifying her mental state
nah
kanade would play a role in the season considering the direction, but she shouldnt be the deus ex to restore basa
A self insert blank state with chris <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Hm, now that vita homebrew is out i should prolly try it
Today's sword feels somewhat different
M: im back tsubasa. 
M: What was up with you today? That wasnt like you
M: your behavior is scaring kirika and shirabe of- hnm?!
M: wai-
T: youre being noisy maria...
T: sorry but let me have my way with you today...
They didnt tease the axz end for nothing you know
As a trainwreck sure
I doubt people find genuine merit in it though
Ange was pretty interesting guilty pleasure trainwreck
i thought it was the cane that responded to their wills or something
wasnt it xd chris that opened the portal ?
though i dont remember if hibiki also had something to do with it
about how maria's song gathered all the phonic gain around the world? i think they addressed that this episode
and with the ukraine connection it all makes sense
its not a stretch to say it could be nuclear meltdown
no if you look at the ground its all gas masks

what if fudo was actually a boomer from ww ii that discovered immortality <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
yeah
oh right, the setting is an alt history of the real world
from keywords?
the op shows the maria sisters in a ruined and abandoned place, its possible that theyre nuclear meltdown survivors
they all wouldve died from relic cancer i assume <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
not sure if exhaustive though
links for others under description
so about wild arms references, niconico has a collection of it from s1-4 https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm31639912
was the previous seasons for her attacks translated
so i just saw the screencap for kiri's attacks, i cant believe someone managed to translate it
she hasnt got her big eating moment since g tbh
i wonder if shes casual
though im using gamer lightly
a gamer, a bookworm, and a sharpshooter what more could you ask for

so she is officially a geek now, truly /our/girl
which ep is that
>after op
theres a shot of her bookshelf?
the part after xiii is best, i will never get over it
what if its actually hard
come to think of it i dont remember how much her boobs jiggle in the series
forget bullet boobs, how does in gods name does maria's assets break a fucking *steel chain*
i mean as in big eater
when we go by the fitness event in xd
i think chris might be on marias level
if anyones a fatass its bikki
if the op wasnt obvious
but fine was a girl ?
i love her
for someone so bashful she can sure take things straight
it was the same in g against ver
chris is so bold to not mind others ahem*business* when prioritizing saving others
ok does anyone from the animation department have an anorexic fetish? i forgot how stand out her rib cage looks there
carol technically isn't *dead*
or just make it like yami yugi
after switch
she had inorins voice the entire time <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
the zoid monster
the zoid monster is more split second since i didnt
i noticed it the first time, but didnt know they were alluding to gx poses
so they could just used it for later seasons
from the production standpoint a lot of the ideas couldnt make it in
reminder https://twitter.com/AsagiKurosagi/status/943198261011128320
the other one i can think of is chris henshin from gx but im not gonna comment on that
even with cheat
i still give them credit for beating main trio
Fis being natural born jobbers from start, heh
pikachu face?
yeah theyre going to be plot relevant but still
its strange how we keep seeing new footage of maria sisters past but not with kanade though
flashbacks dont count
kanade will appear, tsubasa has mentioned her name like.... 3 times
Was it actually 119s eyes
Its not her voice either
Or actually intwntional reference
Its straight up from FE
most people do, g onward really made them really look distinctive
has some kinda charm in it but it was kinda same face
its different character designer after all
how can someone be cute and handsome at the same time
~~she was eating off bikki the whole time?! <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812> ~~
w-wait, are those not the tangerines chris ate in the ova
Have they commented what caused it? Or will they
The delay was worth <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
long intro version where
though whether shell use her song is still up in the air, it probably will judging how they used it for axz
the bday picture in ep 2 shows easter egg for bd 4
it will
i like her kuudere roles best
new on inorin? she has a pretty good voice range after all
gx had an extra action scene on chris ep
you mean g
all the others got the same outfit, no
maybe
all geahs? idk
still curious what metanoia is going to be considering we already have almagalm (this seasons powerup)
dont remember what the name is though
theres a keyword for that though
unless youre talking about gatling gear and not the actual gun
yeah all i remember was flying devices from her, might need to rewatch it then
did she used her gatling in axz finale? im starting to think she doesnt have it on xv gear
imo more military related firearms would just make her into a homura clone fighting style, shes much more different than that
also she stopped using bows too for whatever reason, either theyre focusing on new moves or theres only so much to show for 1 character
chris clearly had enough of basa's shit when she didnt tell her about bikki's situation
its still gunkata
~~now that it broke the 8 barrier is it cool to hate it now <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556> ~~
still disliked by the other characters
hikasa characters cant avoid the bully treatment no matter who writes it
cause gambling is illegal there apparently
its slots but not for money, more like prizes
and here's miku in a wedding dress, way before xdu was released https://youtu.be/CfMnYIqaOxU?t=769
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVwvH5d4f0g&feature=youtu.be&t=8m45s
the pachinko have some very nice scenes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKGSCL3hBhk&feature=youtu.be&t=7m44s
Inb4 hibiki will reach genjuros level of power without gear in the future <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Imagine if the last time she became relevant is after tsubasa gets healed
Kanades presence has been concerningly very little to none for all the returning characters thats been going in
Inb4 its from axz
But i liked the song from ep 9, that one was from xv RIGHT?
Really hard to tell which one is new or not
From the bds theres a shitton of new songs that come out, and that is going include reused songs from previous seasons
Even though the scene doesnt even have bikki in it
Like literrally used last episode, or was it the 2nd last one
Its a pretty recurring leitmotif used whenever shit gets real
Vgmdb has a full list of the artists https://vgmdb.net/album/66395
he already broke basa this season, it can happen
shell be back to say goodbye to bikki
new keywords confirmed miku might be gone? that makes all the off trio dead then
just not immidietly
they still update it
youd have to see the ingame xdu notifications for that
but the content isnt uptodate with the content currently in the game
its in their official twitter and xdu site blog
sol is a pretty broad term that has its own set of subgenres, like iyashikei, comedy or drama
i have not seen an iyashikei that isnt sol
literally the same thing
>iyashikei
>sol
I need this but with maria
Would that make the anthology manga the same characters? I read it and some of them were kind of ooc
If theyre written by different ppls would that technically even make them the same "characters" 🤔
But events are a different canon <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
What is sword breaker <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
We got really good character interactions that parts of the anime couldnt do, id say thats a pretty huge payoff
Makes me wish theres a 2.5 or even 1.5, but i guess they only wanted to make 3.5 to promote the new season while the game was still new
What
The manga wasnt just action
Its probably the closest you can get to an alternative alita series
i just like it better when it wasnt pretending to be deep
read the mango <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
and more jiggling
except with less assess
its 2b automata all over again
so like
**organic material**
that was clearly made of organic material
also did you see the entire time she was fighitng bikki/chris
if she has missles and guns shed most likely have internal thermal insulation i hope
you wouldnt know if shed survive had you experienced it the first time either ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
shes just getting the sakura treatment
title makes it seem like well get info dumps on lore for firsthalf, then the usual battle second half
yes you could chalk it up to its a waste if its only used for 1 ep for new designs but theoretically does this mean their last ignition forms are still the gx gears as base?
im probably not the only one that noticed this but how come their xdrive forms were still the same considering its different every season?
doesnt japan still have a lot of unreported stuff
not saying it couldnt be done by an extremist fan, but whatever triggered it clearly rubbed the guys sensibilities. a part of a community or group should not be taken into account at all
it still boggles my mind that it is so easy for people to take in what they are taught to take as facts... this is me speaking as a closet atheist that have to live with a religion on "paper".
just goes to show how its the nature of man, and how different any type of group can become, not just restricted to religion
but something like syariah is bad no matter what
well we still have to keep in mind how even religion have different sects and how its different interpretation for each individual how they see it fit
is it as hype tho
gunpla was animated toys but it looked better
if you watched frame arms girl i disagree
im not convinced
>cg toys
no pun intended, lol
i think the ost and action made it up for it
