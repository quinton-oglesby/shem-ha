Why does the Man who has everything fix Justice League's portrayal of the charatcer
Which makes you wonder, why in his first appearance he seems almost pathetic
And throughout the episode Mongul demonstrates his capabilities both tactical and physical

Drinking is helping me
Your advice followed by emoji takes away the weight it should have
Man, I'm drinking I'm loneliness away rn
I need more alcohol
Yes because people would go out of their way for it
The disconnect between the online and irl
That's the big thing to remember
It won't affect your real life tbo
But if he wants to invite you doesn't that say a little bad about you
Raid question mark

How long did it take for you to figure it was transphobic
And ruin his e-life
This is the part where you expose him to all his new friends
I'm sorry but it is the end of the world for me
Im gonna grab some more
Doesn't that just make me pathetic? Someone who can only achieve the greatest good I'd human but also worthless
That I need friends to be hsppy
How disgusting is that
Iv literally done everything I could to make friends and be happy
What's the point in byifhna handle if I don't use it
I've realized it long ago, I'm an annoying bastard. I want people to either vocally hate me or like me. To live life without acknowledgement is no life at all. Maybe that's why I ruined pug's real problem. I'm bad here focus on pugs earlier provlem
Anti that's just ignoring the issue
I've been trying my best to act with no disntinctness
I ruin everything
Maybe yr right pug
So why do I have to b e the guy alone while everyone else was able to have fun
I tried my best y'know
Like wtf what did I do wrong
But the freedom part means shit if your friends leave you
I went away to college so I can have freedom and hang out with friends
I'll have to face it all if I do that
Cause and effect
I'm drinking because loenly
You should pursue a field in thwrapy
Yes growing up makes me feel less shit
Even after trying your best to make friends why even bother snymore
But seeing your friends and neighbors have isuch fun is killer
I wish being lonely was easy to get over
I heard someone at my school was able to come back from death so that's a later goal
The goal tonight is blackout
I can't this is the only place where people will acknowledge I exist
The cart attached just makes it
Like, I'm in the opposite of your situation where I need to start eating more
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721> idk if I was in ur situation I would do some basic cardio
So no working out?
Do you do any physical activities
Ok that's a bit of an oomfie
A lot of guys eat way more than that
That doesn't seem too bad
You went to a doctor about this?
What's ur diet like

Huh
