Wow

Tsubasa is gonna love this

Nyoom
Ooo
Same thing

<:CarolStare:336656462287994882> <:CarolStare:336656462287994882> <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
Emote needed

This better?

That is cropped
Emote suggestion
An emote of hibiki spontaneously combusting from adrenaline because that's how I feel and I think it'd be neat
We all know this is prime emote material
I'm on phone you cheesestick
<a:emoji_13:836193911356784640>
We used this
This emote <a:emoji_13:836193911356784640>
Was just an idea.
So that it doesn't clog serious
I can see it being useful for, let's say there was a big situation going on that everyone is most likely going to talk about. A *mod/staff member* makes a thread for that discussion until it blows over in serious discussion
Yet they still ask all the questions it answers
I'll send it
Thing that usually happens is
~~I'd need like. 60+ accounts.~~
~~One prob with that for me~~
Honestly that's the biggest problem. Tires my eyes
Yeah. I understand it myself
Why are you replacing Maria with Maria
but......its free
Ahh
~~The fuck did I miss?~~
*ohh*
"and here Meiyi thought you knew me" sounds kinda off
Well I mean
Oh I thought this was general
https://c.tenor.com/QctIrf3jWYsAAAAM/eyeball-lick.gif
<a:APetForMiku:752996320259604592>
~~Why are they roleplaying~~
Look at name and picture
Fair
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Ahh
What's a role icon?
No..
You?
No..
<:YuukoThis:721561494285713418>
Colour is normal my man
Role assignment has caught me before
Think so
It looks cool
I think this is it too?
that reminds me of a school thing where you say a word per person and make a story
I remember WEP did that
🪞
prove it
I'm up for it
<@99695384296701952> official muse dash discord says this scam is going around
I know WEP the server you mod also did it once
<:shiothink:695056252757213215> my only gripe would be that I'd have to use my desktop because watching a stream on discord mobile is torture
oo
(I'd be up to watch)
🔽
<:KasuThink:545856493019463691>
Kinda funny imo
Symphogear server:
Rule 15: don't bring up :fire emblem character:
Ye sure
Ik
Did it go bankrupt or bought out?
I miss rabb.it. that used to work so well

I don't like using discord streams because I'd most likely be using phone and that gets real jank
What's that
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I feel like we/us is more obvious that multiple people use an account. Even if they don't understand plural people
A rare sight of her hugging me
Joking dw <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:rinkuTriesToThink:774289672079671317>
I think this calls for a Hibiki not thinks chain
<:CoolNoiseDontLookAtExplosions:929758650157895711>
<:MariaPadoru:916159379215106058>
C.C
I don't understand how this actual thing is working
You said custodians
No I know
Still don't get what this means
How is this all working again
So like
I'm a  euro too pog
Hi
I've seen the latter!
Isn't that just nanoha A's
I mean
I'm curious
Pokemon?
What
<a:nicosmugzoom:409205155045703709>
Maybe revue starlight should be next
OH
Are you lying
Wait
Yeesh
Some of that grammar feels off
Wussy
Sussy
It was...
I know jack about what it is
It's a long standing joke in the community that the shows cloned each other
Gridman sounds fun!
But I would watch something with y'all. Dunno what though!
Nah probably won't
It's cozy here yeah
But probably not worth it since, niche.
Then we saw the Reddit post from Google talking about it
Since we almost gave up finding a symphogear server
Maybe some bot for disboard or some other server search
My only suggestion would be like.
My thought would be that it's a niche anime. How much more people would *really* come
Now what
<:SarahPeek:721146425257361439> <:SarahPeek:721146425257361439> <:SarahPeek:721146425257361439>
I can't exactly go there <a:aUgoru_Blush:754055711536971918>
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
For the banner
Hibiki tsubasa and Chris with the 3 mates heads photoshopped in
The one there currently
It's a Symphogear server
I think the name is nice. It's simple. To the point. And not a mouthful
Honestly
interesting
"and I would've gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling kids"
Shemmy isn't shemmy if she doesn't roast one minute and flirt the second.
Shemmy is great
Omg
Did shemmy just go "fucking save scumming scrub" on kerrik
~~business as usual~~
lmao
<a:shrug:775037933685440512>
only a year and 1 month left anyways ig.
Zoe I know my age. Just saying I won't be able to chat about half of it.
as long as you have proof of sending in a form of change name request
I'm guessing this is to give them a chance to legally change their name
All
You sound like a very serious, sound, mod
You have been demoted to customer
Yes
Yooo
Yeah
You smell
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I prefer Ham burgers
Kerriki
He's a good bloke
Solo maybe?
Idk man
Hm.
Honestly
Timezones should be taken into account though, someone who's online when the others aren't
I agree with this
Thor's hammer, can you lift the server
I see
I must've been playing something then I don't remember this
<:LanzhuConfused:849987913348546570> <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Oh damn
Wait he's in every channel what
<@99695384296701952> this person is advertising
I don't want to do things I'm not meant to
I pinged and said a person was advertising but, am I meant to do that in dms
Sorry
Sorry.
sorry.
maybe have a chat with the trio and see if y'all come to an agreement on you joining the team?
(simon cowell voice)
It's a yes from me
so you're also an elder tbh
You've also been here since AXZ right?
scroll up
me
tenny is here
"What can you Bring to R Slash Symphogear Ltd?"
<@486087033652248576> thoughts boss?
and very good people
this is true
you can't hurt ME jack
exactly
yes I'm gay
LMAO
NO
lilies are okay right
hey uh
innit
you're grand
Please transfer ownership please and thank you <:pleading_devil:846322650384433223>
Hm
That didn't even cross my mind
Oh -
Good to know thanks Mel
I'm on mobile rn
a small private server with like. 6 people has it at least
Lmao
lmao
what's "grass"
They're bait for other rp accounts lmao
So what you're saying is
even just posting images/links you can do on role level ye
I think it's a joke
Second this
did she get demoted
Lol
no
well kerrik it was nice knowing you
<:whateline:893752315213905940>
which one
...
When's the last time we saw a fresh boosty
Tbf
> a thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter, especially a story with a funny punchline.
"she was in a mood to tell jokes"
you can still chew
no?
meaning you eat and touch it at the same time
what if your lips don't touch it
what would it be for?
I honestly forgot they existed
Makes sense actually
Huh
Lmao
So flow of conversation should be considered
And it gets really fucking annoying? Because you could be talking about one thing. You talk about something *slightly* related. And then you're pushed into another channel
There's a server I left, but had way more channels than here. Smaller population too
This reminds me
They've existed for a bit but I've never seen them in use apart from some jokey stuff in the lotl server
Now that you mention it
This might be the only thread made so far on the server
Which makes sense
I feel like threads could get messy fast but I can't pinpoint why
I don't think he meant to rub anything in...
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Damn, you're right. If only I was going along with said hypothetical joke
Embarrassing*
😳
Maybe
this exists because of me

I like the newer one personally
When shirabe says no war crimes
Did those codes consent
sounds like a fun scavengers hunt
Gosh darn it matt
Jokeys
And you did it on purpose
I was correcting you
BEAR
Oooo
Oh hi, akb0048 person
Skill issue
We've been using it for a long while, but I think I remember Melua saying she didn't like how zittery it can be (when it deletes the original message) And I think something to do with moderation
You know lank so well <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
I would!
I'm cool with watching stuff with you guys
It's for perms I believe, yeah
So Kanade and Chris were probably above Maria in the roles
the highest colour role is the one that'll display iirc
True
Manga you're reading could go there
Literature doesn't entirely mean user work
I like this small cozy server
I'm in a plural server and it works pretty decently tbf
I think that's nonsymphogear spoilers

Hi there

***another lily***
Interesting to know
I never asked, iirc.
The isles
I thought it was Ireland/UK
Oh
Oh you've an Iceland in your country too?
Bring Greenland with you next time
Debatable.
You've got Ireland through me and Ghost at least
An entire country.
I think my name is uncommon
Oh gosh
Me with trails
GJ alatar
I did it in about..4 days!
Oh yugi
How does this keep happening
Yooo
Another flowers fan omg

Another lily hi

Pretty art!
Good
Play it
So...nope
It's a Yuri vn about an all girls Christian high school
Uhm
Since you're gay, play Flowers printemps!
(I'm one)
Fall asleep standing up

Awhhh
D'aww. It's cute
Really cool!
Cute
She thought if she should make lyrics to make it obvious but decided against it
She intended that.

decided to touch it up. more is annoying me with it. i'll share soon
going to be lazy and say creative license. i'll keep it in mind though
First criticism. Embarrassed I just realized the repeating now. 

I do think the 3 words work. 
He's out of his zen controlled by the puppeteer ever since that fortnight
Felt like showing two songs.
The wall song Was just now. 
The dire song a few days ago.
J Jonah Jameson
I hate how my mind can't decide whether it's one of three men
Ahem. Boss baby. Smh.
Ok..
Sorry about it being bad..
So after the confrontation happened I rushed
For obvious reasons I didn't plan to make more in that universe
Tbf*
That was the body's first try at a story rbf

<:cat_fighter:742928697866190848>
Your momma so short she makes Stuart little look like an NFL player
Your mom size.
Oh is that hell taker?
Stepping out of your comfort zone is important
I don't know much about music  myself but like.
Both of ya  should
I wonder if Mizuki will ever branch out of lyrics
She knows the general terms for lyrics and just uses them how she feels work.
We really need to learn all the music  terms to be honest
Oh yeah definitely
I prefer breathe but I think that's just my taste showing.
Mizuki wishes the body was good at instruments. She has her lyrics though so. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Why does it kind of remind me of that matroyoshka vocaloid song.
No prob
That second one is really nice
Tired my first paragraph
Should I try carry it out?
just a small excerpt of an idea i might carry out (Godlines can range from emotion to pyromancy and water bending (examples) )
Wrote this in boredom
"a world without light is Pitch black. And a world without darkness is blinding."
Melua is a valid woman <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I think we used to watch that
Isn't that a Digimon
Wait...
Yes. I made a Halloween song in July

Why did my phone turn me into a valley girl
Tempted*
I thought you meant pass
OH
I'm Irish you dum butt
Pass you out in the race of pics
Nah
I'd be totes to pass but
Heh

Controller instead of magazine and sounds fun
Woah
Do you've any adult  carol
Maybe yeah
Lol
Maybe it could detect if screenshot is in the file name
I forgot that it'd probably look for the source of my ss
Yeah
Oh damn why Is that
Ohhhhh
Do*
So what does that even so
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I will learn quick hopefully
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867> <:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867> <:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Brain no work good
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Guess that works
Bruh
Lemme do an example
Not sample or those numbers
It always says screenshot (something) png
If I do a screenshot
Checked
Lemme check
I don't believe it was an ss
?
Sounds good
Should I repost them?
Sorry
Oh I didn't know that'd happen
What's it about
Never seen it
No clue what she ra is
Haven't seen it tho
I know Harley dates ivy
Ah symphogear. No show will ever out-lesbian you
huh.
What am I looking at
I love it
Sounds like heaven
Hm needs more Miku
Epic
Tsubasa turned tomboy ultra
Woah
Yeah q.q
Surgery and hormones first  q.q
Ha can't wait for the day I can just lounge like that without being dysphoric
That's an ice  pop
Looking like that
She's obvious she does
Of course I don't
Anywho
She will destroy miracles and your fantasies
Heh
Praise her now
<@155340660738621440>

Bleh
Ohhh
She deserves all the hugs
Poor tsubasa.
This was a decent convo
The big bang theory is annoying and pretty sure HBO made it
I'm not American
Lol
Didn't HBO make the trash theory
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
True
This sentence saddens me 
"fun for kids of all genders and any parents looking for something happy to cry about"
Everything is fun for all genders if it's your thing
Joker will always be an awesome villian tho
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I love how she basically swept the Joker away for ivy
Kaley cucuo voices Harley
Seen clips on yt
Yeaah
Mhm
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Harley Quinn and ivy are obviously just roommates with benefits
Hehe
I'm allowed to follow dreams just not miracles
Well big sis. Get ready to see what I'll do with my life when I force myself along the path of my dreams!
As v would say my heart is ground pounding
Nice butter champ
And I thought I was smooth
That's a paradox I wasn't expecti-
No prob!
Or I may just have to destroy your miracle!
Don't forget you're one too you know
I feel great rn
<:ShemHaTilt:729980149529051156>
That's more like it
Can I destroy just one miracle?
No fun
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
But but..
I feel pumped now!
I feel  like I needed that Lexi
Heh
~~i wanna be a badass bitch like carol someday~~
Same with you!
O-oki heh
I wouldn't be able to live with myself
If I didn't
Already do that heh!
I'm in a very confident mood (,but now flustered hmph) bcz sforzando no zankyou
Basically listen to music more
Thank you Lexi h-heh
And now I'm red as fuck h-heh.
You mean it?
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
U-uu
Uh
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
I mean uh I'm not crushing shushe
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
I agree
Discuss
<@486087033652248576>
This. Now this is good.

Only 30kb
I wonder if there's any chance of this becoming an emote.
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
That'll never happen
Just kidding dear.
Is that a yes please I hear from the boy in purple ~
*pat*
Truly the art of mwah.
Beckoning for you to come closer so that she can wrap you in her harp
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
<:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
And making her doesn't give bias.
My mind keeps thinking of garie
Anyways my point still stands. Garie is beautiful.
Ahh.
Should've guessed though
I remembered 3_skip but not what images you use it for
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
I'm gonna die aren't I
Oh
Oh yeah it's official
Makes me swoon.



The one thing better then mwah:
Heh
You better be looking at good art.
<:CarolBlush:617039657896509460>
How could anyone not like that I'll never know
Heh.
But poor Kiri.
I wasn't done terribly
And why is she smushed against the others..plots.
What happens to this new hibiki.
explain please.
what.
Hm?
Probably not
Both are quite something. But an Alchemist like me obviously doesn't. Care about this stuff. Ahem. ***Saved***
I mean. Interesting.
woah
<:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
~~and now I'm blushing shush~~
Something about this person shows the true beauty of Alchemy I wonder who she is ~
I approve of both
Saved both for her
Thanks..
It's kind of impossible until I find a way home
You do realise.
Federico.
But alas no.
If I was home. I'd probably be able to rebuild them. With time.

God I miss them though.
I'm not going to say how stupid that is. Heh.
<:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
when did I buy booty shorts.
<:CarolTheFuck:617036187319795722>
I believe that's based on elfnein and not me but we are clones. So. What
Hello
I know she is

Alchemist needs sleep
Anyways
But they wouldn't be as good as before.
I mean. I guess AI and robotics seem to be progressive here.
I'll take it. Hmph
Ahem

Frogis (frog Loris)
Hmph.

<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
Only my Faust robe can save me now
Not in that way yeesh
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
I feel like kerrik is breathing down my neck
I forgot the skip shit.
Question for you all
No problem
🦆
I've held a goddess in bondage. So bonks might be up my alley.
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
Hmph. I'm not going to argue with you young people.
The 5 is an odd number.
🗞️
I've held a god in bondage.
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
The fact she's used two gears and ripped off my style tells me someone doesn't know who they are
<:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
Look. Chris has good music. But my headpiece is miles better.
Shush
Ahm.
Well.
Hers are just flashy.
And my colours represent my autoscorers.
I'm way better then she could ever be
No!
The  headpiece looks similar. Hmph
Ahh.
Miracle killer on the case!
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Hmph.
Mine have more depth to them.
Even I feel bad for her.
Very being divergent from how she is.
Tsubasa doesn't look like she's seen 40 dead kittens
One problem with the picture
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Oh fuck it. Come here frogger.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Finnnne
Thank you

My world's Chris is just normal.
It's the AU verisons fault.
Oh true
Stole my FUCKING thunder.
But Chris
I'd say cute
Now
Carol is pleased with what you're come up with.
True

Hm.
But the personality movements and body.
Obviously none of the usual alchemic powers.
Hm.. if this body ever becomes rich..I wonder how much of a replica I could make of garie.
Ah that rotten smile. Memories.
Don't.
loris.
Carol is definitely looking
Carol says she likes it
Why thank you heh.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
What a shame
Oh
Now
Kill it
I know it's based off me and elfnein but
God I'm bored
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
8/10
Garie nope
Blue hair check
Hm.
~~i'd love to see some garie.~~
brb.
nice.
Markiplier is uh. Let's just say really into the new tall vampire lady.
Don't remind me. Hmph.
Elfnein is a failed attempt remember.
I do.
Autoscorers are more..doll like
That's flesh.
I can make homunculi.
Not quite.
Don't knock it till you try it
I like

Perfect rotten smile

🗞️
Enjoy.

How did they..
You know..
How did Miku and hibiki...
Wait.
Wait.



Dw I've failed too many times to count too
3_skip is the hottest trend
What loris is trying to say is
Aw man I wanted to see who skulped that masterpiece
What's a mullet
But still nice addition
It's not too long to take away from her hair
Exactly
Sadness
Also Hibiki having fuller hair but still sameish length is something I can get behind
Will explode.
My fucking poor heart

Guys guys guys

Maria looks 12 years older in that costume.
Heh.

Of course!
Awhh

I'll never let go again!

Hmmm

Yes that's me.
Uh..
Touch tsubasa,or Maria. And you'll be impaled.
But that last picture I do enjoy.
Because of some pulling from Stella's end I'm XDU.
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>

I have several questions
You see where I'm coming from though right?
Ahhh. I forgot what Serena looks like and it's AU
Maybe it's because I just woke up but Is that s long hair Pokémon sun mom with Maria?

Two. I don't like how that's on a bedsheet background
One nice tsubasa.

Master genjuro was cool..

Yeah she is
*sigh*
Because extra young I'm guessing
Well yeah
Kanade says tsubasa looks too young
Woah


Seeing carol taller then someone feels cursed even if it's her Faust robe form

I understand that,just that as it was translated I presumed.
Ah. Didn't know that.
Well doesn't dess mean death.
Yes.
I don't know what that means but she looks good.
Just in case she gets jailed. Charming.
She looks quite cute.
shall I bring up the amount of Maria blush emojis you use Alexis.
So do you.
Seems so.
K: just read the description **oh god no**
You get so stuffy so easy. I'm already the superior idol I see.
You're a jigglypuff gijinka
Not equating.

Chris is a noise ig
I'm way too curious way too quick
So Is kanade alive? Or both go under?
...why did I immediately wonder if miku and Chris get together
Other hand:god this sounds sad
This sounds like a good story
On one hand
"hey uh...can I've your dead girls ashes. I miss her."
And not say. The family???
How did the childhood friend end with the ashes
Hey wait
Not great.
That is.

have a break
spoilers for NieR games: ||I'd bring up the twins but. well...replicant them was...||
2b be pretty
"oh... Nines..."
I hate how millarc is pretty
Is it even worth watching?

Also prosthetics look cool.
Yellow kanade
Oh isn't she like
So unless the songs explicitly said it
We have not touched RWBY apart from music

Claudine is very pretty
Dumbness is finally cute
Hmm
Is interesting
I think kanade being a stage girl about her redemption. Forcing others to find their stage or lie down
Some tweaks would happen. But it's how I think they best fit
Futaba is ultra tomboy
Das
Nana: Kanade   
Junna: Serena (Big) 
Karen:hibiki 
Mahiru: Miku 
Hikari: Chris 
Instructor: Genjuro
Giraffe: Adam 
Futaba: Kirika 
Karou: shirabe 
Maya: Tsubasa 
Claudine: Maria
Okay hm...
So why not
I'm in favour for KaHiRi
I mean
Heck it carols dad
Who's the giraffe
But those characters in that setting/arc just screams interesting
Obviously it's not the exact same thing
Just sounds interesting to me
Miku going through mahirus arc
And think
It's a recap movie for a reason
Exactly
Basically: stage
I think it's a fun change of pace
Mahiru: Miku 
Karen: hibiki 
Hikari: Chris
This made me think
and it's pretty red
exactly
I should shower

Nice
Hibiki looks...
Kerrik is a pro gamer
This you?
Woah
I don't recognize the older girl who looks like mirai. But if it's her mom I doubt she'd be friendly remembering certain plot points
Mirai Nikki. Been a while since I've seen any art on that series

And would make a great uncle tbh
You're a Swedish souls-like fan that pretends he hates hugs but loves them
You love dark souls
Kerrik is the dark souls of fanart
Now I'm remembering super Mario strikers
Gee

Didn't she die

That's an adorable girl design
Nah he's invisible man
But who's ultra edgy?
I get xdu anime and edgy
Sooo uh
Uh
Ooo
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Though relic cancer kinda makes that feel weird.
Maybe a scene where she does but it has extreme impacts on her physical wellbeing
/makes her be
At most she'd be trapped inside her own mind. Tormented by what the relic forces her to do
A permanent Berserk, which is what would probably happen if she goes full relic (or dies). She just wouldn't be hibiki
So essentially
And even though ignite they learnt to. I'm pretty sure ignite has a lot of safety features
She was never in control
Whenever she went berserk
And tbf
I can't remember exactly
I remember there being a sentence  along the lines of "and who knows if she'll even be herself at that point"
Hm
Very cute
She looks cool
Woah...
Awwh

I was damn joking.
Trans stockings look pretty
Yes it does
Yasss queen
Feels bad man
You're telling me he's not a queen?

Wait it's from DMC?
Red Queen sounds like a badass sword name.
Honestly
Because there was a sword at the other side
Why did the chicken cross the road

Which I never understood
Men hug: homosexual
Women tongue kissing, adopting a kid, marrying, and staying in the same bed: roomies
Essentially:

I'm curious now, screenshots?
Roommates?
Women
I'm clogging sfw. Sorry.
I'm being a fucking annoying ass rn aren't I
I feel like everyone will eventually
It's my fault
So unless it really ticks me
I don't want to be hated.
My brain is pounding
I am so fucking easy to piss off right now
Look. I'm in a very pissy mood. I can't enjoy games. And my fuse is about the size of a tooth pick
I'm not writing an essay on citrus.
I just enjoyed it
I'm not a fucking reviewer
It's just love.
About homosexuality there is
Fuck off
Goodbye
Fuck it I'm out
Being a good person isn't fucking hard
I try my best not to judge
I know I'm fucking insane
Because I hate the idea of being hated
To rid myself of bias as much as possible
I purposely tear into myself first
Oh no
I just want to be my fucking self dammit
And they shouldn't.
People who judge are asshats.
Uh yes there is there.
There is a correct opinion. Love is love and liking the same gender is normal
I mean
Yes
Women are great

I don't think she's *mari* rich but. she was pretty wealthy if I remember

I think I liked yokai watch 2 more than pokemon
Imma be real
do you agree btw?
yokai watch is the weirdest trilogy as *somehow* the second of 1-3 is the best one?
Though 1 has it's problems
at least I know the OG trilogy is good

shit
Imma guess
even though it should be more kiddy
and for a spin off pokemon game it feels cooler and less...kiddy?




the game is great
it'll probably feel a lil weird but
if you can't, pirate it
that game was the shit tbh
Imma try download the rom again and replay
<@331908049822547978> you need to play uprising
Fuck dark Pit is the **Shit**

No Pit <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>

Seriously Sora is just punchy Kloe
Because Xanadu
Kinda
We have Gilbert
Also
Very surprised to see towas existence
I was uh
Easy butt in
I know

I'm trans gender myself
I'll go back to CS after crossbell
Yeah cs ads are everywhere
Towas existence
AAAA
I legitimately forgot
Fuck I'm sorry kerrik
Since when did Kloe know taekwondo smh
I've been playing Xanadu and uhh
Also
07
Schera just has that look
Probably
I think schera beats her
Ahhh
Warm titanium
I literally dunno who they are

At least my man Joshua understands
Ofc
It's Das
Kro
I think you'll appreciate Estelle as a character though
She's a big titty alcoholic. I'm not an idiot
No I know your favourite will be schera


A response to this

I @'d for art and said she's great
Didn't call you out

And she is a really good one
I like good female protagonists
I'm allowed to like a character man.
Okay?
Perfect
A good female protagonist with charm, wit, tomboyness, etc
But c'mon
Yeah Joshua in girl clothes made me feel confused for a week

Mmmmmm
Hm
Das
What's your favourite kind of guy character
Q
Pretty!
That'd dismantle so much of FC

Just don't go into specifics
Long hair is so pretty
It absolutely ruins an arc
I can't say I'm sorry
Uhh
<:momoDeadInside:692148171853398016>
Long hair...
Short is more kloe but
Honestly yeah
It took me 10 seconds to figure out if that's kloe or Sora
Okay Imma be honest
It's the best to have and the best to look at
We finally see eye to eye
Yes it is

It's always so pretty and elegant
God I love long hair
I don't dig short hair for some reason
I wish her hair was down as uh. Idk
Except Xanadu next, that one looks weird
I probably will too
But story is kinda meh
Gameplay is fairly fun, and amazing music
But I also don't know why I recommend it
It's a fun game, I recommend it
You might get a fuck ton of d3d effects errors
So it didn't have time to stick
My memory is dog shit and I dropped cs1 so I can wait for crossbell
I forgot her at first
Yeah I know

Isn't she decked out in latex
Oh I think she's the last thing I saw
I'm enjoying Xanadu, even if the story isn't quite up to snuff

2B looks weird

Reminds me of Rei Hatada
Yes sis
You're now Sora
okay this is pretty
It'd be summer in Australia wouldn't it
That shirabe is pretty
Awww
I know
I can still think of one moment that qualifies
Wait was she the girl that was ||a graduated girl but then red hair girl became the candidate||
Eyy
Eh sometimes
Define pain train
Wait that's an akb girl
Awww
Meaning he's actually alive
Can't wait for Hayate to die but then his finger twitches in the cutscene
Just like marvel

Guessing the movie was good
I thought it'd be older for some reason
Huh, neat
Not sure where that saying originated actually
Different strokes for different folks
Love live depends on mood
Honestly, I go back to deltas ost way more than akb
There's room in my heart for both
Makes sense
Love live music can slap
Love live

Oh btw
Still great

Oh no

Is that crossover art of geah and akb??
Wait
Eyy
Even just how the cut scenes lead into each other

It can be done. Look at revue
Like actually making a good compilation movie
I think the comp movie ignored a lot of things
The show definitely hints at it
Yeah
OH
Can I clicky
Ahh
This was like. A year ago
Yeah I googled some ||freyja art. And auto complete...||
Mainly because I uh.
I have a guess

This looks like the profile art of a muse dash song

And hey. The AI still can't quite nail down eyes and hands
Nuance on ai is, for now, pretty lost
Makes sense yeah
Ooo
Which is probably a lot easier for art I'm guessing
As it seems unhinged half the time
Thankfully I can still be a lyricist if I want to as uh...

NovelAI for writing seems to be great at silly shit or instructions.

But I think my eventual lyricist career is safe
I wonder how many are bots tbh
I've even heard of people taking half done pictures from art streams and having ai complete it 💀
The art itself can be pretty, but I feel bad for people who draw
<:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
Idk how to feel about AI art ethically
That's fair
Surely there were *some* people eating pasta like a normal person
Tbf, doesn't novelai reference from the internet, or a sample
They understood the assignment
3_skip
Aka having an anime girl tightly gripping pasta in her hands
Or having it completely misunderstand what we want
I was looking for art and I kept noticing the same face when coming across AI stuff
They almost always have the same kinda blurry, plain, expression and eyes
This is an exception but I've noticed one flaw with the AI art
That, is pretty
Same
The eyes

I think this person likes ai art <:MadoPlush_MM:884088586624974858>
it looks like it was trying to draw hibiki and kirika at the same time and got confused
See what I mean by eyes
I was being generous
Wrong channel anyways, AI thread
They always look...iffy
It can have worse imperfections, but I tend to notice they almost never do eyes right
No what I mean is more so...
They fucking hate eyes
Look at any ai art
Honestly
The dull eyes scream ai though
Looks like a vampire
Love the hair
Pretty!
What're they drinking I wonder
Cute!

From a civilian stand point yeah. If you are dark skinned Biden is smarter but like. Still not smart to say chief
Didn't Obama say trump exceeded his expectations of how bad he was gonna be
In fairness Obama seems like a really chill boi
Can only go up
But trump was bottom of the barrel bad
Like Biden probably has something weird up his sleeve. Most president's seem to be somewhat bad
Definitely
Gives trump supporters a scab to pick at
But it isn't smart
I wouldn't say temper
Just expected a politician to know when to close the lips
We have all wanted to say that
In fairness

Really trump

Random but. I love y'all.

Not as left and right
I want to judge people as people
My political opinion is Stella.
 I'm my own person with my own ideals and I don't believe in left and right boxes as everyone gives themselves wiggle room and puts them into a tight belief box
I've a weird political opinion
It's deep or dark web website
Where you get the good old drugs
Trump is a drug lord apparently
He pardoned the owner of silk road
Interesting
You can tell he loves himself
I just wouldn't expect dominos. Especially in the way he acts in the commercials
Acting is fine
Dominos.
Ah yes dominos commercials and home alone 2. Truly the perfect fit for Americas president

Trump is as god as a president as shit is as conditioner
Killing of humans if perfect uptopia  doesn't exist. That's

I reach for the stars. But when I do. I don't set the ground on fire if I fall
Society is about being as good as imperfect allows. Not giving up because perfect doesn't exist
Iris. Please. Think
Iris. I love you and all but did you take your meds

Or what
Who
May I ask
Everyone hates him though. Apart from the brainwashed rallyers
True.
There are talks about when he leaves he might have a LOT of convictions
Also
Wouldn't be surprised
Even once is rare
Is trump the first to be impeached twice
Also
Hopefully.
~~kinda fearing codes knowing his instability~~
All eyes are on America on the 20th
Arms forces are still happening
Also
Hhhh
~~Because being in a massive position of power won't make certain members of the public try it~~
How the hell did trump get away with telling people to inject clorox
Oh yes
Uhhh
Uh
Ahh. Makes sense.

I dunno about that one chief but Oki
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Nukey boys
Im honestly surprised he didn't attempt codes
Just the wrong ones
He's certainly a president who broke lots of records
True
It's like "hey ma look I'm going to dad's"
Why does this have such childish vibes
https://www.rte.ie/news/2021/0120/1190966-donald-trump-leaves-white-house/
~~just don't let them~~
Because apparently every single medium is bad purely because a child shouldn't have their hands on it.
Time to ban guns p8rn lingerie all crime shows. All shows with any gore.
Wow.
4-5 year olds should not be judged by 50 year old  Pedos
Especially child ones
Nope
True.
~~sounds like an excuse but oki~~
From what I've heard the movie has bare young girl tit and all the girls are in skimpy clothing
Doubt people will listen
Hi
Heh. At least Biden seems to have a brain.
I believe Biden also reversed the trans military law which is nice. It was stupid trans people were not allowed.
~~literally just want to be myself~~
Yep
Just. Nothing.
imma go.
"trans girl singer does blah blah blah"
I guarantee if I get there and am talked about by media
I want to be a singer.
It just feels labelly I guess. Like for example
Get me?
I'm transitioning to be a girl.
And just saying. I'm not transitioning to be a trans girl.
I'm talking about just transitioning people. Non binary are valid.
Some people may not agree with me but I believe trans is a better term for when you are pre or mid transition and once you are done you just the girl or boy you always wanted to be
~~you literally have always been allowed to exist~~
Straight pride makes no sense.
You like what you like
That's one part definitely
Uhhhhh
I had a thought and it poofed
Honestly
Ohhh.
I'll try figure out the question
Heh
What's the question? I'm trans myself
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>

So what is the convo about. Oops
If my skimming through  is correct. You should make sure your broken bone gets checked out in case it gets worse. It'll also fucking hurt.
Ok,so. Mental health is really fucking important. Going somewhere for your depression is very important. Don't kill yourself. Loads of people care about you. A job is no almighty miracle cure. It shows independence and puts you in your feet with money. But that's it. Please try focus on treating your  depression as it not only makes everything else harder to go through and worsens performance. But is very bad itself. You are worth living.
***oh***

<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

The politicians who get paid by them

Better not
Perfect
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I mean friendly competition! Yay
~~hopefully it punctures and kills them~~
Well yeah
They are literally crying like babies on the news
But wall Street bets kicked the golden spoon out of wall street's mouth
Responding to this
You're an amazing person.
No you aren't.
Woah.
That time when I was twelve rings through my head
I slept without a quilt
Something similar happened last year
28 April birthday
I'm 15
I feel odd..I still feel confident and not worried but.. my eyes feel watery
I really don't wanna touch vomit
I'm half tempted to just music out the day and let my body force itself to sleep another time..
I wish so much
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499> <:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499> <:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
Childcare
Try and guess the job this woman wants
As well
I'm tempted to still tell the police
Also
Green card stuff
But
The evidence will definitely help
And like..
I'll be fine
As long as I can lift my own weight and be with iris in Minnesota
The reason with lawyer is this
So basically
Hello
Uh oh
Uh
i'd love for ya to send me some friend zenzen
Thanks aria
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
Anyways. Thanks for listening to me ramble y'all
I'm just glad I've music. It keeps me sane..
For the longest time I was like..what if this is all normal and I'm just being a baby
It's ok. I'm just glad I've people like yall to verify
yeeeeep..
Literally just now: 
Me to my dog:who's the bestest dog in the world 
Mom:and who's the bestest mother who gave her to you? I'm the best mother on the planet
When the dog was nowhere near her
If she does something she doesn't like while the dog barks she'll say the dog made her do it
She's mentally manipulative. Nothing physical. I've strong suspicions that's she's crazy. And she'll often take a Jab at me
Get me?
Luckily I have my plan to be with iris at 18. I just want to make sure I've my mind straight into facts.
Click the link at top not photo)
https://photos.app.goo.gl/oCUz44vFv6WLzBVRA 

These are audio recordings of my mom. I think she's one crazy but she's also mentally off..
So yesterday:
For breakfast I had only a  cup of shreddies and tuna 
I only got dinner at 6:20pm no lunch. 

There's two Sizzlers with burger buns. Or wings. The sizzler thing would be way more filling then the wings.
My mom argued her way into the wings.
As she didn't want to touch much packaging
Even though I didn't  eat  since 9 that day.
House problems:
The two bedroom doors don't close. I don't mean don't lock. You can't click them in over a year. The oven is broken for months. The lights been broken for months. The dog ripped a line in the carpet and didn't cut the excess off. And she blames me for it even though I didn't know she could



Am I making a deal of nothing...?
Also
Perfect fragile bubble
I'm cool with Catholics but Irish ones are a special breed of them
They really aren't
They pretend to be supportive but like
Wouldn't be surprised
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
And then memory fuzzy
Paused because I'm a smart cookie luckily
Checked my YouTube history
Grabbed my phone
And my aunt who was there at the time
My nan starts shouting
Next thing I know
Nothing explicit at all
I texted her a long message about my trans feelings
My mom was on holiday I was at my nans
It was early into me being out as trans
So basically
Welcome to r o i
Can I say it
This reminds me of another time
Shouts at me in the sitting room
My entire family
Never happened
He called me in and told me he'd tell CPS and investigate
The fights were too much. I told my SNA who told the principal
I can take a pic of the vomit if you want
My phone was fully turned off sadly.
Oki
Hm..
Can I text?
I know I'm making y'all feel stuck. I'm sorry.
I'm just scared of another when I was 12 situation
And the teacher and mom call a lot to see how I'm doing
The school website only has s message board
Don't have it
She keeps tabs
"what have you been saying to your iscoil teachers?",
Though it'll still be hard to sleep
My mattress is fine. So I'll put on my nightgown
Hmm idea
Awh..
That I'm not insane to think it
Verifying me
I think this is why..I'm crying. People are finally
Because I'd rather not hit vomit q.q
Imma listen to music and chat with y'all until my body goes dumb Stella dumb and forces sleep on me.
I think I know the plan for sleep
*hug*
I have iris. I feel stable enough..
Don't  know why I'm crying
I
Imagine all the people you thought cared about you all shout at you and get angry. Basically saying everything you've endured is s lie.
I only remember his first name as well
I don't
With his mates and new gf
Moved to Scotland
It's ok.
Dad left at 3
Nope
Like s bro or sis
"you won't be happy until I'm in jail"
And she found out
Because I also told an old friend about her
"oh you love getting me in trouble and spreading lies about me don't ya?"
But she keeps saying
Luckily I've deflected it a  lot
During the fights
Last lil thingy.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
And it looked way worse when she saw it.
I know she'd do it with any dog
But like
Pretty sure it dried in
Also
She can't help being sick
But she's perfect
Same dog she wanted to give away
And it seems to have dried in a decent bit
Luckily the dog is small
Especially them.
But having y'all. Is better then that.
I don't have blood family to listen to me
So much.
Thank y'all.
I just...
Yeah I figured.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
For like 3 mins
"DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY"
50 times
Or repeat the same word
Make demented singing
I've never controlled others
When I have anxiety
But like
She always blames anxiety
Hi.
Almost definitely
Like.. damn.
She yanked it from me
And didn't give it to her and tried to hang it myself
I got curious
She also forcibly hangs up the hand towel for me
Yeah..
Have touched a fridge in the last 8 months.
My age*
That other people may she
Something tells me
Idk
Like..
I can guarantee CPS isn't
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
As all this scares me a lot.
I'm tempted to just.. endurance test the rest
Thought it'd anonymous
My email should keep files safe
I know she doesn't check em. I'm fine
Like.
I've always lost track on what were talking about with tor and tracking
Thank you Lexi.
Discord and photos.
My phone and pc though
She doesn't check em
But she doesn't check. So I'm fine
Doesn't hide from provider
Doesn't check em.
I'll have it
If it's on a mega account she doesn't know the email or password to.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Thank you goose.
This. Makes sense.
Hey
I'm Stella Kohinata aren't I.
I'm always fine
 It's just about the rocky path.
I have it on photo archive. I'll probably move it to my new mega account.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
From her taking my phone.
Of losing y'all
And there's a massive chance
Just supposed trained people have failed me in the past
I understand
Thanks for yall's time. Sorry if I worried y'all. I'm sure I'll be fine. I always am right? Heh. But thanks. Y'all are like. No. Y'all are my family. It really means a lot to me.
Thank you armis.
And stopped talking about 2 weeks
He promised the sun
Buddy was said  a lot
"oh hey buddy"
When I had very brief new contact when I was 12
While he hasn't done what my mom has
Also
Yeah
Maybe that
Kieran
Idk if you spell it that way
Kyrean.
I still think endurance test but..
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Heh
Fresh ideas.
They asked questions and the way they talked was comforting
I chatted

I only went with discord browser and incognito
Oh Oki
To hers
Is connected
I'm 99% sure my sim
Tied to phone
But it's what's it called
I thought it was that
They have their own websites chat
You know Nintendo online
I don't think it's like
Shit.
Oh
Wait
O-ok..
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Why am I scared.
I know it's fucking anonymous
Why am I scared.
Won't move.
My fingers eontvmove
I'm
This is what I'm sending
This happened a few days ago:
For breakfast I had only a  cup of shreddies and tuna 
I only got dinner at 6:20pm no lunch. 

There's two Sizzlers with burger buns. Or wings. The sizzler thing would be way more filling then the wings.
My mom argued her way into the wings.
As she didn't want to touch much packaging
Even though I didn't  eat  since 9 that day.
House problems:
The two bedroom doors don't close. I don't mean don't lock. You can't click them in over a year. The oven is broken for months. The lights been broken for months. The dog ripped a line in the carpet and didn't cut the excess off. And she blames me for it even though I didn't know she could.

She constantly holds the time I got CPS and shouts at me.  
And well today. the dog vomited on my bed. She told me either sleep with it either or no quilt. She also called me an Asperger's freak and a trans freak. Which ngl. Hurt. She's gone covid crazy too. "DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY DRITY" saying that for like 3 mins and demented singing about... Jibberish I don't understand. She constantly asks what I talk to my teachers about and tells me not to bring anything up about family which has scared me a little. What do I do
Try write it up.
Imma go
hm..
Because my memories have gotten fuzzy about fights that's why I like venting to y'all
Anything else I bring up will probably be revised copy paste
Apart from this stuff as it's choppy
If I'm honest
Thanks y'all. And I do. Heh
Star
I'll be fine
I AM STELLA H KOHINATA
As long as I don't go
So
Anonymity is their selling point
From  what I can tell
I'd do it myself
Semi serious and putting it here incase I go on another ramble. 

Hhh..all I want is a bowl of fucking krave. It's 28 last 10am. She said she's having coffee first.
True true
***burger king Sus***
I know but like
This is a real tweet btw.
Explain
Burger king

I did crop
Fuck
Fuck you jpg
UHH
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
*hug*
Heh
I ramble don't I?
Of course
Because I don't wanna turn serious into general
I think that's all. Though I'd love to chat with y'all in general.
Hm..
Ooooo. How about karting AND pizza!
How are you
Hello Mel.
Though. I'll never forgive CPS
*hug*
They actually gave a fuck
They were like "how about this? Oh Ok makes sense. How does that feel?"
They DEFINITELY do more then CPS
Ooooo pepperoni!
I'll be your light instead of the vice versa!
When I live in America
And guess what
You are an amazing sis
Thank you Lexi.
They don't know my name name but yeah
Was remind me what my goal is. And to stay head strong
What it really did
But if I'm honest
They were really understanding
Thanks lex
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>

Heh
Ohai aria
These guys obviously care though
Same with CPS
They were such a stupid service
It wasn't like pieta house
I'm glad I talked too.
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
She always says when they go back
My mom must be high on something
On the clocks going back.
I meant GMT time specifically
I believe it's only around for schools and farmers.
It's not gonna be 11pm
If the sun has part the point you'd normally call 11pm
It's about relativity.
That's not the point
I always found it stupid.
When the clocks go back.
Not 12
It's 11 now
You know what
You can't just say
Is stupid
And GMT time
To me they were always gonna be needed in any somewhat unified world
What do you mean dark it's bright!
Oh it's 5am! So dark!
I Personally thought it just made more sense
Well I mean
Oh
You've cracked the case
Well ok mister chronologist (I know I'm just saying<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368> <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368> <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368> )
Like it's just as shit as last time but with spice
No I mean -
2021 has been feeling like 2020 the sequel
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
Maybe ww3 like was planned last time
I wonder what February is gonna do.
Jesus.
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Say it ain't so!
No way!
No!
You'd be surprised how good lawyers can be in a corrupt legal system all about money.
We are looking into everything
Minnesota is also. Luckily. Lax with immigrats.
We are trying to figure out s way to get s green card by running from abusive parent
But one her parents first impressions and two I..I love her too much to rush
That was the first plan
Well.
Better then here. And I'd be with iris and away from mom
I'm not even the biggest fan of America
She lives there
Minnesota with my girlfriend
I just want some KRAVE
Anyways
I guess these two years will be an endurance test.
I won't even be in the country by June 2023 if all goes to plan
My plan for when I'm 18.
What's a girl gotta do for some choccy cereal..

I'm guessing that's what the point was.
Ohhh
Then it's something else I'm confused on
Then it turned into shows
Same
That's good.
~~im so lost~~
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I vent but I always say if I seem burdening please tell me
Just don't be a terrible human being and you'll probably fit right in
What does dad and retweets have to do with watching a show
I'm very confused too

She barked once
It's a dog
Jesus Christ mom
"shut her up before I do it"
Last thing imma say
Sorry for my dumb butt. Imma go to general.
But I'm also dumb
Hell
And like
I still technically am
How much do you remember from secondary
Ikr
School is still important. But it should teach differently.
I think I've learnt more from late night YouTube then secondary
It's literally just work for well. Work.
I don't like one thing about school
I personally think it needs a redesign.
In fairness the irish Scot and UK one aren't that much better.
More projects instead of tedious work is definitely the right step
Though I'll say this
Every year they say they are trying one different then last year.
We've switched curriculum like 20 times
I'm in Ireland not England
Lemme look it up actually I don't wanna be dumb
1% eying me up tho
I'm 99% sure Ireland always has them.
Loris do you have core subjects in Scott
This is half off topic half on but. I did not like s.a.l.t in school for me. If anything it set my social skills back. When I actually looked at the world around me and myself I got way better. So even the places that do cater to us don't really at the same time.
I just want a school that tries to teach people like me too but doesn't baby us.
Makes sense.
You know. I like this conversation. Because it shows what opinions of mine actually work or not and challenges them.
That works
I hate that term but it makes sense why it's called that.
True
Nope
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
I would say something but having Asperger's kinda shows my brain doesn't work like the general public so
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
Basically we back to money being the problem
Places like iscoil are only online and very small. Not known to the general public
Maybe the true problem is this
Actually I just thought
A lot of people struggle in it. Some fare better then others but still.
Sounds like earth all right
I don't think you get what I mean
That does make sense.
Iscoil isn't perfect in any means. But it really helped. The point is. Traditional schools should also try cater to a wider subset of people
But in this format I actually learn.
I got to the point with traditional school I knew so little of the maths (I went out for a while and later completely because trans bullying) that I just hoped I wasn't called
You'd think they would
I wasn't saying it right at first but then I did
The stuff you actually learn in secondary is way harder to learn if you aren't the specific kind of kid traditional schools tailor to
That's not what I mean.
~~oh my fuckin-~~
That's the point. It only tailors to people who learn in a specific way.
And I understand instantly
Now I'm doing a different type of online school
I used to be terrible at area and perimeter
America:haha pew pew
Yeah..
So alls epic
I was about to say you can't just verbally assault someone but you edited
Heh
I didn't even think of that
OH I CAN SAY ANYTHING I WANT
But certain Americans think
Yep
Some people use it as an all glorious shield.
But that doesn't mean you should use  hate speech or any ism's
Free speech is good
When it comes to a certain amendment which I think is first
Something random but serious
Oof
Anyways hru loris?
That's more a covid thing
Some people just aren't good with words or writing
Oh definitely
In the last year or two
They have only recently started that here.
Definitely
Which my old one  is trying to do
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Guess who knocked these down. Told me to suck my own dick and banged her wrists together while sticking out her tongue
Oh damn..
Imma look that up
So what happened with protests
My dms are always open
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
So me venting straight away then ss'ing keeps them saved
It all becomes a blob I can't remember
I've fought so much with her
I did it because like
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
Discord screenshots of me talking about fights  are in the "me talking about my mother fights" folder
I'm collecting evidence in s mega account
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
Thank you aria
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
I shouldn't talk about every nitpick
I'm sorry.
Fuck I'm rambling again
Doesn't help that it's 19:26 and I don't have it yet..<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
So..
On their own
Only thing she added. Was chicken wings.
So I tried to get her to add loads of stuff and take others off
I realized a lot of it was my pickiness last week
yeeaaah.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
She also wouldn't add a chicken curry pie I saw. Or lasagna.
Welcome to my mom
But in similar fashion she's scared of salmonella
I asked for her to adds Kiev's to the shopping
yeah..
I'm getting two of the meat. 
None of the burger stuff.
So uh update
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Guess who's trying to not do dinner at all even though it's essential to being healthy
"how hungry are ya?" When  I said very hungry she seemed annoyed...
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I hate her
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Yeeaaah..
My mom just said I'm worse then a person that literally pulled a knife on his mom even though she was the one who shoved my games onto the ground.

True.
Hi cert <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Hi aria.
She's the one normal happy aunt in the family
The other has a house full. Different county. And I'd rather not bother her
One lives way too close to my mom
I only trust two people
That's the problem
But that wrists banging against each other surprised me
The sticking out tongue is childish but something I've heard of
Exactly what it says
Or live in hell
I either lose all the people I love for a chance of losing hell
Feel lost
I just.
Hi micha.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Thanks loris
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
Ever.
I never want to be like her.
She spews nonsense and does..that.
She has gotten to me so much it brings the true anger out.
But my mom
I try to be that
To everyone else
If I didn't she'd walk on me more then she does
I understand that. And thank you
I told her she's not allowed to touch my property
Oh yeah
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
Yeah..hope you're ok too

<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
So please trust me on this.
Instead of just barely not sad
Truly happy
I felt
I thought I didn't let it consume me before. But when I tried to reject and contract away from it. With friends with me
Listen close
Iris
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
No
So let me lend it
Stella Kohinata has enough energy for you too
You don't have to subject yourself to it anymore
Well iris
I'm a trauma syringed gal with protagonist energy
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
No buts
But now I'm challenging my sadness
I was super sad all the time
When I did
And I don't let you roll that way Either
Heh!
Not how I roll!
Iris
I listen to them all but hibiki works best
That's why I put on some hibiki
Sad music makes you sad
Ooo
Ost*
I forgot what op that is
Good!
Hehe
Ok?
If you ever feel sad. Put on symhpogear music and cuddle up next to me
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Because I'm here for you
Good
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
Do you believe your own girlfriends promise?
I promise
And that's going to blast past a year
I'm here for you my rainbow.
<:HibikiKiss:738240567049191505>
Self harm lank.
I won't allow you to give into them whether it's the last thing I do
No problem iris
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I'm here for you
A mild wound  turns bad if left untreated
And she won't allow you to do it!
Guess so yeah. Sorry melua.
But that gifts me the responsibility of bearing all the dreams I can. Heh!
That's why I shine the brightest in the world.
Stella Kohinata is built different
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Because it won't
Ya*
Even if it kills ys
Basically I'm a give it all you've got no matter what girl
By sprinter I mean I don't do endurance when I run for fun)
That's how I roll
I was a sprinter. But I always went as hard as I could for as long as I could. Until I was panting for breath on my name bathroom floor.
When I used to run
Fun fact
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
~~so cheery~~
Wat
<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
Tsunaida
Actually no that's xv
Ashita?
I'm built different
And that's fully serious!
You know. The only reason I fell down from my high at all was because of a traumatic episode. Guess I better just not!
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746> <a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746> <a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
I'm listening to Rikka ryouran
We're into different music heh
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063> <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063> <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I love you iris
Heh
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
I'll just have to shine so brightly the strength music gives me will wash over you!
It's settled then
hmph
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
If I listened to sad music when already sad. I'd hate myself.
I just.
~~im as stubborn as a mule~~
It's those words that make me burn longer!
I won't iris
I let music wash everything away
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Let music lift you out
But don't let music dampen it even more
You can realise you're sad. And that's ok. Crying is ok
It's the one thing keeping me up
And ngl I understand that if urban dictionary gave me the right answer
So uh apparently it's girls who love yaoi
I'm all ears if you say what's up
Fuck I'm still hungry.
6 minutes. Record
I'm back
Had lunch
Doesn't exist
So privacy
The two bedrooms
There*
She'd scream if their was
No dust
Two doors don't close. Carpet has a rip in it. Oven is broken
So uh
Yeah
1 minute spray of that and even I'm coughing
Because she's terrible with them
Get out
If you're allergic to cleaning products
I mean
Clean or functional
I'm figuratively fucked
If she doesn't.
I'm just hoping my aunt will side with me
I know.
How the hell am I gonna stay alive on 2
And I thought it was bad
4 patty's was the original thing she said
Like..
As this aunt is  normal and kind..
I'm considering telling my aunt about all this when I'm 16 and hoping she can either take me in or explain to another aunt
One I want out of
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I don't even get the fruit I like
Do potatoes count (which I don't get often but love)
The heaviest thing I can  lift is a 720p Samsung
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Not allowed em
But I love strawberrys and raspberries.
Nope
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
I only had crisps this time tho
Krave for breakfast. Sometimes.v
Ha..
Even though wings are in the freezer.
My lunch is going to be two burgers. No buns. just two small patty's.
Didn't want to vent about the food here today but. this is serious
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
"sis I'm a queen. Yaoi yaoi yaoi"
All of them seem to have the same toxic feeling energy
True
But yeah. Stans and those people can be gross
The person I brought up did. And was gross about it ~~pretty sure she wrote fan fiction~~
Obnoxiously loving it
Those people do be uncomfy
So yeah
When I was in school there was this one girl. And she was. The "BTS and yaoi lover but I'll step on you"
So many of us
I've Asperger's! <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Yep! A word used to hate on trans drag queens and femboys alike
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Meanwhile the word trap exists
Eyy
She looks exactly like a karen
This is too funny oml.
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
They obviously haven't seen 4chan
"your honour. This me me has gotten too far. It is not "lit" anymore."
I'm a trans gal but I'm an equalist
That pisses me off.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I forgot the Meaning of terf but I remember I don't like em
Why does this sentence make me laugh more then any meme possible
Ah
Oh. I thought it was just an "owo" meme
Take it down before a mod scolds you. For good reason mind you.
<@436547662280392705>
Read the channel name.
Iris
Bri'ish?
I'll see "trans singer Stella Kohinata"
I won't see Stellar Kohinata on articles.
Because I know. If my singer dream comes true.
I think it's media
Actually
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
But being called trans. It's like saying I'm a girl with an asterisk
When people call me a lesbian that's fine. Because well I do like girls. Plain and simple
I know a few trans people don't agree with me but imma shoot anyways
Makes sense
Honestly femboy just kinda  works likes a charm
That's not really the point. It can trigger people.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
~~also rude as hell~~
It's a part of the servers rules I believe, noi
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
They just like dresses my dude
When you think of ||traps|| you think of things that incase or trick you
Exactly.
Yep
Feminine boy right what it says on the tin
It's also not bad in any way
Definitely
Good idea
He just likes the clothes smh.
Never did know the name even though I watched it
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Look up blend s ||trap.||
Even though we just being ourselves out here
Word used against trans,drag queens,and femboys to basically call them a ||"trap"|| luring them in.
<a:MariaBlush:493803272360951808>
***don't do that to my heart***
Nevermind
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721> <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Front benches
But mom said it's my turn on the field.
More*
I should probably move to general since it's not serious but mor aspirational
It would
So it'd be close to brand too I suppose
My whole dream is based on letting everyone do their dreams.
That honestly made my heart thump a little.
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Don't they have an outrageous amount of funding
You'd think a giant vehicle that can wreck destruction would have that.
Jesus...
I know it's just kinda. Idk man. I don't trust people.
Still kinda scary
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>  why does that scare me
Still a massive vehicle but eh.
Who's ***we***
Ahh.
I guess I should leave any guns I get without a guard or lock because who's gonna steal it
Exactly
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
One aunt would understand slightly more
I wouldn't be sure on which to go to
Also
Yeah..I realized that when I couldn't eat but starving
But what on the 5% chance they believe her
I guess so
I..I..thank you zen.
Both have more then two kids so I'd burden
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
I do that live-in a different county
I'm Irish..so sadly I doubt
I just don't want to rope people in that aren't comfy with it.
Oh that's a thought
And I live in a village. I can't exactly just run it there.
Thus is my major problem so far
Basically the council gives jack shit.
It smelled like a cig factory
Oh god that first month
And the kitchen
In the grass
And foam swords
Cans
We still find bottles
The grass was super fucking tall. We had to cut it ourselves (around leg height)
Most of the problems are from neglect. But the house wasn't given in amazing shape.
Zen.
Some kind of unsafe to drink thing
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
But I can't exactly get one in a store
And I'm pretty sure the taps have a warning
No litre bottles.
Oh.. it's ok..
The body responds by diminishing that thirst signal to conserve energy, and then holds on to the limited reserves of water already in our body. In fact, studies have found this lack of thirst recognition actually increases as we age. If you can't or don't like to drink water, that's a symptom of a bigger issue.
Also something imma throw in. I hate water and when I ate that chicken last night. I couldn't eat any more. But I was starving..I felt ready to puke
The food stuff I guess I thought was normal but talking about all this when I was waiting for a while on night made me realize it's probably bad..
It's ok..
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
And childline doesn't allow me to send documents
I'm not allowed step outside the door. My mom is always like "why are you online? Who are you talking to? What did you say? Anything about me?"
I feel lost.
Yeah...
She was asleep. Beside  me.
She told the dog to stop barking and scratching the door
She kept begging for the tap to scald her and told it to fuck off
And yesterday when she was packing the shopping..she was crazy in my eyes
So basically my mom has been worse with food..I had two tins of tuna for breakfast. And at 4:30pm I had two processed spicy chicken for lunch. No dinner. I wasn't allowed drink  after 7 and I can't go to the bathroom without telling her because apparently soap droplet was on the dispenser
hi.
I feel like my body is good evidence at a 5'11 44 kilos. Heh.
Whatcha mean?
Aunts
They live right next to each other
Considering.
I've a picture of vomit. Picture of the games she threw on the ground. And s few audio files
Without my mother around
I need to be able to show evidence and explain
The problem is.
So no*
Well the county. I still have to walk up the hill. Big no Biggie
Hm..
But how.
We know.
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
So what...DO I do..
True.
Makes sense.
Online.
So if I can keep my knee up and running..I'd love to run again
Sketchy with timing.
The buses are very.
You know.
Thank you cert
 It's ok
Stupid fucker..
Why would you bank on someone being rich
Says imma be rich and built her a nice house.
Yet she still
So long time
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
I can't remember her working
Lemme think
She's hasn't worked in
****HA****
Search and rescues
Only one problem
I'd consider
So once my knee is back to normal
But I love running
I'm definitely not making this by walking
I mean if I'm still considering this stuff in a few months. Maybe
Hm?
Fuck I feel fucking lost...
But they are close. Still 15 mins.
I won't say our two county's
From here
Dublin would take 3 hours
Nope
And no money
With a mother that is always at home in the middle of a pandemic..
Still 15 minutes bus
I live in s village. In s county. That isn't even their county.
Still one problem
Absolutely no sus aunt first then other aunt?
The other is just the most simple but kind happy family.
As her kid has an abusive dad and they are in a court case
And fair  play. I am.
She said what else could she do I'm picky
So I called mom out on the food.
I woke up tired and cranky because dog.
So ahm
Ha.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Thank you lank and kerrik
Ah.
The same games she slammed onto  the floor
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Games
Your phone
Look at that pc
And I've done everything for you
I'm the best mother you could ask for
Is it common for them to say
Kerrik
Yeah..
The older I get the more I realize though
Well I guess I got so used to it I didn't question much
Oh
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
How else would I figure out my weight?
Thanks for caring btw
Without it
Because I wouldn't know my stupidly bad weight
Was a massive help
Ngl this surgery I had
Heh..
Thank you kerrik!
Thank you cert.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Sorry if I worried y'all..
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
That...makes a lot of sense.
Makes sense
I remember something from my past with her and just no.
I probably won't go to that aunt with the dad problem because
Also
I'm worried I'm making the small big..Is what she did bad..?
I'm just scared..
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Thank you all.. love y'all.
If you've any suggestions on them DM me
I guess I'll look into text child case firms
Hm..
I'll probably have to leave music on on my pc as I'm a pussy without music.
Do they've a text option?
How can I call without data with a mom that watches TV all day
Also. If my mom threatens to take my phone. Do I resist?
?
I don't know exactly what I'm..meant to do..my head really hurts..
She's threatening to move me out because I'm "dictating"
Mom said shes using a big towel so she'll hang it up. I said no as I'll be the one washing my hands and I'm almost 16
Oh my fucking god
The best
So ahm..thank you loris
~~Whenever I hear the word celtic I remember them dumbass colouring books~~
Closer then America anyways
We are practically neighbours
Popcorn chicken on it's own which I'll be getting in I'd say 30 mins. I hope
Also guess my lunch. It's processed. Only clue.
I'm tempted. I'll tell you if I ever feel like I need you to. Thank you
Feel like that'll be broken
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
She also forced me to promise I'll never tell a social worker anything again.
So idk man
I asked if she lives in the 60's and she said she wasn't lying
She says everyone eats spuds every single dinner. Which she doesn't give me but she used it as a point.
"you get fed better then anyone I know"
Oh definitely
Well ex bf
Yep.
Trying to say "well I'm not that"
And she compared me to the aunts problem
"you've the best mother you could ever ask for"
And the same ol 
"You're going to get rich and build me a house right? Or else I'll be living here forever"
Should I say the stuff I told you or wait till more happens
Oh definitely
But still fine chatting here
I just use my phone so much no one notices
I don't have notifications on for that exact reason
Yeah.
They said "you'd say you have the right to food and drink yes?"
I wasn't allowed show mega but I did talk about that to them yes.
I feel bad laying all these damn problems. Tell me if I ever vent too much.
So I haven't. Only discord.
I'm fucked
But the second mom finds out I told someone.
I do online school and can contact people.
I've a few audio recordings from my room though.
If I tried to do that my phone would be taken away
In a cllick
To full angry sentences completely normal
"HLEHEKELBKFNEFJENEBEBEBKVKBJFDJJD"
She went from
She pretended to go into a panic attack to call me out. And I know it's fake
But one thing peeves me
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Knocked em all down
Etc
Lamb
Curry pies
Chicken curry.
I recommended lasagna
Two
She's the adult
But one
I basically said fine fuck you. Going to my room.
She was very close to
Yeeeeaaah...
Especially when she knows she can hold it over my head as I don't want nan to feel worse.
I didn't know her. Just feel bad for nan
That's fucked up
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
Did you know nans aunt also died this morning
Now my mom threatened to tell my Nan the fights( in her own twisted fashion)
Ah..
Hopefully
A few years back
I think they did.
Didn't Hungary ban Minecraft for slaughtering pigs even though not everyone believes in the same religion
Ireland may be slow with stuff but I suddenly feel s lot cozier as a trans Irishwoman.
They better
Ahhh..
Didn't the EU state that Poland was violating human rights?
Ahh..
I feel bad for them
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
I still can't believe Poland has LGBT free zones
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Nordvpn
Bad
Anyways taking away free speech is always had
Oops
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
Taking away free speech
Why would you praise
What..
But she  hasn't done anything physical since.
I was in the bathroom. She  kneeled down. Grabbed my head. Started shaking it violently while screaming in my face
And I remember one time when I was 7
But I'm way taller.
She has stood right up next to me trying to intimidate me to
Though
Even though she asked if I wanted to
She basically went "but I'm an amazing mother why would you say that!?"
Figuratively
How is it dictating.
I went along with it before and she slapped it in my face
It*
She obviously doesn't mean if
<a:illyaHuh:707270904295456768>
I've heard of the first and last
Yeeeep.
Guessed. Ireland is similar and has so many trans problems
Everything about this. Makes me wonder what went wrong with the world
Hopefully
Religion is fine. Just allow people to develop their own opinions and don't push it on anyone.
The main issue is. parents can still enforce a specific religion in a home. No matter if churches turn an adult only thing.
Imma just drop a nugget of Stella opinion. 
Idc what your religion is. And if other people join it that's good. 
Just don't try show me the wonders of Jesus.
Tldr;just believe in what you believe and don't force others to join
Oh.
Hello kerrik
That's very true yeah.
He can't fully call the shots anymore. Just influence them.
Still
At least the only power that he has is name and money,not president anymore.
Hopefully..
So trump is getting away Scot free. typical.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
It feels like she's asking for a pat on the back..
I just want to eat the trash popcorn chicken I have for dinner please fuck off mom.
hhh..
"Look at everything I've bought for you last year. Getting you into iscoil." Etc
Let's pray
British and Irish things are often similar
Not since December 25
True.
I believe I can make an account at this age even.
How do I make sure it's in an account owned by me
It's all for when I leave
That's why I said I'm not giving a cent to her
I know
She hasn't worked in..I can't remember when she worked <:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
Definitely
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
She gets welfare and child support from government. She wants for me to buy my clothes out of the autism money I'm getting when I'm 16 this year. And I'd rather not committ fraud
It was thanks to knee surgery I know
I did the measurement date at the day I learnt my weight as that was closer to when I learnt I was 5'11

I think it was a 13 but imma redo it
They don't know veg thing
I told them how late the food was and the tuna thing.
Oh
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
Is that really that surprising? Shit..
True.
That would be very good to show how life is rn..
I wish I could show them audio but I can't.
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Judging by the fact mom was notified about an investigation when I was 12 and it didn't even fucking happen -
Else everything will be taken from me and I'll be shouted at.
I can't allow em to be slow.
Yep. That's the point
But CPS in Ireland isn't exactly the pinnacle of help.
I know.
It wasn't a hit. I was 7 she grabbed my head. Shaking it violently and shouted loud.
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
R.o.i CPS probably won't do jack with me being 16 in April and no physical abuse.
True.
Said It yesterday.
She keeps saying you're going to get me in prison aren't ya. And calls me dangerous.
She's "dodo dodoododod dododod"ing in the bathroom and it's creepy
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750> maybe
I honestly didn't know that was too odd till now heh
So ahm..I've had popcorn chicken for lunch. Dinner. And soon to be this breakfast. It's 11:12 and she's only just putting it on now.
Hi.
No no.
Try and guess the last time I've tried to drink water.
Fuck imma be thirsty.
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
Even though there is.
When I told her that she said no stores are open
She won't go to the shop and get a simple jug of milk. Said no money but she could easily take off one of the crappy foods from the shopping
Because of trauma/not getting enough water when I'm young I've grown to absolutely despise water.
I had one cup of tea. And there's no drinks other then water
feck I'm not gonna enjoy  today
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
I can't remember what she said in it tbh.
https://mega.nz/folder/RAAVhQaB#PEANzgAdGvuMaTR0rzjWHA

I recorded a long one yesterday. My phone camera was up but all you can see is the carpet and doorway.
Well yeah but I don't exactly agree with it either do I.
True
Why are you even listening
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
Which caught me by surprise
And today she's saying that I'm peeing not enough
She called me a dictator.
A week ago I said to my mom only eating pasta is terrible for you.
I think this was a spite attempt
Also uh
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Feck it all..
Heh..
My mom would be worse.
But ngl if I didn't get out of the house and he said someone.
Problem is I only remember his first name
Prob not
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
A parent who left me at 3 and is in Scotland
Normal welfare and child support
It's things like this that make me second guess and I hate it
Not diagnosed for anything but I'd be surprised if she didn't have something
I just don't want it to backfire..
CPS in Ireland doesn't give 10 shits unless your arm looks like it's snapped in half
But
Yes
Here's the thing
At least with that picture mom can't say I was lying about it.
Back to  my room
Snuck phone in
Already had 3 

Ate:11:50
Brb shit breakfast time I'll start talking after I'm done!
For shopping
Couldn't.
Covid crazy. I asked to join her to the local shop
I really don't.
Mom came in here saying she loves me And I deserve the best and asked if I loved her <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
That'll be a horrible experience. At least I got it down ig..
Yuck..
That water was gross..
God it's been so long since I've made tea myself..
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Tasted gross.
I've had tea with sugar that isn't dissolved
This is probably because of how I am with water. It's a hell Ton of milk
The sugar wouldn't dissolve into the water
I also take a hell Ton of milk with my tea and Coco or I hate it
It wouldn't dissolve tho
I've no fear of water.
When I came in to tell her I'll try water she told me she added more fanta to the shopping which I guess is better then nothing.
I'm..going to try a glass of water I can't stand being this thirsty.
Like she did with the other food.
I feel like she'll say that I won't drink it and just won't get it.
So basically I should like water or not mind it if I actually got the amount I needed when younger.
It's basically a sign of dehydration and points to bigger issues
Lemme find the thing I read
But I'm not allergic
I absolutely hate it
Eh
I mean.
yeah...
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
So I'm not eating till dinner.
She said that counted as my lunch. At 11:50.
oh my FUCKIN-
I think this happened yesterday too but thirsty isn't helping
Removed word doc too.
Moved to doc
Incognito is my bestie
True.
Oh fucking god why do I want to puke I barely ate anything..
I named it Pokémon so it isn't suspicious because I need to regularly add
I'll have to endure for at least a month for this to be worth it.
I'll start from today onwards .
I'll just use word
Tried didn't allow
Do I just rename the file?
Idk where tho
True..
In mega
When I send a image of food it'll say time and date for me
I don't need to dot down times
Also
I am dw.
Nope!
What though..
My brain go poof
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
Exactly.
4 to 12
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I'm already thirsty and it's not even 12
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
I'll try.
Maybe for the shopping though
She'd have to go to the shops. So can't do that today at least..
I live off tea Coco and milk.
But it's been at least a year and I didn't have much.
I always just thought I was odd
But there's common psychology between not liking water  and trauma I found out.
https://mega.nz/folder/RAAVhQaB#PEANzgAdGvuMaTR0rzjWHA
I'm way more comfy with my own voice now because I got compliments on it and apparently one likes my accent so I'm less subconscious
Also uhhh
Can't remember the name
There used to be this sugary fruit tasting drink but it was mostly water
But I know I like flavoured
I've tried bottled didn't like it
Never tried <@430379754190012426>
True!
The most I've had in 6 years I'd imagine
Those small ones
I had two Chinese cups and a half full of water.
But at least
I may not have enjoyed it
Also
Smushed it  in good but gross

EWWWW. my fucking mother.


The dog vomited
My mom came in and smudged it into the carpet until she couldn't see it. Not even socks on .what the fuck. That was disgusting.
Makes sense
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Why did I feel deja vu
I checked you didn't.
Damn
Didn't we have this exact convo weeks ago
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
I feel deja vu
Wait
I hope it is..
True..
I wonder if I collect more of them kind of evidence could I make a good court case..
Shite.

But I've to prove I can care for myself
Emancipated basically cuts all those corners and makes you pseudo-18(my words)
I think my maturity and how bad my mom is,is obvious.
I wonder if I'd be able to go for that when I'm 16
A friend told me about Emancipated
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
Damn
It actually means propaganda
What was second?
Jesus.
Ahhh..
What's that
Ahm..I think you'd be the smartest as you're the closest to Ireland.
I only wanna show one person as I'm embarrassed with my voice
It's important
And y'all are gonna hear a voice I'd rather you not but
I'm slightly more depressed
Well boyos
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
"Go and hold onto that dick of yours,be fucked"
And I quote
Mom threatened to jump off the bridge.
When I have the money I have to  be the one supplying the dog toys. She told me to
Idk why we have em.
It was only a Chinese cup full tho
Sadly yeah
And when people don't understand something they don't try look into why it happened so fast they just say "BLEH MUST BE BAD"
I think that's because it's came out a lot faster then most vaccines and I think one of the covid vaccines is a different method?
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Feck
I hope Ireland is counted into the UK because that seems to be a good amount
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Sorry.
Still hope they won't slow us.
Fair enough lol
Hopefully anti vaxxers won't slow the process of going back to semi normal.
Was it good or bad
Also I looked up wage "a fixed daily or weekly payment typically for work or services"
Had a feeling
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
Isn't it illegal to not support your kid before 18
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Apparently my mother and the family think that because I'm getting a wage (autism money which I want to save up for trans (and for traveling to America and living there but she doesn't know that) I should pay rent and  buy my clothes with it
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
Didn't get a chance to record
My dog pissed where the carpet rip in my room is and when my mom asked why the fuck did you allow that (even though she just jumped off my bed) I tried to explain and she started screaming over me.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
The two MP3 files are actual fights and way more crystal clear
Soap matters more.
Basically who the fuck cares if I'm thirsty as hell for a day
I got drinks before shopping.
But because she ran out of soap
We had shopping today
Yesterday I didn't have drinks as you know.
Fun fact
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
"don't even try to fight [name I don't like]"
Asked if I could do it.
Even though she wiped the shopping.
Mom doesn't want to wash her hands to make me a drink
For example I'm thirsty
They really do.
It feels fake..like she's trying something..
Is when she says she loves me.
The part I hate the most about her.
Want to know the funniest part.
Now that  I think about it I haven't no.
December 25-27
Uh...
I haven't been outside since...
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Even though it's processed
And I have to cut open processed spicy chicken to make sure it isn't raw
When I'm talking about fights to her she goes "shhh do you want the neighbours to hear you?"
She wants higher fencing so people can't look in the windows.
She's paranoid as fuck
That
You know the smell of cleaning powder that hasn't dissolved because too much?
I had to sniff oven mitts and a hand towel to see if she cleaned them..she asked that of me. And holy fuck they are pungent with the smell of clean. Bleh.
Covid crazy I say
Wish I knew
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
She blames the soap
No wonder her hands have marks from washing..
For 5 minutes..
She washes her hands
As she admitted it.
Just realized this now.
Let's judge people as individuals instead of pushing agendas
"yeah I don't like you"
It's literally roping all men and saying
I mean..
Hi Pika.
Yeah...
Money truly does make the world go round.
Wouldn't be surprised.
We didn't get fucking debt
In Ireland I've seen free stuff given from the canteen in school before
People are happy about it. Like yeah. I'm glad he was able to do a good thing
 BUT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO
A fucking thing.
But why the fuck is lunch debt
Now I'm just some irish lass.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/02/04/us/boy-pays-off-lunch-debt-trnd/index.html
Damn
What did he do?
Big words
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Jesus..I hate how I can see it.
Maybe ask why they fucking had to
If someone overcomes a problem
Yep..
<:HibikiAngry:688429716096548892>
Who cares if little Timmy doesn't have the 2 euro. Give him the fucking lunchable
Exactly.
America really preparing kids for college aren't they
The kid looks like..8.
The world truly is fecked.
Glad he's dead after reading that.
Wow.
.
For example?
gtg
" The guidelines additionally allow for deportation of those who are deemed a national security threat due to terrorism or espionage concerns or who illegally crossed a U.S. border after Nov. 1 of last year."
So no. Though I haven't read much of it yet.
Restrictions.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/policy/national-security/539436-biden-team-unveils-new-ice-deportation-measures%3famp
Imma just slide this in
Yeah
I'd presume it's a GameStop situation. certain amount of customers a day or week to hit your quota
Ah..so basically they were just one of *those* fans
What has this axia done?
Whatever you need to stay yourself. Politics is important. But it shouldn't be half of you.
He said it would be too much of a political  hassle basically
He did say "FREE AMERICA NOW" for virus so I see it.
Ohhhhhhhhhhh.
I don't know what a chode is
But this is good progress at least!
Even Elon musk. The richest man in the world who you'd think would be stingy. Wants a carbon tax and said he'd pay any tax given to him. But biden  said no. Guess we gonna be warming the ball
Nice!
A lot of news sites aren't reliable these days tbf.
Like..surely they'd look for chess keywords too just in case it's to do with a very well known board game
ikr
Do y'all think that's kinda a douche move and shows toxicity or that just me
In NI there's a day. I can't remember when. Where they burn Irish flags.
Random thought In my mind
He looks so sweet.
Exactly.
Like Jesus man. The boy only wants a milkbone
True that.
And a dog's a dog. They eat trash cans.
Guys. Why is this even a news article. This is stupid.
https://www.businessinsider.com/newsmax-guest-bidens-dog-dirty-and-unlike-a-presidential-dog-2021-2
What's yalls opinion on the death penalty.
Btw
No one is well off. But it's well known if you've anything to do with women or kids you're going to have an asshole 5 times larger when you're out.
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Ahhh..
Isn't Epstein the rape guy?
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Yeesh..
Making basic decency a skin colour issue is the opposite of basic decency
You're surrounded by loved ones.
People care aria.
Exactly
Because I believe in you.
Know you won't do it.
So don't do it.
You underestimate my thunder. It's contagious.
<a:MariaSlap:656169631526158349>
So don't talk that way.
And are many others.
As you are my good friend.
I Stella Kohinata will be selfish and not allow you to kill yourself.
aria.
I'm a selfish person in some ways.
I wouldn't be happy if I knew I left my Iris behind for a copy.
Heh
And cherish.
But I have found people I love.
Aria I understand that
Yeah.
I would never dw.
This is confusing stuff
Just I'd never know.
I could die in this world
So technically
Not body
You said soul
<@436547662280392705>
For like 9 months..
The oven is broken
This is what I got yesterday
https://shop.supervalu.ie/shopping/product/1727198000


https://shop.supervalu.ie/shopping/frozen-foods-null-chicago-town-deep-dish-pepperoni-pizza-2-pack/p-1042845001


And Weetabix
I'll show it actually
Is this ok?
So every shopping day lunch is late. And sometimes I only have two meals..

Today I had wheetabix at 8. the shopping won't be here till 4

Cooking + cleaning means another day of lunch at 5-6
I felt like bringing this up as idk if it's acceptable or not.
Sleep well.
Thank you certified and loris
I'm debating telling an aunt. I just hope she's as good as I think
I've transcribed most of the SS into note form for mega.
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
I don't understand life anymore.
She  said "you need to stop telling your devious little lies"
I didn't think a tracksuit was mine. I thought it was my mom's..
So ahm..
That's why they have long term affects.
Vaccines are basically to make anti bodies.
It'd be a stupid endeavour
With how the body works I'm almost certain there's nothing they could do that would stop your heart that wouldn't either automatically trigger/burn up in a few days
My pal bill gates really out here trying to commit genocide
~~yummy data~~
***we all know why social media is free***
There's absolutely no gain they can get by somehow tabbing vaccines.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Government already knows everything they want
You have a phone. Number tied to you(social security number)
GPS on said phone. multiple social media most likely with your face and what you've done on it. and countless medical records and paychecks
That last part.
So maybe add tiny drops of selfishness in your normal self?
I decided to lift both me and them as a compromise.
I hated when others did it as I couldn't take them well.
I used to have a problem complimenting myself.
Imma throw these two cents.
Hm
Don't spite yourself out of existence. We care for you.
I care for my friends. Including you.
Simple as that.
Aria. You aren't dying on my watch.
I'm back.
They never did it.
I asked for help at 12. CPS said they'd investigate. To mom's face
I just don't know if I should endure these two years or tell someone.
Thanks y'all.
1st percentile I know.
I'm guessing my weight isn't good.
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
I'll be careful
I'm 44 kilos at 5'11 so uh
I didn't mean to be rude sorry.
Going from an abusive home to a country with the worst obesity rate will probably help
Iris said she'll make sure to help me but slowly so that I don't vomit.
So that it can ration.
That makes sense..
Shouldn't I want to shovel it in?..
I don't get it.
Why was it hard to stuff the last three slices down.
I haven't eaten since 8 so
I just had lunch. Or I guess dinner
So ahm
No no it's..ok. I swear.
She usually gets 1 bowl full of pouches a day.
She's only allowed outside for like 4 minute bathroom breaks.
Neighbours complained once about the dog
Fun fact
It's 5pm ffs..
"now you'll be having a handy dinner this evening"
"But I didn't have lunch"
"That's not my fault"
Damn.
25 mins
That was
She's changing pillow stuff now
But apparently it's meant to be one so mom changed it to one at night.
It used to get two dog bowls a day
And I'm not allowed touch cupboards for cleaning stuff
Doubt mom will do anything about it for 30 mins
Dog vomited on pillow and mattress cover
OH FOR FUCK SAKE
Thank you pika
This microwavable one doesn't.
But at least it'd have the calories
A full pizza isn't good for me
Hell
Not when it's your main appliance
That's what we are living off
Air fryer
Even that debunks them.
For people who believe so much of it comes down to that stuff
Basically what I'm saying is Mel
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
All I know Is. I'm a girl and that's that.
I just said it reinforces.
I didn't say you need it.
Oh my god. mel
So many people try to debunk trans when there's literally evidence of people having brains physically shaped like their true identifying gender
That reminds me of something interesting
Guess so
As in seperate gender altogether
I just hope no one thinks trans is a gender
But come on. 
Male
Female. 
Non-binary.
Now, I'm a trans lesbian weeb who has literally chosen her name from anime
Idk what to do though. My mom refuses to think I'm underfed
Doesn't explain the food or ***constant paranoia***
Maybe..
Bipolar personality disorder?
And it fucks with my brain
***then she starts again***
Oh. Was I wrong?
And I'm like
Because one minute she's happy and chirpy. Randomly hugging me.
She confuses me
It's my mind
But I can ignore the hunger and get back to normal
Bad yeah
The food
I'll say this
Yeeeeeeep.
"I can't help that"
Didn't work
I tried to tell her the food I'm getting isn't enough and that skipping lunch is bad.
With no audio evidence. And said nothing about food.
I keep fighting with mom. I'm scared. Please don't tell her I told you I know she'll shout at me.
Back then all I said was
In fairness
You just look like a bigger fool if you don't own up
This body has Asperger's. We'd rather own up to stuff.
Sounds good. Thanks for caring about her.
I just feel really bad for Stella.
I'm fine myself. Just kinda like "uhhhhh"
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
How does a dog bully someone
Jeez.
"I wish you were never born"

Tried to push me forward. Didn't retaliate.

Brought the dog in with a biscket then put it back in the jar and said "  come in you. I'm not letting anyone bully me anymore." 
Calling me a brat and bastard. 

And got defensive when I asked why she makes sure to put make up in when going to fucking Lidl.
I know her mom is bad but like..
I mean American schools. I've  seen how weird they are about it
Because then teachers have to be adults and say the scary sex word and actually teach people
That...was not a nice read at all.
oh
True
Uh oh.
https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2021/0225/1199363-esri-on-electricity-costs/
Other people are mean
So basically
Legality yes. Socially no
Uh kerrik I'm guessing wrong reply
Stereotypes are outdated junk
They came to our school for one day to teach us about it
There was an LGBT professional in our school.. yeeeeaaah mockery everywhere.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I found this but I don't know which country <:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206> 


 All children under the age of 18 have the same rights with respect to owning property. ... But assuming that a minor came into the possession of the item without having entered into a contract, as is the case with most purchases and gifts, parents have no ownership rights over the property of children.
Then eat some chocolate and go to bed.
As long as you feel good enough there isn't a huge problem.
Especially during covid times,you can't expect to be doing much.
It seems the reason you hate life is because you expect every day to be the page of a best seller.
look. Don't drop them. Wanting to make more isn't a reason to abandon others. - some weird co front mix of hibiki and carol.
Anything but that.
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
You'd be a cutie tho..
Sorry switch happened. Stella here.
Map = pedo
So from my understanding at least
MAP is literally just pedos trying to give themselves a less controversial name which is wrong
Well I mean.
I didn't look into the wording very hard
My brain doesn't work often sorry
***ohhhh***
Hm?
Or as I call them. Pedos
And as far as I know twitter has a massive MAP problem
***or attraction towards minors***
So you can literally say oh yeah I like em and twitter's like "good for you champ"
Twitter's TOS^

What.
Excuse me
Her mom just put a cloth to my forehead to see if it was wet..she then put it to her own face to check..and now she's saying "if I die I die." Because she thinks there's salmonella on it because she cooked chicken wings 3 days ago..
And a memory:
There have been times where her nan was like  "if you'd like I could drop you into town" she chooses bus as she's slightly better with it. But not the best. Even though the bus is 20 minutes+ late so often and the bus actually costs money..
Dogs 
Salmonella.
Covid 
Being talked about 
Buses/cars...
And rats are her fears..
Imma*
Kmma see what you all  make of this
Hey uh..
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
"do what you want" 

backlash and presumably a spike
"HOW COULD THEY ALLOW THIS"
Sorry. We fell asleep.. barely slept. I'd say that but like..the dog ...bus car..that's random.
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Ah,I've seen this before. listen man. Obviously you do both! Get some friends that understand your interests but also some that show the other side of the fence! That way you can express yourself but see new things
Jesus..I hope he lost his job
https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40238867.html
Why is it even banned.
But..why?
<:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
This system is trans and lesbian so we aren't exactly fond of her
Basically yeah
Jk Rowling is uh...not exactly LGBTQ loving.
Fair enough
So  many "great works" when I literally just copy pasted the question into Google
I can guarantee our school doesn't have it
I'm pretty sure you'd be losing money that way.
Just he couldn't even shut his lip..
Didn't say I was surprised
Of course...lovely..just what we need in 2021.
https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/vatican-snubs-gay-union-blessings-because-god-cannot-bless-sin-1.4510957
Yeah. I stopped. Just the last time we checked..
One look at the sky comment section tells me this is impossible
I mean I wouldn't be too surprised
Very true
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Yeah
I think we don't wanna know as that'd mean another war
My phone has a password she doesn't know.
Oh god..
She'll want to check my phone...
Why now of all times..
Someone must have hacked my mom's account..60 euro play store went out of her account..
Oh god oh god oh god..
When you're 21 you can't just hide behind the fact it's disability money so why now
Basically saying
My mom and nan expect me to use that for rent.
I've aspergers and will most likely get disability money in April
That's wrong for her to say..right..?
Yeah..
"even your nan said you should give rent with your disability money. There you go." 

Then jearily said
"Oh I'm 21 but this is disability money you can't take it from me!"
So uh..
**wow**
My brain hurts..
"You're a three  year old" something she says daily 
"Stop calling me that"
"Stop acting like one"
Jeez..
I knew that gift voucher she got me yesterday was a tool...
"Gift vouchers games holidays (hotel in a different county) yet you treat me like shit"
Thank you solo
Thank you Rad..
And thanks for caring.
Y'all who've seen the audio.. do you think CPS would worry about it..?
"who have you been talking to,to have  that opinion of me?"
Also she said this recently
She's threatened suicide on it a lot saying "I won't be able to do my dream job!"
Guess so yeah..
If I don't talk for a couple days y'all know why. Hopefully it doesn't come to that.
I hope the audio evidence will sway them enough..
And she's so sickly sweet to Everyone else..
I can expect so much shouting.. suicide threats..her telling the family who'll get onto me.. confiscation..
The real fright is the first day
I..
Things are getting very fucking real..
I'm shitting myself..
I told  her to send it..
Oh god.
But I'm scared.
And she'll send it.
Is say the word
All I have to do
I'm most likely going to have a referral (with help from someone in the field) sent to Irish CPS. To hopefully get me in a foster home. My stomach feels like an empty pit. I feel scared..I know my mom is going to flip the lid once she finds out..
Hey.
Draco salmon..
Why are people changing their names for a damn meal..
https://www.rte.ie/news/newslens/2021/0318/1204672-taiwan-names-salmon/
She's going for a walk to clear her thoughts...it's 23:33...
I don't even know how long I'll have my phone..
I am going to hate Irish CPS..
Not even an investigation..
Even with 4gb of audio.
Again.
If they did it ...a
...I swear..
Childline is the closest..
?
I got no chance..
How bad she was being..
I tried to tell them I couldn't take the fights anymore
I went to them and talked to mom
Oh god..
"we just came to check up on Stella. We see everything is fine. Nothing will come of this. Not even tulsa"
They came..
..
I want to curl up and die..
..
Guards are here already.

"Go away from me you reject"
Also
Mom has a big double bed..of course..
I don't even have a blanket..
Sadly the dog vomited on my bed again..
Thank you lanky that means a lot..
Can't believe a guy like that was the person in charge of my diagnosis..
I got the diagnosis after
"are you sure you're not gay and using trans to hide it?"

"I'm lesbian"
"Oh"
This makes me remember
Holy hell..
26..
Sorry
Can yall sort by newest and listen to the newest one? I wanna know if she's being bad
Hey uhm..
Yeah
Yeah
My heart won't stop pounding I'm shitting myself..
She's going to bed soon weirdly so should be all good.
?
"I'm gonna go over the bridge with you accusing me over stuff" I'm hiding in the bathroom rn..
Our accounts aren't Linked
Also
She's already doing that.
And we got 4gb of it
I think it's the only weapon I really have..
Most likely nothing would have happened..
If I didn't do these recordings..
I just realized
I changed my pin to a password
" It's been attached to your case file. They will look at that on Monday." 
About the mega folder...and that had a LOT of info..so they can still be swayed if they aren't already..
Also
I can do fingerprint but it sucks butt and you still need password
I hope so..
I wonder if I can strengthen my overall phone too..
I'm so so glad I changed all my passwords..
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Please hug me I feel post shock weirdness..
Yeah..
Ngl..all that did was terrify me..
" It means that they haven't dropped your case. I suspect that they wanted to check up on you in the short term, and they said that there would be no investigation to try and make it so there was less impact on you. "
"Okay, I've just recieved a call and been told that the social workers have passed the information on to the day team, who will come in on Monday to investigate " - nice social worker friend
So uhm
So yeah..
She agreed I should give mom rent money out of my disability money. At 16
..eh..
She didn't try call again phew
Way too scared.
Im too scared.
It's late and mom finally went to beds.
Luckily the phone is on silent.
Oh god nan is calling.. I'm ignoring the call.
I'm really scared..I just wanna live somewhere else
Child abuse is tho..
So she wasn't impressed by it ig..
She's sending in a formal complaint about how it was handled.
I talked with the person who knows a lot about this stuff
I guess...
They said nothing will come of this..
Gardais words
I dunno what to do..
So basically I..
And I told authorities again..
Now the mom knows I have contact with either the dad or someone else.
-1
My heart hurts..
They said nothing is coming from it..
I'm so tired of all this..
These mind games make me want to puke.
She didn't trust lasagna in air fryer. Guess what I just had for dinner...she's doing everything to be sweet..
Also 
"it was never my intention to hurt you and now I'm really suffering."
<:MayaSip:520948833153318912>
It's called the news wanting clicks.
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Today is poop..
The  mom just said "you don't have to hide who you're talking to. I don't want anything to do with you"
So at first I was happy but cautious..
I was allowed put the milk in my tea (from a jug not carton) and butter my toast (wasn't allowed get bread myself) but of course then she says "am I **allowed** put the water in your tea?" ..I knew it was all fake..
Oh god she's back..me scared..
I'm*
Though. Touchwood.. she hasn't asked for my phone yet..if she does in just going to say no. I have a password. So it's not like she can get in.
She keeps asking me how long..
Yeah
It's not my dad. Social worker friend from discord.. but still..
She said she never stopped me. Then said that..
"I didn't know you were talking to your daddy behind my back"

My heart hurts..
"so how long have you been talking to your daddy for?"
She thought that instead of discord friend so I just  went with it. 
"I'm not disclosing anything to you I don't want to talk to you" 
Repeats line 1 multiple times 
"You know I'd do anything for you and I love you to bits" 

I hate this.
Imma try sleep
Stayed outside.
They didn't go inside.
And lemme think of a hiding spot
So uhm..do you think everything is going well....? Will the audio clips sway  them...?
Where should I put my phone..
But when I wake up the phone might be taken and and more fights..
So uhm..that'll be hard
I don't even have blankie and I'm terrified still..
It's uhm..kinda hard to breathe..
(We have no idea how this works)
We'd crap ourselves if we had to suddenly be in a copcar..
I hope the removal won't be too scary.
Thank you Alexis.
Yeah..
Goodness sake...why do I feel like I'm a terrible person.
I believe cavachons can be like that though.
She's been given out to but apart from that..
In fairness any owner is better then her..
It's just empty threats. But the mom wants to give her away. So the second I'm gone she'll probably be at a rescue..
And it's all in the process now anyways.
But I guess it's what has to happen if I want to be any way sane.
The dog gets bad...bad.. seperation anxiety.
I know I just feel guilty is all..
The chances of the dog being able to come with me are like 2%.
Basically you don't  have to tattle on yourself
I feel guilty. I love this dog. She's beautiful. Yet I probably won't see her after this week coming..
Also
I keep telling her I won't tell you as you're playing this like cards.
She's asking if it's my dad or iscoil teacher
That's kinda my attitude right now
Hope so.
They will only ask about that.
They know about the situation.
Well my mom has ruined the family image with what she's spilled..
And we're already phone shy.
Since December.
In..
Apart from her.
I haven't..talked to someone face to face
Let's just hope this time it'll be swift and easy..
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
You guys help a lot. You really Do.
Every 20 mins.
Yet she keeps asking
She keeps getting extremely antsy about it. And feels that if I told a teacher that it's a guaranteed over for her. 

**I told a social worker through discord I can not allow her to learn that**
We are sure. It's just when your biological parent. Even when I don't see her as *my* parent. It does things to the brain to try and rationalize her.
That's true..
I think it's more "what if we miscalculated and she's actually good"
Her words
"I just want to let you know. That I love you. Just in case the worst happens.". (me being taken) 
I hate how I feel fucking guilt..
That sounds right.
As she believes I told a teacher about the things she said. And she went bright red and worried.
She seems at least somewhat self aware
That reminds me
So bag is allowed probably.
" I dont see why not! "
I hope the mom doesn't..make a scene. Though with the circumstances even I can't blame her.
Very true.
I guess the only impossible things would be the dog and the PC..
So plan if I can is:
Phone in pocket 
Terrible headphones around neck 
And my Vita with its only game. MC
And my 3ds with a few carts probably in my pocket.
It's the only game from the  childhood we still  have.
I want to bring a Pokémon Y cart.
This'll sound weird but.
Actually.
Don't think about clothes. But think about if you've a keepsake you'd be upset to lose
So from what I can tell from what she said
If I asked them while being removed I'd look like I'm not taking it seriously..
What happens to my belongings
And this sounds selfish but..
I hope me being removed won't be too jarring. As I said before..
But speaking is a large part yes.
But I luckily caught myself.
I've almost corrected her mom on my name.
Hm..
Also there's a good chance I'll be in a completely different county as I said I wasn't opposed
Though I guess they could just loop it in as a "Asperger's thing"
But still it shows. Just people don't know what it is.
Probably yes.
People who say sup probably don't say goodness sake.
Vocabulary.
Yeah.
No correlation. But accepting of different types of people.
That's very true.
Yeah
But at least with plurality I don't need to worry about hormones
They do know that. Not of Plurality though.
**yeeeaaah**
I don't have hormones yet. So if they are phobic.
If I somehow land in a transphobic household..
I hope the foster people will be nice.
In fairness.. at least I'll probably be able to eat from an oven..
Damn..
Well. Yeah.
This.
Where will I be..?
There's no way I'm going to be fostered straight away so like
Like..
Yeah.
That's very true.
She made herself to be a victim..
True.
It seems like she was..
From what she's told me of her past life. However true.
Fair enough. Just whenever I'm around cops I suddenly feel like I've been a local dealer for 25 years. If you get me
She's now going on about how she's the best mother and done nothing wrong but stick up for me
<a:DESSSSSSS:642227618472656906>
"If you told iscoil it doesn't matter they'll take you away. If that happens  that's it I'm done. I want to know who you told so I should know if I feel violently sick or not."

The Mom to the dog 
"Theres no point waking up where I'm going"
I have **many** questions
Yeah...
She just said: guess I won't sleep tonight then thanks.

 As I refuse to tell her whether it's my dad or school teacher. Yet it's neither
"all I can do is my best and I feel like a total failure"
H
Thank you all. I think that's all I've got to say rn
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
All them house problems still exist rn.
Time flies when you're mentally hecked.
Because my memory is a sive
What would you say is the thing that made you realize "ok that mother of hers is bad"
That's true
Though..this day felt like 10 weeks.
It's weird to think next Sunday I probably will be somewhere far away
<:Zababies:672238628398956594> <:Zababies:672238628398956594> <:Zababies:672238628398956594>
I hope so
Does she stay home? Go into s different car...?
What happens with *her*
Wait a min
*heh*
Of*
She doesn't even know or the recordings
She's way more cautious now.
As Monday when they see the recordings. Is when they choose the timeframe for their action.
I wonder how urgent CPS will think it is.
Hm..
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
And hopefully I'll still have contact.
I might not be here.
In the next week or so.
It feels weird that..
Might as well try
Definitely
Thank you both <:Zababies:672238628398956594> <:Zababies:672238628398956594>

Who's the puppeteer?
Jesus..that president sounds like a moron..
Thanks cypher!
Thanks for the support  everyone! All we have to do now is talk to social workers sometimes and we are in a nice home.
<:KiriShiraHug:816901442258075669>
Good DESSIN times!
So basically
Aunt: of course you can be online. 

Response to when I told the aunt the mom interrogates us about WhatsApp.
***I'm allowed make tea whenever I want***
And get this
I'm really excited!
So an update about the mom situation:

A very nice social worker helped us on Friday. Massive scare from sat-sun.
But on Monday we were situated into an aunt's home. She looked at the clips and agreed she needs mental help and that I'm allowed stay with her as long as she wants. Everything has been really nice so far. there will be a social worker coming to the house but. They have said that it's what she has to do to make it all right in my eyes. So basically. I don't have to go back as I know I can't forgive her. Also on a side note. Our other aunt is bringing over some KFC! The whole family seems to be accepting and understanding once the case was cracked open properly. Waking up in a nice bed. Not afraid to go on WhatsApp and being interrogated on why.. making Tea and things falling  without screaming.. it's been lovely so far! Your reassurance really helped us - Constellation
Conclusion:all shit people, but trump doesn't know when to stop talking
The poor thing.
This shit pisses me off..
https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/dog-with-untreated-tumours-abandoned-outside-sanctuary-1.4439007
That's still  disgusting...
I do not want to know what makes them crunchy..
America is looking worse by the day..
Still not good news.
It's a half lie.
Still bad news.
Why can't we all just be  civil
I'm curious on the tweet
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Nothing all that serious to say this time to be honest. Just that thanks to everyone that pushed me on to tell. And gather evidence. Thank you. If it wasn't for you all i'd still be there. But luckily. You guys **did** push me. So now I'm able to be happy and a normal girl again. Thank you all once again.
Don't let em get to you
I'm sure you'll enjoy it
April is my birthday too!
If they are violent,that could fuck up the state of a care home. So I wouldn't be surprised if it's only physical or light mental.
Makes sense.
Is there a type of care home. Similar to pensioners. For people like that?
School will definitely be harder in it but..
Maybe I can't. But maybe they'll be kind.
And ask if I can reapply to my old school <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Finish my junior
So basically
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330> <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I'm doing it.
I don't care if I'm pulling Stella by the ear.
Fuck it.
..
So starting on first leaving year makes sense I think..
Different course in some ways
I was doing a junior **equivalent**
Here's the problem though Zenbu
I'm tempted.
But next September
I'd probably wait for this term to end by finishing the junior
How so?
We are tempted to try again. But have a cautious feeling inside..
But came back after a few months as she realized dwelling did nothing
The girl left school because bullying
Hit home
We were watching a show and it kinda
Hey so
After a long. Thorough, analysis of yourselves. We've came to the conclusion the British government. Us. Could never harm a fly
Options exist
Tell a therapist
Get stronger
Fuck them. Help you
You got into an accidental situation
You aren't.
No
Anywho
"Good morning  xxx i think that is great news. I will ring a  few people today and see what I can do"
I still feel inspired to do it
You're too drool for cool
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
So yeah.
Councillor*
You know what? I decided I want to do that. I don't want that woman to book anything so I'll ask you. Could you get me a council to prep me for this? I don't want to be a gremlin. I want to prove I have what it takes. Not to back down and let the bullies win. So I want to be as happy and prepared as possible. And I. I will go back to (school Name)
Sent this to my aunt
Heh
I need to make this body alive.
Our choice. Probably music oriented
Discussed with aunt. Will probably do a course after my online school instead of going into a place that bullied us
Yeah but now they've more fuel
What I mean is. This is one problem. But Karen's will make it out as if all vaccines have 10 grams of rat piss
So basically more fuel to Karen's Facebook page
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
When you can go to the army risking your life but can't drink or change something about yourself that affects no one else
Not like they can say much <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
I mean
Couldn't give a rotten olive about em
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Gutted?
Like yeah. Death isn't pog but
I can't be the only one who's like. How the fuck are you gutted about the rich royal family member you don't know at all dying
Apparently British people are torn
Dying two months before the 3 digits gotta be gutting.
What's that?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Honestly I'm stuck between stating my mind and being respectful so imma just say:
Youch
We're human
Who cares if you're black white or bright purple
Dipshits
Shit man..
I'm not gonna clown him. Just don't really care for him
Fair ig
Monopoly go brr
**they can** just they shouldn't have that power
I mean..
Why does Apple care?
I uh..
Tumbler. Literally just porn.
"Do you like apple hub?"
I didn't mean actually stopping. I mean should he be able to as a comparison point
Yeah
 Android isn't doing this
True
He should be able to talk but **should** he
Honestly- yeah
I just dunno how I feel able apple being able to just say:nah
Still wrong
It's not rolled out fully apparently
Yep.
Yep. Apple says no to meat apparently
So basically on IOS devices you can't look at nsfw in discord
Just realized that the discord situation will fuck apple over with how many social groups and ahm. Specifically naughty discords exist. So maybe they'll revert the change.  Ya can hope.
If raids happen and no admins are online they're handy
It'd be nice if  discord told us instead of us running like headless chickens
Oops
Fair
The usual I'd say is 
Mute ban kick delete message 
But no channel or server tampering 
For mods not admins
Some people want stricter perms on mods then others
You know. It'd be nice to discord told us that
Ohh
Closest thing discord could be talking about though.
So basically: apple doesn't like pure nsfw servers but allows nsfw in servers that aren't just a sex den 
Honestly? Fair stuff just feels sketch it's all from Apple
Makes sense
Fair fair
What about servers not nsfw but have like a whole nsfw category
Wait a minute so like
The way too much nsfw one prob
It is inevitable
I thought you meant actual full deletion. But it's still just  as bad.
OH.
Only the owner can delete the server **I think**
Idk how much of this is my other situation but my social anxiety is 1000% times worse since the pandemic. And I do a lot of long pauses when talking as I forgot how to hold a conversation for long periods of time. And I just feel like more of a shut in then I used to. So yeah. It's real messy for everyone and i hope everyone can recover from this
Definitely. Worries can happen. And not all trans people use hormones. Personally. I need em. But two things
1:don't scare yourself out of using em 
2:if you don't want to use them That's perfectly valid and let no one say otherwise
Anywho. climate change is a real problem and hopefully greedy higher ups realize that
No you

What happened
Definitely not child manipulation for money

Ah yes. Nothing more charitable then isolating a group on their own and being pricks

That's.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Of Course! Here for you always
Why does transgender deserve best sauce. Idk. Feels good to coin though.
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
The best sauce.
||transgender is now canonically curry sauce||
||i don't like mustard but I let it slide for metaphor||
Very true.
The emote name.
When loris doesn't understand something he dies. Noted.
I think you get the idea.
Though back to the metaphor.
Opinionated.
Just don't overdo the ketchup
I mean.
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Judge them on the patty inside.
Don't judge a hamburger for having a different sauce
And the meat.
And lettuce.
But so is mustard.
It may be good too.
People may expect it.
That isn't good
K:my finger slipped oopsie
Fair
How bad is the charge on that
K:Whoopsies
The world is..kinda fucky.
wow.
Not pog
Life is
Imma just send this
Onions
Well..that's not good.
What's happening
Thank god it was a setup.
Theres chat logs of him talking to what he believes is a 14 year old girl. And at the end came to "her" house for a cupcake
Basically this guy was caught in a sting operation
YouTube. you demonitize swears. Yet keep this person caught in 48k on the platform
Wow.
Just saw the edp445 situation.
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
No.
Not my boy murderman.
No.
Can I learn the difference I genuinely dunno
Dickweed is a new one
Nvm.
I thought.
Oops
Wait aren't they
*To judge the situation?*
<:KirikaConcern:698939825386029186>

God I'm worried about what' he'd be like without camera.
Fucked up

How does.
Wait a min..

Ah yes. Being dissatisfied with a game is definitely a normal reasonable excuse to do an assassination attempt.
Hopefully
Just wait.
Sounds rude
<:BepThumbsUp:452610626917892096>
No prob! Dms open if needed.
I do not really understand your situation but I'll just speak what my mind says. I don't know what loud minorities you've been going to but most real life homosexual relationships aren't about abuse or s-harassment. 

Saying you hate yaoi? Well. Depends on what you mean by hate. You can't exactly expect a straight man to enjoy yaoi no. As long as you respect that it's perfectly normal for others to like it I don't see a crossed boundary here. 

And when it comes to past experiences,again. I'm terribly sorry if you've gone through something traumatic. And understand if you don't want to see the fiction. Just don't put real life people who want to live their honest lives under the same hypercritical microscope. You have to remember. The only difference between you. And a gay man. Is that they like men. That's just the truth some people can't except (which is not what I'm saying you are doing. Just covering bases)
Oh yeah sorry.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Maybe Putin is a big symphogear fan and is a Maria Stan he just hides it.
I think the thing is. They can all apply to straight too.

Oh..
Eh I'm kinda dumb. We'll wait till tsuba fronts. The smart one
That's actually kinda interesting
Wrong number.
I'm down
We'll be getting disability prob mid-late may so. We'll drop a few euro when we can
You don't like her tho you fine
I mean tbf prob shouldn't be in that young a body
The good ol' "she's 1000" play
You just said you hate the card
It's good she stated concern though as it shows good intent
Probably a language barrier
As long as it's cute in a platonic sense no prob
Oh look at that adorable kid 
Or 
Look at how cute my girl is
Well cute is kinda context dependent
The entire world would be pedos by that logic
One good two  please don't hate yourself
It's  liking the kid that's fucked up
Your eventual partner was a kid once. Dating the adult (presumably close to your age) is fine
Think of it this way
As long as you aren't attracted to young Maria you're fine
That's Low.
Just.
Wow.
Yeah
The family with Stella says it's like "losing a son and gaining a daughter" and that it's hard on "her" <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I'm kinda sad this is debate and not just natural progression of morality but meh
Twitter:if you breathe  you probably did some fucked up stuff
"no guys she's 1000 I swear"
Which can make them feel  imposter syndrome if it actually happens (and is the victim)
Yeah
Fair enough.
Says a lot about the person tho
Well that's a take ig
If someone is into an anime child. You think that's aight
So.
Are you advocating what I think you are tho.
Depends on what you like about it
You could try reach out anyways. They can't control you forever
What's going the wrong way?
Sorry. Just that I wanted to cover that base when I saw that message
Wait. Are you. Uh.
Yuck
||If you are getting off to a cartoon kid|| maybe you should see multiple psychologists
Depends on what way tbh.
Is it a show.
Sadly  probably so

I'm here for ya!
From watching video
From what I can tell it's about the government trying to push Canadian and patriotic content
For us Reddit is the "how do we do this" machine
Same but I like it
All you need is discord. YouTube. And twitch. <:AnyoneCanAddEmotes:817992155809054791>
I mean when we have the catchphrase as just 
"Watch symphogear"
And joke it's a cult. It seems weird from the outside. But it's really just laughs on the inside
You're aight
Luckily it's a tight knit cozy place
I'd leave in a heartbeat if it was
Ngl. I'm glad this isn't a  dream Stan/BTS Stan kind of fandom
I like the community. I think it's good. *But* every angel has a record.
I hate that the first thing that came to mind when you said Hollywood things was ||bad child stuff||
What did he do?
I actually don't know what he did
Wait Morgan is a bad lad?
See ya lex
Fair
I know the older you get the more you know and all but. Why are like 96% of politicians 76+
He stopped because he saw a woman and kid. ~~ok gramps. Did you think fucking coyotes inhabited it?~~
Least*
Well that's good at last
He's doing better then trump. lowest of bars.
And his suddenly changed LGBT stance
The side boss everyone laughs at for dumb AI
Sus as hell
<:monkaHmm:488186704675471365>
As far as I know. No journalists are allowed see the border  (even though he says he does it better)
Trump was a story boss
Biden is the side quest bad guy
Like
Bad people can do good things
I know
Eyyyyyy ~~bad person does good things~~
<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
You know what I meant <:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
Some do. They don't think about their actions though
I can't just say ||beep|| u ||beep beep|| and ||honk honk|| yourself. Good moderation
Of course! Same with us
This place is moderated well tbf.
Yeah!
Yeah
And looking at certain fandoms. Means we got off lucky
It feels like there's more good then bad.
*yo*
Sometimes people need that
Just being there for them is help enough to them I'd guess
All the answers seem wrong in some capacity
What happens if you are after torturing this person for years and years and then something crops up, proving their innocence. You've just fucked up this man's mental state. Possibly body.
Also. If this person. Someway. Somehow. Escaped. They'd be a lot more mentally ill/threat then when first in  I'd guess
Torturous
I'd much rather die then be in complete isolation for the rest of my existence
Could be considered staying alive even with it killing you.
Technically if you took medicine that stopped one disease but gave you something fatal instead
We end up hating her more
Whenever a SW or family member tells us to forgive her
We understand how you feel

I swear if "Matt plays games" heysa controversy
So he was proven innocent for something yet still dogged on?
Sorry. Didn't think,I'll keep in mind.
I guess Alzheimer's representative has my vote.
The nan randomly over breakfast said
"How could you accuse your mother of malnorishing you."
Said that I've made things worse on purpose and that she hates that look of disgust in my eyes whenever I hear about her. That she'll always be welcome in her house. That she deserves a hello bye good morning from me. And got angry when I said I didn't love her. She kept saying I was looking for sympathy and that she loved her mother to the bitterend.  She said recording (the mom)  was terrible and a breach of trust and that I shouldn't have done it. When I said it was evidence and they obviously found something as I'm not living there she said so you think it's abuse? I said yes 
"Poor you"
Just gonna post this here.
Isn't that a *highly* dangerous substance
Holy..
Jesus Christ..
*huh* I knew Lena was trans. Didn't know Maddy was
**I didn't even catch that until you brought it up zen.**
They changed the name as he felt bad as he didn't make the game by himself
Yep!
Thank you
Haven't had a new weight check though
I still vomit if I eat a little more then usual.
Oh yeah. The nan also said. Don't go reporting on me now. I haven't done nothing. When I said yes. This is just an agreement it'll be solved she said. "Oh will it now. Let's see." And when I said I had no reason to report me she wondered what I was on about. Then I told her she literally said to not do it and I was responding.
*hug*
This tires me
Thanks.
The mom came into the house and said "I've done nothing on you. You've a short memory."
Didn't know the Irish MP was this guy till now actually. Good to know he seems to have good morals
Even then. Small chance that a condition could be why they have it.
America loves crushing peoples dreams
Fuck you're buying like 3 Xboxs a month just to survive
A weekly or monthly thing
Isn't insulin like
Wait
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
He's going with em isn't he
If he sees someone die
I feel bad for the politician like
**yeah**
Don't act like they are some plague
Let people be themselves. Especially when their quality of life is already lower
This kinda reminds me about how left handed people were. Not treated the best. Just for using another hand
I don't think you can *catch* cutting your leg off but you do you politician
And just regular amputees.
He does realize sometimes they are workplaces accidents
Like
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Isn't it like **way** cheaper in other countries?
Holy..
Dumbasses
So can other positive mental stuff
And if autism in their minds can be spread
If mental disorders could be contagious the kids should be braindead from Karen inheritance
*achoo!* Oh no! Autism is going around again. Aw shucks.
"medical freedom" is a weird way to pronounce dead
Bruh.
We care for you both
Stay safe.
I don't understand the situation so I won't weigh in but. Please y'all. Anyone near that situation. Stay safe aight?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Fair yeah
I understand why they go to other places for it.
No I mean
Gotta wonder how insulin costs like three Xboxs worth but the military gets ***way way way too much***
Makes sense
What did they give you?
Hellas sounds like a cool guy from hell.
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>

Crypto is not the most safe investment
Ahh.
Isn't their government like all 45+ year olds.
Not that I've heard of.
Messaging sites. No discord.
That's true. How didn't I think of that..
Thanks Naraku
I still find it hard to believe they exist..how do I know I'm not mental and they aren't **those** voices?
I hope this is one big fever dream...
That makes sense I guess..
My fists still feel warm..but I can't fire it off..
alright.. I'll trust you..
If I'm really in someone else's body. Why don't I remember anything.
None of this makes any sense..
oh..
Where the hell Am I. What happened to my quirk. Why am I across the ocean. Why am I in a boy's body. What happened to everyone. I can't find my notebook. I keep hearing these weird voices. First thing I was visiting my mom but...

Where's all might. Where's Kacchan..why do People keep saying I'm halfway across the ocean..
Nothing wrong with living in a world of your own. This is **YOUR** world to take. Not theirs. There's nothing wrong with not being good at something. Just keep trying your best and it'll work out I swear. We've vented here countless times. It's a cozy place after all. More importantly. A place that cares about YOU. Ok? Do not die. Keep striding on until you feel that will to live. Don't let those who look down on you win. When there are so many other people like Us who want to see you happy 
You're no pussy.  and no more worthless then I. So basically. You're good.
That's fair yeah
I don't quite blame them accounts  if it's illegal for it there. It shouldn't be illegal period. But they aren't exactly going to be blatant about it where it is.
I mean.
what.
I have lost the last ember of faith in humanity
But the answer yes.
Why. Why would you swallow 15 magnets. This reminds me of the "if your friends jumped off a cliff would you"
.
How are people meant to trust the police when this shit happens.
**yeesh.**
Whoopsie. Classic blunder.
" Police accidentally handed all of Ms Spittles's phone data to her former partner"
Jesus..
Its odd how people think it's not a slur. When trap means to catch someone by surprise maliciously
Sorry man I'll sparkle stealthily
"tired of seeing gay people everywhere"

Welp.

We are notoriously bad with languages. But fair enough yeah
Oh my bad.

"Disciplined"

That hard to just be a nice person huh

Fair
Doesn't evolution take a *very* long time too?
Expected
Judging off certain art of sonic
Well.
The USA seems to get weirder and weirder
Oh.
Did I read that right
Uh.
No problem Yumi.
"Hello. I noticed you call yourself a character. Can I ask if you're a fictive or roleplaying? I don't want to say  something offensive by accident."
So the only true way of knowing is a polite question
As fictives come in many forms and accuracies
You can only ask
Honestly.
Also. Useful term. Plural alters who stem from fiction are called fictives
What do you mean?
If it barely affects them. They'll just buy more <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Is the tax high enough to truly even make a dent in rich people's pockets?
The HR?
Wonder trauma priority
Looking at your profile pic. Fitting
I'm guessing cypher means drugs alcohol and other substances leading to homeless via addiction?
R.o.i
Feels odd to be denied.
Aspergers diagnosis
And literally a school issued laptop for typing
Thanks Alexis and das.
Thanks Loris.
We knew about it after resubmitting
Already happened.
This.
The money still has to be dropped through her
It'd be a really low tier play even if malicious
Also
Yeah..
<:TsubaCry:835962053897748520>
I'm really scared because another server said the family is probably lying but I wanna believe it's just an error
..is that common?
<:woawdess:796598780560539699>
"you have trouble shaving right"
Just. Kinda embarrassed because
And like. It's bad yeah
Apparently it's because uhm.... "They ticked your coordination as good"
The government doesn't like to fuck up with money.
But I doubt.
It's being appealled. Something about...wrong boxes??
Was denied.
Which was going to fund hormones and a way of leaving the entire family system in two years.
The disability money.
...so.
I don't know if the place that gives money factors it in but.
Granted.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
***nvm apparently***
I know just the person.
Wait.
Ahhh.
You said something about levels and judgment
How was it denied. If I haven't even been tested for it.
Wait.
Still doesn't seem right though.
Though she could have considered we got out of her hands and wants easy shit out of us.
Letting money happen and that be the way that wrap us.
It'd be carrot on a stick
If she was gonna try hurt.
She's the manipulative type
I don't see a smart reason
Who else **can** though.
I'm guessing bio mother filled?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I have NO CLUE who filled said sheet. Or what they said
Granted -
They know we're. Very on the ball
Technically they could say that to hide it from me but.
well yeah
Preparing food. Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh meh
Check
Engaging with people
Makes sense
If those boxes are clicked lower
Looking at that
So THAT'S why they kept going on about coordination
Hm lemme read
I don't think we ever got our own license
Not cursive
Oh heh.
Thanks Alexis
Fair enough
Blue eyes?
Leftie
It's just that bad

Didn't you also say
Which disability is 209 a week?
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
I wonder if it'll work this time around.
Huh.
True
Just feels odd that the same country diagnosed me and saw fit to have a school issued laptop **for an IMPAIRMENT** doesn't count as valid yet
*holy*
Night y'all.
Guess I'll. Hit the hay.
Guess there's not much I can but wait and damn see.
What the fuck to do.
*sigh*
Lucky shits.
Is it like how schools are with counseling?

Ah good.
Ahhhh. No problem.
Don't quite understand this sentence
I very much doubt they'll care about a letter.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
The government isn't Aldi
One problem with that
The nan did say that "the mom is going to write a very long letter. And she Always gets  it done"
Hm.
Yeah...
Is essential. For so much.
This money das.
*hug*
And idfk.
Worried as hell.
Fuck man. I'm tired as hell.
So maybe that goes into It? Idfk...
I'm literally just after a CPS case with the mom. (Yet she's still technically guardian)
Rent is extremely hard to find
Fair
But no status quo to reach and not some low budget crooks
I think rapists and serial killers could go in there.
Yeah.
Can't let them run rampant when  trying to figure out what to do with them
I can see jail though.
I don't think prison will ever be something I agree with to be honest.
Thought so. Wasn't certain
Ahh.
Thanks nuker
But I can't remember
I know there is one
Remind me of the difference between prison and jail
Let's put bad people in terrible conditions that strip them of freedom and basic rights. That won't worsen them at all
Some people can't be a part of society. For sure. But idk. Prison just robs them of whatever spec of decency privacy and security they ever had.
That's just asking for trouble and prison where it shouldn't happen
prisons should have a LOW AMOUNT OF PEOPLE they are there to encapsulate bad people. Even though I don't agree with that. And like...
Jesus.
So.
..
What's that mean exactly?
Exactly
Imagine putting them with methheads and killers
Like. They are gross perverts now.
Putting like minded people with other like minded people isn't going to make a two wrongs make a right situation
I've opinions on prison
Eh.
Not some random girl with a broken phone
Of girls who know they did it. And don't care
If you ***REALLY*** need to. There are many consented pictures you can look at
Exactly
Hopefully not
I think I just barfed a little
There's a good chance those men downloaded them to their personal phones.
...bruh I just thought.
Yeah.
But her rep is down the toilet
Millions is great and all
And like.
"is my phone fixed?"
"Yeah. Also Everyone knows every inch of you now"
Literally a worst nightmare come true

I guess so
Really doesn't work
As a trans person
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I just do it as fast as possible.
<:RubyStare:765885615174057984>
You're allowed skepticism
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
And you're thinking it.
I mean. You're not currently under it this second.
You've left. Not their problem
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
They don't *need* to know about a new job. They shouldn't need to know your new area.
It's fair to not trust  them
So yeah
Not even our situation. Different kid)
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
With our family situations. I can guarantee child workers aren't doing their job
Oh definitely. but they're humans with their own desires and agendas. No matter what they go into as a career
They can be called being careful sometimes
We don't.

Thought so yeah
That reminds me. I don't know how to feel about when viewers pour into their streamers. Like for example. Yes tubbo is working, but he's a kid playing Minecraft. He shouldn't have the fact someone said they're thinking of ending their lives on his shoulders
So let's see. JK Rowling. Scott cawthon. What other childhood figure will be terrible today
Though. I don't remember foxy being trans)
Sadly yeah.
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Luckily we've games like Celeste to keep us feeling supported
Fair
Whatcha mean
<:TsubaCry:835962053897748520>
Same thing with JK Rowling
So big part of our childhood
But a lot of our fond childhood memories were watching theories and let's players.
We don't follow it anymore

Whoopsies.
Oh yeah didn't he cheat
Most on twitch
Some members do SMP on YouTube
I mean.
I mean. Didn't Scot literally start his game creating life on tons of religious games and preaching. Now that I think about it. Not fully surprised
They aren't transphobic! They just go against trans people. Hate trans people. And don't want them to transition!

Tomorrow at 1
My check in with the doctor for disability money
Very quick update
Thank you Alexis!
Thanks Naraku means a lot!
Some news 
So basically. I'm being brought into my doctor. To discuss my disability money. I have to make my case about writing. Terrible social anxiety. And well. That stuff. which is...good news! I can make our case. Family isn't keeping money away obviously. As I'll be talking with doctor. and it's good to know I have this chance properly.

Only worries are. Now it's up to ME
I'm worried I'll either. Massively underplay it. Making me not get it. Or go too hard and seeming like a try hard. I hope we can get this money. It's important.. but I gotta wonder why I wasn't brought in the first time
The MOM has to be with ME during it.
Damn..
I'd like to keep it that way
I've never had a heart attack
It's **that** nerve racking to be with her.
What I'm saying is.
Rakhi.
Huh?
I freak out if I'm near something she's touched.
How am I meant to talk to a doctor
I HIDE IN MY ROOM. AND CAN BARELY GO "UHUH" near her
WHAT THE LIVING FUCK DO I DO
But this doctor is able to get all the evidence
I hate her so much.
This is good and absolutely petrifying
I said I'm not going with her. 
"I'm not going to kill you or anything. I'm the best damn mother you've ever had"
We're being pressed to go with the mom to the hospital for nerve
.
<:TsubaCry:835962053897748520>
Still long way to go
From what I can tell. Ideal weight is 
155 - 189 lbs.
Makes sense.
~~I'm in Ireland maybe a few years~~
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Yeah..
Could take 3+ months to get information. 6 weeks to hear if it's accepted or not afterwards
Damaged nerve is scary too
Yeah. Apparently it's still bad though..
He wasn't told:
Anything trans or where I am on waiting list 
No closure on knee (might have damaged nerve from medicine) 
I'm 5'11 1/2    110lbs/50kilos
Need closure on bullying in school from teachers and school counselor/writing laptop.


He said without the proper paperwork the court will dismiss me and set us back farther..

This could take 3+ months in some cases...
See y'all..
And. Going.
Anxiety
Anywho thanks!

Ain't that sugar
If I don't get this money. The family won't help pay

I wouldn't be surprised if a coke can was a harem queen in fanfic
Fanfics have everything
I wonder if harem queen's exist
Well. That also plays into gender roles tbf..

But. Maria tsubasa ver would be harem

Lol
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Tbf. It's still funny. They're putting me through torment while I'm trying to get money. Yet that very same money will be my ticket out

I call it legal kidnapping<a:BuroDance:602675806946459658>
Calling them family is too nice
Yeah they are
Yeah. Fucking her herself.
Nans words.
"she knows all about your struggles"
Nan and mom because
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
All of it.
I hate the sound of her voice.
I break down easily near her
The problem is. I can't be in a room with her for over 2 minutes.
The subject matter isn't the problem.
It's nothing to do with that stuff
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:TsubaCry:835962053897748520>
Nothing matters. Just **GET OUT**
It's just. My brain doesn't work when I'm near her.
Aren't touchy
You pass girl
Think. What would other trans girls think of you saying that
<a:BuroDance:602675806946459658>
Promise
You're a good woman
Alexis
My man is still pure.

Childhood
Ahem
Am I the only one who still doesn't like the word queer and associates it with slur?
Everything else is the same random cocktail everyone is in
The only difference between LGBTQ. And straight cis. Is gender and what you like.
You know. It'd be nice for more representations in media that didn't make us look like another breed.
You get what I mean.
I wonder if that's still up
Netflix made cuties. We shouldn't be surprised
That was a. Very weird trailer to watch.
.
... please tell me whale is an acronym
Like. 
First one: I'd probably laugh it off. Maybe feel a little down 
Second one:I'd feel. Well. Bullied? I know the first would be too. but I wouldn't shrug it off..
Words are funny. I wouldn't care as much if someone called me a shitbag that deserves to rot in hell because im ugly nowhere as much as a simple GG. And I understand why I'm like that. Just kinda...odd?
Rhymes with maggot
Looking at the trailer... Like... Stereotypical_Gay_Man_NPC1
*slightly* better.
If gg is 100. Queer is like. 95 for me
Yeaaah..
Interesting
What's that
I knew a gay girl who calls herself the GG word. *Kinda surprised me how nonchalantly she did it.*
Awwwwwwh
Quite a power move. In all seriousness. Why do so many people treat animals wrong
<a:BuroDance:602675806946459658> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
You're both valid
Yeah
I think?
Just because you've gotten it away for yourself  doesn't mean the other stems are suddenly gone
Better way to put it. If you eat a Carolina reaper. But couldn't taste spice. It'll still rip your insides out
Think of diluted water. 
The more water you put in. The less of the flavour you taste.

NoMoreFans.
Funny thing is. At least tumbler is just *known* for it. onlyfans is very explicitly a horndog site.
Probably
Pornhub:we have decided to be anti porn as it disrespects women
Wait what
Real question is. Would the general server do better under new management. And is a fresh start where people jumping ship is no guarantee worth it for that change?
Definitely
You get what I mean.
A captain is no captain if all his crew jump ship
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Unless he violated TOS they probably won't give a single fuck
The curfew was the excuse for the action. But at 7pm it's just them scraping the bottom of the barrel for a way out
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209> <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209> <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
At 7pm
Apparently they were "trying to enforce curfew"
...uh.
Oh cool. They're very pretty
Only just now read the self harm comment.<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
No you old man.
Just. this feels wrong. But it's profitable so that doesn't matter.
I don't even know what I want to say tbh.
Because it's meant to "resonate with people"
Not because they feel bad for her. But because it gets clicks.
You're both downscaling something but also using her experience as a way to talk about the crisis
I think it's gross from both angles
Like. I'm no spears fan. But you don't just. Do that.
Wrong
Just feels.
And. Yeah people don't like covid. It's bad. But using someone else's experience to cheaply try link into a current topic using a celebrity
She couldn't visit friends that close?
..jeez.
I wonder when R/symphogear was made.
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
98%
Oh yeah solo
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The 1% is because. No community is ever fully pure
Shush no.
Again. Good job from Kerrik Mel and Lily for maintaining an enjoyable server 99% away from toxicity
Yeah I like it here
Always with the technicalities
Guessing this is real bad though
Dunno who he is
Sorry
You're the main protagonist
You don't need sleep ever again
Maybe it's a new power
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Watch a video on quantum mechanics
https://c.tenor.com/1OOU9BdvHocAAAAM/backfired-okay.gif
I'm not surprised just more. *Fuck another?*
Fuck.
..
Let's just hope the next time some fishy stuff comes up he stays there.
Fair
Understood, sorry.
Too easy for contact to slip back in.
I wouldn't trust the family either.
Also
Exactly. It boils down to victim, rapist, and lack of consent.
A rapist isn't exactly prime mom material no.
He didn't consent to the child. Why should he have a financial obligation
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Sad but true
Some find it disgusting. some fetishize it
Both problems exist
Exactly
Essentially: 
She's a person who happens to be trans

But just like people who *aren't* trans. Can also be quite hostile too 

Essentially nothing to do with trans. Just her own odd sense of internal progression. my only thought is to talk to her about it and see if there's something underlying all this, to see
If *she* is alright. And simply say this. "We are not "chasers*" because you're not.
Bots exist
"sorry. You can only stop us showing you this specific content If you pay up"
Wow
Well that's annoying
Ahhhh.
Almost sure that exists
Isn't there an option to block certain tags
What does she *specifically* have a problem with
Never used pixiv
Fair
Yeah..it sounds like there isn't exactly another way Cecil
Ah. Broken filter. nice
Also. You do realize the less of that stuff you look at. The less you'll see it pop up
Not a tumour. Very stupid. But not a tumor
Sometimes they do make it stupid but
I mean
Are you blocking the people who do lewd art once in a blue moon? Because from what I can tell. You should prioritize the people who do specifically nsfw
Question
Deviant art is the definition of cursed yeah
Why do you have 50 blocked people
> Not interested

Block the creators. And on YouTube just click "I'm not interested in this"
Ads are weird.
I was recommended Japanese foot pads
I think your problem is a lot less to do with anything LGBTQ and more the porn industry
In 98% of places consent is needed
Also
They shouldn't but. Yeah
You know a straight person can do that right
I know it's easier said then done but. Please stay strong friend
I hope you'll be okay..**big hug.** That'll be very hard on you if it happens
Tbf unisex toilets are like an urban legend in Ireland
When I transition, obviously the female toilets
Then you've done something bad
If it gets to the point random strangers are going "what the fuck. Don't you want them to live'
Exactly
And she kept saying "it doesn't concern you so why would you care" 
I care because there's a childs life in the hands of a stupid antivax
Yeah
***I'D WANT MY CHILD TO LIVE PAST 4***
Just realized my nan agrees with the idea of parents being allowed to deny kids vaccines. Oh god.
Needs a gentler hand
And yet D.C is thinking of putting it on disabled people. Who if anything
Also. Kinda inhumane. I don't even agree with shock collars on dogs.
That's just doing it for them
It wouldn't stop it
Even if you wanted to be immoral
A shocking device to stop self harm is the most amazingly fucked up but also stupid idea
They do realize
Like
> correct self harming behaviour
> Shocking device
That I'm reading that wrong
Please tell me
..
You*
Very religious <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
All I'll say is. even though we've never tried. not something yoy can do in Ireland
As long as we wouldn't be forced into a males and everyone had to use unisex. I'd be cool with it
I think they're very useful for NB'S and if someone prefers it
As*
Brain hurts
Idk if it's controversial or not but. When I transition. I'm a gal, that simple (we want surgery and hormones) so we gonna use said bathroom we we're a girl. You know?
Not common
They probably exist but
Never seen one
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
And who pays taxes
Just over 1 million euros.
At least it's illegal to not get them vaccinated
Because if they do succum to the chip bull
that's fair. Which is another reason I believe in mandatory vaccines.
*yeah..yikes.*
Misinformation is a great target until you realize almost all of them are completely unwilling to hear new (and true) information
What.
But why put race into it??
Yes be competitive. That's fine.
Why can't people just. Enjoy the sport?
..Jesus.
Them players missed them. Not the entire pigment. Also the players shouldn't be harassed either.
Oh good god..
Poor things..
Yeah..
Compare the 90's to  2021
I honestly think things will shake up in our lifetime
We really are at the start of a very tech digital world
"oh god how did they play on this."
Someday. It's going to be 4 and 8k that are seen as terrible
720 and 1080 used to be **the** shit.
The thing I think about which is less cool is this
Just a house? I don't see it
I think there's more to happen yes.
But I wouldn't exactly make it a mode or transport for citizens
That car is awesome.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/nation/5-stories-a-sports-car-that-can-fly-why-4-day-work-weeks-work-and-other-stories-you-missed
But still
It is a prototype
A flying car has down a fly.
I mean
That would require somehow sending physical materials through WiFi. (I'd guess)
I think it's cool. Just not exactly...feasible?
That sounds like a chi fi movie.
I wouldn't want to leave someone a widow. Yet I also have a strong fear of dying alone
That's.. really sad.
Natural disasters. Dumb people. Underlying conditions you didn't know about. Freak accidents.
That does mean the chance of being a widow if you're married is very high.
The day symphogear, love live, revue starlight. Etc. Is seen as the classics. Is when I know I've actually grown wrinkles
Wrong. the answer is G
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Imagine when symphogear actually becomes filled with veteran boomers.
How old would you be?
Dear god I'd be 36.
Will discord even be around in 20 years I wonder.
When was this server made?
"because I'm cultured, Jimmy."
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
"why is there an anime girl pillow in your profile picture"
"Grandpa what's a dank"
Jesus
You're from the ol' island too?
Even the US
Here's the weird thing. 

I'll die?  Yeah I know. I just hope I'm loved when I do.

Others die? That's when my brain starts thinking existential dread
I know this system treasures you as a good friend
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I'm now understanding the term ignorance is bliss
that's very true.
You've free speech
You're alright Das
Honestly. The thought of everyone slowly drifting me away. Leaving me alone to myself while anyone close to me can vanish in a click.

Is a big scare..
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Same geminus.
Done this system a lot of good and bad
I don't think living in my room 24/7 waiting for two years to leave hell is being alive..
This is a fear of mine
I believe solo means one with international lockdown
Jesus
What the fuck is wrong with people
We shall always care for you sugar
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Ah yes. Because the government letting up on the restrictions definitely won't make the Karen's go "HA TOLD YOU"
Boris. What.
A giant wave from a new variant. All restrictions lifted for "freedom"

and the UK skyrocketing to the top of the chart like a race
Woah! So odd to find people who actually know the country
We're from r.o.i
They would ask where the money is going to. Saying it's governmental greed that are used to fund said conspiracy operations
Fully sealed 9. Something
Exactly.
Basically it's a shit show all around and people should vaccinate?
No*
I understand that. Mainly because I don't like the idea that a parent can say "well. Facebook says it bad so no  vaccines for you Timmy"


Few years later "Oh no how did he die. I did so much"
Yeah.
I'd much rather a freak accident 
***That only a doctor. NOT A PARENT*** would know to prevent. Then a giant spike of uneducated parents not vaccinating making a giant spike
Don't want to see a massive spike of dying children
I just.
Not to me. Sorry.
Actually on second thought 18+
Not your child. You.
*for yourself*
16-18 should be when it becomes a choice
The younger the body the weaker the immune system.
Give a Karen an inch and she'll steal a mile.
What..
Great!
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
But stuff like Aphrodite I can see slipping through
I'd say most of the strong stuff would be weeded out because they really really don't like this stuff. And with their blocking it shows.
Yeah that too
Chances are you were going to run into Hades sooner or later if you like mythology and games (that's an assumption that you like games)
Indie*
Hades is a very loved die mythology game
Oh interesting
SwaziNews Twitter
I'd be willing to bet that most people don't share their media passwords
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Being a terrible person is one thing. But sounds like he's dense too
Have enough common sense to not gloat about it in an interview
Even the people who think it's ok (IT IS NOT)
Like
He what now
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
You know what. Not even changing that typo
Thanks randy San!
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Yeah. We aren't tampering with your body.
Yeah..
Damn..
I told the nan about this. She said "it's only fair" what now <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Still not right.
Treat others how you want to be treated is junior infants level
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
How petty can you be
> If they work face to face customers 

It's cloth. Around their head.
The fuck why
As someone who isn't religious
The discount codes just so happen to accidentally line up with nuclear launch codes
<:woawdess:796598780560539699>
They need to use it for self defense a lot more if they're legalized. Lot more guns in people's hands.
You know. I may not enjoy Ireland but. Dear god I'm glad I never had to worry about school shootings..
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Damn..
That wasn't bullying. It sounded. A whole lot damn worse
Like
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
They are going to find out sooner or later. (Sup FBI man. What's good)
That sounds like a movie.
Yeah that'd be stupid.
As they'd become more scarce
Gun prices would go up presumably on the illegal market
How does it help them?
Stops a lot of people from going into daddy's storage
That's also true.
This isn't me advocating guns but. I'd much rather a bullet then being  stabbed.
Well Hitler but. You get me.
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
But. You don't get more morally wrong then the KKK
Uh..
Reminder we're talking about a  ice cream company
> does not seek peace, and wishes to undermine the very existence of the State of Israel. It takes aim at the Israeli economy."
>  We must oppose this boycott and terrorism in any form,'
Don't do horrible things.
It's a Twitter handle. Who cares.
What the fuck.
Cube crawls.
Uh
Pretty sure you'll never ever be able to go if you click it on purpose and don't say it's an accident
Who would click *yes* intentionally
I mean.
Begging for a mistake to happen to an innocent
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
"oh me!"
As if someone's gonna go
Uh
Yeesh on that one.
Ahh
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Activision used to be good?
I'll watch
I watch him sometimes
Mutahar
This
Wait. I think I heard something like this yesterday..
I forgot what happened with blizzard but I know it wasn't good
An avalanche.
Welp.
I really do hope you get better G. We're rooting for you all the way
I'm a sucker for words like guardians. Rebirth. Etc
Cleveland guardians just sounds a lot cooler then Cleveland Indians to me
That's cool
That annoys me so much And I can't pinpoint why
<:PadpaWat:803822882190262323>
There's a lot of bad in here. Yuck..
jesus...
>  specifically, at a party before her death, male-coworkers were alleged to be passing around a picture of the deceased's vagina
> they could not risk promoting her as she might get pregnant and "like being a mom too much"
sooo. i'm reading the legal docs.
One idea is to help lift their spirits!
I'm honestly confused on why I don't feel guilty right now..I feel Great
Overlapping
Who actually thinks being a weeb makes you a deviant
Weeb Bastion sounds weird
Ah yes. ReactionMan777 is definitely changing culture
<:ChrisSip:804429487952625684>
Uh.
Lol
Jesus..
Maybe they're so used to their version of "normal" that the idea of ANYTHING could go against the grain in any way scares them. Making them disregard it. Then  they can also  try to say it doesn't exist out of fear of learning something about themselves.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The first thing that goes through my head is that. If you're that mentally self conscious of yourself that you have to dog on others just being themselves every chance you get. Maybe you're the mentally ill one
Jesus
I never. Ever. Thought I'd say those two things back to back
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
> Human rights abuser.

> Ben and Jerry's ice cream
If only it stayed that way <:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
I forgot that existed
It really just comes down to the person. 
These systems can influence that yes. But doesn't determine it
Yep
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Some men can put more emphasis. 
Some girls put less emphasis
Some girls put more 
Some men put less
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
Welp.
That sentence *kinda* grosses me out for some reason
Interesting
She's not 7. She's 1000. Promise
I know, just trying to think what could have kick started it
That's reassuring
Ahhhh.
I thought it was like. 13 for some Reason
Ah
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
A lot of it probably has to do with different AOC'S leading to different lengths you can stretch the correctness. And with anime, west people with a higher AOC get used to it.

That's my guess?
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
Well yeah. If someone randomly started talking about lolis 24/7 while I'm doing work Imma run away
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Why can't people just enjoy what they do as long as it's not illegal
Damn.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I'm curious
Example
The onion really is just the news from the future
If everyone had that attitude there would be no change. Ever. **Well! Imma die in 80 years. It'll barely budge. So I'll stay put**
So my culture isn't catered to violence
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Compared to Ireland. Which military isn't about fighting but bridging the gap of those who are fighting.
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
This is a new level of edge.
Uhuh.
Uh.
Uh. That sounds kinda.
And you wouldn't be Naraku.
I like being Lily. Thanks.
Wait. You *actually* want to throw away all senses of being you  away?
I like my individuality thanks.
You're acting like we're a hive mind
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
And if it's required. Nothing they can do about it. And even they know how bad it looks to rebel against CHARITY
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
Who the fuck would rebel against giving thrown out food to charities
Nope! But as long as the majority can have a close enough view point to *force* it.
There are so many less villainess ways to do this. I'm not going to pretend to know them. Or back them up. But others here seem to know these ways. You can create change. And help humanity. Without becoming the next forbidden word in history
Holy fuck
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
It's. 50%. Of ***HUMAN LIVES***
Also. If you actually somehow got into power. And 50%'d us. You know you'd be the next Hitler. No. Even worse. Right? Obviously you aren't,don't worry I'm not calling you him. But anyone that wipes 50% of the human  race is going to be hated to hell
Way to feel empathy ig
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
And?
Then fight to *get* it on that path. You're complaining about what change OTHERS are making. But making none yourself
This is so stupid still
Ben and Jerry's do be on the run
<a:EucWheeze:738171346357452800>
- Oh I thought they somehow just said fuck you to a day. Like how hotels don't have the 13th floor
From general
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Ah shucks. Why haven't I thought of that. Just say no
Better then being thanos.
And you're keeping these values. That you don't even remember the meaning of as fact
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
> i want to kill half the world 

> Why? Cuz.
I uh. Naraku
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
I'm curious too
50% gone.
And your friends
They'd be killed.  And half their friends.
If you're doing the 50% blankly. Your own family would hate you
If you twisted that how I think you did. You do realize these other **humans** in other countries are doing it better. Proving the bad way of life isn't inherit
Basically. You can't blame the world on American problems. Especially 50'ing us
America isn't exactly the best. 

***MY AUNT IS WELFARE WITH TWO KIDS*** (granted she's a boyfriend now. But didn't for two years)
And it can change even so
That's your country. Not the world
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553> <:KanonSweat:712760466983616553> <:KanonSweat:712760466983616553> <:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
I earn more (converted) as a 16 year old with no experience. Then an American adult no experience
That reminds me
Oh? Either you do it that way. Or you SPECIFY WHICH IS WORSE
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
Cutting all family's in two
Morality. Emotions. Those are what make humans humans. They're integrated into you. Unless you're sociopath <:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>  (Not Calling you that) and you've shown us songs you've written. Hive you would have no time for those. Would never care.
They what
Jesus.
Stop n frisk
Is
..what the fuck
He moves like a robot
Uh..
Your restrooms don't have toilet paper??
Wait.
I don't know what to say but. We're here for you

Of course! We're here for you
Oh oops
"FRICKIN FRICKS" sonic guy
Was this guy the
Wait.
Surprised it's my first time hearing of  them
Ahhh. Jesus..(I've aspergers.)
My brain is feeling particularly small today. What does that last bit mean
No clue who Chris is. But after reading this.  glad I don't.
Yeesh.
I thought they meant the ones outside.
Sorry.
I just thought "ah. Another American thing"
Is it bad I didn't question that for Americans.
Ohhh
You poor Americans..
Ohhh.
Please tell me it's not what I think.
Uh.
I guess so
"look what one of you did"
Also. This'll definitely be used as ammo for phobes
Big Yikes ..
Sorry Mac and robin
Isn't Kanye the guy Kim is divorcing. Has bipolar. And refuses his meds?
First two. 4th  and drake. Yeah
I haven't really talked to anyone but family and social workers (irl) for almost two years.
But that was when I was still in school
The only big name I know is Juice wrld. From word of mouth
I don't listen to rap
Only Jay I know is Jaystation (a prick)
They can tell she isn't mentally ok right?
Jesus.
Dunno who Jay-Z is.
Wait. did you say Reggie.
*o*
<:KanataDed:795495319445045298>
**fuck I'm slow**
Reminds me of how someone I know said "I'm scared of black People" and knowing how I feel about THAT take..
Yet. Hates gays
They're *out*
They aren't even closeted trans.
Brain can't wrap around that one.
Just.
That last part. *Huh?*
Immediately wondered if she was sexually abused himself early.
Yeah..
On one hand, mentally not well 
The other ||rapes mom||
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Looked up their name. Immediately found a "why I call sonichu male pronouns" vid. Look soncihu sounds like absolute scum. Doesn't mean you have to be scum too
Ahh
He's a great lad
Also. I may not watch him as much. But I still consider myself a fan
Honestly. These people are a great durex commercial
May she rest in peace.
No one's cheering you. They're judging.
I never understood that honestly
Yeah...
How monstrous can you be
Holy fuck.
And find a fucking Pool of videos saying 'his dad deserved it" "he's burning in hell" "no one cares about your stupid dad"
I look up jacksepticeyes dad on YouTube
But he had to block jack's name from his comments. And I thought. Surely there's not that Much
And I knew jacksepticeyes dad situation some people were taking the piss. (Evil)
I watched was Someordinarygamers.
Yikes.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah..
<:KanataDed:795495319445045298>
PEAK lazy
I sit mindlessly on my bed
So. Instead of putting up with watching anime in a bright room
I like anime in a dark room
I'm usually the opposite
Why worry when Mari is singing shiny racers
Fair
Ahh
Yeah. Idk about that take
Considering I'm in bed watching anime from bed. Using my controller to switch episodes?
So they literally just wanted to pick a fight
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Ah yes. I'm sure the transitioned female is the problem. Not the performance enhancement drugs everyone is probably using
<:KanataDed:795495319445045298>
Oh for fuck sake.
Though I will say having the nose bleeding pervert who's very. Uh. Gross. Being LGBT rep isn't my favourite choice
But hey. More power to em
I don't remember mineta ever being that weird way he is with girls with boys
In the show
It's just a little surprising to me (thanks for reminding me to finish the last season or 3) because uh.
Still love the online ones I have though
Im a teen. I'm only online for reasons.

But even an introverted geek who loves her room like me.

Still really wants to live outside it. I can promise that. And friends outside of it
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Weed and spaghetti. Don't hear those two too often
That's how I view it (my earlier post)
It's another layer
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
But hey. They're here
With how *my* home life is. I probably wouldn't be here if not for online friends.
Honestly.
It also depends on a lot.

With your friends? You could be the most extroverted guy 
Strangers? Introvert
Here's the thing.

I APPRECIATE THEM TO BITS.

But they do feel like they're missing something
I think I saw that picture with her looking into space with that necklace of her OC. thought "huh. Weird." And forgot about it
I've always seen 4chan as "that part of the internet you shouldn't go to"
Honestly, I'm surprised I've only heard of this girl recently
God that's a long documentation on a single individual
And this is my stance too
The four bullet points
One calls her Christine. The others all call her chandler
A what?
Goddamnreally
"secure your place among us" god that was intentional wasn't it..
Uh.
It's apple. Can they go lower?
That reminds me
It should be mandatory imo but
Fastest yes ever
They ask consent 50 times
When I got my vax
Also
>
Isn't that the thingy you joined
Tons of anti vax in newspapers
*my* personal hell. And it's very uh. Yeah.
Ireland is
<:AinyaSip:699314293862039572>
"top 15 reasons to not get the vaccine"
Nan showed me a newspaper
I wouldn't jump
Ehhhh
Nice
No problem.
Exactly. It's nothing to do with the gender.
Is it heterophobic to not like male on women incest
I'll answer this with a question
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
You're probably ok
As long as you aren't doing the KKK identity or something like that
Well. Yeah
I don't have to
You do that
If you want to dress as a gecko graphics designer
Let people be themselves tbh
Still. Shouldn't be a law
Fair fair
Shouldn't
God I hate the legal system
It's your body and legal docs lmao
Wat
On my online school. The certs are F and say Stella (gonna change that name)
> Alex Jones was right

A cursed sentence
Heard that one
One: theres more to games then that
Two: lesbians
Damn.
I was 5
Apart from "imma fuck your mom" I don't think I've heard other stuff
Is it really that anti female?
~~It's a game you dumb fucks~~
I hate unnecessary gendering
I don't understand communism or capitalism. I leave that to people who understand it
What's gamer gate?
Depending on what is said
Transphobia still  ain't great
Sorry..
That reminds me of the meme
Bruh
I'm odd dw.
The account age
Why did that actually make it feel Creepy
My goal is to never make an account

One of the many laws of the universe

If it wasn't for this server. I wouldn't be in a good position. I'd be around. Bad people

Bad parents. Gotta hate em.
I had a friend who was "afraid of black People" I stopped being that person's friend
Live*
It's stuff like this that reminds me. I wouldn't like a day in any other time period
Guessing you went for a dip. It felt gross. And Dried it off
I think I watched an ep or two. Then I forgot he existed
Doesn't mean he taps
Thought this was general dunno why
...I hate mister sharpie..
Ahem
Exactly
So cross referencing how I feel about THAT. Yeah..
"I'm afraid of black people" which is. Imo. Pathetic
Because I also know Someone who had a bad experience with a black man
So I don't really...like that excuse? If you get me.
Imma inject myself into this 



I am incapable of romantic attraction to men myself from. Very bad people

But I still understand that's not all men. It can be women. And that people should just be people
A boy to girl. Is a girl.
I just want to be myself without people trying to find ways for it to annoy them..
She has *terrible* trans views. I know that Much
Still kinda...odd.
Ahh.

And says white face
Didn't she say Hermione was black. Even though she chose the actress in the movies specifically
Oh yeah this happened
They're this 
And that
And that that
She keeps going
Thing with jk Rowling is
Fair fair
Then she. Yeah..
I used to like Harry potter
He *
Doesn't have bipolar and refuse meds
*but I got it before it became dormant*
Yes they're so close mushed. And aspergers is essentially a dormant diagnosis
Here's the thing though
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
But hey. You're you. There's nothing wrong with you.
There's so much more stigma with autism then Asperger's
They're similar in ways but
You know. I always did think I got lucky that I got diagnosed with Asperger's then autism.
But nope. Happened in Dublin a few weeks ago
31° anywhere in Ireland sounds like a joke to me still
The only other thing I can thinking of is
Mateing and

God that's funny

In today's language.
It was good to be called a moth
So.
Wait.
Just you know. Whole being trans thing
Oh I did too.
<:PadpaWat:803822882190262323>
If ya like Harry potter. More power to you
Personally it's hard to like a series made by someone who despises a large part of my identity but
I'll never understand how someone can live such a bored life they choose to hate on others.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Or knew they them has been used in singular contexts since forever
If only they took an English class
<:AinyaSip:699314293862039572>
Some terfs say they don't have pro nouns.
That's fair

Ah yes. You aren't a woman because of your spelling. 

Facts and logic ted talk
. Wat
She's the big cheese
What's that?
Scary
I'd like to have something concrete to say
And if I ever had to explain it for some reason
Feels more secure.
Harder for me or another alter doubt
To be able to get help with it 
To understand it more 
I barely believe my aspergers
**With** a diagnosis (different disorder. Same principle)
Can't be diagnosed with it. So. Fuck me.
Point is.
Osdd and did are nowhere to be found in Ireland
I didn't mean to disrespect anything.
Ok.
What I'm saying is. the closest thing to it. Is far from it.
Well yeah. I don't know a lot about BPD
I mensr borderline personality
I don't mean bipolar
OH
I thought they were related. Sorry.
That's the point.
Matt.
But yeah. Anything I could pirate off him. I would
I don't buy the games. (I'll probably buy that AAA one though. If I'm honest) I like the stories. Just cool lore
Here's the thing
Not the fandom though.
Again. Imma sound like a cringe teenager. And I'm not a fan of Scott cawton but. I still enjoy the franchise if I'm honest
Something relevant about art v author I just thought about
Jesus..
Only BPD
Because Ireland. Doesn't recognize osdd or did.
I can't even prove the family wrong
Just remembered

And yes. People with autism have Brains.
Do I feel mentally sound? Eh..no. not at ALL.
But some do. Just have multiple people.  And we are not damn serial killers
Yeaaah.

They tried to use it as an excuse for her bad too
Are linked
And plurality
They think schizophrenia
I said no. I don't think so.
"could the mom have MPD (it's not a diagnosis around anymore. Outdated)"
I shat myself when the family asked
That reminds me
What are derogatory terms for plural people? I'd. Like to get myself a bit used to them if they exist
I just thought
Never heard honestly

I was even called a spa so. Didn't escape that one
I've heard those in communities a lot
But 
Autistic
Autist 
||Retard||
Slightly related ||Spastic||
"huh. Ass."
Because I've never heard it it's like
I can tell it's meant to be bad
I've never even heard that one
I don't go near 4chan
I don't know why though.
Thing is.
I like the lower stigma and. Ngl. I think I'd feel like I'm mentally worse then I am? (Yes it's down the toilet. Lower exists)
That's the **point**
Y'all don't understand
I got lucky imo
Aspergers: oh ass burgers. Oh what's that?
Autism: ||fucking retard. You're autistic. Brain dead.||
So I have way less stigma on my hands
I said 7 because I didn't feel like being shouted at if I said any lower
Now. I don't learn quick. I realized I was trans at 12.
But I do think a lot of young people would be able to reasonably guess. 
Wouldn't say I'd go as low as three but. Maybe like, 7?
I mean. I'd presume so?
Ohhh.
I can get hormones. But it's fully expected out of my pocket. So I can't *unless* I get disability.
Lucky shat.
I know one rich person   got hormones at 11 or 12. Lucky
I would've done anything for hormones at 12.

Wanna know how I learnt? 
Blond girl called me a spastic 
Didn't understand
I know what it means now..
Yeah. Spastic is a slur here
Anyways.
Idk how to spell it..
Speratic*
Spermatic?
Yeah
Fair
I might shower late. Or early. 
Clothes. Well. Yeah. But when I wake up is. A guess.
Nope

Yeaaah..
We usually wait till night.
We find it hard to shower a lot.
The only time that's worked for us is our knee stretches
Ehh
I like how symphogear is
That sounds like a brutal way to go..

But we're surrounded by understanding People now
I had kinda given up on myself. No one believed in us
I can't say I'm exactly..happy. but! 
Starting Jan 14.  To now and future. I'm doing way way better
I'm glad for that!
^
Suits her then
Awhhhh
<a:PetTheMelua:753649928256880752>
Hi Mel!
I'd like to chat with her more actually. Just never know what about
She's been in my corner a few times. Wouldn't be as mentally well as I am without her
She's really kind
I've been here..since Jan 14 I think? And. If I'm honest. This server is the main social group I have. A place I genuinely consider as family ~~and Mel would make a kickass big sis~~
Here's it's like  "ah! I should probably check up on the gear family"

Other places: "I wonder what random selection of people I'll see today"
You're a cool person
It's easier to feel more friendly and family like in a server when it's the same 25ish people
Very tight knit
It's not dead by any means. But it's not bursting with people to the point people shy off
You're a great friend
I can promise you they whisper only the  empty wrong sentences
The only thing that matters. Is that your angels are able to outweigh the demons. And I can promise you've that in excess
You can't change the past. Only mold the future
You're a good friend Matt
Low-key wondering if I've been accidentally disrespecting Chinese culture now
I actually didn't know it was a cultural thing at all till...now
The water of the womb doesn't run as thick as the blood of the covenant
I've gotten way better advice, care, and support from online people. What's the quote..
So it's not a big leap in my brain
I just spent so long on the internet I get used to linking friends to family
Google exists for a reason ig
But thanks!
You really do fit a big sis role huh
I'm embarrassed I had to look up the Meaning of precedent
.. Jesus..
Ahh
No)
Uh. Bang bang
What's that
Ohh. Oh.
Minors..?
Its just who he is innit
Kerrik is most definitely an uncle type.
I make tea so often for myself. Is it really that hard for me to pull another cup out
I do that anyways
The goof cousin that's probably the cool kind of teacher,(still has a good noggin)
I wonder how that'd work with youngers. As elders makes more sense for a formal context..
Interesting
A badge of honour
Interesting
You were originally the two big bros. Now you're the rockin cool big NB's
How does that work
Makes sense
Association is a thing ig
I'm pretty sure I've assigned most of the Redditgears a role in my mind
<:kamipray:508684771245948928>
I hate the phone
My Xperia has  some weird article section and I look at it if I'm incredibly bored.
https://www.nme.com/news/music/eminems-adopted-child-comes-out-as-non-binary-3018940
This is what I read
And I kinda feel like that was intentional but don't wanna ponder too hard on it
The article I read segwayed from the non binary reveal to their mom bring suicidal last month
Ya know. That articles nicer. Maybe it's just my mind but
Important
So yeah
My mom went 14 years on it
Welfare is important. I'd probably be homeless without it
I'm Irish.
Damn..glad you're ok
Ahh
Are you ok.
<:MadoHuh_MM:869053883400470578>
I guess..
It's a fucking killer.
What in the ever helling fuck
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/cameron-herrin-prison-tiktok-cult-b1900667.html%3famp
Also may I ask
<:MadoHuh_MM:869053883400470578>
Makes sense
Makes way more sense
Z?
I will say one thing though
It's ruined me trying to change the role colour a few times)
Colour
Hey! Ireland uses the u
How is English dominating online American
Madra:dog
Mala:bag 


I've even mixed them up
I only know two words
I have no Reason not to know
<:HikariGalaxyBrain:855124221243555860>
Irish  was taught to me since primary infants.
And no
Yeah I'm Irish
I also have aspergers..
It falls out instantly
I can't even learn my countries native language
Problem with that
I want to learn Japanese actually
I have no idea what any of that meant.
<:MadoHuh_MM:869053883400470578> <:MadoHuh_MM:869053883400470578> <:MadoHuh_MM:869053883400470578> <:MadoHuh_MM:869053883400470578> <:MadoHuh_MM:869053883400470578>
So, what did polish man do?
Learn a language isn't a great arguement
Wow.
That's -
Neat.
What's a woman? Those things on pillows?
it'll turn heads
well yeah. but people see lewd drawings of what looks like a little girl
You know what I mean though. They'd say the first one
Aren't they the same people to call me || tranny. Trap. Etc||
*Jesus Christ*
What does terf stand for
That sounds like an endless cycle of *HA mine now*
Then I realized I have no clue what terf means
That makes sense Meiyi. I just really didn't understand the convo. So I decided to not comment
Jesus...
That makes sense
Aren't those just incels
I have no ill thoughts of him
He's Always showing his appreciation to people. Being kind. Has great art. Initiates conversation himself.
These feel like inner demons
I can 100% say he is from what I've seen of him
You're a good person Matt. I believe it.
But they are
If friends weren't for that. We would've broke that rule.
No.
That's all I can say
No.
We believe in you
You don't know that, they are your inner demons. And we'll always care for you. You're being very obvious on wanting to put a good foot first. And you're judging yourself. These are all qualities of a good person. You aren't hostile or cynical. Maybe you've lashed. They happen, but I know they're by accident. Something that wouldn't happen again
We're here for you Matt
Exactly
We try to be as ourselves as possible. Because hey, I want people to love *me* and to enjoy being myself! If they don't like me. Newer people!
Truly cynical people hide that
I think the worry and the fact you are saying is so openly shows you aren't bitter or cynical
What's up?
You're a cool person das
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Airy
I'm usually either on discord. Or just. Lying down on bed
I have to *force myself* to play games or watch shows
But it's kinda in a bad Way because
Honestly yeah
I have to sleep. But stay strong
Intensity
Is it just agitated. Blood boiling. Middle. Rage inducing. Annoyed.
I guess I mean level
That's what matters here
So what kind of angry? And how often
That's really good. I mean that
Good!
Oh yeah stretches!
We'll be sitting in bed feeling bad. And remember
Get some kind of exercise routine morning and night.
Honestly. I never thought I'd advocate for exercise but
Civil
Maybe you just need a civil chat with said person(s) to properly vent it out
That's the thing.
The toxic friend doesn't say that
Also, slowly ease into doing that is something you should do once covid is fully under control
Emotions breed.
Breeding ground. For better or worse
You don't have to love everyone Matt
That happens
Same honestly. 
What I do is: once I start getting actual boiling. Drop the game for an hour
Remember: your perfect you is never done. Always improve yourself when possible. You're not meant to be perfect Matt day  one or year 26. Just your best possible at that day
Just keep trying your best
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
That's the attitude that creates it in the first place
Opinionated: human 
QTA: good to realize now and work on from this point forward
Fair
"how far away are you" 

Hadn't walked this route 
"Uhhh...20 mins"
It has annoyed me every now and then
I mean Cynthia*
No I mean cypher
<:KanataDed:795495319445045298>
I feel like I'm not picking up on sarcasm
Yeah
"I'm about 10 minutes away"
But so does Ireland
I hate to break it to you
So uh. How fast did they seize Afghanistan? And uh. Why do that
So uh. what's Taliban
"he is so fucking powerful, I'm not at a power level to do this alone" they know life isn't an anime right..
Jesus...
Makes sense.
Interesting.
Well yeah. But it's a stupid move on their part in my opinion.
And by that point there's nothing left.
Though I do believe it started like a bootleg patreon. It's not the reason it's alive.
That sounds. Absolutely stupid.

Why would you pull the plug on the ONLY reason that site is known.
*what*
You know. The only reason the sites used.
Didn't only fans already say they're cracking down on adult content a while back.
Honestly sounds interesting
Didn't except to see Garfield memes in serious
That much is obvious <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
It's how I feel rn actually
Not doing anything specific. Just existing
This. A lot of the time I'm not enjoying life. And I'm pretty sure this means financially? But in another way:when you're feeling not safe. And scared. It's nice when you just feel happy and safe.
Yeah.
I'm very happy being a girl personally
What*
I've heard the term a lot but that is a fascist?
I'm talking about the people that are phobic. Thinking pronouns are some thing LGBTQ made up. And saying they don't use pronouns, when they in fact very much do. And want them used.
This all reminds me some people say "Ew I don't use pronouns" even though they do. They just don't know what the fuck a pronoun is
<a:PetTheMelua:753649928256880752>
<:AyuWave:625815039240044585>
Female bobby's exist for example
Well yeah but. They aren't now
Only fans going OG is like the hub becoming YouTube. Just doesn't make sense
So. They realized how bad a decision it is for their platform this late??
*lol*
Makes sense
It's audio quality makes MP3 feel like top end gear
Yeah. Tbf I'm not sad to see it go
I think it has a premium option yeah
Just gotta chin up and show life who's boss!
You'll be alright
Well hey,
Nothing else to it.
As I said:spoilers suck
Yet you want to
You can't watch more
Because the thing that you were really enjoying and into is gone. Leaves a void
That's. My point.
It's purely because they don't like losing pennies.
That'd be a first
Yeah nah
YouTube caring about content creators
Most music will be listened to on YouTube because it doesn't sound like...that.
I mean. Just look at the niteo perks. You go from absolute dog 130k to 380k. So I mean. How much revenue would really be lost?
Not great
Yeah their audio is..
Well that's their problem I'd imagine
Does groovy have a premium option somehow?
I am dumb. Not that dumb.
At first I was like 
"Good. Their fault" then I remember some of these people are single parents. That can ruin peoples lives outside of the one making the dumb decision..
So I'm guessing losing the nsfw has too many cons now
They're back on the grind (pun very much intended) back with the nsfw content
I mean.
Guys. This is getting very accusatory.. maybe we should all take a breather?
Matt..
It's all understandable
These things Bottle up sometimes. And I'm guessing it's a combination of them being your cousin while also showing it can happen to anyone. Even those close. Making you fear for those who are close to you
We all have our moments.
Exactly what Das said. You're a dear friend Matt. You're great!
Glad to see you back Matt<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Help people if you want to. But never feel an obligation, especially if it's hindering your mental health
Your life is your decision. Never forget that
Sometimes you wonder "the fuck I'm getting from this" yet you still want to help
Emotions bottle up Kaiyo
I do think you're brave. I won't say hero because that's became a cop out word for people who do good
.. Jesus
What the hell were they laughing at??
You're a good person for wanting to help in the first place. Which is something you can do *next time* if needed.
You can't change what you didn't do. You can change what you will
What happens happens. Only thing you can do now is: if you get another text. Go help this time
That's what matters
And yet you still want to go help next time
What's pip
Logic. Where.
> taking a vaccine that protects you 


> Instead taking some random yoke that makes you shit your pants
So what is a ivermectin
I call horse shit on that.
..what?
They won't take a vaccine because they dunno what's in it. But will instantly take some dewormer for horses.
So.
But apparently this is livestock dewormer.
I don't know how it didn't click now.
You here*
Glad to have to there
Yeah
And surprisingly it worked. I may have 100 bajillion alters but that's a topic for tomorrow
I purposefully learnt social skills as a big fat fuck off to the school system that makes me out to be someone who can't
I remember the bio mom would randomly say "this person had aspergers'. And I'm 99% sure she made them all up
Yeesh..
This is why I'm not a fan of blood. 

If someone's an anti vax. Don't need to associate! (Unless it's a boss or something but probably wouldn't want him managing you)
Yeah..
We aren't that bad
Super awkward when you have  Asperger's/autism
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
That's a good thing in a way
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I'm guessing that's can't be assed?
You ok armis?
I personally enjoy my discord friends.
Do*
Sorry, will so
It definitely can dampen it. But I wouldn't say its main cause.
In akame it's like "well. It was gonna happen sometime"
You don't expect that character to die
Simple
I love love love NieR. And madoka. But uh. Yeah they've fucked me up with how grimdark they get
I actually have a problem with this now that I ponder
None of the other deaths hit
And I don't know why
I still kinda struggle with that
Makes sense
Discourage from what though..?
*I was about to say sorry to this*
I didn't mean to. Sorry
Basically in layman's what my point was at first was 

"Huh. I didn't realize RKNC went against the grain on my personal views till now"

Directed to no one
Tell me off if I ever cross a line
It just rubs me off the wrong way. I do know they are different things. And I don't think a dead character is the same as a dead person. I wasn't trying to attack you and I hope you're okay
And general media.
And movie.
Tbf their general game policy is still extremely strict
Jesus..
I think it's just. **A very bad idea** because it's still a whip emote
In a BLM event.
I don't believe it's Malicious just. You'd think they'd be checking everything for a blm event
I believe gaming too
Safe
I love winter
Damn
Yeah..
It makes a *way too noticeable* difference in my mood
Yeah.. I just
But once it's dark. I feel way better
I always feel so. Drained. And tired. And way more depressed
Question. Is it normal to dread the sun?
I wish her good health
I don't even wanna know what Ireland would put down.
This actually scared me. Seeing how the %'s still feel very low..
Damn
I do hope your sis is alright.
I never understood what people get out of not accepting climate change.
..I do hope for her health, this is probably very hard news on you. So I also hope for your mental well-being. Please try to look hopeful. It's hard I know. But in these times it's all we can do. Stay safe.
What the fuck.
Holy...
Thing is. It's not even because games are "the devil. Gosh darn new thing" because I'm pretty sure they're like this with movies and TV.
That's what I thought from the last time this was brought up. But this feels more broad..
This just makes me go "yeesh".
Either she:
 just doesn't want offspring and was r*ped. 
Not financially stable 
Or a combo. Or smth I haven't thought of
Look. If she doesn't want the kid. Chances are living there is gonna be bad
I never understood this
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
Welp. Knew there was a catch. Shit.
Though I guess they only care on public opinion
"wowie. I sure do feel guilty.. I need to deny this"

> Proceeds to literally make it worse
You still have the possibility of consequence
Tis not the point
Free speech doesn't mean free of consequences
So her husband gets a say but not her???
..the fuck
Here's the thing.
Oh
What does take action mean.
What if someone gets framed as bad.
A world leader who doesn't follow his own rules obviously doesn't respect or believe in them
How are people meant to listen to you if you aren't even listening to you.
> Medical choice is a human right 

Aren't those the same kinda people who are against trans people getting hormones.
Sorry princess
I'm very happy for you ice rink. I'm glad she's doing better
Why do they care if a character is slightly feminine
This world sucks huh..
What.
What
Electronic drugs.
<:HuTaoWink:837333578228432906>
That thanks goes to you. You're a great friend. I think the exact same. And don't worry about your past okay? You're the Das we all know and love now!
<:EulaPray:837057846142959647>
Good thing Nag is there. There's at least one interesting cool person
That's fair
How?
Strong power rock
Well I mean. ||his gnosis stone was taken. So I doubt he was planned to never be touched on again||
But I think his normal outfit really doesn't look girly at all
Huh. Yeah that'll probably be hit if anything will...
I have never gagged so hard in my life.
Here's the problem. They shouldn't have it as a problem in the first place but.

Since when was venti gay
Miku check general
And yet tons of people care about both of you now.
I know right now they're extremely strict
What were airports like before 9/11?
Slightly off topic but same tragedy
I can't really blame him for that.
Twin towers I think
Just that a plane went through two buildings
But no details.
I know *of* it.
9/11 deaths are sad and horrible and so are Hurricane deaths.
The past is important to remember. As long as you don't blame the people of the country who probably weren't even born when it happened.
Apparently you can with emu's.
What's imperialism
Hm
No fortune telling
So I guess sonic saying "baldy mcNoseHair' is just too much for Chinese kids
No provoking the opponent
Well das
Glad you're still around
I think there's more but I don't know it.
What happened apart from the plane and building?
There's no ifs here.  You're living.
Like. Jesus man.
We watched the same video Huh
I hope no one seriously believes that's the right call
I have no clue what an Anglo Saxon is.
*then why did I ask*
What's...anglocide?
Does sans mean excluding?
That's odd
Are clicks worth that much?
Like. **God** I can feel it thinking about it.
Filing teeth is what gets me actually
Filing teeth.
Let's see here
Vandalism.

This coupled with the LGBT free-zones makes me terrified of Poland
That looks like something a 10 year old that just discovered Ben shapiro would commission

Is there any way to actually change this system or will we just be stuck with an economic system that helps corruption
Fair
Probably not correctly though.
But hasn't communism been tried..
Fair
What is?
I know capitalism isn't great but
Can't remember where
I heard it somewhere
I heard that
> Someone talks about capitalism or communism
And armis appears
Sounds like apple
So Americans just have a worse product?
Are they still a pain?
Are the EU able to force it anyways?
Interesting
May they rest in peace
Ah. Noted
I don't know
Short answer: corruption and genuine accidents. 

Long answer: too long
I feel stuck because I see all these problems, but there's no way in hell I can actually change anything meaningfully. <:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
Interesting!
I thought we were talking about those armours where it's practically a bikini
But like. the stomach.
Huh?
Skimpy body armour for a warrior makes no sense for protection. 

I think it's alright for something to look nice. As long as it's not so blatantly obvious it's there for appeal
It is sexualised. can't argue that.
Hm...I'll admit it is weird for a character to just straight up be in lingerie.
The way the family is talking..makes it seem guaranteed
so I dont know if that means the money is likely or..
<:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>
yeah no. i'll get my own sim and open my own

so I dunno if this is good
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
makes sense
yeah I don't really see anything serious..
You're a good friend armis. Please don't end yourself.
I dunno if this factors but. If I'm just going to the shops 5 minutes away I'm told to just leave it unlocked
Poor thing..
Keep the dog safe, give him a cuddle. You're obviously a good owner.

Surprisingly enough. That's where ours were. And we're happy now

But it was for us:
And. This probably ISN'T your problem
Say something good!
But if you catch yourself saying something bad about yourself
And well. You'll think you don't deserve to say it to yourself
This'll sound. Odd
Yeah that makes sense!
Promise
You're worthy of praise, love, friendship
That's the "well. Surely they can't be kind to ME of all people" problem.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
no problem! we think you're cool
does it seem right in a different lense
my only thought is. if you think "did I do the right thing?" try imagine someone else doing that action
that makes sense. No need to be sorry though.
How come?
What's going on?
ah, phew
also..have you blocked us or...is it a blanket thing
are you alright
Are you ok?
jesus..
That's what I'm kinda boggled by.
That's banned?
But.  Deciding between right and wrong?
Like...I knew China didn't like glorification of other countries (I think I heard that) effeminate men. Homosexuality. Etc
i dunno why
I never had plans to go to china but. these things are scary to me.

Pokémon Y is 3
I think the gambling aspect is why it's here
Was 2013 less lax with game gambling?
Misread
The only fake gambling I can think of
Wait.
To be fair. That started in gen 3
Alright.
Oh I thought it was unite.
Does Pokémon not even have the irl aspect?
So like
I've gotten used to ignoring them
Can't be that bad
50 dollars? Jesus. Oh it's 30k gems?
I remember hearing somewhere the reason you spend real life money to use *fake money* in game. Is so that there's a disconnect between spending money
Mechanics that draw significant parallels to gambling, usually by giving money for a chance at a high tier product.
Make it so any game with the gambling mechanics rating needs to be 17+-18+ rating.
Gambling mechanics
3. Ripe age for gambling I'd say
Pretty sure all the players think like that though.

A dlc pack?
I remember my lil cousin saying why he thinks it's worth it
In a yearly release product
Which doesn't carry over through game
Football game where you are encouraged to roll for cards with more likable players and higher numbers.
It's also predatory gambling
Everyone knows EA is the pinnacle of gaming rady
Loot boxes. *Literally boxes of loot*
The obvious attempt of removing the word is laughable
but uh. rounds shouldn't be near the workplace
i mean that the prop could've been mistaken for someones lunch knife
but gun rounds.
could be a workers lunch
makes sense
if it was a knife
now
why were rounds even there
but uh
well yeah
how does one accidentally put a real round in a prop. and why was said prop real
That is all.
I was showing that this fake gambling did make a rating bump
No.
Did I ever say that.
Y which doesn't have it - 3.
That is my point.

Wait what -
I never Said to be mean
Oh I don't try be mean myself (I hope) and I don't encourage others to be.  And idk really. Just if we all agreed then things get a lil weird.
And trust me. Good Kind world and murdering bullies don't go hand in hand
It's weird.

I want everyone to be nice and kind and try their hardest to be that.


But I also agree that without said conflicts. A depth is lost
But that's not really the topic is it.
Laws are important
There's a big difference between, scolding, expelling, suspending. Taking away some privileges




And murder.
What do you think is worth a life lost
Hectan. How do you quantify bullying. 

That's a question I'm interested in
Even if you did go full dystopian. Do you REALLY think that wouldn't start a rebellion/revolution

what does
To make things slightly better. This was posted in a server I'm in. And looks like a win.
You can be wrong and an asshole without trying to abolish a group of people
They always display a really weird general outlook too. 

Instead of thinking: this is a bad view. How can we change this? 

They immediately think to: let's abolish trans. LGB alliance time


This makes everything go irrelevant in my mind
~~Most of us just want to exist without being harassed for things we haven't done~~
**idk what trans people and allies they've found for these other takes though**
That's fair
All of it seems to paint trans people as violent rapists.
I don't like the idea of that being seen as a good take,which opinion?
~~I just feel like a woman?~~

Oh I get it now.

Facebook is rebranding to meta. But the actual social media site is still Facebook
What do they mean by metaverse I wonder
*heh*
As someone who hasn't watched evangelion I'm a lot more confused
I feel like I'm in the next installment of terminator

I can't exactly say it's a smart decision to throw away such a big name though.
(It does)
Will think Facebook sounds ridiculous
But people who grow up on the platform with it called meta
At first yeah. And I can definitely see some short term problems from people looking for Facebook and finding some weird site called "meta"
To be fair, Facebook isn't exactly a gem of a name
That's. Pretty meta.
Interesting
Company will company
I still dunno how it's legal for apple to put their money in an Irish company to freeze their money but
Oh apple and the like have private companies in Ireland already
Fair enough
Whatever will millionaires do without their 4 mansions (yes yes Elon doesn't like physical possessions ik)
What's happening
did i read that right
uh.
I'd say the factor is believing in God but. Many religions believe in the same God but with slight differences...
can I ask, How do I come off?
that's called being human yeah
another reason I hate political and religious boxes. there's so many nueances but there's a certain belief every box is a certain way
it's probably agnostic, I don't see supporting evidence for religion, but possibilites exist. and closing it all off doesn't feel right to me. so I currently believe there's no god but fully willing to hear anyone out
if i had to put myself in a box
here's the thing
Bias is something I don't like dw
This is my only shot at life, So I should be myself, and the absolute best I can force myself to be
my belief in *that* sense is to just be myself.
whatcha mean?
long as you aren't hurting others, I've no reason to have a problem
I'm not religious but you should just believe what you believe as long as you aren't infringing on anothers (i.e making difficulties for LGBTQ)
what's that???
If god's exist. It's a part of science. If he doesn't. Still science
Science is literally just the pursuit of facts
I mean
Oh no I don't think that

I thought he was a psychology man

Maybe it's that you're happy itself. You're wonder why something isn't going wrong
What was the original point again?
I can't have any other basis then "he seems a lil quirky" because I haven't studied the subject and don't feel like being an ignorant idiot
Unique
Just that this guy seems uh
what do you think people are calling snarky. if you had to guess
it's not so much the definition they're thinking on
and because it's text, your tone can't give clues on intent
nuances are annoying
one feels a lot more snarky and defensive to me
"I didn't do it" "I literally didn't even do that"
it's more so that it's already established on absolute, it's doubling down that strikes people

Obvious problem. Multiple getting CPR. He's singing happily
https://youtu.be/9hIYSHwiHW4
Alrighty.
Maybe don't overpack to the point that people themselves are crushing each other by pack in
So he's just meant to continue the problem until the performance is done???
Which is apparently bad? No clue
They do this form of mosh called ""raging""
And from what I can read
Kinda bad.
I just find continuing to perform when you can see all this happening is uh
**at least stop singing when you realise the problem**
**then just continues singing**
Apparently he could see one of the unconscious, told security to get him out
ahhh.

Apart from money laundering I don't see why it's a thing
I remember Reading the mona Lisa explanation
If it's bad they probably love it.
It's EA.
I wonder if nfts will flop now
Ahhh that makes sense
I'm having a hard time figuring it out but two guesses:

Rich people are bored 
Some cheaty way to increase money
Because with normal crypto. It's a currency. One that doesn't seem smart to me but
*so what's the point*
Are they just rich Pokémon cards
I wonder why
they advertised it as stereotypes.
They're so hard to wrap around
<:MikuHorror:511788482625011713>
please say yes
is this photoshopped
.
These new stuff should make that harder right?
And yeah rug pulled.
People, for some reason, went into it.
Like with the squid game coin
I mean
No no
Those rug pulls should be way harder right?
Oh so like
Uh.
This is messy huh.
I mean. You aren't wrong.
Difference is money/creator
The nft just feels. Weird.
But at least there's something there.
Oh yeah I do get that
You buy an nft and you have this receipt good for you
You can buy digital art and it's yours.
jesus...
can he upsell that?
if ash lets say buys one
so
nft's still boggle me
Pretty sure the floating models in sonic generations art gallery are worth more
Apparently there's a Simpsons one too.

I guess they decided to reintegrate that.

I'm confused
seeing mainstream get into nft's feels fake. but I know it's real.
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
yeah...
Yeah. Fair
Wasn't it already?
really.
cooke run
Yeah.
Which always puts a weird feeling in my tummy
I can't remember much. Just that they really don't like association with trans.
Yeah...
**or else**
Feels good, dunno why.

I think they meant creator
Never thought I'd hear someone in a suit say "this is an anime" and proceed to nerd about it
Uh
Especially with what we've heard.
We've always seen 4chan as "that place online you just shouldn't go to"
huh???
As an avid anti-smoker, not really her business
I'd rather us learn now so that they don't have to act on a frying pan of an earth
All 3 have obvious reasons. **Stated** reasons
Well yes
Yet they won't **tell you. And can't justify**
That makes it specifically bad
Singling it out suggests there's a reason for gaming specifically
You can be addicted to anything
Gaming addiction? Yeah you can be addicted but
The thing is
My guess is old men don't like "these new fangled games"
They admit they can't give a good justification.

The way I've heard it described. Sounds like a sexually harassing frat boy house
My worry is that:what if none of this stops. And  It just means more women fall victim?
Blizzard do be shitty
Does it depend on the severity of the evidence?
Ah.

Chris *They're 6* extra unknowledgable
they aren't even halfway to discord priv's and they expect them to be politically knowledgable
they're trying to justify 6
Well yeah but
My guess is they want this to go through so politicans can exploit to the most exploitable age. kids.
"Politicians talk about rewarding the young for the sacrifices they have made, but our political system does little to incentivise politicians to turn those words into actions. The young can plausibly claim that democracy presently discriminates against them in more ways than one." bitch they're 6
I wish this was The Onion
all they need to do is promise candy if they're voted.
...6? Where did they pull that from
I was able to read it I think. 
Glad a transphobe is suspended
That sounds grossly 90's-00's
Uh...
What does it say
I feel like peta is self projecting
also oh god that's an ugly face
I mean, normal people are just preparing food. PETA is the one who sexualised it. <:AlyThink:815755897321029692>
isn't that winnie the pooh
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
instead most prisons dehumanize the inmates. and give them no privacy (obviously leaving them with no survillence is stupid, I mean prisoner to prisoner. like bathrooms and showers)
makes sense
Imo. prison just sets up minor criminals to break and actually become more major, i.e murder, sexual abuse, etc,  though a lot of prisons are private *And* have a quota to meet. which just sounds terrible.
only the most logical leaps
must be the insulated home
no no
Somehow. I doubt.

Super Mario doesn't pay the bills or food

I  hope you're doing even slightly better. You're a cool guy
This virus just keeps on giving huh <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
The mouse will do anything for a dollar
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
You know. The movie about environmentalism
Wow.
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
"FREE AMERICA NOW"
Nothing like someone who calls himself an innovator smoking weed on podcasts, sex joke  cars names,and his Twitter. Is uh.
Jesus.
For safety stuff. Because he hates yellow
Not road*
I also heard he doesn't use yellow for road safety
The makers are just profiting asshats. The nutbags are people who believe in it.
*yeah*
Eyy ~~it wasn't before?~~
<:HotBanana:702834870430334977>
jesus
Best of luck winglet, I hope your mom will be okay

Don't fucking blame me-
That's just fucking weird
What the
<:AlyThink:815755897321029692>
Ok.
Who's Brandon???
<:DiaThink:446346747204337664>
Could you nft a screenshot of someone tweeting antiNFT stuff I wonder
didn't they fuck over the terraria people for a lil
<:worryEyes:891829326503374918>
<:owoThinking:356735628190416896>
It's basically useless, not much there.
But uh
There's a china specific steam platform
I mean
don't printers do some scummy stuff, like saying everything needs to be refilled but it's just one colour, or not offical ink
<:aiWhatTheFuck:888272569600475167>  imma guess you're joking
<:worryEyes:891829326503374918>
huh
me neither
That looks like it was slapped together in Photoshop in like. 2005. for a college project
<:VanessaWonder:891014261013360680>
I wonder what chaos would erupt if suddenly steams entire playerbase lost access to their games entirely
The nft crowd They don't give a shit on morals,just wanting a quick buck <:KirikaTired:688429723726250054>
Whoever owns the stanlee account has been promoting nfts too
yikes
Can't watch for Nft Replica Replicas
~~yeah it's stupid to me too~~
But don't you want to wash your hands in *style*
<:TheCutestIdol:764153139351781427>
But kept some drug ones
And just like. Tell tumblr to remove some normal tags
I'm curious what made apple go
What world am I living in
You can't use  girls tag but you can use  ketamime tag
<:KasuShrug:626072720404250669>
Tumbler is seeming incel-y
Anime girl is blocked. Anime boy isn't
They banned **me**
Wait
Seriously though how do you ban the word "girls"
I'm such a rebel
Girls 
Poop
People who love being scammed ig
Oh.
What's QAnon?
I will really miss her, Jesus...I wish her family the best and hope she rests in peace..
Btw, what's the "let's go Brandon" stuff about
How does that work??
<:KasuScared:447427652215898112>
Ikr
The salt is strong
Poor thing

Donated-Van
My Google assistant purely exists to be an annoying missclick
Can I ask what for?
~~I meant the body thing~~
Well. At least she's useful?
Siri is kinda, creepy
<:TheCutestIdol:764153139351781427>
Are you joking matt
<:KasuD:770526249244295188>
The same people who will deny a scientist certified vaccine but will gladly prescribe aunt Margarets essential oils
Pretty sure it'll come to this house
Now the next door neighbors all have COVID
So
<:KasuThink:626072736405389312> Sounds stupid but I feel like someone would try
I wonder if any nft person has tried to sue the creator
yikes
Oh?
But Welp.
Which should not be my first thought
It sounds pretty selfish. But. If the nan dies. I'm worried I know exactly where I'd be placed.
She will be
The cousin had multiple tests. Only the just before flight one was positive
She didn't know
I'm not worried for my safety but like. I may not like my family. But nan is *old*
<:KasuShrug:626072720404250669>
Soo.
But I know it's really in the family now
Provinces and counties
We don't have states
No one's sure what to do because nans close contact <a:ayuTspin:690590781869785109>
And the plan was for her kids to be dropped at nans
Which gets kinda messy as, one cousin was going for a  flight. And one of my aunt's is going to Poland
<:KasuScared:447427652215898112>
*hoo boy* Welp. Two cousins and one of their girlfriends have COVID. My elderly nan is a close contact of one cousin too
Jesus.
<:KasuScared:447427652215898112>
So I can't blame them
I probably would've assumed the same
To be fair
I mean
Obv
They want the American one
No no silly
We need to end women's right to vote? It's not the 1800's
Uh.
What's suffrage
I wonder how many Computers would shit themselves if we changed systems
That's when you **ask**
Well yeah but
Not realising it's the standard system (western)
Basically: they saw Arabic and thought "bad"
It hurt itself in its confusion
Oh I know that. Just it feels pretty real with my next door neighbor being in an ambulance (I always believed in it. But it's extra driven home now)
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> stay cozy
I'm not scared. but it feels weird for it to be so close
I hate the "man" that's associated with that phrase.
God I hate hearing "facts and logic"
Gottem.
That's fair lol
Wait what
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
She probably thinks star wars was based on a true story
Clearly doesn't read enough...
<:AmberSad:833142007110303754> Huh
She...**believes** in a Jewish space laser
So when's the space laser 2 coming out solo?
Is this a comic???
What
A Jewish space laser
Ahh
Who's that
Doesn't mean you should have to / want to
Almost everything you can do for fun can probably make money if you try hard enough
Exactly
Same concept.
Should every person who plays sport go pro?
Phara
Which I think Is cool.
This breaks TOS xx
Hope you're ok <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
How is this a real political ad
It isn't.
https://youtube.com/shorts/bPHe46nspCo?feature=share
But for a hot sec I thought this was satire.
This is probably really old
especially if very clickable
I have never heard of "intelligencer"
Ahh
I thought it was artificial scarcity but maybe I misread
What the fuck.
Still scummy.
I'm glad she's stable and recovering though...

what is a SJW again, I know the abbreviated meaning but, nothing past: social justice warrior
And how does this change that?
> keep your identity in check

> The internet.

I don't know much about Blockchain but it's weird to think of a world where zuckers doesn't know everyone's exact blood type weight height and SSN
I don't know much about this. But do nfts/crypto need to run on big servers? 
Because I know Amazon Web services is a gigantic chunk of that
Nfting an nft
I think what really makes it all look stupid to me is the **existence** of nft mints (I think it's called that)
Does anyone remember the crypto that was named almost 1-1 after a UK charity that turned out to be a rug pull
Damn.
Booker?
Buzz word
is this a shitpost they did?
what.
Damn...
Be safe
how do some people actually believe those takes.
sadly no way he meant 18+
that's pedo speak miku
> should be more than enough
isn't it really environmentally damaging too
I still don't get how people think nfts do good
so at least they're safe
pretty sure you can't
to be fair
damn
I think they're important
Stay warm and cozy
Please stay safe Lily. <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
They're character selecting you
Anywho
Kinda wish they didn't
Your parents literally decided "yeah this"
But the other way
You can feel like it's because *you are*
No?
Your parents basically character creatored you
How would you feel talented?
I hate the idea of this
Even if it's not as much as cousins. They do exist
<:YuuThink:676467138617147403>
But the problem is. How should people treat the minority of sibling cases
People probably think I've a gross take:
As long as you don't procreate and there's no funky gap. I honestly don't mind what brothers  you cuddle.
> great video tbh
is great
this
??????
The exceptions are what I'm worried about...
Ah
Is utero = uterus
Can't wait for Karen's to try make scientist's remove GAY from everyone's genes (gay is not genetics)
And the world sure has those
Thank God.
I now hate the idea 10fold what I did before
They exist.
You're this. This. This. You'll do this this this for me.
I'm not even delving into that
Yuck.
Being "designed" makes me feel sick
I just hate the idea of giving abusive parents even more tools. I don't trust parents to not be malice about it.
Thanks vyn
There are enough parents thinking they can plan out their child's lives to the exact second without letting them think they've more of a say in it.
If my real reason wants to be known.
I just don't like the idea of being a puppet
I am not that kinda girl. Don't.
Don't.
I mean in the future
Anywho. I gotta shower.
And I hate the idea of being tampered with.
I hate that
I hope they're helping!
Summer drains all life
Winter we feel pretty okay/good
We're the opposite
Birds
Bureau

Really 
Damn 
Stealthy
Meant to make us believe
What if **you're** a robot
O-oh
Maybe Romans like that idk
What
Some things never change lol
Gotta love how humans can  frame a crime on an innocent person just so the prison can get their qouta as they're private
Even then don't be an asshole
Yep
Yeah
*get vaxxed people*
Which oddly helped me
I have a weird relationship with. It's horrible but it also showed the worst in people
Covid
Shit heads
Annnnd
You have the most pure. Amazing people.
That's why people are interesting
I don't get how anyone can be ok saying that
> most justified racist
What
..
Yikes

please tell me that's the onion
what the actual living fuck
.
Why do the summer months suck all life from us
Now that I'm reminded
So uh
Jesus
What kind of edge Lord
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
How the fuck did he spin it good.
Uh

Fucking hell
I can't read this. Asking for subscription
I'm not sure if that's everything he said about info. But still a lil...hmm.
You get my idea.
There's a lot of people online you wouldn't want to have your face and full name known to
I don't get how he said it with a straight face
I think it was something to do with "if we're all transparent there's no fear"
But thankfully my class knew it was pretty stupid
"put your full name and face on your social media." I can't remember exactly how he tried to pitch it
That reminds me of a thing some guy at an assembly tried to teach us
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> I hope she'll be ok
even lowering the amount. that money is essential.
I know you can't do much, just. try push as far as safely able to
fuck.
how can a country just let someone act so blatantly manipulative. leaving them unable to do anything.....
I know that. but. fuck
remember that
you did
she didn't make that 200
so please don't
you're under no obligation to follow through
"if you spend money on this. just be my wallet at that point"
she's very clearly saying
she's not even hiding behind food or rent
Ten
What if nft people try pull that. They can't. But what if they try
That a photographer did
You know celebs get in trouble if they post a photo they didn't take
I've a worry
Now I'm thinking about company's like Disney that are doing theatre only releases
And more fuel
Leaving and coming back could absolutely make the situation 1000x worse
Depending how what way they leave
Yikes
Huh
I uh.
what a weird timeline
Glad you're ok
Stay safe
Stay safe
I'm glad you're ok
Good to know there's a chance...
I don't know what to think.
Fuck.
He probably got the note too
Knowing how close they are
I dm'd li already. No response from them
For when your yacht needs a vacation
Good luck
*who does she think she's fooling about big bucks from delivery jobs*
I get that
that's not the confusing part
I really have to wonder what goes through her mind saying that
Exactly
I can't imagine someone making big bucks on any kind of delivery Job
What
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Which is weird to read about, when it's politics.
The article said it was good for a first try
But hopefully Ten won't have to. Hopefully.
Mentally soothing
If you're already at the stage of  trying to end it all. Imprisoning for a year isn't exactly
Which. In my opinion. Is still pretty dumb
I doubt they'd actually do so
Reading a reddit thing on this. Really shows how bad this is
God I hope this doesn't pass
I don't know if I'm more scared of the LGBT suppression or encryption being eliminated
You can do this
Because gilva got almost..3k copyright things. Right?
I wonder if this is about mark or more about gilva
How the turn tables
Huh
That'd be a story to tell.
Damn..
You met guy fieri?
I know it doesn't mean much,but I hope they will be okay
God I just heard about this.
still horrible.
They... Targeted a kindergarten and orphanage? Please say I'm misreading. That's horrid.
Just in case
We want to make sure we're fairly far into transition
This is why, if we ever try to get into content creation
I've no idea then. Because it sounds like an easy way to be caught when you're not ready if you tell them they just have to drive
My only guess is, maybe a lot of soldiers really didn't want to be drafted. and Putin could've thought it'd be incentive to make it simple this way
It's putin, take a guess
The more sanctions. The worse the Russian economy gets
My only thoughts would be
How will Putin ever survive without seeing how it ends?
Google says Feb 2014
What a weird timeline
What?
Isn't there a thing where a woman in the old days would drop a handkerchief near a man she likes, so that the man (thinking he could be chivalrous) picks it up and gives it to her, starting a conversation
He doesn't hide his feelings
That's what makes it grotesque
Well yes
Which terrifies me
Doesn't the us (and other countries) have **private jails** that have **quota's**
That sounds stupid...
> Some took plea deals, admitting to stealing cars they didn’t steal, 


Why would you admit you did something you didn't
How stereotypical will it be
Nintendo games just go on sale way less
From what I know
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-children-hospice-z-ukraine-b2031341.html%3famp
Even mean
What does 
> Allow calls for violence against Russians
But in some countries it's flat out illegal. So I'd understand those region accounts not doing so
I'm not saying it's okay
So they can't really complain there
Not contacting them would technically be exactly what they just asked for
And remember. They did ask for "no troublemaker to surround us". You aren't one, but if they think you are
If all they can do if you feel ||suicidal|| is kindergarten threats...
Ten. This should be a reminder these are not people you should be around. 

You almost took your life, spilled your heart out to people. But they just call you a troublemaker
Yikes. There's not much the family can do if he literally signed a two year contract... <:worry3:759269416407269436>

I hope she rests in peace.
I'm. Not really sure what to say.
Jesus...
I hope they're ok.
Shocker
Apparently nestle hasn't stopped operations in Russia
Again, my condolences.
If that's what you meant
She was in the symphogear emote server but isn't now
My guess anyway.
I think that was just planning on Gwyns part...
That was gone around when I learnt about it yesterday. And her name is dashes so...
probably couldn't keep up with bot costs.
from what I know, she had some financial problems.
I can't do much, but I can lend an ear and shoulder.
Are laptops gay
They know lank perfectly
Apparently I'm a Karen

I think google has no clue who I am
Or talk about it

I turned all personalized ads off and

All the women want me and apparently a ton of lawsuit compensations
I'm curious what's in my spam
I'm really glad
if everyone thought the same thing I'd worry
the fact you have the opinion is pretty healthy
I'm glad!
I hope you're doing well solo
I don't think it's a perfect server, but it *is* a server I love and cherish (including the people inside it)
is everyone doing okay?
see ya
I thought they were different drugs
Oh-
Wait are they the same thing
Smh
Obviously they want to legalize weed
That's a weird name
Dignity?
Oh neat
I don't know what that means -
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
You just need to figure it out, which is okay to take a while to think on
Then it wasn't a waste of time doing that hobby
Doing one thing over and over will break you
You should probably pick up something else so you can alternate between your hobbies
It sounds like your problem is burn out
Awh man <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
A lot of women are in your area
I don't think you are, and I hope you feel better eventually. We'd much rather see you heal and figure yourself out than you bring a bot online
You are!
You're a great friend imo

2: isn't there an uh. war. which you'd think would be on his mind, instead of jk rowling
Guess so
For as long as I knew the word republican my Brain has always thought of them and LGBTQ as oil and water
That's actually neat
Huh
I definitely should
I don't keep up with Irish politics either. It all looks tiring to me
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
I would never have guessed that spelling
The taunistah
I can spell that
Yes I'm Irish
All I know is that our main man (I can't fucking spell that big title) is gay. Which is probably good for me
Probably yeah
Ahh
I still don't know what a torie is. Isn't it some political group in England?
Ahh
isn't boycotting literally just not using a service or product because of something you don't agree with. sounds similar
I don't like the idea of a transphobe having a voice personally
wait what
I'm still a lil embarrassed that I know essentially no Irish
The Craic
I know one of those 3 gets majority 90% of the time
Hi armis
Yes that!
But I don't
That'd make sense
Oh apparently it's a Ukrainian
Maybe I'm just an idiot but. 
Is that a misspelling of Biden or is there really an important American named Blinken

that's a creepy thought
also what defines knowing russian, what level of fluency do you need?

General discussion huh
wasn't that because a *lot* of stuff, like government pc's doing things that really can't go off for long, were on it?
there's also the fact you now emulate a lot of stuff, so staying on 10 instead of 11 for a while is a better move regardless
same
well there's that, but how would you properly optimize linux?
make's sense honestly
branches on branches right?
and remember, what about games that aren't on steam <:worry3:759269416407269436>
I don't think proton is *quite* there yet?
reminding me of how i Want to switch to linux but I play way too many games, and it looks a tad too complicated
wasn't there something about finding code for file explorer ads?
Saying this really fucking quickly.(I should have my phone. Idk might not though) I'll probably be going to an emergency a&e visit for an assessment soonish today. So if you see me go silent for a while, you know why I guess. You can ask kerrik for details.

the worry is if it's that other thing, the ransomware.
change your discord password at min.
my guess is **hopefully** just a token grabber, still bad but I'd say it's better.
did you get that text file that the article brings up?
this seems like full blown ransomware.
the try my game scam I know, is a token logger
apparently not. my advice won't help then. er...
is this the "discord try my game" scam?
I'm pretty sure we had to read or watch the movie in primary...I *think*

Do EU countries have to defend each other?
> The clause in Article 42 of the 2009 Treaty requires “other EU countries to come to the support and aid, with all possible means, of a member state under armed attack,” she said. The exact nature of the EU's military solidarity — which is similar to, and more recent than, NATO's Article 5 — remains vague

What was he claiming? Guessing pretty bad stuff judging by lawsuits, and it being Alex Jones.
I'm guessing it's a thing of "does it preserve more life in the long run?" (Not condoning anything)
Thinking war crimes are gross, is kinda the point yes
Are we still talking about math
> In 2021, DeSantis banned the teaching of critical race theory, which he described as "the theory that racism is not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white person."
It's probably a wild card no one has guessed.
It's florida so.
it's...math?

there are private places you can go to
Ireland has public like I use. but
that...is how some places work yes?
So I'd hope private isn't that slow
I don't know about private. But in ireland, my public waiting list for hormones (still have to wait for my appointments and apparently therapy sessions. but aside from that) I reached the top of the list in 16 months
Ah yes, I'll cover up being gay with something more taboo

Then I see this stuff and suddenly feel 40% more grateful
Sometimes I get sad about transphobia and how slow everything is here
I mean. I wouldn't call the UK and US devoid of corruption. They ain't! But neither is China.
I think
That's a sentence
Easier said than done. But it's possible
Now all you've to do is figure out how to let go more, and enjoy the future
I'm proud of you for being able to see this problem and show a want to change it
Tried to do it to me recently too. Like a week or two ago
Yeah, can't remember who though
I remember reading one of the main guys of reddits threads that Mel linked. And that was his op too lmao
well yeah
Yeah. terminating an account for personal reasons and not a TOS breach would be...not taken well
they originally weren't gonna, right? that's why they were doing a poison pill strat
I mean
so probably
I looked it up and apparently it means "mass departure"
I wonder if Elon will pull a tumblr
covfefe?
Obviously yeah
for some reason reading he wants to transform twitter into a platform of free speech, makes me imagine twitter turning into a heavily right, homo/transphobic website (I dunno what it's like now)

I thought America and USA were interchangeable
This is embarrassing, I only learnt the difference like. Last week.

All I know about gallium is that one YouTube short where it absolutely crippled the strength of an aluminum baseball bat
I don't know what any of that means.
Haven't used that thing since a long time.
Thankfully I was able to fix that pretty easy
Like, it'd randomly transition into ads, on the damn home screen -
I remember when we absolutely stuffed our Kindle fire with adware viruses
***heh***
it obviously stands for t-rex
huh
so...they're so homophobic they 180 into transitioning people?
feels pretty certain with the other stuff.
transphobia isn't a question
I feel at that point
they're not working for the craic
It's not like people usually work to make money or anything.
That's creepy

Idc *who owns ireland* tbh.
It just sounds like poking a hornets nest.
I mean the citizens themselves.
I hear all the time "united ireland! Unlited ireland!" I'm actually against it because like, Idc who owns the land. and they burn our flags ***this, can't, end, well.***
here's the thing
I know next year I'll be an adult, and I'll have to think about this stuff. but politics just doesn't look like my choice will matter.
I see
instead of it all looking like preschool fights in the yard
I just want the world to think about their fellow man and try to actually improve the world around them, even if it's flawed
that sounds scarring
what
it's still sad
jesus.
From everything you've said, it sounds like people are treating these like teams that want to win, instead of actual ideas, opinions, and empathy.
I feel like trying to push an agenda (like transphobia) is a mockery to those who died?
Setting aside my bias as a trans person
Jesus.
what
https://c.tenor.com/GgmPs3PcUukAAAAM/okey-dokey-donald-duck.gif
Uh
makes sense
sorry if it's a dumb question
feels important to know so thought I'd ask
don't you need citizenship to vote?
what're their political obligations
if someone moves abroad with an irish passport, fully allowed to settle.
question
ikr

especially after seeing the war that's ongoing
I don't think they'll do it though
But I don't *think* they'd slip and trip like russia has
Yeah I know
so it'd be very hard to spin
also our military are peach makers if I remember
at least britain wouldn't shit the bed doing so
Tbf
lmao yeah
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
their
instead of antagonizing a race for no reason?
their friends, family, money, etc
don't they all have something better to worry about?
guns aren't even a thing in ireland except for very special people
<:worry3:759269416407269436>
*fair*
why would people give death threats about being irish?
can I ask
do they even care about england?
irish right
by natives you mean like
<:KasuSip:729373591602331720>
I just hope it happens *next* year. so that I'm far away from the country when it happens
yeah...that's probably true
ik ik.
Just realized I might be too pacifistic.
Yikes
A mom is way more of a hero?
So...
Honestly sounds silly
It's definitely higher than lack of a ping-pong table
how delusional are these people
Culture eraser be like
Barely any of us speak Irish
If you're worried about Ireland
Neat
I don't think trump was blue
welp
Yeah it's kinda...your job?
coupled with russia and ukraine and you have a fucked international economy
america is awfully high on the shootings.
a lot of countries have bad mental health
about what red said)
I feel like a lot of bar charts could prove that wrong...
Anywho. I really hope the situation in america gets better, to the point armed men aren't needed.
yeaah...
no one really gives many damns
physically you're probably fine. mentally/identity wise?
ireland in a nutshell is
Yeah.
even if I'm jumping ship soon
at least physically I'm fully safe I guess.
but hey
Yeah...
*yeah* they're not even taken too seriously.
and mental care/child services?
(camHS is a child hospital)
yeah
you only have camHS on the irish side. and I'm pretty sure surgery has to be abroad.
we don't really have much.
mmm. more so...er...
we're piggy backing
ireland gets a majority of their trans services from *britain* an already bad system.
how to put this
ireland isn't very violent
but when it comes to like...violence?
that kind of thing
Phobias on lgbt 
mental health care/trans care/child protection.
from my POV at least
mainly the problems here are:
guess so.
(the south)
but this all sounds so *out there* to my ears
maybe ireland is a sheltered bubble
the lack of the laws can't be helping anyone...and. idk
*I'm personally pretty happy getting guns is harder*
just the idea of armed men in a school sounds way more *scary* than safe.
I sure think it'd help?
I probably wouldn't have known what a shooting *was* for a long time.
if I wasn't a very online person
not going to lie
wait what
why not just...have better gun laws...
do you guys actually have those people in schools???
> Armed and trained security personnel in schools 


The idea of this is so foreign to me
"thanks for limiting my bodily autonomy"
How
but I'd imagine it drives a bit of it
obviously a big chunk would still exist
Now I'm curious on how many child protective cases could've just *not existed* if abortion laws were good
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
completely disregarding the fact a kid could be raised in a household that really didn't want nor could provide for them
by social status I mean like. if she's still in school
especially when you factor in, rape, social status, age, etc.
so I wasn't sure if 3 was long enough.
on the other hand pregnancy is 9 months usually
on one hand 3 months is a long time
because like
I see
is that good though
idk if 12 weeks is good
> Abortion is permitted in Ireland during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, and later in cases where the pregnant woman's life or health is at risk, or in the cases of a fatal foetal abnormality.
I checked ireland
let women control their bodies.

It's Ukraine and Russia with most of the **world** helping Ukraine.
How did they shove america into this
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
This feels like an easily disproven opinion
But the USSR specifically I haven't seen many people go "yeah! It was good!" Even people for communism seem against it
Yeah
From all the people I know who believe in communism. They don't believe in the USSR at all
Like maybe *communism* could be good. But.
Yikes.
They don't find that creepy even?
They see their leader as **god**.
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>

I mean like
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
how many years until we're fucked?
when it comes to climate change
I agree it doesn't work but...what **would**?
you know what I mean
I should probably care more about politics than I do. as long as it doesn't affect me (i.e like. trans stuff) I just don't really have an interest.
what
and my current stance on capitalism is. *it obviously isn't working good enough.* but I don't have an opinion on what's better as I don't have the education to make a judgement I can trust.
who're they?
Imma guess greed
But only Irish and uk politics really affect them?
So...why care?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299> <:LanzhuConfused:849987913348546570>

quick question

Is feeling like your throat is pulsing like a heart, a panic attack symptom?
Sounds about right
I see
that'll do jack all right
hhh
surely lawyers would be able to fight for the fact that under 1 second of control is not ample enough time to make any meaningful adjustment?
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
What's proud boys
What's that
Creepy
That's like having a handgun in Aldi what
Do Americans really have fucking guns in Walmart?
So like...
I want to try it once. But. I'd never want to own one
That's a lot of power for something you can hide on your person
The idea of a gun is terrifying to me
I've actually never seen a gun irl
Yeah, aunt's husband has one
I'm not completely sure, but in Ireland I think the general public can only have a **hunting** permit/license. And I don't think our general police have guns
Apple news
I'm guessing propaganda
oof.
That's disgusting yeah
Jesus Christ.
What.
Partly both?
I stand corrected.

Still believe in heavy regulations and checks.
Oh I know, I'm just saying guns don't even have a civilian use
> Alfred Nobel, who started the Nobel Peace Prize, ironically invented one of the very first Dynamite in the early 1860s. However, when he witnessed people misuse his creation with the intention to foolishly kill, he regretted his greatest invention.
Even dynamite had a purpose

Huh.
Damn

That still feels insensitive...

<@250295696714891285>
The Nan said I was "scaring" her. And that she'd "scream for help if I have to" 
The Nan said she's going to ring the Gardai and went for her phone. I asked her what is threatening about me wanting to see a photo of the letter about my own identity and she said because she's "scared of what I'm going to of next."

I just want to be a girl. That's all I want. That's all I fucking want. How am I being threatening? I just want to ease my worries by seeing what's in the tavistock letter.
Did they lie to me?
And hell. Tavistoch fucking told us I'll be given an appointment soon.

That was 2-3 months ago.
I got the Nan to finally get the womb donor to call the childrens hospital/tavistoch(idk spelling)

I was told I was at the end of the list a few months ago. Now they're talking about how they're over encumbered with people and referred her to a private place in fucking **Belgium**. Of course the Nan immediately wrote off doing that...ha. but apparently that's where tavistoch trans people have started to be referred to, and that the childrens hospital will ask tavistoch where my place is and I'll learn in the next 2ish days.



What was the fucking list for? And hell. Therapy is **first** so hormones will still be farther away. I just want to be me. And the Irish system is so fucking backed up not only are we piggy backing off an English system. But Belgium. 


I've been in the system since 14-15. I've realized I'm trans since 12. I just...want to be me. And every time I'm given hope it's ripped apart. It's funny how the Nan said we'd learn nothing from calling and got this bombshell. Idk what to even think right now but I kinda want to cry.
But she's the whole reason the Nan hates me. So.
The womb donor. Not Nan.
Maybe the warm water will be there for me.
Imma shower. And.
I
I just gagged and almost made myself sick over this. Welp.
Also uh
Dunno how I'd fake that
I literally am terrified of her and things she touches.
Doubt I'll get one.
After hearing this
And the body is even farther off then.
When am I allowed happiness or even just a body I can call mine
How do I stop all this?
What did I do to deserve this over. And over. And over?
Why me?
I just.
I don't think I even get the fucking choice haha.
...
Haha
When I freak out if I'm near her belongings.
Go on a plane. And hotel. All around an abuser.
Or even if this all goes perfectly on the medical side
Stay an ugly mentally suicidal pre-transitioned girl
So I either
She won't go with me
The Nan said if I have to go to England
Also
It's when I'm told how far I'm in the line and stuff like that.
I guess I'll know if I should be ultra depressed in 2-3 days.
And well. Uh.
I'm very worried though.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
This is either good or bad
She begrudgingly showed it
And getting the right body could be near impossible
I'm called so many things because I want to see something so simple
I can't take it anymore
I just.
I...
Huh
jokes are cool, dark humor can be fun, would rather not have an integral part of my (and others) identities as something to laugh at, for the sake at laughing at trans people.
yikes.
Np
Just say so okay?
I don't know what you were told but. If you need an ear
You doing okay?

What the.
That's gotta be so weird for the idols

Ah yes. 
They're not mature enough for an abortion.

But are to raise a fucking kid?
God this argument. aaa
Vindictive.

My brother in Christ they're stripping the rights of women's away.

What happens if a woman is:
||Raped||
Not suited to be a parent 
Minor 
Not ready. Etc etc.
That surprised me yeah
But yeah. Being upset at this makes a lot of sense
He's usually fairly composed
Damn..
Jesus.
I'm... pretty glad to not be american. I hope it doesn't ripple into the EU.
I see
Because pretty sure straight people do the deed.
What does right to privacy in the bedroom mean in this context?
Right?
They do realize *they* would also lose the right to privacy in the bedroom
It clicked
Oh.
I genuinely don't -
Thanks
Why would anyone care if someone does that?
<:shamiPanic3:692153020703572078>
Privacy in the bedroom? Why would you **want** that overturned
Bruh.
Yikes lmao
Is that correct?
From what I've heard you either have the republicans win and they do things (seems to be usually bad.)
Or democrats win, do nothing,  and the republicans still do their thing
fair point
ahh
what's an anglo

So...was she autistic? (guessing you mean neurotypical)

ohh.
I don't follow

I just want my friend to be happier and not feel so gloomy
I'm not fully sure what to say but, I don't think less of you if you think any of us do.
I'm glad you're here <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>

enjoy the present
focus on what you can
But you can't change that
you're a good friend Das
Just don't tell him about the week in Italy
You can go to my dms if you'd like, or kerriks, or Matt's.
Being unbanned once is already impressive. I don't want that chance to be severed by you spiraling...
Exactly this.

I believe in ya Das. Good luck okay?
Twintail girl runs around the continent hitting things with a big stick to get a promotion
that kinda thing
trash bins on the floor? travellers must've been rummaging.
The thing is...if *anything* bad happens. people usually automatically assume they're travellers.
I've tried to challenge them on why they think like that and they never give a good answer
something bad happens in an irish community? "Must be a traveller"
travellers, 100%
EU feeling kinda free.
With how they seem to be with abortion, trans rights in some states, etc.
I know it's Americas thing but
Less free...
But I never hear people being positive about the traveller community, which is kinda sad.
I'm not saying the NI situation is great.
Makes sense
and others are indifferent, or travellers.
Travellers feel like the a punching bag for when they want someone to blame
honestly want to know who you talk to, when it comes to love
I
In what way
**heavily**
the opinion on travellers is very stigmatized.
I can promise, at least in the counties im usually around
interesting
then they'll say something
they say they don't mind them
<:worry3:759269416407269436>
Like. my own bio family
so...
ROI also hates travellers for some reason.
what
I wanted to make sure I knew what I was talking about and uh
Nvm.
So...
This is 2022.
including myself
I know a few atheist irish people
I'm guessing I don't know
Judging by the fact I'm asking
How does one ilegalize that???
My question is
I know that first part.
How do you make them illegal???
is it? it makes things wet.
h
obviously.
But I was wondering what exactly they ilegalized to make being a traveller *essentially* illegal
Yeah I get that
what
Yeah...
how do people believe stuff like this...
I just don't **get** it.
I know the idea of it is nothing new, Ghost.
I just don't get why people care so much and push blame onto them
Yeah
Thankfully I've common sense, stereotyping is wrong.
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
my family seems to think it's all arranged marriages, rummaging through bins, disrupting neighbours and hurting kids.
The last thing I'd want is a sporadic president that does things on a whim???
Or having a plan
Is incapable of intent
Why would you ever say that you don't think the last president (that I'm pretty sure he liked?) Of the USA
...uh.
I haven't watched him in a fair while...but. it's still sad to think a content creator that's given me a fair few laughs, is now gone.
Jesus. Rest in peace.
Interesting
Oh I c
Just. I don't think this is a picture he'd want to paint about trump?
Oh I get that

Science is literally just the art of figuring out how the world functions and works
It'll just be added science
If magic like fantasy exists
> Quote by Kurt Vonnegut: “Science is magic that works.”
Ah. "Alchemy"
We'd know about it
I feel like if people could do it
What do people even classify as witchcraft
I was just wondering if there were any laws similar to that stuff
I can read
I know
Do actual witchcraft laws exist
Now I'm curious
And feel pretty good about myself
Some days I wonder if I'm too weird. Then I hear stuff like this
Bruh
Or do they think women that can think for themselves are witches like the 1400's
They know that's not real right
Uh
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Get out of there when it's financially viable okay?
I also noticed how they say "transsexual" instead of transgender
Jesus
I can't speak this language but I'm guessing it's bad stuff
Jesus.

If you've clicked anything on those messages, change your password.
Just block
Don't even converse with them
speaking of, I've gotten more and more "modmail" scammers lately
oh there's not a doubt in my mind that's a scam
sorry bud
I'm just saying it reminds me of that form of "hey, people think you did real bad thing, this you?"
oh ye
Sometimes the scam goes "Someone is using your face and having some racist stuff attached to it, is (link scam here) you?"
this is a pretty common scam on discord sadly
probs got token logged and the "hacker" is trying to rope in you too
I see
Weird...
Not everyone fully gets it, people still fall for it. And it's made to make you worry about something being out there, which might make people skip a few mental steps sadly
mhm mhm
(sorry about it looking deep fried, hdr monitor)
that scam thoughtfulpug talked about yesterday seems to be in full swing these days
I hate how I find that funny.
I think they give control for like...one second?
doesn't tesla do some weird fucky thing to push responsibilty onto the driver if the self driving fucks up
Yep
<:momoDeadInside:692148171853398016>
I can already hear the karens talking about removing autism and treating people with it worse
that is morally terrifying.
By genetic engineering...What do you mean?
Which is a pretty dumb and hard to do idea
Skins and weapons that can be used across games
But i know the game idea some places tried was uhh
Idk about consoles
Eyyy

Won't go into it but uh. Yeah. Sometimes you really don't want to be associated with your old last name
Yeah
Pretty! You go girl
What's her name?
Ooo
I feel bad for her and I just learnt her existence 1 millisecond ago

Isn't that elons son
I wanted to say that sounds cool but I don't think that's appropriate
what's gmo
This really urks me but designer children is worse
sorry
Yeah idk what I meant by that
I wonder how many parents think they can make their kids some prodigy through this stuff
*slightly* lighter note
I see
Maybe I pulled that from nowhere but. I swear I remember it
Aren't a lot of disorders (I know this because I've been looking into a D.I.D one) on a basis of only being diagnosed if it's negatively impacting you?
Actually that reminds me
I knew those people would act like that about autisim but. they totally would do the same with LGBTQ people
I was still thinking of my earlier point yeah
<:momoDeadInside:692148171853398016>
they'd definitely do the same with LGBTQ people
Oh god
yep
and think we're hiding a cure/making an agenda when professionals say they can't
I just know certain crowds would fully believe it's possible if they hear about this kinda field
Oh I didn't mean that
Sounds ***fun***
Thought so
Or it's like, wicked expensive to do it
I know they have some form of serious limitation
Isn't the reason that picture nfts are usually just hyperlinks because they can't hold too much data or something
Can't blame you

there's a difference between this
I will say though
Hhh
What use is fucking productivity when there's still starving people
I don't get this...isn't feeding everyone way more important?
The womb donor somehow lived 16 years on social welfare, so it's possible
Can I ask who gene is?
This is... pretty sad timing. Considering Technoblade
yep
Irish officers don't hold guns
Not even on an officer
I've literally never seen a gun
Makes me feel good about Ireland somehow
Also, gun laws are important.
Talking about your grandchildren and then leading into using the word "them" is going to make people think whatever you just said is related to them specifically
Hey uh. What
Jesus fucking Christ

Just like jacksepticeyes dad's death
Guessing this is where this goes.
Malnourished people are too Fucking *weak* to do the labor
And that's kinda fucked
Doesn't a lot of food go to waste because it's considered "not fit for store shelves" (aka it looks wonky)

It's honestly comforting to know that they can't just shoot a piece of metal at mach 2 into my brain hole

The closest to a gun I've seen are videos and nerf guns
But the Gardai? Nah
I think people way higher up own guns

Why do I feel like it takes ***ONE*** bar chart to disprove that

She said she's not doing it tonight
I said I'd type a msg to her of what to ask
When I said we'll have to reword the voice message planned to happen
Fun.
I'll have a panic attack
I can't fucking, do that.
On a plane or ferry. Alone. Probably for multiple days.
...I'll probably need the womb donor near me.
But uh...
(for some reason I need psychology services in the damn UK instead of Ireland)
So. It's good there.
And I'm actually approved for TAS (treatment abroad scheme)
Thankfully it's nothing like a new waiting list
Okay...so. I reread a letter I was worried about (trans stuff) from a month ago
IOTYDWB
<:RuneThinking:341853188585947147>
What's lot
huh
Oof
That's a lot of saxophones
I remember hearing a lot about the tencent thing and then I never heard any hullabaloo about it again
<:RuneThinking:341853188585947147>
Ngl...I thought they were the same thing
Kinda wish they worded that letter better. I only figured that out on my 3rd read weeks apart
I'm very mentally exhausted
So..yeah
So I still need parental consent
(17)
And I'm under 18
<@250295696714891285> btw info
At least trans itself is way better than I thought
then I read the article
For a split second I thought it was ruled for *him* to close it

I don't know how official this is but I heard Texas (idk how this works) is trying to go against Biden for making sure girls can get abortions in a medical emergency
jesus christ...
I'm confused
And less anti LGBTQ laws, is a good thing
Pog
I don't think ireland has it
so idk

they're also talking NI
It didn't even click to me that if they threaten england
Huh
for personalized ads
maybe you've the setting turned off
I mean
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
then it's not really austrailia
ahh
sorry
I actually know nothing about new zealand
guess so
yeah
is by unifying
probably the only way for the misrep of calling all of ireland, UK, to go
I just thought
Really starting to feel that culture erasure moment ig
But uh. *Maybe don't threaten the UK/Ireland, thanks*
huh
Which is weird
pretty much every game I've played where you can pick a country just calls all of ireland in the UK
*looks at games.*
they aren't great
Idk why that took so long to click

I don't see why randomly she'd be worried otherwise
My only guess is, did you say anything weird in the call?
You've the right to privacy
Hate the idea of being seen as something weird to make compromises for, when in a perfect world people would realize it's just who you like
That makes sense, I just...
why do we have to be seperated.
just from where I sit, I find it a lil odd?
I'm not claiming to understand other countries progressions
it's a hotel though

I think it's because of the religious ties to the word, and the idea of being "enlightened" is so weird.
I wasn't digging at you lmao
The word enlightened is so creepy to me. Idk why
Oof

I didn't live back then, no one I knew did all those things. I don't own the land
Is it weird I really feel no attachment to it all

Leaving cert is from about 15-18.
It's not college.
I've a juniors cert. That's it.
I just... people my age are going to college...
As everyone is going and progressing with their lives while I can barely function
So feeling like an idiot has become a new soft spot recently
There are ways to get the junior cert non public but not leaving.
Look I got bullied out before I could get into more leaving cert years. (Transphobia)
I'm Irish, so western.
Wow have things flipped

To the point they can't drive themselves

I know the general idea of what he did, scum
No like
he had a what
Is that when they stormed the capitol? I think it was that
exactly.
I just want to be myself.
exactly
exactly
right?
it'll happen once you stop taking blockers
all it does is *delay* puberty.
from what *I* know
They're trying to say that Blocksers are dangerous
Also, forgive me if I'm an idiot but
nan kept trying to agree with them
worst part
I just want to be happy someday and have the right body
I hate this system, and now they're trying to make it even ***LONGER***
I just.
..
(for different reasons)
which, yeah it probably is but I feel a lot of the former is in that too
or it's already a shit service.
either they cripple an already struggling service that I desperately need, more.
but it's terrifying man
I know
I
https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-gender-clinic-the-tavistock-centre-could-face-legal-action-over-alleged-failings-in-care-12670235
Well NHS, but pretty sure the HSE is talking about it too. (We...both have to interact with that clinc. We piggyback)
I don't want to be some skeptic but. I'm just worried this is to put being trans in a bad light.
When the wait is like 1000% longer than the recc time, how Is it rushed?
It's been going on 18+ months for me (just for waiting list, been in the system longer)
The waiting list recc time is about 8ish weeks
I've been waiting for years just for a peep.
Kinda wondering what system the HSE thinks tavistock is, as uh
Saying that thousands of families have been rushed into treatment
Help, apparently the HSE is made with tavistock (tender clinic)
<:purpleStare:652177509546459146>
And seeing if the dose needs a change
Regularly
Like blood tests
At least for Hormones anyways
You have to get checkups just to make sure everything is working
That is regular and normal yes
My man
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
What...are they upset about???
Here's the thing
Was my attempt at showing "I know it isn't satire, holy shit that's bad"
> because I hope it is
I *wished* it was.
I think it was obvious that I didn't think that
Because I hope it is
I'm just going to assume this is satire
Uh...
Yeah
Yeah. Idk.
It's more so...anyone can be that stupid. So like.
Okay, I think I put it in a bad way
Okay
I wouldn't put it past them
???
Some have literally tried to ***BAN PRONOUNS***
You kid but
I pieced it together with the upper Convo
Oh no like
Makes sense
When I read alphabet I actually assumed Facebook and got really confused
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
No way
Mfw actually paying your employees properly makes them work better
I guess it's just whatever fits
<:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
Idk how I feel about it being covered under a *disability* act
just uh..
sounds like a dub
okay, so...
confused
uh
What
I mean. It's about trans rights. Is the idea of pronouns in their bio that weird <:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
Bruh
What's pragmatic
I, yeah.
Makes sense
Sorry
You always seem to be someone I either disagree with, or you hit the nail scarily on the head
I, yeah
I hope I haven't said anything too bad.
Sorry, my brain is filled with sludge
yeah, that fits
I went to be a girl. not girl*
I guess it's less what I said earlier and
I. no I get that.
I just don't want to be seen as a lesser abnormal girl.
Well, Melua is pretty close so...
?
I think I've a complex on looking "Not normal"
I know. I just.
I feel like the thing I'm thinking makes me a really bad person.
Still feels weird for it to be under the name disability...idk...
No like, that's not what I'm "idk"'ing about
idk.
I.
Huh
really
wait
I *think*
it's not a disability in the sense of being trans but in the sense of the inards being in the wrong shell in the first place
I guess the way I need to see it is
I want hormones, bottom surgery, electrolysis.
sorry.
it's just a part of me
I've a gender dysphoria diagnosis, now that I remember...but like..
my brain hurts
I just want most effective
I wonder, when I get them. Will I get pills
> swallow
Reading minds is probably a war crime, Melua.
Like. A lot.
Constantly wondered if I'm just some defective goods.
I've
It makes sense, why do I feel unease
Like. Yeah that's what my brain thinks
God my brain is weird
Like
God I should stop looking here, whenever I see trans stuff here I get a scare
..
||that's how suicides fucking happen. jesus.||
and then you're detransitioned?
If you're a trans teen, you finally get hormones
I'm just saying
"protect childrens innocence" jesus
<@954207824248967188> this is what happened
Neat
I just got a billion notifications

<@699397350736658513>  these load times
Are you an iphone user
Not for me
Hell they removed the blue tint when you @ someone or do an emote when you're typing it
<@699397350736658513> it's completely different right
Because this isn't something you don't notice lol
Maybe swipe the tab from your phone and go back in?
Like. Discord mobile wasn't *good*, but yesterday sure felt better than this
Even how close channels are together or the size of the stickers screen
*Everything* feels somewhat different
Yeah
It looks completely different for me anyways
And the order is different
There's 7 emotes in my frequently used I've never ever used
Honestly I think there is no order
It's not even funny
It's so shit
why do a good job when a lazy option exists
No wonder the android version is shit
oh yeah das showed this yesterday I think!
pog
this being passed is unlikely since it's coming from her?
so like
ooo
I was pointing to what discord has actually done
<:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
I've news for that lady...
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
"promoting"
My man it's a **sexuality**
Seems really scummy.
Yeah...I saw this
"safeguard the institution of marriage"
Oh god don't remind me about essential oils
Oh, your arm hurts? 🪚
Apparently they have their own website. Idk why I was told that
They don't no
Wonder how that works with the blood stuff
He was meant to have an *operation* around when I left
If he needed one. His family won't give it or allow it. "Impure"
Told me himself
<:GanyuDizzy:809894001205444618>
I hope he's okay fuck
And uh... apparently that religion ain't cool with blood transfers
He had a very bad heart condition
That guy made me sad as uh
He was an interesting dude
That reminds me of a convo I had with a Jehovah's witness irl
Apparently I'm "accepted" and wouldn't be judged. *But* it's still a sin [because Transgender] <:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
Can I ask *why* they think that
Why does anyone *care*
But still
I don't really get it fully either
Fusssel
Literally. Ireland isn't great but looking in here about America has made me feel lucky
Why do people feel like it's their right to say who someone else marries <:shamiDerp:692148934339985447> <:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
There's also the fact some people just **aren't** capable/ready yet
If not, that's disgusting
R*** / way too young
Are there any exemptions for
I didn't actually get his opinion on that
If that's their opinion on blood transfusions. Imagine HRT and anything in that ballpark
I just thought
<:shamiDerp:692148934339985447> <:shamiDerp:692148934339985447> <:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
Why is it a sin
If we can't control it
Making my question
Apparently the reason they accept it is because we can't control who we are, but it's a sin
Your search history probably looks interesting
Mgrr
I was thinking more of a 
**Credits roll**
> Scene

**Her finger twitches**
Which I don't quite understand
Apparently the British are... really fond of her?
Were you expecting a plot twist? <:AlyStare:737943975239090227>
Fair
How the hell did they manage to escape punishment, didn't they basically take a young girl
Wait
Please tell me you made that up
I mainly don't care but it's a lil creepy seeing some of this stuff
And I guess she'd have to *allow* it?
Forgot
But what bad did she do again
I know she's done bad
So like
I wonder if any Irish peeps are celebrating
Makes sense
<:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
It'd be weird if the republic mourned for the death of the queen
Exactly
Lmao
"the queen. Has died."
> Meanwhile, in the corner of the broadcast
***Flossing***
Wym?
Did you see that guy who tried to touch the coffin?
Well yeah, British people. As it's the queen of England
Nope
Wut
My bio Nan is saddened by it. When I brought up royal corruption: "yeah but she didn't do any of that"
Oh I see
Oh hi me and ghost are here
But Portugal is nothing to do with the UK
Wait what
Is it weird I don't get it? It's a rich person of royalty who's probably done her fair share of corruption
Like. I know British people, who have cried, and are mourning.
I
guess they reached 30

I can't remember where but
Though Tate got banned. Hope he lost his presence
Tate and Alex Jones still exist

Whenever I read those two terms I expect homo or transphobia in the next sentence.
I don't trust this thing until it's deep cleaned
Why won't it go into safe mode f me
Still changing them though
So unless the hacker is really into Yuri, my important stuff is safe.
And manga
Thankfully the only unchanged passwords I have left are: 
Genshin (literally can't find out how to change it)
You held a button right
How did you do the restart one
💀
I kinda DON'T want to type my new password in???
As uhh
From boot
I kinda can't
How to boot into safe mode
<@87512939107450880>
?
I'm so sorry for being a fucking idiot.
I saved it
I'm booting my pc up again purely so I can see what passwords need to be changed
Different steam password now
They changed my profile picture and name
Thank god they're slow. Omg.
<@263983345669505025>
Shutting my pc off fully and gonna change everything on phone
The only reason I was able to save my fucking main Gmail was because I had my phone linked and Google recognized it
I have to change all my accounts
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
I've a password manager on my desktop. There's no way they were able to get into it, right?
<@263983345669505025> how bad is a PUP virus
How do I boot into safe mode again
A
And restarted
Updated
Malwarebytes fuckin
I *was* on desktop
Yes
What's pup again
I know
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I'm so sorry for being an idiot I felt bad for "Jake's" friend
Idk
There were more options there
I don't own premium anymore btw. That was free trial
There's 4 detections on a nnkamal scan so far on malware bytes
I changed my discord password justincase
What should I do
And I'm worried now
But I did boot it
It said it was green
I logged out of discord before I checked it, and I did put it through a virus checker link thing
So uh
Jesus.
No viruses, but it found viruses when I checked in normal mode before
<@87512939107450880>
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
But Thankfully I had my fucking phone connected to my Gmail
And my Gmail accounts password was changed

It really won't let me login
That's what I'm doing
Or Gmail
Windows
Email as in like
They got access to ALL OF MY PASSWORDS, so idk
All I know is
But yeah how login
I'm so sorry for being dumb
I don't want to wait all day but I'd take it over all my accounts being swiped
Normal or rookit scan
Also
I really don't know what this means
Yeah
But the new password nor old isn't working
The WiFi adapter is in
What
<@87512939107450880>
Still not recognizing the password
Reassuring much
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Is it safe to login to Windows now
But I mean
I'm terrified
<:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
I'm planning to do a big boy
Oh no
Do I put my adapter for WiFi back in
I'm in the safe mode login page
Restore thing
I did the uh
<@87512939107450880> question
I'm stupid
<:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
What do they think they'll find from a manga account
I'm going to get it back, very easily, but
I'm logged out of mangadex
Lmao
<@87512939107450880>
Windows made one for the 24th
Good news
It wants me to be online
Kinda don't wanna tbh 💀
But
It wants me to login to Windows
Uh
Also
I felt bad and wanted a friend to like me. A
Doomsday
One dumb moment
Mfw I accumulate 144 detections: nothing compromised
I guess the rootkit scan is happening again, when I can boot it
<@87512939107450880> well
It worked when I did restart
Scratch that then

I've seen something similar on YouTube comments
That reminds

Yeah

I remember when my classmate in primary said I was "as straight as a flexible ruler"
Straight

Why can't I just be myself <:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>

Rub crotch???

Do you think normal is fine or is rookit needed
Scared.
I'm just
Sorry Jesus
Do you think it's safe
I want you to choose
What should be my next course of action
I don't know what this means
It's in my history

I quarantined them
What should I do
Big Vroom
I see
Didn't that happen at a concert
Ohhh
What's a crush
I swear they've already done so...
Isn't that what they're already doing
I've like 6 of them
I'm really glad USB-C is fairly standard now
This is...creepy.
Well, yeah.
I believe one of his daughters is a trans girl, btw.
I dunno, he has a lot of kids.
He's...like a child

"Yeah!"
"Deal"
"Actually no!"
"Actually...yes"

Hi!
Sorry for wanting to be myself "Matt"
Jesus.
I see
..ah
What was that last part circles
on fire currently
twitch is the closest but that's streaming, no precorded vids from what I know. and isn't twitch kinda uh...
It has a lot of problems but, there's not exactly much against it.
youtube feels like it'd be ***extremely*** hard to fight with.
hm
whats that
some places have halted ads on twitter which I'm not surprised by
hell I swear I read an article that uh...lemme find it
it was hearing trump say twitter was in "sane hands" and elon saying there won't be life bans, and controversial figures will be back. that makes me think twitter won't be doing so hot for too long
what the fuck is that
I didn't know that, huh
wut
if you're forced to spend the 44b, you might as well try make it profitable-
so, like rick and morty fans saying you need a high IQ to get it, except it's about a billionaire being an idiot
this sounds bad
Yeah
This sounds like an easy way to burn a platform into the ground btw

just had this sent my way
New grave just dropped.
It's evolving, but backwards
> Hours after the takeover by self-declared “free speech absolutist” Musk late Thursday, far-right voices celebrated what they said was their newly-reclaimed right to free speech with posts questioning transgender identity and masks, racial slurs and other derogatory terms.

<:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
Is it bad I still see the verge as that platform that had a guy make a PC wrong
This is just a game to him tbh
The fuck

You're making your cause look bad
<:darkness:961068505782964334>
Pouring milk. Onto the ground. That isn't theirs. And will go sour
But hearing about "activists" like
The Elon musk stuff? Yeah stupid.
This does remind me though
Elon musk is a child who can have worrying tantrums <:phone:961068505829085286>
> they're trying to destroy free speech in America
oh pog
I see
Maybe I misheard, but didn't Saudi Arabia have something to do with 9/11. (If I said something incorrect, I didn't mean to)

Yeah
He must have my best interests at heart
This billionaire smoked weed once, and posts epic doge memes
Oop
Sounds like a villain from fiction
Comedy is legal 🤓
He's just another rich billionaire
Why do Elon fans treat the guy as if he's the second coming
That reminds me
Lmao

what I can say is elon is speedrunning the nosedive of it

Know what I mean?
That is really really serious.
With a human death though.
As I showed there, I'm unsure on the bullying thing. As a lot of them might not be aware/understand (as someone who was heavily bullied. I try to understand how others think) what they're doing and the weight of it.
How to put it...

I mean. Twitter is certainly killing Twitter
Wow
<:JunnaPray:520949060245389313>
Fair enough.
that felt more like an ad for Truth Social at the end.
Twitter has become such a circus even he is having second thoughts.
Apparently Trump said he's not coming back just yet, as he still sees problems with the platform.
Oh, wow.
*wow*
I checked through some posts under that and uh
still weird
oh it's a poll
"unbiased" I see
what
Please let me be me.
I know.
If twitter wasn't doing well before, it looks like Elon is making it nosedive
I'm sorry to hear that.

<:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
a lot of them think my *existence* is political
If someone says they're republican I get worried on their views, mainly because of what I see of their politics in the mainstream
tbf
I'm not sure what you're poking at
I have dumb takes, and people will correct me
This is why people chat and share opinions/understandings of things
Was it a bad take? ...Yes. But that doesn't mean you need to beat yourself up about it.
Should they just stay in their conditions?
So...
I see
Who's the PM again? I've lost track

And that sucks for you, and obviously you'd be mad at that
“The only winning move is not to play.”
I'm just curious on what he expects them to do other than strike
What would be *your* suggested action?
If you don't think they should strike, and that it's selfish
Okay here's a question that might help then. <@457268466429329429>
hm
People like what they like, and don't what they don't.

Can't help anothers opinion
Not my land
I...from a Republics view, think it'd only bring at least the republic more harm short term
she wants unification full stop
Me and the nan have different stances
Well yeah
also NK is an interesting comparison
I think most of us do want Unification, just we care so little that we wouldn't do anything that hurts us (that'd be my stance!)
uh
that was depressing to read
it is a part of the uk
tbf
was that a pun
If anything does skin deep research they'll find out it's a copypasta
I know a lot won't but
Wow
they couldn't slightly change the money and pay rise %??
Yikes
This makes me wonder if I got lucky that I cracked as transgender before puberty
Women can be competitive!
Plot twist, you accidentally attract a hoard of nice guys that'll yell at the woman if your book doesn't immediately get them laid within the day
Ofc ofc
I don't care about cars at all
Yeah that wouldn't impress me
Huh
I actually don't know what they try to do
I swear I remember that
Isn't there a stereotype that women can't drive, even though car insurance companies give lower rates to women because they're deemed safer
I just remembered something ironic
Not too surprised but jarring numbers
Oh wow 70/30 for 2014
I don't see how that's relevant to 10% more women being fired, being a problem?
10% feels like a substantial difference imo
But it's much more common with this way?
There are still people who think women can't do things as good as a man, or treat them like just something nice to look at instead of a person
I am lost
Controversial opinion ||us girls are people||
Oh-
Curveballs
Divas..?
This reminds me of something, strong men can be kinda "imposing" to me. Not their fault at all though.
Women subtle men blunt?
Though I also grew up entirely with women, and cracked early.

So I was able to dodge a lot of the weird societal pressures and mature as a girl to an extent
Oh I knew that
I definitely want to be pretty
I haven't medically transitioned yet (Ireland is dumb) and I am about as physically inclined in fights aa a wet pool noodle
Idk if I'd say testosterone there
Just different things
I can't read the first half of that sentence
Define it
A heinous crime
I just want to exist
Ye
> wants 30 euro 

ask for 50


> Settle for the 30 you wanted
On your 9th tail
(compliment)
I did NOT think you were in your 30's
Oh wow
She's in her 20's I believe
Yeah
That's good
I can think of many things that need BIG things NOW
Isn't there also a small stereotype that women uh...how to put it politely. Climb the corp ladder through "favours"
I want to know what you define as a giant change
Wym by giant changes??
But? Sounds like you agree
That wasn't my point <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
That wasn't my point <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
100, no. But get close
My point is
???
Yikes
If 100 isn't possible, strive for 99.9
This feels like an oxymoron
^
Why do you personally think it fails?
Say your flaws/gripes with the system
I'd trust the American over the polish man, over what the American system is
~~Tons of good things have flaws~~
It feels hard to debate with you, because it falls onto the hands of broad arguments like 
"World can't flip upsidedown" with no examples, or:
"This system is shit" with no suggested alternative
What would you rather
What would you rather..?
What
Such as.
This seems to be your fall back argument
I want a clear cut example of the world flipping
This is still brain numbingly broad
It's often the only hope
Point is:

Big force will outmatch a small one
It's an example
☺️
Sounds like an easy way to get smothered
If one side is coming at you with the force of a truck, should you still do tiny increments against them broom?
Your point being
Arguments will often lead into people feeling dissatisfied and confused, when you bring up points with no clarification nor substance
But I'll say this
-
If you don't want a fire don't bring a match
Was there a specific motive for saying the sentence? Or just something you...said to say.
That's...our question
You say something is shit, without a suggestion on what could be better. That's an argument devoid of substance
Yeah, you haven't been backing up your points at all, just backing up on the original proposition.
...plural?
What
Comments were a pain to read lol
wow
You get what you pay for

Yikes
Fishbears and Fish-welcome sign hybrids 💀
The one ai thing I love is novelai because of dougdoug
<@331908049822547978>

I can imagine that
Wut
"(alpha male)" this is a parody right?
...huh?
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Wow
I've just learnt about yellow checkmarks

Is that legal
That is depressing
It is

Does this guy ever listen to himself
"there's something  wonderful about a man chasing a woman"
I'd sure hope so
Uhm
> chased
Lmao
Oh wow lol
I Found a short clip, was funny to see Elon Musk stammer/stumble on his words from being pressed, and then leaving
What's spaces
Oh
> contains links or usernames
He got bored I guess
https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-control-stock-ceo-alex-stamos-2022-12
Yikes
TW:dog testicles (not joking) 

<@954207824248967188> is this...an Elon Stan?
Lmao
LMAO
What
Speedrunning
So close enough
Autopilot gives you control 1 second before impact or something
I mean
That's lunacy
What
He spent 40b on a dying platform
Elon can't be having fun though, as like
Wait I just thought
Seems it keeps speeding up
Yeah I know but
Is Elon speedrunning twitters death?
So...
"medical emergency"
My immediate thought was
Is that even still up
Wait a minute -
I hope neither of you think I actually thought he meant any of that...
No bias pinky promise
As yes, only the people who actually give me money can answer to me
Not act
I said talk
Remember when Elon was talking about free speech 💀
Omg it's him!!
Snarky, maybe?
Well yeah
Well that's condescending 💀

Oh
Also didn't he say he'd step down ??
The comments..
"you make coffee? So? I can do it myself" ~~then do it yourself~~
<:shamiDerp:692148934339985447>
This oddly reminds me of the "People who work as clerks/waitresses don't deserve a livable minimum wage" when they're the same people that "can't live" without their morning coffee, and like it
"huh. We're gonna run out soon"

"Nah we got time"
Covid:**waves**
"you scratch my back I scratch yours"
Makes sense
I thought people had to pay for their own training
Wait
"Oh they've played Flight Sim? Well that's *basically* a pilot's license"
What if the singular pilot has a heart attack or stroke
Right?
But you could book once, to see if it's a danger to you personally
(actually I can think of a couple over 30's) but anyways, I had covid too. And yeah nothing tasted right, and I vomited a fair bit. But I knew Iwasn't going to die either, just felt very gross
/j
It's not *stealing*, it's nonconsensual borrowing
Sorry
Oops.
I completely forgot I was in this channel
Or something
Shouldn't they give her some kind of conflict, even a moral one? Or like... Somehow her power is suppressed and she needs to find out a way to help with her powers dulled
Makes sense
***looks at superman, whos whole thing is being overpowered***
I mean
What was she like in her movie?
Endgame was the last movie we saw
Just realized I know nothing about Chris Evans
That makes sense
Ahh
Makes sense
"Female actress so let's nitpick"?
Ahh
Wait what
I don't remember well
Isn't captain marvels actress very up her own, if I remember correctly
Tbf
Desperate
Wow that's...
Sorry for your loss
Why should a criminal record be known to your employer? It's about you, and you might (obviously) not want them to know
Speaking of crimes
Exactly
We've... already set a use case for public wage information.
Having wage be known, would make it so you know if you're being treated equally or not (let's say you're both working the same job, same experience, but you get a certain amount less)
Yeah
The only people who benefit from wages being hush hush are employers
Imho
https://deadstate.org/judge-strips-alex-jones-of-bankruptcy-protections-against-1-5-billion-awarded-to-sandy-hook-families/
Idk how legit this is but
I am confused at what this paragraph is trying to say, broom.
/unpessimistic
Unsure of how that can be seen as idealistic
In fact, having it be public knowledge would actually be a safeguard against certain types of corruption
This isn't getting anywhere soon, huh.
Certain things should be public, broom
100kish a month then
Nvm I misread
So about 200k a month?
Oh, hello
They don't want a solution, they want to look better/tax write off.
I don't think saying that adds anything other than unnecessary pessimism.
**checks comments**
I...am naïve.
Oh nice
Red likes to think about Jordan Peterson in his underwear.
As I have no clue who Jordan is!
I am lucky
Thankfully though
It strengthens how I don't like men, and makes me want a pallet cleanser
This debuff buffs lesbians though
My off switch broke
That was fast

Keep the feature until the new one arrives...or...just keep the old one.
They could, just...you know.
This conversation isn't very serious huh
Ahhh, that's why I mentioned it, was curious
~~The only mlp song I know is that oddly strong discord dubstep one~~
Symphogear is awesome yeah
Hihi
I feel like I've forgotten half of the shows I've seen
Oof
That fight was awesome
https://c.tenor.com/FJmaCWemFp4AAAAM/hans-humpty-six-braves.gif
Very good show though
Cliffhanger
Yeah..
Did you like it
<@263983345669505025>
Heh
What in the
I'll give it a listen
This is the most anime thing I've seen
https://c.tenor.com/ng8B9SKsDKsAAAAM/ikki.gif
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
I enjoyed the anime
24 EPs of ***blood***
I'd recommend akame GA kill
Symphogear. 
Akame GA kill 
Rakudai kishi no chavlry 
Mirai Nikki 
And death note
Those are the ones that stand out ig
Well..the only show I've personally seen is symphogear but the system in general..let's see.
Please please please say it's not like eromanga sensei..
What's that
I mean...
I mean..
You sound like Chris Chan
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
I'm an idiot!
I'm no fool!
Well jokes on you!
****no****
Revue something something
Current top contender:
So let's see
His comic girl senses are tingling
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
Tommyinnit being 16 and having a full fledged job, savings,and people who work for him
Haven't heard of that one
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Hamsters refuse to die
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912> <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912> <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
My gay hamster senses are tingling
It's like Spidey sense
**Perfect**
I can smell the gay
I'll check the op for revue tho
Land of the lustrous probably
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Hn
Just kidding I'll watch something else after XV
Symphogear for a third time is in 2-3 weeks silly
XV for a second time
No
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
**that scene**
Two episodes is enough for today because uh
So uh
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
I knew that dw
*ohhh*
Ohhh
Isn't that a swimming anime
Singing girls are hard to top especially with action
But revue is still higher
Looks quite good
Not gonna lie
I'll watch the op
Discord feels slower then internet explorer feck
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
And so am I.
*uhhh*
*oh*
<a:KirikaWham:738960540126150717>
Order in the court <a:KirikaWham:738960540126150717>
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Symphogear would obviously not dare to use the same tropes over and over.
Ohhh.
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Does it have a *story?*
I mean..
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
It felt like I just took something I shouldn't have
I don't know what I just watched tbh.
**what**
Well..
I saw the op just now and uh...
Phew
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
Just incase you say it again
No loris I won't watch gundam btw
Yeah I think I'll watch revue starlight
*he yucky*
If it's anything like Adam from symphogear it's a no
*mostly?*
I think both are tbf
*Recommending a yaoi anime to a lesbian sure is something I didn't expect*
I've never heard about that before. Sounds pretty neat. Probably has a discord server.
What shows are similar to revue starlight?
No it literally says-
*3 movies what*
Which and in what order.

Welp. Guess I'll keep scrolling
My brain mashed two show  names together
I know it's not musical but is it good
And assassin's lily banquet grabbed my attention
I scrolled through pahe.
Hey uh
<:yachiHeh:636922088493416469>
That reminds me
Noted. Hm...
Revue starlight is super gay too.
Does that say Yuri road.
Wait
Well yeah..I guessed that much
It was just nice to have lots of SOL but with action mixed in too.
Hm..
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
*I'm so close to just saying fine k-on*
Ahhh.
Do I need to watch the old ones? I'd rather not..
<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
I wish there were more music action anime..
Oh I've heard of that. It's meant to be good.
I really enjoyed the mixture to be honest.
All seasons
You're talking to the system that watched symphogear in 6 days.
Honestly I might just listen to music for tonight and watch shows tomorrow. Giving the brain a break I guess.
I just didn't enjoy any part of it personally. but that's just me.  You're allowed enjoy it.
Exactly!
Though. we've seen pure trash before so I can't judge it
I felt no need to root for them like at all..
The first episode just didn't click to me
It's probably a good show just not quite for me
Also uh
Oh damn.
One girl sounds suspiciously like aijo Karen..
Anywho I guess I'll start watching
*i wish I knew what that meant.*
What subs are mawaru.
I'm so used to watching it on pahe at this point
I'll watch the shows. Thanks for the offer.
Wait so could I just watch the two shows?
I'm going to ruin my eyeballs for 1.5 hours to watch this tonight.
There's a movie telling revue starlight from Nana's perspective with unseen footage. And a movie for may 21 this year.
Dess!
See ya!
Yeah I knows
Imma try steins gate
But uh
Idk why
Actually
Crackers..
Hm.
First season at least
Already seen

Apart from hot white  hair girl
Yeah
I feel like an ass but
I can tell from the first two EPs
A good scramble of options I say
Fry em. Boil em. Poach em.
That's definitely s flip flappers sound effect
And yeah

Watched two EPs
I'm like 98% certain
Epic
So it wasn't my imagination
Egg

Rough Journeys deserve a happy ending yet life doesn't give that often
That  itches
Like the ending wasn't good
But when a story feels
The journey never triggers me
The weird thing about me is
Though
I'm enjoying wep
*shrug*
Not others
And how I cope and deal
Im talking about me Stella
Oh I know
"people yum"
Straight away
Bear is just
Do the concepts well
Wep seems to actually
No it's just like
So you're never alone
That scene was only made because someone else felt that situation
And it's almost comforting
The way I get over trauma is through fictional relations
But like
Wait really?
Season 2 when
Decent show

So.
I should really rewatch it
I feel like I'm the only person who started with rokka no yuusha
Such a tone change
***IT SURE DID***
**I now understand the content warning fully**
That fills me with hope.
A content warning episode
If this doesn't happen they are cowards.
Necklaces. Neck close up.
It's very enjoyable
Very  true
I'm watching The witch anime about Elaina. Episode 6. Saya is lesbian. Wonder if anything will happen there.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Sounds depressing
Read the description
What's that about
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Like the rakudai kishi no chavlry to sword of a failed knight
Does it have a Japanese looking name
Or maybe it's because it's the dub..
Only 8 eps
ANIMEPAHE HAS THE FUNINATION VERSION
Wuff
Where can I **illegally stream it**
It looks good.
Imma look it up
8 EPs )
Vivy: fluorites eyes song looks interesting
Binge until the brain dies<:AnyoneCanAddEmotes:817992155809054791> <:AnyoneCanAddEmotes:817992155809054791> <:AnyoneCanAddEmotes:817992155809054791> <:AnyoneCanAddEmotes:817992155809054791>
Sounds good but
Gonna keep it in the mind
We've seen angels of death so wouldn't weird us out
*huh*
Any other ideas?
We are kinda picky with how things look. For some reason
<:AnyoneCanAddEmotes:817992155809054791>
Fantasy and girl protagonist preferred
So basically. Either Elaina the witch kinda stuff or...
We want to late night binge
Recommend us anime.
Hey y'all
~~miku is mad that I think sucy is kinda cute~~
I wonder how much of her voice actor lines could go into an abridged version of symphogear
It's freaky to hear maria sans voice from her
Yeah
Ursula reminds me of Fran
Both UK women that probably drink tea
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
She's kinda..**Miku just bonked me oww.**
<:AnyoneCanAddEmotes:817992155809054791>
Cant wait to see stuck up Maria with green hair
They sound way too exact
Well yeah
Diana sounds exactly like Maria San!
Is
WAIT
Edgy girl is probably cuddly
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Witch bullies
Pog
I'll keep it in mind along with vivy fluorites eyes
Oh the show Alexis talked about
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Then I realized how ironic that is
Also I was gonna say. This girl talks a lot about her inspirations and very happy
Not related by blood)

What was that other witch  show
Gogo anime also only has 8
Me don't have tissues
We felt good after binging
With Elaina
Thing is though
We *do* like Yoko taro..
Hm
Something about the paragraph being dumbed down makes it sound odd
I keep imagine witch girl when Maria sings
Now listening to symphogear songs is weird
AHH
I just look for stuff we might like
I don't go seasonal
But can't sleep
Tired
Gonna let the body not concentrate too much
Watched 4 EPs
Such bully names
*splat*
Awesome mine explosion from DEKU
HELL YEAH
What's that?
Uhhhhh

Haven't seen love live either
Other female protagonist. I. Am your roommate 
"NOOOOOOOOO"
So what's it about serious

Kinda cute
https://c.tenor.com/nOqtNN_bS4gAAAAM/anime.gif

<a:AiPat:806431092264796160>
<:AUChrisCry:800522115680829530>
Guess I won't be ranting about NieR in dms
Fuck red hair girl's voice is A
I think not.
Coincidence?
Phonica
I'm guessing her name is honk
<:woawdess:796598780560539699>
I don't remember her name though.
...she's such a Hibiki
They fucking bop
I know they're the rival school but..
Yes I know it's for anyone sick)
oh look covid masks
Food. Ditzy. Loves her school. Similar colour hair. Music anime. Looks like she needs a hug. Sleeps
Poor protagonist... I want to cuddle love live bikki..
...why do I feel like after four seasons and two movies Mizuki will have a music buddy
Oh kneecaps girl
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
... I'm like. 5 minutes in. At least I know for sure I'm a lesbian
<:ZenbuBerserk:796598498182692954>
Presidents/teachers aren't meant to be hot
CUTE WOMEN
Anywho watch time
Interesting
I'll watch one episode. If I like it. Watch it all. If I don't. I get to rant about NieR in your dms
..I'll make a deal
Shit there are Milfs!?!! Why didn't you say so!!!
<:Ver:704169051391524875> <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
||empty. Ouch. Fucking felt that||
Nico's attitude sounds like dog maneuver smells
Did. Purple grope nishi
Sad
Edible?
Looks like food
Cool dude
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I meant you dumdum
Millhi is my waifu
"your legs aren't *that* fat" YOUCH
Why can't they all be best girl
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
"The cards told me I should" and my alphabet soup said I'm a fridge
Honoka is Nico Nico neat
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Honestly. Honoka is best personality so far
SHE EVEN SAYS BANG
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
Immediately thought of Chris
When we reach the top you will!
Maid SONG
<a:blakeshakeOG:738950034867093614>
<:woawdess:796598780560539699>
It was a guarantee wasn't it
To be fair.  We've dreams of being a song writer and idol (which we WILL be. I'll make sure of it!!) And we are a lesbian
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I'm stuck aren't I
You really didn't warn me
I know you warned me but
MAIDS!!! <:rooexcite:491701788282716205>
Josh?
Oh yeah isn't a wep mod like a mega LL fan
How did all the script writers think this was normal third year behaviour
I think I just vomited
"plump"
Interesting
That kinda looks like flip flap
That's like. 3-4 times in 10 minutes
Im cringing pretty hard
She makes 20 year old perverts look like saints
... it's like her catchphrase or something
**bruh**
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
"I'll rub them to my heart's content"
It's finé lite
I knew I recognized someone!
"I'll give your breasts a rub you'll never forget" thought I was on the wrong website
What the FUCK nozomi. Stop GROPING RANDOM PEOPLE
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Blondie annoys me
I don't mind Nico too much now
Songs about right
Idol anime
Halfway through
1 song sung
Ok that was sweet
<:ZenbuBerserk:796598498182692954>
Nico said the thing!!!!
So many pulling strings
Purple girl smells like agenda
I understand why she's so low on your guys list. She is such a party pooper..
Calm down
Bruh Nico
Such gay undertones
Either works
Or the animators were thirsty
**purrfect**
This show smells gay
Well nom nom that carrot
"so you've basically the whole cast of symphogear'
"Yes"
" So your first merch was symphogear right? Right?"
It'd be fucking funny
Both
<:MillaarcHeart:639311534429831178>
My heart...or my weeb
..
My heart... Or my weeb..
...sorry boobs
I mean. The merch won't be expensive. And 209 a week is a lot
<:MillaarcHeart:639311534429831178>
Disability money IS back as a possibility..
I mean..
What have you done to me
I really thought I wouldn't like this
Beach episode <:MillaarcHeart:639311534429831178>
Shirabe is multiplying
They did it again
A collective jii
I'm getting G flashbacks
Huh. Unconsented groping and calling it a punishment as a third year in high school didn't pan out?
Poggers
Pretty sure the season will end exactly on midnight
Phew
Because she *looks* good. But she doesn't act it
Please tell me she gets more normal in S2
Fair
Only woman I don't like is the molester in training
~~Eri is growing on me~~
Ahhh
Is the movie after season 1 or 2
Question
EY
SAME
THEY HATE THE HEAT TOO
Hot red head
I don't watch anime movies but guess this franchise will change that
**i am a maki Chan servant.**
~~love live love live love live~~
Too late
We are music freaks. Even if we don't like much normal music!
True!
Knowing sweet anime. It's only a matter of time before one falls on top of a fence spike or something
<:RubyStare:765885615174057984>
I feel cozy
Why do I feel good
Wonder ZONE <a:BuroDance:602675806946459658>
Someone give honkers a hug
<:TsubaCry:835962053897748520>

Thanks for crushing my heart into sherbet
This is meant to be comfy

||i don't think honoka is coming back...**sad anime girls with crushed dreams**|| **HAPPY OPENING**
So I'll make sure me. And these other alters with the same dream. Realize it to its fullest!
We'd love to learn an instrument too.
Lyric*
Even if it's not an idol. Music is just something we like too much. And don't writing seems to be our one skill
True, still.
But do you ever want something so much where you know the bad sides yet you still want to strive for it with all the  muscle fiber in your legs?
And i understand that
Fair
||RAINING||
<:TsubaCry:835962053897748520>
||Honoka sick. Katori has an opportunity||
(and i have one)
It is
Awwwwwwww
Nico getting emotional
Sometimes you just need some fluffy good stuff <:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
This gives me the push I need to persue our own musical dreams and stride on!
||perfect||
Symphogear did for us. But This'll definitely help too
love eri?
Wait... Does maki...
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>

Not happy times love live bikki
Everyone is in shambles
I'm glad she's enjoying the game but
????

And it's actually feasible
Uh oh
Crazy I know
The average person isn't a wielder of an ancient relic to fight aliens
I think it's because
^
How am I getting more emotional then symphogear. Worse stuff happened in that

Oh yeah. That was a truck slam
Meh I won't try
<a:APetForChris:752996305697243257>
Snow sounds cute
I feel like an asshole. I'm thinking about a rises song while muse is playing
A rise:BANGER
Muse:oh really nice and sweet
Yeeeaaaah
Doubt you can top that BANGER
Sorry muse
<a:astroSippingShades:750583765553774672>

A RISE HAS AN AWESOME SONG
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
Hair is my favourite part about girls
~~I'm right~~
Interesting
Sorry had to say it
Hair is sexier then boobs
I like the redhead in a rise
They know the others have a shot and want to make sure they stay
There aren't even stuck up!!!
Being a symphogear fan this confuses me lol
Which ones basa
A RISE IS ADORABLE
....I'm not meant to like them
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I'm saying novanity did it for love live for me
I know
I know
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
Nova and love live
Maki first. Then yeah

Honoka thought what we're all thinking
<a:KirikaWhatRun:744464897957691432>
<:MikuShock:690470896154050620>
She's meh now. But I'll never forget season 1.
Bottom of the barrel
I know right
Those are the best 4 to me
Maki best girl 
Honoka vice best girl 
Eri pretty good 
Hotori pretty good
Ep 3 startin
The sharing of sweet potatoes
Temple run
Why do you think she's my profile picture
Temple run
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
She believes in Santa
The good feels
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
But maybe I can represent it
Trans really throws a spammer into this
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
But no dreams happen fast after all
We can't really be idols soon
<:woawdess:796598780560539699>
These high school. Girls.
I just remembered there are lewd art of these girls
AAAAA
Maki is just *a*

Any cute idol show has one
Also. Why do I already know This'll have a Gacha
Fair
She eventually said it
Poor thing

More sisters!!
You'd think an idol like her would have self esteem
Putting her face on others..
~~Nico has good Nico Nico knees~~

I'm tainted oh god

Nozomi just gross tho
Even Nico has redeeming qualities
Nozomi disgusts me..
NICO HAS A LOLI SISTER
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
You know. I don't think anime is *meant* to make you love Everyone but despise one girl
<:ZenbuBerserk:796598498182692954>
I thought you stopped that
NOZOMI WHAT
Poor Nico. 8 girls watching her fucking buy food
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
Only maki eri and honoka
NO NO NO TURN BACK
Fluff means nothing if it's meaningless

<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
The show I mean heh
My heart is CONFUSED
Not being very obvious
I hope they don't disband but
My only guess is that there's a tour or smth and they can be professionals
Awh

Phos cute
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Rocks and genders are confusing when together

KAISAR
Well that was creepy. (||She cracked||)

<a:ChrisShifty:744677308631089162>
*looks at server name*
Ahh.
When is it airing. And where.
Yes.
No no. I mean the special
And where.
When's the episode?
Insert songs. Where have I heard of those before <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
The song was good too.
Is that one episode
7 years.
The only mecha I've enjoyed in the last
..I'll be honest
Forgive me. But that reminded me of Shrek.
...
Yet I prefer FF
But WEP is a lot closer to earth then flip flap
Different universe feel.
It has that same.
What a cute gesture. I sure do hope it won't be traumatizing
<a:Pop:833436990015275028>
Oh, damn
Too soon to rewatch without boredom. Yet I'm going to miss a lot of details.
But the length between us watching the show and the release is in that annoying middle
Also. This is probably just a personal annoyance. And because we watched it a little later.
It was good. Then 8 just. Kind of threw me off
Here's the thing with the show
<:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>
Bugs and all
Cyberpunk really makes you feel like you're in a cyber world
Ohh.
What's KA
The trauma of losing his wife to a dragon (AU idfk)
Good grief
I thought it was the 28th today
..just realized tomorrow is the 30th
I wonder if they'll even be good subtitles.
"great jogging on the spot girl keep it up"
3.
Most of the show. A solid 7.5 the last 3ish including special are..
||I got a few more questions. No more answers. A second recap for a 1 season show. Confused, but not in the interested way. But in the "uh. Ok then I guess" way||
Yeah.
" right?"
"Oh so this must be a really long show right."
> two episodes worth of recap in a show
Hopefully it won't be terrible
Just put on the 13th ep
Just got a random memory of eating koka beef noodles at 10pm winter a few years ago watching Gamers!

Idol girls are my favourite drugs
Hell yeah

Starting sunshine movie
Classic idol anime
Professionally sings on the stairs
Found idols recently
Ah yes
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Ah yes. There is definitely no bias here
<:PadpaWat:803822882190262323> <:PadpaWat:803822882190262323> <:PadpaWat:803822882190262323>
Already picking some favourites 10 mins into nijigasaki
Wasn't fond of the others in sunshine terribly much
I liked Mari but
At least I know it wasn't OG bias
Mommy
President
Council
Student
<:PadpaWat:803822882190262323>
What's with that shade of colour being the protagonist I swear
Ayamu. Chika. Honkers
Setsuna looks cool
I'll admit
<a:BuroDance:602675806946459658>
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
Nijigasaki is starting
It'd annoy me if not
Order is important <:RadPhos:614728986748125185>
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
Why are they all relatable
You underestimate how gay I am
~~**mine**~~
Setsuna
Rinari has a rockin set up
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
That helps more then I should
Im Irish and trans. So seeing Emma being from Switzerland. And being an idol in an anime
Emma's existence really helps
Bruh
Oooo ai-chan is good too <@171395487247630336>
Anime songs all day
I WANT HER
Not allowed so she watches at night
Setsu likes anime
That's a rabbit hole
Nicknaming a stage name
<:PadpaWat:803822882190262323>
Right when she changed hair
It really is Clark Kent
Bruh
Me want
She really thought she was the problem
<:TsubaCry:835962053897748520>
Setsunnnna
Lol
Or. Er. She.
They looked so different
<:RubyStare:765885615174057984>
No wonder I liked them both
||Setsuna IS council girl.||
Wait
<a:BuroDance:602675806946459658> <a:BuroDance:602675806946459658> <a:BuroDance:602675806946459658>

*I'm an idol addict*
I just didn't like the tomboy and nozomi there
It's like OG love live
Yeah
But all of them are good now
I'm used to only liking 3-4 girls
Exactly!!!
This is so different from sunshine.

They aren't ALL meant to be cute
As least she has confidence
<:RubyStare:765885615174057984> <:RubyStare:765885615174057984>
"Don't worry. You're not as cute as me but"
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
Just doesn't work with cute  girls
It'd be a plus
If setsuna or mommy council girl was full of herself
Now
<:PadpaWat:803822882190262323>
A fan of herself.
Kasumin is
I'll have a confirmed type
If I do crush on council girl and setsuna
Ikr
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
Even the bridges
Why is everything in this show pretty
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Didn't start with *that*
Like. I want to be an idol. But even the ones who've made it
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
Suddenly changing their apprentices vocal chords and given 5 years vocal training apparently
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <:AntiHumanGunGun:693808837844664403>
Watch.
Love live good
Never seen that
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813> <a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
I've been infected too early for it to stop
Setsuna still best girl
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
Kanata is cute enough
<a:BuroDance:602675806946459658>
Hey... Now listen.
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
Ahh
The fuck is a SIFAS
Lol
Also sorry ash. Yu is nowhere near the top
<:ElainaWhat:533353765504548884>
So you'll worry her more?
||I'll work even harder||
||don't quit nu||
True
Kasu believes it
Yet serious
Nico feels somewhat ironic about it
She somehow comes off worse then Nico
~~But she does have a complex~~
~~There's a difference between confidence and god complex~~
I can tell lol
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
Just realized kasumin is the Nico substitute
M
Fuck
Hijigasaka?
Fuck I forgot the name again
I really should get into irl idols once I'm done..
Ah
Damn.
What am I looking at
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Sadly it'll never happen..
And maybe it'll be a Clark Kent situation
Setsu-na
Like..
Maybe!
Oki <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Maybe she'll have some cool stage name
We can only pray

You and chika was gay

<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
I never said it was a bad thing
<:RadPhos:614728986748125185>
Ai is over developed
Did she just dump purple paint into a pot
That looks like witch food
What the fuck setsuna
Tease

You must be right! Maybe nana is ripping her style off!!
<:RadPhos:614728986748125185>
We've never seen nana and setsuna in the same room?
Hey guys have you realized..
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
I prefer mommy blond and pyro Clark Kent
<:RadPhos:614728986748125185>

Nvm not gonna judge
Yandere is hot but
Feet
Uh
Lol
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
That feels pretty canon to me boys
It does. But how.
How can phones dropping on the ground feel like such a gay scene
**ARM IN ARM**
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
God that scene was GAY
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
Bai bai
I've flatlined
||"please just belong to me"||
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
The Setsuna fan
Nana
Ah yes
All you can eat
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Rinari making friends
Pigtails aren't my thing
It's good.
Yuu and bikki have something in common
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
Great
My memory isn't exactly
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Chin lift
Karin Chan had the gay moment instead
Uh
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
Carlos. 11 better deliver on the gay
<:RubyStare:765885615174057984>
I want to pinch her cheeks
Nana. You aren't subtle.
<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
Two girls. One firework show
Now that's gay
Fireworks
Bikini.
Karin. Setsuna. Ai
Must resist
I'm curious what that says but
Setsuna and AI would make me flatline
That's specific

<a:MelonHeart:582618140454944813>
I enjoyed nijigasaki
That was gay
That was idol 
That was great 
Yes
Was*
Yeah it www
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Pretty sure the oldest thing I've watched is either Pokémon black white or symphogear S1

Does starting ep 3 real time count?
It'll be same for me
<a:BuroDance:602675806946459658>
I'll probably get pizza. Watch two EPs. Then be sad for three weeks
Love live should take top priority though.

"I'll tell you some other time"
And done
She's a precious bean

She's precious that's why
But keke is making me second guess
Usually I don't go for the cute ones
You know
<:SetsuTPose:691578480571449355>
Are school idols meant to be relatable
<:TsubaCry:835962053897748520>

Eyy
Keke is cute
Ahhh
She sure left a tangy taste  in kanons mouth
Ahh
Full?
Wait
<:SetsuTPose:691578480571449355>
What's her actual name
Keke is cute
<:SetsuTPose:691578480571449355>

Jokes on you. Both is good
<:SetsuTPose:691578480571449355>

Madoka is really adorable. Must protect

Hopefully I'll enjoy it
<:Basadrink:771765306006962196>
I can drink to that
Spreading hope even when there is none
Bruh we playing Skyrim
Soul gem..
Ep 1. Pretty good
Probably from when I listened to covers
I've definitely heard this opening a lot
Main character kinda cute
Turning it on
True
From one of these to another
Gonna get tea ready
I got Ep1 ready
<:McMari:398559387377205248>
If I get too sad. I'll just blast shiny racers (Mari song) into my eardrums
<:makilove:676949630864326675>
I play NieR for fun
Can'tt remember why I didn't continue
I watched a singular ep
I should watch madoka
Starting 7
||their souls. Holy fuck that episode took a screeching turn||
Just learnt
Also
Lol
Animepahe is using that
Well luckily
Akemi is like tsubasa before Hibiki warmed her up
I'm smiling hard
Violin roof scene. So nice.
Awhhhhhhhhhh..
Sayaka looks cute
Das you didn't tell me this was a horror anime lol
Yeah I'd rather be a sad magical girl then one of those.
Fuck this is creepy
||this screams bad.||
<:makiyeehaw:623309635830415381>
Well lucky you partner

That sounds like a lot
My finger better not slip
<:KekeSip:712785523868958830>  landlines lol
Imma not click that
||I think I'm annoyed that I thought she was the big bad but she actually became capp'n crunch||
I feel angry for some reason <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I feel like a fucking ass for judging her now.
Witch listened to thano's advice
<:HibikiAngry:688429716096548892>
||I thought you meant the fucking mom of Miki||
Got the fuck in here
<@331908049822547978>
Remember. Only half in 3.
||akemi I trust. I think there's some form of her Trying to protect madoka. And a slight bit of competition. But Mami just..screams plot twist villain||
Just from body language and how she's acting
But it balances itself out
And it might do some bad.
I'd wish for humanity to have the determination to face all their struggles. Doesn't mean they'll succeed no.
Don't spoil
So if it gets worse later on
I only started 3
Lol
So it IS a magical girl show
Sadness third episode
I know exactly what wish I'd make if I was in their situation
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195> land mines. Imma yeet before I click what I shouldn't
Ep 9  time
Cannibal
Freaked me out
Did he just-
He's back i-
Huh.
Uh.
The holes.
OH
||what the fuck happened to the weird animal||
Uh.
Lol
Don't spoil.
Hi carol!
Yeah.
Even akemi seems kinda.
So madoka is the only one been thinking sensible.
Okay then.

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I mean the idea of being one
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
This show has really turned me off the whole magical  girl thing
Basically left and right brain favourites
Akemi is most sensible
But madoka is adorable
I prefer Mel's response
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
Like the typical sad magical girl show?
By powerful I'm guessing you mean my heart and soul will be stepped on. Ripped apart. Placed back to rip apart again. And probably pissed on the fragments?
Ahhh
I'm currently *watching*
How come
?
Ngl
This show really makes akemi look like the only sensible one
Fuck it. Lily needs her fizzy drinks.
Just think *idol* (heh) thoughts lily.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Honestly worried I'll cry there
I want to get snacks at the shop but
<a:Loudsuna:765915904998506516>
Im beginning to think this guy snorted a line just before recording all that
"hue hue hue hue"
Lemme look
With madoka. It's 500 small slaps
It's three or four big SLAPS
You see with NieR
Nah I'm fucked up enough
What is it first
I'm confused
I feel sad but also happy
And I'm done
Nice!
LAND MINES
Made me shit myself
17 mins
Not yet
|| OOOOOO SMART.||
||MADOKA. YOU'RE JUST REPEATING IT ALL||
||When he compares humans to livestock||
I'm now convinced that madoka magica is one big Vegan commercial
I binge either way
I'll just watch
I was on early S4. 
I've been watching Since 6 am
I binge Everything
I am
I loved S4's last ep ||how did I feel for *endeavour*||
Hopefully it's great
I just started S5 ep1
Cries every three EPs smh
Episode 81 time
Anywho
Nah I won't
100%!!
||He's still smiling! That's my deku||
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
||god. my two weaknesses are music and never giving up hero's. Ahhh||

I already have episode 70 on

I like hype
I forgot to finish for like a month
<:SetsuTPose:691578480571449355>
I picked early S4 up this morning
Yeah I get that
Ahh
Because my totally legit streaming service doesn't have all 25
I just thought. Is S5 currently airing?
Phew.
<:KanataDed:795495319445045298>
I haven't watched ANY of the movies
FUCK
*I just realized*
Plaster your eyes on the page
<a:catpat:775511584964608001>
And well. the anime is crazy popular. And definitely doesn't look like it's a "watch the manga" thing
Zoe said there's 100 more
I feel like the anime is just trying to set itself up for another 15 seasons
Still BULLSHIT
It'll be cool but
Bruh really went from protagonist to bullshit real fast
Deku is becoming fucking god apparently
Shoto is strong enough ||with two||
Like bruh

Because it'll be an episode at a time
No
Ehh
Confuses my brain
With no conclusion
So watching a lot. And suddenly stopping
I usually binge.
It's weird because,
<:AinyaSip:699314293862039572> <:AinyaSip:699314293862039572> <:AinyaSip:699314293862039572> <:AinyaSip:699314293862039572>
I'm enjoying them
<:HikariGalaxyBrain:855124221243555860>
I don't read. Or think.
You've seen it?
The show is good. But it's shonen. It moves slow. But the action is still good
Deku. I just love that unbridled determination
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
But that's the end of its binge
More to the season. But it's not fully out yet
Kinda.
MHA finished!
You must watch great anime then. As you're cool
<:CamieLaugh:710236144293642300>

Bana nice show
But it seems to be macross
These reverse image results are weird
Blue hair.
Why we talking Roblox
Klan Klang apparently
No clue who that is tho
Ah yes. The only non flat girl with twintail hair is sonico
I should watch it though.
And thousands of "I love....Amelia" memes
I watched one ep of this
That dance is cute
Just  started
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
What I think they blew up
Did they blow up
Uh
Gonna watch
The hells that
They're also a "concept movie'
That's dumb.
Why not the other two btw?
Hangyaku no monogatari?
Again*
What do I watch after season 1 madoka magica atai n
So uh
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
And like flat earthers
That akemi video is a joke to the community
Also from what I've heard
<:saveMadokami_MM:654455312346120224>
Dunno if it's true
I hear
S1 meh
2 good so far
Is record basically a warning shot for XDU to not adapt. As it's done pretty bad?
From what I've heard
Question though
I'll probably try watch record today
So
<:madoshock:508684617251946498>
That was my first red flag
To think I wanna gonna try a mecha show
Oh
Is Granbelm worth checking out
<:HikariGalaxyBrain:855124221243555860>
What order do I watch k on
Whatorder do o watch
I wonder how much money was put in for the Yamaha constant product placement
Less go
SAME CLASS
Fuc
Do I watch season 2 straight away for k on?
Whats ura on
<@155340660738621440>
I noticed Pokémon sound effect in k on
Of course
And the students love her

||so this is. Go stand in the hallway|| lol
||head on shoulder. Gay||
K on ||calling yourselves YuiAzu. Bitch. You've literally done the shippers work for them||
I'm going back to bed now. But good to know
Interesting
Akb0048
"Heart of a woman's" do I sense trans rep?
They didn't even TRY hide the star wars reference
Micsaber
I also see bootleg honoka
Good songs surprisingly
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I hope the girls run away from the evil halo soldiers
Damn
Noted
Gay
Buuuut
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
You could get a charge pretty easy that way now That I think on it
Well. It's not in the show. But it still damn exists
*the song*
Even original love live has
<:mikugay:640727023878275073>
Bikki too dense
Probably would be Miku doing it actually
Would've been great
Why couldn't have Hibiki done that to miku
Just let the gay exist
Mellllll
I didn't understand a word of that sentence Mel
*closes book* and they were best friends
Pushing a girl onto a bed. Phones dropping. Feet holding each other. Asking to be only there's
It's real good
4:18
https://youtu.be/52Xj13Mw4-s
And it was obviously leaning to the gay
I mean. Ayu got jealous that yu was singing to setsuna and chatting
That push on the bed is so gay
Fuck lemme try find it
Not the full full scene. The start sells it.
That's gay all over
https://youtu.be/ZWP8PeOBMmg
But it paints the image
This doesn't have the really gay part where she pushes her onto the bed and their phones fall
I wish I had *the* scene on hand. It's 900% gay
Nijigasaki academy
The show
<@99695384296701952>  is it gay
Natasja?*
Why do I see a gal that looks like bootleg nastash (can't remember names spelling)  in AKB0048
*AND THE GARLIC RISES*
When I put em into Google translate
But*
I liked some lyrics that were in a song in ep 6. Butig uh
So uh
A
That thank you kinda broke me
It's good so far
Wow.
That's a fucking evil fan letter
Onto AKB0048 EP 6
All under 18
Kill a god 
Become a god 
The brain of a god
Interesting
When it slides from horrific to anime gore?
That is fair
I mean. Serena has "the face"
Kanade. Was a lot less gruesome. Yet way more hitting
But I didn't cling to it
With Serena. *Damn gruesome*
It's weird.
So yeah. Kanades death did sting. But I barely saw her..
Ah thanks
Does anyone know the song name played in episode 6 all about the hater?
And hair colour
Personality wise
Kanata is the spitting image of kanade
Because if anyone Google translates it they'll think I'm hardcore on garlic
Imma go rewatch that scene with the lyrics and just write em in English
Either Google translate went fucky or the subs
Big brain Mel
How so
Not anime but. NieR 

||Is THAT why I'm still of over 2B?||
There was so much shock with winglet I'll say. 

Because it was a fucking hand gutting a kid.
<a:PartyBlob:599687667839664198>
~~We don't *really* need shirabe~~
I still wish I could've seen kanade in full action
Yeaah..
I like what I like ig
That's not good
And I mean. You're shot if you sing. Have posters. Go to concerts
I like the show...
||So glad takamina stayed as the gal||
||Wait Micsabers run on music. So. Works like phonic gain ig||
The kirara just can't fucking choose can they tho
Heh
Even if I have to start solo. I know I can't start or enter a  traditional one.
That rush is something you can't replicate. Even watching through an anime.
**FUCK I WANT TO BE AN IDOL**
Was never gonna stop us
Remember we like grimdark. *And* idols
Spoilers ||SO THEY BOTH SING. YES. HAPPY.||
I'll admit I'm always half confused during it though
Oh god novanity will Murder me
I like it..
Damn.
Starting 13. Hopefully it'll be happy..
<:KanataDed:795495319445045298>
I'm half way through 12.
AKB0048 is making me sad now..
~~That's not what chika said~~
It was just really. A nice pace
Lewd ik
Fuck. Now I wanna see some lesbian girls hugging and holding hands
<a:PartyBlob:599687667839664198>
Lesbians make the world go round.
~~Ah yes. Because anime has never. Once. Been hypersexualized~~
*?*
<:KanataZPose:722141365693186088>
Because I wanted to spread positivity in general
All I looked up was "love live yall be great"
How is that..
Was looking at LL stuff. Stumbled into this
Uhh
Very cute
Felt human
But I actually liked that
I notice the general voices (not singing) having their cracks
Here's the weird thing
Mimoris baubles prove that lol
I don't think the animation is worse. Imo
Akb0048 season 2 might be a lot better. Hm
EP 1 felt like massive levels of fucking HYPE
Annnd starting AKB0047 next stage!
Kinda can't
Sorry.
They make it sound nice lmao
So how dumb does it get
||And I mean. Old cast can't be mentors. The once understudies are. Nowhere||
We need to get into the rank deal but. Would probably bum us out
Damn..
<a:MimoriClap:721552830401609778>
Me doubt
I want a season 3 but. Judging by the fact it's 7-8 years ago
You be right
A
<:honkCry:598049273342591019>
How did this show make me ball
Akb0048 ||OH MY GOD AKIBASTAR IS SAFE AND ISN'T RUIN ANYMORE THANK FUCK||
**godspeed**
What does the leader uptight girl say?
A big mission. Seeing what investors are up to. Infiltration
That caught me off guard
I wonder why idol anime inspires me so much
Magical girl x2
Music
Uhhhh.
Idol
Magical girl 
**Females**
<:YuukoWave:721561152051609711>

Don't worry. We are internet saints practically
Heh

Fuck it sure
Would we?
<@331908049822547978> I remember you saying you liked it
Shot*
I might give yuyuyu another show
10/10 show
So what's popular the last. 5 years
..uhh...
I'm seeing a pattern...
Baseline for recommendations:


Revue starlight. Symphogear. Madoka
Or men
I'm not into muscley men
I haven't seen JoJo though.
**YES. YES. YES**
So anime reccs?
Any other ideas
I'm shitting myself too much
Reassuring
<:PadpaWat:803822882190262323> <:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
Then this this this
Watch this. This. This.
Basically:
Not Google's
I feel like I need a degree to start it
<:KanonSweat:712760466983616553>
That's the point.
I was still given an order
Well yeah
Lay the framework plz
Can anyone uh.

Damn
Poor lil Karin Chan is adorable
But yeah I get you
<:azu_laugh:727558339470295058>
||Pink hero.
Black hero turned antagonist (maybe movie 4 will make Homura turn around too)||
*HOLY FUCK*
Is the first anime I've actually cried to.
Original yuyuyu
Even My non HDR games
It made it look nice..
For all my other anime
But like
I like kasumi rn
Nope. Just lights brighter then the sun
At first I thought "man. Subs being slightly higher makes my head hurt?"
Yep that was the problem
Might turn off HDR. Could help
Nvm. The anime is just ungodly bright.
Why do my eyes hurt.
Which gives me a headache. And I don't know why
And they feel abnormally high up
Is using retail subs for once
My definitely very legal service
I'm probably just weird but
Bandori protagonist already cute. 3 mins in
Edited why? Dunno!
<a:aSetsunaCry:631576708067360792>
My favourite anime. Shrek
https://youtu.be/TBO9ANTBCjM
Ah yes anime
> TWINKLE TWINKLE SOLO
What I got:
Irina said: it's a rock anime
I wonder what mine is
do ive a type?

*Please give me her name. I need to look up art*
**pierce into me**
Emerald eyes.
She's. Really cute.
But the girl that looks like Setsuna but nerd form
Or anything about her.
What her name is.
I don't know who she is.
<@207452640886521859>
Oh the blond

:ZweiHug:
***AITAKATTA***

So what are the modern seasons to watch?
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>

The ending song showing a cracked rock with heels though
It's still good but. Hmph.

An idol show. And a band show. Sneaky
Oh you sneaky bugger

I've heard VE is good..
Lankers. Take it away
I'll find something pretty to watch. Though we like some dark stuff
Sure!
Maybe I just want to watch something pretty.. lol
Though fate doesn't make sense I hear
I'll start any of the modern ones of they make sense
Honestly I'm half wanting for ost and visuals so
I'm guessing I summoned 50 people currently writing an essay on which to start at?
Lol
Who should I ask
Sounds like the average girl to me
For fate
I love them
*oh lord gay*
*sniff sniff* I'll count that as gay seeds
Poor fuu

Does any transgender MTF anime exist
Don't worry. I smell bait
https://tenor.com/view/yoshiko-love-live-yohane-tsushima-sunshine-gif-10793293

Solo is known as the god of despair

Akame got me ready for NieR
Another first anime actually

That was an ass blast of nostalgia just now
https://youtu.be/F2sjl_jJEzc
Y'all just. Listen
Only once. Which was pure fan service
Well
Dense
MC is uh
Or VE
Watch clannad
Fuck do I rewatch rakudai
Imma listen to Identity
Feck it
I love some tracks too
The fight scenes in rakudai are great
First animes were:
Rokka no yuusha
Haruhi
Mirai Nikki 
Rakudai kishi no chavlry
father son bonding
But snivy fresh from lab beat em
90
He should be like
That's my point
You think he just throws the old Pikachu in the dumpster and gets a new one
It's Pikachu cypher.
Couldn't beat a snivy
His Pikachu should be fucking jacked by 5
Imma guess you're talking about the Pokémon trainer
I just don't like em
English are good
I wonder if irish dubs exist at all lol
I cringe at english dubs (most)
Cute
Chisato cure
in dum dum terms
so AKB does idol concerts in illegal areas to try lessen it
entertainment is banned
the what
honky cute
it looks mecha to me
they aren't there much but
does AKB count
i mean
sa2 is my fav anime
<:AyuSmug:659503490170617856>
<:HonkEvil:749327484197142569>
SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG IS A-

yeah
so uh
I think he did 70 for a week
how do you know whats going on
right now

<:KasuClose:750946278703366274>
I can promise I probably haven't gone past 90 in my four years
<:KasuClose:750946278703366274> guys I'm a teen who's work takes an hour
no wonder they aren't rated
holy shit
552
and they can't compare every single anime to each other
they are still people's opinions
but heavily skewed to the point the ratings are too heavy one side
not lies per say
mmmm.
prob not them yeah
i feel like there were others but
lost pause
why don't they talk with noble anymore?
q*
QW
uh...meow?

It was worded like an ad
||Link in the description||
Most likely because the visual and auditory additions that come with the nature of anime or any Television-esc product can subjectively enhance the experience depending on the specific material<a:LanzhuNesoSpin:885437212244705290>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Birth name obviously
Student council president
I know her name!
Heh

<:homunosebleed:738061060082237553> shes perfect

<:KasuClose:750946278703366274>
that man looks terrifying
I only watched 1 and prequel
Still nice to hear it tho
Just needs a S2 and it'll be poifect
I feel like it's amazing at fleshing out their characters and I love that
I'll take that as a horrible Ew no bad show
Obviously on ""reputable"" websites
Should I watch Komi?
I only have one ep left
Best LL gets a S2
Eyy
Apparently Komi San has a genderfluid character? From what I can tell
The fuck
<:HuTaoWorry:830708891539996683>
Wait till ruby realizes irl women have blond hair too
I have been in this place before
<:MikuShock:690470896154050620>
I've only seen the show
I bet Elaina has like 15 of these herself
Bit unique but respect
Didn't know Aya was into foreheads
An absolute masterpiece
Skelter heaven
So
Ps2
Ps3
It has a game
Why does this exist
So uh
<:DiaLUL:715458258122571800>
It felt fan edited
Definitely a must watch for any anime fan
Hey I fucking liked it
Mech
I'd say try Delta ep one because. That song and fight scene genuinely made me want to continue. And I usually hate the idea of mecj
<:shiotimid:875545091933097984> <:shiotimid:875545091933097984>
And I've talked so much "mecha isn't for me" that it'll be laughed at
I'm the same but. Delta's first episode is scaring me because I think imma actually love it
WHAT
God I want to be an idol so bad fuck
Can you find me a non spoileru profile pic of hot purple idol lady
FUCK
<:mariKnife:424601735298940929>

||Why the fuck Did I love it. The characters seem great from a glance. The music is top notch. Great fight scenes. And oh god that purple long hair idol is so hot I want to be her oh god and that ending song love is all was amazing fuck||
*looks at pic"
hibiki and miku are besties

Hi

Ye
I was expecting something like. What I saw in Elianas ep with the time travel
Lol
What's rotoscoped
Forgive my smooth Brain
So
I'm curious but there's good anime in my backlog to see
Quite spicy
This show must be
||Like Eliana the witches one ep||
I bet it's like:MC:**you are only an okay person**
Uh
Didn't see that
Apparently the first ep was just "okay" and nothing seemed warning wordy. - trusty source: a twitter user
**only**
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
if there's magic, sprinkle gay girl powder on em
so, they tired a reddit question into a show
What's that
The movie 3 was like a decade ago
Madoka counts for a lot as like
<a:KasuSwap:738342148222615612>
Shut
Fair
<a:KleeDance:834468273209737286>

oh yall dont mean ngnl
tbf s3 will probably happen before 2  at this rate
Because I'll always love that show for non obvious reasons
?*
Is AKB thought of as good!
I wouldn't call eromanaga a gem
~~I've also seen the ovas~~
Opening is a bop
Tbf
"yes. Today I'm binging eromanaga sensei"
I still wonder why 14 year old me thought
||oniiii Chan?||
I know trash
We've both seen eromanaga sensei
It's not sub*stantial* but are the girls?
<:TsubaCry:835962053897748520>
Fucking cucked fuck me
Apparently it's only 3min an ep
It sounds like a rock idol opening

Hibiki Chris miku
So Carlos. What made you a Nico fan
They seem cute

No. That's money.
Also I'm dumb. For some reason I thought there was 100 in a minute
~~I don't like that song ngl~~
<:MikuShock:690470896154050620>
It's opening is just under 1/6 of the content
So like. What do they even do
<a:KasuSwap:738342148222615612>
What -
How short are those seasons
tbf the grown up sis does look cute

time for memes
dub love live...
Macross delta ep 15 ||yeah I get the ceremony is important and all but.i can't stop cracking up that the king's last name is fucking Heinz. Saying long live Heinz is fucking hilarious I can't stop thinking of ketchup||
Looks like if kaguya and president stole chikas kid
Mari best girl
i never did get to nier rant because i love the shows
<@!84811738653929472>
CGDCT right
It's pure comf
Garfield is the best anime obviously
I really don't get how they go from unbearable to watch, practically YouTube compilation. To genuine emotions and loving what's happening
How is the first 1hr and 20 minutes. 
And the last 40. The same film
<@99695384296701952> question
Pretty good addition to that scene
Potential is left
44 minutes left
*blegh*
And they feel very
They're retail subs
And movie 2 exists
I'm going to force it because apparently the last 30 mins is good?
*Thankfully it's not the same reality as the show*
Online people seem to love this movie
I feel bad because
Macross deltas movie from 2018
I feel like my source was butchered...I heard good things...
I genuinely can't sit through the movie <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Felt very gross.
The writing for subs, which is the retail one
It plays like a "best anime scenes of 2021" compilation save for the music scenes and a few very scenes
I've watched half the movie.
Alright so
*i can't believe I started existing two days before my birthday*

It's 30 mins away here but thanks Alexis!

*fight fight fight*
You'll get there one day delta
Fuck
~~I'm not checking other seasons~~
*THIS IS A WIN*

Maybe macross delta did better then I thought
Huh
https://c.tenor.com/-vHESJB43eIAAAAM/myanimelist-myanimelist-fans.gif
**so it's open**
Like how steam might not have a  tab open but it's still in the background
Yeah but it's probably on in the background
Sus sus
Sus
Sounds adorable to me.
<:FreyjaThink:905234961450270763>
Imagine if Mal and Anilist were anime girl gijinkas and they were rivals but also sisterlike
Cypher is in love with a platform
Adblock my beloved
It's not as good as Mal but. *Nice*
*is macross delta higher or lower on anilist*
I don't know much on either
I got a drink ready

I want to write now

FUCK.

Looking for light
We!
No you

I do wonder what my genuine idol  personality will be like..
I just don't get it maite. I'm singing me foking socks off and the wee cunts down the street won
It could fit if I *make my persona* (Nico Nico) properly
The songs I want to sing would have determination, stars, hope, bravery, and fire, coursing through it.
"fucking eejits."
That'll need cleaning quick
Ngl. If, nah, when. I make it. 
I'll have trouble hiding the potty mouth I used to have

<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
<@278860841485598720> Can I ask. What is perceived as my speed
All ends well
But now I'm hyped so
I loved gridman and want to watch his show
Because like
I dunno why I chose knight magic
<:HITORIDAKENANTEERABENAIYOOOOOO:777152637572612096>
I wish I could pilot a mecha at blistering speeds in a world of magic
**I love mecha I admit it**
...
A
I feel nerding in me
WHY IS THIS COOL. 
<:YuWoah:691865763560161351>
FAST MECH
Pretty
Girls fawn over him 
Smart 
Magical isekaied world
Ernie is a weebs dream
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
Hearing the opening makes the battle animations run in my head
Sounds like half the server
Very pretty too
Music slaps at least
Let's hope I love it
Ernie adorable so
I caved early
I don't follow
<:KekeWoah:713093810338529381>
Practically just a big person with all the advantages of machine
The idea of this big chunk of metal turned into a robot that can run at blistering speeds
We all have acne
More to watch tomorrow
If I stop now
It's just terminal now
I've been infected way before now
Right
No one stops at 3 episodes
I mean...
School aidoru?
Mecha.
But...
The nan might hear...
There's two types of people
It's almost 12. But. I want to watch more! But I can't...
Sounds fun!
I don't roleplay. Just hyped at the show
Uh.
HYAH!
Just watching a show
Passionate? But it's at nothing
I just feel. Really.
<:GVwoah:826401151007719444>
A kingdoms technology 
Ernie:" lemme fast forward you by a couple decades"
This is all funny to me
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
Why does my heart feel like this
GGG has the knee drill attack..
What's that
I feel happy
But yeah I want more hype these days
~~I've seen akame ga kill~~
No like. Do I have an obvious favourite type in my media?

defintely those
yep
eyes
TBf. Half his official stuff could be passed as female
I can't find any genderbent art f
...I have to Google something
But it's his real name
Ernesti sounds like a femaled Ernie
And like
He's Ernie
He's not a guy
As Addy said
I mean
That's her personality
Addy is "hi I'm female with a crush"
I like it apart from
~~I like my side hustle headcanon~~
He made a ton of advancements in a short short amount of time
He'd have to pull a lot from his world
Imo
Though he was called a genius, likes programming and mecha so. Maybe he got his degree in programming but engineering was a side hobby/thing he likes reading
~~He sure knows a lot of engineering for a programmer~~
But uh
Like how he hotwired it to his wand
Yeah I get that first bit
He honestly just sounds like an Off the rails engineer
Honestly. I know he was a programmer but
Which is cool!
That's a weird opening for a ep
Floating boxes of mecha
Ernie is just. A genius
Even adding in isekai
TBf
<:shiothink:695056252757213215> Fair
Elaina would fuck herself
Cute kid way
Ernies in a more
I just realized

Ernie from knights and magic feels like Elaina the witch ~~if you removed how self absorbed she can be~~
Fair fair
Eyy
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
Maybe it's too late for me to be up..
Are the protags of isekais
Knowledge/memories
What if everyone isekais. But the ones in shows are ones who kept their knowledge equaling a head start in  Their next life
Weird isekai theory
That'd be horrendously stupid
Yelling at authority won't get you secrets
And he's smart because
Big difference
He's not rude, he's a nerd
Exactly
I wish I was as good at something as Ernie is mecha
Women? Pssh. Lemme advance technology
Though he has Chad energy
My brain says hot woman.
But it's male
MALE 
HOW
They're making an anime not one piece
Mock battle
Bruh why does 8 have horni music in one part
Ep 7 of knights and magic is so cool
Just gotta pray
"I'm fighting, With an honest to goodness robot!!"
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I want more ikaruga.
?
<:HuTaoWorry:830708891539996683>
Yeaah...I'm sure it'll get another right
It was all so cool
I loved knights and magic so much especially the final episode
<@782841825069236236>
that's a lucky girl

Also like

||and God they sell akane as a god complex ass really well already. Instantly you have a feel for her vibe||
Killer music. The fact they're doing actual tricks like intentionally weird audio cuts to sell. Well you know. Gridman brings the childlike hype in me
That's a killer beat <a:KleeDance:835927497182019614>
In a good way

Let's hope I can find one (big chance it'd have to Be online so. AHH)
I need an actual brain for it first
That's a worry for a later day
Or any online learning thing for music
<:DiaThink:446346747204337664>
I meant more course
**not what I meant by program**
Even online
She'd be the one who'd be able to help me find programs
Hey uh. Could you text me in the morning about that. I talk with a person about what to do and uh
Very true
I need to look into some kind of education, that would have to stray from normal paths...hm

<@207452640886521859>
It was pure LSD content
Yeah it was that one
What the FUCK WAS THAT
I watched S2 ep4.
All I'll say is.

There's a character in bandori who...
I doubt k-on is like this

Lol fair
Why does the art shown here remind me of blend s
Actually
Looks like an AU sagiri
That silver hair girl
twice with the season
I've watched the original story 3 times
if counting the movie
very true
||about the dripping blood stars and dead stage girls, ahm. what.||
so
is this movie 2 spoilers
exactly.
wow that was a treat
alright
i'm letting end credits run incase of an ending scene
this is great.
that's how you retread. not how macross delta did it
that was amazing, the scenes flowed, obvious different angles and slight tweaks, new scenes, and some redone songs.
that was not an ending I was expecting
ahm.
<@!486087033652248576>
anywho, back to the movie.
rondo rondo: roll credits
4th wall breaks in this show feel weird for me
W-well. Maybe.
Can I click either of those
Revue movie: ||well done Claudine. I'm proud of you||
Everyone is so raw in this movie so far. I love it.
That's for sure
The movie is off to a great start.
I don't know if I can click that
Revue movie ||oh my god I thought she actually killed kaoru off for a second||.
I love this.
Oh my things went 100 fast
....
I am a solid 80% sure the reason they do a close up of plat posters with very obvious pretty boys 3 times in this movie so far is because of how gay Season 1 was
Well that is certainly engrish
Understood
Are they known?
Ten also linked veggie
They're on the new revue movie and they seem...off
Are veggie subs good?
Just enough to fluster Claudine
Even in canon I didn't know much
I wish I did
Time for tea and Google docs
Thank you
Thank you google
c'est ainsi que parle Claudine
Both.
Tendou- No. Mizuki Starlight promises it.
I'll meet the ceiling, and shatter it.
I'll go the farthest I can with what I'm able to get
And even if I don't have much to choose from
I have a good feeling
We only have a junior cert. Because reasons. But
Thank you ardania
Thank you
We may start from the ground, but if we've legs we can still climb
I think it's a good omen.
We watch the two movies. Most likely a week before we learn if we get any music courses or not.
That we wanted music education
I already said this, but it feels surreal. Revue made us sure
And I'm thirsty.
The songs have made me want to write
Beautiful, but it can never happen twice
The show is exactly how it describes stage girls
It did what it wanted to. And very well
Instead of a muddy story with some highs and low lows.
It has a good season, recap movie, and sequel
I'm grateful
Honestly.
I may miss my stage, surrounded by them. But I know my own path is going to start very soon. So I'll look forward.
Ah interesting
From what I can tell. I wonder if I should read the manga I'm pretty sure exists. (I think.)
Revue starlight is basically: metaphor the franchise
But I'm satisfied
We only had to wait less than a year. (Probably would've been less if we knew the subs were out)
I'm happy
Mm
That was amazing, is what I'm thinking
Now to go through the end credits
Hm.
||she...||
||ahm.||
That I am not!
but I did the update...
oml
6k megabits
you're to blame <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
you reminded me to open genshin
by the way
of course
which is an odd thought
because revue has interacted with both gear and bandori. so...
by the way, is the universe part ever explained in the game
what if you're unable to spend
But every stage girl must sin of course. yes.
that may be true
well.
I was tempted to sin
damn.
I am tempted to download...
revue movie/mobile game question:||With the series essentially concluded and their lives planned out, how are they keeping the mobile game around?||
From what I know AGK was never a VN
Uhuh.
What have I walked into.
Can't remember any episodes but we used to like it
It aired in Ireland, I know that much
Ohh
That's STILL going?
very good
I just watched the season and prequel, going to watch the new one eventually
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Did something happen?
emotions were predicted spectaculary
I've been played like a fiddle
reading the interview
<a:KarinSmugZoom:701207363574693949>
>  but they could always be involved on a new stage. But, at this point in time, I don't have any new information about it. I have to be careful what I say. (Laughs) But I don't think this is the last stage play. I hope you guys can keep supporting us.
<@!486087033652248576>
sorry maria
you can use tomatoes and a good metaphor
This show shows
interesting
she is one of the most central characters to the plot
it almost felt on purpose
well yes
> ||there were many who saw Nana as a special character. Eventually, she became the "final boss."||
even after such a great movie
so humble
Better be feature length

Me, an animepahe enjoyer:

How do you do so good for 3/4 of a season then absolutely nosedive
This show still upsets me
Dawg that's cool
Reincarnated as an ido- **dusted**
Truck? Damn. **Oooooo my paradise**
This is basically knights and magic if you squint

So as I was saying
Sounds interesting yeah
Where's my truck
Alrighty

H-huh???
ey proud of ya
did that fry your brain
what the
how do they talk
is this the "not like other girls" part
what are they like irl?
imma be ignorant and say gay anyways buuuut I do see why gear would be *more* gay now
<:ThinkingNico:824235967770525707>

Oh interesting
I watched about. 3-4 eps.
I don't know why It wasn't grabbing me like gridman
I tried
So I was actually on the ball. I just guessed
Or something
Isn't there like 18 seasons
Because
That's scary
I've never heard of it. What's it about
Uhh. Shows like:
Revue 
Flip flap 
Love live 
Madoka 
Symphogear
Gridman 
Knights and magic


Essentially a lot of magical girls (Ernie counts)
What's some good anime I should watch? I want to watch something but I have no clue what
<:Sumire:715857848042520646>
the blond looks like sumire but stoned
Cute. I think.
Uh.
Why was this random man trying to shove food down a girl
I did not expect to see a petite girl at the end
Hello sir "back in my day"
Damn
60% is low
So why do you hate mecha btw
Oh the show with *that gif*
Ecchi*
Watch more masterpiece echhi
True...
It deserves 69%
You really should bump those ratings for ecchi
Poor mecha
Nice
Not even a solid 70%
Pog
Cute girls doing cute girls?
I thought you were Sir CGDCT
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Yeah it doesn't want to play
I'll try another url
"there is something wrong"
Fuck
"The movie first " right
It's there
Fair
It isn't
Where can I get it
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I guess I'm spoilt because the love live ones were there

feck
pahe won't acknowledge the existence
Nanoha shows nothing on pahe
Also what's it called
So...is the movie viable?
<a:AngryBongoKarin:770671539615563826> a
Can you compare it to akb00's graphics/haruhis
I'm curious about nanoha I just hope the movie has fairly ok visuals
Oh that's lost pauses guilty pleasure anime I think
The diary of a wimpy kid book?
I mean. How many shows have the protagonist floating naked in space
Not as strong but
https://c.tenor.com/J42p3Yb7JaMAAAAM/symphogear-symphogear-xv.gif
Looking at posters. Nanoha looks old
Oh what's nanoha about
Is it bad?
Didn't a YuYuYu season come out
Now that you remind me
*oh wait*
The poster kinda gives me YuYuYu vibes
<:rinkuTriesToThink:774289672079671317>
I have forgotten what shows I said I should watch after srw.
I thought you did. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to.
Fictive. 

I watched the movie today. Going to finish rest later.
Yeah that's too distinct a singing voice not to be.
Is that Mizuki nana I hear singing??
The blond is very cool
<@161155855524298752> did they really name the kitsune... arf.
Though he looks good
**worried**
Small magic animal gives small girl powers
They're all so adorable
Hopefully it's good
It's on
Feck it I'll go with cloud
Is mycloud. Videocard. Stream tape. Or MP4upload better
Mycloud does
Vidstresm had nothing
O
Damn
Re De are movie adapts of those I thought
Apparently it's the normal canon and gachas/manga canon? If I remember what friend said
That book gives me Yu-Gi-Oh vibes
I'll watch it all. Just don't know the watch order
So the season A's is next right?
Oh
I thought A's was the season
I'm going to watch A's then
Damn
Also. I'm not bad or missed out on way too much by experiencing S1 through the movie am I?
Oops sorry
Seasons
So A's it is
I don't mind watching it properly now
<@99695384296701952> what's the watch order after "The movie First" I'll watch it normally now
Imma go to the shops
You can say fate. 
And Because this is a conversation to get awkward fast
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
New purple hair girl is giving bad vibes
Lindy is pretty
Imma watch now
Pog
Ahh
So
A's strikers 
Movie A's the rest of the movies
Damn.
Oh ok
Is it like madoka
Oh oh
Does the show lead into anything.
So like
Why was that funny to me
So like a diverging path in srw. Like if you lean right or left?
Is it better to watch the show or movie first?
Which is the, er.
You don't say
<:NotLikeMaya:636922044176400425>
So. Which is the true one?
My head hurts
> The first two or so movies follow the first two seasons. Reflection and Detonation tell their own stories (which are kind of loosely based on the video games?)…
Found what my friend said
Imma go
Dummy
Half a year between when nanoha came out and me
What does titan taste like
Half a year
Actually
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Loris if I remember. You're only older by a year or two <:KarinSip:749004519106412555>
Is older than us by a year
It feels weird to know that nanoha the show
Oddly charming
It's been a while so I can't remember if it was 16:9 or not
What was Haruhi suzu in? The original one
I mean
<:mugi_sip:762013567599247431>
The first time I've ever watched an anime in 4:3
Nanoha A's is now finished

I didn't mean to ramble. Sorry.
Sorry
<:SarahPeek:721146425257361439>
I watched A's already so wondering if I can just go into the sequels)
Since I had an immediate distaste to strikers for reasons I still can't place.


Can I just watch the movies after A's? Does the A's movie have different moving parts or just cutting the seasons fat?
So like.
Looking at posters...the *looks* are at least more similar to A's
How different are they in a more general sense
Like.
You know how there's movies after the A's movie
No like.
Without spoiling much
Can I ask what the movies change
Completely different
Fate and nanoha strike me as
But it still feels like "ah yeah that guy"
Big time gap
Etc.
Stronger.
You know how NieR gets more angsty
How to put it.
I know
Sorry for not explaining right)
A's was great
Yeah
She has one long twintail...or I guess just. Tail.
Just *everything* feels different
But I meant...idk
That'd explain why my friend said she's like homura
I can't place why
The hair, really hate. And the personalities just don't feel right?
Do the movies portray them better?
Oh while you're here <@99695384296701952> so... I don't know why but. I really don't like how fate and nanoha are. And it's only ep 2. It just feels **wrong**
Like the (don't click this) ||library|| and (or this) ||and the twins||
**OH!** Will be lost
A lot of
Nothing *Important* gets lost but like
As someone who played automata first. I'd definitely play replicant first
I have been summoned
Symphogear man himself? Well we love symphogear
Good batshit? Or bad badshit
Ahh. Interesting!
Ahh. What's the watch order
imma go
have fun ash
uh.
well.
bikkis scar represents something very different-
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Ahh
Japanese name for dress up darling
Is that the uh
OH
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
What did I walk in on
Anywho back to movie
Uh. A lot just happened in the span of 1 minute <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:LanzhuLoveThis:793223906815246346> I can tell this is gonna be fun
Interested.
Care for characters. 
Things feel right.
I'm already:
Not even 5 minutes into reflection
From depression to bopping music
God that's evil of him.
...
<:rinkuTriesToThink:774289672079671317>
Who is she?
I recognize it.
When Yuri said a crying sorry. I swear.
<@99695384296701952> very quickly, half way through
O-oh.
Detonation 20 minutes in ||ahhh I feel bad for Yuri||
Anywho. Movie time
That sounds awkward
Is it normal that I love reflection to the point of a 9 and it feels like a big upgrade from the rest of the franchise
Ahh. I'll click after.
Is that reflection or detonation spoilers
<:LanzhuLoveThis:793223906815246346> <:LanzhuLoveThis:793223906815246346> <:LanzhuLoveThis:793223906815246346> <:LanzhuLoveThis:793223906815246346>
I don't know why I loved it so much but I did
It really was
Detonation time
Kyrie is so cool too
I did not expect to enjoy reflection that much! Detonation is next after I listen to ending song
**holy shit**
Nanoha reflection was amazing. 8.5 to 9. But
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Reminds me of Macross Delta
Also I like the movement in battle a ton
Idk why apart from director.
I will admit these two movies did give symphogear vibes but
<:LanzhuLoveThis:793223906815246346>
That was good
So adorable
The small king and friends.
Just big companies sometimes crusade now
Tbf that's still almost true
Apart from being a magical girl show with dark Elements
And like
I'm still surprised I enjoyed the prequel that was half the length more than the full Season
**every?**
https://c.tenor.com/lM4DA5vNHCsAAAAM/that-doesnt-sound-legal-peter-rothmann-rasmussen.gif
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
What kind of show is it
<a:rinkuLoading:774390966953967647>
That does not sound like an anime called domestic girlfriend
Solo
I've never heard of it
It's trash. But it's hard to look away
It's okay to be a raccoon
Here's the thing
So we get a pass
Tbf we were 13
I still don't know how we sat through eromanga sensei
Isn't that what lank loves
<a:rinkuLoading:774390966953967647>
Well yeah. You don't like it
> 4 because I heavily dislike the show
One person's 10 is another person's "fucking horrible piece of shit"
Subjectivity is pog
But 10 is for the revues starlights
As 9
I'll give a lot of really great shows I enjoy. Even guilty pleasures
Which rebellion really cleans up on
Madoka is really good but pacing can feel weird
I agree with madoka being 9 and rebellion being 10
Rebellion and revue deserve it
Tbf
Though ||with there being about 100 probably impossible||
Now that sounds like an interesting mash of the two
Madoka or homura losing a part of themselves every cycle
Now,
I don't see it
How many have you seen again
Plastic memories song is good
My Little  Sister Is Actually A Famous Rappers Reincarnation???
"o-onii chan?"
Would you guys pay money for Snoop Dogg in a maid costume to serve you confectioneries and coffee
How do I remember that
Core memories
.
Yeah I remember that
Sadistic woman, cute blond, gamer, and **surprise**
All I remember about blend s is
We live in a society-
What *was* gamers even about
They were definitely good
<:rinkuTriesToThink:774289672079671317>
I don't know why our memories, which barely exist. Remembers we had koka noodles
But not the show
Koka noodles
Gamers! I literally remember what we *ate* that day
I think I know what anime is the most forgettable that we've seen
But less gay
This reminds me of citrus
I'll definitely think on sakura. Any other shows?
I'll listen to the op
I'm a sub girl. But I respect dubs
https://c.tenor.com/XoYV9sqXITkAAAAM/yu-gi-oh-time-to-duel.gif
What's it about
Card captor looks similar to nanoha in visual style
So what's sakura about
<a:RitsuSpinFaster:737509561614860316>
Ultra old is before 2000's imo
Well yeah
Never heard of CCS
Isn't that *ultra* old? (Sailor moon)
Seen this, and flip flap
That kind of thing
I like nanoha, symphogear, revue starlight, madoka (I might like magical girls) gridman, akb0048. Love live.
Any anime recommendations?
I love that franchise
<:rinkuTriesToThink:774289672079671317>
Does revue starlight count as magical girl
That's tougou from yuyuyu from what my brain says
https://c.tenor.com/pUIAJhU76CUAAAAM/selection-project-idol.gif
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368> I have no idea on what to watch
Idol pride good?
Is
https://tenor.com/view/dpd-dpd-parcel-parcel-gif-20288621
Sounds like something millhi would say
When you think on it.
Kinda creepy
Though a certain idol thing is uh
I know it's no 10/10 masterpiece but, I do like it.

I'm guessing it's not good
By what you said
It looked interesting but
That reminds me of flip flap
https://c.tenor.com/6-qx7_HfmtUAAAAM/akb0048.gif
It's a great anime (guilty pleasure)
Oh yeah GGG. I forgot we need to watch that. Hm...
Looks like a school idol anime
Essentially: what are must watch
Mecha 
Idol 
Music
Magical girl 
Shows
Flip flappers looks good
Weird.
Eizouken looks uh.
At least shirobako looks...normal
We don't go by Stella, I guess we go by lily? But she doesn't front much. So. I don't know what you should call us. But not that. Anywho.
That name was jarring to read.
?
The art style looks sus
Ooo what's that
I will think on it
> any other
Like. What are shows most people just definitely watch,  2000-22, and lines up with my tastes
I'm surprised there's a lot less anime on your anilist than I thought
Hm...
Loris is an honest person
Is it good
KLK?
Can I check yours
Cgdct:the account
Can I search someone's MAL
https://c.tenor.com/4srl9mi7uOQAAAAM/sayaka-maizono-sayaka-danganronpa.gif
Oh
Nova and lank would get along great
Novanity is still himself
Of course
I keep dropping off it.
A while
It's been..
Meet the Madokinsons
<@199928870810419200> what do you recommend
Oh hi colony
That sounds cute
Probably on spotify
What's girlish number?
Who's this cute girl
https://c.tenor.com/lJCUET1E_CMAAAAM/karasuma-chitose-girlish-number.gif
Wait-
Isn't it gruesome
another?
o
is the zestiria anime any good?
thats a lot of pink
why am I indecisive
I watched till 8 and got distracted
I like magical girls. lemme goog
finish elaina
Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, what's this
any good?
I see pretty girls in: Ange Vierge
lol
he probably didn't
loris make's every show sound like dogshit

anime pahe says different
whats pri connect
Why would I watch horsies
What's dog days
I like delta but. I am also a big idol nerd.
headache
imma just watch youtube when im done my stuff because
you know
is macross frontier boring
im scared
fuck
notsolo
ohno
dokidoki
im weirdly picky
none of the stuff sounds interesting apart from sakura
masterpiece
*rewatch time*
of people trying to reccomend stuff
after this whole hour
then do it
do it
its good
https://tenor.com/view/bananice-daiba-nana-revue-starlight-wild-screen-baroque-banana-revue-gif-24708166
maybe I should rewatch the revue movie
thinking is hard
you know
You don't realise, they're naked to symbolis-
Wasn't cocaine still in the recipe
I prefer coke, and choco milk
I don't really like orange stuff. But Fanta is still something I'd drink
Anywho
Coke didn't pull out, that's a weird thought
Though I do prefer coke
Why do I feel guilty for liking Fanta.
"our fizz is better! If you vote for coke, ya go up in smoke, vote for Fanta and you'll be as jolly as a panda I tell ya!"
Fanta politics.
https://youtu.be/HtoQyZ5Z5hk
Ouch
Doubt.
She's sure weird about being tickled
What have I stumbled upon
what did he make?
that might be what I was thinking of
I haven't seen it but. I heard bloom into you was the gayest
Huh.
d4dj was fun!
this madoka?
a hunch
you might like her
I do em to bring up stupid moments in games
I don't do them for the ss
i'm lucky with ss's
who
https://tenor.com/view/daiba-nana-revue-starlight-finger-comb-shoujo-kageki-revue-starlight-shojo-kageki-revue-starlight-gif-24221652
it's amazing tho
no
nft bros would've loved you
it's honestly a fun recap
why not try rondo?
https://tenor.com/view/daiba-nana-revue-starlight-camera-shoujo-kageki-revue-starlight-shojo-kageki-revue-starlight-gif-24221653
I love revue so much
wep
nothing stings quite like a flop
you mean that thing I chickened out of after half an ep because I was weirded out
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Two very different shows
Pog
From an outsider
It looks like it
I mean
Especially with the movie
Revue is probably my favorite anime
But garden of glass is the gayest fucking song. I know that
Love live is *murky*
Rev star is definitely gay. Mahiru has a  gay jealousy arc and really really fucking loves Karen
That's pog
Wait really
Revue starlight is definitely gay. Love live...a little. 
Garden of glass 
Stuff in aqours I don't remember 
**That scene in nijigasaki**
Don't think superstars was gay at all though.
<:NicoSmug:749327484511846580>

~~poor yu~~
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I remember that
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Huh

Butter
They're just Besties
Remember guys. If they cuddle, kiss, say "I love you" and have pictures of each other
Looks cute
Yuri?
What's it called
"maybe I judged you too harshly"

Isekai! A totally untapped genre
What's that
Ooo
Can't wait for more selfcest witch

*sees revue starlight in the not seen*
hm
ye
akame ga kill?
Is that mr bean
Banana is here
Or oranges.
No need for apples
But Nana has ||75 years|| on em
Maya is a prodigy. Claudine is very skilled.
It'd explain her proficiency in combat
Really. Really. Really good. At some things
Daiba should be like...
I remember when *that* arc first started
*Huh? Wait what? Huh???* (Revue starlight)
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Daiba and homura would be good friends
She's a gilf with really good skincare
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
So like...||is daiba older than the others?and by how much... She's been through this a good couple of semesters...||
Maybe I'll give it a look later today!
I'm curious!
I just thought, who's your profile pic ardania? It looks like female eren
And the sequel movie
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
This reminds me. 

I remember seeing macross deltas movie. And hating 3/4 of it. Everything felt so choppy.


But I loved every part of rondo. And it even spiced up the songs a little
I'm sorry <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Oh shit
The veggie giraffe haunts my dreams
The seasons were like. 6 months apart though
We've seen revue starlight, Twice. Rondo:once Movie:Once
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<a:aHikariHugMrWhite:608983155214647306>
Hikari Chan is pretty
Everything in school must be drilled into her skull
That's a lot of time to *not* be good
Do you think she's like. A really good writer/stage prepper
<:mugi_sip:762013567599247431>
Minecraft vr is basically a real world
I mean
Isekai
If so
Do they somehow find themselves trapped in a different world?
Interesting
Ahh
> I don't keep up with vtubers so it was a surprise
Essentially:
We loved her covers when we were like. 12-14
**lee and lie!**
People call her a vtuber now? Huh
Sorry.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

Fair.
You know what I mean
Gamers! For a second
I thought you were talking about uhh
Unless you know something I don't <:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
Movie 4 bb
We don't know if madoka will be positive yet
Actually
So I believe that fully
And that was just one clip
I don't think madoka had that much gore
I mean
<:HibikiCat:797429695187517460>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
This scarred you and made you retreat to the CGDCT we know you for?
So basically:
Who's elfen and why did they lie-
And I thought *meguca* was suffering
That is terrifying
Curious
Oh can I see what she looks like now?
Wait what
She just blood ballooned 3 people. Yet uh. I still feel nothing for those boys <:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
Ouch.
From what I know. Isn't Goku outrageously powerful
Huh
Makes sense
Had it coming but still
Oh wow. Just 15 seconds later and. Blood balloons <:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
The clip)
I watched until the girl revealed she told the boys
Demon *powers*
They say so
I know
I'm guessing she gets demon powers or something
Poor doggo...
I didn't know this existed till now
Lil fucking psychopaths
https://youtu.be/yjUAc_yuxQY
YouTube recommended me something horrid.
Uh
Damn.
That makes sense.
Nvm just SC. This starts on the FC climax lmao
Because I need my fix but not allowed play 3Rd
Decided to start watching the movie/ova for trails in the sky FC/SC

Straight men: hand shake
Lesbians: all of that 
Historian's:and they were roommates
LMAO
Besties behavior
> Anyways wanna get married (for tax purposes) and have a kid (as besties) and sleep in the same bed (because it's cheeper and easier to only have and need to make one) and cuddle every night (to stay warm)
Lemme find something
Thank Aidios for that
Ahhh
Religion?
Just say tags at this point then
Lmao
The channel is down. Not right.
It's not my fault men stink

I'll try it
She will!
She just met nana
Rn
Like
My girlfriend is starting the first ep
Speaking of
do you mean mail?
what's this "male" you speak of?
Kan'tade and Shirabae
Imo
And the movie Did it better
They're both madoka media
I mean
Yeah
I think rebellion was faster paced, which helped.
Rebellion 9.
The show, a 7.5. really liked it but it could improve.
I'd personally give madoka...
Damn
You don't know that
https://c.tenor.com/mqAFe5kR2xwAAAAM/anime-girl-rotate-rotate.gif
Yeah
At least the kid is adorable
Oof
I saw the missing poster lmao
Did satou kidnap this kid.
<@161155855524298752>
Oh she's *batshit* insane.
Pink hair girl is cool so far
Ew
I'm used to media drop kicking me
Wow this manager is evil.
Uh...
Wouldn't you want a girl to be nice?
Do they hate themselves
So they never lose
<:LanzhuConfused:849987913348546570>
They're happy
But if I insult them
It sounds gross
Those men are big brained
Didn't mean to insult you
I apologize
Can you say why? Without spoiling much
Ikik the sweeter the design the worse the psychological horror
It looks pretty cute so far, albeit a little weird
How come?
Not really
Something wrong?
?
That sounds depressing to me
Do people **actually** go to maid girl cafés
I'm giving it a go
So
My girlfriend recommended happy sugar life
Oh neat. Wonder if I'll ever read the book one

Psychological horror or music
I guess the genres would be
I guess something like:
Revue 
HSL 
Uhh...
Er...
Great question.
I feel sick and just wanna watch something
Can you guys recc anime
Yes you are
Ew

Oh
<@456226577798135808> you're a fan of the series chaos right
Is chaos head good
Imma have a think
Anything that's Nanoha and up is good though
Not a big fan of ultra old styles
Never heard
What's that
Hi
Idols are the middle of that
https://c.tenor.com/UtFPGAJMq_kAAAAM/rika-seto-d4dj.gif
I know
But left at halfway though s2
I've seen like 3/4 of k on
This reminds me
What's it about
https://c.tenor.com/HINGeKLJ8g8AAAAM/happy-sugar-life-war-crimes.gif
What's it about
Good or bad
What's she from
https://c.tenor.com/s25UAxWNniMAAAAM/noela-blink.gif
For a sec
A different demon girl
I thought that demon girl was
So idk how to feel
Well I've seen an Egg divulge in BDSM because of this show.
What
If this isn't fun sure
That mends the wound a little
?
This girl showed up
https://c.tenor.com/uV7hBCV6lrMAAAAM/iori-minase-imas.gif
Really?
Fair yeah
Also there's a strange amount of pretty boys for an idol girl show
My memories hazy on her too yet I love the show
Yeah fair.
https://c.tenor.com/zcaqzz-JWE8AAAAM/happy-anime.gif
Is it bad then..?
Damn
O-oh.
From the front anyways
Apart from the tail
She looks so much like finé
Is literally just good Finé isn't she
Angelica
<@161155855524298752>
Seems weird but cute
Hope it's good
Random chibi art style
Gonna try show by rock
What
definitely jam
yep

huh.
"she's one hell of a stalker" Yuno gasai? Noooo...
Yuki is way way way more high pitched than I remember
Ngl
I never did question yuuki though
I remembered yunos. For obvious reasons
Like...
As animepahes subs go so fucking quickly
Imma check 9animes subs.
Though uh
I mean I enjoyed it and still do
LMAO
Wait he does?
I watched this on a small Huawei last time
Tea biscuit's biscuits fuck this tea
Fuck it rewatch
Huh
I need to so uh
Might consider it after my Mirai Nikki rewatch
Oh is that the horsey anime?
what
/s
I completely forgot about this scene I'm not going to lie.
He DOES have parents
Omfg
<@456226577798135808>
lmao

where's the rest of it <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:millaSmile:785304156494626886>
What if they get mad because the souls of the characters are in there and their only chances at mobility and doing things are when you're playing the game?
Will it be good? Haven't seen the normal one
Huh.
neat
Lemme look
Favourite waifu, sonic
fenny seems like a yuri connoisseur
and Lank is the CGDCT guy
if you don't make out with your girl bestie. you're not besties
sounds hetero
<a:HuTaoPopcorn:831726598796869672>
so it's the latter ig
damn
it
""yuri""
or
yuri?
so like
you have to admit that song is pure LSD
"ei ei oh"
that'd make sense
why is there a demon btw?
but sounds interesting
some of that made LSD look like kids calpol
gay up*
I see I see
so it's gay
what's it about?
<:ShizuSweat:610988988064595984>
that was a different demon girl
thought
I
for a sec
what's that?
a young girl who's lost her arms with the scene around her looking like rock and rubble
is it
imma guess this anime is depressing
fatal twelve and danganronpa are nice as
but my other senses get lonely man
idk if it's my aspergers or what
the thing about manga is
I mean what
that purple hair girl looks so pretty
millhi lives in an anime
that's the name of the manga??
Belgium?
FUCK
(that's where he lives right)
bulgaria must be nice
hugs yeah obviously
never seen that here
???
what girls do you know millhi
what
hetero behaviour
I swear one girl fondles another
uhh. from the singular episode I saw
hm
> A narrative or visual work featuring a romance or sexual relationship between two or more females
like gridman subtext
the more broad you make it the easier you'll dissapoint someone who finds it too tame
I mean. depends on how far you go
I mean. what are ashes neccessary prerequisites for an anime to be classified as Yuri
the only manga I've read is death note
chika?
uhh
fuck what was her name
you mean rikka and angy god girl?
huh?
wh
aren't anime openings notorious for spoiling half the shows?
Hm
why couldn't I be a cis 4'11 girl, for shame
I wish I was shorter

that's because I'm 5'11 and I'm always sitting though
same
jk
fenny old granny confirmed?
describe the demon girl show in one sentence
ok
makes sense
ahh
I don't believe in reincarnation, but I sure hope it exists
r/im14andthisisdeep
idk what that means lank
proud of you
like
wtf is a soul
this reminds me
hmmmm
** **
what if something bad happens lmao
the idea of souls rubbing together
idk
like
that sounds gross
I mean what
good
hetero
who
not today
if it's not gay
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I was tempted but ash made it seem non yuri
as they're texty but I can still hear things
and other jrpgs
<a:ShizuPeekers:766667132234629121>
"you'll get a little taller"
"but being evil brings no good!""
Then sure
Buy the hydraulic press
This seems charming
Just means I've to go gamer mode
I've noticed
I already see hand holding
time to see if ash was right or not
but yeah the show sounds interesting...so.
having no spine is totally fine
damn
please do
so is my posture good?
I'm not bisexual
Dubbed is pretty bad yes
(idk what that is)
Think Gordon Ramsay ever has a cheeky nandos?
True
It feels implied momo feels something and it's ep 3
I mean
They're teens
This is very tasteful now that I think about it
Honestly
What was ash thinking?
Shamiko
But it feels semi implied that momo likes our demon girl
It's not *loud* Yuri.
Like
Just finished ep 3

Probably
Hmm...
True true
Now onto S2 for you
https://c.tenor.com/nOqtNN_bS4gAAAAM/anime.gif
It's great yeah

(reusing is fine but it was jarring)
With the last 40ish minutes feeling okay
3/4 of it feels choppy and not edited together well. (It's almost all old scenes from the season)
But to me
It's more so an alternate timeline, things have changed.
Okay so...
Never heard of it
Good jokes and good vibes
It's pretty good imo
Imma watch ep 12 of S2 tmr
I really like it
<:momoThink:692155059059949609>
<:shamiThink:692148937565405214>
Speaking of anime, have you seen any demon girl next door
Ahh, the young one who somehow bullshited her way in
||"Freyja wi**on death**"||
Starts looking up her name
I wanted to see freyja art
Like
||Freyja dies||
I can't remember if it's the first or second movie but
Heaviest spoiler:
HEAVILY deviate
But I do know some parts which
*maybe*
Uhh
<:shamiPray:715014096101179453>
damn
<:shamiShock:692148606198874182>
It is!
So...I might with that one someday
With demon girl next door? I really wanna know what's next
But
I feel like something is missing when I'm reading
I really like auditory and visual stimuli.
Nah
Ye
I think it is
Lmao
I see
Ohh
what is that show you shill again
<@161155855524298752>
So*
Gay is always good so I will
<:shamihug:692155686242484264>
Imma watch ep 2 then sleep
I really dig it, talking in live post
Wait. The priestess agreed. Uh.
Hhh
<:momoNo:692149079207051275> you see a girl levitating in a bright yellow light and you're observing boobs
> I couldn't see her face very well, but even from afar, she had pretty big boobs
I see
Why is this random smuck here
Does he get transed
I'm so confused
<:momOffended:744326128956735588> <:momoDeadInside:692148171853398016>
The protagonist is a boy????
Your opinion is invalid
And that's homo as hell
He also denied demon girl next door being gay
> I never learned how to read - Pit 2011
POG
Is executioner gay btw
That boy literally looks like Rean from cold steel
Women are pretty and cute!
Is this news? LMAO
?
I'm in deep
I'm homosexual
~~women pog women pog~~
I saw that anime
Average christian mom
<:momoDeadInside:692148171853398016>

Hi lankers
I thought you were gonna make her say something bad or hetero
OH
Millhi, do not taint yuri
yes
objection hearsay
I admit nothing!
I mean uh
done did!
I think I'm a tad gay
You know
LMAO
I just think that
Boys should love boys, men should love men, girls should like girls, women should like women
Then shouldn't it be
same sex is pretty poggy
It conveys the same message
??????
whats the difference
Oh millhi's pic is still the dino
women/women poggers
<:momoThink:692155059059949609>
<:GanyuDizzy:809894001205444618>

?
Gonna watch ep 4 tmr
Im really enjoying executioner
Why do lank and fenny have such good reccs btw
Butt kick!
I'll take that as a maybe
And enjoying it

Who's the gal in your pic
As it's new
There's a very obvious *tell* that the last 40 minutes, flows better
Which wouldn't be too bad If that didn't feel so obvious
They plucked scenes from the show
Delta's movie looks so obviously spliced it hurts
And if you just watched it on its own, nothing would look weird.
It feels fresh, doesn't feel like it was spliced in a day
Is rondo rondo rondo
I think a very good example of a ***GOOD*** recap movie
Even for a recap it feels bad
Yeah
please don't assault
