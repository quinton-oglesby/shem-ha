Reddit feed was a thing but somehow didn't work right
never underestimate how much people ignore things like channel rules unless they're shoved into their faces
<@!102691114762371072> a directions command for kirichan, because there will inevitably be lots of people coming here to talk about XV once it starts, and most will probably just dump things in general
so my terribly passive aggressive thought is along the lines of `#symphogear-discussion exists; go there`
I mean <#407060923078017026> exists, also channel bloat
I always have photoshop on hand too

that's why it'd be better to recrop the original video frame
yeah the circle clips into the image frame, so it looks hella wonky
recropping the whole frame would be a better choice probably
too much? too little? guessed wrong?
and also since it's just a capture of the PS window, none of the actual transparency works
https://i.imgur.com/9IgFZZP.mp4 fixed render width
should have put the colorization on, but I guess that works too
the intensity ramps up really quick
that was like from 83 to 71 on the reds
sliders are wonderful, with 3 clicks adjustments have been made
I can lower the intensity too, so it becomes more subtle
without changing the whole image's color scheme it kinda has to
tried something, might need to add some under the lines itself to keep them from disappearing into the pixels
that probably affects the skin tone a bunch too, soooo...
you could adjust the saturation of the reds, but then her under shirt would pop out too much, unless you mask it out of the adjustment selection
I can try some PS magic too at some point
too much saturation IMO
if you want to fix the artifacting from it first and then upscale, it should be fine
small detail enlarged produces tons of artifacting that can only be fixed by repainting
I did waifu2x to 1.6 from the original
I have no idea what aspect ratio discord uses, I'm guessing 1:1
hold on I'll fix the remaining mask errors
does the artifacting need to be painted over?
shading and contrast!
does the hand need to be bigger, because with some clever editing the hand can be made bigger
Serenamonch yes, more eating chibis
thinking about it somewhat too critically; how many people overall watch anime on youtube? and how many of those are wiling enough to seek out a community server on discord? I'd say the number is not that large for needing a new channel
not that it matters, like, at all, when it's all small and emote like
I can see the brushwork <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
it's cleaner and kinda nicer looking IMO
I have that exact same image, but I had removed the branch shadows and other stuff
I'd say that needs the usual bg remove of course, and some touchup on the lighting etc. front
I like the bored chris tv one because of the things I watch
you could have just cloned over the blue part, so that it would still be a square
to me it looks like the face is a bit too wide compared to the mouth
I'd think one like that would probably not get enough use to be worth it in the long run, and besides, <#407060923078017026> is kinda the image dump central where you can talk and show off stuff when you want to
I think its mostly dependent on the streamer's wan, because if I were to strem something, it'd be disastrous
but yeah, party games like jackbox games are good if you have one who streams the actual game screen, but then lag is a thing
I think that's just discord's stream servers being janky as always
and I mean, people do that a lot here anyway
I read the doopliboop too, and it really sounds like it's mostly for RP purposes
hey, a knife joined us!
yay, sieluveljiä täälläkin!
most likely probably
A devil appeared!
Ooh the country of chad joined
good choice
nyaa is pretty safe tbh
judging by the name, most likely
apparently less of a lurker than me
pallero sounds like a finnish name
AXZ aired sundays 1.00 am JST, GMT+9
I tested a bit and waifu2x produces pretty great result if you want a bigger version
I could pretty easily make it into a gif, but I'm lazy af
I've shot RK62 a bunch of times in FDF
too bad RK95 didn't have much screentime
it's kinda cool if you're into guns and their designs
Heavy object is kinda military too, but it's much more futuristic
are Aoharu x machinegun and Stella jogakuin considered military, since they're airsoft
I hope so, since I have an early morning and 6 hours of lectures tomorrow
I'm planning on building the billion maiden gatling gun
it'll be a miracle if I can get it working even half decent, since billion maiden is not a standard weapon type
if the stars align just right and I have enough motivation this summer, I'll be building an airsoft gun for myself
I'm most likely going to buy a Steyr AUG A3 airsoft at some point
150cm tall inner pillow for $99
for what it's worth, there's a sale on animedakimakurapillow.com
I was debating on getting a daki few months back, but just couldn't settle on a cover
a mattress like the Tio one is a bit more difficult
you can wrap it around stuff and it's (probably) easier to store
the 7m long pillow
tbh, I like the Miia one more
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAvZTiLUwAE_G4i.jpg
here's the body pillow of her
the giant one with huge melons
I assume, since it has MON printed on the front
it's Tio from monster musume
https://i.imgur.com/UGe1KLY.jpg
have an Anya
Most of the senran kagura girls are pushing the limit for me
https://i.imgur.com/gVqMrDM.jpg
small/medium is my preference

all breasts are great, unless they're way too large

my favorite xkcd jokes are the xkcd phone ones
that Tio pillow would be super comfy if you have the space for it

https://k60.kn3.net/DF279DBF8.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/sJTwlh7.png
anyway, back to cute girls
something like Uni's transformed rifle would be so hard to make
I just like the weapon designs from games and anime, and how they would work IRL
and after that, if I can somehow make it functional, I'm going to try and make Ryona's twin pistol from senran kagura
man, grinding megadimension is so fun

Dragon's crown was bit of an overkill on the boobs department
https://i.imgur.com/I8c8KKp.jpg
I found a few others in wallhaven, so you could try searching there too
I like scrolling wallpapers
If only the pole Kiri was wider picture I would take it
Them potatoes look way too human
I just remember them by their battle stance
They look a lot like Hisui and Kohaku from Melty blood
or is just more memorable
for me it's just a character that I like for some reason more than others
and/or
gotta love that gun nut and the lonely goddess
with this Bond naming system, my waifu(s) would be Uni and/or Noire
you only live twice
evryone's gotta have at least one waifu, right?

This reminds me a lot of Lost Planet 2's loading screen
at least in the north
also, that's the Finnish police emblem
police reindeer are a thing in Lapland

Of course, in theory, mail is a thing that exists
AFAIK, it's super hard to find in other countries
The tagline is: world's most hated - Finland's most loved
Here's a funny ad for the ice cream variety https://youtu.be/nJBBakWOeEQ

I can recognise that black and white checkers pattern from anywhere
I want to point out that in the Elfnein/Kirika picture Elfnein is eating salmiakki (salty liquorice) which is a very divisive candy

It's so good

btw, I'm a Finn sooo...
A swede!? Then you're my natural enemy
I'll be on the road again in a few moments
But on the topic of twintails girls, I even have Black Heart as my lock screen wallpaper
Tail Red is the best in Twintails
hence why Noire and Uni are my top girls
I like twintails a lot too
I think Chris's hair is cut shorter at the top leaving the twintails (or quadtails) longer
unless on mobile, you could just edit out the :large part of the filename and it works
mind expansion meme happens
https://imgur.com/a/BhkHj bunch of cute stuff ahoy
I saw those cat thingies on amiami earlier today, considered ordering
now Miku should double dog dare them to do something
I've always used utorrent
"(sinä) pystyt siihen" is the actual better translation
I want to point out one thing; "sinä voit tehdä sen" translates to "you can do it" but it's more like "you are allowed to do it"
if you didn't notice it, google translate is awful at finnish
that's almost straight out of Nyanko days
yay Megami posters https://i.imgur.com/Xt7piJ8.jpg
my first thought was Akari from Aria
I think some places in japan sell hats like that
kitty ear hat!
178cm?
I'm just above Cag and slightly below Adam
I'm 180cm, and that's almost below average around here
probably some leftover food bits
it kinda looks like she's trying to dig something out of her lower jaw with her tongue
https://imgur.com/a/YCXWDKy chibi fox girls!
in the tent yeah
https://m.imgur.com/a/i0LTRSU 21 pics of Tamamo goodness
so in this case it will be closer to 40e
can't remember from the top of my head, but it actually should include shipping
exempli gratia, a certain chris figure I ordered cost around 150e, so I'll have to pay around 36e of VAT, which is 24% here
whenever I order something from wherever, I just have to pay VAT for it
why do you have to pay 25gbp in import
maria is the tallest of the main cast and she's just below 170
I'm between Adam and Cag
when did germany give up on conscription?
mandatory service ftw
we were allowed fingers above eye, but the proper way is closer to your temple

oh, that's pretty recent change then
big or crazy...
do they have the 7m Miia one or the Tio mattress
r/madlads material
those scalp massage things are amazing btw
https://youtu.be/UjjTMNDZi-A literally the first 2 seconds
that pointing image is from Death Parade btw
well you have to find the original image of the meme
I mean, it's from r/animemes if that helps
chibi chris doing anything is too cute
And the edge lines are different too I think
Yeah the models aren't as sharp most of the time
MMD/MikuMikuDance is a 3d animation software
Somehow I'm thinking that's MMD
I like Maria, but I still fly Chris' colors

I like that 404 squad pic
katta, GAHAHA
yes, Hibiki Ganaha, from im@s
heyy, hibiki
cruise control for cool
or just fuck it and go with wingdings
copperplate gothic is also pretty good but it has serifs
my mom does a lot of print work so fonts are a thing I'm somewhat familiar with
dafont also has tons of cool options if you want to search
I like castellar, but some sans serif would be simpler
comic sans
look at that, a best girl appeared
she needs her bunny ears
K-sha and S-sha are so close I should call it shared first place

anyway, here's best older sister
okay, going by the events in the games, she's like less than a month younger
uni? of course she's about same as gear
going by the releases, nep jr is 7 years old

correction: that is 3 years old, so neps is about 8 years old now
apparently neps is 5 years old
I love everything nep

I'd say highly unlikely
selfcest must be popular enough for nep to not be first
Congrats to Neptune for being the first anime girl to be squeezed to death by her own self
that's what the reddit title said at least

all this interdimensional shenanigans

school starts tomorrow/today and I'm pretty excited
I just got myself a bodypillow and now these start popping up

just played like 6 hours of VIIR
now GFL and neps need a collab with just Uni
uni's next form could straight up be just chris

no yume or kaoru tho
thems good tojis
and speaking of removable processors
removable processor units tho
still, way expensive
with the preorder bonus it's not too bad, about 200 eur
32k jpy on amiami
speaking of figures, I really want this one, but god damn is it expensive
I like figs and shirts, but I never want to put stuff up on my walls
my weeb extends out of my phone since I even have the axz chris phonecase
the filter is annoying and finicky since it made my previous black heart picture all cyan
that's the original
I just really liked the image, so I put it on the lock screen
my phone's lock screen is noire
I like my scrolling wallpapers

oooh, sporty noire

happy tsunday
mysterious heroine needs to stay fit
I think people ship kanami and yume because kanami just wants to fight tougher opponents and yume wanted to be the best
men don't scream coming in with the rwby nep crossover


I was thinking it should probably be

would 2 tsun guns get along; uni & WA2000
yay for VA crossovers

and even if it accidentally is jpg_large, you can rename the file to be .jpg
what's this about nep channel!?


not to forget big-nep, but that's another thing
she's the nep of another dimension
they're good dresses, but too bad they were only used in  one scene in the anime

what a wonderful situation
Moar thunder buff hiyoyon!
I like the 4GO goddess designs

double black heart all the way across your screen
here's big nep showing off the skorts
sure
it looks like a skirt but it's more like shorts if you ask me
feels more breezy down there
because she's not used to wearing a skirt/dress
look at this cool uzume
funny how my most played game on the first DS was tetris DS

have gear before I leave work
that chibi chris picture is always so fun

oh wow, yumekui merry, haven't seen that in a while

it does make the image somewhat funnier
I was thinking that was made with radial blur, but it doesn't create the same effect
there are a ton of free quality brushes out there
I kinda expected that I couldn't render a lensflare on a different layer and shift the color, so I downloaded a lensflare brushpack
back to hunting monsters for me then

ump sisters are so popular




that image was posted on reddit 20h ago
AFAIK it was just announced
and most likely they'll have the most popular ones like springfield and suomi
they'll probably have a whole line of these, 404, AR squad, etc.
now get ready to blow all extra cash on these
soppo has good style

negev, size: smol
so now jericho is negev's big sister apparently


I really like M14 in every shooter

a cinnamon roll and her cool sister







all kinds of good girls from HK

oh shit, another suomi figure

yes, neps is kinda my addiction and the reason nep is being lewd in the channel description

<@!102691114762371072>


Schnee is good, and kerrik has probably spammed more
y'all're getting way off topic again, so here's soppo
no, an alternate reality little sister loli vert
means book breast
kirjarinta is a good and cool name too
and half of the cast has either swedish or finnish names
their fucking city is called kankkunen, which means a hangover
y'all wanna talk about goofy language specific names and other dumb anime! let me introduce you to knight's and magic

yeah it should be those, since it's team 404
oh man this is cool phone wallpaper

santagear

dogev

even if I don't understand the writing, I understand the memes




speaking of better censored versions, PTRD is much better without that massive underboob
also G41 has a skirt on the other servers too
this is a good one
also, 9A-91 is in serious need of pants too
as the creator said, she's lood and nobody knows what kind of animal she is supposed to be
http://gfl.zzzzz.kr/doll.php?id=62&lang=en it deactivates on the victory animation
usually it's active
ye, it's a targeting device in her eye
gotta address the camera
also AEK-999 being just her
it's G41 and she wants headpats

https://youtu.be/XMTEfKVw_nc this one
and the opening is really good too, and I could speculate a lot from it
not that fang wasn't generic already, but I liked him
oh yeah, the male MC is also the most generic character ever
it's not only a nep game, but a weird crossover of all kinds of CH and IF games
^^that's the female MC
mega miracle force looks so interesting, but it's a mobile game...


DA NYAAA

I don't want to say yet, but it should be actually usable and useful for me right now
need some PETG
I do have a cool little thing in the works that I'll try and print out next week or after christmas, or whenever I get new materials
I will most likely try out a couple other things if I have time
probs not for at least like 2-3 months
design/print parts and glue them onto a glove
I like sop's custom arm, and it would be a fun project to recreate a hand prop like that

the AL nep art is good and even better without the gear


that's pretty cute
probably not, but hopefully artisan knows how to make proper ports
nep wants you to buy supernep rpg, even if it releases internationally next year
also, that's the dlc catsuit from cyberdimension
I had posted that in hiero too earlier
big tiddy girls are popular for these
a best girl appeared!
mount and load that light machine gun







there's also a highly nsfw version of this too on pixiv
super shorty is super cute too

also this 5-7 costume that I really want, it looks so good
this is the one was announced on the korean server
TMP's new costume was announced yesterday and there's already art of it

da nyaa
her left boob is somehow shrunk
black in white
there's been a lot of mp90 images on the subreddit


ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ



I want thunder, but she isn't on EN servers yet
that's calico and thunder
shirabot got probably clogged at some point

because I know t. has been used on 4chan at least, but it's a finnish writing thing
I wonder if that mug(?) says to or t.
G36 is so good

JP server has really good seasonal costumes
but it is called retirement/disassembly in the menu

I hope this works
smol tsuns are always good


puppy M4 so cute


ohohojousama wawa


her victory animation is fun, she just flips her gun around with ease
aek stronk



also da nyaa is pretty much a meme, pp2000 is more common for me at least
so 1:10:00 is either 2* or rarely 5*
IDW, a common 2* annoying smg, has same production time as other 5*

nyaa da nyaa
if you have more, do go on
intermission



She's her favorite unit so far
My gf drew a da nyaa

the tsun is strong



anti rain puppies are good too
it's smol AN and AK

pretty scarecrow

G36, best girl





I would buy whatever she's selling

now it's some 2 hours of sleep for me

negev is super popular for some reason












yay loligev



this is a cute login screen for TW server


AUG looks so nice



imoko has really fun stuff


soon we'll get AUG

I don't remember much from mw3, but my top ones were MK14 and PKP

G36 has great costumes, and a lot of them




hey, green suomi
not sure if this should be nsfw








of course there's a shimakaze cosplay pic


have a cute god eater too

<@!102691114762371072>
never followed gundam, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
that reminds me, I should get a switch

twintails! I really should start using her








ah, wawa is so pretty

no cinnamon roll emoji, so croissant it is 🥐







also cute himitsu heiki
cute bunneh



yay a proper sopdog
massive hat!



I know I've posted this before, because that ice cream looks a lot like a dick

I'm waiting for the VA11 hall-A collab, but I'm not excited about it



I wanted this costume, but no scared wawa for me

sten is fun too; TWINTAIL WHIRLIND
angery meido is good too, up to lv.99 for me so far
looks a bit like she's taken some cues from soppo
I love exoskeletons
and her skill makes her almost broken
I love this LWMMG mod3 art
1887 is the recently added 5* shotty
because tilebuffs and skills
because she isn't that good on her own, but a good mod3 LWMMG might make her really useful
I was thinking maybe trying to use M1887 once digimind comes around
rare SPP art
ah, I'd love to have her

also, my 45 has been doing really good tanking most maps
ak12 and AN will be fun
oh yus, more puppy defy

I'll probably manage to clear a couple maps today too
I haven't had much time to play because school/event planning reasons, but I managed to clear act 1 yesterday

/gfg/ has some good art sometimes



twintail powah!
ayy, that death parade pose is always so good

the many breeds of IDW
/gfg/ is in full M200 mode




eventually her nickname will probably be clamp legs
her full art is nice too
ooh the intervention art is starting to show up

gentiane needs more art of her

someone even went ahead and "fixed" her art
`I mean I'm not trying to make fun of how long her legs are, I'm merely pointing out that with legs that long she doesn't need a sniper rifle to attack people who are far away when she can just kick them.`

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
speaking of tsun \\\(^^)/

<:Ver:336656981144109066>

how is singing chris so darn cute
I give my life not for honor, but foooor youuu
🎺 🎺 🎺 🎺 🎺
what a fear in my heart
I'm searching and I'll melt into you
...what a thriiiill
what a thrill....


yay more gentiane art

so far it's been nothing (the standard), spats, and now leggings
people really like to put different legwear on M200

rare F2000 art

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
even the handgun squad is doing a gainax reference
I've no idea about the outfit; some people on reddit said something about gunbuster, but of course people also referenced gurren lagann, so who knows
it's referenced in fanart pretty often
of course the pose is straight out of gainax
no idea, but it's carcano M1891 in some costume

maybe so, not completely exposed at least
\\\(^^)/




gfg got into feetposting for a moment


http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1551300263153.jpg
97 is real cute
best design right here







yay more gentiane


nyanspasu

but she's a cute dumdum

\\\(^^)/

yay Uni


excuse me interven-chan, but what are you doing
smol ro is great

they're all so cute together
everyone likes 416
oh yeah, pps-43 is light and she's proud of it
spyce x yryr
says on the right too
pps-43 is light


T-5000 is beautiful and pretty good

o7




T-5000, the toku nerd needs more art
45 is cute, usually hypersmug badass

I have a pair of her in my airsoft collection
bless happy 45

\\\(^^)/

mama springfield

specifically ground infantry
even got the FDF emblem
🇫🇮


need more gentiane
yeah, anmi does way too many costumes for suomi while RFB and K2 have barely any
same with anmi and suomi, which is the reason both have massive amounts of costumes
I like it when artists love their own characters, like imoko with G36


Speaking of murderfriends, I like this scene when negev and soppo are stuck in the jammed zone


but also there's the TMP bug that made her a yandere by accident
if anyone was yandere it would be one of these two
negev and soppo are the murder happy friends



belt is of course edited in, but T-5000 looks so good
another smug russian
like T-5000
some of them are really good


soppo puppies!


http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1551915998974.gif
either of those is going to be fire




the gag anime could adapt parts of the comic anthology, since those are fun and cute too
https://streamable.com/oz00z this one
someone should make a gfl version of that one yuru yuri scene
https://youtu.be/wyEZso9cuO4
https://i.imgur.com/1a4dsWX.gif
twintail powah! double the firepower


her hairstyle is very much akko




rare ameli art
since NNB was so good I can post this again
nyanspasu~



like ribeyrolles or type97
if they did look at the irl performance, most of them would be pieces of shit

futbol!





reading the wiki, apparently anmi did the houkago no pleiades manga adaptation too, which is weird surprise

mk23 is pretty


<@!102691114762371072>






qbz sisters are so good
also, M14 is one of the best weapons in that game, along with FAL, because they're the only semi-auto non-sniper rifles
well, it's a timed screenshot from modern warfare 2




short hair black heart is cute too
:3
\\\(^^)/



could be, but no visible cross hairpin so who knows


danyaa!

I want a super shorty, but no luck on heavy prod






:DDDDD

poor vector
If anything, I'd rather just be Gentiane
I'm bad at headcanons and always end up going dark souls 2, "without really knowing why"
it is fun how some artists portray their SKKs with multiple rings on their fingers like some kind of pimp
or as some people like to call t-doll harems, arsenals
no harems allowed
if I ever oath someone, it'd probably be G36


weird how searching for a specific character on pixiv results in a lot of porn






best maid is just the best

not saying it's bad, but what
next manga chapter looks pretty good

http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1553100780666.gif

yeh, I steal from reddit, sometimes from gfg, and rarely I'll browse what's new on pixiv
MAITO
MJÖLK

gentiane, A+ commander
but I like almost all anime art in general
I just shove so much stuff here that I see
even the gfl playerbase here is kinda small, like 6 people in total
in other news
\\\(^^)/
and I don't have the time/patience/storage to do that
I would just vaccuum up everything I see and it'd be thousands of images in a single day
and this has been mainly just from reddit
yah, whenever these games gain traction and more artists get on board, the volume goes so damn high
I might as well scale back a bit too
there's just *so much* of it




1294 proper gopniks
fuze ace incoming

way bigger than they should be
well her tits are massive

this costume has been the source of many jokes
soppo's enhancement line says christmas tree (assuming that the upgrade parts are tree decorations),  and ameli's hairstyle, especially in the christmas costume, makes her look like a christmas tree
which is the case for most KC and AL art
yeah, without their represented guns they're more or less just cute anime girls

MachoP5 is great

that is one of the best unigear pics I know
shoulder and hands look a bit too big

that bang dream x XDU chris looks so cool

http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1553357292285.jpg rare marvelous art

red works better
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
for the background, remember KISS, keep it simple stupid
okay it looks good, but on the technical side I think the outline stroke effect is a bit too thick

have an AUG A3
all things considered, this should be in <#371105434771390465> but whatevs
https://nyaa.si/view/1100061 they apparently have plenty of seeds to go around, so downloading shouldn't be an issue
and their typesetting is really good too
my rec is chyuu-PAS, since they did a very commie/asenshi/yametetomete work with subbing the songs too
they have a memesub version too
flysubs?
there's been a lot of fansubbing done with it so nyaa is probably the best bet
the biggest problem kinda is how you can watch it; since I believe it was released on amazon video or something with terrible subs
anyway, <@!193408538909868033> the great banana demands you to watch it
also the songs are more background music
only the musical aspect is somewhat similar to symphogear
and I really like that song
damn, I can't find any video on the revue of blooms, because that would work well even out of context
semi magical musical girls
basically that
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
you can watch the whole show in about 50 minutes over at <#377148557796442134>
she and saijou, the blonde in the pics, are kinda like rivals and often do spend time together



imoko's cat is cute


can female (looking) androids create offspring between them? apparently yes






kerrik could sift through his folders, but that's just more work for him
I've seen that image before, but it was a part of a bigger one, which might be the reason other programs can't find it
yah, only direct uploads
I should make that noire into my pfp


No capitalization is the best form







type97 gets so little art

no ship name fits better than unigear, I love it
and she herself says nowa couple times
hence nowa
because in japanese it's spelled no-wa-ru

DEAD ON!
oh yeah, today is 5-7, at least in those backwards countries that indicate dates that way

praise imoko

praise the tails
found them!
mk23 all the way in the back
no, that's our angery meido
M21 in the middle-ish, super shorty with shrimp in the back, type97 front middle, himitsu heiki on the right, and G36 is somewhere

So as I pray, UNLIMITED CORE WORKS!```



http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1557439572567.jpg

she will rule the S09



assuming she doesn't have a child, I'd think she is immune to the hairstyle's curse
I wonder why there's so many gfl girls with kamen rider references

praise imoko

also animemes weren't really my thing until like 2015, so I've missed a lot on that front
I don't follow many of the older memes
hay that's almost the nepface


I'll have to start a long term project at some point to get into sport shooting in order to eventually buy a HK243, which is a civilian G36

of course being a trash weeb is one thing, but studying networking could qualify me as some kind of nerd
I can't think of anything I'm a nerd for
I'm really bad with history<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
huh, gotta remember her's is right after mine

basically more of the girls with guns stuff
sometimes they are grouped with GFL stuff in stores like animate
it's a line of little gun replicas, and they also do some air rifle (I think) events
those make me think of little armory
it's ya girl <@!102691114762371072>
soon-ish

:3

I too should just replay the rebirths, even though I still have og hdn to play

easiest is to just look up the textbox design of each game
all my neps screenshots are a mess
it's probably rb1 yeah
this one
she says it in rebirth 2 I think, because the CG includes all candidates
she only does everything
apparently nepgen has some quality memery around E3
why is there no cinnamon roll emoji
I really liked the scenes in nepU



if only I knew how to draw (good), I would do so much uni art

I love this guy's art, also so much nsfw

chris poi

🐇





kaniini is the proper word, but kani is fine
kani is a fun word, since it also means bunny in finnish
commonly known as nekogear


not yet, though those bang ones are pretty fun
I like scrolling wallpapers
landscape
<@!263983345669505025> hjälpa mig, I need a new phone wallpaper; I had the zenbu arsenal for a long while, so chris and something along 18:9 aspect ratio is what I'm after
like when I imagine a box with a side length of 40cm, I always think it's pretty small, but then when I have a box that size it's pretty big
I never think about it but 30cm (I'm comparing to myself here) is surprisingly long
in the height chart isn't she like 150cm
they look like ears, even if they're more like an updo
she even has a cat ear hat, which is so cute
maria, compared to the others, seems so tall, but when her cat ears go just past 170 she suddenly seems shorter

it's dumb comedy
you should watch that show, it's great
it got irritated/infected after trying to put a contact lens on
it was the easiest and fastest screenshot for me to take

and in kanata no astra's case, aries' heterochromia is so light people don't even notice it
sometimes it looks pretty cute, but often it's pretty overdone




Leiur in revue gear is pretty good because of how flashy that show is





anyway, if you got the money, I highly recommend https://www.varusteleka.com/en/product/sarma-tst-tactical-jeans/58865
was pretty pricey though, but at 90€ I don't have to get new ones for a long time
also stretches a lot
I just bought some pretty good ones; fits great, has several giant pockets, and does pretty well in the outdoors








>w<



yay anya



I really like klara since she's one of the only ones actually speaking russian
how weird to find these in /revue/ and /nepgen/

karen from revue

I guess these two have been here before but they're so good
huh,  cool that revue and TnM gets mixed a bit




you see the swing coming from a mile away, and it's the most powerful swing in the game




9A-91 in her maid costume








probably not as easy as tap and hold
oh yeah, instagram is garbage because it's designed to be so mobile centric
I overall like OG imas more, but anastasia is the best CG

side M was very fun
could be kirari, she's huge
and after I did some adjustments
when it shows up, based on this
new avatar, yay
I think momo should be in the middle
cute 97



ye
fun fact, musa in finnish is slang for music<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

now that's an old one

usually yes
pretty much
vector's name in gfl
that's a weird crossover, black heart and vivi

afaik sometimes people there just draw things and don't upload them anywhere else



K11 is so good <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>

<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

mobages on the wider market do avoid using swastikas, and just decorate with iron crosses

https://twitter.com/sYnstyle_/status/1038661811959025664 also because this exists

and I guess ver is in jail because of rule lawyering
casual game of monopoly
🍁 and the best wintails in the game
speaking of more classical art, a parody portrait of our president was recently published in our newspapers and it's pretty good
also side note; that is pretty much the twist in re:creators
compared to classic western, which takes a whole lot of effort to make something that doesn't burn your eyes out
the anime style is simple and easy to learn, and with some added skill, can make wonderful pictures
I mean, with a *very* generous estimate, you have a single country with 30+ *million* artists alone cranking this stuff out as a hobby

so many chibis

saiga is fun







some are so damn cheesy
uniel/unist and other anime fighting games have some of the best titles and fight starting lines

I really want one of those, only problem is no money or license yet




for a batch process yes, but for one (1) file!?
like changing a .log into a .txt
why would someone change a file type if just editing the file extension is enough

probably someone who hasn't read the xkcd standards one

this is pretty fun crossover, apparently rista and suomi are both voiced by aki toyosaki

oh yeah, mlp would have definitely been at the top
fastest art ever produced is probably when pokemon announces new characters and the porn people make of them

also, after that show I realized that those two just vanished after two episodes
side tails are also just cute, and work great for twins
the blue scrunchie+side tail reminds me a lot of aoi from aikatsu
M1887 and eugen have very similar styles, kinda like sop and roon

and then green homete
sometimes I forget g41's actual name, because homete




<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>  it's been so long since I've watched anything before GX
the S1 pistols were fused into the reflector assisted beam cannon
of course the reflectors are often forgotten, buuut they're not that relevant anyway
yeah, I believe the pistols came in AXZ because I remember them recycling a bit of animation with them
those are the megadeath party missiles
and speaking of side tails, twins, and idols, ami and mami are pretty fun
I always enjoy the pervy saiga jokes

I love this event

an useful comment I made once on reddit
```A fun little fact about sourcing, anime especially. If you see something on pinterest, that is not the original. Ever. Even if it can be only found on that piece of shit, it is still not.

Every google search should include an automatic -site:pinterest.* to filter out that shitty site.```
<@!471416654346321930> don't worry about it, I just digged the source out of spite because I hate that site so much
this had the lucky thing that it was done through a pin link, so the twitter url was still there
https://twitter.com/otokam1117/status/1032980037044068353 there, I fucking hate pinterest, it's the cancer of internet, everything about it just awful, and I wish it would die and burn away

sopmod 2/soppo/sopdog, has many names, but is recognizable because of her mechanical arm, red streak of hair, and headset resembling ears
sopdog is always cool


they looks so similar in that style
I actually thought leiur was ark royal

if I didn't know lappland was an arknights character, I'd be very confused
this guy is so good when they do these movie crossovers

🐱


c# equivalent would be c.write, or console.write

when I got my pink P90 skin in modern warfare, I set my clan tag to Pchan
that looks a lot like lewis, but with red eyes and cat ears
I always think of that kanade pic when this appears in budokan, even though it's a twist on starbucks
I want to say watch budokan, but it's probably not exactly what y'all would be looking for
or morioka moriko more officially
morimori from net-juu no susume

I love these chibis

should be fairly simple to do in illustrator, but getting any good outcome would take some work nonetheless

spoilered just in case, usual soppo and mild gore



there was a bunch of soppo posting on gfg
too bad she doesn't have her SF arm

like on reddit with the repost sleuth bot, a post from like 4 months ago is good, but even daily reposts people really start disliking it
reposts aren't that bad when they're spaced out in a larger timeframe, but with 2 hours and total of 11 other messages inbetween reposts, it's kinda already seen

oh yeah, would not be surprised if a .bat script thing causes issues with subs
there's a whole fight about how VLC is bad for anime and how its visuals are bad, but all the issues are so minor, you woyldn't even see them usually
and that's why you don't use default players
unless he got some .ass files somehow, which are subs
yeah, it can be h264 or h265 video, but the thing is that everything on nyaa usually works without any issues
this is either or, no inbetween
is it a .mkv or .mp4

marine is really good for all the ecchi talk and sometimes touhou nerding, but there's always of course ochame kinou <https://youtu.be/9kQ2GtvDV3s>
they also have english captions which is a plus, but I don't want to occupy more of <#336297674707828747> space with this talk
I think the hologura shorts could be an easy starting point to show what it's all about, though it might go over everyone's head, like they always do https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1NeGg1woXqmEelvJb_OFtVi8iYJgNF6D

it's a compact S1 zesshou laser!
she should actually use it in XV and it should either be a little poot or a massive zesshou level laser
she should use it exclusively in space, if they even go there anymore, and rename it to orbital weapon, call it OW
me this whole episode
cute bikki png straight out of photoshop (to remove the branch shadows), left a couple mistakes in because I'm lazy
I can't believe I missed this little reference from the kirika transformation
hmm, I wonder, where did my gun go
getting too late for me, have to continue working on this tomorrow
unless you have sla or sls printer
printing this would not be fun
and material/color
missing some small details like trigger and jewels
it's magic, it shouldn't be this hard
I'm putting way too much mechanical thought to chris's gun
her cable fists made me think of bionic commando
that turned out kinda ok
I even made the slide of the M93R version a long while ago
and if anyone wants, I think I can export an .obj or .stl out of this
it's nice that they included a profile shot
just simple cad with a reference
oh yeah, I actually have no idea what cartridges ichaival uses, but I based this one's cylinder diameter on a .357 cartridge
cylinder moves with the body now, and it spins; yay
at least it's somewhat coming along
oh yeah, if anyone wants to test if the revolver model I made actually works, all the pieces are here as .stl
agh, I want to do something
the revolver was a fun little project, and something like the red hot blaze would take me weeks
sadly I don't have jiggle physics, yet
yay for semi-capable pc
sure, I'll try to get it in a moment, because it's kinda misbehaving on me right now
built it myself in fusion360
I'll have to revise the model and reprint with better material for this year's
the little kick felt really fun, until the back half blew into my arm
ooh, I found my video of me shooting it
I printed a handheld firework mortar launcher on new years, and it lasted 3 shots
finland 🇫🇮
and I wouldn't exactly trust a printed gun
nah, I don't live in the US
I actually have *no idea* how the actual scale works out to be, but if satelight did their job right, that .357 magnum cylinder should produce a semi realistic scaled model
thanks
oh yeah, I added the couple joints just for funsies
it has very little mechanical capabilities, and no tolerances, so a print output might be a bit misaligned without sanding
<@!246678192360783872> I think this should work
I call it "make contact", because that's what it is in BB
https://i.imgur.com/VDqBASB.jpg also, carol/elf9 has been playing way too much bloodborne on their off time
I liked that they had the wild bunch to go with all the autoscorers showing up
oh wow, this is really an all star gathering of symphogear characters
this had me laughing
fully complete

swiss army knife
tsubasa and hibiki combo, a gauntlet sword

anything going up the urinary trackt is, just, no
"hurt for the first year", that should have been a pretty big indicator something was wrong
I call it "point 1h 2min, where all logic goes out the window"
säkkijärven polkka?
one of her teammates is Pepperoni
tbh, denmark is actually great
it's eastern sweden and partly west russia
may I recommend finland, which is a pretty great place filled with, what some people might consider, shitty people
Y'all is so good and easy to use
then again, our 12 noun cases are nothing to sneeze at
most gendered pronouns sound so weird to me since finnish doesn't have any of that
language arguments are always so fun to read because, in the end, english is a pretty shitty language
I've considered and came to a conclusion of "not yet"
also a bionicle pillowcase that's currently in use
I still have parts of the originals
I should call people "hän"
I often call people "se" which means "it"
laughs in non-gender finnish
I think people under like 35 are still pretty young, but I'll be 22 this year so what do I know
we're all so young here
oh, and "kalsari" - underwear, "känni" - drunk
kalsarikänni isn't any better, since you are getting shitfaced at home in your underwear
although daytime drunk does exist
english should adopt "kalsarikännit"
we sometimes like to adopt words from other languages too
probably
and "ju" can be used as a short form for yes
and "juo" is the imperative form for drinking
or actually "juoks" is the root word
even in that, "juoksen" is the word for "I run" and everything else is just suffixes piled on top of each other
some  more language magic going from finnish to english, "syötäisiinköhän" --> "I wonder what we are going to eat"
I do find that joke entertaining, but I feel like it's less effective since I know swedish
unless of course you want to go crazy with it, eg. atomiydinenergiareaktorigeneraattorilauhduttajaturbiiniratasvaihde
there are only so many reasonable letter combinations
we also learn a fun little rhyme about pronouns, "minä sinä hän, me te he; tämä tuo se, nämä nuo ne; kuka mikä kumpi ken; joka mikä jokainen", which represents 5/7 of our pronoun classes
we have it kinda nice, "minä/mä - I/me"; "sinä/sä - you"; "hän - he/she"; "me, te, he - we, you, they"
it's only there so that discord is not liable if need be
redbubble has some amazing t-shirt designs from rime to time
I was thinking you could admit you acted wrong and proceed to fully geek out over anime
I say let it die
Sure it is /s, I like picking female model in every game, because I hate roleplaying
On the female avatar topic, I like to quote jack pattillo of achievement hunter; "if I'm going to stare at an ass for 8 hours a day it might as well be a nice ass"
It's much easier and safer option
Especially in games
Always assume people are garbage and stay a faceless entity online
This is why I still wonder why some people insist disclosing information about them that is easily exploitable
ping REEEE, nothing else to say from mee
it's just that K-on never really grabbed me, so I don''t want to force myself to enjoy it

BST is GMT+1
I watch way too much anime, and maybe that's why I've grown to prefer generic shit
oooh, stella and shizuku are so great
the mc in VD is "straight" in that she idolizes the only pretty boy on the island, but has no problem getting fondled by her user
if you browse something like r/anime or animemes, it's sometimes almost unavoidable for the more popular shows
gold ship is great, but I like mejiro a bit more
I haven't been keeping up with toji for 2 weeks
here's a good taste of teekyuu btw http://www.crunchyroll.com/teekyu/episode-86-se7en-with-senpai-721651
each season is 24 minutes
get 9 more entries with all of Teekyuu
nice
I would have not recognized her unless I knew it beforehand
also Yuuki Aoi's more different roles
it's super easy to binge through
have you watched Kino no tabi
yeah, I see what you mean
are chill shows more or less your style?
girlish number's portrayal of the industry is so fun
Reason!! is maybe my favorite OP of all iM@S OPs, but Change!! and Idolmaster are so close
first iM@S was the best of them, CG was kinda meh, and I really liked side-M for some reason
I still think iM@S is the best idol show
and long riders had huge delays too
they even had to reboot Regalia midway through
while the shows are good most of the time, they have huge delays almost every time
studio Actas has some of the most awful production sometimes
it's funny how owari2 reveals so much of the mysteries from previous seasons
monogatari is written in non chronological order in first person of several characters
chronological is a nice gimmick but hard as hell to watch
sucks that CR doesn't have the bluray version of bake
release order of monogatari is best for new people^^^
then you have like 50 hours of **intense talking** to watch
that typo on princess principal makes me angry for some reason
and owari's episodes are like 2 hours long
https://youtu.be/HJvUeu5h5XE best ost of monogatari
that's nise, yes
for me it's probably ginga: nagareboshi gin; 1986
ooh, danshi koukosei is so good
I wonder if this will cause a streisand effect
is he building VCs?
Saya from Dagashi Kashi
I do these kinds of edits from time to time and my progress is: select area using polygon lasso, refine edge to smooth corners, invert, contract like 2-6px, feather 2-4px, invert, clear
if I was on my better computer I could fix it muc better, but I'm super lazy due to anime right now
way too strong feather to the rescue
also, laptop trackpad and laziness
maybe a bit too much contraction, but a specific area selection would have worked better
I just did the same
plus smooth
just needs a selection, contract like 3px, and a feather
what are those rough outlines and light bleed, good stuff either way
she's like, you seein this shit
and I think more are coming
I like the other girls too

I had trouble finding it because I type it sunoharasou instead of sunohara-sou
good news people, [HA/ss/] did a great work subbing sunoharasou, so we can enjoy not garbage subs
if anyone is debating wether or not to watch hataraku saibou, here's a reason https://youtu.be/IF9OaXTzoRs
if we're lucky
it might take a couple weeks to get any good subs
I really liked this 2nd episode
ye
yup still shit
lemme check
oh sunoharasou?
I really like this little sequence in hanebado's OP
not even half episode in on asobi asobase and I'm already loving it
what I've read about the manga on reddit, it is **very** ecchi
yeah, most likely the tv version will tone it down more, but it is an ecchi show so there will be blatant nudity
adding couple that I enjoyed last night; harukana receive, yuuna-san, isekai maou, ongaku shoujo, and chio's school road
I've heard some people say that
right now I'm watching shichisei no subaru, and it seems dumb enough for me watch
and there are about 7 more shows that I'm trying to watch
I'll just list the shows that I've watched so far
island, hanebado, yama no susume 3, one room 2, cingeki 3, sunoharasou, hyakuren, hataraku saibou
not yet, but it's on my list of shit to watch
ah well, back to watching new anime
maybe now it looks  a bit better
damn, lemme fix that one annoying spot

actually now that I'm interested....
had to do this to my phone wallpaper since it had an annoying blue tint
https://i.imgur.com/xkowWkR.jpg

someone might find it faster, but lemme try google-fu
goofy genki girls are fun
so that one chart is accurate; "you liked her after AXZ"
any clue on the show or other characters
looks like I'll be bingeing that in 2027
hah, garupan movie 2/6 coming in june next year
too bad hockey isn't exactly a  popular sport in japan
hockey is like perfectly suited for all the anime tropes you can find
too bad season 2 never
NGNL is really fun
I haven't skated in like 9 years, but I think I could if I had the chance
with what
and everyone loves hockey
every kid here has to learn to skate
pssst... we in finland are still high about winning WHC back in 2011
Beatless
and the best part is that the final episode comes out in september
even gamers' pentagon of fuckery was not as bad as this
it's a mess that needs like a whole chart and several tables of character relations

people started to joke that there was story in their recaps
recycled footage and exposition out the ass
of the 24 episodes 4 or 5 are recaps
the way beatless does it is just awful too
well that was planned and perfectly fit the show
regalia had a reboot in the middle of the season
long riders was kinda ok, but it had some delays
actas almost always has a terrible production for some reason
anzio ova is like episode 5.5 IIRC
even though it was a bit too r/im14andthisisdeep
50/50 was a really fun character
the show or the LN

I'll probably end up watching a billion shows again
I haven't even looked at what's coming in next season
I've so many shows to finish
Spring 2019, that's as far as I know
but bad anime is fun
ps4 probably doesnät support mkv
wakarimasu
what is going on; index 3 is airing, certain scientific accelerator was announced, AND a railgun season 3!?
even if I watch a ton of anime
you'd be surprised about the shows that I haven't seen
sakura quest
everyone should watch ARIA

handbrake can do that for you
https://twitter.com/pkjd818/status/1050771049560698880 hey shinovi master has a pretty fun OP

look familiar?
I will take this with a huge grain of salt at this point because that art is the same as S2's  announcement
r/anime should be blowing up too in a moment if this is all true
and probably has to do with isekai quartet
apparently the S3 announcement was after the movie
y'all better sing along säkkijärven polkka when you watch der film
aikatsu too is very CGDCT "idol" anime
zombieland saga is pretty good
you should go down the idol hell some more
because der film deserves it
if I wasn't somewhere with crap internet I could've done it
I mean, I've watched a ton of their stuff, taboo tattoo being one of them, but I'm just going by the feel I get from that teaser visual
I hope they won't go overly serious with it and keep it in the classic goofy konosuba progression
you'll have to remember that it's animated by J.C.staff instead of Deen
yeah people are speculating it will adapt the 5th volume
I don't mind the style change
konosuba movie teaser visual!
nyaa is probably the place to go with those search words
which GGO kinda is
I find it a little weird that SAOA kept the SAO title, instead of making GGO its own brand loosely connected to the SAO world
GJ-bu is always my go to
acchi kocchi is so damn cute too
yeah, death parade is great
never really find the time to watch the rest
I have been stuck in the final 3-4 episodes of katanagatari for like 3 years now
Hey, Last period was also an ad and that show was amazing and funny as hell too
yeah, umamusume's game release has been delayed multiple times on the EN region
when I get around to it, I'll watch girly airforce because it looks like some interesting trash
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
release date is 13th, so today for me
then nyaa it is for me at least

kotobuki
mini toji
pastel memories
wataten
I'm currently watching 8 shows, but there's like 4 more I'm probably going to binge too
wakarimasu
I wonder what precent of people voted/watched revue starlight in the best ed
also this
and that's mostly because devilman is not a show I've seen or will see
I would've gone for violet or sora yori out of that bunch
but at least violet got the best animation
is it: A: a popular shonen, B: a popular netflix show, or C: another popular show
I checked those too, nad yes they are
soooo, 20 minutes per season
9 seasons
yeah
not too long you say, teekyuu it is
12 minute episodes
oh oh, watch space battleship tiramisu
oh yeah, dumb blowing shit up, medaka box
kore wa zombie desu ka
how about gatchaman crowds
sasami-san@ganbaranai comes to mind, but only at some moments
ooh, action, watch taboo tattoo
https://myanimelist.net/anime/36038/Net-juu_no_Susume
I thought that hi score girl did the season 2 sales promise, but that was actually jashin-chan and they're also doing a season 2
that show is so good
https://twitter.com/pKjd/status/1109324708195921920 yeee, cells at work s2 too
it really came out of nowhere, and in a good way
probably just the visuals
for some reason that OP felt very SHAFTy
it's a pain but someone has to do it
TL note: "5 kuukautta sitten" means "5 months ago"
I feel like semi-slice of life is not their style
cool that the rifle is beautiful anime will be animated by 3Hz
they will camp on mt. fuji before the yama no susume crew gets there
https://i.imgur.com/HkrEAQl.jpg oh yes, I didn't even know that a season 2 was coming
so it's like a bell curve that's skewed to one side
all the elder elves are lolis
obviously their growth is a curve that gets smaller as time goes on
do note: producers in japan give <0 fucks about the things going on in other parts of the world
almost every show gets delayed or just stuck at some point
I really like actas but their production management is horrible
love that song
on kauniina muistona karjalan maa,/ mutta vielläkin syömmestä soinnahtaa,/ kun soittajan sormista kuulla saa,/ säkkijärven polkkaa!
https://youtu.be/cXabZ_-QPb0
plus the OP is a banger
I recommend
probably just missed
I found it to be pretty enjoyable dark fantasy
did you watch drifters when it came out?
even a raspberry can do it most likely
probably just a cpu
well my laptop that is about 7 years old does it in like 20s per episode, so N/A
there are always tools for that, like with handbrake, there's a handy dandy tool called "batch scan" which allows you to just encode the whole folder
everything in handbrake is *very* self explanatory
https://i.imgur.com/ZGitYoN.mp4 when I clip stuff like this I just pick the couple seconds from the mkv into mp4 and then do the rest in premiere
you just need to choose the sub track (sometimes even the audio track too) and click to burn it in, which should be on by default
you will not need the chapter/seconds/frames unless you're picking a specific moment, or the picture, or the container
<@173112001684439040> handbrake is hella easy. you start it, choose your file(s), enter the destination file, start encode
yeh, they have to be queued and then just let encode the whole queue
I definitely recommend sakura quest too, if you enjoyed something like shirobako
slow and relaxing
"healing" anime
love the manga
and the journey is well worth it too
animation > natural > origination > avvenire
aria or sakura quest are so slow and boring from the outside, but they're so good IMO
SoL where nothing happens is my jam
I really enjoy stuff like this
https://streamable.com/wwufu
cute girls doing cute things
eh, can't say CGDCT is a niche, but kinda has its own audience
because I don't remember stuff myself
from reddit `Manga Time Kirara, a magazine that prints manga in Japan. Known for anime/manga such as K-On, Is this Order a Rabbit, Kiniro Mosaic and Comic Girls`
manga published in one of the kirara magazines
so much like any other kirara show
you should watch it, super cute, super funny, animation is excellent for some reason, etc
I love it so much
mine at this point is machikado mazoku
I tried granbelm, but the mech design kinda rubbed me the wrong way, but I'm enjoying way too many shows again anyway
goddamn, if only someone translated and published the aria masterpiece collection somewhere other than japan..

oh man, I clipped these 2 years ago, when I took part in the aria rewatch
I watched the first episode, and it didn't really grab me but I'll keep watching
since senku is the central main character most of the time, I hope he figures everything out with science, as he has so far
it's weirdly intriguing
unlike when last period was airing, nobody watched it
lots of pretty popular shows this time around
this is my list so far, and I'll probably add a couple more once I get around to watching them
grimgar kinda?
I actually liked the visual elements in handshakers, but the huge over the top camera movement and weird 2d 3d blending made it unbearable
also handshakers needs a massive rework because it causes spontaneous ocular meltdowns
so nobody is naturally watching it
it's streamed literally nowhere, aka. hidive
weird that machikado mazoku is even 5th on that list
he has the best class name
also the localisation, but that isn't that annoying
there's lots of text based jokes, and then the subs go all over the place sometimes
only downside, aside from the stream locations, is that the subbing currently is pretty garbage
it's surprisingly good
machikado mazoku!
in the next 10 years
some day
season 2!
yamamoto just keeps being the best
that episode was the best so far
best part about that ep was that it was all a text converastion
Twintails is so good and wacky
she's so powerful she can destroy glasses by only speaking
obviously yamamoto is the best girl
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/cakfnl/clip_an_interesting_woman_joshikousei_no_mudazukai/
can I say something amazing
yeees! it's geat
dumb name for dumb people
I really like the cheesy "that's what a hero does" thing in fire force
I've only seen like part of one scene, and I felt like it might be some great trash
maou-sama retry is pretty fun because it's *terrible*
Having to go to work sadly takes a lot of free time out<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I'm at ep.28 of season 1, since it's on CR and I'm watching when I have nothing else to do
kinda like watching hayate no gotoku without any experience in anime
I know and I love referential comedy, but at that time I couldn't appreciate it since I hadn't watched a lot of anime
saw a couple episodes years ago
I should finish that show some day
but hey, nise has quarrel, ominous, and shide no tori
I really liked nise because it features my favorite characters and soundtrack
I still need to watch zoku and kizu 2 & 3
at least "MC is the only boy who can sexually please these girl only machines" turned out to be hilarious
oh yeah, it's great, I'll have to watch the rest of it at some point
whoa
IIRC the anime had 3 or 4 volumes
many cute girls
oh, the defence build isekai IIRC has feMC
technically GGO would be too
it almost happens in another world
kinda
net-juu no susume
people are making lots of popular isekai manga and novels, so of course they get several adaptations
eh, trends come and go
to a galaxy far, far away
astra would be a very loose isekai for *one character*
I'm excited for rifle is beautiful, because it looks like a fun show and it's 3hz
yay for more isekai trash!
isn't there also highschool prodigies in this season?
I'd say cgdct is more like a descriptor than a genre
does it have cute girls, and do they do cute (or cool) things?
oof, actas
watch as it gets delayed to 2022 at earliest
ganbare shamiko!
machikado mazoku!
though SAO:A is a thing, so just GGO is more than enough
https://myanimelist.net/anime/36475/Sword_Art_Online_Alternative__Gun_Gale_Online
I still have to wonder why people call ggo ggoa
and by that I mean that they can do the wildest and dumbest things without any explanations to how or why
I really like terrible anime because they have a lot to offer
ayamine, I guess you weren't here last year when I binged like 3 seasons of trash in 2 days
there's still arifureta...
okay, 6 episodes down for isekai cheat, and it's not actually bad
sure it's mostly pretty low quality and most scenes lack any background sound or music, but at least the scenes are progressing towards something and things happen mostly in order
unlike maou-sama retry
comparing those two might be a bit difficult since the other is almost a parody of itself and the other tries to be a good anime, but failing at everything it tries
I kinda like that familiarity sometimes
isekai is getting so formulaic that you always know what you're in for
I'm guessing average skills anime, since it *just* started
but yay, it has one of my favorite OP tropes
https://twitter.com/Kirari_star/status/1183382988232347649 I'm excited for this show even if the OP is a bit meh imo
I sadly haven't had time to read them
I've read the kizu LN when I was in the military, and have since bought bake and nise LNs
or in some those few weird places where they do the weekly releases
they're basically promoting piracy *unless* you're *in* japan
they try and block all the new ones that pop up constantly
legal? yea
against netflix's ToS? most likely
unless you book a flight to japan, ayy
bookworm is really fun and cute too
also, ISP protection, hah; what if I was going to a place but then I was actually going to another place
unless the official title is english
**never** look up anime using the english title
also, shinchou yuusha
a place that goes nyaa
yarr, there be a comfu place on the high seas
ayy, it's like amazon/audible
HDN is actually pretty good, but the downside is that the performance and gameplay are hot garbage
and 1 isn't even in the same world
4 mains, but whatevs
they really like recycling things because all the neps games are pretty much recycled assets
oh but the best part is that they just keep releasing and rerelasing trash dlc for all their old games
I'm expecting it to be a trash fire where I can warm my cold heart for 12 weeks
twintails antagonists, HxH power mechanics, kinda
HxH v2 here we go!
just because the synopsis sounds so good
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1187598419964989440 yay for a show to be waiting for

https://youtu.be/Jvboxbdl-nM here's her going all neptune playing crosswave
ye
speaking of nep related stuff, I like that tanaka rie hosts a gaming channel and tsunako visits it a bunch
it's a simple formula that keeps me in, I love all the characters and their tropes
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea_Factory they do so much stuff, quantity over quality
I think it was blazing souls
the fight mechanic was ported over in its entirety
the OG was very much a reskin of another one of their old games
2011 ps3
the OG neps
no, HDN
who knows, netflix is dumb when it comes to anime and I guess films too
https://i.imgur.com/lGA4zFp.gif
the other eye looks a bit too much down
kimi no na wa and koe no katachi had a short and unadvertised runs, and that's about it
there is no way an anime movie, like konosuba, would get a theatre showing here
maybe I'll eventually get to see this one when it comes to the seven seas
when I read the LNs I really liked the crimson demon town arc
but I have bake and nise so far
I've only read kizu
I mean, I've already seen it all, I just want them on my NAS
speaking of monogatari, I'm currently downloading it all just for funsies
yes, watch nyaruko
https://youtu.be/xQBjOC7XdJM gochiusa's s2 ed is so good
https://youtu.be/MfYZMzaxDP8
kattasa gahahaa
that's why she's so fun, in it for the money and fame, so she goes along with all the dumb ideas the producers come up with
actually everyone in that show is a garbage human
I loved girlish number because chitose is a garbage human
and I forgot to mention the shorts too:
null & peta
all the gfl shorts
Of course forgot dr stone too
kemono michi
shinchous yuusha
prodigy isekai
book isekai
(planning to watch) oresuki
saikoro club
azur lane
(planning) val x love
bokuben s2
average abilities
kandagawa jet girls
(planning) assasins pride
(planning) no guns life
rifle is beautiful
(planning) high score girl 2
and should be continuing fire force
way too much stuff, as usual <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
watch hataage kemono michi too, just ended and *very* similar to konosuba
natsume akatsuki, the creator of konosuba, really likes to make absurd humor with crazy characters, of which almost none of them are normal
plus they are half episodes, so they go by much faster
not really, izakaya kinda has a story that happens in the other world, so the food bits don't feel as repetitive
it's very much isekai shokudou
isekai izakaya?
I really like reference heavy comedy
well anime is primarily visual medium, so it can be used a lot more there
what I read on the reddit discussions was that it diverged a lot from the source, with things happening in the wrong order or different results
someone heard it said and just ran with it
I'd blame the english pronunciation
it's a really dumb TL
that list apparently has 7 shows I have not watched
heyy, yatogame-chan, really fun little short show
Maou-sama was really good in that it just gave up on having any coherent story. Things just happened and it eventually lead to somewhere, and the journey there was very enjoyable
Anyway, in the end, last year had a lot of just ok shows. Few were bad per se, but majority has something to enjoy in them
On the technical side that show was top tier trash, way worse than isekai cheat which had a lot of other problems
And I didn't even see him mention maou-sama retry, which was almost so bad it was good (I was skipping a lot so I might have missed it)
~~like the dozens of paragraphs of character analysis on an ongoing show, coughrevuecough~~
Yes, there's a place for everything and it's not wrong, I just don't like it
I like some of his vids, but I really don't like when people go deep into analyzing anime
Still need to finish it though, so at least I got something to do today <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
The "better", I guess, side has much more advanced mechs but get rek'd by anything
And the power balance in it is awful, it sucks major ass
Like early in the year, egao no daika, price of smiles, tries to tell a war story featuring both sides but really failing to have any main characters since it tries to feature everyone
Now, I'm really bad at analyzing things I watch, but I could maybe, probably, make a small list like that out of the things I watched last year, which wasn't a lot
Like ep 4 I think was all rozen maiden
That show had a lot of problems, but I actually really enjoyed it, since it was filled with references and themed episodes
Skipping around; oh wow, he mentioned pastel memories
I had nothing else to do, so the numbers went up real fast
yeah, some days I managed to chew out 2 or more shows on a single sitting
went into FDF in july/august 2015, after the 3 month basic training I got assigned to a position where I had a pc and *a lot* of free time, and then spent another 6 months in that
oh yeah, funny thing about my thing is that I started watching anime in late 2015
I watch too much stuff
TV: 546
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I just looked at my list's stats too
just search honzuki anywhere and you'll find it
towards the end it got so weird
that show was... <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
oh, subaru
I haven't watched any of it yet, but I believe doga kobo is always trustworthy when it comes to comfy shows
rikekoi is really good, I've liked it so far
it's a fun show, that's my whole opinion on it
that show seems so good, but I've never actually gotten around to watching it
I really kinda disliked all the characters in asterisk, except gun girl, and liked everyone in rakudai
blade dance has the best ED hands down
I don't care about volume progression, but more about how I enjoyed it, and it was definitely not boring
I really think the only good things in asterisk war was the OPs and EDs, and rakudai was just better overall same show
amiami is really good, highly recommend
https://youtu.be/zkcCBNVeVbs the entire show
zero is a really fun character IMO
I wouldn't know that since I don't read stuff
like grimoire of zero, I liked the show, and apparently it was only 1 volume stretched real far
sometimes it's better to live in ignorance to what is and isn't adapted
it's how I found out about this most recently
like, most GFL figures I get to know from the expo showcases, and when they come to preorders, people usually make a post on the sub about it
not really, usually I pick up the announcement from reddit
I think I put it up when it was announced
yeah, I had my next black on preorder for like over 9 months
the others look kinda plain
I think she is the better of the three
they cost like $33 each and are releasing in april
but man, how I wish the EU-japan trade agreement would have affected anime stuff too, but it would have made no sense
completely forgot the word for plushie
nesoberi is the laying on their stomach types of stuffed thingies
put a preorder for the 3 symphogear nesoberis!
and they have preorder bonuses for most of their stuff
I think pretty much everywhere
at least for preorders it's good
I guess japanese fans love the slow relaxing shows much more than us westerners
3Hz is a great studio, but I think they took on too much with it since it's a 4-koma cgdct manga
whoa, RSC on second, would have not expected that
I liked it when it was still "I can be a hero", but then deku kinda becomes a hero and the whole thing gets pushed aside
can be kinda cool and all at times, but it just didn't grab me as much
I watched 2 seasons of mha and didn't really care to continue
do you like shonen-battles is the bigger question
yeah, marshmallow justice is really high on my favorite list too
I love it though
and it isn't even in my favorites
but, speaking of great monogatari OPs, mousou express is so damn good!
and that 1 episode was like 2 hours long
tbh, the same happens with decent black too, since I think it was only for 1 episode
I think it was just shown very sparsely
oh, staple stable?
orange mint could also be memed a bit but not as much as those
platinum disco probably
monogatari in its entirety sure is an experience
I can't believe how long our cinemas take to get these movies when they're already huge hits around the world
13.3
speaking of tenki no ko, it's finally getting a release over here too
overflow should do that too, but it's a short so they tease some action and cut to them naked on a bed
bananice
sequel movie coming at some point
kinda like a recap, but from a different perspective
||https://youtu.be/lerxXinJE7s|| rondo rondo rondo is a compilation film of revue from the POV of banana
yees, good time to watch revue since rondo rondo rondo is coming out at some point in the near future
HDN 2011 is a masterpiece
where are all the recs for slow start, anima yell, hinako note, etc. <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
I ain't your guy, pal!
runway de waratte is so good
it's like *MAX* quality everything
btw, firstly, <#407060923078017026> was created for this exact purpose, and secondly, do yourself a favor and get this <https://nyaa.si/view/1160744>
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
someone's gotta catch the references
mayoi is just the best bro
and kaiki "best girl" deishuu with his incredible soundtrack
Nise is one of the best seasons because karen
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
right hand was unaware of what left hand was doing
<https://myanimelist.net/anime/34800/Action_Heroine_Cheer_Fruits> I recommend this too, but most people will find it way too boring or just uninteresting
speaking of sentai, action heroine cheer fruits is underrated
nyaruko-san is a bit similar, though she's mostly a huge sentai fan in the show
pretty often the only differing thing is what they're themed around, yuru camp - camping, long riders - cycling, yama no susume - hiking, hinako note - acting club, etc.
I mean, what did you really expect
do it between episodes!
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
no pausing!
it's so rough to start out, but when you get comfortable it just flies by
endless eight is the name of those episodes
but yeah, just like haruhi, watching a nonlinear story in the linear way, makes the watch order just stupid
chronological is whole other thing, which is not even necessary
I don't really see how monogatari is hard to follow, you go on MAL bake and click sequel as many times you need
at least monogatari only has one timeline <:ShirabeWink:672661604319363103>
I'd guess the acting directors and PR, and marketing etc., don't really have much overlap
review bombing is always fun
and *bad*
I loved the censoring in it, since it was so outrageous sometimes
https://myanimelist.net/anime/33834/Sin__Nanatsu_no_Taizai licenced by funi, censored out the ass
NO, *the good one*
just in general; I believe y'all didn't watch nanatsu no taizai: the good one
of course it always depends on if there is an uncensored in the first place
I still think they shouldn't get ecchi shows if they don't plan on releasing an uncensored version
"yo, we got this wildly popular show coming up in the next season, we should put it on our platform"
"do you know what it's about?"
"don't know and don't care, it's popular"
-some exec somewhere
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ezy8ik/amazon_has_axed_interspecies_reviewers_from_its/ yeees, every western media distributor is pulling this show
is the smoke white? has a new pope been chosen?
IIRC from the reddit post, tokyo mx is basically public tv, so it's understandable
they produce pretty quality stuff, but their timeframes are all out of whack
and the das finales air like barely 2 per year, and there's 6 in total
long riders had several weeks or months for the final episodes
they have terrible management
yeah, that's what actas does
in reality it was actually 4 recaps, and then a 3 month gap, for the whole show
and it has 24 episodes
oh man, beatless had a recap episode after like every 3 or 4
I've heard dimension w is pretty good, but I've yet to watch it
I guess magia record, the new madoka thing
now we need YT to go *way* too far with this, a la chyuu-pas with revue
<https://nyaa.si/view/1166125> this deep nerd shit fascinates me a lot
BDs also have better sounds sometimes, but you'd have to nerd real hard to notice it
IIRC usually the BDs have just less derpy animations sometimes and better resolution
YT only has ep 1 of BDs
the cat on the seven seas has pretty much everything ever
YT, aka. yametetomete
they've really adopted the BBC season release schedule, S1 2 episodes with like 8 months in between them, S2 3 years later with 1 episode
yeah, I'll just wait until they're all out too
only 4 more to go
I'd have a bunch of just random stuff, nothing significant
what a strange choice to use an estonian word for a unit
just picking those from my list
and lastly yama no susume
tari tari
seitokai yakuindomo, totally normal
minami-ke
ichigo mashimaro
sakura quest has the hair color thing, but I just want to mention it
or locodol
how about genshiken
also flying witch, the most casual magic ever, which kinda disqualifies it
just older dudes writing a dictionary
is fune wo amu normal enough
it is, also reads nisekoi on the top left corner
watch oshibudo and get invested in every pairing in the show <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
oh yeah, and project n.9 is on their way to perfection, since they're making HxEros
they also did the mini toji shorts, which were okay at best
this time it's by project n.9, who have recently had ups and downs; prodigy isekai, average powers isekai, pastel memories..
it really hangs on whether you can overlook dumb stuff that's happening and enjoy the things happening on the screen
it really runs on on the rule of cool, so in the end the story shouldn't matter much, and it's a dumb story too
but yeah, kanami is really simple minded and dumb as a character
if you disliked the entire run, then why did you watch it, it's 24 episodes
https://youtu.be/xpTVYz7zMo0 this is actually my favorite fight in the whole show, episode 1
it's really good, but most people will find it a bit jarring at the beginning since they blend 2d and 3d characters for the fight scenes
https://youtu.be/OmH2X3pD5i8 the pv is pretty cool too, at least the short visual portion of it
don't know, I'd guess they could introduce or have them in a bigger part in the ovas
I loved the show, so I'm somewhat hyped for it
yay, more TnM coming at some point with a 2 part ova
qualidea code is one of those "oh hey, this looks cool" shows that I will never get around watching
watched 100 eps, and still 70 eps left
oof, that's me with aikatsu
I was quite confused as to why
funny thing is that the tokyo mew mew manga has been somewhat recently started to be translated into finnish
didn't even read the original pic closely enough <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
still a huge waste of space and just bad for any infrastructure planning
kinda like in aikatsu
it looks pretty, and that's all that matters <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
oh cool, *the town* got an upgrade
just release everything on web streaming services at once
yeah, it's weird, but I can understand since the season was kinda kickstarted, so maybe they didn't get or need weekly releases
I should too, but never got around to it
https://nyaa.si/view/1226213 there, whole batch, songs and all transcribed
yeah, das finale 2 has been out for some time, and now we wait for 4 more in the next 2-3 years
*are you sure about that*

the title is of course saishuushou, but it's of course more well known as das finale
it's doga kobo, what's there to not like
And I think they always challenge the top of that culture
It's somewhat similar to akiba's trip where they focus/highlight different otaku cultures almost every episode
Same with dragon dentist I think
To be hero and jikkehin kazoku too, they're both originally chinese
how about a McD's burger commercial
ONAs and random pieces of animation are a wild wasteland
you can add the mekakucity series of music videos too
if you haven't watched machikado mazoku, it's on hidive, you should watch it
was bored every evening while in FDF, and it provided some fun for a while when it was airing
the one that got me properly into anime was monster musume
lots of people like it, QED
suddenly market analysis and business manouvers
trysail makes fun music
cobalt is great indeed
I watched classroom crisis as it aired
9 seasons!
mal scores actually mean nothing when it comes to personal opinion
I can start watching almost any weird anime and at least someone will have seen it, like witch of the west or polyphonica crimson s
the thing about this place is that we're all deep weebs here, and assclass is VERY casual friendly show, which is the reason it's VERY popular
got write your thesis in r/anime, and see how much support you get
you hang out in wrong places
anne happy is so good!
versus CC, which is very basic
plastic memories is good
yeah, I cried too
showing weird shows to newbies rarely goes well, just try to catch all the references in sket dance ot gintama
yuushibu just reminded me of that
y'all need to watch last period
I need to watch one that was really difficult to get: day break illusion
it was at least kinda different
katta-sou GAHAHAHAH
the puchimas imas spinoffs are similar to teekyuu and really fun if you like imas
each season lasts about 22 minutes
teekyuu has like 130 episodes
excellent anime imo, but middling score
you should watch more trash, because all that is heightened and made hilarious by the *amazing* execution
yosh, seto no hanyome!
just need to get around to it
I got day break illusion on my NAS ready to go
the first episode is so great at setting the story
mars of detruction
make a movable 1/1 gundam
if they weren't, they absolutely should do that
too bad even a basic 1/1 mecha model would usually be much larger than anything reasonable
yeah, I mistyped that
more than 20 would probably go to shipping at this point
I got an anastasia swimsuit one at that scale
yeah, the smaller ones are usually at that price range
is it 8/1 scale, because the price would fit
europe, especially nordics, get shafted so hard in stream availability
✨ Masa-san~~ ✨
totally accurate chinese history™️
hey, koihime musou was fun
from the final episode discussion page on reddit
> This episode goes up to part way through chapter 27
what I actually *should* do is get a bunch of high capacity HDDs and set them up in a RAID array, then just move all the old data into the array
I have to eventually get a new PCIe SATA card for my "server" so I can expand my anime NAS capacity
it's easier to forget them when it's automated and happening out of sight on a local server machine
I keep my seeds up for couple weeks maybe, or until I reorganize my watching folders for plex
it's good to pay for a service for the convenience, but nothing can trump the quality and quantity of torrents
torrenting honestly gets you usually the better version too
https://youtu.be/KhX6M4WNOsc
https://youtu.be/Jl_2dspRHto I'm starting to love this song
https://youtu.be/i0e6I-3Me5E Hardware store is great by itself but this is so much fun too
great rendition
https://youtu.be/fE0RbPsC9uE found something I gotta relisten every once in a wahile
https://youtu.be/2s_QgMCW9ks have the best christmas song too, only 2 weeks early but it's a good one
https://youtu.be/fE0RbPsC9uE have finlandia again too, because it's great
https://youtu.be/psH6TQL1u7A our cavalry march is a good one too
https://youtu.be/Bw4xuoP8eZ4 so yeah, porilaisten marssi, the honorary march of the finnish military, and the president
here's a link https://www.twitch.tv/castform5
starting from 0 right now
Anyone want to watch me grind platinum in dark souls 3?
Payback got a lot of shit
I think so
One of the best things was all the yuri undertones with Vert x everyone, Noire x Uni, Nepgear x Uni, etc
Everyone had their initial unupgraded armor until the "last" boss
She worked well for me but I kept everyone on prioritize defense, because I'm lazy in upgrading armor
Even if they are not always the most effective with it
That's why I like having Vert in the party, buffs and heals are the best thing support AI can have
It's twincest more like
Even in Megadimension Noire's near canopy could waste enemies with a couple of hits
Somehow Uni and Noire have been consistently amazing
Oh and her first skill, elemental shot, does a ton of guard damage and can be spammed from ways away on bosses
Probably, I had her at like 29 when everyone else was <14 after the first time in the temple
Also, she can grind levels with the metal dogoos in the temple which makes the rest of the game super easy
Long range, fast attack speed, easy to combo
Uni is really op in this
I tried using Black heart for a while, but fell back to Uni because I like the tasty cheese
leader is Uni, for the cheese, Gear, Noire, and Vert
I kinda like that they put the "ending" credits before the actual end of the game
now that the ingame game story is the last thing to do, it should go by pretty fast
yeah it felt like that
it's a lot longer than I expected
apparently it took me about 9 hours to play the first half(?) of Cyberdimension
https://www.twitch.tv/castform5
I'll have to see how the updated turn battles go in VII:R
Ye
Still Tamsoft, so somewhat similar to mainline Senran Kagura games
It's a much updated system from U and MegaTag
I'm not sure if I should try streaming Cyberdimension when I get to it
now I can start grinding through Cyberdimension
woo, it only took 38 hours (again) but now I finally have platinum in DS3 properly
I think xbone too
yeah, switch, ps4 and pc
Woo! Dark Souls remaster!
That setup is missing a subwoofer from under the table

I've a picture of my current setup if y'all want to see
So much space for activities
Huge towers are just so cool
If nvidia were to announce a new line, they woul drop somewhat like always
I've no idea if I should upgrade from my 980ti at any point
A semi-powerful mini-ATX pc could work for the travel issue
Can't you ship stuff into japan or is the import laws real strict
Even other arcade games are suffering, since Housemarque is moving away from twinsticks
Next car game looks pretty good but it's so far off
Too bad Bugbear is not doing anything these days
It's sad that the arcade-y style is dying off
Apparently Assetto corsa is pretty good driving sim too
Though I haven't gotten around to play Trackmania turbo yet either
Since none of the GRID games are on psn, GT, WRC, or DiRT 4 would be my top picks
DiRT 1& 2 were really good
Oh yeah, ps4 has the DiRT games
My fallback racing games are usually Burnout paradise and Grid autosport
It's similar to Wipeout
I think Redout is on PSN
this was too good to not screencap
and as always I just love the blatant 4th wall removal in the "thank you section"
LMAO, I beat the last story boss in Cyberdimension without taking a step
This way I can listen to/watch podcasts while I play
I have the TV on normally and laptop audio from headphones when I play on ps4
That is what my laptop usually is for
Right now PS4 is the main game device
Tbh, I mostly use my desktop for rendering and other stuff
I think I got some games with my gpu or cpu, but never even redeemed them
button mashing is annoying
in a game like Tekken, it's easier to play against an opponent who knows what tey're doing
even Tekken 7 cpu is difficult enough
I would never play a fighter online
I would only get PS+ for the discounts
btw I have the same username everywhere
it's just close friends and their alt accounts which are not in use
I feel like I need to grow my friend list on psn, but never add anyone
I never like to wear large cans outdoors, so the monitors are real good for me
Whenever I use headphones it"s either my Sennheiser hd400 series or Marshall monitor
I plan on getting 7.1 speakers
When I'm out studying, aka not home, I just have an IKEA table, laptop, and PS4
but there's always the world introduction in each game
ye, that is almost required
mostly by references
very loosely
I'd honestly recommend playing Megadimension first, as it's the best one IMO
uuuuhhhhh
which requires 100 jumps as a leader
Keep the peeping down plan was unlocked by getting the challenge for "I love gravity" Lv.2
I found the wiki page!
I did farm all of them and it did not take that long, I think
IIRC it was 100 or 300 times per character
Uni has a nice one too, Charlie horse, where she kicks the camera
tsunderes that can't tsundere very well
Noire and Uni are my favorites
I like almost everyone, except Nep
yeah, the story has never been anything great, and the characters make or break it
well then, I'm not going to press it further
any specific reason?
it kinda sucks that only Megadimension and Cyberdimension are available for PS4
but the originals were named Neptunia, Mk.2, Victory
on steam they're Rebirth;1 2 & 3
remake of the third game
Rb;3 = Rebirth;3
what, you don't want to listen 30 minutes for a single dialog
I rewatched the anime when I finished Mk.2 (last game for me)
the anime is good by itself but it's much better if you have played the first 3 games
one is a faceless self-insert, 3 are robots, and one is a fish
in a span of 8 games there has been 5 male characters
really any Nep game, they're full of yuri ships more or less
4 Goddesses online: Cyberdimension Neptunia
on a slightly related note, Mousou katharsis is one of my favorite songs from a game ever
in a sale they're usually down to like 9€ for the first three games
all of them are on steam
oh sorry, PS4 only has Megadimension and Cyberdimension
Vanquish is one example
either by grind or just dumb achievements
nope, some games are extremely difficult
next I'll be moving to re-grind Megadimension with a side of valkyria chronicles
just complete the story and grind for a bit
So, Cyberdimension has the easiest platinum ever
attack buff at low health
oh yeah, RTsR = Red tearstone ring from Dark souls
still on the Nep topic; I like that Cyberdimension has an RTsR gem which is probably the most useless upgrade in the game, even though it's amazing
just cause 3 too, but that takes a ton of time
when I look at it, bloodborne has pretty easy platinum
megadimension has the best CGs
1070 ti is still 600€, and US shops show prices over $1000
the prices here in finnish stores have not changed at all
weird thing about that
huh, Shadow was surprisingly easy to platinum
shadow of the colossus
yay, SoftC is still as great as it was 15 years ago
SoftC comes tomorrow, I'm so excited!
I wanted to try insect glaive and it has been fun
but a combination of buttons has a mechanic which has even more mechanics on top of it
if only I knew what I was doing most of the time
MH has been very enjoyable so far
Too much to think, but nice to know TIL
I actually like 12 hour time because I always get confused after 16.00
8 Ante Meridiem
Trying to pretend I don't have an exam tomorrow
3.30pm and I should be doing something productive
Same
I did play the remaster along with X2
I was probably 6 years old when I played it, so I didn't get far into it
Hey FFX was my first JRPG too
NFS most wanted was really fun too
if only they were to add a proper custom music system
this is fucking amazing!
I'm not sure of the specifics but I know the mechanic¨
somehow I often think of this song when I get to, or move away from, my better PC https://youtu.be/Vx5BNDPA5hE
https://youtu.be/u9Zy2-7mvQE
huh, apparently GuP has a game for PS4, but no EU or NA release, I think
Rollcage was so fun back in the day
I considered buying Grip a few months back, but I'll wait if it ever comes out of early access
it'll go on sale on psn probably in some summer sale, or 2019 at earliest
also it happens to fit my living situation
and I still have MH on ps4 to play
I'll get it on pc because 20e is much better than 70e right now
I know it's kinda fucked on pc, but I'm not a huge stickler for fps drops
ooh, autotomato is -50% on steam, I might finally buy it
because IFI, Xseed, and Marvelous like to collab on stuff
hah, there's apparently a Neptune character dlc coming with the pc version of peach beach splash
my upload speed would go down somewhat though
max 30Mb/s gets me around 10Mb/s regularly, so downgrading to like 15Mb/s should still be plenty enough
and in all reality I should downgrade because they can't provide that speed
well it does cost me 25€/month
I had that for 20 years too, until I moved away
I just think it's somewhat false advertising, since not everyone is aware that they have to divide the number by 8 to get something useful
250MB/s sounds nice and all, but in useful units it's 31Mb/s
in Finland; Elisa/Saunalahti
they do a fine job but I fucking hate that they advertise and sell data as MB/s, instead of Mb/s
I want to bitch about our ISPs
Most of the time I'm at my student apartment, where I get closer to 30mb/s
Yeah, my home uses old cables, so the max speed we get is around 700kb/s
And on the topic of MH; I just managed to grind the whole Kiri set and kill Rathalos
I mean, I had to keep my PC on for almost 48 hours to download DOOM
I actually decided to wait to buy nier on ps4, because my internet at home is absolute crap, and I just don't want to bother with downloading it
yay, nep VIIR got a release date
like only using spears was named Yarizakura from YZQ
most of the time in DS I name my characters so that my weapon objective fits the name
anyone else, when given the chance of naming their character in a game, just pick an anime character and use their name
Still rocking the insect glaive though
I don't remember my hr, but it's low, like 9 I think
If y'all want to add me too I use this name everywhere
how appropriate that I'm starting to play PBS on international women's day
Then again, I prefer stepmania
I would not play osu without a drawing pad
now to wait 5 hours for it to download
PBS for pc get
oh fuck, burnout paradise remaster came out yesterday
now that I've managed to play a bit in high rank, I'm starting to understand some of these https://imgur.com/a/JdyUX
Though there is one place where I'm pokemonnumber351
I've always been castform5, but I should shorten it to just cast5
I've same deal as Pats
I grew up with burnout 3, revenge, and flatout
so no need to do a 20x burnout around the map
best things that I noticed, aside from smooth framerate, is that there are less challenge missions and that they're trophies now
one thing thtat I hated about it though, was that there's no inverted X axis camera, but you are not using the camera much anyways
also, most of the 75 base game cars handle pretty differently but not drastically so
eg. it's super easy to drift around 90 degree corners at top speed and full boost
the gameplay is pretty similar but the steering in burnout is a bit faster and it feels like the cars don't have much weight
sucks that there isn't any special card for the Criterion license
<@98541382393688064> I too would not complain
yay, I'm free now that I got plat in Burnout
I always have to take few minutes in training just to remember the combos every time I play
IIRC, I'm at juggernaut with Alisa
I too have been away from tekken for a while and the CPU could probably kick my ass easily
I was a MLP fan; met one of my friends through it, and that's about it
turbo versus could be so much fun
I hate that there is no option to play the special battles in versus
currently 40€ or equivalent, but it'll go down pretty soon I'd wager
I like to play Alisa a lot and sometimes Yoshimitsu for the lols
probably no shipping included in that price
try play-asia https://sea.play-asia.com/girls-und-panzer-dream-tank-match-english-subs/13/70bjll
man, trackmania is still so fun to play
never finished the final black race, which was 20 laps on a pain in the ass course
I played stadium2 a ton back in the day
right now turbo, since it's free on PSplus
goddamn I'm torturing myself too much with trackmania
I need to buy a daki...
get a guitar controller and waste time in phaseshift
good thing I have evening shift at work tomorrow/today
probs should go to bed, it's 5am
canyon is not bad but the narrow roads are annoying, valley is just no, rollercoaster lagoon is not bad, and stadium maps are great as always
turbo 4 car/race types and I hate like 3 of them
trial and error ad nauseum
I like the singleplayer time trial stuff
damn, the meltyblood crowd is as weird as I've been hearing
DS1's parry dagger, now that's the shit
even caestus is better
one thing that I don't like about DS3's parrying, is that parry dagger has awful frames
but they're a piece of cake when you have +8 dagger and a parry chain
tough part is that hornet unlocks after abyss watchers
small shield and early game hornet ring is easymode
120 crit yo
takes patience
it's almost like whenever I go fight Dancer with a dagger
gotta learn the tracks inside out and do everything frame perfect
right now trackmania is scratching that itch soulsborne created
then again, that's with 100hrs of DeS, 400hrs DS, 100 hrs DS2, and 700hrs DS3
as much as I love the soulsborne franchise, I didn't like BB that much
even that ended up with parry baiting and backstab fishing with a bit of luck
except maybe the orphan fight
I've nothing interesting out of BB
Operation genesis was so much fun
I've got 7 long races to go
next long race I think I'll go with Running in the 90's
with the power of eurobeat, I managed to beat the race after over 1 hour of trying
now imagine deja vu blaring from headphones
10 hours of Deja vu does help
these last tracks are insanely drifty and I figured it would help if I have some inspirational music to go with it
40 tracks remain
woo, got to black tracks
I try to not mash buttons so it hasn't happened to me that often
sometimes yeah
even with a shield you get partial that eats all your stamina
early parry frames are usually the way to go, so you can go with reaction instead of predicting
OG buildcraft was how I got into it
I played mc alpha a lot, and then a lot later discovered mods
Conquer and build a huge base on that island to the north
What modpack
I call symphogear a "musical mecha-magical girl" show
Ye I meant AE2, I just call it without the version
Applied energistics does almost everything, I love it
I never got into ender conduits but their mechanic is cool
that almost sounds like how my brother wants me to play MTG, but I kinda hate TCGs
30 more to go
1 hour 40 minutes to complete one track
damn, 1 hour in on trackmania and no progress has been made
super incest bros is next, but that's for tomorrow
this JoJo mod has been very enjoyable so far
using stands of your own
I feel like this is the proper way to fight Lightsaber Pope and his Stand, Star Platinum
crab stand is so fucking OP
it's pretty fun to kill enemies with their own moveset stands
aww
cheat engine is a bitch to install, but after that it's pretty easy
https://youtu.be/CBDdcP6Ofl4
started playing a JoJo mod in DS3, it's fun
I'll have to see what weeb souls is about when it comes out
Gael and midir were a lot of fun too with this mod, even though it was very easy to cheese them
Well it's listed as JoJo mod, but the proper name is Titanite is Unbreakable
I mean, that's the name of the mod
this ending was really fun, you became the stand
mimic stand doing its job
super incest bros was even more fun with a stand
It was also used to set fires with phosphor ammo from far away
It was a pretty effective gun in the winter and continuation war
It's a weird design
The shells drop straight down too
It's heavy and there is no proper handle for it
For the first shot yeah
Watch the forgotten weapons episode on it
It's crank operated
The loading mechanism on that is fun
It's a finnish AT rifle, 20mm
I want a Lahti L-39 to be made into an anime girl
Yay I got suomi kk, which is PPSh
I'm trying to manage it
Yay got a catgirl
also 4* AS Val
416
yay, got my first 5* in gungame
didn't switch have that senran kagura game that uses the HD touch thingy
oh yeah, might as well post mine too; it's 31743
Pats, you might need to download the apk from somewhere else

also she's got short skirt, thigh highs+garters
I like the design of the actual gun and the combo of a military uniform, long ponytail, and her personality are things that I like
hey my PP2000 is being a derp
nej
my older brother suffered through sigma 1 on the hardest difficulty
always wanted to play it but never bothered
playing ninja gaiden sigma is one of my longest standing to do thing
damn
nwphone-whodis
wntsumfuk
I played every game except goddess black heart
yeah, the spinoffs are kinda meh most of the time
even if side scrollers are not my cup of tea most of the time, I'll still play this because I'm a whore for all things nep
I knew beforehand that a new nep title was in the works by a canadian studio, because SBFP mentioned it in their podcast
http://ideafintl.com/updates/2018/05/16/6191.html
oooh, a new nep title later this year
only bf that I've played a lot of is BC2, where I liked to use XM8LMG, which was a terrible weapon
416 is great, but I still like FAMAS, which is almost at par
now I got a 3rd loli cowgirl
I too got 2 loli cowgirls at one point
my biggest gripe with BB was "does not open from this side"
fuck, I need like 13 hours to barely function
I liked nepVII so much I've now bought it three times
All were/are pretty good phones for everything
I had a nexus 5 couple years ago, now a nexus 6p, and one of my friends had a nexus 5x
From what I've seen on streams and such
It was more severe on PC
IDK, does cyberdimension still run like shit on PC
Of course there's PP too, but no psp sadly
I have all except cyberdimension on PC
I'm not exactly short on cores right now, but more is always better
2 extra is too many
I have way too many SAAs at this point
they do have decent stats though
huh, that's weird
I was thinking of making a lolsquad with only rifles at some point
Amamiya Sora has several characters
that's about all that I recognize by name
Tomatsu Haruka
Welrod MkII is Imai Asami, aka. Noire
FF M239SAW is <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
oooh, Gr G41 is the tsundere queen Kugimiya Rie
and so is NTW-20
Kar98k is <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
M21 is by Eri too
Astra is apparently Aqua
I need to get a Stechkin because she's voiced by Kitamura Eri
just put your squads to fuck off for 6 hours and you're done for the most parts
gfl feels weird to me in that it doesn't really need that much managment in the later parts
ye
I just noticed this when I was browsing my ARs
I might need to start using StG44, since she is voiced by <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Get some extra xp and pump out combat reports
I've done emergency 1-4 like 34 times now
Most of the time I'm just grinding levels for my newcomers
haven't even bothered to complete 3-3 yet
I feel like everyone is progressing much faster than me in gfl
I just got mai raifu F2000 and want to put her somewhere
damn, gfl has too many pretty girls that are decent
IIRC that is
frame syncing causes a lot of frame tears in general
higher fps is always better but completely useless on a 60Hz monitor
I only played foundry on PS4 of Doom, but completed it on PC
I use my google profile so it's probably much more difficult to force through
yah, I've been trying to login for 2 hours now
fucking "hold square to pay respects" still cracks me up
feels weird playing cod:AW in a long while
yay, I got a Vector; *proceeds to ignore her over other guns
I call F2K either a fishgun or an oar
Not yet at least
Oh XM8 you mean, then no
This is fishgun
What a perfect package
And ZR with garters
That midriff
Her uniform style is cool
I might change my adjutant from PP2000 to F2000, because she looks so good too
That's PP2000
there are so many characters with great ZR in GFL
I do have a place for her
eventually
Yay, got a Thompson
fun way to skip dialog in FO3
maybe a shotgun that shoots 37 grenades paired with kill all children mod was not so great idea
hence why 3x world speed everyone sounds like they're on crack and helium
VATS modifies global time so that it sounds deeper in slow mo
I now see why SGTM alters sounds
mods to the rescue
SGTM makes sounds higher pitch
this game is fucked
oh man, I started playing FO3 on PC for the first time...
game, what are you doing
I now have 3 UMP9
my lolsquad of only rifles is performing as terrible as I expected
I got 2 UMP9, maybe the game is telling me that I need to use her

weird, I would've thought they kept it as continuation high
is it really called jatkosota high
Yay got one of the new guns
<@102691114762371072> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
sure I could cheese my way up to like 5-1 or closer to 6, bit I'm just sitting at 4-2
I've been just grinding levels
I think I could not handle an all bosses enemy randomiser like he did
lobos is good
only regular run that I haven't done is miracle only
doing different runs is fun too
it's just so fun when you know the game in and out, and you can just go in and feel like a boss
guesstimation
he's kinda like me with DS3, as I have 700 hours in that
nah, kerrik has played BB a dozen times through
you want mods or online, there's no inbetween
digital is a thing that exists..
I just ran it normally to grind exp and pass time
only took 170-something tries
oh yeah, I got G17 couple days ago too
I like the event login screen in GFL
speaking of 5* SMGs, I finally got Suomi couple days ago
it's 00.00 utc-8, which for me is 10am
classic armored core style game would be fun
like, nintendo showed daemon ex machina but nothing more than that
it's always the smaller games at E3 that are more interesting
samus always had great thighs
still classic japanese setting
oh, shadows die twice is the subtitle of sekiro
ghost of tsushima, shadows die twice, wind road, nioh 2, just from the top of my head
which would be >1
surprisingly many classical samurai games were shown
Yay, got G36
if JC3 taught me anything, that's definitely coordinates
oh well, try again and see if it works
finally re-downloaded cache, and the issue persists
ye
constantly says that authserver is busy, try again
I haven't been able to login for couple of days now for some reason
which will be wednesday probably
I'll try again when I have much faster and more stable internet
yeah
well I hope I can get my game fixed by then
oh yeah, when does the event end?
what a mysterious problem
thanks reddit
yay I got back into GFL
https://youtu.be/7mWuWlKVN_I these endgame tracks are so fun
Yay finally got a tsun gun
every time I try to roll for something specific all I get are Mosins
double suicide is such a great move
but also WA2K "tsun gun" is pretty cute
they even gave the players a bunch of recources because their ad company screwed up
it's kancolle, but with guns
and 426 quick prods
I have 528 of those
Yay I got lucky on 60th try
bingo card complete!
Woo, got a bear
speedruns at least are a test of skill, not like trackmania isn't, but this is the same 1-2 minute track over and over again
I too could stream from my ps4, but watching trackmania trial and error is not exactly enjoyable
or actually it might be my 4th
I got my 3rd tokarev today
Wow, only 7 autobattles to get this one
I NEED THE SHOTTIES
doggo does spin to win, pls nerf
could almost be vicar amelia too
HAH, had to read to get it
that was a fun little stream
maybe I'm just too tired to get the hang of the last track
https://www.twitch.tv/castform5 I'll just grind myself to bed in trackmania
yeee, hanebado looks and feels damn good
I don't need a plot in my arcade racing
10 tracks remain in stadium
https://youtu.be/Pa6cXyyF_7U ugh, fucking finally finished lagoon black
but I dunno if it's with that
I got it simultaneously with a x number of heavy production uses
also, 4 tracks remain in my trackmania grind
it's a reward apparently
oh, I got type97S too
now how much did you whale to get it
https://www.twitch.tv/castform5 might as well stream couple of the stadium tracks
I like 256 because 2^8 and because ipv4 uses it way too much
I've 61 just laying around
I always forget to make/use my combat reports
there are assloads of her
the most frequent T-doll reward is probably M14
ds4, ds4windows, works flawlessly
noire's scream is amazing in the dub too https://youtu.be/OZlT01rCDtA?t=2m22s
the dumb laugh is important
excuse me it's "oh my, how lewd; HGNHGNGHGHGG"
and nep games in a nutshell https://i.imgur.com/iQapka9.png
oh yeah, speaking of references https://i.imgur.com/Zx3by9N.png
uni and noire are the best
not that it makes the scenes any worse
the localisation sometimes adds a lot of new material that is not in the script
https://i.imgur.com/RdzilJN.png I also like the work that neps' TL/localisation team has done
I'm a huge sucker for referantial comedy and 4th wall breaks, so neps is the perfect thing for me
Nep has infected so many other games, it's great
Damn, I want to play BO3 just because of the nep mod
in the formation screen you can tap a unit to see the places better
Right after adding alice...
+1 action point, spawn/resupply/repair, like kaliks said
no huge info dumps
it teaches everything pretty well imo
spend time get resources
imo KC has better design consistency, since the gun character designs vary a lot
tap the counter if you want instant
probs some SMG, so like 430/430/430/230
retire=grinder
dupes can be used as upgrades and sometimes dummy links
ok it seems to have been fixed
I don't know if it has been fixed but I can try doing it again
at that point it will tell you that you performed an illegal action and kick you into login
the game performs the actions out of order and sometimes fails to trigger events, so your unit and an enemy unit can overlap without a fight happening
it happens when you've planned actions that include several battles for couple units, but only if you keep skipping result screens by tapping them
I've had it many times, but I also know how to recreate it
I use it a lot, but it can cause the game to bug out and kick you back into the login screen
no need to tap out of result screens and such
after executing the plan you can just leave the game running for the rest of your turns
then select a unit and tap its route on the map
ok so if you want the game to play itself for a few turns you can tap the planning mode in the bottom left corner on the map during a mission
oh yeah, alice have you figured out planning mode yet?
autobattles do level
no exp from logistics iirc
yes the leader must be above a certain level in some missions
someone correct me, it's levels 10, 30, 70
if you have 1 extra you can effectively double (1.5x I think) the unit's HP
yaaay, you came to your senses
maybe I should swap 416 with the new type95
that's useful
and missions for stuff like production
you have to use a dupe
that works too
damn I need to grind a bunch of resources so I can dump them into heavy prod again
on the later missions with good squads it's possible
bronze is always for completion, silver is capturing all nodes, and gold is specific requirements
I've ben using her for a long time and she's pretty powerful
yeah, that's a good one
yeah, even with 4* you only get couple hundred effectiveness max for a character
since 2* stuff is more prevalent with the occasional higher tier, it could be useful to have a couple 3* or even 4* equipments on hand
I think alice should have plenty resources so 100/100/100/100 should get good equipments
FO 1 and 2 had some of the greatest dialog options ever
handguns, rifles and machineguns, oh my
equip enhance is after N1-4
Uzi has cute sleep pose
earlier in the year I went to a piano concert that had a whole FFX adventure section
huh. weird that they didn't perform to zanarkand
Nope
Thanks reddit
Apparently it's a pretty widespread issue
God damn, another problem I have to figure out
uninstall and redownload the .apk
yay, got GFL back in working order
didn't kick me out since a battle started
woo, managed to perform an illegal action again
I'm an occasional hoarder in these types of games
I have like 100 cores usually
I got bunch of them too at one point
oh shit, welrod is Imai Asami, which means I can make Uni and Noire combo team
since we mentioned louise and taiga in general, G41 is Kugimiya, so she must be a tsun gun too
oh, M21 is Eri too
damn I need to get stechkin because Eri Kitamura
browsing the VA list again..
save some cores at the same time
I mean I could keep them around when my basic one gets to 70
I just got 2 TAR-21s from heavy prod
they say IDW DANYAA
cables ftw
oh yeah, SAA is #1
change of pressure times time does sound correct

I rarely roll IDW, mostly get her from missions
It's an unfortunate misclick if my F2K offers me snacks
I can tolerate the whole cutesy servant thing just because it's a military setting where you are the commander. Other than that, I give 0 shits about what my gun says
fastest click route to an end state, be that bad end or not
get eroges into AGDQ/SGDQ
netting, and netsec, since it's kinda mandatory
I need to play hacknet at some point, but it's too close to what I'm studying
Premium live 2d
Can't you buy outfits in gfl with exchange tickets
Massive hat acquired
the waifu gods demand your whale money
'tis fun
yeees, get into the gfl grind
now what to do with 629 express repairs
apparently yes
I've 151 reports because I'm a hoarder with too much time
combat reports to the rescue
I grinded one of my squads from sub 6k CE into +10k in the weekend when I was bored
dat massive burst damage
6p62 is kinda weird in that it's an AR that can use AP rounds
ok, nice
I think so
is 6P62 still in the login rewards?
I liked the bingo card system
there probably was one before the one that had five-seven as a reward
with the phase system?
:3
I'd say 9 is cuter
ump45 is a much better tank, but ump9 has somewhat better stats
Nice login screen again
Me too
been using them too much and I'm about to run out
no, and I have only 614 left
it might be that finland might restrict lootboxes too
just got 45 too

I don't even know how english autocorrect would react to the way I mangle english words to fit finnish speech
doesn't help that I type in spoken word most of the time
I try to disable aoutocorrect in everything I have because finnish just wrecks it
the tasbot run of celeste is a really fun watch
a hat in time is also really good
gotta farm those high levels and scrap them for cores
additional content via gameplay is fine for me
it's super shitty if its real money only for powerups and the like
they set a nice precedent and more countries should follow it
good bad luck
I got thompson and vector back to back
Yay for planning mode
you could just drop down before the walkway onto a platform
yah ok, luring out one at a time ahead
or in the ruins
in the lake? those be taurus demons
or just lure the stab and get them to fall off
the trick actually is going into their face and parrying them
you climb sen's and then you're a hop skip and a FUKKEN ARCHER away from invading golden boi
it happens if you dont kill lautrec early
dark souls
respawn is the old IW guys anyway
I wonder if there was some staff cross-over between sledgehammer and respawn when AW and titanfall came out
actually, I'd love to have a new AW, but since infinite was a massive flop, it's highly unlikely that a new one will be made
and I really liked AW, but a lot of people hated it
it's kinda like a much improved version of advanced warfare's
while I havent played titanfall, I love the movement system in it
if no fall damage go top, otherwise fall jump
a whole 500 megabytes!?
shirabe fucks
now if only it was modded MC
all the spinny shit was fun
I played a lot with insect glaive
oh damn, a new timesplitters would be the shit
not sure if I should link cis-fire, even if it is a fun parody song
gone home is such a fun meme
The board that we call /v/ is a fun song too
the big boards like v and b are such a clusterfuck
yeah, 4chan humor is a bit iffy
on the pc is another one
https://youtu.be/heIH9vfwKBM /v/ the musical uses it as a joke in couple of their songs
