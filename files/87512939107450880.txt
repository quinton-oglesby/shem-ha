That server icon is just 10/10
like topics, comments and such
well it was implied that it should be used by those who use steam.
Phanta went pretty close but it does have some more functions than that
It's just an idea.
I was thinking, what if we make a group on steam at which the people here can request to join?
i tought of this in the past but it passed away from my mind. What do you think? I am asking this to the mods too, i don't want to take initiatives that could be disliked.
it's a bit complicated
you just keep stuff separated. worst case kast will close your kast account
Also the discord server would get warned
i said you're liable.
i didn't say your account will get terminated
it would be streaming a warez
You are liable of account termination
Don't
sure
i agree with maria
it would become heavy and lose the "slow burn" format
i wouldn't go over 3 episodes/week tho
well it could be upscaled to two episodes a week
yeah
tho i wanted to do it a bit earlier, but i didn't know of the anniversary
Regarding the ovas (shinai right?), i don't see those an issue, we could
That could work
hm
Uh when is that?
Hello hello Cypher here, i know i never talk in this channel, but i have something to suggest that's been brewing in my head since a couple of months, if not more.
I already mentioned this to Melua, but i will explain here: I was thinking to organize a slow burn, programmed rewatch of Symphogear. This has been made in the past, but the last time it was made was *before* XV actually aired (at least to my knowledge). Of course i would test the waters with just the season 1, if people aren't interested there's no meaning to plan other seasons.
Regarding the platform, years ago rabb.it was used, infact we have a dead link of it still pinned in <#371105434771390465> (plz don't remove that pin, it's history! for those who don't know the channel is named like that for group watches). Now if you click that link it will redirect to kast.gg, which seems to be the spiritual sequel of rabb.it. I don't know the platform itself but i could work around and do some tests to see if it works.
So... i am writing here to ask your opinions, ideas, approval and whatever it may be added to this. (Time/date are to be decided)
ok ok
where is my app lel <@!250295696714891285> https://puu.sh/IAHOp/b77eaa62e8.png
there is nothing
where is my system tray :<
normal exe in the zip runs
ok i downloaded the server alone that crashed
what is the order?
Let's be clear about this
it seems to crash
if there was a systray
Sure
lol
so fast that i can't read
ah yes that feeling when the exe of the server just closes itself
what about connecting clients?
nova just got confused.jpg
eh
onto the server
because it says you need the app to login
it's web based?
<@!199928870810419200> are you sure
I could try that if people are willing
anyways
if you go on rabb.it it redirects to kast
Kast.gg is supposed to be rabb.it son
but where the users have to login? on web?
hearing that's OS it's a good point
how does it work?
<@!199928870810419200> looking att jellyfin
i have the goods ™️
that's not the issue
Sure no one has been bonked *yet*
I discarded discord as the option because we would be essentially breaking the ToS
Does anyone know *any* valid alternative
that kast.gg screen share option is under a paywall
but i discovered
Okay people, since i'm wracking my brains on this i need some degree of help. I was testing stuff for the rewatch
what's this power? it smells like that self-proclaimed based people are cringe
and watch it with the cultured crew
or grab a seat at Cypher's Cinema
Basically, the thing is like this: You can either watch it on your own
<@722121666641133608> i think you got confused, i was referring to lily white
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Okay sorry i was sleeping but it's exactly how Charlotte described
i will essentially stream from a server i host
the system i will use is jellyfin
Okay people we came down to a "decision". We will both do a "on their own" rewatch, lily and friends (praise our custodians) will open a rewatch channel, and i will host watch parties, i can guarantee the system to work on a quality 720p-4mbps for 6 users at the time. The plan is to proceed 3 episodes a week i will post a timetable, remember that i'm european in that regard.
because there is no chat yet
Yeah we should
if there is an in app chat
I tested with the *other lily* it works but i need to understand
with
ok ok i need someone to test
IT WORKS
NVM
why does this thingg does not recognize subs
subs
hmmm
i'm managing
but yeah let's wait for when we are done for the rewatch (we are at 2/5)
i would be up for that
hilariously enough
you know miso
ASTERISK
hint: look at the only one pinned message in tthat channel
can know this detail
Only really senior members
I would be delighted to do that
Well that one is irrelevant dw
Ah ok
Hello hello, i was thinking, after yesterday's rewatch session and after having discussed in <#336298587745157120> with a few others who were present, if, after gear rewatch ends, i could resurrect the reason for wich <#371105434771390465> is called like that, group watches of anime. Of course the cool thing would be to make polls about what to watch. What do you ppls think?
i prefer my beyond the time
i find cgdct boring for most of the times for a mere example
I think that anyone would be like that
i know there is someone interested, but i don't have certainties
let's see if people post
~~just let solopy pick a strict selection~~ /j
it becomes a polls inception
how do we decide the animus
but there is a third bigger issue impending in my brainm
1) is something we discover with polls
which is not different from what happens without group watch
you will just see people discussing of x random anime post watch
during the watch
so we wouldn't flood the anime club
i don't think point 2 is an issue since it never was back then. Now we also have <#336298587745157120>
now i can volunteer to host for the EU gang
not replace the channel
So back at my proposal, my intention is just reviving the group watch component
it was the old rabbit system to stream
made by alice
if you check out the pin in that channel you will find a post
because of group watches
the channel was just anime discussion, then it got moved into anime club
this is why i am here to clarify
sorry there, seriously i misscapsed
a missclick on caps
and that was
lmao
did both things
og use o the channel
calm down
NO NO
I want to give a try to the true old use of <#371105434771390465> , it being group watches
Ok it's time to sit and think seriously on this
and thanks

but both are on the tomboy side of the things
Graphically i meant
has some resemblance with mikoto
because Nagisa
it fits a lot

for mikoto and precure fans
they just got hasted to a certain point so they have shorter lifespan
all clones can grow
Yes she can

all the main characters (protagonists, deuteronists and tritagonists) in that point of the story
the characters from the right to the left are Misaki, Mikoto, Index, Touma, Accel, Qliphah 545, Last order, hamazura, hamazura's gf, and Dion Fortune

well, unbased and sad but i will comply as the rules state
rule 2c
ok
i will remove it.
If a rule was produced as result of that
Is it stated in the rules?
Fucking great

Everyone knows that Fudou will mess things up in XV
it's awesome
Yep
i used to watch Zoids Chaotic Century at the timew
Well yeah
are from that period
Well some of my favourites
should i do that?
i never watched it
oh dear, i didn't mean THAT bang
well everyone expects good songs from XV, they must end it with a bang
:hype: <:Ver:336656981144109066>
we are close
Come on people
but it is so logical
I was a bit speechless there
OH THE SKATING
this is still toned down
in the blu ray
Think how the colours will be
hah you miss the *bang*
*hopes in more shirabe yoyo play*
that fight was cool yeah
All the transformations will be mind blowing, i think that bikki's one will be the simplest
10000/10
Of course we did joe
like G did
right from the episode 1
Well the plot seems interesting
from season 1
Yeah the posing
Yeah
It's insane
That's some high level material
What about Bikki transformation?=
YEAH
and Yeah Hibiki song during the exam left me a bit surprised
i'm amazed.
Ok i watched XV ep 1
*The last action hero that the planet needed*
He was the *man of the truth*
*Ai desu yo*
Well he saved the world in the end
LOL
*looks at hajimari no babel*
*Owari no babel?*
It is good indeed
in the lyrics
The song quoted axia no kaze
It was a different song
heh
no pillar men here
that's not jojo you know
and that was a *great* cliffhanger
The songs they showed were awesome too
since it should close the whole series
the whole plot seems promising
Well to wrap up anyways, the animation was very high level
*runs away*
and now the hot question: *will dr ver appear again this time too?*
*geah intensifies*
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
*yey*
AND NEXT EP WE GET THE OPENING!
in the song
by Axia no kaze being mentioned
Anyways i got a bit surprised
😂
Gz joe
Yeah
disaster he had to handle
Well he slimmed out with that heavy political and geopolitical
KILLED ME
TRUMP SCENE
I highly expect
Oh my custodian...
The animation showed a bubble of air
from the street level.
Genjuro did a jump on a 4 floors building
Does science say that i can burn my memories to obtain a **7 Billion of Zesshous phonic gain level**?^
Oh yeah, they did a good job, gear gives thermal exposure protection
^
Regarding the singing in space, they had somewhat a bubble of air surrounding them
TRUE
KIRIKA SAID THAT
LOL
*a problem? -> fists*
like bikkie does
You can just punch the plot
encoding intensifies
*waikyou senshoujing*
HEH
was pretty good
Yeah that conversation beetween Miku and bikki
Well she is free from the original sin
New miku song?
i'm still on the hype train
23.22 here
Yeah.
heh
i read mangos too
!
?
アアアアアアアア
Or
i hope topdad doesn't get even a frame
Oh god
WAIT
poor dmjii
LOL
Let's hope the villain isn't empty like adam.
i've high expectations, nothing else to add
*hands up*
that's a LOOONGshot
Lol voyour
I don't think so anyways, it was just a filler appearance
yes
Oh that one
Uh who are you talking about raki?
Maybe HE WAS TOPDAD in disguise?
Flare beacon man = **New True Last Action Hero that saved the world**
Oh so
Heh.
got sidetracked by various things
i'm still at the start solo
the signal flare
OH TRUE
Phonic gain: 1
Science: 0
but you know *phonic gain*
for a min
Infact they lost consciousness
how silly of you
Gear THERMAL EXPOSURE SOLO
No!
*7 billion zesshou? hah what a joke*
I can't start to imagine the power scaling
And they BARELY beat it
Exactly
let me say that it was well beyond Noise level
Anyways the Coffin was pretty powerful
10/10
OH TRUE
kirika lifting shirabe?
do wonders!
Well Movies, martial arts and physical exercises
Joe, he didn't touch it, it shattered a few cms before
He didn't touch the giant sword
It will be the same i bet it, everyone overflowing the hype here
Have fun sleeping
go solo, new fanfic
intensifies?
foreshadowing
Ok ok, all clear
it's not VN exclusive
Oh that one, i remember it being in HF 1st movie too
what line was ?
i'm sad now that i couldn't catch it
Oh
<@279341087494242304> why that question about HF?
LINKER > DEATH <@185949743321579520>
MASTER
*DESS*
I TOUGHT IT WAS DEATH MASTER
Kerrik our lord and saviour
God, you want elfnein to sing the god blessed RURURIRA
in b4 elfnein gets a gear
i will disappointed if shirabe doesn't include yoyo
*damn yes*
*looks at shirabe's*
Exactly.
i mean.
and Gungnir is the plainest gear
that overkills me every damn time
HEH
Heh
*looks at xdrive* @miracles
For that budget
and killed me thrice
then the episode slapped me to reality
i tought "wtf have they regressed to S1?"
anyways back to XV, when i saw the start of the Transformation animation
LOL
*being able
She couldn't expect bikki being to absorb 7 **BILLION** Zesshou
*boom*
Cryosopeia when
at the restaurant
i literally had to stop the episode and rewatch the whole scene when topdad made bikki pay the bill
worst character
I'm so satisfied with him leaving the series
(Topdad is the true villain, even more powerful than the custodians)
Topdad was included in Carol's plan?
keikaku doori
Carol could have planned her plan better
and i just saw the <:Cag:423197445644615711>  scene again
AXZ in these days
Look i'm rewatching
yes
oh the perfect body thing
Hm, i doubt
RURURIRA, FREEZE THE SUN
was better than the pavarian illuminati ones
if Carol Faust Robe
I was wondering
in making the linker
We could have employed the mad scientist
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Carol was just a better character
how much i hate elf9
Anyways that reminds me
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
*ai desu yo*
*The man of the truth*
LOL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2FkFf5G_Sw
This IS STILL giving me chills down my spine
well i'm going for sure now, gn people
i agree with pat daddy
in all seasons honestlyu
phonic gain increase was all over the place
those *were* s1 BGMs
Oh then i wasn't having deja vus
Oh i missed the connection for the crhis sentence
damn lydian theme
i catched those  two as well
uh what ones melua?
2.02 AM
aaand i believe i will go to bed now
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
LOL
nah i had the opportunity to see that, i downloaded the normal files not BD ones, at the time ofc
oh hands up sorry
in that scene.
can't defend Basa tapping around
come on.
that's not art style in that scene melua
i was thinking about THAT EXACT SCENE
THAT
THAT
DESS
will we get some
and i'm not the kind of person that watches only high detailed shows
of course it isn't but i had some hard facepalms during S1
hands up
can't argue if you put it like that
yes.
yeah
Don't forget about miku
hype
Nooo poor basa
*ai desu yo*
did somebody say
Lol
the Fool Stone was an addition
i'm pretty sure that dainsleif didn't die out
they didn't lose it
well why no ignite is the question
in VX
remember that we will see more ignite
Shirabe is 15 in AXZ
ye
rip
Lol no
no jokes aside i remember her being tall as bikki
Since always?
or Create a future with a light god could not know??
lmao
Anyways i expect Kazanari Fudou butting his head in and making a mess of the plot by creating more problems than the true villain will do
Hmmm if you put it like that
But it would work out well
at least for me
Hmmm it would be a bit bitter as an ending
And i'm starting to theorize that the gears will be lost at the end of S5
and connecting it to episode 1
about the logo
I'm wrapping my head
what wizardry is that lol
872p??
THe heck?
thanks, it's robbed screentime.
No no Stroganoff 2 no
lmao gen movies
Wait wait
uhm?
And when i saw the concert that shotfired me so hard, "this WONT end well"
since there's trump
Eh we tought to nougat
i didn't expected the alchemyst overkilling the girl
I'm so shocked by this episode
i just finished EP 2
god.
my
Oh
And yeah kirika failing at scythe
i expect more Yo Yo tricks in her transformation scene
Yoyo master Shirabe 100/100
the THING WITH THE SOCKS
and then DESS IGALIMA TRANSFORMATION
too much cool and pretty
the freefall scene overkilled me
freefall transformation?
do we want to talk how awesome was the DMJii
Yeah absolutely
THAT JOKE
<@279341087494242304> what do you think, did kaneko get his things straight for once?
i'm shivering
i feel bad for her
for basa
Anyways so much suffering inbound
Gear is in 45 or not
Help me
I lost it.
being an asshole with them
expect Kazanari Fudou
And double the damage solo
yeah
I expect *suffering*
^
hit the mark
"Ki-sama"
tsubasa screaming
Oh yeah
Oh the part during the heli approach
you freaking madman
OF COURSE YOU DO
since the other times evacuations were succesful
i think is the greatest disaster Noise related
that number shocked me
Oh
so, elf9 singing rururira when
^
in ep 1
And don't forget that shotfire
yes
at this point
I expect Miku gear
made me laugh
after the ending?
turning into ash
what about the custodian
right guys
OH
yeah
even worse.
In that case i fear for basa
Uhm
it just sent her in a semi berserk state
I think that the eye in that scene wasn't enough since it was like a second
thing
THE EYE
OH TRUE
i know
into a spy?
Turning basa
what do you mean solo^?
uhm?
13.
Momria
for that
solo, expect fudou complaining and bashing her
I can bet on it
or something like that
"Tsubasa you failed into saving 100.000 innocent souls, you are worthless of kazanari blood"
What what do i have to rejoice for?
her equipment
But i think the suitcase just contains
roflmao
i liked her design
the nekomimi alchemist?
What about
that would have been overkilling basa
Oh god
Yehaz
let's put it like that, Maria tried a similar thing and failed
Oh yeah "look we are serious" > kills an innocent girl
not enough time to run away
and the whole thing collapsed
the scene took place too fast
I don't think so
I think the same
<@279341087494242304> he must be triggered that our dear fanfiction writers did better than him
uh
yes yes
Yes what about the CV?
what are you talking about?
Uhm
for those 100k
Kazanari fudou will bash SONG
Hah you fools
like that
he can't use his ninjutsu
Poor ogawa
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
finè?
did somebody say
You better go watching
you kidding me? plotholes!
Wait what, do they mention 2012?
backplottwist Trump is actually a pavarian illuminati
Omg
apparently
Abe Shinzo too
Yes
it's important to keep track of the reaction images
BEST PIC
the one with the episodes!
where is our dear reaction pic?^
Oh right guys
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
*Ai desu yo*
in the end guys, Linker is love
knowning shirabe would bring another dose
i think she forgot on purpose
wot Kiri power?
mechajii
thanks solo
<@279341087494242304> what was the sentence said by Miku in ep 1?
"we are weaker than you but we're not afraid to do this "
I liked how the alchemist said off from the bat
of course
Yeah
And yeah they seem proper villains for once
Maria could have endured it much better
since Basa has the whole deal about being a guardian
in gear series
And i think the thing happened to the worst possible person
an animation mishap
well it looks like
like yesterday we said "They have stepped up in every aspect with those 2 episodes"
well kiri doing things with the pole wasn't anything new
"donuted"
with the girls? or without those?
Legit.
i mean the whole stadium collapsed
how did ogawa save himself in that scene?
Now i was thinking
wont open, i hate earrapes
and use them against you!
he can summon things from his fanfictions like in recreators
Run, the ~~dairokutenmaou~~ solopy567 is threatening you
CAN'T ARGUE 10/10
LEGIT POINT
*i am the bone of my sword*
LOL
he was the man of the truth after all
Well he did in AXZ, in maria's mind
😂
<@279341087494242304> will you get disappointed if Ver appears again?
You think karma will strike her back?
she appears with kirabe/dmjii/shirika running
Yes
WHERE IS "SHINJITSU NO HITO"?
we got fine and nastassja in the opening
anyways i was thinking one thing
don't worry
oh well take your time
let us see let us see!
+1
in your 22400 pics?
Are you prepared to save the villains artworks
Lmao kerrik
Murica failed again
(it went goodbye anyways...)
else goodbye custodian
Well SHe couldn't go all out, she didn't want to sink the ship
Yeah
let me re-fix it.
I'm not powerful enough to get my unintentional puns
OH
D:
Explain me the pun
done.
let me fix the sentence
no it wasn't
-> kills an innocent girl with lots of gore
And dubbed gear will be the bane of the world
Hah poor people trying to question "why to compare gear and MHA?"
it's better to close the video, the comment section just pokes me in the eye
ugh the people comparing Gear to MHA
But but it's a nice thing, gear will get more recognized in the west like that
no i didn't
Still better than topdad
He's the kind of man that would dig into the wound
"you failed to repel the enemy in japanese territory, you bring shame to kazanari guardian blood"
I can freaking bet on it.
You mean *kazanari fudou bashing basa and SONG* ?
WHat would have you done if you were put in the same situation of those civilians?
True
He could have stopped the noises around him with shadow weave
*AI DESU YO* <:Ver:336656981144109066>
HEH
since Hajimari no babel exists
Owari No Babel
What about the awesome ending guys? 😄
that shoots homing projectiles in the opening
Well there's the handcannon for chris
AI DESU YO
the others did stuff and Faust robes came out
fine is the only one that made gears
ichiaval should be 02
Yeah tsubasa is SG-r 01
sacred relic 03 gungnir?
Well i'm going to work cya later folks
*wants maria black gungnir again*
With cape
He is not going to sit still after such a tragedy in japan
Expect basa to break with fudou digging in her emotional wound
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Finish it
Of course him respawing would be bad
Would be more than enough
Well a flashback
Then we get the madman interfering from heaven in illuminati's plan
It's always 50-50 when talking about ver
Just don't
Oh noes, that debate always end badly
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Shinjitsu no hito
If he appears again i'm going to laugh so hard
(it was stupid)
Eh
No hold on, ver didn't approve carol's plan
Ai desu yo
He didn't need to
Why would an hero need redemption, what he did was to save the humanity <:Ver:336656981144109066>
And the man of the truth
And ver was already an hero
Well carol didn't get any true redemption
Cool
Let's order a relic on amazon
Can i be an attuned too?
Oh god
Eh i know, but this sort of discussion is one of the worsts
I wouldn't take this sort of discussion here guys
They've stepped up everything
As someone else said
I again expect shirabe yoyo master
Well anyways
That's the complete combo
But that... 10/10
Not that i know of (yet)
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The socks thing.
That transormation was awesome
Those were pure bliss
No. Of course not.
Y
The fight itself was slash this noise and this other one
I know kirichan was great but
Eh
So i can understand not liking it
Well the noise scene wasn't nothing exceptional
^
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Eh
I tought it was a pun meta
Capeee
"you disgraced kazanari blood by not saving those people"
Just wait for fudou bashing her down
*bang*
I guess
I'm waiting for yoyo master
Leave it be
It is legit to get annoyed but it can't be helped
Dess
I can understand what you say
10/10 kirichan
I do realize that
Well i feel a bit bad for dunkek
See why i told you that this discussion was bad?
Need moar
Where is <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Lol
Is a cyborg
He doesn't smell
Elf9 is just slight dislike
Topdad and adam are the 2 characters i reaaaally dislike
No pls
Look at least elf9 is faaaaaar better than topdad
For that
Hah i knew i would be hated
CyVer?
Rururira!
I sorta hate elf9…
Eh eh ehhhhh
!
Elfnein singing genocide?
Ikr
Yeah
Hi pats
That's one way of being an hero
*we take the pillar men*
Right from ep 2
Well trump already fucked up the season
Uh
Zetsubou
Suffering
Alcohol
Lolol
This situation smells of sparkle's fan fiction a bit
Cya have fun
I'm going back to work
So it can be a lot more enjoyable
Well the way of reasoning changes there
Legit
Kore wa ai
Question.
The last
I believe i should stop overhypeing ver every time
Yo
Desu
Ai
That moment when carol takes over
In the end
Well st germain was a nice character
when solo posts suffering
it's bad news
ZETSUBOU
WAT
damn hypocritical toughts
i hope XV bashes bikki down
^
bikki can kill gods yknow
Gungnir is lame
:d
what a nice thing
oh so we are back to brainstorming!
i don't expect people to like <:Ver:336656981144109066>
It's okay to be subjective
of the discussion?
what's the point
+1
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
CAG
noooh
i'm fine with Millarc outfit
ninja'd
>ogawa kidnaps Eliza
keeps the hype ablaze
is always good
well brainstorming
dess
hold your reins
You asking too much man
*runs*
and we ended up with half assed elf9
i liked caroru but she ended badly
heeeh i know
exactly
pls
no no, no redemption for millarc
+1
millarc red hair strad
the red fringe
hah that reminds me the saying "the clothes make the monk"
I just liked the way he's written
but i like him as a character
Something
Testament xdrive
S1 starts with straightforward despair and *suffering*
Yeah true enough
that's true.
Oh god
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
If it can relieve you i got a friend that got angry when kanade died
^
oh
into XV?
Kanade back
look wfc in the end everyone has its own opinions, i think you're not wrong in saying that nastassja would have just been fine with filling the role but i think that the whole thing would have been too much different to predict how actually kaneko would have written the plot at that point
to replace serena in AXZ of course!
Nastassja, Ryouko and Ver all worked in the same structure
13 eps? explanation? ha!
But again
^
oh well of course our dear scripter didn't do a great job about that
well hands up
it's a GX sentence.
"shinjitsu no hito, docta veeeru"
I say that his ramblings went all out only in GX
not during
but ver became a meme AFTER G
Tastes are always tastes
look wfc i don't want to discuss about ver again
it was like a rat put in a corner
then he went mad.
Nah, he actually had some serious and plotted out plan
I think that was when the madman went actually mad
so much hate for the last action hero
Cags had a masterplan that saved the situation in the end
wfc
Well i think everyone knows your opinion about the "Man of the truth <:Ver:336656981144109066>"
D:
WHAT WHY <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Yeah really, i liked Fine, carol and ver
is Adam.
in gear
Look the only Villan i really dislike
am i the only one that tends to like villains?
that got *overused*
they don't give the usual Kanade flashback to basa to make her return ""sane""
i just hope
"No original sin in miku"
well he should have read the report
LOL
I admit that my personal tastes are influencing my opinion tho
😦
"look your father is shit but he can't be helped so suck it up and deal with him"
Well the whole point there was making bikki realize
when i saw him making bikkie pay the bill
I just went nuts
exactly because he's the worst.
it's a LEGIT nickname.
his nickname
Akira is topdad
that's a character i reeeeally hate
worst character 0/10
fuck topdad
NO
i agree with that view
(and custodians)
like fooling both SONG and Pavarian
I somehow think he will screw up the events and end up being the final villain
he's like an old imperialist japanese general
Eh but wfc he makes a lot of sense
from Fudou bashing
to see Tsubasa suffer
I'm just shivering in wait for the next ep
HAH AGAIN?
but i can understand not liking him since it's a weird type of character
at least if he was explained better than "look at the scene he worked with ryouko"
he like pops out from nowhere
Ver needed a better background
but i have to agree with solo
but you can't really say what you gain
eh but you always know what you leavwe
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
ai no tame?
did i just read
OH
suffering!
YEAH
don't worrie
<@532591110489505812> it airs on saturday
I will rewatch the whole thing when bluray comes out
Poor tomosato
I freaking mean it's just "warm drink"
Atatakai mono -> tea
Uuugh that reminds me
and he would like to experiment on that
Miku doesn't have the original sin
Well it's because
true
Lol
i mean.
it's a freaking civilian
I think first thing: no more miku allowed on the freaking military submarine
it would drastically change things
Yeah
after it
since we get something reeeaallly unpredictable
if that happens i'm going to hype too much
there
and i agree about genjurou risking his plaace
Fudou will leash on basa and song like he's never did before
call me an S but i want to see fudou reaction to ep 2
FUDOU FREAKING KAZANARI?
like
to recover the autoscorers
nah it would be bad
hands up
as St germain teached us
and can be replaced
memory was the fuel
but she activated it without singing, remember?
it only provided insane boost
didn't require phonic gain
And <@185949743321579520> Carol's faust robe
the memory thing is a flaw
Keep in mind that pavarian illuminati can provide Philosopher stones
It can be fixed
it's a faust robe
*shivers*
and Elfnein fixes it
Carol relic
manage to recover
just think if they
OH GOD
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Then we get elf9 singing rururira
nah it can happen
i was just hypothetical
oh of course
nah he's a damaged character, he kinda pops up from nowhere
it's called background
if they show more of ver, at least we understand more his persona or his motivations
i would be rather pleased
!
come on 2 days and we get to fill another slot on the reaction pic
more than millarc (and millarc is pretty good)
i gotta say i like her design a lot
yeah
How nice
*runs*
is sad
sad joke
gotta finish with mass hype
let's wait for the season end
it's a bit pointless right now <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
LOL
that would be neat
organize a group rewatch when the season ends
we should
haha nice isn't it?
oh
?
one alone and the other with friends
4 times
i watched that ep
Lol
for love.
saki they were noting that Metanoia reads ai no tame in reverse
this power of love?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
You lost me here
uhm?
out
spit it ou
Go saki
it's written into the reports, there's no way he doesn't know that
does linker count as a black art? <:Ver:336656981144109066>
everybody is different
no one can deny those
of course gear has its own flaws
not enough, Gear major issue
13 ep
Again
her love story with the god
but but
it went full random
i have to agree with ep 13 G
DESS!
oh well i think the way kirika grew up is more than enough to justify some of her behaviours
<@124136423153467392> that made me laugh <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Lol i don't think that's a standard 15 years old girl starter pack
#2011
is that you???
YUKITERU AMANO?
IS THAT
i bet he can lift a tank
when you got genjurou?
who needs soldiers
Lol the joke with bikki
oh <@!81815015224516608> sorry then
~~noreason srsly~~ no in truth i was lazy to re-edit the message to put basa emote
because yes.
YT, heavenrending the sky since the curse of babal
what clips?
the folks on this discord shared it with me 1 year ago
i'm not that an avid digger
gotta say that this chills my veins every times

heh i got something to share if we say miku
?
oboete nai??
NE NE TOUMA
hah index
you know there's no reason sometimes
gotta take a look
thanks for the info
God.
i always avoided those
they're canon?
YEAH
HIGH CULTURE QUALITY CONTENT
THAT RELOAD
the song was an heaven's send
absolutelyyy
and YOYO MASTER
What about CHRIS TRANSFORMATION?
AND OI
FREAKING FUDOU
FUDOU SOLO
DID IT
FUDOU
SAW THE EPISODE
I JUST
OH GOD
it is
I MEAN
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT HIM DOING THAT
to bash on basa
anyways i expected fudou
the hype trainnnnnnn
or so it seems
<@279341087494242304> Kaneko did the right thing FINALLY
WERE SICK
THOSE NOISES
OH
with hype
i'm overlowing
and i'm so happy that the ep didn't centre on bikki
needs more shock
but got bad timing
and then she tried on bikky
YEAH
i didn't expect fudou going that far
REACTION PIC ALREADY?
OH DO WE HAVE
Yes
i meant he wants to use it for the sake of japan
yes sorry i'm engulfing in hype
the Snake
Yes
wants divine power for himself
since FREAKING fudou
Things are going to blow up
Oh let's see
LOCKED ON FAIAH
i damn meannnn chris
after her
with the song
ANYWAYS what about chris SNIPING IN MID AIR?
0.
the last week was 0.
I'm having problems holding the hype.
oh my god
DID SHE SAY THAT?
OH
pats
i knew you would say that
where.
.
the reaction pic guys
LOL?
bat girl.
think as an imperialist
he's an old imperialist
is something 10/10
The V sign
from Trump
fudou stole the bracelet
so basically
at the fudou scene
the shock factor was greater, at least for me
no come on.
and kaneko is doing great.
.
the episode was the best of the 3
anyways to sum up
momria ftw
a lot.
that was cute
and THAT MAKES IT JUST BETTER
but I damn agree he went to far
he's an imperialist, he does that for japan
They're not selfish
today someone was talking about onee san ara ara
Oh
basa returning to consider helself a blade
https://puu.sh/DVgbl/de8faead68.png
right people
i got confused
*eliza
no reason to gank them like that.
millarc and elsa were trading blood
in the end
WE ASKED FOR
THE BANG
DID IT
OH CHRIS
it will end up like kirika CALLING MILLARC ON HERSELF
don't bet on that
:hides:
i wonder if people will hate him more than Ver now
Well until now Fudou did a masterplan
i seriously doubt
something like that
"Since SONG is useless for my goals and to bring out the greatness of japan, let's use someone else to do the same thing!"
but i think the deal is
yes
we got NOBLERED
one san type today?
hi ayamine were we talking about ara ara
with the blade thing
i think it's important that basa is back to square one
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
IN MID AIR
You mean chris?
high level stuff
SAKiiiii
10/10
#noble red
<@279341087494242304> what is better, XV Fudou or Mysunshine fudou?
with the ep
but yeah i'm too much satisfied
like a friend of mine hating Hibimiku
but sometimes you get weird results
i managed to get severals
THey were both very very very good
since it will get overshadowed by chris's one
this ep
I think they did wrong showing Yo Yo Master henshin
EVERYONE WISHED FOR
THE BANG
OH
he will become a god if left unstopped
He wants divine power
9 usually
here
22 pm
rofl
i think they included Vanessa in the talk
said they're still humans
And Eliza and Millarc
that's a stretch
lol
thanks
i found it melua, don't worry
mechanic
i think she's just partially
she's a robot
and no i don't think
rofl
uh in that case blast the "error"
i hope they fix it in BD
it can be glossed over.
well it's a slight error
not being animated
THE KITTO MATA
OH
and i'm goddamn curious to see the "daedalus end"
i will check
Oh ok
can i get the time?
where guys
i didn't notice that
Yes
where melua?
uh?
but this ep had no color death
then we will see the true power of XV animation
Guys let's just wait that we get proper Blurays
it's just kitto mata
of course!
Tenka fubu!
No i think they will on vanessa error
is he better than mysunshine one?
what about Fudou
Lol
how are you holdin up?
Lol solo
🤔
now i'm thinking, what fine did when she possessed Caesar?
exactlty
i think they just didn't check before putting the anime in 2045
well it's nothing major
:/
lmao
check the 2045 one
don'0t.
eeeh no please.
it's true, he can still do that
Lol true
and taking direct control of SONG
like firing Genjurou
i expected something else
fudou turning on us
but let's say i absolutely didn't expect
before putting his honor down
he would commit seppuku
to redempt
Fudou he's not the type of person
i'm laughing at both jokes
LOL
Yeah.
in mid air.
MAN
In MID AIR
*twin buster rifle hatsudou!*
that's overkill
LOL
yes
70k and counting they said
for his goal
he sacrificed 70k lifes
and let's not forget
https://puu.sh/DVgbl/de8faead68.png
Basa is back to square one
for it
Regarding Fudou i repeat: he's probably got sick that he can't accomplish japan greatness with SONG ideals and had to use pavarian illuminati
i was talking about the old fudou
not basa
heh
after your favourite kazanari member turning on us
how are you holding up pats?
Los Alamos
the point is that USA doesn't know who exactly raided
There was that proud talk
and Vanessa taking advantage of the situation
and yeah i wouldn't overlook a possible major clash with USA
for japan
Well he stated that divine power is needed
not being animated
hm?
during the 80s
the police
they used to provoke
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C5%8Ds%C5%8Dzoku
if someone wonders they do exist
with the bosozoku gang was hilarious
THe part
i was getting overbored by the usual sword and whip ones
of noises
and finally new types
guys, damn post it here when it gets completed.
woh
444
😂
it's important.
Please people, PIN IT to the channel
UH
H
UH
But yeah again
i can't retort there
okay
and it was in USA first
worked
what? FIS was the project where Nastassja, Ver and Ryouko
before JP
worked with USA
And FIS
yeah rofl
*here take this pretty relic, you will become THE HERO*
Newborn gift
hah
that would make sense
i estimate something like 30-35 years old?
i doubt he's over 40 years old
Ver is not THAT old
Hold on
i'm pretty sure it's written in the reports
and Fudou knows that Bikki and Miku got no original sin
armados?
WHat are you talking about
*overpredict*
!
so bikki and miku can use it
true ture the bracelet is divine power in theory
that that that
LOL
no one knows about his masterplan
Bikki's henshin
YOU WANT TO KILL ME?
FALLING THROUGH THE SKY EMBRACING SHIRABE
kirichaaaan
for those uncultured people
there was the HSS Uncultured once
.
^
you got turned down by those just rewriting the ground?
they were awesome
i loved the "Funnel like" things
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
it is a wild recall from G
the bang.
but shirabe's one was the problematic part
true too
yeah
following Shirabe
I felt that the camera had problems
LOL
Bikki one is my least favourited
Shirabe yoyo master did a show
But let's say that chris's one is the greatest
*socks coughs*
KIRI's ONE
Bikki one is the simplest one
they're all very very awesome
Look i'm so much in conflict
no thanks
god
LOL
high quality animations everywhere
when she jumped
anyways did someone notice the amount of budget in Kirichan on the swing?
please chris
LOL
please.
NO
PLEASE PUT IT IN THE SLOT THINGY
BEST CHART
since she's activated it in s1 and G while thinking as a sword
look i don't think *Heaven rend will fail
lolol
I DIDN'T THINK THROUGH THAT
OH
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
is next
momria
yyy
LOL
modified by alchemy
she's still human
Camera didn't do justice to Chris and Shirabe
Just wait for basa to do her Sword plays
yes
but i agree it has effect.
was the simplest one
isn't that a fail like carol's system?
they use blood as fuel
jokes aside i wonder now
i'm 0-
Negative is rare
like 0+ or 0-
of the blood
the RH is the positiviness or the negativeness
system
45 types
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_blood_group_system
it is
no no
what was again?
she's a vampire!
Blood 😄
(no i'm not going)
night anyways
your house
you're going to dream about millarc raiding
sleeping
have fun
Lol
😂
those
oh lol
a tokusatsu?
shielding the damage
the Gear acts as a power armor
i know poi
why this pessimism now??
yeh
with broken spine and ribs
a normal person would have died
that was pretty powerful
Shirabe tanked
what about the rocket punch
zetsubou
MOAR
Need more
and anyways they said that basa brainwaves are not normal right now
*more suffering*
i will laugh
if she catches bikki off guard
It didn't work just because the momentum was bad
ignite is no more
right now
that Bikki is on the same power level of millarc
it showed clearly
and i agree about the new module
oh XV emotes will be needed
that
was great this time around
Shirabe outfit
~~starcaster wwhere~~
DESStiny
~~fine ~~
10/10
"she will show up at the hospital"
Kirika called millarc
?
I WILL SUPPLY YOU WITH LINKER
GO MAN
Evil <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Lol
they're one.
EXACTLY
Chris > Kirika = Shirabe > Hibiki
lol
but i got no ninja skills
Would be cool working with ogawa
poster when?
SONG recruit
every time
and update the pinned post
i think we should pin that pic
YEAH
GOD
so it's over-legit.
are man made
Well alca noises
HAH THAT
*looks at perfect cell*
that's why he's been discarded
he's too much perfect
were the leads of the pavarian illuminati
so i take as St germain and friends + adam
was the perfect one
i mean philosopher's stone
yes
i tought it was just for show
HAH
REALLY
IT'S Thirteen?
REALLY?
https://puu.sh/DVjhM/ff83f85d55.png
THIS
I'M NOW UNDERSTANDING
HOLD ON
it happened me once
OH GOD
like that.
yes but not
DESS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMl3t0grrRA
huh solo?
still going berserk about fudou
Chris revolver ocelot confirmed
FUNNELS
the
god
god god
gn poi
Lol
2) it's not the blu ray
1) Camera failed
i think there are 2 factors
regarding chris
the funnels ❤
YEAH
but but, saviour of japan, but but tenka fubu, but but divine power
or :fudou:
:millarc: when
for sure
not in a school dorm
live in an apartment
ehm, she and miku
filled with cool furniture
just think at Chris's house
they're damn SONG employees
They get paid in a good amount
that slipped out of hand after fudou
uh
Oh that's for sure
Fanservice character doesn't mean bad
Ice skatiiing
Yo yo master
❤
the true callback from freaking g
*bang*
sieg zeon
You want to kill me?
AAAA
gotta find an empty and calm day
don't remind me that
HG sazabi
i still have to build
+1
if chris starts using funnels i will go nuts
now that i think of it
oh god
THE FUNNELS
but but
^
and no that's not a pun.
look there's a lot of noise during the transformation on the screen
no it's just about the colors
without color dimming
but i think that chris's one will shine ALOT more in the BD
Shirabe's one too needed to slow
yeah it is advanced science
Well yeah, chris sync with the lyrics was godlike
let me say that
with modelling
you're a god
well Apocrypha has problems because higashide has written it
honestly apo did a mess there
not the same heroic spirit.
there's Vlad the impaler and Vlad the vampire
i don't think vlad works like that
uhm solo
i expect A LOT from fudou now
getting back on track
anyways ye got what you mean
*Vanessa intensifies*
ARA ARA?
Did somebody say
She was landing
imagine the shock when gen and family get to know he was the real mastermind that caused 70k+ deaths
i'm more than satisfied with fudou plottwist
lol
(eliza is too qt)
vilimi is pretty easy to reawaken hype in these situations
circling around kirichan
noise
Banana
this episode slapped him in the eye
a friend of mine told me "Bruh, they're using AXZ and GX noises"
HAH
i went in overhype
Top grandad did a stunt this time
officer momria
THAT profilepic
gotcha
HAH
&knuckles?
oh god
>one of the reasons why i wont hate ver
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6pUTyd_0aQ
never EVER forget guys
would be so cool seeing sheshoujing again
D:
OH
is true i will seriously hands up
of basa being a vessel for fudou's plans
god if the theory
breakthrough! kaneko ripped solo's fanfic
then solo will say i give him too much credit
guys stop bringing me these memories
SUSANOO PART
THE
Solo's Fudou was a mastermind too but i don't think he reachs a level of the canon fudou at this point
so 1 year actually
gotta admit i didn't pay attention for some months
wow the time passes so fast
So yeah i'm a member of this discord since september 2017
just the year and the month
i do not need the exact date
of AXZ air?
wait when did last episode
1 year and a half here
what i've just read.
THE FEMALE FORM THEORY
OH GOD
well i didn't know about this guy
and surpassed fine millenial plan?
Fudou masterminded the whole plot
So
i missed something ?
what theory
Yeah Fine used shock theraphy on Chris
it EATS human cells like a cancer
EEEH nehushtan has a too much huge backfire
i forgot
Oh true
they damaged it
why?
and i don't think that it would have beaten carol
halfway
Tiki broke her ascension
*wasn't really complete*
Well that divine weapon
ta-daan
Let's just upgrade her faust robes like that!
would be nearly unbeatable
Carol with philosopher's stone
Carol flaw is her fuel
And yes i think that carol was much more powerful than Adam
Adam wasn't an alchemist
Well you know when you pratice alchemy for over a millenia
Yes
they helped carol, carol shared knowledge
i think of it as an exchange
in the show
She was a *step*
they use her theories as a base
she was the foundation for the WHOLE pavarian illuminati alchemists
Well hold up, no Alca noise if Carol doesn't show up
:again:
Oh now i feel i ruined the discussion
LoGiC
Fine loves god -> makes gears -> Ver UNDERSTANDS love -> Ver makes linker to get gears working
well today i discovered the thruth
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
he's too much iconic
i bet on it.
I bet that Ver will get another short scene in someone's memory
sugita
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
than elf9
i still think carol would be a much better character
carol fixing the 3 idiots
Lol that would be awesome
no well i'm joking here
ez
7 Billion Zesshou -> Fudou loses
in the end i know it, Elfnein will start actually singing Genocide&Genocide with carol taking over
that's true
uhm
>overkill
JUST THINK IF SHENSHOUJING HESHIN MADE IT TO XV
same
and V sign
THAT RED FRINGE
Millarc red fringe
Well i like the concept of the whole trio
YES?
Then we get carol singing
lol
ll
*donutting intensifies*
Same
i hope she stays like that
Millarc is *legit* evil
*bam*
We are weaker than you so *we are not afraid of doing this*
Nice!
😄
<@!102691114762371072> i expect Vanessa, Eliza and Millarc emotes when XV ends
!
!
SHE'S AN HOMUNCULUS
ELF 9 DOESN'T HAVE ORIGINAL SIN
HOLD THE WRECK ON
they could just let elf9 make a faust robe for herself
At this point
well hands up
it was just an oneshot
I don't think Gears can channel alchemy now
Fair enough
Dainsleif was sacrificed to reduce the toxic backfire
Golden thingy is freaking Toxic
Don't forget that
X drive would have beaten adam
since Bikki converted fucking alchemic power there
i think they're not on the same level
^
since he couldn't use cryosopeia during divine thingy
that Adam had fuel too
It was left believing us
That hat is more a meme than ver
HAT
THE
he would have done that during the assault then
Carol can just evade it
i don't think Cryosopeia as a winning card
now that i think of it, would shenshoujing erase Faust Robes?
cannot win vs Carol
adam without divine power
In any case
like bikki
Yeah
(for more than 1 reason)
for a reason
True
and i doubt Vanessa didn't get spotted
you never knpow
FIS worked in USA before
on Los alamos attack
it's hard to believe murica will not retaliate
what do you think trump will do his thing again?
he did what he did for a reason
to hate basa
Well yatsuhiro had no real true reason
i don't follow you on this point guys?
Uh
he could manipulate song on his hands to get it even closer to his goal
so he can take over song
And i still expect genjurou to get fired
i think
that was not enough
hmm
but damn it was a shockl
like a glove
he fits the role
in the end i'm happy with fudou being a villain
LOL
and to suffer
where bikki doesn't have to fight
with godly powers
like let her believe she can create a better world
~~he will kidnap miku and convince her ~~ <:Ver:336656981144109066>
he has original sin
i got a bit confused
ok
you mean
oh Ama no Murakumo
LOL
i bet he can beat millarc 1v1
and don't give me the excuse "he's become old and rusty"
otherwise he's flawed.
but with swords
i think he should be as much powerful as gen
i bet he's even better than Basa
and fudou DOES know sword play
towards them
depends if fudou acts like a dick
hmmm
:insertnobunaga:
TENKA FUBU WHERE
IMPERIALISM
BUT BUT
~~Chaotic Good ~~
!
He did it for the sake of japan
+1
Solid theory
in the end
i think that fudou will get burned
Lol
Lmao
"Magical girl incident"
Hey hey
genocide&genocide'd
they got deleted there
and the hero saved those 2 with noises
What about when they ganked nastassja and maria
Lol true
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so true
Human no more
When that happened
Ver was a relic fused specimen
!
let's just use antilinker to nerf divine power
and did what he did
and in the end the madman slipped out of his hands
then we discover that Fudou manipulated Ver
in b4 ep 4 thing to look forward was ver reappearance
<:Ver:336656981144109066> style melua?
or will hold it back
Kaneko will be able to surpass sparkle and solo level of despair
the point is if
zetsubouuu
Y i guess
It was cool and all but it would be rendundant
No ignite plz
Wut u talking about
(it would have sounded so bad, ver helping song)
She kinda deserves a bit of spotlight, otherwise i would have preferred having the madman helping SONG instead of her, it's a wasted character like this
to elfnein
a faust robe
i hope the will give
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
WHERE IS MY ELF9 SINGING RURURIRA
*holds his breath*
uuuh
tho if he keeps doing things like this he's more Neutral Evil
doesn't necessarily mean you stray from the alignment
and doing things under the rug
because he acts like a tyrant and follows a "code"
fits him
Yeah Lawful Evil
In the end he stands for his principles
Ver is more chaotic neutral
hmmm why tho
what do you think guys, Fudou is Chaotic or Lawful?
the other time with some friends
I was having a discussion
Hmmmm
hmmm Fudou evil?^
we will discover the freaking "Aoi yuuki fav ep"
tomorrow EX VI
COME ON PEOPLE
they're a bit more rare than the rest
do you have some cool art regarding caroru to share?
oh <@!263983345669505025> i was wondering
it's precious.
and updated every time
that chart must be pinned
*shivers* what the reaction pic will be today?
Lol
<@139432096023183360> elf9 faust robes when
her vocal range and singing skills
aoi yuuki it's absurd
Oh well oh well oh well
but gekisou gungnir is special.
both versions are great to me
but some aren't
is great
Like ignited gbeat
not all of them sound good
that's why i said it's a double edged sword
uuuuuh
and genocide...
since that song is *very* solemn
it could have sounded badly
but at the same time it's a double edged sword
if that was a thing
you will kill me before destroying the actual planet
oh god
i still think that Shirabe was not that wrong in giving bikki an hypocrite
yeah
i've said this before, think carol with phylosopher's stone
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
RURURIRA
ooooh i like that part, get your hypocrisy down your throat bikki
i mean Carol could have overpowered Adam blindly
too much powerful
carol helping song would have been plotbreaking
but if you think of that
and i still can't get over it
when we got Elf9 instead of carol
this is why i got triggered
i rewatched GX recently and i still gets chills down my spine when she actually starts singing
is my fav gear song
to me, senkin daurudabura
yeah please
woh
FREEZE THE SUN
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2FkFf5G_Sw
RURURIRA
today episode, hype
legit
i know that feel
this will end badly
HAH
i just watched the episode
OH DEAR
lol that
Fudou is insanely strong
and let's remember millarc broke a WHOLE PILLAR
HE RESTRAINED MILLARC
talking about fudou
fudou should be the same
Yes
i will just jinx it, Fudou will use Miku to control Divine bracelet
MIKU IS UNDEFENDED RIGHT NOW
AND OI SOLO
like 5 eps sooner
this time the series is going wild pretty early
Yes
Could be
Yea
Tsubasa will side with fudou
and i agree with him
i bet solo predicted it
You know?
even Vanessa
they seem wonderful characters
and i'm loving the trio so much
anyways i loved the concept
true true
oh the explosion
Lol
YET HOW DID THEY MET THAT FAST?
YES
380k yep sorry
lol
they've met eachother too fast
but
let me say that
the concept is amazing
3800 KM
what about daedalus end?
OH
and he's doing that by force
10/10
"Fudou will take over"
WHAT DID I SAY LAST TIME SOLO?
AND I'M SO FREAKING HAPPY
FUDOU DID IT
BUT
the excuse sounds a bit weak
it's wonderful but i didn't like the amalgam that much
for elf9???
freaking Faust robe set
can i get freak
Wait if they are using faust robes + gears combined
what about fudou being strong enough to hold millarc back
anyways yea
Lol melua
but i repeat, i will swallow it, i liked fudou masterplan too much
until now
*season
the scene was the weakest spot of the series
let's say that apart from the coolness of the concept
i didn't like that too
eh
golden armor
rofl
<@279341087494242304> kusanagi fudou where
uh lol
carol nein is legit
But i will swallow it since fudou did such a beautiful number on them
and explain it better
Elfnein please try harder
but the explanation is kinda poor right now
Yeah it was awesome
let me say that i don't like that much right now what happened there
and Amalgam ruined my fun
laby
it's a phylosophical
but
EEEH
he took over SONG hq to stop the fight
after using them
and that confirms he's lawful evil, he didn't abandon the trio
i appreciate characters like that
Fudou got his plan straight in action
i'm so happy that
*coughs*
would be so similar to a certain fanfic
he's sasaki kojirou too in fate
Yes he did
Lol
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
momriaaaa
++
Anyways LET'S TALK HOW PRETTY WAS MARIA TRANSFORMATION
you wish <@115583025177296901> uh
at that
i would laugh so hard
LOL
for the others
then we get <:Ver:336656981144109066>
hah
this kind of highlight is often reserved to episode 9
so early in the series
anyways i'm fine that we got this much plot develpment
LMAO
~~ in the end solo, kaneko did it, this plan goes near your fudou ~~
as terrorists if they defect
they will be treated
yeah
*rururira*
so carol can take over!1!!
give her a faust robe already
of the phenomena
explanation
as i've said elfnein gave a pretty weak
it's not like XD that needs phonic gain
it seemed something got triggered
hmmm i don't think so
Lol saint seya'd
she even refused the karaoke night
actually let me say that it feels so much well done the part regarding the mental regression on basa
Oh that
in a *saberlike* fashion
and yeah bikki gulped those down
that will kill them
from the trio
THe problem with the labyrinth is that needs so much power output
Lol solo i agree
mines and *boom*
RIGHT <@279341087494242304> this is how you blast away the gears while singing
IT FELT SO GOOD
the reaction count there went wild
count there
The reaction
the batarang made me lol
but i believe that she will side with fudou at least for now
a double betrayal would be overkill
<@279341087494242304> woah that's a longshot
miku is on the slim side
It's so glorious, it's just getting better
Reaction pic
The almighty
Oh god
They don't
will be pretty high
I think the suffering
~~ in truth is because XV fudou is approaching solo's fudou ~~
are you turned down solo?
10/10 best scene of the episode after fudou takeover
killed me
AND BIKKI STARTING TO SING and getting interrupted by the mines
she's back to being a sword right now
heh
10/10
Basa will side with fudou
and remember my words from yesterday evening
yeah
if you take a look at the frame they have golden things too
it's clearly showed that the others can activate amalgam as well
no
and i feel sorry for them knowing their aim
the trio is just too much likeable
my fav parts 
- fudou
- maria transformation
- Noble red trio
- Daedalus end

my "meh they could have done better" parts:
- elfnein poor explanation
- amalgam is poorly explained (2 points in 1)
- the others watching bikki without moving
he's doing too good
but i'm so hyped by fudou masterplan
it does
YES
gg
fudou + kusanagi
<@279341087494242304> kusanagi
oF THE INFAMOUS 3 FRAME THING EDIT?
IS THAT THE SEQUEL
LOL
to break a pillar
and millarc is so much powerful
with ONE HAND
but he blocks millarc
he's better
since plot twists
i'm liking fudou a lot this time around
as the coolest
but i see her siding with fudou
of course i do
hands up in that case
during the dedalus end scene
take point that basa didn't speak
on her
and Millarc did lock the emotional state or something
she reverted back
<@139432096023183360> while tsubasa turning point in s4 was true
rururira!
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
remember that she's there because my favourite caroru died!
IN THAT CASE I WOULD BE HAPPY
^
than bikki
yeah but miku is more reachable
but that's all
let's say that there is a chance
Gen can't omit stuff from reports
he does
i'm pretty sure
-> rururira
-> elfnein with faust robe
eh
Since miku has no original sin
to force miku into wearing the relic
if fudou uses his authority
but she can't be protected
AND FUDOU HAS THE BRACELET!
MIKU IS ALONE NOW
rakhi
i don't think it in that way
if they oppose fudou
and they wont be able to say anything since they will become terrorists
and they will discover
well that's a turn down
it is fictional
failing at search
oh then it wasn't me
Actually fudou being susano'o would work too much well
and has kusanagi hidden somewhere
HEH FUDOU IS SECRETLY SUSANO'O
was overkill
and daedalus end being 380k km wide
but yeah i'm fine in the end with the current episode
that's lame
LOL
Create an history with the light god could not know
is the sentence that leads XV
well the problem there solo
Lol
TONY GLAZER
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
So, Ver flashback this season when guys?
Fudou power level is higher than gen
don't forget
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/j1WRqohKrVCfMT7vFTAX7UZTcDtrmVSbqoKEq0ABFjc/https/media.discordapp.net/attachments/336310266654490624/603309752277008384/noise_pose.gif
I MEAN REALLY? HAH
are possible!
for chris
so Heart powered rockets
true
np
that was too fast, i didn't eve click
10/10
and the other is blowing up by using the relic
the gaijin with st germain on his back
please notice
IT'S CULTURE
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431914167826382860/604791584394838047/HJhag6I.png
ofc
OFC
he's chaotic evil
Solo links forbidden thing
https://symphogear-fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Goten_Kawakaze LOL WHAT IS DOING IZAYOI SAKAMAKI UNDER COVERE HERE
*takes radiation hazard suit*
lol link the fanon
what edit was it ?
lmao
i'm sure i'm forgetting something here
again??
WHAT WAS CELESTIAL MUDGUARDS
what anime
it's like tsukihime anime
LOL
~~heavenrend~~
yeah
that went around fucking women and shooting lightining
we tought that there was an elder person on mount olympus
well european mythology is less chuuni than asian one
and both sons
are both weapons
Shul shagana and igalima
x_x
*bow overload* but yeah let's use a non existent one of course!
https://puu.sh/DYkLA/55f557e6cb.png
which is STILL  EUROPEAN
THere is artemis bow
or hey
Arash bow solo <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Yeah those don't
in the mythology
I'm sure there is some kind of bow
She will side with fudou
**7 billion zesshou**
when we can have
about bikki power ups
who cares
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
yes please make her suffer
golden stuff was on the other gears too
no it's not only her
with bikki
that means that fudou can stall a 1v1 brute force contest
by force
blocking millarc
i'm still fixated at fudou
legit
heh
^
he should be
so i get both good subs and hype
with good subs
to rewatch it
That doesn't prevent me
you miss the early hype if you take too much
you're late to the party
oh hello
i surely didn't expect someone to make a fanon based on one of my favourite anime character which is izayoi
lmao
those are the waste produced by brainstorming
hah
i'm joking
in SONG
void of the original sin
there's a THIRD PERSON
guys don't forget
and anyways
solo chaotic evil confirmed
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
the divine power
well fudou needs to activate
70k victims
you know
millarc like that
you can't just redeem
we will see
if she does
and i WILL GET ANGRY
she will agree
it doesn't mean
on their objective
and *again* Vanessa clearly stated they can't back down
and it's clear that Fudou didn't abandon them yet
Noble red is still under Fudou orders
No
*enough gimme a relic!*
but i am an exception.
knowing myself
i would rejoyce from such thing
if that happens
i think someone in this discord would go on rampage
LOL
saved the situation
but our *shinjitsu no hito*
She actually did it
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT BETTER
they can't back down
and Vanessa clearly stated
Friendship route was blocked for carol
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
~~carol~~
~~fine ~~
aww i'm liking the trio too much
didn't get damaged by the explosion
and the noble red trio
he was next to it
he was not on the fire
10/10
about that solo, i feel the same, but it was still great
*thanks*
if you don't mind
so i wont lose it
<@139432096023183360> send it in mp
i'm literally shivering as i watch the duet
I think i do have to watch the live
and thanks
the link, don't worry
it worked
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
give me a video of the duet please
hmm i ask the men of culture right here
since it's an order from fudou
and Bikki wont able to stop her this time
Miku is the most possible candidate
oh i agree on that
Get kanekoed
Divine power goes boom only on Sinful people
that's stretching logic man
but carol body was artificial made too
i guess the same
^
she cloned herself, remember?
was artificial too
Carol's body
look at tiki, look at adam
and artificial made being CAN weild divine power too
she's an homunculus
she's not an human
exactly
^
if millarc tries to redeem
yeah basa would go on rampage
now now i think i will go watch the other stuff that aired yesterday, cya later
inside the laby is mentioned
the "monster"
no no
bikki saved the situation with golden faust robe fusion
would have killed the gears
well i think that another shot
they were clearly dying inside by blood corruption
and i think the reason of "no minotaur" is that noble red could not mantain the output from long
^
*track and field*
Miku IS a fit person
well as long as we know
OH TRUE
do we have a screen? i forgot that
what
uhm?
LOL
Yes but that doesn't cancel your divine rank
itself
the susano'o was a godly being
speaking of which
~~Fudou, susano'o where ~~
than gen
I think he's more powerful
and Millarc was on the same power level of bikki
Millarc is weaker than fudou in brute strenght
now
Right nosw
Lol
not even rockets fly that straight for that distance
DAMN THAT THROW
since they can't get to their goal otherwise
i'm not sure if i expect Noble red going against fudou
that will accept just to avoid bikki using it
and miku is the kind of person
from forcing miku into divine bracelet
and nothing stops fudou
remember lily white that now miku is defensless
only those?
exactly
Yes
since she's back to being a sword
and basa will just side alongside fudou
Fudou holds authority that can't be overstepped
like the others
Gen can just submit
was dope
where millarc rotated her head like that
OH dear that scene
to advance
Until now fudou used the law
fudou is too much lawful evil  to kill his underlings randomly
hmm you think?
miku will do that role
he's still a sinner
Fudou will not use the brace
LOL
the whole trio a lot
i'm liking
at that point
that would be a stretch, i would NEED an explanation
it would have been a good explanation if bikki still had kanade fragment
not kanade one
is that bikki is using maria's fragment
the problem with that
you know
yeah
meh
that would be an extreme disappointment
to fix basa mind
that no kanade flashback appears
do hope
oh i SERIOUSLY
rofl
don't worry
i'm joking of course
so wfc, is the thing still valid, no poking if kanade appears? <:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202>
Yeah something like that
LOL
<@279341087494242304> if gear was a VN: Choice to side with fudou where
!
and today is no kanaday
lol wfc
I hope it will be the greatest at this point
went wild
Lol the reaction count yesterday
and IT'S NOT EVEN THE BD
animation level >9K
but it was very well done, let me say that
yes it wasn't
THAT FRAME
burned in green fire
since Even carol body
nothing weird
no guys
they were just underlings in the organization
don't forget that
The trio is flawed
well brb lunch people
380k km
seriously 10/10
i loved that thing
!
DAEDALUS ENDO
so yeah my theory would be pretty logical too
well it is a philosophical weapon
whatever fragment it is
as a whole
is Gungnir taking a link to the souls of the users
The only logical thing i see it working
heh
it was bad this time around
*hands down*
sorry
Ok
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and that leads to some risks
Kanade you know better than me that's a stretch too
This is when the fanbase is dedicated enough
THanks for your hard work YT
YTT ❤
^ x2
^
in that scene
i felt so much satisfaction
a lot
THat part made me laugh too
the worst of the worst
>still angry that he made bikki pay at the restaurant
his arc was such a turn down
yeah i tought the same
topdad in XV y/n
what do you think peeps
and cooler
she's become prettier come on
❤
millaaarc
just ordering her is enough
to be kidnapped
she doesn't even need
great scene
i agree
as far as we know fudou has the authority to butt in and put himself in charge
it's japanese government
Gen is just getting replaced with Fudou direct control
they will shut down SONG
I really doubt
yeah probably
please take a better look at the scene, it's clearly showed on the basa frame that everyone has those
the others already have it
no
that's why i mentioned the thing
i know
on that kind of belief
there are several instances
pharaoh was son of a sun god
believed that their
since even ancient egypt people
you come to conclusion that ALL the humans are the same
If you think at that
and actually
oooh
and checking the sources and the historical facts it's always fun
in fiction
Heh i like when history is involved
Holy roman empire was big
expecially at that time
even Austria
so she could be from various places in central europe
tho
HRE was huge
to not be from actual germany
Well it's too much germanish
it all comes up in circles
so prelati should have visited the place at least once
oh god gilles de rais was there
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Tiffauges
is the chateau of tiffages
Oh i think the reason for carol
poor aoi
karoshi (death by overwork), every society has the bad side of the coin
Lmao
Guys somebody here has Tump - abe Real life - XV comparison screen^?
10/10
oh that Elza artwork
It can't just be 4 fun that they're showing us operational statuses
Eh there must be a reason
YeAh
System thingy
I will be disappointed if they waste
Can't wait for tomorrow
Hype
Oooooh
Lmao
And fudou best villain so far
*high expectations*
I'm just loving the trio
Being bikki there
What abou bikki
Hypeeee
Oooh we will get the new song leader
Siding with topgrandad 10/10
Back to s1
Gimme her baaack
Aaaa caroruuuu
Or screentime
At bikki trying to make friends
I'm pretty angry
Fudou will randomly backstack noble red tho
I don't think
I can already see millarc going berserk if something happens
Gear + faust robe
Y
Can appear
No i still think that only the pavarian leader trio
And elf9 faust robes where
Elf9 explanation was weak
For now i want to see what use they make of amalgam
the full is amazing
oh god
my bad there
yeah rofl
31.7
yeah i'm dumb
the full?
oh is it out?
Can't wait the full version
*FAIAH*
*faiah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VErsnEChSsU
And the song is amazing by itself
is amazing
"go ahead" of maria's new song
The part
Kusanagi where
topgrandad is what really counts
i expect something funny here
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/431914167826382860/606789242714193945/unknown.png
remember guys
that fudou will put in song
the smugface
I'm eager to see
YTT fixed the term
it's not soilll
yeah
like me
4 hours for sub plebs
*kusanagi*
ah ok
yeah
yeah i will hide it too
:surrenders:
Fair enough
the heck is come on
but it just sounds bad if you say "RH Soil"
yeah saying it's fixed is a stretch
*all hail ytt*
sorry
ah i see
WAS PURE GOLD
That damn henshin
<@279341087494242304> KUSANAGI WHERE
!
THE BRACELET INTO A SWORD
FUDOU ASKED TO REFORGE
OH AND
hands up
let me say that
That means Noble red digging their own grave
you say i'm overthinking?
to be the guy
hmmm it's too easy
or elfnein got hit
but i believe that bikki butted in
I don't think that any of the mcs will die
and following blindly the law and her sakimori code
basa being full Lawful
that was GREAT
*now i wait for nana song release*
it still doesn't feel right for noble red backstabbing fudou in this exact point of the plot
10/10 GLORIOUS
DURING THE BATH
OH AND MIKU DOING CHOSSEI
:Sad:
i'm late to the hype trainnn
hands up
in rome
oh and did somebody notice that noble red escaped from the freaking actual colosseum?
come on.
the sack of blood squished?
Wot one?
And god i like the trio even more now that we got Vanessa's flashback
He's doing his fair part in the deal
to backstab fudou
Noble red got no reason
until now
than S1
but yeah basa is an even worse state
this episode was so much great
good stuff good stuff definitely
and we got elfnein singing
Chateau of tiffages best hideout
so what else
got decapitated
or the Smugface
and got hit
something tells me that Bikki got in the way
And i don't really think miku got hit by Millarc
her song was maybe one the bests
10/10 suffering
10/10 song
10/10 scene
Basa is literally *not okay*
THE HECK I JUST WATCHED
'm HERE
OK
OK
i can easily see Kusanagi there
Regarding the vambrace turning into a sword
to RURURIRA
and her singing in the episode was a prelude
in b4 faust robe brainwashed elfnein
Fudou knows who miku is
if Fudou is involved
Joe the cards are much different
but a divine relic
it's not a normal relic we are talking here
and give divine power to her
no that means she can abduct miku
Yeah
to kill the failure
the only possibility is that Fudou Gave out the order
Killing the smugface would produce no results
I still don't see why they should do that IN THIS PRECISE point of the plot
we saw a fountain of blood
we didn't see *any* head flying
bikki i'd say
hands up
we will see in next week
could be, could be not
people here say i'm overthinking about saying that is not the smugface that has been killed
Yeah that cliffhanger
the gaijin reaction!
PEOPLE GIVE ME THE REACTION PIC
RIGHT
I WAS FORGETTING
Damn basa is just stunning during that henshin <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
sorry there
yeah i'm dumb
<@155150213445582850> giff link
the henshin
Did crunchy already upload it?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
100/100
for my eyes
^
since we are not into kaneko's mind
everything should be taken with a grain of salt
it's the weird part
Yeah i agree with that joe
wield*
And nothing said that Elfnein can't weild the vambrace
it still needs the "No original sin" clause
even if they manage to reforge the gauntlet
divine power miku is still a possibility
you should stop yeah.
what are you drinking man?
LOL
like the requirement for the event "betray fudou" doesn't have enough Betray Points yet
"not enough"
it just feels like
were wrong joe
I didn't say your points
no one said i'm right lol
yeah chill out i'm just saying  my hypothesis
Fudou wants the power to restore japan glory
out of nowhere
i feel fudou is too much lawful to do that
it could do both the things.
who said that Divine power is single use?
As i said we will see i leave my bet there
was evacuated
The area
to spoil the plans
millarc doesn't have any reasons
solo?
did you like the amount of *suffering* with basa
This
^
just low ranked members
they're both the things
and i doubt that miku "no original sin" isn't written therte
into the reports
joe kamakura has the authority to look
again kusanagi fudou is behind the corner, he will strike first!
don't mention it
it's the japanese word
Guardian
she believes she's a 100% sakimori
and add fuel to the fire
Yeah
no kanade shenanigans again,  i just ask this
hm
i'm failing to follow your point
what do you mean melua?
it's like she never said that sentence
with the mindset reset
anymore
that doesn't count
Lawful to the core
yEAH
NOTHING stops her from betraying song and siding with *topgrandad*
and if Tsubasa follows Japan Government blindly
she's even worse than s1
let's say
this is my theory
so of course the song should be connected!
reference is because basa reverted back to her old mindset
the Zettou ame no habakiri
Anwyays
all hail the little vampire
about the iaido part
i still have chills
But yeah maybe Basa henshin is the best of the season
heh
out of rage
i couldn't point it out what it seemed like
thanks for making clear space in my mind
OH THAT WAS KYOGRE
i've ever heard
one of the best songs from nana
not even like, i'm just IN HEAVEN
THE NEW SONG
I LOVE
go get it and make a pendant
!
you might have thrown out a relic
are you sure that wine bottle wasn't a relic?
oh the wine
Lol
Yeah i guess the hype carried me away
well i'm sorry if i stirred up someone today, i didn't want to flare up a discussion
that entry
it's the hole carol made
remember that there was the same structure at kadingir
i don't think it's getting rebuilt
he can't really overstep
Yatsuhiro knows his place
nah it isn't
Lmao
i can go to bed happily when i get it
the gaijins!
REACTION PIC WHERE?
Guys
the scene gets us distracted from the lyrics too much
uh that's true
*CHOSSEI*
lol
Oh
outspeeded
it was a karaoke
Could be.
Elf9 song was very very good
gosh that's true
to get angry like that
it does but still it's not usual for miku
she could end into not being able to say sorry
a flag has been raised!
yeah and OMG that's a FLAG
it shocked me a bit
like that during the karaoke
miku getting worked up
oh and i didn't expect
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
you just pray for miku to dive deep into suffering, solo
oh you used sentinel that's true
checking on /a/ no gaijin yet this time it seems
true lol
wait what
i either missed it or we got none
no anyways i was referring to the gaijin reaction pic
oh sad
D:
but but where is my reaction pic
to appreciate the culture || https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdajEqLCmnY ||
let's take another moment
YTT is life tho
lol first pic
Oh
what about that screen?
uhm
poor basa
is a godsend
from basa
That precise frame
did you notice the flying kyogre
look continuing at this pace, we could do "Sinfogia reactions: Weekly interview with AKEupho" <:Ver:336656981144109066>
*freaking IAIDO*
of basa henshin?
what do you think
yeah
i think it's one of the spots where she really shines
even if basa doesn't deserve suffering
that was kirika being kirika
yeah
^
now the next step: Rururira and genocide
Finally she sang
.
BASA?
DID YOU APPRECIATE
HAH
Kaneko masterplanning in a *weird* way
oh dear
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Noble red is ketchup dependant!
KETCHUP
no it's
with the gaijin reaction pic <@185949743321579520>
THE CULTURE
THANK YOU, you've brought
LOL
WHAT
A Razor
hah oke don't worry
lol
resemblance of the huge noise
LOL
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
in suffering
tsubasa really shines
not please
Carol took over
Rururira
I still hold my doubts about smugface dying
*into a sword*
Reforging a bracelet
Kusanagi ep 6
it's not symphogear without it!
of course it is
and bikki with inori minase just doesn't work
for one of the geahs
her voice is too much powerful
50/50
best geah song
what a beautiful voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2FkFf5G_Sw
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Lmao
To *freeze the sun*
Lol
on the other side
|| meanwhile freaking susanoo was going berserk ||
Yeah SURE
when they mentioned that
I freaking knew you would show up
HAH
of course is not the most "zetsubouish" anime on the market
that gear doesn't have suffering
Well it's not right to say
"the fun has not ended"
the anime hints a bit in that direction
yeah i imagined that
it's great
i loved the anime adaptation
houseki no kuni ❤
that's why we got masters of suffering writing fanfics!
another man of culture
after all miku did quote sakura
no you're legit
HAH
and alchemical technology lost
i can still see XV ending with all the gears destroyed
that would be evil
only if they give kusanagi to fudou
I'm in it
it's weird
Lol
whereee
eiai promiseee
didn't die
i'm still sure that the smug face
if elf9 looks like that
something bad will happen
OH DEAR
(that's if they don't release more content)
as i said, i think it will be the community job to keep the thing alive after sinfogia ends
:hype:
tomorrow episode!
Lol the blaster
*kusanagi when*
Fudou is strong too
after the cliffhanger
to really predict what will happen
There are too many flags
yeah
at will if needed
he can overrule parliament and mobilize army
Lol
it's at the same level of our head of state
well that's kamakura political power for you
oh the law
i don't think she will side with bikki that easily
in the screenshot
seems pretty sure of what she's doing
Vanessa
need more sugita
where is ver flashback where they quote how nephilim controlled chateau
it's not a lost cause
to revive her
kamakura *forcing* the relic on her
you can still expect
Lol come on solo
that the smugface is not the one that gets hit
i'm sure at this point
save miku, make bikki happy and save topgrandad plan
Two birds, one stone
by forcing the relic on her
Miku can be saved
nana ❤
Amenohabakiri!
it appeared in the giant screen at the base
yeah
that kills me over and over
ICHIIBAL
i even tought it was a your thing joe
nooo
AME NO HEAVENREND
10/10
LMAO
expecially in certain parts like 1.20
is insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ1nbX3suts i was re-listening this, damn the guitar work
someone did a mashup i guess
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y17WMbxZUfU
Then youtube throws this at me
Yeah somehting like that
rofl
AND i'M HAPPY WITH THIS, NEPHILIM GOT MENTIONED <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Yeah
THis fight was one of the greatest ever
more and more
Fudou is making her side with him
Basa is doing as expected
.
Shem-ha is not a fragment
Hell she wont get a gear, but a full relic
MADE MY DAY
OH YEAH THAT GUY IN THE CAR
Basa directly
What about Fudou mind controlling
i lost.
smugface death
1 chip for you at betting
Yeah lmao
at Chateau
and i feel something has gone wrong
it's OP
PLEASE NERF OWAGA, HE JUST DID KAGE BUSHIN WITH CARS
Vanessa's versability was great
i'm freaking out
i just watched the episode
ok
topdad worst character
yy
that suprised even a freaking cyborg
his ninja shenanigans are too much powerful
Ogawa needs to be nerfed
yeah
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
NOW TIME TO WAIT FOR GAIJIN REACTION PIC
he worsened the despair state and he's brainwashing her
yeah
i don't think so
Basa will 99% side with Fudou at this rate
but i liked fudou using the mind control placed by Millarc on Basa
Well you know she's *suffering*
Oh that.
heh
i got a bit disappointed
i tought they wanted Elf9 activate a faust robe
anywayssss guys
have fun
ikr it's just a suggestion
or we will spoil you
while watching
nougat i suggest you to not read here
the missile would just go sideways
i still don't want to believe that
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
something like that
yeah
The vambrace contacted miku directly it seems
masterplan is progressing
Fudou is doing great
cocoon like bikki?
and wtf is that thing in the sky?
since materialized had wrong timing
But it seems that something went very very wrong
Back
brb dinner
i hope he doesn't appear
Chris is the least fit
then maria is the second
She's the more fit of the 6
^
Basa is fit.
you just keep improving by exercising
of course
since G
Maria was always fit
i feel bad for maria tho
~~kusanagi where ~~
they didn't obey his orders!
Fudou's gonna be angry
Well at that point
but but logic
D:
into a sword?
But hold on didn't they have to convert the bracelet
i bet on this
as a divine being
miku becomes uncontrollable
let's talk about serious plot twist
well come on enough ver
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
^
LOL NEPH OUT OF THE EGG
okay
did we get gaijin pic yet?
lmao
why should serena pop out?^
With cape
GIVE ME BACK CAROL
No i was happy, elf9 deserves suffering
^
OH THAT SCENE
What about the man of the truth?
since they were supposed to turn it into a Sword
They screwed up fudou plan too
Could be
and fudou is not an idiot to shoot it down like the last time
to prevent the fusion in the cocoon this time
And yeah i think there's no way
you're going on meme overload
Lol sekai no hate misete kure
LOL
fufu
i can't recognize that kanji
sekai no?
<@152896851660505088> enlight me
all of them were pretty hypey and enjoyable
still no "low point" episode yet
Anyways Kaneko's holding up greatly
WITH CAPE

i found it.
<@216181207874928640>
editing *skillz
memes.
they derailed.
not body shapes
No we were comparing fitness only
okay i will concede putting them on the same level
hm.
in fitness
you think Bikki > Basa melua?ì
10/10
Lmao
car ninja shenanigans
.
behind the corner.
is still there.
and our adapters return to normal life
the ending where all the relics get destroyed
~~kusanagi~~
~~susano'o~~
with completed cocoon
but reasoning is out of the window
Yeah gungnir could be the only way to "kill" divine miku
to blast her off
It could come down into Bikki having to use her phylosophical gungnir
not this time.
i don't think that reasoning will fix things
And if the coocon succeeds into creating our purple goddess
things will take a sharp turn
i bet on it
Oh fudou will snap now
in suffering
sadly enough Tsubasa really shines
no she's a sword
RIGHT
he's even brainwashing his daughter
Look fudou is the top masterplanner of the whole series
since Noble red's order was to reforge it into a sword
it's miku that grabbed the bracelet
they rushed it
i don't think
and the end of the world
the highlight of the episode was kage bushin ogawa
for the shot
but hey what else could have our master used
what a shame
Nooo
*here i stand waiting*
WHERE IS OUR GAIJIN REACTION PIC?
So people
LOL
millarc best character of the season
what about
oh anyways i want to learn Ogawa's ninjitsu now, the fuck kage bushin with cars
since he's been kinda left out
in the plot twist.
i feel that fudou will have last word
well gungnir is a kami goroshi weapon
miku is getting divine power
but on reverse
more i watch this, more it reminds me my sunshine
and lol solo
with the brainwashing
well yeah
99% certified
my coin here, i bet 10 cents that basa will side with fudou
WAT
my coin here
where was that mentioned?
Lulu IS written ruru
it's katakana
i don't recall that
did she mention Ruru amel?
and the name is custodianish
actually is
know who Lulu amel
Yes but we don't actually
my brain has been lit!
the songs is dedicated to a freaking custodian
RURU AMEL
NO
or WAIT
could argentlam be tied with shem ha?
hm
hmm
10/10 best suffering
to free her from divine power
Then bikki will have to kill miku
yeah
Trump is still there
yeah
Black puddle included solo?
HAH
to return human
i can easily see her asking for their wish
hmmm well Vanessa could like side with miku
Yeah he will be beyond pissed now
outside the keikaku
well Miku activated shem ha
we are in deep crap since we can't really predict now
anyways
i'm still laughing
haha
hah
how the heck do you do that
YEAH
Come on, the backflip with the car is wow
go ahead
low degree ones
*mystic eyes of enchantment*
well
that had some impact let's say that.
basa slapping maria's hand away
millarc wears heels
but yeah it's not fall damage
in the middle
no it got an hole
can be
^
so the phone could have just flew away
the bag fell
Milaarc acting is beautiful
i have to damn agree with melua here
*rururira!*
carol was supposed to live instead!
she deserves it
ofc
and Vanessa was a *researcher* before the incident
-> chateau
Carol knew G events
and one thing is important
to cover it up
They still have to write those things in the reports, and i feel he said it was just a theory
inspection team, fudou, reports
why melua
Inspection team, it's written in the reports, fudou knows
why shouldn't they know
Fudou's plan is kicking in
Yeah
while crying
what about Basa starting to miss Kanade again
of lulu amel
basically fine should be an exemplar
ancient one
and ancient stuff
is connected to something related to custodians
then it's like certain that the apple song
uhm
Yeah that could be too
but something like "ancient superior humans"
custodians aren't really proper gods
as far as we know
rotten to the core
Garie was good
my top 3 villains in Geah right now are Ver, Carol and millarc
notice that millaarc arm is still wounded
but ouch that hurts
best scene
lols
but i will gladly accept "alchemy" as an excuse and turn aside
even the green flash from her mounth
THat was an alchemical thing
yeah but there's no reaction in slashing
i'm still curious how millarc makes people go in flame by just hitting them with her nails
and made me lose the bet!
but no, smugface had to die
that got squished there
a bag full of blood
you know at first i've just tought it was
then she could have just stomped it
iirc
yes
was a quote
that the Show me the end of the world scene
oh <@139432096023183360> someone mentioned
but custodians might still come down
no one mentioned
but that would mean that Kami goroshi bikki will have to kill her
and thinking over it God Miku could be the huge deal
Miku's cocoon will be more fearsome than bikki one
thus shem ha
Lulu amel, ancient humans are connected to argentlam and serena
but yeah
this is of course just for me.
else i would have waited too
is worth the hype with everyone in the channel
but a rewatch with our dear YTT
well i don't fuss much about that
Lulu amel
Yeah
the sentence is just weird.
You know, i lost it there
yeah
10/10
"show me the end of the world"
uhm in the end you're right
how do you even barrel roll a car in mid air?
Ogawa car ninjitsu was too much big for me to handle
fudou even invited her back to the household
but yeah basa brainwashing is up
weekly comments where
oh hello <@139432096023183360>
Chris is always quality
Haha " put yo hands up"
can you show me? i'm curious, let's move to <#337805317276565525>
oh god
no i don't reach that number but yeah
^
i got a quite long list of stuff to play first
okay i will take note to play it someday
no come on topgrandad masterplan is working
is wild arms worth to play ?
Lol
kaneko referencing himself?
oh dear.
PUT YOUR HANDS UP BEST PART
*and maria*
Ogawa was the highlight lol
Well there wasn't much to do this week
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431914167826382860/609856226028683437/gaijinchartxv.jpg
Oh right
Exactly!
and Vanessa can't follow a ninja even on foot
and run away on foot
look it's ogawa, the alternative was to jump out of the car
it's just physically impossible to barrel roll like that
😂
Vanessa says it right?
Modern ninjitsu
yesh
nice, one more reason
is it good?
i have to watch it
```in the famous scene where the guy is riding on the car's hood, he says 世界の果てを見せてあげよ, and here we have the driver say 世界の果てを見せてくれ```
yeah
Alca noises are far more vulnerable
yes
Yeah
if he gets hit by a regular noise, no chance.
the reaction and the speed of the reaction are different
i think it depends if he gets hit by a noise or an alcanoise
Uhm
<@256802531584376833> see? I told you
😂
^
that Noble red failed to convert shem ha
Anyways Fudou will be so angry now
Lol
lulu amel song is surely connected
Serena a custodian? LOL
she doesn't deserve to be treated badly by basa
anyways i feel bad for maria
Anunnaki?=
Fudou might die on that part
and she wont give a damn about humans
since she wont be in control
no i think she will act as a superior being
**suffering**
Kerrik, you know evil minds grow in that place
LOL
it doesn't have to be the end
God Miku vs Kami Goroshi Bikki*
I call out Miku vs Bikki
no jokes aside
i call out kusanagi.
No
Serena -> lulu amel -> argentlam -> shem ha
more than thinking of kanade anyways
*takes out 1 cent*
you can bet on it
It will last until the Seal is on her
she kinda relapsed
until axz
she has gotten over it
Symphogear 101: how to cancel out character development
*sakimori*
wings no more, just a sword
Metal regression^
if he's a lulu amel, then fine was a lulu amel too
a Lulu Amel
he could be
a superior race that claims to be a god
i think that custodians are pseudodeities
to work properly
but the seals needs to meet a requirement
Then milaarc tried to seal bikki too
Yeah
the 70k lives were collateral
just to put the seal on her
Well fudou sent Millaarc
i  think that's just alchemy
now they can't
They were converting the relic
he's gonna be so angry
fudou plan got derailed
god miku wont side with song
and respecting that line
that line.
Haha
and solo let me say that, such theory smells a lot like nasu somehow
THAT YOU NEVER KNOW.
THE PROBLEM IS
Solo if you nailed this... really
REALLY
OH WAIT
that Kaneko did the euation
So you think
Uhm
No i was thinking of Pure nephilim not ver fused part
if Nephilim absorbed Divine Power?
oh dear now that i think of it, what would have happened
No i didn't please, mastermind of suffering, *enlight me*
idk it's too much abstract to say
it's not just light
uh solo is right
ruru ameru
fudou's doing the right stuff for his Great Japan plan
Hey
speculation is always cool
rip euph
without the other adaptors in the way
would be the ideal thing
Yeah Kami Goroshi Bikki vs Kami Miku
and testament meh
but it got ridiculous on GX
i didn't like XD and testament, i mean the first was okay the first time
it doesn't come down to full amalgam bikki
i just hope
.
y
and returning to normal life.
and i feel that XV will end with all the adaptors losing their gears
Yeah GX wasn't enough for an ending
oh dear
+1
dess
several times
i called them kirabe and shirika out of confusion
are you a servant solo?
IT'S LIKE FREAKING HASSAN
Solo eats hearts
Yeah it seems like that
oh dear
aaah some nice content linked by solopy
in his skills
solo has Master of Suffering EX
i think all the geahs will retire
#tsubasakillsmaria
that ending would probably break my heart
i don't know why lol
more i freak out
more i watch that pic
10/10
^
it's beautiful by the way
<@!279341087494242304> ~~ever present feeling~~
watch out, basa is going to side with top grandad
LOL
😂
it's a funny highlight in norse myths
please don't forget the skadi-loki scene
i bet on it
for sure.
will face kami goroshi bikki
Well god miku
weird style for gear
need more.
i want more fudou schemes
will join the hype train a bit late
well i will have to wait until tonight since i have to go somewhere when the submarine is out
~~and kusanagi fudou~~
Kami Miku vs Kami Goroshi Bikkie where
tonight we discover the disaster
Oh dear
Yeah
in her side dimension
it always went away
Look we never get to see her Faust robe getting destroyed
but still
yes i know she will be
by Divine power
What about bikki being beaten into coma
i'm so much hyped
yes yes it does
but it is a nice effect indeed
with interrupting songs
Oh and they kinda overdid
Kami Miku vs Kami Goroshi Bikkie
THE HF CATCHPHRASE AGAIN
WHAT ABOUT THEY BROUGHT UP
SOLO
She didn't
and Carol reacts
What about the part where Millaarc tries to seal ELf9
CARORU WITH FAUST ROBE
We were as i was ASKING
BEST EPISODE 10/10
CARORUUUUUU
I'M GOING IN OVERDRIVE NOW
OK ARE YOU KIDDING ME
OK
No i think he started to suspect that something is not right in her sister
the same
to basa when she mentioned kanade would have done
giving an hard face
Our Genjurou
did you notice
Oh
Oh this means
^
since there's no space for our dear man of the truth
any other way could damage XV
At this point
and ver just appears in it
for lulu amel apple song
if they give us a flashback
how it would be perfect?
Look you know
Shinjitsu no Hito could reappear
i'm still shivering
of XV
this will be my favourite episode
again
but yeah
Rofl chossei
was GOLDEN
OH WELL THAT move where she did clog up Chris's revolver
Lol
Vanessa lost her patience
yeah
7 b
OFC
Reusing Genocide and genocide would have overkilled me
lol
there for a moment
RURURIRA
i kinda expected
Gotta be honest
it just went back there
LOL
poor chris-chan
it flashbacks the scene in my mind
the song.
relistening that
god i have goosebumps
There you take it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PANLJiR2A8
yes
it could be makyuu ichiaval callbacking
Saki i don't think bark at the moon is in it
uhm
was slapped from S1
The ost during the Stadium massacre
Yes, right from the start
it's filled with S1 OSTs
True true
Yeah i agree with sak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdajEqLCmnY
to appreciate this again
let's take a moment
Look i think that basa is already beautifully drawn in XV
was top tier waifu material
that face
Oh
Carol strikes bacvk
wish has been fufilled
but my
i went in overhype
ok cypher calm down, it's nothing
FOR THE GAIJIN REACTION PIC
WE WAIT
OH NOW
is so old but gold
That image
it could all make sense
hahaha if you see it in that way
Lmao come on that's a stretch
Ruru Ameru wa
why solo?
LOL
FRIEZA?
annunaki, lulu ameru
Pavarian illuminati
kami goroshi, kami, miracles destroyer, 2 sakimoris
HYPE
THIS^
IKR
YEAH
that Fudou can call the shots
and <@185949743321579520> don't forget
it's from s1
this scene.
reminded me
That smile

yeah
And genjurou spotted her regressing
she's losing it
Yeah
lol no pls
it was twiching
in the elevator scene?
to Garie hand while she was talking
Have you taken a look
are using damaged spare body
Well those autoscorers
but it comes from a latin word
you write it Meka in katakana
with the term Mecha
it's the same story
look
10/10
it should be Mika
i will over-die
genocide
Solo if she sings
it's a must.
comes out
the episode when YT submarine
i will rewatch
lol
eh
i hope that amalgam doesn't fix all the problems
oh well
Last wish is Fudou with kusanagi
again
my carol henshin
So now that i got
oh lol
i think he is just joking pats
Lol
~~ is that some kind of cursed fanfic?~~
Still no gaijin reaciton pic?
ver's no longer human in GX, he survives a big fall and that severe wound
i think it's more than that Xan
in GX
but Ver did become a nephilim himself
y
in Chateau remnant?
how melua?
where he just appears
But nothing denies the possibility of a mere flashback
he would just damage the series if he reappears
Honestly as much as i love Ver
it was great
my last wish
Fudou Kusanagi
that reeks of FMAB
Lol
the anon couldn't handle the hype and broke down
die this time around?
did the gaijin reaction pic
So
put your hands up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4qtFSDWzGA
she's the only one who can damage Gods
Bikki is kami goroshi
!
make a separate page
Carolnein on wiki when
10/10
thank you <@152896851660505088>
THE GAIJIN REACT PIC
THEY DID IT
OH
that thing
s1 smile flashback

wait
oh dear
it all connects!
that's why she's cute during that smile
Suffering is where basa really shines
in the end, as i said before
bad things will happen then
heh
could be
LOL
hands up
it's worse than stating "i hate to sing"
she clearly said that she's not believing in songs anymore
she's worsening
Not really millhi
on that henshin phase
on basa
that we will get some kind of error
there's some theory
rururira
*kusanagi where*
and i feel that basa will return to fudou soon
but japan comes first!
how to shave away character development: 101
mental regression
heh
i was waiting for your reaction
HELLO AKEUPHO
poor garie
was a godsend
oh garie acting
nothing stops her for making more copies!
but HEY if carolnein becomes a thing
for the autoscorers
i felt a bit sad
sry
i don't even follow it anymore
well i've put the " "
what <@!279341087494242304>
ok that makes sense
oh with the "stand" power
lol
how the heck melua
TO YUGI-ATEM RELATION
WOULD BRING
THAT
*waits her to sing genocide again*
ikr
solo?
mind crush where
basa shines because she suffers.
as i said solo
heh
ZASSHU!
LOL
and unbeatable
so Kami goroshi is not almighty
by that thing
and let's remember that bikki got beaten
do the same thing in a different fashion
that Alchemy and phonic gain
Noble red clearly explained
heh millhi
to sustain the faust robe
and will just use phonic gain
since she wont burn memories
but i believe that carolnein will be massively underpowered compared to carol
This is me theorizing anyways
with our dear YT subs
okay time to rewatch
~~woh melua i just noticed your profile pic is a gif, 10/10~~
i think it's just a way to tell you, don't nuke the channel with negativity
oh yeah
wot wot
yeah thanks indeed
than CR
this part was much better
https://puu.sh/E6EUC/b2d0e0f03b.png
and i don't know but it feels like elfnein sacrificed something by letting carol take over
behind
so she didn't leave the concept of genocide and genocide
i think carolnein song explains their/her state of mind right now
ok i've just watched yt subs
hands up
yes i mean apple
that could mean something
and ruru ameru song
by Shem ha melody
tomosato said that there are some differences
uh
Granbelm 😂
LOL
WTF CR?
ok ok i just noticed
*carolnein
*looks at the man of the truth in background*
*and maria*
yeah
take your chart
https://i.imgur.com/nYIzJda.jpg
<@185949743321579520>
makes some effect
that
oh
nice
to bring her back
in b4 the only kiss scene we get is the one where maria kisses basa
i've had enough of kanade flasbacks
pls no.
no
oh and i somewhat believe that maria could snap on her
if basa suffers she shines
remember solo
and she's the most badass one
Chris already had her chardev arc
Well she went over that
where basa backstabs Song to help her grandad
i want to see the betrayal scene
this
^
with no big problems
Genjurou could handle a 1v1 with Millarc
i still believe
right now
basa is in the worst state ever
nayh
ruru ameru wa.
God miku vs Amalgam Kami Goroshi bikki
she will become a god soon
Why give her a gear
LOL
aishiteru is an heavy word
woh that reaction count
basa clearly forgot the concept of *ai*
does i think
dur la bla boost
I will share it here too (mal's rating doesn't count but still)
Hm Lol
he may be the worst but he did want to oppose carol
that wants to destroy the world
the Hero facing a genocidal psychopath
I mean
that was uneeded.
the thing became full meme on AXZ
was great
that Ver addiction to GX
Look i think
you guys dislike ver but topdad is just the worst
of that.
and i'm quite happy
worst geah character
Akira can go into the trash can
And beautiful artwork
Suffering!
That's on point solo
Woah
Tsubasa really shines in suffering
10/10
Fudou kusanagi!
No more elf9 she sacrificed herself to get carol back
Godmiku vs kamigoroshi bikki
I have to agree.
10/10
uh
lol
But how
This might be it <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Oh god
carolneiin
Since kamakura.
Sandwitched and unable to act
Yeah genjurou it's in the worst position of the series rn
Vs custodians
Pffft just send 7 billion zesshou
But yeah escalation is coming
Carolnein vs everyone
Basa vs song
Fudou vs gen
Bikki vs miku
and headcannons?
"for you i will..." -> rururira
Elfnein seemed to sacrifice something
for one reason
i don't think so
if you read endfing song of the episode, she still is against the world
than genocidal carol
is so much different
I don't think carolnein
lmao val verde
|| miku = sakura ||
this is slipping out of hand
!
~~it's all planned guys solo talked to kaneko, it's all planned ~~
oh god
then Godmiku.
like he never did
and fudou getting angry
i predict Carolnein umiliating noble red in a 3v1
tomorrow we get the huge episode
So
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiUtLxzADxc
REJOYCE
True enough
Lol
I fear your reactions if "shinjitsu no hito" pops out
Saki went wild
Lol
It's the community job to keep the thing alive
After xv ends
Well
don't worry i'm joking
rofl
outspeeded miso
HAH
but yeah, solo is right
Would say
That's exactly what our hero
Ai desu yo
Remember that he understands love
To stop godmiku
In b4 ver pops out and uses anti linker
most dynamic exit in anime part 1
legit
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
anyways READY FOR THE SUFFERING TRAIN GUYS?
gj you both
Lol
(this night)
Oke time to retire from this channel until i watch the episode
submarine where
for subs yes
kusanagi!
it's a matter of time solo
I'M SHIVERING
10/!0
THIS
https://puu.sh/E982k/bca4f8279f.png
Was FUDOU with RED EYES
guys just HOW FREAKING COOl
was GREAT
and the transformatin
it's so similar
I TOLD YOU
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEH
and  i think that fudou gave them fake blood
i was shivering during carol fight
WAS GREAT
the episode
reasonable
i mean i find Zouken = Fudou
that comparison
wait how did you make
LOL
and FUDOU STILL HAS A SECRET ACE IN THE HOLE
fuck yyeaaaah
and 7 BILLION PHONIC GAIN!
GOD MIKU VS KAMI GOROSHI BIKKI
I TOLD YOU GUYS
WHAT DID I JUST SEE
OK
OK
OK
yuka iguchi will kill us
IF there is miku song
Uhm
*looks at G*
and no boob jiggle this time
it was wonderful
yeah
10/10
was godmiku henshin
how a work of art
oh let's talk
choo choo
by the episode
but yeah i'm pretty satisfied
Carol > Adam
this is why i think
7b phonic gain
but nop you can't beat
on Carolnein
to gang up
And lol how noble red tried
Horaay
a better option to put useless elf9 aside!
Carol is the core personality of carolnein
I liked how
But yeah they're in deep shit now
UPGRADED RAILGUN!
OH WHAT ABOUT MARIA&CHRIS COMBINED ARTS?
is playing in fudou hands
I love how everyone
i agree on that.
well yeah
Oh that
10/10
HAHA ANON DID IT
THANKS SOLO
WHERE IS GAIJIN REACTION PIC?
OH
BEST
!
and <@145705908716961792> so you liked weekly episode of symphogranbelm
it wont interfere with future henshin
it doesn't mean
jus tbecause it exploded
she wont be able to activate it again
and if bikki turns it down once
i think that Gungnir will be busted
"Condition red" guys
DID YOU NOTICE THAT?
OPERATION RED
GUYS
OH RIGHT
spoilers.
crunchyroll weekly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBSbyOzun0Y
and point
is SSJ
yeah the thing behind
COULD IT BE
OH
Oh
s e n pai?
THIS
^
^
it's Shem-ha
"can't we friends anymore"
that some serious shit.
LOl
THE DREAM?
<@!279341087494242304> WHAT ABOUT
OH
it would be even better than eiai no promise
thrice.
Genjurou
they had shot out
for a second anyways i was like sure
FUDOU -> CUSTODIAN
IN b4
.
His physical strenght it's not human
he could be susanoo descendant for all we know
implies something
if Sakimori blood
well we don't really know
*kusanagi where*
I agree that fudou is the one in more advantageous position right now
*there's some pulling*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6pUTyd_0aQ
DID YOU SAY DON'T PULL G SHIT?
it's beautiful
IKR
~~*susano'o descendants *~~
and divine power becomes fudou's
that bikki beats god miku
there's a possiblity
look
anyways
<#371105434771390465> guys
at least not yet
me neither
I told you
while discussing.
there's me listening eiai promise
en
Th
Shem-ha is a full fledged relic
Well it was pure floating divine power
😄
with antilinker?
now what's next? we save miku from god status
Shemha will force a pseudo personality
yeah i don't think it's Miku at this point
THIS
^
in the episode!
A NEW "DATTO"
OH WE GOT
^
i'm sick with that
kanade again no.
No please
in the episode
when bikki pops out
since he's the one who talks
in the rocket
the stuff stirred him
yeah
it's for the sake of JAPAN!
it's not for himself
scene.
terrible
That's the same of saying if Ver plan succeeded nothing of this shit would have happneed
adam isn't.
he's a decent villain
easy questionm
fudou
YEAH
^
<@!279341087494242304> || XV is too dangerously close to mysunshine, just on reverse ||
the nuke
yeah SSJ would be able to erase
Lol
#LAWFUL
GOTTA PROTECT JAPAN YOU KKNOW
!
and get an henshin
and pull out kusanagi
fudou will steal divine power
oh god
Lol
and they did it too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVoSbQB8thQ
lol
oh same
that means undermining his authority
in that case fudou will go mad
that's true too
the puny humans
shemha is going to punish
no i think
"They precure it"
and it's "to be confirmed"
i catch your point
so shemha is in miku body
i feel it.
of god miku
Fudou will take advantage
but oh boya
when bikki punched through
and the transfer finished
or else, miku mind was into the cocoon
That could be logical
the reverse
uh
elf9 said that
and transferred to the relic
miku was being dematerialized
no i don't agree with that
beautiful
it's
Lol
but yeah solo || fudou = zouken and miku = sakura ||
and pull out kusanagi
Fudou will steal divine power
i really doubt
no
time to save all those
Oh right
*ai desu yo*
was different
and yeah enki bracelet
err
fine was an annunaki
well in theory
will get possessed
no i don't think that our sakimori
but anyways solo lol i would roll for that
at some point
divine power
that fudou will hijack
I THINK
else linker would have not worked
that was true love
Ai desu yo
like Ver one?
uh
legit point
because maria butted in
in this one she had to backdown
in the next episode
And i think that basa will betray song
Yeah
his expertise is much higher
Fudou would win
he's not the type to back down
don't forget that fudou is there
Please guys
if we still had solomon cane
a god would laugh over that
if 3 alchemists did manage to stop a nuke
lol usa nuking again?
lol what an half assed solution is that lmao
without the "shinjitsu no hito"
you can't control chateau
Remember millhi
it's a megastructure
Hah
or something
since fudou gave them like fake blood
at this pace
and i fear that noble red will die
with her 7b phonic gain?
You think?=
to match a god
is strong enough
if Gungnir as a fragment of a relic
The point is
and would not  be even fun for the writer
if something doesn't inspire writing something for it will create bad content
yeah
well
*puts you hands up da*
oh well hands up then
miku henshin in G
uh they do as long as i know
is badly damaged by color noise
Half of Chris Henshin
FFS
AND DIED OUT COLOR
and NO COLOR NOISE
it is going to be eye blowing
when we get the BD
Just think
hah
we will see
*theories*
well in the end
it would be a waste of animation
No i don't agree with that
i think that the converter just went into the trash can and gungnir can't be reactivated
bikki
about Condition Red
And i'm a lot worried
XD amalgam, i don't think the relic can resist that magnitude
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Ai no tame you mean?
?  (jk)
Are you saving those step by step *keeper of 22338 pics*
np
take carolnein
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/431914167826382860/614969563938947073/xv_8_reaction_guys.png
it's a good ending and a forced conclusion
and the adaptors will return to normal life
Look i will repeat myself, i think that all the gears will get destroyed
oh dear
it's golden
at the gaijin reaction pic
man i'm still laughing
of the core gettign destroyed
Yes but we don't have confirmation
yes
its core could have survived
hm we don't know
i think that they continuosly spawn in that space
well i don't think they're destroyed
so solo you're suggesting to let shemha disturb gilgamesh home again? <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Oh good point there
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
we could have sent noises
nepyasuo please give us enlightnment
lol
wot ones
just shot humans down
that's not even needed
shines in a mirror fashion
on her torso
how the Relic
i damn loved
ooooh thanks YTT ❤
not that half assed alchemist called elf9
this time to give explanations.
and we even got CAROL MALUS DIENHEIM
of "how SSJ went into Shemha"
we will need an actual explanation
I think that
was BEAUTIFUL ON MIKU
let's talk of how that dress
OH
an hybrid henshin
look melua i think it's a mixed thing
https://puu.sh/E9koS/1862b2cd72.png
on the background
since there's the SSJ itself
It is
Lol why melua?
Lol siegway noises
EXACTLY!
*HORAAY*
to take SSJ's place!
now we got this!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVoSbQB8thQ
i will don't worry
gosh
was from the bible
Neshutan
<@!279341087494242304> ever present feeling like situation where
anyways
Fudou = zouken
^
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
*what are you doing to do if i become an evil person?*
COUGHS
*Sekai no hate misete age yo*
ooma shu bad character
lol
i tought that but i didn't write it
Lol
WHERE
KUSANAGI
NOH
it would be more practical for him and basa to wield it
i don't really think so
i will rewatch it this evening
since Fudou ordered a Sword made out of it
that Vanessa was doing something at Shemha
and don't forget
Yeah probably
3/4 of it
RYOUKO HAD THE FULL MIRROR
and HOLD ON
not the whole mirror itself
but it was a FRAGMENT of SSJ
yea it was reased
^
are clearly funnels
Those flying devices
*revolver ocelot*
[FINAL COMMANDER]
UH
it would be nice to see billion maiden again
Oh true
too much time has passed
i don't remember it
Heavyarms custom
cuz of <:Cag:423197445644615711>
someone said Heart shaped rockets
Lol regarding Chris Amalgam
is more important!
Sakimori blood
but but
expecially with damn amalgam
to Saint seya ones
i've always compared Gear henshin
Lol
if you look in that way
well undergear is just a swimsuit
Best old chapter was the sea division
LEGIT
Lol
and you will know when i do
well i'm going to take a nap brb later
gp03
AAAA
lol not even zeonic zakus packed that many missiles
are the best two
This and Maikyuu ichiaval
Lol
See chossei understands
melee*
i gues she had enough of being ganged up in meee
they were just a few
and those werent like noise mass swarms
are more practical
those revolvers
Lol
when it happened
but chris wasn't there
just once melua
no mass noise spawn this time
because they're made for mass massacre
is not needed
Heavyarms
but hold on
Yeah
but it was shown
It wasn't said
putting pieces of a relic near Shemha
Vanessa
No but you see
oh legit
dunno why
i think that our carol will give an explanation
oh i easily see gungnir getting erased.
can beat a god
i don't think that Gungnir even amalgamized
Yeah
oh that was dope
Time to side with topgrandad
and i think that basa worsening has not ended.
y
and Ame no habakiri doesn't care about that state
Basa mental status is the same as s1
Ehm not exactly
no more blood
to die
And i expect noble red
Millhi we will see <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
that would be the worst.
NO EH
>condition red
and shem ha
but i don't see how bikki can beat ssj
lol
^
>kusanagi
Episode 9 and 10 will bear God miku vs Kami goroshi bikki
THEN both lose and fudou snatches the deal
no i don't think so
oh i agree with WFC 100%
YEah
AM I THE ONLY ONE? who expected gen to come out from the rocket???
without gears
And that goes near my hypothesis of the "good" ending consisting in Adaptors returning to normal lifes
but yeah i'm going out now, cya laterz
now she activated amalgam
bikki will get arrested
uh
the worst hero
that sounds like
redeption flags!
sorry but it's my least fav character after Topdad
if useless elf9 didn't but in
Carol would have killed noble red
oh yeah
basa really shines when she suffers
chossei
it's me
10/10
^
it's too much amazing
i hope it's not an oneshot thing
miku in that dress
Damn
i'm back
aaaand
Dmjii yeah it's clearly a thing
Oh yeah
ogawa got his space
Yeah
LOl
in that frame
Look rany as i said today i **really** expected Gen to come out from the rocket
in b4 fine saves maria
i negate miracles!
Ha take this god
that would be supreme.
in b4 carol wins it
>carol
oh yeah bikki winning alone will be supreme disappointment
instead of pulling kanade flashbacks AGAIN
back to reality
to shake basa up
it's a good excuse to give Maria the screentime
Well wfc
it might snap
they're pulling the rope too much
that WFC is right
look i think
daedalus end actually ended.
how? there are many paths kaneko can take in that direction
that fudou will steal divine power
i still think
.
i will change my color based on next episode
heh
Lol
they said that
Yes
he wishes for ~~tenka fubu ~~ the glory of japan
i don't think fudou's wish would be that puny
and no anyways
LOL NO
with 1 hand
look at how he stopped millarc
Fudou is still buff
then people here corrected me
since she spams Dess
i tought that it was DeathMaster
well look at kirika power armor
*dess*
Kirika is Dark magician
Dark Magician and Shirabe
"Phonic gain too much weak to activate XD? Let carol pump it up" -> **7B ZESSHOU**
I liked how they pulled out
Ignite = amalgam rn
ignite is no more
10/10
XD will get shot down by our Goddess
*your skin on mine*
yeah
DMJii are clearly a couple
no but the songs are too much direct
duet ones
the damn songs
get busted
then fudou pulls out kusanagi
10/10
that reaction coun t
LOL
-> metanoia
Ai No Tame
OVERKILL SCYTHE HELL
Time to listen
it's great
y i did
metanoia you mean?
but the others are weaker
Gbeat and Giwan argentlam
are on par with originals
look i think that only 2 ignite songs
Lol nice comparison blackraiden
is godlike
ignite g beat
so let's live in peace it's better
it's not possible for me and wfc to converge on the matter
well it's better to drop the argument
hey.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT
But yeah i can't just agree with wfc on ver
a deja vu?
Is this discussion
0/10
of the series.
topdad is the worst character
just no
Ehm excuse me wfc
LOL
sorry
i wasn't at home
WTF KANEKO?
CHILDREN = TOMATOES
your opinion on this week episode
so so AKEUPHO let's listen
D:
SASUGA SUGITA
Sugita is a madman
shinjitsu no hito
but he actually saved the plot in GX
even if i like ver a lot
but yeah that could have been avoided
well that was a short shot
he can be legit only and only as appearing in Maria's flashback
no ver would damage the series at this point
yeah
Well let's say i truly discovered Yuka iguchi, Yoko Hikasa, Ayahi and Nana from gear
OH lol
that you're a friend of the VA?
lol
i'm lost, what do you mean
uhm
was cool yeah
oh Leiur voice
for that
by using Maria as a woman
to repopulate humanity
it's because he said
no
ak
Kaneko did mistakes
again why are we talking about this again?
i don't like how people bash down ver just for something He said
*just because you're correct it doesn't mean you're right*
in front of noble red
if she sang genocide again
i would have died on the spot
as i said
inori minase!
RURURIRA
Then we get
i mean that voice is not something you can find easily
well nana is top tier
saaad
where.
AC on pc?
oooh
In the process
But it gets erased
No gungnir manages to break ssj
Vs fudou
Who dies
Gen could be the one
Ssj god miku can erase those
I still see the road of the sour but happy ending where we say goodbye to the relics and the adaptors return to mundane life
7-8 are freaking hype space shuttle go watch them
.
And we don't know fudou ace in the hole
As i said, fudou will snatch divine power. He wont stand down from his final destination
Perfect mastermind
I'm loving fudou more and more
Was golden
Oh the poisoned blood part
Goodbye gungnir
I think next ep is
Oh they're pulling the rope on god slayer
Oh god just imagine nephilim asorbing shem ha
Would have barred shem ha
Every villain victory
Well millhi
Kusanagi
Fudou takes divine power
And miku returns normal
Bikki lises gungbir
Godmiku vs bikki
Lol
Everyone loses their gear and gen vs fudou become a thing
Rururira > Ruru ameru
ikr
Low class pavarian alchemists
Yeah
Our lord and saviour
Nice
Solo is the suffering master
FINARU COMANDA DATTO?
UH
topdad
worst character
man i gotta play wild arms
Lol
and both dying
if he doesn't well, it's plan b, i expect him vs gen
maybe final boss
that Fudou will play a major role
i still think
Gob was filled with divine things!
But but
And there were divine constructs there
Yeah
We are supposing that the dimension exploded but can it be really destroyed?
Can shem ha open ~~gil dimension~~ gate of babylon?
Now that i think of it
Uh
You guys are forgetting that shemha has a proper personality
At least not Kanade
please don't
no
just to appear for one scene.
Serena's va is too much expensive
by money issue
AXZ was caused
i'm a bit fed up with those flashbacks
Ugh
Lol
Come on.
They had to bring out the worst character of the series in the middle of the chaos
Topdad really
Fuck
They need a transfusion else they will die
Noble red is in the worst situation possible
Or it will be a draw
Gen is gonna lose
So fudou vs gen?
Damn topdad
Yeah
I mean ssj is already a godsend
Shemha design is godlike
BRING IT ON
More suffering
Yeaah
Basa fighting for fudooouuu
Lol what
Anyways <@279341087494242304> you sure that shemha isn't childhood end? <:Ver:336656981144109066>
As wfc predicted
He will die
Lol
Lolol
Today is friday
Noh it's tomorrow eve
Tomorrow evening we  will create a history with the hype god could not know
I just hope it doesn't hurt the pacing
It doesn't mean the episode will crap out
It's just me hating topdad
But yeah
Best comparison
Haha <@279341087494242304>
I guess
Was just a fake alarm
So sugita being spotted near the studio
Can't open it rn
Ugh
#lawful evil
Top tier villain
Fudou evil laugh is just the best
Exactly.
Eeeeh
Then they sent the date straight in summer
For april
Xv was scheduled
On overdose
Linker has a backfire
He saved the plot in gx
Akira is just nothing. I hate him
He was the last action hero the planet needed
I agree with ver having nothing to contribute in axz, also he is not needed in xv. But honestly topdad isn't needed
Not irl stuff.
Well hands up, i meant on aligment side
The law is supposed to save people tho
Demonize and hate your enemy
That's how the stereotypical lawful good paladin works
Not exactly?
Hmmm
Chill out ladies and gentlemen
That's a faust robe
Not needed
Yea
Yy
S1
It's shown solo
Oh in that case
She embodied caesar
in 19 hours!
hype hype hype train
Come on guys
*Childhood's end plays*
WAT
just to get [Grand battle 1/1]
see ya this evening
okay time to avoid this channel
i'm hyped about fudou tho
I hope Topdad doesn't turn me down
hell yeah
the hibiki grunt is 10/10
Lol wt
At first i was like
they didn't even have the time to react
oh and rip noble red
God that hand trust
IT'S THE BEST EP
HOW LOL
join  the bullet train
YES
Yes
it made crapton of sense
let me say, i loved how he lost
was freaking great
and fudou powering himself up like that
Yeah that too
damn it , gen made a literal hole in the mountain behind the mansion
Fudou vs Gen is the best fight until now
IT'S 10/10
THE HYPE TRAIN HAS BECOME A FULL SPEED SHINKANSEN
THE HECK DID I JUST SEE
GUYS
OK
damn it
Anyways tsubasa's suffering is truly the beautifulest thing
With all respects but come on they got ganked hard
Indeed
got Noise'd
how half of Ogawa's Grunts
Oh let's talk
^
THE MEME "BUT YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING" FINALLY DIED
DID SOMETHING
Maria FINALLY
that millarc got sliced
but i think it helped
Yeah it was maria
Oh that was logical too
I might have to rewatch the scene
hm you sure?
and Elza got the worst hit
Vanessa can be repaired
Only Millaarc can regenerate
thank you fudou for bringing the best thing of the season up
oh and Faust robe SSJ got explained
LOL
HOW MELUA?
but then SHE SLICED BOTH
"look Frieza killed vegeta symphogear version"
in 1v1
I loved how he bashed basa
yeah
but it's not your average katana
Oh of course melua
that katana was the murakumo
Guys please realize that Fudou was using  a full relic there
THAT WAS MURAKUMO
On and heck
SKILLS NINRYU?
DID YOU LIKE TOPGRANDAD
and she shines in it.
during the whole franchise
I think that with this, tsubasa is the character who suffers the most
i could feel the sufferign from afar
the scene was deep
OH HELLO NINRYU
welcome to the bullet hype train avatar
than GX ones
I understand they were better
that found Akira's scene empty
please guys, tell me i'm not the only one
Oh and
😂
Lol i agree with millhi
with a pistol
you need to hit the noise multiple times
true
^
during the night
Lol the sunglasses
brb dinner
suplex.
40 meters
mid air
full ledged
in suffering
but again for the 100th time, she shines a lot
was heartbreaking
Tsubasa crying
gen got his head showed in the ground
God
yeah
until amalgam saved the day
anyways i will rewatch the episode when yt comes out, i feel like CR did a murder this time
oh true
or something near neutral evil
as Lawful evil
i still think of fudou
to do so
No he's not the type
lol i agree
i
Kusanag
Oh and what did we say ?
Lol
BRUTAL
DID YOU LIKE THE SHEER SUFFERING SOLO?
EPISODE
THE
we hide there.
in mobile gaming and nonsymph spoilers.
You can find us
READY FOR  [GRAND BATTLE 1/1]?
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU
SOLO
HELLO
i want to see next ep
Noble red oh god
lol
last time
well they went bsod
GAIJIN REACTIONS!
Now we wait for the cherry on the cake
Yeah lol
Yeah he was angry as he's never been
LOL
THAT PUNCH
WHAT ABOUT maria getting hit by FUDOU
something important
we are forgetting
OH
Lol ninja
i expected ogawa blocking it
it was unexpected
Yes of course
ALone.
Fudou Theoretically won the whole fight
Eh "beat" it's a relative world
Yeah
another full relic got blasted
Rip murakumo
^
could not contain the hype
I got up from my chair and watched the whole episode standing
YEAH
Elsa tho, i doubt
if blood is provided
i see her regenerating
look' millarc is half vampire
FULL SLICE
but NOP
i was like "look kamiku killed elsa how frieza killed vegeta"
seriously
i'm still shivering about that
how noble red died
oh god
-> amalgam
Fudou beating basa but NOP
The episode was heart attack level
AND WE GOT MURAKUMO
millhi
We can't be full sure
hm
*coughs* Bark at the moon*
Lol
i can easily see going berserk
oh she went in shock when she watched the moon
with the red light
Yeah Shem ha activated those
KIDOU
Moon ruins
after the ending?
DID YOU WATCH THE SCENE
OH WAIT GUYS
Same
(for me)
best nana song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYTErQFcNA
let's appreciate this again #basacd
guys
oh Basa cd soon
PUT YOUR HANDS UP
and more is coming
in 5 seasons.
were the best we ever got
now as i try to wind my hype down, i can easily say that these 3 last episodes
Lol melua, it would be logical
40 meters suplex you know
Fudou has won vs Ame no habakiri
but look
he can't surpass amalgam
and return to normal life
and ending where the girls lose their gear
the more i see
The more we advance
Shem ha will not let the situation go
but i seriously fear for the adaptors
well we will see
*PHONIC GAIN DA*
it could be not
it could be innate
7b zesshou
in 1v1
In b4 Carol is going full Rururira and actually manages to beat Kamiku
oke millhi
but planet earth will be sad
no curse of balal!
everyone is happy
destroys the moon
so if shem ha
nah
heh
i'm joking
*AI DESU YO*
POSSIBLE
THAT'S STILL
LOL
since he wuld be out of place
Ver should not come back
around shem ha
Vanessa putting fragments
you literally saw
Look
and it's not me.
if that's true
someone would get angry here
-> noble red
Yeah
Fudou stole ver tech
it was on her back this time
it's a new one
we got an explanation
THAT
YEAH
oh and i still think
i hold my doubts
They could
OH
s1 animations
yeah
so why no insane strenght
basa has it too
it's sakimori blood but
"why fudou and gen got insane physical abilities and basa doesn't?"
was asking me
A friend
100/100
THEY GAVE US THE DRESS AGAIN
OH AND
SSJ henshin vs Kamiku henshin
Oh millhi now you have
i can't be helped
heh i don't like Adam
G > GX > S1 > AXZ was my rate
well i agree on that
out of the 4?
oke
already?
gaijin reaction
<@152896851660505088> answer me do we have
that scene was great
that's some serious "lawfulness"
until the end
what he tought was right
Look fudou believed
SUGITA
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
that's a dangerous word.
Did you say power of love?
err it was intended that the control room blew up
Nothing can stop shem ha from going berserk
is off now.
The feedback system
serious binging there
ugh.
>people comparing gear to MHA
on the localization?
then what do we get
rip
.
i mean it was for a righteous motive
he acted like a true villain
Let me say that i loved Fudou part
Yes
she realized what she had done
Yatsuhiro died
after what happened
utterly destroyed
is emotionally broken
Well tsubasa
leave the dead be
no please
i would have been disappointed
if it was some kanade flashback
I'm glad too
she did what she had to do
and regarding basa
OH GAIJIN PIC
gaijin reaction where
oh so
it's a matter of breaking down the relic
2 ssj can exist
like 2 gungnir exist
comes down to just a puny tiny thing
that a full mirror
i don't want to think
i think different
when he said that
fudou had a sightly nostalgic face
but i want to know who is the dead person who made it
SSJ faust robe
we understood where SSJ came out
oh and finally
~~ noblered/stay dead ~~
suffering.
what shem ha has done
i don't want to think miku reaction when she will realized
Ooooh god
top tier alchemist
we got carol now
and don't forget
alchemy
eeeeh but
no i don't think so
they deserve at least a farewell scene
since they died too quickly
i'm conflicted about that
Rofl yeah
since we are talking about :
1) Cyborg can be repaired
2) Vampire, give her blood she will regenerate
3) Lycan, give her blood she will regen
But i think they're not dead
Millarc got cut in 4
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<@!256802531584376833> did you enjoy noble red getting sliced
rofl
and come on sunglasses during the night 😂
getting wiped out by noises
squad
what about ogawa
Oh well that was dope
and confirmed.
fudou is 100+
you kidding me?
70 years?
Fudou is insanely strong, i don't think you can restrain him
bam into the ground
40 meters suplex
a lot.
we did yesterday
Hah
Goddamn it.
Ama no murakumo is kusanagi no tsurugi second name
> checks
-> I value my murakumo more than my life
solo said "fudou will pull out kusanagi"
and then
well yeah she's pretty good
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
but St germain trio was great
adam is a bad character
i don't like axz just cuz
Well
it was a waste to let kusanagi break like that
and even if i went in overhype
Yeah
for breaking the same law he approved
And big fucking lol about fudou getting a mandate of arrest
slain by kamiku
or he will die
I think that fudou can still overtake the situation
Gen didn't want to let tsubasa become a monster
Well
I mean, why should he back down?
idk why
gen will regret stopping basa
that Fudou wont back down
Anyways i'm still sure
it depends
hmmm
~~then the man of the truth becomes maria's ghost instead of serena~~
by reconstructing her memories
but i'm happy to see that carol didn't lose her way of thinking
-> no more geahs -> norma life -> Carol lasthits kamiku and brings her back to normal life
is still behind the corner
Bittersweet ending
and it's not his innate ability?
to fudou
Could be that murakumo gave that violet power up aura
oh i was thinking
The show me the end of the world
Have the scene that quotes utena uploaded somewhere
Does someone
Cool stuff
With the signs
Oh so that was what fudou channeled there
Rip
Damn
Eeeh i was a bit too excited to cry there but i got hit by the wave of sadness
Poor yatsuhiro
And focus on kamiku
Then we get ep 10
Come on 2 days
This is so sad
man i'm amazed it's one of the most beautiful songs made by nana
listening full defender z brand
I'm
Exactly
That maria face
Oh dear
Lmao
Already made a ticket
Well i'm ready to board the hype shinkansen tomorrow
Hmmm
Hands up
Hmmm i somehow doubt he was referring to the trio
Is long gone
Who made the thing
Fudou said that the person
Hold on
The plot ends
So in any instance where s villain wins
Carol world destruction
Ver human extinction
Fine world domination
Everything would be fine in any case a gear villain won
Dino
He will stand down
I still don't think
The evil laugh
Tho i gotta admit that fudou is my favourite villain so far
I knew someone was going to mention those so i prevented
He would become op
Are you that scared of fudou henshin
Murakumo activating
*not the meme one*
I wanted fudou henshin
I admit that
No that would be cool
I want side with fudou option
Symphogear VN where
Lol that would have been 1:1
Bikki = shirou
So <@279341087494242304> that means
Lol the meter
Fudou kinda acted as zouken
Hah
*[Grand battle 1/1]*
*what will you do if i become a bad person*
Miku called it in ep 2
Well guys
Watch out suffering is behind the corner
Solo
She killed more than the hero
Come on
Just don't
I will go mad
And if they give me redeemed millarc crap
Lol i want to see how noble red will be saved with no blood
Ssj deletes things
Ehh
Is a possible thing
Bittersweet ending with no more geahs but normal life
I will  say this again
When the submarine comes out
To board tomorrow
But i already made my ticket for hype train
I'm not hyped for those
Strenght++
Self suggestion power
Sakimori blood
~~so if i get a certain boy with red hair replicating it it wont work~~
Nooo
So divine blood
He could be susanoo descendant
Insane strenght
Sakimori blood
But he got murakumo
Look i'm theorizing here
Sakimori blood
And ssj can delete gung ir
There should be
 A limit to what gungnir can do
Meh
at that point
he was a relic hybrid specimen
since he wasn't human anymore
He actually dies
or 11?
ver death is in gx 12
no meant
LOL?
ver asked something to maria
<@152896851660505088> please remind me, how was it?
*the worst*
maria am i a hero?
SHINJITSU NO HITO
❤
^
^
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
i want him to trigger the end
exactly
yeah
i hope he doesn't get blasted randomly
Yeah
FUDOU NEXT STEP
I'M EAGER TO WATCH
BUT
it wil be a bittersweet ending
yeh
ugh i should stop repeating that
no more gear ending
i still see the possibility of
resurrected them
but     PHONIC GAIN
They were almost dead
Well well in s1 case
anyways fakeouts are good if well used
rany please that.
god.
he's dangerous
from gear
please keep urobutcher away
LOL MISO
that's an open wound.
that melua
Lol
man that scene was deep.
*Maria was i able to become an hero?*
*yeah, the worst*
it was ep 12 gx
^ cultured user spotted
imho
empty villain
in AXZ
adam is the problem
There's the shock value there
The dream doesn't end up in long term memory and poof.
It's science
and you will have it on the paper
ehhh but you wont forget it in that way
i did it several times and it worked
and on the paper.
you will burn it into your memory
is write it down
you must do to not forget a dream
first thing
that would have killed the mood
LOL
EH
something like that
she fell from ozone stratum
eeeeh
"Hey yo now i make you in debt"
OH WHAT ABOUT TRUMP
eh
We dunno if those handcuffs are special material
at this point.
he's lawful evil confirmed
after losing
well since he surrendered
eh
i meant the thing itself
Leave ghost duet aside
Fudou surrendering like that was unexpected
screw bikki one, that one is awful
so far
Dmji amalgam is the coolest amalgam
Noble red power ups are cool
so gj kaneko you made it
noble red to survive like that.
I DID NOT EXPECT
Ok let me say it bluntly
dess
Ready go
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
100/100 DMJII AMALGAM
HERE
I?m
OK
it's on the moon
How
not getting another spotlight
And i'm disappointed at carol
D:
and meso stuff
but you can't just mix norse
i know it sounds cool
Yggdrasil is Norse mythology
the heck is this connection Yggdrasil and shem ha
Uhm now now
Hmm i don't think so
finally.
and it's not world domination/world destruction/salvation of humanity
unveiling the true aim of shem ha
but yeah it was a nice episode
a lot.
She is pretty
~~if the rollback plan succeeds i want gilgamesh encounter~~
it means 3000 BC
ù
rollback
5000 years
she said
no
I AGREE LOL
could be?
Hm
but amalgam ruined the fun
they got cool powerups
giving her a personality
that was nice too
Yeah
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT?
yeah
OH HELLO SOLO
of that fight
But yeah, elsa is the moral winner
❤
MORE BEAUTIFUL DRESS
OH AND HOORAY
there will be no coming back
Now if the fusion with miku proceeds
is very pretty
Oh Shem ha true face design
else what would the final ep give us? heart attack?
what else what else, the episode is not godlike, but of course we need a buildup "cooled down" ep
:'d
DESS
Just leave it as
into yes?
for translating DESS
at CR
can i be pissed
LOL
wot
hm?
come on shoot we are blasting ourselves here
so many questions
so little answers
yeah
would be curse of balal shutdown
the only thing that would happen
if they shut down the ruins
uhmmm that's a nice question
yeah
vambrace!
enki
Fine would be still alive
5000 years rollback
just think what hell of a plot blast it would become
lol
anyways putting stuff aside i would want kamiku suceed too
hands up
from GX
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/b/b2/Yubel-JP-Anime-GX-NC.png/revision/latest?cb=20150102012518
<@152896851660505088>
i remember yubel being a she
no
not sure
hm yubel? hmmm
^
eh
i guess there is air and the ruins are pressurized
rewatch the scene after the ed
in the ruins thingy
oh they are
so enki was shem ha enemy
true annunaki
he starts singing
final boss
Tony Glazer
true <:Ver:336656981144109066>
*runs away*
and becomes final boss
it eats shem ha
then we find nephilim on the moon
Lol solo
was over the line
Oh that percentage
COPY PE?
is still on kamiku back
hm the SSJ controlling thing
dearimasu?
i would not tl that
i mean
Yeah it's alright
oh true the basa death flag
I WAS LIKE "LMAO"
AND THAT VANESSA FRAME
that's why i'm a bit mad
you don't have to tl dess
Exactly millhu
So solo, solomon symphogear edition confirmed
^
STOP STEALING MY THOUGHTS
https://puu.sh/EeygO/6abb4e35ca.jpg
DAMN U
WAS GOING TO LINK IT
I
HOLD ON
sugita?
who solo?
each one in its unique way
i think all Gear va's are top tier
yuka iguchi ftw
as kamiku
sounded exactly the same
Index under john's pen
WAIT
Lol?
.
last time they had carol
how do you even phonic gain that
eeeh i dunno krika
you want urobutcher writing the script?
NO COME ON
^
hey the hero died
she is clearly suicidal right now
that raises a death flag
eeeeh
trump jinxed it
LOL
enki vambrace?
D:
i know but...
it's "meh"
while we are clearly talking about babal.
well i want to see next ep since mixing in with norse myths
hm
just because you're wrong it doesn't mean you're right
true
lol
now that you point it out
the shape is nearly the same
Lol it reminds me true form of shiroe's staff from log horizon
it was a cooler scythe yeah
(i should stop fanboying mechas)
how cool can you get???
come on a fucking cyborg clone
expecially Shirabe's one
i freaking loved dmjii one
but i have to admit
i still don't like amalgam
"at least " you say
why she couldn't?
I'm pretty sure she could
UH
As i say i think the ruins are pressurized
with no offence but lol, that would have been the biggest fail in the series
vs Shem ha / noble red
murricans
i mean i would have wanted to see
i mena
if basa didn't act suicidal
Yes
anyways
please kaneko
then demon pillars
First HF Symphogear shotfires
😂
[Childhood end]
Woh
from me?
who?
😦
but yeah the "hold on" was literally cuz i was screenshotting the "Pillar"
their ending
the gear users will have to earn
i just want that
yeah
That silver transmutation
or what
i mean we are surpassing 7b PHONIC GAIN DA
A percent of a thousand
kaneko reveals the mecha checklist
think if after gear ends
Lmao
damn u vanessa
are we going full srt now
oh
LOL
JUST WHY?
WHY
that measuring tape.
let's talk about
ofc it is
LOL
but i agree
Index with john's pen*
10/10
sorry
Shem ha = yubel
Melua you lost
but shem ha design is surely something worth of note
Of course sorano
*a lot*
Yeah
shemha*
world rollback 10/10
let's let kamiku win
BUT YEAH
it's not the mixing itself
i just don't sit right with this one
.
custodian confirmed
CC
WAIT WHAT
just don't let elf9 do things
Well carol for sure
LOL
.
and sadly millhi was right, condition red was just for show
the god killing fist wont be enough
i think if shem ha manages to recover more of herself
*laughs in seraph*
<@279341087494242304> in b4 the gear users are in moon cell
[FINAL GRAND BATTLE 1/1]
i think that gear users can manage atmospheric re-entry once they get into the upper layer
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
falls
in b4 the moon
but not enough phonic gain for that i guess
XD
i will be disappointed.
and not leave me with Bikki solves everything crap
NOH
solve the problem
don't let bikki
no no please
-> explodes
"the rocket is what yatsuhiro left behind"
that's a dogma
krika
idk tho
a movie?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
we have genious mods
"For symphogear XV *and maria*"
THE NAME OF THE CHANNEL
I'VE JUST READ
HAH
"eeedess"
ty
where is the GAIJIN REACTION PIC?
people
oh
no i don't want the chipmunk voice there
Eeeeeeeh
That's another case ofc
original body shem ha?=
oh you mean
index john's pen
it's yuka
no solo
10/10
damn if she is
Copy pe
**SHEM HA DRESS**
but there is ONE "good" thing in this
!
3k Before christ
it would be more fun!
rollback the world
just let shemha
i will mark that millhi
LOL
no matter what the hell basa thinks of it
ame no habakiri is a sword
but it got wrecked.
was conceptual too
but the autoscorer sword breaker
Eeeeh
ik
(if shemha completes the fusion)
enough to kill a full fledged god?
is antigod gungnir FRAGMENT
from a logical standpoint
I mean let's view the thing
.
i wont accept that
MARIA AMALGAM
best amalgam
got jii amalgam
lol
the army knife was bad in that scene
i agree
yes
more they tried more they got far from their aim
let me say that because poor vanessa lost it
that reaction
Oh i liked
noble red obtained the opposite of what they wanted
it's pretty sad in a way what happened
by raising his sakimori blood potential
topgrandad
just think if she powered up
Lol
in b4 shitaya noriko
*death beeeam*
FRIEZA
LOL
spit it out
Go
it would be rendoundant
i would rather not keep yukachi
Look if she gets original body
but after seeing 300+ series i focus on some
i don't know them all
if i see that doable
i don't know
.
high five.
it's one of my fav vas
then i go die directly.
Risa taneda
in b4
LOL THAT
Kana hanazawa?
yeah
.
lol
in b4 they repair kadingir
and no more gears but happy endings.
they break.
it becomes too much for the relics to bear
WITH MY PREDICTION
XD + AMALGAM WOULD MATCH
OH BUT
i don't know
i don't even like apple
D:
legit.
SPACE MUSIC
with no phonic gain???
on the moon?
how the heck are they going to trigger XD
no please
lol
lol
I LOVED IT
SAME
ask the person directly it's better
eeeh
can't say it :x
😂
it's not first on the chat
LOL
WHAT HE MEANT
NO NO I UNDERSTOOD
it will be the weirdest shit.
oooh i want to see chris amalgam
😂
but yeah it's surprising how we are going full fate here, we got the pillar!
D:
BUT BUT!
D:
Condition red was just 4fun.
you called it.
can i be angry at you?
oh and millhi
OFC
lmao
chris got chuuni with her revolvers
*BANG*
they threw the stone, they can't back down on this
give me full body shemha
please yes
look it's fine
Lol
it will work if you try that
with Nasuverse mechanics
you can esplain Gear
i think the problem is that
ROLLBACK PLEASE
SHEM HA GIFF 5000 YEARS
no hero
~~in the end everyone will die on the moon cuz angelica cage~~
Counterforce wouldn't let gil do that
Lol
no?
dbz has planet busters
rofl
Lol
in this channel?
can i ask why are we talking about Nasuverse powerlevels
cuz uncle counterforce gets angry
Ea is limited if used on earth
hmmm it depends
something something *chomp*
yeah he isn't
work?
<@279341087494242304> would asking columbus for advice about sailing the seven seas
chomping on shem ha
i think that nephilim would have tried
*coughs*
*flac*
*looks at that thing on a certain tracker website*
LOL
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Ai beats apple!
that
so this means
Lol
uuuh
as the subreddit main page says?
THis means fine was not in love with shem ha
who put it
isn't the god
Then Shem ha
damn.
10/10
Shem ha = the babal curse god
this is true if
Wait wait
LOL
10/10
hell that dress
else it's no fun!
kaneko
anyways back to xv, please give us full body shem ha
yeah
a freaking demon pillar.
we even got
but the best one is shirabe
same
Dreaming is always good
Enki
This is my hypothesis
Then shemha is not that god
If the curse was put to stop shem ha
Fine was in love with the god that put the curse of bslal
Anyways <@115744398997716995>
It's a 1999 novel
Sns is a milestone of its time
Coughs fumina konoe filler
After 8 years watching sns
I'm still angry with yuuji
Keep that serpent away from me
Oh god that reference
In the way
Since there's the ruru ameru
Hero we need lore to confirm their reason
Gz trump did it again
Coming out from the mummy
Oooih now i connect the cyan hairs
Yes
Yeah kaneko could have used some other myth, not stuff from norse, since shemha is in theory middle eastern
?
And what's the deal with yggdrasil of *freaking norse myths*
A big chunk of lore is missing
Hmmm, why would a goddes rule the world? We must discover why enki was her enemy
As far as we know she doesn't like curse of balal
Hmmm, i don't think that's all
*are you sure you want to restore this backup?* Press yes to confirm
No world domination, no world destruction, no chaotic hero, just a freaking rollback of 5000years
Is the coolest of the bunch of villains
Anyways shemha aim
<@279341087494242304> funny how you can just explain kamiku as pseudoservant <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Miku getting expelled at some point is also a possibility
She was rebuilding her body in the chamber after all
Yes
Imho
Yubel from ygo is a closer match
I don't have words to describe it
If shemha wears that dress
?
Desu is another thing
The true dess needs to be left untled
If added at the end of the sentences
Desu adds a certain shade
Ikik
Like the last one when they were in line could have been avoided <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
In xv
Surely they're close to overdoing dess mental tick
Dess
I really appreciate joe, millhi & friends work there
Yt does a wonderful job
Shiru = to know
Such a simple line
Lol
Do not make sense
Some episodes parts from cr
I swear
In tea.
Do you prefer cr mistranslating atatakaimono?
During first gx half
Hibiki doesn't have the determination to fight
It still works in a plot standpoint
No no meme aside
Sounds better
Well hold a determination to fist
Ichii bal
I guess we will discover xv tagline soon
Nice.
Oooh
Yeah with that the moon will fall disappear and then
~~In b4 the hero gets resurrected and absorbs divine power to create a world with the light god could not know~~
(damn if i love brainstorming )
Sorry fine
Since enki clearly said
Why enki has put the curse up
Fine prolly doesn't know
Obviously
Told you
Heh
Fudou best villain
Thanks indeed
Woh
Yeah
And if shemha true form wears it i will die
It's just outstanding
Everyone loves that dress
~~in b4 urobuchi writes ep 12-13~~
With her dress
Full body shem ha
Just give me
[final battle 1/1]
Demon pillar yggdrasil
Damn
While geahs are no more!
Carol will end the season with a blast!
Uuuh
I heard you dislike noises melua
Overhype
I wasn't able to sit down when k2 got sliced
Song vs k2 was better
Eeeh
Cuz skill 15?
It still haunts my dreams
Goddamnit
.
That that
the could go on overload
if the relics can hold xd and amalgam at the same time
We don't know
10/10
lol that youjo aoi yuuki discussion
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
SORE DE AI
HAH
like a certain red haired boy
rip
to be used on shemha
lol solo yesterday i was thinking would meodp be powerful enough
from shem ha when she takes her former body
miku will get purged
at most
Lol
it's phylosophical weapon vs another one
ssj will blast gungnir before that happens
following that reasoning
Solo
*self-proclaimed goddess
shemha is a goddess
that was raw divine power
no please.
if they do that right, she could be the coolest character of the series
to see shem ha full body
I can't wait
oke
Killsteal?
a KS?
like carol butting in and closing the deal would be muuuch better
D:
that i wouldn't like that?
can i say
lol
by our heroines manage to beat shemha anyways
where all the gears gets erased
that's why i think that we will have a certain bittersweet ending
Yes
is prefect.
no her current headset
would work on shemha
i wonder if antilinker
before accomplishing that
they will die probably
hm
carol is still there they do not need elf9
yeah..
i really want shemha to become complete
but as i said several times
if kaneko beats us i will laugh
lol dino you should calm down
ooooh
i was referring to solo and wfc
to mop things
shemha is too pretty
you two are evil
it's sheer teasing.
that.
no melua, you can't remember me
with golden font
final scene will be "metanoia"
right now i was thinking
trump'd
they got
WELL
i'm losing myself to the discussion here
amalgam seems on will
you mean amalgam?
getting spaced.
an human being can experience
painful death
it's the most
something like that
*no pressure
~~just throw urobutcher at gear~~
pick one.
or anima ataraxia
*childhood's end plays in background*
with or without miku dying
Anyways millhi giff eiai promise pls
Oh i need to check that then
Hmmm?
Did i miss something?
The dmjii reply
What about
I need to listen it
Woot
Defender z brand is unbeatable
But
All geah songs are good
Fanatic in her love
Hmm
But miku is pretty
Dmjii are pretty explicit that they're in relation
for 70k?
she had godlike reaction there
for a second i tought basa was going to fail and impale the poor girl
come on.
she's a mass murderer
-> 70k
-> Milaarc
but you can't redeem nr at the same time
but i can understand that, fudou is not redeemable but
you know i'm not sure of that
hm
danes will interfere in gear final episode!
IT's a secret plot!
oh ok
a dane?
Are we zeoning here melua?
Why? Fudou did it for the greater japan!
Lol
More buff
Fudou 2.0
Like how shemha powerupped nr, she could have done the same to topgrandad
I wanted him taking advantage of shemha
Surrendered
I'm sad that fudou
We need more yukachi singing
But yes
I was just calling it
I know eiai promise already
What
?
Ty millhi
Or ai no tame? <:Ver:336656981144109066>
We will have metanoia in the final scene
Today
So guys as saki teased me
Ogawa'd includes modern ninja techniques
Gg
Is ogawa'd
It's not ninja'd anymore
Look guys
I will check the texts
Sugita was spotted getting outside the studios
if we are talking about that
well
anyways i think that carol will have to blast yggdrasil while our heroines fight shemha
damn kaneko
<@279341087494242304> today i was beating salem demon pillar, it gear was stuck into my mind during the whole fight
rururira
*SEKAI NO HATE MISETE KURE*
and to
it was to stop the geahs
i forgot that.
vanessa raided los alamos
Oh no
like 10 people?
Vanessa is the one that has lower killcount
It was fudou behind them all the time
alone with noises.
the american carrier.
Elsa raided
No
hmmm
anyways elsa?
it's a 70% fatality rate
we got 70k
no i'm not assuming that
we are there.
it was like 95k
if it wasn't 100k
it was full melua.
30k managed to flee
100k was the approx
no 70k is confirmed
i surrender <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
point taken.
THOSE
in b4 the solomon cane gets out from GoB again
custodians noises
that was ridiculous
Lol the banana noises
they were just a straight out ~~5/7~~ 10/10
well elsa made those in theory
10/10
SIEGWAY NOISE
being just 4 show
i'm still mad at condition red
let me say that.
would have been a blast
Divine noise
LOL HERO
SYMPHONOISE
sad story
i always laugh like an idiot when i see that.

what the true gear protag is
better remind ourselves
in the end
it's the character have less background of
but i would have wanted some kind of flashbacks
if he was to appear at this point
as much as i love ver anyways, he would damage the series
better than nothing i guess
but he admitted he's useless
no i still can't bring myself to like topdad
Ver and topdad are the magic words
Are you trying to provoke the usual discussion there hero?
miso. no.
no
like the LAST ACTION HERO
Time to save the world
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
i feel you
hah
sunriiiise
in b4 millhi works at satelight
you've been there millhi!
this means
random googled grape noise
https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/d7a0ab2f-531a-474c-8e27-c2e785e1ef14/d6nyq3a-d14d9e31-94eb-4714-b0d0-169bae311b1e.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2Q3YTBhYjJmLTUzMWEtNDc0Yy04ZTI3LWMyZTc4NWUxZWYxNFwvZDZueXEzYS1kMTRkOWUzMS05NGViLTQ3MTQtYjBkMC0xNjliYWUzMTFiMWUuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.3r1kPU1dVolxy7-Oc2hZfU0Kz4d_44UMVcUyB7u83So
unlimited grapekun works
i mean just think, he just respawns those bombs
ALONE
he can drop those bombs without limit
are you even joking?
they created i think
is the most powerful noise
Grapekun
Oh
than bananas
CORNS
they look more like
Hold on
it will become a dwarf star
not massive enuff
the sun cannot go into supernova
as long as i know
you don't want to step it up more
it's already a walking reference
fudou has the best one
you have a lot to learn for evil laughs
having to fight kamiku can break her
well bikki IS suppressing all her mental pain
solo
ttgl is doing bad things to you
shemha is prettier than miku
that's a gain/gain
This would be legit
^
just for the sake of forcing happy end
and wont adopt an half assed ending
i just hope kaneko will do justice
D:
miku can't return to her formed bodyu
if that succeeds
ofc it's different if shemha doesn't go full power
but there should be a limit to what a FRAGMENT OF A RELIC can do vs a Full Fledged God
philosophical armament all you want
WELL
rofl
to read the manga
but yeah, you're not the first suggesting me
.
right yesterday
i ate mango
10/10
i watched only the first movie
that reminds me i have to recover some Ghost in the shell.
as far as we know only her head is organic
that inorganic material can't act like that.
no one said
i suppose they're talking about her
matou
|| sakura's mind was getting deleted ||
Well hold on solo
indeed
Lol
vore?
GIFF MORE SHEMHA
YEAH
getting devoured
miku
that's some huge downgrade
LOL
52 PICS
HAH
lol
that's what i'm saying
ikr.
(just how cool sounds now that i understand japanese more now? FREAKING GENKI DAMA)
is from king kai
Genkidama
~~while frieza asks for immortality and to be restored you mean?~~ù
well solo, friendship didn't help in favor of a certain redheaded boy
Light^
just to get completed shemha
but honestly? kill me for saying this, i would want miku to get deleted
it would make sense
but yeah i agree
i've read wrong
Oh no solo my bad
so do you assume an internal conversation?
hmmm
but just think of **how bikki will break soon**
poor miku, she will *suffer* so much
conflicted about that pic
I feel
~~those things around miku, so HFish~~
would kill me.
training arc with 3 eps
and no please
want those <@216181207874928640> ? https://symphogear-xv.com/next/XVnext11.php
previews and screens
we got
and frontier was essentially fused with neph
was a piece of frontier
calm down, the tower that ver shoot to the moon
G
that would be a shock.
and divine power
and it eats shemha
in b4 nephilim is on the moon, since frontier = nephilim and nastassja flew to the moon
well device aside, she still has ssj anyways
to rebuild her entity
Yes
my only doubt about that, is the control device installed on ssj
it's a thing that should not be forgotten, nothing stops shemha from blasting the relics
Shemha has SSJ
do not forget one important thing
anyways back on track
dess
Kerrik, do you eat memes for breakfast?
LOL
hah nice question
will make gear more famous
but on the other side of the coin
No i feel you
but they're overdoing it
it's fine to have *some degree* of those
yeah crunchy should tune the spoilers down
rofl
let's appreciate this for another second.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ83K3nXv6M
yeah lol
~~well hf you know~~
retracking from EP1
is XV going?
so solo, how much close to your expectations
it's is blatant baiting
Lol
rly?
EEEH
they're taunting us
HAH
with amalgam
Zerk Bikki
in b4
i bet on it
Bikki will just break
can i pretend like half episode filled with zetsubou and such?
*at least*
HOW MUCH SUFFERING WILL GET SCREENTIME?
but the question is just one
THAT
And yeah i didn't think like that
But there they were in the outer atmosphere and started singing thus they became music
G one is the most abstract
Gx one made sense
Well the meteoroid did fall
Creating history means modifying the past
It doesn't change much my point then
True true <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Aaargh i flashed
to do what exactly then?
create a world with the light god could not know
if it is not metaphorical then world reset is real?
but yeah i'm hard thinking at the keysentence of the season
and becomes a god
in b4 miku overtakes shemha
D:
and no kaneko i wont accept the air bubble without XD <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
or they will be spaced if the walls go down.
means that the girls can't go full power
anyways being in the lunar ruins
(so divine noise vial where)
would be doable.
Hijack Yggdrasil
uh true
hands up
i'm hyped.
TOMORROW WE FLY
but yeah
Fudou would have secured it 10/10
legit way of thinking.
hm?
what way?
But i agree that's a stretch
Giff original shem ha kaneko!
How can a faust robe turn vs its owner
Ehm ssj is a philosophical armament
Open batto!
was beautiful
millarc full power
LOL THAT SOLO
and she got one hell of personality
10/!0
JUST HOW PRETTY IS SHEMHA FULL BODY?^
OK GUYS
10/10 maria frames
10000/10000
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
the heck i just saaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwww
HEre
I?m
OK
oooh i want to see hibichris unison
Lol hero
her neuro connector blew up
yeah
poor elza
so what else what else
Gj kaneko achievement unlocked
going on
and for once we got a pretty intricate plan
yeah the plot took a pretty cool twist
lol millh
it wont be so bad!
can we let her win?
prettyyyy
Wait what
Ver?
****RURURIRA****
except
to stop shemha on earth
Oh cool how there's no one
what doctor
or she doesn't know the reason
anyways my theory was correct, enki made curse of balal but fine doesn't know it
shiva would go haywire
Lol
so my theory was correct
Enki made the curse of balal
Demon pillars confimed
so what else
10/10
Miku getting devoured was on spot
Shem ha is beautiful and she is at least for me best villain in the series
So anyways let's settle the facts down
referencing around
That's kaneko
this
^
with the pillars
so i guess we are going full solomon confirmed
<@279341087494242304>
GJ KANEKO
and we got them
we needed those explanations
even if the pace slowed down
it was a nice episode
https://symphogear.fandom.com/wiki/Fushich%C5%8D_no_Flamme
the revival of fushichou no flamme
to appreciate
let's sit for a moment
i will get diappointed
it wont be like "bikki oneshots it"
i just hope
eeeeh
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
no certain red haired boy this time around
same
Same
manages to complete the body transformation
goddess
what can you smash if our beautifuyl
miku is getting devoured
ehm
yeah
10/10
i was like "WHO REALLY? THAT SONG?"
SONG
MARIA X BASA
I DIDN'T EXPECT
OH YEAH
so what else...
that's busted
it's like trying to use a usb port
^
she's no more!
no saving miku allowed
No
oh yeah
LOL
that miku wanted shemha
DID SAY
Well solo shemha
she's getting eaten
PULLING SHERYL NOME HERE
EEEEH
ver's arm, i bet they're keeping it secured
not all of it
and becomes the final boss
eats shemha alive
in b4 fragment of nephilim
yeha
^
Sugita wont fit the situation
just how?
he's dead
i don't understand why
why ver coming back?
we solomon now
that's why i said
and the EARTH IS NOW DIED IN RED
the pillars
HAH
yes
they attacked it kinda
attacked the coffin
We basically failed because a certain american government
cuz Coffin-kun
neither should yours
as my idea with sugita doesn't work
no <@279341087494242304>
No
she wanted to rule the world
yeah true
hmmm
in b4 anon is involved with shemha plan and is supporting her from the shadows
*GAIJIN REACTION WHERE*
NOW THE WEEKLY QUESTION
SO SO
no never mind, there's the coffin.
it would have triggered shemha revival.
kept up with the plan
if our last action hero
now now hold on a second
that enki created the curse to stop shemha
but she doesn't know
Fine was enki's lover
Fine relevance?
😂
hardly.
shemha plan fails
if carol restarts world bysection
just think
eh they will literally die if she doesn't do something
at this point.
butting in
i expect carol
Anyways
7 days
now i gotta wait
but ugh
the episode was pretty good anyways
and final form.
at it's finest
*animation budget*
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
from playing with grail kun
you don't go back
true true
millhi?
you want solo revolting
Okay 😂
Lol
is not the black grail right?^
you profile pic is a... cat right?
Voyeur
Melua pointed those out
nice episode
but yeah i'm happy
it's fun how you guys assume we get movies
*retreats*
i got confused
wrong noriko
no nevermind
GG FOR ME
LAST WEEK
THE OTHER TIME
I CALLED NORIKO
uh
and ~~shemha = frieza ~~
Takeshi kusao = future trunks
oh i see
THE PUNS
shemha would have won millenias ago
didn't have the guts to cut of his own arm
so if enki
i damn agree
Yeah
i still hate beef stroganoff
D:
no pls
LOL THE BONDED GAIJIN
OOOOH
humans would have found the thing
well of course sooner of later
^
he triggered shemha.
LOL
ONE MORE REASON THEN
left behind by tiki
the data
oh
How melua?
coming out
he didn't know about the coffin
if earth is shemha domain...
Eeeh but
and enki is dead.
since shemha was locked down
his plan was utter nosense.
to hate adam
one more reason for me
so
something like that?
Eh
like a kid who received his gift
but i forgot since i was overhyped
i felt lost
Wtf CR THERE?
yeah
oh
LOL DENDROBRIUM
going full srt again
melua i expect vanessa
argentlam is of course the key
~~makoto draivu furu barsto~~
YEAH
always welcome 10/10

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
copy pe??
LOL HERO
D:
i will go mad
alone
if AI brings miku back
look
no more relics to control it.
no it wont
that would work
lol hero
of recreating her persona
otherwise she wouldn't have gone trough  the hassle
the sleeping
i think it's just a temporary thing
to solve the issue down
it's up to carol
i mean
~~moon race will get angry~~
mobile armor confirmed
same
this time
They can't just XD away
the possibility
i wont discard
could be you know
oh
i don't remember this
carol caused by sugita?
wait what?
and how the heck are they supposed to teleport down
HQ is dead.
if carol doesn't do something
but yeah
.
i liked that
LOL
major spoiler of the fanfic
so it's a superior being for humans.
as far as we know that alien created humans
solo

both impaled
ENKI IS POOR MAN'S KAMINA
I SAID
eeeh.
eeeh
*looks at sydonia*
yeah you can do that flawlessy only by using CGs
lol melua
as explanation
well it's till better than receveing "it just works"
it's logical
well at least they gave us a logical explanation
and all.
there's air pressure
yeah
yeah
my bad
yeah yeah
oh
va?
who is enki

so kerrik
i didn't notice that
uhm
HELLO KERRIK
yggdrasil

they can't go nuclear again
as long with rotten text?
your psdt on lasting song hurts eh solo?
oh true
as a goddess
well shemha didn't declare herself
*DAMN IT KANEKO YOU DID IT* 
the only thing that can erase shemha from gene pools is SSJ
SSJ FAUST ROBE
NO NO NO
WAIT
NO
cuz even if bikki manages to kill ...
same.

oh
kaneko please
lol
no ok no drifting here
~~higher on the street~~
~~i've been in this place before? ~~
deja vu?
but loses at the same time
with SSJ
Shem ha deletes the relics
my prediction still stands
oh well
to do things
Shemha is a goddess, of course she uses raw divine power
noble red is pretty original
shemha ❤
PLEASE
no more kanade
EXACTLY AVATAR
and it's the most badass character of the series
she finished chardev
it's not pushed to the side

@demon pillars

it's a "i turn stuff into silver"

not you.

no no it was directed
i heard you liked that ear lick scene
ZENBU ZENBU ZENBUuu
another time in another channel avatar
since g, he indirectly caused shemha revival
it's all ver fault!
AND GUYS
gg
we sure of that?
than Ver's SSJ
Faust Robe of SSJ is supposed to be more powerful
remember one hit = no more relic
do you want to get lasered?

gang up
eeeeeeh
**AMALGAM ZERKER BIKKI**
GOGO
Zerker BIKKI
to fight shem ha like it's nothing
I wont believe if she accepts
in next episode
bikki to be mentally destroyed
Ehm i expect
but maria wild slapping
by using Kanade flashbacks
that Basa didn't break mind control
no well i'm happy
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
just don't
damn you seto kaiba you damaged my life.
"Fuck the schedule, i have money"
played:
i know my mind
Lol
you can't just mess up the schedule
well yeah
and the world ends.
in b4 ep 13 is a 48 mins episode
^
honestly i want to see how shem ha manages with the moon ~~cell~~ ruins still active
i will laugh if the closing song takes that name.
in b4 owari no babel
?_?
while the mirror blinds the viewer
tug pull
if no one was there to poke it
the coffin would have done nothing
they were searching for it
since hurr durr tiki coordinates
they dug it up
Coffin kun would have taken AGES to show up
no.
Eeeeeeh
Coffin-kun > shemha
no
since her beloved god is dead.
since she would have obtained just the language back
she would be so much disappointed
if fine actually killed the curse
headcannons always go big
in the bunch
Said the coolest person
lol
some of them shine later on while having a weak start
of decent light novels around, you just have to know what you want
hm there is a quite good amount
but still, how the heck are they supposed to remove shemha from human DNA
SSJ erases relics.
Faust Robe of SSJ
That or
only if gungnir gets erased in the process.
i can accept that
let's achieve the bittersweet ending!
but oi SSJ Faust robe is stunning as well
THE DRESS
I can't wait for bikki despair
Or our heroines will return in time
Carol will have to deal with yggdrasils around the world
Well
Those are not carol strings yeah
Hmmmm
Oooooooooh
Suffering is life
Yeah solo
So she wont know that she went mad for a misunderstanding
But fine is not around
Yeah
Poor man's kamina*
Fufu
No i got busted
Oh
No more geahs
I foresaw the ending
It means
Like 6-7 eps ago
I nailed it
If gt is right
I fucking nailed iiiiiiiitttttt
Uuuuuh
Uuuuuuuh
Giff carolnein
Please translate
I don't know
Hold on a bunch of kanji
Nice point akeupho
.
Just because there is oxygen it doesn't mean that bacteria are there for the decay
In your dreams
Shemha best villain
Yeash
Everyone knows that murica will go nuclear on the finale *again"
Lmao
Ye
We already had los alamos raided
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Will be called "ai no tame" with maria saying "the worst was right"
Then the ending scene
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
~~carol > useless elf9~~
I'm shivering just at the tought
Yukachi + yuuki duet
That would be great
Lol solo
Eiai promise + kimi dake ni
The confession is already made
You fools
Ehhh
I could get to japan with only one flight but it wpuld be very expensive
Well i live in italy and there's an international airport 40 km from my house
Joppy
I feel you pain
Exactly
Come on guys tomorrow is the third to last destination of the hype train
Nitro is nice
Gifs heh
Owari no babel
Will be Called
Last song
Heh
All relics will get erased imho
Kerrik ugh outspeeded
Leave brexit discussion for <#336297840529899522>
Ugh
Eeeh no please no redemption for nr
Same
Y
On earth to fight shemha
Well wfc now there's no one
Reading is love.
That was phonic gain
Lmao
Oh yeah active helping is different by passive help
Gx and axz helping were a genkidama situation
Just let carol finish the deal as all relics get erased by ssj faust robe
Alone.
I don't think gungnir is strong enough to face shemha
Shoot the earth from the moon!
Kadingir
Reverse
mb
oh
Raw episode is airing rn
spoilers
okay time to mute the channeò
so she will be even more powerful now that the curse is gone
SHEMHA DEACTIVATING THE CURSE
and HOLY... I DIDN'T EXPECT
to connect earth-moon
using the daedalus endo
ANyways, it was pretty logical
Amalgam+XD nailed it.
said
And whoever
Vanessa has a big killcount too
they could not be redeemed
look
I GOT, CAROL, NR death
10/10
I'M FREAKING OUT
THE EPISODE
I JUST SAW
OK
amazing
No no this ep was
let it out
come on solo
the barrier.
EXACTLY LIKE
she got shot and the bullet got deflected
oh <@486087033652248576> another shot to the neue ziel quote
HELLO SOLO
i mean kaneko managed to get murica to do somehting good
to stop shem ha was "lol"
trump going full hacker
oh and
but yeah i'm still freaking out at neue ziel vanessa
some were not
some were pretty
Eeeeh melua it depends
Chris amalgam was underwhelming
I have to agree
IT WAS 1:1
LOL
TEH HECK
VANESSA WENT FULL NEUE ZIEL
OH GUYS
finisher
but i didn't like her bow
Chris was very pretty
OH YEAH
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
yeah aoi yuuki is always at the top
oh
THAT WOULD BE A TWIST
LOL
HOLD ON
Wait what
or SSJ deleting stuff.
is either that
and they will get broken
Amalgam+XD will overexert the relics
but yeah
THANKS HERO
OH WE GOT IT
in the process
the gears getting destroyed
Anyways i expect
it's *vital*
HEY GUYS WHERE IS GAIJIN REACTION
Lol the bondage
thanks to the hero.
a freaking chain reaction
LOL
VER PROVOKED IT ALL
AS I SAID
YEAH
of Shemha DNA code
want to see how they will get rid
Yeah i still
she should have endured a bit more
and carol got beaten too easily
but i have to disapprove Chris amalgam
to sum it up
so yeah
D:
no please melua
trump won the game
Humanity went full hacker
they're the remnant of the souls that are burning only on the desire to save the world
the flame-like hair
on atmospherinc re-entry would explain
anyways the theory about the bunch being dead
basically
but this is [Advent beast 1/1]
No grail war this time around archer, go home.
https://puu.sh/EjOb7/75a338c6ba.png
LOL
from UBW
seemed like Archer
on the building
the show from above at Ogawa brother
Oh AND ONE THING
was 10/10
ogawa family
and blast her.
just go full 7b zesshou
it's CAROL
still
i expected something more flashy
the fight was weak
I know
it's incredible how that is thanks to trump
LOL
YEAH
but the fight didn't give her justice
Yea solo
i wished she wasn't beaten like that
She had her scene sadly
burned out
no carol time
yeah
SSJ purge shemha? possible but i'm not sure
and close the situation
but here you can't kill her soul
yeah, it's a problem similar to fine one
since she's in humanity dna
she will come back
even if Bikki kami goroshies her
"How do we kill Shemha now?"
and last thing that comes in my mind
Yes but she was forced by nephilim
So Maria had to sing Apple
he caused the Frontier incident
Yes
- weak amalgam design for chris
- trump helped in the end
- Ver was the catalyst of the situation
- Vanessa neue ziel confirmed
- XD+Amalgam is beutiful 
- stop giving screentime to topdad, worst character
- I didn't expect Shemha in succeeding at curse of balal deactivation
- ^ she will be even more power ful
- Faust robe of SSJ and beautiful dress ❤
she doesn't even have a reason to go along with bikki reasoning
but not with shemha
villains
Melua i'm FINE with all other
befriend shemha is the **worst** possible finale
PLEASE
NO
it's pretty different
the explanation she gave
it doesn't work like fine
melua
it's not a soul
eeeeh
but then how do you delete Shemha DNA from humans?
as i was saying it's possible that they beat shem ha and lose the relics
Eh solo
Yeah i guess
^
and interferes
breaks out
in b4 fudou
OWARI NO BABEL
IN b4
Opinions <:Ver:336656981144109066>
but oi
it's underwhelming
it's not wrong
they could not be redeemed
NR to die
tho i expected
please giff ogawa family spinoff
Ogawa family was cool
^
fight
after the fith
will break the relics
i think that the exertion
Even then millhi
SG died
for the same reason
too much energy
smol milaarc
Lol that bikki-chris shot
basically yes
lol
was great.
Yeah that shot of bikki
left the planet solo
Other custodians
not enough screentime to give that explanation
Yeah there's that too
with other villains
they had a reason
exactly
Lol
and genocide.
full Rururira
properly singing we would have gone
yeah if she was
it's a goddess come on
lol
i feel you
10/!0
pretty eh
on Ogawa family
Gear spinoff
in b4
LOL
*ichii ball*
it doesn't exist in myths
Ichiaval is a mistake
please.
let's mythbust that
No.
I have to agree with armados here
and cases like a poor madman get the "No background" treatment are dangerous you know
it's a matter that it just barely fits in 13.
no millhi
there would have been more space to flesh out so many situations
eh if gear had more episodes
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaC_FCoXFBM
hello crunchyroll
Hah
like 24 would be neat
eh
that one
hah
at current status
so guys overall how much far is gear from your predictions
i'm a bit tired sorry lol
true
Noble red
~~fudou did nothing wrong, he believed in his mission until the end ~~
the place was obviously Rome Coliseum
where they were escaping
i'm still curious about the part
eh it's because he went and saved them
what else?
from trump?
Maybe get a medal of honor
LOL
70k
>mind = blown
>neue zuel reference
>vanessa
and you can't really remove it
at the time
look kaneko got the mistake
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
let's read
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
that yeah
oh
well murica and friends were the ones who got close for starters
LAZERZ
if no one poked at it nothing would have happened
its role was to protect shemha
the coffin had no reason to do anything
i know millhi
the problem came when our proud heroes went there and poked at it
if he was programmed to defend.
why coffin kun would leave its place
i have just one doubt
Look about that
happened
and coffin kun
eh then tiki spoiled shemha location
even ver is not a bad guy compared to adam
I mean come on
D:
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
eeeeh
just because i get it it doesn't mean the other do
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Carol didn't go easy
she would have escaped
it will never get old.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ83K3nXv6M
let's take another moment to appreciate this
but but.
D:
with his hypocrisy
oh damn topdad
Bikki getting CHOMP'D
the huge flashback burns my mind everytime
Talking about neph
and assimilated her powers
i still think that nephilim would have eaten Kamiku alive
bikki activating x drive with durandal and amalgam
JUST THINK FOR A SECOND
in XV
durandal bikki
OH GOD
~~side with fudou option please~~
if it was a VN
actually gear would have been amazing
in a VN
i would easily see such thing
she died without knowing that enki did it for the world sake
i know right?
coffin kun.
there's just one variable to that
with kadingir
if Fine succeeded
gear would have gone
just think how DOWNHILL
wait wait
HAH
hah
i surrender lmao
well if you put it like that
I mean try to be in it's place
100 years later
coffin kun would have done nothing
here's the thing
but
5000 years rollback
let shemha win!
with SSJ on
in b4 shemha starts singing
~~meanwhile i open makyuu ichiaval.flac~~
she got much more serious in XV
but i have to recognize one thing at her
about bikki!
Shirabe was right
bikki is an hypocryte
miku deserves
I think it like this
the first time he appeared
RUNNING AWAY
when i first saw topdad
Lol i remember  when i had to pause
Oh that for sure millhi
yukachi x aoi yuuki duet, that would have been amazing
the situation is the same.
as Yamiyugi
think of carolnein
look
i mean they didn't sustain the thing for too much
i don't think everything got burned
Lol
true
of the hype train
it was the third to last stop
*PUT YOUR HANDS UP*
when he proposed to act by himself
Genjurou vs Shemha
i would have liked to see
anyways for a seconmd
yeah
how hackers can purge a divine artifact
i still find ridiculous
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
did you say hack?

Custodiandos
in a flash!
by SSJ
this is how you get erased
yes
pimp ogawa <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
SPINOFF WHEN
ogawa family
shemha should go full power now
are eastern european
yes maria and serena
-> shemha revival
so she had to sing apple
pushed maria in the tight spot
well in the end Ver and nephilim
shemha evil gaze emote required <:Ver:336656981144109066>
if my memory is working
after season ending
oh and some mod said something something about XV emotes
(i think we should organize a group rewatch when the season ends and/or when the BD gets released)
for YT for the rewatch
i will wait
so definitely.
well aoi yuuki went full screaming there
have grown so much
our heroines
(yay evil gods ftw)
*ruru ameru wa*
do you need an explanation for being an ancient human descendant?

*with some indians IT support guys joining the fray*
trump saves the world
*pimp ogawa*
as millhi said
i mean
https://puu.sh/EjOb7/75a338c6ba.png
i said like "Wtf archer, what are you doing there"
from afar
when i first saw ogawa brother
ai no tame <:Ver:336656981144109066>
say power of love?
did someone
😂
.
Arash's Craft Essence.
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fategrandorder/images/d/d7/210.png/revision/latest?cb=20160729075946
<@279341087494242304> <@152896851660505088>
Kanade had a much lower compability  rate
No
since you have to bear dainsleif too
not lessened
ignite worsened the backfire
hmmm
eh
she wasn't in AXZ too i think?
the backfire was greater in gx with gungir
with maria + argentlam at AXZ
at GX start
no compare maria with gungnir
than argentlam
backfire on gungnir
had a MUCH GREATER
eeeeh but maria
i think that gears will be no more at the end of last episode
but here's the thing
TRUE
OH
eeeh i know.
my bad there.
true
not a gear.
Eeeeh durandal was a full relic
Are we sure that bikki can even WIELD another relic?
*stella*
and we [Grand Battle] now
Arash interfered
we are already at solomon now solo
D:
i tought it was just the anti-divine
i missed this
really?
like a very skilled fighter
Yeah i think on personal skil solo
so kanade would have kami goroshi stuff too
it's gungnir that has those
No
on linker
but she was technically dependant
Personal skill
Hold on i'm not talking about
but that just doesn't sit
what else has been left out?
hm?
so yeah it's just repairing the damage
yeah
to change his mind
he's too much lawful
no.
but my mind would have wanted him out
ikr
bigger than Ver appearance in GX
and a big one to booth
WOULD BE A NUMBER
THAT
he's not boring
.
and another one with Fudou adventures
with ogawa family
Give me a spinoff
IF HE DOES
LOL
he believed in what he did
a lawful evil to the core
he was cool
no come on
but we got no time for that
i would have liked him not surrendering
i'm sad that it ended like that
eeeeeeeeeeh
that would explain his strenght going up as well
as "he didn't activate it"
explained
eeeeh that could be still
113 years old
fudou best villain
or at least chipped.
A regular katana would have already broke
We sure?
i'm still laughing at how we nailed it.
i still remember on how we were joking about him pulling out kusanagi
activating murakumo
we went close on fudou
WELL
and fudou snatched it
think if SONG still had durandal
d-d-dainsleif
then we would get meteoroid'd
oh
we sure millhi?
exactly
to doom us?
i think the moon disappearing would be enough
true
yeah
the moon will get a weird rotation if moved from such an angle
how a slingshot works
that's not
it was kadingir moving the orbit away
that's not very true
hold on
no no
and killing the ending
from no where
it's even worse than Sugita cackling around
ending.
possible
worst
What route?
we had her Yu gi oh'd
to make elfnein useful
it's incredible how
i forgot that
*rururira*
OH
you gotta rebuild it from scratch
Lol
the jammer got vaporized millhi
it's not a mere soul
but she will come back
i mean, sure you kill her again
from humans.
i'm still clueless at HOW they're going to delete shemha dna
One thing about destroying a god
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
to bow down to the evidence?
you asking a nationalistic glorious nippon
why he should change his mind?
he's lived more than 100 years
with the character
she needs to learn from <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Probably yeah
yami yugi = carol nein
she got yu gi oh'd
lmao
so we can't really give her credit for it
because CAROL wanted them to get it
She gave ignite
all the time
well elf9 have been useless
yeah
it wasn't powerful as GX output
just a chunk
and i don't think she burned them all
so she can retrieve her body back!
Well Carol > elfnein
Lol
i don't think that she one day woke up and tought to rebel
we don't know why tho
she's angry with the other custodians
as far as we understood
well
and you get the picture
from hacker scenes
add indians
heeh
(i should stop pointing it out)
perfect fgo finale
and demon pillars
we have arash solo
the ruins just fix it if it gets wrong
the moon has its own orbit
i agree with syncreon
humans became music.
and from that day
and disappear.
then we would burn fall
well i liked NR trio
poor minimillaarc
HEH
Rip fine
Remember that this will be the second to last hype train stop
nice thing to know
woh
lmao
I kinda understand what ariathan means
But that could be that yggdrasil will purge shemha from human dna
I doubt that ssj will purify humanity
We always brainstormed here
Heh exaggerated
Mb
Oh you meant miku
It's either that or all the relics just break from the overwhelming pressure of xd + amalgam
Very possible
Yeah i see ssj laser
Lol the bondage scene
That's in the bd <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Mysunshine anime adaptation when
Best route
Mariaxbasa kiss where
In b4 susanoo
Hype
To the last episode
-2 days
So do not fall in despair yet
Well last destination is the live
That brings back memories
Oh dear
He gets all the hate
Rip intern kun
10/10
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Arash
And we got forced support
We are full solomon now
Yes
For grand battle?
<@139432096023183360> you have to deal with meteoroids instead
Internet will never fail to amaze me in good and bad
For the gaijin pic switch
My full respect
Woah
Yeah ver plan would have stopped shemha
They will break in the confrontation
Tomorrow ep will be the final goodbye to the relics
Well i said this already
Fair enough
Lol
Relics.
Ssj deletes
Hmmm
Cowboy
See you in space
Would eat divine power
Sugita
Exactly
Lol
No
Lol
He was part of shemha revival that ver started
Eeeeeh no.
Lol
Fuck tiki
I hated adam part
Lol millhi
This is why i feel the relics will break from overload
Anyways shem ha is supposed to be more powerful in final fight
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Umad
Lol
She will just respawn millhi
Beating her current body will just fail
Is by hijacking yggdrasil
They can kill shemha
The only way
Anyways
~~i know i will end reading gate ln just cuz glorious nippon~~
But i liked fudou plan more
I liked that plan
Legit raiden
It's enough
As a remnant
And their soul is fighting
Giff the theory where they already died
In b4 gate of babylon
Long*
I think it's more that relics can't bear both amalgam and xd for ling
Or get ssj'd
It's either the gears burn out
<@246678192360783872> i agree
At that point
It would be wonderful if miku sang eiai promise
Kimi dake ni?
Did i hear
Human dna is in her hands
Why tho
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
🤔
That sounds like magic god othinus from index
With new protags
In b4 we go precure and get a new gear
Giff more sekai no hate misete kure
Headcannons
The story doesn't end
2) open ending
1) friendly shemha
Top 2 worst endings
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Lol
😂
Lmao yeah
~~watch during wedding from mobile ~~
we have come so far
it's incredible
down my spine
that sends me chills
oh dear
and sent to a far away place
the gaijin will be saluted
today
submarines ❤
LOL THE SENTAI-GEAR
where.
work
statue to YT for the hard
i agree
i'm so much curious lol
is it weird if i'm looking up so much at the gaijin pic reaction?=
and "the story continues ending"
are "Friend Shemha ending"
but the 2 situations that will leave me disappointed
we must be ready for anything
well yeah
yeah
Oke thanks
i forgot.
name
what was the ED song
first of all
SO SO
I?M HERE
OK
OK
giant chris stand shooting
BEST SCENE
OMG OMG
I WAS LIKE
YEAH
OH
nougat
go watch it
gandr
LOL
some animations were wonky
i have to agree with maya
10/10
Oh and SSJ breaking Basa sword
in Genkidama style
But i didn't like that hibiki had to solve the thing
I'm amazed anyways
I'm pulling this from like 6 episodes
so i can assume they just broke
when they returned
Look they didn't have the pendants
THE HIBIMIKU KISS GOT STOLEN
OH DO NOT TELL ME
right?
since they just broke
and i can assume that the gears are lost now
the episode was amazing
anyways
10000/10000
REACTION PIC
GAIJIN
LOL
i'm happy they gave carol a spotlight
was pretty
oh that thing silver vs gold
AND JOIN THE FANON
WAIT FOR THE CONCERT
yknow
the prediction is not copyrighted
coul dbe
lol
when she came down
i expected miku singing eiai promise
For a second
gg for me
on geahs breaking
Anyways i nailed it
she's screwed
in that case yeah
OH
she died in the same manner in GX
Yes, why not?
lol
as she did the first time
once again
she can just recostruct her memories
b ut i think
at carol dying again
Oh i felt sad
SSJ was a faust robe
usually is igalima + shul shagana
I DIDN'T EXPECT THE MECH
LOL TRUE
lacked of something?
that Metanoia
Can i say
she had to use something
she lost her sword
well
i'm okay for it ending
Oh of course
Eeeeh
i feel empty now
i feel you <@!285794457033506816>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
IN THE VISIONS?
SUGITA APPEARING
OH WHAT ABOUT
the old man is in jail now
that was yatsuhiro grave
?
OF COURSE
and I WANT THE SONG SUBS
from CR tl
because i feel that something was off
when YT comes out
oh i'm going to rewatch it
on my anime list now
i'm going to slap a 10/10
good job kaneko
on how it ended
Anyways i'm satisfied
^
was homunculi too
but carol last body
Carol is born as regular human yes
Hold on
yeah
Oh so it wasn't just me
honestly
brb dinner
a different ending
that would be nice
it was a beautiful ride
Lol datto
but it feels sad anyways
eeeeh
then millhi pointed out "It had the tunes in it"
and as i said to the others, i expected eiai promise there for a second
Oh i agree there
they solved a world ending treath in only one ep
well it was quick indeed
it was nice but "pushed"
like i didn't like the "metanoia scene"
treated much better
well yeah some things could have been
how was it??
hello solo
kiss.
obviously declaring love eachother but no
was the scene with hibimikuy
Anyways the only regret of the episode
IT SURPASSED SUGITA ONE
*looks at the reaction count*
❤
ok i'm back
D:
how can yt die on the last two eps
no come on millhi
with PRETTY FONTS
I WANT THE SONGS SUBBED
AND
since i felt the subs were off
i will rewatch with YT
[GRAND FINAL BATTLE]
LOL
uhm?
i don't think a sequel would be nice
no anyways
LMAO
NANA
DEAR
OH
the ending was clear
eeeh no
i agree with millhi there
you don't see any pendants on them
i think they were destroyed
in 22 mins
what can you do
lasting song
So was that gyakkou no flugel?
sadly
instrumental only
Not exactly
so she felt right to leave who beat her alive
was leaving anyways
Well shemha
IGNITED BEEF
LOL
but but D:
and shemha
i mean, i understand putting focus on hibimiku
left the other geahs away
that metanoia
i didn't like
anyways
(i'm convinced of that as well)
true.
oh
YEAH
like the man of the truth
you're a true hero
thanks man
NICE
OH
on 5000 years ago
was rollbacking the planet
Yggdrasil
correct me if i'm wrong
Anyways so
*insert random cackles*
in the visions.
was SUGITA <:Ver:336656981144109066>
best thing of the ep
but yeah
Aoi yuuki vocal range
oh of course there
in a full evil fashion
i loved that scene
OH THAT
copype?? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
pulling a fine?
LOL
but she lost her sword to SSJ
to watch
was very very cool
that thing
did you say love?
vs the other custodians
she wanted revenge
well
heh
can you explain that melua?
uhm
That would be hilarious
Lol adam
what do you think guys, can we apply to work as support in song?
and we don't know it
in b4 curse of balal exists
THE LIVE!
is...
THE LAST hype train stop
well yeah now guys
lol aether
since she was going.
she just decided to spare them
even the best masterplan
since they got Frieza'd
but it could not be helped
they overdid it
well
his masterplan was just perfect
I'm puzzled about it too
was fudou?
from this series
can i say that my fav character
hmmm
yeah
yes i did
they got good motivations
well let's say
NR were nice characters
hah milaarc ❤
and remove half point to axz one.
i have to fix G score
Lol?
https://puu.sh/EmuzL/0ad8957612.png
done.
aaand
we will never know
but it seems like that
they left it open
sing it in unison
they really pulled one of the best songs and made our skilled VAs
no flugel
to listen to gyakkou
now i got the urge
damn
that callback
Lol
S1 was a different genre
let me say that that i liked shemha a lot
and shemha was a beautiful villain
cuz Fudou > ver
it is
XV > G > GX > S1 > AXZ
(damn tiki)
(adam worst villain)=
it was a recollection
on his own hands
hmmm ver didn't die
the computer code
but nr deactivated
well it was working
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
has a flaw
the episode would have been perfect
i know, neither i did
AAaa
NO KISS
BUT
well that was a nice scene in the end
THAT'S THE SPIRIT
EXACTLY
D:
only true heroes get recognized!
i didn't expect him there.
was Sugita
of that scene
the highlight
hah
lol solo
~~best ending would have been fudou getting out of prison, snatching the divine power and yggdrasil and revealing the true [GRAND BATTLE 1/1]~~
it's the same!
!
and leave the useless elf9 alive
kill carol
you can't just
you evil being
rururira
she didn't deserve it
at carol dying like that
I felt sad
it's very pretty
y
rofl
what true love is, the one that our shinjitsu no hito was trying to convey
they understood
in the end
into the evil tree
when she joined the crew
if miku sang eiai promise
going to the live would be the best experience
hell
here take a cent
serious dedication
that' ssome
6BD1s
OH
oh
happens
the emptyness
why millhi?=
uhm
WITHOUT COLOR DEATH
CHRIS HENSHIN
JUST IMAGINE
and noises
without COLOR DEATH
i want to rewatch
giff bds now
it's understandable
oh okay
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
after xv ended
sakimori said something something about new emotes
ooooh
cya
lol
that means nasu fan gathering in <#371105434771390465> every saturday
EH
i too feel it would have needed a 48 ep episode
in 24 mins
what can you do
Eeeeeh
It's fine in that way
*shemha surrenders*
*befriend shemha*
lol
that feels like you were scared solo
TRUE TRUE
LOL
okay??
VER IN THE OPENING
THEN I WANTED
serena isn't now.
She's relevant in the plot
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
do not tell me "cuz apple"
she doesn't get even mentioned
the heck is serena doing in the opening?
anyways i have to say one thing, now that we have finished
it was either that or a flashback
i'm satisfied like that
OF THE SERIES
BEST APPEARANCE
SUGITA
want pizza?
then there's me eating pizza here in italy
lol
kaliks??
that' much'
god.
oh
too sleepy to make one
in eu
there are worse places
yuruyuri where are you from?
eh i can imagine
!
fellow europeans
dunno why lol
i tought you were a murican
you there in belgium millhi?
that's legit
and reading wrongly
no yuru it was just me falling asleep
Anyways millhi are you like GATE's mc then
i was like "wtf?"
living experiences
i've read
just because you work it doesn't mean you have money
^
eiai promise
yea
^
during the final part
Hibiki already said she loves miku
Ehm
you wish eh
lol
then you get empty episode
eeeh
but it was good anyways
it was a bit rushed and metanoia wasn't the best scene to booth
why more?
Why tho?
again
and i want to rewatch g
why i'm feeling this nostalgia as i see this for the 50th time (random number) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6pUTyd_0aQ
poor thing
i didn't expect Gyakkou no flugel
but i gotta say
i neeeeeeeed to watch all the lives
in b4 Yukachi sings Waikyou SSJ during the live
she yells.
because aoi yuuki started it
^
^
DAMN U RED HAIRED BOY
COME ON
NO SOLO
LOL
best color
i got caught.
Eeeeeeh
*runs*
NO FUDOU HENSHIN
just one regret
in the end
LOL
passing by
it was just arash
look those stars
they left it open
it's not 100% confirmed
eh
that prolly all the gears broke
Nepyasuo the thin gis
azuru rein
yeah nep
it's always nice to re-discuss it
happens.
it ALWAYS
LOL
yeah
<@279341087494242304> i've been thinking this for a while, why some shemha things give me a tiamat vibe?
we lost things to obtain victory
and carol died
if the gears broke
i mean
it is
:short lived:
BROKE!
her faust robe
but but
Maria got ver.
she doesn't need visions of her parents
she got over that after her arcs in previous seasons
chris lost her parents years and years ago
This is the thing tho solo
parents.
no
i found a pretty animated shemha wallpaper for my 2nd monitor
uuuh
Even ver admitted it lol
Model k was half assed
SORE DE AI
1 season ago
let's rememember that kirika should have died
LOL
but still the damage is there
i agree
in 13 eps yeah
PUTS YOUR HANZA UP
what else do you want?
she became the most badass person in the bunch
look chris didn't need it
i'm okay with some comedy but they were like totally filler
is how poorly they treated dmjii
of XV
anyways one of the bad side of the coin
i think that urobutcher + gear would end worse than madoka
never forget that
in suffering
basa truly shines
well i've watched WT like 5 times? the animations are low budget
no i mean
with WT millhi?
hmm what do you mean
poor world trigger
you wish eh
and Live
BD
Nop
poor world trigger
don't remind me toei
ugh
fragments can exist
of course other
G's SSJ was part of it
i treat that as a vision
LOL
i wont say anything more on the matter since i'm not that competent
~~faust robe battle school would be a good input for a fanfic~~
Lol
*is that an input to a battle school anime?*
where they teach using faust robes?
A school
he knows how to spend money
with that sentence
went full shirou
well hibiki
LOL
it's an alternate timeline!
that would require an insane amount of budget.
next adaptation, mysunshine
*infinite stratos*
something something
sounds like
that
LOL
of the ep
it's the part that i liked the less
same to be fair
Eeeeh
people die if you translate bad
the tl was so bad that stuff got killed
so it wasn't only me
that was a stretch
yeah
(gears = mystic codes confirmed)
uhm
?_?
i even buy the LN of that one
my fav is asterisk
i found a guy on kissanime that wrote that those 3 were his fav anime
came out
i remember the year where Asterisk+Rakudai+Seirei tsukai
back at the time it was all about battle school harem spamming
do not say thaty
expecially when the new heroine forced the hand.
being the full garbage
i remember S2
*insert pretty ost*
included in the package?
is mana transfer
Lol
yeah..
i loved S1
that IS went like that
it's a shame
LOL
that's bringin it to the next level
🤔
with that
there's just one problem
but then just think
but a renewed cast would be something interesting
not with the normal cast.
honestly?
would have been great
But DIVINE NOISE
no noises during final fight
Oh i was thinking, it's nice that we got
after 5 seasons.
i missed that
hm?
well a thing like that would be made by him
damn kaneko
it's ayahi's fault!
So of course CR got confused with their skills
silly me.-
.
you write mirai exactly like that
Mirai with other reading
it's just reading
LOL
HOLD ON
the mi of mirai should be
oh true
miku = future?
wait
i'm not following you solo
hmmm
just by touching.
so it ended up working as imagine breaker.
who?
in XV
we got already frieza shenanigans
come on solo
LOL
more inori
Lol no please millhi
stop trying to kill me
RISA TANEDA
but 2 veterans could do the job
it's too much
all newbies and 1 vet?
Uhm
legit
LOL
Where are you going to find high level VAs like that?
Yeah
(something down that line)
|| "I want miku, i do not want to save the people" ||
hibiki DID go full emiya shirou
well
😂
you would pop up with those
i damn knew
.
would have been "try to activate XD" "Do not try and resist the re-entry with amalgam shield"
lol during reentry scene
as an option
but that would have been legit
~~don't go kill sakura style on me~~
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Anyways if Gear was a VN what the choices during final fight would have been?
lol
would Cryosopeia be enough to blast shemha
Hmmm now that i think of it
Get cryosopeia'd
(to be fair the only thing i truly deem as bad in gear is Adam shenanigans)
but it was a different thing altogether
Well s1 wasn't bad
Yeah
as i read your sentence
a jolt went straight up my spine
OH
i agree with melua here
LOL
giff hanazawa kana
hold on hold on
*minitsundere voices callbacks*
in b4 Rie kugimiya
those were bad.
And yeah
YT is behind 1 week, they got their tler busy
archer/dante ogawa and pimp ogawa
Ogawa family spinoff when
Come on
HEH
aaand i'm settled, for now.
i can't find it
i've searched through the logs
someone was making
of that symphogear fighting game
anyways didn't we have some footage
Would meodp work on gears?
evil toughts
thanks for waking me up solo
else i would have to wipe my last hour posts
i'm lucky i didn't go around too much
what do you have against arc D:
Lol
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
deeply apologies
^
people sorry
my bad
Right
lol
THAT REMINDS ME WHAT SHOULD NOT BE REMEMBERED
AAaa
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
i'm scared
Yeah lmao
without ARCING
it flew RIGHT UP
and it even IGNORED BALLISTICS
i'm still amazed at HOW she pulled that off.
*i am da bon of my soood*
Basa chanting
did i hear
No please
"ano baka"
that's for the BD!
Heh
what would have happened
replace bikki with kanade
take gear
now just think
gg we did it
lol
and ogawa family spinoff.
dr ver background
including sugita.
from every "ghost"
giving us a line
that would have meant
well
(and elfnein remains useless)
(Yay maria is useful now)
to reality
to slap basa
it was maria time
and not again thanks please kaneko
Kanade solves Basa problem
would have meant
Tying kanade in XV
Want me to be honest? that was for the better
but i still feel melua is right
yeah
you're right there
hm
ED
GYAKKOU NO FLUGEL
WHAT ABOUT
but yeah shemha got done too much
ikr

Gaijin

it's the most fun part
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
until they made me realize
i didn't even notice
something like that
"milaarc went right from the bat"
my unwanted pun
you just reminded me
LOL
for going full shirou
it's bikki fault
Lol
10/10 indeed.

that was a quote
no parents for chris chan
😂
not getting anyone in the scene?
what do you think of chris
Eupho as someone mentioned
~~i went there yelling "OMG HE'S HERE, GG" ~~
Yea it was fitting eupho
from elf9 memories
carol reconstructed herself
she did not reconstruct Carol
but she didn't do anything actively to bring ~~the best villain after fudou and ver~~ carol back
Sasuga kanekp

And nana

Fuck the dead cor noise
Bds!
Oh god
You got me millhi

Damn me

Putting carol as the lead
It was nice
LOL
well it was me  with my limited n5 knowlege (gonna attempt n4 this year)
with E+ NO

it just seemed weith
i know eupho
i just tought it was a misstype from your part
ikr

Frontier made me dream ages ago
i have to watch other macross

than anime 0079
it has some more serious tones
lol
on an movie
whyy are you betting so much
of 0079
but their products are great usually
if i were ever to buy from goodsmile
the problem here would be the delivery expense
nice merchandise
oh goodsmile
train the little alchemists
is behind the corner
Faust robe battle school
They were naked but we do not know what happened inside shem ha soul hands
It depends
We can just assume since the girls had no pendant
But we can't confirm
Every converter broke
Or this was what it seemed
Yes
Axia no kaze is preciousss
who is the damned?
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
you wish eh
we don't know
48 mins or 14 eps instead of 13 would have fixed the problem
Honestly it's all fault of the 24 mins format
they choose to leave the decision to us basically
No because it's not confirmed
Yes because we saw the converter shattering
Yes and No
blackraiden post

I feel lost with that question
Err i meant, sugita soul
Sugita image
So what about
Oooh
yeah
i guess gilgamesh will get angry knowning they blew up nephilim in his gate
Lol
Lmao that pic
And hey i didn't meme him lately
it's a love or hate.
but ver was a fantastic character
that sugita only lacked in background
i stil think
more than legit
that's a fair question from a logical standpoint
best hero of the planet
needed <:Ver:336656981144109066>
meanwhile maria
she doesn't need the emotional support
for that scene
She's too much cool
lmao
and spends all the screentime just showing off and being cool
when your zenbu has finished chardev
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
PUCHOHANZA DA
The guy in the car
Anyways, i will ask this again, does someone have the "sekai no hate misete kure" scene from the chris vs vanessa on the highway ep?
you got some nice eyes there
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it stands there for 2 frame, i wouldn't even have noticed
the space
LOL
T posing intensifies
well it was going to happen sooner or later
what a sad day
rip
evil deeds are evil indeed
what happened with the hero spam
oh god
~~in secret i expect YTT to sub the BDs~~
i will do a rewatch then
nice
all BDs are released?
oh how much until

世界の果てですよ
the end of the world
you can always go and check
just boring morning
sorry no party here
10.16 CEST
i'm pretty much curious
hmmm hello, i've been away for a while and now i find this, can somebody explain to me what is "Symphogear RV"?
rv
wrong channel guys sorry
whoops
rv_help
rv_pull "Grand opening" 5
hmmmm i kinda catch the thing
rv_pull "AU" 1
well you are acting in the good, it shouldn't backfire
i can imagine that
i can bet on it, if they vote it again the vote would be overruled and brexit would be cancelled
That's pure bullshit, i think that they should vote it again
at least a 7-8% would be sufficient to stabilize a political bomb as that decision
(take this as my honest opinion of course)
well 2% IS stupid to push forward for a thing big as the Brexit
And don't be surprised on politics failing on their work, we are in a crappy situation here in italy too
wait what lol
And anyways i think that Absolute Majority criteria is crap for a thing so big, leaving aside the facts, a country should not leave EU just for a 2%, it's like basing your support on... nothing? It comes down to uncle bill and aunt samantha having voted to quit
But hey, politics are not an easy thing
I still consider the whole brexit deal something that has more backfires than gain
Again?
Please help me understand
Uhm, i see news everywhere saying it passed
There's one thing to take in account if you say that, not every human *wants* to do such things
We need jobs to keep the production and service deployment working
(i arrived late into the discussion so my bad)
i'm not sarcastic i want to understand your point alice
without having to struggle?
So you are talking about an utopic society that drowns in hedonism
And pollution, sadly no one gives a damn about it
Calm down regarding robots, new tech requires new jobs, it's like when IT became a thing
True enough
yeah
It is the exact reason because monopoly and cartel are banned here
good example^
Regarding the wages thing, economical cycles do exist for a reason
and to motivate research and technology development
it's needed to balance the trade itself
Competition is not a bad thing if done correctly
You can call it rotted, but it's still human nature, some individuals can be an exception, but exceptions are not the rule
basically
Humans created this society because it goes well with the human nature
I have a friend who is a senior programmer, he started a videogame development project years ago, he dropped 2 years after it because he can't do it alone with sheer motivation, in his case this was his limit, everyone is different
Motivation surely does wonders but it's not limitless
yeah
why a society should go against the very nature of his inhabitants?
That's exactly why it doesn't work, marxism goes against human nature, humans are greedy
This^
Well food production is not a problem, with new agriculturar techs we can raise the output in a ridiculous measure
The moment we are born we say "This is mine"
Human is not made like that
you're right if you put it like that, it would be wonderful, but again it's an utopic society
since i get to choose the topic
uhm, in a way yes
if i can't earn something, why should i bother with research for example?
I was thinking the same about stagnation
that's sad
Good idea about the guidance counselor
There are, sadly, humans that live with inertia
and just accept a low tier job
some humans don't want to bother with becoming engineers for example
exactly
it's a metaphor for the rich people sparkle?
that's why investment is a thing
how can they buy the product if they got no money?
Yeah Alice, if you don't have anyone to buy your thing, you will fall
it's a cycle, you buy thing from the big rich guy, he pays his workers to sell the product, then the workers can buy the product for themselves
sad
uhm i don't remember such event but yeah, narrowmindedness is a curse
every time it happens, it is counter productive
Yeah solo, but in 2019 the society should REALLY try to bury those idiotic shenanigans
just because she's a woman
it's still sad that someone is EVEN trying to discredit her
Poor woman
poor guy, but unfortunately not everyone is able to get help in those dire situations
This is a big loss to the industry
I mean did anyone call police as they saw this man running amok with gasoline
Yeah
:/
A 40 years old man
The culprit got already arrested t seems
It's a sad thing
From southern italy, bari
Hi there
I live in italy where most of people are strict catholics
Yumi i was kinda rethorical
Aaaah dear humanity, wake up and face progress
How does even the heck jesus and being trans do connect
Not a bad theory armados
You serious saki?
I think the true wrong thing is letting religion rule your day and extremism
:/
And you're an idiot (no offence) if you let  your religious/political belief overrule your family love
But usually is not always
The blood thing deal is that usually blood tied people to care for each other
Well
If she cares about you she should accept
Legit decision
Dess
<@102691114762371072> if you keep dressing green and black you will end up cosplaying as kirika
Since they're not mandatory
Funny enough my father always told me * you decide if you want to take part into  religion lessons*
Ugh
I know that feel
Hah hah.
Almost yes
With *lessons*
Throat
Like how catholic church like showes down your throt
Eeeeeh
But knowing about those always fascinates me
It sounds stupid like that
I mean
Some Pagan religion are pretty "cool"
Hmmm
Wot one?
So no one cares
But they don't practice
Well i'm lucky, my family believes just in name
And lol about the fanfic
The immortality fruit
The eden
The snake
Look the first doubt came by reading bits of the epic of gilgamesh
It's too late, for *me* the bible is good as a fantasy novel
Ha
Who? Me?
But it's a long time since i started t have my own doubts
Well i had to go through confirmation
Oh mormons
Hm,
Lds?
And it would be safer
Many politicians try to push a legalization because it would be a great source of income from taxes
Well the illegal prostitution here is caused by the religious influence but
Prostitution is forbidden in Italy
It's not the same in all europe
Hm
that's unusual
12 kids? wow
Wat
but there's a reason if EU forbids death penality
look the thing is complicated
it's too easy to escape life like that
and i don't really approve death penality
justice is complicated
nervine gas one?
wat was the last one?
😦
it will leave an even worse taste if the reason gets confirmed
happened in japan after ww2
it's probably the greatest mass murder
well they deserve those donations
oh that's true
story
same
else it's doubling up on the damage.
but the owner of the building *must* be compensated
I agree with demolishing
*social standing intensifies*
well rich kids can live their dreams
There are some problems with lgbt acceptance here in italy
Well germany, our continent's "spearhead"
i'm no expert on the argument
hands up
you learn stuff everyday
wot.
i mean
ugh
a coinflip
it's always a 50-50 when talking of japan
in the world
it's one of the most nationalists and traditionalist countries
Yeah but keep in mind
they treat the thing as "Gaijin problem"
japan sidesteps the argument
Hmmm as long as i knew
do you know how did it pop up?
is hilarious
the blue blood thing
Considering yourself royalty class falls a bit under the ubermench concept
hmm
D:
i will just go back and start travelling planets by using a *Certain metal ring under a pyramid*
*runs*
So... aliens are evil?
then there is "god forbids that!"
^
heh
Of course
"you're not telling me the truth then"
made me take a step back
that's what
their teachings
Catholic church always changes
(is god a custodian?)
well it's a legit way of thinking
he's progressive
said anything about it
i'm not sure the actual pope
if i may ask
Where are you from yuki?
in any religion
is wrong
Blindly following faith
and the conservative faction in the church wants him dead
the actual pope is progressive
i misread sorry
the pope
oh
you were from UK, right yorin?
brexit? <:Ver:336656981144109066>
wot changes
and "the main protagonist of the fantasy novel" (bible) said no
since majority of the population is catholic
if i recall right
is the power consumption
the railgun issue
take a stake of tungsten and blow up a city like NY in only one shot
Tungsten is enough to resist the atmosphere re-entry
and drop it.
to a satellite
well just take stuff
yeah
~~please don't point out that low orbit bombardment is already possible but it's banned by a mere piece of paper ~~
for 2 reasons
WWIII wont happen
and then it's just a countdown to rebellion
South corea "muricanized" culture will spread to china
if NK falls
is that China needs him
with the fathead right there
The political lockdown
in world facts
i believe UN should become more "intrusive"
that's the problem
to stop that degenerate
and doesn't do shit
i'm still angry at how UN stays there
"i pay you to defend my riches"
The problem is
ballistic missiles, fast food, cigs and sleep (yeah fuck him indeed)
think to our dear and obese north korean leader
it's a quote from a friend of mine
"when the rich people and/or political right people do something, the history always goes in a weird way"
there was a friend saying
the ink was protective
not just for fashion
it was to prevent caries
because they used ink to protect their teeths
and japanese people called their nobles "black teeth
we called nobles blue blood
anyways now that i think of it
means that you can't do that
Yeah but when you go down to incest
here and there
in italy most of the nobles just did political marriages
it was in certain areas
that phenomena wasn't everywhere in europe
well that
it's the historical fact D:
with prominent veins.
made the nobles pale
actually *commoners* started calling the nobles and such "blue blood" since long staying in the castles without going out
with manchuria
yeah i know how the deal went
interwar?
Yeah
i'm pretty sure that japan would have invaded korea almost immediately
I know but it's pretty far you know
if Oda Nobunaga managed to complete his "Tenka Fubu"
how the world would have changed
i sometime think
❤
RA3
the timing got wrong
there was a chance that einstein would have built the nuke for the nazis
that hirohito surrendered
it didn't make it in time
was to strike Panama
The I401 plan
On 26 August 1945, I-401 hoisted a black flag of surrender. Its unmanned planes were catapulted into the sea, all 20 Type 95 torpedoes were destroyed, and all codes, logs, charts and secret documents were also destroyed.
and was the  *largest submarine of ww2*
that I401 was a submarine/aircraft carrier
Yeah but just realize
damn u WWII
Ohhhh don't talk about sub carriers, i'm still angry that I401 got sunk like that
uncle sam is using japan to experiment with new military tech
idk but it's a joint project
it will be ready in 7 years
they always go big
and Japan is building a supercarrier
recently
italy just finished building a new aircraft carrier
speaking of carriers
Jesus and dragons made me laugh
and the garden of eden
Like the Snake and the fruit
that were in the epic of gil
well first of all, there are several points present in the bible
Religion based on the epic of gilgamesh when
lol
i mean it's not like i'm going to murder people around if i play gta
i have to agree with dunkek
without blowing up
Nice now everyone can return in trying to activate Shem-ha in peace
it's not always in a bad way
She's free to decide to throw the towel and say "i don't think we can reach an agreement so i wont waste time"
everyone can do what they want
and "we wont reach an agreement" is always an option
flaming is not a good idea on how to solve discussions
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
>japan
>no videogames
but the aim is COMPLETELY OFF
i damn mean, the concept is wrong to start with
pure ignorance or pure diversion
LOL
about the no videogames in japan?
The fuck did i just read
if i play political simulators
i can become a great national dictator
come on standing on that theory
yeah
and i don't think it would be a bad thing colonizing planet in that way
the thing would work the same at first
Well look at antartica
hush we need to hasten up space tech research
that's why it's time to go in space
where money overrule politics and nothing happens
still i'm waiting for the capitalist laugh
^
-> BURN AT THE STAKE
-> HE/SHE'S A SORCEROR/SORCERESS
hell there were cases where the poor person was a bit more clean than the others, or more beautiful
or "burn the witch" simulator
i'm pretty sure they had videogames during the crusades <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I'm not an US Citizen, but from the point of view of an outsider (italian here) it seems that they want to divert the attention from guns and racial hate problem
it's all a diversion
well rakhi
:logic:
here i go again, if videogames make people violent, will playing a political simulator make me an excellent politician/dictator?
Yeah
to balance it out
one party exists to correct the other
that would be fine
then it will become "Let's team up, gotta compete"
look i think the situation will really change only when the human kind will encounter intelligent alien races
humans are really humans
but you know, you can't leave money you invested just for the sake of not killing people
neat reasoning would be to leave it alone, AFTER the situation stabilizes and they become self sufficient
it would needed a first
But it's a standard process
Yeah
The human kind is made in that way, you can't really change it
there's even gundam with zeonic stuff
Well if we go down that path
LoGH?
you can't leave them alone
since new settlements in space would need some kind of government to work
well you can't really avoid the hand that's supposed to protect you
if you get fined you have to pay like a % of your entry
Oh that's the law yorin
free market
Welfare state is required to counterbalance
we got debts over debts showed on our government because of that
We have welfare state here
there's no system that isn't flawed
meh yorin
because France had to have fun there?
do we want to talk about Libia having a problem
oh that
Correct me if i'm wrong, i heard that US doesn't have any law stopping corruption intended as "i pay you to pass this law (example)", is it true or false?
not the people in charge
The society should define it
this
^
THey are, is US government still avoiding the subject showing the problems on videogames?
are you talking about recent US attacks?
you know
Not all "in charge" people are corrupted and rotten
it doesn't mean that government dies and money does the same
hold up
oh you mean that, it's a different thing
it's human nature
it is, i will not work my ass off if i can't earn something out of it
You know R&D
to let the human race progress
Well money is needed
like "too much of everything doesn't work"
not as a political wing
lemme say that better, it's the extreme of capitalism
and ancap is radical.
everything that's radical is cursed
just because he can pay it
rakhi he even stated that he should be allowed to have a private army
is the motto
Free the market free the people
lol i have one friend who believes that anarco capitalism is right
it needs the welfare state
Pure capitalism is dystopian
wot ones
no one said that
pick a choice
it can lead to communism or to dictatorships
even that has huge flaws, and you can't strip the private property from those who owns it
but it's my opinion
I don't agree with that.
EU law is different from US
else no deal.
only if i get to pick the time period where i want to live 😛
but yeah living in vr would be cool anyways
You can't guarantee it wont end in the same way
in 1999
anyways the concept of living in VR has been touched in matrix
for many uses.
Enhanced reality is needed i believe
that's a phylosophical question
*runs*
!
google glasses
ikr
Cyberpunk 2077 when
but it can't work like that
Crypto pretended to work in parallel with standard currency
the concept is itself wicked
besides the Legalized one.
they point is having a currency
look yorin
LOL
he's made some big money out of it but he stopped to avoid risking more
into crypto currency
i know a guy that invested
yeah
nothing can stop it from happening again
<@266379640069685252> the problem with china is that it's a melting pot, it will overflow sooner or later. Their history is filled with rebellions
they always find a way
Hah are you challenging rich people?
then the currency goes up again
but there will be always people who will estabilish some sort of law
i got what you mean
Look the day when Kim jong un dies, South Korea Americanizes NK -> China collapses short after that
this
^
hah china
^
not during exploration
that happened during imperialism
>age of exploration
True enough
State religion doesn't damn work, how much time will pass since mankind will realize that?
and is using armed forces to suppress it
Chinese government doesn't want to let it go
it's no different from Hong kong in these days
oh THAT
the person is a different thing
well well hp lovecraft writings are untouchable
can you enlight me?
Uhm i wasn't following that
The point is, if you lived in at that time you wouldn't have even thought it was wrong
you can't condemn a person just because it is wrong in our time
Columbus action were legit for his time period
*put random conquistadores*
let's join colombus on his expedition!
Not being able is one thing
That's why i criticize who refuses to vote in any field
Eh i do
And life - death decisions to 0.1
You don't leave core topics
51% is not wanting to quit
Is just reckless
Still you can't sit alone in globalization
Quit eu.
There is an economic war right there, so what you do?
I still find quitting EU stupid
It's ridiculous
a lot.
that sucks
Well i hope you sort out the problems that are leading you to those anxiety attacks
Stay safe
Uh that's bad
Internal crisis are the worst
That's a lot
7k£
Woh
What pay if i may ask
It failed
Lol
You can't fit two parties in one government
They called it .
With our populist/nationalist government failing
Here in italy
Meanwhile we got political crisis
That's the evil
It's the i don't care thing
will be huge
the economical damage to china from the HK revolt
Well
I easily see revolts there
Hong kong is a signal
That will pop
Yeah but china is a bubble
that 51% should have never happened.
From my standpoint UK situation is dire
i was actually listening to that news
oh yeah
Yeah that
Of the recent times
It has become one of the weirdest political crisis
I mean, wtf
I was following the latest brexit news
true
oh yeah
i could be wrong, i could be right, i don't know
it's confusing
i just didn't get your point
No no wfc do not misunderstand me
nowadays response time would be different.
2001 was a different thing
never mind wfc, but i guess
@_@
eh
why underestimating?
hmmm?
yeah i guess
and that was 2001
i mean maybe i'm oversaying
didn't stop the incident
at how US Air force
i'm still surprised
lol.
i heard
Lol belts always trigger it
yeah yeah
oh that
pat down?
i've never been on a airplane, my family did, so i'm curious
"look this person is a subreddit mod, you can pass"
well hands up,
uh
you never now when a random greenie pays with dad's money and creates a disaster
and a thing like "pay and skip" should not exist
i think that airport security shouldn't ever be overlooked
but it's ridiculous
that's not the point
i believe you
seriously
i can't believe what i'm reading
lmao
of course it is invalidated
Well yeah if such thing is true
a thing like tsa precheck doesn't exist here
is this in US?
Ehm what? where?
at least here in italy
metal detectors everywhere
aaaand i'm not sure about that
got it
what is a leatherman?
even a small vial is under restrictions
Lol now you can dream that
the problem stays with the "all religion" people
but people are slowly starting to accept lgbt
the most catholic country in the world
look i live in italy
i heard similar stuff from a person i know
on that subject
i think the laws need further updates
now we got pro-europe party up again
well here in italy we had a populist political party that believed that italy had to fight vs europe for migrants and stuff, the party just got kicked out government and got full shamed
expecially because it needs to step up in the global trade dispute
But i agree that EU needs to be reformed
"Economic Blocks"
it overbalances out every other negative reason
is wrong just because of the time period we live in
dropping out
Expecially in the most Catholic country in the world
Well it's nice to see that LGBT is being recognized by the society
Italy got its first transgender mayor and he's being celebrated by being invited to a related event
Yeah, it's pretty bad
She's been both a man and a woman in her life. Greek mythology goes huge.
Upcoming
Caenis
<@279341087494242304>
let's move there
but <#337805317276565525>
as nearly every other valve games
Sin ❤
ikr
several people i know are going back to tf2
If it goes on
As i said before, i kinda see this as china's beginning of the end
it's like he's armed and you're not
But yeah, attacking back is like allowed in the direst situations
laws
for example it sucks here, you can barely react to an assault without risking to be sent in jail
and it heavily changes across the world
is a hard to demonstrate thing
well Self defence
-> police and military police need more manpower
so judges are giving house arrest if doable
we have flooded prisons here
ffs stop boris
again the madman?
*laughs in black market*
"Yeah guys what about we sanction Turkey? Yeah let's banish Firearms trade with them!"
meanwhile EU...
it's called dictatorship
Of course you can't
LOL
EU is literally sleeping atm
i'm pretty angry at EU not doing shit.
i'd take USA current leadership at this point
it would have been better if they didn't even vote for that imho
it's ridiculous
have fun
he's even the leader of armed forces during wartimes
italy
when things go to crap
here we have the head of state (republic president, not the prime minister) that can barge into parliament and dissolve it
i believe you
eh
now they prefer to hate immigrants instead of southerners
until their leader came into power and sucked it up and fell from government
nothern italy had separationists for decades
^ this expecially
this is why i find the current situation in spain a bit pointless
EU will have to interfere
if separationist try anything
i mean
Yes, they have to guarantee the sovereignity of member states
if something happens
eh eu will give a fuck and interfere
that EU forbids such crap by default?
Can someone tell separationists around EU
Splitting belgium?
Lol
such stuff
it's hard to accept to have a problem sometimes, it takes sheer will to admit
he needs to pursue professional help harder
no, if the case is bad as you describe
but the official unified language would stand there getting updated time by time
i don't really agree about that, just dialects would rise
<@486087033652248576> did something bad happen? <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Uh?
If we can call it like that
<@486087033652248576> you could write a diary about that adventure
where you were stuck again_
just to ask
Thank god
Train company will refund part of the ticket
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Under a train and now we are stuck here for 2 hours until police finishes the investigation
Someone decided to suicide themselves
By train and what happens?
I'm returning home from a 500 km trip
Circumstances...
it was a cursed trip i guess
ugh
But yeah good for you
You got no papers
Since as long as i'm understanding
Crap's gonna fly if you get hurt
Well take care
~~i secretly wish to want to see space~~
and space tech
i think that elon musk must keep focusing on space exploration
i think we could see mass produced for sales in like 60 years
yeah
190 IQ nerd where
not in the near future
but they need to be ready before being brought on public streets
well it's okay to research them
legit
^
It's unfair, sometimes is placed in infamous spots
60 kph speed limit? Here i go on 70 by descending a slope -> there you go 40 € for the state
But the terror of the streets is the speed camera
Those little things make you learn how different the world is, here there is no such law
Windshield snow is forbidden?
Wait what
it's a grim situation
yeah you better do at that point
i'm just pointing stuff up
i understand that
we are researching space tech and at the same time we have this retro way of thinking
still sad
i understand that reason
that's a sad thing
it's a way of thinking that doesn't work with the concept of globalization
what you just posted
is humanity even trying?
seriously, all that in 2019?
harrassing is always bad
and used it for their goals
they just reversed
yeah the swastika is the symbol of life
is if trump goes mad and decides to ignore the no-orbital bombardment thing
one of the scariest shit that can happen
of course war is never a good thing
but yeah the thing is, that if a war is going to happen it will be a very localized one
the only problem with that is iran's oil
but nowadays the war is played by embargoes
that shit can't happen
oh no one said
and it's an anti-icbm system
is operative since 2009.
USA's THAAD
oh one thing
but do not freak about it too much
i can see the danger anyways
nah do not think of using torpedoes with the submarine tech we have nowadays
ofc the plan is flawed
you can't really launch an icbm with air superiority
they're attemting to maintain Air Superiority
what do you think murican carriers are doing down in middle east?
*2020
in 2019 there's a 99% of an ICBM getting shot down
and hit what?
too huge
saying WW3 is an overstatement
look
cup of milk/coffee/tea with biscuits/cornflakes/something
feel like italian breakfast
What i find interesting, cool and amazing, could be the most boring and stupid thing for you.
Interest is relative as time is.
it's all a matter of perspective
There are no boring and interesting people
I hope your situation gets better
Sad stories
LOL
imho
in both directions
is *always* bad
Radicalization
what is a Homebody?
gomen
no ok i wont meme in serious discussion
Fresh aria?
i used to do heavy lifting
i will someday find the will to return to my gym
^
is not serious D:
walking in cold
<#336297387863703552>
anyways if the discussion is not serious
i fixed.
now that aya makes me think
that's kinda true
hmmmm
but i don't like it
it's okay
let me rephrase
i cannot win <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
sweating is bad
even if i hate hot weather
DURING WINTER
THIS
^
i live in a 18k inhabitants town nearby a big city
it depends where you live
expecially if like me you move by car
that's not entirely true
eeeeh
or when i ask them
i just hang out sometimes when my best friends ask me
like me, i'm lazy and i prefer to stay cozy and warm
in staying home during weekends
anyways there's nothing wrong
it's not my fault if Aria is Air in italian
with a dear friend of mine
In my life i had one big discussion
D:
cuz they're not rational
and starting to yell to people
flipping over
then there's me
and some are toned down by "good manners"
not everyone shows it
of course
and that's a lot.
something like that
1/25 people are born as sociopath
got it
hm
What does step on eggshells mean
the problem there
double down
i don't agree with that way of thinking
people getting influenced by scott behaviour
bad
that's
is becoming too lazy
the problem with homebody
D:
but i don't like rapiers
sabers are cool
Absolutelyu
they sway a bit
some swords
you need a lot of pratice to control
^ this
but i get what you mean
it depends on the style
it's awesome
and armors
with longswords
but we have historical fencing here
tthere's no kendo here
cool
there's always somewhere
oh yeah
of course the other case exists too
aria stated something not incorrect
^
illusion of grandeur where
your situation is a complicated one
to cut ties with someone
i had for the first time in my life
he didn't want to reason
it was just overdeath assuming things
it's true
now that i read

to vent
THis is always the right place
Dw trueblade
she has a sword ready
while you can
run aya
he's a lowlife.
he even tried to get a girl drunk
that is still drowning in alcohol
i know a person
hm
^
Good luck man
and if you don't know what to pick you just pick a school that will prepare you for university
you have a crapton of specialization you can choose from
that our High school system is pretty varied
let's say
on the eastern border
from a polish friend
i've heard things
LOL
https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSzNrMqF2MKGrRS9RhnNumuU3baFp-bdPLVREUiG1FEH_TobHRf italian system
it's convulted lol
our system here has 5 Years of Elementary school, 3 years of middle school, 3 years of mandatory high school which give you nothing if you don't do the full 5 years of high school.
After that you can either go to work or attend university for 3/5 years (if everything goes as planned)
only losses
You get 0 gains
You can leave without explanations here at 16 but
not doing the 5th year here in italy equals of not having attended high school at all
same <@!189146272865845248>
well that's still sad to hear
and regarding bad fathers, that's sad
yeah nice
Guys we are humans, humans make mistakes and we are wonderful beings for thinking differently on subjects, do not be so harsh
^
Humans can make mistakes
you just apologize
it happened to me twice here
oh the wrong pronoum thing
trying to follow the discussion
i feel a bit lost
lol
I was writing the same mel
LOL
the subject
well just state
lmao
lmao
of bread vs rice discussion
this reminds me
we are humans
told you
But you can't assest someone gender from a nickname
in china
56 people died for the coronavirus
and then they went full dumb on the matter
they ignored him,
the Expert told them they had to fix it
EU parliament called an expert to evaluate
is the execution that is a disaster
the concept is not wrong
the A13 is just badly written
I mean their history is pretty explanatory too
it can overflow and break down
China is a boiling pot filled
(it is not an intended pun <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> )
eeeh china is fragile
hm?
plus everyone knows that china hides real numbers
on the stock market
Shangai is already at more than -2%
is to passively damage china's economy
the media yelling at the virus
Look
same question
^
dear
oh
we are not going to wage war, don't worry
since we have italians trapped there due to the lockdown
and it's a transport issue
I only know that our Foreign affairs and Defense ministers sent the order
y
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
italians trapped in the china virus cities
Italy is sending military aircrafts to retrieve
i just hope that china arranges the authorizations to retrieve those 60 italians, else knowing our government they will start going nuts, they already did it with the 2 marines that got arrested in india years ago
it's spammed on our media here
it's a delicate matter
racial discrimination can be raised even for this virus issue
a girl got bullied around venice only because she's chinese
tough sad things are happening
Lol
and it will only damage uk
i still find the brexit deal pointless
lol there
great job great job.
in a time period where economic wars are a thing
in the end, this move only contributed in weaking the EU economic block
there's the deal that Scotland holds UK's Oil in the north sea...
private hospitals
none.
none solo
i will post something i remember in <#407060923078017026> that is kinda in context , it comes up to my mind every damn time
^
you can use "more means"
and it is night
IIRC if the criminal is armed
that this argument kinda stirs people that want to widen the "Legitimate Defence" where i live, and they tried multiple times to change the law
there's the thing
he was charged with excessive legitimate defence
There was a case some years ago, a shop owner was getting threatened with by a masked guy with a gun in his shop, he flipped out, took an hunting rifle (he had license for it) from under the table and shot the criminal. 
He's in jail now.
you get arrested.
and you shoot him
here if someone breaks in your house
from reality in italy
that's a thing so distant
hahaha
what's up there?
hm
This place is called serious discussion for a reason
Are a consequence
And friends
Inflation
Eeeh
And the pop density goes down
As people move out
Would deflate prices in big urban areas
Promoting rural areas
Anyways
I'm confused
Commuting is?
To improve the market
Promoting enterprises is a good way
Anyways jokes aside
What china did in hk as eu4 shows is pressing harsh treatment on rebels
So
Keeping corruption under control also helps
Is a decent move
Establishing a minimum wage by law
what do you think of it people here?
and one of the topics is the fall of the Fourth Estate (mass media)
i was watching a video about 2010s events
hell our government even makes us pay taxes from pcs now
it's normal to rely on computers
we are in 2020 not in 1990s
it regards the quality of life
*pat pat humanity, you served me well*
Friendship ended with humanity
on DISCORD?
Religious Proselitizing
Lol wait this is ridiculous
Woh lol
You nean historical artifacts rakhi?
Uh
How is brexit going there?
well i hope he gets better since the new meds seem to work
ugh
where does he have it? if i may ask
eh...
and as we said in <#336297387863703552> good news
but evil was always there
that rules things differently
it's just the information era
ye
imho
that is going to wreck havoc as hell
and we are in full "Fall of mass media" phase
yeah sub
(even tho, there's no right or wrong in politics, they're just bad and good politics)
is always sad
but when nice people leave the server
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
that was a slip
yes
err
well i hope she gets her problems sorted and improves
damn
Noo i missed saying goodbye to aria
when i joined here the server was still modded by yuri witch and glitch
Lol
i commend you for that way of thinking
well good policy
i had to search a bit 2 years ago since i didn't know the terms, i started googling to understand the terms since i saw those mentioned in discussions from time to time
i joined cuz of xdu, then i dropped xdu and stayed since i've found this wonderful community
*feels proud about the achievement*
and yeah i'm here since AXZ stopped airing
how did you take my login date?
Wait

then you get misdreavous in the mt silver
when did you join rakhi? i don't recall you here when i arrived
then we got our flashy and ultra good mods!
ye i remember that
i don't know the details, but there was an incident regarding yuri witch and don't know about glitch.
This is all i can say and i agree with rakhi
Yeah
solo was still writing my sunshine
napoleon & friends
think of past politics
lol wt?
Lol
Wpa 3 where
Yeah lol
Imho
That test is just stupid
That made me laugh
Lmao shemmy
What can be interesting for one is not interesting for another
There is no such thing as uninteresting person
i didn't understand
oh sorry
start reading, it's a fun thing if you catch the genre you like
Saying that religion is wrong
Sub i'm not
Didn't we have enough of that during middle ages or reinassance,
Ugh religion meddling into politics
But it's not the right thing
It happens
I'm lost lol
I was scrolling up to find the source of that statement but
Stereotyping people into boxes is always wrong
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Italy
For 3 weeks
They will be closed
Due to coronavirus
And our government just closed schools and unis
Well thanks for your answers
So the risk of a strong law not being able to stop abuse is high?
Hm
And what about clonation?
Some people think is unethical
Why genetical engineering should be not ethical
And i'm not joking
I was thinking this from a while
Haha
In decades
Just think how weird the colonial race to mars will be
What politics are not whacky nowadays
I was like, wtf
I remember one guy from Philippines telling me he believed that a good solution to most problems is a military dictatorship
Pluralism?
Help me a sec
Claiming they were protecting the italians during the travels
We had freaking patrols of people dressed in black on trains in north italy
Eeeeh you talking to me about that, we just had a nationalistic pm
Lol wat
Murica has european ancestry in the end
And i live in the freaking most catholic country in the world
I'm saying that religion and politics should not merge
Basically mankind is not yet wise enough to handle it
Got it anyways
GAttaca?
Hm the answer would be no rakhi
I mean i get the danger, and i get that humanity has the tendency of abusing everything
Yes but think of making substitute organs
I understand but it could be used for medical purpose, it's like the nukes, you can use them to mass murder or to generate power in plants
this person should be rewarded.
tho of course if someone does kill its own ass off to accomplish a great goal
Welfare system doesn't discourage people from working
is not worthy of quality of life
he says that someone who **doesn't** want to contribute
oh wait i think i got what he's trying to say
and just can't find a decent job
carlos there are people that want to work
this too
^
but you do deserve a min of quality of life
Poverty is not deserve for sure
hmm
i don't think he deserves to be kicked saki
where carlos?
yeah illindus is right
so the discussion is just pointless
the lazy poor from the hardworking poor
the point is that you can't divide
Carlos
it must be balanced.
too much welfare goes in the other way
can i say one thing on this matter mel?
so the point is not valid
you can't tell the difference
yeah
eh i know that
who don't want to work
to lazy people
he's still referring
They should be compensated if there is a reason because they're not working
from the sad and unlucky poor
you can't really tell apart the lazy
that's the issue
you're all amazing
but i do suggest to wind down the discussion
and anyways i gotta go now
welfare is needed
that's not a reason to remove welfare
but of course
but they got dirty money AND welfare money
they're declared with 0 income
There are people here getting welfare money even if they work under the shadows
and one last thing mel
Yeah blackraiden got why we need a welfare system
so i don't remember much of that
np i was 6 when this happened
reminded me that
the whole welfare system discussion
and no worries
no not your fault mel
eeeh that remembers my poor dead grandma that died of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, she asked for help to our welfare system and they denied giving her economical support until the end.
She got the money she needed just a month before dying
the welfare system is a MUST have to get a country running in an humane way
there is no solution anyways
this
^
there are people working in the shadows here and getting help from the welfare system since they declared they're poor
even if they're a minority
mel there are people abusing that system tho
i think carlos is just talking about abusing the welfare system
same^
i think they're just talking back to your argument
i don't think anyone is telling you to change
and having discussions is what normal people do
we are talking between civilized people
plz
carlos playing the victim doesn't make you shine
^
but hey mods call
cya later
but the thing needed to be declared
matt is not wrong
than have stupid people assuming stuff out of nowhere
i prefer to have this openly declared by an authority
Yes i agree
i hope it comes the day where the humanity gets over such idiocy
ugh
ye
eh
please explain i'm curious now
Lol?
like "what?!"
extreme religious people believing it's safe since it's not standard water
i made the example of holy water
yeah
i didn't want to be mean there
Sorry if it sounded bad
is not a wise thing to do
i wanted to say that putting religion in front of safety
it came out wrongly sub
it's important
for yourself people
have more love
humans <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
"excuse me sir, but how LGBT is supposed to be dangerous?"
i would love an explanation
Take care
Well better than nothing i guess
Usually it's not people choice if they're not educated
Lack of education is a bane
But yeah lemme rephrase my opening statement
In 5 years
Now, i don't know how much the situation improved
Look i worked for save the children, we were sending money to educate the lower members of indian society
This is what i believe at least
At least basic one
But yeah education is a must
x_x
See? I'm brainfarting
I was thinking of that but my half asleep brain is half working
I agree whiskey
Tho do not misunderstand me, it's not people fault if they're not educated
Basic one
Everyone needs a bit of knowledge
Where a feudal lord was all we needed
We are not in the dark ages
Well uneducated people are always a bane
we are struggling with capacity right now here
less people vote the more the system wont work properly
without even going to vote
and it's made worse by people that are alienating themselves from political life
and right now we have an imposed government since the last one fell
but not when anarchy rules the political parties
solo
in a normal situation it works
betrayals, parliament not being able to pass on laws, parties claiming they want to go to the vote earlier, and so on
and it's been chaos in the latest years
we use that here in italy
multi party system has its huge drawbacks
watch out
with 8 ball?
what do you mean
we are becoming too many on this planet and we need a new one if we want more humans
another example is space exploration tech progress
US citizens doing an arms race
i just heard on the news?
And wtf
the kiss on the cheeks to greet a friend
^ this too
so since the virus main victims are old age men and women, rip
and they're a lot
our old people are very old
and last thing, Italy is the second oldest country, age wise
with some joint foreign help too
but now we are starting to handle it
we were not prepared, the prime minister is the first one that panicked for days (and he's still panicking but trying to get his shit together)
since our population is smaller we don't have that many hospitals
italy main problem is the overwhelmed system
i confirm
well i hope this period ends asap
weird stuff
haha i heard about that
hi dess
i'm italian sub
our prime minister is pretty stumbling on himself
+900 more infected just today
well we still have a disaster in our hands
https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-covid-19-11964493
leave this channel for serious discussions
pls people
a grocery shop
we have to make turns to enter
it's like a common thing to see
Eh
This was unexpected
What?!
ye
else the isps themselves would have done something ages ago
Money overrules the politics
guys there is a whole business standing up on VPNs, botnets, servers and so on
but i've never searched enough on the subject and the media transmit us what they want so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
like as he lost ground right from the start
from what i've been following, sanders seemed too much lackluster
in italy
but yeah lockdown will be "renewed/modified" on 23th april
lol that's funny
but the risk is still insanely high
is starting to flatten here
the infection curve
and just wears down the mind
infact we have both private healthcare and public "free" one
but i think that enterprises should be free to invest in whatever is legal to do so
i'm in favor for welfare systems
you will get some halfassed post apocalyptic movie
if you put competition with like police
mel is right
^
2 months.
i had on my leg for like
the cast
oh the 80€ included
but never surpass like 100€
public ones range on the type you need
here only private ambulances cost that much
that much mel?
GOD
and i had to pay 600€ of rehab
you can't make health care completely free, you have to ask something for the service, else the thing wont support itself.
Here we have a welfare system that works by letting the patient pay a small part of it when he uses it.
For example i broke my knee 2 years ago and i had to pay 80€ worth of ambulance
"mafia", "n'drangheta", "camorra" and "sacra corona unita"
we have 4 main criminal organizations
(just an example)
We have italian criminal organizations to fight off, even if they're losing ground they're still a drain of money
make that 20p, 50p now.
*Corruption Suppression*
You know where the problem is?
lol maya we said the same thing
but it's *drastically better* than calling a 3k€ ambulance
NHS is taxed.
but this is italy, governors would get shot in the head if it was bound to rise
simplest one like 3,50€
4€-5€
a pizza here costs like
none of that here
the corpo loses my money.
because if i don't buy the corpos product cuz of high price
that's half true
hmmm
but min tax for the fuel is 11%
Fuel is taxed on the usage
is taxed 4%
primary stuff like bread
4%, 11% and 22%
italy has 3 VAT taxes
before 2011.
i miss when we had 20% VAT.
last year we were risking an 23%
are unrelated with 22% vat
the problem is those brackets
italy does that
???
yes
^
but it fell
tried to hard push flat tax
Last government
you get angry
by a 500€
Yes but that moment when you slip in the later bracket
and VAT 22%
we have more brackets here
60% tax rate
can reach
eeeh our enterprises here
"NHS doesn't cover this sorry"
they asked 3k€ for each eye
i'm nearsighted, i did a visit for a laser treatment
or else, for example on myself
we are talking of several thousands of €
it came to my mind that the cost of treating cancer is ridiculously high
to NHS discussions
anyways returning
good for you
to a life prison
we can range by decades of prison
than if it wasn't
gets a drastically worse sentence if they can prove you're related to a criminal organization
look here the a crime
and sorry to everyone if i drifted the topic away
eh
since it's a looong discussion
all those 4 have their roots in southern italy, there's an historical reason for this, i wont delve further
our military police constantly "raids" them
they are not that powerful to pull off crap like that nowadays
not very recent.
this is stuff of the 90s by the way
by making their car blow up
he killed 2 judges who were on his tail
but he was brutal
i don't recall the details
with one of its bosses guilty of having killed a kid in a barrel of acid
Mafia is the most known one
you don't see those 4 on the streets, they work in the shadows
other problem is the protection money those 4 drain from poor small/medium enterprises
and guess what? or the bridge is not finished or it's half assed (we had a recent case of this in Genoa, it went down killing dozens of people)
those 4 are a problem when you have to pay a guy 100k for a bridge and the guy spends only 50k on the bridge and steals the other half
and is on the last legs
the last one is lower key
it's ridiculous
go on
i'm listening
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073> wrong channel but i've read "A new way to chat with your communists and friends"
well i would be angry too
lol
that's a very bad thing
oh god
Rip
Take care emily
but the past is past.
and that's normal as it should be
everyone changes over time
this too
^
imho
radical wings are never good
like Fascim is anti-anything that has centralized authority outside of the ruling party
basically yes
like Fascism does too
Communism kinda tends to go against religion
Poland has the hugest inflation of all EU countries
i heard from my friend, things are dire there rn
Rip poland indeed
ye
i had the cast for a month and half (during halfway summer) and had to relearn how to walk
it sucks.
even if it was a minor fracture
ugh i know the feel of losing the ability to walk
lol really?
Ye i'm sorry i got distracted
engine wise
PSO2 is still a 2013 game
and not that much different than early discord
it was a great program
(2009-2010)
i used teamspeak back in the day
it took just a couple of hours to me
everyone has its times
i speak for personal experience and 3rd party experience
Voice chat is ankward only if you're not used to it
i need to break a spear in favor of voice chat
the others kinda lost contact with me
school people? only a close friend remained to me
hell we had a blast.
i've even met some online ones
i have a both irl friends and online ones
it's wrong to try to set an objective value to it
but yeah, friendship has a subjective meaning
no hard feels lec
i didn't want to be mean
this is my honest opinion of course
but he should think a bit more
coke you are right in a sense
it's tiresome for whose spend their time helping you
but don't come here asking help if you don't want to follow this channel advices
you're free to do everything you want
people are complicated, saying otherwise would mean denying centuries of philosophers
lec
and has a sister
he killed his brother, he found out he was working with US government and killed him
No lol
will step up as next dictator
Media think that his sister
but there's a rumor of him being already dead
this is what CNN is telling around
The US is monitoring intelligence that suggests North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, is in grave danger after undergoing a previous surgery, according to a US official with direct knowledge.

A second source familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the US has been closely monitoring reports on Kim's health.
i was not joking lol
yes
he got diabetes too
sure thing is that he was critical
It's to be confirmed
Uh local medias are speaking around of a potential "already dead" kim jong-un
eu citizens can live in whatever eu country they desire
why being an EU citizen has its perks
this is one of the reasons
good luck with your project
i do not live there, but i have a friend who complains about it who lives there
in norway
not to turn you down but you do know that housing prices are sky high
think to japanese people
yeah it's an old thing
i eat something light at breakfast, first serving at lunch and seconds at dinner
but hey each its own
i don't agree with that
~~where is /pol/ at~~
Lmao
we had mass murders led by radical lefties before the 2000s
i don't agree with that
no
that's  true too
at least now information can be shared more easily
you just notice them more now
they always were dumber
i don't feel the masses are getting dumber
like we still have problems with assisted suicide here cuz italy while being a laic country the majority of the population is catholic
but forcing the hand on it, is
Religion is not wrong
But before 2010s people were less informed
ugh
~~i wasn't joking aya ~~
we will colonize space one day, we have to change
stagnation is **always** bad
society **must** change
cya lat8r
and with this i need to go to do some stuff
ps: soy mayonnaise is fucking great
this is my opinion
it's just too good, and you have to appreciate everything in life
i wont debate on this, each its own but i would not like avoiding meat
i just had some lentils at lunch
and we got lots of pulses too
i know
*are* everywhere in italy
well milk products
but i don't like the idea of it
i didn't say it's bad in the whole convo
no no i'm not judging it
lol rip aya
is like the main one
look i do live in a place where the mediterranean diet
but it's just too much of an hassle.
well impossible is a big word i retract that
japanese people and italians have lots of elders because we eat balanced diets.
anyways balance is the key of everything
no well i was joking
but you are short sub!
is in red meat
like vitamin b12
i don't agree, some nutrients are abundant only in meat
you can't dodge meat, you have to balance it
infact they got taller when meat was implemented in their diet again
and they do eat meat.
it's like 70% veggies
than fish aya
more veggies
eating 6 times a day
what happened to your hands?
(and i was not joking) but yeah
please take care of your hands!
what did you do <@!203444794737950720>
but yeah zugai, i love naps, so in case i feel tired i just go and sleep, i'm a lucky case that can sleep whenever and wherever
i hate hot summers too
well <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
lol
7 C really kerrik?
LOL
but i can understand the necessity of showering more
Look if i'm not sweating heavily (FREAKING 40+ C SUMMER I HATE YOU), i wash body parts. In normal non sweaty times i do showers like 4-3 times a week
Lol
eh
cuz bacteria like that place
Look in theory only certain parts of the body are heavily subject to smell, like the armpits
Sometimes is one thing kerrik
ofc this is not an excuse to be lazy and be dirty
and hair yeah, avoid washing it daily, hair roots are a frail thing
Tbh, Skins can get damaged too if you shower too much
(sry didn't notice the channel)
😓 Humidity
30%
💨 Wind speed
5.7 m/s
🌡️ Temperature
26.2°C / 79.2°F
where i live rn
certain places
anyways uh lec you should just cut out
let's say that radical left doesn't exist anymore in italy, central left is just there for the money, central right has mafia involved, radical right ridiculizes itself on a daily basis
lmao
you can't enter the parliament with a 2,99%
of 3%
well we have a bar
since 2011.
and they can't freaking decide anything anymore
in the parliament
nah we have like 7-8 political parties
the colors kinda lost meaning
cuz they get the pension from it
here they just rush for their seat in the parliament
well here we have the granddaughter of Mussolini, who thinks her grandpa was 100% right and did nothing wrong, and she leads a radical right party
so i had to ask
the political landscape is so different from what i'm used to in my country
okay okay, thanks for the explanation
oh ok
they're neo-nazis
Lol, why that term then?
i'm sightly confused by the discussion, alt-right as in?
else you're out.
3% to enter parliament
we have a bar
hm
fptp?
like no assisted-suicide, abortion and stuff
that goes in hand in hand to certain political decisions
italy is the most catholic country in the world.
The thing is shem, that even while being a laic state
and lost everything they had 3 years ago
populists got dunked hard
we got like 12 parties in our parliament
lol nah, it doesn't work like that here
you can't really put the stress of managing a government to a 80+ years old guy
but he's gotten old.
and a brilliant enterpreteneur, setting aside his shady deals
he's a competent person
Look i still think
until in 1999 our "dear" silvio berlusconi free the right wing
yeah but in our case, people were scared of right wings
look italy is Right-oriented
i'm sure of it
this time around we will get Central right
they wont succeed
They failed last legislation.
Alt right in italy?
the hell?
We got this historical leftist politician who claims that China is doing the right thing
Yes
hell even kim jon un doesn't compare to this shitshow
ye one of the biggest of recent times
i feel really bad for hong kong tho
denies your statement
State of emergency
trump would just get re-elected
i feel in this time period
i'm not talking about War.
it's in human nature isky
of course you need welfare for those who cannot do so
Humans need to compete to advance, history has proven that several times
@capitalism
look shem, some degree of free market is a needed thing
i don't loiter around 4chan boards, i told you what mel told me
^
Capitalism is not alt right.
uh
because of gundam
/m/ got some /pol/ incursions
look from what mel has told me
i didn't see that coming
SOUTH PARK
something something */pol/* something something */m/*
ye those stupid little cases happening around
of course
people need to wake the fuck up
i think IF's post is legit
wtf those people in the comments?
expressing their concern
where's the problem of a software house/game publisher
hm
IF?
free to do so
but yeah hectan
who wanted the crown back
this discussion makes me think a friend of mine
traditions
you know shem
as the UK Crown has
and he got around the same power
our head of state gets elected by the parliament on a different time
and the PM is NOT the head of state
our ministers are chosen out by the party with majority of votes
is different than parliamental one
well presidential system
(as many oldies from that time think)
her grandpa was 100% right
but she still thinks
so it ain't gonna work.
The thing is, she doesn't have the personality of his grandpa
3% is not enough to do shit
she wont make past the bar, and even if she does
got like 2%?
Mussolini's granddaughter's party of radical right
Last time we voted
and that's why we can't change as the day rises and fall
that's a legit way of thinking
the point is that you can't change the current system like that, because humanity as a whole needs to slowly realize the things
Because humankind has "This is mine" in the blood
it's indirect
Greed makes you create things to get over others
yes but new advancements are made because there's incentive to do so
surely it wont be like the perfect selfaware scifi thing
and side note i don't think that AI will not evolve enough in our lifespan
i'm no social expert of any sort
it could be, it could be not
i can't really say anything to your statement isky but it's a gamble to say that the same would happen by extending the theory to the whole mankind
Rad that doesn't mean i can't brainstorm and discuss about such theories
Small groups is not the same at the whole humanity
it's just a theory
but you can't deny the risk
because we never had everything aviable
expecially if we go into the AI territory
if we lose basic labour it's alright, but automation should not replace human mind
that's a dangerous statement, mankind could stagnate if loses the drive to try and find new stuff
basically
Utopic Paradise
hm
this round ball of dirt and water can't sustain so many humans if they don't help themselves
we are nearly 8 billions people.
more efficiently
mankind will need it more and more imho, since we need to maximize the food production
it's a good subject
slowly but yes^
when the printer clogs, when you have to switch the cartridges and so on
nowadays we have tech support
but the job of managing the machine to print arose
Copying books by hand died
the printing press
We had an example on this
and nothing stops technology to reach a level when it wont be so expensive as it is nowadays
it's an example nevis
what those who used to do this job will do after it gets automated?
you wont need hands to take care of the soil
automating agriculture
let's take for example
I mean, some jobs might disappear or mutate in something else when automating stuff
problem about automation, it's not a thing you can do on the fly, the population has to adapt to it
There's one
these statements always leave me speechless
People should be free to be whatever they wants
i'm not in LGBT category but it's a sad thing to witness
yeah

hypocrisy
kinda serious
yeah exactly
of course since the brain is the brain, some mental states can trigger different types of dreams
there's no such proof of this of course
Some believe they hold some meaning
and can be pretty much very randomic
Dreams are the byproduct of the brain reorganizing the memory department
true @games political things
Nice art
The one where you actually help the creator
Constructive criticism is the best
i mean, i gotta appreciate the honesty of the police officer but that's just bad
just why
Else it doesn't exist
Retroactivety is specified the law
Yeah
it's a good advice
And i agree with this
it took a while to make him understand that's not depression
depression is an huge word
i had my brother feeling like that
Yes pharios
i'm glad to hear you're getting support for that
Good
usually people answer
this channel is the right place
and if you need to vent about something
takes years to raise life and nothing to shutdown it
and don't forget that life is important
take care meiyi
<:HibikiAwe:688397678572339230>
you got a life insurance?
anyways pharios, value yourself more, i don't have anything more to say
were dark for a reason
but dark ages
were one thing
i mean Classical ages
but also worse.
time machine boyz
and that's about it
we are not in 900 ad where you would end up as a craftsmen/merchant/soldier/farmer
Yes if you don't search, you can't know "look i actually like this"
right now i'm unemployed but i'm starting stuff soon (hopefully)
i wont hide i had my black time where i was being thrown by a job to another
you will find out what you want to do
maybe experience things
don't rush yourself
but yeah back on the topic
lmao
my brother turns 21 on the 18th august
Lion sign
(i turn 27 the 8th august)
i'm 27 and only recently decided what i want to try to do
Pharios
yes and no
is a crooked and wrong idea
same by italian law
a friend of mine understood how to plug a graphic card without any skills whatsoever only by watching a tutorial
we live in digital information age
and this^
you're not that old.
how old are you again pharios?
fun how a ruler can be the item or a king
we advance by learning from who was before us
^ this is what human is about
several times
i've been made joke of that
like my manual skills are fucking bad
yes i agree
hmmm
stolen question
^
Inability to help is relative, not everyone can help anyone, each of us has its own area of expertise
jokes of others? tell that to the japanese, humor is personal
interests, subjective, i'm sure you will find someone that shares your interests
negativity well, you have to value yourself more i can't really say much
pharios why do you think you're a nuisance?
yeah
gud
i'm an idiot, sorry lmao
oh you were metaphorically speaking
hm
now lol
but i feel very confused
well meiyi, i don't see nothing wrong about such thing
no
but not always the discussion is something that i can say about
rad
i do visit serious
it was 100% new to me, i mean i knew there was something like that but i didn't think to that extent
woh
it goes to that extent?
uh
i really didn't know about this
thanks for making me understand
gotcha
Oh
i think i've got it
hm
so it's someone identifying in multiple selfs?
awake one at each time?
are those "Selfs"
rip
as i figured
Okay
legit
Lol
okay
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Rakhi this makes me think, who answered my questions in DM?
Okay
oh dear
So it's you... and?
uh LOL
but i didn't know abou that
yeah i've never asked
okay let's say, i've noticed sometimes people mentioning "Plural" in chat
let me think how to phrase that <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
wrong.
Yeah that came out
but knowing about this subject feels like mind blown now, i swear i never questioned because, hmmm, i never dared to?
"No what?"
imagine "But you know *insert language here*!"
oh dear
lol
sometimes feels like you doubt my words sub, like that time we were discussing about vegetables
ye dw sub i figured that
well i'm glad i've come to know this subject, thanks you all for enlightening me. And yes after knowing it, i don't see why i wouldn't be chill with something like that
LEGIT
hm
So it's a matter of "Different" = "Bad"
okay
hm
but why someone should be against such thing?
look it's hard to imagine from the outside, but i got the concept
ok
right?
did you block aria?
Yes
was rather chill
But that discussion
^
LOL ARIA
and i got answered
that's why i asked before, "where would be the problem in accepting such thing?"
mind = blown
it's like 750€
for a 20 km train/bus ticket?
hmmm like aria how much do you pay
has very high criminal rate
eeeh mexico
lmao
like rad's country has potatoes instead of money
and the factor of having € or not influences it
yeah regarding that europe differs on the country
is insane.
B U R O C R A C Y
and BUROCRACY
Italy is nice but, lots of corruption and unemployment
each one of us got its own problem
on the country
Europe *drastically* depends
yet so real for many people
it's so ridiculous
but smile at solo statement
i can't help
"And social welfare is communism for them"
He said that "Usually americans think as capitalism is the same worldwide without social welfare"
with a friend of mine the other day
Okay i was talking
going to that extent is dire, i'm pretty sad to hear that in any case
rip
sad
oh
it feels like you lost something
being jaded sucks anyways
but we need to replace them
they're too much polluting
as soon as possible
We should stop using fossil fuels
i didn't know this
. Nanoengineered materials such as carbon nanotubes and, more recently discovered, graphene ribbons (perfect two-dimensional sheets of carbon) are expected to have breaking lengths of 5000–6000 km (50–60 MPa/(kg/m3)), and also are able to conduct electrical power
oh btw
in the elevator sense of the things
climbers
that would work with
you drop a cable from a counterwieght
is the opposite rn
the option of the space elev
but yeah
wikipedia doesn't agree isky
Nevis it would just require Political Effort
Currently available materials (such as Kevlar) are strong and light enough that they could be practical as the tether material for elevators there
anyways regarding space elev mats
to overcome
NIMBY should a bit easier
we are talking of EU
but since
like from portugal to eastern EU
would work
even across europe
^
oh
^
launch loop?
hm
how much high could we build a space elevator
in renewable option
should be the coolest option possible
finding a good way to place solar panels in orbit and send the output down on earth
hm
for sure
<@!203444794737950720> that's reaching weird levels
LOL
oh i didn't know kat was polish too
want your opinion
https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/25/polish-populism-evening-news-public-broadcaster-presidential-election?CMP=fb_cif&__twitter_impression=true&
<@!203444794737950720> <@!354236264595324928> my friend linked me this
the humankind must mature, at least we are drastically better than 50 years ago
and it is just very sad
mental health problems in the same way
not all the world recognizes
but yeah sadly
You have people that can hear your venting here
this is all i think you can do
stay close to her and support her if she needs it
sub i feel really sad for your friend, i hope she manages to get out from this sticky situation
yeah wrong time, wrong place rad
Rad please this is a serious channel
something like that
dunno maybe the subject is key to a crime
(here ofc)
if a judge orders to do so.
Look privacy can only be broken
you are still bound by privacy
changes anything here
i don't think being public or private
it has become even heavier
expecially after EU updated privacy laws
no questions asked
Privacy is **mandatory**
in court
it could get prosecuted
if a counsellor does that here
this is so sad
bs tests are bs
What happening
it only leads to bad consequences
the thing is pretty dire
it's ridiculous
for real?
LOL
@polandpolitics
<@!203444794737950720> <@!354236264595324928> 
From my friend 
`` Propaganda tv getting more absurd with each day
Crazy storm yesterday, huge chunk of the country got flooded
Meanwhile on propaganda tv
"It's the fault of opposition"
``
sad
Oh that thing
if i may ask
what are you talking about?
exaggerating is the problem
i think that tattoos in the right places and of the right  size are okay, they even look good
^
it may
Yes of course
eh
i'm just giving my 5 cents on the matter
of course feel free to contradict me
i think it just feels awkward and weird
there's no need to force such process.
evolves
certain terms will be dropped slowly overtime, since the language itself
of course those are my opinions
if a shirt is black, it is black.
just because of racial reasons
We didn't discover and name colours
White/black lists is where the thing is just plain out ridiculous
master/slave is an "asspull", you can consider those uncomfortable but are they? Those do not refer to any living beings anymore, we are talking of inanimate abstract systems
and it's not gendered.
since the term mankind exists
changing man hours is just not going to obtain anything
I see that just as bald faced shield as "look we are not racist, take this candy as proof"
I don't think that kind of change is going to help reduce any kind of racism
And not help anything
I want to be honest, changing IT terms like master/slave is just going to create confusion
and their freedom being robbed
people getting arrested
basically CN forcing new laws on them
eh
i'm a bit speechless.
Anyways changing topic i'm following the HK thing on the news
yeah
from my friend
they are scumbags anyway
since yesterday, silence is up
yet they still kept placing more posters
everywhere
for him
will see how it goes, but if he wins, this country is fucked
we are already on the way to becoming hungary 2.0
<@!203444794737950720>
Void Vote is another thing.
is that it equals to voting the winner.
the thing about not voting
i'm curious of the clown fiesta
<@!203444794737950720> keep us updated
`` Dayt 1 of post election propaganda news.
Short version
All media that are not pro gov, are evil, and need to be nationalized or removed.
``
<@!203444794737950720>
oh dear
don't worry kat
and that's sadly true for at least of 2/3 of the main mediaset channels
i agree with you
^
and yeah that host is a good one
so sometimes such stuff is required
look racism in italy is a particular topic because we have immigrant waves
yes they did
y
i linked the speech above
yeah
it still sucks ofc
to let the host speak against racism.
because that episode was probably made on purpose
for that reason
well the show doesn't suck
but yeah that stuff was just out of context
i didn't notice
oh i'm sorry
discussed above
already
okay first thing firsts: i dislike that kind of dumb show to the core
The show must be put in context, every time there's a different category, of course if you pick the screenshot it looks plain bad.
in the same twitter "on lyoko" answered by linking this
https://twitter.com/lyoko_on/status/1281597575209136128
Did something bad happen aya?
Younglings fuck it up
200 to 350
we have an increase in infected here too
ugh
And i'm sorry if i'm overstepping since it should not regard me but it hurts when i see two good persons fighting
PS: i've not read, and i'm not interested to, @thediscussionabove
i think i've conveyed my message
and i believe the "old farts" here remember past conflicts
This is a nice place because people are **able** to moderate themselves, but as humans are humans, sometimes sparks are lit
"I don't agree with this and i prefer to stand down"
Retiring from discussions is also a good way to go
this is also a good tip
^
tbh
the world would be shit.
and opinions
If everyone had the same ideas
or at least try
but yeah everyone, please be nice and civil to eachother
i tend to not accept irrationality
when i get angry is always a shitfest, because for me it's logic, or logic
one needs to be able to stop the blood rush, and trust me i'm one of the worst ones in this matter
sometimes blood rushes to people heads and things happen
to "challenge" the situations
but Stopping for a moment, analyzing the situation and ponder on the both parts is really a good way
otherwise the world would be fucked
i know it's not my place to judge people and situations, expecially as an outsider but, please people, it's normal for us humans to be in conflict with eachother sometimes
i know about that
ye ye America's Army Game
I mean this method is more invasive
this kind of thing is worse imho
and while that's not wrong by itself
I know about that mel
Military Recruiting on Twitch?
The heck?
but in general it's a thing
of course
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Oh legit
since viruses get stronger with cold weather
in autumn
will be a thing
second wave
lol
Eh
basically
south italy is covid free
but we managed to bring the thing down to only one region
Italy failed in the quick response part
here friends greet eachother with kisses on the cheecks.
look kaiyo you don 't know how hated is this situation italy since it goes against our culture by default
for example, leaving the fact that i'm italian aside from a moment, i'm kinda "meh" when people point fingers against Christopher Columbus
because mankind evolves on past mistakes/goodthings
History must never be forgotten, both in the good and in the bad
oh you mean british imperialistic spires
at?
What are you referring
and annexed things
Eeeh mei, i think there's no "right" and "wrong" in war
and it's hard as fuck to join the armed forces
we just have volunteers
but keep in mind italy doesn't have a draft/reserve anymore
We just sent our soldiers to balkans to do peacekeeping
back in the day
we had to deal with other internal threats
that is something far greater
oh well
Oh well lol
they are peacekeeping interventions
but
hey italy still does missions
we don't have propaganda
True enough
you want that uniform
but you have to *feel*
and joining an armed force is not something that i would call bad
like here they do those conventions where they talk to students and explain what they do
to high schoolers is wrong
showing Army and armed forces stuff
i don't believe
Coup D'etat^
it's a western country bound by laws
no way he will manage to delay it
Then if Trump doesn't do a Coup D'etat
that's another place i dislike the way is going to
Oh speaking of turkey
the thing was forced to be toned down by COVID
the Drone Attack
^
he still meddles.
and Trump not being interested in outside affairs is just bs
tbh
i don't think the recent rioting thing will go that way
on nationalist countries
it's just a backfire from pouring the whole "immigrant bottle"
I think of that as Temporary Bubble
it's only a matter of when imho
The era of dictatorships has ended
at certain point the thing will just break, one way or another
no matter the effort of censorships
Centralized one is doomed to fail with Globalization
to make it work kat
but that's the only way
and i honestly don't believe that NK falling is too much far fetched
to stop americanization of china
there will be **no** cushion state
Like if NK falls and gets "muricanized"
it would mean china fragmentation started
it's the consequence of letting HK go
i fixed the sentence
"Oh look i can claim independency too"
(Again)
China falls as a whole
because the moment HK becomes independent
That's not just Chinese ego in work
this is the only legit option i can think of
Hong Kong should be independent
the people will just go "hurr durr nationalism"
if you pour the whole bottle
Immigration should be dosed slowly
that's Social Backfire.
no that's not how it works
Lol
i really dislike what China is doing there
but CCP is also drastically wrong
imho
Oh retaking HK is wrong
many in italy believe that trump will manage to renew his mandate
And i hold the same opinion of gwen
Keep here serious
Please you guys
Well right..
Oh that
did it go bad?
Rei, you really can't sleep without them?=
so of course when we are left alone we suffer...
humans are a social being after all
eh you're not wrong in that statement
mental health is important as physical one
I can only say stay safe
sometimes the world is just unjust and wrong
and makes feel me sad
i feel the pain in your words, you all in general
i've read the backlog the other day
i understood that
Hm
Self-Esteem is important
much much more.
you all should value yourself more
People
😦
So it's also a matter that now your body is just used to these sleeping pills
people getting shitscared
an external threath will have the same consequence as the nukes that stopped WW2
i have the same opinion as solo
Humans <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
it's insane
i was about to post it
Oh god
but i'm italian
put rady aside
SEVERAL times i swear.
irl
ooooh i've heard that
a disaster
that statement would be
LMAO
look a statement "i'm into asians" remembers me what dumb and immature kids from high school do
sadly
oh contexts like that do exist
uhm?
and people do not understand where one thing ends and the other starts
and we live in a society where sometimes things are mixed
the point is recognizing where the racism line starts
That is not necessarily a fetish
There's also the thing about having preferences tho
"i like exotic lineaments from asia"
Look there can be the context where the "i like asians" is an very bad oversimplification of
stereotypes are always bad
it's like describing an italian like someone who lives around pizza, mandolino, berlusconi, pasta, mafia
eh of course
and i've heard people say "i'm into polish and swedish girls"
Tho some people are just reserved as i said
or there are people that are just that reserved
it could be that she doesn't trust you enough (sad how it may be)
legit point^
and see if the problem persists
i think you should wait
nd are alive now
Both found their light
Or my father saved a young man from jumping from a cliff
Thanks god she didn't have" the guts"
I knew a girl who attempted suicide by drinking a solvent
Some closer
Some are far
You were a teen back then
Look, it's important to never give up
Hm okay
How old are you?
Look matt
Even the smallest thing counts in these situations
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
yeah you given us enough hints here and there, take it slowly, do not force yourself to do anything
My mother complains to me that i don't vent out enough and i keep everything to myself
not everyone is willing to tell stuff to outsiders, not even in the family
Then keep walking, stay tall, bumps on the road can happen
Every one of us has something dark
I wont hide i a couples of times threw my mistakes on others and bailed out
Realizing own mistakes is not easy
Matt not everyone is mature enough to do what you are doing
But matt is a good person in my mind
it's still wrong
When matt called it out like that
Tbh i was thinking to much worse things
Mine didn't change
I like this channel, both in the good moments and bad ones
Serious?
The important thing is that you've realized that you were wrong
I've met people like that sadly, but the past is the past
Hm understood
I wont
Still a young man
There's always time for correcting one's behaviour
Is that you're you and were young
The point i'm thinking of matt
ah okay
i don't like physical exertion and mask combined
uhm
(something like that)
which you can roll once a year
the only money i spent was 15€ on FGO guaranteed gacha
my accounts are 95% F2P
but i never whale.
i enjoy gacha games A LOT
Meiyi speaking from my experience
Sadly this is how defective human brain is
Both moneywise and both psychologically
I think that would be better for your friend to sell the account and at least recover something out of it
Gacha games can be the same as going to the casino and destroying your savings
I have one who wasted 400€ on Ereshkigal without dropping her
Poor friend
Ugh that's when the gambling becomes an addiction
well then
ah
remember, innocent until proven guilty
Well we don't know the dynamics or if the charges are true
it's not the rule
Yeah but i assure you that's an exception
Bruxelles is there.
Belgium is a special case
What do you think would happen if a member state is left with no stable government?
It depends more on "how urgent" and "how critical" is the intervention
the separatist streak in aragon/barcellona area was doomed to fail from the start
Since by law EU must protect members sovereignity
in Spain Situation
remember how eu imposed itself
I think it's more that no critical hit has been dealt
i mean EU is already fining poland for some stuff iirc
there are things that EU wont ignore
rady, remember poland is an EU member instead
so anything can happen
that Belarus is not an EU member
Well the thing is
Nomad would be a too much wide and incorrect term (used during XIX century)
Of course any term can be used offensively
Since well every culture has a name
So there is also the problem of defining their culture with a name without being offensive
Romani is used for their language instead
Tho i should note that italian government *does* use the italian equivalent of gipsy ("zingaro") in official document
Romani is the closest accurate term
If we are referring to that specific cultural group
aegyptanus seems to be the original latin term
That is maybe a thing before the spqr
Is that is so old
The weird thing about the gipsy word as i found
once again.
in <#336297387863703552> i'm disgusted
Regarding what had been told
Quarantine?
Uuh
Since all humans are flawed
But know that the perfect parent doesn't exist
Hm don't feel that way
Look the god complex is a common thing
Yeah, on what you're describing your mom is a bit too much oppressive
It's complicated
Hm
How old are you again fizzy?
That's a bit overstepping on her part...
Uh
Until she cools down
You have to wait
I can feel the distress, being accused like that is hateful
Ugh
sleep is important
take care aria
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
yeah sorry it's the thing made me angry, i can't stand such things happening for petty reasons
nowadays
such thing can pass unobserved
i cannot believe
The canada thing
Like sit at the table and try to reach some kind of understanding
While she is not angry
Talk with your mom
Btw fizzy
Yeah
So like 15.  Eur
God
I really hope you manage to get treated...
Here the state would cover part of the treatment
It's sad that there is no nhs in these situations
Immunodepressants
I mean
If not treated
That's a very dangerous disease
Eeeh
I remember you telling us about asymptomatic covid
What disease do you have?
Err i mean
Correct me if i'm wrong
Right
Nhs does not help?
9anime is the one i sometimes use when i-m not with my ship on the catsite
in this matter
doesn't help
look China's Behaviour
Look `` Italy and France have developed a missile family called Aster (Aster 15 and Aster 30). Aster 30 is capable of ballistic missile defense. On 18 October 2010, France announced a successful tactical ABM test of the Aster 30 missile[28] and on 1 December 2011 a successful interception of a Black Sparrow ballistic target missile.[29][30] Royal Navy Type 45 destroyers and French Navy and Italian Navy Horizon -class frigates, and FREMM -class frigates are armed with PAAMS, using Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles. It is in developing another version, the Aster 30 block II, which can destroy ballistic missiles at a maximum range of 3000 km. It will have a Kill Vehicle warhead.[31]``
we got freaking cruisers capable of shooting these down
into launching missiles fromland
because the anti ICBM doesn't limit itself
i would tell you to check better
Look nuker
we do, anti ICBM defenses are up and working
we got many methods to shoot these down
Nah i don't think that is a problem nowadays
ICBMs flying outside china?
Spill over as
the scenario where it is left unchecked doing unspeakable stuff is also dire
so me neither, but
I expect it that would be violent
source: past
the more they split
More they are
Internal infighting lankpants
that can't be surpassed
Yeah but there are limits
lols
Well, it's propaganda and censorship...
This is, of course, my view from an outsider PoW
once NK falls down (and it can, from one day to the other), there will be *no* cushion state to slow/stop the americanization of china from SK influence
but
well i'm just making hypothesis
Look the point is
i see it as a bubble that may burst sooner or later
after a certain point
btw i don't think China will keep rising
the hope lies with the new generations
that our differences are not that easy to overcome tbh
it's just that EU countries are so diverse
i think it will become better overtime, even if recents events were not good
but yeah situations do not help us
and soon will be the first
€ *is* the second most powerful currency worldwide
well
(Sometimes i'm glad i live in italy, how corrupted and fucked up our country may be)
between the lesser evils
but yeah
that US behaviour is fine
Oh well i'm not saying
the fact that's a great power it's only adding salt to the wound
Which is very bad
btw i understand
India is also developing its system, japan got its own stuff in the navy and planned PAC-3
this is sad... please humans wake up and realize your mistakes, these kind of things remind me of the middle ages
That's not a warning at all
She leads it since 15 years ago
But they have too few votes to reach the bar of 3% required for the parliament
And leads the far right party
Mussolini granddaughter is in politics
With his populists shenanigans
Salvini got shot down already
Far left will never have enough votes
Right now our government leans on centre-right
Eu right wings rose back in early 2010s, they got a major blow late in the decade in italy for example
I agree with this statement
And right now we are dealing with a rising second wave due to the new migrant wave and turists
But people did not lose faith
As an italian we got the full force of the pandemic
The world doesn't work all in the same way
I see but
As an external i think that things have to get far worse for anything to fall
Active and running
We got like 15 political parties?
Not all the countries work at the same way
For the rest eu is colorful
Voters
For example i am 27 and my ex- classmates are mostly centre right
A zoomer can be of any wings
Don't forget that humanity teachs to the successors
Young people leave left parties and ideologies 70% of the times after leaving university
Yes
Centrists rule, centrists educate, centrists will be elected
They got 0.5%
The far left is not rising at all here
That's france" having fun"
We were not ready of course
It has to be measured to let it work
Because the immigration was all poured over
Oh yes emily
What emily
Nothing will fall apart
The main parties are all right and left centrists
and we are still recovering
Oh well 2011 was the nearest thing we had to the Great Depression
but yeah steam is pretty efficient on that, you can block and block and remove
i know this is serious discussion but the terminal velocity made me laugh
nah here people mostly wear it
ok
ah
PoC as?
like mall, shops, cinemas and so on
of course i put it up in crowded places
Look i admit of not wearing it when i'm a deserted/nearly deserted road, not under 37 c at least
it happened in venice
of a poor chinese tenaage girl that got beaten up by a bunch of guys (4 iirc)around her age just because "Chinese people bring the virus, go back to your country"
reminds me the sad case
that
If i am putting effort, that's it
But i do feel pissed when i lose for petty reasons
Honestly i never got really angry in games
Dating is also expensive
Plus entering stable relationships without a stable source of money, as dry i might sound, is mehhhh
And if the coinflip goes to crap well... That's gonna hurt so much
That explains my stance on love relationships pretty much. The effort might be too great to withstand
it's all grey
there's no black or white in human relationship
anyways yeah i agree
now they're both okay
but it took an hardcore effort from both
they sat and by putting effort managed to go around that and fix the problem
My parents got to an horrible point in their relationship that if continued it would have led to a divorce and they-re married since 28 years ago
The claustrophobic thing is definitely a thing
Oclisto
I disagree on that as well
It's an hardcore component in both
I agree
Uhm. Well if it's a lack of effort that halts a relationship
In the same way
Effort is required in both
But yeah
There are fails and fails. Some irl relationships end in violence
But i also agree that the irl component can be a boost. If a relationship starts online and forever stays that way... Well it could come at an halt. But in the same way an irl one can fail even harder
And both irl
I agree with shem that a relationship can fail both online
then you get your freaking grandpa
yeah
yeah
it is sub lol
but yeah we are getting off
it's my creation
that nickname
no don't
but i understand that point
pissed over that sub
SOme people get
and they live 12 km from here
twice a day.
calls my grandma and grandpa
but for example my dad
yeah yeah i get that
oh yeah that's sure
nearby doesn't mean in the same house, mind you
it's a cultural thing in this case
Cocoa, being an adult doesn't mean you're away from them, many people here prefer to live nearby their parents
**can**
i said
things can go down the stairs tumbling
if an external variable strong like that gets in the way
during middle school (and HS) one is discovering the new self
uhm it depends shem
leave a mark indeed
things like this
i can see that
it was a genuine question
oh yeah don't worry i didn't want to break your privacy
and sad to hear that
got it
hm
(no shem, that's illegal you can't use ver emote after the discussions)
if you don't mind me asking, how did you take it?
i mean
yeah but what about you
that sucks
woh lol
Well i think shem got over that point
so many variables
.
"Hey nephew where is your gf?"
this weekend
has Regional Elections
Half of italy
yeah
you were a teenager back then
And Kaiyo
^ true
some people take more time than others
Time truly heals
Sometimes it could sound dismissal but
???'
(not the pm, the head of state)
after he ends the mandate
for example the head of state becomes a senator
The senate has other ways to get in
incorrect
it's
but the senate requires an older age
you can vote for the deputy chamber at 18 years old
and they choose who to send there
we vote the political parties
okay
600 deputies and 315 senators
we have 2 chambers
<@!203444794737950720> what do you mean?
on these people
the true pro is that we get to reduce how much we spend
they will have even less chance to get into parliament
harms the minorities
a decision like that
Yes but
there's no political colour in this referendum
not even our politicians have a firm view on this change
Yeah it's a paradox rady
the ridiculous thing is that i don't know wtf to vote
from 900 to 600
and a referendum to reduce the number of parliament members
and wasting is bad.
it's just a waste of brain power
in bad cases^
in my case i can get over something that angers me in a timespan of 1 hour
Everyone is different
And hai Emily
What the trends and opinions are in the masses can change in unpredictable ways
We can't really afford to wait forever
Yes but i think that some processes need to be speed up
I am sorry
Well i don't believe in the masses changing ideas out of nowhere
If no one does that, it can make things harder
Changing policies would require someone taking the lead and starting to fight into politics
And
Nah dw i just barged in
Yeah my bad from wording it wrong
Those are natural
I was talking about political struggles
Of course
Which will be always bad
Not about discrimination
I was talking about political situations
I think i warped around the topic
Wait
But it's only natural
Look the situation is not good over around the world
We are not even close to get "matured" investments in renewable energy
Seriously?
Wtf
you are cocoa.
expecially this kind
D:
btw people, imho you should tone down, there's no reason to heat up like that for a discussion
ppls.
during electoral campaigns
Everyone puts plans
while being a TOTAL MESS with 20+ political parties i prefer multiparty systems
with rady
I 100% agree
but we don't know what she would have done neither
You know what you leave you can't know what you gonna pic
who can say that hilary would have been a better alternative while being full funded by Petrol Lords
because is
the system
that to work you would have to switch out
would be so big
to bring the third party up
People, the problem is that the effort with that system of yours
we need those highlanders back in the eu
when?
Scotland separatist referendum
It doesn-t mean that some madman someday cannot change it tho
what a sad system really
~~in b4 a coup d'etat happens ~~
and 20+ parties
Then there's italy with the proportional system
Emily is in UK
THat's why it should be redone
that's why i prefer EU systems with lots of parties
is 3%
to enter senate/chamber
here the bar
i wont derail the discussion more btw, have fun
10/10
Love party and steak party
i REMEMBER THOSE 2
`` Partito dell'Amore ("Love Party", defunct)
Partito Nettista Italiano, known as "Partito della bistecca" (Steak Party, defunct) ``
Italy
**BRING BACK THE KING, FOR THE KING AND CONQUER**
**royalist party of estonia**
but you always have an alternative
see? multiparty systems create weird situations
arrr
yeah lmao
called "Pirate Party"
in EU
a political party
funfact there's
yeah aria i wasn't rebutting
indeed.
it cannot
shit flies
You go against the the congress? bam
it still counts down to 2 political choices.
is STILL A republican or a democrat
is that the president
The problem aria
right?
At least yeah you choose the president but the congress is the one making laws
and nothing else
it's built to stagnate a country to two possible political views
i agree with rady
~~ in b4 he-s planning a coup d-etat~~
lol that
half of the ministers were from the populists and the other half were from nationalists
in tandem
Hell with our system here we had a recent government led by 2 different parties
**borked**
They can overrule any law
which is basically composed by the top dog judges that watch over the parliament/ministers/head of state
Worst case we got the Constitutional Court
to get fixed
and goes back
if it goes vs the constitution the law gets bonked
then the law goes to the head of state which double checks it
and both must agree on the text 100%
Laws **must** pass from both the senate and the chamber
*legiferate*
decrees
but the government can't make nothing more than short emergency
to lead the country
the winning party picks the cool guy and he makes a squad of ministers
Prime minister is in the standard elections
Head of state is elected by the parliament.
or Head of State?
PM you mean?
majority is centre right and centre left
no moar parliament for them next time
but the populist gonna get bonked hard, everyone saw how useless they were
rn we got a mixture of populists, fake nationalists, centre right and centre left people
since ever
so radical views in italy are not a thing
last elections
Communist party with 0,8% and Forza nuova (mussolini's granddaughter fascist party) with 2,5%
(because of covid the vote is split in 2 days)
hopefully tomorrow it goes closer to 50%
this is bad.
got only 29% of the population voting
ugh regional elections + referendum that reduces the parliament member number
people are so stupid.
god
from 900 to 600
the referendum approved cutting the parliament members
This is a disaster
I hope you manage to get to know what happened to your friend
Oh, condolescences kai
History must be left untouched, bad or good it may be because it teaches the new generations on what happens in both cases
To avoid abuse ( in case of T in sport for example)
Ofc it has to be prescribed by the specialist
Both for T and E
So no as i understand it is free free
And such
The article is very long as it is our official news paper filled with laws
Copypasted and translated from the most official source possible
<@170641480791228417>
``Prescription period fully charged to the health service national: until new determination by the Italian Medicines Agency. ``
I have read the official statement
Okay
And we end up wasting
Sometimes it is too much
Our nhs pays aaaaa loooot of stuff here
The medical prescription in italy is fully or partially paid by the nhs depending on the case
Okay i do not know about this but
Uhm i don't know about that
I know that there is a list of meds that will be fully paid by the national health service
I do not have the details, but please explain what you mean
The article has been published on official italian republic newspaper, the one where they publish new laws before enacting them
In the whole country
So now NHS will pay the full price of those meds
It is a step taken after a region decided to do so on its own
(aifa is italian pharmaceutical agency)
AIFA decided that HRT medications will be free in italy
really rei, **never** forget that the tunnel has always an exit on the other side
Reitia i think you should really talk to a specialist about this, i mean no offense
^
i don't know what to say
^
i'm relieved to hear that
^
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
so please, do not stop believing
the light and the means to reach it, are different for each one of us
It's 100% subjective
and you will find it, maybe not now, not tomorrow, but in the future
You have to keep believing that the light is there
I cannot even begin to understand your despair Reitia, you've been through **A LOT**, i'm really sorry if i hurt your feelings, that was not my intent. What i was trying to say is that reality is not always a nice place, but that doesn't mean one cannot get better, and i can understand you not wanting to believe me, or us even, but believing that there's no future is not the right thing to do for starters.
Yes, how far-fetched it may seem
You told me, and it's a lot
This is what i strongly believe.
yes.
good for you, really
well yeah
even if putting my strong dislike for the whole brexit idea aside
it's really a disaster what is happening in UK
i understand, mb then
yeah indeed.
let's say that i found the idea uncomfortable before
i also relate to that
On the current state of things
even if that has improved in the last decade
we just can't
neolatin EU is a no-no if you can't speak the local lang
yeah
like denmark
has english speakers
Northern EU
we were just not prepared the first time
and we have been in lockdown from march to may
we took the full blast of the virus the first time
i live in italy mind you
and this wave is actually weaker than the first
while avoiding going full china/south korea on the restrictions
trying to fight off the pandemic
nah the country itself here is actually
The pm is like working 24/7 and the population is trying to respect the rules
We are in full second wave here but we are quite skillfully limiting it
(they freed themselves from the nazis in ww2, without an army, and this says everything)
Naples, unique under every damn aspect, wants to be unique even with the virus
ffs
+ citizens of naples acting dumbly
+ migrant waves
our new waves in italy are mostly a backfire from august
boom.
so of course if two fail
free trade included
as eu laws say.
eu citizens are free to go wherever they want
and how EU works
to explain you the concept of borders
circles don't ask me
too early
EU is basically in pandemic again because France and UK claimed victory
but yeah
that's for sure
circles
pls
so nothing new
because of their culture
from the start
Japan was a weird cause
eh
claiming victory in this situation is meh
but
i'm not wishing anything to anyone
For how long tho
in the mainland
it's france mainly
bad decision
France and UK failed because they tought they had won
we were going to starve.
nothing much changed but if you kept enterprises closed more than they already have
and our economy? was already bad before
since august
we were already predicting this second increase
and that worked.
for 3 months
Lank we managed 200 cases daily
and the one up in north
the one near naples
but yeah our new cases are focalized in 2 regions
not gonna happen
you're telling italy to cut off tourism completely
aus is in a different situation
wanna sink their ships down? lol
tell closed borders to the migrant waves we got then
our new infections are a cry from the tourists and migrant waves
what stops new infections if they don't know how to defend themselves?
once you re-open everything from keeping your people locked
2020, globalization
Lank your theory suffers of a focal point
we have a strong increase
https://puu.sh/GERI3/ef18e67c56.png
and then? you go full loop
Nothing stops a new pandemic if you don't install responsibility in your people
this is the middle approach^
use your damn masks, do not agglomerate, mantain distances, curfews and so on
is to put some sense of responsibility in the populace
the thing the government needs to do
to stop the virus
but you don't have to go full blast on it
same as US
UK and France went **too light**
Look lank
it damages the economy
the extreme approach is not good
here everyone accepted it, except naples
even here
well those crazy idiots are always on point
Lol
1 month is endurable
NZ kept lockdown
and focal quesiton, that also depends for how long
after the first wave was dosed
so it recovered a bit
our economy was bad before the virus
Exactly how italy's enterprises were recovering during the 200s period
Tell that to who has an enterprise lank
Short history of second wave.
boom.
Naples decided they're special and ignored that
and guess what, everyone at least wears the mask
here there's propaganda EVERYWHERE on how to fight the virus
+ teach your citizens how to defend themselves
even better
do work
minor restrictive measures
must be used only in severe situations
is that lockdown
THe only thing i'm saying
Lazio is 17 232,29 km² wide
Lazio is not one city
it's easier to put just one city inlockdown
that's my point!
only 2,4m live in rome.
has 6m inhabitants.
Lazio, rome's region
but yeah
you would have to lockdown entire regions
and low
because the population density is widespread
We wont obtain nothing by putting in lockdown major cities
does have?
how many inhabitants the region where melbourne is
the situation is drastically different
That's where
yes i said that because the city size doesn't always matter
https://puu.sh/GES6C/2349c275ba.png
the main trade center of the country
but in Milan
was not in rome
and majority of cases here
3-5 km distant from each other
outside the big cities
we still have many little towns everywhere
we managed to bring down the infected to 200, but then uk and then france started to act dumbily
if police catched you without it, it was considered a crime, penal laws.
as in you needed authorization to leave house
we kept lockdown for 2 months and half
and no one talked of a month lol
yes lank but how many inhabitants do Aus and NZ have?
capital lost will not be recovered.
wont reopen it.
trust me, a person who lost his enterprise
But the lockdown measure needs to be shorter as possible
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Spaghetti are a nation-wide thing
if they want
again
new law states that professors are free to do lessons from online platforms
since well naples again
closed them down
but the whole campania region
here they're trying to keep schools open by using social distance and tampons
lmao
i don't believe that both answers are right
for a while
that in italy the welfare state gives money to workers who lost their job coz of economical crisis
I can say in this matter
^
wait i lost circles ehre
but gray
the world is not white or black
that's why you have to balance things out
thing
please don't get me started on the CCP
LOL
is that it's not that easy
on the rich is wrong
I'm not saying that increasing taxes
^
Jail evaded
*slams money on the table*
you cannot do that!
Hey i have lawyers
that's why we have an economic/commercial police dedicated ONLY to that
but that's an endless battle that went up forever
Well yeah i approve fighting tax evasion
taxes?
you mean people who evade
22% VAT, and that's of course not the main drain of our taxes
is harmful.
Increasing taxes in an over-taxed country
You can tax the rich only up to a certain extent
not non-feasibile ones
We are talking of real measures here
.
that wont happen
100%
i assure you that's gonna destroy our country
to increase taxes EVEN MORE?^
us
you're telling
if we do that
we get bonked by EU bank
in EU
no lank, that's not how it works
but the idea is there
and 1 million is a lot
What circles is saying is what i'm getting at
^
is *not* 0
Worldwide Plague rate
absolutely not.
i don't agree on the 0
basically
it's a whole different world
pls
SPQR to China?
you're comparing
maybe it will shatter in a century, who knows
running *forever*
and so culturally diverse
but you can't keep a country that big
what can i say lol
well lank i'm glad to hear that
rip
To which ones tho?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
circles
You can't offshore air
China fell more than one time in history
Plus at the rate it is going, chinese population will die out pollution
But NK works on the mad head kim jong un
You lose NK china is in for some social earthquake
i don't think NK will last forever
3 times.
with a red pen
i would like to sign the outside influence
it's a very important question
but what is the mean they're using to stay that stable?
this is my personal opinion
i think China will collapse on itself sooner or later
Want me to be 100% honest on what i believe?
but you can't do that forever
we have a pretty extensive welfare system
that's how we work
or have been put in hiatus from it
money given from the gov to the citizens who lost their job
Google translate, tls me "cassa integrazione" as layoff
but that's a temporary measure
and pay them the so called "Cassa integrazione"
gave the opportunity to send workers home
Here the gov
it's the wrong time to act like they're doing
Honestly? i find US electoral campaign *ridiculous*
French and UK went brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
here they worked
compromises
That's what we did here rakhi
as cold hearted i may sound
you can find the middle ground
the conversation was interesting
btw i understand your views guys, what can i say, the future is always there
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
current one is far from "hey eu falls"
but yeah compared to the full blast of that situation
*looks at france*
and circles i know that
japan does this last thing
you have to dose the migrant influxes
all on one go
You can't dump the whole bucket of culturally diverse people
was provoked by migrant waves
THe Fascist thing in EU nowadays
it's the kind of right that actually aknowledges the welfare state
not the fascist right
it's liberal right
for example
Alessandra Mussolini the granddaughter of the infamous one, has her radical right party here, she can't even dream to surpass the 3% to enter the parliament
that's an overstatement
so nothing new
telling you they exist
it's just the right wings that *always* existed
the fascists nowadays?
can i ask where you see
Circles
it happened in history it can happen again
the situation will go back in the previous state
and the western world goes back in high gear again
Once covid goes down
Anyways
believing =/= being
which is a thing i see happening in the late 2021
Well first of all, the COVID threat will have to die down
roman no more
overtime
and Byzantine empire became a whole different thing
it was a whole new country
please HRE doesn't count
in a high fast gear
**zooms**
now that the world basically
but it fell
which in our time period is doomed to happen
that works till external influences come at work
It's that the point
Rome enforced themselves by military might
Classical age was very different from nowadays
Lank the point is the time period
as well
it could be nothing but it could be something to worry about
Oh, caution is really important in these cases
middle ground is the ideal choice, always
a short while ago
this came out https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54694968
E-Cigs tho, those can smell good depending on the liquid used
Cigars are even worse
the smell is not good in both cases
I agree on this take^
indeed
Consent should be the basis of human society
Ye i'm dumbfounded at the statement
Lol what?
Poor gwen, whatever happened i hope she recovers
i mean
What's the usefulness of nicotine?
And even if i don't do drugs i think that lesser lighter drugs should be legalized just to tax them and fight the criminal organizations
I'm against harder harmful drugs tbh
Italy has strict policies about guns, you have to get licenses
if you ban the guns completely with a society that is not educated in that way, well it's a failure
You have to educate th enew generations in short
leads to black market.
Remember that prohibitionism
not the cause
the gun ban in KR and JP is a consequence
I don't think that's the gun control lank
*blam*
*you can hear the founding fathers sounding in distance*
Guns could be used for hunting and for sport
but completely banning firearms, i don't know if i agree with that
sure US gun policy is too much open
Look i don't fully agree about that lank
the bad side is a social problem
the good side is that you can tax them so much that you would solve part of national debts
and regarding casinos... there are 2 sides of the coin
you could get the sex workers to have mandatory health checks
Not only that lank
well i'm talking as an italian where the Welfare state is pretty strong that we end up wasting it
^
if you legalized them, it would mean that the government checks over them and taxes them
controlled by the criminal organizations
if you leave them outlawed you would end up with sex workers on the streets
Why not?
and i agree with melua
Greece has legalized brothels
This discussion is on the same railway as the "Let's legalize casinos and brothels"
hm
2) we actually have to fight mafia
1) History, they exist since 1800s
we have so many branches under MP for one reason tho
with MP
we just merged "La forestale" (forest police for national reserves)
and those branches were 5
MP responds to Ministry of *Defense*
alla act independently
i told you above
those 4 main branches
hell COunter terrorist MP wields AWPs (snipers) and automatic rifles
Carabinieri also have so many sectors under them
<@!170641480791228417> since you asked
every bullet fired means LOADS AND LOADS of bureaucracy
But trust me, no cop from those will shoot without hesitation
those are all armed^
1) Carabinieri, MP
2) Regular Police
3) Vigili, Civilian Police (fines, speed limits, roadblock, public order and that's it)
4) Finanza, Commercial Police (Their only focus is to triplecheck to hell enterprises and check they follow the laws and don't tax evade)
There are more than 1 police force
no
since it's scattered everywhere
MP does civilian policing, more than regular police
not regular police
Carabinieri are Military Police
lol
hell the prefect here can ban you forever from driving for alcohol/drug abuse
"Okay you're unstable, say goodbye to your hunting rifle"
to own a gun
and of course here any judge could decide you're no longer fit
Look i think that burying Gun Licenses under tons of bureaucracy is enough as a deterrent for the average person
here
infact it's pretty rare for a family to own a gun
I'm not saying that the average person has to have a gun
And you know what happens? Criminal organizations have all illegally imported guns
and automatic firearms are banned
Gotcha
it says that trump is winning over biden by a 10%
Uhm searching on the net
i understood that but i didn't connect
ah ok
that sucks
oh also gas
well we don't have carbon or nuclear power plant, most of our energy is imported or from renewable sources
kilometers and kilometers  of wildlife lost due to summer heat
we have that problem too
oh well we don't have anything like that here
?
what is the NCA
but those are a branch of regular police
"Polizia Postale"
the anti Cyber Crime police too
oh true we have
in EU
i'm not to brag here but italy is one of the countries better prepared to certain treats
^
not yet apparently
trump is ahead in pink states
rn
https://puu.sh/GJVsb/1fd0f9bb51.png
Ye i saw that
Trump *seems* at disadvantage
I was checking
his current politics are harmful on worldwide scale
i'm not an US citizen but i really hope at this point that trump wont win
Yeah Wisconsin is turning more blue
i see that wis recovered a bit
Oh how is it going?
lol
we have just a few of them, the most i think are on austria side
but that region is turning them into tourist attractions
those are not actively used
uh
it's a region on the alps
"Trentino alto adige"
but yeah that's in lockdown
lmao
we claimed it
that's our region
Lmao
<@!186660127825330177> https://babylonbee.com/news/fox-news-calls-arizona-for-biden-after-1-vote-counted
wait people
but "Risotto alla Milanese" is theirs
good question
good for you
but we can't leave the region
is correct
increased restrictions but no lockdown
ye
orange ones are next to lockdown
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  it doesn't need translation
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/310094405728206850/773468818550423562/lamappa.png?width=536&height=677
and our PM just forced lockdown on red regions of italy
baseless promises
lmao
if he loses
he will use the constitutional court
just stated
anyways trump
ye it's very narrow
not counting the mail votes
like mathematically
and if the situation holds in that way, trump lost
trump is losing michigan
right now
yeah stay safe
but mine is max 30 lbs of power
I also own a bow
anyways people biden will lose at this rate
heh
Okay that's a step but please take any means necessary
what did the cop say?
Reitia, i recommend you to tell this to your relatives and those who live around you
but isn't nevada often democratic?
Nevada is the problematic one
btw yeah
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
oh that well
i mean they're just finishing the counting
well but i don't see it flipping
most of those will be biden's
and considering trump strongly told his followers to not vote by mail
Mail ins are not counted yet
Later
Nevada is the problem
^
trump would only get up to 49,4%
think if that 4% goes all to trump rn
he can't flip matematically
4% left
Rady
no
https://puu.sh/GK1tc/855b2c47e7.png
it seems trump just lost michigan
So people
not the elections per se
it's disheartening the mail deal
No no mel
and disheartening
is sad
i can say that this whole deal
i'm counting it in the,m
to make him surpass 269
PA is not enough
thus making him win
nevada would take trump to 275
no rady
and trump will stay stuck at 269
the pinks will become red
naraku take a look at the map
tho as people said nevada is *usually* blue
that's why he is claiming "Court court court"
he will lose for a very slight margin
Yes
trump is at 269 if he doesn't gain Nevada
Nevada is still the danger
Not yet
Okay michigan is basically biden's
So is trump winning or losing MI?
That's the public take
Hahaaha wait. Really? Counting got halted?
He will top out
Nah look. Even if trump gets everything but nv
Which is already on his side
Needs just nv
Biden
well i will see when i wake up for sure
i see
am i right?
everything should be done like at your midnight?
but i don't think the medias would risk THAT much
anything can happen
Of course until things are done
it's not a 1%
those vote can really overrule that %?
and even then
that's why i'm surprised
it should be
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
What an horrible system
Isn't it blue?
What about az
To 270
He misses 6
Hm?
Nevada and we go
Come on!
Constitutional court
Trump will still try to go to court
Whatever happens it will have a pretty hectic outcome
Nv has history of being blue
I am not counting a clear victory on nv but
At 269/270
Is this Mussolini's march on rome?
Really?
Oh god
Like nevada counts as 6
Not even %
Every state counts as a number
No hard math there
He stucks at 269
If pa nc and ga call red
You did not get mt point
Ah you put that way
Wtf rady
He is
Because trump is still stuck at 269
Did they state that?
I don't know really
Rotating around nevada
So the situation still stands
huge issue
^
dw
we have professors believing mussolini was fully right
the issue is if he manages to do that
trying is different from succeeding
and i cannot stand to hear dictatorships in 2020
he's no different from a dictator
like voiding mail in
by denying them
if trump manages to screw up the vote
look
he is the lesser evil
really
i hope biden wins
in the country
is like the main TV company
nevis we know because his main enterprise
and he was legit good at politics
he's richer than trump
but silvio didn't fail at business
Silvio
one from current times
no
Trump reminds me of our most famous politician
And the heck the police is waiting for?
God
losing 16 to gain 11
for trump
hell it would become worse
nothing will be solved anyways
btw if AZ flips and GA flips
i'm saying that AP *probably* is not made by dumb people
that it's impossible
I'm not saying
outside
since NV place is locked with armed mob
than before
Nothing much different
i dare to say that AP knows its shit
I don't think AZ will be flipped
if he loses GA and gains AZ back it counts down to nothing
to win
he needs to recover NV
Yes
putting biden at 280
if ga flips trump instaloses
well one more hope then
in GA you mean?
but i see more potential in NV than in GA
i hope he loses of course
it would be like a miracle
we are talking of a stretch here
1%?
why?
lol
99%
Trump can't lose GA <@!203444794737950720>
In parliamentar rep, the PM IS NOT the president
a concept here
I mean we have to divide
not a parliamentar republic
That's still a presidential republic
and becomes the PM
the winning party picks out the guy who will pick the other ministers
people elect the president, in parliamentar system
not a parlamentar one
USA is a presidential system
Mind you
NV is still there
ye but it doesn't fit the federation
(well actually that would not work in a federation)
giff multi- party system for us
*apologies*
my bad then i've been spouting failed math since yesterday
1 less?
Wtf?
Yes
and trump to 269
Biden jumps to 270
NV counts as 6
Biden RN is a 264
Give me a second
Calm down
it is as things stand as they are
otherwise
i can expect people getting hurt
i really hope it doesn't come to that
what a shit system, let me say it
he needs 270 am i wrong?
?
yes
And gets stuck there.
If PA, NC GA and AK go red Trump jumps at 269/270
of course
If we count Pink to become red
to make biden lose
right now
Trump needs ONLY nevada
No
^ that's what i was going to say
we are confusing things here
Lank i know the PM is not the president
UK's Crown is still a bit more powerful than the weakass president who can stop laws, command army and dissolve parliament
in a parliamentar one it cannot be someone else that doesn't have already majority in parliament
in presidential system
than the parliament
is that the PM can be from a different wing
THe major difference in this
Functionally yes, on the paper? no it's a presidential one
also
France is a good example
they vote the parties
in a parliamentar one
The people do not vote directly
THat a presidential system.
is the president elected by who?
Yes but there
then the parliament picks out the president (the weak power guy, who is still the leader of the army btw)
who picks the ministers
pick out the PM
after that the winning party(ies)
that doesn't have to do anything with government
Each chamber has 1 president
I will take italy as an example, we have 2 chambers, people elect the parties with proportional system
yeah close but not quite
that's not how it works in a normal parliamentar rep
that can't be elected by the PM/President
should have a super partes organ
by the way this is why every country
AZ fucking the party over
you don't want
NO calm down
HYPE
ooooh dear GA FLIPPED
Support?
Didn't he lose military
I'm delighted to know that biden is winning
Ah ok
Nv is red in the end?
!!
PA became blue
In ga?
How many votes are missing
Oh my goodness. I'm relieved as well
in distance there
native americans
i can almost hear
in western movies
it's like these mesas you see
the more the merrier
290
became blue
NV
284
Biden won
from AZ
i was trying just to pinpoint how far you were
gotcha
where do you live now mel?
and EU already mass bought it
of the new vaccine
Well apparently US is winning the race
He will have tons of bureaucracy behind that bullet
A cop shoots?
Here for example
I disagree, police force needs guns
Strongly
I would vouch against that
Anti gun propaganda sounds memeish
About guns being bad
I think a good start could be educating the generations
There are flaws in every policy
Nothing is perfect armis
For example you could submerge guns licenses under mountains of bureaucracy and TAXES
Banning? No so much. Coz sociocultural reasons
As i stated before i think that limiting the access to guns is okay
Sry
Well we talked about this and i have to go, but i don't think it's a simple matter with one solution
Eu is not japan, nor aus nor us and viceversa
I think that comparing different cultures is something that breaks a bit here lank
They do not want to shoot
So it is strongly detrimental
well seems like good news
EU can be wicked and corrupt how much you want but at least we *try* to guarantee basic human rights
^
Nothing
wtf?
"Eu will bring gays to the country"
"Children will be sold"
some of the things they're spouting
my friend is telling me
and EU just warned poland that they will get no money if freedom of speech is not restored
Propaganda spouting weird things on TV
the heck is happening in poland?
<@!203444794737950720>
hold on
how much does insulin cost in the US
curiosity
god
it's welfare money that EU citizens need
That veto is kinda stupid
yeah right, i might have understood that but could you explain me this point better?
in the world
and remember that japan is the first country in elderly people number
the traditionalist branch of the country would rise up
if they did things too fast
they have
another example is their immigration policy, they're dosing it so that they will be able to hamper the "low birth rate and aging problem"
it's the culture by itself
"it's a gaijin thing"
the lgbt in japan, the thing it's not considered theirs
and regarding
"yes we need to change, but not so fast"
as long as i know, japanese government tries to change things slowly, don't forget we are talking of a traditionalist country
which is not bad by itself
it means it works
yeah it's a bit particular
the sovereignity is inside the buildings
it's like an embassy
Lmao
it doesn't have sovereignity over the ground
except
sure we see a drop of believers nowadays
the pope is here
but but
paid by the NHS
hell starting this year we also have free hormone therapies
this makes me think that gay marriage is legal in italy, and my country is the most catholic of the world
but the result doesn't really change
thanks for correcting me
(we are talking of %)
the second one is italy
wait who wants to block hormone blockers?
yeah
i mean 4chan is rad enough already
lol
i didn't know such place existed
during covid 1st wave
Our prisons had an huge problem
hah
same issue japan has
too many elders, so few young people
the population is ancient.
Also we have a big problem in italy
tax evasion is another
organized crime is one of those
but it is a result of an everlasting accumulation of issues
most yes
not all of them
Mafia will vacuum if you give money randomly
don't
it is a problem that we drag since CENTURIES
south is poor.
our problem is that italy has unequal economy
(i mean that's not the reason we have big debt, it actually is a small part of it)
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
That's why we have big debt
nowadays some degree of welfare is needed
rip
ah that well
why did you ask anyways
i recall you mentioning it once
mel how much did you say the private ambulance came to cost?
that reminds me
Italian welfare is pretty huge tbh
it's so big that we even waste it
like hell we do rain racer
takeaway is the best option
x_X
but why
LOL
and gay marriage is legal as well
is italy going against the trend with this shit, we have made HRT paid by the NHS
yeah...
x_x
in a western country to hear that
i can't believe how dumb it is
Lol
tbh
italy has already mass bought the  COVID 19 vaccine, i'm a bit scared
^
the birthrates will skyrocket
if economy recovers
as history has shown
the rest 15 were all members of organized cirme
only 5 of them were catched
20 people escaped
outbreak
there has been even an huge
My condolences 🫂
Thanks to those who showed support earlier this morning, i feel a better and less distressed
🫂
to hear that
pharios i'm very sorry
i need to calm down a bit
People, i'm a bit scared but i'm sure it's nothing. Tonight while i was reading weird stuff about adrenaline shots used to cure Anaphylatic shocks (whatever the correct term is, i don't want to research it again), the thinking of the syringe shocked me (i'm that scared of them) and i passed out on the chair for something that's not more than a few seconds (i looked back at the clock and the pc screen didn't go out in power save yet). I don't know if i hit my head and i don't feel bad but i fell from my chair and when i came back to my senses i was on the floor, just waited there till my perception was totally restored and went to bed. Is there just anyone who wants to talk to me about this?
i guess it was
others will slowly follow
starts doing htat
but if one economic block
tbh
in this decade
i can see that happening
THe solution is to educate the newgenerations
on the news
poland coal power plants are being brought up more and more and more
EU and US going down in pollution is not enough to solve the problem (EU is already slowly but surely trying)
but don't forget what country is most pollution angry one
btw you looking at US pollution
you just told me the cause of it
i don't agree with dino, and isky, that still doesn't solve, we are still too manyu
but yeah that brings me to my reasoning, we need to terraform another planet, mainly because we are too many for this ball of dirt
i can already see the sanctions to the countries that do not abide to it
in 10 years
for starters EU has overruled to *halve* the carbon emissions
it's not like humanity is not trying something
they will isky
technology will get so much advanced that will allow us to bypass the climate change problem
*mars colonization raises hands*
wtb self aware ai
~~ badger was just rakhi secret wish ~~
good one
rofl
look i can't say i fully understand your pain since i don't experience it, but i feel it, i wish you to get better
eu will not give a crap
but once you're not an EU member anymore
because EU forbids secessions
is that Scotland couldn't ever go independent under EU rule
about this
hilarious fact
😦
you could go there
in the case scotties get independence
eh no wonder scotland wants independence
it's an important decision comparable to a declaration of war
if they repeated it, i'm sure it would have gone in the other way
that vote had to be overruled and repeated
imagine leaving EU with a 2% margin <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
50,6%?
what was the referendum result again emily?
"we ain't playing" someone said
EU gave up on boris shenanigans
No deal to boot
really
stay safe rakhi
coz of incompetent gov
but the numbers are doomed to double up
then, i'm sorry to say this
goddamn it
which hits fast
expecially if you have the mutated covid
Look rakhi, i'm the kind of person who will tell you that economic crisis coming from this is to not be ignored, but of freaking course the pandemic should get full priority
damn pm decide yourself, is it red zone or orange__
i mean wtf
and we are failing again too, since our PM decided this crap.
someone fucked up badly
UK has the same numbers Italy had during the full second wave
this is a disaster
is that to increase taxes you have to use these taxpayer money
Rady, what i was trying to say
tbh
Taxes are useless if no welfare is provided
any kind of it
Extremism in *general* is bad
like mayors
it works on a lesser degree on local elections
on public elections
is a thing that failed 1 decade and half ago here
with one time food
bribing voting base
are we talking about?
What country
else, where's the point? stack up?
in a good way
okay better than no deal but it's still awful
it's so dumb
i can already see the poor guy that gets 27k€/y that gets kicked out
wtf is this crap? to get a permit in UK you need to have a job that guarantees you 28k€/y
has made an exit deal
UK
That kind of humor is just bad
all depends on how the infrastructures are made
it's not a flip switch
will stay as an extrovert
an extrovert
My dad is in mp, i can guarantee you, his superiors are asking numbers, as in they're competing for who makes more money with covid fines
$$$ for the gov
people were everywhere
when the quarantine was lifted
but
to fine you
coz MP is everywhere
that doesn't happen that much here mei
people went full blast here and here
Look, i can make you the example of this summer
that's a lie
Yeah
Lol
Libido is directly affected by hormones
lol
what the heck
?
I've been to a mac like... 4 times in my life? And one in a kfc
I already do
Rip
https://summit.news/2020/12/30/uk-woman-arrested-for-filming-inside-empty-hospital/ <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
well mei i don't know, i'm commenting what i've read, i admit not having delved further
so i hardcore hate masks
i wear glasses like 16/7
that was my reaction when a friend of mine linked me that
eh
tbh in this case i hope so
not necessary, creates confusion and hassle situations
Look people, personally i call this *overdoing*
https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1345129974601293824
My god, what are you doing in the British isles
look armis i don't know what to say
in these days
rady tell him how nice is being your government
you have rady here
we still have some weird shenanigans don't worry bro
and honestly, even then, i don't agree
i got that far
it's on documents
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
and you blame him for something that didn't even happen
the guy doesn't even begin to have enough power to get into majority of our country
what's even more hilarious is that the thing made one of our deputees in parliament all the fault
y
Also #italygate made me laugh
It's unbelievable that such thing was left to happen
Yeah
The difference? Mussolini got authorized by the king back in the day
What happened is on a similar line as Mussolini's march on rome
Is the riot at capitol still going on?
Please stay safe
It's insane
62k
I just saw uk numbers
My god
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
this is something at the wrong time
some deputees want to make the gov fail
Pollution is important <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Poland pls, update your tech level
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
As if some of those are directed to children
but it's definitely tryharding in this first phase
well biden might not be good
fiction is not real life
uh i don't agree to zeroing differences in a fantasy setting
i can't
wait what are we talking about
kaiyari doesn't lead the reader or the spectator to sympathize
No no no calm down
this channel exists for that too
nah it's okay to confront each other minds
they can entirely be evil
and so on
how do they approach the other races?
how are they different from Angels?
is the way to use Aasimars in a setting
btw a good example
and i dm since 2017
so far i've created 2 worlds
well
^
dnd doesn't consider them a race but monsters
If i would ever use goblins in an intelligent way, i would put them into a special situation to be considered on pair with other common races
Otherwise i would let them exist just as monsters as best
after 1-2 sessions
well that gets stale
LOL
And it's entirely cool to have them achieve something more noble and higher
Monster Races
shemmy mayo confirmed

Hm, there is a reason if we can consider Orcs and Goblins
Removing stuff and introducing fantastical traits is not something that i would look forward to
Okay okay now i get the topic
bad habit sry
damn me for trying to get into discussions midway
i don't know the point of the discussion, that's why my answer was weird, sry
oh of course
Thinking too much into it would mean censoring human minds
it's not, it's really all
this is a **very important** thing no one must forget
look, a work of fiction IS a work of fiction
the topic?
wait was really goblin slayer
hmmm i see
mil
it's not worse as in bad
*circle of laminaria*
and trust me the LN illustrator is worse than the author himself in kaiyari (Redohealer short name)
btw in these cases you can also look up the artist hashtags
because there's not enough buildup to do so
at least the anime doesn't
means supporting china
or any service you use from them
everything you buy from them
Look
about "Playing Genshin supports CCP?"
Are we talking
it's a matter of choosing what flaws
Look lank, nothing is perfect, everything has to have its own flaws
:/
matter of viewing things
tbh
What trump did, wasn't wrong by itself by putting taxes on chinese products
For example import taxes
but yeah my take on the CCP problem is that only other economic blocks (EU/US) can do something
but let's leave that aside
grabbing more players
Staying F2p is still
You can to some degree, but i agree with you
Genshin is the drop in the ocean
in general
chinese products
it's a matter of using and consuming
i don't play genshin, but it's meh
i don't agree with this last statement
why shouldn't i play something i appreciate?
that's an hottake shem
that's a good example of flexing of "What can be done"
the other day
Like what happened with Gamestop
And UK leaving EU is the wrong step in this matter
is Other economic blocks acting together
what can make a difference tho
that can make a difference
it's not that way of doin gthings
^ i agree with shem here
^
**has** to do something
well i am the first saying that the rest of the world
okay now i get the point
Ah ah
As much i dislike ccp, it's a bit weird point to uptake
Politics and economics are beaten with politics and economics.
properly
Ways that are is electing your governors
passive advertising
when it really doesn't
Zenbu, this is similar to the "Damage" That piracy is supposed to do
artisanal option
it's a drop in the ocean
^
*panics*
but don't forget /pol/ exists
are a thing
on internet
well politics
thankfully EU strictly forbids it
It's not a deterrent, not by a longshot
and solves nothing
The death penality is something really barbaric
Hm am i outdated?
and the case dissolves
but then *ta-da!* prescription appears
out of the ordinary
i know it's not
coz $$ and fame
they have to send the person in jail no matter what.
means he doesn't care if the person is really guilty or not
but yeah the prosecutor being a private
(4 in total but the 4th is a special one reserved for really bad crimes, like homicide)
with 3 different degrees of courts
then there is us italians
so yeah i leave the benefit of doubt
i'm not sure either
but the basis is the same
there are some differences
iirc
Japan system is an offspring of american one afterall, since it was imposed post ww2
not for a prosecutor.
it's okay for a defendant attorney
this is fundamentally hardcore *wrong*
**the prosecutor is a private which fame increases as he/she wins causes**
aspect in the judicial system
really uncomfortable
US has a little
so it's a matter of accepting what ones
but left and right both got downsides
of course it has its downside
We need both a mixture of right and left to make it work
not anymore at least
i don't believe that nowadays a political color is the right way to fix things
i don't see that message working at all nowadays
it's not the last century
because of the money fund veto deal
since France and Germany are still salty
and i think they will
but yeah i really hope that EU focuses on poland
the concept doesn't change
name your number really
then 50?
in human society
we are assisting at a rollback of 30 years
it's like
like what's happening in poland
so eu can focus on other issues
i hope for you that this pandemic ends asap
on a human basis
loris this is wrong
in 2021 it's just...
i-i can't believe this
#poland
is this true?
``what the fuck
so the scum that banned a bortion, just "found" a solution to the problem they created
"we will provide you a room to cry in"
``
i'm quoting my other polish friend
WTF
<@!203444794737950720>
in the US
it's because the left is just not a thing
and it needs 3% to enter the parliament.
but it got like 0,5%
we also have a radical left party
It's because the Communist Left ideal is something that the people dislike
which by itself has flaws (as anything really) but it's more decent than a two party one
like we do
even the contest of 3rd party is flawed, you just need a multi-party system
but it's impossible because of how it's structured
if it got more parties than 2
US would work much in a different way
in the majority
right now in italy we got a big centre-left party
so it can't be really changed
of how it is structured
but it's caused by the fact
that just doesn't work
of having a political system
US has a very unique problem
i don't know how to put it
I think that US people have a very drastic view of what you can do
2011 crisis
btw europe is slowly trying to switch to alternate energy
it will be a flash
off switching to alternate energy
if capitalists can make money
we get downtimes
not even once, it's just a cycle
we didn't collapse
but we can't adopt a system that doesn't fit us
of course we need to improve
it hasn't collapsed
hottake: humanity still exists after over 3k years of society building
we can't adopt something we can't use
Human mind does not work that way
getting closer as the speed of sound
far in distance
of stagnation
i see the echoes
ofc
free to think whatever you want
this is idealism
at his height
than trump could ever have been
the guy is far more richer
a very fierce campaign
but for example italy's ex-PM has been prosecuted for lobbying
exists
but regulation on international level
because france keeps going toe to toe with uncle sam
France has no internal regulation
for example
That's because
one slip out of the rules andyou're blasted
lemme fix what i said, technically EU tightens lobbying to a certain set of rules that leads it to something much more controlled
EU doesn't allow Lobbying
still a crime
It's
it's like sucking in the mafia in the discussion
Bribing is a crime
a counterbalance is needed
That's why Capitalism needs RULES
No, i don't agree here, if you manage your company bad, i would bet that you just go in the red
that would be something good
iirc it was ruled out the lock out
^
we already had that happening
so yeah lol
than 1929
was on a bigger scale
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
because blocking our sights is wrong
it doesn't mean we can't speak our minds out
Dr ver lol
.
again miku
will spawn on earth
A new one
good luck into pushing CCP into improving his CO2 emissions
if you want to improve our planet
Look for instance
we can mitigate the problems
We can't completely fix our planet
it's not.
all more feasible than mars plans
*several plans
to fix venus.
Infact we already have a plan
zenbu?
did you land on venus
and i don't agree on humanity not being able to leave solar system
^
around the solar system
plus we are still forgetting that we are trying to get on other ball of rocks
i don't agree with this doom scenario
it can just work as an utopia
**doesn't fit human nature**
Hibimiku, to be short, what are you proposing
only to spawn a new one.
You kill one ruling class
costantly
Humanity counterbalances itself
this is doomerism
i agree with kat
we are already on our way of getting rid of fossil fuel
tbh
neither is fossil fuel
where is Europa when you need it
for real lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
for the britain inhabitants
well more fish'n'chips
rip
that made me chuckle
Lol
of having left EU
i don't think that UK will at any point really benefit
either way
he seems so randomic
who doesn't actually understand crap of what he does
the more i think he's an idiot
btw the more i see boris johnson
tho i don't live there so i can't say anything about that
separatism is a thing
eh i dunno
SNP =?
that come with it
and get the benefits
to re-enter EU
it would give scotland enough time
oh that's for sure but
it's not there
but it doesn't mean
it happens
since scotland has the oil
and scotland is on the right part  of the knife
and start independence referendum
scotland will break off because of this
i think that sooner or later
because it really means that half of your pop doesn't want
imho
it's still in the realm of bs
by a mere 50-51%
still i think it's absurd to uptake such an huge decision
did not predict that
but actually the freaking brexit supporters
ah okay sorry lank <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i said that it was a very harsh mistake
since the referendum was announced and i came to know that such thing was going to happen
i did
eh?
but i think that UK brought it all on itself
Look i might sound harsh
because of brexit
UK having serious resupply problems
are talking about
The news here
For any comfort it may be i send hugs stellar
Lol
it's not my intention
sorry if i seem arrogant about it
as a whole
could be that i believe in EU
yeah i might seem
now that you point it out
guess what, bankrupt = less taxes
of course these are my predictions
he's in a Lose/Lose situation
so the midget himself will find trouble in his hands
since funds will start lacking
Yes rady but at a certain point shit will go down drastically
if poland quits EU, well it's doomed to collapse on itself
It's not too late till Poland stays in EU
but only after pandemic ends
i see shit happening in the near future
so yeah
for Fund Veto
with poland
since EU is actively pissed
is different
I think this time around
by Brexit&pandemic
UE wont do shit till its distracted
I think
before the end of the mandate
we changed PM here because the previous one step down
hold on rady
don't take me wrong but i can't wait for EU to start bashing down poland for freedom of speech infringement
``oh lord it gets worse
blockhead on pistv, "the fact that cetrain media today are shut down, is good for polish people and poland, because now they have access to reliable information"``
the situation seems dire there
through my other polish friend
i'm following your politics
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/applying-eu-law/infringement-procedure_en i will link this for now
but i can't explain rn
that's incorrect
from UK
iirc i bought a few times directly
oh well
coz globalization
you import stuff and you don't even notice
lols
eh
you like your import taxes loris
fun how UK was never fully part of Shengen
Oh dear please find the courage, it's for your own wellness
something may happen later on in my opinion
rn
but yeah EU is too busy with brexit problem and pandemic
idk about that
i'm not sure if it was the Recovery Fund
that delayed the funds
Poland and Hungary Imposed a veto to stop these funds
COVID19
Emergency
for Vetoing funds
plus as far as we know EU countries are currently angry at poland/hungary
i didn't look into that
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/applying-eu-law/infringement-procedure_en
i think they will once pandemic goes away
but didn't process them for infringement yet
EU did state it
"We got debt because international corps do not pay taxes" 
- Polish gov while spending 2b on Gov Media
so they can't really figure out what's going on
like the one i posted above
problem is that the citizens are getting distracted by false claims
me too
again the current situation is just dire
Poland banned abortion too
since you know it's eu
oh internet is the only safe buoy basically
it's taking away freedom of speech
this is just bad
so only gov channels can survive
by over-taxing free private media
when it's them doing so instead
and they're saying that it's international media corporations fault
Something bad is going on in poland
you got in reverse
Stellar tvpis is a tv channel
``tvpis headline today "international media corporations trying to take away freedom of speech of polish citizens"
and fuckers started a hotline as well, for people to call in
and praise tvpis
`` 
If this is true, it's ridiculous
<@!203444794737950720> i can't stop to facepalm on this
rady
Look i don't remember picking a saint, that means i just picked the one with my name
good one
and noi you did make me chuckle
i am confused
LOL LANK
no i did do the confirmation
wt
he just said he did
what do you mean rady
while i am agnostic now i've grown as a catholic (did all the rites up to confirmation)
tho what lank said is entirely true
the ritualistic differences
don-t underestimate
True
(and catholic priests get paid)
Is ritualistic mainly
But the main difference between orthodox and catholic
Yeah you miss the russians and greek people
Catholic is christian
Orthodox is christian
Common mistake of naming convention
History can be weird
Lol
Otherwise orthodox you go
You know rady there is an historical reason that makes poland Catholic, something something Christianisation of the baltic
And greece
Iirc hungary is ortodox
Main ones are catholic, ortodox and protestant
Is split into several branches
Christian religion
yeah people we were having a serious discussion here
is fine imho
yeah but preaching adult to adult
old testament angels where
one should be free to believe in whatever they want
100% agree
^
**where are my magical circles now**
yeah
but i don't think it's wrong to tell your beliefs to the others
oh well that definitely happens
and confront them is not
know about your beliefs
pushing others to join is wrong, but letting people
``«a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted because the evidence did not establish guilt to the requisite standard of proof»``
the proofs were not enough for the court
after 1 year of jail
on 7 april
pell was released by the same court
hold on lank
he actively pursues that problem
THis has backpedaled with current pope
exactly
human history doesn't have to be denied
indeed
Oh it's important
this talk reminds me when i've read stuff about neopagan religion Wicca, and i liked how you have to be the one to show interest (and you have to be an adult) in order to be initiated
no they're taxed here
look at vatican
but our constitution even by stating that italy is fully religion-less (can't remember eng term), we do place catholic church one step above the rest
nowadays is not like that here
now western religion has softened but once it was not a choice
of our past history
i think it's because
i do believe that's a bit wrong, since a kid can't fully understand what's he's doing
since it's taken as normal to follow the church if your parents/family is catholic
so yeah kinda forced on me
like i "had to do this"
honestly i remember getting a bit fed with the whole deal while i got confirmation
rofl
each city/town fiercefully celebrates its patron saint and most of italians celebrate the picked saint on the right day like a second birtday
italy is a bit odd with saints
since we celebrate saints like birthdays here
*supreme light*
i just looked into surya
Humans be like
The concept is the damn same
> big brain
"Wait if the imperial family descends from amaterasu, the pharaoh was the son of Ra"
and me making analogies
i also remember how cool shintoism was when the teacher explained it
but yeah religion is really an interesting thing, since it's tied to history
lmao
sub.
that's what i said
and buddha not being a god
when i learnt about buddhism
being surprised
btw i remember
and it's the most easier
for example "how christianity spread" is a big big historical discussion
in this matter
don't underestimate that Religion = history
it's roots are
^ this is also true
so really no.
it was like 1 hour/week in our school
you take
how many hours/weeki
eh depends
yes
yeah
and so on
i remember the teacher explaining how buddhism worked, how induism worked
it was more religious study
it illustrated the teens to what each religion is
was great in high school
infact our religious education at school
oh yeah yeah
ah
RE?
i agree on this take
it was, the church was a problem to them coz it diverted attention
it just doesn't work
you had to believe in the fuhrer
was like that
eeeh nazi germany
ignore the sarcastic tone, but if that's true, rip
there-s only so much you can overtax without causing a famine
poland gov calm down seriously
wtf lol

is that weirdo that mixed his own fantasy
the first self proclaimed historian
it's an huge piece of history
it's sad you know
were murdered by Greek interpretation
this reminds how badly ancient egyptian religion and myths
yeah ikr
poor poland
we check after they go away
.
"No sir there's not any problem", "it says 230v"
they come to our home as we call them
alarm battery gets fried
first one 275v, we check with another, 275v again
(voltimeter)
so yeah we check with a tester
during summer to us
we get company outputting **275v**
2019
listen here
oh mil mil
rip millhi
but 230 is more stable and less subject to undervolting
but yeah we used to have 220v here
so weird
is that on 230v?
plug
didn't uk have that weird
wait
240??
you have 100v right?
loris iirc
230v sends you flying
you get stuck there getting fried on 100v
same amp at 230v vs 100v
but i'm talking of
ofc
distancing you from the source
because it *explodes*
iirc 230v is less dangerous than 100v
zappy zapp 230v right in the face
that qualifies you to put hands on the stuff
it's a certification
you need that here too
oh yeah
eh
i can confirm
my cousin's husband is an electrician
They say
You reap what you sow
Before making such decisions consider all the options available
mil
it does radiolysis
oh that
by itself
Tritiated water is radioactive
aka super heavy water
as fuel for nuclear plants
Tritiated water instead of Uranium
btw i was discussing with a friend of mine
how would be working at windmills as electrician
now that's something
tfw you get assigned to windmills
engineers be like:
i'm asking since we don't have nuclear plants here
you would need for that
i can't imagine how many certifications
?
do electricians work in nuclear plants as well
gonna replace it
the battery died, the UPS itself is fine
oh loris the UPS that died on me the other day
if you don't know exactly what you are doing
that's why it's extremely unwise to open a pc PSU
and they can still explode
they will still retain charge
even then loris, if you unplug your current from the wall
be wary of capacitors people, those are nasty
a capacitor fucking exploded in his face
a friend of mine during lab class @electrician
it remembers me
that's not required here
then you get the certifications
here you go to a technical school
For electrician?
my take on that is that they volted down as we called them
and didn't go up since then
and it was saying 235v
i don't know
otherwise it becomes eeeh.
well yeah deportation is something that needs to be ruled
and you're done
drop a generator in the volcano
Geothermal is the solution
pls people
to get into an armed/police/firefighter force you have to either do Military academy, either do at least one year of volunteer, or at last participate to an admission (exams bar this) course to join one of the forces
only a volunteer based enrollment
oh well we got no reserve here
here

by Anti Terrorist department
that would be handled

infact, normal policemen can't go into foreign missions, whereas MP cops can
and both to the Defense one
and our military police responds both to the Ministry of internal affairs
(600 inhabitants town got one js)
even small towns have one MP station
*everywhere*
we have military police on our territory
maybe it's because
<@!430379754190012426> ?
but what should be the job of national guard?
and abolished it
"Nahhh we don't need it"
but a general of ours went just
There were some tries into making it better
only 25000 was present
36000 manpower got called out
Third Independence war of italy
no it failed its job
not needed
and abolished in 1876
it was founded in 1861
we don't have any national guard in italy
polizia di frontiera

there is a department in normal police
we don't have a border force but
Ok i double checked
Coast Guard is needed
and navy
Coastguard
Navy patrols our seas
Man loris, Army sits at the land border
sure immigration office is a thing
well we don't have such police force here
the ICE i mean
is it basically a police force that manages deportation?
can't say anything as an european
this reminds me of  /pol/
I hope it's just a rumor
Better leave poland at that point
That's outrageous

come on this is overdoing
in the sea
and i assure you that i can easily see Mafia dropping Waste barrels
it's a very dangerous thing
into the circuit
means getting the major criminal organizations
btw going nuclear
no.
eh now yes, if main global powers all go on nuclear
it's not abundant enough
as fuel already
Tho we need to drop the Uranium
Cerno on the other side, *experiments done wrong*
i couldn't be helped
Fukushima, well fukushima was an EQ, and nothing went boom there
not a randomic thing
was a bad experiment
and the disaster in that plant
people i agree with the mistrust being overblown, i just stated the main incident that gets mentioned
pesky russians toying with low cost security bars in Cernobyl
the distrust comes from
*twice*
we voted against nuclear
all the talk becomes 0 when you think that CCP exists
go stun out the CCP
But there is a problem
some change after the covid
I think there will be
vs diesel/oil cars
being pushed more and more
i see electric and methane cars
anyways for starters
than ever
that's why we need larger economic blocks to be more solid
or the other pandemic in africa
humans are resilient and the virus is a joke compared to spanish flu
it can-t tho loris
is 2 years
of a pandemic
average lifespan
```The accident started during a safety test on an RBMK-type nuclear reactor, which was commonly used throughout the Soviet Union. The test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining reactor cooling water circulation until the back-up electrical generators could provide power.```
btw
went crack
the security bars
yeah
the reactor was starting to melt
eh dunno isky
but they went into the secure route and prevented a disaster
than cerno
dangerous
was much more
Fukushima
after 20+ years.
everyone went "Omg but cerno"
here they were scared
no
that one is pretty good
that we got geothermal power
btw people always forget
last vote was in 2011
again here people voted against nuclear **Twice**
you misunderstood
oh absolutely mel lol
again experiment gone wrong
pollution go brr
goddamn it
too much polluting
to generate electricity
COal is the WORST possible option
the things get spicey
eeeh but when we talk of waste
Here gov pays you to install solar panels on your house
one way or the other
humanity always finds a solution
ofc
isky it-s not the whole article
ebola.
which i forget the name
Solar and wind are great

Today
Your gov is wrecking havoc of your country from the inside
6%
<@203444794737950720> did poles gov announce pc/tv/phone new tax? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Not counting that we *also* have regular police
i don't know where are you getting at
and both part of regular army.
both policing
The point is that our MP does both the jobs
I know that
we have MP in every town instead
we don't have a national guard system
it's not a comparison
no
with like more than 6 time our population
US National Guard counts up to 440k members (wikipedia) vs 110k italy's Carabinieri [MP] (wikipedia)
this remembers me the discussion that was here the other time
we abolished draft
since the 90s
that doesn't exists here anymore
ye
ah that
is the military draft book again_
what
Definitely
no offence to any french speaker here but goddamn, it hated french when high school and middle school tried to teach it to me
*ordinateur*
Look languages will stay similar even in the case the economic blocks become more solid
except greek, it got no middle ground, there is either ancient greek or new greek
ah that yeah
Language is part of history
eehhh, is it really?
Language is the mirror of the culture
^
also that
yeah
"cacophony"
that's why "Latinx" may cause cringing
(usually)
as humans
we do not adopt uncomfortable tools
Language is a tool
italian has "Latino" and "Latina"
are all gendered
neolatin languages
damn
lit shame
Lol it's Vergogna in italian
my stupidest example of that situation is japanese people using "biru" for building, when they just have "Tatemono" in kanji for it
since it's already happening
it's what will happen, even if in a lower key, but it will
Well mel how much hilarious that video is
or *ankeeto*
*looks at arubaito*
since they have katakana
into creating new words
Well Japanese just gave up
you wouldn't want to get your culture overwritten just because yes
it's legit up to some extent
But not banned
Crypto should be entirely regulated
eh some people can do that
ok i didn't understand that
ah
and answered you on the pump of adrenaline
it seems that your dad panicked
hmm
they think they're god
are just mean
sometimes uni professors
wow
ah ok
man do not stretch things till the last second
and surely wrong
that was a bit extreme
i kinda understand such behaviour even if i don't justify nor excuse it
not even with ill intent, just because they're inclined to do so
Even the offers are rather scarce
Eh i understand the pain of job hunting with covid
hm
gender equality is a word
since italy is a lot different culturally than germany
it would not explain how mussolini rose to power
The heck is that assumption
but what do you mean by negative tax?
out of several
you removed one factor
that doesn't negate the outcome
even then lank
they do
But yeah, you're still forgetting what can happen to the market as whole:
Corp x Fails producing unemployment  = Less Tax paid to the country, less GDP, unemployed will spend less causing a massive fail of other corps since they lack money to buy their products, corp Y fires 100k coz of this -> rinse and repeat
but watch out of inflation when you mention it
i'm not entirely against such thing
inflation
ah that thing that causes
what is UBI?
not even in the perfect world
Jobs guarantees can't cover 100%
it's a loss
it's not a victory
what happens when a corporation fails
look you must not forget
right?
let's be clear corporation = huge businesses
and nothing else
i  think that the answer lays in moderation
that's give the usurers free way to destroy the world
watch out
you're oversimplifying the issue
oh well that
i think it's okay to lend money to the businesses on certain situations
by corporate welfare
what do you mean
while it's an okay thing that gives the poor to go down that route, it got abused
current generation of enterpreteneurs when has to open a new enterprise goes down > "Okay time to fetch some public money to kickstar the business since i do not have to give it back"
it's too much and gets wasted
lays in the italian welfare
huge part of the fault
big brain
the company was constantly failing coz of bad management
plus bad decision making
it was like "okay gov gives 100k (random number) to alitalia"> "Yo guys, let's split up half of that and then feign to improve it with the other half"
the issue lank is that corruption was at stellar level
our pretty waste of money
Public > Private > Fail > Saved by gov > Fail > Saved by gov > Repeat > 2020 > Public
Alitalia deal is one hell of a ride
starting from 2020
italy is one of them
it got nationalized
ah no that changed last year
iirc gov holds an huge chonk of it
which got privatized BUT
our main Line airplane company
oh ofc we have Alitalia deal
that's a legit privatization
for the ISP
but it would not be like that
exactly
other ISPs have to loan off the cables
since this chonky ISP (Telecom Italia) now has the monopoly of all the lines
and that was an oddball
tho we did privatize our main ISP
it's a fake privatization
go figure
eh
we have to complicate things for no reason
l00op
Trenitalia who manages the railways is 100% owned by Ferrovie dello stato italiane which is 100% owned by the ministry of economy
basically
tfw italy privatized railway company but at the same time it's still the main shareholder
not universal
that's money for unemployed people
that's not UBI
btw reading that article
you can't print money randomly
i still miss where that UBI would come off
not in practical use
it works only in theory
breaks that rule
human greedyness
till it halts
still okay? X+20
X price is okay? well then tomorrow is X+10
profit over profit
i will want to sell more
and notice that i sell well
if i want to make money
no that's not how it work
even then
except i will
so that UBI loses power
since i can syphon that UBI
will higher my prices
Otherwise me as enterpreteneur
You can't do that
.
INFLATION
went downhill
it completely failed
in the meanwhile
the country helps you finding a job
then
Italy created something similar to UBI, called it "Reddito di cittadinanza", basically you get x money if you have 0 income
Look
eh
if the businesses close down
how does the gov pay the UBI in your scenario?
Lank
Superinflated Weimar's Germany
wasn't UBI
loses power overtime and that example in the canadian article
that 1000 UBI
Btw people
declaring much less
We got big rich people hiding their money in other countries
not really
exporting capitals
because that's what will happen
ah are you inviting them to leave the country right?
be taxed?
and let themselves
why the rich should stay there
46 is middle aged
it's a mental system
average human swears a lot
it's ridiculous
then hungary will be powerless
this should reach the EU court
well i think that sooner or later
seriously EU should enforce their sanctions harsher
in 2021
how can such thing be allowed
uh i don't know about that
like no tomorrow
it's ruining poland
behind him
the whole political party
he's just a puppet
current polish gov is a stain on EU
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56491949
of speech?
<@!203444794737950720> where is the freedom
Gl for the future!
Oh thank god it is going in the good way
it wont work coz of culture
Lank japan is not a worldwide applicable example
people went to canada.
look at china banning criptomining
people will just move out
because if the main economic blocks do not tax it altogether
i assure you
not everywhere
history has proven it.
Prohibitionism is not  always good thing
You want to mine crypto? Fine. Start paying taxes onto it
i.e NHS
to use for other means
1) deterrent
2) Government can siphon money out of those
instead you provoke 2 benefits
if you tax it
this last thing is more than enough, it will encourage underworld onto this route
just think of what will happen once you ban it
taxing it is right.
that banning crypto is wrong
i still think
Hm
I don't do drugs, so it's a reasoning that come through logic and what i know about them
That's really dangerous
But i am talking about stuff on coke level
Are overblown
Oh sure some classifications
In that case imho it would backfire
I mean, the reasoning can be applied at  anything that's not on dangerous drug level
Same for casinos, but in that case there is a social issue to fight off
Greece iirc
Some countries already do that
Eh
It would get sex workers insurance and assistance
Why ban them, just tax them and get the gov agencies to check on them/make them abide strict laws
I make a similar reasoning with brothels
Banning is the worst
Absolutely
Oh yeah
If the tax is just a big part would find hiding an useless danger and hassle
Harsher the hiding
Harsher the tax
A "just" tax is the right tax
Severe tax is also unwise, it would still encourage hiding
If you ban crypto, organized crime/black market/dark web says hello
Brain up.
Prohibitionism is bad, you gotta get smart and tax those
Eeeh i hope they don't follow
$ = usa
€ = majority of europe
economic blocks
that's why i said
we don't
yes we do
we do not trust enough our gov to blindly give it our money
if italy does it, it will collapse on itself for example
Japan is an e x c e p t i o n
and fail
that **will** cause different effects
and that's without counting all the other factors in the equation
in unison
so yeah tl;dr i think that this idea to work requires AT LEAST the main economic blocks to adopt the same policy
look at karoshi
their culture auto-overworks their citizens
plus remember that japan works on taxing on citizens mental health, nothing is perfect
no it is too.
they trust their gov that their money wont be wasted
trust me lots of japan examples are tied to their culture
Lank
do not bring exceptions into rules
and it's a cultural thing too
it's a special example
with its own citizens
because japan has a debt
where lira was worthless
or italy pre-euro
current example? Poland
there's no proof that it can't happen again
is behind the door
weimar
Again lank
which is not possible
overinflates
btw mass money printing works only if everyone in the world
will save it for later
sry
and i can't really watch a 18 min long video rn
situation
look at poland current
it inflates.
if over-prints it
it wont be printed
if the bank decides to not print it
want an example? Euro depends on european central bank
it doesn't
out of nothing
money doesn't grow
they wont lank
ofc it does
come on what kind of example is that solo
And with the taxing govs can build more green source
oh my god that's disgusting
Ofc with strangers normally it's just an handshake
Hugging/peek on the cheeks
Haha i've just read the Hispanic cultural thing, it's also common for italians
Stating that is like comparing the speaker itself to an animal
since when socialism is european
LOL
it's rooted in the culture
come on, america history is filled with pointing "commie!" at the random guy that expresses a centre-leftist opinion
*credibility drains*
usually when a party changes way of doing things in a way that goes against what they spawned for, it dies slowly by itself
since there are like 15 parties into parliament rn
by sheer numbers
in a country with multi party system like ours you notice change of colors
so colors get ultramixed
by the two party system
american politics are too much affected
look
politics be like
yes
Australian liberals
hard right policies usually go against what a liberal would propose
how
hard right and liberals what
yeah liberals tend to be into centre-right
sure retirement age has gone up
since old people retire
it's not like no one gets employed nowadays
but each its own
Lank i think that you're being just a bit too much idealistic here
experience is also what leads them to think like their parents/who came before
this is a thing that actually happens
a random person has left ideologies during his school and uni career > blam he finds a job or opens a business, he stops thinking in his young days manner
i will tell you that it's a common thing that happens
why the heck shouldn't i follow his footsteps if he allows me to do so
So for example if i was the son of a politician
remember that humans advance by accumulating knowledge and inventions from past generations
is the right way?
that how i do politics
what if i teach the next generation
lank
ofc
a mere opinion
but that's my doubletake on this
since nothing is perfect
can be counterproductive
i think being too much rigid in mindsets
since the history is written by victors
so we might learn something that didn't exist
but we interpret stuff
nah we do learn
shem we live in a globalized world, if a revolution gets by, external inteferences will drastically warp it
hong kong showed the world how civil wars and revolutions do not work anymore
hell we still have it here too lol
i said it's something of the last century
it's dead
i didn't say
is something really meh
rn with globalization
Nationalism is something of the last century
but that-s because **welfare state** is something that mustn't be denied
i mean sure europe has more socialist policies
rip
mind you
were people who assisted the revolutions of the 60s
people who voted in 1984
Ah well shem that's where welfare doesn't exist
but it still exists
that you get to know someone only coz you're interested
pharios you're impling
unfortunately (or fortunately) the world is not black or white, there are so many different factors, expecially in these cases
the reverse just happened
but let's take for instance that you become friends with someone, and then start noticing that you're attracted to the person as whole
yeah
True but that's not a rule that cannot be broken
you're a normal person
you're not living one quarter of mile at the time
one step at the time
Better than nothing
"Ah then there is scum worse than me"
take a peek at the low part of the barrel
Pharios when such toughts arise
zenbu is wise
imho
that's a self worth issue
i admit i never actively searched for a partner
if it happens, it happens
look i don't know about rady's statement
my take has always been
i know
that's unfortunate
^
the couple should continue at its own pace
ofc slowing too much is also bad
rushing is bad
oh yes
again humans
ofc there are exceptions
eh
ofc you wont get into someone you're physically repulsed of
human mind is so diverse
Now now pharios, do not make everyone part of the same straw
if i have to give my double take on this, personally i would never go down with a stranger, even if i felt attracted, but each of us is different
i used to like a dear friend of mine at first, i approached her and we became friends, but then as the friendship deepened i went like "i am glad i didn't try to progress further".

I still like her as friend (she is one of my closest friends), since she's a cute and brilliant person but eeh, reasons led me to not try.
but many relationships start with a degree of physical attraction, this implies that there is also a pretty solid % of romantic relationships starting with intellectual attraction
Oh that's absolutely true
but physical attraction is surely a thing
i think it's a subjective thing
but yeah people are dumb, a supermarket nearby here had something really hilarious, yet meh happening
A doctor recognized 15 of his COVID Positive patients going around the store, he went to the director to tell this (without telling the names for privacy reasons and professional secret), the director asked by the announcement that the positive people had to go outside
>  25+ ppls went outside.
that there's a chance of this being linked
well even them are recognizing it
for this reason
it's not given to elderly people
AZ is the most violent vaccine
but that aside
if you don't meet the quota, it's your problem
europe **bought**
it's on the contract.
it's not an overpromise here isky
they've delivered only less than 30%
EU bought from them a number of vaccines
tbh
has been acting a bit weird
AstraZeneca itself
and you just go down "sure whatever"
but then the hassle factor kicks in
i like this metaphor
i have my way to dodge such talk, but fuck it
goddamn it
I hate this talk to the core
that was disgusting
Oh by the way this reminds me what happened the other day President Ursula von der Leyen got mistreated by Erdogan
AZ has to fulfill EU demand first
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56529868
i wouldn't doubt that, but Stinger in particular has been an industrial espionage level of incident
Iran stole Stinger technology
i just checked something
ever
one of the worst historical decisions
as well
Italy is a founding country
Eh depends, sometimes France gets too much pro-US and that annoys germany
you share trade policies with us
even if you don't have €
We are still an economic block
than then became an economic block
and make this big community
we diced to reunite
Since we got a bit scarred by fighting eachother
Being European means sharing history
it's like less than a pizza per month
come on. 4 , 5 0 monthly increase.
was giving 4,50€/m more on doctors salary
one of their latest screwed up policies
which is suppressing freedom of speech too
Poland is having a left winged dictator streak
(honest ping, sorry if annoyed you)
and for the rest i think <@!174272493777977344> would be better to explain
absurd propaganda campaigns are getting spreaded
PLN has less value than Tunisian currency
Well economy is basically getting destroyed by their gov
what are you referring to exactly? because poland is a melting disaster that gets radioactive as the time passes
in the past this would have sparkled a war
while erdogan and Charles Michel, EU president council were talking
she's European Commission President, she was let to sit on the side of the room on a sofa
with erdogan
god  offended and mistreated during the conference
Ursula von der Leyen
you can't do that to the EU representative
ffs erdogan
with turkey
i am still angry at what is happening
it's one of the longest periods of peace humanity ever saw
and a cold war
sadly current world is result of a world war
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
that' s ww2 fault
during ww2
and was actually allied to the axis
tfw Romania speaks a neolatin language
^
ye
yet austria is european, hungary wants to do things alone
for centuries
they shared history with Austria
is an oddball
honestly hungary
hilarious lol
Trade Taxes!
Embargo!
want to kill a country?
Wars are fought on the table nowadays
No war will happen
really
Eh Russia being russia there
i denied twice
not wrong rofl
you are actually right
i corrected myself
pug
but it's out of time, you can't do things alone and be sure that everything will go well, we live in a globalized world
wrong on this view
Hold on you're not
CEB: "Let's print some money to help struggling countries damaged by pandemic"
Poland&Hungary: "You aren't letting us deny freedom of speech properly, so we will veto against it"
for example
this had a negative impact with emergency funds
by vetoing eachother
sometimes it seems they act as they're playing a game called "Fool the EU"
but the ruling class in this case
i don't really think it's the country itself
but some ways adopted by Poland and Hungary are just counter-productive in this part
Eastern Europe, due to USSR and some other things have a slower "Europeanization" process
did
and central
let's say that most of western europe
to stand up in the global scenario
but yeah at some point we realized we had to join up
we force-square circles that coudn't be otherwise squared since the ancient times
of course there are some things that needs to be resolved, but i wouldn't mark it as impossible
the more it gets used, the more gets better
reminder that google is a self learning algorithm
we just don't notice/pay attention
AIs are already present in our lives on some extent
so a "From the bottom to the top" AI
but it would be a self learning one
i do believe that AI can reach similar levels near human
I think you can't even legally really ban it in eu
Your dictating party lost its mind, this will snowball even harder now
There is a reason if eu and un actively support those
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
No please polish gov
The shit
and that's a lot^
coz of pollution
i wonder how much will take until bejing will look like a postapocalyptic wastelandey-city
pollution goes brrrr
yeah
well that was napoleon sitting at the blackjack table without looking at the cards he got
Napoleon
i think pug used wrong words
nothing
no freedom of speech whatsoever
yeah
but policies changed
and xi is no different
mao was just a dictator
it's the really bad version of capitalism
China is not only capitalistic, but imperialistic in the wrong timeframe
6 men, 4 women, 1 child per couple
loss in workforce and in many things
demographic collapse
but fear not
china problem is their adopted policies
lank is right
lmao
infact € vs $ is up to 1:1,20 ratio

what is federal reserve doing?
omg people
or you can't rank up
for example here you need an uni degree first and foremost
elite police are supposed to have completed many important steps
that's coz system is rotted
In b4 inflation goes up to 8 points just to do so
In the end i really wanna see how poland thinks to pay back debts with a potato currency
Yes they would try
As i have stated before it's all good till pandemic ravages eu and distracts it
You can't veto a judge sentence
Plus at some point european high court will start leashing on those two, there is no veto in those cases
Doesn't deny
Delays
Depends, veto on such things
They're normal people, no different from others
Imagine what would happen if eu officially started protecting them
While western world opens slowly doors for them
You resume emargination on lgbtqi
It's ridiculous how poland goes backwards in time
Goddamn it
Duda putting a puppet
Now that makes sense
Aaah
So that would be a violation
Since Maastricht
This
No it works lank
If they use certain fuels
Let's make businesses pay less
Ye for example
With such methods
Lank we fall into several utopias and dystopias
Then we get a government of terror
With capitalism
So yes you can actually fix capitalism
I will.
If i feel i can gain an advance as businessman by using less polluting options
You have to give companies a reason to switch.
Calm down that's a wrong approach
Good
Eh
But these lobbysts are well aware that their legacy wont last since oil is finite
That's because humans
You have to inform, convince and push people
It's also a matter of "doing propaganda" in safeguarding the environment too
On your parking slot
For example here the gov pays you to install a charge pad for your electrical car
Look at electrical cars, they're slowly getting pushed more and more
We don't have an alternative
We slowly drop them off
By suddenly blocking off pollution sources
You can't cause a technological shock
That pic is a proof
We are already in the right direction
rip northern italy, all coz of concentrating industries in a swamp
btw

like coal did
i am curious what will happen when oil will start losing it's economic power
i agree with isky here
^
Still, their policies give 0 care about the enrovinment
they just hide and offload part of their pollution
but putting that aside, china is one of the worst polluters
lit worst air of whole europe
with their coal power stations
uncle poland
You're forgetting
this is my reaction seriously.
goddamn
But each its own
I disagree
That would be meh lol
Ofc you can't fine shareholders
Lank
Responsible
Are directly
Administrators
But it's wrong to assume yhat a corporate upper echelon is a criminal by default
Ya got this? Got respect the law
Govs should just enforce their laws better
I think we should check them better and interfer if they fall off the line
Lank that wont work
Meh
Well each its own but keep in mind that capitalism does capitalist interests and there are many ways to turn that interest into positive enrovnmental change
D:
oh dear hollow point
https://puu.sh/HyC03/c41529b73b.png
gun or not gun
if someone wants to kill someone else, he will just do it
too much on this case
nah lank, i think you're being influenced by US
but of course other than that (so basically sports) and hunting guns should be really restricted
for example
i would enjoy owning one and go shooting targets at the polygon
i don't think guns themselves are bad
yeah
Italy
to own a gun
plus you have to get a pretty expensive license
and there is a list of what can be owned
btw here guns are strictly regulated
yeah maybe except that
it's really bad as a gun in any sense
i sometimes wonder if sawn off has even a sense to exist
rubber bullets shotguns are ok as crowd control in extreme situations
Look
since pellets go random
i aim at the general direction, blam you are a corpse wherever i hit
but shotguns can be much more deadlier
yeah i can see how shotguns are easier to handle
Japan got rid of firearms because of their culture, Us can't get rid of them for the same reason
culture wont allow that
yeah i agree on that lank, but again
putting that aside
in b4 bandits with ak47
because an m4, an m16 something on that tier, is just military grade
Depends on the rifle
but not a freaking m16
as self defence
i can pass a small caliber pistol
^
what?
self defense?!
Military grade
I have to be honest, i lived most of my life in an MP station coz of my dad work, so i'm used of living near guns. But i can also understand that "US culture has guns in its blood", take this as dismissive but guns will never get ridden of, tho again regulating is something that can be done. Why the hell should i be able to own a military grade firearm?
i have to see that you're carrying a gun
Concealed carry yeah has to be removed
Assault Weapon Ban is the least they can do
I don't honestly think, as an outsider, that US can get rid of Firearms, but it can be lessened
But it should be teaching it, otherwise the issue will NEVER be solved
isky?
LA maybe?
of course the streak will go on
if you just educated your son that shooting the bird that lands on the window is fine
has to teach the new generations
if US wants to lower guns by the way
independently of the overall number
but that's every 100k
italy's number is because of the 4 big criminal organizations
so they will never get in
death penality is still up meanwhile
y
you keep it? stay away from us
EU Abhors Death Penality
for one simple reason
can't become EU
Turkey
Calm down
there's a reason if you are supposed to pass the evalutation here at least
i wasn't implying that's okay to panic for a cop
i am absolutely 100% with you in this point
But yeah there is a reason if electric pistols (taser cousins) exist.
I think that a policeman should aim to kill only if posed under equal threat, no one should be allowed to take an human life otherwise (thus i abhor death penality)
Even getting processed gets you at least suspended from the job
Here such thing would end, after a long investigation and court tribulation, with the cop being arrested if the judge found the cop guilty.
The same of excess of self defence in few words.
What, after watching the video, the cop did wrong, was to freaking panic shot the kid. He overreacted in short.
Get away is a big word, it says that investigations are under way.
well i need to go to work now, i will answer later if i have to
is on another whole level
we share several laws, constitutions, citizenship
Being an EU member is another
Trade deals are one thing
while holding up such a barbaric (this is how i call it, i mean no offence) sentence
but i assure you, no country can become part of EU
that there were other factors
i mean i am sure
not now not ever
we have a few examples.
there's not that much history in truth
when china banned it.
and they did migrate indeed
coz it would just migrate.
if the major economic blocks accept it, even one of them, all this talk equals nothing
Again isky
capitalist cares **only about** gain - costs
they're capitalists
they care about costs
trust me
"China bans crypto, fine i will go to alaska to host there, i will even spend less coz of cold weather"
else china v2 happens
would need to be enacted by major economic blocks
the only true ban on crypto that would work
but that aside
rn dark web uses it eh
tax = deterrent
also any idea that comes up is useless if the whole major economic blocks do not decide in unison to get rid of it
if you start regulating it instead and taxing it, the story starts changing
it wont
do you really want these pesky guys on the dark web to go haywire just because they can?
ban = obtaining opposite effect
nah lank
cryptocurrency? current problem is that it's not regulated enough, nothing else
by how it works
NFT is just nasty-er
by nature
Cryptocurrency is fungible
NFT is not fungible
NFT is the opposite of Cryptocurrency
yeah it-s wild
the top comment with > 1k likes of the video expresses my tought
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ3LphA-SW4
The heck mexico?
at least
not easily
not in europe
individuals can't be tracked down
i will sue you.
in EU you can't check me.
Outlawed, GDPR
if x person is cryptomining, how do you catch him?
how are you going to catch these people?
and tell me
This is more an issue of the laws not catching up with technological advancements
Tax evasion is not fought by putting harsher sanctions on it.
tell that to people who fight tax evasion
"Come out, take the candy"
by giving people benefits for denouncing crypto possession
If EU Bans it and US doesn't, people will go in the us for example
not only in some places
And to do that you need to ban it in the whole world
and this is next to impossible in the current digital era
you have to get rid of all copies of the software
not anymore.
it's not like that
Where is the difference between a virtual thing and a physical one in this world?
for example sex workers are still banned in italy because of cultural reasons
for that to happen
you need a cultural change
No it isn't
Banning something is not something that happen with a clap of hands
that was not my point
nvm i misread
also tax = profit for the gov
than to ban
to tax
i agree with you, but it's easier
sure
till then it will only rampage
something will happen
only then
simply adding steps is not going to work
as i've stated several times, only when all the major powers will start getting fed up with the deal
then i move.
then convert from theirs to mine
if one country is up i convert in theirs.
globalized world, local currencies mean nothing
EU yes, i can see it in the foreseeable futures
you are hard challenging utopias here isky
+1
US and climate accords
then rip.
accept it
if the economic blocks, even ONE of them
And that's what i was saying
You'd have to mass ban to obtain that
isky
Chinese cryptominers, part of them, moved to canada
that's why i said that isky was not understanding my point
i never doubted about the issue
so yeah lank, i am sorry if i was misunderstood
on the paper yes
ah i don't know anymore at this point
but the how is something that really bothers me and makes the thing much more harder,
but yeah, to be clear, i agree with you that cryptocurrency are to be banned
but it isn't
just because USA has just 2 parties this seems invalid
Governments act based on the political parties who are in it
that still exists
one form of direct democracy
a pretty chonky number of them
you will need to gather up signatures
if you want to propose a law about the cryptocurrency law
for example
in the right direction
Talking about it is already something
politically the thing is not a 0-1 switch
i agree with you
Because morally
My argument has never been moral
not a button
it's a whole complex machine
take part
where mass media
here is also
the issue will get ignored.
if the people who elect other people don't know about the issue
the parliament is elected by the people
Laws needs to be approved by a majority of the 2 chambers of the parliament
what last law
i don't enact something i am not aware of
how?
how are they going to ban it?
about the issue
If you don't arise EU and USA  public awareness
there is in this case, i just presented you
?
needs to be arisen first
What i would say here is that public awareness
Ignore the shade, ban is a total drastic failure.
no it's not lazy, i need to seriously consider all the shades. Because if i don't my actions will be less effective.
In this case you would need for each economic block to ban cryptocurrency. The shade is that USA and EU don't give a cent about the problem yet.
Isky then what can i say i am the kind of person who lives in the "Nothing is White, Nothing is Black, Everything is Gray" way
I tend to considerate everything
i am NOT saying it should be allowed
what i mean
Isky i think you're just not understanding
as payment method.
hell i sometimes see businesses accepting cryptocurrency
as the current state of the thing is EU and US are not caring
Again i agree, but you need to, worldwide, ban the deal
not now not ever
would still mean more rare 100 normies running their set in the basement can't outdo a corporate budget
because of rarity
or rises in value
Corporates are private entities
without a mandate.
Governments should not be able to break privates privacy
i respect religious beliefs but uuuh you can't do that during a pandemic really
the religious celebration in india in the river was all over the news
Come on boris
"are you a cop? You gotta tell me if you're a cop"
(too late need to go to bed)
look i've given my two dollars about the matter, i don't have anything else to say
I am sorry if i seemed too pushy, but i can't automatically agree and say i am okay just because yes
thus said, thank you for the conversation
well people what can i say at this point, each its own. Imho democracy is just a complex machine that requires many steps to be activated
if a law goes against the country itself, thus the elite too, it wont pass
is also part of a country
the elite of a country
because
Oh absolutely corruption exists, but you're making the reasoning too much extreme and black
it would be hard to see it enacted
but if something goes against the cultural face of a country
they influence the laws
That's not entirely correct, the elite is also part of a country
for example we got a certain measure that i wont sit here to explain that got passed because a political party strongly flagging it got elected into power
But laws are a mirror of the country
Could be.
a mere example
this is what i was talking above
https://europa.eu/citizens-initiative/home_en
what's that
With all respect i think it's still a very hazardous thing to do with a ravaging pandemic
Eh
But there is a judge already
Why should a jury even exist
Us judicial system is weird
ok ok
iirc 14
Crime liability here is... lemme check
voting is a delicate matter that a 17 y/o often doesn't know how to handle
i disagree on voting age
I think it's fine to raise AoC
similar laws on many matters
look europe has more or less
behind the authorization of a judge tho
but a 16 y/o can legally marry here
ye
one step out of the bonds and into the jail you go
But at least here in italy, the law is really strict on this consent
it's more or less what western europe adopted
on 14 y/o
Austria and Germany also have age of consent
age of consent here is 14 with heavy conditions
you people deserve better services in this matter
at this rate probably Western Europe will be a spearhead in this direction.
well at least something moves for the trans in uk too
mb
You're right
it would escalate really quickly ending up with france installing a Puppet Government in the place
NATO
that france signed something more important than Etente Cordiale
You-re forgetting
let me rectify this
ok
ye it's high
that's really high
so high?
what.
wait
and iirc 26 y/o is the passive right for senate
here you can vote for the chamber of deputees at 18
ye
It happened once, and my dad (MP Officer) was surprised how, that a judicially stripped of the ability "to understand and want" held *legally* an high caliber pistol in his house. this was an error, you can't own a gun license if you are "unable to understand and want"
but yeah i used the sentence "To understand and want" because this is what is used legally here, an adult can be stripped by the judge of this ability (legal, bad crime you lose the right to vote and stuff, and judicial, you have bad mental issues hence you lose the right to vote)
it's a matter of opinion
Well there is not much to discuss on this
but these are not the rule
sure exceptions exist
and i agree with mel
but not fully
my reasoning
Kat is kinda really near
The laws disagree
That as an adult you are supposed to have the ability "to understand and want "
and i know kids that are militant of extreme right movements because "it's cool."
we can't make a rule out of exceptions
i've seen this happen majority of the cases
let's say you start realizing your political direction around 18 y/o
but don't overestimate a mind of a 16 y/o
sure you can tell them the importance of voting
Majority of teens nowadays wouldn't be able to vote, that's why i disagree, you would need to *teach them* but can you really teach how to vote?
after that, nothing such of what you have mentioned was a thing
but
okay wait deporting of homosexuals happened in ww2
this is worse than how italy reacted to this, and italy has the freaking vatican
what.
.
yeah that makes no sense
if not, child gets taken away
such a thing would be looked badly upon here, but also the gov would press the minor to see if she can handle the child
that's rough
and overcomplicated
Our laws are really really twisted
*Italy.
Children under the age of 14 cannot be held criminally liable for any offence and persons aged 14 to 17 (inclusive) can only be held criminally liable where they have been judged capable of forming the necessary criminal intent in relation to the specific offence. *
japan reaction to covid was weird
i am not suprised
i dare to say
they're not vaccining?
what do you mean
what?
France imperialism going brrr?
the worst of the worst must be made known to later generations "Look how bad this was, this has to never repeat"
history should NEVER be censored
I think that no matter how bad
oh my
and the Head of State during State of Emergency/War
are the Ministry of Defense
the only 2 politicians with the power to control military
here the only politician
thus lost all his supporters befor ethe election days
by acting like an idiot
tho he blew himself
we were near having a 19 y/o counsellor in the city council
in the town where i live
italy^
everything else = 25.
comunal, regional, deputees, referendums = 18
but that's absurd...
from bergamo
and that's a local italian newspaper
holy shit
but that's a story for another channel
hah i just remember one of our deputees in the parliament getting dragged by the guards away yelling "it's all fake it's all fake!"
we didn't have any law regarding the matter whatsoever
it became solid afterwards
italy was caught unprepared and the response was panicked and badly done
no lockdown was enacted yet
so it was at the start of first wave
9 feb 2020
the date is up there
yeah prob
with one exception that stays in the red
regions went back to yellow/orange restriction levels
3rd wave is dying down here
but the concept doesn't change
i can't read names as they're too small
it could be italy then
in b4 russian dub Maria becomes russian
poor maria
hahah, that would just ramp up the scale of ridiculousness
Yet here i am, at 27 y/o, played gta since i was 9, i'm no criminal
"Look if you let your kid play GTA, he will become a criminal"
this is on the line of
really
it's a baseless conjecture
This is straight out idiotic
who cares?!
and even if it was
I mean i strongly doubt that someone would start believing in reincarnation "coz i watched slime"
pardon me the term^
but really when i hear these kinds of things, i wonder if humans don't like to go backwards sometimes
oh ffs
but i find really hard to get why slime
i could try to understand banning Konosuba
Wait lol
i have a mere example here, in italy, mere friends of whatever gender, kiss eachother on the cheeks when meeting, this is considered "invasion of personal space" in many other cultures
Yeah indeed
i was wrong from starters, but let's automoderate ourselves
dw
but +1
well now now, let's keep the place serious
Are we sure it's not fake news?
https://www.latestnewssouthafrica.com/2021/04/27/ernest-khalimov-what-happened-to-him/
if, of course,  a law was broken
well yeah here the gov must interfere, prosecute the administrators and start fining heavily the company
are you shot-firing the SPQR??
but cultural contact is what is bringing humanity step by step onwards
on that level
sadly it's a thing that's rarely done
gn cecil
i talk as an italian which has tourism as one of the driving wagons of the economy
because tourists bring money
but that aside in the western world we are okay with showing our countries to the tourists
curiosity: Gaijin is a vulgar term, the formal term is Gai**koku**jin
^
THere's also the factor "come and look at glorious nippon, you lowly gaijin" in this case
with this
Oh i agree
i discovered Japanese culture bit by bit
you can get bits that you like and then discover more slowly
let's say that you don't have to get the "full experience" for interest to be awoken
Holy... i just saw the news, they reported that COVID deaths went up a 89% in India till yesterday
AOC is?
*a change of wind*
it's caused by the fact that he had to do stuff that trump didn't
but claims to do so
something that just does not exist
I think of left wing in USA as "right wing" in poland tbh
was heavily funded by middle eastern oil overlords
Hilary election campaign
let's not forget who was backing hilary
0,83€ 1$
it's on an "ouch level" rn
This reminds me checking out USD-EUR ratio
and Europe decided that the world was theirs to take during colonial era
well they were direct descendants of europeans in the end
ye i know
it's often invoked to defend free firearms
but but the founding fathers!
in 2 parties.
since you can't cram many different human minds
Two party system is borked from the start
Yeah but it's positive that there are differences
Left and Right must exist to counterbalance politics, economics and so on
The issue that often one of the two has so much infighting that stops doing it's own role to counterbalance the other
Plus if you do that in case lps discharges there water pipe will explode
You doing shower? Too bad you get fried coz someone turned on the toaster
These mad heads used to wire up grounding to water pipes back in the 80s!
But grids, lpses and grounding have to abide specific laws here
I don't know us laws in this matter
Prob yeah
Yes
Uncle faraday
But we got a counter to this
Either it's really really bad luck
So my guess is either the LPS is not good
I am reasoning
I am not trying to debate here
Maybe the grid is old?
Yeah but grounding should be made in such a way to prevent this
Nowadays rods are grounded in a way to deter the discharge
And i will prob drop a few bucks
That sucks and i am sorry to hear that, but i am kinda surprised, i am used to think lightning rods as given
I don't agree with revolutionary takes but each its own
net neutrality should be voted again
Now to fix things properly
do not overdo it, people also need their time to digest bad and sad events
without mentioning even tofu
There are so many dishes without meat that can be done
That's why i dislike the Jury system
Exactly
and there are death sentences called out because of 1 person homicide
A mass murder is still killing someone rady
not based on emotional sense of justice.
Hey, the law must be a certain thing
you sentencing the criminal to death for having killed someone? what are you hammurabi?
Again rady, same level of the criminal?
yeah this argument falls in both cases
outright banned by the law
That's why a Judge cannot take a political career here
^
So you ask the gov to place itself on the same level of said criminal?
and this discussion falls in "how debatable and meh is the jury system"
As sentenced that should be  the point, fenny
i really doubt that the worst scum on planet earth would be left allowed to escape
There are people paid to do that
you know
You always have the option of forced labour as sentence
why should the gov be able to kill someone while sentencing it as wrong
isn't that hypocrisy?
Then how are you different from a serial killer?
and i strongly believe we evolved much further than that
and his "an eye for an eye"
but killing someone is no different from hammurabi
I am aware of that, but you can't treat the worst criminals of the planet with sweets and games
Surely more humane than death sentence imho
death sentence is a "quick bail out"
You get the real suffering out of that
I think that the best way to punish the worst crimes is life sentence in complete isolation
Guillotine was just the son of the axe
there's no humaneness in neither options
as if any execution method wasn't already barbaric
South Carolina reinstated Firing Squad death penality
Hold up hold up really?
good stuff
what is that
??
europe sometimes fails on "simple matters" like this one
these people committed mass murders, but no let's keep red brigades terrorists until they're elders before giving them back to italy
of 80 years old age range
gj on france for deciding to give us back Red Terrorists only when they're old people
but while we are on this note
wtf
ok ok, i shouldn't but this is just hilarious
and it's a whole different detatchment of armed forces
This is why we pay the "Penal Police"
it's a matter of laws there
If the gov really wants, they wont repeat it isky
where you hanged people to rise up the crowd
but this is not the 1200s
But retribution doesn't solve anything
i wouldn't give death sentences even to mass murderers, Denying an human life is just wrong and barbaric
do you really believe you can rehabilitate such person?
Let's take for example our Mafia boss "Toto Riina", who melted **kids** into the acid
and such as well
of course this requires mental examinations
but what if the judge decides that a case is not rehabilitable
on **possible cases**
i would agree with you
This is the issue lank
Forced Labour is the best option
but i cannot accept death penality neither
and i can agree on your views
But i see your points about solitary confinement
it's just painless.
Guillotine is no different by the old hand axe
but it can be of X random timeframe
i made a mere example
and how a torture can become
watch out on this particular detail
it can be after 3 years
it can be after 1 week
because you don't get told **when** you will be executed at all
Oh japanese system has taken a weird spot on that
i have US as mental example
I know isky
the jurors can be emotionally affected and waver in sentencing
Scotland should just do that secession referendum and join the eu back
many many people are in that situation here (italy)
oh dw, i fully understand what you mean
since you're still employed
you get just the money
if it's temp unemployment (if for istance your business temporarily closed sending you home for the time being)
you get treated as other unemployed
if you're unemployed coz covid, as in not temp unemployment
i mean hold up
that's the same here
ah yes of course
which is still less than minimum wage
while giving you the money
actively
find new job
here the unemployment helps you
mb
ah
EU observes what happens on northern ireland really closely
?
what about the "Give back ulster to ireland"
"Oh look they managed to do it!"
tho
Situation may change if Scotland manages to leave
i see
(Wales)
But where is "the scions of King Arthur" country at?
Northrumbian joining scots
happening
oh i can see that
Engine One: Rich, law abiding and wealthy eu members
Engine Two: The rest
with a "Two Engines Europe"
I foresee that we will end up
situations like Poland and Hungary have to stop.
But tbh, EE has to get its shit together
i don't think that will happen
EE?
where brrr death penality, brrr erdogan, brrr and so on
it's not the turkey situation
but EU has no real reason to outright reject Scotland
it can be running out as much as you want
maybe on some conditions.
i think that, other than the complex process that scotland would have to undergo, EU would gladly accept the country that holds the oil in the north sea
UK is not EU anymore, so this rule doesn't apply
and will always support it's unity
so EU basically cannot accept Spain's situation
EU by **law** protects member states sovereignity
Hold on
Btw what do you think will happen when angela merkel will step down from Germany
From eu
Tho i can see the issue of having to deliver everything by sea
You can't imagine how much satisfaction could come out from that, it would be a slap with a glove to england
y
usually you need some kind of study to develop such things
i wonder if it was made by an engineer
but yeah even then the design would not work
i know they exist but they're not the majority
but the design of that bench
i was not debating that
Oh absolutely
to not have a back
it would be uncomfortable for their back
Yes isky but keep in mind people that cannot walk anymore have to sit there nearly all the time
basically

btw one seocnd
But it has never happened on this level
Plus nuclear armaments are there, we don't want to" put rats in corners"
Well i'm not trying to be "easy peasy " here, i really hope that at least the missiles stop, it's too much heated rn
to move its ass
and EU has authority over things but France keeps waiting uncle sam
Nato exists
in the whole union
since they're the overreacting interventist
from slumber
the issue is that for EU to mobilize it would require France to wake up
there's no way that putin leaves US doing things
Russia will as well
ah if US moves its ass
well yes we can't really understand since we never experienced it. But it doesn't mean we should sit and do nothing
it has never happened in the past regarding this situation
the media are **overloading** us with this chain of events
Eh i don't know if the same could be applied this time
more people will die
well you can't really leave the situation as it is
i can already sense our gov "We are sending peace mission forces"
and from an outsider standpoint i smell that international community will hardcore butt in this time
this time around
but it seems like they're going all out
nah i know it never stopped
it's incredible to hear such things in 2021
My god, it's still going on?
gotcha
ahhh
i know you moved many times
oh where are you moving to aria?
people are just dumb
please that's a dangerous bmi, that's no matter to be shrugged off
Take care elaina
(just listened to a speech in our parliament)
rn
Our stance on this is: "Both wrong, Both right, Land belongs to both, 1 capital for both"
The situation is really complex
but EU did butt in in other situations, northern africa in last years is an example
EU is not an battle ready machine, so any response from EU countries is always slow (without saying that France always sits there waiting uncle sam). Sure, by instance, today our majority party in pariament (italy) just started pressing on the matter, but the best we could do alone would be a "Peace" military expedition, but that requires a law to be passed, it would go fast only if the ministers decided that it's a priority thing. Stop war with war in short.
I think that, since EU countries are more or less similar, they're all in similar situations.
Tl;dr if EU interfers, it will be always off-timed
with this statement he's washing his hands
Biden stated that he can't do shit because Trump gave a blank slate to Netanyahu to do whatever
UN security Council dodged the situation
Biden is dodging the situation
and palestine
israel
latest news, US ambassadors are spreading out to ask cease fires to surrounding countries
```The EU has been more critical of Israel and more supportive of the Palestinians than the US. The general position of the EU is that a Palestinian state should be based on the 1967 borders with land swaps, Jerusalem should be divided and become the capital of both states, and a negotiated settlement be found for the Palestinian refugee issue, although member states have sometimes been divided on these issues. However, all EU states universally consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law. The EU has insisted that it will not recognize any changes to the 1967 borders other than those agreed between the parties. Israel's settlement program has, thus, led to tensions.[30] The most difficult of these issues, however, is Jerusalem. Israel has insisted that the city will remain its undivided capital, and is fiercely opposed to its re-division. Israel does not regard Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem as settlements, while the EU does. East Jerusalem has been a de facto part of Israel following Israel's unilateral annexation of the area, while the EU, along with the rest of the international community, regards it as occupied territory subject to negotiations. The EU has frequently criticized Jewish construction in East Jerusalem.```
btw
i'm reading the international stances on this
there was a call to the authorities this time
ye but it's 4 days ago
^
if for example anyone manages to eliminate him
Netanyahu's right hand man will just replace him
Ye
y
i don't see russia involvement as positive
What COULD pop out out of nothing is putin butting in, but that would escalate up the issue
it's not simple at all
UN said: <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> 
EU is too slow as engine to interfer as whole, France is waiting US reaction.
this is why US wont interfere
to Israel
Trump gave a blank slate
again
gn
Take care carol
i'm scared that US might push Saudi Arabia in doing something here in a wrong way
no one deserves that situation
Look i hope that both of you stay safe and nothing happens.
i'm an outsider
oh yeah i admitted that
btw solo, i am sorry if it seems like that, i'm not trying to dismiss the situation
so mr trump just made the situation worse
The issue is that Trump empowered Netanyahu
are equipped with those
submarines
do not need scramble
Anti ballistic missiles
we have the tech already
intercept it
The G8 will move onto something quickly only if it feels strictly threatened
let's keep that aside
but that will fall under another argument
it's because freaking CCP
if it wasn't for China, NK would have crumbled out of the sanctions the international community leashed on it for istance
"Ah we got a problem? Embargo!"
Current world
i don't believe into possible third world wars
and fuels the extreme right wings in the rest of the western world
The issue is that this worsens some views
a museum **is** and must remain a museum
THat. that shouldn't have happened
on that piece of land
Religion is also what sent europeans into a crusade streak
pug
US doesn't support Palestine
that kickstarted the everlasting problem
made diaspora
Kingdom of Babylonia plus SPQR
but this also means that in several situations if they're not involved they wont interfer
So yeah, the great superpowers try to keep some sort of balance
one of these can delete New york as whole in 1 instant
you can't stop these.
and start dropping tungsten rods.
put a satellite up there
also ban Kinetic bombardment which is more fearsome than nukes
said conventions
and decided to go rogue
Ah side note US left Anti ICBM treaty
In November 2020, the US successfully destroyed a dummy ICBM. The ICBM was launched from Kwajalein Atoll[98][99] in the general direction of Hawaii, triggering a satellite warning to a Colorado Air Force base, which then contacted USS John Finn. The ship launched a missile to destroy the US dummy, still outside the atmosphere. Bloomberg Opinion writes that this defense ability "ends the era of nuclear stability"
i have is this
latest anti icbm info
Mind you i also absolutely agree that you should go slow on Nuclear Threats
as anti-icbm
btw wikipedia mentions David's Sling
stay safe
they're still barraging missiles?
D:
uh again?
On 10 December 2015 Arrow 3 scored its first intercept in a complex test designed to validate how the system can detect, identify, track and then discriminate real from decoy targets delivered into space by an improved Silver Sparrow target missile
Arrow 3s included?
are **anti satellite missiles**
that israel has
but freaking Arrow 3s
and i wasn't talking of that one
ah i understand what you're referring at
iron dome?
to avoid a launch at all
of course you want
plus the more we advance, the more these anti icbm will evolve
with Arrow 2 and Arrow 3
Israel has it's own anti ICBM system
with Aster missiles
France, Italy and UK have destroyers around the sea to stop ICBMs
why shouldn't you be on defcon level of alert?
Look if it's a war mel, and you know that a nuke could be involved
yea sorry for that
2 different characters
divide historical arthur from legendary one
Rome fell in that century
King arthur was depicted in fighting the saxons in 5th century
Welsh consider themselves the descendants of King Arthur who was a Roman General
(Hadrian Wall)
which were banned from SPQR
Scots descended from Picts
those
ah
not iberian ones
i think the celts in questions were britain ones
I don't think anyone is saying that here
yeah
SPQR completed that thing
yeah
meanwhile other civilizaitons took that land
since Babylonia
Jewish people were pushed out
Diaspora happened
you fine solo?
omg
We as living beings are twisted and complicated
because
The human society is complicated
France decided to go full on North african last years situation
well i'm not entirely on agreement
BDS?
Otherwise we would have been condemning the dark past for nothing
Eh but, we can't go down that route
we want globalization
what's that post ww2 germany? no please
because force would answer force
but that's not a good solution
If a necessary evil escalates the situation, that will call out serious attention by the G8
vyn
please keep it serious
rn
that could end up being italy's stance since he's in the majority
Today one of our politicians said: "Palestine is wrong, Israel is wrong, land belongs to both, make 1 capital for both"
```The EU has also been highly critical of Israeli military actions in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon, often referring to them as "disproportionate" and "excessive force" and calling for an immediate cease-fire. During Operation Defensive Shield in 2002, the European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution calling for economic sanctions on Israel and an arms embargo on both parties. Following the Gaza War, the European Parliament endorsed the Goldstone Report. The EU has also been critical of Israel's Gaza blockade, referring to it as "collective punishment."```
EU DID interfer in the isreael situation
Btw btw reading wikipedia
it's all grey
nothing is black or white
israel has a bit of tendency of using excessive force if this is the point
each time
EU denied by "Just short of full membership"
asked for EU membership
Israel has multiple times
btw
IDF is Israeli Defence Force?
Palestine is innocent
but this doesn't mean that
Israel has committed international law violations, this is one of the Die-Hard stances that EU has taken on the subject
Yeah
eh i can see the palestinians trying to outdo the iron dome "to end the ammunitions"
which is the worst
it could boil down into an attrition conflict
i really hope nothing happens to both of you
Solo is the missile battery still going on?
i've watched a video of phosphorous in action
yes but not a bomb of that
that thing has the capability of melting one's insides if breathed
wtf target marking?
you can put it out only with dirt and sand
Freaking White pHosphorous, that thing is no different from napalm
Content unavaiable
yeah using them as shields
not to solo
yeah i was referring in general
that sounds like Hammas using civilians as shields
this is not how we keep a discussion here
Please people, respect each other
it's so complex that not even big brains came out of the situation yet
this is why i said it's grey
I'm not saying you're wrong
it-s normal to have different opinions, but please keep it civil
people calm down, the discussion is complicated
oh well bitcon will get hard slapped, others need to follow that example or it will be worth nothing
i see
of course not every discussion can have positive outcomes
Discussion is never wrong in my honest opinion
carol
entirely understandable
they already had their share of the cake on the turkey deal
hm right
i think they're not saying anything only because Biden wont act
But you know putin
Russia has been weirdly too much silent on this situation
uuugh that's even more hideous
good night
But now i'm going to sleep, i hope you get a moment of rest Carol and solo. Stay safe and strong.
carol and solo are free to update on the situation
As long as i know yes, but it's not on the level of yesterday barrage
uuuh
so basically sending the IDF to gaza
ah ok
US you mean?
i understood
ye ye it's a correct term
I see
did the bombings halt or are still ongoing
how are you doing carol?
But yeah putting politics aside
Russia and China are dead silent, they didn't even speak about the matter
expecially in the past
Meanwhile EU is taking the "both are wrong, land belongs to both" stance, tho it's important to note that EU is hypercritical about israel because of international law violations
- Donald Trump
in short.
"There Netanyahu, do whatever you want, blank slate"
in this matter
US wont step in because Trump played his cards in the dumbest way possible
Shemmy
Spain was maybe the most brutal
surely it was better than the Spanish empire
also depending on the time period
and british empire had its pros
yeah
depending on the time period
Ottoman empire for example had a tax for those who were not professing Islamic faith, meanwhile western world hang or burned to death those who were refusing to become catholics
give caesar what belongs to caesar
but we cannot say that *everything* they did was wrong
and both did wrong things
both had their golden age
are Keystones both in history
Let's say that British and Ottoman empire
did they stop trying to overtake the Iron Dome?
Hey how is the rocket barrage situation solo?
but US approach is really slow, calling in Egypt "and friends" will take so much time
third time this happened in only one week
Okay apparently UN is not interfering because of US veto
Yes my bad there sorry
It's just the international focus going in a weird way to demonize israel alone
And it's wrong to say that "palestine" is wrong as it's also wrong to say that "israel" is wrong
I am just saying that both have their share of wrongdoings
No absolutely
Yeah that's why both countries are at wrong.
I am not judging since the situation is pretty complicated
Calling out "war crimes"
Lots of mass media are demonizing Israel rn, it intensified after they blew up the telecom. Building
They're more central if anything
the more one observes it, the more it seems just a different shade of the same one
have different colors?
that democrats and republicans
Can you really say
often there's misconception about political colors, expecially if the person is from US, where the political scene is not really colored.
if anything
it's more centre-right
liberalism is not really a leftist thing
(which became Grecia in italian)
"Graecia"
that "Greece" descends from the name that romans gave to it
Keep in mind
finally
yeah
that it's 3 hundred years old
it's really important also to take note
"Wealth of nations"
you can also take the opposite example
good advice here
^
but this is clearly not the right "way"
that will affect a situation
oh well yeah, one cannot predict all the variables
it will crack down at some point
and it's still rising
inflation skyrocketed
but this is result of current politics
it was 3.2 in feb
<@!174272493777977344> the situation is going so downhill seriously, how long does the polish gov want to keep up with this "fiesta"?
<@!203444794737950720>

omg poland stop
we will see
ofc it wont be instant, the shock is big
it will
it's the same as a financial shock
Expecially ethereum, could zero down the loss
it will be recovered by a major %
i really strongly believe it wont be permanent at all
temporary effect
imho
thank you
I understand
he's turning 21
he's younger than me
I have an issue, i don't know how to handle my brother anymore. He's always hypercynical about everything. You can't reason with him, coz he will fake listening only to go back to his previous behaviour. I help him in doing stuff if he needs help, and what do i get as thanks? ungrateful behaviour treating me like crap afterwards.
He pretends from me certain behaviours but he will not comply if you ask him to act in some ways.
He thinks i'm costantly against him but i'm really not.
He doesn't listen to anyone. And he lies constantly about things.
He asks for advices for hours sometimes only to not listen the mentioned advices.
We tried to send him to a psychologist, it didn't solve anything in the end, it was shrugged off as "you probably suffer of ADHD".
You can't touch anything about him or he will get offended. For example i told him yesterday that his way of cheating the uni exam wont work because it's not good for the kind of exam (open answers quiz over 4 books).
I tried talking my parents into this kind of matter, they're powerless as i am, it only leads to useless hour long conversations that i don't want to have anymore.
I just admitted defeat, my internal batteries about this matter have just exhausted and i will start ignoring him from now on.

I am really sorry to have to vent here but i am broken and exhausted about this matter, it's been a buildup over years and years.
Well italy for example handled the pandemic badly initially because we literally *did not have* any law regulating this kind of emergency
uh interesting
i am in italy after all
Yeah i know the gig about how the virus did spread
China refused to give them data, this is their public statement
WHO got denied investigation
Yes
They did suppress the leak about it at the start tho
so yeah i also agree covid is not a biowep
If COVID-19 was a bio weapon, i would say it is a failure, it's too much weak to be considered on that level
Even if it's serious, i have to admit that you made me chuckle.

Anyways yeah really texas, why, i understand that US has firearms in the constitution, but that's taking it back to the "ok corral". We are not in the 19th century...
this is ridiculous
Texas? No please
WAIT WHAT?
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57239610
But middle east yeah, depending on the country
Uh i dunno about russia
This was quite old but Bethesda is just a mass of clowns
it doesn't make sense actually
i know right?
The heck? that's cursed
And that's what makes them cursed
Nft is not standard cp
Even if they are far from being the main issue, it's good if they die
Well good, nft were cursed by how they worked
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-montenegro-china-debt-eu-idUSKBN2BZ22Q
freaking china vulturing on poor countries
since it's a special one
There are children with disablilities in that school
My toughts exactly
same government that bans the abortion by the way^
the headlines
```The minister himself comes to the school's anniversary. Children with disabilities were sent home```
this is messed up, it's not the 1900s anymore.

poland... seriously...
I tend to facepalm in cases like this expecially coz my dad is in mp, so i am like, "how!? Why!? What!?"
Things like these happens. But it's a sign of incompetence
seems to be the best alternative
btw paper straws
fall into banlist
iirc also cigarette buts
okay okay
oh i see
as far as i understood
People, bio plastic is not getting banned
Those are the cases where i feel that being in eu is good
Starting 3rd july goodbye single use plastic
Gg
https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/plastics/single-use-plastics_en
since the thing is from 2017
they were given 4 years time
of slowly adapting
Here industry was already on the process
True true
they *devour* lactose
is an example
kefir bacteria
in our diet.
bacteria that actually process lactose for us
but we can introduce
People with intolerance miss it.
the ezyme is still involved
No ixky
Lactose intolerance arises when people *miss* a certain enzyme
Symbiosys
our gut bacteria does
we don't actually break down food
Oi oi yeah
of the issue
Well at least we can't cover part
I just gave you the case
Tho this doesn't mean we should pollute
We have genetic engineering
We don-t have to wait for evolution
```The PET degrading enzyme of Ideonella sakaiensis, PETase, has been genetically modified and combined with MHETase to break down PET faster, and also degrades PEF. This may possibly, along with other approaches, be useful in efforts for recycling and upcycling of mixed plastics.[7][8][9]```
```Ideonella sakaiensis is a bacterium from the genus Ideonella and family Comamonadaceae capable of breaking down and consuming the plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as a sole carbon and energy source. The bacterium was originally isolated from a sediment sample taken outside of a plastic bottle recycling facility in Sakai, Japan.[2]```
gj sega
Yeah i was just saying
For such system to work, the whole world, or at least the main economic blocks, have to change.
And by looking only at the thing in question ofc it seems unfair
I think it's in the grand scheme of the things
Even internships can be paid by the gov if conditions are met
This is where the rich come into the game
Someone will have to pay for them
These wont spawn money from the void
We pay nhs, we pay school, uni, business startup, rent welfare, and so many more services
Mind you have a very huge welfare that ends even into waste
That who doesn't own an home can live in peace. And that the landlord has to pay more taxes that will go in several directions
Here people without income, get welfare money to rent houses
To those who cannot
To give welfare benefits
You aim into making them pay enough
Why you should aim into making a dent?
Usury is banned by law
On the other side of the coin who owns nothing will pay nothing
You tax to attend uni will rise up
For example, let's say for instance you want to go to university and your family owns 3 lands, 2 apartments and got several cars
And both in indirect
Both in direct taxes
The more stuff you own. The more you pay
Yes
Want more? Sure, but ya gotta pay for them
I don't see anything wrong into owning more residential properties, here we deal with it with taxes
And shemmy i am sorry to hear that
Last case happens
I never said mental illness, sure some cases fall there, but not all
And rotten
Us is ultracapitalistic
No, anc fen made an important point
Shem
Free to think however you want, our welfare is so big that it just doesn't happen that easily
Homeless people are never ignored here. 95% of homeless here are such by other reasons than economical
I get my reward
Thus since i have chosen to take the risks of such
One note about rent here, there are several expenses here, lots of these being all extraordinary, that are entirely charged on the landlord
Like we do here
Or even building gov controlled apartment complexes
I think that having the gov to regulate this market closer is enough for a solution
Ofc
Can i disagree? Housing prices have gone down several times
Thus the house will rot empty
It would go just abandoned because who would rent would not have the money required to buy it
You mean buying more houses to let others live?
Kk
I don't own one
No wait it was an example
Housing services are still services, it's no different from owning land and letting farmers work on it for a price
Income of people pay rent to you it's still an income. If I own and apartment and i use it that way. Mind you that it is not easy peasy, it means having to step down and compete with a housing market
It's required for our evolution
I also hope that humanity goes to the next level and slowly obtains a different and better system than the current one
At least this is my opinion
Any luxury falls into this category
I understand your point, but sources of income cannot be given a reason other than "money"(harmful sources are another matter)
I have seen people buying apartments to open full fledged b&b. I don't think that, in the current system, stripping private property can work.
This discussion in the end falls in parallel with ubi one btw
If one Euro zone country tried that well, we don't print out our own money anymore
If US were to try such a thing, wow i foreese fire
It depends on what the country can do and with which money
Regarding collapse
Well yeah that's a sad reality
For now we are still trying to understand our next step
Pls rady
Lol
And shem, sorry if we diverge of opinion
It collapses
If a country tries alone things
In the current state of the things there is a stalemate
Yeah and as i said before, the whole world has to change
These do not integrate with our country because middle italian resists that
I stated before
Homeless crisis is not economical
Calling for empathy, i was implying that these apartments are there empty coz market outdoes him and he can't overprice rent
Shem i wasn't
Depending on the historical era
Humanity always decides where to draw the lines
And pays taxes only for owning them
Not even one
He can't manage to rent them
Replacing all is impossible, you can't deny people what is theirs. I have a dear friend who is rich. He owns (he not his family) 6 apartments and a piece of land
We already have it
Remove doesn't work, regulating and putting limits it's okay. I have stated it above.
I am from phone
Sorry
I am answering one at a time
For having barred migrant ships
One of our past ministers is under trial for murder and hostage
But in a decade
That problem didn't spawn in one day
Currently these migrants who got nothing got citizenship income from the gov
In the slow recovery part of eu
We were still in 2011 economical crisis
Think whatever you want, shem, real life is not an opinion, eu was really late to share help with us and greece
For a looong time
France completely ignored our pleas to share migrants
Yes sure, but getting waves so huge, on the shoulders of a country like italy
Ooh surely shem
No, they don't know how it works, and thus they can't use it
They struggle to use welfare
Basically these people often do not have the money, but since they're not integrated into our system
Hmmm not entirely
Racism arose after waves started
Don't give such an argument a given
Not strictly economical, it's because Italians got the full brunt of immigration waves and well that doesn't end well
Social reason here
It is still a thing here
Oh yeah that
Also those fall there, but not all
I see i understand but this process is harder than you are saying here
You don't get welfare
That's why on higher capitals
I can see anyone trying to stop such law
Genuine question
And how this government would take this land?
let's assume big complexes with locked rooms
in this case i'm not using the word to say the difference
it's not wrong by itself
Jail must go in coordination with rehabilitation
and they're overcrowded
We have the opposite issue, too many people in jails
In b4 windows XI
Honestly w10 has come a really long way, right now it's alright, we don't really need a 11
Uuuuh, but msoft did say that they would not do a win 11
so it's not even that
No upgrading money, last time microsoft directly converted old product keys
Not really
otherwise bad things happen
about your police system
you have to care
eh
it gives to the authorities too much power and doesn't really actively check on them
let's say that US system is one of the loosely regulated ones
and no i wont hear "it was their life choice" as cover to such a dramatic thing
who slaughtered tons of cops
here entire families of policemen got shattered because of Organized Crime wrongdoings
and the world is *heavily* different on these matters
*drastically* depends on the regulations
lank statement
Hold on
easier
Loosely regulated police system spawns rotten cops
in the same way
police system
the whole world does not regulate
There is one thing to be said tho
my word vs yours
and i believe that's not true
Saying that majority of policemen/women are corrupt is wrong
I strongly disagree fenny
when cops get shot and die.
but scarcely talk
media go full on glamour when one bad cop does bad things
corrupt cops exist because humans are corrupt themselves
costantly
these people risk their lives
of every policemen out there
you can't just make one straw
cop is more of a vulgar term for policeman
It's ridiculous, the world moves forward and poland/Hungary go backwards
but yeah again i will quit this discussion, anyone can be free to think whatever
anyways whatever, this will lead a bit nowhere, each its own.
you're free to say whatever you want yamib, but that has given me the whole package of "Knowledge of how they work and how they're structured"
to police
or just becuase their son got suddenly admitted
i was suggesting that MP is a superior choice than a mere bureaucrat that will turn a blind eye just because a sum of money arrived on their bank account
for police to oversight itself
i know it's wrong
oh yes they are
Bureaucrats are weak to corruption as any military or police organization
nothing happened
done
*here take this money and close your eyes*
faaaar weaker than any public institution might be
to corrupt
it's really really really easy
because civilian institution
Anyways watch out
not "the whole military"
MP is supposed to be a specific entity
Yes? Military Police should watch over police over their long list of jobs
that a civilian should do basically what's military police job
Lank you just suggested
Just because it *has happened* it doesn't mean it's the norm
but on the current situation being depicted at this drastic level? because you see such level of things in freaking Cyberpunk, and that's a dystopia not reality.

if an average person has a problem, it's police duty to help.
now can you really say that police does absolutely nothing to protect?
Not on the origin
can i just, not agree with this?
or at least is put in low priority
just think of a person coming from a minority that needs some documents and gets dismissed just because he's part of minority
affects everything
because such racism doesn't affect just a police system
Institutional Racism needs to be adressed as a whole
we are not adressing the whole picture
if we are talking about acab
i have my system as example, mainly because i lived nearly half of my life in a MP station quarters, and continued to have contact with such institutions after that because of my dad job

Now i'm well aware that not all the world is the same, and i said above that for example US needs more regulations
that all depends on where in the world you are
thrice in this discussion
but i also overstated
i'm saying that acab is overblown, not that's false
in most of the world
but i can bet that this is not regulated
saying it's wrong
I'm not
and because *pages of pages to report why the bullet was shot*
because *a shard of a bullet might hit the suspect and kill it*
here it is so strict that even military police is shitscared of shooting a suspect tires to stop him
government has to care about the police system
there is a reason if by law you have to make it pass
it's an ambulance, use your damn heads
really?
for fuck sake
```Passed in 2000, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is today a primary source of EU law at the same level as the EU treaties. The Charter's article 21 prohibits any kind of discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation.

The signatories call on the European Commission to "use all tools at its disposal to ensure full respect of EU law, including by referring the matter to the [European Court of Justice]".```

it's a paradox
imagine if i were an accountant, compiled the company annual budget, then forgot the papers into the bus
it's highly unprofessional
even if it's not top secret
Anyways what happened is still not a good thing
and i speak as a person who is entirely cool with sleeping in public transport.
so it's entirely possible
and i was about to forget my smartphone once but i quickly noticed i didn't pick it up
in the train
and an umbrella once
i forgot a cap
oi oi
outrageous
Freaking CCP
they're mandatory in closed spaces
Masks became optional in the open here now
And valk
Yeah this one
try to calm down, do boring stuff
and disgusting

As freeware zip program
7zip is the best shot
but nvm we decided to not talk about this again
doing good? that's another emisphere
keeping it in check sure
means
hah depends on what doing a great job
all over
yes but it's like the obama giving a medal to himself
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/07/eu-urged-suspend-funds-hungary-breaches-rule-of-law-viktor-orban
it was bound to happen, i hope that Orban and friends get the message
Oh EU just suspended Hungary Recovery Fund
My mom had a few lines of fever from first shot (pfizer), second shot only gave her pain in her arm
People, wash your heads, cool down and stop arguing in here.
lol this remembers me how ufotable cafe got an homage in recreators
(which is pretty cool tbh)
ufotable cafe

animation is not their only source of income
yes
responsibilities
since president
it falls on the whole company
yes this is important^
it would be self admitting
with money you didn't declare in first hand
you can't pay your employees legally
and a in the westernized world, any business has to declare every income and expense
since salary is taxed
means you pay taxes for that
paying your employees
pug
pls
but anyways expecting to tax evade and not being noticed in japan
i would let pass a small business not making invoice sometimes
expecially if we talk of big sums
tax evasion is bad
1.047.638,64€
https://www.euronews.com/2021/07/08/broadcaster-tvn-says-polish-government-s-proposed-law-changes-intend-to-silence-us poland please
i just wanted to say this
this means damage
means too much bureaucracy
Lank one note, too much centralized gov
it's their flaw not mine, i'm not saying "look this is far left", but "this is their far left"
but they claim to be far left
don't ask me lank. i don't live there i know part of the picture. For example they're trying to bring up something akin to ubi
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
is far left.
poland current gov
isky
banning non eu media, this is a globalized world, you aren't supposed to do that
Hungary got denied recovery funds
I wonder how much will pass till poland gets punished in Hungarian fashion
Except it doesn't work that way
*coal in 2021*
that same money poland threw into propaganda and coal mines
to help the economy during covid
rip all the money eu gave to poland
russia?
then live off what lank?
like the freedom of speech being suppressed
there is a long list of irregularities
if eu really wants shit flies
LGBT thing is not the only issue here
tho this also means poland gets fined
PiS is just barking because they want the impossible
Nah poland will not leave eu
for scottish independence
here i am still waiting
in the end eu was like "eh oh, let them do whatever"
UK acted like a total clown
as backfire
i'm dead sure that Germany would actively push for heavy trade fees
rip free trade with poland
But anyways, if poland leaves eu
i think that will cause an escalation of eu nations getting really angry
PLN has less value than Tunisian currency
UK had some economical backing to survive, even if the damage is there. Poland is not Superpower
but again
exactly
Lol
because current one is just harming your country imho
i really hope poland changes government
but The rule of the law and law hierarchy can't be overruled just because a random constitutional court decides so
just because it's independent
let's say your gov thinks it can do whatever it wants
eh
It was a matter of time
They can't veto this one
Well so far legal action has been called vs pl and hun
Is the fish still rotting in the containers? But anyways uk is not pl
out of it
they get too many benefits
i don't think poland will benefit leaving EU
The law is the law
Pandemic will ravage them back
Uuuh, wrong time for this
What's happening in sa?
Uh
note taken
didn't know about these 2
wow
they want to avoid new covid spread
Not that it is wrong
It's mainly because how the jp are handling this themselves, not that one can 100% blame them
i get a similar feeling
but this conversation is too light for this channel
then it went downwards slowly
Call of duty has been a good franchise up to Modern Warfare 1
i still find ridiculous to deny the prize to player who worked hard for it, just because he decided to openly state his opinion about HK
that was the major turning point
due to their behaviour
it's becoming one of the worst software houses in gaming industry
the insult was done out in public on twitter
to join ff14
just because he decided to leave the game after 15 years of playing
a famous wow youtuber/streamer
mind you one of their employees insulted
they just go down and down
well blizzard is on a downward slope
no matter how big you can be
International Community > A single country
China must stop this ffs
we should move imho
(except poland, poland is actively giving money to coal industry)
govs are actively pushing electric/hybrid vehicles
and
many producers already stopped making these
by 2030 they will be completely banned
btw so far we are killing Diesel cars
just sayin'
megacorps lie in china/india as well
btw kaiyo, dont' forget
~~Also you ain't eu citizen anymore~~
We do loris
China does what? Refuse to sign the climate pact.
but at least Europe is doing stuff in the right direction
Oh of course
hey kayo numbers at hand, you can-t deny the pollution caused by China, it's disproportionally huge compared to the rest of developed countries, expecially considering half of china, if not more is full rural.
China is happy to pollute the planet to death without even moving one finger
at g20
Are they? India and China are the only ones who refused to sign the Climate pact
we represent majority of human race
the era of Pax Americana as ended, we are not in ww2
If the international community recognizes taiwan as independent, china has no way they can claim any authority
Lank please, don't bring israel into the topic again, that matter is far more complicated than china claiming taiwan
EU is the only part of the world actively fighting climate change, even if not at the most uniform rate (hi poland an hungary)
yeah
the obvious here
you speaking
is crammed into certain areas
but majority of population
is rural
most of china
matter to spell here
Lank there is one important
4 years is nearly the half of 10 years
https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ryszard-Daniel/publication/310749303/figure/fig1/AS:431609288630274@1479915081904/Life-shortening-in-Europe-due-to-air-pollution-by-PM-2000-2020-2.png
no they can't, challenge a bus driver to do a sharp turn
sure it *can be done* but not everywhere
trust me you're oversimplifying this
Lank, not all landscape is fit for standard public transport
were atrocious
my dear god Diesel car emissions in the 90s
i was checking a few weeks ago
promoting public transport i mean
it's not easy as it sounds, because you have to face several problems, infrastructures, timetables and so on
355k inhabitants
on the other way to go to main city
no no, it stated 2 situations
so a total of 3 stops
2 towns are in between
all countryside
28 min
btw doublechecked, train, my town, other town 26 km away
light rail?
so it's not super-easy to strenghten public transport
Italy has one of the oldest building assets of the whole Europe
$, landscape, cityscape
is not easy
making it more efficient
so yeah, i wont take the public transport, it's just not worth unless i have reasons to do so.
anyways 12 km is a bit wrong, it was by car/bus, it's 16 km train ride iirc
you would have to tear down buildings, rob farmers from their land
there's no solution
No you can't make a second
with 1 railway
it's a regional train
huge waste of time
many stops
Big city
GUess what?
25 km away
to go the other way
the same train takes 25 mins
No it's not a bad train
Except lank
I wont take the last option unless it was strictly required
1) Car [15 mins]
2) Train [30 mins]
3) Bus [**50** min]
here to go to the main 355k inhabitants city nearby (12km away) i have 3 options
the question
Lank, you misinterpreted
that public transport brings?
how do you solve the waste of time
plus
and moved
since buildings can't be detatched from the ground
and it's not nearly as often possible
you have to rework the roads
anyways no, traffic doesn't work that way
You talking with a person who went to high school every day for 5 years by train
that means more buses
i know, but the solution is buying the farmland
so for example train has to wait the incoming one at the station
the rest is only one train line per route
are double lined
only last 3 stops
the big city is at the north western end
the whole train line goes 250 km
just look how many stops
don't need to read
i live in the heel of italy
it goes down to the edge of the region
https://www.ferrovie.it/portale/images/articoli/00663101.jpg pardon me the quality of the pic, this is the whole regional train line with every stop, the gray line is the national railway instead
i linked you the actual train
look at that pic
https://www.fotoferrovie.info/albums/userpics/10002/normal_760D1668.jpg
lemem find a pic
they're already small trains
uh
but how is the point
all stations have 2 rails
isky
yes
on the last 2 stops
then it duplicates
single line till the 3rd to last stop
and farmlands
buildings in the way
to duplicate the railway
as i stated, is almost not possible
bus is an hassle 50 min long ride for 12-15 km
2 are in the nearby town
4 of these are in the city
to get to that city there are 6 stops before the end of the line central station
same train but in the other direction
16km 30 mins
a feasible plan
we already had
since no magnetosphere
but we need an artificial solar shield
on mars
if you put like that they are doing the right thing on focusing
i see
anyways
~~in b4 thrusters~~
and only then go down and colonize and terraform
we would have to wait for the surface to cool down
Well if we fix the atmosphere
Moon needs to be a space port, so we don't have to leave atmosphere every time
that's a bit more doable than mars
There's also the Venus Atmospheric restoration plan
50 km is 70 c, 55 is 27c
above 55km on venus
we don't need
oi
hitting the colony
is the chance of stellar debris
major issue is not the popping
``` Proposals also involve either freezing most of Venus's atmospheric CO2, or converting it to carbonates,[19] urea[citation needed] or other forms.```
uh i forgot this
for the floating city
is the gas proposed here
Helium
we can fix the atmosphere
and water
if we pump hydrogen
btw in theory
it was the floating city plan
about the venus atmosphere
making changes in so many ways
just because we are the changer of ways
that western europe is evil
Hell Poland gov even goes as far as saying
Yeah but here we are talking of people upbringing hypertraditionalist values
The Orthodox Church part is one of the factions
We live under the rule of the law, "not caring about regulations" doesn't exist
and legal procedure to punish the countries is underway
thus eu got angry
I know right?
They also desist from removing these anti lgbt laws on request of eu
Eh...
I can't believe this hate speech in 2021 really
...
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/310094405728206850/869341208617574430/FB_IMG_1627337488294.jpg
Hungary seriously, it's getting ridiculous. It's inhumane and against eu regulations.
that's why you do it with people you feel close enough to
look at the channel rady, no pun this time
are so damn rad
also offline meetings with online friends
you close up the last chain basically
Online people can be the same as irl really. But it does complete down the moment you get to meet these in person
I mean, for example, i have a private discord with some online friends, i've met some of these online 8+ years ago, and i've met them irl (some of them)
It depends on me, i have a little group of friends irl which i'm close to, but i also have a group of friends i'm close to online
it's the distance
Gh china shenanigans again
this is worse than breaking eu regulations
oh my
Atlantic Treaty?
then
USA
that will piss off
this smells like a race of "let's piss EU council, faster, better, stronger"
poland is already under legal procedure for heavy sanction
that will send many gears haywire again
btw
the censorship law is against EU regulations
Normal cycle would require ANY law to be **revised and modified** when rejected
on some higher levels
that sounds so scummy
pis cancelled, revoted, won
i'm having trouble understanding
wtf is happening in poland exactly
Man
i see
ah
moving vote when you lose sounds so bad
iirc
10k€
it's like
at least UK is a rich country so it's not going to default (not yet)
if poland ends up leaving eu (eu could end up kicking poland if the situation continues to breach the regulations on a critical level), the citizens will have such a bad time
it's plunging the poor poland into oblivion
i hope someone stops this political massacre
btw that led them to win by the few missing votes
ty rady
or before
yeah i couldn't remember if it was during covid
so it's not illegal once, but twice
goes against a treaty signed in 1994
issue is that this law, other than being passed with a fraud
it's one of the list of the things that they've been brooding
or 2019
in poland?
elected in 2020
uh, was the new gov
it's outrageous
i can't believe that's happening in a country that should follow the rule of the law
kat what you saw
rady describe
during the revote
That was yesterday
this is outside any realm of decency
really?
https://twitter.com/GborFerencKirl1/status/1425693376855281665
<@!203444794737950720> <@!174272493777977344>
that's pure terror
Lol
most right wing influential person in italy
he's like 85.
and he's gunning for the head of state
been PM TWICE
the man who makes laws from himself and got many medals from Putin
*closely related to Silvio Berlusconi*
AGAIN
LOL
rip polonia1
will ever dream to be
it's closely connected to a man far more richer than Trump
this explains it
connected to Silvio Berlusconi
Ah i see
Oh lol
prob not
in Poland?
which is a no-no in 2021
they're acting like globalization doesn't exist
it's outrageous
sends blood boiling to my head
every damn thing that i hear from PiS
really, i need to be honest here
the rest wont follow
if scotland doesn-t bail out
Scotland will go first
is it tho? i think PiS will use this as propaganda to say that the west is corrupt
Oh yes please, do it, the rule of the law is first and foremost, no one will invest in poland anymore at this rate
this is really important
not all communities are the same
i've been here since AXZ ended, i've seen many users come and leave
This is basically the only public server i check more than once a day, mostly for the bonds i have formed with people, it's a bit rare to find places like this one.
Saint words
then of course when EU gets mad and starts the legal process to sue them, PiS: "The wEsT is EvIL!1!"
x_x
everyone: solar panels and friends
poland: MOAR COAL POWER
but no
the sad thing is that eu encourages to spend funds on renewable energy
oh yeah
poland is in a sorry state lank, they're draining money out of the populace/eu recovery funds to use them on propaganda/bribes/coal mines
of course rady, i know that far
do you confirm this?
4% more expensive
want a new pc?
<@!174272493777977344> <@!203444794737950720> this sounds so bad, new tax of electronics in poland
it's that the government is using cheap goods to measure it
it's higher
is kinda fake
kat 5% inflation in poland
that money ends up in the trash can
the issue is when the welfare becomes so much
Welfare is not an option in nowadays society, we need it
wrong channel
rady pls
Forreal kat? Lmao
Pls don't kat. Everyone needs to know
Whew
That's a lot
It's 1500€ here
Wtf
What, where
ah i see
i'm not /s lol
math.
since we can effectively measure distance by time.
that's a thing the whole world does i think
4chan > taliban
Did you guys hear about the infamous  "Lord Miles" succeeding to escape Afganistan thanks to 4chan intel gathering?
It's convulted but yeah, they didn't break any rules om twitter
I agree with melua
lol what
freaking propaganda
```right now on pis tv
headline bar taking up 20% of the screen
"amazing condition of polish economy"
```
<@!174272493777977344> is this true?
redditwars
lmao
that's gaslighting
but but
oh dear lol
he's a strong personality
oh that's for sure
"midget empire"
or how my other polish friend calls the guy in charge
pis is tryharding to ruin the market
my condolences then
grey zone? also are you an enterpreteneur?
it's ridiculous

i will hold back joking about that but that's hilarious
o-okay
yeah
humanity.jpg
neopagan stuff that draws inspiration from Thelemic theories from Aleister Crowley (1904)
they used the term of "Magick"
i was noticing
what- really? lol
It's against gdpr
Can't be allowed in eu
That apple thing
like greece is refusing migrants
and blocking it off
some eu countries are resisting this wave coming from afganistan
fp
poland debt went up 33% on the 2 latest years
<@!174272493777977344> it seems eu numbers are out
the bot fetches from their services, so... it's in their right to try to shut it down
youtube is google's
as long as i dislike losing a music bot
tbh about the groovy thing
This is what the opposition exists for tbh
Well that was the right thing to do for once
Rip pis
Lmao for real
"The elites" know if that people end up on the street they will have less clients
It's not a thing of the elites, it's the united states playing it weirdly
eviction is allowed again now
So supreme court ends Biden's Eviction Suspension
Moratorium = Suspension
Depends on where we live, we had to skip our biggest event (which is the 2nd/3rd biggest of the world) coz of pandemic. Local minor ones also got skipped, probably next ones will require green pass (i live in eu)
germany got angry
they broke EU laws
Hungary and Poland are under legal procedures btw
they cover eachother backs
Hungary and Poland go in pair
"buh the west is evil"
it's just corrupt
Pis costantly declares itself left winged "wanting to restore the old commie days"
Poland right wing?
uh
btw radical wings do not have future in europe in general, external influences are too strong
btw the english pound is still too strong to get a collapse
into me discussing of the weimar republic
lol that flashbacks
say hello to duda rady lol
UK will get the major hit if scotland finally detatches
US is a weird case, again
UK is in the process of potentially losing the pieces
I don't find the connection between a change, which we got in this 40 years span, and the higher ups keeping things in safe
we are evolving our society in a way we didn't centuries before
think of it, how different is the world since the 80s?
more people can live normally, more people can buy things, so the economy restarts
we are evolving as society
a system where evicted and jobless people are left on the streets it's just wrong and outdated
for example good thing is a welfare that allows the poor to live under a roof
and some things must be a given
this is why i think welfare is a necessity
i don't play the morality game on this take, ofc it's bad for those too, but you know what you leave, you don't know what you get
history.
when the change is radical, people die.
Change doesn't happen out of the blue, it's a slow process
but a government can only tank the issue so much, the gear has to be set back and running
the gov tanked it
but that means, someone has to pay these people
businesses weren't allowed to fire anyone
for 2 years straight basically
until... june was it?
Here in italy, we had suspension of layoffs
it was a miracle that it was conceded in the US in the first place
but USA is based on a really capitalistic system
Oh i agree on that
the pay between the 60% of it to the 110%
literally
here the gov is actively paying the populace to install electric columns for electric cars
fp
it's incredible
in any context
Japan always plays the weird kid
Volvo doesn't make em anymore
since diesel cars are going out of commission
Car industry is in the process of renovation
China is going to get a full slap by a demographic crisis in the next generation
again Oil will stop being so important
in the future
btw yeah i don't see the middle east becoming a thing in global economy
on that front
it's eastern EU refusing to work
Meh, it's just that the EU is not one engine
working with NATO
EU is giving aid to afganistan rn
with Oil stopping to fuel some economies
i don't know about that
Eh
on what base are you saying this?
that's not true?
Confederation would be also nice but it's a bit utopic rn
we can't compete on a global scale without the union
Opinions, i still believe that the future lies into strenghtening the union
but in those who grew them like that
i would not place fault in the youths themselves
this can implode in many ways
<@!174272493777977344> numbers are out poland inflation 5.4%, but interest rates are forcibly kept at 0,1%
That's absolutely also true
and the acceptance starts from there
it always comes first.
but that also has to do with the concept of family in italy
here
that high rate also explains laws going in trans favour in the latest years
stay strong wolfsbane
if not we are just going to live 1984
here you need one to access someone's privacy
it's the same as police entering your house, come on
is behind a judge's warrant
the only time this thing could be legit
look
that's a dystopia.
someone should tell AUS, we are not supposed to get inspiration from 1984
rip esports confirmed
seem like online games
okay googling
it doesn-t seem so mel
ridiculous
it's
Pis tv intensifies
Propaganda expectations: EU bad, let's leave eu
<@!174272493777977344> EU blocked money to Poland
rip
Suez, AGAIN?!
this also means the stars age slower
cool shit
Every day is a new low™️
tbh
to show their bullshit
China never fails
at the end lmao
it's a missing dot
ah it wasn't a dead link
i also agree it can be popcorn time
well if you say it that way
this would have been a bomb in that sector
```Google v. Oracle had been a closely watched case by the tech industry, as a ruling favoring Oracle could have had significant effects on past and future software development, given the prolific use of APIs.[83] Opponents of the federal court's ruling, including Google and other developers of Android-based software, had raised several concerns including the impact on interoperability, software innovation and the potential for bad actors to pick up the rights to old software and file claims against companies who built their software on what were assumed to be open standards. If this ruling was allowed to stand, it was believed that companies will be forced to implement deliberately incompatible standards to protect themselves from the risk of complex litigation, moving away from the current trends in software development which have focused on improving interoperability between different services allowing apps to communicate with one another, creating more integrated platforms for end users.```
we risked to have APIs under copyright
<@!278860841485598720> a proof that intercorporate war is not always good as you might think
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.
first time i hear that
wt rady
bet on it.
Epic will stop into giving free goodies once they got what they want
You sure they did?
but hey again, each it's own, you're free to think however you want.
who pays for these is the consumer
intercorporate wars are not a pretty thing
it's not, that's how we get into weird dystopias
Well what can i say? opinions? Defamation is never right.
I'm strongly against such petty methods
Apple won legally iirc
While i don't think that Apple policies are correct (on the opposite, i'm against them), the way Epic acted is absolutely childish and immature, the moment they posted the infamous video they fell into the wrong. This is my absolute take on this. You don't like my "walled garden"? Okay good, stay away from it. 
Epic acts in similar ways in other situations, BUT THEN they're the first and foremost hypocrites imposing a timed exclusive on their store.
Regarding youtube bringing down rythm, this time I don't think that the bot was in the right, they kinda fucked up. And lol i saw someone mentioning the clownfiesta between apple and epic, sorry to say but epic was being completely wrong, the platform is theirs, and they can enforce whatever rules they want (without breaking the law) no matter how much moneygrabbing is involved. Moreover epic had no right to publically insult them like they did, it's defamation.
Stuff is used for different aims currently tho
x_x
Uh they're still doing the filing teeth?
if you must, solve in dm
cool down
it's not an arena
"muh we lost money from eu"

<@!174272493777977344> Pis pushing propaganda anti eu
this is eu
wont work
Lowering age of consent
i agree with mel
Yeah
yeah sometimes things are too much sexualized and they just look weird
That reminds me of the "Bikini Armor" thing
Yeah absolutely
this reminds me takeuchi and his shenanigans
That's an important mindset
and other stuff
depends on the context
i find wearing masks cumbersome personally
If you really had to go out mask or get fined
They were during lockdown
They're mandatory in closed areas, like shops, churches and so on
Or even may
Btw regarding the masks they're not mandatory in open spaces since june here
My condolences
https://puu.sh/Iegwz/3535e9654a.png
but yeah here pretty much everything is going back to normal, we got 3k new cases and it's going down
but if i have to wear it i wont make a fuss
Mask can be removed only if you're already sitting down at the restaurant
Uh that sounds like it doesn't make sense. But us is us i guess. Here you need green pass (our vax certificate) to enter any enclosed shop
with Diesel cars
is that you can't enter major cities
What we have done here instead
uk *coughs*
lank that just doesn't work
meh
wouldn't*
I wont toll normal roads tho
infact when a whole fucking bridge fell for poor maintenance in genova, oh boy the heads were prosecuted into hell
to go on it
you pay a toll
lel funfact Highway is private here instead
i'm more a fan of giving leeway to private enterpreteneurs but with the hand of government to regulate/interfer where needed
which i dislike
Murica is an extreme model
need an ambulance? sure that's only 50€ ticket and you can pay when you can
here in italy we are heavily taxed on many fronts but we are also blessed that our welfare is huge to the point we waste it
but yeah
so let's pass on
but whatever, that would just turn into the usual discussion on which we will never agree on
i don't agree with lank
but again, you don't send your progeny to private education if you can't afford it
13k€/semester
private uni
Then of course we have
and it can't go higher
tho over a certain income (100k€/y) it hits a grand maximum of about 1800-2000€/semester
it's calculated over wealth
here a public university can go down to 300€/400€ for a semester if you're poor
Lol
to not need such things
are already wealthy enough
and those who go to private schools and uni
go to public uni
but anyways it might be because majority of the people
fucked up way of thinking
right?
to pay studies?
it's a loan taken from a bank
Just to clarify
such thing is next to non existant here
is so alien to me
man the concept of student loan
fixed first sentence
going in that direction
it's the european way
and also i'm fairly sure that it's not only our country
of course, it's a chain effect. i never pretended to say "coz italy limits it, you can't make cars"
but it's the safest way to stay with the feet on the ground
what can i say
in making diesel cars
are actually stopping
because the huge car makers
except that is working
but about procedualism, it's how i think, nothing more nothing less
i can only hands up
well if you put it that way
but it's hardly achievable
i don't think your ideal is wrong
you enforce it, someone will fight to his bone to abolish it
it wont work
doesn't agree
lank if the society
organized crime will also want some cake in the public transport fresh new deal
except it is not enough
then they taxed raw tobacco more
it didn't change anything
instead of cigs
led to people buy raw tobacco
tobacco being higher priced here
and just drive
would still pay the toll
90% of the people
no.
did it work?
tobacco
to discourage usage?
you know what was more heavily taxed
to note about your toll idea
btw i have one thing
it's not a magic box
€
the first 2 issues
it still doesn't solve
it doesn't mean it's free real estate
just because you see an open field
Yes
i think you're being too much idealistic here
more buses? €
more trains? € (+ more railways €)
more space? wait how where?
which is not always possible
the public transport
you need to strenghten
we talked about this
plus now that i think of it
normal metropolitan city more or less manages to work
in megalopolises
Look lank, car traffic is a thing in really huge cities
local police, state police, mp
3 police forces
we got enough enforcement to do that
it just happened
no one stopped you
some months after
in your mail
fine
and thus you get a pretty
you step on psychological warfare
the pressure is different
fining is a sudden death behind the corner-.
tolling is constant
**fines**
it's easy
heh lank
you get fined if you break it
only hybrid/methane
neither gasoline
for example i had 2 friends, one in real one online in my discord. i knew them for years, but i nearly completely lost contact with them just because they found somewhere else to loiter around and have fun and deem this new place funnier than mine.
pure ones are the long lasting ones usually
About close friendships well... you can't do much, friendships in general have many colors, there are pure ones, ones born out of interest sharing and so on
Oh as a person who managed his private  first teamspeak then discord server for a grand total of 11 years, i can safely say that humans are weird.

It's perfectly normal to have such feelings towards people, expecially old friends. Because of this i've seen people go and come. I've even joined flame wars with people (i'm not a person who insults but i've had my share of issues with people).
I think what you're feeling there it's normal, expecially if the circle widens. I can only suggest to not brood too much about it, sure it can hurt, but you can't warp people minds.
i think the emissions problem is the major one
has its own priorities
hey each one
internet?
poland wants to tax
<@!174272493777977344> wtf
i.e olympics
the more i look at the picture, the more it seems like a giant child whining about the other kids rightfully telling the teacher he's being mean
i do smell some show of force in response to murica submarines
speaking of china, man what they're doing over taiwan it's outrageous
also new retirements due to old age
it's a really long term damage that wont get fixed just by incentives
thus firing the women that do
Employers often don't allow women to do so
plus
current generation is not used to growing up more than 1 child
hard grip on population growth?
not the decision* mb, but by the trend
vibe from the decision
i feel some "muh gay couple can't make childs"
Also remember that china is about to get slapped by demographic crisis and they know it
yeah
tbh screw their gov and their shenanigans. I will always dislike prohibitionism.
tf
thus we tax it more
it's too low
https://biznes-wprost-pl.translate.goog/technologie/internet/10495399/janusz-cieszynski-rzad-rozwaza-wprowadzenie-taryf-na-internet.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui
on top of the vat
basically polish government wants to double up on internet tax
rady it has happened not more than 3 times
Usually?
on the double??
the big giant blob will start crumbling on itself
china
touches
because if SK westernization
NK is just merely a cushion state
freaking kid who thinks he's playing a grand strategy game
trying something in the middle of chaos
of kim
plus there's a probablity
anymore
it's not JSDF alone
and reminder that japan reinstated attack forces
murica wont compromise shit
and upscale drastically
it will go all out
Yeah but if taiwan gets even scratched
goddamn china doesn't know its place
it's bad
too quick
this is escalating
??????????
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-04/taiwan-preparing-for-war-with-china/100511294
because of this
for Shares to plummet
Can't wait
lowkey yes
i-m no physic student
https://impact.ese.ic.ac.uk/ImpactEarth/ImpactEffects/
uuuh
```40 metre tungsten rod, 1cm diameter, going at 0.1c. That’s more feasible.

The volume of a 40metre x 1cm diameter rod is pi * r^2 *h, so pi * 0.5^2 * 4000 = 3141.6 cm^3

The density of tungsten is 19.3g per cm^3

So, the mass of our rod is 60,632g. Let’s say that’s 60kg

0.1c is 29,979,246 m/s (that’s 67,000,000 mph)

So, the kinetic energy of our rod is: 1/2 * m * v^2

So, that’s 0.5 * 60 * 29,979,246^2. That comes out at about 27 x 10^15 Joules. That’s 27 petajoules```
us b53 nuke is 38 petajoules
can produce 27 petajoules
claiming that a 40mt long tungsten rod
i found some calculations
Some systems are quoted as having the yield of a small tactical nuclear bomb.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment
the jew thing is another issue entirely, money was involved thus hitler took the opportunity
lol
then complain to wikipedia
a rod from god is the equivalent of a small tactical nuke
in one shot
isky
new york
one of these can obliterate
remember, we learnt the danger of nuclear weaponry and we keep it stowed, we learnt that all out wars are not good thus majority of the world is living the longest period of peace ever existed
it was a good enough lesson
nah
Sure
because humans always find a solution to tribulations
i don't buy onto these theories
btw computer
missing a target with these is **bad**
that will get even more messy
nevis
stops orbital bombardment
from nuking eachother
stopping countries
the same piece of paper
if we really want to fuck the situation badly, an eventual "trumpoid" would just send up some pretty tungsten rods and start playing god by threatening other countries
barren land profits no one
nowadays wars are ruled out on the table
remember that humans do what they think is profitable
but things will get messy
btw i doubt ww3 as well
passively
that-s why i quoted "trumpoid"
rn no, i agree with you
+
right now there's a shortage in the offer
but surely it wont stay high as it is
Oh well, yeah by bad wording
automatically
you get twitch prime
if you have amazon prime
lily just think of it
since it-s a silicon shortage
then prices should start going normal by the start of 2023
if china does chill out a bit
Depends if china goes to war
this is something that will last till end of 2022
any decent gpu rn is out of normal price
let the 3090s aside
yeah
is straight up outrageous
tbh the fact that such thing happened
Rip to the countless graphic cards that went up in flames
but buying a gpu wont cost a kidney anymore at least
of course it wont go back to prepandemic
which if gets solved, it will cause a lowering of prices
so i will abstain
i would use improper words for this server to describe such way of action
because it's fun?
is to anger germany
or their game
what do they want to obtain?
Pis is barking at nothing
it's outlawed.
There is no buts
```This means that the Treaty has superior legal value, in the same way as a Constitution does: just as the different organs of government in any State have to comply with the national Constitution, so the Member States and the Community institutions are obliged to comply with the rules of the Treaty.```
more than lawfully wrong
stating that their constitution is superior to eu treaties is outrageous
bruh poland is walking on the razor's edge, their judges should study law a bit more
so yeah the requirement bar was forcelifted by iso editing
didn't specify WHY it would not install
but microsoft idiocy in making the installer
if you don't respect it
This is a security requirement that was bypassed like nothing since it's not like stuff will break
TPM V2
Ah yes rady quoted it
give me a min
one of them is unknown to the normal user
to install w11
There are some hard requirements
ISO editing
the requirement lock was erased by the community on day3.
Do remember that when the first test build of w11 was released
Can we have one single day without ccp doing evil things?
Take care
Disk Encryption is also under TPM
but W11 wont break if its outdated iirc
windows uses it.
So yes
Other uses and concerns
Any application can use a TPM chip for:

Digital rights management (DRM)
Windows Defender
Windows Domain logon[16]
Protection and enforcement of software licenses
Prevention of cheating in online games[17]
on the mother board
it's an hardware component
Trusted Platform Module provides

A hardware random number generator[4][5]
Facilities for the secure generation of cryptographic keys for limited uses.
Remote attestation: Creates a nearly unforgeable hash key summary of the hardware and software configuration. The software in charge of hashing the configuration data determines the extent of the summary. This allows a third party to verify that the software has not been changed.
Binding: Encrypts data using the TPM bind key, a unique RSA key descended from a storage key[clarification needed].[6]
Sealing: Similar to binding, but in addition, specifies the TPM state[7] for the data to be decrypted (unsealed).[8]
Other Trusted Computing functions for the data to be decrypted (unsealed).[9]
from wikipedia
lemme copypaste
No rady, there's a reason for TPM existence
on day 3
check the sender, it's important
and not actually pishing?
were from twitter support
Yumi, are you **absolutely sure** all the emails

Changing password should have forced a logout

the email has a different pass
hm
don't have your *email* password?

what

i caught one on the act lmao
but managed to fend stuff off
i know how the adrenaline shoots into the sky
people tried to hijack my stuff
np
eh
now i don't use twitter, i can't say more
a flaw into Twitter's 2FA leaving a way to hijack accounts
It seems it was reported
if something else happens contact support
well keep it under your radar
ok
let's say that the constituion vs treaty deal is more important
ursula basically roasted poland recent behaviour on all front and pis tv censored the roasting
also rip Jack angel
<@!203444794737950720> give me your opinion on what happened
and launched their own experts commentary
<@!174272493777977344> Pis tv muted audio after vatman speech
https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_5361
important question
^
the ammo is the true issue at the core
with the prop being real
I don't have issues
let's hope the prosecution doesn't go into weird directions for him
and poor baldwin
yeah rip the person who got shot
but that: 1) it's not how it works; 2) it's monkey-tier to adress only the girls
I mean sure, you should dress properly at school since it's a formal place
i can't believe such thing in a supposedly westernized country in 2021
it's ridiculous
........................
The shit??????
what do you mean yumi?
yes
they're free to disagree with me of course
on how i see that situation
i was just giving my take to das
I guess we would talk for hours of this stuff and not end up in agreement (or agree, who knows).
so we can apply that one.
there is the correct way we *believe*
or a situation
there is not a correct way to handle someone
are highly subjective
Look i think that interpersonal relationships
let's say that a cheater is an extreme case
it depends on several factors
but anyways
for the notice, the case i presented ended up well, we did make up without any issue and we are still friends. it was nothing major but a bit uncomfortable.
"ah this is how much you value the friendship?"
i would be highly disappointed depending on the person
but for instance if i apologized and the person who i wronged didn't let me any room
the example i made was written at 3 am, sorry i was sleepy. Of course i apologized lol
ah i tought that was a given
and someday i will surely be wrong in a context
since humans are mostly always wrong
but i'm not fully a fan of "Not giving second chances"
and of course this depends on the degree of friendship
but in any kind of relationship
but that's not only in a friendship relationship
of course a common ground must be found
is it a counterpoint tho? it's just a case where the person doesn't want to reconcile, i was implying that at least one of the two parts was willing to set a stone onto the fire.
I did say something that i shouldn't have said to a dear friend of mine without thinking and i feel i hurt her. I feel bad when i think of it but other than trying to be goodwilled in her regards... What can i do? I can shrug and bringing it up would just be awkward so i prefer to let it pass under the bridge
Time will heal
Well i can understand that
But there is a saying that says "being wrong is humane, to persevere is evil"
Humans are imperfect and thus make and do wrong things
Want me to give an honest take? While you might have wronged your friend, true friendships do not end there. If your friend is not interested into trying again... Well then it was not worth the hassle.
but they're not without light windows
dark moments are in everybody's life
Stay strong yumi
not knowing what is happening
The true sad part is that majority of the population is in the shadows
instead of sanctioning they just halted € support
lol
and this is official
Ontop, EU not giving them free money is a punishment because they're acting against regulations
after censuring Ursula's speech they wanted to widen the circus
apparently the roasting wasn't enough
facepalm poland
https://www.rt.com/news/538387-warsaw-eu-covid-loans-dispute/
i'm not senile yet rady
no one said you're accusing me lel
more than most things
no rady, it's something that easily breaks my patience meter
for example i really hate being labeled as a liar if i didn't lie
as i said it's also subjective
i'm sorry to hear that
err
ah well
i don't know what your cousin did, nor i wont ask (i respect your privacy dw). But i can understand if it's an outrageous thing you can't forgive
i do have a friend who wronged me several times, but at the third chance i went mad and sent him to hell. I don't think i will forgive him, but i don't have issues to talking him casually.
have a good day
if i did i wouldn't have tagged
i didn't notice your nickname
i'm sorry
AH
err has a desert in the middle*
of the desert
aus is in the middle
said the news
aus is dropping carbon
hmmm
it's 2021, the rule of the law is absolute, no one should even think to object it
since coal
add to this 0.5m/day
and this time it's the European Court of Justice involved
i foresaw this 2 years ago
this was to be expected
boom.

If this continues
I mean at some point poland will default
but yeah i feel sorry for the citizens, but as an europeist... this feels like some lowkey retribution
i feel sorry for poland citizens
how can i put it?
for the citizens
it's gonna look at its worst
and if the worst happens, such as being poland kicked out from eu/left eu
pis has to be removed from power
i agree
at 5.6
i was left
holy cow
7%???
like did with greece
and eu buying its assets
is poland going into default
btw what i foresee
ah that's for sure
then no, nato would interfer probably
in NATO?
is poland
i see
if poland leaves eu
that pis dies
btw why do you say
they muted the hardcore roasting
it's the correct one
"did you know"
well it was a backhanded question
in pis tv?
and muted
speech being censored
did you watch Ursula
i'm confused rn, i will check it later
you know nevis
it's mixed sovereignity @vatican
ok ok
but
there is terrirorial sovereignity
with san marino
i confused vatican
btw nvm
or better, remember
just imagine on how christianity and islam spawned into the world
in history
and this is also really deeply rooted
yeah i agree with solo
the ground beneath their feet is 100% italian
they don't.
it doesn't have independence on the soil maria
it's an extraterritoriality
it depends on how human use these concepts
on their own
now we aren't in the 1000s where the catholic church had a freaking country to manage
But he is also human
as such he must interpret and give out the teachings
He is supposed to be the topmost spiritual guidance
To be honest? yes
and he is someone who seem to really believe in his own beliefs
but let's not forget he is just the person at the top of the catholic hierarchy
they tried everything they could in their power to not let him become pope
is a reformist pope
Pope Francis
and thus cultural behaviours
it's also something deeply rooted in history
yes and no
it's just how much importance you give to your religion
or ignore liturgical ceremonies altogether
Christianity has many colors, in every aspect. Even people who believe but don't think they should go to church
that's a big error
Lank you're making "Christians" one straw of people
Yeah people, do not leave it as dry vent, we should try to discuss about matters. I have similar issues with my brother but i came here to ask for counsel when i did.
putting terminals into a office/warehouse
wtf
<@!174272493777977344> mandatory payment terminal for every building owned by a store
for enterpreteneurs
taxes
they also put more
ty
ah right
stuff will pile up overtime
now add 1m/day for the pis fuckery
eu already gives *thrice* the amount of money that receives from poland
how are we taking these money? by not giving them more
is 0,5m/day
for the coal deal
current fining
and hug their coal
poland got fined because they refuse to follow the trend of switching
both for privates and businesses
to switch to green alternatives
EU gives out money in solid €
such work is already underway
no matter how crooked it may be
US just with biden has shown interest into the matter
we don't have that luxury to shrug it off
but china statement is just bad
effort into fighting pollution
At least EU does invest some
stating that overseas corps do have a factory there doesn't mean you can't enforce laws to reduce emissions
china and india refusing to reduce emissions
but holy hell
good stuff has come out
recent news about climate conference
I've been following
slow down things.
sure some countries refusing
we are proceeding at "our society pace" any faster would be... how can i explain this, unfeasible for how much our society has progressed
hey it's not like we aren't doing anything. If you compare nowadays air to 2000s it's much more cleaner
and we both know how bad is completely anarchic free market
because the side effect is incontrolled market
you go up on the same reason
but still if you think on it
on valve side
it's marketing reason
ye i know

epic games ceo
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Sweeney_(game_developer)
Timmy = Epic games
do they realize it's gonna end badly?
Sega, Ea, ubi and Timmy supporting NFTs?
so what do we have now
...
is valve the only one sane in the head understanding that it is flat out bad?
No come on EA ALSO?
good
i'm also curious
good question
Damn antivaxers
Outplayed
Oof
regularization is needed
the important thing is finding a method to coerce declaration
maybe 8-9k but doesn't change mu h
5k would be too low
as you might think
10k is not that high
means getting them taxed
because having to report nft
this is a good thing
Thank you mel
infact i find insane of game houses (EA, ubi ~~and epic~~) thinking it's the future
it's a bubble
NFTs will implode at some point
because Mafia
we fought of money laundering for DECADES
THIS
^
(i'm not mocking you, i find it hard to describe)
and Fungible Token
(NFT)
but wikipedia can explain to you the difference between Non Fungible Token
It's hard to describe
it's not even something that can be claimed "capitalistic". It's just dumb. Normal Cryptocurrencies (fungible) are another story, but NFT? it's hard even to make up a reason.
imagine having to pay thousands for an NFT when you can commission your fav artist
eh
also the 10k$ thing is 5k€ in italy
since money transaction will be still bank directed
on some extent
then it will be traceable
btw if the NFT generation will progress in this way
to nft a freaking jpeg
now imagine how wise is wasting electricity
i highly doubt
NFT is the most ridiculous type of cryptotoken, change my mind.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
yeah but they're not Ethereum so
fungibile crypto is different
On NFT? other than empty money none
and he comes out ripping his hair trying to fight a loophole
these are exactly the cases where you get some gaudy looking attorney fight into big court
you know
well it's nothing special, laws are always behind
I think that laws need to catch up on the subject, or we need some high court sentencies (like EU court of justice) to regulate this case
You know this is complicated
Ask that to epic
True
I think that steamworks is developed enough to do that
Steam allows you to get, trade, manage and sell items
Isky
Wait explain isly
Ah
Hm?
Like steam does
Or a market server
Ignoring the game server is just wrong
I remember that sad case of a girl artist dying and her brother finding out that randoms created nfts on her art without consent after her death
Yeah...
It is not, but legally this is going to become a clusterfuck quickly if politicians wait too much to legiferate
Do not forget timmy from epic enabling blockchain just because valve said no
it's fine
look leave it be
You answered by yourself
just because you think that something is X it doesn't mean it's actually X
and inferences are bad.
that you can fall prey to inferences if you think that your opinion is absolute
with this i means
Opinions are just opinion
hmmm
Opinions are opinable?
i was giving my 2 cents
"That's just your opinion"
and to the person who told you that
you need to add objectivity to the opinion. of course depends on the situation
because it's directly connected to: Opinions are opinable
watch out with that take
Hm matt
in general
but it is ridiculous if no inquisition is done to the company
well then
it has such reputation?
well...
but if the policy gave some directives about this and the employee made a mistake in his work
In that case i would fully agree with you
of course if the policy mishandles items by default, that's another story. But i don't do laws in the US so i hands up
so i'm sorry depending on the cirmstances the fault lies with the ones who mishandled the chair
it's just surreal
i tend to doubt that they broke every chair
The people responsible are the ones who broke the chair
get prosecuted
i hope the responsible people
That would push modding as well
https://puu.sh/Io31t/1ae5fbd0af.png 10 years historical gold data
Diamonds are also like this but it's harder to sell diamonds
since gold only gets pricier, never truly falls (if it falls, it's never permanently, in the long run it pays off)
buying pure gold (ingots) is ultra safe
Shares are a thing, government bonds are safe depending on the country which emits them
and the other way around
you can go 100 to 1 real quick
Cryptocurrencies are an huge gamble
there are other means
if you want to invest
btw okay
Yeah this just needs context
There is a lasting resilient anti vax movement
80+% of the pop got vaxxed
Costs 20-25€
Here covid test
I hope so
that's pretty extreme, wow
News just said that Singapore will start stopping to give free access to NHS to those who don't get vaccinated
that dark web is interested
let's say
™️
miners are interested
don't forget
at least regarding eu, governments care too much to let ancap be a thing
again buy gold, buy gov bonds, buy shares
smart thing is to turn it into regular investment
to pile up money like that
but it's not a good idea
which it's a bit better
instead of GPUs
as mining devices
of using high end cpus now
btw i have seen a rising trend
rip cryptos
it's not like he is a cartel drug lord
did he pay these who work for him?
i don't see exploiting as long as he paid these people
he still rose to success by investing correctly. Means can be people, nothing wrong with that.
in "civilized world"
gives out money to startups
this is why welfare
in b4 nobel for doing weird shit with NFTs
goddamn NFT
lel
with brexit
and uk completely failed at existing
one of the reasons why i strongly believe that eu can survive only if it becomes more one
but in the longg run i'ts a lot
not in the short run
each day that passes poland loses 1,5m€ ™️
so they can stop murdering poland
kat, PiS death when?
lel
that's fucked up
social democrats are just centre left
this is italian parliament rn
so yeah 1 centre left, 1 centre right, 2 right, 1 colourless populist party
but italy is pretty much all pro-eu, all parties understand we get too many benefits from even beginning to question eu
Lega is pro-eu currently
ye
moreover that party is europeist now
when salvini rose to power
they dropped their independence purpose
Lega Nord is not called that way anymore
nah we have this big centre left party from one side, a failed populist party without color that it's on the verge of its death, then a coalition of 3 right winged parties
like 30 years ago
we dropped "christian" political parties
the rest is all right
the only left party is a centre left  one
"communist party" can't even go over the bar of 2,5% (or was it 3%?) to enter parliament
"pure left" party completely died out in italy
You sure? he eats like a pig and smokes a lot
after the fat north korean kid dies?
btw what do you guys think will happen
no "european citizen" stamp on their id card
brits ain't european anymore
Lel
it is stalled
it didn't drop
eu doesn't approve that situation
they wont join anything
but yeah if israel doesn-t get their shit together with palestine
```A 2004 opinion poll showed that 85% of Israelis would support an application for membership.[65] Another survey in 2011 showed support for EU membership is 81%.[66]

```
last note btw <@!209700602828029953> 
https://puu.sh/IoX9H/08bee00015.png
x_x
and just resell them.
fun how iran buys these missiles
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD
also israel is part of this
```The Israeli government has hinted several times that an EU membership bid is a possibility, but the EU itself proposes instead the closest possible integration "just short of full membership."```
btw <@!209700602828029953> quoting from wikipedia
neither israel, neither palestine can remove the other
EU stance is that both must coexist
or partially
was their fault
entire 2011 economical crackdown
lmao
Greece situation was a clownfiesta
matches 99% of the requisites
Israel on the other side
they can't join
Turkey has death penality
No
Keep in mind israel could be an EU member rn, but we ain't touching that in the current situation
to act
by giving them blank paper
was trump
what escalated israeli problem
Lol
i missed this
lol what
Better fund Coal Mines ™️
bb later
gotta do stuff now
but i can't discuss them now sry
i have my doubts on your statement
except fuwafuwa, last time i checked tunisian currency had more power than zloty
of downsides.
yeah lank i agree with you but there is an equal quantity
^
you know who i am referring to
mb
his friends*
yes but it's letting duda do what he wants and stamping lots of it
valued 4+ times less than €
it has PLN
nop it doesn't
freaking zloty
things would have gone differently
had €
i think that if poland
yeah i agree kat
in the € zone
LOTS of money
EU gives out
they protected us from barbarians! ™️
the alps!
^
then you discover that french nuclear plants are on the italian borders
going boom
has ptsd from cernobyl
because EVERYONE
btw Nuclear Energy has been avoided in italy
lel
iirc

it's not
we are aiming at cleaner sources
^ we are getting to that
imagine having ONE law for privacy
i can say it's pretty neat
but after studying it
like everyone said shit on our GDPR privacy law
but we are going somewhere at least
Eu surely needs reforms
that's just in recent times
oh that's for sure
wealth of the nations doesn't agree
lank pls
*peeks in* JPY has one thing, Japanese debt is towards... japanese citizens themselves
eu is supposed to cooperate
This is the point
of course eu believed the balance was true
was presented.
False Balance
No that's not true
^
think the same default but without eu
greece was actually saved by it
Greece wasn't ruined by eu
No
fuwa
what one
This smells like some Cyberpunk 2045 dystopia
Now i don't consider Cryptocurrency comparable with automation
in industrial age
btw your answer lies
otherwise we would hinder the progress
Still i am not against automaton, we need it
Who is going to mantain these machines fuwa?
it depends on how is done
Automaton is not to be considered bad
that means one pays taxes over it
Except crypto is now tracked
again italy has only one centre left party
political parties shatter when the "nuke plant" gets brought up
because you hear conflicting opinions on both wings
hmm here it's not a political color issue
coz italians don't want it
but he got shot down
hell when Silvio Berlusconi was in power he tried to make a referendum to get nuclear power up and running
are trying to push to make nuclear plants
but several politicians
are next to our border
france plants
even if
Well as i said yesterday, in our case, italy is fucking scared of cernobyl v2
want some fine wine from italy? 🍷
because we would pollute
in EU
We can't go full industrial
to it
eu gives out 3 times the money it receives from poland
one clear example is poland itself
to its member states
EU gives out crapload of money
No i actually disagree
just one.
in italy
We got only 1 steel mill
yeah exactly
is US lapdog
that France
that doesn't mean anything, without considering
eu wouldn't be eu if was only france and germany
meh i disagree
all suffer
if one suffers
🇪🇺
Enough people, where is my prized European Federation ™️
or you end up with *The atlantropa project* ™️
in spain
btw watch out with wanting industry
Tourism is important yes
Japan is on a daily basis subject to earthquakes
Japan has some reasons, but it shouldn't go to carbon
the rest it's right
not more

usa doesn't have hate speech law
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_by_country
i mean depends on the place
that's a lie
you can't tolerate non tolerance
and also don't forget the tolerance paradox
you can't insult people scot free
moral damage is a thing
wait
i mean i do get the general idea, but... it just doesn't work that way
??? what mental gymnastics are behind this even?
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/313730199915331585/909782558554882048/unknown.png
he must comment on a essay that has this as subject
A friend of mine got an uni assignment
i don't know if i should consider this serious talk, but i guess we can seriously discuss on this if any of you wants
ok ok
government bonds for one
Sure but there are other safer means
if he invested in other means he wouldn't have crashed like that
poor fool
you can get arrested
it's outright a crime
here you can't open a "fascist party" or do roman salute
well for example
I know right? it's weird if they use that like that
i do recall mel stating that some time ago, i just forgot (also bad habit)
my bad kerrik, sorry
oh well alright, i didn't think on it
their share value in the last month
https://puu.sh/IpMhr/f8e8e07ab4.png
and activision is suffering rn
according to NASDAQ
today activision lost 2,40% in share value
they bail out
it's always like that, if the shareholders feel that their capital can become uncertain
treat shareholders as condors watching the company in every single mini move
so it's not entirely true
because CEO position destabilized = loss in shares
watch out
everything changes
but in a normal business
since shareholders can't be liable
in a corp is just the administration board
it's vital to the life of a company
Are you really forgetting the risk that involves running the company?
and he's still the one responsible for the business
He's still the enterpreteneur
those who don't, don't grow lank
it would be dumb to not reinvest
they're not one and the same
Normal corporations also do that
hence is fundamental
is already your dear investor
The person who put the initial capital
A business cannot start without initial capital
i approve
not bad move^
i don't want to misunderstand
explain this last statement
you will notice they're no different from a classic Corp
the answer lies behind the door
Think on how these work lankl
lol
one example can be an exception, exceptions can't be the rules
not a several decades surviving business
but 5 years is a startup
of course a coop can survive easier that way
and these are datas on the early 5 years
do large scale coop
Lank you can't
and their balance is extremely delicate
they're fit only for certain types of business
open, close, open, close
Coop companies exist, and they fail continously
it's ultra important.
don't forget how a company comes into the world
And the employer is such because someone, or himself invested
if one dries up the other suffers
one calls the other
they're mutual
since who do you think is gonna pay the employees?
for anything
no employee will work
If there is no investor
without investors
lank, there are no employees
so it's false to say that this doesn't  produce effect, it's just not visible under the broad daylight
poor people living there
Anyways i find ridiculous and hilarious what's happening in india rn.

> refuses to join effort to reduce emissions
> smog everywhere
of course it can't act directly
what a international organization can do is to communicate between nations
not my fault, hands up
i just noticed
lol
of recent discussion
this was matter
https://www.oecd.org/ctp/fightingtaxevasion.htm
for this one
biden is playing dumb
i hope you understand.
the pact to hunt down the issue...
to enter
Yes but if one of the biggest economic blocks refuses
USA.
that's the issue
such pact.
USA refused to enter
exists to hunt down tax evasion
that's why a coop between 112 world countries
well what can i say, this is a matter of opinion
party ended.
once they do
a matter of laws catching up
mel, that's just
but crypto is dangerous anyways
Wallets have to be tracked down
it's difference between day and night
to 1990s one
compare tax evasion nowadays
even with crypto is going to become impossible soon
tax evasion is harder and harder to do
in recent times
at risk
there, it's only the invested capital
and Corporations
The thing changes on limited responsibility businesses
the debts of the business
you can literally have to pay with your private money
The totality.
is not in every society format
"limited responsibility"
some others don't
some include the economic sphere
by law they're not infinite
it's just the juridical model of the companyu
no?
of the subject
but the whole economic sphere
at risk
Since it's not only the invested capital
This aspect heavily depends on the type of business. A single enterpreteneur lives the whole company life with the danger of living on the streets the day after
"this is mine"
of
we come into the world with the preconcept
Are we sure of that?
you can't tell humans to not act humanlike
lank i don't agree x_x
and it would create new jobs
that would be a neat idea nevis
but regulations are already underway
must not*
or better
and can't go monkey on ancap
that's why capitalism needs regulations
look, this will get into another door of the discussion i don't feel like stepping into right now
it's a vicious cycle...
and the sad part
no rakhi of course they shouldn't but that is what it happens
since it will cost more
but that results in the product being uncompetitive and undersold
and i admire them A LOT
I know stores that promote that thinking
since the importer can't know everything
what i'm trying to strike at, sure it's also the importer fault, but to a lesser degree
if not a retailer, we can talk about wholesalers
to produce the pair of shoes that lay on the shelf?
but lank, on a legal way can a retailer know effectively how much co2 was emitted
but Xi immense lust for world domination ignores the problem
complicity
btw what i tried to say is that, while it's a corp fault when they pollute, it's also same fault of the host country, since it allowed them to do whatever
Protectionism is bad over a certain degree
are you in the 1920?
Protectionism.
and not refuse like india and china
all countries should regulate it
This is why joint effort is ultra important
THis means such laws are allowing the crapfiesta
lank
China makes laws that apply on chinese soil
if CN starts to regulate on this aspect, things would change
and their fault
so their rules
it's their land
such conduct
it should be held responsible for allowing
lank
that's china fault
drinkable one
also china is wasting water
these dams.
eeeeeeeh, at the cost of what? that hydro power china is generating is absolutely bad for environment
it's their job to *Regulate* production emissions
it doesn't give the rights to CCP to ignore the problem
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/310094405728206850/909893867019587654/FB_IMG_1637005995535.jpg?width=958&height=676
also china stop pls
what can i say?
that are in my power
with some other things
My acting is teaching the young what is right. It's the way of spreading things.
to educate them.
No i said
Hey guys i never said to nott do anything
will take years
Oh surely, but effective change will not be immediate
(i am sorry to hear that btw)
it's easier to educate the young
yeah but you can't change an old fart way of reasoning
why do you think this is wrong?
i guess i will stop here anyways or it will end in "cypher talks about proceduralism"
changes are not that fast is what i'm getting at
by teaching the new generations.
No we must improve society
that will topple it back
but lank, there will be always someone who wants to take advantage
this is why i find some reasonings purely utopical
not without humans changing completely their ways
can't work on bigger scales
i am convinced that such workings
or better
Look i feel like
not everyone is fit to lead
tribals do have leaders
such thing existed even in dead eastern ones
nah
humans die.
Humans do adapt if the chance is given. But when the change is brutal
and while we can modify it, we can't entirely change it that easily. We need to change step by step, by teaching newer generations
We chose one path to progress
to go back to monke
You can't tell humanity
for a second i tought you were mocking me, then i remembered your expertise, sry lank lel
more than caring about the environment
and money is a big driving power
we have driving powers
the old granny has 9 cats? bear with it.
and lol here in italy you can't forbid pets in condos *by law*
if stated in the rules
but it would be possible
it would be weird for a condo to forbid smoking
Well people, i will resign from this discussion. There are some dots that just don't connect and i don't feel like drilling more right now, next time maybe, this could go on for hours and hours. Thank you all for sharing your opinions, ideas and annexed things, i appreciate your time spent.
what can i do instead is taking certain measures to not pollute myself and teach the others to do the same
"or i was educated to"
but it's the way how i think
Sorry to write this statement
So i have to take other means. I don't believe into protests, i believe into promoting the right politicians.
but it has developed so much, that my actions can't directly affect it. I'm answering bikki here.
I never said to let the tumor grow
but it is way more heavier now
mine also got educated to climate change
that it is not the same
uuuh i do think
and vote
*promote
with that i should endorse politicians that think in that way
isn't this what i was saying?
Avg. protest period in italy Sept-dec
except all protests die down in december, average italian gets his "Panettone", christmas tree and related stuff. Everything will resume on the next september.
we had 20% before 2011 crisis
and 10% reduced one for things like agricultural fuel and friends
then we got minimal at 4% for first necessity goods
has 22%
italy with all the high taxes
it's insane
23% iirc?
how much is the vat there kat currently?
gl getting it
woh that's smart
good job
Weimar is that you?
Kat i suggest you at this point, to save €, zloty is not safe
10k currently
but italy is 80+% vax
We are having a rise of cases as well
I am going to bed now anyways. Goodnight
It held 120% of the assets
But then, it never sold any lines
The isp went private
Here it went weird
for what? 2 mbps.
i used to pay 54€/m back in 2010
which is a fun weird fact since the cable owner is still one.
market competition
but the infighting between the isps brought the prices to lower
it was higher in t he past
it's 72 usd, which is 64€
really?
shit
holy
here i pay 34€/m
how much do you pay lank
goddamn if it's so crap
here there is a weird trend of 2 isps centering themselves on wifi relay system
it's prone to interference
uh i don't like the satellite concept
High frequency copper? (VDSL2)
what kidn of uplink?
depending on the geographical location
it's just, not possible yet
to claim that you will replace everything with fibre
well it's ultra ambitious
it smells of bad
to what
else it's court.
yeah telecom italy has to guarantee 31 mbps
if they don't respect it, up to court they go
btw the law still forces the isps to guarantee a minimum
other than that we will get full 5g coverage in a couple of years
everybody else? has loaned the cables
fact: everything is still owned by the ex gov controlled ISP (Telecom Italy)
where i live
according to a technician who i got to know, i will get 300 or 1 gbps ftth by 2023/2024
i got a 100/21 mbps contract but i get 50-60/21 coz of some cable limitations
at the same identical price.
here is either  50-100 mbps VDSL2 or straight up 1 gbps fiber
twisted it in a bad way
but society back then
i don't doubt that
oh sure
lmao melua
which was ultra rare
but she knew how to read and write in Chinese
but main reason was that the novel was written with women in mind as readers
i retract. Tale of Genji was in kana
no my bad on this
(shikubu is class 973)
infact Murasaki Shikubu, who was a writer and a poetess, she wrote the Tale of Genji and thus broke an huge taboo by using kanji back then
Women were forbidden to use Kanji when writing
till a certain point
take for example
in japan it was also fault of buddhism
before that even female daimyos were a thing
Role of women in Japan became to decay with the rise of the Sengoku era, touching the lowest in Meiji restauration
bruh political sabotage is always bad
is 86 years old
to head of state
fact one of our candidates
and know their stuff
70 years old people lived their life
no?
i don't agree 12-15 either
seriously
what the heck is 6 years old voting
<@!203444794737950720> <@!174272493777977344> https://www-wirtualnemedia-pl.translate.goog/artykul/panstwowy-holding-spozywczy?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui
what the heck? people have issues
what can i say
to play vice city multiplayer?
was to come home
even if all i did
did what i did
didn't go to the protests
of them
majorityu
but think on this, if i did this stuff, surely some other people did the same and understood years later it was wrong
now i know not everyone is the same
not actually protesting
and not go to class
to stay at home
i just took the opportunity
for example when the students were protesting for political decisions
i've grown since then, understood more of the world. I still have to learn and i still make mistakes (refer to <#407060923078017026> 30 mins ago), but i've made my way
but i wouldn't trust the 16 y/o me to vote for the country
i don't know how to explain it
thus liable of being prosecuted
but at least the law expects these idiots to become responsible with adult age
Isky i do agree with this
because they haven't lived enough to be taught it
But here's the catch. They don't know that some stuff is wrong
not because they thought that he might have made something intellegible as policy
just because they thought "mussolini was a cool dude"
i've been a 16 years old teenager and i know what's like. Another example is this group of hopeless idiots that went to rome (they were 17) and did roman salute infront of hebrew temple.
sure isky
"because is cool" is 16
for instance is one of the ages where they start smoking
can i speak out of experience that a 16 years old tends to not actually understand things properly?
i think that voting being capped to adult ageis still ideal, here you can vote for the deputies at 18 years old and for the senate at 25 years old
no matter the wing
Lank i am sorry, i'm not in the mood to discuss it. Maybe another time, even if i do have a feeling of deja vu on this exact argument.
it's because of the retrograde way of thinking
x_x
i hope that this stuff doesn't pass
well the lesser evil
the law must be absolute.
send my blood boiling
i wont hide that these poland bs news
Oh yes sure and i am a witch
It was a more general statement
then
more sanctions
Health data, in this case pregnancy, is protected by the fresh new GDPR laws, submitted in 2016, mandatory since 2018 for all EU member states
it would be against GDPR
Btw if i am not wrong
the country is going backwards in the decades
can pis stop murdering poland already?
i just wanted context isky
Is this in poland?
Good
that's hilarious
This headline is nosensical by boot
you can open it and it will be in english
it's a translated link

if this idea permeates in the eu parliament that's it
now surely EU will take a bit since it's a slow huge bureaucratic machine
btw so far is going as i predicted
because if no one took the initiative, nothing was going to be done
well this is what i meant as appealing to eu
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Italian_Chamber_of_Deputies_current.svg/1920px-Italian_Chamber_of_Deputies_current.svg.png
our parliament rn
uuf i think i miss spelled
do you use still POST?
aus system is borked
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Italy
nevis
to italian one
it's nearly 1:1
like italy
again Parliamentary Republics
but they were ignored
like france
we had two right wing party leaders, trying to push presidentialism
Parliament + Regional councils elect the President
the ministers are elected in general election. 

we vote the party, the party decides his winning guy to become prime minister, then he presents a team of ministers to the president, and if the president agrees new government is founded
but of the President
i never talked about the Prime minister
Watch out
i cannot check it now
no, i am dead sure the queen also signs them in the lastest steps
the Queen does sign the laws
wait
elected by the parliament
the head of state should be an overseer
lol that's fucked up
it's a repesentative power, they should check the laws before making them pass, Supreme command of the armed forces, and the power to dismember the parliament
this is the power of our President (Head of State)
old geezer
as our President head of state
UK monarchy has more or less the same powers
USD is less powerful than €
This is why i suggest you to save € and not Zloty
but it's a fact that the world doesn't move at the same speed
no offence
of these countries
had members dressing in black
this party i am talking of
nor nats
don't  joke on it lank, radical right is not something akin to libs
there is a fascist party called "Forza Nuova" (new force) which had Mussolini's Granddaughter as leader, it got recently shot down after they raided trade union places
you still can't found "neofascist party"
only banned parties here are Fascists
Freedom of speech and political orientation
(some nats are involved but it's not official)
anti vax people are independent
the vaccine
btw nah here no party dares to oppose
complete vaxxed population here is 73%
otherwise red chirstmas
yesterday the PM talked to the citizens warning them to follow the common sense and getting vaxed
ah we are jumping into a 4th wave here
and so on
nats becoming libs
populists becoming social dems
they can here
can one change their party while in power there?
liberals hardcore hate social dems here
nah we got this fake failed populist party, social dems (PD), liberals and some nats (right wing did a big alliance, everything went muddled, nationalists becoming europeists and stuff)
so they are barred out
here
"The greens" can't make past the 3% bar
but back to serious now
it smells of (sorry for the words) "rednecks with pitchforks straight outta farms"
LOL
finally
since populism has been understood as wrong
they will fail so hard in next elections
are populists
yellow
ah
but they are becoming liberals
they were nationalists
our greens are something that morphed through recent history
lmao
the rest of the left wing doesn't make it to the parliament
are social dems
that our reds
oh yeah it has to be said
lel
more colors
you need
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Italian_Senate_current.svg/1920px-Italian_Senate_current.svg.png
our senate
plus land owners pay taxes
i work, i pay, i buy, i own
why not?
because yes?
imagine having worked for years to save up and buy a piece of land to have your small agricultural enterprise, why shouldn't someone be allowed to do that?
No pls
Is bad
High vat in a country like poland
Peace out
Lank we will never agree on this
Income taxes are different
Paying more taxes just for owning something is a tax i do not approve
Ugh wealth taxes
you made me chuckle
that's the opposite thing
poland wants to print more money to fight inflation???
wait wait
that's bad
uuuh
and stuff
with baseball bats
and raided the students
came out running from the backyards
these black uniform goons
were protesting vs a bill
or what else, university students
assaults are singular episodes, majority of them made by organized crime
it can't be touched here
no media is sacred
when that happened majority of the parliament, nats and libs included voted to shut down the party in question
dressed in same uniforms
no but they did physically raid and destroy trade unions
this is what they claim
to "vigilate" over immigrants
boarding trains
quality matters
i think you misunderstood
that the gov should not give houses
i'm not saying
it's meh
but converting everything to that?
since everyone should have a roof under their head
it's good for lower classes
these complexes are so ugly, bad and undermaintained
we have it herwe
ooooh don't get me started about the govt housing, it's not good at all
or rather  they can't
in the long run
the state just wont care for the decay
yeah exactly
it doesn't compare
a businessman has to manage his stuff, the state has to manage everything
with biblical times
i don't trust my govt with such workload
starting to mismanage 90% of these lands
Imagine the workload of the already overbureaucratic machine of the state
here the laws gives you ownership of a piece of land if you are there by 20 years and no one tells you anything
so you get the money running
what i could approve, is a law allowing landowners to *lend* the land to the community for a fee
well whatever
i want to make money off the land? i have the right of buying a piece of it
but one must live also for themselves
it doesn't make sense
i just can't lank
if i install Solar Panels.
like Energy companies do
they must pay me for it.
if the gov wants to use my land for communal reasons
But i paid for the land, no one has the right to disown it if i maintain it properly
tho they do get pushed by gov here
that's another matter entirely, poor small agricultural business
lots of taxes
then in this 355k city
closest biggest city to here is 355k
well we live in a different reality
whew
you can express it on inhabitants numbers
where you live lank
how much big is the city
now. good luck applying your standards to this
https://static2-viaggi.corriereobjects.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/iStock-1183694794-1080x810.jpg?v=445039
this is a town of 20k inhabitants, a really famous one, in the province where i live
okay that's extreme lmao
and that photo is of the good ones
here
https://www.borderline24.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/case-popolari.jpg these are what govt complexes look right now
okay these are pretty lank, but you don't get that pretty look in most of the cases...
i do know a few
true
too many tall buildings are ugly
to balance things out
yeah but you need
sure
you interpreted it over the line.
not that's okay for these to live in shit housing lank
to give roof to those who cannot.
houses
i meant that it's okay for government to build
I didn't mean that
but i have quality issues with govt houses
i didn't want to
i am sorry
btw lank if i offended you or something
ah well i can't say anything about that
that's not true
you can't do whatever only to watch the building come down at the first eartquake shock
are strictly regulated
also house market and construction
if i were a builder
since i do get more money by building good houses
except law controlled market is another thing entirely
i think the balance lays in between
yeah me also
because the govt mismanages
is my argument
indeed
given your circumstances, i understand
well i see where you're coming from lank
chilling out
they weren't scared at all
unchecked
i remember horses roaming freely in the lower part of the town
freaking great
in the class
we were 8 kids in primary school
550*
600 inhabitants

wait better photo
i have fond memories
https://www.viaggiareinpuglia.it/img/Localita/panni_panorama_1502357708154.jpg
bruh look at the small town where i used to live
there is no balance
lol
omg that's a slap in the eye
600 not 600k.
on a mountain
in a 600 inhabitants town
of my childhood
look i lived part
but nearby town near city yes
i don't like to live in big city
this is me
you can't build them
Skyscrapers are banned in Europe
well again, i don't know melbourne but
holy lol
2 685,62 ab./km²
is
lank in this city

the gov decided to put a big chonky bridge
if the vaccine is effective vs it
Pfizer is yet to confirm
has mutated 32 times
Omicron
poland should have focused on renewable
but i doubt it given current fuckery
it's gonna be faster
Poland is part of EU, if EU helps poland into doing the plant
uh depends in this case
Coal mines in poland are freaking useless waste of money that pollute like no tomorrow.

EU: Renewable sources/Nuclear
Poland: Coal
but gang wars are rather frequent in camorra
mafia *had* some sort of moral code (for example, women in mafia used to be accountants for the whole "family", managing finances and stuff)
expecially camorra is ruthless
And yes Hollywood glamourizes mafia and camorra
literally adding dozens of years of jail
if it's proven that a criminal is in organized crime, the punishment will rise dramatically here
err
being detected
but they can't oppose it by themselves
maybe some nats
opposing vax
it will pass easily here, there's no major political party
it was forbidden before
we are just about to allow vax for 5-11 kids
no matter the occupation
all workplaces require vax here now, by law
you can't go even on public transport without it
"Super Green Pass"
here we created a SECOND green pass
at this point i might just say that vaccines should have been made mandatory and end this circus
come on
.-.
higher ups fighting for power
i can foresee a scenario akin to the man in high castle geopolitical situation in germany. but in russia
i don't hink that kat
when his heart will stop beating crap will implode
oh dear
does putin have progeny?
now that i think of it
nothing new
like all influent politicians
i tought he was like 55
woh he is pretty old
uh that would be bad
how old is putin
since italians are like this, december comes, christmas comes, end of all protests, see ya in september
but i don-t think so that much
infact i fear that this will force the government hand
and anti vaxxers got violent lately
and we are deploying 3rd dose
italy has a 75%~ vax rate
but it's true that their vaccines were less effective than ours
Oh yes i heard that
elaborate, i lost something
is that Sputnik was really weak
Issues with Russian vaccine
hm
tell that to nats becoming europeists
is outdated.
tying politicians down to definitions (like a certain politician i recall calling everyone in the left wing a "commie")
they're not the same for centuries
Lank politics do evolve
there is no true universal definition
depending on the country
really changes
i think thatt this
if you add a bit of blue it becomes centre right, thus a lib
if you add a bit of red it becomes centre left, thus socdem
being a dem is centre in general
are centre left
social dems
no
that logo should have been illegal
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Freie_Demokratische_Partei_%28Logo%2C_1952-1968%29.png
i didn't notice this
but whatever
isky i don't agree with that
i don't know how your political situation works
mostly
meh, libs are centre right
libs are moderates, or are supposed to
A lib shouldn't be a right wing lunatic
i full agree
Oh well in this case
being a lib doesn't mean being an idiot lank
for a reason lank
politics are fun
sorry i misunderstood
now it works better
aaaaaaaaaah
you can instead push the land owners to plant themselves through incentives
land sequestering is not pog...
CN can't be left like that ruining the globe
btw can you really blame germany?
Omicron?
Nah don't worry about that. It's dystopical, let them spend more and more money so they will end up broke
Man what they told you is very sad... Ten...
So it's possible for them to treat it at home and avoid intensive care and health dangers
Some vaccined do end infected but it manifests like a normal flu
Yeah this is the mlst important thing
I am doublevaxed since august
This is what i did and thankfully i didn't get infected
And wash your hands often
Use mask
Do not bundle up with others
Juat use the well known precautions
The precautions are the same, the difference is that (not to be pessimistic but at least moderna does) the vax companies doubt about the effectiveness vs omicron, plus the fact that omicron is more aggressive spreading wise
conscientious objection
btw here euthanasia passed as legal **but** a law passed to let medical staff abstain from being involved in the process
and surely AI will never be enough for this kind of decision, and i say it as a person Pro-AI
if not less
imagine a bedridden person with cancer who has got not more than 1 month to live
to avoid suffering
i think that euthanasia is a thing that must exist *exclusively* for terminally ill people
a psychiatrist and a psychologist **must** be involved
of course you can't let an AI decide if one should be allowed to assisted suicide
What the heck
Fine, opinions are such exactly because they're just opinions
I don't want to be rude
Yes sure matt, can i retain my opinion?
not the same
they're similar
I disagree
he made an extreme contorted example taking it out of context
You misunderstood my argument if you took that out from my sentences
btw i agree with rady's statement
humanity is wonderful because we can disagree
It's fine
Opinions
Something can be right while something on a similar line can be wrong
The world is not black and white matt
and i will never be
No i am not anti abortion
but you do
You think you don't affect others
ripple effect
No you shouldn't, because there's impact in what one does with its own body
And this is on a similar line on how i oppose death sentence
so this would be an extraordinary circumstance
The right to live is undeniable, not even one self must be able to deny it
without a Medic, a Psychologist and a psychiatrist examination
Btw i wouldn't ever approve euthanasia outside terminal phases of terminal incurable illnesses
that allowed one (male born before 1986) to avoid mandatory draft
it's the same concept
exactly
dw
🇮🇹
no
As languages are mirror of a culture, it's a cultural bout
it derailed
i don't like it either tbh, i just went with the flow
except in abortion there is a mitigation of factors that don't fit the euthanasia
Sure lank and i would respect that
it's now a thing for medical staff as well
but
this is used in military department
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector
it tolls even on medical staff
Matt, it's more than enough to mention the conscientious objection i presented before
No because the || rapist|| wronged
like politics.
nor black nor white
As i stated before, the world is filled with infinite shades
2010 to 2017
with 15 slots
i had a private server
(no ts, overwolf sucks)
but they stood hard to their old standards
what ts could have done to stay in the market was to bring up their game up to eleven and bring new features
about in 2017~
also i was a bit more comfortable with ts3, but in the end i went "whatever" and started using discord
when ts3 went to shit it was your server problem and not something that brought down the whole network
eeeeh, i elaborated about this a lot. Some things discord can do were not a thing on TS3 and viceversa
but then TS3 won the market battle
Ventrilo was on pair with Teamspeak 3
LOL
for money
they're rasping
wtf discord
Polywork...
What did i just ready
You know how programming works
the concept of the laws, not the book
the Three Laws of Robotics
what do you guys think about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics
btw changing subject
can't leave eu alone
otherwise who is going to compete with China ™️ ?
but we need US to exist
GDPR is really strict
otherwise EU laws would bust discord out of existence
Selling data would need to be included in the Privacy Agreement
which is now nothing more than my private discord
i wll later
on the matter
thanks for your two cents
hm valid
so it can't
Third Law
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
but
pls rady
i was trying to ask an opinion...
there's no ownage here
hm
will be forced to follow them
even a self aware ai
so if the rules are absolute
goddamn it really 😂
Np, pharios, you're great yourself. Glad that you feel better now

I need to sleep
Btw sry as much as i'd like discussing this
Ratings are passed by more thannone agency and it just estimates how "safe" is investing in it
Fico is not alone
It doesn't compare imho
And fico is a rating agency
The concept behind social credit is just wrong
Moderna declared that their vaccine is not that much effective vs Omicron
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Scammers aim at small fishes
Plus the scammer account gets spammed around in antiscam groups
High tier traders are basically deadlocked vs scammers, their big network already flushed out and reported the scammer in the grand majority of the cases. Plus there are some non written rules about trading, when one is broken, big alert pops up, blocks and reports are istantaneous
i don't think the system will get that affected
Nah
for internet, since it was ultrafresh
well 90s were an obscure period
Ah that
and i'm missing others
Ubisoft, Ea, Epic games allowed this fuckery
that he invested incorrectly
Well i hope someone explained him
"you brought this on yourself"
it's just an empty bait
why nft tho?
Even a poor person who becomes poorer because his nft went in flames doesn't deserve sympathy
I am not against rich people, i'm against these idiots investing in this kind of thing
what are you referring at?
and then nft bursts
imagine a rich person investing lots of his fortune into NFT
meh that's not true, dumb rich people do exist
could have been useful if used in another way, i can't wait for the bubble to burst and get a good laugh as money goes back into the system
fucking NFT really
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/878/385/a57.jpg 
biblically accurate angel ™️
you must go for the hebrew one
if you want something close to the OG
from the bible tbh
Vatican made too many edits and banned too many books
This is what i mean lol
let's remember freaking Ophanim
expecially if you take the stuff that the catholic church banned
it's something that it's mind blown
The true rad part of the bible is the old testament
other than being a way to explain the unknown
to a society
it's important to note that religion served as means to give rules
also the bible ripped out the gift of immortality from the epic of gilgamesh
catholic one is too much altered
but yeah Hebrew bible is the closest to the og
made of flames
which are also something fucked up
2nd ranked is the seraphs
y
is the lowest
i don't remember if the cherub
angel
lowest tier (or second to lowest)
i know
y
if i didn't knew it was from the bible i would have said it was an eldritch abomination from lovecraft
tl;dr i don't blame the consequence
but this is my honest opinion on this
not right now
data on thsi
now again i don't have
the investor complained a misuse of their money
they made the call
choose, lose the investors and deliver a decent product, or keep them close and release shit
and their fault
CDPR could have counter gambled more delay. it was their choice, thus their grief
if you can't deliver it
You don't promise a game to the investors
cdpr fucked up huge
i just say that the investors were right to get angry
now i don't have the data at hand
during release periods
at CDPR administration board
i do remember a certain fishy discussion
btw on this precise matter
i'm sorry matt
I don't hate on rich people just because they're rich
Both were victims
Just because someone is forcing you to do something bad, it doesn't mean you're innocent
and send them to hell
i would just sell my portion of the shares
one x period after the ceo **keeps delaying**
one week after the ceo delays more
one day the ceo delays
matt, think if you gave cdpr your money to continue their project
but i wont delve into that specific case since i don't have intel at hand
angry on such situation
it's a natural consequence to get those who paid to support the project
it's better to say that it was completely mismanaged, the investors were rightfully losing their patience
those investors risked their money tbf
finally CDPR pays
come on pepsi...
The shit
and atrocities were committed
the issue was that said people abused of the colonies
this is an undeniable fact
well Europeans did export technology and western culture to the colonies
it's outrageous
for example the removal of the memorial statue of tienanmen
China situation is spiraling out of hand
is this true?
https://mobile.twitter.com/ResetEraNT/status/1474622868273172482
But media stated that
Eh
Here we will surely go in lockdown on jan
The fuckery is bigger than first wave
But whatever, tumblr is on a downhill road lol
Shhh don't spoil you dark web dealers, it's bad sport
I agree with lank
Uk is playing with fire
?_?
On new year
Uk is going to lockdown
*flashbacks into glorious zipangu*
I know it's serious but don't mind me commenting that this discussion gives out the man in high castle vibe lol
Good
She could get tested
Tampons?
Tell nan to steer away from infected ppls
Stay safe lily
Govt pays businesses to do stats
Here tracking is a joint effort of private and public institutions
If not, well it's not the end. You could be able of recovering data
Writing expecially
Did it drop while it was running?
And i think it's a good ideal
Eu takes a balanced approach on this
Gl doing that lol
Blasted ignorance
Lmao forreal
nice
pill
they're so pretty
btw giff pure redy ruby
it's volatile
Yeah but it's not an everlasting thing
so i wont elaborate further as i'm not a wizard in the matter
is complicated
anyways gemstone market
giff
5 carat rubies 😅
https://puu.sh/IAF3g/07badd7cac.png
sure it's an inflated value but it's not that sky high as it seems
so slow down on the statement
not 100%
40% of the market
holds
de beer
like asteroids
on celestial bodies as well
Anyways we should be able to find rare gems
Similar light dispersion makes them similar
Imitation diamonds are just rutile gemstones known as "Titania"
since they're really really really ultra rare
are outside the scale
Pure Red Rubies
Dia = 4300$/ct (1 carat)
Saph = 10k$(ct) (1 carat)
is the Sapphire
most pricey*
but the rarest gem is not the diamond
but they're the hardest material on the planet
it's half a myth
ok i looked it up
so it's only legit that they're pricey
and diamonds are ultra rare
and it's way less deadly
but the symptoms are way lighter
easier to spread
as in
the fact about omicron is that is more virulent
it arrived a bit too late
just got approved
(this goes for nearly everything tbh)
it's how humans will end up using it
it's not the tech itself at fault
Augmented reality could have some pros tho
not even Cyberpunk universe gets down that level lol
i think that Augmented Reality showed in the video looks more like a Dystopia
yeah the change of atmospheric pressure caused by the explosion
Volcanoes are amazing
tbh
cool shit
oh
the aftermath of that volcano proxying to germany?
What am i looking for exactly?
damn cryptobros
as in "wtf"?
the heck did i read
if not the point where the arm was stung was a bit sore
0 symptoms
I got my 3rd shot last friday
now she has to take care of herself and stay warm
well what's done is done
so if the body is already trained to fightt off the real virus, what is the point of vaccine?
to fight off the real virus
so the body can train the defenses
Vaccine is nothing more than part of the virus
it's logical if you think of it
you count as being vaxxed
If you become positive
she counts vaxxed
das
she can't
really take care lily and don't hesitate to call emergency number if your symptoms worsen
well yeah you should have taken the vax
my booster is dated last friday
before booster
4 months
here you have to wait
i got 3 doses
you both vaxxed?
take care you too
more or less
but as long as it doesn't cause breathing problems then your lungs will be okay
but yeah symptoms can vary
Oh take care lily
i'm asking out of curiosity
?
symptomatic or asym.
i don't know the laws where lily lives, but here you just can't after getting positive, you have to wait 4 months
just yellow danger regions
Govt refuses any form of lockdown
190k cases in italy
but it's dangerous so we are nott doing that rn
once a week
and prob to meet irl friends
and friends
like buying bread
Same eh, i'm not a person who likes to stay out long anyways, but now with the remote working i just don't go out if not to run minor errands
before booster
Here by *law* you have to wait 4 months
for a day
Reminder that china always looks at the situation of the middle east. Unforgettable how they dared to whine about Afghanistan
eh...
too much aggressive
the real flaw into EU laws is the copyright one
vs the downsides
i like to brag about eu because the upsides are really big
```1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation **shall be prohibited.** 
```
https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-9-processing-of-special-categories-of-personal-data-GDPR.htm
so 9 is the other one which includes biometric
Art 10 is legal data
(i confused the article number, 18 is the right to restriction of processing)
so yeah i expect some clownfiesta
and you can't keep it "for the luls"
you can't do a normal treatment
which is regulated by article 19
just think of it, biometric data has the same relevance as legal data
yes that's true
it will be fun when Meta will fall flat vs EU GDPR. Biometric data is strictly regulated by Article 18
The customer comes first
24 months
Legal warranty is a thing across all eu
What's this
No one deserves that
I hope they get better
Oh dear
heh
https://i.imgur.com/XH1oQEP.jpg as much as i don't like cryptos this has to be noted
if she has some care, she wont
depends on how scummy this person acts
"pay or we torch your shop"
this is pure blackmailing
what she is doing is no different from how mafia acts when asks protection money
If you put it like that it would mean thatt any situation is balanced, which we both know, it's not
or like 2020 (ongoing)
like 2011
That was not balance, that was chaos
1929
black monday
That's false
applies to any superpower
The same concept i've spoken above
but of course
But yeah i can say china
I was about to say that vyn
"The invisible hand of free market" was supposed to be doing that. But we both know that free market can't go wild or implodes.
Globalization, as much as i support it, has its own cons
globally
The world (human world) doesn't move at the same speed
of protectionism
it has to do with lesser forms
everything would crumble under China aggressive approach
If you remove the taxes i quoted above
You can like it or not
If you're writing, now, here. It's because some kind of balance has been estabilished
if you remove these, balance would be in danger
are one of the things that keeps the world economy kinda working
and Trade taxes
Customs Taxes
but it's not that easy, the issue comes up here and there, i.e. when you go to a mere job interview "Do you have driving license & car?" > Deciding factor on being rejected.
The whole society has to change, which is not a flip switch.

Ah that's for sure. (mining)
Ok i got what you mean now
i think that one should use a car when it's needed and not because of lazyness
look lank, i'm not trying to be an ass but electrics are something we can't ditch. What we could do is to educate people to not waste them
i changed mine once, the car is 2 decades old
even a decade
if you don't screw up
a car battery is supposed to last years
Yeah but it is finite
it has to be digital
You can't even make an invoice by law on paper now
So you want just to tell the average person to not use a phone. This is a plan that, in my honest opinion, is doomed from the start, i will give you the mere example that now government is digitalizing everything, even ID card.
A key drawback to using a metallic magnesium anode is the tendency to form a passivating (non conducting) layer when recharging, blocking further charging (in contrast to lithium's behaviour);
yeah
at least here
oh yeah ofc state unis they're a thing
This is more solid
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_battery
btw
these scientsts do not work without money
well capitalists do pay scientist to give an answer
y
```Glass batteries
Maria Helena Braga at the University of Porto in Portugal has been working on an unusual battery with John Goodenough, the Nobel prizewinning inventor of the li-ion battery. The key component is the electrolyte, which is made of glass spiked with sodium ions, which can travel through it. Every material needed is easy to source. “It’s the most eco-friendly cell you can find,” says Braga.

The battery apparently has extraordinary properties: Braga says it can outperform lithium-based batteries; the one in her office has been powering an LED for five years. Others are having trouble replicating the device. Still, with backing from the likes of Goodenough, this is one battery to watch.```
the studies about this are many
tungsten
Salt, Magnesium, Glass batteries
LEL
Zinc, Sodium- Sulphur, Hydrogen Fuel cells
we will ditch lithium at some point
and studied/developed
to lithium are being proposed
Btw alternatives
i try to go mid end
tho i do not buy high end
(even battery goes to shit in the long run)
but each its own
i couldn't live with such outdated phone
for the use i do
last one was in 2015
i bought mine in 2019
or becomes just bad
I change my phone only when it just can't continue working
we need to find an alternative
a while back
I was thinking the same
dw
yeah that's my bad
yeah
Lank understood what i meant
but we have been over that
Lank, i just can't agree with that statement
i admit i used a not so good example tho
Hm, no wait, i didn't mean that in specific mel
everything is relative
I always say that nothing it's black or white
it's a frail one
i used the word "kinda balanced"
Russia should stop considering Ukraine as their property
One must respect the decision a country made regards it's sovereignty (most of the times)
I don't agree
i meant "Society changes slowly, if it goes too fast it causes disasters"
I never stated "less cars = deaths"
it's indirect
but you can't go faster, not without causing deaths
we are already changing
Ugh this is too much hyperaggressive
Take care ten
ramifications everywhere.
but let's take the scenario where one attempts it in public and fails
So attempting suicide is not outlawed by itself
so you can't renounce to it
by law the right to live is not yours to decide, it's mandatory
it goes into weird legal ramifications
is complicated.
Pushing someone to commit suicide is a crime here, attempting suicide itself
freaking tiktok
Sad that neonazis can be encountered in wargaming
Good riddance indeed, the law is absolute. Sorry for living under the rule of the law. This is not wild murrica
something something gdpr laws, i wish the whole world had this kind of things, us has too much leeway
so yeah lose/lose
if they did, it's just worse
if they lied, we don't have proof they checked out
then it's just defamation
that's illegal lol
but but
directly
Ah they checked out the email
but i'm missing to understand what they outed
I've read the post
what happened here?
wait wait
and it would serve as a booster to space, imagine not having to leave earth orbit every damn time so to not waste tons of solid fuel
it would be actually less bothersome than to make it on a langrange point
i just hope we prepare to make an international space station on the moon
what did i just read? Usually parents push to get a job... where are you from again, if you don't mind me asking
Has sense
uh all of them will burn?^
not so hyped about that
eeeeh space junk
and stall there for decades
it will reach a weird unfavorable point for all 3 parts involved
True war will not sparkle
I do not have words
i kinda lost the subject here
Jk let's keep it serious
(rady's basement?)
Just knowing "this happens here" is gpod to know
Well I do not think of it of being interested, but i think that it's more of "keeping in check with reality". It is different than discussing about politics
Ukraine has NATO bases
Lel
Confused you
I think that hungary
No lol
That would upscale in all out war
Huge difference
Poland is in eu
Ukraine is not in eu
And he roused separatists
<@354236264595324928> the issue is that tzar putin wants ukraine
Poor Ukraine
They are disheartening
I heard the news
Spain pls
https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/spain-extends-current-measures-for-eu-schengen-area-travellers-until-end-of-february/
One has to choose their poison lank
Remember that several eu members do not even have mandatory 1-year draft anymore (we are an example) and thus on volunteer system
Otherwise china and russia would go monkey
I think that nato has its reason to exist
Ukraine is not eu
And that region will never have independence as long spain stays in eu
In valencia
This is why they butted in
They protect the sovereignty of the member states
Eu is already clear about that
they wont self sustain that long
also their currency is worth nothing
gl getting silicon
remember that high tech is not selfmade
how?
Yeah
I really doubt it will escalate outside ukraine
I do not think that putin can affort an all out war with the western world, sure we import gas from them, but they import so many products from us and their currency is really weak
EU in specific doesn't have to do anything with this *until it gets damaged by having major players into nato*
Biden is not useless
someone is underestimating Biden's ability to go trigger happy
Also
no i am not.
you're dismissing NATO's monkey power too much
it's not the same thing.
China took a neutral stance.
is not collaborating
China
Embargo can be really harsh on Russia
I'm with kat in this one btw
and it will be done again
we did it in the past
we can do it
exists
Commercial Trade War
Europe gets the damage? then it goes up
What i just said
Yeah i know
Oh it would be interesting to see that happening
G7 leaders making these comments do not help
At least it shows that china wont help putin confirmed
This was so unexpected that it's sending shivers down my spine
Holy shit really?
Is legit
Well i think that G7 statement about "putin is on the wrong side of history"
Woah that's something, even the taliban understand
this is bad
https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2lo9f/important_russians_are_planting_mines_inside/
uuuuuuuuuuuh
Italy gave out 110m € to arm ukraine
They will need a round 2
Meeting just ended
It seems that the diplomatic
Urkaine is preparing official request to join EU
It's a war crime to hit telecommunication infrastructures
War crime detected
Shooting on civilians is bad
But uuuh
You could put it under spoiler
It's complicated when they are throwing molotovs tho
War
Rakhi what is your take on the situation
Steam is rejecting russian requests
I approve
This is something
Ooooh
Is unexpected
Wow russia getting pushed back
Private Military Contractor, mercenaries for short.
Russia economy is back to caveman
and once SWIFT goes
The western world is depriving russian populace from several good services
There is no war without suffering
All kinds of war are bad
Exactly
Lank *something something* 3%
The sanctions are aimed at weakening russia as a whole and incite unrest
We trade war.
People it's 2020s
I am all in for sanctions
Poor odessa
lost or won
Russia gonna suffer this for decades
my friend said this
But also "this is happening because our oligarchs are fucking around"
It's the freaking swift system that will go out of the window
Also this time is not "just a sanction"
Days ago
Someone here talked about 3% revolt
Not to sanction, but to the fact that russian population is not as powerless
You want me to spell it out again? Nothing is black or white. It's all grey. I was referring to something else.
Different eras
Different contexts
Lank, past is not present
Sure, but history is our teacher
So the reasoning about the avg citizen suffers eeeh, they can do something about it, unrest is the word, they can always rise up and mass revolt. These are the descendants that cleared out the tzar family
https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/italy-steps-up-freezing-assets-linked-russian-oligarchs-2022-03-05/
and sequestered
have been reported
an huge yatch and a 11m$ villa so far
some russian oligarchs holdings here
or sequestering
btw we are requisitioning
yeah i guess
it's still positive
Even if china is doing this for their roundabout gain
Recovery is still a thing that happens, but russian economy wasn-t strong to begin with
Isn't that illegal?
Oh come on seriously
Can't wait for russian oligarc holdings getting auctioned
I don't recall it being a moldovan one
Uh?
Russia has already fired upon romania's ship
Has turkey ships
But black sea
That's for sure
And they're pushing for diplomatic resolution
Turkey is a nato member
Uuuh Russians want to bombard Odessa
This is so dystopic...
I heard the news, russia going full dictatorship with internet shutdown/massive controls/runet
*something something european federation*
For instance europe should become more 1
Would be macroblocks
I think that the first step for world gov
politician talking about "we need a world unified government, UN needs to have its own forces and to increase its influence"
Ridiculous
Wtf zucc?
so yeah that post is propaganda
same for hungary
is that the timing is wrong.
the sad fact about this vote
keeps breaking EU Regulations
without break
continuously
Poland
Imposed by Russia
Btw it seems that latvia is suffering from the internet halt
It's because of the trade war and propaganda
Because it would escalate the conflict
Nato can't go all out for supplying (poland's migs that got denied)
Is actively sending funds
Yeah Europe
Freaking daylight savings
I want such bill here too
To decide on their own
And eu did drop eu wide daylight savings giving free leeway to member states
No it is not necessary
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg0OWPjdLzU this is a good video that explains part of the political lore behind whats happening
I know who gwyn is dw. Rip, i did not talk much with her but i hope she didn't suffer during her final moments. My deepest Condolences
Ah....
Who are we talking about? Sorry if i ask
Hmmm i can't find intel about this either, but i can see this happening under the rug
see ya later
well i shall go to lunch now
y
they still had to be examined
I don't like that take, commission just allowed amazon to proceed
*received clearance*
The completion of the transaction comes two days after the Amazon-MGM deal received clearance from the European Union’s antitrust regulator, which “unconditionally” approved Amazon’s proposed acquisition of MGM, in part because “MGM’s content cannot be considered as must-have.” The European Commission, in its antitrust review, found that the overlaps between the Amazon and MGM businesses are “limited.”
by the commission
well it was ruled out
tho we got this https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/strategy/industrial-alliances_en
lel
hmmm i think that's a big take
he believed to go monke
https://www.cityam.com/mark-zuckerberg-and-team-consider-shutting-down-facebook-and-instagram-in-europe-if-meta-can-not-process-europeans-data-on-us-servers/
for his bullshit
remember who is lynching zucc
EU Antitrust policy is developed from Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

Article 101 prohibits anti-competitive agreements between two or more independent market operators.

Article 102 prohibits abusive behaviour by companies holding a dominant position on any given market.
and some cases can escape
of course nothing is perfect
is like the most powerful on the planet
EU antitrust
to eu court of justice
but several situations have been upscaled
in italy there have been cases where the government actively butted in
Depends on the member state
the downside is over-regulation of everything
unchecked
these megacorps can't do random stuff
this is why it's a bless to live in europe
Also getting a govt job is less easy than it sounds
start with hobbies
and the things you're interested into doing
Always remember that your life is yours, having a government job doesn't mean you can't dedicate your life to other directions
That's illegal
I really hope they are not sequestering her
But let me say that claiming her dead is fucked up
As far i understood over the time the situation is really delicate and private
I am glad as well but people please do not push melua into explaining
so you could do both while you try to get it
And putin is a war criminal
Russia, at the rate it's going, will lose much more than it would gain
Is the word
Pyrrhic victory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIqsDDrUuc8 this is so... idiotic
The video is serious and it describes a bad trend going on on Tiktok, people posting fake war footage and thus spreading fake posts. It's enough for #russia or #ukraine to be on the hashtags to get viral, dumb algorythm. The worst of all? people are believing the stuff it's showed in their face.
(and hi sub)
sadly
Humans are like that
i'm missing intel here
care to elaborate?
Hmmm
(everyone hates the gobbos)
okay this smells like "someone ran out of ideas"
the heck
really?
i lost you completely lol
???
what mel?
Cremlin leader, explain us your censorship propaganda combo going on in your countries
he's rambling randomic things
is clearly fried
putin brain
Sweden is joining NATO
we evolved since then
i agree definitely.
yep
ah
stronk?
that's not how it works, damn putin
this is outright stupid
https://twitter.com/sumlenny/status/1508434384222892042
as putin increases his gorilla shenanigans
Fun how the West is becoming more and more united
Yep
The mine was used in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine where Ukrainian civilians helped to clear the mines from roads.[1]
And stop it
These can cripple a tank threads
But that super bad
Hmmm i see your point
But if they are
I think that with care you can clear them
Humans aren't heavy enough to trigger these
Y
Or some stuff on that tier
I think these are anti tank
Exactly
They wont explode that easily
If these are not anti personnel mines
coz censorship and propaganda
outside the borders
are russians not knowing what the hell putin is doing
the issue
https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13392-A-digital-euro-for-the-EU_en
a friend of mine brought my attention to this
banned cookbooks
no comment.
https://mid.ru/en/press_service/video/brifingi/1808254/
i will say no more.
maria, i will step out but that was really extremely unkind
but malwarebytes really rarely fails
then yeah you can do a recovery to a certain date
and let it do a deep rookit scan
download malwarebytes
with these scams
again that crap_
there are better ways to say things but that is not a good one maria, thus said i can understand what you mean
Kerrik there is a limit
Is high end budget
Even with gpu inflation
Is a lot
2000€
I can't elaborate further rn
I am busy at work
Keep thinking that way
What do you think happens once the country defaults?
And leftovers
Russia rn is runnning only on propaganda
Rady
Into smaller countries
It may even split
And manpower is not infinite
There is a limit how much propaganda can do
Too huge to be handled like the fat boy does
Russia is not nk
No
Buffer country*
Rus is huge and a different ballpark
Nk is such because cn needs a proxy country to prevent sk from americanizing its own populace
Not bar it from happening
That can only delay the situation
When a country defaults. Shit explodes in the rulers face
Nah i don't
Anarcho communist?
If the chemical weapon thing gets confirmed well, the road narrows
Prob it is a bit extreme but i just don't see putin coming out unscathed after this
Is that russia has the potential to become a lawless territory after the war ends
What is a bit scary
a banking crisis, as banks have to make write downs on credits given to the state.
an economic crisis, as the interior demand will fall and investors withdraw their money
a currency crisis as foreign investors avoid this national economy
there are only 3 of the effects it can have
is not something too be underestimated.
a Country Default
Regarding today discussion
Thinking too much about that kind of things is wasted brain power, put it like that
...
https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1514167823458881538
Figured
https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/u3c4ig/russian_warship_went_and_fucked_itself_megathread/
it defies logic lol
to do terrorism on russia
Ukraine has no forces to spare
this is ridiculous
since 2021
Italy is also pushing it
and member states are upping the army budget
now the necessity is arising
the idea since 2018
Macron is pushing
an unified army
Also putin caused EU to wake up and start working towards
sovereignity
member state
EU protects
free egg
and hey
i can say that i'm agnostic (after a certain point i started to pose questions to myself), i'm in the celebrations because it's fun and nice
in a catholic family
i've lived my whole life
pretty chill
lmao
and trust me political debate is much more 🔥 than religious one
let your dad be what he wants
i think one should be free to believe what they want
and passing for hebrews
it's easter for christians
yeah
Freaking hungary
mb
hm yea lol
that's what i'm trying to say
is the mirror of a culture
and the law
the issue there is in the law itself
highly debatable
being twisted and cursed
that's US system
for trying to resist
look at hungary/poland getting lynched by sanctions
Trans rights are imposed by EU nowadays
the spectrum of reasons is huge
"Today in Italy, women can request the voluntary termination of pregnancy within the first 90 days of gestation for health, economic, social or family reasons."
from the website of our ministry of health
i straight up google translated the first 2 lines
since way before he rose to power
but the abortion is legal
yes he is
we got the pope here.
**italy** has legal abortion in the first 90 days of pregnancy
somewhere
i still can't believe US has illegal abortion
miami intensifies
so i will go there from now on
but i found a really great private specialized doctor who asks 80€
i pay them 50€ by the nhs
i need eye visits because of myopia once/2 year
yeah taxes basically
after 2-3 months
the only time i needed an ambulance (broke my knee) they made me pay 80€
i was like WHAT?
"we called an ambulance, they asked us 3000$"
when you told me
i still remember
pretty much
lmao
America doesn't have welfare
you have to be smart at deploying it
Yeah this is the thing about welfare
100%
nhs covers it
from now on
my mother just got a list of 30 different meds and exams that she will not pay
and money go lost into nothingness
many people abuse our welfare
i'm stating the truth
was that now? lmao
it's more that, it's abused
no it's not lower end of welfare
it's cataract
it's not super urgent so she will wait
my mother needs an eye surgery they told her "public way = 2 years", private = pay up and we can operate in 2 months
italy, the NHS is huge here but it has conseuqnces
can span around years
here waiting lists in public healthcare
they tried but there is just the void there
Still no one got past that point red
he becomes ultra rich afterwards
the tracks go into oblivion after he visits a ranch in sicily
his source of power and wealth
people tried to track down
he restored the right wing that was politically suppressed
him^
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FBMwRggXEBQdUPW.jpg:large
yes
is inspired on him
Giovanni from pokemon series
that they had to renew old head state
and everyone went so hardcore in disarray
till he retreated last day
his magnitude is so great that every politician went in panic when he said "i aim at that chair, it is mine"
at 84 years old.
and he was having a shot to becoming head of state last year
3 times.
he has been prime minister
the biggest politician italy had in recent times, centre right, enterpreteneur richer than trump, putin friend apparently (they hang out a lot and exhanged medals frequently)
Silvio Berlusconi is the keyword
Italy changes in the 90s ella
but the same is for fascists, one of them got even disbanded by law
italian communist party never goes past 0,5% (bar is 3%)
there is nothing left
anyways other than the soc dems and that socialist party
because they had enough
tfw liberals and nats become one
so yeah politically the country is divided into 3 macroblocks
because half of them are a detatchment
That pink line moves when the socdems speak
if i say, they count nothing?
do you believe me
err
a detatchment of the socdem
+
Socialist italian party
those 3 on the right are allied
fun how: populist party spawns
> right wing goes into one giant block
are*
so people is losing patience at them
soc dems are ancient in italy
is the ugly populist party.
the yellow
senate and deputies
rn
our chambers
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Italian_Senate_current.svg/230px-Italian_Senate_current.svg.png
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Italian_Chamber_of_Deputies_current.svg/230px-Italian_Chamber_of_Deputies_current.svg.png
is basically social democrats
the centre left party we got
who tried a shot to politics.
its founder was a *comedian*
but not ruling.
so yeah it's a decent opposition party
even its existence is dumb, it's divided internally, they know only to protest, when put to power they only failed
**and failed**
they even got a chance to get to power
It's just a dumb party in our case
italy lost the liberal/conservative tag, the right wing blurred into one giant block (3 in 1), other than that there is 1 centre left party and 1 populist (dumb) party who claims to not have a color
paid by nhs
also since 2020 italy has free (you still need examinations to get the pass) hrt
as a non trans person i still think it's a great thing that we recognize these things
that's not how he got to be PM the first time
by making good deals with north africa
he is cushioning the damage from gas prices going up coz of war
Infact Mario Draghi (Current PM, not elected by people) must stay there or we go boom
and thatt worries me because no one got skills to be a pm rn
the issue is that the country will go in shock when he will die because there is no one who held that much influence
since it was handwritten register
but he lost that one
Morocco
lmao
that too
are monstrous
and as politician
his skills as enterpreteneur
but this is the thing
there are lots of people liking him
he is a celebrity, not a politician
he is still a member of eu parliament nowadays
in 2003
he was president of EU council
eh
between european powerhouses not wanting him anymore
we got conversations.
he lost his place in 2011 because he got boicotted.
Let's be honest on this
and coming an hair short to become head of state
holding 8% in parliament
but he is still influencial
third and last is 2008-2011
2001 2006
second mandate
as pm
(a mandate is when he goes up to power)
second one
94-95
first mandate
streak
it was not in strak
in the 90s
first mandate then
he haas been PM more than one time
yes because
he is a "legend" in the european union
see? millhi understands
yes
but the man is huge.
and other stuff i honestly don't recall
but yeah he got administrative sanctions
the deal kickstarted her road of success
the girl is from morocco and now is a celebrity because of that trial
to **fix the date of birth of those 3 weeks**
He went straight at the place where the girl was registered
You know how he was dodging it?
a 17 years old (3 weeks far from the 18 mark) had sexual intercourses at the place and got paid for it
in milan
at his huge mansion
was when there was an infamous party
the other trial he got
and still failed
so they went down hardcore on him
*every judge in this country* hates him
Pay attention to this detail
"won"
and he won the cause
(3 main italian channels)
(mediaset)
of his huge media company
they prosecuted him for a false balance
on what basis?
same goes for the other end of the spectrum
I also dislike overusing the "fascist" term, because it is a very specific ideological set
58.2% - 8.3% = 49.9%
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so i guess
on french politics
well i don't have that deep insight
still yeah better than le pen rn
but i see what you mean
so it's not 16% the needed difference
she would have won
if she had 8.3% more
yes but
explain this to me?
hm?
but france is a presidential republic so that matters less
on a thin line
it means running a government
but that 8% is a close call
and i guess that's for the better, le pen would be a bit too much counter-productive for current european situation
are these the final results?
Assuming the war lasts long enough
As defective as it is, this smells of gunho murrican high noon free market
This wouldn't have happened in EU
France also
"Stamp Duty Reserve Tax"
<@250295696714891285> UK has FTT
probably the damage would have been even greater
spain boom
portugal boom
italy boom
i think 2011 because the escalation was huge there
my opinion
but hey this is of course
i assure you
2011 maximum
it runs because magic
€ is the most complex currency in the world
it was a bubble doomed to explode
eh
the world would be different nowadays
if you remove bill gates
it doesn't delete his past deeds
Just because he did a wrong thing
Wanna start a business? good remember to pay the gov the bare minimum of 1 grand/month even if you make 0 profit
italy has insane taxes
but i am not surprised
i didn't know
our^
The tax is intended to be imposed on: [52]

transfers of ownership of shares, other participating financial instruments and representative securities; [53]
transactions in financial derivative instruments and transferable securities; [54]
HFT. [55]
it's internal
rn
Tho we have FTT
1923-2004.
that italy had a tax on exchange contracts
Do you know
now now we are talking the same language
And i like that idea tbh
FTT in 2011
EU Proposed
Competition.
race against eachother
To make it work the system needs to make these billionaries
this is why anything can be a grey zone
there are families eating out the war
not only to execs
which give jobs to common people.
but this is fueling the big gun producers
we can claim that ukraine needs to defend self sovereignity all we want
let's take Ukraine war
it would make the system circulate
if these billionaries actively reinvested
but finance and economics are complicated
i know it's a lot more complex and intricate than this
poof, we have a problem
of that gold
imagine if enterpreteneurs had bought little quotas
but for example taking the gold ship sinking
i can agree with you fen
it's worse than current one
we don't
can't we
you can claim it's fake all you want, but we can't go back to caveman barter
and everything started exploding in a chain reaction full fashion
was kickstarted by greece going "Muh fake balance"
or better
2008 happened
Gun overlords are rejoycing right now
It also caused other nato members and eu to raise armaments budgets
Nah i did reread it, it's a thing that control businesses and not private citizen
Whatever the purpose is, still ends up with money being donated, is an incentive
ugh
Denmark one is really dangerous, creditor rates the debtor
ah ok ok, handbrake, it's for businesses
come onnnn this is against the concept of privacy
Sweden Credit Score is ultra scummy
uuuuh
nah.
it's okay vs businesses, but vs physical people?
lol
it's also really really hypocritical vs our own GDPR laws
as a concept
yeah that's something i also dislike
oh and denmark
do that
in europe only Norway, Germany, Ireland, Sweden and UK
ok ok now i got what is
AH
shit?
rating
oh you mean these agencies
fico?
it's a delicate idea
uh, that's a kind of censorship
good luck evading bozo
= tracked
since transactions are increasingly digital
and it would be even more powerful now than in the past
it's a freaking great idea the more i think on it
no one else it seems
So yeah UK, Italy, France Sweden
and sweden
Sometimes things are complicated because it is us who decide they are like that
"I don't lie, i am not just telling the whole truth" but as i said, your choice, your principles, i ain't going to criticize.  Now i think you shouldn't overbrood this, humans make mistakes every day of their life. What's broken can be fixed, i think you should just talk it out with the people in question.
But anyways what's done is done
My only tip would be to allow yourself some exceptions
But i guess each of us is its own personality
But it is not a smart move either
No one is saying it is wrong
Since the dice has been cast and can't be recasted
I am not trying to reprimand you
Omitting is not lying is just not telling
It smells like dropping the anvil on your own foot
Hmm, why did you even tell them you had a gaming session?
I wont give much advice, but allow me one question, you told them you put leisure ahead or they just assumed?
And govs here are pushing for electrical charging stations for cars
Volvo doesn't make diesel cars anymore
Already shifted tbh
Many car companies
US voting system lel
well whatever
at america
to bring him up actively, i was expressing my disappointment
i wasn't trying
but he did what he could with the people they gave him during the explorer era
and he paid for it with life
Columbus bad deeds were centered in when he was appointed as governor
Take look at history before pointing at columbus, the triangle came much afterwards
and promote crap tier policies
but then they do worse things
"Muh Columbus bad"
are just outright stupid
Some US things
it's basically what Mussolini did in italy before the war, prioritizing local production
it's just bad
but going opposite side of it
I agree with you here
we are supposed to strenghten globalization not weaken it
it's not a good thing
Exactly
To some extent yes, i'm in it with that idea
otherwise it becomes ancap fiesta
Globalization needs to of course be regulated
it's the" weird object oriented kid"
but yeah i was talking about Ruby @JP prog language
but java came up in my mind
i think i know
so discoursive
intensifies
freaking java
it still uses english terms in the keywords
and it's super weird
and it's not that popular at all
We already have a Japanese Programming language
Things is
no dw
lol isky
people just aren't used and society wont want it
promoting more children wont work
Xi has to deal with impending demographic crisis tho
it was inevitable
Putin Screwed up hard
barely bearable*
it's bearable tho
doesn't put hand on Taiwan
as long china
but then they take retrograde decisions
is that US is supposed to be the avant garde country
The ridiculous thing
Talking as if china doesn't exploit
"the west" as a block is not a superpower, elements of the west are
at the same pace
it just doesn't move
but it has downsides
That's correct
js: The EU has 24 official languages: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish.
we are too diverse
but it wouldn't work as we are used to see in nowadays example
I can surely foresee in a not so next future an European Federation
EU: infinite number of tank models
US: 1 tank model
Thing about eu army is standardization, really hard to do since we have dozens of different techs
On 28 September 2021, Greece and France signed a multibillion-euro military agreement. The Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called the idea of a European army “a mature proposal” and that this agreement could be a first big step towards a European army.[23]
last update before russian - ukranian conflict
We share laws, trade agreements, freedom of travel (an EU citizen can live wherever in the union), in the future it will have an Army
not a country
European union is an economic block
germany 4
italy 15
france 7
No but UK is like 5
https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/rankings/power
I have to go to bed now, can't continue the discussion got work this Sunday morning

It's just that there is a neutral stance behind it, but eu told israel more than once that they do not agree
I invite you to research better
Opposite standings
Israel is one proof
It's not us
With US
Of course, but EU for as much it cooperates
Except the west is continuously infighting, it becomes one on external matters
It would be rather hypocritical for me to not do so
It's sad but it's a fact
Yeah humans exploit one another since the birth of civilization, that's nothing new
And i don't know how you managed to steer the conversation onto exploitation instead
Depends on the contract
... the abortion could be necessary exactly because a woman might be too immature to grow a child
Goddamn it
Imagine a poor sexual assault victim getting denied abortion because of dumb lawmakers
Us 🤌
Sadly
And that also pushed uk to leave eu
With the 2010s waves
This is what happened here
And fuel baseless racism
At the same time mass migration influxes can shock a system
Illegal immigration is not good because these poor people get exploited and crime lords get their bags full out of black labour
A failed crypto
Thank god they saved the man but it's ridiculous
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/106080820845887488/974270052301942814/unknown.png
yeah exactly what i meant
but sure i understand the sentiment
for the gpuopen
https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers
AMD graphic drivers
even
git is used for lots of things
so putting malicious code on git means self admitting one is doing so
when a link is from github it has to be said that anyone can see the source code
It reminds me that dumb show mtv aired, 16 years old pregnant. That show was highly meh...
Dooming 2 lifes just because one evening went in an extreme direction is excessive if you ask me
Even putting the worst case aside, imagine even a young woman getting pregnant by "mistake" and not actually wanting a child
And wrong
Is just bad
Sexual assault victim getting abortion denied
I said it above
yeah
that's dumb tho
no money can really compensate a bullet to the head like what happened in israel a few days ago
but it's still a risky joob
Surely
war reporters risking their life are to be mentioned too
it was the standard till late 2000s
yeah but newspapers that do that went down drastically
oh that's for sure
so i don't blame the idea
there is work behind the scenes
to read news
one used to need to buy newspaper years ago
one writes articles, one is free to paywall them
More than cryptobros, is the nfters that are unworthy
Yeah
Sure the term was born to define such things but if contextualized the story changes completely
Two different things
I agree with fenny here
I say this as an ex private investigator
Think to fake car accidents
Eh, see that i had some salt in my brain to extremize
For the guy
No offense
The shit, that's dumb kat
"imagine" i said
I am just extremizing
Imagine someone tried to prosecute him for that. Want to know what would have happened if he was truly baiting? He would have won the case
This is because people are too quick to draw the gun and call the shots
And self regulate
Want me to call the mods and ask them matt? Please let's not do that
....
Also we agreed to not "^" in serious. Let's not do that (i was scolded in the past for doing so)
Exactly
That was explained above
Eh
It's normal matt, how would you expect someone outside such circles to know anything about it
Thank you fenny
Exactly what i was aiming at
And it's one of the major defects of human brain and society
I said to contextualize, there is something called *inference*
No.
Let's not play 2 weighs 2 measures
It is expecially in this instance
Also why are you even discussing about a twitter account with an invented nickname and anime pic? Context is the key in all discussions matt. Wrong context kills people, starts wars and so on.
Well i am stepping out from the discussion since 3.30 am and i am awake coz i got heated by discussing. Good night
No words
Wow
If you can that's it
Now explain please
Wtf melua
Rady...
That was my dad school
Gotcha
Ah
I am surprised
Don't misunderstand me
No i am not critizing
But yeah 2500 kids is overkill, my god
By a student
Or in the same school the director got slapped during protest at the gate
Teacher got scared
They got the increase in the end
Was an entire class getting a bad grade in one subject, one of the kids getting up, stabbing a knife in the teacher desk and treatening him to increase the grades
The raddest thing i know happened in a nearby school decades ago
Yeah. That would escalate dramatically here
At school
The pregnancy caused by sex in bathroom
I guess our cultures are really that different, such thing would create an huge scandal here. Big enough to grt a raid from the mass media, a prosecution by one of the parts, and huge issues for the school itself
We had sex ed in last year of middle school
Yes but jumping to conclusions doesn't help, expecially if in a context like that Twitter account. But anyways... Where the hell did go to school at lol. I never heard such thing in my school
However this conflict will end, it will shift current direction of the human future
```Russia has probably lost a third of the ground combat force it originally committed to its invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow has little prospect of accelerating its advance in eastern Ukraine, according to an intelligence estimate from the British government.```
Yeah absolutely
That sounds like black magic if you ask me
That debate is getting increasingly stupid, i would like to ask him the difference between a rape and a normal intercourse.
Man paying for the vaccine
You are not wrong on that, absolutely
Sad as it is, this is karma coming back to bite, even if none of the two parties has ever done anything really worth to step out and put an end to that trade war
Sometimes it's interesting to remember that we could have got an ideogram/syllabic in europe system if bronze age went down the Linear B/Linear A route
yep
but the west took it as R for granted
which are both false, true one lies in between
if we take japanese we get that L-R ambivalence
can be found in greek
An example of sounds not being in other languages
chuugoku!
But you are right
Seems so alien to me
yeah that phoebe
and much less pointing at you
it's a bit rethorical
but it's ok
matt you try to read between my lines too much sometimes, it happened before
not implying you did
it's not the troops fault
eeeh
Full mobilization in 21th century on a large scale country like russia
is that NATO cannot stop, it's a worldwide important point and USA are gaining from this war each day it goes on
The thing is right now
Russia is increasingly putting itself into a corner
dw italian got 19 verbal coniugations
since becoming a merc is illegal in italy
she was interviewed on tv
in ukraine
who has a pending prosecution for having joined foreign fighters
reminds me of a young woman
this discussion
Rommel did a better job for the germans in ww2 logistically stand point and it was still a disaster imho
eh that yeah
implying that russia has a concept of logistics right now, it's all over the place
Sry
Google it, it's nothing complex but i can't delve rn
Gallium nitride is a semiconductor
It should replace lithium
By the way people, what do you think of the future of batteries based on gallium nitride
It seems it can have higher efficiency than lithium
Is already used in semiconductors
Gallium nitride
And the employer is making shit up to keep you busy
If there is nothing else to be assigned
They gave you the assignment
It doesn't
I haven't seen it happening
That doesn't make much sense
Had it happening myself
Ah I understand that case
And adding more personnel isn't always the solution
Many jobs cannot stop that long
5 years old with a smartphone...?
Or doesn't do that enough
And that's because sea doesn't regulate jobs
Only a corp can afford that fenny
Many managers do not get this concept and whine about low performance
You get employed, trained, grinded, dismissed = the enterprise will never have someone skilled enough and will have a low performance
That also damages the enterprise
Hahah ironically enough
It's human resources job afterall
And adjust the work on it
A good boss has to understand the environment around the workplace
Yeah
Sitting at a desk doesn't mean ez job
Mental jobs can be taxing
No trust me
The attitude we just mentioned damages the employer because people will exploit it by slowing down on purpose
I call that bs
We got pizza, welfare, organized crime, Mediterranean sea and berlusconi
Come to italy
Taiwan is a focal point for semiconductor industry
It's not democracy issue
In any kind of system
There will always be someone doing that

SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529
family doctor told me it's overkill to give out antivirals if the case is not bad
can fall asleep even with some pain
the first night was hell since my throat was like on fire, what lessened the symptoms is that i'm an heavy sleeper
let's be honest i had fever for 1 day and half, then it was mostly throat issues
I had COVID21 in the early of this april/late march
entirely
of course getting an eu country citizenship is another ballpark
there are just too many benefits to not do so
imho
and EU is the best option if moving out from US
of those
Ireland is the only one left in EU
but remember that language barriers also a thing
that's for sure
which is not the easiest thing nowadays
also costs money and one has to find a new job
you know what you leave, you don't always know what you will find
Relocating is always a difficult option

the guy was declared unable to think and act, put into a mental facility and was barred to ever hold a gun license in his life
those guns were legally detained
@gundiscussion
this reminds me that time my dad told me about a call his squad got (he is in mp), a panicking woman called because her husband was going crazy, he had a damn magnum and a shotgun used to kill boars in the backroom, he feigned ignorance when mp came. "I gotta go to the toilet for a min" > was going to grab the magnum and the woman called it out on my dad who just in time managed to jump on the guy who wanted to kill everybody in the room
bb guns heh
it's not normal to go into a supermarket and buy assault rifles
man murrica should really tone down the gun policy
i think i will just avoid the discussion, we will never agree
there would be no product left*
are gov workers
note: major exploiters of that system
and let's leave it at that
opinions
+1
matt that made me chuckle
i wont respond to this, damaging the business you work in because you want to go on holiday is bs
Absolutely i agree with you
and that's not good
The downside of this system? people abuse it.
we are talking of huge sum of money that can go in autowin in court
**by law** you can't be fired while you're on a paid sick leave (they can do that if you surpass 90 days, i don't remember the exact details) and they absolutely cannot do it if you're injured cause of your work
also Injury on workplace is treated by a different welfare system altogether
and government pays it, in % i don't remember
not the sick one
that's the normal leave
the thing was fully red
on second test on the 9th day i was "hyperpositive"
for legit normal contracts
this is usually the standard
🇮🇹
100% hourly pay for the first 3 days of sick leave, 75% from 4th to 21st day of sick leave, 100% again if you go 22+
*thanks paid sick leave*
happens
no seriously for some reason i tought it was general
oh wait it's serious, i zoomed sorry
it's ghostra
oooh
to work
Larger countries need some degree of decentralization
This is why i said if he wanted
If act man wanted the thing could be brought up to court
As the times advance
YouTube policies have become crappier
Gengis khan is the closest to acceptable false claim
And sa colonized by russians sounds like a dota2 meme
Columbus himself would revolt in the tomb
Wtf
Now this is an opinion from an outsider
"but the founding fathers" is an example
Usa need to change from the groud up to solve the issue
From guns
And it's pretty easy for a judge to bar you
But needs to be renewed
No nvm it is not
Here license is expensive af
In europe guns are more regulated and they are ok
Guns in us are a problem because society is used to them
Automatically calls for speculation
Vintage
This skyrockets the value of the reserved list
Seems legit so far, go on
Laws are not specific by definition, but what is the situation
What do the laws say?
anyways the discussion is not serious enough for here zoe so we might continue elsewhere eventually
to a very special kind of format?
Aren't those restricted
It's like counterstrike skins going on several grands
I don't see an issue if they want to monkey around those
But this kind of speculation is high end
Yeah ofc
also nuclear power is getting talked more lately
thing is that europe doesn't move as one
it just is imho
on many fields
but recent events are acting as wake up calls
coz mixed culture
progressive wise
Well europe is already one step ahead
prob adriatic sea
i know
off shore wind is awesome, but not applicable everywhere
i can already see some mafia family from sicily nabbing the deal
Organized crime will 100% try to put their hands in the Radioactive waste disposal.
Our main problem with nuclear anyways it's another one
on italian border.
since guess where France nuclear plants are.
that in our case the discussion of the "danger" is just meh
Thing is
are trying to push for nuclear power
In italy some political currents
at least here
Underfunded orphanages are bad
Tbf not even full us
That requires abortion else it endangers the woman
Well yeah ectopic pregnancy is a serious issue
Ah i have read
Btw ectopic?
It's 12 weeks, math pls
Wtf wikipedia
Wikipedia lists several at 12 weeks then austria  3 months.
I was checking abortion times in europe
That also
Not every woman wants/can keep a child. Plus accidents and sexual assaults are to be counted.
Abortion solves a social issue
The extreme of it can be seen in middle east but it happens here and there
Yeah
Religion has the historical role of giving some sort of common sense rules
more or less
and it's esclusive to europe
or something
it's because they're not a nation
and i never managed to make him reason
it's pretty sad that my brother has some racist ideas vs muslims
and not the majority of their population
because i am sure that it's just the worst of them acting that way
yeah it's complicated, i will never say they are all thieves
i hate inferences
ah that's the bad part
i hope you understand this as well
yeah but it's a bit hard to ask "just accept them as they are"
i am not trying to be racist vs them, infact if i meet one i would have no issues with it
That's true but it's Romani's fault as well, they haven't really set good examples, it's expecially bad here
i also would not approve full face covered burqua, for several reasons. But i don't see anything wrong with the classic one that covers only the hair, if they want to wear this one just let them
more than once
italy declares itself as laic but puts roman catholic church at one step higher than the others just by mentioning it in the constitution
Pls
You get a fine at worst
You don't go to jail rady
Even if it shouldn't exist
Also european racism is a particular argument
Yeah lol
Wtf
I missed this point
Iike welfare, job laws, even flight regulations
Or they do not do it properly
And they do not cover some important fields
Yeah but they are all over the place
Less laws means more exploiting
Yea
That post seems made by a dunce
And wtf about food and coffee
Eu has more laws
so bad
I HEARD THIS SO MANY TIMES
Citizenships, residence, census
Changing your password forces a logout

Also phone number, ulterior 2fa
but yeah recovery codes can override all 2fas

on all devices.
I mean i am super used to seeing firearms as i grew up in a mp station and my dad is mp (i saw an awp even, cool shit), but wow

Not even on a officer?

Even civil police carries a gun

seriously?
WHAT?

Rip
Shinzo abe died
I was listening radio
Uh
Member
The suspect was a JMSDF
JMSDF yeah
it's there to assist the professional judge where they can lack of competence or technical skills
during the case
the popular judge system ends up increasing the importance of the technical and legal skill of the professional judge
Ironically enough isky
during the case
Popular Judges used in Corte D'assise that have been called out by isky are different than US Jurors, they participate to the whole case, they have the same relevance of the Two "professional" judges
that our Corte D'assise and Corte D'assise d'appello (Higher grade) have two Judges and not one
it's important to note
it's not the same as the jury system
i know about that
Hold on isky
and based of the system where i am from i think that the Judge should be the only one to uptake the decision, or at least the jurors should be competent. Becoming a judge takes not only years of study but to barely become a magistrate it's an arduous path.
since i am not from US
it's just that mentally, of course, i consider a court system that *i know*
italy rakhi
And no i wasn't about to quote
rakhi
We are not in the 1800
that's the exact flaw
I don't agree
one should be able to appeal in an higher grade court
and for this reason when a judge makes a mistake
since he studied for it
than a bunch of people that are sitting there
and he is supposed to be much more competent
A Judge is supposed to follow the rule of the law
in the US
how Trial level works
I don't know
Jury can be influenced much more than the Judge
i would prefer that the Judge should be in charge
but
I admit making some mental gymnastics there
it's really bad
aren't supposed to happen.
yeah but things like this
the jury system is so wrong
legally
well yeah it's slander and defamation
like women weren't allowed to use kanji up a certain point
or at leas that's what kickstarted it
majority of the fault is due to buddhism
but before that, female feudal lords and military commanders or samurai (i know women samurai kept existing even during tokugawa) were a thing
Japan had dark times for women rights sengoku era till ww2
since 1986
they have equal employment law
nowadays japan is westernized under these aspects
rip train
holy shit it's awesome
i have seen those
i hate smart
no pls, tiny car is horrible
we are basically trying to switch the intersections into roundabouts
yeah
i don't know what to tell yu
doesn't stop
my driver experience says that the roundabout keeps circulating
you halt down the whole intersection almost
This is what i'm getting at
this case doesn't exist
worst case in a roundabout, you repeat it
do not give you precedence
also is really dangerous since shitheads
it halts down the traffic to a crawl.
Traffic lights have the hardcore defect when you turn left lank
my dad owns a car of that size, a bit smaller
When traffic gets congested, it's better to have roundabout
Haven't checked in ages
Last time i heard it they were adding vulkan support
Godot is based on opengl mainly
Unreal performs really badly on mobile
For mobile
Unity is the way
UK didn't realize how much was taking from EU and didn't want to give help regarding migrants (this was used as a battle standard for brexit)
sort of treaty, we continuously exchange information, trade, travel through seamless borders, share laws and so on
EU is basically "give and take"
Europeism
that opposes to nationalism
but that aside, it created a new movement
The alternative was continuous warring continent
and EU is an huge humongous treaty
are like that.
International treaties
so far the only 2 members of eu resisting in the LGBT matter are poland and hungary
but we can roughly divide it in macroblocks
EU is not one nation because of cultural salad
why
Finally
Go figure
But now that kw cost is rising people are running to build plants
No certificates no work
Hell there are precise regulations regarding the installer
With tax frauds and related
Since they have the secondary aim to check citizens
You can't scam government on ecobonuses
It's not money first
Ah to be clear
Govt fell coz 5 stars didn't want waste to energy plant near rome
"they have to be this way"
Or pay a fine even
Penality you don't get the money
Govt gives out precise rules on this matter
We have the issue of being one of the most terrified nations of europe regarding nuclear
On your house
Currently govt pays 60% of the total price to build a solar plant (can be boosted to 110 in some cases)
But meanwhile we can't just drop gas
And it will continue to do so
A lot in recent years
Is giving out incentives to build solar plants and boost electrical efficiency
Government
The very bad part about this is that draghi is very skilled and he was conducting good deals to buy gas from north Africa
As long as i can respect political ideologies, that one has just damaged the country over the course of 10 years
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/20/italys-mario-draghi-expected-to-resign-as-prime-minister and there we go, political disaster inbound. At least it means we will get rid of populists.
And put into civil service instead
When mandatory draft was a thing people declared themselves conscientious objectors
someone else will just take their place
this is actually positive and negative at the same time
almost 1:1
1,02
yeah
nvm it's the same
actually mb, gotta link in usd, eur is inaccurate
to give an idea

till something else causes them to
but it wont go over 30k
during the day
it fluctuates A LOT
And mass sales of used gpus from miners
It stabilized
Is at 21k
Rising is a big word
but not like thart
i'm in for expanding public transport
otherwise
well no one said
the nearby 355k city is completely empty at night if not in the weekend
Nightlife is not everywhere
that i can see the train full only in metropolises
[10:27 AM]
and that's really poor.
People we have to consider cost/efficiency here
if not in the aforementioned places
but come on the train running on tuesday at 2 am is just stupid
ok now that's a bit more reasonable
*not that full*
and even then
that i can see the train full only in metropolises
Fenny thing is
you *alone*
just to bring you home
Good, so the electrical company gonna waste kW and kW
not in their existence themselves
that's where mistakes were made
Cryptocurrencies could have been used in a very different way
running around just because a plan says so
i can already see a completely empty train at 2 am
is a poor solution
24 hours train network
truck you mean?
because the elements
even without cars and trucks
yes but road will wear anyways
i am sorry if i speak from my experience, but i can't use a city like melbourne as meter; the place here is filled with many town averaging on 20k inhabitants, all connected with trains and buses and main/secondary roads to main 355k city

Roads have to be maintained with or without cars lank, that expenditure doesn't get reduced that much, once it rains, asphalt goes to crap.
ofc densely populated areas have higher priority
yeah but someone has to build it
and money is not endless
govt has to build it
nor i do think it's efficient
it's always a good thing, but i don't like carpet bombing indiscriminately with it
transport
again i approve adding public
aren't eveywhere
thing is that main roads that support heavy traffic
lol rady
https://www.visitareroma.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principali-strade-di-Roma.jpg
and towns with really small roeads
what about historical centres?
that's pretty large still
am i wrong?
as i'm seeing here
also melbourne roads seem pretty large
give and take
ah yes i can already see the project getting *zeroed* because people want to use cars
Lank not every road is fit to have trams
even with all those 3 combined.
but it's still gonna take you 2 h to go place to place
but rome has buses and subways as well (+2 huge train stations)
i recall seeing those
in 2018
yes the last time i've been there
it is used in rome iirc
The important point is that *someone* has to invest into these things. Investment is not done at carpet bombing because inefficient
it doesn't work that way
and if the argument it's "you just gonna build them"
railways do not go everywhere
They cannot
Trains can't reach everywhere
but *do it smartly*
i never said expanding is negative
Absolutely rady
and you can't use wind farms where where is no wind
where it always rains
you can't use the solar panels in a place like england
Also reminder than not all green sources are viable everywhere
before that then
go invest in these sources
"just because i never tought of it"
Majority of the cases people don't ask because no one proposed
The point here lank is that running 24 hour train also costs a lot, it can see it only in big cities as i said
no it isn't
Depending on how you do it
so pick out the most proposed
these can be done in *so many ways* that's just unreal
smartest option? surveys around the area
it will end with the spending going drastically into the red
you can't tram them
anyways what about hilly places?
Are we going backwards
What the heck is that, teaching with no degree
It's insane
Man that's so 1900ish
At some point
Completely
Japan closed off borders
This is just retrograde and stupid
I think you have to be ready with a decent vpn...
Indo gov lost their mind
<@161155855524298752>
```
According to CNN Indonesia, the Ministry threatened Google , WhatsApp , and Instagram with a block, giving the corporations until July 21st, 2022 to register their URL domains, or else see their apps and websites become inaccessible in Indonesia.

The Indonesian government's reasoning behind the registration requirement is a new value-added tax on digital transactions, which would generate revenue for the government.

Do not forget that china is going to have to deal with demographic crisis in the near future
Japan liked big cannons
It worked tho, again it just never fought, it just escorted yamato once
Broom
I401 was top dog sub, it just never fought
And to remind you, japan is actively helping uncle sam into building the supercarrier
But they got pushed in that direction
Gotta search
Dropping faulty ICBMs next to hokkaido
Thanks to a fat kid in nk
Iirc
Japan reinstated attack force
And you do not want japan reigniting their warrior sense
Btw i can see sk and japan running into aid with us if we go down that road
Since china cannot encircle it
Sieging the island is also not possible
Look at britain
~~and self aware ai~~
~~and that's how taiwan fought off china with unmanned turrets~~
Taiwan is house to semiconductor fiesta, they got the cash
Which is not that far since carriers are parked at sk
I do not agree, murrica would swarm the place with their navy
i enjoy my life and my pizzas
no pls
look it's complicated
i never implied that
i don't know what to tell you, i know it's not easy
for all the time
you get paid 100% the normal wage
2 months before the birth and 3 after
is 5 months long here
Maternity leave
father one is shorter in this case
i am talking of a case where both parents took the leave
there is no reason for the father to take one of the same length at the same time
thing is, that legally if a mother took the leave
than sick leave terms
because maternity leave is longer
but different
the system is the same
yeah i implied that
we agree on that
it's not an option, they have to.
of leave
rn here by law a father is obligated to take 10 days
there is next to reason for a man to leave THAT long
hey have you in mind how long is a woman pregnancy leave?
same here
to some lesser extent but it should given as well
definitely
oh yes
legally they cannot
and the employer is barred to fire the woman during that period
this is why the govt pays the wage during pregnancy leave here
that's stupid on outer heavens levels
they already have the social point thingy dystopia wise
and doesn't escalate into anything dystopic
but yeah let's hope that china stays put in place
exactly
yep
which are mammals
we cloned sheeps
but that's debatable on morals
i'm 100% sure that human is capable tech wise to go down the clonation road
like the cloning argument
there is the ethics involved into that
it has to do with human nature
mere example is that a parliament can't be dissolved during wartime by law here
state of war is always a time where logic goes out of window rady
Obstacles to globalization are bad
Ofc they are
and yeah it's not canon
that's new testament tho
and yeeted out some books
went monkey expecially in some parts of history
thing is that roman catholic church
is hebrew one
closest legit ancient testament
some books are banned and catholic one is too much on a diet
The ancient testament of the bible is wild
censorship is bad
i hate when things like these happen
do you have a strong enough opposition to them?
no?
pis will win again
we came to know about it because the toxic waters reached germany
is avoiding the subject
Polish government
it's really sad

goddamn it poland
Bones are strenghtened by hormones
Well you can obtain this info by doing some research but it's also logical
i did not delve enough in the subject
it's that
yes
it has to do with bone density
but they're far from dangerous
with blockers
there is a little downside
ok no
I never said that they were going to grow stunted
Yep
Again, i am not against blockers, this is not enough to demonize them, but i think that a competent specialist should follow the
Young patient during this journey, along with exams to check up on health. Same for people on hrt afterall
It's more or less the concept behind osteopenia being reversible while osteoporosis is not
It surely resumes if one stops taking those but taking them for too many years carries the risk that this change may not be reversed completely
This is why there is the density loss issue
This includes bone development
All the changes brought up by hormones are halted
Note: i am not a medic or similar, just did some research but this in particular can be found on many sources
Blockers in specific are advised to not be prolonged too much to avoid bad bone density
During these processes
Check ups are really important
Yep that's also true
But it's the only true con
Now this is not a big enough deal to demonize the blockers
Think of menopausal women with bone density loss
this was ridiculous to look at

US is a clownfesta, China and Russia are autocracies
it's the closest to that ideal
i fixed that sentence
dw vyn
yep i know
it's a clownfiesta
but i can't call a two party system like US, a democracy
we will never 100%
*closest to that definition*
let me fix that
that europe is the only true democratical place on earth
let-s say vyn
yep
we got the mess in t he parliament
where i live yes
> being able to vote what i want
"western propaganda"
and it's very evil to do
this one is not to be undermined
fortress britannia v2
also we did discuss how militarly it's a disaster to invade taiwan
it's not like ucraine
Taiwan interests are worldwide's this time
thank god we don't have draft anymore

i'm curious at how NK handled covid in these condition
that's all
but yeah NK will exist as long as it serves as cushion in front of SK, to avoid americanizing CN population
well to know about NK we got those refugees
nah it's ok vyn
ok this is serious but i'm laughing rn
FIVE THOUSANDS POTATOES
goddamn the shit going on in indonesia
lank is right
Well i'm talking about Economy blocks
what lol
It's more a question of "what do you like living in?"
that's a thing of human society
yeah...
or it's all propaganda?
did they?ù
expecially in peacetime
meh, it's not like you will end up being a war criminal
many people like that life lank
same for police
to wanting to be in
is something you have to "feel"
my take on going in the armed forces
but didn-t pass exams
who would love to be in the armed forces
i know many people
last year
in scotland got pushed back
iirc independentists
but brexit.
ez
aus > british > eu
man i still think that would have been a smart move lank
well ofc
ok
i can't remember
oi does australia have a draft?
spin the globe circles
phara is from argentina
with west taiwan barking continuously at semiconductors
well taiwan has reasons to do so
that's horrible
one yes and one no?
what do you mean

for that
fat kid is too salty
this is true, the definition of normal is something one can define but there is no written law says that one must be conform to a standard

again i agree so far and i hope it will stay that way
but the slope is slippery
i agree with you that it looks like that
but if this ends up with *any* form of censorship on the platform then it's an humongous damage
Ah well yeah sure, that goes without saying
*disciplinary committee rules*

because that document *is confusing*
i'm not joking
explain better this statement
then that's meh
on an *artist website*
becomes censorship on pixiv
If that policy
144k?
but holy shit
at least here
based on the business type
bills change a lot
i hope it goes as it should
it's not mid-2000s
nowadays  i deem that a minor issue
oh surely!
i agree with you
quite an handful
but sure
prob a lot is overstatement
your opinion
but whatever
for the point i mentioned above
with lawful means, but the law is the law at the very least
of course i am not saying that they will stay put
thus create a retaliation
if it gets taken down unlawfully it will justify the website itself and rouse their self-righteousness
it creates a precedence
hammurabi died too many thousands of years ago
violence calls for violence, and violence is not the answer
i'm really against outlawed means
As much as i can hope that an harmful website like that one to be taken down by lawful means (which is the best), this doesn't mean that the userbase disappears, they will just find another nest
rip england
or am i wrong
than the other
she is more conservative
oh so the Conservative lady won?
UK's PM
it hasn't been decided yet right?
it's not that easy^
https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/breaking-international-law-peace-northern-ireland
this is not ukraine
in 2022
military force
give ulster back to ireland
yeah...
i'm assuming from the discussion
you live in NI ghostra?
different case
but yeah i agree
i've been in barcelona
even road signs are in catalan
they speak catalan
that area doesn't even speak spanish
hmm maria
bring back Eire
(this is why aragon independence is just a clownfiestaa)
thus separatism is suppressed by the treaty
EU protects sovereignity of the member states
if UK was still part of eu
note: it was even less possible
the dual system sends me shivering
i can't cope with how american politics work
they could have joined eu back
to push separatism
sad that scotland didn't manage
i see that unlikely
with truss yeah
the usual mutual existence of the member staates
and britain sharing them
before that it was mostly eu having problems
that precise moment
the fall became steeper
kinda yes but
on a freaking referendum
with that small marginù
when they decided on brexit
precisely
UK started the downfall route
So yeah to me those headlines are not written by a clown, but by a circus ringleader
we have a famous journalist here in italy that became really big, when it's time for elections and similar stuff he basically has an hours long airtime on an exclusive show (private tv), where he discusses politics and politicians with other figures. He of course ends up voicing his opinion, but he never said "vote this, vote that", because it's highly unprofessional.
No matter the political color
The newspaper going ham on the headline is disgusting
But at least you listen to opinions in these cases
With politicians
While having a political talk show
Look i understand that a showman could lean politically
Whew that's horrible, mass media should be impartial
Well kiwifarm definitely was an harmful website, good that the anti ddos company decided to drop it
yeah..
any of them
it could warp situations
for now let's see how the world changes over the power shortage
so yeah stall
and calling the shots is a bad answer for uk nowadays
uk can't proceed automatically and neither can't the opposite party
but yeah
semi*
but i see the situation as permanent stall
we agree on this point
it's not that easy
i said it above
we shall see
autodeath
and sanctions during this time period?
it's not like they caan do whatever
EU would sue them
"history"
it's a stupid website lol
but this is not history
no matter how bad
i don't like obscuring history
i feel conflicted by that
lmao that is unexpected
i aagree with maria
i meant apple phones
no no isky
since they're overpriced as shit
you pay those a lot
it's still meh
uuuh
Yeah western Europe and cold weather... A bit a thing of the past
who is the current heir to the throne?
it sounds like she is not in a good condition tho
it doesn't seem that she died so far..
ah rip queen elizaabeth
and so on
dissolving parliament, rejecting incostitutional laws, be the absolute commander of the army in times of war
a country needs a superpartes figure in case of a crisis
which is, let me say it, bad
Tru
I mean if it happens once in a while i legit can condone it
That's just rotten, working outside hours without pay/declaration is miserable
Rip
National pension is mandatory by law for freelancers here
I see isky
I am not saying that we good you bad but i am surprised when i hear this shit
Outside that is tax evasion
Occasional cooperation contract exists but it's like timecapped at 30 days/year and moneycapped at 5k/year
Basically we have continuous cooperation contract
You just do that independently since a freelancer emplyer is the freelancer themselves
Lol that still requires pension contributions here
Except for occasional contract
Any form of contract means insurance and pension here
Explain yourself better
Wait what?
That being the norm requires some serious intervention because it's rotten
God underreporting work hours is shitty af
Our president can do that too, the pm candidate who won the elections has to prepare the squad of ministers and present it to him in his office (in private, no one other than him and the pm is allowed in the room iirc). The president has the power of rejecting the proposal, ofc there must be a reason behind it
It's the nature of politics
I am not surprised if the queen forced some  laws in a certain direction
Both sign laws
Marginal powers
In the end uk crown powers are pretty similar to our head of state/president of the Republic. The big difference is that this last one is elected by the parliament on 7 years mandate
that's why he was blamed after the war and we switched to republic
Mussolini rose to power because the King of Savoy didn't stop him and allowed him to rise to power through legal means
that are needed to supervise and avoid a certain kind of fuckery
but yeah those are soft powers
that's incorrect
but in case of a parliamentary republic
In case of a monarchy that's correct
well enough with the jokes in serious
pay a visit to area 51
but i was imagining like 300-400 km
no no i got the joke
aria i think you overshot a bit
is 1004 km
boise to vegas
the shit
yep
"imma go to las vegas with mah bike"
lol imagine biking in nevada desert
plus the expense is gargantuan
small towns on mountains are a good example
but that's not always possible everywhere
but anyways the ideal would be getting an efficient public transport along with bikes
whew
take care dundi
holy fucking shit
i was thinking to 10-12 hours
that's inhumane
the heck lol 19 hour shift?
i wasn't referring to anyone in specific
i said it in general, i skimmed through the discussion, there is a tendence of doing that
yeah that would be nice
you can't ask them to bike back home after they're drained out
and our time on this planet is not unlimited, certain people have to work longer shifts than 8 hrs
let's not overrate it, it surely is great but you can't use it for everything
it's not suitable for everything
biking takes time
I can foresee Ukraine entering eu and reconstruction will happen
and costs the half of them
it's considered second only to F-35 and F-22 Raptors
as main flock
meanwhile italy soars the sky with 100+ EF-2000s
i wouldn't want to pilot in IRIAF
how that shit still fly??
Fokker F-27
oh god they use worse stuff for transport
mid air
totally super safe getting refueled in a bootleg F-5 from a 747
they use them for air refueling tho
they have 4 747
whew
the 707 is 1958
jamming intensifies
oh they got also 2 Boeing 707 equipped with nasty electronic warfare shit
so bootleg F-5

they got some spare Mig-29s
oh there is their inventory here
Iran uses, F-5s, F-4s, F-7s and F-14s
ok looking here
an F5-F crashed into a school in tabriz this february
so they still use those F14s
apparently IRIAF is having an old tech issue
Cheney defined F14D a 60s tech
as i'm reading
the main reason was grumman taken over
Iran still uses the tomcats apparently
top gun indeed
impressive
wow 2.5?
mach 1,3 capable fighter jet
the tomcat!
So what i can foresee this time around is Meloni leading the govt, with Salvini the parrot, hoping that Silvio uses his liberal cartridge to regulate the situation
(keep in mind that we don't vote the person, we vote the party, the party decides who the f they want to put in parliament/govt)
people are going to vote Giorgia Meloni because she seems to have a good shot
We got no good esponent to vote
now fast forward today
"you can vote us or us"
because centre left is a disaster exactly because it became corrupted
No to be fair, he did good into doing that
in the 90s
exploded when berlusconi unchained the right wing
italy has this thing, basically the whole political situation
was really ""fascist""
but keep in mind that AN
yep i can't blame who labels her that way
but it's a bit in the past
She got labelled as a fascists many times
but the left as whole got no chance, they betrayed everyone by shattering
i think that the only way that the govt squad doesn't go into weird directions is pushing the old silvio berlusconi even if he's gotten really old at this point
which are not good at all
problem is that her political party hosts some radical right esponents
if things go like this Giorgia Meloni might be our first female PM ever in our country
populists lost all chances to obtain something, centre left basically shattered, right wing is the only one trying to push forward in a compact manner even if they don't agree on every subject
Not russia splitting
That rolling history back pls
And thus shatter the Russian federation
Tbh? I think that the oligarchs could end up splitting russia between themselves
I more or less expect putin to be deposed by his oligarchs
The geneva convention will strike what it can after the war ends
something something a certain polish tv channel
i hope this gets pushed
https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/montenegro/european-media-freedom-act-commission-proposes-rules-protect-media-pluralism_en
good one europe
ooooo
i see
where you from?
we shall see
Meloni is pushing this forward
yes but that one is becoming an hot potato, they are complaining that EU is slowing too much on the decision
and about the pricecap on gas prices
if right or wrong
today they were yelling about the giving more guns to ukraine
because of Ukraine
that honestly all i said can go out of the window and i might be wrong
in all wings and parties
there is such chaos
1 week from now
25 sept
and how much stable M5S can stay
so it all depends on how Terzo Polo plays this shit out
make up like 3,4%
minor left parties
they are bleeding followers
the only centre left party has 20% so they can't match that block alone
so 45% is the whole right wing combined.
if we combine Lega and Forza italia they count 20%
making Fratelli D'italia the biggest party right now
right now give meloni to have 25% alone
some surveys
Lega + Forza Italia + Fratelli D'italia
the right wing can push meloni to the top, and they seem the only united block of parties
but situation escalated
well i can't exactly tell you "the taxist was wrong"
alright
if i may ask
what part of italy was that?
too many esponents tried to clown
in a span of 1 month
i'm asking because situation drastically changed
when was that?
hell even empty vote is better
in our case is bad
but each electoral system is different
i wasn't attacking you or something
i know
it's wrong to not vote in our situation
italy got no quorum for elections
Not voting at all = you are voting the majority
for the first time
i will probably vote void this time around
**tl;dr i don't like current situation, we got nothing worth to vote**
before it was only the chamber of deputees 18+
right now people under 25 years old can vote the senate too
otherwise meloni will be a loose cannon
that's quite a lot
COnsidering that the gustav could shot a bullet every 19 mins
Fort Stalin, Fort Molotov, Fort Siberia and Fort Maxim Gorki were completely destroyed by the cannon
was used
The city where Gustav 800mm cannon
but crimea could be lost
well those will stay memes
no matter the cost
uncle sam is just not going to let them win
on that front
Russia is getting rather desperate
Gj!
But keeping savings is always good (as a fellow money saver)
What you can buy today for 10k you wont be able to buy tomorrow
Because money in deposit loses value due to inflation
Just watch out
but cough persisted
i was without fever from the 5th day
fever lasted 3-4 days
stop this
and friends
freaking putin
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/09/21/russia-partial-mobilization-putin-war-ukraine/
i was tested negative on the 17th day
but i had this coughing fit for 16 days if not more
then it improved
my superior respiration tract was on fire
just the first night
Personally i had a really bad time
As a person who had covid, the important thing is to keep the symptoms under observatin
i hope you're ok now
It's really sad that people that can't understand the word "enough" exist
we dont have a definite left wing anymore
remember that this is centre-left
ah ye
is a coalition of 3 parties
remember that big blue
numbers of the seats
Italian senate current results:
Happens
that post
lmaoo
comiket is the 1# worldwide
ye that list is what the heck?
it's not anime only mind you
in 2018
had 250k paying visitors and 500k+ total visitors
started in 1993 with 28k visitors
it's an international convention
it's arbitrary
italy got lots of weebs solo, reason why 2nd biggest comic/anime/convention of the world is here
prob she doesn't even know
they are fanmade
they got resumed because she won
btw those 2 pics are quite old
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63057966
of course made on purpose
oh i remember that
under comiket page^

in the post covid era
now of course all the rankings are to be revisited
and it would make sense then
prob it's anime only list
yeah isky
well it got no coverage here, people too much busy with post election stuff
hold shift all the time
and click shutdown button
keep shift pressed
in the windows logon page
i don't know if that still works
F8 during boot

scan (active) is a base thing
Premium on MBytes just allows you to activate the passive components
it's alright, you're pumped with adrenaline rn
"noob ™️ "
i know it's serious but:
yep it's microsoft account
i can't really help you on this
remember what you did last time
msoft account
is the safe mode login
email account password
uuuh
rootkit = backdoor
and see what happens
first
i would do normal
it's your email acc pass
this happened last time as well
all i can say is "should", i'm not gonna lie
if you went into restore
i would still do a normal scan at least
you used for safe mode
you can do by using the same method
before logging in
then run that restore so you can be more safe
to an x date before
alternative is, run a system restore
remember how it doesn't load drivers?
to the internet
expecially if you aren't connected
in safe it should be probably safe
it's not my place to reprimand you but you gotta pay more attention to what you download
while doing that
go rootkit at this point
i'm not trying to dismiss you or anything
i understand that
go rootkit
wanna go safe?
since i don't know what infected you
why me, sigh. i can't say
the rest seems fine
up to you, if you want to rootkit scan
k
happened
also mind you that system restore
check quarantine
they got probably removed
yeah but it's not like we can let him do what he wants
it's not like i want to get there
they got too much to lose from pressing that button
in that exact moment
but i have the feeling that his oligarcs would stop him
and he starts launching nukes
The only true danger that russia can pose is if the last cog in putin's brain gets fried
of course any move is done will have some degree of backfire
before going down that road
they had to remove the veto priviledge to russia
they got priorities backwards
This is why i said
the problem
it's their right to veto
that's not even needed
then you do this.
first we have to keep russia from the right to veto
UN you got this backwards
https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1129102
again i can't say anything to that
i'm sad to hear that your police force is that corrupt
yes
yep broom is right, you need a big show of force to do that
"Police too slow, incompetence"
and will still cause death
That is doable depending on where the thing is happening
Of course not, you go from the pan to the fire
there is no correct answer
This is why i said
i can't say anything to that
ah well that's an issue of corruption
There is no win
Tear Gas: Police induced mass panic and people died
Doing Nothing: Police is useless, they did nothing to stop the brawl, people died
So is doing nothing
THere is no correct answer in such situation
Doing nothing will still make deaths
is real
then intervene, but then the risk of arriving to late
was make people evacuate
what they could have done
make them scatter
you have to disperse the people
look fenny i'm not trying to turn you down, but stopping a riot requires something more than that
What makes you think that cold of water blasts are less dangerous than teargases?
but it poses the question: "how do you handle that then?"
mind you i'm not saying "Police did the right thing"
and it's really hard to manage when something goes wrong
it is a risk of big gatherings
people being trampled upon, lily
it's not easy to manage situations like that, there are choices to be made
route
issue is that he will surely pick the "Muh those are my territories, i am only defending mother russia"
And that's the important part
for obvious reasons
but the hard fall is on proof of stake
correct
yep
Ethereum is not proof of work anymore
this is why
Proof of stake
well fenny, opinions are opinions, i shall respect that
the owner of the disco place is in jail rn
exit collapsed and people got crushed.
people went into mass panic towards the exit
it happened a similar situation here, there was this disco place filled over capacity for some trap event, someone tought it was cool shoot pepper spray through the vents
yeah...
and is over capacity
This happens when the place can't hold the evacuation
His oligarchs are surely deranged but at somepoint something is going to crack
i believe that option 1 is the most probable
and no one will give a shit about any argument given
till the unrest builds up so much that it goes down the upheaval route
over and over again
one thing is explaining "why my son had to die on the frontlines"
and the various views
also one thing is convincing people about the state of a country
they're not all the same
There are types of propaganda
there is only so much you can lie to your citizens in 21th century
not only logistical but also "Propaganda runs out"
it's not sustainable under cascades of reasons
cannot go too long
This is why i always said that this war
Freaking putler
My god that thread
It's financial times btw
Sorry i didn't know
Without paying
I opened the article just fine
What
China economy slowing down
This was inevitable
https://www.ft.com/content/e9e8c879-5536-4fbc-8ec2-f2a274b823b4
yeah sadly
I agree they were incompetent/not caring
To what they were trying to do
It's counterproductive
We discussed this the other day, that shit is really hard to handle, but locking the gates is wtf
Of course a crush happens
The locked gates part is the brainrot
https://www.sacurrent.com/news/san-antonio-police-officer-fired-after-shooting-unarmed-teen-at-mcdonalds-parking-lot-30019308
ah wait hold on
Most powerful weapon of USA eh
2) the suspected suspect was not even armed
1) he got wrong suspect
yes lol
you call reinforcements to chase it down
you don't fucking shot fire on a car that you suspect has a criminal in it
what the actual shit did i just see?
https://twitter.com/LPofDelaware/status/1577998706737029120
what the shit lol
Putler's birthday is on the 7th October
https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1578606553623662592
or not
i hope for the best about them wanting to sue you
humanly you did good
I was like "why are they even rejoicing"
Yep lol my bad
And i did even open the article, sorry there lol
For some reason my brain defaulted at "i did a good deed, i ripped off the thing and called it a day"
Good one
It was me missing a point there
Okay
Well okay have it your way, but either i am missing something, either the deed was irresponsible. Hands up, have a good day
Depending on the laws
For that act
That family might be sued further
How is that a good deed exactly? Utility service companies are not blind
2 things may be going on: 1) russia is making shit up
2) they don't have a clue
yep
they screwed up
so it was not the same truck
the truck was carrying freaking ABS plastic
they don't
thbat's the point
why it doesn't surprise me
https://twitter.com/OAlexanderDK/status/1580086370487267330
ty
ah
what is RT?
on this
referring to your first take
I was infact
with or without anime
that has roots in what the society is
it's a deeper issue
i'm trying to say
since some stuff actually acts as social tampon
but it's a too much complicated matter to reduce it to "Lol, anime and pedos"
since there is one
I don't think anyone is not recognizing the issue
Japan is a sexually oppressed society. Some shit tends to happen, look at the train wagon reserved to women because of sexual harrassment
Yes but there is no reason to do that
sadly
Matt, do you recognize that this kind of things happens in any context? Just because the person in question is an anime/game music composer it doesn't change anything
i always say, do not rush to conclusion till the judge says so
Then he gets declared as innocent.
This is not ok-corral
as the fact is too fresh.
btw apparently Hidekazu Tanaka hasn't been prosecuted yet
but not everyone does that
and stop spouting nosense
Then people of course are supposed to grow up
absolutely
thank god my country has constitution forbidding referendums vs international treaties
too many cons vs very few pros
the worst one of 21st century
Brexit was a mistake
x_x
and we are in XXI Century.
hell let's remember that JK business damn exists in japan
circles please
but there's nothing to glorify
people tend to glorify it
Japan is far from perfect (as human creations are after all), they have many issues, nationalism, ijime (bullying which evolves in full blown mobbing in workplaces), karoshi, this one we are talking about and so many more
but this issue is deep and found in every context in japanese society
the entertainment industry is what we *get to know more*
but anyways
i'm trying to follow circles train of thought
but i will register it as such if you wish so
well not my fault if you *joke in serious*
what the actual shit did you make me watch
It's so sad to hear this stuff in 2022
<@411556790925393921>
This is disgusting
https://www.euractiv.com/section/media/news/polish-state-tv-instigates-hate-campaign-against-brussels-journalist/
at least that one was credible
this is worse than that time when a war scene was broadcasted with the AC130 footage from call of duty
????
eire taking a good step i see
yep that's sad
it happens
no i don't believe that
putting lifetime aside
should be rehabilitation
prison final aim
if he's in the clear, he only risks the capital invested
you can't really sue him if he followed the law, tho i know it might not be the case here
while the administrator is responsible
the shareholders risk only the part of the capital that's been invested
People always remember how a share corporation works
Company defaults? he doesn't risk anything else if not fraud cases
of a company
zucc is the CEO
keep in mind
but
the slower the fall can be
the bigger it is
before it's all lost
tho the smart option is always retirement
there are so many circumstances where you can fall from grace
that's a bit false
(turkey is the safest white meat, but even then)
also meat every day rises choresterol, and white meat tends to be pumped so it's not safe either
also fish is an alternative
but it's ok 2-3 times a week max
i am the first one against eating meat every day
since imported
infact shroom prices are much higher off-season
also shrooms are a thing of the fall
you need to maintain greenhouses
but in othern eu some veggies are just not accessible
since mediterranean diet
I eat plenty of veggies
i give it a couple of years
take it sooner
btw while nothing can really match a real artist, AI art can only improve as the models train more and more
there is one model trained on *daaboru*
it all depends on the model used
ai boob art is not bad
Also sub is right
Mining iirc
look at dynamite
AI is something that the human being has to create, and with every invention there the good and the bad
and then you're fucked
you get detected by infrastructures
it's faster to hire an hitman
Drone regulations are so damn strict that's only an headache
overstating how drone work
they will never use them
it's bad for economy
aria
Capitalism hates nukes
and it's going to get only bigger
https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/yknrjt/list_of_sd_tutorials_resources/
btw this is how developed is Art made on stable diffusion models
(even if stable diffusion has been made to run on AMD cards and processors as well, it's still the fastest on nvidia because of the CUDA cores)
some people buy high end nvidia graphic cards only to let the ai train all the time
Don't be surprised if some other entrepreneur pops out and makes a twitter clone for the people to migrate upon
yep
ww3 would start way before that
ofc it's hard to believe he will ever push that button
that a nuke could fail and explode on his head while launchin git
is that his nuclear arsenal is so old
you know what is scary
until they face it
Reality is always something that one doesn't 100% get
lel
even if it's true that the western world comes from the very foundations of what the roman empire gave us, Italians are not citizens of the roman empire
poof
suddenly.
🤡
THAT
YES
btw that whole talk is an insult to human intellect
well he's the one with his men on the battlefield
wtf
"it's planned hysteria"
same reaction
YE LOL
??????
russian propaganda
????
"we lost 1914-1918" , "NO! we won 1914-1922"
sorry for summarizing
no no he said roman empire lank
no it's fucking blantant
ye
in a flick
he skipped from 400 ad to late 1800 ad
that video
Russian propaganda
???
"Rome disappeared into nothing, Italy suddenly appeared"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFClOV4iQMY
btw a much more solid video about the propaganda going on in rus
that i wouldn't put my hand on the flame
i did say
and the birthrate is low
the video points out how the russians are mass escaping russia
i watched it yesterday
i wont say it's right or wrong but it's not surreal at all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1WFrsz4g14 i find this video pretty decent
so it's not like nothing happens
and "relieves" the parents from the care
but i can assure you that social service hardcore butts in here
punishing minors
<@722121666641133608> as i was saying, it's a really complex argument
it's mainly the employees and secondary the other shareholders
again for the 5021th times, musk can bail out anytime receiving 0 damage from his megacorp going down.
tbh i feel sorry for tesla employees
Clownship at its finest
rip guy if he had to pay 400$ for insulin
i know a person who got diabetes because of a sickness and not because of unhealthy eating habits/obesity
even 100$ is too much
depending on what's needed
caries are like 100-300
and stuff
as in remove tartar
is between 70€ and 120€
of a visit from the dentist to wipe your teeth
ok average cost
dental business is just that particular
dental is pricey here too
infact insulin is taxed 4%
12€
i'm noticing stuff like 100 syringes
it's much much lower here
HOLY
how much is it in the us?
and they asked it months after.
again, ambulance ride 50€, that's all they asked when i needed it
yeah i def don't want to live in the US, thanks but no
HOLY
i'm still surprised that jobs that pay you weekly still exist, whew
it's so immoral...
you can't put a price on health
no sapph, take care, better be safe than sorry
i got confused
here it's govt, that's the difference
ok ok
is govt managed or private rn?
health insurance
wait wait
what does US uses it for even?
here it's proportional on the paycheck, but it's used to fund things like sick leaves and pension funds
hmmm
you pay those?
in poland
<@411556790925393921> <@203444794737950720> what are medias saying rn?
shit can get grimy
if putin doesn't step back now
this is really bad
not in serious
please circles
yeah basically
uuuh US already mentioned they are willing to butt in actively if Art 5 is invoked
as 2 polish citizens die
but this is really bad
Shit yeah
Poland got bombarded.
people
Oh shit
I can also see this as reason for EU to push more and more the EU army project
Diplomatic actions are not easy
Since if they don't escalate, NATO will press to use this event as weapon on the diplomatic table
what's for sure is that russia shot on its own feet with this incident
it's up to the poles
they want but it's not up to them to press that button
but it's not up to US
and say that US wants to escalate
You can put hands on a flame
that the Casus Belli is there
Thing is
PiS is probably doing hardcore thinking rn
EU is a peace since 70+ years rn
Matt, there have always been major historical events
it's all on poland tbh
Yeah absolutely
and US rejoyces every second that putin keeps insisting this bullshit
because russia can't really win
the good outcome is stalling out
and training their troops
Also smh, he's doing a freaking saturation bombardment on ukraine
someone said "Putin today has put himself on the wrong side of history"
but the day that invasion started
Look, i don't remember who said that
Freaking china
Pis going brtt
The closest model of propaganda the world has is the one that putler spreads, and we are seeing how good it's working when pressured with facts
Since many sources of information exist
Propaganda doesn't run unchecked and move the masses like sheeps in the west
It's given by a propaganda driven country
Why do i have to believe that number is true instead?
Because of their 1984 way of obscuring everything
We will never know the numbers or the facts
China response is going to let people die in misery now
Their model of economy is backfiring anyways
and it changes continuously
we don't like one political idea, we like the one that conveniences us
Or i should remember you how italy likes to change ideas and sides *countinously?*
they were in the past
is a huge joke
Fratelli d'Italia being called far-right nowadays
EU created a system where it tries to stay one as economic block, it's not perfect, and it will never be. But it's much better than Gun-ho Capitalism and Propaganda from China.
by law
it's the italian right wing being ONE, the true fascist political party was recently disbanded
No lank
it doesn't mean we are nazis
Just because we have a right winged government right now
wait, what nazis?
but the functional one
Not perfect
to both your US only and to Communism
European union is a functional alternative
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Lead_(Italy)
All i remember from recent communism is the Red Brigades who killed people during the years of lead in italy
and i think he was the decent one
Gorbachev had good calls
and obtained with blood
based around secrecy
It was an horrible regime
can we truly say that the russian citizen knew what went on in USSR? Those were the same people who took their sweet time to alert europe about Chernobyl
Communism is not the best way to run a country, you need to enforce it and let people suffer for it. No human will ever give away his wealth willingly.
but with this, excuse me but i have to do some stuff now and i have to quit the discussion.
i don't know AFD, since i'm not german and i've not observed their mess closely. I can't vouch for them. But i'm not the person who can just take a political scenario and divide it in macrogroups. In 2020s the political ideals and stances have become so much mixed and eterogeneous that it's really hard to do what you're trying to do. Your way of thinking worked back when we just had "red and blue". Which is not the case anymore.
this is not US
Yes sure, keep thinking that, downplaying the entire political scenario mess with one flick of an hand
also liberals are not fascists
and they will never be
are not the same thing
Fascists and conservatives
this is not 1900s
Lank you're committing the same mistake as some old farts right winged people calling the whole left wing "communist"
but macron is such a bright mind, isn't he? /s
also you can't imagine the socio-cultural issue that italy is facing right now, since the Ukraine war that led to a lack of grain (+ their recent unrest) is causing huge migrant waves again. Italy as a country can't handle it alone, and what happened recently? France refused migrants! Again!
just because fascism exists, you can't accuse entire countries of taking fascist stances
Exactly
as you might think
This means it's not omogeneous
that bleeded out
And i will let you know that Fdl became bigger because it took refugees from other parties
Fdl is the one you're accusing of fascism, as you might see they don't decide alone

btw this is our parliament rn
otherwise it's something else not fascism
which is anti-europeism
Fascism requires nationalism
Which is against the very core of what you're accusing them of
as things have started
is being pretty europeist
This current gorvernment
so italians decided, fuck the Partito democratico
Giorgia Meloni won because the left wing doesn't exist anymore, and won only because the other 2 right winged parties decided to make a coalition. The opposition is an eterogeneous centre-left wing who can't decide anything and only fight one against the other.
you get to jail for that
are you sure of that? in the country where apology to fascism is a crime?
Fratelli d'italia did the same
well nato decided to wash over the missiles, crisis adverted ™️
gg trump
this is the meme of 2022
is liable for 5 years of jail here
Money
Burning
Well there is some enlargening of the fact but it was sure a much lower standard of life than the roman one during the high dark ages
Then we need to rule out the middle ages which were a period of dark
Aehm, roman empire citizens didn't have an avg lifespan of 25 years
Keep in mind that australopithecus lasted 25 years at max
It was much more basic but saying nothing such as that existed is illogical
Tribe leader exploting the other members. "I eat first, i sleep here in the best spot"
We can't compare our society to that standard which came before the age of writing
Which is?
So some areas got worse
Ofc world is not equal and one
But the system, it's not worse, we got small but improvements
We got pandemic disasters and stuff in the way
That is actually not that true, world is not actually worse than 2000s
Fall of roman empire, advent of gunpowder, age of exploration/imperialism, industrial revolution/american independence, ww1/ww2, cold war and so on
Just saying that most gamechangers in history have been wars
Without damaging the system, killing people and causing misery and disasters
Btw putting history aside, i agree with rady that we can and need to improve, but no radical ideas gonna work
Industrial rev is 18th century
You are 100 years off the mark
Hat the shit lank
Factory
1600
And imperialism
Age of exploration
It's called incentive
Exactly
Or because they can earn from it
I wonder how much it will be ignored
Anyways covid23 is growing
But the absence of regulations in some areas boosted it too much
Ofc it can't
But the issue is that no other corporation got to that scale
Amazon monopoly growing stronger is a problem
US can't even start to compare the Ethnic background that goes up in Europe
It would be worth nil
Lira
We dread getting back to old currency
It's something that once made, shouldn't be retracted
United we stand, alone we fall
Even germany will be hurt
If eu collapses the damage will be so great for all members
Eu tried to help how they could, because when an euro country has issues all will suffer
They wronged the eu causing economic damage first
For years
Greece made false balqnce
pretty name anyways
i didn't know sorry
okay
now time to slap macron ass and open the borders to share the migrants
Alone we fail, together we may live
i have biases
i'm sorry leiur, i'm pretty much europeist
all the members (with a couple of pesky exceptions) understand how important is to not repeat UK mistake
Again, even then
./j
Let's go back to Roman Empire
can you blame the state members tho?
for the eu members themselves
on the other hand putler made it clear that EU existing is important
Yet i don't see it failing
this is why European union is something that is outstanding just for existing
so much eterogeneous that if ww2 didn't scare us we would just keep warring eachother for sport
rady lmao
I'm not going into that argument, it opens huge windows of discussions i don't feel like delving into rn.
I will end by saying that while i understand what you mean, i just can't see it as "Black&White", it's a gray zone topic.
i say that because i think the same way
Stealing is stealing
objectively that's bogus.
*strictly from a subjective standpoint*
Fenny, as aforementioned i agree with you but...
if the seed is not brought back
even with the same keywords
and the result will vary
Yep
I would use a premade model just for private use
i'm not doing it just because i'm a lazy ass
via stable diffusion
I've looked at how to setup a model even
The more i've seen those at work, the more i say that AI has no chance by how currently things are done
eeeeeh
"pirating small bad, pirating big good"
While i agree with you, that's a strongely subjective point fenny
*and Copyright?*
Fenny, again i see your point. But it's eh? Pointless? I don't know how to put it. Sure asking would have been the best possible way of doing it, but we are falling in a similar scenario of: *Is Piracy Bad?*
And what? you want to impede people from programming freely?
that's *all*
to learn off pixiv
and fire it up
i could buy a nvidia gpu, write my own code
Fenny, have you checked how those are trained?
*Generation seeds*
since you know
they will never manage to do the same 1:1
I've delved a bit in the matter, it's not like they "rip the art off", they learn from a *really vast* pool to make something based on *all they learned*
You are referring precisely at the learning algorithm that these AIs are submitted to
Fenny i will be blunt, quite blunt. Technology itself is not at fault, it's the people who use it for evil that are at fault. This kind of issue will be encountered with anything that humans will create. Dynamite is one of the most important example.
to split it away
there is a reason why deviantart recently created a separate category for AI art
3) The figure that is going to emerge is the person who knows how to generate the pics properly, it's not that easy
2) While some corps are aiming at exploiting it, there are people using AI Art without aiming at "making money"
1) Ai art can't be compared to human made art
There has to be said that
Sentient ai when, giff
absolutely
but Art is not one of those (better)
This is why Humanity needs AI to assist them to advance, there are some things that machines can just do better and faster
the *seed*
THis is why
But it's not on the same level
AI will be truly sentient only when humans will decide to make it such
Megan is right
Well yeah matt i can seethat
the heck?
Ah yes, fuck the people who worked hard to earn something
sigh
Why should it be the worst?
but calling the authorities is something that one should do
should stop a shoplifter
No absolutely, i didn't mean to say that an employee
Ah yes, to invoke the insurances?
Lankpants come on, stealing is not something you can consider neutral
Tell that to the employee that could get punished because he didn't pay attention
While it's true, shoplifting is bad, but i can agree about the "Morally Justified"
exactly
Social Welfare
It's a vicious cycle,
exceptions to the rules as usual
it's all grey
Nothing is White or Black
ofc it's normal to control what one can or cannot code, programming is the same as committing any other thing
it was related to what was written afterwards/before
That was not the point, taken out of context ofc it sounds bad
ok i'm out from this discussion
that's why i was sighing
mostly.
before
to masks
Japanese people see it as non issue, they were used
but only there
Masks in hospitals and such are still mandatory here
But getting a cat b driving license costs 700~ bucks if you follow the school, 400€ if you study by yourself
Driving license can be used instead of it in 90% of the cases
Rn it costs 23€ to renew one
Here
Having an ID card is mandatory
that's cursed
what the shit
Sad
You were in the right there
Yeah the photo at the license plate is fatal in those cases
and shattered
When he declared he would aim at the head of state, red and yellow got so scared that they went in panic
government was falling that very moment
and they're the ruling party rn
The deep blue offended him on day 1
he is the cyan in the middle
deputee
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Camera_dei_Deputati_XIX.svg/1920px-Camera_dei_Deputati_XIX.svg.png
i can't find the updated one with the names
shit
graphic
the scheme
lemme take
and the opposition got at least the double of his 8%
Except the Ruling party has a 30%
The line is: "ok authorities should be able to investigate those behind a mandate" and "No you can't check how much money got X politician in his bank by googling"
i get where you are aiming at with the discussion, again Public figures are public only to some extent
with a mere 8%
and of course he is that powerful that he is able to somehow manipulate *all the major* political parties
and he is 86 rn
The man is more rich than trump can ever dream
I am sorry if i push this forward but i live in the damn country where our dear Silvio Berlusconi is still in parliament, ruled as PM twice and his wealth exploded once a certain visit to a ranch in sicily happened in the past. *NO ONE ever managed to get past that barrier, the guy becomes rich out of nowhere, the source is impossible to trace past that point*
but unveiling their whole possession to the world, uuuh i'm not so much of a fan
being treated as public figures
I am entirely ok with politicians
Lemme cut this short
you need a judge mandate
I'm not a criminal mastermind rady, but watch out on the legal landmines you can step onto. The cousin is not a politician in this case
once money get laundered it becomes increasingly hard to backtrack it
And what if the cousin is clean at that point? he just got the yatch gifted?
They will always find a way
papers also state that
*ops my cousin owns that yatch*
You entirely sure rady?
rady you're implying they get found out
or they would be pushed to actively steer towards hiding it
but you can't unveil everything of their private life
limited privacy coverage
public figures
Yep i said it above
which still doesn't condone it
except some moral cases
Tax evasion is always bad
that it's a slope where, if we render their financial data public, then it would mean also non-politicians would be subject to that
That's why i said
you're not wrong on that
But sure
don't forget that
People can also win in court
organized crime gets more money
and increasing that means
What i was trying to say is that some drastic measures like that might push an increase of submerged economy
and it's fair
of course they're a public figure so that status limits their privacy coverage
I think that politician's wealth should be treated as any others
illegal transactions are submerged economy
it doesn't mean they found everyone out
just because they found him out
Yep yep, but remember
No bank transactions
It was all in cash and other things
Like one of our socdem getting money from qatar to put good words in eu
Reminder that it would solve less than you think. Dirty money is a ghost waiting to be laundered
Once you allow an exception everything creates a precedent
Not for you to know, A company is private
how much X person earns from said company is private
How much a company revenues is not private at all
privacy is important
I agree wit broom
Sexist as much as you want but it's a thing that still exists in several cultures
it's the saying
As you shouldn't ask a lady her age, you shouldn't ask a man his salary
It's withheld for tax reasons
The state doing that doesn't mean information is public and nor it should be
I see it as a good step to enter 1984 dystopia
i am against that
i think this came up before in this channel
"Sure authorities can investigate public figures/politicians wealth, but no you can't google their bank account and get results"
i will try to summarize
Since i discussed my point a bit
GL poland
tl;Dr
Look from what i've got, either PiS wins again or the other party that will win will have to try and salvage a country in shambles. The quest for it will be so hard that they would risk failing and giving PiS consent again
more PiS
but they broke off at least 1 decade ago
he was also putin best buddy to the extent that they exchanged medals
yep
italy will drastically change on his death
literally unbeatable
this person is an extreme case who won all his charges in court
But enough with this
but they make alliances on convienience
born as populists now they refuse to take a color
yellow are something that you can't really align
the only big chonk of left wing
red are socdems
but enough with that discussion
it was a curiosity about what was mentioned
my point was misunderstood then, i approved Broom point
It's not wild west
Norway transparency
> Prior to 2014, searching for tax return data was anonymous. But anyone searching the records today must log in to the website of the Norwegian Tax Administration. The searches are recorded so that any individual can see who—if anyone—has looked at their data.
it's so generic.
is excessive
putting "happy holidays" at stake
Come on
Uk far right movement would have needed to rise and win over for that alliance to work
Wtf
And leave Germany to their devices?
with ukraine?
we should let putler do what he wants
So in this scenario
But then what about EU
A society stems from a culture fuwa.
Because of their nationalist ego
even if a party tried, wrong place
Communism would have never worked in a country like japan
Don't worry, let's just keep our dear russian war criminal in power
No? Even the nazists back in the day were surprised
was really nothing compared to japan
The terror that hitler caused
than what Germany did
Nippon's nationalism was far more worse
was stuff from nietzche
Ubermensch
he wasn't at all
1914
at his early political days
It has partially to do with Mussolini leading a Socialist Newspaper
If that party managed to grab the consent UK would have been on the other side
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Union_of_Fascists
Also joining eu doesn't mean joining eurozone
It may have started like that but it's a tool to form an economic and geopolitical alliance
You are enlargening this too much
2008 - Greece: false balance
The chip for EU in this is: "If putin wins, it means that everything we have worked to this point is bogus and we can go back 100 years"
but Humans do move because of interest
It's their self interest
If the war is prolonged, america wins
If russia gives up, america wins
US can't afford to let Russia win this since it tilts the world balance
ofc
it's hypocritical to say "this yes, this no"
Non interventism goes BOTH ways
If they switched
That defaulting would get same result
Drachma would have a value so low
So it works an exception, no other place has a japanlike debt
Is special
Japan debt
Me said it, the inflation goes so bad when you default that stuff like that happens
And even then it's a bit too late for a globalized world to take that route
Not only imported
And no, that's not how it works, when a currency has nil value everything costs
Not on that scale
Surely some good sides are there but it would have ravaged everything in greece
Inflation is the big bad if grexit happened. It must be nice to pay a piece of bread with a day of your salary /s
And lank, you underestimate the fun that comes with print money
Read what happens when a country defaults, not pretty
And then what?
Please
Don't ignore false balance, it's a crime
It's written here
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis
Eugh give me a min gotta find it somewhere else
A t a l l
Greece was not innocent
https://www.ft.com/content/33b0a48c-ff7e-11de-8f53-00144feabdc0
Keep thinking that way, except only a less than one percent of italians iirc voted for the party that wanted to leave eu
Also again, globalized world
It's like italy avoiding to get back to lira
Some people just go overboard
People you are brooding over cause for effect, the bigger the cancel is, the bigger the backfire becomes
Goddamn it, that mod action was so potato bad that i feel really sorry for the poor artist
Side it with the demographic crisis
It surely isn't but if this spreads enough will result into a loss of manpower
Xi didn't expect this, did he?
https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/1/6/tired-of-the-grind-chinas-well-off-eye-slower-pace-in-thailand
Someone lost his mind apparently
Wtf is that
if you want another example
we can go onto the holodomor route
It's about what good sides of a coin you like and what bad sides of a coin you want to bear.
in any field.
There's nothing that it's perfect when we talk about humankind creations
Both systems are flawed
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine
I stated that above
Yes exactly
Give Caesar what's Caesar's
Yes but remove ww2 from the equation. USSR would not have started the machine.
huge scale wars always turn around the balance of power
We have the world wars in the middle of that fuwa tho
it's a natural consequence that he stated there
*“As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed and demand a rent even for its natural produce.”*
Adam smith stated a fact tere
and that's the part where Adam Smith is outdated
This is why i say that in a capitalist system, welfare is mandatory
it changes things drastically
I sometimes wonder how different the world would be if the Tzar didn't lose that civil war
Fascism, horrible as it is, made italy avoid the 1920 black monday
I call your statement bullshit instead.
Nothing is perfect, all systems have their flaws and pros, it's all about what of those sets we want.
Again lank
if you ask me
Both bad choices
that's not the point anyways
While i would like to elaborate i am in a really sour mood today for irl stuff. Sorry
Please lank, you twisting what i meant here. If you really believe i meant that, go use valves pc then
cya later
now i have to go to work
that a capitalism running system would break off at some point
is so big
The solar system
we can't know
and achieve greater goals
If that's our destiny, so it may be. Maybe some newformed society out of those colonies would have different standards
Still requires terraforming.
Lank, that capitalism would get some glorious moment ™️ it's a thing we can't deny. But having more land would stretch a lot what capitalism can achieve. Thus at some point the path taken would diverge.
we would be interested into terraforming instead
Who stated we would destroy every planet
Lank, you use your pc daily, it's a product of capitalism
To be short, something so big that shifts the interests elsewhere
What could change the balance of the current globe is also the true start of colonization of the rest of the solar system
but i agree with that event
That would imply a superior alien race
Extraterrestrial lifeforms are surely a thing, it's the laws that make  this very universe that would confirm that. Now their level of intelligence and development is what one could debate.
Resulting in massive casualities worldwide.
that's a lie.
Human rights are not horrible everywhere
Well at this point might as well wait for the next twitter competitot
Facepalming so hard
Am i reading
The shit
And then if that doesn't get solved to the authorities
First thing would be to report the server to discord team itself
So such crap is illegal
Gdpr in Eu forbids unauthorized doxxing
The copyright drama?
There was a question mark
I asked infact
The thing were you can equal all races which defeats the purpose of having them in the first place?
Dnd 5.1?
If you work during rest days you get paid more
Here you have to take 2 days off every week
Lol
Will check it later
yeah...
This is stupid, according to this blockers would be great to give teens the time to decide, but aren't they against that?
they're locked by the stage of puberty
In italy hormone blockers aren't age locked as much as i know
Shit, savage
is that stated into the rules
the bluntness of that everyone
got it
fine idea there
what about chris for cypher cuz avatar?

I'm so excited for to aru majutsu no index 3 pv, didn't expect them to take it to last arc of old testament
Woh guys
well i will join you on next series then
understood
did you just start girls und panzer or are you far away in the episodes?
I think i will rejoin you in anime runs
Tanks everywhere
i see you're still watching stuff, what are you watching lately here?
So so
it's already friday here
i mean this saturday
What are you going to watch tomorrow guys?
well as i said previously i will join you on next series
so are you going to watch GUP today?
oooh
hm what do you mean?
so what are you going to watch today guys?
lol the hate vs kirito is unlimited
oh understood, thanks if the ping happens
i meant the anime club
so yeah by the way, are you going to watch something tonight guys?
Sometimes they are irrelevant and can be cut out, other times they are required
Yeah exactly
oh go with DM
DM? what's that
not translating it in "mr"
THey should just omit -san
because there's no direct translations, "mr" is just an interpretation of -san
it's right to hold honorifics
Oh do you have unofficial tls? that's fine with me
i know like 300-320 kanjis, and that's not enough.
Well i'm studying japanese, but i'm not at the level where i can read raws yet
Do you reccomend buying the volumes?
nice
even if there are high level isekais that have been forgotten like mondaiji tachi
one of the best for sure
that series is getting me so much hyped that i'm starting to consider to buy the translated novel
oh god overlord
well have fun then
I didn't appreciate certain things about clannad, but everyone is different
Have fun there
woh, what an hq frieza there
got it
what are you going to watch guys?
*waits for sunrise announcement for 40th gundam anniversary*
i agree
i've put a 7.5/10
at least from what i remember, but the show itself was like "ok"
Oh i have to agree on Ange
i mean it's not that bad, at least i enjoyed it
<@256945399338631168> cross ange is quite nice
yes it can be a little... meh on small screen
i read from both, but so far i bought only light novels
well it can be understandable, the paper has its own feeling
THey overdid with the budget in the PV or what? it is like an insult, they failed with index 3 animations and then they "level up" with kagaku no accel?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcXfNLGYBsg
Oh god, <@138131889142628352>
LOL
Anyways i wanted to ask you, is it normal that i find After war x a bit boring to watch? or is it because SRW Alpha g spoiled me the whole thing?
Lol
Well with Full Frontal the thing gets a bit weird
yeah.
the whole Zeon thing started because of the stubborness of the feddies
Feddies were crap, thinking just about the earth
i find it pretty lackluster
lately
Anyways drifitng a bit to the side, i was watching Gundam X
hah
but i have to admit that i get hyped every damn time
huh, i didn't know that
real world is another one
but i think that finction is one thing
I can understand that
Of course i am
<@99695384296701952> wait what?
The heck
oh eva
nge was...?
poor fuuko
i kinda hate clannad AS, the series is very good but the premise of it... it's just straightforward dumbness. 
of course this is my honest opinion
*grand battle plays in bg*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpulYmEfk50 hype
yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tNE1jjOIaE
I will drop this here
woh
0079 is the first one
ok
0079 can be skipped with the movies
the two long series are Z and ZZ
well dragon
08th is a good way to get started if you want to stick to UC
in that case
tracking down the whole UC is not a new entry task
to Iron blooded and/or 00
Well i would send someone entirely new to gundamverse
well brb gotta do something
THE BRIGHT SLAP
D:
it's just unwatchable come on
i just died inside, twice
I tried to watch Wing
it is indeed
i went wild and watched 0079 avoiding the recap movies
then decided to go and traceback UC
Well i approached with 00 around 2011
it's a curiosity
how did you approach to gundam franchise?
(g)
that one
Come on it's a super robot
i'm yet to watch seed
it was cool but i have to rewatch it to take a look to second row
Watched Thunderbolt 1
oh ok
Oh does it have a bad ending?
<@138131889142628352> miki kazuma said that he would make nt anime if the sales are good
best map
ok i will watch that first then
thanks
<@!264373970118246400> can you help me on that?
<@99695384296701952> i found a good source, is the apocalypse the first one or the hidden one year war?
And i don't mind CG
can't stop the train
nownow i got hyped now.
beautiful things are always short
If i drop it i will fly directly into igloo
yes
around ep 20
Lemme check
i'm bored by it
Anyways should i drop X?
heh
Hathaway's flash when
uhm
am i the only one that has read Char Deleted Affair?
talking of not adapted contents
and crossbone has not been adapted yet
it's a part of crossbone i believe
But there's a reason because it's not so good
F91 killed me.
0079 -> 08th -> 0083 -> Z -> ZZ -> CCA -> Unicorn
I went in chronological order with UC timeline
i prefer to fly with my gp03 in stardust memory (i wont hide it, it's my favourite)
but but you know...
True
*feels*
i felt so bad after finishin git
0080 oooooh
That is a shot straight to my heart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE6SAE1tCEE ❤
it's so pretty
No come on you can't skip CCA
and Cima Garahau
I loved Haman Kharn
uhm
Not that Judeau is good, but ZZ is a bit more lighthearted
i cannot stand Fa and the others
i just hate kamille
i have to say one thing latooni, i didn't like Z
This is why i said, getting on main timeline is a bit more "hardcore"
I can understand that
but rejoyce after ZZ you have a *beautiful* movie (char's counterattack) and a CGI wonder (Gundam unicorn)
Eh i know dragon, but you can't skip those two
i think it's possible if you like the whole concept, it takes a bit of time
no skip here, Z has it's movies but they're not really very good compared to the first one
its direct sequels are Z and ZZ
that one can be skipped by the 3 movies
aired in 1979
Mobile Suit Gundam.
did narrative come out in the end?
it's the 40th? 😄 hype
ooooo
or lawful neutral
uhm maybe
Fate memes

THE HILDORF, it's like one of the best things i've ever seen in a gundam show
oh god oh god
i'm pretty hyped.
but i saw the illustrations with Qliphah and Accel doing things
i didn't start NT22 yet
by the way i watched igloo ep 1, hah, sad story for an almighty anti-ship cannon
WW3 was an average adaptation, nothing spectacular
<@138131889142628352> i hope they don't fail like battle royale arc... it has been basically murdered
*kihara intensifies*
hYPE
Full rewatch, exactly what i was waiting for!
Hell yeah
wow... 134 volumes...
ok this is new to me, i just discovered about Guin saga and...
i loved that anime, a lot
Oh god recreators
the main character is less generic than he seems
The characters are a bit more deep and better treated in the novel
past that is anime original (it seems)
up to the dungeon with the elf and the lich
the anime is like only up to vol 2
Yeah i meat that one
and started piling up isekai after isekai, right now i'm reading Death March novel
then i binged the novel.
Well it all started back then, when i discovered Mondaiji tachi and got fascinated by it
Yeah lol
more i watch stuff and more i notice that i'm addicted to isekais.
i'm watching kenja no mago
*air strike shirudo*
Great stuff
dearuka.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TlQCjGn9fE
the moment youtube slips you good old suggestions
rip
Gundam ftw
#siegzeon
And post the pics
I will build it one of these days
I got a sazabi
so <@!99695384296701952> when the next colony drop?
as mc
that Kou wasn't that great
I admit
rip cima garahau
it's my favourite
D:
GP03 DENDROBIUM BEST GUNDAM
IN THE END
*cries in men of destiny*
i lost the gundam discussion
nooo
uhm
i would buy that
D:
and then the world ended
so i asked them to give me suggestions
well i love reading vns as well but i started out pretty late
and solo leashed out his inner beast by linking Saya no Uta
(wich was solo and later ayamine lecturing me on what to play)
<@139432096023183360> you missed an huge discussion about VNs yesterday
well it's an unusual talk
10/10
no seriously yesterday was a blast
confirmations are always good
i see you're a man of culture
+1
ara ara oneesan is a good archetype
could you like tell me more in <#337805317276565525> if you don't mind?
did you say koihime musou? i discovered about it just yesterday
<@279341087494242304>
uh uh
i could do that sometime
ep 18
and i dropped.
i basically liked it a lot and got too much angry at nagisa
there is a 9 on clannad after story drop
uhm i don't think was katekiyo
there are some reasons there
what ones you refer?=
i put a bit of my subjectivity there
it's not even full objective
well the rate i give
(steins gate 0 is better tho)
than steins gate
i think it was even better
loved occultic nine
i absolutely
https://anilist.co/user/Cypher05/animelist
i gotta update my anime list too
uhm
inception!
don't worry
nothing much solo
called Analogue: An Hate story
which is my first one
oh i played a Korean VN
*russians are made of vodka*
but ayakashibito, that was a wild ride.
matter of tastes of course
yes
i'm sure i played something else but i miss to recall
and went wild digging up stuff
basically i awakened 2 days before Fuwanovel closed the gates.
and i'm saving other vns on my hdd
1 Ayakashibito path (my fav so far)
1 tsukihime path
but i've read 2/3 paths of FSN
well as i told you i started pretty late
what you brought up.
GOD
needless?
*Ragna blade*
SLAAAAAVE

90s anime!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vIux5EO7ck
90s anime?
Did you say

WOH

i miss one to 300
< 299
that would be fun
we should play it again here sometimes
Ayamine you don't know anime music quiz?
*sometime
i think we should organize
rofl
Dna2?
*gundam openings everywhere*
the problem there was me having watched tons of gundam
with the folks here
i remember when we played animemusicquiz
i update my list
that's why
<@256945399338631168> depends on what puts you off on the VNs
at WHY she  || died ||
No i'm angry
you should find a good input
<@279341087494242304> DEEN DRIVE FOXHOUND
LOL NEEDLESS
on mal no
on anilist yes
.
*Top wo nerae 2*
memories flashed in my mind badly
put my list in release date order
oooowww i didn't have to
i see...
i didn't watch that many 90s anime
ZOIDS ❤
this still gives me chills.

VULCAN SHOCK IGNITION
LITOL BOY

the budget in Toaru kagaku no accel
Woh woh woh

~~making swords ~~
i find touma a lot more clever than Shirou
it's a weeird situation
🤔
what would happen in an hypothetical universe where touma encounters emiya shirou and they get into a discussion?
<@138131889142628352> now that i think of it
Rofl
I don't check votes anymore
But that's a thing of the past
But gotta be honest, sometimes i've found myself comparing my vote to mal's and i some cases i went pretty close
And yeah it's known that mal ratings are not that great
I see You're a man of culture as well
*sieeg zeon*
and dedicate only myself to it.
will pick one day
I think i will build my sazabi during august
i went nuts for months spamming sieg zeon around
*SIEG ZEON*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHPbhb1ozX0
*more from yesterday*
nothing on pc?
are gundam games console only currently?
at first.
but she was a bit bland to me
maybe it's Z fault
after reading it
eeeeeh i've found Haman a much more likeable character
it's the whole backstory that tells where Haman Kharn came from
gundam CDA here?
anyways am i the only one that has read
sad
still no blu ray?
And where did narrative end?
hype
OOOH
Oooooh
HATAWAY'S FLASH WHEN
Right right
or Amuro
was better than Kamille.
well even Judeau
cuz dropping colonies is fun
oh tru
So people next *colony drop* when?
then i had to accept it.
i think Kamille and Fa killed it.
by the way i didn't really like Z at first
*bright plans*
well i will dedicate a room of mine to merchandise stuff when i will live alone
never touch my precioussss merchandise.
was meant for that
well i tought ever Gunpla
if it sucks
and 18 bucks it's not even a loss
the 1/550 one
that's why i sideplanned
i mean it's an hidden dream of mine.
But man... 300 bucks.
1/144 dendrobium
312 bucks.
Yeah
https://www.amazon.com/Bandai-Hobby-Dendrobium-Universal-Century/dp/B00030EU9Y/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=gp03&qid=1564074612&s=gateway&sr=8-2
300 euros.
and the "good gp03" kit costs
eh but dendrobium is of the size of a mobile armor
I will surely do that but first my sazabi is waiting me
HG GP03
lol
once
https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B00030EU6C/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_2?smid=A11IL2PNWYJU7H&psc=1
i was tempted to buy this
i mean
i'm tempted
at a convention
"RG is bad"
say
i heard a guy
char's one
a friend of mine owns a MG Red Zaku
1/60 seems freaking huge
woh
i got the HG Sazabi
Yea
psycho gundam ❤
the grades
the HG RG thingy?
can you instruct me about
the whole concept of Zeon is just charming let's say
Hmmm i never cared that space nazis were actually space nazis
ep 4 is my current one
what do you mean by jingoistic?
Let's say that the full cgi thing is too much in certain scenes
but it's still sad
i'm freaking loving MS igloo
And don't misunderstand me
Oh god
Yeah i know
the guntank ep was the most heartbreaking one
ending up bad
to see every Zeonic attempt of these engineers
well it's frustrating and sad
❤
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vRLIMxTJQE
leaves me with a sour taste?
is it possible that EVERY MS IGLOO episode
darn
i feel sad
flashed through my mind
watching MS Igloo apocalypse, man the memory of the guntank scene
*pat pat*
you're not alone
same
i'm heartbroken now
NOOOH
YOU DID WHAT
this melua
https://www.amazon.com/Bandai-Hobby-Dendrobium-Universal-Century/dp/B00030EU9Y/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=gp03&qid=1564074707&s=gateway&sr=8-2
but but 300 bucks gp03
discussion got ruined
Now my wonderful gundam metaverse
no one will hate you just take in the suggestion
well bad jokes can ruin the atmosphere and leave sour stuff, just avoid those in the future
ops sorry melua
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOkWvUWxl7Q
OOH i'm so damn curious about narrative
Yeah that comment was a bit... excessive
i'm yet to watch stuff after f91 because it feels a bit ugh
hmmm nah there's still room for improvement
oh well sorry there
EF just cared about earth
please melua
remember that the feddies provoked the whole thing
i don't think either Zeon or EFSF were in the right
There's no right and wrong
This is why i said
i think those are hypothesis
Garma's fall episode is burned in my memory
or at least he tried to
Well there's a reason because Char did what he did
eh
like "no right to vote for spacenoids"
Earth Federation does similar things tho
^ same thing
that was wrong
No of course
it just touched because Gundam has space nazis in it
on the political side
Look you're right but i'm not planning to take this conversation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaCpbwkNR0w
I goddamn mean
When talking about politics there's no "Right and Wrong"
the whole deal was for the independence
And the thing didn't go exaclty as real story went
and there is Slime isekai
Overlord was a nice suggestion too
No game no life maybe? in the end the true protags are just 2
Mondaiji has a ratio of 1 male main character and 2 female
Let me think other options...
Is it even a proper isekai?
Grimgar is a wise suggestion
hmm
*pats at youtube*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B80F86gROF4
i know i have posted this recently but youtube keeps poking me
oh
hah it's funny how i heavily spoiled myself almost everything in Turn A because i had to play Alpha Gaiden
CC closes 4 timelines
oh well
I'm so sorry for half spoiling
you DIDN'T?
OH
They revert to High explosive/Solid projectile
Since anti beam armors are up in the MSs
what do you think of this theory
Actually the thing reminds me a discussion i was having time ago <@!99695384296701952> 
It was about gundam iron blooded being centuries or even a millenia after UC
D:
Yeah
it's amazing

Oooh nice
What about that Vinland saga?
Well thanks for the suggestion
I should stop thinking at deen with emiya wings in mind
Is it good?
Not yet
Here folks

i'm happy that gear is 3rd
Well
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/589/836/15a.jpg
NEVER
never forget guys
Anyways i can quote from the Afterwords
^
you missed on that
no no they're called with specific names
eh
and he got mauled by a freaking ogre
Goblin slayer is a silver rank adventurer
THe anime doesn't mention the gods properly but in the LN there are minichapters that have the gods as protagonists telling the story
it's the story of a man that wont let the gods roll the dice for him
after his trauma
since he's touched in the head
the whole thing rotates around the goblin slayer trying to return a normal person
ehm
less generic than you think
goblin slayer is dark fantasy
got physical english translated copies
i'm reading the LN
it is
Rin and tokiomi singing this illusion
great cover is great.
https://youtu.be/H0ca75LvrRA?t=544
And tonya best character
Yeah
am i really the only one who has played this vn? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl7Vnv5FeQ8
|| the game thingy is a law they've introduced after ~~arcadia ~~ no name got destroyed, there was no such law in little garden before ||
the plot is not easy at it seems
it's a plot premise
yeah
but yeah i understood what you meant
hmm not sure if full shonen is the right word
Yeah
i've read the whole novel and i can say that what awaits ahead it's just suffering.
(anime adaptation ends at volume 3)
Only mondaiji first part talks of games
and i will say more to that
yeah
"it's the precursor of mondaiji"
a friend told me once
amazon uk says 8
i checked
https://www.amazon.co.uk/
and they got this in uk
😄 blast the shipping problems away!
we have amazon.it in italy
and hey this is why
1 $ = 0,90 € = 0,80 GBP
it should be like 8 gbp
goblin slayer vol 7 for example 9,80$
quick search
Look
uhm
mind you
LN prices range from 8 € to 15€
per volume
10 bucks
amazon then
i got the official books
i dunno about fan translations
uh
it needed a workaround
is not *directly adaptable*
since the way the LN is written
The anime anyways doesn't do proper justice
1) DnD
2) Sorcery!
3) Chaos flare
the Author is inspired by 3 RPG books
i think it's because it shows the whole relation through the years
idk i've watched the first season, it's a lighthearted romance where she teases him all the time
Sinfogia is fighting to mantain the position

Literally
Huge plot behind that bunny girl
that it was my favourite isekai
i can confess
not removed
yeah it's like put aside
moved it
don't worry, you're right
it was just a sidetrack if you really want i can do that
uhm i will stop talking about it
*Yes!*
D:
it's not their fault if the evil people break the rules
but FSN makes no sense as a title
it's alright if we take Tsukihime and Kara No Kyoukai
i've always found no relation between the content and FSN title
uhm why did nasu even call fate in that way
the point is that i EVEN APPRECIATED THIS during 2010
i'm laughing so much
😂
*Car engine starting*
Brrrrrropp
meanwhile
ridiculousness is overflowing
to enlight EMIYA
i can't help to notice the moonlight MOVING
zerker vs emiya in deen/stay night
<@279341087494242304> as i'm rewatching
*shounen without power ups and powers*
world trigger where
uhm
This is HOW YOU USE GP03

and yeah amazing thread indeed
*time to hail zeon*
my gunpla tomorrow
oh maybe i'm going to build
in an anime guys?
why are you discussing about a broken neck
the important is never forget the historical truth
regarding that nobunaga
well it's still an anime
that one
Oh kenja no mago
Melua just the start
but yeah the premise it's pretty similar but it evolves in very different fashion
2 years after.
no NGNL came out
2012 anime
Mondaiji it's the old one
wait wait
everything relating cyberspaces is kinda more cyberpunk than isekai
it's cyberpunk.
and i don't consider SAO a proper isekai
mondaiji
in the end, my heart only has a slot for one isekai
but they overdid it
i mean it's okay in some contest
i can relate
eh
since he gets a fiancee right from the start basically
the no-harem part is surely something
i liked it
Kenja no mago hmm
and there's some degree of censorship in the LN
i tried reading the LN, the WN is more enjoyable
there are some differences there and here
the anime is adapted from the LN
it's a bit different
not the LN
i'm reading the WN
Anyways let me rephrase
There's nothing to beat for him
it's not an action centered anime
it's a lighthearted isekai, where the main character goes around sightseeing the world
The anime is just a premise
It is pretty good.
right now.
OH i'm reading Death March LN
the sequel
i will start last embryo sooner or later
did you read the LN millhi?
^
free to do so 😛
heh
i can't spoil but he's less op than you think
he can't kick god asses
but what can you do it's just the first 2-3 volumes
i think it's just the first part that doesn't do her justice
equally important
all of the 3 are main characters.
nop
THE FREAKING VOLUME AFTER THE ANIME IS IZAYOI BG, and darn it's mind blowing
everything
Mondaiji S2 would break
Yesh what about it?
but he slowly becomes a nice character after the first two arcs
Lol can't say anything to that
is one of the strong points of accel world
midget pigboy character development
Then there's me preferring Accel World over SAO
can't argue with that.
Lol true aya
you don't call that isekai.
at the end of the first part.
not after what happened
nah
hmmm
Digimon was a thing
Isekais exist even before
hah no pls
but it's hazardous to continue saying that SAO is an isekai
i'm going to read it, i can deal with a summary for vol 6.
the old novel
ok ok i wanna read this, but i don't think someone even translated
LOL
It's even more cranked up?
Lol
the old one you mean
Webnovel version <@152896851660505088> is there a WN version?
well the whole concept is enchanting
roflmao
you didn't like it?
sad story is sad
but yeah, GATE LN is full fantranslated except freaking vol 6, they miss the raw!
Hype Creation A+
Lol
it seems
it was a slip from the scriptwriter
GATE: JSDF
other Isekai i freaking loved is
but yeah i might just embark myself into the ln at this rate
missing
it's just the release date
more ainz OOAL GOWN incoming
coming up!
Oh and next overlord season
Yeah
but i overall enjoyed the anime
i agree with the ups and down
one good isekai is shield hero
Lol that
for 2012
the animation was okay
it is
**YES!**
or actually
Yes
she sings the opening ❤
there, one think i love about mondaiji is Kurousagi VA
okay
Yeah lmao
and trash rises up everywhere
examples like soul eater.
but then you get
not yet
because the adaptation is bad.
with that way is when the people think bad of the source
well the problem
to the studios at the time
much attention
I never paid
wakes up curiosity in me
i liked it a lot so the "news" that the source is different
the thing is
you're basically telling me half of the anime is original
i'm curious now
uhm
how is it compared to the anime adaptation?
uhm
is it good?
i never considered reading the chuunibyou LN
uh
discovered there's a VN called Swan Song
lol i just
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Good job
We made it

hmm i don't know if i should bother
that was so much satisfaction
THAT
Lol
it was nice but subbed stuff is just better.
i went to the teather and watched it italian dubbed months ago
subbed.
It is. but i have to watch it
https://www.mediafire.com/file/kfu7oj1nn7m6gad/%5BRabidWulfe%5D_Lost_Butterfly_Heaven%27s_Feel_Subs.ass/file

Yeah
Mystic aura that has been lost
They have a certain

uhm youtube throwing VN openings at me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRop6KExbo8
|| arc vs the dead apostle guy animated would be so great ||
where.
now tsukihime movie trilogy
Well it's not "mine", i still live with my parents so it's technically my father's
then i will dive into xv channel
well brb i'm going to watch XV episode
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~like tsukihime anime?~~
where
when he was an archmage
Original series about Zouken adventures
what what
we got weird people there
Clock tower > seigi no mikata
at the clock tower!
hey he becomes a student
UBW?
hm
it went like
it could be that i played the VN
many parts seemed a bit void
You know what
today
i rewatched it
Oh yeah
what what
then humanity falls under racism again
a possible thing that the human nature is capable of doing
i see even colony drops
Lol true
A Baoa Qu where
i meant the situation
Of course put those aside
i see that happening.
fun thing about the whole gundam franchise is that a similar outcome in distant future is 100% possible
booh
that's all because feddies didn't concede independence!
D:
but it's also sad as hell
i love igloo tech
i'm halfway
i'm yet to finish igloo
damn uuuu
zeonic one...
i meant igloo 1 guntank
wot
it is
but but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vRLIMxTJQE IGLOO GUNTANK WHERE
is talking about mobile suits
Everyone
Lol

things would have gone better
he needed a bright slap
yeah
if Banagher reacted before the slashing
Oh i have to agree on that
RX 0 activates!
o7
in my mind
oh dear no, Daguza scene from UC flashed
but again > tomino
and left a sour taste because Garma was one of the decent characters
it was a waste
Yeah
*Garma falls*
the feddies had a "free" win in the end
and many times acted independently
but even the leaders were disorganized
true true
for starters
everything around casval
yeah
But yeah watching Igloo it feels like that Zeon could have turned the tide *anytime* just by using those experimental weapons, which were let's say pretty overpowered but situational
it's a Mobile tank!
so it's wrong to call it a guntank
oh https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/YMT-05_Hildolfr
right.
what a sad world
>spacenoids
same.
Yeah.
on s2
got a downgrade
Yea lenessia
nah
some others went a bit into the crap
got better
some characters
RAYNESHIA*
or
10/10
Lenessia best character
about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvNEMSz6GpY i stil have chills
that i played DATABASE on in the groove/dance dance revolution
i can say proudly
watched it 6 times.
i loved log horizon
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/742/427/d35.png
just look at the time
got mentioned?
Log horizooon

FURU CONTROL ENCAUNTAH
evil with glasses
yeah
but it is needed
well yeah that was a bit a waste of screentime
Oh the kids arc
when she talked to the adventurers
i loved rayneshia scene
but yeah it was a cool show to watch
it went a bit overboard and became amix of everything
i watched that
oh nobunaga the fool
Random post just to hail saikyou no reberu faivu

go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r9NDWKJi1I
<@238855496797257729>
but a good one
it's not an outstanding anime
around the middle
stretched itself a bit
let's say that the plot
i liked that
was such a good anime
Cross ange
|| but i remember it had a good ending ||
you know i don't remember
Uh
i'm one year older than you (26), i guess i just started using internet pretty late
Lol
You talk about old stuff like it is nothing sometimes, can i ask you how old are you solo? lol (if it's a problem telling me, no problem)
lol
lol i just noticed it started in 2006
it was good.
reading girl friend manga
oh right today i finished
nagisa and honoka!
first precure season!
he put 0 effort.
i can vouch for izayoi
!
emiya shirou is not there
|| now he is a FREAKING FEUDAL LORD, PAY RESPECTS ||
LOL
in b4 guts
(pchan <3)
i think you're right
let's just look at how pchan grinded to get skilled
so no casual playerbase
GGO was hardcore
as long as we know
JUST HOW
|| WHEN HE DODGED 2 CLIPS OF m16 || I WENT NUTS THERE
DAMN
LOL
console admin cheat
even if something something
it's not a thing that can be denied
he got skilled by tryharding
Regarding kirito yeah
without doing shit
he lives an hedonistic life
You can't put Izayoi under hard work
No calm down
what do you mean millhi
anyways it's a random pic i found, nothing much to fuss around
so ofc he gets hard work section
that he grinded down the whole game
starts from the premise
Ains

i find things like these on facebook
then
i left it at ep 39
serves me right
if my memory
i had my fair amount of laughs there
such great stuff
that i have to continue hayate no gotoku
that reminds me
you end up missing the sense of it
that's bad
off
it's filled with crapload of references
look i think that it does well in its genre
the intro tho.
oh dear, youtube don't do this to me, good stuff:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GApuR37lT-4
it overflows.
just how much is the amount of cuteness.
i started release the spyce yesterday
|| hold on tatsumi i'm going to die right here ||
but that one is the dumbest
yeah
|| the thing that enraged me the most is how mine died in the anime, the fuck? ||
the case where the anime thingy is better than the source is pretty rare
i don't like when anime adaptations go off on their own
it's the main reason why i started reading the manga
Eh i know about that
i mean until this point the anime adaptation is okay but it seems to fail on characters a bit compared to the manga
got to chapt 3, it seems a bit better than the anime already
i started reading akame ga kill manga
do not spoil too much here we can go to <#377148557796442134> if you want
yeah
she seemed a pretty cool character
such a shame
OH THAT
|| the one that got decapitated? ||
wot one
the s2 tho... what a disaster
well i think IS S1 was okay at the time
"is faithful to the ln"
no i meant
how is it compared to the anime?
about that
I've been always curious
Is as infinite stratos?

*insert anti-hero here*
D:
spit it out
who? kamachi?
freaking huge.
i mean.

not mine but
just HOW
i'm still amazed at the *mass* of certain volumes of horizon
*looks at kawakami*
there are some insane LN authors there
Look
Nanodesu dropped the TL and no one bought it
my pain is that i will never know
EH
But apparently it's 1/11 volumes
it felt longer
I have to agree
time to add it to my "to buy LN list"
Thanks god
i can buy it then
Hooray
yen press bought the thing?
Oh
rokka no yuusha
let's see if anyone translates
D:
i loved the concept and the character designs
i want more of that
GOD ROKKA NO YUUSHA
it's pretty sad
llol.
searched^
Not at all, the anime covers only the first volume of the light novels,
lol
how do you put 11 volumes in 12 episodes?
covered freaking 11 volumes.
i doubt that the anime
Well
but no one translates it currently and no one bought it for official tl
i wanted to read Grimoire of Zero LN
what a sad thing
what a person of culture
lmao js06 (kamachi and kawakami LN translator) follows symphogear as well
and i've watched several
the only older anime i couldn't bear was lodoss.
so far
uhm i could handle that
how many episodes?
LOL
take point i've took up the resolve and went trough all gundam 0079 so i can bear old animation
well i'm asking you here
i've watched only F
from what Macross should i start?
guys i'm asking since i got inspired
lol
but yeah sometimes being here really makes me think how many cultured people we got here
has to translate it all
poor js06
LOL
Horizon plot is mind blowning
but yeah
and no s3
so producers got scared
budget wise anime of its era
Horizon was one of the most expensive
but yeah i will read horizon someday
i'm shivering just at the tought
and City series is the SEQUEL
owari no chronicle is the fucking prequel
The mad thing about horizon is that
Unstoppable streak
*saikyou no reberu faivu*
I mean
This
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
i had to go afk for a few mins
<@!99695384296701952> thanks for the explanation
not a standalone.
but it requires knowledge from first 2 seasons of index to be understood
pretty nice adaptation of the first story arc i have to say
aaand toaru kagaku no accelerator finished
*hype?*
on january 2020
Toaru Kagaku no Railgun T
aaaand
lol
they butchered the LN in that adaptation
the guy that gets beaten there is present for like 8 volumes more?
basically the last part of Nobuna adaptation is original
I'm afraid you can't have it even if they wanted
you wish eh
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
it was pretty good but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdBK7pnWcU8
thanks youtube
oooh the good "old" stuff
i believe that's the frame from Railgun T PV

nice news are nice.
uuhh oda nobuna no yabou LN vol 16-17 got translated
if they adapt Eden's zero
It will be so hilarious
Oh of course
hmm
A young boy gazes up at the sky and sees a streaming bolt of light. The friendly, armor-clad being at his side tells him gently, "That's a dragon." The fact that he's joking isn't important. What's important is the look of wonder on the boy's face... and the galaxy-spanning adventure that's about to take place! Join Hiro Mashima (Fairy Tail, Rave Master) once more as he takes to the stars for another thrilling saga!
giff feedback
i'm curious now
How is it anyways?
i was joking
and everything is fine.
to rie kugimiya
give more cats to voice act

fun how i've finished
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
|| my only regret is that i will never get master zero back, best villain of the series ||
in the anime
They felt fine
i absolutely agree
i'm satisfied on how it ended
i gotta say
did you follow it?
after 300+ episodes.
fairy tail finally ended
then there's me, i never watched neither idolmasters or LL
i was watching it in awe
the anime amazing
well i found
heh
i'm curious of how far can "Glorious nippon" vibe go
someday i will read gate
nobuna was a perfect example
eh but some of those get delayed cuz no tl avaiable yet
sometimes i realize i've read a decent number of LNs that i'm yet to finish
you can't just downgrade the thing like that.
i mean you get freaking || sherlock holmes || in main novel
*adventures of the qt kouhai*
it's just nothing worth to waste time on
it's not bad
No ok
it's bad
god renai circulation.
during volume 9.
that gets mentioned ONCE
is a side side side character
the mc of that THING
i'm so angry at that spinoff
That spinoff
no.
it becomes SO GOOD after the anime ends
i've read up to volume 12!
GIFF SEQUEL
POOR HIDAN NO ARIA
brings me back
ugh thinking at rie
hmm you're right
was not good.
Eeeeh so far everything i've heard
i'm always on the edge when a series with his OSTs pops up, look it's him!
his soundtracks send me into a loop
Yatsuharu takahashi
if edens zero gets the same music composer
anyways all the double the hilariously
she's just not suited for that
she sings in toradora.
i've nightmares from toradora
DO NOT LET HER SING
for jesus christ
Look, it is okay but
*urusai*
poor accel world, so underrated
where one of the two overshadows the other
then yoou get the Accel world /SAO effect
eeeh
the Last episode of 2018 literally yells
At this point yes
and the cat gets given to Kugimiya rie again
i usually search for a twist there
hmmm i've never been too much into SoL subgenre
i double over with laughters.
and hayate no gotoku
like seto no hanayome

i do love comedy parodic
but

that's my problem

You can notice  that a certain point he truly realized the direction to take if you read accel world afterwords
Reki improves as both of his writings go on
I agree
i'm more fixated on Real Robots
i don't like Super Robots
i loved it but
TTGL eh
people are mostly angry for || the eye thingy ||
that s2 is good
I think
i was like "wtf"
but more i watched it, more it reminded me of Turn A
well i will not spoil
oh okay
did any of you watch aldnoah zero?
oh oh guys one question
that no english version exists.
i've read the manga but the ln is so old
to read Full Metal Panic LN
i'm a bit sad that i didn't have the opportunity
talking of mecha shows
i didn't watch s1
maybe just because
ittt was nice but i dropped it somehow
eh.
not knowing it was s2
i watched evol halfway
i should recover that
speaking of aquarion

good idea that too
but Last embryo is ongoing and volumes tl is a bit slow
It's awesome
and Last Embryo takes the story onwards from there
it ends
Mondaiji tachi has 12 Volumes
Lol
Mondaiji Tachi's Sequel
Last Embryo
The first one?
in every sense
she literally (and she knows it) is a later bloomer
she shines later on
Yo is cat girl
Yo Shines later in the LN
each one in its unique way
are awesome
all of the 3 MCs
honestly
"mental images > reality"
the cool part was the reasoning around it
hah

Mondaiji artist is amazing imho
?_?
Well the thing
and decided to revive other dengeki lns.
dengeki bunko saw that index revival made crapton of money
a theory here
Then i'm making
Anyways when was this  announced?
you will lose something
you can't just convey 100% of the content
passing as idiot
well it's the same of our red headed boy
Lol
naisu naisu
heh
Thanks for the enlightement
of LN media
cuz anime can't bear the greatness
the usual cutting
Oh
*Takes notes*
then it's something i will have to read
i mean no 1:1?
compared to the ln?
it's the Anime adaptation so bad
but
!
special
Miyuki is
nice
or still jp only
published by our usual Yen press?
is the LN
i'm, not saying he's wrong
it's a battle school
tastes
I damn loved s1
s2
after 22.
this means i will watch the movie
Well
basically.
Dengeki bunko being dengeki bunko
with Accel world
They did the same bs
oh so it's a jumped one
and the anime ends where?
oh
filler...?
a sequel one?
Oh
LOL
Did i miss something?
what movie
wat
this is a wonderful news
RIGHT
?_?
more shiba miyukiiii
yessssssssssssssssssssssss
MAhouka s2???????????????
yes
yet idiotic reason for that
There's a very well explained
(please ignore the fact i gave 10/10 to all 3 sns series)
but it's a stretch.
it does make sense
and fuck the serpent god
it is not bad, it's a shock
same
i'm still angry at that crap.
damn accel world infite burst.
but yeah speaking of "random filler" movies
*hoards LN*
so little time.
there's so much to read
lol
it's just me wanting more
it did
*hides*
(new shakugan no shana sequel when)
since it's a lot more complicated.
if they screw NT up
i will get mad
I swear
(yeah the adaptation sucked by the way)
millhi
it's the opposite
don't assume no money cuz bad adaptation
Index s3 sold more than s2 and s1
(thanks js06 for blasting through the LN TL)
no anyways, i'm the madman that went and followed all index to the end, i can say that its easily my most favourite series
go read some newtype magazine
Lol
(NT ended by the way)
dw
i'm not getting in depth
there was a boring arc that killed the hype.
after othinus arc
IT happened
so it's not a casual fan thing
is that you need to follow the thing pretty closely
with index
**PCHAN**
(GIFF MORE SAOA)
AW is just better imho
but not enough to buy the LN
i like sao
look
it sticks out the fuck
with paper longer than the volume
has 2-3 pages
one of my Accel world volumes
that reminded me
Lol
i freaking loved asterisk war for exaple
is included in the first clause
The really like part
well i buy LNs when i feel i want to buy those or when i get no fantl and must read the thing
my physical ln collection

i always rewatch it with subs
but if it does
i don't really sit well with dubs but sometimes it happens
back in 2009-2010
with subs
let's say SNS was one of my first anime i actually watched in streaming
*hides again*
Hecate best character
that's why i went mad
from that finale
but i'm yet to recover my heart fragments shattered around
Anyways i don't recall that
😂
the definition
No no no
?_?
*feels stupid*
retcon = ?
please remind me
it's very very difficult to explain
it has an ending.
No no aya
*angry noises*
so you get no ending.
one and half
it's not a mainstream thing
|| and it's the one that destroys the heart of the reader. ||
only final one.
.
out of the anime
FINAL VOLUME
they left out
that's a weird case of wtf is this fail at adapting ?
not seriously
(jk)
the katakana doesn't agree!
but but sir
kutoriiii D:
the suffering from sukasuka strikes back.
the list.
damn i should have not opened
https://anilist.co/user/Cypher05/mangalist my manga/ln list
i read the LN
Yes
D:
giff more hidan no aria tl.
can i rant
hands up
*angry noises*
YOU NEED TO RETCON 5 EPS THEN
EEEEH
so they can't continue
aya, oda nobuna got an original ending
anyways as i listen
it's wonderful of how much cultured discussions get here
ctholly ❤
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
MILLHI
EH YOU ARE UNFAIR
let's listen
*angry noises at oda
eeeeeeeeeeh
eeeeh
what millhi
but oda nobuna vol 16 and 17 got trranslated
i don't recall if i did say this here
oh yeah
anyways... hmmm
who raids kawakami and kamachi regularly
is mad as js06
well not every fan translator
https://orlandritl.wordpress.com/
translated first 2 volumes.
olandri translations
anyways
it's ongoing
oh
again?
How much long was sukamoka
lemme check
translated?
was sukamoka
(punches the desk)
goddamn it.
yeah it's just brutally smash my heart cuz yes
but it's the closest thing you can think of
it's a stretch
.
but there's more
and it's the same
Look there's an ending
right?
is the sequel
Sukamoka
idk
there's more after the ending.
kinda yeah
but it's a special case.
and it's even canon
has an ending
So aya, the anime
Lmao
don't say learn japanese i'm already doing that.
i will never get the chance of reading it
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/kami-sama-no-inai-nichiyoubi/ 😦
but it hurt at the time
i don't recall that very well
kamisama no inai nichiyoubi came back into my mind
speaking of suffering
|| the thing is how that setting is set up, it can only bring despair and suffering ||
but yeah it was a pretty nice ln
yknow
are pretty strong
mental images
she didn't deserve it.
damn it
down my spine.
chills.
i total forgot of that.
saved on my hdd
until sao aci vol 1
i have SAO LN fantl
i discovered
oh and the other day
thanks internet.
so much to read
but yeah
good
.
lots of them.
he has guts.
does badass things later on
the mc
I have to flip one coin in favor of oda nobuna
Oda nobuna is not that well known as dxd
Best catchphrase
<@279341087494242304> dearuka indeed
yasuharu takahashi at his finest.
10/10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TlQCjGn9fE thanks youtube once again
Literally.
Headcannons
lol that propic solo
when she will show up
<@152896851660505088> <@279341087494242304> tomorrow is fgo saturday! i'm so curious to see how they will animate pretty gorgon
cosplay level-> next
Oh god
I'm at vol 7
The world building is awesome
I gotta say that even if the plot is not the strong point
Deathmarch wn
I resumed reading
and of course Fripside will sing the opening
it was unexpected
i'm already excited lol
Akeboshi Rockets & Kishida Kyoudan will make Toaru Kagaku no Railgun Third Ending
but all the hate just looms
the issue wasn't left unattended, reki himself "leveled up" while writing his stories
to fix that
but there is SAO progressive manga
the problem with aincrad is with the time gap
but aincrad, mother rosario and alicization are more than okay
- Fairy Dances
- Phantom Bullet (which starts to fall apart starting from the point where  || kirito dodges and *DEFLECTS* 2 full clips of m16 with his beam sword, are you fucking raiden from metal gear? ||)
that failed in 2 arcs
that SAO is a pretty valid show
i still think
sometimes this pops out in my youtube suggestions and memories flow back from 2012, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHJM0sDyUtE
and advanced AI girl controlled ships
moar giant submarines
D:
Aoki hagane no arpeggio sequel when
please
it's like a drug.
and binge watch isekais
the time where i just go
oh i do have
~~just give me arpeggio already~~
I used to play it
Rip solo
i would have not become a fan of that
on World trigger
if i applied that rule
for example
it depends on me
woh that's some nice determination
do you follow one piece?
release the spyce
spyce anime.
i forgot
oh right
i usually watch more, i'm just in a downtime period
right now
i'm watching: Sao aci 2, FGO babylon and black clover
azur lane anime
oh true
it has its feeling
good job reki, good job.
it blew my mind.
i did not absolutely expect that
yeah speaking of sao, i've watched first 2 eps of Alicization part 2
P90 for the win.
and buy the dlcs
i need to start over
i gotta buy the dlcs someday
it's a nice game!
i heard someone is playing fatal bullet
uuuh
high five solo
you're from the age of gods
of course
And yeah
i'm 1 year younger
1992?
how wonderful if takeuchi starts drawing something else
just imagine
so i had to ask.
i don't know that ppic feels weird
in your ppic?
is that Kohaku
anyways solo
LOL
can i summon millhi as a servant^?
^
surviving from ancient times
in b4 we discover millhi is a demigod
He's eternal
how old are you millhi if i may ask
or i would have done the same
the tech at the time
oh i just didn't have
rip
Lol
hf
i'm scared of knowing
yeah i figured
like a pro.
his free time
millhi splits
goddamn.
how i dropped LODOSS
it reminded me
speaking of the 3 days rule
lol
wrestling isekai?
i feel lost
what are you talking about
or you will appear in the next lostbelts
from sorcery from the age of gods
Yeah and you need to give out some magic tricks
you old ojiisan
omg
https://youtu.be/tgB08y6n8VY
and the osts are stunning, this in particular struck me in just one episode
i can't describe it
it's unusual even for a 90s series
what is with this strange vibe
watched utena episode 1
okay
so np
by deleting the eps as i watch them
i will deal with the 78 gb one
it's overkill.
said 78 gb
yarr harr
where should i find it
i got a problem tho
i'm going to watch utena!
from the 90s
time to recover something pretty old
Hah
lemme think
|| *double rapier boys* ||
was Nyanta
other nice character
Yen On
vol 11 got the LN
the series *is licensed*
no good luck
oh yeah
*time to search the web*
hmm
if someone took up the WN tl
anyways i'm wondering
from that series
it's my fav character
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
RAYNESHIA
AAAAAAAAA
Even shiroe design was a bit cooler
some others are better
that became worse
some characters
look there are
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/742/427/d35.png
wohohoo
You gotta feel living in the database
Ofc!
i think it needs to be reused.
It left a mark
DATABASE
what the opening will be?
and of course
D:
no come on it was cool
*hype*
log horizon WN got up to vol 16
oooh
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417> speaking of isekais, giff more log horizon
Lol i was thinking the same
And lol all the talk about the end of the world
In a good way
I'm astonished
Anyways i watched utena ep 2, it feels so unusual even as 90s anime
Muv luv integrate
Se new muv luv vn?
*megami no chikara yo*
i can anyways understand not liking nep, she reaches illegal-hating-allowed levels when making jokes and puns
The strong point is how different purple heart is, it just... i cannot describe lol
Purple Heart voice tho is godlike
it's nep
ojh
nep nep?
what about
as long as i know
hmm different
at some pooint
Eden's Zero
I will start reading
lmao
the other continent
Could be
no it's not the same
uhm
i don't really know
really mashima really? it's a dumbed down eurasia+africa.
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fairytail/images/a/aa/Colored_Earth_Land_Map.png/revision/latest?cb=20120628141651

it's better if you
uhm
what did you buy aya?
woh
|| hell there's even a character that is nearly 1:1 to erza, art wise ||
but better.
and Eden's zero one is a close match
FT artstyle
Well i do like
happy is less hateable here
rebecca
as a character
gotta say that the female mc is a lot better than lucy
tastes.
tastes aya
of course the character designs do match a lot
so it is not THAT similar to fairy tail
it's more a space adventure
Lol
he's better here tho
HAPPY.
the characters are nicer, there's only one problem.
gotta say that it seems more polished than fairy tail right off the bat
reading eden's zero
<@152896851660505088> i started
it's listed as such by the author thingy lol
they never fail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0ow4tGgZWk darn GitS soundtracks
i think that she and Kotoko were special <@279341087494242304>
i do have the full album square the circle on my hdd, pure bliss
yeah i can say that she was my fav singer back in the day when she still sang
they had a certain feel that you wont find nowadays
sometimes i miss Kawada mami openings
yay more isekais
superb cover is good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj-A_ZRKl4c
ooooh youtube, thanks for reminding me of nice stuff
lol
same author
i will jus tlink this
no he's badly adapted
NT 7-8-9 and NT 19 to 22 R
Index hugest highlights are the last arc and othinus arc
index only improves
what?
as i was saying
have fun
it's a wild ride
on vol 45.
LN
i'm on pair with index
look
that happen at a certain point of index
Railgun is a set of side stories
*peeks at toaru discussion*
what about railgun?
hm?
just don't assume things
Toaruverse is huge
Hey chill out guys, it's only a series
|| reached a certain part Mikoto will stalk touma around the world, no more academy city railgun vibes ||
is HEAVILY limited by index LN
Railgun
for NT
a buildup
is  ONLY
old Testament
later on
ideals
Touma gets screwed by his own
and no touma is not the classic LN protag
vs LN
in the anime
got lost
many stuff
can i say one thing?
Carolnein
well before vol 1
even pre-index
literally.
before his memory loss
NO ONE knows how touma was
that's touma pre memory loss
Hold on
HO started out as a test
gotta start reading the new novels
i'm a lone huge kamachi fan
discord one? no
in 1 week
JS06 INSTA translates
yes.
is released.
NT22R
spans over 6 months?
that THE WHOLE INDEX TIMELINE
don't forget
he will restart.
at vol 45.
is not even finished
look the series
even if it has its ending
it's not a finished story
OT is just a buildup
Index 3 was like destroyed
Reki learning to write
SAO? Sao ALL COMES down to one thing
Shield hero is great
*raises hand* nobuna has ended *cries*
^
there are bad LNs too
Bad anime, bad manga
look as there are
^
There are amazing LNs around
the sequel is at vol 3?
since mondaiji ended
but that one is slow to release and slow to translate
is mondaiji
my other favourite one
WHERE IS MY CREDIT CARD
I'VE TO START READING THAT
ONII SAMA
i have to admit that and it took years to realize.
even more than nasuverse and gear
it's my fav franchise
look
legit point.
it's just a franchise
why are you getting angry lol
same as touma
is underwhelming as a word
so much
after she realizes her love
does HUGE stupid things
And really mikoto
^
i guarantee that.
and no she's not harmless.
Misaka is a teenager.
And touma harem doesn't hamper the plot
true Index is Urban fantasy
hm?
but hey no spoily spoil
she drastically changes
only to effectively || stop from being a tsundere a certain point ||
Mikoto stalls a bit with the chardev
and a 16 years old boy
don't pretend too much from a 14 years old girl
anyways.
and don't judge the main series on that.
anyways one last word on index, i respect people not delving in it and criticizing the anime, it's alright, just know that it was just a supper
and it's one of the most expensive 2011 animes
pretty hard to adapt
It's a boiling potato
js06
@js_06
Forever drowning in Kamachi and Kawakami
from her twitter
millhi
translates his stuff
and only the mad translator JS06
but kawakami is a madman
aya
not in the anime
and a HUGE distant prequel
and has a HUGE distant sequel
it's HUGE
is Horizon in the middle of nowhere
the most known one
Kawakami LNs
seriously.
but i'm scared.
reading kawakami
i gotta start
anyways
darn u millhi
LOL
ah
as i know
it's ongoing
it's not the same story in this case
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
i read the WN
the anime follows the LN
that one.
it has one of the bests world building
MILLHI
but i gotta say DARN THE WORLD BUILDING
i will put it on hold
of reading death march
i just got bored
since many of those are copypaste
you gotta find the right ones
nah there are a lot of good isekais
😂
this is how i ended up in oda nobuna official fantl private group
You have to delve a bit to find translations
i'm joking anyways
beat me
epic of gilgamesh best book

today i was looking at my library, i remembered that i have to buy new accel world tled volumes
your realize that digimon adventures was maybe the first isekai

Morgiana best waifu
Magi <3
Oh dear
hmmm, well i don't really mind uploading for him, lemme first take a look at it
<@456226577798135808> i do have wallpaper engine, but as far as i recall you don't have to upload the wallpaper to the steam workshop when you make it, you can use it locally.
And certain dialogues are cut off in the adaptation
Damn sora
The ecchi factor is more pushed there
Ngnl ln
I started reading
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> the concept of the plot reminds me a lot of fsn one
In fate of course!
Where i have seen this type of situation...
Watching granbelm...
KOno shinpu
In granbelm
But no kirei
Nice one
Yeah lol
get scared when i hear "steam version"
I sometimes
isn't tled right?
refrain
Haruka Saigusa
(purple chat domination again btw)
i don't remember her name
uh
in the anime
she was my fav character
D:
KURUGAYA
tbh
i loved the anime
😂
it was included during "grab them all before fuwanovel shuts down"
i will play it someday
i have it downloaded
i bet saya no uta was just the kickstart
a master of suffering solo?
that's how you became
Lol
on par with LN
i find vn such a superior media
it's a shame sorano
well i just leave the sys locale on jp nowadays
Moon runes!
^
Oh that yes
just system locale.
No no sorano
what do you mean aya?
hmm
LOL
a lot easier
now it's easier
comes with discussing
the best part
(i wont play today tho, got too late)
is so good
i'm continuining Muv luv extra
vn discussion
Ayaaaa
*this chair*
Shiki is just not right in the head
except one there
and i've not read tsukihime ones
except 2
i did like the scenes
no to be honest
*mollusks*
goddamn it.
<@279341087494242304> when talking of terrible h scenes my mind flashes shirou's dream
SEE
^
good
OG experience is OG experience
many novels got destroyed
Gn
Comes out
I can easily see the spoiler channel imploding when 4 th muv luv
Lol
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
hook it up in a container.
like Chaos head's protag
everyone can live
rip
D:
i don't have a job atm
was that a joke?
hah
on my hdd
that i think i have 100 gb of them saved
i got so many vns to play
okay
.
Then your hear scream.
i've a looong journey
yeah it's on plan to read
i'm yet to read it
the only original
|| the torso ||
current one is painful
it is a plot driven thing
well at least
look phos is a nice character but i really don't like that haircut
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
tastes
that's an eyesore
ugh
i got angry there.
eh
|| a bit angry their ruined lapis pretty hair ||
i have problems recognizing some of them
oh that
|| everything goes to crap ||
i agree on that
Yes
and || poor phos ||
back then, when i watched the anime i had no clue it could evolve this far
my mind just blew up
i'm on pair with houseki no kuni manga
Lol rip
gotcha
oh
is it good?
Yeah i looked it up a bit
MJP?
ooh railgun third
if i have something more to add
yeah
|| other point that made me angry is borz stopping adamant pray by stopping phos ||
We will get new ln in feb
Keep going <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
And it's fun how she ends in having the same relevance as mikoto
I loved her in the novels
Misaki is a great character
But it is needed
|| they killed battle royale arc and damaged ww3 afterall ||
Just make him the premise that it is an half assed adaptation that should act only as buildup for the plot that comes later
Yes
oh dear never forget
NICE
That's savage
Touma not saving mikoto
Ooooooh dear
Since is half assed
Tl;dr it is okay, watch it, but do not expect too much
Counting that the chance we will get New testament adaptation is not nil
that's why you can say it's pretty unique
it ended in being a whole different deal sharing only several ideograms with the china
cuz isolation and crap
in a very original fashion
solo it evolved from chinese
Some things just cannot be conveyed outside japanese since it's such an unique language, you can only interpret, and that's bound to some loss
what do i read now on my phone? <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
i feel doomed
that i'm on pair with Eden's Zero, World Trigger and freaking Houseki No kuni
uhm now
best scene in the anime adaptation
100/100
to recover from that scene.
it took 15 minutes to me
else you would miss this || https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFQVdBBkiFM ||
lol
eh ok
but

it's not that i don't like comedy
sorry guys i just can't stand it.
was lucky star
another one of my most disliked
it's been a while since i watched School SoLs
busy playing muv luv for now
but i admit i've yet to finish the vn
i did, i was left like "meh"
the VN is the real deal
Chaos;head is a damaged good

i forgot to ask you last time you told me you're italian
oh yeah akeupho
i mean i watch what i feel watching
well same
i dodge sport related ones mostly
hmmm i think my taste is quite wide
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's badly adapted!
sns is not trash
Hey!
*hides*
that 10/10 on shakugan no shana
i regret nothing from my early tastes
poor dola
i mean at least for me, i can deal with that
in the end it's okay in both medium
it's more what he says/thinks
it's not what he does
the anime doesn't do the best job in showing it
reading No game no life LN, i notice more and more how depraved Sora is
if not i will jsut end up start reading *glorious nippon*
will look into it
wait the breaker?
it's time to read
ooooh i know what
anyways i still don't know what to read
😂
oh come on at least he's not "overpowered until alicization" kirigaya kazuto
well anyways
😂
he gets the best gals
okay
it means i'm not insisting
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
no i'm doing hands up
hands up
(and accel world is cooler than sao)
he improves a lot.
but if i can break a spear in his defence, he's a "From the bottom to the top" character type
but the anime makes him seem shorter by the drawings
134 cm
he's short indeed
hah poor haru
lol
because i said that accel world was cool
i got insulted twice
look that reminds me
Echo chamber?
then there's me watching log horizon and world trigger 6 times.
and tastes are cool because they're different
it's tastes
why feeling bad
lol
cya akeupho
that those went to sleep
it's since everything got isekai'd
*giff battle schools back*
now that i think of it
i reccomend it as "pure japanese humor"
best jokes.
was great.
Sakamoto desu ga
Hey
😂
you mad bro, during christmas, that's a suicide here
so don't worry
while trying to spin my brain
trying to digest Christmas eve's dinner
it's also me
sorry
i didn't get your point on the spot
oh ok
|| that feel when you understand she knows touma from years before mikoto ||

He is both the writer and the illustrator

Interesting note

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

it needs to be in every gundam game!
D:
GP03
but but
D:
AAAAaaa
*cima garahau best character*
*giff back my 0083*
*notices gundam*
*peeks*
😦
i don't agree
*all the suffering*
s2 was the best part
nooo
since it's gandamu
but that doesn't count
and it's still an understatement
Ibo was amazing
from Turn A
even aldnoah zero itself is basically half ripped
Good mecha shows are a bit scarce nowadays
This
^
goddamn it.
and accelerator anime has the highest budget
which was a full package
it was included in the Toaru project
well
rip.
absolutely
now i'm mad.
released in late november 2019
goddamn it.
and i just discovered that Cima Garahau's figure does exist
hell yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yia_6E-7X90 Gaaaah, good opening gets good cover 10/10
i ALMOST FORGOT that masaaki endoh the winner back in the day!
OH DEAR
but they survived and they saved my tears
it is sad
of big rang episode
but yeah i was about to cry at the end
lmao
no seriously i was amazed
it has true valvaro vibes in it, plus it's a carrier!
10/10
AWESOME
IS
BIG RANG
last episode of apocalypse 0079 igloo
<@!238855496797257729> i just watched
anyways
without fail.
of igloo makes me feel bad
it's amazing how every damn episode
but yeah
Salamis Kai maybe
they seem a bit different
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh yeah some nice AA || https://puu.sh/EUIVc/d69486fa18.jpg || just what i needed
i will rewatch rezero
oh
were the most memorable characters
Yuno and Uryuu Minene (eyepatch)
|| expecially when he abruptly shifts his way at episode 18 ||
second is yukiteru
main one is the epilogue
Mirai nikki had several problems
Lol akeupho
i'm dumb
oh true
WHERE IS OVERLORD
WITH ITS HARDCOVER
about LNs?
you talk
oh yeah let's add gate to my fav decade anime
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Oh i started reading gate millhi
but it's still nice to see a good LN getting adapted
is something happened to me years ago
<@!139432096023183360> taste shifting towards ln
heh
what about it millhi <:Ver:336656981144109066>
But my top favs were (disordered): 
- log horizon
- mondaiji tachi
- world trigger
- symphogear
- fate ubw and hf 
- gundam ibo, unicorn
And i'm sure i'm forgetting stuff
Very hard question
Fav from the decade
rip
they just don't have enough taste.
if they give you a weird look
haha
rip
ikr
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
time to translate CCC
go millhi
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
to us
you gave decent kanji translations before
that's not true akeupho
moonrunes aint gonna run
don't worry millhi
rip
had to waste my time somehow
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i was going to rome to attend at N4 akeupho
in train
during my trip
look i just don't care, i brought a LN to read
goddamn it.
that takes priority
yeah this discussion reminds me that i have to buy vol 14-15 of accel world
anyways
i'm joining the VN crew now
good for me
and MAHOUKA OF COURSE
sooner or later
i promised myself i would read grimgar
lols
julis ❤️
of asterisk
i need to buy new volumes
right that reminds me
where is infinite stratos? <:Ver:336656981144109066>
it's fine
still
NGNL volume 2
i just finished reading
lol
wtf is this cover
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0505Foa8_x8
<@!238855496797257729>
most remembered
i was talking about
like FMAB was for the decade before it
sao of course
well of the decade
well don't tell me, i'm absolutely loving it and i'm still playing extra.
then there is me falling in solo trap and starting to like sumika in muv luv
oh white graduation
the names?
spill
(i had a ragequit during AF okay??)
i still can't get over my hate for nagisa
ugh clannad
pay no heed to this person who is still embarking on VNs
so yeah sry i had to ask
lol i felt lost
WA2 = wild arms 2?
.
expecially after a certain point
Touma *IS* one of the best LN protags
~~ until touma butts in ~~
she has her moments
yeah
she's my least liked character of the whole series
damn kuroko
indeed
hype
new colony drop when
Lol
Same lol
like? <#377148557796442134> com ehere
of 6 MONTHS
Index has a Plotspan
and pay one important detail
everything that needed to be closed got closed in NT22
to use them in later volumes
He leaves details open ended
pratically.
really honestly
i'm not finding your point there
hm?
is making new characters and leaving them be
look the only thing i found detrimental
did*
i didn't find another LN that blew my mind as index id
i disagree with it
meh
look i've yet to read other his works
and he's always ahead at least 10 volumes
he presents huge manuscripts
There's a thing about kamachi
his pen will keep writing driven by his ghost
😂
Yea in another universe
Kamachi?
Slowed?
after 45 volumes
touma power is something we still don't really know what is
i agree.
no the anime doesn't do justice
ODA
you can feel it in the air
the cliffhanger
toaru at the top ~

!
I loved it
What a waste D:
Musaigeeeeeeeeen
is Rail Wars LN serious?
i didn't know that
really?
+1
>trinity seven
aya
i sensed culture there
Hol dup
lmao rail wars
gotta catch up with the two last tled volumes
oda nobuna novel
i'm reading
++++++++++
NOBUNA
it stops being fun
that would be overkill
LOL
yeah
okay i do get hyped too when i hear something i like is going to get animated in next seasons
am i the only one that kinda doesn't care about seasons and stuff
in the end
it's a thematic
some use it as a genre
some use it as a term
i guess
in that case
in the cyberpunk category
yeah but we kinda fall
but yeah biggest isekaing could be LH indeed
it's a stupid thin line i know.
that's a cyberworld
it's not a proper isekai
videogame isekai like log horizon
what.
<@!279341087494242304>
Wait wait
i don't understand
????
http://ln-news.com/page-48826/?fbclid=IwAR1LUNesy86vlQC7suMRxA2rTbwudqkFqGrPAxKJPYk20lE5zm9OeEuNoCY full list
anyways how is this bookworm you were venting before?=
legit.
oooh
the vibe you get from the LN...
i'm reading GATE LN
but holy cow
Lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what hurts the most?
got knife'd
he didn't get truck'd
what about the slime
D:
truck is the hard way
c-come on even a gate or a summon would have worked
D:
irl isekai when
aya
00 did
i damn loved the geopolitical mess
*an occurrence of me and millhi sharing tastes*
I AGREE
OOO
they were nothing spectacular
i have to agree on this
discount char
sunrise and their budget
first FHD gundam
well
then decided i goddamn loved it an jumped onto UC timeline <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
starting from 00
actually i approached gundam
gundam 00 is pretty good
ooooh
they cost that much?
lol
*cries*
usually is  around 11-12€
15€ for one volume is a bit too much tho
hmmm
30 bucks for 2 accel world volumes
*very cultured place*
i never went wrong in following suggestions here
well i will catch your suggestion
i will start watching
ok
has the anime finished airing
ok ok
oh you didn't catch up yet
what does your taste say millhi?^
and related events
that unveils what was behind haman karn
it's a manga
Char's deleted affair
(gundam CDA anyone? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )
o7 for Daguza
on the other side, i really liked Bernard monsha, Cima Garahau, Haman Karn and the poor Daguza from unicorn
lmao
*bright slap*
that's priceless.
Bright getting angry
tho i enjoyed as always
she worsened the situation.
and Fa didn't help
(kamille destroyed my fun)
by the way, my fav is 0083 and my least liked was Zeta
lol
That sounds like ZZ <:Ver:336656981144109066>
(oh i gotta take a look to hathaway's flash too)
i'm stuck at F91 in timeline
i've yet to read crossbone
Tv show
<@!238855496797257729> <@!99695384296701952> what is the gandamu you enjoyed the most? *curiosity*
will think after that
i will watch the 3 OVAs of IGLOO 2 soon
ty
gotta recover it
okay
00 events?
is it before or after
Lol
yeah i missed
D:
i missed it then
hmmm?
*scared of missing content*
movie?
what
ore wa gundam
so i don't know
well i don't go on 4chan
(pol i meant)
i guess that's going overboard
LOL
what were those boards?
pardon my ignorance
this of course it's a personal opinion
anyways i understand your view on the matter but i think the whole deal it's a bit of a stretch
zakus were cool
but but
and the ones pointing out that Zeon was made of spacenoids were the feds
on a "Spacenoid vs earthling" level thing
well zeon came down
:/
i think you must not fuse the "Sieg Zeon" with irl fascism
but then Zabi happened
char dad was right
well yeah
LOL
the other one saying zeon was right
you get one gundam saying the feds were right
it's a on/off switch
well if you think of it
the whole point of the OYW was that NO one was right
melua
you dislike unicorn too much
i will just go back yelling gatouuuu then
goddamn i'm so curious
to watch NT
i've yet
oh
yeah lmao
well thanks for the 4chan explanations
lmao
waifus always make people shake hands
hah
mu?
rip
book when
Lesson: 4chan explained by melua
some heavy weapon nerds  there
on k
oh i've seen some posts
oh lmao
i think that's more dangerous than pol
Lol
b and d are for?
gotcha
i see the picture a bit better, what happened an animal from pol dumped zeon hype on m?
unexpected tho
it wasn't?
wasn't the whole thing adapted?
i mean
<@!152896851660505088> what is going to adapt???
NEW HIGU?
WAT
lol
now that i notice it
no seriously i'm costantly hoarding LNs and VNs
*says as he hoards LNs*
hm link in pm if you don't mind, even if i think i would have found it on my own
*adds to plan 2 read*
is it worth to read?
hm
damn Gits has such awesome soundtracks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfUpn6pJFrs
|| like vs Jibril and vs Izuna, it's A LOT clearer how sora/shiro won ||
it explains certain parts better for sure
gotta say that the anime adaptation was okay, of course some details went missing but nothing too big
NGNL vol 3
oookay and i finished reading
I crave for more and more isekais
Yet
Oooo the logout vibeeee
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
(and give me more demon chan plzplz)
Hype
My memory is rather fresh
Well i did read 22r just 2 weeks after it got tled
Lol
I'm more hyped for this than railgun t
<@138131889142628352> <@472513526393602059> genesis testament vol 1 cover!

しかたがないよ
Boring MC well that's a curse
you gotta be creative
the problem is in drawing originality from them
well <@!139432096023183360> harem antics can be good
shield girl?
go on <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
gomen
i've re-read the sentence
hm no nvm i'm stupid
please
sorano do not spoil
and only my railgun
than sister noise
well it's surely better

what show are we talking here?
*peeks*
true
honzuki no gekokujo
goddamn it is good
anyways i'm watching bookworm
i forgot about hesitation snow
ooooh
wasn't like a 3rd season announced or something?
oh speaking of sidonia
two of the openings that sometimes still pop out in my head are sidonia's openings, goddamn it, so good
i didn't get it
Hm
well anyways there are lots and lots of openings that i love
HAH
fair^
(we should organize some rounds of AMQ sometimes here like 2 years ago)
woh that would overkill me
if i have to start thinking of my fav openings
the emotional attachment, the visuals and the song itself are all 3 important
on this reasoning
Well i have to agree
but i do like tracks like black bullet, fortissimo opening, future gazer and such
i don't like judgelight either
and two that my taste cannot stand are Only my Railgun and Sister's Noise
well no really, let me add details to that statement
i'm not a fan of fripside but i like some tracks
Yes.
i will watch the ep later
soon
soon man
(talking about sao never gets old)
but yeah alicization is just good for a lot of reasons that are spoilers mentioning
yuuki helping yuuki
now i'm thinking abou tthat millhi
Lol
LEGIT
LOL
FORTRESS
DWARF
she tried
kirito would have not accessed the || cheat console ||
if she didn't drop the key down to kirito
Asuna saved herself there
And on ehting i noticed on rewatch
storyu
well ALO was the classic damsel in distress
she really didn't do anything wrong
by the fanbase
asuna gets hated for nothing
regarding asuna being mentioned
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
"MAIN"
Goddamn subs
and
your suggestion was worth it
so yeah
but i usually flip over bad adaptations
so i don't really care if it's a bearable degree
are always bound to some losses
anime adaptations
the adaptation i meanm
but it seems pretty solid
the LN
i haven't read
and yeah it's sad
while keeping the isekai thematic
the thing shows how can you do pretty and original stuff
<@!139432096023183360> just saw ep 11 of bookworm
the only huge problem i have with it || is spoiling UBW NP ||
after all those years i have to admit it is a passable entry
as an entry for me
Well it served
Fate/deen?
did i read
or "how can you understand your GPS in english!"
"how can you read a whole book in english, you're a dictionary"
i always tried to dodge italian translations, even if people do make jokes on me because of that
well yeah
... Achievements...
with "Realizzazioni"
they had to double it down
and that was not enough
LOL
HOW
HOW HOW EUPHO
HECK UP
THE
HOLD
the last anime i saw in sub  ita (i already used to watch sub eng way before that, but that ended my relationship with italian translations)
and that was
no really
i wanted to punch the wall that time
italian dynit subs on SAOA: Gungale online, subbing the main character surname as "Coffee" since it was "Kohi"
reminds me years ago
the Main deal
it doesn't justify it.
that makes it even worse millhi
ffs
toaru kagaku no index
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
even the freaking kanjis are light years apart
Kagaku with Majutsu???
confuse
HOW CAN YOU
I MEAN
NO
THE
free to spoil the title
Like millhi?
WHY?
DAMN
JUST
SISSY
no i can't stand another toaru getting murdered so i will just wait.
then
i will wait another sub
Did CR fail
?
i didn't see it yet
if you want to keep it canon
you can't really derail on toaruverse
or it will start following mikoto|| around the world ||
i mean i still think that either the manga will come an halt
and railgun is canon
because the timeline itself doesn't kinda allow it?
we will have a railgun 4th season
i don't think
lmao
<@!238855496797257729>
Third
Tate no yuusha is cool
Nooo
and cuz i use 60 fps emulations sometime
for quality
i just yarr harr
but i think i need to start watching macross
i might have said this before
|| the mana outburst scene was freaking great tho ||
and myne is qt.
again it shows that isekai doesn't do bad
it's nice
i mean
i finished bookworm anime
<@!139432096023183360>
i'm sending something to you in pm
aya aya
Lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHPbhb1ozX0 *I BELONG TO YOU*
starting back from the start
so good
watched only F so far
starting back from the start
SHEEPS
THE
but it was not horrible
there were some cgi fails
and best butler is best butler
|| about the empire being cocky ||
come on s3 opened the whole deal
i don't understand why people hate s3
S3 didn't suck
need more momonga sama
(GIFF ME OVERLORD S4)
if you mix those together they lose meaning
has its own vibe
that every one of those isekais
The point is
i watched only ep 1-2
it's meant to be funny
eh
i'm not following isekai quartet anyways
oppai loli goddess

seems an interesting variant of the classic male maou mc
tbh the concept of the demon lord parent being a female
https://myanimelist.net/anime/23233/Shinmai_Maou_no_Testament same author

the author dropped the whole project
sad thing?

the declaration on the ice trone
of that arc
during the last part
i was shivering
TN TN!
but that's worldbuilding
Like half of the lizardmen deal was boring
i just didn't like some parts
i've been impressed and overhyped since s1
plz millhi
just how much different the novel is
Lol
she doesn't?
hold upo
pls staph
is that the same deal with the poor asuna'
D:
yeah
i'm weird ikr?
i'm going to buy it
but since i really really liked the show
i already have the pdfs
tbh
gotcha
oh
it clearly showed that you just can't
was great
Gazel deal
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

it is pretty close
as far as i know
?
uhm'0
just out of dedication.
buying the novel
well i know i will end up
it's not a single failed episode who is going to tank the sales
you still sell the blu rays
In that case radyjko
Imho
is True Neutral
Momonga
*furu controru encauntah*
(and rayneshia best character)
cya
hf
D:
where
where is log horizon millhi
what else
it's just i don't get tired of the isekai tematic
nah to be honest i was exaggerating
is forbidden.
but of course crap like smartphone isekais
because i love isekais
the more i want them
the more i watch isekais
where is PANDORA'S ACTOR
just because he was right, it doesn't mean he was correct
him masterplanning and Ainz not knowing a thing
that's the best part
NOOO COME ON
*sasuga ainz sama*

plays
*UTSUKUSHIKI ASSASSIN*
but yeah she was prettier
more
they had to show her ears
a bit
so s1 just overdid with the hair
She is an Elf Cleric-Woodcrafter and the leader of a guild named the Crescent Moon Alliance.
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/log-horizon/images/2/27/Maryelle_cc.png/revision/latest?cb=20150609215238
she was covering those
yeah
in s1
covering the ears
it's just her hair
she was an elf
no i remember
I have to fucking agree with you there
but come on tax evasion in japan? that's a free ticket to jail
i was sad when i found out the author was jailed
i've watched that show like 5 times?
i loved both season tho
i can understand that
but
do not underestimate yourself
are worse.
the faces and the haircuts tho
than those in s1
in s2 are far superior
well tbh the armors and the outfits
about the design
oh you talkingt
<@!238855496797257729> you talking about what?=
Yasuharu takahashi is a god
list of soundtracks
has an outstanding

Why one rapier
Come on people everyone loved our dear cat and his soundtrack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGv-PG5aXSg

she was cool
oh roe2
*touches glasses*
YOU GET SHIROE MASTERPLANS
and come on
yesh
ye
during s2
even if i found that the a bit boring bit
yeah krika is right
anyways
no op kirito anymore
Blackraiden go watch alicization
While Shiroe is the main character, the series is not focused on him
and a society
you watch a group of protags
you don't watch a protag
Yeah in log horizon
😂
There you go!
Log Horizon - how your time will be spent
10% Cute girls
10% awesome opening
30% fast awesome action 
50% politics
y
it becomes a concern on s2
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/096/166/33a.png
y
could be
Sao and LH are very different
but other than that
just hints
it hints that
i will hands up on that
hmmm
is a cyberpunk subgenre
Virtual World is not a proper isekai
same as LH
SAO is Cyberpunk
They're trapped and they're trying to adapt to their surroundings
and marks on the fact that's a game
Politics
talks about Economics
Log horizon
they bring up "return home" just at the last 2 episodes as a possibility
they did not realize that while it has a similar premise, log horizon focused on a totally different style and set of thematics
hell i remember people flaming about LH vs SAO in youtube comments
the anime covers up to vol 10
!

it's important
it MUST KEEP DATABASE
this is why
since same composer
fairy tail pops up in your mind
is while you hear soundtracks
about log horizon
the fun thing
legit
not enough keikaku doori power?
a question, why my glasses do not shine like that when i do the same? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Late s2
And s2
Spoilers
|| So a government needed to be formed ||

Eh can i disagree the first thematic is the adventurers
So it's fair
Started about politics
Log horizon
It's fine
Hypeeee
S3!

Log horizon
YESTERDAY
I was talking of lh
Kidding me?
You
Are
Awww the power of the afterwords
Made the manga adaptation
His wife who is also a mangaka
The ln is both written and illustrated by him
First and foremost
Ngnl author is a mangaka
Regarding some artworks
It was tracing
and he has not been reported for that as long as i know part 2
As long as i know
Is ongoing
Ngnl
1-2 are adapted to ln
6 wn volumes
Then he wrote
Tax evasion
After going out
He started writing again
He's been in jail for like 8 months
Regarding the author
but you can't know that if you don't read the LN
WHY so many girls do gather around him
Volume 13 explains quite openly
regarding the girls
And keep in mind
but he's quick
he's not a genius
who reflect in games
in his mental skills
all lies
KYH is 14 herself
Haru is 13.
Kirito is 16
from a Middle School kid?
Why do you expect more
and he succeeds.
he deserves a lot for tryharding
to the top
a Main character made from the bottom
Haruyuki arita is literally
i saw some of his videos
yes kinda
you get ALL THE NEW characters without knowing who they are
it's a side story of vol 22
lol
that movie should never have existed
when i saw what they did with infinite burst
i was angered a lot
i don't know about that
are published in 2009
both AW and SAO
he's writing*
as accel world
keep in mind he wrote sao at the same time
and his writings improved too
he started connecting pieces
we are on vol 22+ atm.
at volume 7/8
Accel world was to end
quite drastically tbh
you notice that Reki changed his mind while writing at some point
well jokes aside i read Accel world and if you take a look to the Afterwords
lol
in his mind
retcon
y it could be a retecon
there is a lot of hypothesis that were going on that || kuroyukihime is kirito and asuna daughter, many pieces intersect || but Reki said that it is false
at most
middle aged
AW 2045 starts
SAO 2022 starts
same universe
Alicization || could be just Accel world prologue if you analize the events ||
it's a full on strike
or Accel world
Alicization particular
this fits sao a lot more than isekai.
`` In some cyberpunk writing, much of the action takes place online, in cyberspace, blurring the line between actual and virtual reality.[29] ``
from wikipedia
quoting
it is hinted that ||LH is not in  a virtual world ||
the problem is the setting being a *Virtual World*
zero
it's people getting their shit wrong
it's cyberpunk
isekai
SAO is not a proper
what
i-m here
uh
aside from the time skip
but i don't have issues with aincrad
I know
like that
dodging whole clips of m16
it's just inhumane
no cuz he never played the game
the phantom bullet arc
Kirito literally DESTROYED
Shinonon did nothing wrong
this kinda turns down major plot points
is that he's made too much op
The problem with him
But regarding kirito
to confirm that
there's even a scene in Excalibur arc
the whole harem stood down and left asuna the spot
someone is going to snatch kirito
come on it isn't like
so can you really hate a character for getting a minor role?
she was a secondary minor character in phantom bullet
asuna acted as a damsel just in that arc
but tbf
kaguya
I agree with you
i didn't knewwwwwwwwww
WAT
IS AYAHI
<@!152896851660505088> HENRIETTA
WAIT
how we talked about it just yesterday
it's hilarious
once again?
for Deen Marielle
are you ready
<@!152896851660505088> so say
in fairy dances
hated for playing the damsel in distress
poor asuna
*hides*
by refusing to go to bed with asuna in the anime
has his little dirty share
even kirito
not 90 cms!
he's 134 cm tall
he was drawn even shorter than he already is lol
but he's deeper than he seems
exactly
here
let's not spoil more
y
in first arcs
tbh he's being an ass to his close friends
from the bottom to the top.
again
he is a dumbass at the start
is KYH
the only one that wants haru
but by watching the anime only
i know
eh
from aincrad.
alicization is a full blown backfire
i have to strongly disagree
no
since it' s broken
but i know that kirito doesn't use it because it is unfun
grrr i don't recall
excalibur IS plot relevant
Tho as far as i know
oh i ignore that arc
where i already told u
but i think this is a deja vu
mother rosario, no kirito asuna only
at the best part.
you dropped
lol.
sao discussions every time
it's fun flaring up
anyways
is ayahi
i didn't know henrietta
but jokes aside
RIP MILLHI
HAAHA
10 hours ago
announced
S3
with you about log horizon too?
aya was i discussing
is bad
to watch stuff
forcing people
it's like me spoiling Turn a gundam by playing SRW alpha gaiden
Lol aya
so yeah
Alice had a forced development || due to the brainwash ||
Alice is not a bad character neither
^
he's a secondary character there
around kirito
because it doesn't revolve
and buy dlcs
gotta continue that
I have Fatal bullet!
in the suggestions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyl95CtkAJc it threw at me absolute duo opening
Youtube is evil
OH GOD NO
oh god
lols
you learn fast
good job shirabe
well alicization build the basis to support accel world
THINGS
Sinon MADE
Great shirabe
LOL
!
come on he was sentenced for tax evasion
that would be a crime
*i hope i get more rayneshia*
*detabeis*
you can't give LH a different opening!
it's THE TRADEMARK
NOH
detabeis
~~ else gonna send a keigo filled email filled with complaints <:Ver:336656981144109066> ~~
D:
I PRETEND DATABASE AS OPENING
OH
s1 and s2
in b4 it surpasses
i confused you and millhi?
that's a smart move
Oh nice
it's the channel?
?_?
if they keep s2 designs
i said rip millhi for Marielle hair
btw
but again we are talking about deen
you have so much screentime to waste
it **must** be good
Well i have to say if they take 13 eps to adapt 2 volumes
of releasing it
vol 13 LN just for  the sake
in b4 Sneeaky reelease
Well 13 is still only a WN
same as vol 12 title.
it's the damn name of the season
|| Log Horizon: Fall of the Round Table ||
you can't call it like that
Log Horizon: || Entaku Hōkai ||
Come on.
jokes put aside yeah LH s3 name is lame
😂
playing dumb
and this is me
dxd D:
Op MC male maou
but it has the alternative to the usual
Aya i don't know
well tastes cast
Hagure yuusha...
the one made by the same author of
maou no testament?
Shinmai
(AND THE TECH)
and the characters
for the plot direction
but i prefer asterisk
on the same level
i place rakudai and asterisk
that much
i didn't like blade dance
Seirei Tsukai No blade dance, Asterisk, Rakudai
of that period
well it's the Battle school trinity
they missed entire volumes
it's because
Rakudai no kishi no cavalry
and you get || stella in the bathroom scene just at ep 3! ||
you go vol 1 to vol 4
2 VOLUMES
Rakudai literally JUMPED
for one reason
i disagree
lol
i know that aya
she's not known
https://myanimelist.net/people/35725/Shiena_Nishizawa
by shiena nishizawa
asterisk's openings are sung
+ badass graphics 
+ badass openings
that's why i don't mind the mc
asterisk values secondary characters
look
|| he just deactivates the limit at some point and can stay in op mode for HOURS ||
but blocked by an enchantment
The mc is already overpowered
with something
you need to strike the watcher/reader
here
i even have the physical LN
i liked asterisk war a lot.
you need to do something good
but if you need to reuse it
it doesn't bother me re-usage of thematics
and mind you, i *do like* battle school concept
i watched all of it too
like 6?
i gave it something
eeeh i know
bad with franchise resellers
it's me being
eeeh
link link!
oh it's new to me
amiami?
well it-s the standard price for HQ figures
oh
ne ne touma, oboete nai? ~ Yukachi
yup
Yes
is pretty unique
Index LN artstyle
maybe zero is one of the less known ones
are generally on the mainstream side
Dengeki published series
i agree
yes
it's nice
i reeeally liked grimoire of zero
oh dear
but yeah i apologize for before
lol "ignorance is bliss"
eh i know
<@!231025503643893770> anyways sorry if i seemed harsh there, i didn't want to sound mean, i liked rakudai too but i don't appreciate when you skip content in an adaptation
i'm scared to ask
how many bucks?
D:
did great
i saw that DxD novel
a girl in underwear.
there's just a scene in ep 1 and that's it
then you watch the anime and you notice there's no ecchi.
as ecchi
how asterisk is labeled
btw fun
wow
in the ln
when she has a badass katanalike sword
a mere katana
reminded how the anime gave todou kirin
we had today about asterisk
the talk
y
gotcha
do you follow something to notice new stuff?
it's a market you have to follow closely
with buying figures is those being often out of order when i find them
my only problem
the best
https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=FIGURE-050378
!
<@!238855496797257729>
HEH
i see good prices
for featured products
the prices were high
ok nvm me
goddamn it
amazing figures
The prices are a bit high but it does have
i guess lol
the shipping insane prices
okay so you just have to put up
where does the website ship?
you are too much pessimist
pls
D:
Then you take isekai quartet and confirm it into the trash can
announced
Overlord s4
in b4 we get
you teaching shirabe bad stuff
D:
Fu aya.
DxD.
*the GOOD ones*
*ISEKAI OVERLOAD*
SHIELD HERO S2
SLIME s2
!
rezero 2
but yeah
Log horizon game system!
PLS
"Hey i cannot run"
but LOL
it's not bad, it's great
i'm facepalming more and more
i started shield girl
Oh
log horizon 3 and world trigger 2!
this year is a blast
sub calm down
this excalated quickly
oh dear
New index novel
Eh but genesis testament is coming out
<@138131889142628352> <@472513526393602059> touma disappeared from kamachi website

it kinda deserves it
well as i said it is an original way of isekai something
!
MYNE
i'm liking it a lot so far, much better than fairy tail
i forgot to check eden's zero new chapters
oh i dear
keep that scourge away from me
of school days
and last ep
I know only ep 1
where
Tragic ending
it's fucking accurate.
Kamachi must have studied that stuff
look the amazing thing about index is how || the whole magic side mechanics are based off thelema ||
it's scary <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
that's the problem
the sentence makes sense
nailed it.
this thios
LOL
EH
will save it
dispatch the link
those are okay spoilers
well
don't ask why i asked this
what do you think about aleister?
one question tho
Lol
Ehm shirabe?
happens
at some point
i wolfed down entire volumes
it is the 2nd best.
and othinus is not the best arc.
it gets crazy
so keep reading
people started questioning at one point if the true villain is touma himself, this is an opinion from the fanbase, not a spoiler
:3
keep reading
eeeeeh
where you were at on NT agian?
*hides*
now give me evil touma
the important thing is understanding the mistake
the human is made to be wrong
things like these happen
dw
overdoing it is not.
is a right thing to do
Pointing out that Railgun is not enough to judge touma
In short
just do not attack people for it
this is true too^
even if it is not right
^
it is my favourite franchise keep in mind that
eh i can understand you
JC st4ff screwing things up
that was
and it's a bliss for the eye
went in overbudget
hmm accelerator anime
which ended in gravitation
but she wanted to compose an opening anyways
after going off with an huge concert
She retired around 2014
that's why
Yes she did
(she even composed s3 first opening out of dedication even if kurosaki maon sang it)
she's a big fan of index novels and claims to have read them all
the sad thing is not being able to get Kawada mami for the ops
those 2 depended on index 3 sales which were much higher than S2 and S1 sales
he said that it depended on Accelerator and Railgun Sales
has been asked about that already
Miki Kazuma
and she becomes a much cooler character
but she || just stops being one after a certain point in the main novels ||
of tsundereness
mikoto can be considered of being on the moderate side
Well
|| tsundere no more, take this fans ||
hah mikoto
so discard that
not him at least
touma doesn't see himself
ps
go sleep <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
fair point
well you live in asia
ah ok
for you
under spoilers
i will still put stuff
if you want sub we can move to <#377148557796442134>
don't worry i wont ruin your fun
sub is at a good point enough to read it
the LN
for whoever doesn't read
that's a spoiler
no you can
0
memory loss
he has no clue on who he was before
that || memory loss is described as Touma first death ||
not touma before july.
we know July touma
and keep in mind
yes and no
Touma ones are a lot more realistic
are pretty utopic
ideals
eeeeh let's say that shirou
and you will understand him better
Touma will wreck himself
don't worry
in public
but they dumped everything on HO and even the director apologized
the money was supposed to be enough to make Both index 3 and Heavy object
when Heavy Object aired
And failed in 2014 too
but they just failed there.
i recognize their ability to make stuff
i do not hate jc staff
do not misunderstand me
it is a disaster.
to index 1 and 2
the schedule
eeeeh if you compare
like index 3
to fix episodes
let's use 14 drawing directors
but come on millhi
😦
they killed jeanne
.
of episode 22
Putting aside the epicness
Apocrypha adaptation was just bad
Apocrypha disagreed
heh not quite
with taking masses of freelancers?
is that the A1 Vibe
heh.
not that they were on "ufotable/sunrise godlike maximum level "
that's what i mean
of 12 episodes.
spinoff
they were a lot for a mere
come on.
Millhi it had amazing animations
at the same time
kamachi writes several novels
but gotta say that he's a monster
he improved
it's mind blowing.
since best index arc is the last one.
gotta say i'm okay with that
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Index Old Testament is done
Index New Testament is done
Index Genesis Testament starts in february
nop
i just hope that an eventual index NT anime doesn't get the same treatment
since the sales went good anyways and the fanbase kinda tanked it
but yeah i wont cry on the wasted milk
1 4 .
fixing the errors
had FREAKING 14 DRAWING DIRECTORS
one of the episodes
2) unhealthy and messed up working  schedule
1) you can't fit 3 volumes in 6 episodes
were for 2 reasons
but index 3 fails
did suffer an hit
all the anime in that period made by jc
even OPM 2
not only
The one that i really found to kinda do battle shonen shenanigans in a different fashion is world trigger
Well
(it is cool but lmao)
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94YBZYzf0zc
back from doom
to my mind
brought me something veeeery weird
that was in general chat
A discussion
:hype:
feb
no jk, i'm happy to learn new things everytime
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
you know too much
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
studio
or even creating its own
which is the magical word which explains why the novel is not centered on index
to index novel name
to add -Toaru
it's the mind who suggested
for Index and SAO
kazuma is the editor
Heavy object
the one i described above
the thing is unstable
incident
after 2014
Miki Kazuma did leave JC staff
?
for explaining me stuff millhi
well thanks
lols
they will come out from this hole?
so you say
And kinji is not and idiotic mc like yuuji
I had lots of fun in reading hna
Ffs
And the plot starts in vol 3.
2 volumes
The anime doesn't do justice as you might imagine
Aria is the one i liked the most
(1 year less)
Same age
Haru 134
Nagi is 138
Aw
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Haru is still shorter by 4 cm
No i lie
She's shorter than our dear haru
Nagi is the smallest
Shana is 141 for comparison
She's like 156 cm
Tho gotta be honest, louise is not that small and it's the worst
Yes it's because of those 5
Oh and taiga
Shana, nagi, louise, aria, and i'm forgetting the 5th
One of the 5 rie kugimiya supreme minitsunderes
But shana is kinda the most iconic tsundere of  otaku subculture
Emiya shirou like
And was like always on a mind of steel mindset
She never dealt with romance
Shana is like 50 years old
Well not really
3 full course
Sns is 24*3
Well it's just. 24 ep deal
So some things are a consequence of that
The author was a member of the jsdf you know
I'm reading the novels and oh boy
And the nationalism is ok in the anime
Go on s2 it's better than s1
|| let's remember the whole attack at the jp ambassador ||
They ran the background
In political negotiation
Eeeh the whole package comes down
Or log horizon
Like gate did
Ofc
Yy
They take up the deal up one step
Well i personally love politics in anime
Yes
Politics!
Oh and of course
Egoist mc is the best
" i don't do this for the others, i do it for myself, else i know i will just start running away"
And there is a cool thing that struck me back at the time
At the same time the strong point
This is kinda the reason that refrained it from doing a lot if success
Wt is a shonen with no powerups, no true power, only skill and wits
And the mcs are not the usual shonen protagonist
Keep on mind that the plot is not original, it's cool how it is developed
But then interesting plot and cool stuff caught me
And tbh i was dropping before ep 6
But the anime has poor quality animations for the first part
Well i suggest it
it's not straight pink
WHILE AA PICKED A WRONG COLOR
S1 GOT ARIA'S HAIR RIGHT
another thing that i pointed up back in the day was
i'm pretty sad the idea of an s2 got discarded
but yeah so good
|| female hysteria only power ups males ||
that was an huge fail
was the one about || the girl who had hysteria mode ||
last volume i read
that will take a while
but i have to resume from scratch
i will
ye
please
do not spoil me
i know about the grandpa deal
kinda
yes
i gotta resume it
Oh crap yes
goddamn it 10/10
about the scarlet bullet deal
when i did read Aria's background
anyways i freaking went on overhype
but it's a mere cameo
int he main novels
look only the MC of AA appeared
when i stopped they were at vol 12
vol 16
arrived until
Translations
Oh good
i got triggered
it's a freaking side side character that appears in ONE VOLUME
from them making HNA AA
and i still have a butthurt
since my memory is from years ago
everything to continue
i would have to re-read
YEAH LMAO
but i didn't have the translations after a certain point
no no i'm reading the LNs
i'm stuck at vol 11-12
arrived
tho i didn't check where the tl
yes!
<@!431214733463519232> Hna so good
D:
Blue head was the best
I hated the red head
Taiga is a bully
Y
Taiga eh
Damn Sherlock
So year aria ages but whrn kinji will be like 45 she will look like 20
Yes
|| long story short aria got hit by a magical bullet, i don't recall the details, by her grandad. "Scarlet bullet" comes from the deal and she ages slowly now + pink eye and hair. ||
It makes sense!
Shirabe nailing it again
O-ok
It's a core plot reason!
And has blode-pink hair
The cool deal revolves as why aria is that small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aisDBrfYJA0 they're pretty good o_o
wtf i'm noticing Asterisk soundtracks just now
same year
first shadowed the second
are the example
Sao and accel world
eh
and the world building D:
The mc backgrounds are bombs
and it's great but it's not something you can handle in 10 eps
i've read the whole light novel
Mondaiji tachi it's just more deep and 10 episode limit killed it
They are like 3 years apart?
But i didn't say it got shadowed
Mondaiji Tachi.
it was me
<@!202444817043685386>
y
HNA is one of those
in the west
well some novels are just less known
tl;dr HNa novels are amazing and translation is advancing
i guess
that's all without triggering spoilers

a || very twisted character ||
but he's become what he has become in the end
yeah i figured that
i'm not interested of knowing his origins
and no i've not watched the prequel neither
of the whole series
He's the most dangerous character
(yet i have a figure of him a friend gifted me)
maybe sindbad was my less fav
they are just great.
from magi
i liked every character
10/10
one of my fav scenes || https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVsS4YwIJfE ||
I TOUGHT THE SAME THING
LOL
ahaha
UGO
a slave regaining a personality
is just awesome.
Morgiana character development
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Aya person of culture re-confirmed
(Morgiana best character)
the 2nd season left it just at the exact half.
seasons
you would need 2 more 25 episodes
tbh
indeed.
It needs an anime form
it's just beautiful.
i'm goddamn amazed
the whole manga
i've read
you talking about magi?
hm?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgkV7cYaV9g *HARU HARU INFIGARU*
(i still get amazed by magi OSTs sometimes)
at least on my side
were good series
most of the anime with good tracks
hm
D:
wasn't bad
com eon asterisk
or battle school
either isekais
isekais ar eneeded
No it's saaad
> but again that's not isekai
I'm DOOMED
but again that's not isekai
does not agree!
Shield girl
this is bs
No calm down
A DISSSASTER
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
how is the isekai overload going?
So aya
D:
of a pun
a dumbed down version
it was
soup
some
hello ^_^
SUNRISE
then the flame goes on for HOURS
"LL is better than idolmaster"
I have a couple of people that used to flame
somehow i feel sad
i feel sad that i'm not getting weekly fairy tail since it ended
i give up
i realized this later...
it's cyberpunk...
so...
that's a digital world
You know about digimon
90% is truly exaggerated
aznyways jokes aside
!
if the mc is the bad guy
You can't show the bad guy
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
then you get clattanoia
a lot.
bring down that number
tbh
that's not true
and you get marielle
i will get some politics
think of her!
MARIELLE
*DETABEIS*
for
is because the batteries are charging up
the reason cuz no isekai
Anyways aya
bring it on!
is always required.

.
Everyone literally wrote Makyuu ichiaval

i remember getting bark at the moon
LOL
OH TRUE
like?
and missing the seasons
The worst thing is getting seasoned
it's awesome.
the anime from hearing the opening
it's a web game where you have to guess
but it's so great.
i'm rusty
like 2 years ago.

Now nothing solo, but i plan to organize some AMQ shenanigans
i corrected.

used to group watch anime
ugh this recalls me when this channel
the hype is building up
but i will definitely try to organize some evenings here
nah it's too late
now a round?
lol
maybe more than mikoto
in the novels
i liked her a lot
Lol

halp
wt
?_?
the good stuff is later on
since it is a long battle shounen
in getting bored in 8 episodes
i'd say you aren't wrong
than in the manga itself
and regarding final season it was portrayed A LOT better in the anime adaptation
it isn't bad
sad
fairy tail final's OSTs are not yet released
now that i think of it
lol really
it's horrible.
<@!152896851660505088> just how bad was gray dressed here? I happened to notice by a youtube suggestion...
https://puu.sh/F4ZNn/27ecd2c13a.png

Lns are life
Solid
did you buy?
what
until the final arc
and then just brushing it away
at the start
in spoiling you who was the final boss
but yeah, after finishing fairy tail i realized that it did a freaking awesome job
and that ticks my brain
he yells too much
goddamn it
but i can't stand Asta
i found it interesting
oh Black Clover
BC?
i got captured after finishing the first 2 miniarcs
As i told you, you weren't wrong
to be skipped absolutely
and FT fillers are the worst
before the arc around ep 100 which is great, you get like "ok arc, mediocre arc, shit filler, ok arc, etc "
the point is like after ep 100 in the anime
it's just an escalation
yeah but it doesn't fail after a certain point
after a certain point
but kinda only goes up without failing
but yeah fairy tail has its highs and lows
LOL
as most series tbh
on monogatari series
i just gave up

you hardcore
5ds had the best main character for sure
D:
GX really?
oh come on
Too much shining draw krika
The only issue of arcv is the "egao" vibe (you must smile else yuya will force you to do so by beating you in a action duel)
And it is pretty good
Arcv does a good job at salvaging the series
Which is worse
Is a disaster.
Zexal is not a weak spot
duel monsters was cool, gx (for me) was pretty weak, 5ds cool, zexal is a disaster, i loved arcv and i wont speak for vrains since i don't know much about it
but gotta say yu gi oh anime have highs and lows
GX has that jaden flop vibe that ugh
and more serious plot
Mal is not even a meme at this point
where deen/stay night is at
But the vn is something god like, except for fate route which i still find ugly
Anyways fate ubw, hf movies and zero. They're all good
Lol p1
Same millhi
And anilist for actual list
I use mal for infos
it's on the real robot light side
it's not that mecha focused
i liked the whole humanity lives on a ship concept
but it was a pretty good show
it's been years
but i don-t remember what
i remember something unusual in gargantia
uh
i still shiver hearing this ending || https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTYv6OyULoU ||
just how much good was recreators
god
i miss her songs
Today is Mami Kawada's birthday
*laughs in death saurer*
Right zoids?
Why getting just a kaiju when we can have a mecha kaiju
I was thinking on something dumb
<#377148557796442134>
And come here
Plz explain
But yeah <@472513526393602059> i kinda lost you
Js06 is an insane person
GN vol 1 is already half translated
Ooooh
She's important at the same level as mikoto *if not a bit more*
Come on you people read the lns of you want to know misaki better
It's a specifically made iirc
i said
EMIYA
i mean EMIYA
ran in the 2004 novel
ye ubw
Nine lives?
what
damn it
the suffering is behind the corner
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
no sparks liner high for me
but sad story
i overstepped there
well nine lives will be hype as fuck
|| THIRD MAGIC VS SECOND MAGIC ||
|| GIFF SAKURA VS RIN ||
fuck 9 lives
*LIFE APPROACHES THE IMPERIAL VILLA*
fuck yes.
But goddamn it
well nothing bad happened
uh
and put ||
yeah solo you should put it under spoilers
MY
OH
where where
oooh
But not recognized
Awww accel world so much better than sao
And || signal fire at the water's edge managed to melt me down to zero ||
But nothing stops you to take a short break without cliffhangering the life out of you
They are closely connected arcs
I know that kaguya
|| "Archangel of Savage light" and "The beginning and the end" ||
since they seem connected in the same arc
the bad part is that might have to buy vol 15 right after that
hm?
*curiosity*
it should arrive like thursday
Accel world volume 14

OH AYA
well i watch it just to reconnect
hm
*sasuga ainz sama?*
are yoyu
do not underestimate his powers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Aya is a VN lord
okay
or the reverse?
Old Rezero > new_
So
and give birth to a wicked thing
basically it's how you mix all routes together
at outlining the thing
is a disaster but it does a decent job
Deen/Stay night
Again you can do whatever you want
F/Zero is 2008.
Fate/UBW/HF is 2004
but the source release order tells the correct order in this case
cuz chronological order
I know that the tendency is watching Zero first
it's a story that happened 10 years before UBW/HF/Fate
^
But the routes do not spoil zero
^
Lol
No no
so they are both spoiled
and they have both the same start
if one happens the other doesn't
HF and UBW are alternate route
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
But feel free to do whatever you want
Zero spoils UBW
but i suggest to watch UBW first
i wont judge
look
you will get da bon of ma sord
you need a protection charm for that
Oh Deen/Stay night
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
From where are you starting man?
ooooh
which is always good
+ broken engrish
Yeah i agree with that
||spoiling UBW LIKE THAT ||
EMIYA vs berserker is the real problem
Shirou || killing berserker is okay, it is fully canon ||
the actual scenes were cool and they got the ending right
the soundtracks were dope
Even if deen/stay night is a disaster
pick one of the names
Fate/Deen or if you prefer Deen/Stay Night or Fate/2006
|| in actual wings  and then he slashes down basaakaaa ||
EMIYA turns the twin swords
yes
in the end nasu approved wings <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
but i got angry discovering the actual disaster
i swear, it's great exactly because it's in broken engrish
fucking golden
HAHAHAH
<@!279341087494242304> i am da bon of ma soood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff2tM4-nZA0
and this plays
that moment when you forget youtube autoplay button
compared to the past for sure
Well dubs improved
the fake black swordsman!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Command Tattoo
Lol
it beats UBW in every aspect imho
HF is just great
in order
UBW - HF and Zero
do like this
then my final suggestion is just
and a side timeline
last note fate/apocrypha is a bad adaptation
either way have fun
but yeah
you will get a great laugh (2nd option case)
or just watch it as the last.
to either avoid 2006 completely
I just suggest
Yes
Wow, just wow
I just finished dr stone anime
but of course ufotable is just mind blown
it has pretty cgs
tbf? the vn is dynamic
made to show off the sparks
that battle chase is half original
you know
damn it, weird shit happens there
heaven's feel is just the top
in my opinion
oh yeah
that's why i asked
i can spoil you that in <#377148557796442134> if you want
well touma || dies once in ep 5 s1 ||
Then after that it's a thing from later in the novels
trashy pic but fun
|| https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/88129713_3511961102209549_3689480897012170752_n.png?_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=_rTcz_6Okg0AX9g7ke7&_nc_ht=scontent-mxp1-1.xx&oh=77b477b7c1b14725d99d73af7a9e5551&oe=5EF288C2 || <:Ver:336656981144109066>
GAL UNDO
Or just delete it
But now it's better to be watched at the last
Back when ubw did not exist
It was okay
Yeah
Eyee em da bon of mai sord
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
F/deen spoils the ubw
I agree with one but
Solo solo
Rezero directors is not recognized as a series
oh and
LITERALLY PROTECS
**COVAH MOVE**
<@!238855496797257729>
tho she makes me laugh and hard facepalm at the same time
y
compared to maple weirdness
and she's pretty generic
even sally is there
hell

this is more dangerous.

tho i avoid using that with some shows
it can be very very weird at first
oh yeah that SNK upload on their homepage at 60 fps is a good example
https://www.svp-team.com/
but the program is svp
i can't explain the details
(i mostly do torrent cuz i got a pretty little program that lets me pump up the framerate of a video to 60 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )
and yeah i torrent nowadays
i'm used by ignoring those but i can relate
right i forgot gogoanime
i was right then
it may have lessened
this is an old info tho
yeah still sad
(funfact i looked up at .moe domain cost, it's expensive as hell, like 17€/m iirc?)
it was unusual but it happened
lol
here and there screwed up episode upload
a finger vs masterani.me?
can i raise
masteranime closed down
uhm
in b4 they got a newtype
hah
like 00 ep 1
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
we already talked about this, it's only a demostration, someone else is going to pilot a zaku
at the olympiads
to bring the old rx78
cool fact is that they're going
with gp02
shooting nukes
i heard you like
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
(1:1 GP03 when?)
1:1 RX0
EH
hmm
DAGUZAAAAA <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
but i enjoyed Unicorn A lot
unpopular opinion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZJWylGJ8AU
one of these is played by Chemistry!
those made me melt
one for each OVA
ED songs
It did have
i-m not mentioning Unicorn songs on purpose
8th ms
oh well yeah
then you watch such stuff <:Ver:336656981144109066>
off in the brain
sometimes you need to switch the "edgelord & high IQ anime"
it's a simple and straightfoward story
it's on the acceptable range
but if you dismiss the ecchi component
well hotd is kinda overrated
Rip

Kurousagi true race is "Moon Rabbit"
but it's a given name
yes
*spear of indra where*
Kurousagi has a pretty bg too
but the whole MC trio is amazing
so i kinda understand the view
it in 10 eps (2 volumes)
well you can't really get
Izayoi has a personality at least
^
i've read the whole novel and it's <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
it gets mind blowing
eeeh

D:
No i'm scared now
to watch
Millhi throw at me some mid 2000 glory
actually!
silly me not reading
which is considered the best one in railgun
it's because of the current arc

Log horizon on the other hand is an isekai
it's under cyberpunk genre
Cyberspace should not be classified as isekai
not really
eh
ah ok
i was just saying, that's the reason
no serious i'm not trying to start an argument dw
SAO is not a proper isekai
it's one of my favourite so far.
i've read the whole novel
my main example will be always Mondaiji tachi vs NGNL
as something very similar made afterwards
pieces of work not becoming relevant
Look there are cases like this one around
i have to relate anyways, oso would have been more interesting
i will give it a shot again, the premise is curious
poor school friend
Lol taku
This is why i could not place where i saw her
Lol
goddamn.-
...
the Craft girl
but now that you remind me of OSO
nothing too extravagant but indeed serious
OSO takes a bit more serious tone
the genre
but bofuri is like something to ridiculize
but it had potential
goddamn it i dunno why it sets me off
I tried reading that Thrice

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPUwk7tRCM8
nice
ooooh
lol true enough
and the synopsis doesn't really help defining toaru
Toaru is a mix of genres and it's an hell of a ride, even if the entry points are rather weak
To love ru is an harem filled with ecchi and comedy
That's a question  only you can answer
lec lol
that's not true
Enjoy the *politics*
You're in for some good trip
Gl
Oooh
so that you can unveil her background and stories by watching railgun
You're supposed to know mikoto from index and to get curious about her
but it's not the best one imho
that Railgun can be used ad entry point
i'm not doubting
that's all i've got to say
there's a reason if they're side stories.
my suggestion will be always to start with index, no detours and then go to railgun and accel
except not before index 1
Accel can be watched whenever
it is just not supposed to be watched like that
the watching order doesn't really matter but i do not really like to apply chronological order to toaruverse
well you kinda called me
that certain arc gets enhanced by doing so, not spoiled.
and railgun after it.
to watch index first
I strongly suggest
Ehm
ikr
World trigger, Log horizon, railgun, mahouka and so on
This year is great for second seasons
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and fortresses were built like that to absorb the enemy cannon barrage better
star like city
lmao that
it's an ova
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yImJ50uby-8
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
the last one blasts all the others
my fav parts tho are OT16, OT19-22, NT8-10 and **NT19-22R**
but i will keep reccomending it
that's the thing i've been saying all along
oh well
and <@!203444794737950720> of course railgun anime is better than index one, they managed to half ass the cool part of it
peace out <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
yours in railgun
my fav part of toaruverse is in nt
in the end just have fun, each their own
is a too much weak entry point for that sub
the anime
miki san is not that bad
no come on
and steins;gate is just top tier
well toaru has weak entry points
rip
Hype for bookworm
rad...
lol
shirabe
it's
> idiots
^
.
Lol solo
Ys is cool
Look i think it as like this, i don't think isekais themselves are bad (actually i binge them time to time) but it's more you gotta find good one in the middle of the trash
So it's actually decent?

Cross ange was great

Misaki is a particular character
Where lol
Ye
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Is misaka best
Misaka worst
Please i beg you to not judge index from that crap
They destroyed the 2 best ot arcs
Goddamn it
That was a suicide
So dw, i understand your point
It's a correct view from anime only, cuz index was badly adapted
Dog's life
Only the best built by the best

Wt shirabe
<@472513526393602059> wot volume did you arrive? Curiosity

The science side is arbitrary but of course
Is the opposite
Actually
Ffs
While minori is 14.
And i discovered that serara is 17.
Tbh i love the novel art
Deen <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Different studio
Nah
Aya is cringing rn
Got hit by the damage
Rayneshia
Even my fav
Lol
Ehh
Marielle is the best example
By for example messing with their hairstyles
Thr problem is that a few characters got worsened
But yeah
It's a trademark
The s3 to have it
It's awesome, i expect
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<@238855496797257729>
Graphically
Of s2 character designs?
What do you think
Kk
Lmao
Database database! Just living in the detabeis!
<@237964037898502144> so are you enjoying the ride? <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
~~the pause is part of aleister plan, every kid knows that~~
Better wait than half assed
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
1 more week of waiting is part of the ride
Jc staff tumbled down the hill with that
But yeah last note, accel and railgun were adapted better cuz more linear, index is more convulted and after ot13 follows like 3 groups of protags at the same time
With hanging from the cliff more
You can enjoy it better
Pls
A mashed potato
This is what happens when you try to smash 3 volumes in 6 episode
That happens in the novels
The anime cut out.
The op teased right
The missiles
That bit is in the op
Ye
Mikoto has nothing to do with the dark side after radio noise
Which is ok
But yeah the events just do not regard her
Cut out rip
Oh the ww3
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
vs gundam ibo
now now aya i understand you bear a grudge
same that did Raise your flag and several other amazing tracks
ye
KOE NO KAGIRI
*raise your flag flashbacks*
man with a mission is life
AND THIS^
a big part of them is true
most is a big word
god .
is important!
being different
PLS
it's a trademark
oh come on aya
Database for S3 as well

pls
two seasons aya
24+24
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
LH is 48...
NGNL is 10 ep long
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
(then there's me, who watched it 6 times)
it's worth
you can give it a rewatch
(i've had her in my profilepic for 2 years...)
and i like her pairing with || crusty ||
well her part in s1 is just wow, realize she's just a lazy princess who does nothing all day
i just liked her a lot
well it-s personal preference here
LH 1 Spoilers || https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CP_QOZSUYAILtXB.jpg:large ||
❤️
true
oh lol
it's Lenessia
but if converted to western languages
you write rayneshia with katakana
It's not a mistake
Nah
Best princess
Just give my rayneshia baaaackkk
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Only the armors imho
She's 3 years younger than akatsuki
Ehhhh
Personally I don't like the idea of dakis, but i would fill my house with figures and gunplas
But mal infos are just more detailed
Has a list import function and several more cool stuff
Anilist is more efficient and clean than mal
Anyways do not kill yourself over animation eras too much, for example origins and unicorn are fresh. 0083 and 08th are 90s. Z and zz are end of 80s
It's not a weird thing to ask
Rofl
Oh well that i can understand
I'm suggesting it only because you would have the events fresh
(before 0079 events)
And origins explains 0079 zeonic background
You know the thing is that uc is filled midway
As next ones
If you plan to continue, i'd suggest origins, 0083 and 08th ms team
Uc can only be watched from the start imho
You did the right thing
Since you mentioned
Did you watch other uc gundams?
Z ones are wonky
In 0079 case
But the movies are alright
I watched the original TV series like you are doing
Nah it's the same
👍
Good person
Are you watching the 3 movies
Out of curiousity
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I love that quote
Hahaha
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And do not let char to "come to laugh at you"
With weird shenanigans and space nazis
Well have fun
|| https://www.deviantart.com/rpglord/art/Bright-Slap-174824394 ||
Is a meme
Bright slap
Dat movie
0080
Oh i was forgetting
Ye ye
Is 0079 being 40 years old.
The only really problematic
early designs
but the thing needs more work.
we already have mechs
and enter uc
we can scratch away AD calendar
then we need space colonies and only then
with solar panels
that's the first step
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
to create space colonies?
when are we going
So people
good catch
this one
hah
ash like snow is a trademark
a geopolitical blast
it was my first gundam ever
i will rewatch 00 someday
damn
but that ost struck out so much to me
The openings were good
*ore wa gundam*
it's one of my fav Gundam osts of all time
*P E R F E C T I O N*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7iHTqMzRuc
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
00 MUSIC?
SOMEBODY SAY
DID
Gundam 00 was awesome
you even have the option of starting with 3 -2 hours long movies instead of the whole 0079
go for it
Yeah
Men of destiny
Tho my fav is 0083 op2
Oh dear 08th ms op and za winner from 0083
and i think oil is not efficient.
are dangerous.
nuclear reactors like Zakus
The thing about mechs irl is the power supply
people
by several different
pinged repeatedly
when LH 3 got announced.
about it
that people even spreakpinged me
i'm so known to like LH
funfact
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
nah don't bother
lmao
if you disliked it
continuining
well then there was no point
ah ok
out of curiosity
ep number i mean
where did you stop?
anyways ikxi
exceptions do exist little padawan
1) Hate it
2) Love it
only two ways
when speaking of TTGL there's no middle ground
i told you
See?
no middle way of rating TTGL
you either hate it or love it
enjoy the ride
it's bliss.

heaven's lost property

i didn't remember saving sora freaking no otoshimono
but it's not a meter of judgement

i felt the same
yeah
oh lol twintail
LOL
HI EUPHO
OH
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

can be always be recovered
Logical Failures

that's a nice

the author is insane.
at the size of the novels.

136 LN VOLUMES OF HIGH FANTASY
GUIN SAGA WHERE
ye nothing special
https://anilist.co/anime/5940/Seiken-no-Blacksmith
it was a funny little show
back in the 2012?
I watched that
right?
Lol Seiken no Blacksmith
and i'm waiting for Last Embryo to continue tl
it's one of the best LNs i've ever read
but yeah i will always suggest people to read mondaiji
ye
age wise and characters wise
and the protags grow
but years later, times passes
it works, since you get to go through Fate and then revisit the un-damaged UBW
and then read the VN
first watched UBW
Illi, most of the people
i would do the same
a decent idea illi
that's actually
Well
^
it just works.
don't mind about it carols
ye it's a slight thing
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's not the same timeline
butts in and starts saying
where is that moment where your usual fate hardcore fan
madoka's author wrote Zero
Urobutcher.
yes
with motorcycle SFX included!
where is that at solo?
of mai soood
da bon
eiii emmm
ye
and <@!279341087494242304> i can't wait when || illya will sacrifice herself and it will look random because all her scenes got pruned out ||
Heaven's feel movies you go
after UBW anime
Ye VN, or UBW anime
IT SPOILS
THAT TELL WITH ZERO
FREAKING PEOPLE
YE
is the way
UBW anime
well if you don't like reading
or one VN!
it's like 1-2 shows and 3 movies
If you go for the main stuff
and spinoffs
in timelines
Fate is just divided
^
?
thick
not getting into a French Tl.
waiting for the eng tl of that
MORE TRUE ANCESTORSSSssss
GIVE ME
*laughs in true ancestor*
Tsukihime = Gaia Goes Nuts
Fate = Alaya Goes Nuts
not universe.
they're the same multiverse
of the nasuverse.
yeah while that's the cool part
let lb end
soon
true.
oh god.
where
gudaguda final anime adaptation
thus said solo
i agree
there are originals too in fgo eh
FGO Overbloats Fate lore
^
.
from a close friend
i heard it firezero.
and you just die inside
then your noobish normie arrives telling FGO has the best fate experience
it's divided in many sub groups
is a wonky case
ye but Fate fandom
at
where's beast lair
^
ye
you're overcomplicating.
reading
just ubw carol if you don't like
also called Deen/Stay Night or Fate/Deen or Fate/2006
^
HAH
anyways yeah durarara follows a story about different people who live in a tokyo district
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and hey INDEX REFERENCES IN DRRR
^
kicking in
well that was battle tendency
can do
no
before actually start to understand something
You need to bear 9 episodes
Durarara is very unique
DETABEIS
i will end up in my 7th rewatch
stop stop mentioning log horizon
GOD
even if the anime was a  very good adaptation of first 2 vol
Yes do that
without him
FGO will continue on its own
fz
no we have "confirmation" of that
^
soon
he will be free from FGO
for starters
well
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
half a page to explain them
taking simple concepts and giving them like
in knk
it was just extreme
No solo
in his early works
Nasu was extremely chuuni
god.
KNK LN
I've actually read
^
*bending bridges in progress*
is the first novel.
Kara no kyoukai
neither is mahou tsukai
Tsukihime is not nasu first novel
no
what?
for a reason solo.
i've put " "
S;G is part of the "must"
but dunno
tried watching later series
i just watched s1
well gotta be honest
Lmao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX836fYQL4E aaaaaah memories
who watched this when i was a kid https://anilist.co/anime/603/Futari-wa-Precure/
and then rewatched it 4-5 times
then there's me
^
MCs
it has several
yes carol
it destroyed the show.
has  a 6 on my list
that death note
all i know is
^
but i didn't continue it
hayate it's freaking great
what fz?
?
Hayate no gotoku...
i never finished
THis reminds me
what am i watching...
Lol
dw
i was asking to mil
not you carols
this pleb
please enlight me
i'm confused
taste is subjective
but it's very good
nah it isn't one of the best
if you implement it with S:G 0
The anime is good by itself
uhm
Sao has highs and lows
but accel world is just better.
Look sao even gets good after a certain arc
x_x
I'm still mad at SAO overshadowing accel world
Lol
why accel world
if he really did that.
The author is a god
LOL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVwTk7wk7ew *Rakuen project intensifies*
i know the really good stuff is in Darkness
but s1  wallfaces you
I tried watching to love ru
dear lord indeed
but it was so good
God
"Who do you think i am? Frieza?"
with charlotte anime
Miso the manga wasn't ended yet
❤️
Charlooootte
no lol
on this.,
You need to help me more
Lol
Cat shit?
Trinity Seven is good.
~~ then you find that guy liking mars of destruction ~~
just like what you like
^
the rest is decent/good
that's really bad.
there's just ONE arc
if we really want to point fingers
with no apparent logical connection
in a span of 2 volumes
like going to narrate 2 different things
ye
but he didn't
just because it seems like the author lost his mind
i'm telling you
it's 6-7-8 iirc
they must be read, they reconnect and make sense only in the later volumes
3 volumes are prequels /side stories
just one note
Nice
k
else i still have my zip on the dropbox
did you find those?
<@!237964037898502144>

since kirito is asuna's
and everyone in kirito's group gave up on him
and liking someone
between falling in love
Look there's a difference
even face to face
in her screentime
she criticizes him a lot
she really does
Talks crap of him
Well she's the one that even while liking kirito
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
!
Sinonon
But sure
Well kayaba shenanigans got explained in alicization
And being the damsel in distress doesn't fit her
That's not her fault lmao
In ggo she's a side character
Kirito would have failed
If asuna didn't try
Alo wouldn't have been cleared out
Aya if i can break a spear in her defence
I got a figure of her
Shinonon is my fav
Oh well
Asuna gets too much hate out of nothing really
Tbh? All sao girls are okay
But i think it's still not enough
No i Agree with that
And well, alicization is just wow
Infact the show recovers starting from mother's rosario
And <@262326868366065664> i agree with you on sao. Alo is the true disaster even if kirito powercreep shenanigans ruin phantom bullet too
100%
I agree with hectan
I forgot
Oh god
WHEN MIYUKI IS THERE
NO ONE MATTERS
by cutting monologues
90% of his characterization got robbed
he got the "EMiya shirou ubw" effect
in s1 adapt
got ruined
that shiba tatsuya
it seems
airs
the lns after s2
i will read
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> shiba miyuki
MORE ONII-SAMA
GIFF MAHOUKA
for mahouka s2
i can't wait
but better late than never
yes
then his mind lit up and started using his second hand
managed early accel world but lost himself on sao
So we can pretty much assume he started with 2 guns and one hand
Sao came earlier by 4 months
same year
ok no
iirc
Accel world came earlier
He can write when he wants.
at the start
he was just a lost sheep
and it kinda matches from when SAO gets decent
where he must go with his writings
realizing after several volumes
Reki in the afterwords
there the characterization is just done better, but you can see
Accel World
Look i'm reading
and GGO too.
in ALO/SAO
but he's cheatlike
do not misunderstand me
well she's strong too
she's inferior
were evident during mother rosario
Asuna and kirito skills
since it breaks down aincrad and re-analyzes it
in the future
and i think i will read sao progressive sometime
literally
the show gets better.
kirito powercreep
everytime you remove
10/10
infact in Mother's rosario and in alicization she's freaking awesome
and it's not her fault.
i think that asuna gets blocked by the plot
but yeah in the end
lmao
i know guys lol
ye i agree iwth firezero
i forgot about her
ye and liz
maybe suguha and silica yes
Hm
rip
imho

oh and those
she's even tall enough

OH
even one of the volumes has it in the title
kurousagi tendency to spam "YES!"
right?

you're reading

the novel is just loaded with better content
<@!237964037898502144> yeah even if the anime adaptation was decent
that's just better in the novel
<@!237964037898502144> go || water deity  ||
he really isn't.
because Izayoi seems a powercreep

Here and there
<@238855496797257729> arte is so freaking historically accurate
and i prefer VNs/LNs than mangas
of course there are exceptions
i also feel a bit more curious towards a source if already watched the adaptation of something
it's a subjective thing
better than fripside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVigpPCbzLM to not forget
since Touma is not THE protagonist
Well no lankpants
LOL
carlos? lol
wt
i mean ffs.
Index 3 was supposed to end with a very precise scene but they went full idiotic and adapted the prologue of New testament
but both OT and NT are conclusive, no open ending
Old testament (1-22) has its ending, new testament (23-45) has it's own, Genesis testament is a whole new plot who takes stuff starting from where the things ended
now in 3
there's a reason why the LN is divided in 2
solo he closed the plot two times already
in july.
after 46 volumes we are at christmas and the plot starts
it's not bad writing, it's how index is made
he's an empty shell.
without MEMORIES?
in 1 month
How a character is supposed to develop
of 1 month.
happen ina span
index 1 and 2
no
for a person who just lost ALL || his memories ||
once you check that you notice that it was impossible to develop any sort of personality
in those 46 episodes?
how many days do pass
do you realize
Guys
since that's the point where he starts chardev
if they didn't bork index 3, touma would be rated much higher
i guarantee it to you
that's false as the moon is the sun
in index 3
his value was supposed to show off
Touma on the other hand, he's SUPPOSED to be a regular high school boy, but he's a very well made character, the Early index doesn't really give him justice
but has her very cool peaks
i mean she's there to annoy touma most of the times
Index is... complicated
Touma is okay
and || index is just a massive master plan that blows your mind as the volumes go on || <:Ver:704169051391524875>
but at this point i have some expectations for index new testament anime since they spoiled us NT 01.
and would require at least 12 eps alone
expecially when the last three volumes are massive
but everything went to shit when they tried to cram 10 volumes in a 26 episode anime with index 3
but for the rest, railgun really pales out in comparison to index.
Being a side story and being it much more linear it was easier to adapt, hence they didn't fail the anime
it's a very sad thing
that-s what i said
Yes
was adapted badly.
and the cool part of the first novels
the problem lies that the entry point is a bit weak
Index is a great series
noh.
since railgun *is* 85% canon
look the point is, railgun will at one point hit a wall, forced by main plotline. In that point, either it ends with an open ending, either it continues and the watcher/reader will understand less, either it goes full filler and starts spouting random stuff like the second half of railgun S (which was very bad imho)
to index 3
infact *i* gave a 7
i was really hyped when index 3 went airing, and i got very disappointed in the borked parts
i mean i'm a good example as "I liked index 1-2, i wanted more and waited years, then i started reading the novels in 2014 and i'm still enjoying that"
Opinions are subjective
but what if someone can get curious?
when you can watch the main thing and then switch to railgun?
i still reccomend that, but why watching only that?
and everything.
Railgun is cool
flawed it is, it's decent and enjoyable
i still advise against doing that, it's not at fate/deen level of bad adaptation
x_x
but it can't really be helped
since index is a weak entry point.
i'm always saying their doubts are legit
I'm not blaming them
I'm not trying to defend the thing just because i'm a fan, but the thing is just built in a particular way, for example, part of the reason lies in the name itself even, the thing is called "Toaru" for a reason, it translates into "A Certain", it should stand for " a series of stories surrounding a certain magical index", as long as we have been told it's a choice made by the editor and agreed by the author back in 2003.
but yeah last note on index
in the path
i'm still mad at thinking how they just zeored her relevance
Rip illya
well at least HF gives shirou a bit more justice
shirou is a nice case
yeah
in index case, you bork something and the damage will be brought on since it's a build up
yeah
Anyways
eh i told you
|| https://puu.sh/FSwEK/a2474f0533.png ||
a sec
fail link
ugh
but their stories do meet at focal points
they do not work together, they have their crap to deal with
even if Hamazura is introduced only in index 3
The 3 protags lead the story in unison
and the current touma is a very different character than the one that you know
peaking in new testament
that's why in index 3 he starts becoming a new person
(not a spoiler, ep 5)
Physically
he lost his brain cells.
since it's not amnesia
He can't.
in index 2.
in 4 arcs
Accel acts as the protags
how is he going to remember crap if his brain cells are fried?
is just a person without memories.
because a person without memories
we have bits of background of touma
i mean
Touma can't get background
> touma just starts earlier.
in s1
he was introduced
touma just starts earlier.
Accelerator is the second protag
have the SAME focus.
touma and accelerator
In those 46 episodes
he isn't.
Index has 3 different protags
❤️

actually
i need to continue the manga
are they connected?
it's original
the new stuff it shows
YE
Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova - DC
This is one of the movies announced in the August issue of Shonengahosha's Young King Ours magazine. This movie will be a compilation of last year's television anime series with new story sequences.
.
that's it
i don't remember
the second one is the decent iirc
with an uber half assed ending
it's a crappy recap
IS to be avoided
one of the movies
<@!237964037898502144>
sorry for pressing on the subject
that's all i have to say
so flawed main anime first, decent anime side story later, otherwise you get an altered opinion
and can have different opinions
exactly because not everyone is the same
i always say to people, "Start with index, but be aware that's a bit flawed, then go to railgun/accel"
but yeah index anime is not that bad to be avoided
for real?
i missed another toaru discussion?
Wait
i enjoyed DB Super but it's really nothing special
+ cosplay
piano skills
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEscOsNjNhk 
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
i'm still curious how kamachi will rule things out once railgun catches up to || stalker mikoto ||
index novels is a bomb and it's main, railgun is side story, much more linear and simple but still amazing and enjoyable
since kamachi is a madman.
it's the whole toaruverse that's an outstanding thing
but the anime adaptation was a 6.5 at best.
like i went to read Death march to a parallel raphsody LN
then i might be the weird case
because i found the adaptation unappealing
PRECISELY
where i went to read the source
Look i might be a weird case then isky, what can i say, there are some cases i experienced personally
they spoiled everyone with shooting NT prologue in our face in index 3 end scene
they ARE going to adapt NT at some point.
Anyways i do suggest to watch index first for a well known reason, not everyone likes to read LNs, expecially in toaru case, index is 47 volumes and COUNTING
and it's amazing on itself
from the point of view of a secondary character.
Railgun talks of several side stories And events
Index 1-2 are decently adapted but there's slight content loss, Index 3 is a pure damaged product.
i will say like this
Look
that's a thing that blows out later on
i agree with hanabi
the anime is 2010.
toaru is 2003.
Isky there's a point regarding the "Anime advertises"
Isky
^ this but i talked about this
first
Railgun is good but i suggest watching index
the author was always 10 volumes ahead
toaru was never meant to be a small thing
slowly as the series goes on
he makes a new personality for himself
ep 5.
his brain got fried in s1.
we are talking of destroyed brain cells.
Isky we are not talking of amnesia
with no memories?
from an empty shell
sure touma is a weak character, since what personality do you pretend
look, if you look at the thing from anime onlyu
well yeah
fuck
heh
i need to read that
Astral buddy
queen!
as the index novels progressed
tfw you end up preferring misaki shokuhou much more than mikoto
but yeah
sadly he was going to be badass in index 3 but jc staff borked out
touma is more solid in railgun than in the early index adaptations
i have to agree on these statements
but brb dinner
isky
i'm 100% sure you got my statement wrong
because of that
and production
i'm talking that it was easier on the studio
wtf
you don't call something in favor "an excuse" isky
and not in her spinoff.
in the MAIN NOVELS
hell mikoto gets one hell of a character development
index is not linear, you discover things volumes later, much more intricate
so it just works.
railgun is just more linear
^
.
they messed up
but this discussion makes me super-angry with JC staff, plz guys
Touma has no development in index s1 anime, monologues got lost
i'm always like || omg look people chill out as touma busts his ass ||
anyways <@!195044406343106560> regarding the festival arc
millhi.
pls.
It's shirabe VA in a band

that explains the amazing graphics.
thanks, i didn't know that
oh okay
joint project?
only the first half follows the novels.
fun part? HO is half original.
thus delaying index 3 for years
Then they used all the funds on the latter
something like that
JC staff was supposed to air Index 3 at the same time as Heavy object
As long as i know
Miki Kazuma apologized for it
for index 3
in stead of splitting them in 2
where they used all the funds for heavy object
look iirc an incident happened at jc staff
has amazing animations

- voice acting
- all the content you want
*visual novels*
but yeah do not ignore the hybrid
lmao
in an adaptation
Content loss is when details, monologues and such are lost
Some shows are just bad to be adapted
You get soundtracks and you get content loss as well
Well Movies and Shows have a deal to be struck with
i don't consider shirou an harem mc

but that means...
so tsukihime remake is a possible candidate
one of the three is something regarding an already existing thing
on 3 different projects
Type moon BB is going to work
Arcueid has a very strong characterization
that's why that doesn't exist
<@!279341087494242304> your jam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s71TXGp6mfQ
THIS.
what do we get?
Yeah and mean while
Tsukihime is so cool man
that part is reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally messed up
Oh god true
he still experiences || strong migraines ||
and directly connected to the root
Ryougi Shiki was trained
look as they're described, MEoDP really can mess your head up
But for different reasons
Both Shiki and Shirou do suffer
like that scene with || mystic eyes of enchantment ||
oh yeah solo
(and i really felt bad there=
i only went through Arc normal ending
all the routes
I still have to read
THIS CHAIR
^
A VERY WEIRDO
And Shiki Tohno is just a weirdo
^
^
and tsukihime has *mollusks*
they can be a blast.
i still suggest reading those
so yeah, if you can stand H-scenes in general
|| *can't stop my butt* ||
nasu just can't 😂
|| Threesome in || Fate, is freaking awesome, UBW Scene is very cute, shirou kinda ruins it? HF ones, putting aside that infamous one, are outstanding exactly because they're so chuuni
it happens only in shirou's mind.
that's not even a legit one.
No
something in defense of those?
can i say
~~ and no threesomes do not count as harem ~~
has independent route
is because each heroine
The reason cuz shirou doesn't own an harem
oh anyways yeah
is always the key
i mean context
Zero no tsukaima
but ZnT just overdoes it
on moderation is okay
she's an ass

toradora is included
well i said minitsunderes
she's just obnoxious
is Louise
THe only minitsundere i can't stand
Rie ftw

like
like in the mid 2000 you got great stuff
There is a lot of very good stuff there
mid 2000s feels are so unique
i'm liking it a lot
until the end of birdy s2
oh and 3 eps left
ye solo
like i chugged Kannagi
depends on the mood
but i did it in some cases
chugging up entire series is an uncommon thing from me
i slowly sip stuff that catches my interest
a lot
no let's say i like the whole concept
wholesome isekai
s2
anyways seeing you here reminds me i gotta catch up honzuki no gekokujou
😂
i can say that will need some minor degree of censorship
i read the novels and i've read the volume after the anime
i'm sad for that
NGNL?
church =/= atlas academy
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

<@!202444817043685386> || 
For women, Hysteria mode creates a weak and defenseless personality, which often causes men to be charmed and lower their guard.
It should be noted that the physical boost they receive from HSS is weaker compared to that of a male.
Female user can harm other women, but cannot harm men.||
n
and no it doesn't work the same as||  male variant ||
it's not only in kinji's blood
that shows up later on
in the lns
<@!202444817043685386> there's a|| girl who's got that syndrome ||
and i don't remember many details
years have passed
before trying to spoil
i need to reread
ehhh
and || female variant exists too ||
behind that syndrome
There's crapton of plot
it's actually a cool thing put in context
seems just a fanservice idiotic thing
and while Kinji's Hysteria Savant Syndrome
was it 2 volumes iirc?
from a 12 episode adaptation
it's just that you can't get shit
HNA was never bad
of a 22+ volumes LN
a very decent adaptation of a PROLOGUE
The S1 was just okay
and they sell well
the novels infact are famous in jp
if they did an s2 the thing would have just become great
That's the problem
in the whole novel.
and gets mentioned TWICE
which appears ONCE
is made around a character
that's spinoff
zero
and i'm still angry
it's full original
that's crap
coreplot one.
and funfact. there's a reason actually because aria has such shade of haircolour
making it pink
AA Spinoff borked it out.
good job.

S1 had Aria's Haircolour right
Funfact

New Light Novel from the author of Mushoku Tensei, "Orc Eiyuu Monogatari" coming out 7/17/2020
OH DEAR

`` She is called the Queen of Akihabara. It is a meaning of a god-sent child of the Akihabara culture. She is a super-girl who perform a voice actress, words, composition, arrangement, a piano performance, a singer, radio personality, a columnist, anything.
 ``

she's akiha, rumiho from s;g
holy fuck
momoi haruko
who was Sun-chan va?
lemme check
EYUU NO UTA!
in general a work of fiction must stay as such
i agree with solo tbh
it's the character with his personal ost
Lol people getting scared at asanagi art
|| https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=orc_eiyuu_monogatari ||
The art.
can't wait
YEEEAH

I didn't like it even in the VN
imho
Fate route is meh by itself
again?
Index anime borked discussion
hm
oh okay
but it's not a factor that alone should steer the judgement of an anime
i think LGBT is just fine as straight stuff
an anime has story, characters, plotwists, graphics, audio and the feeling that gives to the audience
and it shouldn't be
it's not a deciding factor
look taste is subjective but saying that something is better just because LGBT is in it...
wtf
lol
okay
sad truth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkYYYew8CUI thanks youtube for reminding me this masterpiece of an OST
RIP
HAAHA
while he really isn't
he seems dumb
poor touma
yeah
watch it but be aware that it's heavily borked
Look, if you do not plan to read the LNs ahi
and i've slapped a 6 to that adaptation
they killed the 2 biggest and coolest arcs
Index 3 is a shitfest.
the adaptation loses monologues in the first parts, then it starts breaking down, index 2 is the point where the damage starts, but it's still bearable
as i've said to the others
well
you curious?
and lol ahi
it will feel just weird
yeah
if you want of course
the arc is like half of what it was supposed to be
<@!262326868366065664> when you finish that arc i'm gonna tell you what they removed
Angell fall is borked
Index!
DID
average scores do not say shit
but we dumped mal into hell several times
Yeah carlos you were not here
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
because mal said so
imagine discarding shows
MAL!
yes

if i misunderstood the point i'm sorry
but whatever
hmmm yes and no lily
^
so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but tastes are subjective
while there are lots of factors
the point was "important factor"
lily
that was not what color's friend said
but whatever
it's not the same thing
that's all.
is not a taboo they just think it as "It's a gaijin thing"
regarding LGBT on japan
Carols
FAST LIEK SANIC
don't worry Millarc will do that right off the bat
my eyes.
KILLED ME
THAT EMOTE
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>

HE TRAINS THE PLOT
about yuuji
damn it i didn't have to remind myself
freaking yuuji
i actually gave an 8 to SNS 3
No i'm a liar
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and do not exist
that are horrible
regardless of those 12 episodes of fumina konoe
like i threw a 10 to all Shakugan no Shana
yeah
you start chugging them
Isekais are like a drug
ISEKAI?
SOMEBODY SAY
are top tier
plus the references to the former
but in EZ, the setting is way cooler and the author learnt his mistakes
and i liked FT a lot
and <@!226789636989517824> That one is better than fairy tail
I'M HYPED
YESSS

it's good anyways
hah
js
it happened with fairy tail whole final arc
sometimes the pacing is ruled out better in the adaptations
it's fine, there are cases like that
i agree with that
is pretty good
Yamada kun to nana nin no majo
not idiotic.
this time is actually a bearable and decent character.
but fun fact
in Hiro mashima mangas
is a mascot
Happy
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
DAMN MANGA
FUCK HNK
distant sequelling ftw
no need of gunbuster to enjoy it
and it can be watched alone
is Gunbuster 2: Diebuster
for diebuster

^
is not directly connected to diebuster iirc?
Gunbuster
|| black hole buster ||
Nono is a freaking planet buster
NONO ❤️
DAMN
GOD
legit^
and overdoes it
and it doesn't fit
HnK does it in a wrong way
but
suffering is okay to me
look
Is s1 is enjoyable
Fuck ichika carlos
I think geah characters could have an hard time joining the top 20
Same aya
Too many waifus
Top 20 female characters that would be hard as hell
Sadly
But steph shines right after the anime ends
Yeah kaguya
That lowers her
It's void being inhumane
She's amazing in her scenes
Is actually a very high iq character
Steph
Go to work aya
Bookworm!
she was going to die and nothing else.
sinon part was not rape.
there is only 1 rape part in sao
calm down
okay okay
And gets amazing
The rest is good
In 1 and a half arcs
Sao fails
Coz of volume skip
Rakudai got bs heroine
No pls
<@279341087494242304>
.
Than rakudai
Asterisk is better
Noooooo
But more because of the other chars/plot
But not because of the mc
*asterisk war*!
Is
But my fav
Done godlike
Is battle school harem
Trinity seven
Lol
Those were my drug before isekai waves hAppened
Btw i miss battle school waves
And lol solo
<3
And i wanted more laura
S2 is the worst
the reprinted is ok
Glorious Nippon
you talking about the old version
Gate has been reprinted.
Okay kaguya
10/10 from me.
Gate is really really great.
*reads gate*
she was like 13 when she ascended
ye
it's her acting
961 years old.
was rory mercury
to make the greatest legal loli
Remember the greatest excuse
lmao
but she's the same age as the mc
No saya is just underdeveloped
then it's kirin
the Katana wielding one?
or Kirin Todou?
Saya Sasamiya
you mean
uh
but i prefer lns as usual.
the anime adapt is okay
i'm reading Asterisk
the LN is just good.
Eh that's the reason kaguya
he said it
Heathcliff was cheated.
^
as she enters his shower.
and it just looks weird at episode 3
between her and the mc
of relationship
They skipped 2 volumes
Stella vermillion anime adapted.
there's one reason i rate it a bit lower than asterisk
regarding Rakudai
but yeah kaguya
y
i want to read that.
dang
Progressive
you see it in the afterwords.
and he knew it.
before that point
he was going nowhere
and he's like awakened after a certain year
i'm reading Accel world
at some point
I think Reki's writing changes
kaguya
even sinon, she's maybe the best sao girl
The rest is okay
2) Kirito BREAKS A DOOR WITH KICKBOXING AND BEATS DOWN A GUY after 2 years of immobilization (only a few months pass)

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Battleschool card game
yu gi oh gx
but yeah
divine artifact
weighing like 100 kgs?
i mean remember rory has an halberd
and ease
first as she fight, second time as she removes the garments with skill
twice
and the LN goes over that point
she just can.
She's a goddess.
sorry
oh ok
what
? rory is not obese
FULL GOTHIC LOLITA
fight me.
is better.
LN ROry
as he describes those
of course sometimes his love for guns and military vehicles shows up
nothing too heavy
the LN version is ok
several times.
even the author says it in the afterwords
but Gate is *not* jsdf propaganda
it's a special case kaguya
of japanese soldiers.
we are talking
It's written by a soldier
well yeah
so it could not be helped
in the jsdf.
the author was a soldier.
is 100% legit
JSDF Wanking
But jokes aside
I sometimes forget how cool lina is
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<@238855496797257729> lina inverse!
Omg

NAGISA&HONOKA
lol
dw zaia
oh i'm not criticizing
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
at the same time
when you write 6 light novels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOEVWhETuNk
awww this little thing they made for the 10th anniversary of the author
for that reason
you can even ping us
because we used to have group watches
<@!453836798796234762> this channel is called anime-club
(dub eng sad but still)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoqSKr5TP-I this tho
to get the second part of that thing.
that we waited 8 years
imagine
zaia
but this is why i just gave up and drank the LNs, all of it
well yeah lank, borked adapt
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
just at the last episode
spoils the 3rd protag
oh and cool how index 2
it's slow as fuck
it doesn't cover OT fully
pls
is still at volume 16.
The manga
index 3 requires index 2
lmao well
it's continued in index 3
in half.
Skill Out Uprising arc
Index 2 crops
Zaia
and tsuchimikado the cool kid
accel
got freaking Musujume awaki
GROUP is great
uhm
hoping they don't bork it.
now we wait Index new testament anime
it's an heavy spoiler this last statement
95% of it
but yeah it's all fun until you realize the whole index plot is all || a masterplan made by Aleister crowley, 40 volumes of masterplanning || <:Ver:704169051391524875>
god.
Do you realize how fucking skilled is Heaven's Canceller
cuz they maul him
touma goes in and out
until some point
for check ups.
at the hospital
Accelerator is always
<@!262326868366065664> || 1) Aurelous izzard in s1 is fought twice, first they fight his copy, then they attack the true one
2) Heaven's canceller/"gekota doctor" didn't reattach touma's arm it seems, since it's stated that imagine breaker would just regrow the arm if removed ||
oh 2 things
i think there's no mc that goes to the hospital more than him
poor touma
in OT
in the plot
GROUP is relevant a lot
oh after
Group?
wait
because yes the adaptation is flawed but i would like to get an opinion
giff impression
well <@!262326868366065664>
LOL
Name
do that
oh
are you going to reread? lo
we are talking of OT19
and it's the only arc that's good in the anime
i think kazuman failed a bit
i didn't get DRAGON from the LNs
<@!195044406343106560> yes
.
he's not a new protag
is just just lowkey
World Rejecter
yes
it's obvious they wanted to rush to start NT
don't look at index 3 pretty please
it would be an eventual index 5
standard pacing is 7 volumes = 24 eps
what
anyways <@!278860841485598720> ?
JS06 is just great
about YP
i don't care
(NT14-15-16)
the problem is that the lowest point of NT lays in between
NT goes off with the highest peak he ever wrote
yes
NT18 to NT22R is cooler than NT9-10
i suggest you to continue
othinus!
misaki ❤️
😛
did you see it?
we got the cover
incoming
GT02
oh right hanabi
JC staff failed
the anime helped there
that volume was a bit meh
around DRAGON arc
i had a bit of borking
it was okay in the LNs
borking
it would have been alright
if it was something like log horizon which was announced right after s1 ended
x_x
It's exactly because we waited 8 years that's unforgivable
in reverse
you got
so yes it was an huge flaw
"Imagine we waited 8 years to get the second part of what you mentioned in the anime"
lol
to Index 3
i was referring
and zaia
The original Lina Inverse "The Slayer" was modeled after the main character from the novels/anime/manga Slayers where  Light Strike Array,  Dragon Slave and  Laguna Blade are all spells used by the original Lina Inverse.[1]
but i assure it's dedicated to her
to remake her
i know, of course they had
her design
https://i.imgur.com/unxbakY.jpg
her ultimate is the laguna blade.
her Q is the Dragon Slave
Lina, The Slayer
yes
she got an homage there
infact she ended up being in dota2
she's great
your preferences.
i was appreciating
LINA INVERSE!

after all LH 1 and 2 are 10 volumes
that far? 😂
how do you want to stretch 2 volumes
so of course 12 eps
vol 11-12
that it was going to adapt
we already know
Blackraiden
i don-t know if someone is still TLing that
IS tho...
Monogatari and DxD should be pretty easy to find
*for index i got everything till last volume
if you ever need
i could fetch you some sources
but okay
Well it was to be expected
or what you're curious for
i suggest to pick what you liked as an anime adaptation
LNs are fun!
idk
and lina is a strong female lead
kinda you're not wrong
hm
i usually prefer lns but i wanted to read the manga this time
yes
and poor girl
Asuna's character is better analized too
it's great.
and the infamous scene of || the potion vial || got removed
Kirito is more flawed
oh and hell, asuna is just a better character there
right from the start it's better than vanilla aincrad
finally i can enjoy aincrad properly
Sao progressive manga
I started reading
nothing gonna help goku if he falls into a star
so Superman can't be beaten by goku

i was like, yeah sure, tell saitama to harm accelerator, let's see if he can scratch him without imploding
"LOOK SAITAMA IS THE STRONGEST"
boasted
when people
I remember
Lol
anime
Since it's a planet buster
outside power scales.
Dragonball should be considered
and decided to write more
but he went full enlightement
at volume 7
Reki wanted to stop Accel world
accel world 24 was in 2019
is yet to be released
Yeah 2020 volume
i'm not sure tho
iirc?

even accel world slowed down
to 1-2 volumes per year
but yeah he slowed down

<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
what can i say
everyone has its tastes
well i disagree
.
not a 250
it's a 24 eps
i counted them back in the day
yes it's not a lot
it needed it.
people hated recreators for having 3-4 eps of wind down
but jokes aside
that's the issue, is the mc, the mc?
lol
the middle area is not filler, it's a build up.
one of the best originals i've ever seen
fucking great
is a 10/10
Re:creators
she can rewrite stuff
but people, theorically not much can harm Altair from Re:creators
gotta read it

medaka box
who's her?
😂
of course not
if you end up not liking you're not going to lose anything after all
so i would give it a shot
taimadou novel is superior than the anime adatation

she's short tempered as fuck as well

I DOn'T RECALL
LOL
it's the climax
than Battle royale
WW3 is far better
wtf
<@!203444794737950720>
else it is not really worth
i require full OT manga
it's not enough
eh but
that's where the manga stops basically
[Borked Adaptation Arcs]
the first of the two
and oh boy, you've reached [Battle Royale]
offense armor represents
Takitsubou
They didn't adapt it
Whining about her daughter clones
Tabigake was there
Lol yes then
?
Misaka tabigake
Is ss2
N
But i would have refrained
True
You force nt adaptation like that
.
A disaster
That was
Yes
Hi
What do you think of ww3?
But they went ahead and opened NT
That's why OT has its conclusion
Touma || dies and OT ends, that's referred as the second death of kamijou touma ||
That's NT prologue
<@262326868366065664> now know that the ending scene of index 3 was not supposed to be that one
Ok
you watched trigun?
is Trigun
that never shows up in amq
another boomer great title
Cyberpunk^
which is also good
for weird shenanigans
Ghost in the shell
but yeah you have
instead of a male lead
with a strong female lead
battle shonen
Slayers is a really good
Ghost in the shell
Slayers
carol what do you need
even the Elizalina stuff got borked
Hamazura's stuff was rushy rushed and weirded things out
and it forces chardev for BOTH characters
it's reeeeeeeeeally [Pure Skill]

but so far, it's a guilty pleasure of mine, i like reki writings
SAO got a very good technical department, the story has highs and lows (deep lows)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuJjZ_Jeq3A
Yuki Kajiura is just that good.
people may shit on sao how much they want but the freaking soundtrack are kajiurago at its finest

OH DEAR
ptw is one thing
pls
hah

*FEELS THE POWERS RISING*
SUPER BOOMER
but that anime doesn't really give anything out
Of course.
plz
solo i have a reason
also the ui is clearer
and anilist has the import one
mal has "Export" button
Yes

CHAN
P
i didn't expect there would be a day where i would like kirito
so good
Freaking progressive
like progressive is what aincrad fans wanted
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
"What Phantom bullet fans wanted"
and it's basically
made by a different author
ye
Alternative
https://twitter.com/js_06
and Kawakami
Kamachi works
Translates both
JS06
i don't recall
was SAO:A a manga or an ln?
oh right
for translating ALL his stuff
and rip JS06
at the same time.
writes 6 LNs
how kamachi
people realize
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
or *kawakami*
like kamachi
A MADMAN
NOT EVERYONE CAN BE
WELL
and 1 volume/year for Accel world
releasing 2 volumes /year
became a bit lazier
just because reki
and SAO kinda fell a bit
2019 yearly top sellers
https://puu.sh/FYXLz/9de82f91ef.png
^
and end
Sao will hit 24 volumes
yeah
but still
NT 17 is where the thing starts surpassing the top seller volume but sales do not mean quality
other than that index ruin was NT14-15-16
i bet on it
NT9-10
it always held a top 10-20
Index has never been a #1 btw
Miki Kazuma at dengeki handles both
Seller?
hm?
on pair with Mahouka
SAO has been #1 for YEARS
plus [Progressive]
of course you put all in
for my happy enjoyment
and in alicization he gets borked by the arc
He is not in mother rosario
and Phantom bullet
Fairy Dances
only 2
i mean how much time does pass between Aincrad and Phantom bullet?
breaks the ark
the game kirito
even outside
anyways
😂
"not now, not here"
lmao
in the discussion before
linking that episode
I was avoiding
the things just works krika
powercreeping
but if you remove
JUST NO.
NO
NO
> dodging an entire m16 magazine
otherwise the arc would be neat.
AND ONLY KIRITO
is kirito
but yeah my problem with phantom bullet
not the same thing
HECATE II
and plays 2 games
since she hangouts with Kirito's friends
but iirc she tryhards less after phantom bullet happens
Well Shinon is one of the top ranked players
she gets mentioned
YEs
lol
good shit
encountered shinonon
i would love if llenn

i lost the topic

the movie
ok
uh
LOL
there
he's not an MC
Well i meant
(get cucked kirito)

it-s awesome how NT just leaves OT in the dust
Second best part of NT
100%
but i understand what you mean
NT10 is important at the same level

saying more is spoilers
Kamijou no Touma
i bet he will screw up things more.
for KnT!
btw i'm looking forward
but i do remember that
honestly neither do i, years passed
remember || Her vs Tsuchimikado, she lost an eye lol ||
She gets to be in other 2 arcs

Index 3 alone sold more than index 1-2
(and the editor said that it depended on the overall sales between the 3 parts of "Toaruproject", composed of Index 3, Railgun Third and Accel)
they do not screw NT up
but yeah good or bad, the important thing is that if they continue
while they're the most amazing part on OT novel
were the Index 3 wreckages
BR and WW3
and it's a core lore only in NT
yes that's the freaking ||sephiroth||

coz he's a civilian

on espionage
the show focuses so much
it's true eh
when kamachi attempts a mecha show but you end up with metal gear the anime

it's pretty unique as mecha too

i gotta get into Heavy Object

he still writes other 5 LNs
lmao
ideas are not manuscripts
Miki kazuma said it in an interview
manuscript wise
Kamachi is 10 volumes ahead
10/10
lmao prozd videos
eh
omitting stuff creates plot black holes after
and that's one of the reason causing index adaptations to be borked out
kamachi has always been pretty realistic with his writings, he hardly makes things without explaining stuff before or aftwerwards
the || brainwashing || thing
infact is the low point of the anime
kaguya
that's original
on the second half
used Kamachi kazuma manuscript as reference but wrote original plot
i guess they still
are both covers

Silly fz
i was not telling you to buy the thing.
it's on catsite.
it.
yar harr
no i mean
do not watch the old tv size.
to pick up the blue ray
i suggest you
(i loved margery daw chants)
like Margery Daw appearing too much early
Other minor damages is characters in arcs where they were not supposed to be
like she never existed.
and the plot continues without her
on ep 13 fumina just ||disappears ||
ye
between|| Kazumi, Shana and Yuuji while adding this 4th element (thus forcing an harem) that just feels out of place called Fumina Konoe, Hecate "Alter Ego"||
that's less interesting love triangle shenanigans
They invented a whole arc
yes
in this case
i liked them but it's SNS anime low point
those are skippable if one wishes
Fumina konoe **doesn't exist**
first half
y
and the watcher blows out
SNS 1 was "Okay"
SNS 2 was "Less than okay", JC Staff went out of the window and DECIDED TO MAKE A 12 EPS ORIGINAL
SNS 3 this is the weird boy, it is the most better adapted of the 3, no original stuff, but it feels just wrong because they cut out much stuff in SNS 1-2 that it suddenly expands
Jokes aside
sns 3 ended
9 years exactly.
years have passed
ffs now i have to rewatch shana

another great ktk song was being

fumina konoe
the first 12 eps
just skip
right.

as we speak of kotoko
SOLO POPS OUT
but yeah fz, go finish sns
i know that feel

an awesome toaru MAD/AMV made in honor of Aleister arc
i actually remembered
<@!195044406343106560>
coz of cool ass route
better than S;G
S;G 0 does stuff
in this case
well i summoned myself
in the whole toaruverse
it's still a good read but i deem it the low point
gt02 is coming soon
after all
othinus is good civilization
it's just my favourite LN
when index is mentioned
i just forget the handbrake
eeeh millhi
Kamisato arc is not great
and personal opinion
it's a good read
well
|| screw you mikoto, she was first || <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but yeah she gets big roles in the story
i misunderstood
could be
then okay
oh

but yeah NT 11 is misaki backstory
kamachi is already 10 volumes ahead.
simply because when you get a toaru volume
with this opinion
i don't agreew
mikoto doesn't sleep || she's busy tinkering at AAA || <:Ver:704169051391524875>
story wise
misaki important at the same rate as mikoto
mikoto is a || tsundere || no more
drastically.
yes
hands up
well
and you're missing misaki and actual mikoto character development (it took a while), but i wont spoil
greatly.
NT 20-21-22 outdo NT9-10
but yeah personal opinion
i didn't know
lmao
sorry then that mad was a spoiler
oh
did you catch up with gt01?
reading status
are you on pair?
wait
|| will is best misaka no questions asked ||
❤️ will

oh

talking of NT9 makes me think how much they will screw the scene up

EEEEH BUT
😂
with broken english
*yeah yeah*
maon is just good, motsu is the chad rapper
i prefer ONE and Burst the gravity
but sure
not my fav
with altima you get that weird vibe with Motsu and Satoshi
and both in ALTIMA
both alone
Kurosaki maon is a great singer as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HuI-_CrpYo
wrong link
and memories last^
yeah s2 eds
magic world^
kurosaki maon+
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiZl7vgJyaA
and still made ROAR (s3 op2)
like Magic world
since Kurosaki maon still used to sing index EDs
were used
no new composers
i mean
well it was not
the legend
was Eiko Shimamiya
oh and mami teacher
to the point where as i said she composed index 3 op while in retirement only to let Kurosaki Maon sing it
and she stated she's an huge fan of index
but she stated that she reads the sources before composing
dunno about shana
well
Prophecy is the opening of SNS Specials
like serment and prophecy
others are good as well
oh well
ikr
iirc
yes
hishoku no sora is in Shana s1
2006 album
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(Mami_Kawada_album)
Seed.
n
an funfact (not trying to steer again) but mami composed index 3 first opening out of being a fan
you notice big differences
and kawada mami style changed overtime, if you hear songs from her old Seed album and the ones from the last (Square the circle)
she was just amazing
is Kawada mami
she retired
the singer i'm really sad
but yeah
if you continue it you will notice it
well it's a thing that lasts 3 frames
k
s1
goddamn it.
You know rewatching log horizon i noticed there's an homage to them in the lenessia speech episode
**DATABASE**
is
but my fav from MWAM
Two good catches
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotoko_discography
her star power is just that great
has made so many songs
but kotoko
but a different kind of good
MWAM are cool
^_^
this is me being a fan
is subjective.
is made by his wife.
NGNL manga
he's a mangaka who decided to write an LN
The Author is not an LN writer
S1 Covers Volume 1 and 2
is Volume 6
NGNL Movie
<@!238855496797257729>
this time was old stuff
well
#rapping
but that's motsu in his old group
linked
what video?
Satoshi
is in fripside.
ALTIMA guy at the synth/keyboard/guitar/everything
oh and <@!202444817043685386>
n
but <@!237964037898502144> fight for real sadly is just lowkey if compared with Plasmic Fire (but that's cheating since plasmic fire is a collab with ktk)
sry
i'm not all knowing
idk
that moment when da rapper from initial d ends up in altima
Motsu is unique.
but he was the spotlight in Move
jp and eng kinda here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKURxNMi2xA he mixes
because he's lowkey if in altima
in the other group.
I will link you a song with motsu
MOTSU IS SPECIAL
10/10
CODE GRASS
so have funh
that one could see happening in the future
(at least s1)
And is the most realistic gundam
00 is "Geopolitics times 5"
ah dw
except that Gundam 00 did that better
~~lowkey gundam ~~
Codo geas
Ooooo yeah
in the end i'm stil llooking forward to mikoto pov of index events
imho mikoto post NT15 is a much better character from the old one
mikoto chardevs only because she realizes something,|| the shock from the aaa is just a push||
the AAA thing is not dumb at all she got the || backlash || coz she's an esper, infact to help her with the mental effort || (AAA gave her intense headaches and nosebleeds)  Misaki joins her ||
so yeah
but still he is not scot free
the thing is not properly explained in the Anime
and gets the backlash
oh well he pays that price
but it's all based on Irl Aleister Crowley writings
Look i know it sounds dumb
he doesn't use magic
Accelerator case is him || ascending ||
Tsuchimikado doesn't die only because his esper power is tissue regeneration
the novels HARDPRESSES this point
no they can't.
not
infact || it's misaki helping her in using it to avoid damage ||
you know that.
Espers can't use magic
the mental backlash thing is just || mikoto not knowing that it is both Magic and both science, thus she gets a bit of "brain damage" ||
|| mikoto chardevs there because she realizes she's not gonna obtain ANYTHING || if she keeps up with her mindset
and the personality thing is wrong.
and it's actually legit.
The author is chuuni but the thing is explained in details
10/10
+ dog's life
@railguncurrenttimeline
before AAA
20 volumes
but there are like
told you before
nt15
it's the chardev thingy hanabiu
from being an useless flat character
mikoto
it's what saved
is not dumb at all
AAA
Later on
Especially knowing mikoto actions
So yeah i'm curious on how railgun will follow index
In b4 kamachi is a magician
All based on irl stuff
With one of the most wonderfully weaved magic systems
Index is a massive plot buildup
Eh that will raise questions depending on how its delivered
Ww3 from misaka pov
So curious
Still i cannot wait for when railgun manga hits index chokepoints
Yona
Gets animu
Nagatoro manga
gud
yes fz lol
The op is not from her
is the **ENDING**
Eir Aoi Song
no

Everyone got a change
It's not her alone
Merry from grimgar
If you're referring to what i posted
Yes <@196268149723627520>
https://i.redd.it/u2ap5m7lxkzy.jpg
x_x
in grimgar anime
on how they downgraded character designs
can't get my head around
i fucking
to read hmm
to watch yeah
4) you don't get more merry ❤️
the anime is decent but:
1) borked designs
2) it's only volume 1, so of course it doesn't give major plot points
3) all the characters lose characterization and become more hollow, taking shihoru for example, this completely cripples her character, since she is already a very timid (to the point of cowardice as haru says) girl
to sum it up
but yeah people
|| ranta was close to death in the mines i mean ||
since they're pulling it close every fucking time
i don't feel it is a spoiler
but since it's a despairxdespair
no mil
really
screw the anime
btw i'm at vol 2 and i have to say i'm enjoying it more and more
Oh and merry is best character
she has blue eyes in the ln
WHY THE HELL yume has red eyes in the anime
fucking design got borked.
the 3 girls.

fuck.
.
yume is a beautiful character, the anime turns off her character a lot
POOR YUME
the anime suffers from heavy decharacterization
but jokes aside
before the tower.
basically all of them suffer from amnesia about the past
in 12 eps.
ONLY VOL 1 got adapted
the anime is JUST VOL 1
is a thing that gets developed later on
they don't forget
ikxi
Ehm
No they're very good but yeah it's despair
Wat about it mil
But as i'm reading the novel well ...
I liked grimgar anime
Ln.

rn
stuff
i don't recall 2018
since i'm liking it so much that i would not have minded buying it
i feel bad in this case
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
of 14/15 volumes
btw i got the epubs
Seven Seas
No it's not yen
give me a sec
Yes
oh
how can they fail?
it's just 2 volumes
lol
it got Covid'd
January
LH S3
Btw aya
pls
those hairs look borked
<@!238855496797257729> Marielle
no
and got borked.
waited 8 years for an s3.
And remember i'm an huge index fanboy
did so many times.
no i do know that
please.
in  context.
put it
suffering is good civilization
to hear that
i believe you and i'm not surprised
from the || skeleton encounter ||
but i already feel the pain
lol
gotta finish vol 2
Calm down
that can fill 24 episodes and be fine.
with bible-long volumes
i mean it's not fucking kawakami
certain scenes
the volume is pretty long but they stretched
i mean regarding the point 2
i'm finding it awesome as ln
The fuckign world building in death march is OVERKILL
WORLD BUILDING TIMES 100
2018 HAD DEATH MARCH
OH
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
and *darling in the franxx*
violet evergarden
2018 had
MIL
PLS
which is not bad
s1
2018 had Golden Kamuy
and animes
i mean i enjoy LNs and VNs FAR more than mangas
i became a sucker for LNs
then aroudn 2013
then i wanted more and i started going on the net
it was good
and i don't have regrets
well i started with that
and FMAB
FMA
Full metal panic, TSR, fumoffu
Michiko to hatchin, Trigun, Black Lagoon, Death Note, Diebuster, Diebuster 2
They aired stuff like
was the anime night
before south park
mtv
anime night
in 2006
on mtv
but i started watching those seriously
in 2009
i started watching anime on the internet
P-CHAN
SAO ALTERNATIVE
oh 2018 was
it doesn't even compare
why?
lol
on the last part?
the s3 one?
you mean
lol
the fight in short
they cut out
s3 was cool
^
eh see?
not bad
it was too long
goddamn it.
why.
for 6 episodes.
like stretching the lizardmen thing
but it loses focus in several points
look i loved overlord anime
y
are different.
so both of the 3 medias
than the anime
by itself
and anyways the novel is different
depends
it shares only the main plot points but the story goes in different direction
to the original source
and i'm referring
it's a novel
overlord is not a ln
to act as a commander in ainz's presence
only as a placeholder for nazarick
in the novels she's introduced LATER AND LATER on
she's "anime original "
until a certain point
Albedo doesn't even exist
😂
1% common points
from the anime
you will notice that it's a whole different story
go read Overlord source
Want an unique experience?
it's fun but holy hell, the author knows how to describe and flesh out a world
i've read the WN up to  vol 5 (?)
the Anime is based on the LN which is lower key than the WN
and
that too few episodes to show the world building
death march problem is
and it does in an amazing fashion
it's the only good thing the thing does
i needed this.
GOOD SOLO
OKAY
A BATTLE SCHOOl
OH YEAH
what are we talking about?
the power is outstanding
> solo
> roots
> harem
UH
UH
that it was going to end like that
it was shotcalled from kms
LN Merry is a freaking 9/10
i'd give Anime merry a 6,5/10
anime merry^
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/hai-to-gensou-no-grimgal/images/d/d7/Mary_ch.png/revision/latest?cb=20160326231602
such a downgrade
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
She's very different in the anime
she was merry
you would have not understood
again
Firezero

but anyways it's merry from grimgar
<@!279341087494242304> you know me i rotate pfps
ep 1
4 july
will watch ep 1 later
hell yeah
the way they built the thing was supposed to start airing 1 week after director's cut ended
else you gonna be "wait what" on s2
you can find it on youtube
at the end
that got added
just watch the scene
<@!202444817043685386>
not it's bad
i said it's weird
i'm not dropping it
dunno how to describe my first impression
it feels so weird.
<@!279341087494242304> just watched kannazuki no miko ep 2
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
sometimes they get things right, sometimes it's a disaster
and recent ones are a coin flip
in the past
we had pretty good dubs
😂
but we didn't translate it at least
so i get the word
Guerriero is in italian
ye ye
LOL
AH
the jin part
^
italian dub didn't change the "Super sayan" part
NOW I'M CURIOUS
LMAO
why SuperSayan is SSJ
can't really get
fun how westerners
lmao
i will tell you
If i do drop it
as i die inside
will read them slowly
till 14
got them all
dw millhi
at least.
they finished it
n
m
which is not officially translated.
and the cool content is in CCC
the extra timeline is an oddball
Lol extra
it's just there in the setting
but yeah jokes aside the school is not an important element
😂
to tell the player what did wrong
was a meme
And the tiger dojo
we don't count that.
there's a bad end involving taiga but
^
lol
in the battle royale
yes but she's not involved
Kirei is a priest.
is the second.
taiga fujimura
the other one is a side character
is involved
Only one of the teachers
what?
lol novanity
4 in Heaven's feel?
we are talking of only 3 high schoolers
tbh
well
do not get fooled guys.
Heaven's feel on diet
Kaleid is just
IS a battle royal
Fate stay night
that's kaleid
WHAT LOL
coz of urobutcher shenanigans
Zero  is lower key to me, but people love it
i mean it would be sad comparing fate to that thing
that he knows that lol
well it's important
yeah apart from spoiling the hell out
i was like "Wtf is this mess"
infact when i saw it and i knew 0 about fate lore
but it's a fucking disaster.
it was my first too
the manga follows the story better
or maybe 2
i have one thing to resent to arpeggio
i agree
kongou was pretty
takao
Kancolle is not my thing.
HSF bored me
arpeggio is the only good one imho
attempting the other shipgirl thingies
after
imho
arpeggio cgi were cool
**2009**
A FREAKING SEINEN to boot
first Shipgirl anime
culture.
arpeggio is

no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf-9w9O5B7o
THIS IS COMING
HANDS UP
BUT YEAH PEOPLE
and sometimes the headca**n**nons are in the way
i love theorizing and connecting nasu lore but it can be whacky
1) Yes, Go fate
2) No, Go tsukihime/Knk and friends
Is Alaya > Gaia?
go run by one question
but yeah mostly nasuverse worlds
Lol
lmao
the entire nasuverse leans on that
lostbelts are cut off parallel worlds that went borked
https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Parallel_World
literally
it's just because of the parallel world theory
and that's the coolest part of nasuverse.
and on the other side, the Tsukihime world lore is underdeveloped
since fgo is a thing
but yeah jokes aside fate is cool, the problem is that the lore is overbloated
😂
that FGO version is remade
was so pushed
that np
😂
Heaven's Hole?
playing by yourself is better
i kinda know your feel
and full text
there is a walkthrough with subs
but they did not translate on the game itself
bb later
play some more super robot wars
well i think i'm gonna

not!overlord
i was having millhi explain
you baddie.
ENLIGHT ME
WHAT'S THAT
UH
so priorities
but i'm buying other stuff.
i do have money
no no look
to grimgar.
no i was referring
anyways firezero my backlog is whacky
LOL
not!overlord?
my backlog?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
*drown myself in suffering*
or i should say
i would have liked buying it but i'm short on cash rn so i will delight myself with yarr harr pdfs
good job
you madman
Lol
this fuckery
you gotta explain me
LOL
uh
so cheap
anyways SAO vol 01 costs 11€
i was laughing at the typo
dw dw i understood
30$*
SAO LN 30€?
btw no what
lmao
at first
you said play
well
uh
fatal bullet to finish.
i got
i was like "WTF, not gonna pay 25€ for a LN volume"
12€ 😂
they reset the accel world volume price back to normal
the amazon bs ended
finally
oh btw
i fucking laughed so much when i noticed
during lenessia speech
in the crowd
with Wolf heads
there is a bunch of Adventurers
to MWAM
had an homage
There's a new character (not in the anime) who takes the plot in
i'm missing chunks in my memory
gotta re-read it
since there are bigger deals
it doesn't focus in that way tho
after the end of the anime.
he does || find || his sister
but that's just a background possibility
Ayato was searching his sister like a madman
that scares me.
"Siscon"
The problem is the hidden card
Well Kirin Todou is in the way but doesn't accomplish next to anything, Saya Sasamiya pushes her way in claiming her childhood friendship, then there's the pandora's wielder (Claudia) but she's lowkey and doesn't really count/have true relevance
Julis and Ayato do have feelings for eachother and the thing slowly develops
but on other matters
The thing is that asterisk didn't focus on the romance itself leaving it in background
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
opinions
but i'm serious, i prefer asterisk to rakudai
i provoked it knowing people here have other tastes
well firezero this was a joke discussion
my volumes are there to disagree!

*extreme disagreement*
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
nooh
She is pls
than stella.
Julis is better
<@!279341087494242304>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
ASTERISK IS BETTER
^
the novel is ongoin g
yes
battle schools were a thing of late mid 2000s and early 2010s
all in 2013-2014
Battle school trinity = Rakudai, Asterisk, Seirei tsukai
lol
they aren't, the trinity is past 2010.
*buys asterisk war volume 09*
NEED THOSE
WHERE
WHERE ARE MY BATTLE SCHOOLS
to isekais

Am i the only one watching sao
But the average has gone up in recent years
When i see something good/bad i point it out
For me
Depends
fz i read when i got nothing to do
no
in 1 day??
<@!202444817043685386> waht about it
lmao
yeah sao is just not that kind of story
lol
every time
it's not like we gotta put everyone in damn life threatening situations
and look it's alright
yeah
i can hold it
but since it doesn't take up that much
it was fillery
it's easier to refer them with the arc name
Aincrad = S1 first half
Fairy Dances = s1 second half
Phantom bullet = GGO (s2 first part)
Excalibur = between mother's rosario and Phantom bullet
Mother's rosario = S2 Last part
but only there
a great character in Sao Progressive.
Kirito is actually
he proves it in Accel world and Progressive
reki can write
but not same author
ggo is great
tenfolds
the thing improves
or is absent
every time kirito is not a powercreep
<@!181591926636544002> that's a classic

lmao
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Issei route where

she missed the chance once
sad story about eucliwood hellscythe
2012
https://puu.sh/Gaujp/f3d2291d1a.png
rip
but she won in 2013...
came out.
because Railgun T
is re-eligible
mikoto misaka
uh i believe
lol
it's alright
in the same show
as they don't get VS
but as long
lol
are randomized
brackets
But tedeza rize is qt
And dropped it
Gochiusa
I disliked
so different than the adaptation?
is Unicorn Novel
btw  mel
"wtf is going on with Judau's VA"
i was like
i agree with you solo
I I DON'T HAVE WORDS
NO LOL
THE HECK AM I WATCHING
LOL
quite a bit
and 0083 protag
I liked 08th ms team protag
Even Early Amuro Ray was better
i cannot bear him
but he's obnoxious at it
Kamille was unjustified whining
look i'm not saying
uhm
*Ore wa gundam*
HAH SETSUNA
and freaking Fa makes things worse
whining about everything
but he's still trashy
in that aspect i agree with you
oh well
can you say that
come on how
NOOO
even judau was better
😦
i really dislike kamille
YOU HAVE IT?
WAIT
it does
wait
it's too much cool
i was like a kid when i saw it
D:
https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kVdpn01nL._AC_.jpg
but
cool indeed
BUT THE ORCHIS IS SO COOL
thanks for clarifying that
Orchis is the name?
the Stamen is the MS alone
complete with the heavy weaponry and huge thrusters
GP03 Dendrobium is the big thing
you know my problem now
eeeh
not the dendrobium
hold it that's the stamen alone
link plox
the other is overpriced
very old
one is old
iirc
there are 2 models
THE DENDOBRIUM
but but
.
that doesn't cost 300€
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Give me a new GP03 gunpla
BUT I HAVE ONE REQUEST
legit
Lol
i know
i liked this.
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/2/2d/Nz-666.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160225064846
mobile armorssss
will keep that in mind.
oh
and Haman is a great character imho
but in the end it was okay
made me angry.
ditching Bright Noa orders
THese fucking kids
because
ZZ ticks me off a bit
*infinite stratos laura figma with armor where*
Prettyyyyy

as a gunpla
well i do have a pretty sazabi
panic
it would be an endless thing
I would never buy it
LOL
OH GOD
Is stretching it?
It means that removing it for one of the used case
It's used in various situations
That's not really true?
Uh
Yeah lol
Theoretically
Of scifi
Mecha is a subgenre
I think that's stretching the definition
Blonde girls
*coughs takeuchi*
For me is just a plus
Uhm the mecha element?
Like date a live is a mecha, ridiculously enough
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Figure it out
Frame armed girls are classified as mecha
one of the reasons is because *i* stopped bringing it up
Nah we just don't
that's for angry
we don't miso
but ofc i can't be omniscent
that nowadays just gets dodged
the worst argument i've seen happening was the usual ver discussion
but yeah, i don't have anything more to say, i think i've expressed my opinion
with the emote on
the server had been fine for years
plus that's an historical emote
D:
but that one is not a bad one!
yeah that's one of the uses
it would not modify people behaviour
but that's just an addition to that case
of course doesn't it
but me is me, my opinion of course can't be shared globally
https://puu.sh/Gc98Z/59fdea979e.png
for example i would not  see this case as bad use
look you're free to think whatever you want but i don't agree, and even if it may seem it's just because i like ver, it really isn't.
There are lots of emotes used, it should be more than enough to tell people who use it wrongly that they're doing so
let's wind this down mel, i just wanted to express my dissent about removing an emote that in some cases has been misused
okay okay
Look maybe it's me sleeping during US timezones but... i've not seen that happen in the recent months
was that a shotfire? lmao
I didn't say a word about him.
Hm?
And we were not discussing about ver
Where? In this case it wasn't directed at that
it expresses the despair
.
and yeah this is how you post ver under urobutcher anime
IT'S UROBUTCHER
but
Madoka is a majokko
uh
fun how is that she was going to sleep and i just woke up trying to connect my brain to reality from being just awoken
go sleep and take care
this late
Well mel, sorry for keeping you on the edge
very important one
^ this is an important thing
tunnelvisions you
going full ape sometimes
yeah we should
eh that's important
or it has been just in some cases
but is that really toxic?
pointy double edged sword
again
^ more or less
i can still answer to ramifications right <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i'm just answering to other replies
dw
that's not the point
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
anyways for the second time, i don't really have more stuff to say to express my disagreement
Words does not need to be that agressive to kill people, this remembers me a certain sentence "Please remember that you can kill people with words"
a very pointy one.
as double edged sword
Mel treat that
LOL
here
once understood the issue
to refrain
usually people are polite enough
mel no one should change people heads but if you remove that one it wont reduce the arguments
some tone it down and become normal
some have been kicked
some hot heads spawn here and there
that's natural
it's just because we have new users
but censoring ver wont change people heads
a problem appears
sure sometimes
i didn't see that
has it gone downwards?
in majority of the cases
because OF COURSE the thing is not going to kick in so early
i will give f all and ignore that rule
50 episodes
if we talk about something long like...
i mean
depending on the cases
the three episode tests
i've grown to ignore
look
true enough on that
i'm not the only one then
i'm just honestly not remembering the thing
no no i believe you
x_X
i'm not a database
years have passed
ye i apparently forgot
but maybe i was younger
i didn't notice that
uh
Suisei No Gargantia
y
gargantia was fucking great
fate zero was basically nasu asking him to not destroy the world in the process
oh well
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
HOPE YOU SAY
"Watch it watch it"
push mainstream shows on yourface
like i hate when people
just do so
and want to try
your opinion
oh well if you feel you can improve
no one must like everything
it's fine not liking it
Urobu-tcher
Urobuchi
it's the surname and nickname of the author
nop
and apparently that's his only way to do it
he likes to write grimdark stuff where people die
the author
10/10
mel giving the most hardcore "no" of history
LOL
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I REALLY LIKED the concept
KABANERI

that much
flip flappers
i didn't like
obv
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
on ep 4?
s1 has the lowpoint
Gear suffers around a certain point
eeeh?
yeah i agree to shem
under that rule
yeah s;g would suffer
lol miso
and xabungle is another thing i want to watch
it's literally full turn a plot as main plot+xabungle shenanigans+mazinger shenanigans
by playing SRW AG
to myself
and i spoiled it fully
of 4 timelines
it's like the end
oh of course
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
the moon people, the princess
is 1:1 with Turn A
but the damn premise
Yes i agree with that
recycled
it's really a gundam plotline
but...
to aldnoah
i still gave an 8
Look
i needed the original aquarion first
without realizing i
and dropped halfway
of watching evol
i did the mistake
to recycle Turn A gundam plotline
and no alnoah zero is a sorry excuse
GIFF MECHA
i could jump on it after watching the anime if i like it
oh it's  a manga nadesico
in case i want to delve further?
does it have a source
LOL
even with the movie mel?
srw itched me too much.
is Nadesico.
a show i need to watch
anyways
can you link mel?
i didn't know
does it mel?
uh
and loved it.
who chugged fairy tail

i never saw the charm people found in naruto
Lol
(ranma was fucking great, fight me)

**GASOLINE**
BUT

i've seen people
FROM ACCEL WORLD

and she's not even that mini
worst minitsundere
D:

D:
it's not my fault
anyways shem
after 2016 killed everything
i think people were hardened with prejudice
D:
*mostly*
mostly
2017 got things fixed
2016 is a disaster
LMAO
I SCRATCH THAT

HAH COME ON

SWEET ROMANCE INDEED
LOL
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
my brain drove into watamote when i read that
but then forgot about it
i actually watched zoids as a kid
and funfact

i-ve been a great fan
only up to Guardian forces tho!
❤️

that's not true
Ah come on
(superior product!)
in accel world
at least till volume 14
like that
andyeah there are no scenes
as a whole
Fairy dances sucks.
but
the others do work
i think that was the avoidable one
looks just out of place
and the alicization wotu scene
you can literally see how his writings evolves
well yeah
LNs do it right
don't think as ww3 is no mikoto
ruined ww3.
Index 3
<@!262326868366065664> don't forget

AND HEY
https://hon-hikidashi.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/200617EDENSZERO_main02.jpg ez designs
btw
it just fits.
while it doesn't in the anime
the pacing fails in the manga
is the pacing
in the manga
The main problem of that arc
similar they may be
to FT ones
I prefer EZ designs
but EZ is a Scifi manga
dunno
while it being 1:1 it just works.
it's a rare case where Anime > Manga
the anime did it better.
is EXCLUSIVE to the manga
the end
tbh Fairy tail main problem towards
|| https://edenszero.fandom.com/wiki/Elsie_Crimson ||
|| Elsie Crimson vs Erza Scarlet ||
(only in aesthetics tho)
that's just him loving his character too much
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
oh and there's a character based on erza of course
is good
hiro mashima understanding his mistakes
yeah

Happy is in EZ
Hah
Rebecca >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Lucy

lmao

Death battles legit explain their choices
back in the day

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjEmHi5rEFE lmao this was the vid
Death battles do research
One minute melee was more mindless
"EEEH but KIRITOH"
and people whined over
where Guts kicked Kirito's ass
i still remember the one minute melee
YOU CURSED MINDS
LOL
NO PLS
oh lol
imas?
.

he's just sitting on his ass doing
well it doesn't count if he doesn't write

btw solo that i know of
1979
https://myanimelist.net/manga/14066/Guin_Saga
shenanigans
High fantasy
ever made
it's the longest ln
Guin saga counts 134 volumes
nah solo
tfw the author dies before the thing is finished
are something that the anime cannot begin to show
Index Powerlevels
**very badly**
he got beaten
he's the lowest key character from science side imho
Sojita gunha gets blasted in the novels
lmao
||this guy had the guts to threaten aleister crowley||

ot index harem shenanigans
THE BEST THEY EVER MADE
I HAVE TO AGREE HERE
AND
gn
well i'm going to bed
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"why jotaro doesn't take damage from ken martial arts?"
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
That's why i called it out
stuff went flying
i remember when the video Jotaro Kujo vs Ken came out
Lol solo
they are indeed
yeah
moar fans whining
other video i remember from OMM was Asuna losing from a under the night in birth character
😂
with OPPOSITE results
and it ended
in both OMM and DB
happened
Oh i remember when Natsu vs Ace
Accel is one of the best crafted anti-hero characters
for reasons that would take days to explain
Zaia he || turned himself in ||
she will just grow like a normal human at some point
LO has the biological age of a 11-12 year girl
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Except ||accel|| is in jail??
they will just have a shorter lifespan
Misaka worst is the proof
Every clone will grow independently
yes
she doesn't have a romantic affection
Kinuhata just teases him
her || death || doesn't introduce another girl
wait
but || he's in jail now ||
who promised to become his wife once grown
in theory has Last order
btw Accelerator
then i can't spoil about frenda.
did you watch index 3?
you should say
||Fre/nda||
AHAHA
y
but he lives in the same house as || mugino shizuri and the other girl ||
no unofficial
he risked death for her several and several times
Takitsubou rikou is his official GF
Hamazura IS in actual relationship
Hamazura got cool shit in the end
Lol
Hamazura?
|| Aleister crowley || is gone
is zeroed later on
look i understand that index isn't for everyone, but i find Academy city stuff too much linear for my tastes, and watch out that the science/magic difference
LN starts in july, rn after 48 volumes we FINALLY are in 25th December
he has to repeat
for the same reason that led him to lose one year of school
in the end shipping is fine but touma doesn't have the TIME to think about romance
itsuwa is a side side character
after 36 volumes, sure but still
a really good chardev
later on
Mikoto has a blast of character development
and mikoto is a tsundere || no moar ||
as mikoto now
AND HEY Misaki shokuhou has the same relevance
but yeah science side is wonky, i find that magic side is wonderfully crafted
else i would be spoiling
i cant' say more
is based on magic one.
science side
it's just because
we had a literal magic goddess || destroying the universe and reshaping it million of times just to make touma suffer, thus killing him same number of times ||
the scale is just too great
+ there are the scenes where she interacts with her clones
the anime skipped.
well that scene happens.
with electricity in the opening
a military craft jet aicraft
fighting by controlling
You seen mikoto
^_^
we don't know what Mikoto is up to
while the focus is on touma/accel/hamazura
You can
and happens in 3 days?
WW3 is content heavy
cramming 3 big LN volumes
again they made a 6 episde arc
sadly
THe anime cut out some mikoto scenes
That's wrong zaia
rn
Misaki is a main character on par with mikoto
on the other hand
in the novels
Junko exists but never appears
except the part where he gets|| beaten to death ||
so he could be up to do whatever
Gunha rarely appears in main novels
20-22
the best OT arc ~ ww3
the same
yeah zaia i believe
else it wont work
Once it hits volume 20 in timeline mikoto **has** to follow touma in || russia ||
ye ye
is past index volume 16 timeline wise.
Railgun iirc right now
Yuzuriha Yuriko iirc, is famous
Accel Genderbend Doujin
LOL
this is the official story
for HO alone.
Heavy Object came out in 2014, they used the funds for HO+Index
for that.
Miki kazuma had to apologize in public
and embarassed themselves
Then JC messed things up with funds
You know that index 3 was coming out in 2014.
borked things out.
is because JC staff
The reason it took so long
.
that fucking scene is not in OT final volume
in index 3 finale
and they put NT prologue
on the sales, Index 3 sold waaaaaaaaaaaaay more than index 2 and 1 combined, Accel and Railgun T sold A LOT
It depends
22 vol long
OT took 3 seasons and came out bad
3-4
nah
I would say 2-3 seasons
23 volumes
NT counts
for NT
and OT is just a buildup
that are really weak
But yeah in the end the problem with index are the entry point
but this is making things short.
and the only way to do so is turning himself in to make an example
he wants to blot out the dark side of academy city now that || aleister is gone ||
that-s not the reason
nah zaia
for the first time.
tfw one of the best characters of the franchise appears at volume 43
Demon chan!
❤️
BUT HE'S GOT A PRETTY DEMONESS NOW with him
is the correct term
he pretends
Flying at mach 6 speed doesn't make him a god that can fix every situation
because he's got his little world to protect
he had to get bothered
no zaia
you can find in japanese subculture
OT is auto conclusive, the author just restarted the plot
so Index NT 1
the anime will just be called Index NT
since OT story **ended**
i don't think index will follow that kind of numbers
But anyways
lmao
sure.
Railgun five
lmao
for once the letter makes sense
Railgun F would be Railgun Fourth
means Railgun THIRD
Railgun T
Nevis
that's what i'm saying
but index 3 aired 8 months before
y
i think that would happen at the same time
As they did these 2 last years
nah
since i didn't register the T
ye i didn't understand
it will end before, since the manga is not there yet
no Railgun T wont reach WW3
connected my brain
i just
hoooooooold on
so that's a free slot for the author to use in railgun
the 19th-29th happens in background.
do tell us the happenings of the LAST DAY
the volumes in index
WW3 Starts on 19th October, ends on 30th October
What i just said
and seeing the thing from her perspective
then Mikoto joining the war
Look in short i see some arc original to railgun before WW3 climax (20-21-22)
the volume is telling Mikoto + misaki ||trying to save him ||
on || the verge of dying ||
Touma rn is bedbound in hospital
at the same time
he follows groups of main characters
The author doesn't follow touma alone
doing his shenanigans
its prologue happens while touma is in venice
in Railgun?
You know Dreamranker arc
in Index
like Level Upper is not even mentioned
it happened before
lol
keep in mind the manga story is written by the same author
that the things do connect
is well crafted enough
The toaruverse
nah
Railgun manga rn is around... 6 days before ww3 starts
no
imho
it would be neat for Railgun to fill that spot
as you can see
it's the ONLY timeskip the novels do
telling that the war is ongoing
The novel just skips that week
to make stuff
to use there
Railgun has a free week
Zaia there's not such problem
AC is an indepentent city doesn't respond to main government
she really appears on time tbh
expecially because AC military forces are mobilizing
in AC
So anything could happen in that empty week
WW3 Climax is 3 volumes.
is Blank in the novels
WW3 Continues
October
Check here
https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/images/7/7d/A_Certain_Unified_Calendar.png
the timeline
lemme check
as soon as she learns.
She rushes to russia
it's up to the 2 heroines
|| he got poisoned by something magical and this magical poison is faster than imagine breaker ||
he can't do shit
<@!195044406343106560> this time
she doesn't exist basically
in main novels
Saten is mentioned only once
https://cdn-eu.anidb.net/images/main/224996.jpg
is an old woman
Queen Elizard of england
no lol
??????
queen!
LOL
and fanboying around
i can only theorize so far
but yeah we will see what happens
coz of Railgun 4th
Railgun F
ye since you can-t call it
lmao
❤️
|| https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D_5ApsjXUAIxun0.png ||
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
at his side
to the point || he gets a demon ||
Accel gets involved with the magic side
in the novels
and hamazura
Accel is followed at the same time as touma
is there a need tho?
best climaxes.
but yeah fun how the best parts of index novels are NT 9-10 and NT 19-20-21-22-22R
an investment
remember it requires
because accel manga *ended*
about accel
look i'm not so sure
ever
and it became my favourite universe
and started the novels
that's why i just gave up
it would be a feat
well same
the anime managed to kill that by putting NT prologue in last ep
to make NT
Oh god
Ot ends with || touma 2nd death||
Eh ik
Last scene is not in ot
Mill they will, they put nt prologue in index 3 last ep
^
The author explains
Look when something major is called out
||Aleister Crowley stuff||
Ofc it seems an asspull if you do not know
It's based on an irl system
Magic is not an asspull
Btw btw
Magick
But since magic and science ||~are the same~||
It does...
But his powers can't negate what he doesn't know
End.
Are vector control
Accel powers
Kamachi is a fucking magician i bet on it
Thelema!
And stuff
On irl book of the law
Is based
Index magic
And thus index is a weak entry
That's the issue
The magic stuff is like a buildup
lol
i wanted to understand
np
i had this doubt but i forgot
or not?
you read index novels?
before
Anyways lankpants returning briefly to the discussion
ICHIKA SPOTTED
but i liked danmachi s1
i dropped danmachi s2
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
the thing improves.
and infact when kirito gets beaten and busted
Kirito is pure powercreeping
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
is comparable to kirito.
Bell cranel
i don't think
Ikr
we don't really know
to get to NT
that jc staff could have rushed on purpose
look there's always the thing
lmao
in 0079
punched Kai in the face
Bright noa
now that i think on it
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
oh it is?
<@!195566400541032448> take this to <#336310266654490624> so more people can see it
|| stalker mikoto when||
||Hamazura shiage|| gets introduced in Battle royale anyways...
mandatory.
Those are not
it's watchable but i strongly suggest to read the novel of it
even if half assed
Old testament was 100% adapted
that's all you need to read if you want to venture in index novels
for now
Genesis testament is 47-48
New testament is 23-46
Old testament is volume 01-22
really
there's no confusion
not the vector itself
is the unnatural thing
no because the vector change
that sound effect
but yeah that's how basically touma's mind perceives it
and it's fucking cooler
they changed it
in index 3
i loved the sound effect
he must touch the stake at the same time accel throws it
if accel throws an iron stake at him it wont negate the launch
but not the aftereffects
that's all you must know
- Negates supernatural
for now yeah
without spoiling
but yeah it's hard to explain the true IB
maybe not in an explicit way
in the anime
it was shown the conscious part
well
i wont spoil more
and is ||self conscious ||
from what we know
IB is a natural Being
Yes kinda
if the runes aren't negated
innocentius can't be negated
like in Style Case
stuff if not at the source
Also IB can't cancel
Yeah that's correct
i'm on pair
Yes i do
and current generation ib (supressed) is the weakest ib
for example
we know that THor's hammer in mythology had it
Hanabi we still don't 100% know what IB is but we got crapton of new info from 22R
he's scared of what truly lies there
he consciously supresses it
on the other side know that touma IB is not the true IB
would still get the damage
meanwhile the otherparts of the body
to do so
the hand
It must reach
it is happening || in gt02, he is dying but IB can't save him from the mystic poison he got injected ||
if surpassed touma can rip
that IB has a cancelling speed
I mean keep in mind
in that case rip touma
oh well yeah
the Imagine breaker, originally called Illusion Killer, touma's one just cancels supernatural
if he touches him with any other part of his body he would die
Touma does touch accel with his **right hand**
uh
but he still reflects magically created ice shards
is Accelerator not being able to stop magic
another example of this
of course a spell is a different story
touma is fucked anyways
but once triggered
can stop the spark that causes an unnatural event
that Imagine breaker
Isky the point is
Wait wait
that runs in background
in the story
character
but the doctor is a VERy important
i can't spoil what happened there tbf
op doctor
Heaven's Canceller
(deep blood)
for stuff hinted in Izzard arc
and i assure you don't want to chop that right arm off
Lol
hah
with right hooks
YET he sends people flying
he stated that
are street thug level
his fighting skills
LOL
THAT
)
(OT does that in WW3 also, but index 3 failed in showing that
NT works in favour of touma
as you know
exactly
he doesn't know what he was before EP 5
but also remember that touma permanently lost his brain cells
exactly
when he really isn't
as being dumb and shallow
yeah many criticize touma
he lost one year of school because of absence streak
there's no time!
JUST HOW DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO DO SO
for being an ass of main character and not developing romance
Many criticize him
indeed
ultrapacked
it all happens between July and CHRISTMAS AFTER NEARLY 50 VOLUMES
is the timeline
and the most absurd thing
well there are so many great things in the LNs
hah
and universe
index is just my favourite LN
but yeah sorry for fanboying
and GT is great so far
i'm still overwhelmed by that
HAH
not of a big deal
but sure that would just mean reading 2 volumes more
Mikoto can control Watt, Volt and Amp
but touma claimed his heart stopped for a few seconds
so that was not enough
she just shocked him with low amperage
when mikoto tried to fry him
close to dying
Touma was actually
Uh
to theoryze this
never tried but there is plenty of usage of IB
he can just cancel the electrical charge
and overheated
since the coin is already launched
the coin flying
touma can-t stop
NO
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
infact that's how he realizes #2 powers
can control antimatter
btw accel
a vector requires 2 dimensions
outside Quantum Mechanics
Time is a scalar
Isky
Hold on
Since in theory Time can be a vector in Quantum mechanics
that people start questioning if he can control time
is so powerful
Accelerator Power
Look
works
example
The accel
^
in sheer contrast with the magic side which is detailed down to the last bit
is fucked
look the SCIENCE side of the whole toaruverse
is still falling
but a thing that falls on him
flame
it's more about cancelling a magically created
uhm
🤔
i don't remember touma stopping the explosion
:3
go read the ln
AAA is the true cool shit hanabi
and she's like "mh kay?"
she got hit with tasers 3 times iirc
she clings on freaking skycrapers with magnetism
with magnetism
out of iron dust
Misaka also creates a sword
btw misaka's powers are the less weirdest of the whole nasuverse
it's shown in index 2 iirc
melts after being shot
the coin
it gets negated
Tho when the current running through touma touches the hand
sad
|| AAA ||
she gets a legit railgun at a certain time
most of the time
stuff just doesn't work as the author wrote
is borked
the science side
Look as i said
and the range is not that long actually
as a rail
she uses her hand
infact
if the right arm gets bonked
what happens
and we have seen
hanabi is right
yeah
Gensou Goroshi
infact touma says "i will destroy that illusion of yours"
is Illusion Killer
correct translation
and last funfact IB is a localization
it's believed that mjolnir had IB in it
and so on
Touma's IB can negate supernatural, || IB is sentient, it contains several things and it's related to dragons || , it can be put in an object or in a living being, if touma is killed it will respawn somewhere else, || if you cutoff touma's arm, ib will just regenerate a new one while also trying to go berserk ||
IB itself is not fully known
After all
but she did it
not gonna pinpoint for spoilers
by flying.
India to London
travel
1 hour long
mikoto did
i DIDN'T EXPECT SUPPURATION
<@!279341087494242304> watching kannazuki no miko ep 5
CIERU
D:
NO
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
Chie Rumiko, whose name is a homonym of Priestess Ciel, is a homage to Tsukihime in the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni series.[24] She has a love for curry and utilizes six T-squares in the same manner as Ciel handles Black Keys. Ciel's voice actor for the Tsukihime anime also does her voice.
WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW THIS
<@!279341087494242304>
Asuna and kirito are great characters there
For those who liked aincrad, go read progressive it is really good
Oh and this is speaking on the anime ofc
Unital ring is left out
(so far)
Alicization and wotu 9/10
Mother's rosario 9/10
Excalibur 6.5/10
Phantom bullet 6.5/10
Fairy dances: 5/10
Aincrad: 8.5/10
As this conversation happened over and over, i think sao has highs and lows
kotoko-sama strikes
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

to start playing
tbh
i like sao a lot

how nice accel world osts actually sounded
remembering
i was
ah kk
to say "how much i appreciated various SAO arcs"
those were my ratings.
you mistook my post
<@!279341087494242304>
In her background
Tho the pontifex in alicization has a bit of a sad story
Sao antagonists are not relatable because they're often insane/shrouded by mistery
Uhm
❤️
!
ROE 2
the end felt rushed
except
Day Break Illusion was pretty solid
nah
ooh

Oh well that yes
And isky that's partially wrong
Jp. Eng. Before ww2 what
Wat
and he should be fine
but it's a shame to avoid the whole ln just for that, so yeah i suggested him just to read that volume (OT 5) without pics
but nothing major was shown
i understand that it can be unsettling
the pic is LO shown from behind
and the illustrator is really good
coz avoiding them all is a bit sad expecially because index is not an ecchi novel
and tell you what volumes you have to avoid pics
i can waste some time and check
look there's no problem
there is only other little girls around LO age that appears and she's always fully dressed
I can double check if you wish
Btw yeah nothing else reachs that extent
Lol
Lo is not legal
In the whole ln
Iirc that's the only weird pic
With the cloak
The one shrouded
Wait you mean nfsw lo?
Uhm
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/765/469/8da.jpg
Everyone who reads the ln understands touman better
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
This is more or less what can i say
Where he had to choose the lesser evil, || touma rejected his help and made him angry||
Since he does not want to help bad people || and touma is not a good person|| he only observed from the outside without interfering till gt02
He tried to || help touma || in a life/death situation
||https://toarumajutsunoindex.fandom.com/wiki/Aihana_Etsu?file=Aihana_Etsu_ambiguous_pfp.jpg||
Without confirmation
He/she was hinted several times
He has a || metaphysical|| form
Why disappointed?
Friends
None of those are
Btw after 47 volumes the 6# || lv5 || has been unveiled
Study has randos
School is kakine and friends
Item is mugino and friends
Group is accel And friends
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Then the whole item is bad
She is really hot tempered and ruthless, bad is a wrong word
The fun/cursed part is that ||fre/nda wont answer saten calls the day after for obvious reasons||
It's a pretty || brutal death||
That was even censored
|| more like fre/nda||
lol
Higurashi is fucking great aya
?????
Not everyone likes to read
i don't know if i can be bothered in watching it all
and enjoyed it
saw just Bakemonogatari
i honestly

I don't agree.
LOL
WHAT?

in the last 2 series
it's fucking amazing
there's fairy tail
how animations evolved from 2009 to 2018
btw if someone wants to see
lmao
imho
it's not a fully objective thing
with GS CG
i was fine
for example i loved how Sidonia No Kishi used full CGI tech
that trash will be still there
look with or withouth cgi
of course not everyone can be decent
nowadays
great uses of CGI
There are also
Lank
animated like a 2008 anime.
has World trigger
2010s
Like
^
by 90s
which are surpassed
Mid 2000 average anime was animated better than 90s average, the tech was simply superior, of course there are shitty animes badly animated
lol
they don't trust me
no aya
stretching with full hd gundam
can be 2007 sunrise level
and not everything
it's just that you're not used
for 2008
it's okay
that the opponents are fucking broken
uhm it's more
what do you mean hanabi?
uhm
again 😂
will have crappy  anims
if world trigger 2
but yeah people i want to see

it had to end there.
Dragon ball was fine till Cell saga
lmao
rn
and Eden's Zero
are World Trigger
i'm following
but yeah the only 2 shonen mangas
just asta had to stop
i was linking the Anime
yeah probably
for dropping Black Clover.
it's literally my only one reason
SO MUUUUUUUUUCH
AND I HATE THAT
ASTA SCREAMS
want to know why?
at ep 35
black clover
i dropped
pls don't bring me naruto
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
guys what can i say, i liked it a lot
like oracion seis ❤️
and the plot focuses in whole different deals.
it's just that he becomes a background element
and fought at ep 350-.
Zeref is the freaking Final boss ANNOUNCED LIKE AT EP 30
than one
more natsu vs zeref
there are
so i can't relate.
linked
i can't see what you
it's freaking lit.
this is one of my favourite things from 2018.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XZFK6Gsc8w
in the middle of the army
but for example i freakign loved the Natsu vs Zeref
open that video
and i can't
because is kill or die
and often the fights end abruptly
btw
then it will end.
tho sao is a lot popular, and only one arc is left
lol
i was joking
btw cocoa
*laughs in reki*
in b4 sao final arc gathers more
RYUUSEI LOVERS BOOYS
JAM pROJECT

2 seasons
Yesa it does lol
SRW OG anime
i'm gonna watch
btw solo
to drop
we have more colonies
Come on aya let's drop these shonens
that's also why i said Cell saga was supposed to be the end
yeah dragonball is very very very popular in spanish countries
hahah
LOL
ye same fz
but Saiyan was good too
i prefer Frieza's
to Frieza Saga
but i deem it far inferior
Super solo
oh well i did watch
after moguzo fell.
now that i finished reading new toaru volume, gonna start grimgar vol 4
btw mil
*ho ho ho*
FRIEZA
lol
but nowadays... uuuh not so much
in various anime
to like jojo homages
i used
and i dropped it
then part 4 made me understand it was a waste of time
till part 3
i liked jojo
LOL JAR JAR
no i wont.
"BRUH YOU MUST WATCH EVA"
it's the same deal with Eva fans
it's not the most beautiful thing in the anime industry
but
i finished it and liked it a lot
btw k cocoa
they flip over everytime FMAB is touched
**something something** MAL
like the Snake Palace
the fillers are just garbage
over DB Z
DB KAI
i prefer
But no let's downgrade her
Sad thing is that videl had potential too
It's chichi fault
(hey it's animated decently, surpassing Super early episodes )
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QptGSoGpI0E
LOL
BLANCO
GOHAN
Gud
one-two things at time
Lol
i can just read so much
by as much as i love to read
I know, i've been reccomended
nop
my heart breaks every time.
As isekai i'm reading grimgar rn
to read
Adding in plan
:'DD
WHAT A WEIRD SYNOPSIS
LOL
and personal taste is still a thing
Othinus is freaking great
Ohhh don't get me wrong
she's become my fav female character in toaru, and i don't even read railgun
in the LNs
Shokuhou is even better
one of his biggest focal points during WW3 was downplayed and empty
into showing touma
did an horrible job
well yeah me neither, after all index adaptation
poor touman
So it's a what if
if the same thing happened to him
as dark matter
the same route in life
Accel would have taken
it is needed to explain the 2# lv 5
index s3
Index
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
and it's a very sad manga
it was needed to explain what the hell was the deal with kakine teikoku
lmao
it ends there
it was not cut short
for accel and kakine
those were used just to explain a bit of side stuff
Railgun
Accelerator (Ended)
Dark matter (ended)
there are just 3 side stories
nah there aren't
Virtual on?
hm?
?
reached 100 volumes of his lns
the madman
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
*Souyaku Toaru Majutsu no Index Light Novel Volume 2 is Kamachi's 100th volume under Dengeki Bunko label.[3]
Dengeki Bunko celebrated releasing Kamachi's 100th light novel with comments from illustrators, as well as Kamachi Kazuma's comment on the 100th novel anniversary itself.*
and btw
and he's still without part of his brain cells
and an hypocrite too
he is just a *bad person*
when he's so deep that he manages to convince a Magic God and a freaking bacteria that they're doing things wrong <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
coz of a bad adaptation
as bland
Poor touma being treated
?
And watch nadesico
I think i will go back in time instead
will first continue reading grimgar tho, then choose another one
thanks for the suggestions
but yeah other than that
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
from sukasuka (not isekai)
oh right i'm still recovering my shattered soul
to start reading it
for more last embryo volumes
Yeah i'm waiting
has been Mondaiji Tachi
so far my fav isekai novel
in this case
tho #deathmarch i'm reading the WN, i prefer it vs the LN
the madman described a sky tree with giant jellyfishes flying on the top
the Worldbuilding is just outstanding
but holy fuck
the story is not anything amazing
is Death March
i was reading
isekai
Another LN
but yeah this was already suggested to me
it looks interesting
WITH THE SHIP
THE HAND DRAWN THING
OOOH
watching it
the double x
what <@!676272618839605249> ?
even if he's still my least liked character
Ranta is getting better
but the suffering is just a lot.
joined the party
the new guy
D:
my poor soul got crushed
i'm reading Grimgar vol 4
MIL
hanabi hai
ArcV is far better imho
x_x
goddamn zexal
in b4 he cuts short
Mikoto is railroaded to certain things
because this time is no minor event
i'm still waiting to see how kamachi will connect railgun to index once the shit hits the fan
ye understood
plus you didn't see one of the best antiheroes ever written (might be biased but he's still fucking great)
so you watched basically just Index arc and Deep Blood
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and it's wonderful to see how they connect.
because the two things do connect
at this point ash, if you want and have time to waste, i'd suggest you to just watch index, even if the adaptations are so-so
it just works better in railgun
but of course since it's an arc centered around mikoto
it's decent in index
mind you
like the fact that sisters are drawn with hollowish eyes
since in Index it's from Touma POV
are fleshed better
on the other side of course the events of that arc
a part of it yes
one of the best animes
kokoro connect
~~big chested ara ara nee-sama are better ~~
(GIFF MORE HNA ADAPTATIONS)
does it tho?
too much.
and abuses the poor guy
Louise rants TOO MUCH
NO PLS
needs a remake
Umineko
and ironically enough i like all the others.
once again.
and this is the part where i express my deep dislike for Louise
yes
MINITSUNDERES!

<:Ver:704169051391524875>
explaining the Minitsundere quintet deal to a friend
anyways ppls today i was having fun
LOL?
with some heavy pressures
well it's a pretty heavy psychological thriller
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
no eiko shimamiya no party.
MOST IMPORTANT
AND MILLHI
true
(i gave a 10 to the old adaptation)
well 48 eps
or shoot yourself the whole deal
so yeah as millhi said you could wait and see the heck they do with this new anime project
anyways as i tell to everyone, the old anime is structured in Question arc and answer arc, the first season starring the former, the second season starring the latter, if watched in pieces it wont make any sense
^
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
uhm iirc stuff was missing
re-adapting the old routes seems a tad pointless since it was a pretty decent adaptation for its times
we don't know what are they adapting
i suggest to watch higurashi if you can stand it
worse than 1-2
well index 3 was a below average adaptation
46 volumes ongoing since 2003
yeah
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
are surprised of index sales
some people
is a meme
japan does not have taste

LOL
||the succubus || <:Ver:704169051391524875>
i've read the Vol 4 and oh boy
the censorships
i would like to see em managing
plus
are left out
so vol 4-5-7-8-9-10
vol 6 is the movie
The anime adapts Vol 1-2-3
over a "in hiatus" novel
an investment
that would require
yes but
is that it's in hiatus.
the problem with NGNL
Look
*cries as he realizes it will never happen after 14 years*
*wants ayakashibito anime*
minor or major it may be
so adapting one leads to a forced content loss
in theory a vn is the most complete media
worst option turns into fate/2006
and stick to it
The best option is to pick a route to adapt
but.
is the multiple route feature
the thing with VNs
well
it went off on its own and its horrible imho
lmao
was a disaster.
umineko anime
in S2
starts his plot only
plus the second protag
the anime
i'm the first denouncing
no dud i'm not blaming
and greatly written
because he's just good.
but it's really hard to not like touma as LN reader
after **46 volumes**
is in 25th december
Right now the plot
he's thrown in UTTER CHAOS
before july
he doesn't remember shit
into the head of this poor high schooler
now try to get
so many times
|| AND DIES||
that's why he ends up in hospital
Well yeah
to adapt
but of course that would be hard
gets explained
and all the magic stuff
got overstated.
example at how the right hand
That one is just the deepest
explains

<@!205859030051061769>
sadly
in the anime
was inflated
touma punching
it's magicians attempting stuff
tbh
well OT doesn't show anything worthy of note up to a certain point
touma hand
hahah
ofc chono
in 1904
it works on a system existing written by aleister crowley
do not try to measure it but
is off the scales
The magic powerlevel
i'm interested for lots of reasons
but yeah
ye only LN
at how Railgun will face ww3
as i said before i'm interested
in 6 eps.
of old testament
it was just skipped because they pretended to put 3 of the most massive volumes
lol
in the novels?
100% happens
that scene
you know
(and index 3 op1 is still composed by kawada mami but sang by maon)
maon
the openings sang by
except
index 3 is just a disaster in everything
and below average animations
is characterizing touma
basically what index 1-2 fail at
i mean
but
fair enough
i gave it a 6 out of pity
He still does bad shit until where you have read
opposed to the hero
that's an anti hero
ye
hanabi, look i don't agree
lol
of anti hero
he is a great example
when brought if she loves touma she doesn't even flinch and answers that ||she's okay as the things are, she loves the superficial happiness and mood she has that way ||
but she's not shallow at all
she just wants to live like she does at touma dorm
there, index is a deep character who doesn't want to be deep
poor touman
10/10
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
came up in vol 45
happened there
and a consequence of something
(on a lower key  but still)
are still relevant after 40+ volumes
because the sisters
well it was needed
*laughs in plasma ball*
arc indeed
great
because touma doesn't see what mikoto sees and viceversa
brought in parallel
that's the main event
look at the current plot line
rip
very trivial spoiler^
|| touma has to repeat a year of school coz of absences||
in the rest of the week
else
becase touma was busy with something
yeye
dw i'm joking
he's the 2nd mc
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
is not a side character
Accelerator
Index does not spoil Railgun
no
ah
touma was busting his ass off.
and time
and having good vibes
for example when they were partying during daihasesai
since mikoto is not a main character in index
it shows the events from a side view
Railgun does not spoil index
paradoxes!
even betraying his gf
for that
and will do ANYTHING
basically
he fights for his "family" and his gf
Hamazura is a good character
10/10
LOL
IT MAKES BETTER
YE
YE
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
now compare this statement to what you know of touma
"Touma is an hypocrite and a really bad person"
but yeah we are at the point of
ye hamazura is the third
but yeah right now we are at the point of
the third protag is s3 onwards so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
(and becomes one of the greatest anti heroes in the industry)
basically
else it would wreck my brain
the subject
for god sake kamachi has not touched
only.
time is a vector in quantum mechanics
is a scalar
that time is not a vector
The thing is
after 3 hours.
ended up nowhere
"Can Accel time control?"
again the discussion
with science
he screws up 50% of the time
and has the book of the law under his pillow
that Kamachi is a thelema follower
that you could guess
Magic is so perfectly explained
ye and that's what happens
|| ESP powers developed in gakuen toshi are aleister shenanigans, they're still some iffy kind of magic ||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
go read nt.
|| you self spoiled yourself||
hanabi
(not as the level of espers using it)
when used
since magic wrecks your body
Magic Gods territory
there is an hard boundary if we don't enter
like in ww3
but the anime sometimes has to cut it short
Magic is ALWAYS explained
it's right
people with university degree started going full brain
(this brought up a LOOONG 3 HOURS DISCUSSION into a kamachiverse fanserver i'm in)
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
with time manipulation
will end up
else accelerator
so watch out on your words
every time
kamachi screws science
but
and Mikoto is the most flat character till NT13 (?)
because there's a limit to what she can do
but that limited her so much
control electromagnetic fileds
devices
can hack
wrong, Biribiri
if you overdo that
but you get a loop
It is
😂
after 46 vol
we finally got a missing lv 5
oh and people
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
that's why it just doesn't happen in the LN
in the long run
well that can get stale
|| then you discover it's all magic side anyways <:Ver:704169051391524875> @ESP   ||
it works in the anime
and less elaborated
since it's more plain
it is but
just in a different style
that scene
LOL
*IRIS HEART WHERE*
i didn't think in that way
will give it a second shot someday
😦
i ended up dropping it
in that anime
enemies
i disliked the
anime.
the twintails
i agree
ye isky
boule
good civilizaiton
that's
animation
hey it's 2008s
not that much
after all it's all fault on how the plotline works
Question and Answer arcs
they just divided it into
the pacing was okay
nah
something feels off as millhi said
but
it has old scenes
we don't know what will be in the new adaptation
as we discussed yesterday
the 2008 anime was great
Carol
lmao
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> more you think on it more they match
which accelerates time as alicization world does.
thingy
in the unlimited burst
in AW is recalled
the age of the soul
What thing exactly?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
same author, same world, 2022 vs 2045
it's clear that Alicization world is the base for that
which is a thing strongly recalled in accel world as well
They talked about the age of the soul
but in the anime it's a "so-so" explanation
I don't know if the LNs explain it better
so it's a pretty abstract mechanic
something regarding how the soul works
storyu
it's all the same
and became the guy itself
Now think at how the laughing coffing **machete** got buffed
Yes
|| consciousness || came back
Think how kirito
hmmm
which are the base to make brain burst in accel world work, i don't know if the novels explains those better
It's in the weird mechanics of how the fluctlight work
that he managed to overpower ||God Asuna||
he was freaking overpowered
on the laughing coffin member
infact you have proof on this
or Gabriel
Anyone could become powerful as kirito
the key is in "how alicization works"
No
it's the same reason because kirito is so overpowered
his account tho
goes by itself
Okay the Emperor God Vekta account
ye ye the mercenary
gabriel?
here
i'm
The anime will be on pair with the mango soon
Gotta wait
Shining draw
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I am surprised
Over time i've deduced that monogatari is just not for everyone
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
To get yeeted on par of sao/index?
Is that so popular
What is ryuo's work

(i do prefer AW vs SAO, if i have to pick)
the really cool shit happens afterwards
it's a cool anime but that's it
in the anime
Well Accel world does not show its potential
i tripped
edit one of the sentences
lemme
dunno about the LNs
at least in the anime
is that the answer is abstract
i'm not dodging the answer
in gabriel case i think it has to do with his soul
and that's surely how **kirito** got buffed
could be part of the answer
Soul absorption
MOAR
THIS
https://static.zerochan.net/Shiba.Miyuki.full.2587886.jpg
THING COMING THIS SEASON
BEST
BUT
failed on me
danmachi 2
f f s.
Danmachi III.
to fall season
lemme take a look
but anyways
i'm joking
dw
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
and we have italian translation
THe LN was even bought in italy
Just think it like this
to get an s2
but nah rezero was popular enough
it's more important than the studio.
of the LN
no i meant the editor
oh Media Factory
lemme check who is the publisher
i mean why did you think no rezero s2?
Never spoil stuff
not in this case
i didn't read the lN
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
for being an idiot?
yeah but could you blame him
jeez give him a break, he was a 18 y/o neet before this fuckery
even when people went full hate coz of subaru screwing up
rezero was always good
well i think
yeah
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> about aw
then sao is done
2 volumes left till unital ring ends
well
but reki teased too much around this stuff
so far it's only an headcanon
plus that would perfectly match the timeline
from kirito and from asuna
and notice: She has lineaments
look at KYH
But yeah
nicknamed by ||sky raker||
"Sacchan"
fz
up to vol 15 i don't know her true name
and she still could be the daughter of asuna and kirito
we still don't know her identity
hold up on that
YEAH YEAH
LMAO
before his alicization shenanigans
she's near kirito tier
how strong she is
I mean if i have to rate
don't forget she's not a damsel in distress lmao
it's incorrect fz
*kaw kaw*
Princess Snow Black
yes
it's in her alias
nah it's correct calling her princess lol
accel world is great, reki didn't do the mistakes he did on sao
lmao
*plasmic fire*
ON THAT MOVIE
THEY WASTED KOTOKO x ALTIMA
I MEAN NOVA
when the anime ended at vol 4.
by adapting a side story at volume 21.
i still wonder the fuck were they thinking
...
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
*cries*
i WANT AN ACCEL WORLD SEASON 2
this remembers me
ONII SAMA
i didn't read it *yet*
it's so great but as long as i know the adaptation kinda killed the MC personality
mahoukaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
This is Far more important than "Reverse kirito in dungeon"

i said he's costantly at his best
that's why
Exactly
one way road.
lmao
the point is that he would break his own manga
it gonna suck.
eeeeh
if you go back and show me the old accelerator
in the whole LN
COSTANTLY
He's already at his best
is not that great for one simple reason
i think Accelerator
but yeah
we have it again it seems
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
wait where is miku shrug
it's just irrelevant so i can just 🤷‍♂️
but yeah as bad as i might find silent party
6 months
lmao
yeah
Yes
😛
Accel ended.
so the arc is just irrelevant to the universe itself
they used a really sweet spot in the timeline
and the climax happens when touma is down on the beach
it's an empty spot on the timeline
August 24 is silent arc
https://i.redd.it/0fooo1510ba41.png
Things aside
"Raildex"
to get around that
The community created a term
Nah i don't do that
i wont shit on it but i really didn't like it
that one was bad.
IT'S THE FILLER ARC
OH
don't startle me on that
pls eupho
the timeline about silent party
lemme double check
wait
in the LNs
she doesn't even exist
Poor saten
lmapo
10/10
PLS
MIMORIN IN GRIMGAR
BTW MIL
lmao
but yeah academy city is made by a madman, what do you expect?
is a chad
actually misaka's dad
LOL
*FUKOU DA*
lol
this was his ONLY reasoning
"my son wont be judged for his bad luck there"
well touma's dad sent him there...
lol
touma is worse
no mil
i think i just mentioned that the 6# is a thing
lol
no i didn't trust me
but touma is fucked in the head, the #6 was not wrong
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
rip
lol
did you spoil yourself?
you know the #6 deal?
anyways what
"Hey touma, don't you remember?"
by index herself
most iconic sentences
nvm it was one of the
oboete nai?
ne ne touma
and touma bad person confirmed
😂
your #6
here take

6# is fucked bro
rejoice
we have the full 7 lv 5
after 46 volumes
but yeah
kk
and that was intentional.
i hope you know heavy object has the same author
kamachipun
pls
but hey at least now we know all the lv 5
to drop
it would be **very heavy** spoiler
for reasons
But yeah the lv 5 rankings holds no sense in index current plotline point
lmao
in short.
is ||"i think i get stronger, i get stronger"||
Gunha power
Look
|| or to ALEISTER MOTHAFUCKING CROWLEY || himself
it's just that the powerscaling in index sees the espers at the bottom tier, they can't really compare to the "pros" of the magic side
he is still alive

ofc

THAT FEELING WHEN || YOU KNOW GUTS WILL GET ONESHOTTED||

Ah ok
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Wat we talking here
I think she just doesn't have enough space in the main series (At least in the animu)
yeah
plus she's got a  cool personality
(in certain scenes you could say kirito is even dragged around by her)
and she leads the plot way more than him
asuna is more relevant than kirito
but in SAO progressive
You can doubt me whenever you want
*wishes secretly for aw s2*
or wait for Unital Ring
it's either that
well
but asuna is top tier
Even kirito is a good character there
Progressive is so outstanding compared to vanilla sao
i would love such thing
OH DEAR
for SAO Progressive?
Anime
Saying that the whole series is mainly focused around him is an overstatement
.
i can't spoil
but it's more because the masterplan is centered around him
i will give you that
than accel and hama
relevant
btw yes touma is more
"A series of events occurring around a certain magical index."
(was his idea)
damn miki kazuma and his nippon language shenanigans
"Toaru"
in the series name
but no we have the damn trick
Index is main character and all relevant
by that logic
Going
This is correct
basically.
NT 9 and 22R
there are only 2 Volumes in NT centered exclusively on him
"A situation occurring and touma is drawn in it"
Often is
is a wrong statement
"Touma is the focus"
right?
with touma barely appearing
there are entire volumes
you know that
the anime fails
Touma has good vibes in early OT but
the narrator is external
The LN doesn't hanabi
The anime does that
but still it does not center on him
i would not mind after that
i mean touma is a whole different character after a certain point we both know
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
after 22R events
but that's fine
Well yeah
chapt after chapt
at the same time
certain volumes follow them
the stories are a turn over of the 3 protags
and last protag
which is the 3rd
presents Hamazura
Battle royale
i assure you, the series is not centered around touma
and no batol royale in III was horribly done
the anime helped me understanding that
it's not great by itself
that arc is an information load
being mentioned
DRAGON Arc
oh and i see
👊
poor touman
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
the anime really potraits him wrongly
but
character
Touma is a great
index talk
i missed
uuuh
with saying
well i will bash down the previous discussion
about what i like
And sorry if i'm passionate
lol
please
would you stop hating
eupho
she's a *completely flat* character
but between those two
SHe changes twice, the first time she becomes a stalker (see ww3) the second it's <:Ver:704169051391524875>
is Mikoto
that suffered the most in the LNs
The character by the way
with milestones
I will admit that the entire deal is all a buildup
before then well, it's a buildup where the author shows his insanity
i mean ww3 is where touma starts developing seriously
but the anime removed those bits
Were in WW3
Hints of that
(we as LN readers)
We questioned if he was evil even
i mean based on what you know
would you believe me?
"Touma is an hypocrite and bad person"
if i told you
because he-s complex
Touma is great
will stay lovely+
My lovely pic

hey!
which is true if you look at the anime
and plot armored
and shallow
because he seems dumb
Touma is rightfully hated by the anime only viewers
are complex as Shirou and Touma
Not when the characters
Emiya Fate = Emiya/deen < Emiya UBW Anime <<<<< Emiya UBW VN <<<<<<<<<<<<<< Emiya HF Movie <<<<< Emiya HF VN
better
Chono lemme state this
exactly
Yes
the characters go dumb
if you remove those
and inner dialogues
writes monologues
when an author
You know chono
^
instead
HF Emiya is decently adapted
the problem is **heavily shown** in ubw
oh Behind Shirou
and not for everyone patience to keep up
because Index is a really daunting task
ofc i wont say read the ln
and he was already unstable
index 3 killed him to the ground
blasted.
he's ruined.
in the adaptation
De-characterization of a character
*Emiya Shirou Effect*
I already stated this
OT+NT ofc, not counting the only 2volumes GT which are so weird that i cannot say
but that helps the series from not getting boring
45% touma , 35 % accel, 20% hamazura
the relevance
if i have to %
in my opinion
i'm gonna have a bad time
Oh if they fuck up || touma suicide || and his inner dialogue
those are my main interests
Hawaii invasion, NT 9-10, NT11-12-13, 19-20-21-22-22R
something else hanabi
But i can't wait
MY KIHARAS
NOOOOH
LOL
let the madman write
lol
Ash wait for more manga content then
on fucking purpose.
it will, they did add NT prologue to Index III last ep
so mad.
i will go mad
I SWEAR
JC FAILS AGAIN
IF
^_^
Fair enough Chono
waiting for JS06 to translate a volume
i will admit that i'm like a kid
i started in 2014
You know what i mean?
and 46 volumes long.
something ongoing
that one is deciding to read
the problem is
but firezero
lol
not much to show there
Index arc was adapted decently
you can skip VOl 1
I'd say
uhm
go ahead
fz
and goes up in value drastically
THEN NT13+ HAPPENS
but still boring
then she improvesa bit
but yeah mikoto up to WW3 is totally boring
D:
that.
LIKE THAT TO AVOID
WORDED IT
I
"hm okay"
that i'm like
they're good but so lowkey compared what happens in nt
btw i spoiled myself about some events in railgun
they don't read the lns.
if
Railgun Gang is legit
for the task chonop
if you feel up
Go
.

Progressive tells the whole aincrad arc
Basically
Niconico
Lol
And i dislike kazuto kun
Kirito
It made me appreciate
It's great tho mil
Like even in s1 haru after ep 5 is already better
for the 2014
was outstanding graphically
No Asterisk War anime
iirc?
it's dengeki bunko
A1 blasting an huge budget
Asterisk was
Rezero is white fox
no

Aincrad

Oh well it's 100% that he will continue
he's mad.
at the same time.
6 LNs
justbecause he loves writing
of manuscript
meanwhile kamachi is already ready with 10 volumes
but sao is ending you know
obv
oh well
lol
ofc mil
lol
it was still a win
Index 3 sold more than Index 1-2
Anime wise?
yeah
but it has more total sales than sao
the rankings on me
i don't have
no you can't really surpass the money that index gives to the author, it's just too high in number imho
Jokes aside
LOL
with italian
lol
as fifth
railgun V
you pull out
in that case
that says U
you're the third person in a row
Nevis know
(i hope he wont, i want to see misaka going around the world)
if the madman chooses to end the spinoff
Railgun Final even
hence Railgun Fourth
Railgun, Railgun Second, Railgun Third
how it is named
you know that's not
understanding i mean

everyone says Railgun U??
why
leave him be
Accel is || in jail already ||
But even then worst is not even the best misaka around
while last order is the jolly with positive emotions
since the only influx of emotions she gets from the network is negative one.
she's a rotten type of character

she just wants to live her life and nothing else
but she's not evil
she bullied a 12 years old girl to the point she made her cry
Worst is rotten to the core, that's why she's called worst
which of course is rotten.
worst is a beautiful character for her attitude
but that's not the point
is just misaka best okay?
Worst
Look
physically
how mikoto will look in a few years
plus we already know
and let mikoto enter high school
he's already being held back one year
let touma fucking graduate from high school
just 2-3 years
not that long
of course put at the RIGHT spot
JUST ONCE
FOR ONCE
is a timeskip
the thing i would like to see in index tho
Lol
|| no moar tsundere ||
but yeah mikoto is just a more interesting character after she gets her stuff together
nah he's not a villain
LMAO
||https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/images/0/07/Shinyaku_Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_Light_Novel_v03_cover.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111110123912||
|| Hell she meets the president of USA||
she literally ||travels across the globe to stay behind the spikey head||
but don't take what i wrote as "Mikoto stalker" not being interesting
leave him be
nah pls
accel || is in actual prison rn || and the manga ended
PLS
LOL
lol
Wait i'm not catching the joke here
uhm?
if you do railgun without her it wont be as good
and the center of railgun
Mikoto is a different story, she is a side character
is just a bummer
and backtracking on him like that
than he already got in the LNs
because he literally CAN'T get any better
Accelerator manga was uless
the same thing.
it's not
You know
T1 best stalker
it will have to deal with Mikoto Stalking touma around the world
if it continues after Jailbreaker arc
anyways regarding railgun
pls
so far...
rapey villains..
praise the queen
:3
plus imho Misaki Shokuhou > Mikoto
and stay silent

from <#377148557796442134>
i will just repost this
i have a reason to tell that
~~read the novels!~~
2 different beings
Kamijou Touma is NOT Kamijou no Touma
because
when you google about touma
Just be wary
it is an entity
it's not a tool
look ww3, it will be clear that IB is sentient
to the point that || his fucking right hand rebels on him ||
more times than once
but touma changes
"is touma evil at this point?"
we asked ourselves as fanbase
it's just that touma is not a good person
it's hard to explain
lol
i swear.
made me cry
her main scene
Literally one of my fav characters also

d e m o n chan
she's not a person
*stamp certified*
touma is an hypocrite and bad person
:'DDD
touma broken?

and firezero you've read right
by the author
ever written
btw nevis don't ask me that question, it's core plot of the best arc
i will give you that
kongo is a decent character
Lol kongo
lmao
no solo, she's rotten lol
that Misaka Worst is Misaka Best
the joke is
|| Accel is the head chairman of academy city right now, he's just in jail on his own initiative, plus he's supported by Demon Chan||
Look
literally
He can't be alone
dw
lol
He is not alone
he managed to keep the fuck down || while last order was in a life death situation ||
keep his own head in check.
tho he did
i would have said it straight out
nah i'm not that kind of person
lol
i'm not making jokes on you
??
😂
lol sao abridged
and sorry
nah i don't have more to say

pic
i will drop one last
yes
in this case
of suffering
it's not that kind
plus all the bullying
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
she doesn't deserve all the suffering
And Misaki is just a poor victim
but yeah Aleister Crowley made the rankings and not on power level
but was not her fault.
|| well the answer is that she ends up controlling 25 humans including mikoto and index and all ends up in a disaster ||
the anime missed clarifying this.
it's a scale based on "How much are you useful to Aleister Crowley"
drop on the spot the assumption that Higher rating = more powerful
err
mikoto will get controlled.
if misaki tryhards and mikoto is not ready to counter the mental out
2 Maybe
Meltdowner no
can still get controlled.
mikoto tho is not immune.
that can negate mental out
Mikoto and Accel are the only two
the remote is just to direct her power
by using the *fluids* in such brains
of the people
the brain
and fully controls
Misaki is the strongest telepath
uh
i'm laughing at this but none of you is close
lol
nova you underestimate mental out
nor in astral buddy
but yeah i've grown to like misaki without even looking at railgun so her best is not in railgun
lol
cant do that
she's still a telepath
what would happen if || misaki went in berserk and lost control of mental out?||
quiz desu
mental out!
he is.
50 eps long
drank it whole in like 1 week
i was like a kid
i go search "Fiona anime" and i found it
so yeah there was this anime with mechabeasts that stood for a good decade in the side of my brain "gotta find it again" and i remembered only the name of the female protag
1993
i'm a boomer
keep in mind
fz
yes and no
like when i rediscovered zoids
i know that feel
hah
hands down
it's one of the best isekais
(one of my fav composers)
yasuharu takahashi for the osts
plus i hope they keep
it's a freaking trademark
has Database again
I hope S3
great
log horizon is just
**CASTLE OF STONE**
:3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4uxMC0K8Hg
finally we got a pv
for Log horizon 3
i can't wait
anyways
AW LN
n
anyways i read mangas sometimes too
(infact that's what happened but nvm)
pls reki
the tryharder or the powercreep?
who would win
https://pm1.narvii.com/6321/f130d2b819daf28a175083732c548180e1aaf7fe_hq.jpg come on people
novels are my first choice
but if i have to pick
Manga are good
i will keep at it
them
as long as i love reading
he deserves it
HEY he really tryhards
gotta praise the fat boy for his efforts
on AKUSERU WARUDO
i think i will take a break on grimgar after i finish this volume and go back
my manga/novel list
https://anilist.co/user/Cypher05/mangalist
*cries*
MIMORIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
rn
still reading grimgar
I do
goddamn it
on my plan to read
with novels
btw i'm overloaded
lmao
PLS NEVIS
LOL
the author wanted to try and write a mecha
to think that ho was an experiment
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
there <@!195044406343106560>

i'm just too much curious
at some point
or blood sign
heavy object
plus i need to start
in an interview
if i stop i will crash like a plane
He said it
lmao
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
plus it's sad to hate touman
i just love the series and i wont hide that it's in the top 3 fictional metaverses i love
you seem to have misunderstood me
to read index here
is trying to get anyone
oh no one
so i can't really say anything
but i know that feeling
here
since we are like 4 in total who are reading the lns
and not discussions
preaching around
it's just me
except that
understandable
but okay, free to dislike whatever you want
that's not how it works
LOL
while spring one in april/may
is in october
Dengeki fall fest
uh
the post still gives some hope even without confirming anything
even without him stating it
the ln will continue in any case
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"Muh, how is that touma is decent now?"
it will create a Shakugan no Shana 3 effect
if they do thing properly
but you know that will be a lose/lose situation for anime only
look i will still hold my hopes up

Stated on twitter that index will continue
Miki kazuma
Best 10/10
DETABEIS
was fairy tail
that i stood up and watched with dedication going over 300 eps
well let's say the only series
uhm
The male protag is better than natsu and a bit more smarter
About eden's zero female protag, while similar physically she's quite different from her (and better), starting from her background which is the exact opposite
Oh little note
(best ship)
i loved s1 and s2
SIDONIA S3 WHERE
Uuuuh
(yes ez is scifi people)
i'm a sucker for scifi settings
nah i mean
but this last statement might be biased
the setting is interesting
And hell the worldbuilding is pretty too
i'm actually excited and hyped
but i think it's superior
of course it still stays as a battle shonen
if you try to read eden's zero
from his errors
has learnt a lot
Fairy Tail author
it's all based on stealth, fantasy politics, militarism and those 2 war heroes roaming around
the anime
metal gear solid
it's
Look i'm not saying she's useless
than with Summoners per se
I think the problem lays more with lucy
Since the king didn't stop mard geer
but that turned out being useless
i know, i love that scene
from an objective standpoint she didn't manage to make any major turn by herself if you put the last arc aside
millhi is right
i admit that but ^
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
while Lucy can't.
As Celestial SPirit Mage sure, but yukino can defend herself without keys
if you take away the keys.
as celestial spirit mage
Showed how you can do something
Anyways Yukino in fairy tail
plus she's great at dogfighting with spaceships
Rebecca handles herself without using any power vs a big group of bandits with only sheer firearms
that's also her limit
that's her problem
and she's done.
take her keys away
are you trying to make me laugh?
lucy? hah
she is capable to defend herself
for sure
eh twice from me
|| lucy can be summarized as young rich lady that went on adventures because of her whims, meanwhile Rebecca comes from the slums, she's got no money and she works as "B-Tuber" || Plus Rebecca is badass in fights
with a polar opposite background
Rebecca herself is a faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar superior character compared to Lucy
it's because the characters and the story are more interesting
i am biased
look it's not only because
but i'm lot more into EZ
not a spinoff
is a sequel
100 Years Quest
Jellal has no moustache
and in every arc the author told us more
We knew about Zeref and his crap since ever
directly
it's just that it wasn't tackled
since Phantom Lord arc
was always present
Look ft main plot
lol
they are
before Tournament Arc
because FT Plotline itself is "Guild stops this guild"
The point is you can't filler FT in a decent manner
10/10
the Ichiya mini arc
the giant animal one same
Celestial Spirit Rebellion was also crappy
Key Arc Was crap yeah
Depends
uhm
the rest (non filler) is just great for me
a lot
i dislike that arc
is Edolas
i disliked from the whole fairy tail
btw the only arc i can say
superior magician is superior magician
Master Zero did beat natsu in *dragon force at his full power*
breaking it without any explanation
infact i'm still angry at natsu
in the whole fairy tail series
till today Genesis Zero is one of the most fucking broken spells
in the Oracion Seis vs Jellal
when they killed me master zero
with his candy robbed
felt like a kid
i really
while unconscious
he could have gone huge again but no let's break everything with midnight (or was it cobra) killing him
w a s t e d
WASTED POTENTIAL
**dark capriccio**
is MASTER ZERO
FT villain
My fav
*Handsomeness is JUSTICE*
I FREAKING LOVE THAT CHARACTER
MUSCLE MEN!
MEN
MEN
**ICHIYA VS BACCHUS**
173
best ft ep?
pls millhi
but still
and i like her character
I know she has mental traumas
and it results in a waste.
is her main and only limit
near her friends
Mira reasoning of not going full power
Don't mention me mirajane
(and Hiro mashima should stop his fetishes for Erza)
it's just that the other characters are just so big
and i agree on the underutilized part
she's still strong
but okay and thanks
shame
really millhi?
full original...?
was it
Wait
in that adaptation?
have been adapted
do you know how many volumes of lord el melloi case files
fast question
<@!279341087494242304> quick
punch
i still cannot understand the physics on that puch
LOL
insanity i say
for like 10-15 meters?
in Index Sister arc too
Accelerator rolls on the whole railway
with a 360
styl magnus flies away in s1
it's overblown lmao
is his goddamn strenght
the fun fact about his punches
as trademark
right on the cheeks
ye lmao
right?
in gender equality
hey he believes
nah i'm busy
Touma is a bad person

that's a great pairing

in the past
i had rayneshia as ppic for 2 whole years
pls
lol
that-s so wrong
Lenessia is the localized english name
Rayneshia is if you write it in katakana
2 are the legit ones
Rayneshia best character
"Castle of stone!"
Lh3!

This^
What one
are all over the place in the final arc
it's that the power levels
Btw yeah fz
i'm looking forward to the anime, hoping they don't fail (the preview pic already failed on rebecca's design)
no seriously jokes aside, i read the manga, hiro mashima rly improved
sorry aya
than anything Hiro wrote
EZ is better
than in the manga
FT final arc works far better in the anime
gud

nice homage
i know
ye ye
woh
mafia was there?
were best characters of the episode
infact the male pilots and the head engineer there
biplane outspeeding jet fighters that can fly over mach 1-2
wtf
the pilot episode
i absolutely disliked
Outsourcing
Jc staff is 50% flip coin like a1
Depends on how ez is adapted also
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Gj on worldbuilding hiro
And ez setting is just fucking great
She only looks a lot similar, opposite background,|| can hold herself in a fight with guns, really skilled at dogfighting with spacecrafts ||and a decent personality
In every aspect
Btw rebecca is ages better than lucy
|| elsie is a space pirate leader||
It's no secret that hiro loves erza, he even has a daki of her
Secondary character
|| elsie crimson ||
In ez
There's an huge erza homage
Plue? I don't recall him
If they adapt 1:1
He will not have any relevant screentime
He exists and helps rebecca nothing more
And he is useful
In ez
He got like 0 time
Ignore happy
Putting erza v2 aside
A bit more realistic
Btw i think female designs are better in eden's zero
On the dot
Erza has exactly 20 combat armors
Holy shit
With around 20 armor and weapon sets
She's overloaded
Erza doesn't use one weapon
That was pretty weird to me too
http://archive.internationalsaimoe.com/visuals/posters/winner-elimination-2016.png
she won the tornament in 2016
yes
i do the same
well i did abstain on many too
but i think that website is amusing
hm i would agree with you
in vs
with rounds, the characters rotate
it's a 4fun thing solo
Shana won in 2016 after being a runner up since the first time in 2008
i've seen weird shit years ago
you can never expect what that website will pull out, people are weird
<@!238855496797257729> this is the kind of thing that you would enjoy voting at
vote!
go solo
i forgot about this for 1 month
Go vote your waifu/husbando ppls
https://www.internationalsaimoe.com/voting/
what fz
and powervoted him
to no end
Mexicans loved kamijou touma
and heck
where it showed where the vote came from in the world
there was a year
since it's in rounds
the voting is up
i will try to post every time
> https://www.internationalsaimoe.com/voting/
since index 3.
again
he has to face accelerator
but that also means
fuck
D:
coz of oregairu 3?
we get him AGAIN
next year means
WAIT NO
but at least
last year
i did
https://www.internationalsaimoe.com/img/posters/a/winner-yelimination-2018.png
was bad taste
male bracket
2018 winner
their bad taste mil?
you want to see
2009
^
https://www.internationalsaimoe.com/img/posters/a/winner-elimination-2009.jpg
btw mil
are randomized
the VSs
LOL
and she's back coz of rail t and index 3
she won in 2011
like Misaka Mikoto
gets a  new season
until the anime from where the character appears
from next years tournaments
if you win you get banned
has a gimmick
But that website
yes
in 2015, accelerator insta won
fun how when they first introduced male bracket
lol
1st edition was in 2008
WELL MIL
was different
the character and the voting base
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://2008.internationalsaimoe.com/artwork/winnerTiara.jpg the 2008
plus there's a captcha
the website caches the browser and the ip
bots are possible to a certain extent
what solo is saying is possible
infact she had always been a runner up since the 1st edition in 2008
tomori nao is a beast, that-s not ez pic
what
and on misaki mei i just abstained
there
i clicked mikasa
or there's a bare minimum to vote?
there's no cap i believe?
no mil
not main event
but yeah this is Amethyst subtournament
🤷‍♂️
it happens you know
rip
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
solo will hatchet you
they get powervoted now and then
in that website
are actually dangerous
Conan Edogawa and Haibara Ai
beware
oh ppls
🤷‍♂️
but who cares, they never win
they failed the nominations in 2015-2016
made into the tournament
THe problem is how jojo characters
by the voting base itself
are nominated
are in the tournament
people the characters that
my votes
https://puu.sh/GzPUI/d84720ccfa.png
lol
Abstain then
tomori nao
I voted
and will get dunked
he should face accelerator next year
but if they uphold the rule of getting back the winner with re-releases
2018.
hachiman?
What pic
lol carlos
it's fun
lol
no
our anime industry wizard
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
even millhi doesn't know everything
like i skipped misaki mei coz i don't know her opponent
where i don't know
i just avoid the shows
i can't watch everything fz
^
so the abstain actually works on default
https://puu.sh/GzPUI/d84720ccfa.png
and this was the result
supposed to be pressed but i just didn't press it
it's fine
no mil? if it doesn't give error
it will of course auto abstain
.
abstain
you do not have to click
on the abstain
just do not vote
People
Btw i will repost isml in 2 days so we can have more shitfiesta
As well
<@576460351252725777> i like Emilia more
In that contest
Rem won last year
*Waiting for eden's zero*
And that cannot be denied
Their info database is just complete
Lol
For info is better solo
Check mal

Genres aint tags
Lank
It's just too complex to be in that category
It's unclassified by age
Lmao
On toaru
The shonen genre
Find me
So deep that a weak ass anime adaptation hardcore failed him
He's an hypocrite and bad person
Nah
Eeh
So the comparison is eej
Is not overpowered
The problem is that touma
Of each their own but what's different will stay different
And i had to retract my statements
Then i checked the source
In ubw
Lank, i said the same about emiya shirou
But touma will always get dunked by the bad adaptations
Perhaps we search different stuff
Infact brb
Nah i'm just to take a peek
Touma is the example here, no matter how you see it
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
By a normal pistol?
You can negate supernatural but what if you get shot?
It isn't
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
That's only if the show can't use the gimmick properly
Well touma did it first

That's some great way to end an anime
And tought of plastic memories
I went nyoom
For a sec
D: a disaster

At this point
Ye i am jesting
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
Tho that doesn't stop me to say that's false
Watch whatever you like
I agree
Ye
At this point
What can i say
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Genres are often just stated by the publisher
All 12s
I got the vols if you want
Uh no
**yet**
Tell me you don't live in a container
Mc?
Chaos head
Are you
It's so great
I have read the whole ln
I love it
For how short the adspt is
Without damaged chars
Of decent adapt
Oh mil right, mondaiji is a good example
Tl %
Last embryo
I should check
Lol
Miiiil someday you have to show us your room

Hahahaha
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Yeah solo
On index
To catch up
I can't wait for railgun
Putting him aside
Infact the only ones who like him are the ln readers
It's 100% true he's shallow in the anime, it can't be said otherwise
Hanabi leave it be
As it progresses
And while ngnl has that comedic vibe mondaiji gets a lot more serious
It's better imho
??
In mondaiji is godly
Btw the whole isekai setting
Lolol
Dmca
Baka tsuki lost half of it
No boyo
Hahaha
Gunnm
Alita's manga
that i have to read
brought me back in my head
the cyberpunk topic
on a side note
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
my bad there
we got OT
putting aside the stereotypes on Cyberpunk 2077/Shadowrun level
is on an expansion at this point
i'd say that the genre itself
kicking it out the genre is a bit weird
i mean, okay i understand what you're saying here but, matrix does have many clicks with cyberpunk
``, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order``
is cyberpunk itself anyways
High tech AI
Hm i'm not sure of this reasoning
Which in this case is the Setting
i mean i know the dystopia is not mandatory
stuff connects
VR Setting
Dystopia
the style
The matrix is cyberpunk
uh?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*neurodeck* > shadowrun
^
thus said anyone is free to call them whatever <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
tho virtual worlds are not proper isekais
so it's still correct even then
Cyberpunk is a scifi subgenre
And
is not mandatory to be what the mainstream cyberpunk forces
That punk aspect
!
Cyberspace/Virtual world is a cyberpunk setting
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
are cyberpunk?
that VRMMOs
the moment where i point out

it came before the isekai waves
Outbreak company was a neat shot
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
*i am still waiting for Magi season 3*
one sad thing
i was remembering
Todayu
uhm you know, i told you || IB is sentient ||
like wtf is in his right hand
he's got more bigger problems
yeah true lmao
yes
ffs he's in hospital on || 25th dec||
you know getting dragged around the world
but he can't be helped

it needs more zetsubou
i can say that for now the ep saved the series from flying straight in my dropped list
Sigururi ep 3
i just watched
i watched
the only other battle shonen after fairy tail
but yeah other than that
the best duelist of the satellite
is behind the corner
Jesse Wheeler
remember that
but tastes
ugh brs
but it's kaiba
i tought it was shiba tatsuya
btw took me a zoom to recognize cocoa ppic
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
is as solo is writing?
Did you say
nothing else
i'm looking forward is ez
the only battle shonen
look Saiyans having a tail
cocoa.
pls
but yeah eventually i will just read th emanga
i can see that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
is WORLD TRIGGER of course
i'm waiting s2
the other battle shonen
i took myself up to ep 35
it's a shame
fucking asta.
Screaming MC.
for only one reason
which i ended up dropping
was Black Clover
a lot as well
and i dislike chichi
things would get roughy
btw yeah we can-t put a finger on how powerful DBZ Broly is but if he was given enough time to ramp up the output
so DBZ Broly >>>> Cale
overcame that limit.
but DBZ Broly
Backfire for prolonged time
has the limit that cale showed
Legendary SSJ
Okay okay
btw let me check
for frieza
we even have a similar voice
in this case
to jp one
and italian dub is faithful
no lol
Legendary SSJ? that's how described
Legendary SSJ is basically a mode where the power output grows with no limit
I think he could
his power output doesn't have a limit
in super
would have won th etournament of power
i still think that DBZ Broly
btw
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
~~Hanabi, go read index~~
Lol
people
pls
wasn't the H factor
well the aim of the convo
i lost the conversation
?
.
if not i will start to question catgirls
to fall into furry category
are theorically *enough*
shooting random number of 500m
with lala deviluke
fun how it starts
😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_5TKKGIVf8 this was the video
lemme find it again
the dumb video of "Most rich people in anime"
this conversation
You know what reminds me
^ i'm one of those
Frieza Saga best
the buu saga
i disliked
when he flips out well, he gets the cool shit
and that's why he's a cool character
he's too much prideful
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
vegeta should have been the mc
yeah screw goku
and charges cell
vegeta goes in a frenzy
when trunks gets donut'd
fz
BEJIITA SAMA
charging at him
and losing his shit
vs cell
where is vegeta going full dad
lol
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrCqUDGPeRY
can you be more cool than this??
Yes but
but also they brought me back my fav character so it was like throwing a candy to me
nothing spectacular
it was an enjoyable ride
just for the sake
skipping the useless episodes
i watched super once
let's say that i remember lots of things from dbz
best ost.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFudmQkXrco
anyways sicne we are on the topic
in that case well, so much stuff can take him out
regen or not
he will turn back into a normal saiyan
if knocked out
you have to wipe him as soon as possible
you can't stall him
so to cut it short
so he can tank
from the wiki
btw broly has enhanced health regen it seems
could not be stopped
remember he was *deleted*
pretty easily
GOku black would break the tournament
ok ok i understood now
Oh
i'm lost
pre-goku fight goku?
hm?
and not on power side of the thing
nerfing gohan as character
screw her
to a friend of mine
look i showed that op

MUFTY NABYU ERIN

Btw you are forgetting someone pivotal as newtype
"muh embryo created newtypes, innovators, coordinators and so on"
Because srw v explained such stuff with
I am scared of such point
Nah, while the group is fighting aliens, char will decide to drop a colony
!
Tsk all it takes is some pesky newtypes to clear the situation
is also much different from sao
Accel world
pretty art
made by sao illustrator

Sorry
I dislike the rx78
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
It is only in old srws
Again
Well yeah personally i'd like to see more 0083
Gotcha
*cries in one of the best characters*
Does haman karn appear somewhere?
Figured
Lmao
*pulls out a sandrock custom*
We got wing under the table
Btw even putting newtypes aside
Eh i know
it starts with kirito
but never goes good.
playing games
of a little group of people
sao tells the stories
uhm
1) fits the timeline
2) if you look at her design is asuna's features combined to kirito's
3) we don't know KYH real name after 22 volumes
4) kirito exists in AW
Kuroyukihime is Kirito&asuna's daughter
also little headcanon unconfirmed
i would love to see an s2 made by sunrise
since Sunrise stretched their muscles
is quite good
also it's a case where the anime adaptation
i know right?
Anime is volume 1-4
Yes
1-2 vol missing
SAO will end at 24.
now Accel world counts 22 volumes  and counting.
Accel world was supposed to end at volume 8
from the afterwords
i can see him panicking with not knowing how to progress
i mean
eh reki kinda understood his mistakes pretty late.
which is honestly? great.
and started writing Progressive
Solo the author realized that mistake
Also AW is in the psychological subgenre, SAO isn't
(so far)
and i find his journey just great.
other than that Haru becomes slowly a better character
how do you expect him to have some self esteem
he's been bullied his entire short life
that's why i can't really blame him
eh
Kuroyukihime is 3rd year
yes
people pretend too much from him
but second.
not even 3rd year
he's a middle school kid.
of course he's gonna suck in the early arcs of the story
he is 90% character development
Haru is a character "From the Bottom to the Top"
not exactly
Haruyuki Arita
because of the main character
is mostly disliked
Accel world
since it's a grand total of 24 debatable episodes.
but that's a lot to ask to the average anime watcher
it becomes increasingly good
once you pass over PB/GGO
again, kirito powercreep, both ingame and IRL
is Phantom Bullet
the second low point but better than the first
because of: Kirito Powercreep, Asuna Damsel in distress (Asuna is a character with a strong personality it just doesn't work on her)
is Fairy Dances
the lowest point possible
the thing is that sao has highs and lows
that's a stupid rabbit hole
uh that?
AW actually shows nervegear
They fit the timeline
are *everywhere*
The hints that they are
and own the physical copies of that
i read the light novels
i-ve not even subscribed to
youtube keeps suggesting me crap
tl;dr the video ends with the death note and Ea in top 3
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBKMGhgT_8E
from the "Random charts" style
Another dumb video
a super robot one
it's a 1979 anime
than 2008
Yatterman is much older
the anime doesn't reach the point where it analizes that
well dw
her backstory
not the background of the illustration lol
character background
no no i meant
?
she's also a character with a particular background
aaaaaaaah the ln illustrations https://i.pinimg.com/originals/69/53/f1/6953f14b5086616dde7da0b87c2920ba.jpg
on how they're described.
are the basis for brain burst
i can only say that Alicization mechanics
|| Kirito vs Haru || 1-0
he got wasted
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
b tw i will link this || https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/swordartonline/images/5/5c/Accel_World_Volume_10_Chapter_3.png/revision/latest?cb=20161031030341||
KYH is around 160 cm iirc
which is incorrect lol
in height wise
like he comes up to KYH thighs
it kinda just failed
but in some scenes
i know
yeah
so like 12 or 13
2nd year
but haru is a middle school kid
he's a bit taller in the lns
lol
he's drawn shorter than he is
he's 134 cm tall
funfact about haru
(literally first and second arc)
he's a likeable character once you get past the early part of the story
which are everywhere
the map is made out from the social cameras
you're correct
MORE OR LESS yes
and open world mode
with both duel mode
yes
freaking brain burst
accel world instead tells the story of a middle schooler who's being basically "Saved" by a one year older girl who invites him to something that's a game but also much greater
world trigger 9 jan
ooooo
is overflowing

remember that
so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
well IS *is* a mecha
*insert ichika*
or you will end with IS in SRW
weird ideas
calm down with giving bandai
they're ugly-.
freaking evas

seems like srw v

as first series are you talking
wait wait
a 9/10 out of the bucket imho
it's just awesome
holy shit
I finished first Gunnm (Battle Angel Alita) manga
catbox.
the rest well...
<@!279341087494242304> i *did* raid fuwanovel 1 day before they dropped the torrents
but it's what kickstarted Real Robot Mechas
it is a mecha show
(and i said 85% for a reason, 00 for example leans on some super robot typical mechanics)
minovsky?
and what magical particles are we talking about?
mecha
That's the difference between hi tech and low tech
that's not what divides it from super robots
it doesn't mean it can't be a real robot
it's scifi
Just because
In 85% of the case
Gundam is just in real robot category
Lmao
you're a sword of culture as well
i see koori
the anime goes up in quality dramatically
if you replace Ichika
i agree
but ichika and the plotline work against this
if they were developed more
and can be decent characters
the girls are even pretty diverse
he's dense on a black hole level
it's the mc.
it's not the harem itself until s2
*ichika spawns*
is the isekai i enjoyed the most
definitely
Mondaiji Tachi
uh
to continue for example
today is a good day
gotta rush
No
Most tlers are decent now
Tranlation atrocities are rare
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

Funfact in Japanese the sentence structure is half optional and that fucks over
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Go tl
Also mil
Than years ago
Yeah but think that now is far better
Js06 is pretty great for example
to make decent examples
hm i have to think on it
it's the plotline throwing hormone crazed teenager girls at him,
they're not directly at fault
about the girls
or good even.
you can make an Harem and also be decent.
and IS is one of those
but really, most of the cases the hate is provoked by **really bad** examples
disliking harem subgenre
I mean i understand people
^
it's the MC
the harem trope
again it's not
OH MY
i need the atlas academyyyyy
nasu more tsukihime world content WHEN
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
more *CLOCK TOWER*
coz it means
can't wait
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
with female cast
is a battle shonen
is not a mahou shojo
Symphogear
her chardev is just beautiful
for that precise reason
She's awesome
but Yona works because SHE is a great main character
i absolutely agree here
but by logic it should have the same flaws and pros
I THINK that otome genre has more fashion just because it's rarer
Otomes
Once you fuck up the MC it only goes down
i mean the list, sure, it's not that long, but i think that the harem element works when it's not the main focus and has the right MC and Heroines
but it's pretty unique
another great harem
Korezom
How you can make something great just by pulling out an awesome badass MC
is a good harem example.
Trinity Seven
i would also call out Asterisk war, it tends to focus on the plot rather than the harem itself, but i'm a bit biased there so i wont count it
since i've not seen/read it
i wont judge quintuplet
so i tend to remove it when i think of such stuff
something alien to the rest of the series
i've started to think monogatari series
another decent harem is Seto no Hanayome, but that one is a comedy
i would call out Hidan no Aria, but it would not hold a pen, cause the anime just doesn't show enough
Okay if i have to consider a decent harem
lemme open my list

so pretty
tfw you doublecheck js06 twitter
in short
^

but ofc it wasn't meant to be alone
so it seems that s2 doesn't accomplish much
the only problem is that covid forced them to divide the s2 in 2 half cours
what happened there is still a major step
Not a silly "uh ok let's do like this"
Subaru's situation needed a major breakthrough
I think it's better like this
What she proposed || can be on the same level of an eternal marriage ||
The dialogues got cut short
And hold on the whole echidona deal was borked in the anime
It seems the whole point was the huge breakthrough he did as he || talked with the witches ||
I loved rezero s2
Uh
so efficiency should have gone WAY up
that UC is set basically after 2300 AD
but keep in mind

kono light novel ga sugoi
https://puu.sh/GQQz7/6019392288.png
was the first opening
but my fav
Kai op was good
but still.
of course it doesn't compare to eiko shimamiya-sama
how great is this opening?
can we discuss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Lza41FxsY
plus i started to appreciate one of the main heroines
plottwisting intensifies
i'm so glad that i continued it
holy shit
sigururi ep 8
just saw
that is missing from gou
S1 opening had this eldritch feeling
<@!576460351252725777> i saw a comment that goes closer to what i meant
i wont hide i gave a 10/10 to s1 and kai
i like higurashi a lot
dw
please i will watch by myself
drink this time
i'm eager to watch the heck did 07th expansion
don't worry i stopped you
yet
i have not seen gou
before you continue
oh
i will play the vn someday
wiki says 11
i know she's ||mentally ancient ||
i was sure she was younger
rika is really || 11? ||
SOMETHIGN IS MISSING
HOLD ON
oh well that's a personal thing
the|| despair that  rika || feels is immeasurable
like || i felt pain for rena, when she was apologizing ||
anyways you feel sad for the characters after you|| discover the fuck is happening||
^
|| keichi got murdered in hospital ||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
still today we will never know || which one was mion and which one was shion ||
Ohhh well || mion/shion|| is the worst case
it's not 100% clear on purpose.
so we have to ask if keichi || murdering mion and rena  was legitimate defense derailing into murder, or the syringes were just in his head||
do you get what i mean?
i mean || the virus doesn't lead you to eat a fucking NAIL in the food ||
it's a thriller afterall
to interpret
yeah but some of the events are left to the spectators
or it was real || syringes scare me <:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>||
in the end we will never know if it was all in his mind in that arc
|| question arc 1 ends with keichi murdering Mion and Rena, and then committing suicide ||
Also question arc 1
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
|| you were expecting me the mc, but it was me THE MURDERER || Question Arc 1 spoiler
Keichi?? hahaha
they got scared.
bail up on me for group watch higurashi
i had 2 friends
btw funfact
rika went full throttle in kai
s1 had nearly no nipah
Nipah is good civilization
Good.
do i get more NIPAH?
btw i have yet to watch gou
yeah i used totally wrong words
LOL
has a strong note that reminds me of steins gate
also 0.36 of new opening
give me a few mins
i need to rethink on what i've said
it's the vibe
it's not a negative thing
let me think how to rephrase it
i mean
uhm
Z E T S U B O U
was just "well now you're fucked, you've entered a rabbit hole, prepare to suffer"
while old opening
gou opening smells of tryharding
after 10 years i watched the thing
Hell it still gives me chills down the spines.
x_x
i got scarred by the manga and dropped it
again the anime is great, but the manga is something else, both in a bad and good way

"let's watch animus in 60 fps"
it was around the time i discovered i could emulate videos into 60 fps
like in 2014?
everything i watch
i started downloading
one of the best comedy animes i've watched in the last years
a girl wants you and you don't want her around? good just dodge her by doing an high speed backflip over head and walk away like nothing happened, and during everything, save the girl  from falling by using telekinesis

well just look at the opening, it says enough
and upscaled
the fights are so hypey
Yeah lol
Dragonball but with girls
Futari it's kinda unique as long as i know
*blam blam*
for me is futari.
i can say that
it's a whole new thing for who has never listened to pre-nanjo
around 12x5 tracks
5 original albums
so all song till 2009 are Nao era
started in 2003
well fripside
godlike performance

sang Only my railgun
there is a live on youtube where Garnidelia and haruna luna
Look
(i said, exceptions)

tho i will admit Hesitation Snow
infact.
railgun ops.
i don't like
in my opinion much better
nao era fripside^
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh2G-me0iO0
with some exceptions
Fripside yoshino nanjo songs
i don't like
damn yoshino nanjo
hell it was so good

i was listening
not bad i gotta say
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>

*cries in shallow touma*
The animu, weak adapt
Great stuff
Index lns are just something on an another level
of gt
reading new volume
o7
rofl
ah
<@!274279989506211841> ?
well yeah it's a pretty daring long read so i can fully understand if you don't want to embark in the journey, but i can assure you, it's outstanding in every aspect
10/10
fun how sometimes you can think "Wait, hell is breaking loose in gakuen toshi, what is touma doing?" then you remember that he's either overseas or he's in the hospital
where she's the mc
expecially in the last volume
but i gotta say that i'm liking her "Cop character"
i also dislike her
regarding kuroko
but yeah in the end railgun is just a window in the bigger frame, many things are present in index, *coughs* kiharas *coughs* best || doggo || *coughs*
<@!782841825069236236> do you read the lns?
not more than 30 tho
hm
ah
20?
and it's all because of her bratty attitude
in the end
deserving 30 is not that much
that's why it's fair
<@!199928870810419200>
definitely too much
but 60 is a lot yeah
i'd say sakura deserves like 30, she did fuck up some stuff
Sakura suffers 80 and deserves 60
around the same "deservance"
even emiya and shiki tohno suffer more than her on the chart
keep in mind stuff like Guts from berserk are on the top of the chart
this is what the chart says
Deserves 55
suffers 50
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
https://puu.sh/GUgLe/565a1c5661.png
<@!279341087494242304> i was looking closer at the suffering chart and i saw this
95/40 fair enough tho
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
they deranked him to 95
on the Y
my touman in the previous versions was at 100
but yeah doesn't change much
i'd put ver at 40/80
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
On same spot
Againnemiya and shiki tohno
Well other than being an huge brat she's okay
Louise deserves 30 but suffers 20
Poor rika furude
on the characters i know of course
that chart just works.
i gotta say that in my opinion
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

it's just a waste of pilot

i swear i tried to use her
i agree

i just checked by accident
Roux is pretty tall

she really absorbs the impact from judau and friends doing random things
*praise haman*
but ZZ has HAMAN
that i feel conflicted about ZZ
the problem then is
state of mind

plus i think that Fa was REALLY detrimental
(i don't know how much hathaway will whine yet but, can he be more whiny than Kamille?)
in his worst phase
surpassing even amuro
you know that i will point out that he bitched the most
eeeeeh

I think that most of the Cyber Newtypes are neat
it's explained in the end, and he's against people on the same level
and tbh? it's okay the part when|| he comes back||
and seeing kirito getting mauled is just golden
i liked the whole alicization arc from the start to the last
each one has it's own tastes
well if you didn't enjoy alicization per se, just drop it
uh
plot is starting i guess
nautilus showed up
okay just watched nadia ep 4

mikoto || lv 6 || is that a joke? we got freaking || gods || in index
and less mindwhacking
really underwhelming
today i really find railgun events
back in the day
but it's what kickstarted me
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
it's low tier.
wont shield index anime
i'm gonna implode at some point
and even increases it.
how the heck he keeps up the quality
i'm surprised
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
in unison
6 novels
rofl
same author after all
(last vol, the 47th, had kuroko as protag, js)
well it-s all cool until you notice railgun shenanigans are present in index novels but whatever

so you get confused.
but there's a certain amount of names involved
none of them is complicated
there's one answer but <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Railgun, Accel or Index?
Index? index has the question where do i start.

just watched nadia ep 5, poor marie
|| poh was fucking plotarmored ||
he has to repeat!
he's fucked up to the point he lost a school year!
FOR THAT
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME
many are angry at him for not choosing any girl from his harem
0.
touma doesn't have time
to the character
yes it does but it still leaves space to breathe
i'm not understanding what you mean
what^
the plot is too heavy and doesn't leave space
in index
there's almost nothing like that
ah
what is CGDCT?
expecially s3
index lns are really good, index anime is a freaking disaster and weak entry point
i will speak out of 100% of what i think
also go read index
they touch my man touman
some kind of showman? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

i will hands up
nothing more to say, it's 95/100 in the suffering charts
shallow in the adaptation
!
gensou goroshi
just respect the touman
in the end
they're numbered after a twisted backplot reason
those are not based on how much powerful they are
at index lv 5 numbers for example
do not look
i'm not getting what you mean
hm?
powerleveling index is next to impossible
i was talking of concept.
index.
do not powerlevel
is a facade of old testament
index being about magic vs science
and

and i'm very very sorry people
i know i'm boring
i will

she gets big roles, big as mikoto's
and she became my fav after her appearance in the novels
is Misaki Shokuhou
my fav index girl
funnily enough
Lol
only necromancer arc is like
Accel is not bad it's just not existant
yeah it's just better adapted
s1-s2 still do dirty to touman
not one aspect
i have to agree but
mikoto will just start || stalking touma around the world|| for several volumes
i will be always curious how index author will handle railgun plotline once it hits a certain index milestone
last note i was forgetting
also
jc staff just died.
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
3 volumes in 6 episodes
s3 is undefendable
s3 is bad tho
i wont push more on the matter
it's really a big read, and the magic side is the best thing, expecially after you notice it's made on an irl system so much detailed that you guess that the author is a magician, and explains every single thing
index vol 1 - july
index vol 47 - 25th december
47 volumes CRAMMED IN 6 MONTHS OF PLOTLINE
yes
guess what
other than that it's my fav novel
but yeah quick back on index, the novels are a journey i can reccomend only if you can endure a travel of 47+ ongoing volumes
despair ❤️
i agree
have a good journey
i wont say anything
dw
i cried.
the most painful one.
but yeah sukasuka anime leaves out the last volume.
Sukamoka is the sequel
p a i n
i have one word for it
6 volumes (or 5?)
the whole sukasuka ln
I have read
ep 7 so far
y
i don't recall who
we even got someone from south africa iirc
we got a pretty diverse userbase here, the other italian here is akeupho
yes
southern italy
gaaah my brain
GUNDAM
FIVE SUPER ROBOTS
i die every fucking time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNj5UaE6SAc
but still fun
you ain't going to understand much
i'm gonna link it to you
and something like that
with "Gundam you fight the war, unbeatable robot"
Gundam wing opening became something like an italo disco song
i feel my brain derping down
Hokuto no ken  became Ken the warrior
god.
since they took it to the extreme
It's a mainstream meme in the italian anime communities
I DON'T KNOOOOW
"An enchantment opened by the petals of time for Lina"
it became literally
they made a whole new title
okayu
Do you know SLayers?
you don't want to know
oooh
lmao yeah
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
but they tled it into "Il mistero della pietra azzurra" so it's not even blue it's "Nadia the mistery of azure rock"
i don't know
ROCK
not even gem
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
th secret of blue rock
so yeah it becomes
it's the secret of blue water
wait wait
it is
cursed.
.
also fun how they translated from "Nadia of blue water " to "Nadia of the blue rock"
but i didn't remember it being this good.
since they dubbed it in italian
since i was a child
look i've known of this anime
*satellite cannon flashbacc*
my god.
but but the tower
holy fuck
i was not expecting the freakign tower of babel
recognize nadia is getting really interesting
gotta
wtb esp
but yeah the trip has been great, and i'm sorry
no double meaning
PLS
NO NO
i started that journey in 2014 and it got me so hard that i'm fixated x(

my god episode 10, underwater minefield
god i just watched nadia episode 9, this stuff is pretty wow, there's some heavy backplot here slowly unveiling, and Grandis confirms to be 10/10
than kamille freaking bidan?
does she get more bratty
x_x
is neutral
i mean this arc
god
i just watched that
the one where marie escapes being captured?
isn't island arc
wait
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Bright Slap potential situations
pulls out so many
lexi nadia
btw
is nadia.
it's not SRW
yeah
but there's a limit
I mean she has all reasons to whine
because so far she's pretty bad
i hope it really does
eh
okay i'm starting to dislike nadia as a character, i know she doesn't remember her past but she's getting obnoxious
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
https://puu.sh/GY3OV/87d327712b.jpg okay wtf? that guy with the orange bandana
and seeing nadia flip out when they go hunting animals distresses me, give them a break
<@!782841825069236236> Even then, she did not deserve to get dumped like that
poor lady

and our QUATTRO BAJEENA || definitely not!char ||
he's like continuously bullied
on kamille
btw i agree
so far i agree
yeah
at least i got the superior lady Grandis Granva to appreciate
not the anime
to the character
i believe he was referring
😦
how long this infamous island arc last?
i will try to hold it in
-
nadia you gonna get me angry

Tatsuya character?
that kinda kills

many are bummed by the fact that the author really goes into worldbuilding
holy cow
which is A LOT
in the adaptation
a 40% content loss
wtf redditors estimate like
<@!152896851660505088> i'm rewatching Mahouka since s2 is ending, i've made some research

NADIA GOT BRIGHT SLAPPED AGAIN

then drops the thing
it's that the anime tries a bit at first
thematic?
for the glorious nippon
D:
was so dope.
in gate
that scene
NOOO
is best logic
convulted logic
or shoot the colony laser.
colonies
and drop
in SRW V, Okay Angels are raiding the earth, we don't give a fuck
i was laughing when i heard char plan
hahaha
is that what you want solo?
and becomes main focus of colony drops?
meets char aznable
average 12 y/o middle schooler
So like
Ah lol
Srw.
coz whynot.
Feat Cybuster.
and start the new isekai srw plot
in a matter of seconds
that the Quant is going to pop out
is so dangerous
Aya that statement
musicc
take macross for example
you get so many different things

lol
that's not subtle
holy shit
i like gate A LOT, honestly i'm not bummed by the nationalism, we had a similar discussion regarding Zeon in gundam. It's a work of fiction so i'm not bothered by it, but it's 100% legit to dislike it.
well it's understandable
i think Database
Not everyone is mami kawada who is a die-hard index fangirl who offered herself to compose index 3 op while being retired
^
it isn't that easy
are decent.
only maybe 5 of those
fun fact
all you want 25 op like fairy tail
MAWM
but D E T A B E I S
as a group
well at least Bandmaid is decent
Database is a trademark
i agree with Lank
will do LH3 OP
Band Maid
and i'm really sad about it
they don't
no
marielle again ?
for seeing your beloved ruined hair
are you ready
aya
!!!!
WORLD TRIGGER 2
S3
LOG HORIZON
^
how
since when
Danmachi is considered isekai?
Hold on
oh sorry
GATE
you're barring out
by that reasoning
Aya
are a cyberpunk thing
since virtual words and cyberspaces
imho sao just fits Cyberpunk much more than isekai
so it's more limited to how are you restricting the thing
depends on what is the view
https://i.redd.it/kno3w6n79xs01.png (this is what i was talking about)
and that's kinda bs
chart
since we fall into the "Purist"
well i'm not going to pursue the matter
lmao dino
Exactly
"i'm not an isekai"
and gets reminded continuosly in each arc
right after aincrad ends.
the isekai part gets completely shattered
.hack//sign has a really similar situation to aincrad
^
switching between them
Sao is just people in virtual worlds
in SAO gets reminded CONTINUOUSLY
In LH is a key plot point
lmao
it's a key plot point
A small portion?
i want to watch on new season
8 upcoming animes
btw i have like
and that's why LH is an isekai while sao isn't
i mean up to s2 we all were sure it was just a ||virtual world|| but then s2 last arc shatters this hypothesis completeley
it's a proper isekai
it's not a database
it would not work anymore
but from a plot stand point
was reused on purpose
it's a scifi-space
EZ is not fantasy
ace pilot
Aya i will spoil you this, rebecca is **really good** at|| dogfighting with spaceships||
in every aspect
Rebecca is WAY better than lucy
it's rebecca's
also that happy is not the male mc pet
shoots like 2-3 sentences once in like 10 chapters?
90% of the time
doesn't talk
EZ's Happy
worries me
that cover **really**
tho
YUS
https://anilist.co/anime/119683/EDENS-ZERO
oh iirc Eden's Zero comes out this spring
it will be actually great
about world trigger 2, i know what happens, if they don't screw up
RIMURU TEMPESTO
it's really good
from winter 2021
SNK3, YnN2, DR. Stone, Slime, Rezero, lh3, world trigger 2
i'm waiting
back on the discussion
by the way
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
l2p
your name.
i agree on that
was good
kimi no na wa
and that's all i have to say
but it needs that requirement
even multiple
end.
isekai = different world
because it's not
you can't just go around it's an isekai
the tropes are there
it's that just because
to convey to you
Btw what i'm trying
i would not consider in the discussion
is an extreme example
Made in abyss
Fantasy subgenre exists
-> Scifi isekai
It can be even a scifi word for me
no matter how this word is
different word
the exact word isekai
of isekais
you're removing the key point
with that attitude
But lank
solo?
how good is it
this is just being dedicated
it went to the extent of naming a precise type of pasta with the precise venice's dialect term
you can't imagine
is so accurate
that anime
i would have to finish arte
https://anilist.co/anime/116589/86-Eighty-Six

he's strong
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

since they visit various planets
the worldbuilding is just awesome
that's why it's a plus

mil is this where i point out that we never agree
with an horrible pilot episode
it-s just an horrible start

Sigururi really gets good
god.
yns.

i don't know if i agree lank, but sure it would be nice

at least people stand up to kirito
COME ON
IF NOT EVEN STRONGER
AS MC
KIRITO WITH A BOW
freaking vanadis has
Vanadis
i watched is
one weird harem
he's the only male in the entire school
one of them goes up to|| sleeping naked in his bed || and he's still "What are you doing, you can't do that"
and not understanding why they chase him
all he does is running
hardcore pressing on him
a group of girl
Look fed, Ichika has literally
Blade dance has some adaptation issues
and i'm not vouching on this
As long as i know
like Ichika
Fed at least he's not an empty shell with no will

ARCUEID ❤️
pretty
so
i like route based ones
tbh i don't like kinetic novels
38?
how many heroines had shin koihime again?
going full koihime musou again?
are we
|| pink = alien ||
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
there are aliens
goddamn rito

is huge
tho to love ru harem
and by tanking, i mean Tanking with a capital letter
to get to the good stuff
you have to tank the season one
that thing is so cursed
damn to love ru
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
yuki rito his not an adult
nah it's not
it's evident
millhi
example hideo kojima losing his copyright on metal gear
depends on how the copyright is registered
it is entirely possible
nasu gonna be free again once Lostbelt ends on fgo
but do not despair people
i'm telling you what is believed being the reason
i don't know
the thing that doesn't exist kai
Anime's fault
it's cool to read but it's tiring
a thing that coul dhave taken 2 rows, becomes 10 rows long
intricate/intellectual/overcomplex
because he TRYHARDS to make stupid and basic concepts
some parts are really tiring to read
it's a double edged sword
Fed
We, as fanbase, suspect Copyright reasons
really blasting the sky
Lets say that nasu chuuni was at his highest
I've read the LNs
back in 1995? iirc
Kara no Kyoukai is nasu earliest writings
Kara no kyoukai
ah
Shiki?
(urobuchi did, but whatever)=
that we know of
in the fateverse
the only true ancestor that was alive
FGO killed even
of Fate being really overbloated
i'm starting to get sick
but in this last year
I like Nasuverse a lot, even with its flaws
2 What IFs
so same origin
if not, it's tsukihime
If it is defeated we go down Fateverse
or not.
the event that defines "Is this fateverse or tsukihimeverse?" is if Crimson Moon is defeated by rin's ancestor
but yeah
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
SHION ELTNAM ATLASIA
but Tsukihime was also popular back then
Type moon pushed Fate more
It's because
it-s a parallel world
nothing more.
nothing else
Fate = Gaia < Alaya
Tsukihime = Gaia > Alaya
defining the 2 verses
Lexi, there are just 2 things
*cries*
*bows*
GIVE ME MORE TSUKIHIMEVERSE CONTENT
NASU PLEASE
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
the good part of the nasuverse
not in the Fateverse
and it takes place in the Tsukihimeverse
first VN
is Type moon
Tsukihime

Hmmm
You say
Outside the norm
I prefer the wn
Tho i have compared wn ln death march
Yyyyy
Fucking around
The mc is just a tourist
But the girls are nice and the worldbuilding is just outstanding
It's so weird
I read the wn
You are right tho
Miso are you commenting me?
It's an isekai with a really cool worldbuilding but the plot is just the mc being a tourist
Uh depends
Death march to a parallel world rhapsody
Do you know death march?
Yes
Weapon
World building is a really powerful
Boiling on my pan
I got so much stuff
Is dope
Winter 2021
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
Higashide as i said
But that's my opinion
Would end taking the lead
I think that higashide
Well
Will be something
But at least him dropping the scenario writer role
We will see
he wont work on fgo anymore
as in
i meant free
lb 5.5 can be cool how much you want but wasn't necessary
pls
just to gain time
by the fact that LB5 got triplicated

They have to wait reki
2-1 vol missing
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
And progressive also confirmed
Tfw you realize sao is one arc and then it's finished
But yeah people do not get thrown off by ez graphics
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Y
N
But it's far better
the pic clearly exaggerates but it's absolutely not entirely wrong
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

wait where was her pic again
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
stop messing with me
c h a r d e v
she doesn't have the tsun part anymore
but thankfully it wasn't the case
we feared yandere mikoto for a brief bunch of chapters
and starts to act differently
*consciously*
realizes she will get nowhere acting like that
Let's say she just
nah she loses the tsun
Mikoto has been a flat character for more than 20 volumes
*c h a r d e v*
is magic called
Nova
and this is completely ignoring railgun
is Kuroko, while she is not around mikoto, she's pretty great
a character i managed to re-evaluate
*was*
or as i should properly say
well, it doesn't remove that mikoto, *is* a tsundere
i used to like old mikoto a lot, but after reading the "chardevved" mikoto, well wow.
and drops her tsundere shenanigans
she becomes REALLY great
but when she finally does
since she takes a while to chardev
but it gets stale
is a cool character
Mikoto in railgun and early index
she's good
It's really nice to see || misaki and misaka collaborating to save touman from certain death ||
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Yes

Are you sure you aren't mistaking left from right
it's rare for me to agree to lank
it's true fz
haha
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Tetra is great indeed
It's incredible how i get to disagree easily with lank statements but
alicization is good
oh well
rofl
you're the proof carlos
it spoils everything
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
that's why you shouldn't watch abridged before the series
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
mal is always right!!
rates it high!
plus mal
Fleshy mechs
in any way
but i never found it amazing
look AoT is nice
hah
LOL
please share
if anyone gets what i am asking and remembers it
x_x
i call you here, do you remember a certain pic that was posted aroun dhere about fandom size (by artworks numbers)
btw people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RofzRYgZ91I
❤️
told ya, chardev
that happens in the ln
it's a metaphorical scene
n
<@!782841825069236236>
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
poor facebreaker touma
js
heck she is the one (feat misaki) who || actively helps up in saving touman||
it's just me preferring her chardevved version
btw i like her too
https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1123753589220966400
uh
right now new season that starts (i'm already shivering)
infact vol 10 has "Kaname go east"
that were released back then
of the whole 10 volumes
is an adaptation
log horizon
it lasts like 5 eps
lmao
you were there
you could have finished boule
y
but it's necessary because it kickstarts the arc after it
is the kids one
i think the only log horizon boring arc
look
*from
log horizon form it
just do not expect
have fun carlos
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's why alicization is good boule
and that's why it's awesome
Progressive really relies on her being a strong female lead
you hear me reki? it doesn't work!
then fairy dances goes down horribly because ||Asuna is a strong female lead and IT JUST DOESN'T work putting her in the damsel in distress situation||
Aincrad is the good part
in absolute right?
wait first 2 episode
dw
well i wont spoil
the heck you mean dodging an entire load of m16??
failed because of kirito again
but the main plot of it
is really good at the worldbuilding part
GGO
you end up: calm down dude, kirigaya kazuto is here
in sao circumstances, imho, really breaks everything
depends carlos
till alicization punishes him **hardcore**
it's a boring powercreep
the true problem of the series lies in the mc
it's not a comedy or something
Well sao has a serious plot
and i say it as a person who actually likes sao (the only thing i truly disliked is fairy dances)
^<3
if you can't bear sao, it's not worth
to keep it short carlos
well anyways
absolutely^
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i went brrr
so when saoa came out and had a p90
damn stargate, struck me so much with it during middle schools
WAY before it
with p90s
you know i was in love
indeed
i disagree but saoa was great
worldbuilding wise
and it's probably what lays the foundations for accel world
so it's finally the plot going back on track
of first arc
btw alicization is an aftermath
as much as i like sao (i like sao, ppls okay?) i agree with boule
LOL
it's one of my worst anime i ever watched
but holy cow
yeah i've heard that the source material is decent
it's like the ep after it JUST MISSES
WITHOUT EVEN AN OPEN ENDING
I MEAN THE THING ENDS ABRUPTLY
because HOW IT WAS ADAPTED
not because of the thing itself
i finished it and i was horrified
Look look, i just couldn't stand it
MAHOU SENSOU
GODDAMN
they could have made it differently
with barely any animations
wasting 24 mins for a monologue
it was like "wtf man?"
the Monologue one
the raid battle was great but had ONE boring episode
in the north?
you mean the one
is volume 11
i will
lmao
so don't pretend much from me
i have not seen seed /seed destiny
<@!238855496797257729> except
Shit gonna go down
Is "the fall of the round table"
As is announced by the season name
The new arc
But honestly? It doesn't fit anymore plotwise
They shouldn't have switched
It was so iconic
I know sadly
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
-5
*Are you ready* for the punchline? Rest of us are all gimmicks, so check this out!
Carloooos
Island ends at 27-28
Should kick in
Well final arc
No
Ok
Is the texture?
For dodging meat
And really nadia's reason
But i don't hate it
Filled with stupid things
The arc is flat
So i have to say
Grandis &co reappeared
I think i may have finished nadia island arc
<@782841825069236236> lexi
Vol 11
Yeah
<@676272618839605249> saiki is just great
gotcha
where are you from again dud?
no mine sound like weeb cicadas.
i was about to go mad
IRL
i HEAR CICADAS
i close it.
with cicadas
i was watching an anime
once it was a day of summer
btw dud
catches you
before hinamizawa
you should start running
an hidden sign
is that
never
forget people
never
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTjyVUARzBU
i will watch it one day
rofl
it doesn't change
you should already know accel's abilities
?
goes downhill.
because that
vs Accelerator
and hey at least i'm not comparing stuff
i'm just answeringf
he compared it first
ye ofc
rofl
yeah but keep watching and see how lame are his powers
if that's all, Saiki is much more powerful
of so special?
what does mob have
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
31 different type of ESP powers
btw so far the wiki reports
the girl
for example when he dodges
yes
during every saiki's scene
this plays
in a veeeery deep rabbit hole
and shit's gonna go down
you hear this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23OzKC6uwWc
and Judgement knights of thunder 2nd best
btw I am an esper best soundtrack
yes that there's s2
lol
umad bro
i've not finished s2
rofl
that's why i asked
do you mind a list of saiki's powers? or don't want to be spoiled?
including time travel
with his powers
but saiki goes **very** far
about mob
i don't know
best esper
example?
hm?
it's just because || gods and higher beings || are involved in the plotline, and the plot is not made to let the characters randomly fight, it's not a battle shonen x(
to the extent they learned magic
Mages are normal people who learnt to delve with the occult
what about mages?
it's a golden rule in the toaruverse
can't use magic
espers
yeah more or less
but yeah he's broken because he's at the base
but Time is *a vector in quantum mechanics*
Time is a Scalar
that he can control time
Look the fanbase is really scared
is broken by concept
because vector manipulation
yes he is
but i would advise against trying to gauge index powerlevels
so it doesn't actually exist
but accel || "failed" ||
lv 6 was a project yes
this becomes **really important** on the lv 5 ranks
they're ranked on || how much are they useful to aleister || and not purely based on their actual magnitude
or on the levels in general
detail on level 5s
There is one important
but different settings, different reasons
level 0 are looked upon by higher levels
instead index does that in reverse
tho index doesn't go that in depth into describing that, since it's not plot relevant that much as it may seem
i'd guess
well yeah
more or less it's comparable to the index system
back then
was up there in the air
i guess the concept
accel is 16 y/o
well yeah
i didn't know that
but yeah fun coincidence
2003 vol 1 but accel wasn't there so yeah 2004
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
!
2004.
is dated
<@!90164247643828224> accelerator thing
hell lame
i haven't looked into hellshing
rofl
saying more is spoilers
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
everyone went "BRRRRRRRRR IT'S AOGAMI, TOUMA'S FRIEND"
"6# has blue hair"
our most solid hint was
it was hinted twice in the past volumes but then denied
second to last
to really get revealed who the 6# is you gotta read up to GT02 which is the damn 46th volume
because of its damn power
and the author had a freaking great reason for hiding the 6#
we have them all
meme is dead
that
uiharu instead got more relevant roles
in the distance
she appears in 2 artworks
in index LN
funfact, Saten is never mentioned
i will
gotcha
and you're so damn right
i watched needless
i know i know
TRUE TRUE
NEEDLESS
AHAHAHA
it becomes really powerful
if you rank it up
is just low level
uiharu power
i'd say the author is a magician lol
and it's based on an Irl system
is pinpoint accurate
is the magic system
the thing where index is really strong at worldbuilding side
a car.
but it can't flip
of course
and fails on science explanations
so he bars himself
these things
since the author goes in depth into explaining
i can't
but
i would if i could
so it's okay
but hey, it's an anime
at most yes
yeah
since it lacks surface.
to flip a car
the coin shouldn't be able to output enough power
than a puny bullet.
that coin is no more powerful
basically math in hand
i had an engineer explain this to me
is mikoto railgun.
in index
the thing that makes really little sense
Look
i still laugh on that one
ahahah
the fighting is a consequence
yeah
i mean how can explain this
yeah violence is involved that's sure, expecially early on
hm
rofl
released
in the latest volume
she's present
yeah watch out
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs-wNVtoxV0 <@!782841825069236236>
lmao
i was surprised
i was searching "Thinking" and i'm in a toaru discord
he blocked an electric lance
<:thinkbiri:585565526185738240>
Touma never attempted to block a railgun
he would die rofl
he's an esper
accel can't use magic
D:
did i lose index discussion?
uh
If they leave touma time for romance, that is. The poor man can't even go to school by how busy he is
they fight for touman <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
right now in the main novels
<@!782841825069236236> well i guess it's because Misaki has the same relevance as Mikoto
could be could be
oh wait
the pic is incorrect
i think
shokuhou misaki best toaru girl
https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/134418140_4843445932394386_2668973105194525625_o.png?_nc_cat=103&ccb=2&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=3AdfCPVV1W0AX_jgV7P&_nc_ht=scontent-mxp1-1.xx&oh=c60e6ffcaaca1ffa4d74513e7965e07f&oe=60193E5A
he pulls out great volumes after so long
is that kamachi is outstanding
what can i say tho
that's all
but there isn't much to say without spoiling, the volume is just one of the bests
griffy finished the last volume released
yeah
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/images/f/f5/Kihara_Noukan_%28Astral_Buddy%29.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20181228123939 best doggo
it's like the double of a standard golden retriever
wow.
how huge actually noukan is
made me realize
btw this volume
lol
even || aleister || flipped
kamachi did a wonderful job into making her absolutely hateful
Freaking anna sprengel
SAD
I FORGOT ABOUT HER
NOOOO
ONIGUMA
and ww3
it happens a bit during aleister arc
that could be a bit hard to follow
it gets so heavy
it's just that sometimes
everything IS connected
toaru is always like that
that's the usual
Look
The cover says it pretty blatantly
and Hamazura Dark side
light side
the deep constrast between kuroko
was also
the point of the volume
well yeah
Well Aleister || did say he wont interfere with accel, but he will crush magicc||
if he was up during the mess
or done
i wonder what would have touma said
yeah indeed
CONFIRMED AGAIN
BEST DOGGO
BTW
hamazura? nah he wont
even the twins, no matter how many people they murdered, they didn't deserve that
fucking kiharas
the android girl final part made me so sad
i was suffering as i was reading
That volume is sick
high five
gt03
ooooooooo
his creativity never fails
yeah
to go full bratty
tho that doesn't excuse, nor allow her
it's not even her fault
it's relatable
regarding the reason why she can't eat meat
#nadia

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
as in kawada mami?
they recovered the arc they broke by cutting it in s1
it was good
i watched the episode
a bit better.
wait bad video

good*
it's very goot
they freaking got me.
they got me.
WORLD TRIGGER 2 QUALITY
SHIT
HOLY
based on the rank
the members are **paid on a regular basis**
Border is a para-military organization not a fuck all clown fiesta
it was an emergency
just for the invasion
they give it him back
It's omitted there
YES
i guess
they can be watched alone without checking any timeline
i usually reccomend those 2
or 00
like Iron blooded orphans
yeah
rofl
i'm telling you that
that's exactly why
which is old.
because eeeh, uc means 0079
but with something from the standalone timelines
to not start with main timeline
tho i suggest
**BITS EVERYWHERE*
QUBELEY
hold on
but this was GOLDEN
i disliked the whole ep
<@!782841825069236236>
AHAh
holy hell it was so bad
the freaking flash on megane-kun glasses
the op hints they've fixed
oh and hype
yeah...
features re-drawed scenes from s1
oh and the opening
by the last episode
that was left damaged
is that they've fixed the arc
and the great part
yeah
unexpected honestly
lol
was a very big leap
yeah the jump in quality
as we were talking yesterday

instead of him
using atlanteans
yeah i can see them pulling some Embryo-like shenanigans
to continue srw
can't wait
how it fits in SRW
makes me understand
and this last arc
goes brrr
big plot exploding in the last episodes
holy shit, this anime goes off with a boom
nadia ep 37
i just watched
https://anilist.co/staff/123661/Rui-Tsukiyo
i looked up Kaiyari author.
hold up
and i can easily see, as i said before today, how they would implement this in SRW, it got all the right screws to fit
so yeah it was worth
and sanson marrying || marie || made me laugh
it got pretty solid flaws but it's so good when it goes in the great parts
i'm going to give this anime a 7.5/10
tho the third fourth of the anime is just debatable
the ending arc
just wow.
i finished nadia

the golden days
recalling
i was
Mal scores are always bad as an indicator
It went off a tangent with " 2 girls on a screen are better than one"
This reminds me a certain vn talk
Rofl
That's a bit worse
Goddamn it
No pls did they really censor it?
Nearly 10 am here
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Well i am usually be asleep during the time you were talking
Okay okay
Ah the usual?
Or <@161155855524298752> someone plz just tell me what was the topic, i am just curious
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<@676272618839605249> ?
Pesky evil people
What are you hiding
What what
I liked fmab a lot
Is it on a nanatsu failure level?
Mha
This reminds me how overrated is
Me and carol agree on something
Yeah
I will give 7.5 to sigururi
It has one of the worst pilot arc that i have seen
After  ep 4
Sigururi gets great
People please do realize that romance can be secondary
Including his sister in the harem
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667>
With pink haired girls
Right let's just go back and appreciate some good rakuen project, yuki rito and his endless harem
~~where is /a/~~
God
Only after having voted
I check anilist vote just to see how much i agree/disagree with the average
I watch what i want nowadays anyways, so who cares
On the less popular shows they tend to be a tad bit neat-er
That's why i said to exclude completely the top 100
I sometimes happen to match what happens
I gave 7 to gear s1
Is it tho?
Tho i think that anilist votes are a bit better
The thing goes into the trash on the high tier anime
Tho that doesn't mean they're always wrong
You reduce 1000 ep down to 250-300
To plot follow conan
It's entirely possible
That
Also thay
Case closed for your muricans
Ep 994 aired last week!
Conan is longer
Oh yeah i loved magi a lot too
Or even the upcoming eden's zero
Or how i followed fairy tail to the end
Like world trigger with its antishonen protag shenanigans
I just follow a few of them since i grew attached to them
Fma was meh
they got surprised
i managed to brute force through parrots in some rare case
that sadly happens
parroting is always an option
That pops out
Where is the flat is justice guy
It's culture

THE TERRORIST CAMP BOY
GIVE ME
*slams hand on the table*
it gets rejected for a valid reason
there was a problem in what he proposed
Eins did not propose a simple welfare
Again
I'd ask the same question to the title of duke, the round table is an assembly made of Guild Masters
because Eins is too much "generous"
btw Honesty became filled with Leechers
what eins did is no different from a golpe
that's not exactly what we call welfare, but i wont discuss on this matter since it's not the time (2 am) nor the place
Eins is kinda hypocritical at this point^
||When the server is attacked by the Eternal Moths, Eins uses this situation to push the Round Table towards focusing more on returning home than making life in Theldesia comfortable, something that Shiroe viewed to be an omen. The moment the Round Table receives a report that the source of the Eternal Moths is the Genius Taliktan, who has transformed the radio tower in Shibuya into a dungeon, Eins falls into his chair in shock and horror.||
but anyways
and shiroe explained to him the flaw
he wanted to redistribute what the wealthy players had
he wasn't supporting just welfare
He went a bit more far than that
it was not a simple welfare
Eins went a bit extreme.
eeeeh lank
but how he acted is not rightful at all
i mean i see that his point is not invalid
no noble rank in the round table.
plus He went against what they decided in the previous seasons
well the fact that || minami is trying to take over akiba || is well estabilished
Shiroe || meets Eins || in secret
after the ending?
the 2nd ep part
or have you skipped
the thing will just over-plottwist
look i'm 95% sure
the problem is a bit more complex as is explained in 2 episodes non stop
i don't see your point as a flaw tbh
and got rejected
he proposed something that went against the whole round table
since s1
but the guy was spotted
and log horizon is 75% politics
there's no bad or good in politics
As i always say
AGAIN
MARIELLE HAS DECENT HAIR
OH <@!238855496797257729>
so i expect lots of talks
it's 1 volume stretched in 12 eps
keep in mind lank
hm?
btw i've plunged a bit into a dark spot today, i've given a go to Emergence/Henshin/Metamorphosis (hentai stuff, a friend linked it to me), just to see how cursed and deep the well was, and... well how to put it, it's just a really sad story, really nothing else to comment about it.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
at this hour millhi.
my brain is going slower
i failed to catch the pun
i'm half asleep
Nnnnn
LMAO
TRUE
AH
*toumapunch*
sorry to shatter your dreams
loris
tho database was better
ofc detabeis is still the best
i've come to appreciate the new op
the thing is escalating *dramatically*
log horizon 3 is going brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
anyways
i'm having a good time
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
watch and you will see
she's okay
it's okay
it's decent
The new animation is like a merge
like this
she's okay
<@!238855496797257729>
https://puu.sh/H9q2L/b471ce206f.png
gimme a sec
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
as usual
Sunrise godlike animations
new trailer?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJ51sNNkqU
i spoke the truth, want a screenshot? lol
but in the context and by wrong execution
but i'm really sure that the thing was just wrong, not by concept
the ep of that proposal
i actually need to rewatch
what can i say lank, opinions?
during the round table reunion
it-s in ep 2 you get to see fixed hair
barely appears in ep 1
marielle
wtf are you saying
is it bad?
i have this in my planning
oh
hm
the anime is airing
i have to watch that
tensei mil?
Mushoku
#bronzeage
"What are you saying using iron for weapons is a waste"
and gets treated like an holy prophet
he's bland
it has no intro, the mc keeps upgrading the isekai civilization tech by researching crap from wikipedia
i freaking dropped this
https://anilist.co/anime/101289/Hyakuren-no-Haou-to-Seiyaku-no-Valkyria/
go for it lank
i need to remember
give me a min
oh yeah
from my 400 anime-long list
i recall just like one isekai i really disliked
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
for me isekais are something you keep craving
oooh don't worry
i'm the log horizon type of guy who gets hyped on big brain masterplan and politics, or gets enchanted by worldbuilding
in the end
depends on what you search
each isekai has its own perks
of  course
oh yeah fz
i will only say that i liked asterisk so much that i bought the physical novels
the discussion is rendundant
but millhi is right
i snapped at stella
eh i didn't cry for rakudai
ASTERISK IS BETTER
PLS
since well, || in s2 we got confirmation that's not a cyberspace but a full fledged isekai ||
tho they were right in not using database
but database was just better
look it's decent
i don't see why i shouldn't like it
i liked tate no yuusha
yeah ofc mass produced crap exists
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
even a battle school harem
whatever can be surprising and good
for being an isekai
i don't point at an anime
haven't watched that one
nor evil, nor good
but he's empty
are just wholesome.
oh and the girls that follow the mc
and that's nothing special compared to what the mc visits after
most biggest worldbuilt thing in the anime is the dungeon with the elder litch
so of course yeah
to show the worldbuilding
the anime doesn't do enough
plus some encounters are fun
in the worldbuilding
the author got really lots of creativity
reading the WN
mil i've halted but i was
.
"I'm gonna be a tourist doing whatever i want"
too bad the plot and the mc are meh
is Death March
for the worldbuilding
one isekai really really hit me
to my planning
adding them
or the original material lies in other media?
i mean, are their source the manga
both mangas fenny?
s e n g o k u
i agree
Well that was unique
it's a cover.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adXfl3KRa88
if it was made more recently
this is what Men of Destiny would have been
<@!782841825069236236>
*neppu shippu saibusta*
!
Masaki exists
Ofc mel
in their cartridges
but it's the best shot they have
eeeh
and lol
a parallel world plot would work by the way
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
wtb norse rei back
they're always so smart in these things
can make it
i'm sure bandai
on nobunaga's feud
a colony
how do we drop
oh you mean
with the cybuster
Masaki breaking in
i can already see
for SRW shenanigans
is like perfect
mel the setting
they did lots of stuff
log horizon macross
legit
LOL
sadly
eh i imagine
for an srw
than nadia could ever hope to have
has more fitting points
that series
- Nobunaga.
the main point
you're forgetting
ofc solo
free lore for bandai
it has even the 2 worlds thing
it would fit perfectly
even in SRW
I think that stuff would be good
is in that freaking anime
Even Da Vinci
absolutely yes
i could not stop laughing at the guy snipeing katana wielding footsoldiers
IT WAS SO GOOD
HAHAHA
<@!279341087494242304> THAT ANIME
gets good.
Rezero S2
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FnsUGdMKm4
<@!279341087494242304> tfw you mention azi-dahakara and i flashback || mondaiji novel final boss ||
i will finish X before i attempt anything else
of course
https://anilist.co/anime/1603/Super-Robot-Taisen-OG-Divine-Wars/
is it bad or good?
za inspector
Would it be a wrong move to try and watch SRW OG anime?
(more than him, it's the concept of La Gias that's just outstanding)
it's a bit sad you know
ok
well X
i get what you mean
dw
i'm joking mel
and not a tasteless unanonymous one
it explains her past and lets you understand that she's actually a good character
or you wont understand emilia fully
is required
oh plus memory snow special
rezero 1 arose
they're answering all the questions
it was not supposed to be divided
it's because it is supposed to be packed with the second half
bit by bit
but that's just the plot taking its time to unveil itself
sure it has some low points
i'm enjoying it so far
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
by Rayneshia popularity
what i expect is them winning the|| democracy poll||
Shiroe admitted the faults
ehhh not really
with the Eins deal
log horizon went in another whole direction
<@!278860841485598720> did you see?
Ty
Sauce?
as long
just meh
with the bad guys
twintails gave me a bad time
lmao
piece of wood
this is my take
Regarding heroines, if you end up having too many of them; well, it's gonna be a pain to chardev them
Trinity Seven does this last point good, while the worst point is Ichika
a decent mc.
and most important
it's all in not falling into stereotypes too much and have some creativity about the plot
like it's possible to make good isekais and good battle school anime
btw it's possible to make good harems
but yeah sun is just too much great
poor lunar
lmao
ye it's barely
sun chan ~
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW-NLTpkedI
did somebody say good harem?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
why did they call Asterisk War, "Gakusen Toshi Asterisk" in s1
nowadays i still ask myself
*asterisk*
!
once again
it's time to point out my fav battle school harem
D:
on people
stop pushing nisekoi
yeah it-s still an harem
on the mc
still try
but Rumia and Re)LL
my bad
on this one
yeah you're right
hm
thus fail the adaptation
to never continue
the source
but hey, let's go original and ditch
btw the interesting one was Rokuaka
i heard misfit anime fails a bit
key in a nutshell
but have 400 completed
i'm a slow burn on anime
everything has been over for ages
i watched only s1
i haven't finished it
x_x
thanks
stop spoiling
but the LN and the VN
is not the animation
the strong point with Date a live
as i know
it's not laura's fault, it's ichika's!
ghhh
BODEWIG
LAURA
finally you pulled out culture
is great
Yamada kun
oooo
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
oregairu
how to waste money and a good series.
and i'm still mad about hidan no aria aa
+ great heroines
+ aggressive tsundere
+ decent mc
+ twisted plotline
+ ongoing
*Hidan no Aria*
but the LN is just <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
and does that decently
that tackles the harem genre
there is one anime
were popular 10 years ago
Aggressive tsunderes
so much
but i disliked the redhead
i liked Toradora
i disagree
MUV LUV
with
but first i gotta get back on track
i will play the VN someday
Grisaia is indeed good
it's unique
no downtime.
it stays that way.
but once it goes huge
it takes a good 9 episodes to go huge
DRRR is just wow
celty!
the good dullahan i know is || https://i.pinimg.com/564x/13/d2/ea/13d2eafbe8b2e646b8f5c74fe661bf4e.jpg ||

plz
I REMEMBER THIS
LOL

<:Ver:704169051391524875>
the action duel shenanigans
comes from people who disliked
<@!401523822412431371> btw last word, much of the hate vs arcv
than the anime
it seems to go in a whole different plotwise direction
is ArcV manga
what i have to read someday tho
plus it has waifus in it
not t1 sure but still great and fun to play
great archetype
i used to play melodious
true
yeah

she's actually useful
yeah
tho Yuzu is a good heroine
freaking yuya
lexi for the first time, i hard disagree
come on.
he pulls out constantly "Egao"
it suffers greatly because of the main character
as in card-fied
where people actually "Die"
Arcv plot is good, it pulls out a dimensional war
and destroyed zexal building.
a sea of desperation, a door that closes
https://youtu.be/9HVlBhX8d7M?t=15
Zetsubou no umi, tojiru tobira
the opening 5 pulls out a || "Zexal failed" ||
ArcV had to kill Zexal to stop it in the tracks
than arcv
<@!401523822412431371> no pls, zexal is way worse
but that's not why i posted the pic
look i don't know
*looks at red*
this art.

looking at my art anime related
i was
the powercreep was already fucked up
Phanta, you're telling me that unchaining Fusion, Synchro and XYZ from links was a bad move?
even if it wasn't enough
they did tho
y
i agree
are still unplayable
but pendulum
that's why konami itself recognized the mistake
it was a disaster
ye back then yes
it was overruled
you're outdated
not anymore
no
don't require link
Fusion, synchro and XYZ
no, they fixed that
Konami tried to fix them, it somehow worked but it still destroyed the whole pendulum deal
goddamn links
rip
just because they had to use him as comic relief
losing twice out of pure bs
in arc v
**NEO NEW SAWATARI**
the poor
that reminds me
uuuh
that sucks
ugh
Yami lost like twice
but iirc
i don't remember that
that's really important
yes
coughs *passionate duelist* coughs
so i can't really judge him
Vrains yet
I didn't watch
i found it funny
Fuwanovel commited suicide
reminds me the way
the way mangarock suicided
mangarock killed itself
of course there wasn't the fansub vibe we got nowadays
if not, shortly after
IRC
since it still supports
a thing in 2004
i think this was already

exist in 2004 already?
did tokyotosho
hm
i download the whole pack and delete it when i finish
of course in batch cases
more or less this is what i do
i don't find it useful anymore
i used to save stuff but
just coz i'm more comfortable without any weird issue
i download everything i watch then delete it
i discovered it the last month
it's pretty solid
lists anime torrents too

and it's the most chardevved character
of an Antihero character
Accel is one hell
Rerolling character development is boring.
Accelerator is a "failure" for one reason
but still
i don't remember
or 13
since she doesn't really do much before NT12?
but shokuhou has much story space
(that's also the reason that will make railgun go into a new direction)
Railgun follows main novel hand to hand from a side view+unique events
It ALL depends what the manga will tell
in main novels
Misaki Shokuhou has the same relevance as mikoto
well that's only natural
ok
Astral Buddy?
mental out manga or are youy talking about
hiroyuki sawano san?
and am i hearing
the CGI in the PV
SHIT
HOLY
i will watch it
86
oooo
they were so freaking great
**facial expressions**
in the last ep
i really enjoyed
OH there is one thing
SFX Openings always greast
PLS
FIGHT ME
BEST GIRL
AZUZU
OH
and enjoyable
but it was still decently delivered
mil
i agree with you
can't blame who does that
a friend of mine did the same
you stopped one ep before it gets actually serious
yeah basically
i'm sastisfied
and it goes off with a loud boom
it just starts as something that i would give no more than 5
it gets increasingly good after ep 4
solid 8/10
finished sigururi
i just
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
https://puu.sh/HdSIR/ec9bd3ad04.png
into oblivion
time to meme this
claudia song is great
oh well
LOL
plz

millhi not agreeing with me
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
no thanks, it got better exactly because it embarked the serious tone, otherwise it was a direct trip to my dropped list
it's the lowest point
is exactly ep 4
the swimsuit ep
again i gave 8/10
yeah
She regains points in the last episode but it feels rushed
as a character
and hollow
Claudia feels empty
except for one little detail
and the show really makes you feel empathy for the heroines
i enjoyed it

<@!782841825069236236> <@!99695384296701952> this came back
imho
so no it's not an ideal start
what's going on
0080 needs you to understand
then watch everything in chronological order
no questions asked
08th or 0079
i would straightfowardly say
into UC
to kickstart someone
if i have
Trump founding space forces
I TOUGHT WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS
IDENTICAL THING
IT'S THE SAME
LOL
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
EFSF when
Okay mel
but it's still dope
Yeah i agree that s2 goes into a weird route (after a rewatch)
is the early UC that is foot grounded
well more than 0079
MSG
y
even more than 0079
is that how realistic and "how fuck this can entirely happen in the near future" vibe it gives
the amazing thing about 00
one
Uverworld
2nd best for me is ash like snow
00 s2 op 1
00 opening is Hakanaku mo towa no kanashi
my fav
00 ops
my god
mine was to tank through 0079 right after watching 00
but each of them will have its outcome
that can work
but several ones
there's no right answer
FZ in this case
it actually pumps in buildup into 0079
i forgot about that
now that i think of it
Origin is also a good start
ah ah

oh yeah thunderbolt could be decent as a start too

i love the hildorf
PLZ
AND HILDORF
ok
in origin?
being pointed out
isn't that a point
Zeon got MSes before EFSF
uh canonically
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/677/286/ab5.png
can i have some examples?
hm?
that it just sounds canon
because it connects so well
I want you to explain this point to me now
WHY
and the female mc is just a great character
it's just well written without falling into stereotypes
wholesome but actiony fantasy romance!
i RECCOMEND THAT TOO
AKAGAMI NO SHIRAYUKIHIME
goddamn fumina konoe
is entirely original
plus half of s2
that put offs the spectator
and it expands immediately
They restricted the content in s1-s2 but they didn't in s3
it makes the only legit season (s3) weird
resides in how they've adapted it
SnS only problem
it's also really iconic of mid 2000s
great
really
really
it's
SnS
adaptation
it's a weird ass
sns3!

THAT SCENE
AHAHAHA
i got angry
at ep 18
after story
with a 9
i fiercedly dropped
someday i will watch the others
and i enjoyed it a lot
frontier only
i watched
as for the platform we would have to think of something
we could vote
the good old group watches
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the reason because this channel exists
we should relive
i was thinking
he did not break the rule
but that's my opinion
i think you are overreacting
he was fine even by losing
shiroe did not want to win on all costs
second point || eins would have resigned even if he won ||
Villain With Glasses is both a joke, both the truth
for the whole thing.
and stays as such
He starts as an *Anti Hero*
Shiroe is not an hero.
by a very far long shot
misunderstanding shiroe
You're drastically
calm down
No one
and more politics
it-s freaking good
and eins did not get demonized
i liked the way the deal ended
<@!278860841485598720> did you watch log horizon?
it's still nice to exchange opposite opinions
)and don't worry us not agreeing is normal)
go for it then
ok
if lank wants
we will continue there
i was about to say that
ye
i did end up spoiling a bit
shiroe just made so that the gate could be used
plus i don't see the hting you call corruption
by spreading rumors and such
it was showed
plus the other party did do its part to undermine
For what i think he's not more guilty than Eins is for his attempted golpe
He had a very specific plan
the other parties agreed to those.
Lank Shiroe wrote the rules

Rakudai-Asterisk-Bladedance
it's in the triad
Asterisk war is debated because
round and chrome?
what
sure
it shares the "magitech" concept with some others LNs of the same era
hmmm i don't see the generic part in the scifi look
but i loved how they pulled it off in this case
of course that's a visited and reused setting
i mean the generic part is the battle school setting
hmm i don't fully agree on the generic part
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and nothing else.
the only shot you get is || julis in underwear ep 1/chapt 1 ||

That reminds me

(partially)
and it's all fueled by FA's attitude

that's actually a lie, he persists

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLwHYn5KrsM when you spot a great cover 
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
that happens to be also a mecha.
IS is an **harem battle school**
amiya
at IS from the wrong tags
You're looking
they just go downhill because of their harem shenanigan with the idiot
but
(laura ftw)
Look the harem girls are even acceptable
ichika
goddamn
depends
uh
indeed
it's not rare for people from nortern italy/austria/switzerland border area to have italian names/surnames
Testarossa
and her surname is also italian
italian name
Teresa.
it's actually
but if you look at katakana
is Teletha (localized) Testarossa
her full name
Basically tessa is from switzerland/austria area
the author went BIG BRAIN
i did some digging about Tessa
You know
Aaaaa
TESSA
but if they go down the route of making the s2 in the future
last vol is vol 10
since then
the hospitals
Apparently he's been going in and out
No one invests in a on hiatus LN
since 3 years ago.
the author has not released any new volume
because
i wont
oh
rofl
i read several LNs
calm down
i'm reading NGNL
rn
On hold
myself
i was memeing
no i wasn't talking about you
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well till next volume and if i'm not reeled in by anyone i wont start
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
admit it
You're just missing a pretty good long index discussion
it's self sustained
like a power armour
it's more an exoskeleton
Do not think it as a mecha
servos
uh amiya
holy shit Yuuji is less bad than he seems after the s2 big filler
btw i'm rewatching Shakugan no shana lately
btw
when IS was released
keep in mind the historical era
not something i will attempt reading
this time
i don't know about the LN
^
no exception
It's not laura herself being dumb it's that the whole Harem is dumbed down
god freaking damn it
but S2
iirc
i've given it a 7
Look IS s1 was something that kept me entertained
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and while i liked it, it's something i cannot say it's okay
s2 goes super robot indeed
it's too real basically
The superstrenght point of 00 s1 is how relatable to reality it is
it's yours fav
what are you saying
i will make a better photo of it later, can't take the volume on my hand rn
ending
he was talking about one specific
Sora talking || shit about drakengard ending || in a nanosecond
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
many good references
plus the author is cultured
since it's pretty good
it's a bit of a shame
the ln is enjoyable
plus even with these shenanigans
so it's fine
it's Ecchi
.
and || Succubi and Mermaids are there ||
Sora is just a degenerate
lol
than the s1
i think it will need even more censorship
where are you from
isky you're US right^?
^
well enough joking
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
there's no brexit
but in that timeline
of the **ADVANCED** European Union
wont be part
that means britain
Oh right
irl AEU when?
isky
Geopolitics go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
that's all i will say
but 00 s1 and 00 s2 are different balls of the same box
for people who never touched gundam
and it's one of the nicest spots
00 is good
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
yessssss

No wait
but well sure fine if you-re not interested, but i would just completed Early UC timeline to get the whole picture
https://puu.sh/Hnet7/7a0f196a0c.png
early UC ends after unicorn
Unicorn is still Early UC
otherwise it just doesn't work
the mainline titles that come before it
if you watched
well i reccomend unicorn anyways
AD > || solar energy deal || > || EF || > || Solar energy fails || > UC and we can see the|| remnants of the ring/space elev around earth in unicorn ||
basically AD is set in a way where it would connect if considered UC prequel
since things just do not match
i have a theory, but it's whacky

i was talking about this with my friend
that ended copyright with previous studios
btw many of the new seasons that are getting announced is stuff
oh yeah
and not divided in 2
of 24 eps
but i think somehting went amiss because it was supposed to be a full cour
i liked both cours
i know dw
we got the full cake
exactly
eh
but it was incomplete
i did
plus || she was being manipulated by "Neeeeeeeeeeee" Roswaal ||
her problem was her not having impact and her lack of background
i enjoyed the part where they unveiled || Emilia's Past ||
is a wild ride
well i think this cour
And explains haman's bg
It fills a gap

btw HF1 official subs
sad that this wont be surely in the movie

so i can praise || dark sakura ||

heaven's feel3 !

chad ending
i will not get
but in the end
i might watch aniplex subs
but if feedback is acceptable
i am waiting for a fansub
sorry for ping
or not?
<@!152896851660505088> did you watch HF3 with aniplex garbage subs in the end
or wait
btw i am waiting
it's neat
but they dropped it with lostbelt
it was a good system imho
same case
^
idk why it dropped the idea
which sent the fanbase into overdrive to figure out if he was really columbus or juan de la cosa (santa maria original owner)
for example Columbus was "Rider of Resistance"
all the servants true names were under story lock
with 1.5
at some point
you know fgo did that
you gonna get spoilors
it's the same issue with starting fateverse with FZ instead of FSN
i understand your POV but it couldn't be helped
with all the riders?
blame fgo
yeah but can you really
since the vn
well we knew she was|| medusa||
that's what led to the issue
FSN rider?
as in
what i really want from hf3 is
but yknow mil
is so rad
that scene
that's why i haven't blasted myself yet
i have a group watch planned
i will watch by myself
it's enough
again
look
i am sad about that
rip
y
well that was to be expected
ah
**life approaches the imperial villa**
i don't want to prejudice
when i watch it
we will discuss it
ok ok don't say it
removed???
GUTTED as in??
WAIT
H I G H
L I N E R
S P A R K S
with the rad ending that i will never get
fixated
i am the one
well you know
kk
i had to shut off.
i did that with HF2, at min 5 i was cringeing so strongly
what do you mean
wait or not wait for subs
i am torn
so yeah
LOL
stomped
GET
LANK
saving stuff is panicc
what i watch
but yeah i download and then delete
or to go straight for it?
for a fansub
do you suggest to wait
YOU'RE INSANE
btw LANK
bad sub or good?
mil
how was it
WAIT
But we got 5g now
For that
Well the town is just not equipped
4 g was unusable
on itself
the poor town that hosts it was imploding
were the double of it.
that the free visitors
till you realize
the number seems nothing
in 2019 had the peak of 270k paid visitors
italy's Lucca Comics is huge
i meant worldwide
with us
i don't remember who is the other con that competes for the second place
so japan obviously
Comiket is the first
skyhigh numbers
for a reason
look italy holds the 2nd/3rd biggest anime/game/comic convention of the world
we got shit like made in abyss dubbed in italia iirc
and the list is pretty long
we get anime waves or "impacts"
but yeah
sakura ❤️
it's in "Waves"
here depends
like fmab, blacklagoon, trigun and some others
and they aired great stuff too
nonstop
it lasted 10 years
it was so great
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

i started watching anime back in 2006
but they know how to get their shit right

i planned to watch it there first and then watch jp sub eng
that cinema dub ita got cancelled
i am a bit sad
i will watch garbage subs
so if by the 5th is not out
but i already stated that i wont wait for more than 2 days
i wont die waiting more
and i waited till now
this
lol
it will just look weird
after having cut her out the route almost entirely
how the movie handles the illya deal
i am curious
my top hype moment after sparks
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
|| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptblgobdvXA ||
and they're decently detailed in the thing
he's a gun nerd
SAOAGGO author yeah
i have complaints.
watching HF3
i just finished
by the way
10/10
that's not my point
oh that's completely ok
that fz is like that
it's because of urobuchi
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
urobutcher kills animals
Exactly
or adapted
because how the thing is written
apart from that duo
fate zero characters are hard to really like
eh, i also hate him but he's more human than many characters in the fateverse
he just feared || death so much || that led him to do what he did
zouken is old as || da vinci || would be
you understand he can only be pitied upon
but after you've finished the path
Zouken is the only one you start hating
it's a cut interlude
this part is not in the movie
like he didn't exist anymore
|| he was fully pampered till the day sakura came at matou residence, when he found out what they did with her, they completely started ignoring him (he was still a kid) ||
but he's still unforgivable
he has reasons, he didn't spawn like that
it's just to let you understand the hell was the poor girl living in
btw that scene loris
piece of crap shinji.
he doesn't deserve it after all
but it's legit they didn't
the movies didn't explain why he's like that
i hated him to the core
fuck shinji
shinji.
ah
in hf2
there's no such thing
ok then i remembered right
it's not in the vn
|| are we sure that scene is not original? ||
i didn't remember it
the squish part
oh you know
it was unknown to anime only
YES
in the ending
the soul covering sakura
haha funny addition
it's pretty good
absolutely
oh yes
i entirely agree with you
^
is exclusive to sparks
i also remembered that the full chant of nine lives
but it was bound to these consequences
the film is okay
it's just a light show without giving bg
eeeh
they || didn't even explain the 2nd vs 3rd true magic scene ||
but i can relate about 6-7 for the story
i still enjoyed it
it couldn't be helped in 2 hrs
but i understand that they did what had to be done
several of them
till someone goes full SEIGI NO MIKATA/SAKURA NO MIKATA
ufo going in Nine Budgets
saber vs rider was just wow
while it's really long
resolved too quickly
That too
any other one will fail.
that scene can have only one ost.
i am sorry
felt empty
but || Rin vs Sakura ||
in that movie
went brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
btw yuki kajiura
*cool i approve, they're canon now*
*Look nasu-dono, we made this*
*laughs in overedge*
i fell on this
god
we sure?
uh?
plus no sparks = no nine lives fullchant
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
imagine if the movie went down sparks and ended it there
just for the sheer awesomeness
sparks
btw i went to re-read
random reaction: "OH LOOK THE GUY ON KALEIDO CE"
*squish*
"Tf how rin did get out from the trial at london?"
if i sit on the movie only
omitted
btw nice how zelretch was nearly completely
in b4 sparks
freaking prillya
"but but prillya movie!"
butts in
where is the part of where the random prillya fan
idk
LOL
rly
and create others
some issues
it would solve
eeeh
<@!279341087494242304> now that FSN has been fully adapted, it's time!
*Fate HOLLOW ATARAXIA* 
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i reccomend it
are solid
Chaika both seasons
the chonk of the scene is a monologue
from the VN
i've re-read that part
Yeah
was underwhelming
||Nine Lives ||
but he can't access UBW
LMAO i didn't think it
LOL
pls what
no i'm not getting you
my brain went like "i am sure touko thought something"
"Can shirou mana transfer in that form?" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
was asked to me from a friend
There is one question
whereas in true || his soul gets heaven's feel'd || and materializes
as core requirement
normal ending has || shirou not surviving ||
lol
where
they didn't tho
pls
in a row
it killed me thrice
don't mention the normal ending
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
you mean
Sparks
so good
i am gonna replay that scene in the VN, i still have my unlimited saves works
thus upscales the scene
of an impact
but it has an hell
and stupid
something trivial
It may be
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I AM ANGRY
CONTINUOUSLY
THEY ROBBED ME RIN CHANTING GIBBERISH GERMAN
RIGHT
rihgt
it was still good mind you
i appreciated it more in the source
dunno
so fucking great.
whereas in the VN i was costantly overhyping
weak in the movie
|| kirie eleison || felt
Oh right
kirei character
it would have damaged permanently
if they were going to cut it out
they were cutting it out
i really feared
but still
i fixed
ye mb
when|| his wife died||
what he felt
that kirei explained
A LOT
btw i appreciated
TRUE
But hey, each its own
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Dodging prillya like no tomorrow
Then there is me
no respect
poor angra
btw i appreciated that they took their time and explained || angra ||
go nasu, drag ufo around and let em make it
but yeah where is F/HA animu now
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
SORRY
OG EXPERIENCE SOLO
NO
Lol
without overdoing like he did in ft
hiro handled him in a proper manner in the manga
|| happy is not an organic being ||
plus again, hiro learnt part of his mistakes
EZ works out a bit differently
while still remaining a battle shonen
by the artstyle
baited
don't get
i think that hiro mashima fixed part of his mistakes he did with fairy tail
see? nice
how was it fz?
i will wait for proper airing
well i dunno
they've released a preview
https://puu.sh/HvwDI/af23fe4d7b.png
actual ep 1 isn't out
a preview fz
but that's
come on ufotable couldn't pull out a much hilarious note in their bg than that
i chuckled at that scene
NOW THAT I THINK ON IT || young sakura and young rin PLAYING FREAKING POKER ||
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
shady it may have been they did their job
Look kissanime did the job of holding up old shit
Abandonware
let's not forget these old anime that would be considered
*coughs in crunchyroll*
as long the anime industry is not avaiable in the west without having to fight with crappy deals
rofl
but but i'm faithful to my sengoku jidai
solo?
more romance of the three kingdoms
!
or blue rays
i think that supporting the creators = buying source/merch
souten kuro?
lol
even
taiga lists the torrents
the same thing that Taiga does
ah
?
brrrr
https://anilist.co/user/Cypher05/animelist my list
infact
i use anilist
*Waits for the day where mal will reinvent the whole interface*
!
Eden's zero
lol
that's my log
in that case
spring? still nothing
https://puu.sh/HvDF8/5d0e5d57cf.png
winter i've watched several
winter_
or
spring
which *THEORETICALLY* works out of the box
if you want i can link old version
wow.
but on some stuff it's just .
rn i am at the point where i just don't care if it's in 30 or 60
but then my eyes adapted
i had an hard time the first times
it's a matter of being used tho
expecially on stuff like heaven's feel
to interpolate
you need a mid-end pc
Be aware
new version works but you have to tinker to make it work
which uses MPC
i use an old version
Smooth Video project
imagine the rider || vs saber || scene but in 60 fps
it was something otherworldly
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i did it with HF3 solo
*interpolation brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*
on some anime
emulating 60 fpses
and i love
i don't watch streaming
^
btw
9anime replaced kissanime's job
in that case just repeat.
and skips stuff
and watch out the setup sometimes fail
do install included MPC

<@!430379754190012426>
gets a vs in that volume.
even mikoto.
btw bare example since i don't think you will read the source || in one volume NT 10 to be precise, he fights everyone he knows, the whole world, just to save one person ||
infact it's a common discussion that touma gets shittalked by who hasn't read the source
but just know he's not what he's been showed
and as anime only you're right
what you're trying to say
but yeah i understand
|| "rip" touma ||
and reality slaps him hard
but it doesn't work that way
really he forces his ideals onto others
tl;dr touma is a bad person and an extreme hypocrite
since these feathers wrecked his brain apart
but he wont be able to anyways
he is scared of knowing who was before the memory loss
he knows people he doesn't remember to know
which is why touma is so confused
these memories are gone forever
it's not amnesia
*d e s t r o y e d b r a i n c e l l s*
the doctor said it squared.
that's misinterpretation
really
Uh no
in one volume
and backfires in a nuclear bomb style fashion
what the entity is gets explained
it's || sentient||
touma did talk with the entity in the arm
if you look at s3 one
s3 one is the important one
s1 one has a double take
s1 or s3?
which one
at some point someone drops the bomb
no in this case there's not much teasing
thor hammer is theorized to have been imagine breaker
that still didn't get fully explained
and imagine breaker is one hell of a pivot plot point
solo explained it correctly
topping over people like guts and subaru
if he was at the top of suffering charts
there's a reason
but for example
the anime did him dirty
yes i agree when speaking of anime only touma
of what destroyed S3
examples
is one of the biggest
this anyways

tons of
de-characterization
And fucked up the events
Destroyed touma chardev
Shit adaptation
Disaster
Is a total
S3
And this is a problem that slaps touma in the ass
Anyways punching is not the solution
Because for example accelerator doesn't join him just coz he got punched once
Wait in which occasions this happens?
Hm?
Why if i may ask
Poor touma

but if mikoto gets aware she will put her mental defenses up thus shielding herself
to be fair she *can* if she tryhards and catches mikoto off guard
rofl
and the || man  she loves can't remember her ||
misaki is indeed tragic
reasoning
Legit
rofl
while doing little to no exercise
misaki has horrible physical skills due to being pampered and served all the time
lmao
in the novels she's just wow.
but haven't watched railgun 3 yet
i am also someone in the misaki gang
it's like saten, saten doesn't exists in the novels except FOR ONE SCENE where they hear uiharu talking with another girl and it's her
she's mostly railgun only
Kongou mitsuko appears like once or twice in the novels
but index author at some point joined the crew of: "Sex magic is the most powerful and direct magic"
there's not time for that
in index
no banging
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

they actively fought to || save touma ||
and it's mikoto that starts bullying her
in the novels she becomes relevant as mikoto is
rofl
(lv 5 #5, mental out)
because as anime only you should know her only from railgun
i'm just curious
back on index, what do you think about Shokuhou misaki?
but yeah question
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
along with Fate/deen and some others
category
but yeah Umineko enters the "Shit tier memeable adaptations"
i gotta read it at some point
but do not spoil me about the vn
panic
D:
a DISASTER
WHAT DID YOU DO
NOH
i can understand
eh happens
gud
arcs prob
a fucking monster
he continuously writes
Lol
the editor showed the proof
no solo it's that the author plans ahead 10 volumes
i should do the same as some point
go for it
umineko is a good reading
in 46 volumes.
6 months.
the story starts in july (vol 1 OT), the story is at the day after christmas (vol 46)
even if you actively search for one
and there's not even one plot hole
47 vols soon
and ongoing
toaru is not the average ln, it's long
i don't remember here who wrote me about starting but to whose decide to embark in that journey, keep in mind it's a long one
this leads to 3hrs long discussion of people with degrees trying to explain fantasy mechancis
since Time *is* a vector in quantum mechanics
we are scared that accel will be able to control time
he made a deus ex machina
character
to make a vector controlling
when the author decided
but major crap gets esoteric explanation
nothing more nothing less
the explanations
because they cut out
but yeah it's underexplained
lmao vectors
nothing more.
it's powerful as a bullet is
not even in a life time.
for example you know that mikoto railgun can't do that damage
perfectly
but nails down the magic part
and invents science non existant mechanics
fails science
the author is a freaking magician
kabbalah and all the shit included
and gets nearly fully explained
since all index magic system is based on IRL existing esoterism
in the tree
but yeah they dropped some heavy index lore
it's the sephiroth
mb
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Tree_of_life_bahir_Hebrew.svg
it's the Qliphoth.
the fucking tree that spawns at the end
you finished the whole anime?
she was a cool character
don't hope for her
the Necromancer is an one time shot only character
2) it's a downgrade, we have seen chardevved accel, why showing us old accel?
1) it's an introduction, you aint gonna get shit out of that
it's underwhelming for 2 reasons
being Necromancer Arc
Accelerator anime is a decent adaptation of the *first arc*
uh uh
because of the bs
the poor man is lost one year of high school
ffs
let him rest
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
well as they were having ||"Their fun" touma was in the airfield below busting his ass out||
the fireworks scene
arc in railgun_
btw you remember the daihasesai
rofl
lv 6 bad
no level 6 :<
but yeah mikoto and misaki are relevant at the same tier and both get chardev
y
that's also true
ah that
TOP
the man you || have crushes on || enters a girls changing room? || worry not misaki will cover for him by brainwashing the girls ||
but yeah tl;dr misaki best girl
another time sorry, you can't know
due to events.
let's say that a some point she spends much more time with misaki than with kuroko&friends
ye
but yeah mikoto gets along with misaki more than you think
indeed
lmao
and skipped in the plot
but instead it got put in the op
to be a scene
because it was supposed
i am facepalming so hard at the jet in the opening
a disaster
D:
THEY CUT OUT
THAT'S IN THE NOVELS DUD
OH
where she realizes that being that way is wrong
she stays as a stalker for another 10-14 volumes till her godsent chardevved volume
that's why she goes to ||russia||
and starts **stalking** touma around the world
then she gets the realization that|| she loves touma || in volume 15 (shown in s3)
mikoto for the first 14 volumes is irrelevant if not for sister arc
like
it's just
she completely dropped her tsundere antics rn
mikoto stays the same for 10+ volumes
sry
but flat character
it's not flat in that way
rofl
chardevved mikoto is top tier
and it's not the misaka you know, not chardevved mikoto is too flat
sry
misaka is not best girl
Last Order stays at accelerator side
last order?
who

since brain waves
in theory
you know that mikoto could brain control as well
accel just wants to live in peace with his little world
well he's a main character but he's mostly driven by the events
part
the "time is a scalar and not a vector"
but it seems the author is embracing
but yeah accel power is too much broken described as it is
unarmed
shaggy can beat all the evil of man in nasuverse alone
sorry
Eeh that's unbeatable
and die.
punch him
if he doesn't he will charge ahead
depends if goku knows of his ability
you can't touch him
even saitama would be
he's busted.
if madara touches accel
||(to be fair the demon exists outside the tree but she's connected to it)||
made legit contract
as bonus
he gets || a demon from the qliphoth tree||
solo dw
he's an Anti-Hero

i am closing the discussion dw
hi fz
ww3 lasted 1 week
the old testament novels close with || touma death at the bottom of the artic sea ||
END.
and i repeat NOT supposed to be there.
it's not
But yeah S3 finale is not novel finale, it's New testament opening prologue
|| the scene where they found touma at the bottom of the artic sea and saved him ||
do you recall?
but yeah
it's important
last ep
do you recall S3 closing scene?
last note
ah yes
trust me
and both for novel readers
both for anime only

but uuh i forgot
she gets involved, it got toned down

and that there's no translation of the LN that goes further than Volume 3
(last 6 episodes)
sad that the rad arc is original
a solid 8/10
i finished Mouretsu Pirates
okay
then they become a pretty cool ||duo||
yeah kinda, till they don't find a common point
mikoto bully confirmed
tfw later on it's kinda the opposite, and it's mikoto who bullies misaki all the time
and it was barely 3 volumes over 12
original content is ep 19-26
was not even full adaptation
The show
it's some shojo ai
and railgun t is the juicy part of railgun manga
is mikoto
well mikoto
i don't know why, this ed is so good

we already have **sasuga Ainz Sama**
come on.
a skeleton
but really
to the never ending bonfire
one more to add
hmm
if it keeps going on this route
for me for now would be easily an 8
86 is taking a really good path
one is cyberpunk-ish, the other is full fantasy, the other is contemporary, we got space colonies and so on
here the planets are really drastically different between each others
with some exceptions (water seven comes in my mind)
One piece setting is the piratesque, ocean adventure on islands thing
expressed myself wrongly
i think i may have
static
is
once piece setting tho
fucking scifi-space, with each planet being its own thing
also Eden's Zero's setting is really good, mashima played his cards correctly
and i'm not the type to hype over battle shonens, not in a long time.
hype.
but yeah
compared to fairy tail
upgraded a lot
i've found that his designs
to be fair
Rebecca's rival
she's the other || b tuber ||
it's her design from the manga
it's the bun
yes.
yeah

horrible.
that one is straight out

is it the one with the key
uuh
btw i fully enjoyed everything after tournament (included), and after second timeskip well, i was just in awe.
Tho alvarez empire arc anime > Manga one
which one?
in this discussion
i am not counting fairy tail's FILLERS
which is also great
after tournament there is dragon arc
let's leave there
see? it's just opposite opinion
while is one of the best arcs
we wont come down to a conclusion if you tell me tournament arc is shit
well okay each its own and let's leave at that
Lol
????
since Tournament arc happens after first time skip (tenroujima)
fairy tail upgraded after timeskip
i strongly disagree
which is only 2 times.
each time it got a time skip
Fairy tail got better
eh not really?=
but yeah fz dw that discussion
like ft one
infact EZ Happy is decent coz it's not overwhelming
no fuck happy
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
has freaking mystic eyes of petrification
that one ft character
Fuck i was forgetting
better.
Asterisk is
.
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
with me
omg mil agrees on something
**MUSCLE MEN**
ICHIYA VANDALAY KOTOBUKI!
the true hero
the absolute best
is only ONE
of ft
my fav character
BUT FZ
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Lisanna > Lucy
that was sad
oh don't startle me on that
yes
treated as || demonic abominations ||
The 3 share same past eh
(and by consequence lisanna's and elfman's)
poor girl
is Mirajane's tho
the saddest past
but i think it compares less
It is
this exists fz^

Erza's is worse than Gray, gray even resolved it
that has a painful past
she's one of the characters of the whole series
do you now?
part 1
Mashima loving its own character
||Elsie Crimson! ||
btw ep 2 of EZ showed us || Erza alterego || <:Ver:704169051391524875>
she can't see with the other so why bother
https://i.pinimg.com/originals/22/58/2a/22582a1e119f86e2e1e92c3cc4ed53e5.png
ye
some other times they forget.
only from one eye
and shows her lacrimating
sometimes the anime does that right
yeah
aren't you forgetting that one is fake?
it's just that erza is ||one eyed.||
i was like "nuh bad question"
"Why erza has her hair over her eye"
went like
lmao
he becomes buff at some point
rescued someone, survived || falling in the ocean ||
by using his knowledge
he won a freaking || naval battle ||
he starts to realize things.
but after just a few vols (halfway the anime rly)
he starts as nobu fanboy
chardev
he's got
|| till the alternate world history starts to diverge from his knowledge and he starts to panic, but he recollects himself afterwards ||
that goes to hell and back just to prevent honnoji
the MC is a chad
Nobuna's LN is really great
but putting this aside
yeah
and he even killed his brother
there's a reason if he was labelled "The Fool"
yeah
threw the ashes in the air (not 100% on this, but his mentor committed seppuku after the fact)
he made a mess at his father's funerary
hell even his start was weird
he freaking signed himself as "Dairokutenmaou" twice
nobunaga's historical profile
it's because
ah ok
evil nobu there as well?
what is that solo lol
loses a bit
Nah sengoku basara is shonen evil maou nobu
lmao solo
(the guy that gets busted at the end of the anime, is a relevant character and sticks with the story for many more vols after)
and made its own ending
sadly the anime cut it short
it's so good.
once
for the LN FanTL
i donated money
Nobuna is good culture
<@!279341087494242304> there is culture here
i am screwed.
it's him
Oh fuck
i was like
the first time i heard this OST

they finally nailed something
i wont elaborate further
they stated it
remember || "Dead Star" ||
let that arc flow.
is nothing compared to what mashima wrote before
oooh the time travel subplot
what do you mean
hm?
culture in progress, in short

Kurosaki Maon ☑️ 
Kotoko ☑️ 
Motsu ☑️
his style is just +1
*move* check
*altima* check

but everything changes in positive every time he gets put into something
he's great
*Live drastically upgraded*

why are you impressed?

hm_)
np
for android^
https://tachiyomi.org/
that sources from several sites
from mobile there is a cool app
look if you want
i halted the manga a dozen of chapters ago
well in that case have fun
hah
if it is the latter, well lmao
we don't know if the professor is "Weisz Steiner" or "Wise Steiner"
now thanks to the subs
funfact
it's almost 1:1 so far
you can keep watching
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
in 4 episodes.
4-5 times
that the crew went to the restaurant
the thing that made me laugh is
No fz
7/10 at best
Speaking of fgo i watched 🐫 ot yesterday

Ah yes t7 designs
And mashima doesn't start bs
I hope the adaptation stays on track
I am glad you're liking ez
But regret design || with witch hat|| is just <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Same
Hell even the android ||ladies and EMPino ||  are really good
Y
But she is shown in the op
Well i wont mention more about her
Like steiner and homura
Putting her aside the other characters are also nice
Whereas lucy would have played the damsel in distress role
Yes
She is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than the useless lucy
But take rebecca as example
Shiki yeah it's shiki
I slowly came to realize that early fairy tail was just a playground, but when he got serious the backlash dragged on. Ez instead is on a serious solid note from the boot
I was actually right
See
Lmao wataru
yesh
by example, try creating a folder in program files you will notice system asking you things.
it's not w7.
true adminship can't be obtained
on a normal windows 10 iso
hahaha do not be sure of that
^
i also suggest *q*bittorrent
it's not a malware by itself but since they decided to monetize it, it became unsafe
caused by the ads
it has a security issue
and yeah don't use utorret
i suggest to use revounistaller when unistalling stuff
I will investigate later but just know that's not normal
Go magnet
But in that case
That's weird
How is it possible, you're telling me it is blocking the extension?
Hm?
And friends
Add it to the exceptions of mr defender
If it is the Torrent client
Here it works
That shouldn't happen
Why windows blcks torrents?
Wtf
poor lena
i think it would devalue her giving her too much "screentime"
more valuable
that makes her
y
so she's a secondary character so far
but i like the fact that she's not in the mc party
uuh let's || honour erza scarlet || time to make || ELSIE CRIMSON ||
mashima being mashima
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
what about *elsie*
so much
i loved that part
THAT WAS GOLDEN
|| REBECCA DOGFIGHTING WITH THE SPACESHIP ||
oh and
but even him becomes acceptable as the manga goes on
there is no character i can say i dislike other than "shiki is shiki <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> "
and ALSO
g
the plot is also more solid and interestin
improvement since fairy tail
it's a really noticeable
i told you
yes
see? nb
opinion?=
thus said
that i didn't read the last 10 chapters or so
keep in mind
Holy Kingdom arc
!!!!
https://twitter.com/AnimeNewsNet/status/1390994150833762306
vs CGI
nha my point is to never have prejudice
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
let's dump it to 80%!
untrue!
it's always sad when cgi is used in a bad fashion
both maou
you can read this both as demon or magic king
魔王
so it can be misleading as a term
with the same identical kanji.
and demon king
The point on this is that you write magic king
^
expecially because of the theme
than Demon King
it fits much more the term of Magic King
I'm not 100% sure that the anime translated Maou correctly
one note about t7
Lieselotte is one of the best
The movie covers basically a part of lilith's and Akio's
the manga does cover it
the anime hasn't treated their background
tbh
His harem is really good
plus even if he made a pretty big harem, he has a ||bias towards lilith ||
and he's pretty good
but definitely he gives that Anti-Battleschoolharem protag
He's not the best character ever made
i'm on pair
he becomes so chad
in the manga
Arata is even better
Lol Glenn Radars
魔法
鬼
one of the radicals of the kanji is nothing more than the Oni kanji
ma stands both for demon or magic
it's freaking N1
it's all "Ma" kanji fault
yeah
that's all i had to say
ye dw
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but here we fall into the difference between sorcery and magic
majutsu is the synonimn of mahou
but uses different kanji as second
to say magic.
Mahou is a specific term
"ou" is ruler.
or demon
is magic.
"Ma"
carlos
mahou is magic.
maou.
no
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
in ptw
i have 300 titles
lmao
<@!782841825069236236> mb i meant bright
so time to blame bright more for not slapping his kid, || thus terrorist camp happened ||
Culture
Meiya!
i hope for a TL
😦
more
time to cry
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
REALLY?
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
So what pls
Phar keiyaru lasted 6 seconds in one scene
He needs some training from chadman9000 Rance
~~not mentioning that keiyaru has 0 stamina~~ <:Ver:704169051391524875>
If not worse
Ffs
It's 2008 level
Tbh i gave the anime a 5 but i would watch an s2 if they fixed the damn technical department
Keiyaru as|| girl ||was maybe the only legit good scene
Little note the scene with blade got drastically changed
Only the revenge ones have sense and even then only the first one is okay
The sex scenes become something akin to a fillers
The story tends to slowly go to a "normal" level
years have passed
i would have to think a lot on what would be my fav panel
good taste
and i just noticed your ppic shem
bzerk
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
i genuinely enjoyed 2017
it doesn't mean it's horrible
Just because some scenes are weird
anyways this means guts will never || leave the island ||
dark souls took a lot from berserk for example @gaming influence
^
and guts || has ptsd basically ||
|| hell caska got brain damaged out of that ||
it goes more and more brutal
expecially after golden age ends
Yes
hm yes that would be correct
but i agree with the concept
and has been fully adapted
golden age alone is 100 cpts and that would be what? 30%?
lol
10% now is exaggerated shem
oh well yeah since the adaptations do not cover the whole package anyways
of course it doesn't match the movies level
and i say this as a person that would be on pair with the manga
2016 is insulting
i think that 2017 is ok
actually fixes lots of issues that 2016 had
Berserk 2017
but if you can endure that
Berserk 2016 is a disaster, they used cgi in a wrong way and messed up the timing for osts
even if an important character was removed and makes a part of the story weird
are outstanding
the 3 movies that cover the golden age (first 100 chapters)
The first old adaptation is meh
with some weird themes
Dark fantasy
is a wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiild ride
Berserk manga
And forces is the perfect homage
Rip
lmao
in the end he's just edgy
focused on fanserviceing the main crew
Gundam Wing is really weird
Not sad
Psychological thriller
go watch higurashi
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
no memes aside, rena is a qt, but the context is what i'm pointing out

what we feel here is not the same of japanese market

but it's for the ios app
Charlie is 2021
ok no there's a derivative release
is dated in 2018
Latest Vocaloid Generation
is 2019
Last vocaloid version
i say that both co-exist
to some extent yes
but other than this, i'm not into vocaloids
note that this last one original track is a miku one, but i dislike miku's
like this one:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeiE15my2cI
and 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGoio6kSr5I
but nothing much more

yeah it's mainly that the west is not following that trend
it's a story of a murder
still gives me chills
god marie luise by lily
again, i don't follow vocaloid market neither but i'm the kind of person who likes to blob down information and keep myself updated on random things
well yeah
uuuh?
Generations have passed since the war with the Space Monsters started, and none remain who know how it began, with even records of those times being scarce.
it's in the synopsis
Generations have passed
Distant sequel
many things are just easier
just because the information you can give is so infinite
i think, out of personal experience, that LNs/WNs and VNs are the most solid source
spoilers^
ah yes grimgar's ln artstyle || https://puu.sh/HJigJ/ecaa3df165.jpg || 
so good <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
lupin is just great
those are stated by contracts
Production Rights are a bit different as a game
Public domain yes
hold up on this
IPs run out
in b4 trigger does it
uuuuh
??????????????????
Top wo nerae 3 announced????
Hold on
back in the day
i loved diebuster
but sorry anyways
not Gunbuster
i watched only Diebuster
well anyways, i am sorry in this case
i just assumed it is a distant sequel by interpreting the synopsis
i didn't intend to spoil
<@!263392442345193472> i will be short index anime is an increasingly weak adaptation, but it's still worth to watch.
That's all i have to say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5dVemhy1yk 
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
well i dunno what to say
ah now i see what you mean
meh Alicization style is not bad
graphically?
what do you mean
coz her scenes are the absolute best
the important part in Prog. is not ruining Asuna's Screentime
from the LN
well it depends how much it swerves
D:
WHY
why
No wait

No, sheryl nome is missing
but i wont spoil
putting aside the fact that the duo went to the restaurant 5 times in 4 episodes and that is still wrecking my head
it's really good and very well adapted

S2 Asuna getting half redhead-carrotlike haircolour
there is one thing that i will never forget tho
i wrote above
maou nobu intensifies
btw of female i can pretty much spot:
hanakana
taneda risa
kugimiya rie (who can't recognize her)
aoi yuuki (refer to above)
nana
and surely some others i'm missing
no sugita is not insta
Aoi has a pretty wide vocal range but it's easy to pick her up when she raises her voice
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
NAKAO RYUSEI WHERE
but yeah recognizing vas is fun. "Oh look it's HIM/HER"
depending on which
maybe easier
to recognize
female seiyuus are another ball
i ptsd in italian dub calling him **PETER RAY**
each time i read amuro
but it's a bit more tricky
oh yeah i can pretty much spot Okamoto nobuhiko
and someone else i'm forgetting
this one
nakata jouji
Kaiji yuuki
i can insta spot
There are a few male seiyuu
freaking rezo
god he's been in Slayers too
that i instaspot him
well anyways he's done so many characters
heh
*starts drifting*
ah Takahashi Ryousuke, i see i see
*plays dogfight in background*
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
*ne ne touma, oboete nai?*
for me yukachi is
yukachi?
and i didn't spot him in inosuke
for example i was watching demon slayer
it's my opinion, not the absolute truth
lol
well what can i say
*freaking petelgeuse*
but not ll
sure some roles are easier
the point is, i don't think that there's a particular hint in the voice that automatically gives him out
https://myanimelist.net/people/11817/Yoshitsugu_Matsuoka
it's kirito's
a Va that can be sightly trickier
hah i remember watching magi, and pointing out "ah it's him at work"
freaking alibaba saluja
but these are generally easy to spot
with any va
oh of course some weird gimmick can always happen
https://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuki_Kaji
freaking konekomaru from blue exorcist
Haruyuki arita
he's super easy
I said Yuki Kaiji above
i used to spot iori nomizu but she's not been that active so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Saori Hayami can be tricky to spot
btw i wasn't stating the opposite mel
but you can when she raises her voice
i can't insta
i couldn't
even if i wanted
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

things tend to happen when you're following a LN since 8 years nonstop

kenji kawai at his finest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aksRZ9K6qA8
the soundtracks

just wow, i repeat myself, this is so weirdly unique
patlabor oav ep 3

plzplz this hurts to read

<@!152896851660505088> the guys got baited into the || night realm||

Reading Grimgar vol 7

of patlabor

rofl
oh that frame
but i have to read the source now
i guess it can work if they want to end it with the next ep
yeah and they randomly timeskipped
full original
86's episode
It's been several volumes since renji got mentioned
Rofl the pocket loli
oh and if i remember correctly the anime suppressed a bit the fact that yume only talks in 3rd person

btw
yeah it's reasonable if you sit on the anime only
the whole anime?
did you watch
lmao
midgar?
So yeah, you could watch the anime and start reading vol 2 directly, it's a 1:1 adaptation of the volume 1 anyways. Nothing much was left out if not minor details and monologues
*coughs in merry*
and maybe unique
the artstyle of the LN is really particular
that pissed me off is that the adaptation changed character designs substantially
it's the start of a really painful and despair-y yet really emotional story
i found it enjoyable anyways, but the anime really doesn't give much to the watcher
Now this obviously means slow pacing
1 volume stretched in 1 half cour.
and nothing else.
are an adaptation of volume 1
i don-t remember ho wmany exatly
those 10/12 episodes
i shall speak in defense of grimgar ~

nah let-s put some jokes aside
that beeps are essential
reminding me
ah yes you tube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICOwBtm8L_s
Everything is so intense
Again author gonna kill me at this rate
<@152896851660505088> i finished grimgar v7, by the love of god, poor haru,|| he was at his direst, but he lucked out, lava everywhere||

Endless Waltz
forgetting the good part
you're
lmao
exactly
at least s1
00 is Planet earth in the near future
Wing is a meme
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Lol
gl
lmao
maybe i will retry someday, just for the sake of facepalming
all
i couldn't watch it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and god Wing is such a meme
Hey Buddy, you still alive?
than a ripoff of a gundam plotline
Aldnoah zero is nothing more
ah aldnoah zero?
AZ?
😦
i have too many reading lns
i have to continue reading it
but that's about it
i mean the avatars could be considered mecha in accel world @discussion above
Except if you lose all points in this game called brain burst, your memory gets wiped and it gets force unistalled
and the plot is not only an "Ingame thing"
they can connect and disconnect whenever they want
it's a videogame
neither mecha
neither isekai
is cyberpunk
Accel world
on my rewatch
at his scenes
I couldn't stop laughing
it starts a bit slow
it's like 1/4
and it's not halfway
that's where it gets good
nooo
best character
Colasour
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
in our timeline??
UK doesn't join ADVANCED EUROPEAN UNION
this means
HOLD ON
00: Planet earth in the near future
and the plot did its job so great into kicking the watcher feelings all the time
i liked them all
nuuuu
both are good tho
as absolute start
i think that IBO fits 00 a bit better
00 is **geopolitics go brrrrrr*
yeah people avoid that
i didn't mean to start from wing
"secondary timelines, like wing, 00, ibo"
i know
Ye ye
ofc wing is a bad start as well
any non uc gundam
i meant
lmao
calm down isky
No no
it's a military, geopolitic, real robot series
only if you start liking those go tackle main timeline
those are standalone
like 00, Wing, Iron blooded orphans
well gundam is a nice franchise to get into but, i often advise of trying some of the secondary timeline (non-UC) gundam series
rofl
well yeah, Perfect grade, high grade, master grade, real grade
the gunpla
you mean
Just think that the whole idea of the princess coming to earth to reunite, something something incident, something something lunar people
in the virtual world
Characters control avatars
not by a longshot
i think that aldnoah is decent, but again not original
to Turn A Gundam
it has really strong calls
poor haru too
also poor Merry
<@!152896851660505088> fuck ranta really || he betrayed the group ||, it's heartbreaking

😦
EXACTLY because it was full of fanservice
i dropped prillya s1
what what
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Same author
tho
great stuff
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
of its own
Durarara is an unique show
when they stand out for something
but it's a bit hard to express
Good point
(and s1 animation did it badly)
underrated but great
for example World Trigger
when they have something in particular
Battle shonen are at their best
wild guess
btw how old do you think serara is cecil?
it's just the format
nah dw
all 3 blessed
it's a Novel
it's not a light novel bruh
Depends
Overlord it's seinen tho
Log horizon: 10% cute girls, 15% action, 75% politics&economics
than band maid song
but database is better
I-m sorry cecil
❤️
^
directed
it's not age
btw log horizon is not considered a battle shonen
log horizon gang
yooooooooooooooo
<@!476058996315389953> now that i think of it. Did you stop reading FT because you heard that it gets messed up?
i will tell ya
well lank idk, when i will take a peek in the future
go watch it srsly ❤️
10/10
holy shit.
they voiced Sister Ivry
<@!202444817043685386> In EZ last episode
look it's lord millhi
(freaking mangadex plugin updating costantly)
it sources from several websites
https://tachiyomi.org/
btw if you guys want to read manga on android
in EZ mashima is tackling main plot with a more direct approach
to start
takes TONS of time
that the true plot
Fairy Tail is great but you have to put the mindset
btw lol weird stuff lank
tfw the mangaka learns from his past mistakes
is freaking doing great.
Eden's Zero
of the newest battle shonen
Ah yeah cecil
lmao
??? what is odd taxi
when talking of battle shonens
btw FMAB is another golden suggestion
it's freaking rad
a battle shonen
IS absolutely
Sengoku Basara
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
dbz
now now calling out HxH equals into calling out
yato plz
Ao No Exorcist also
btw D Gray man is another decent battle shonen
but i don't remember what
back in the day
something really ticked me off
dropped at episode 2
kekkai sensen
I disliked
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

time to also check
ooo
*JERRARU*
MASTER ZERO PLS
i preferred Oracion Seis
but not the best
it's a good arc
Tower of heaven
but it really goes on a rampage only starting in Tournament Arc
my opinion on FT is that it gets really good only starting from Tenroujima (fillers not included, ft fillers are the worst kind)
but what i can say about the last arc of the story is that the anime paces it far better and it's more enjoyable there in contrast with the manga
imho.
it's the first time i heard this statement
uh
^

Someone got JC Staff'd
GANG
HANAKANA
but i instaspot yuuki kaji

identifying kirito
i have trouble

damn alibaba saluja
Yuuki kaji pls

You wont regret
Tl;dr tackle the whole thing
Hai cecil
Shindobaddo
17 when the plot starts, 22 at the end
Chardev is pretty great for a manga
They all grow so much
While alibaba is kaji yuuki

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/magi/images/2/29/Kougyoku_Ren.png/revision/latest?cb=20120714110957
She is the second top waifu
Btw last spoiler: || best friend of alibaba, ren kougyouku becomes empress of china ||
According to the wiki morg in the plot is present at 14, 15, 16 and 19 y/o
In their tribulations
But the rest of the plot follows the protags closely
Times
It timeskips only 2
Smol but powerful morg <3
When the plot starts she is 14
When the beforementioned thing happens
She is 19
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
It's morg trauma
That scene gets recalled 2-3 times as in plot meme
Lmao
It takes years tho
|| morg marries alibaba later on ||
1 only
Care about spoilers?
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Morgiana best waifu
Also i like all the characters
|| magnostatd mages are hebrews and flying japan is <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829> || change my mind (no offence implied…)
It's just really great
I love the setting
With some minor differences
It's nearly 1:1
The anime adapts first 150ish chapters iirc
All the time
I have read the whole manga and i was in awe
Yeah i missed it when talking of battle shonen
And it's freaking amazing
The main plot it's original
Do not count on it, they share names and similarities
And while alladin, alibaba and sinbad are taken from middle eastern literature
Only then watch sinbad
Watch s1 and s2
<@318271286184771587>
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Magnostatd geographic location also matches
First pulls out some implicit hint that magnostatd is || fantasy isekaish israel, going as far to call non mages *goi* (hebrews called non hebrew people goi irl)|| then pulls out that || black thing from the sky calls it Ilah and makes it an evil god||
S2 ||final boss||
The author has been silly
In s2
Btw <@202444817043685386>  do you remember the big || black blob||

are fucked up in the head
almost all gundam mcs
look it's just

it's so silly
i love isky reactions to wing

https://saucenao.com/
saucenao best
by the way S2 went into oblivion because the two new girls added useless fanservice and nothing else, only made MC more detestable
she's the least interesting one
the blonde short haired one.
she was french
french
???
in IS
an italian girl
and i don't remember
see? cultured.
Laura is best girl
??'
but it went wasted as the plot just does NOTHING with them.
the girls themselves had potential, expecially some of them
🪵
but he is a log.
since he is supposed to vector the plot.
He managed to bring down the girls with him
ever written
it's maybe the worst Harem MC
Ichika
major turn off
is the main character
Catalyst of the bad rating
S2 was an utter disaster.
IS plot is not bad, and S1 was at most a 7/10
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
for the 10000th time
elaborate
Let's
dislike haganai?
how could you

i was waiting "where is solo? do i have to ping him?"
i knew you would pop out
i gave 5/10 to IS2 iirc
ghhhhhhh
but it was left there unfolded.
her background was just that big
btw laura was best expecially because she was the one with most potential
left and right.

sisters.
the two blue haired
it was cringy forced fanservice to boot
Masamune kun is another bad anime
but i just couldn't.
Lodoss is something i tried to watch
indeed
the op is amazing
but it was really not my thing
Release the spyce was something that i would not mark as bad
Juuni Taisen is also bad
i dropped it at ep 4
saving kittens on trees.
freaking mafia members, doing what? charity
https://anilist.co/anime/12967/Arcana-Famiglia-La-Storia-Della-Arcana-Famiglia/ bad anime
since it's something that has a very specific audience.
well anyways redo is an hot potato
not by a longshot.
it is not the standard of a 2020 anime.
okay
really low budget would be the correct term
arifureta i heard has entire volumes skipped
THO BANGER WASTED OP
they were worse than stuff adapted 12 years ago.
come on the animations are horrible.
compared
i wont defend kaiyari since i didn't read it but it doesn't seem that the OG source is that bad
which adapts really badly the LN
the anime adapts the manga.
the LN is pretty different
solo i've made my research
Redo of healer short name
but Kaiyari case is just a really bad adaptation of a really bad adaptation of a LN
when talking of abominations
is worth mentioning
well Kaiyari
animation was acceptable
ghhhhhh
ARE BETTER
ALL THE HEROINES
EXCEPT
the mc has a thing for his useless childhood friend
or i was costantly facepalming
if i was fuming at this one
i didn-t know

Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai.
but it's actually a meme
btw yosuga no sora is also pretty bad
it was pretty nice for its times
D:
PHOS
well some names are to be ex pected
the mid 2000 ratings
reading
is completely original
but half of it
is good
Elfen lied but
end.
now the world focuses on the school coz of that.
join the academyt
tada!
ichika is a boyo
hurr big school for mechs, girls only can pilot it
but it's not easy indeed.
with retrospect
shows
err
i always try to judge people
eden's zero
well brb watching
lmao
is this that discussion?
bikki steals ichika's heroines?
it's not horrible, it memable
dace
52% is okay
no i mean
IDK
that comes in my mind
^
sure
that yes
Watashi is neutral but what if an Atashi lands?
i'm not half with you there
uh depends
and i think it's correct
for the gems
as pronoum
btw wiki uses "They"
indeed
oh it's ai kayano
DIA BEST CHARACTER
again
main character
Phosphophyllite
suffering wise.
that only goes up.
it's an hyperbole
Phos || became something unrecognizable || *despair everywhere*
|| manga || ptsd
ah if you find that creepy
when it came out
"The gem of the season"
had a pun
btw that anime
THE PAIN BOULE
GHHHH
Dia ftw
but i dropped the manga while liking it.
I wont spoil
later on.
tho the manga becomes something ungodly cursed
and great
Btw houseki no kuni is rad
but they're modelled like female mannequins
the gems don't have a clear gender
more or less
they all look cute
but i agree with the choice
sure
yeah lmao colour
ty
but i can manage
could be better
how are you
btw hi illindus it's been a while
i know
yes
but yeah
it's a bit complicated
and i said "I'm half with you and half not"
the "Orekko"
that's why i pulled out
Yes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i've been always here
btw eupho you speak lies
even if we can't ever agree of anything really
akeupho
i was greeting my lost italian mate
colour
are called "orekko"
yeah female using ore
EUPHO
IT'S
OMG
yeah
boku and ore are male
and are you gobbling mecha into scifi or keeping them in alternate sphere
yeah
amiya
define
so yeah only 3
and go recover stuff just afterwards
i usually don't hog down seasonals
i usually dislike this kind of show
the first part might be a bit flat and ripetitive
both the mc and nagatoro herself tend to grew on the spectator because the situation slowly but surely develops
tbh i read nagatoro manga
86, ez and nagatoro here
i got bored.
aaah you know what, have it your way
"rebuild civilization"
and goes off on completely different road.
Except the plot completely ignores it
you wont succeed.
other than that one.
another point
find me
carlos
dr stone does not tell any fiction
yes but is fiction
can you really say that it's mainly scifi?
of the show
That would be the ONLY non actual science element
they just overblow it
i mean shit actually works that way.
lmao
it's actual one
since it's not fictional science.
is not a proper scifi
dr stone
uh
the time
Symphogear doesn't have
so it is included.
but you said bs science
it's over-accurate magic
No index is bs science
but it does it
BS science
index does that
Lank
but it has fantasy elements mixed in
than many more i heard
Eden's Zero is much more scifi being akin to a space opera
err
but fictional science
Scifi is science fiction so a story that relies on science as pivotal element if we refer to a main genre
what is the discussion is aiming at
i-m trying to understand
yeah
~~ MAGES. goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ~~
is a pure science finction
i was about to mention
yeha
steins gate
i mean theoretically
😦
i really liked sidonia
now i go brrrrrrrrr
sidonia
damn you shouldn't have mentioned
😦
come on is1 was enjoyable
that's fantasy
pls no
exoskeletons
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
IS SF
STRATOS
INFINITE
they just delved deeper
of scifi
mecha is a subgenre
is it a switch
aaah sidionia ❤️
scifi shows
world trigger, mahouka (EXPLAINING MAGIC WITH SCIENCE HERE BRRR), tetsuwan birdy decode
even mecha
dal is considered
exoskeletons
dimensional quakes
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
heck DATE A LIVE is scifi
btw accel world is also scifi
exactly
i don't think it's important to explain it
lmao
for all i care laser rifles are not fantasy
Star Wars is Space opera
since the plot continues to pivot around this time travel mistery
yeah s;g is the predominant element
✅
isky is correct
exactly
it was worth
i endured it a bit
WHEN NEEDED
WHERE IS SOLO
LOL TO LOVE RU
read all the mangas
btw btw Boule i loved Gunnm
nono ~~
she's a cyborg
❤️
GUNNM
OMG
science fantasy
at most
nep is sf
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you can't tell me that freaking goddesses are mahou shojos
that statement is wrong.
no.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Nep mecha? uh
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
showing no care for the west consideration of the genres
this is me
this is where we were making a salad there
and secondary element
between main element
btw there is a difference
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
exoskeletons can be considered mecha by japanese standards
LOL
i will start considering Shipgirls a subgenre
are Urban Fantasy.
Persona as all SMTs
uuh
to MS
it just zoomed
no one got heated
no
MEDEEC
we shifted into weird directions
lmao
this discussion people
Plutia and Iris heart are an extreme case
but purple heart is not acting
Neptune is half acting
than neptune herself.
since Purple Heart is smarter and wiser
clearest example is neptune correcting her mistake only after transforming and understanding she was wrong
and amiya is kinda right? the HDD form is sorta of an alterego
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
BEG YOUR PARDON
MASOU SHOJO
but it's not enough for MS imho
working to ascend as cpus
of CPU Candidates
sister generations tells the story
that's because
as Goddess
japanese term uses "Megami"
it's an higher being.
neptune is not human.
since they're not even human...
it's just an upgrade
carlos.
even to transform
they don't need
again isky that's because of the CPU Candidate deal
pls.
LOL
all the legit MS show have at least 1-2 points in common
you have to follow some
carlos you can't ignore ALL the conventions
it's just there but the mc girl didn't know it
look at Genei wo kakeru taiyou
lol
not necessarily another world
conventions^
^
it's not an MS anymore
yes but there are conventions, if you ignore ALL of them
i finished r1r2 and r3 is at 1/3, gotta restart
(magikon where)
^
the plots are not silly
but yeah it's behind the comedy
i try to convey this
twice in 2 days
AGAIN
IS getting mentioned
you missed
btw solo
Lol
D:
you're not supposed to agree with her
and it's a cursed thing.
neptune's jokes
btw no because Plutia absorbs
so please do  not spoil fen

an entire LN volume
a new personal record
i think i've set
wew
otherwise i will just take some stuff comes in my mind and throw at you
because my tastes are not yours
lol
what kind of ln do you usally read
ffffffffffffff
nah i mean
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
depends what you want
95% of the times it's ok, that 5% is an issue
using chinese kanji
for example Miui has an huge issue
if it's android depending on the os it changes the font
android?
is this
^
but yeah ngnl is not in hiatus coz of that
only some of them
plus not all the illustrations were accused
it was before 2018
we are talking of a not so fresh fact
after that mil
he continued writing
it lasted not much
1 month?
for what
no one cared.
that fell into the void
NGNL had some Tracing accusations
Log horizon
no
not an LN writer
he's mainly a mangaka
plus important note
and he's also busy with another thing i can't recall
he was seen going in and out from the hospital
at least when the issue started
He wasn't
3 years since vol 10 got released
we get nothing more
NGNL is good, but since LN is on hiatus
i pay your pardon
MB
THE ENG NAME
LOL
YOU MEAN
AH
it's more a matter of life and death.
because
btw mondaiji outshines ngnl on the game concept thingy
lol
it's not only that
the story starts from there fenny
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
LIES
to no end
but i LOVED mondaiji
I haven't read Last Embryo yet
okay i'm gonna go same route and suggest randomly good things:
Hai to Gensou no Grimgar (Ongoing): I'm reading this currectly, anime adapted only volume 1, it's a fantasy story where the main characters have to face the harsh reality to survive, it's feelings heavy
Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?: It's an isekai (the basic concept in motion here was ripped by NGNL imho), but one of the bests, 12 volumes completed. In this world all human timelines converge into one, the main characters come from different time periods. It's great, i wont stress enough. The sequel called last embryo is ongoing.
Accel World: Cyberpunkish. Same author as SAO, but this is miles better than that. It's also a psychological light novel other than being focused about this videogame that also changes reality.
86: i also reccomend 86, not much to say on my end, they already described it
Kusuriya no Hitorigoto: Yes. This thing is settled in imperial china's harem. A young woman ends up working as pharmacist/medic in it (the main character). I think it's pretty unique.
*hysteria mode where*
it's outstand as it is...
just adapt the freaking novel.
it would have gone MUCH better.
they could have adapted just the volume after the last one adapted
WHY THO
in 20+ volumes
never to be mentioned again
AA main character only appears ONCE in volume 7
and no AA DOESN'T EXIST
eh there is only so much you can show in 10 episodes
UNDERRATED AF
is Hidan no aria
because the Light novel is freaking amazing
enough justice
btw one anime that didn't get
in the volumes
jumping forward and backwards
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
look at how Mahouka was adapted
let's go people
Lol stb
FREAKING ZUS
ZEUS
EVEN
and so on
Vampires
Dragons
hell so many myths got called in only 12 volumes
the world of mondaiji is one heck of worldbuilding
i was shivering.
the freaking concept of "Last trial of humanity"
that blasted me
There was one thing
but i think there were also enough yo and asuka scenes
azi had many izayoi's scene
well yeah
infact look who became || no name's leader ||
equally
i think they were all 3 treated
eeeh fen?
plus the encounters were FUCKING RAD
Mondaiji put that sense of life and death
i assure you
i own the physical copy
movie is volume 6, which is a prequel
but it's not original since, again, mondaiji did it better
and movie is v6
1-2
fz
NGNL is not bad imho
nothing more nothing less
is just volume 6
the movie
he didn't trace every art in the novel
tbh? i don't care about the tracing issue
the movie was released after the tracing shit
It analyzes
is involved
yeah in thrillers often murdering
but it's not a thriller
is psychological
Grisaia No kajitsu
There
and i need a moment for that
yeah i would have to find you a psychological anime which is not a thriller
or BOTH
a psychological
an anime can be a thriller
are not the same thing
Thriller and Psychological
cecil
pls
index? i ranted enough
btw it's a case i don't know details of
Want me to admit that i watched only S1?
they did what they could in F
ZnT author died
in s1-s2.
they just got omitted and deleted
they are so much important that Sale is freaking dantalion's son
there are entire characters like Chiara and Sale that get entire episodes in S3. But you're like "wait who are these two",
and became something really amazing
s3 went boom
infact the moment they didn't
but in this case they just dumbed down the product
can be acceptable
mil, usually i also say that adapting and taking some liberties
it's underwhelming AF
SHE USES FREAKING TENPA JOUSAI in the LN
shana kills friagne with a shard of glass, A SHARD OF GLASS
but there are absurdities here and there
i will not change my 10/10
i rewatched it recently
ah yes
D:
TELL ME
WHO IS FUMINA KONOE
HALF S2 DOESN'T EXIST MIL
it's just because S1 and S2 are UGLIER thanks to that.
NOH
NNNNNH
it EXPANDS SUDDENLY
But
objectively yes
Look millhi
S1-S2 went distorted
is 1:1
Only S3
got murdered apart
rip sns
light novel?
ah yes the lost to god knows where
pink.
it's not

BTW I SHOULD HAVE
but i say that as aperson who gave a 10/10
that the thing is borked
so much content and volume skipping happened
tl;dr
but yeah fz
hm?
it can be whatever, even a slice of life can be psychological
and focuses on these
the mental aspects
well brb gotta slay final boss dlc in ff
and the girls around the mc are just <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
i just love the worldbuilding
is Death March
i gotta continue
another light novel
of describing things
let's say that OSO has a weird way
more serious note
only sense online is different
bofuri has that ridiculous comedic vibe
thing
not the same
but i want to try a third time.
tried twice
i will resume one day is Only Sense Online
if there is one light novel

plus HF killed me more over budget
it was like a regular 4 more episodes
yeah but other than that?
more would be overrated
8.5 at best
uh it's no better than the anime imho
kimetsu no yaiba movie
just watched
AH YES
LOL
it's maybe harder than writing likeable characters
in writing obnoxious characters
btw let's say that konosuba author did a good job

infamous quarter/trio
Kazuma falls into the
honzuki is pretty unique on how it plays
nah it isn't
i will watch s2
at least up to s1
i don't see much worldbuilding in that
I also suggest honzuki no gekokujo but
but the rest eeeh
that's why the worldbuilding shines
he just goes around visiting places and messing around
death march has a "flaw" of having a tourist isekai mc
i'm reading it currently
save this one amiya
on the world building
Grimgar is also really good
the protag is a tourist
Death March
You mean worldbuilding?
☑️
tada, isekai done
You could write a seinen psychological thriller story, just set in an isekai
based on an isekai
one is free to write whatever
isekai is just a setting people
for example this: || https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQExTwcgk2w ||

that was the awesome part
he just ||"rewinds"     ||
lmao
Well come on we can't really say "Subaru has savestates"
anyways
meh.
pls nova??
answering lank
i'm
no
Log horizon is an isekai that ||baits the reader into  believing|| they're into a videogame, since the world has a really similar mechanics based on the videogame they were playing. || but it's a pure isekai || in the end
list me power fantasy, you go up in dozens.
you will not even go up to 10
but go list me game mechanics isekai
No they aren't
is much much more common
plain power fantasy
nah
but they're rare
i'm not fighting points
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
but log horizon is politics.
and works wonderfully
but it's in an isekai
uses game mechanics
Log horizon
it's not that common tbh
Videogame isekai?
what do you mean
it's a fun lighthearted power isekai that follows some mechanics that we have already seen in overlord
opinions <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and works pretty good.
Slime is power fantasy isekai
nah it's not always a negative, it's just that it's overdone, so you gotta try harder into finding good stuff in that subgenre
and crap one
there is good power fantasy
or it can be done badly amiya
It can be done good
yeah
now brb i'm gonna go back trying to understand what people drink at breakfast, watching last SNK season and finding the politics and the reasoning just stupid
i think he had a great idea into writing what he did
and in the afterwords he insists into not comparing military with what he writes. (iirc)
the author was a soldier.
plus do not forget
well i think it was the old novel which had some really glorious nippon scenes
i was reading the LN which is heavier
on the JSDF thingy
regarding gate, the anime in the end is really tame
nowadays isekais are not the same as they were 8 years ago
2013
the anime at least
as mondaiji
yeah OC was released the same year
well whatever
do you really?^
nowadays yeah it would be boring as heck
it was released
with the time period
to put it in context
you have
10/10
the DWARF PLAYING EROGES
WAS FUN
OUTBREAK COMPANY
gate
nuuuuuuuuuuu
which is part of the cyberpunk subgenre
you're stepping on the virtual world setting
you know that
rip
yeah but it isn't
NGNL artstyle is radly colorful as heck
but i see what you mean
i will not step into the concept of sao being a fake isekai, rip people playing vr games
ranking alone i don't think it's enough to make game mechanics
nah it doesn't. it's just a weird callback. i'm talking about explicit stuff
but it's not ultra-common
thing to find
i'm not saying that game mechanics is a rare
lemme remove it
well whatever it would be an useless long discussion
yeah but it's not
ok?
fix
lemme
none of these use videogame mechanics
btw slime, death march, mondaiji, knight's and magic, youjo senki, kenja no mago, gate
LMAO
yeah but since it isn't, it's a stretch to say that it has game mechanics
for the lulz

ok
ah
I agree with serious's opinioon
```
So will There Be Redo of Healer Season 2?

No official announcement for the second season has been made as of now, but, taking into account how popular the entire series has become after the anime aired, I think Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi Season 2 has an excellent chance of getting announced. 

There is enough source material available currently and the series has made tons of money from merch sales. If you ask why it is taking so long for a sequel, it’s probably because anime studios are busy these days, including studio TNK, where they are booked upto next 2-3 years. So even If the production committee did green-light a sequel in 2021 after the anime success, it would take a few years to announce next season.```

btw lmao

millhi you're too cryptic
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
*looks at fairy tail comedy fanservice scenes*
bring me the missing point!
Then
and it just works.
i mean lots of eroges in VNs do this
the door to enter the H room is there, but it stays behind it.
it is still in the realm of ecchi
Borderline is still not Hentai
Ecchi can go as far as showing a sex scene, but as long it doesn't go down in detail and show genitals it doesn't go over the line of hentai
aren't the same thing
Fanservice and straight out Ecchi
it was not a question.
but i still appreciate some good old onii-sama
so far nothing relevant
btw watching shiba miyuki side story anime
lmao
you don't have to tell me
i know it's a bad adaptation
this cyberpunk feeling
tbh
this stuff is pretty good
Reading Ex Arm manga
or a series of specials like Unicorn
not an entire tv series
it's just a movie
well i'm fine if they wanted to go that way
the picture feels incomplete
doesn't have background.
THe biggest issue is that the "Fake Char"
tbh
was pretty heartbreaking
the story of the 3 miracle kids
i wont even comment technical departments, it's a given on that
a solid 8.5/10 i'd say, something felt missing. But it felt pretty strong
i just finished watching gundam NT
Okayokay
wait
absolutely
oh yes
you're not wrong
i understand
(fuck wataru tho, i'm sorry weird kid)
they're, different.
come on
well we can't really say that V and X are bad
am i right?
with Zs
basically
i see, that's more or less when srw started to going into the new direction
in the 90s?
so Banpresto was standalone
okay
who writes the plots
what is the studio
wait wait
wasn't?
for you
that's bandai
ahahahah
LOL
i reckon
but they're also hyperultra harmful
uh i guess
this is worse than embryo from ange going "MUH I CREATED NEWTYPES AND INNOVADES"
WHEN
LOL WAIT
not combo attacks
plot wise
no no
it's to see this more newtype magic playing along with weird crap like the getter rays
what could be cool tho
with the rx9
since knowing myself i will want to hang around
that will bum me out
eeeeeeeh
*sad noises*
The sad part of this point, is that we will have some backfire of this newtype magic in the new srw
*his name is mufty nabyu erin*
that's something i have high expectations on
is the terrorist camp boy's adaptation
next one in line
well come on
i mean "okay, you say this shouldn't exist, but i don't see the context of this statement"
ah the neo zeong felt like overblown
but yeah RX9 was absolutely rad
D:
you don't do this to the orchis
pls mel
i went nuts before it went into "rx0" ugly mode
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
GP03 OFFSHOOT CONFIRMED
RX 9
THIS IS WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
OH YEAH
but i don't feel like giving a 7 just because the story chose to revolve around the 3 newtype younglings
00s2 did that crap with innovades
it's not the " most fitting" thing of the whole UC timeline
i mean gundam is a real robot, relying too much on the "newtype magic"
but i absolutely understand that point and it's entirely valid
srw v
still haven't seen seed and destiny
no mel
it's a scatter-type of cannon
it's not a laser
amiya
but part of the additional armament
unit
of the main gundam
nah it's there because it's not part
wtf mel lol
eh

gp03 had huge beam sword
btw mel no
is the cannon
that red part

genuine question

no hold up mel

yo litchi
i was trying to understand
this is jojo discussion
ah
i hated these
uuh
i discovered it only afterwards
but here you *feel* it's underwhelming
i agree with your point
but you just skip these
10-15 episodes long
the only issue is a filler
s3 is incoming
but works overall
s2 cut something out
being shit.
it's just the s1 graphics
the anime adaptation is 1:1 fz
imho
underrated
aand i rushed.
but at episode 7-9 it went boom
i was dropping it
World trigger being one example
nah i had this feeling from other shows
but the first 3 episodes are on purpose confusing
it's insane stuff fz

i think they're like that
i loved horizon
oooh boy
kawakami?
What horizon
till they get good
but there are some show that are plain
that's fine.
if you start hating a show
and that can't be denied.
anyways there's a thing called buildup
then it goes sky high
first 4 eps are a total disaster
is sigururi
that comes in my mind
a short show
take a bit to become good
or light novels
or mangas
many shows
there is one truth about this
Tho
i can't get heated on jojo discussions
nah don-t worry
overdrives > stands
Based on this i everyoen can kill guze no tomogaras now
that Friagne got killed by a shard of glass.
i would remind you
but even by ignoring s3
ARE TWO VICTIMS OF THIS
SALE AND CHIARA
EXACTLY
but sns is more of a case of *let's cut chonks of a very good ln*
x_x
in the ln
F u m i n a k o n o e never existed
since they go back on track (or i should say the finally discover the original direction)
but recovers in s3
coz of the filler
shakugan no shana goes to shit halfway
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<@!202444817043685386> there you asked
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
> 13-24  filler original
then when i went to research about it
it really felt underwhelming from the second half
why did they HAVE TO PUT A FILLER THERE
ghhhhhhhhhhhhh
HEAVY OBJECT
THERE
at least for me
than stuff that starts out badly
badly
but yeah it's a bit harder to find stuff that ends
the sequel
but Last Embryo translation is in wip
fantl
i found it alright
really?
hm?
.
narrating past events just to worldbuild is fine but it isn't when the situation was in the middle of the heat
it's actually mondaiji
but i didn't drop there
i've read fully but i didn't enjoy vol 6-7 out of 12
there is one light novel
btw actually i remembered something
taiga pls
https://puu.sh/HWmNl/c9fc773e35.png
this makes you understand i got patience.
btw fz i got only 57 dropped titles vs 345 completed
it was p4 the issue for me
i liked whole p3
oh well yeah
so it really bores me or makes me angry when something i'm enjoying goes bad
i'm usually lenient when comes to rate and like/dislike stuff
and too slow plot
.hack//sign another anime i dropped after the second half, it got boring
Danmachi is something i dropped at s2
at episode 19
<@!202444817043685386> Shokugeki no souma is one anime i dropped out of boredom
but i was fuming.
i gave 6 out of pity
in what? 3-2 episodes?
i dropped from a 8.5 to a 6.
Blue Gender
sure
the bad ending anime?
hm?
key one, dragonoid, spirit arc
they don't beat || mosquito ||
it stops following the manga on the tornado island
by second half
i really got bummed out
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
i found one
soul eater crap second half
anyways fz
but they steered back in
i tried to steer away
she takes ages to become a really cool badass character
not that early index mikoto is better
plus railgun mikoto is so plain 😦
|| poor saten she will never meet frenda again || <:Ver:704169051391524875>
or sister arc
the cool parts in railgun are all tied to main ln timeline, one example being Saten/Frenda
it is original
^
silent party is shit imho
at some point it will either stop, or go|| follow mikoto travelling the whole world to stalk touman||
to main novels
i meant the source can't be written alone since it's really strictly tied
what i meant
that's not
my dear ash
without index
you can't have railgun
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
and went original
they adapted 1/3 of the manga, and you can *feel* where they dropped
was soul eater
another stuff that got ruined by bad adaptation
i hope for the future <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
several times i will stop for now
well anyways i've covered this argument
||touma *dies* || period. 
no buts about it.
this statement changes in nt01 prologue.
the meme fact is that s3 ends with nt prologue, that shit is not in the OT novels..
that was the easiest but most horrible approach
if they want to obtain NT
i also said
Yes that's what
it's ultrapacked
you mess up one brick and stops working properly
is that everything just builds up
eh issue with index
i more or less can understand *why* they decided to rush
in just one key episode
this pic represents one of the fails

it was doomed to fail.
in 6 episodes.
huge ones
3 volumes
they rushed
well serious
and ww3
being battle royale
managed to kill 2 of the best arc of the first ln
s3 well
well i will not delve too much but, s1-s2 were already weak products, but acceptable
it only got worse
Touma was already suffering from the "Emiya Shirou Disease"
stuff got cut, changed, it got incomprensible and dumb
rip.
how to murder a light novel
then there is index s3
but there is other relevant content that got modified/cut out
well that's the most important part
it's lost into oblivion
since the OG LN will never be translated
sadly i got only intel from research i've made by lurking on the web
hell Margery Daw appears only afterwards in the source, they just jumbled it up
the guy with the doll
first arc is Vs Friagne
s1
no
in the ln, as long as i know, shana unleashes || freaking tenpa jousai || to kill it.
quenser is a student and is 17(goldie), havia is escaping nobility iirc
officer
well she's a military
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
she's only 18 y/o
frolatya capistrano best character
the pole dance part really made me laugh
lmao
infact it really shines up to the canon part
but jokes aside it's really good
he ended up writing Metal gear solid novel <:Ver:704169051391524875>
index author wanted to try to write a mecha
that went greatly
Heavy object is an experiment
and it feeeeels underwhelming starting from the 13th ep
2nd half original
i mentioned above
Heavy object
another one
btw
they get beaten.
mine is Arc-V > DM > 5Ds > GX > Zexal
btw funfact italian dub yu gi oh has italodance 90s openings <:Ver:704169051391524875>
i didn't watch it
THANK YOU CURSED 4KIDS

Yes but yuusei is really solid

are Yuusei
that are solid
mc in the whole franchise
but in the end the only two
jaden is an idiot
i dislike gx because
it was the obelisk force vs the cipher dragon guy
involved
the mc wasn't
PLOT ARMOR
i call this fuckery
i went fuming in arcv when the twin sisters didn't help obelisk force
fucking yuuya
"EGAO"
JUST ONE
for one reason
Arcv ends badly
Look
FLOWER WOLF INTENSIFIES
back in FORBIDDEN MEMORIES
prefer yu gi oh
i know you people
destroyed.
and you see zexal big building
the door closes.
a sea of despair
"Zetsubou no umi, tojiru tobira"
starts with
because arcv 5th opening
"Look zexal failed, yuuma died (headcanon)"
to Zexal
was a direct shotfire
ArcV 5th opening
when
I was there "OH YES"
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
screw zexal
when sang it
Masaki Endoh just gave it all
10/10
is just great.
anyways clear mind
vang is just popular
fow has the huge pro of being a game with mechanics from magic and yu gi oh and being ultra cheap (most expensive card can be a ruler 20€)
majority of yu gi oh ex players are 50-50 on fow/vang
64-128
128 players roster
well magic got so huge here that tournaments go down
wohohooo
*FREAKING CLEAR MIND*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1Sx7B5WnDo
ever made belongs to 5ds
the best yu gi oh anime song
didn't try hard enough
btw you people
i couldn't play yu gi oh here since it died back in 2014-2015 where i live, players migrated to Magic/Vanguard/Force of Will
even then anyways
yeha
that's why i never played irl yu gi oh
the other high tier decks were not pendulum based.
Performage.
in tier 1 that used pendulums
there was only 1 deck
and people bitched but in the end
i liked pendulums
why konami must kill all the fun every damn time? 😦
rip they killed pendulums
*tutututururu*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RaztTuTKs8

YURERO, TAMASHII NO PENDULAMU

Hey hey, i am next to on pair with grimgar
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
??
Gotta resume reading it
Woh i just noticed hidan no aria is 33v long and counting
poor girl
ps: man, shihoru's || mental trauma || is so deep
so i will see
but i'm just at the first part of the volume
it's too much weird for my tastes
that much
i'm not liking parano
well mil thank you
okay
ah
is that the author extended 14's arc
My wild guess
important thing is that they were tled
okay
in total
they're 19
14++
coz 14+
yeah
were tled?
all 17
(also fuck parano)
i'm reading vol 14 of grimgar, but that's it for the Eng TL? i mean 14+ hasn't been translated yet right?
<@!152896851660505088> one question
To love ru intensifies
of heero threatening the girl
to the wing scene
but anyways i was referring
LMAO
KAMILLE
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
raidou???
invites you to her birthday
when a pretty girl
what do you do
wing is still bad
yeah but
Wing is objectively one of the not so good gundam series
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
+ Zero System
plot is half baked
like it forces to show off fanservice on the protags
and boasts stuff that isn't good
it focuses on the wrong thing
hinders the whole gundam wing
The problem
Zabi went brrr
During oyw
Remember that humanity was halved down
But all started with ef not giving spacenoids the same rights of earthnoids
And nerve gas
Well ofc i can't compare with colony drop
Stuff like unicorn came later in my watch list
With 0083 and z
As a gundam fan who started uc from 0079, i dropped the idea that zeon was the baddie pretty early
Look
Sry
Is the right term
Corrupt
*colony laser on friendlies*
Federation was already ultrascummy, 0083 confirms it
So i hard disagree
Mel that premise falls outright with Zeta
Neither the feddies nor zeon are good
Zeon aren't the bad guys isky
i liked those ovas but not my fav uc gundam
but that leads you on how whacky the feddies are
i rembered wrong
Ah ye nvm
War in the pocket
isn't that the movie?
0080?
a bit slow but reasonable
gud stuff is gud
i'm watching slime new season
btw
i'm still on my first run
js
i didn't reread index
i don't remember every detail
look, there are worse people than me on index
i know i'm weird
well i'm not exactly your average person
in his head
that fz has a weird idea of me
i'm starting to think
yeah
mostly
i take screenshots of absurd things
ah well
iirc
it happened with Rokka no yuusha
and rushed stuff
a few times i went brrrrrrrrrr
i cannot go over 3, but there are exceptions
on anime rushin
melua's
my take is more or less
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sV8PGkwE6I ah right
anyways
it's like saying "watch dbz"
i don't reccomend fmab coz it's a given

!
yeah do
it's still pretty good in the end
but mainly on season 2
SNS is bad adaptation mostly
you just don't find nowadays
it's stuff with that unique feeling
are black lagoon, shakugan no shana, seto no hanayome, el cazador de la bruja
a few examples in my mind
but there is some stuff that was so good that you wouldn't find today
uuh not everything from 2000s is decent
2000s
and has some fillers
doesn't adapt everything
just know that the anime halts
i do suggest d gray man

we were talking of some mid 2000s stuff
i didn't poke you
solooooooooooo
there's no way that she would have || died || like that
yes.
Lucy's arms || reached over 2400 miles in just 20 seconds ||
<@!202444817043685386> just to making you understand
it's still a good read
even if the anime is faithful up to some point
read it from scratch
it just escalates to absurd levels
she's an entity so powerful that you can't kill her even with a fucking tank
no way lucy would go || off like that ||
it's coz it's just og
eh see?
oh well it's a gore-y manga
yeah that ending is just weird
it's important
in chronological order
watch it
it's overrated?
but
it's a very good show
i don't.
for not watching haruhi
many would condemn you
it's still enjoyable but the manga is just superior.
so it has OG ending
when it got adapted
the manga wasn't finished yet
oh elfen lied is also something i might count as good from the mid 2000s but...
not me
is Solo
Lord Mid 2000s
i have still lots to watch
what i watched from mid 2000s
https://puu.sh/HXREn/325077b4f8.png
https://puu.sh/HXREE/3a1e6427b3.png
how cna you lol
they're too much different
fuck it.
I could for example recommend clannad, but i got so angry at after story that i dropped it with a 9 at ep 18
btw i have to think...
it's an LN
no fz
it makes even more sense like that
if you go read the manga, it's all in one package
these are just SoL scenes while sagara stays to watch over chidori
it's included in core fmp.
to be adapted alone
Fumoffu was not supposed
You just pressed the painful point
.
(1990s)
the novels are lost into oblivion since they're pretty old
so good ~
i've read the whole manga
they don't adapt everything
tho even with the newest adaptation, being Invisible Victory
FMP is really great

hey copyright
Topic was "here be elves"
Uh i didn't out of ill will, i am sorry
sasuga author
tho it improved halfway
poor Alice also
btw <@!152896851660505088> i'm going through grimgar 14, man it's so weird, fucking parano
(also culture)
that's normal
it is supposed to run several events from the lenses of miyuki
y
but ffs it took 4 episodes to start having some sense
i appreciate the fanservice.
Mahouka no yuutosei
btw watching
to him
Rance is a chadman, kazuma is the bad brother who can't hold a candle
NO PLS
LOL
man that question is forbidden
Chadman 9000 game
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

Prunus girl was just great
Nb tho, it went huge halfway
I just finished grimgar v14, fucked up weird vol confirmed
CC?
😦
HAIRPINS
LEL
no my point are the titans.
they act like mechas
oh well sry
Flesh mechs
with Shingeki no kyojin butting in
i have serious issues
why with that definition
(Zoids in SRW where)
but that didn't stop nadia from joining srw
Yamato and Macross are mecha, but something like Nadia, is not
freaking Baby Magnum
https://anketsublog.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heavy-object-anime-baby-magnum-ep1-2.jpg?w=723
these are mechas
Look at Heavy Object
oh sure
or RX0 destroy mode
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
with how EVAs work
Psycho Gundam kinda has similarities
funfact, now that i think of it
Tachikomas ❤️
but for a different reason
this is the same reasoning behind Evas being mechs
Mecha ✅
well gg done
<@!457268466429329429> If you think of Transformers as Mechs with Self Aware ai
D:
PLS
NO
i wasn't saying the opposite
ye ofc
the transformation factor
ah you meant
then what
Macross is a mecha anime
no
uh
Frontier transforms
that's a legit magimech basically
K&M
they build it
No no come on
well okay i will stand down, but the line is thin
rip
but but even cybuster uses magic, i don't think it's the magic component the issue
no || injection || no eren titan
that's the external force
mel i don-t agree, they get their ||shit by injection||
hm no_
good
Oh sad that || since we raphael now|| she talks less
Rip
Uh nuuu
Koku
Plus when it goes action, it goes huge
Absolutely
I love expositions
Like that
And it's perfect
best character
Rayneshia!
❤️
like NOBUNA
if you want to backtrack
btw good isekais can be also old ones
*raises glasses*
- log horizon
wait wait, it was: 15% cute girls, 10% action, 75% politics&economics
P O L I T I C S

You missed the glory
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
did you watch the s3 in the end???
SPEAKING OF WHICH
too much
you want log horizon
Look aya
nothing amazing but watchable
about this
decent stuff
https://anilist.co/anime/114302/Cheat-Kusushi-no-Slow-Life-Isekai-ni-Tsukurou-Drugstore i have heard
sounded with a nice cozy synopsis
btw Pharmacy in the other world
people say that the LN is enjoyable
back in the day
in like no time
DxD was completely translated
want to know a thing?
lol aya
what one
fake gf*
and fixated with his gf
sad that the mc is dumb
are nice
the girls around the mc
no come on
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
isekai cheat magician?
no nvm that's a battle school
mahou sensou
(i said *can*)
and can be a chad
he's better than Ichika
But putting that bad part of him aside
of a childhood friend of his.
that ugly and bad character
he prefers
but no
He has girls at his feet
no intro, mc is in this isekai with his smartphone, he googles stuff, applies research to his feud (we don't know how he got it) and plays age of empires
this one is so stupid

https://myanimelist.net/anime/37446/Hyakuren_no_Haou_to_Seiyaku_no_Valkyria
suguha liked kazuto the idiot since childhood
ah yes suguha
doesn't really count
Asuna is his legit GF
Gil, Klein
Silica, Liz, Sinon, Alice (if we want to include her) and who else?
as they used to
yeah but they don't try
and quit trying to gun at him
after a certain point they recognize kirito belongs to asuna
they are a group of friends mostly
err
well succumbing is a big word
yeah
(top)
(shinonon the only one of the gang shittalking kirito in the face)
infact she's the best girl
not even Shinonon
by kirito
was ruined
eh but Phantom bullet
pre  alicization prob
GGO is the raddest thing described in sao
and went wild on it
by reki
it's that the author used the worldbuilding left there
fact about saoa
golden
i went nuts.
and i saw p90 mc
so that moment saoaggo went up
know how much i like the p90 as weapon
those who know me for years
man
THAT INCLUDES LENN STORYLINE
GUESS WHO BOUGHT FATAL BULLET DLC
MY P-CHAN
TOUCH
DON'T YOU DARE
not yet
i know that one, haven't watched it tho
back
into nothingness
he just disappeared
i had contacts directly with him on facebook
disappeared
the guy responsible for the tl
since july 2020
it's been halted
LN is tled up to vol 18
sadly because the ln is so dope
they decided to end it there
are original.
the last eps
sadly fz, as i've stated
as much gate did
didn't elaborate that
point taken, but outbreak company
JSDF soldiers bringing down || dragons with modern weaponry||
but you don't have
we get tanks
sad
you didn't watch
now you got an isekai of 2010s
see aya
i find it a just fucking great concept
it's not the first time i express my opinion about gate
*hides*
infact GATE is my fav isekai
with guns
man i don't have issues
being the last arc
i'm curious about unital ring
ye, i anyways recognize ggo alt being good, but i just can't put it at the same level of the later contents of main novels
and rad asuna
kayaba & friends
plus we get more about the true part of the plot
to the point of being the best part of the whole writings/anime
improving the best plot
is that he goes in background
it's not that his suffering is the boon
which is even better.
Alicization and wotu has kirito on || wheel chair in coma||
i will make it even better
Carol

then no fz
:3
i showed you what i own now fz?
it's not good as War of the underworld (alicization 2nd half)
while GGO alt is good
seeing him alive again just rekindled her feelings
about this matter
well it was 2 pages long
in the afterwords
with his writings
infact he clearly states to not compare irl military
but it's because the author was a soldier, but he didn't write it to be propaganda
sure there is propaganda
i've read part of the LNs
tbh
on gate being only propaganda
i don't agree
talk to you later
boyo
terrorist camp

but stuff i high rate? i would just recommend again and gladly rewatch it if happens
it was just dumb
i'm dead sure i would drop something like that nowadays
and i liked it
i watched Sekirei years ago

they only went downwards
i can't defend index adaptations
Well mil

(jk)
anyways ash, i will let you live for dropping index, i'm high spirits <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

btw one anime i wished more was Kamisama no inai nichiyoubi
what has changed from starting point?|| nothing||
they do everything to || save humanity || then what? || drop it in 1 episode ||
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1vEAOqCNFw
freaking pointless anime
freaking Blue gender
in only 3 eps
and that 6 was goodwill
i dropped the rate from 9 to a 6
want to hear an anime that sent me fuming on all fours
go play the event mil-senpai
wait i'm not sure it was paradise lost, but they share one key soundtrack, i was aghast
I HEARD THIS
HOLD ON

just finished reading bloom into you manga
gotta go on pair with grimgar before doing anything else tho
well i could start, js06 is dedicated enough to continue usually
and the page seems "updated in the last 3 months"
usually he/she posts on baka tsuki
i need to be sure how much has js06 tled first
but
i'm sure i could get hooked
no other japanese modern light novel is that thick
HUGE
it's
at least it seems
ok halfway volume 8-B
I need to check so far how much js06 has translated
I think there is no series that can be compared to Horizon and also do a great job like it
Kawakami is a madman
I swear, one day i'm gonna read the whole set of bibles

^
poor ex arm
what a wasted opportunity
I am on pair with the manga
GHHHH
yeah but it feels unjust
yeah
the content was at normal shonen level
but
Yes godlike animation
coz it buildups for the content of the second cour
yeah that made the first half cour lose lots of "power"
exp the movie was pretty... ordinary?
def overrated
but
Tbh demon slayer is good
it would have been a full cour
coz covid
look, don't forget s2 is split in two

People die when they're killed
My take
I was more trying to say, true you're correct but if a vn topic spawns here, imho nothing wrong
Valid point
You know the issue spawns when stuff gets adapted
ISEKAI MC

i read the lns
WHEN THE anime ended at FREAKING VOL 4.
AT VOLUME 21

this reminds me people hating on Accel world
some shows have good shit afterwards
this is my belief

*arpeggio*

kamisama no inai nichiyoubi
2013 had blood lad, chuunibyou
c u r s e d
**INFINITE STRATOS 2**
if only s1 had that budget.

the budget surprised
aya kudos on world trigger 2
expecially because of what happens in it
absolutely
oh yes
rip in pepperoni|| [Star Caster] and [The Destiny]||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
But but 0083
Cross ange <3
yes
basically rezero author reminded himself he likes to make his characters suffer <@!238855496797257729>
ep 5 starts: despair, death, war, tears and so on
Sigururi 1-4 seems like cute girls doing cute things but on airplane
ep 5 **sharply u-turns** the whole anime
paid back the experience
and it COMPLETELY
feeling something felt off
i was literally straining
ah yes the anime that becomes good after episode 4
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
best program
oh yes taiga
that went really great
it started only as an experiment
20+ volumes?
heavy object got what
*while still writing index at the same time since 2003*
starts 2
he ends writing one LN
Kamachi is a madman anyways
i think it's okay, depending on how it ends, that it ends
yeah we talked about this today
yes
that's why i made anilist account
i remember that
i know
also really ugly to look at
api included
for a year? Mal should just fucking update their website, it's old and deprecated
and now they're kinda similar
but then mal userbase moved
at first
anilist users were a bit more elititst
dw
it didn't happen
when it isn't
it's also like the author is tryharding to sound it smart
but yeah i was like "BRUH || it's only normal to retaliate after all the shit you've done to them||". It fucking made no sense
i'm not speaking out of ill will
i'm curious
just report back when you're done
nah nikosuba, have your fun
i laughed when the other faction || felt as if retaliation was unjust ||
yeah.

VNs have details of LNs i think
*hides in a corner*
Koihime musou anime where
lmao
text, routes, visuals, music
just think of it
VNs are probably the most complete media
i think that
so far that C;C retconned
C;H was a bad adaptation
no it's O;9
i know about O;N
okay misknowledge on MAGES. shenanigans
we sure of that?
R;N is a LN iirc
these are good adaptation
true
S;G and S;G 0
it's just that adapting a VN can be a bit harder than a LN
there are flaws but they're good afterall

imho
higurashi is a decent adaptation

Sad, wotu is the hype point
By wotu?
Oh
Hm?
Alicization and wotu are good
See i told ya
Ooofz
6/10 so far
is revealing such a turn off
man mahouka spinoff
i meant ez
this shows more in the manga, the anime kinda lowkeys this
lucy has a bit less realistic proportions
Rebecca is more "thick"
you understand what i mean
Lucy and Rebecca
if you compare
ft had some leftover from him helping oda
is the character proportions
<@!202444817043685386> another thing is find that mashima improved
what could go wrong
+ cool ass ost
+ jupiter cannon
+ erza
+ bisca
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm9CoiB0yy0

there there fz
i will read it someday
isn't it
that's ongoing
mashima took it's dear time to improve
So yeah
it doesn't work in the manga.
but i say it works in the anime
people shit on the final arc (alvarez)
and alvarez
tartaros
with tournament
then it only goes up
ep 100 is the last low point
if we pull key arc away (which you can safely do, it doesn't matter in the plot)
well whatever
behind Oracion Seis
also if that's canon it hampers the whole lore
how the hell is that canon
it's not in the manga
wtf fz?
it is not
(note remove the filler after it, fuck key arc)
the shit goes flying
well
Once tenrou happens
it's a serious of shenanigans connected by this figure "zeref"
because it chases nothing
till episode 100 (tenrou arc)
basically we can solid state that ft goes up and down
- Obnoxious Happy
the manga solves this last problem
you can even make
and has the worst fillers
in starting
that FT takes LOTS AND LOTS of time
It has to do with the fact
I also agree that FT is not bad
Mashima absolutely improved since FT
man these places take really some fantasy
is the worldbuilding
one thing that really really stands out on EZ
mashima managed to make happy finally not obnoxious
I like how
agree
pino pls
also
yes
they fucking nailed it
TOP TIER
SISTER'S VOICE
BTW
i'm liking the animation department tbh
gonna resume once anime halts
but i'm on hold with the manga
i'm liking edens zero so far
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Features: ktk, maon, sat, freaking motsu, a limousine and alcohol beverage
lmao
after 5 years i still find it fucking ridiculous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D40xMNPS58s i was remembering this music video
what mahouka failed a bit in the adaptation was the chronological order
it's this spinoff that sounds pointless
mahouka anime
i loved
well can't be helped
but i see your point
i like reading
I don't have that huge issue because
of "modern shows"
lmao
one of the closest to do so is freaking SAO with 24+24+24+13 and it still misses last arc
understandable
hm
when the poor boyo is a "from the bottom to the top" character type
well each its own, it's just that many downvote the anime because of the main character
it's a psychological anime/novel
accel world more than being cyberpunk
it's pointless since anime stops at v4
do like tsukihime anime, just assume it doesn't exist
a movie that takes place around volume 21
Accel World Infinite Burst
shame it was wasted on a failure of a movie
fantastic song
other than that
2.52
chillin in the limo

and then move onto 0079 which is main timeline
if you never watched any gundam, IBO is a good entry point, you could gauge there
and it can be heavy to digest
be ready for 1979 animation
0079
if you go down
experience may vary a lot
are you actually starting?
what gundam
THEN THERE IS APOCRYPHA
it's lesser with the adaptations
it hit me like a truck while reading the vn
"hey what why is this like this, zero told me otherwise"
you notice the freaking broken plot points
the line of tought
well if you follow
that knowledge didn't exist in 2004
it's just the release order
i would just say, sure watch zero but do it afterwards
since FSN is more legit solo (and it's the main one, we still can't claim Zero as 100% canon)
Yeah but at this point
if you watched zero
you bring down and nullify that scene which is key
with *pink/violet* ribbons.
of a young tohsaka
do you remember the scene with the Picture
think of it
I will make a clear reference here
it does, and exactly because of that you shouldn't do it
you need context explained either in Fate or UBW (heck prob even 06 would suffice)
bad start point
it's watching HF movies with zero knowledge of the fateverse
what i think that cannot be done tho
freaking zouken and his shenanigans
but then you end up spoiling assassin
it's kinda correct what you are saying there
that every fate fan did watch Zero
the others
that HF adaptation came so much after
thing is
that's all
so when people say fate, i just say, go with release order and not chronological
all 3 routes
i don't say it because i'm convinced i'm sure or something but, it's the correct way it's intended. Watching Zero spoils FSN.
imho
it's the most coherent order
and her vessel
anime cut out all the monologues between jeanne
it's surely better
the adaptation just worsened the situation
Fate apocrypha is not golden as LN
Vampires, mysterious powers, ~~mollusks~~, and so on
It's the cool kid
That's why i want more tsukihimeverse content
Nowadays i just grew tired of fateverse bloat
It was awesome
Yea
Since we got nero
But extra doesn't do anything by itself in that way
Ah well
I think that as consequence
Already <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Waifus were a thing in fsn
After fgo: ah yes another one, insertname is getting released
Before fgo: how cool, a servant, i wonder who they are
And killed the magic eerie vibe a servant gave out
Fgo on the other hand overbloated the fate verse
All extra does is adding a bunch of new servants
I do not see extra an huge problem
but it's like one of the big ones
i will retract that statement
okay true
about Fate route
is the ONLY plot point
which
for instance
saber identity
that's why it doesn't give two cents at spoiling
well it was written with the idea that the reader would have fsn knowledge
This is exactly what i'm trying to say
pls higashide you can't do that
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
YGGMILLENIA || KILLING ZOUKEN ||
I started with 06
06 also referred as fate/deen, fate/2006, deen/stay night, can be used as starting point but damages the experience on several levels by spoiling shit, and it's a really bad adaptation. Tho it has to be said that i am not really that fond of fate vn route. It has the worst shirou, most linear plot and some other stuff. The best part about fate was saber/shirou bonding, and the climax
As a person who has read the whole vn i think that while you can start from zero and get *some* boons, doing it in release order shines much brighter. Not having clear details about the events of the fourth war leaves you with mystery in your mouth.
so hype
btw i watched yesterday ep of slime
man misfit is so good
**ANOS VOLDIGOLD**
we got
remember mil
c u l t u r e
!
HAREMS ARE INTERESTING
HEY
the first and the last
again Shana and Aria are the best imho
i don't appreciate taiga
and Taiga... taiga no
coz the show is a comedy parody
Nagi is a meme
oh i didn't read the ln tho
louise is just mean
no pls
screw louise
out of 5 the only 2 i appreciate are Shana and Aria
the issue was the spam
is necessarily bad
the loli tsundere archetype
i don't think
Expecially because it's a 10 year distant lore spoil
It shines less
It drops the mistery factor, which is chopping down part of the deal. But anyways, no one said it becomes bad in this case
Wtb sparks special
Also sparks best ending fight me
But it's not a turn down in fate since you still discover stuff and get hyped, but i felt it was not on the level of ubw, and obviously surely not on hf level which, imho, it's the peak point of the vn
I think that's a personal opinion, you're belittling mistery like that
Also fate has the || threesome with pursuing minds || <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Well that's your fault not the franchise lmao
personal preference goes to asterisk
well i gave 8 to both
i was memeing

I see
Classic gundam
Cybernewtypes?
Good
Seed is the laser show
in gundam franchise
but action and flashy stuff was always there
with few exceptions
every gundam timeline is its own
well fz
child soldiers, genetically enhanced humans, racism, crime wars, nerve gas, forcing enhancement on humans, nazis in space and so on
i'm not surprised rofl
Gundam is always fucked up
Ydw
Kk
Btw btw lexi did you watch terrorist camp boy first movie?
gn
i think i will go reading ngnl and then head to bed
ah sure
btw don't worry about discussing things with me, i wasn't getting angry or something lmao
in alicization
was aiming at
and it helps into connecting where the author
which is more a psychological story than sao
give a shot to accel world
but yeah in the future
basically, talking from anime only perspective (Rare from my part, i like reading novels), the story just improved after kirito stopped doing his bullshit unchecked
but i think that Mother rosario is great as well
yeah PB was a mess
2 v missing from unital ring
btw sao is close to ending
lmao
that's the trick in the name
Alic~~e~~ization
which is a character that lies within "From the bottom to the top" archetype
accel world has the risk of an early drop, mostly because of the protag
but this last part is true in phantom bullet as well
other than Kirito being a powercreep
Well Fairy Dances has the issue of forcing Asuna into a role she's not fit for
(i haven't read, i chose to focus on accel world, which i'm liking a lot)
i don't know up to what you've read
it's the main issue
and Phantom Bullet
Fairy Dances
SAO's issue lies within
Oh i never said that it was fault of the anime or something
I own only aincrad 1 and 2
main one?
<@!250295696714891285> don't worry, i've had that discussion countless times. Each it's own in the end.

movie for now
from Asuna's POV
in a pog way
first 2 arcs but retold
Progressive is basically
(WHICH IS A LIKEABLE CHARACTER HERE)
the true change is after she meets kirito
but from asuna's POV
since the first chapters are more or less the same
it's a bit sad but i understand that it's also to try and convey something different than main novels
yeah
i don't remember progressive starting like that

in 152 countries
CLyoko was distributed
HOLY SHIT
man that stuff was weird lol
topping with the weird costumes in the cgi part in s5
but it stood true till the end
indeed
character design was weird
they went into a panic
when it actually || managed to do it ||
i remember the despair
something down that line
or was it a satellite drop?
it was fucking wild.
heck once XANA tried to do an asteroid drop
btw early plot was basic, nerd and his friend || discover this supercomputer, power it up and boom, they opened the pandora's vase, most sadistic AI ever made got unleashed ||
thankfully they did the right choice
"We do this, or Garage kids?"
was a choice
basically the pilot episode
could have not spawned into the world
you know that code lyoko
it really tryharded to screw those poor kids
it was freaking sadistic
tfw i was cheering for xana
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Xana best character obv
the rest of the cast was pretty okay
not the nerd, the other one
the blond kid
btw i remember disliking
lmao
yes i confirm by searching
italian ver used french opening
If i recall correctly, tho i'm not sure
yeah i heard the french ver
we had it on national tv
i confirm it being CN in Murica
nowadays kids watch dumb cartoons
it was a great show
future skynet™️
confirmed
xana prequel to terminator
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
if XANA got Code Lyoko
Just imagine
yumi
ye
since william also wanted her
it was the girl the issue
Ulrich only liked the jap girl
no fz?
uh
what was the name
no i didn't
uh
it's a piece of my teenhood
again i have to rewatch it
ye true
ah
jeremy got legit kissed at some point
CHECKING WIKI
LOL ODD WAS ITALO-CANADIAN
slowly
s2
^
they didn't know
as s1 goes on
ah well yeah
than her physical age
aelita was older
iirc
AHAHAH
she just takes A LOT of time to figure it out
no come on, Aelita did have mutual feelings
he was smitten by the girl
Chatting with Aelita
that also
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Lyoko ran on linux?
what do you think ppls
lmao
and not a senior programmer
and please remember that he was a middle school kid
hey coding is time hungry
aya i don't remember that
i don't remember that
LOL?
at some point
since xana left the mainframe
with the ship
i remember them going on a trip in the cyberspace
since they messed up and unleashed XANA full potential
Ah Anubis cousin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIDVMcjHKVI jp op
tfw they reversed the ending in the anime
a freaking anime about wrestling driven by comedy
the show is wild
fact: kinnikubuster is banned irl in wwe

the movie was a faithful adaptation

Mouretsu pirates
oooo

Look aincrad was just too much nice
i would give sao an 8
btw rewatching it now
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it doesn't mean they're bad
btw isky just because my tastes are broader
i even got sinon and asuna's figure
i like sao, i elaborated 1k times on that
Bruh no, thank you

Hokuto no ken

East Blue ends at ep 60

i had fun there

err
reason for that is that the ending is og
if you looking at me
tho legit vote would be an 8.5
Charlotte entertained me
i world trigger
now if i have to talk about great battle shonens

with ufotable
it's a regular battle shonen
People overrate kimetsu no yaiba
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

(asterisk has julis, no need for more)

brb 20 min
i can't stand her
also screw stella
but ok
i meant as battle school
i remember that
not the first time
she was naked.
and not in underwear
it was the best one even
*teleports away*
PERIOD
ASTERISK > RAKUDAI
THE TRUTH IS ONLY 1
IN THE END
hey don't insult ecchi harem battol school
it's just coz Ichika is busted
don't overestimate

it was really sad to see that website go
were made by Neregate
these charts
Ah yeah ù
rip
what was that website
Zana
uuuh
the source is pretty good
iirc
Taimadou Gakuen
ah true
Qualidea code is a battle school but no harem
hm
other relevant battle schools
i don't remember
but this is widely whacky and unconfirmed
which uses same kanji and reading
but magic king
it's not demon king
but in truth
they talk about maou
given the setting
funfact about that one
in battle school harem
of chad mc
it's a rare case
Trinity Seven
and his harem
*Arata kun*
bring out
let's go serious
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ARIA (along with shana), is one of two minitsundere who has a core plot reason for being smol
ALSO
i hear saying that
you know you're the second one
lol absolute duo
they wasted nano on that freaking filler
with a really bad mc
Sad crap that AA was completely filler
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
**HYSTERIA MODE**
with "no" magicc
is a great battle school
Hidan no aria
but the anime cut it short
btw as long as i know that one had potential
*Roku*denashi Majutsu Koushi to *Aka*shic records
it's pretty common
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URRcX_RCjTo 
ah yes blow out
there's also rokuaka
btw i have to think about battle schools...
"hurr i got truck-kun'd so i  beat the maou"
you can't show up on me
in the power isekai
i mean i need a twist
i like them both
*air moves sfx*

hey i elaborated on that, sao is only crap at 2nd and 3rd arc

TO LO VE RU
and read the vns
to watch it all
i will someday gather my shit, my courage and what else
but it was also the rise of the maou spam
lmao
come on ichiban was a meme
ghh deito a raabu
ichiban ushiro no daimaou tier
lmao
was overblown
btw the ecchi element in hagure
freaking realization
faylan banger op
RAIDOU
ALSO
lmao
by the author himself
got dropped
hagure yuusha
yeah but
was hagure yuusha no aestetica
another battle school
or should i say *reeks*
of dxd
smells
that arm
on it
fuck they even wasted Altima
Great minds think alike
at that wasted potential movie?
btw serious can i get angry
imho
and it's far superior to sao
wrote by sao author
set in 2045
Accel world is a Cyberpunk virtual world kind of story
no
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't forget
we both read aw ln
serious lmao
and becomes amazing only several volumes later
he slowly improves
he is pretty bad in the first arc
but a close example is Haruyuki Arita from accel world
neither is subaru
i wasn't referring to him
mt mc is not exactly that kind
there are many from the bottom to the top that are not so good characters
it does
archetype of character
that automatically excludes the "From the bottom to the top"
but
don't consider this a critique or anything
Fenny
Am i the only person who can appreciate something while disliking the mc?
expecially freaking subaru
the characters go over changes btw
in both cases
look at shield hero, went off with a boom then morphed into a really bland power fantasy (i have a friend who reads the lns)
yeah but you end up competing with all the rest of the fantasy isekais
it's harder to write
of course
from ours
that differentiate the world
and interesting mechanics
you need bigger twists
Look i-m no writer but i don't think that it would be impossible if an author put his mind into the idea
eh
i see what you mean
but he-s like that for a reason
people whine on the mc too much
oh yes mushoku tensei
i don-t see your point
why not
btw
~~ then there's Knights and magic~~
x_x
you don't need to throw the unlucky teen/young adult in a medieval fantasy setting
with urban fantasies
that isekai could also do great
sad thing is
with romance
sns is a power urban fantasy story
i don't count Hecate, she had || Sydonai ||
SnS is just a mere love triangle
no
not an ln
look at overlord
straight out novels aya
lns i own

i got v14 and v15 here
will reread v13 first go have back context
i will get back to aw as soon as i finish reading ngnl v6
i'm fine with that answer
for so many volumes
hidden for nothing
real name
"SACCHAN"
reki wouldn't have left
well yeah of course there is an aswer
good
lel
it was just an hindsight
i will boil in my broth
pls
but don't
i'm pushing
kk
did you go on shopping aya?
woh
and not only that
look it fits the timeline
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
about KYH being kirito and asuna's daughter
then there is my headcanNon
lmao
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
RLY
AYA PLS
LOL
i remember him writing both at same times
hm was it?
the soul concept
meh
"okay reki is worldbuilding accel world in sao"
the more i saw the outlines
btw the more i analized alicization
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
at them
imagine throwing metatron
yeah
man that scene
in one volume straight.
the one with niko going best girl
signal fire at water's edge
at v13
in i'm on hold
hey don't spoil
also haru in || disaster armor ||
it would have been amazing in the anime
how crazy is that
Volume 5 alone serious
I mean let's just take
they should have just adapted v5+
gah
god ffs
i refused to watch it
REALLY?
WAIT
and the unknown characters
it's all the spoilers
when the anime ended at v4
why the fuck you do make a movie at volume 21
me neither
AND KOTOKO
There one SoL i enjoyed is
exactly...
lmao
they don't count
Isekais are like a drug
i need a twist.
i can't bear to watch a standard high school SoL anime
THANK YOU MAGES.
SLAPPING A 10 ON OCCULTIC;NINE
THEN THERE IS ME

screw nagisa rly
is the whole premise

he enters home
he starts stupid
lank just think of it
the mc is an idiot
even then, i can't

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but but pollution
not actign is better than acting
imho
and it's the morale of the anime
that's the brightest example
the slave girl episode
just think at
she shows empathy, but she can't do stuff most of the times
these are total strangers
why should she?
point is aya
and Steins;____
Anonymous;Code
i'm curious at new MAGES.'s work
btw
i've ever encountered
but it's mind blowing
the objective in mondaiji wasn't unveiled in the anime (only v1 and v2)
i mean
the cool concept
oh yes
are much better
but ofc Izayoi, Asuka and Yo
Shiro and Sora are great
they're "Game"
and games can be crude and really violent
when they fail
and dire consequences
death
Mondaiji's involved
than ngnl's
Mondaiji's concept is more mind blowing
and that's sad
dw i know your take i'm just memeing
Kurousagi 🔥
or this
btw my take when index pops out
she|| owns one|| lel

Bruh https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EO_eWLZXUAEjkTS?format=jpg&name=900x900
that "A Certain" was something the *editor* suggested to add
index is not the mc
it's a set of events that rotates around index.
it's a keyword
is **Toaru** Majutsu no index
the name is not Majutsu no Index
of the westerners
that's a misunderstanding
no noù
but this is major stuff in s3
i'm an huge fan of the light novels and i only cringe at some scenes
again it's an increasingly bad adaptation
well that's fair
s1?
shattering illusions in progress
poor touman
and?
whew
since hey reki went haywire
and that would be also debatable
the only real person in alicization's world is|| kirito himself||
It was a plot related joke
rip ash
is not a real person
the poor ash
that means
animu
well yeah
you might be correct about this
on this aspect
well the anime maybe doesn't step heavily
on purpose
the author wrote little to nothing
note: We don't know much about how touma was before his memory loss
and he acted like he did but in truth it was the first time for him encountering his family
look the angel fall arc is basically made to emphasize this aspect as he encounters his family and doesn't remember them. "Don't you  remember your cousin touma?"
||Regarding his memory loss
So far, only a few people know the truth about Touma's memory loss. They are Heaven Canceller (who took care of Touma after the incident in which he suffered it), Terra of the Left (deduced it from Touma's lack of knowledge about Imagine Breaker), Misaka Mikoto (overheard the conversation between Touma and Terra), Fiamma of the Right, Index (from Fiamma telling her), Kumokawa Seria (she implies this in the Love Letter SS, but it's unclear how she learned of this) and Mitsuari Ayu (she tells Misaki that Touma's memories have been lost beyond their powers, but it's unclear how she learned of this).[27][28] Shokuhou Misaki also knows about Touma's memory loss, but only about the one he suffered after he saved her in the past. Whether she is aware of his last one or not is unknown.||
and he doesn't want people to know about it
that's why it's a big deal
he's a new person
"Kamijou Touma's First death"
that it's regarded as
Hibiki, that memory loss is so major
i don't remember him saying that
iirc
around ep 16
angel fall arc
the anime states this as well
no no
memory wise
he is a blank slate
Angel fall arc makes it clear, he doesn't even remember who his father is
you misunderstood
he lost **all** his memories
no no
what
this gives some sort of existential issue to touma himself who questions this from time to time: "I don't know who kamijou touma was"
can't be reversed
not normal amnesia, his brain cells got burned.
who got his brain fried
i don't know sometimes what people want from a poor high schooler
😂
<@!202444817043685386> i was searching this one the other day
sorry hibiki

zoe brought it up
at some point
this was how broken he got
zoe
btw he attempted || suicide ||
and before someone names subaru, no the respawn guy doesn't hold a candle
other one i miss to remember
one is guts
that suffer like touma did
in the anime industry there are like maybe 1-2 other characters
eh
but this is later on
if not superior
where his pain is compared to guts from berserk
Touma gets on a level
this is why i don't defend him when talking of anime only
it's just plain.
it's not a matter of like and dislike
that's the saddest part
btw Touma lacks of depth in the adaptations
i know
y
lmao his teacher is a meme
Touma, Accelerator and Hamazura Shiage
sometimes even in unison
with 3 main characters
index follows a set of events
hm
this is an official take explained in the afterwords
since he also stated "look man, this is not about index, why this name?"
it wasn't in the name when the author proposed the script back in 2003
ln is the superior mikoto
:'DDD
mikoto making || dirty jokes || there
i was thinking at the same thing
YOU KNOW
HAHAHAH
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
meme made by the community about this (take it with a grain of salt):
and i like her much more than the old mikoto
for example
she completely dropped the tsundere part of her
she chardevved
also late LN mikoto is not railgun mikoto
|| shokuhou and mikoto love the same person (touma) and they actively cooperate to help him, this leads the duo to stick together for lots of time, they become a pair of friends who keeps making jokes about the other continuously (expecially mikoto who literally bullies shokuhou from time to time)||
n
i just noticed i have
from my folder
pretty art

pls
bully
D:
and mikoto should stop being an ass to shokuhou
but the way they act it's just hilarious
they become ||great friends||
it's because how the duo acts
there's a ln reader joke there
i don't like her in railgun
as index ln reader
she's the best girl imho
#5 Lv5
Mental Out
Yeah Misaki Shokuhou
rip animators trying to portray || world being remade on a loop||
when Railgun hits WW3
will do
can't wait to see what kamachi the madman
btw as i've said before
CULTURE
GRIFFLY
HAH
plot starts in july, now we are finally approaching new year eve
and barely 6 months of time passed
22+23+4 volumes
we are at...
this is also why index is also not easy to adapt
best girl denied
indeed
but it's ultra sad
and thus he forgets about her
nt11
misaki || deletes touma's memory when he saves her coz panty shot ||
coz he messed with him years prior
that's misaki's fault
Hold up
yeah yeah you're correct in this argument
in the timeline
but these 5 eps were barely 2 days
if you put it that way, well it's an adaptation issue
so it's ultra early
is Volume 1 epilogue
THat ep 5
a character guessed that thor's mythological hammer was nothing but ib itself manifested in that form
and man ib is sure ancient
hint about IB || being sentient are in s3 when touma orders it to stop while it was going haywire on a rampage ||
infact (spoiler) || imagine breaker is a sentient being, it stood with touma since his birth and IT DOES REMEMBER EVERYTHING, this causes a major huge incident in the last volume of the second set of novels, "I'm the true Kamijou touma, you're only a fake since you don't remember"||
in one volume
so much pain
man i was literally shattering inside during handcuffs volume
true
ah yes
new || magic tree?||
what do you mean
hm
will never forget it
man the contract scene was heartbreaking
|| https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/images/d/d6/Qliphah_Puzzle_545.png/revision/latest?cb=20180702004157 ||
|| a demoness which made a contract with accelerator ||
it's a late novel character
i hope we get more of her
fight me
btw <@!142629493624799232> Qliphah Puzzle 545 2nd best girl
and it's a really sad one
tells kakine's background
it's just 3 chapters
now that's really sad
:3
Dark matter?
<@!142629493624799232> did you read
sad
it's just that i can't since it restricts my view
but please do not take my view as "railgun is bad" because it's also a great manga
the side stories do the impossible to follow the main ln timeline and do not break it at all (see at why frenda didn't answer saten's call)
and what railgun manga does is to tell side stories which revolve around misaka mikoto
arcs
with just a couple of original
to the source
Railgun is pretty faithful
this led me to not like his manga
Accel is the character who evolves the most across the whole thing, reading his manga is a downgrade
but it's heavier there
suffers of a similar defect
and manga
Accelerator in Accelerator's anime
i'm saying that she is pretty plain in railgun, while as LN reader i've seen her evolve (and not only once)
i didn't say she's a bad character
btw that's not what i meant
to boot
and a hypocrite
infact touma *is* a bad person ™️
doesn't mean you are a bad character
Being a bad person
going from embaressed tsundere, to || best stalker in the world ||, to || badass mikoto who realizes what must be done ||
in the ln she has character development
in railgun
she acts the same the whole time
but think of it
i can understand disagreeing
touma was insane there
my fucking god
THAT
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
||A.A.A||
also
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
railgun one is boring
they're too much different
pls
no
????
https://anilist.co/anime/131005/Kyoukai-Senki
i was looking at upcoming anime
I doubt at this point that we can call it miyuki pov
since mahouka kokou no rettosei is pretty good
which is a shame
it's not even funny
everything is far worse than main series
Dumbed down graphical department
Main events completely scrapped away
Useless fanservice
Dumbed down main season character 
2 Relevant characters scrapped away
5/10
A complete disappointment
of mahouka yuutosei
watched last ep
btw
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Ooo pretty sakura up there
lel
personal preferences
again
the climax was huge
but sad you dropped it, this stuff went off with a boom
it's a matter of preferences
oh well they're both nice
so good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIqQPE1tXU0
poor meteora
it was needed or nothing would have made sense
lol
that episode was on point
and i watched it in airing iirc
i don't see the overexposition issue tbh
and the story flew pretty nicely
all the character concepts were interesting
i think it's a great original show
what can i say
lol
no that's not true waht
for 5 eps
people complaining about the anime rightfully slowing down
wait i do remember now
why lol
recreators one of the finest (imho) reverse isekais
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SWVfbYuaac ah so good endings
so good scene
Recreators 🌶️  spoiler ||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDnMLcbPNLc ||
Sumika
Fate Zero does overexposition
i can already imagine the slaughterfests
okay first time i heard these
lmao
now i'm curious
what vns did he write?
i don't follow Kamen rider
and i miss other works in this moment
i did appreciate urobuchi in F/Z even if i'm not 10/10 on it, i liked what urobuchi wrote in fgo lostbelt 3
no
Psycho pass? i increasingly disliked it as it progressed
i just couldn't
i dropped out the series entirely
for example
After watching madoka original season
^
lel
*time to send back urobutcher to madoka*
So yeah it's alright to dislike something, but really nasu is not urobuchi
(rip illyasviel role in the movies)
oh well they had to cut content sadly, but i don't think the plot got that much damaged
look lank, each one of us has its own tastes and i respect that, but Zero wasn't even written by the same author
HF fights other than being rad, it's the plot itself being on whole another level
just another case of "shouldn't start from zero"
let's continue
Lol
imho
true culture ™️ are ubw and hf
but it's nothing more than a battle royale
many overrate zero too much
Zero is urobutcher enjoying his slaughterfest
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
i just can't
but yeah i dislike prillya timeline
lel
more or less
there's no garbage after prillya 1
which is HF on a diet.
you get the movie
then
fuck zouken indeed but that was too much theme breaking
We all know how powerful the ancient fart Is
Apo started to go meme the moment i realized the author made yggmillenia || kill zouken||
Lol apo
also years passed
it's not a dislike why i dropped out
i liked bake
look i will one day give a try to monogatari again
it would require a special to adapt it
of the whole visual novel
which at least i consider the best ending
this is an alternate ending
nah nah zero
yeah
❤️
```Spirit and technique, flawless and firm
Our strength rips the mountains
Our swords split the water
Our names reach the imperial villa
The two of us cannot hold the heavens together.```
Heaven's level culture ™️
it's that moment
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIyNAF5rgYk ||let's go people
*cries*
GIFF A SPECIAL PLS
rip me
will never get adapted
the best part in fateverse
in the end
but how it was handled in the anime
so it was not the discussion per se
in this case
an existential level discussion
it was
man i hated UBW Anime shirou SO MUCH for YEARS
freaking "just because you're correct it doesn't mean you're right"
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
and talk for 24 minutes.
where they stop fighting with weapons drawn
and there is literally one episode
ubw is borked out by Emiya Shirou becoming a damaged main protagonist
i watched only bakemonogatari, i had my fun but i lost interest into wanting to check out the rest of the series
for 48 mins.
(grail war)
walking in circles explaining the freaking seihai sensou
with that 48 mins pilot.
it starts really badly
in zero shows right off the bat
well lank, the main flaw
that it becomes boring
when you do it so much
"Overexposition"
that's why i said
i'm absolutely with you in that take
yeah my bad there
yeah true true
Ah well the anime
eh
tho hold on, is that really a problem if we consider FSN alone?
since again overexposition
yeah it just shows more on zero solo
was so bad
fucking 48 mins pilot episode
it's the main flaw
nep lowest
and some are joke bound
regarding mobs some are recurrent because hey it's the same setting
i disagree
rebirth 1 and 2 and has played first part of rebirth 3
as a person who completed
Look aya
this was more or less a slight problem in first nep
i'm serious
but nep has more than 3 dungeon layout
uh
btw i meant
i don't know what do you pretend from a turn based jrpg
is basically a remaster of a 2007 game
that mainline nep
Aya someone must remember
i had my lots of fun in mainline games
it's time to disagree
like old one
it wont be bs
i hope
NEP
fuck me
notice
i didn't
disasterimminent.jpg
i've come to know that they changed voice actors for muv luv alternative anime
onoz people
that's why i hope they pull out something at least discrete out of that new announcement
compared to the mainline games
my point was that the anime is absolute garbage
I also agree that there is room for improvement dw
Lel
Oh i didn't ask you to stop because i was mad but coz it was wrong channel
we fell oc
but let's stop here
with the megami candidate deal
so far expecially r2
yes?
i don't feel it's a problem there because they managed to make an original plot by also using these references here and there
remember what planeptune, lanstation, lowee and leanbox are...
exists on a reference
Aya the entire multiverse
and it's just silly and idiotic
on that factor
is dumbing down
what the anime does wrongly
why not
well it's comedy
of screenshot
there's a reason if i'm swarmed
is lots of fun
plus the story
and VII
are the 3 rebirths
Mainline canonical rn
That's why i don't care
in 2007
was the og nep
twintails comes in my mind but it's a silly show

Sita where
"lesecret"
solo where is
was introduced to nobility at 18 as a woman
well historically d'eon was genderfluid kinda
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just look at Skadi's myth
was surely a freak
Loki raidou
yeah lmao
- ancient greek myths.
Zeus tried first as a bull, then he failed and tried again as a bird and then he succeeded
Europa contains bestiality in the act...
damn zeus
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
that's wild
do you know of Europa's myth?
Fenny it's not the only || rape|| incident
classic greece
greeks be like <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
since yeah mythology states that Caenis was born as a woman but got genderbent by the gods
but they didn't do it
Caenis
with Caensi
Well they had a shot
oh wait
but i'm 90% sure there's none
i would have to look up the whole list again
iirc
no FTM
redo of healer author ™️
you're the second one who writes it
in my eyes
it completely started with the wrong foot since the trailer
i had any high expectations
well it's not like

You know how freaking terrifying can be pikachu in games?

i hate ash
ghhh
just because yes
don't forget that ash drops high level stuff
<@!202444817043685386> you know me, it's easy to fall into these traps
but we would be talking in circles
Harem Rage is a lovely argument
Lmao
he should be.
or
mind you that ash is what? 16-17 rn?
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
that freaking yellow rat is more important than romance apparently
but he's too much "ichika orimura" to understand them
got several crushes on him
freaking Satoshi
lmao
of course not
or at least this is my take on that
it's a more ethereal connection
it's not necessarily on a romance level
Hilda is MUCH MORE closer to ange
that close.
I don't consider salamandine
harem requires 4 people
in cross ange case
it's a love triangle
no it's not an harem
Well see aya? Each its own, i can't stand that episode, you can't stand || the empress ||
.
ye
10/10
also her manner of speech
that's the charm
more than i did
do whatever, i don't want to discuss it over
whatever people, each its own
my friend just confirmed
i felt something was off
so no.
before knowing.
Except i found the issue
but || empress sama best character || v2
but nothing excessive
Call me whatever, i took a while to think on it and a friend of mine who has read the ln told me there is also a misplacement there
btw
i gave 8.5 to 86 first cour
But i don't have any other complaints
it's not there.
the second to last was the issue.
of s1
i mean not the lastest episode
it got the adaptation jumbled up
meh
but yeah it's pretty good
apart to the s1 last 1-2 episodes
also i'm loving || empress sama ||
was alright
86 episode
in a 20 min or so
I need to watch the episode
or sliced || up arbok ||
is not good thing to show to kids
and no i don't care if showing up || a syringe || into a ryhorn
TRK is really evil
just the plot level was higher
even then solo
instead of satoshi the clown
damn i wished they adapted the manga
i have to catch up
no
lmao
I speak the truth
D:
NOH
tho yellow arc is boring
that's some really good stuff
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

Come on people let's back
"LIKE MIL"
I WAS THINKING
lel
muv luv ones
what about new and outstanding
we know it
all jojo frames
solo will just buy
ho-ho-ho
c u l t u r e
Ryuusei nakao
i got a better one
No no wait solo
give me an autograph from sugita
GL
They let you work with mental images through descriptions
Books can be a lot more powerful than visuals and voices
No no i don't agree with that take
I ended up completely not even checking them if not afterwards
Then there is me doing -2.5 on cgdct
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That captured my interest
Ok
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Sauce fen
K
Isekai maou was oversexualized in the adaptation
Wait what one is that
Btw i saw talking in circles around sao above <:Ver:704169051391524875>
That's what i meant, it's okay to dislike, but one can write an harem and still make it good
And ability of the author to write it
It's personal taste
Harem doesn't equate to bad
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
you missed solo's brilliant review on his first impression
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
THAT AMAZING ANIME
AREN'T YOU EXCITED AYA
LMAO
since it's an hybrid media
but that's a bit different
oh also happened in VNs
tbh
i went crying while reading LNs a couple of times
but i generally dislike it
you can do CGDCT in a good way
oh well that's exaggerated
visual can show you an image
imho
Visual just can't do it
while i'm fairly confident you can do whatever in text
Also there are some things that just... don't work in visual
Look i have this example in my head of a visual novel.

The VN is both acted and had both pictures (like most of them are really)

There was this scene ruling out, at some point i completely ignored the voice acting and the visual aspect (i noticed only near the end) because the whole thing was described in a way that moved me a lot.
~~well i don't like horror~~
and overdescription exists
sure
Of that's a given fen
If the author doesn't describe... well that's a problem
That's exactly what i want from a writing
Depends on how much strong is the author pen wise
pulls out knowledge out the hat and directly applies
that it just looks like that the mc
missed so many details
THe anime apparently
postapocalyptic or scifi isekais, they're pretty rare
you know what we would need
now that i think of it
not that realist hero is bad
i smell realist hero
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and let it run
insert Anos Voldigold in it
Now people take any fantasy isekai
MC who is literally a selfproclaimed Tourist
at some point
i should pick up death march again
bruuuuh death march flashbacks
in the end i just love when an author goes haywire on worldbuilding
and i've explored enough in the variations
but yeah i like isekai a lot
prob 7.5/7
but i should lower it
to both
i gave an 8
i can't express it
meh
i don't dislike it but
i don't like konosuba
apart from magic
and the world is pretty realistic
it's basically a SoL isekai with a very low degree of action
i like this one a lot
in this case it's the author doing stuff on purpose, since the chapters names have similar vibe
i read the WN
short name of https://www.novelupdates.com/series/not-sure-but-it-looks-like-i-got-reincarnated-in-another-world/
i
it's not sure, iseka
yet
no anime
also i like the worldbuilding in it a lot
|| Licorice || pls
and lmao the author naming rico
Ren ❤️
is so good.
btw not sure isekai
ange?
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
now y'all go watch index and rate touma like he should be rated
Good kids
well today is a good day ™️

i will try and try to not cringe only after having played unlimited and alternative
i'm just avoiding it
i want the goodies

AND
and the heroines are likeable
i like the mc anyways
but it smells something went wrong
it's not bad
So he's chill with it
"Poligamy: Yes for both genders"
by stating
well the author did place a stamp opening forcefully that door
Regarding the harem route
he doesn't have 12 different degrees
ffs
he's a 18 years old young man
while it seems that in the novels he just suggests stuff
Rebecca is better than lucy under every aspect i can think of

their choice on how to animate shiki's attack is cultured
btw <@!202444817043685386> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MXtLKAUI-E
focusing more on the characters than the fights
than a battle shonen
but it works more as a space opera
i mean... it's surely a battle shonen
My friend complained about EZ regarding the fights being not the main focus
rip
He passed away at the last episode airing
without (i think) skipping nothing
it covered quite an heft for 25 eps
till Madame Kurenai Arc
was a really good adaptation
btw EZ first cour
apart from the 2 banger openings
only complaint about ez is the unremarkable soundtracks
sadly
nott him
i insta spot him
and his folk metal shenanigans

Millhi wants to go into an isekai
they just shrug it off
there's also log horizon, where in the end the ||main group || thinks that it's not a question to be posed off
that's not true
meh
that's all
does a different world/dimension exist? does the main character have something to do with said place?
look it's so simple
it's not "getting isekai'd" but it's still an isekai
isekai just means different world
hm going isekai on purpose or not is not a requirement

that one is freaking awesome

with that statement
i definitely agree
2000 years before us
they rated waifus
go blame imperial china
look fenny
ghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Using his knowledge gained from school and from his solar-powered smartphone, he has the chance to bring the Wolf Clan, the same people who cared for him, to prominence, all while earning the adoration of a group of magic-wielding warrior maidens known as the Einherjar.
pls the harem is cultured
is a freaking brat
the childhood friend
his harem is fucking awesome, but no he prefers to make late night calls with his childhood friend
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it's this one
https://myanimelist.net/anime/37446/Hyakuren_no_Haou_to_Seiyaku_no_Valkyria
he just uses it as info source
it's not that one
goes on wikipedia
his smartphone
takes up
He literally
He is not a genius.
come on people there is that isekai where the mc just pulls out advanced knowledge from wikipedia in a bronze age world. He got an harem but he ignores it for his idiotic childhood friend of his, who is in the og world.
Actually? This is correct, but for other reasons
who said that mondaiji is dog days knock off
there is a friend of mine
You know mil
lel
but sure
there is worse
and get his harem
True true, the og artist expressed that too well

this is great.
nadesico ep 1
i watched
bad one
and all you have to watch is 2 series
but that's the bad fate
in deen/stay night
oh shit, i didn't remember shirou finding out about || the soon to be corpses || under kirei's church
from Fate
and this was the kinda legit scenes
yeha
<@!279341087494242304> this brings up nostalgia somehow

9/10
nadesico ep 2 so far
maaaaaaaaaaan
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Onoz carlos and teekyu
instead they're in 3-4
that would requires 6-8 episodes
are so heavy
expecially the last 3 adapted volumes
whereas s1 and s2 are 7 volumes each
crammed into 24 episodes.
has 10 volumes
infact season 3
the rushed <@!453836798796234762> 
it's that they paced it in the worst possible way
btw regarding
is*
millhi it's right
lel
ah
millhi there's no original content in index
expecially the season 3
it's super rushed
Master example is the complete opposite view of one of the 3 main characters rating, anime only hate him, ln readers deem him a 10/10 chad
Railgun is a series of parallel canonical (fuck silent party, that doesn't count) events/side stories to index.
Index was increasingly badly adapted, the source is a 48 volumes ongoing and an amazing masterpiece. But they failed on so many fronts in adapting it that the anime is first sightly above average and then ends far below average, and it covers the first 22 volumes in merely 24*3 episodes.
straight to the point
btw carlos i hit the iron directly
carlos mentioned toaru
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
ghhhhhh
then the cake on the tatami
then the middle of the night slap
just by looking at how the mc handles the fruit juice
it starts wrong from ep 1
on how much bad it could get
it was a challenge with my friends
butt in oreimo's case
i usually drop what i dislike
it was pain
https://puu.sh/IlyUy/d38bf55073.png

the rest is a garbage
so kuroneko and ayase episodes
oreimo is decent only when kirino is not around

i hear sounds of people talking about zoomer anime
as romcom.
extra is really good
WHERE IS MY GP02 HAIR
ALSO COMON
it's enraging because i really liked extra and i'm liking unlimited
i'm getting so much pissed about this lmao
....
not nowadays ones
that's how you do a romcom
where is my extra adaptation?
hey hey mil
the anime removed the explanations
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hey don't call index bs, the magic system is ultra accurate and 100% explained
but the cause is what he stated^
is a consequence
what you're feeling
except/ yeah this+
~~insert not!tsubasa here~~
are amazing, deep and unique
when muv luv characters
^
also i don't like that graphical design
there's no context whatsoever
imagine following a story from the last third
of the series.
which is the 3rd and last installment
they completely failed from the premise of adapting Alternative only
this is important to note out
muv luv is adapted from a visual novel
grimgar also did 12 episodes in 1 volume
don't feel forced, sadly it is what it is
gn carlos

subjp

yes...
REMOVE IT PLS
THE MOTION BLUR
i liked it all except for one damn detail
lol
s2 incoming
btw it has not ended
oooo
Mal interface is old and needs to be reworked

Since it's so rare
Don't even bother
When that happens i update it manually
Old batches tend to cause this issue
Weird naming
I just open and close it, boule set it up that way
Note: i don't let it run in bg
If you watch stuff every now and then
Oh well it's understandable you find it not very useful
Api key
That it doesn't ask any login, it wants mal/anilist
Important to be noted
I have the update button turned on
That's an option
Hello 10 years old batches
Expecially if weird naming is involved
Also yes the program needs to understand the first episode
Ofc
Ah now it explains it
This is what i meant
Hm, some setting i haven't been aware of?
100% open source
Not sus
It's not a keylogger
How it would detect otherwise
No boule lol
?
It detects the episodes on the hdd automatically if you set it up that way
With taiga, i open it, boot the episode, click update, close it
Coz that would require me to open the  browser, go on the website, load the page, eventually login, and only then update the list
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Plus it's interface is so clean that it should be illegal
Then close it
Ah i just open it when it's anime time
Btw you can edit your list, make it automatically ypdate it and|| it tells you about torrents if you wish ||
It was not related
I know boule
https://taiga.moe/
It's amazingly comfy
Also ppls go check out Taiga if you haven't
Expecially since i started using Taiga
But I don't care about that
On voting
Also <@722121666641133608> anilist tends to be a bit stricter sometimes
I do admit that mal is a better source of information
And thus better compatibility with 3rd party stuff
Api
Interface
I trail
And discuss stupid topics
To watch me rise dust
Firezero just loves
🤌
Go isky code it for linux
True
Ofc you need to let it run in bg for that, which i don't
Bless of open source
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Then there is me on taiga getting " look bruh ||new torrent|| of random anime has been uploaded"
I don't remember
Uh
You can now yes
I just can't
Again lily , if you find mal more comfortable it's okay
Yy it's the rare weird naming deal
Weird naming
Aaah
Never happened to me
Lol wtf
In anilist is pretty easy to detect it
Under the pile of clutter
In mal they are buried
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Since other worlds/dimensions are involved
Also it's a scifi setting with isekai elements
Lel
He is pretty egoistical
Only for himself, no one else
He does what he does
Also he openly stated
He is a tactician
His body is subpar
And intellect
Is his wits
In this case all the main character has
The main character is a "noob in training"
No powerups
There are no powers
For example
Has stuff that breaks the archetype and goes in the other direction
Now world trigger qualifies as such but
A generic one
Ye that's a battle shonen
Hmmm
Shonen anime like
Do you know
Ghhh
World trigger is a "battle shonen with anti shonen characteristics"
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>

come on mil
i'm fine with either

he's just what he is, and his background 99% justifies him
i don't have an issue with rudy being that way
come on
it looks like people putting lewd mods in skyrim
out of place.
completely
i repeat
that || bikini armor || is completely
Ah yes
lel
It seems like the anime puts **all the budget** in some scenes, then it completely dries out during the rest of the airtime
the rest is still a disaster
but even if ignore it
i just don't like it
i let Anos Voldigold do it
if i want constant action
screw that
plot wise and character wise the anime has been really good and i agree with aya
😦
hey you can't have constant action ash
i watched a 1080p rip
**the goddamn graphic department is flying into the toiler**
even while ignoring the film grain (which i deem horrible), the animations are low frame, static and the characters are blurred. I can say that the only good part under this aspect was || Paul reuniting with our boy ™️ , and Eris's black eye <:Ver:704169051391524875>  ||

<:Ver:704169051391524875>
lmao mil
and i saw my great share of isekais
but it's good
it's a good isekai, nothing special as people claim about
in mushoku
i don't see what you deem as trash
pls mil
i found it pretty good
who all use some kind of weird direction to push the story
and some others
of the good stuff nowadays we have titles like grimgar, overlord, gate, knights and magic ( i wont list slime because it is effectively a light hearted OL knockoff, even if i like it a lot)
more than bad, is already seen
and i agree it's bad
exists
but the classic example you made
ah oke lel
i'm not trying to be toxic
sorry mel lol
i don't agree on the better entries
nah
it penalizes good stuff
i don't like that point of view
but you have to dodge the bad staple stuff
there is good and great stuff nowadays as well
^
the classic "isekai cheat magician" and dumb cousins
trying to avoid
anyways what i do is just to search for the stuff that catches my eye
i will give you that
but it's good
the isekai label wasn't even there
current industry standard
is not
Digimon
I think that just because that's the tendency in the current industry, it's to be considered false to apply such statement to the whole category
oh the worldbuilding can be insane
i think it's the gimmick that makes the difference nowadays
i reckon
Inuyasha is a few decades old
but the true definition is no means bound by that
in current marketing
that's core to the "power fantasy isekai"
with boring mc
ignore the power fantasy staple
there are so many different isekais
why?
but
nah
and lol mel
You can't change the truth millhi ™️
And another reason to remind that asterisk is better than rakudai
Old but gold
Hah that
you can always go gilgamesh
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well there is || lelei who shot **swords** at the dragon then electrocuted ||
in the other world
|| done ✅ ||
artillery strike
|| bring down a dragon with an rpg ||
then there is gate <:Ver:704169051391524875>
but that one is necessary for the plot
The boring part in LH is the kids arc
thus i approve
but LH is 75% politics 15% cute girls 10% action
then there is log horizon, ||faking to not be an isekai > reveals itself as isekai||
but in that case i feel that the isekai label doesn't damage the product at all
one that could ignore the isekai mark and just work is Overlord. At least in the anime, Ainz could have been the Overlord and the other superior beings just be some past dead beings
but i just think that it's rezero too much pivoted to be changed without big changes
that's a valid point
but subaru is cringe on purpose just because of that
i wouldn't be the same with a local
and regarding rezero, if the author wanted the poor 18 years old hikikomori to be victim of despair in another world you can't really change it
about that one
ah i don't know
paladin?
™️
Ernie builds magical mechs
i smell isekai maou there lmao
deen/stay night would be fresh talk
ignoring the zoomer anime
and VNS
talking of mid 2000s shows

lmao
eh i guess
Well that's natural serious
then i will be all settled

Maou Sadao likes this element
That's all
In the plot
Tldr the story just doesn't focus on the mass murder point because it was not the author intention, he wanted to take care of other matters
As i would say, give what's caesar's to caesar
Who is going to get an engineer degree
And guess what kirito is a tech nerd
Which || gets used for medical applications later on and to develop bottom - top ai ||
Evil, not evil, crazy or not crazy he was a genius scientist who created fulldive tech for the first time in sao-aw universe
Not the person himself
What is appreciated is his creation
Assuming kirito likes him is kinda wrong, it's more like he goes neutral and wants to go forward with life
Sao focuses on him later on
He was a deranged psychopath
Well he did commit suicide

if you want to end there and stay in your little world sure
but side
not filler (except silent party)
side stories
people railgun is just a bunch of events that are aligned up in the timeline, it's like 6 things vs 30
it's other 9/10
it's not other half
but still huge
a great one
Now this is a statement that can be correct lmao.
Following index LN is an huge journey
and see them from different perspectives
in the timeline
so you can enjoy the cross events
raildex as a whole
btw nothing says you can't read both works
and touma is just a bad person ™️
nah the second is one of the greatest anti heroes written in recent LN works
not 1
male mcs
but index has 3
i will read it someday
but i've hearing really good opinions about the LN
but they're there
The anime has its own defects, not huge as index ones
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so it's fine
lank doesn't like whatever i like
guy is op but can't unleash shit or his family will leash on him
with all the twists
i think that mahouka strenght is the backplot
and has been adapted in a messy order
and so on
including *superdetailed* magic explanations (thus world building), main character personality
btw by what i know mahouka is ultra detailed in the light novel, the anime lost some stuff
expecially in this case where the genre was already explored
it's not your average ln accomplishment
Yeah but you understand that selling at the level that sao did
in the past @ln
sales have been on pair vs sao
of battle schools
mahouka is in the top tier
no
Lol
????
they just didn't experiment with other stuff
since fz linked it
is mahouka
without harem component
another battle school
yet
have an harem
doesn't

at the same time

who the heck writes
lmao
and also mad
it's so detailed that i'm convinced the author is a sorceror
kabbalah, thelema, and so on
is irl based.
is that the whole magic lore
one of the pros of the index novels
lemme shatter your illusions
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
||Mikoto wants touma and Misaki is closer to mikoto than kuroko wishes she is||
but no romance is inherently put as theme
sure female characters want other male ones
sure there is a couple
0.
index *doesn't* have romance
btw just to be clear
you're contradicting yourself
candies?
what is this?
if this isn't density
1 day 3 volumes
lank, i repeat again
red is canon railgun event
there goes your even density
https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/images/7/7d/A_Certain_Unified_Calendar.png
one of the reasons because index events got jumbled up in the anime, is that they were hard to adapt because of the timeframes. There is more than one arc that follows 3 groups of characters in quick rapid fire succession.
lank
depending on the timeframes
the author has to treat things differently
that looms in background
because of a major backplot
shit goes flying in every event
they're all ultradense
t
this is the poin
it does
there is no time skip
i went back to reread
"wtf are they talking about"
i a backlash a few volumes later
There was one arc i didn't understand in the novels
Because every event is not old
That there is a constant "Cause-Consequence"
in 6 months
46 volumes
**6**
happens in 6 months
index plotline
No lank, remember that
Railgun is more linear
it's a really complex web
you gonna go "what the shit is happening" later on
infact if you remove even one
related
**very strongly**
they're all
Lank
murdered arc is murdered
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i challenge whoever has not read the novels to understand Battle Royale arc
"emiya shirou effect"
who is a really deep character
btw index poorly delivered the events and dumbed down the poor touma
Author is an irl sorceror ™️
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

Fate shirou is just cursed, even in the source
Hf shirou resists because he's fundamentally a better character
Lots of monologues vanished into thin air
Ubw shirou got dumbed down
dw it's fine
I absolutely agree, the anime dumbed down him a lot. btw i wasn't comparing Shirou  to Touma. i was saying that he got dumbed down like shirou did
because of that
and his suffering levels are off the charts
He keeps getting roped in
<@!262326868366065664>
Touma is a selfish high schooler who just wanted to live his life. He was thrown into utter chaos, had his || memory || completely erased (brain cell destruction) and continuously questions who he is. The gig about early touma revolves around "You're living your life incorrectly", he enforces what *he thinks* is right, and he is absolutely arrogant and a bad person. Imagine Breaker is a superior entity with || self awareness and all || which in touma's case has the power of negating the supernatural.
but whatever

*before* the isekai wave even became a thing
it's an isekai
Original run    2006 – 2009
is old
also og gate
further back you go
but the sources are increasingly heavier
the anime just washes overit
or you just don't
so it's either you like that kind of stuff
tl;dr i understand not liking gate because it has a very specific tone
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
that includes one || of the characters snapping at the otherworlder ruler because he insulted the japanese emperor ||
OG novel is the weird ass deal
and re-edited
remember gate got re-printed
btw derek
and military hardware
gun
into describing
he also goes into detail
and he *actively* advises the reader in the afterwords to not compare real military with what he writes
the author *used to be* a JSDF soldier
But friendly reminder
the anime has a very light tone in the end
is the source
the true nationalist gate
ah
nothing extraordinary
he's pretty good
but other than that
ah that well alright legit point. can't tell you anything lel

Undefeated bahamuth?
I was discussing a bit with some ppls in another discord regarding Toaru Kagaku no Railgun manga, there's chance that will just end after the current arc or shortly after it because it seems the mangaka is tired of doing so and kamachi ended ideas for railgun. (Other than the fact that mikoto *actively* becomes involved in the main novels plotline in the current point of the timeline)
Cultured anime
It lasts just a couple of vols luckily
And it is far from the most interesting thing
Issue is that (personally) kamisato arc lies in between
And gt is really great so far
Just mind blowing
Nt19-22r is the best part of nt

Is once again renewed
and she's seen || hell, the cruelmost volume of the whole series ||
hell she's the protag of one entire volume
only in Genesis testament
she becomes a really nice character
(OT)
even in the first set of Index novels
i can't stand her
is obnoxious in Railgun
Kuroko
expecially when she turns serious and finally cooperates with touma
btw i'm reading last index volume, whew shirai kuroko as deuteronist of the volume is just 10/10
wonderfully
they outdid you
get bonked lank
where do i sign
ISEKAI?!
PLANT
and i got hooked.
"look bro, cool show"
i discovered it thanks to my little brother
like in 2006?
well it went airing in italy
4* seasons
for a grand total of 97 eps
5 seasons.
Original release    3 September 2003 –
10 November 2007
but aged really well
is **old**
Well code lyoko
i'm checking them out
models improved overtime
bruh the
this insigna is so simple yet so menacing
you're fucked.
and bam
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/codelyoko/images/5/50/X.A.N.A..jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111220205517 this pops out
i ignore that.
no pls
in the virtual world
and i liked the CG graphics
it was really good
man i should give a rewatch
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Xana = Skynet
but yeah change my mind, Code Lyoko endingg badly is just Terminator prequel
it gave xana a voice
neat character that one too
William
Yes
but || turns sides and helps xana||
the guy who gets added later on
oh yeah i'm missing
10/10
it went rad on *middle schoolers*
fucking brutal
See? this is what i'm talking about
Aelita has her charms
Yumi is the cool japanese gal
Odd is a dumbass
Jeremy is a nerd who tryhards, Ulrich is your average middle schooler
is Odd
the only one i don't really like
i think the main cast was also neat
btw other than liking Xana as voiceless yet brutal villain
so the authors had european knowledge
is french
well the cartoon
yep
silk and stuff
they were employed in painting clothes
Arte dei tintori = Medieval Corporation active in Florence
The name derives from a madder dye that is red, so it is thought that the family, documented in the city since the 13th century, was a family belonging to the Arte dei Tintori.
it means "From the reds"
it's actually an italian surname
it's not italianish
nvm
It's italian-ish
Odd della robbia
lmao
in the mcs

second one he was trying to look cool in front of aelita but he lied
first one we don't see it

He claims to have done so twice
he did?
lmao
but we don't see it
reminder that jeremy logged in just once
the ship
yer
i miss to remember
or was it end of s3?
that's when Xana goes over the internet
but what about after aelita || gets back to irl ||
it was for Aelita early on
why they couldn't shut down the supercomputer
I miss to remember
hah it was funny when aelita got systematically angry at him
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Aelita
he nearly ended the world
someone stop jeremy ffs
this goes on for the first 2 seasons
Jeremy fucks around > XANA Goes monke > They try to stop Xana > Xana tries to kill them > They Lock out xana with the towers.
was more or less
every ep
but it didn't feel like that.
if you boil it down, the concept was pretty repetitive
i doubt that nowadays industry could nail such show that well
to split the graphics
i think it was an amazing decision
Ulrich how can you get the name of your crush wrong
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yumi Ishiyama, mistakenly called "Yuri" by Ulrich, is virtualized in the Ice Sector, where the very first activated tower is
robbed of newtype powers
rip odd
GJ
PLOT REASONS
As the Supercomputer was updated, Odd lost his ability to see into the future. In its place, he can project a small, light purple energy shield in front of himself
OH FZ
Lyoko's CGI is revamped, making it look a lot brighter than in the first season
revamps CG
S2 actually already
oh
Glad the took Lyoko path
Garage Kids
could have given birth to something else
that code lyoko pilot episode
btw did you know
well prob the author noticed it was plot breaking
i also forgot.
s1 only
odd please
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
A NEWTYPE?!
Odd Della Robbia's only ability on Lyoko is "future flash", allowing to see imminent danger to his friends or hidden paths. It is used only in four episodes and is lost after this season
LOL
WAIT
neolatin language to neolatin
well actually it would have been a challenge to fail an italian dub of a French Cartoon
for what i remember
was decent
ITalian dub

if you want

Let us know then
Lel
Told in 1979
Since it takes place parallel to the main story
Free to give 08th a try but you will feel a bit confused
00 is 2009 , iron blooded is 2015
In 90% of its shows
Gundam is a gritty real robot
Are also grounded down
Iron blooded and 00
https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b0/4c/8e/b04c8ebf6c09bd7a58bbac58304303a9.jpg
Or 00
Like iron blooded orphans
If you want to try a first time approach to the franchise i suggest something outside uc timeline
<@228659769404030976>  08 is nice. But it tells a parallel story of first gundam 0079
I agree lol
On the vol
Btw what is your take so far
Lmao
99% of the times.
and rots.
it goes bad
every time something strays too much
i can't agree
mah
and i find a pretty neat adaptation
mondaiji is like 1;0,95 to the source (v1+v2)
it was 1:1
thing
other than the "just v1"
I honestly think that there was no compromise reached in grimgar
to work adapted 1:1
freaking heaven's feel
of course you can't expect
depends on the work of art
so wt are you saying mil
it went greatt tho
of 1:1 adaptations
Grimoire of Zero and Grimgar are a good example
lies.
sadly
the film is not 1:1
and he's more human
since he doesn't have the same attitude
in progressive
Also kirito is likeable
not viceversa
Progressive LN has asuna as MC and kirito as deuteronist
lol
Prog source is prob the second best thing reki wrote
mil
no
it's sad because
they went original
ye
but i checked out progressive source and it's great
can't judge
haven't watched it yet
progressive?
What one
Fairy Dances is bad because the damsel in distress trope is not interesting anymore and Asuna **doesn't** fit the role since she's a strong female character. GGO is fucked up because Kirito breaks the arc alone.
it's not bad per se
SAO has a stigma because of 2 bad arcs
and starts understand where to go
Alicization is the part where the author wakes up from slumber (Mother rosario is good imho anyways)

btw
i have to finish world trigger 3
it's ok, **don't be afraid**
<@!279341087494242304> they said psychological horror
Some people hate it just because prejudice or its artstyle (mimicks certain fairy tail characters)
The anime has great graphics
Ez is basically hiro mashima recognizing his past mistakes and writing a cool space opera manga
it's freaking awesome
World trigger is just underrated

GT is just updraft, i told you
you get GT03 aftermath there
want to get onto GT05
absolutely great
gl
heh alice intensifies
What mango?
3) the author seems to have finished the ideas and will soon hit the lock imposed by following the main novels
2) price falling
1) mangaka getting bored
Several reasons as well
about this
we have several proofs
gonna end
railgun
- fumbles on science
- has studied irl esoteric systems and many religions, knows about magic practices too
- writes 6 lns in unison
- gets asked about a short script for a 12 ep anime > presents 3 huge manuscripts shit scaring the director
- nothing he writes is "Normal"
and i fucking bet he's an irl wizard
tho you lose a lot, the author is just amazing
22+23+5
the journey is pretty long
a bit of a shame, but i can understand, expecially in Index case
i see
where did you read up to agent?
eeeh yeah
keep reading, the volume goes in a really unique direction
LOL
in t he volume?
where you at
LMAO
AH YES
i lost ya there
???
it's unfair
does him so badly
i will never end stating that the anime adaptation
led touma to be one of the most suffering characters in anime industry
hilarious how his bad luck
<:Ver:704169051391524875> poor touma, only suffering for him
that's the joke lel
lmao
you're 14 ffs
stop smoking styl
lmao styl
Mugino went monkey
the reason
it's escalating when you realize
||frenda got murdered that day, saten will never meet her again||
you get why
If you watch/read index
in railgun Frenda doesn't || go to Saten's house and doesn't get her calls ||
there is one interesting event i always point out
it's all straight lel
Hey here there's no fuckedup timeline
But that thing i linked shows how railgun and Index interact eachother
i never said "read index"
it-s a long journey
No i already premised
you need to open it
it-s hq picx
50 volumes
6 months
timeline
Raildex
i love linking this
❤️
https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/images/7/7d/A_Certain_Unified_Calendar.png
i fucking hope that New testament (future index 4) doesn't get an hardfail again
infact New testament didn't get an english license yet
but it's less known in the west than sao
Index is huge
since Index anime is subpar decreasing quality adaptation
and i can't blame it
it's many people entry point
after hopping onto main ln
you feel constrained
but yeah the journey is really incredible, i can't appreciate railgun, even if it's still a nice read/watch just because it's restricted
misaka worst is misaka best 
- a very biased fan
but anyways
@_@
and started speaking.
Mikoto, 10032, LO met up
There is one scene in the novels that's a dread to read
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
but yeah index novels <@!280436741549326347> are something a bit unique as a journey, other than being really long. It has a couple of lows but hey, whatt doesn't have a low when is a long running series? The mind blowing thing that currectly with 50 volumes we are at 27 december in timeline when volume 1 was set in july
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
future self-promised accel wife
heh LO
because nothing is left unexplained in the novels
at explaining stuff
the anime fails
he's controlling electrons one by one
that's clearly not a motion vector.
last order brain
remember he rewrites
he can control any kind of vector.
no?
?
so anyways yeah
⌛
"is time a vector?"
talking about for hours
you end up with people with science degrees
in an index thread
this is a dangerous question no one should ever pose
the issue with the description is "what is considered a vector"
in a way that "controls vectors"
The author wrote Accelerator's Power
lmao
trust me he wont drop it
ash he is writing Index since 2003
index lns are something else
we don't know
no more tsundere
c h a r d e v
ah also index has improved mikoto
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

if one has a question t here are 2 cases: 
1) already explained
2) will be explained
js
there's no plot hole
you can't get it at all
and of course if i link something out the blue
let's say that the events are all more or less connected
index is not about "complexity" of understanding
but
can't argue with that
lel
i'm not lying ash
New testament
and it closes
wont say it, it's the whole boom of that volume
heh
and || that's not kamijou touma btw ||
these are normal dresses

index 1
it's ep 5
yes
a chunk of his brain went poof
episode 5
No he lost them once
|| the moment misaki steps out the door, she disappears from touma's mind completely ||
|| misaki loves touma to no end, she's met him waaaaaaaay before mikoto did, but touma will *never* remember her for several reasons ||
of another kind
but
uuuh yes there is suffering
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!761405600919584789> https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/images/1/15/Souyaku_Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_Light_Novel_v02_cover.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200613145721 do you prefer this
Judgement desu no
she even cooperates with touma (still has to figure why she can't teleport touma tho <:Ver:704169051391524875> )
Trust me she has some insane levels of mental fortitude
|| gt03 is a volume where mass murders appear and she gets deepily involved, suffering is everywhere and the situation is out of control, the cover represents the light side (kuroko) when it meets the dark side (hamazura) ||
and she-s seen shit.
absolutely not
volume 48
GT03 cover
❤️
this?
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/images/0/0d/Souyaku_Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_Light_Novel_v03_cover.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20201024103513
she's ultra serious
and Kuroko is a great character **the moment** you separate her from mikoto
Kuroko has other stuff that keep her occupied
and she becomes || mikoto best friend ||
she's awesome and probably the best index girl, main novels wise
She's not a villain at all
point.
Misaki controls the fluids in the brain
in the main novels
and relevant
and she becomes more and more awesome
she's an amazing character
**Misaki shokuhou**
is
Btw one reason to read index
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

<@!279341087494242304> purging my hdd i found this
while purging my folder i found this lmao
it was a pleasure
have a good time
okay
yet
We don't have complete explanation
You **really** don't want that
The real issue is if || IB goes berserk and refuses to listen touma||
not plot armor
It's
and no || touma encounters literal gods, they crushed ib ||
it can't negate natural things like Ley Lines
can negate supernatural events that should not be there
Touma's Imagine Breaker
Btw
there's an in lore theory, unconfirmed, stating that IB was thor's hammer
It's Odin's Spear
but anyways
my boy || gungnir exists in toaruverse||
speak child
|| touma orders IB to stay put and it regrows his arm, vs Fiamma, Season 3 ||
S3 hints that
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
|| imagine breaker is sentient, you don't want to rip off his arm ||
|| and every time it got bad ||
Touma lost his right arm too many times
he's not a first year
TOuma is 16
NO DON'T
i'm sorry for that jboggs
or you get only confused
you have to
YES
too many absences
a year
Touma is getting held back
the last 8 volumes are the best he ever written imho
lmao
because it's the reverse
but one can't even say "look it's dropping in quality"
in index case it will end when the author decides it's time to end the mental trips
the plot gets reopened by some kind of trigger
New Testament ends
Old Testament ends
is that the sets of novels do have an ending
No point about to aru
New testament was supposed to end, it ended but he started writing Genesis Testament
where is ichika orimura
solo
but anything else that falls out the line has potential
that is overdone and boring
battle shonen
that it's the main commercial
let's say
noragami is not a proper shonen
done dirty by first season low budget
a freaking underrated gem
is World Trigger
shonen anime
btw a good
anyways
precure s1 was top tier
bruuuh
now that is a really interesting shonen
nailed Eden's zero
i think that Hiro mashima
more than that
it's not a real sequel
hmmm Fairy Tail 100 Years quest manga is just something that exists
was low tier
anything before tenroujima
with some highs (oracion seis and Phantom lord were good)
pls mil
????
of the whole series
being the first third
fairy tail has one issue
uh
it's okay-ish
D:
come on
fairy tail doesn't have a shit ending
uh
come on.
was used twice at best
the bad cgi

Yeah he's fucking obnoxious
Rgarding kirito in other arcs
For accel world
Also alicization grounds down several concepts
Then sao is done
Is Unital Ring
Next and last arc
Yeah alicization is really good
I am trying to say that in every sao discussion
See?
"scrapped idea"
Excalibur the more sao progresses and the more smells like "here i am, an arc created to lay groundwork for some cool shit afterwards, but i end up forgotten"
But it went okay there since he doesn't do shit
|| "no please don't find a solution to save zekken, just don't, doctors can't, you are just an engineer student"||
In mother rosario i was shitscared every time he popped up
Ruining the arc
And he is just a powercreep in phantom bullet
He plays the knight that saves the damsel in distress, an overdone trope done poorly
It's a disaster
But starting from fairy dances
S1 he could be considered okayish even if he went edge
Kamachi fucked up us for good
Hehehe

I will
🤡
Not that shit tier mess they did back then
Can i haz a retry on umineko?
Solo
Nooooo
Failed...?
That 7th expansion
So you are telling me
Good?
Sotsu and gou
Weren't
but it was left on purpose hazy
really early in volume 2
something was hinted
but even then
that's till the 20th volume
lmao
thus nerfing it
we know that it reverts things back to the state they were supposed to be, that's related to dragons, ||that's sentient and has its own will || and that touma's is not using it in the proper way
while progressing with the plot
but yeah IB is really really interesting because the author shows us pieces of its lore slowly
ye ofc
of ib
will be the host
another person or object
once for all
if touma finally dies
<@!202444817043685386> i think you know what happens
yep
likes to show
that the illustrator
it's the glass shattering thing
y
there is an hint of it being in Thor's Hammer in mythology
or in a object
it could have been in a person
but what about before touma was born?
it exists only one imagine breaker
just touma *currently*
|| the entire gakuen toshi exists only for the purpose of attracting imagine breaker once again ||
complex lore
if something that happens in the early 1900s didn't happen, the thing wouldn't have gotten its way to touma
not touma's
it's not overpowered at all
once
it can restore things like they were
It's connected to the "Original World"
no
with that name on top of it
lmao
this was mentioned like once
"it negates the strings of fate"
we both know that
to explain IB
it's not easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRtAksSywfI
and low frame
fuzzy
the rest of the 23 mins? low budget
Mushoku tensei = budget on 20 seconds
Here
Me?
Just wish for a new world
But sure you will see by yourself
They are underwhelming
I wont hide that i don't like nt 14-16 that much
It's just that it got surpassed imho
Othinus is still 10/10
Don't misunderstand me
Hardcore
He blasted himself
Best arc is nt 19-22r
It's not the best arc
👌 👌
You got othinus arc in your face
Go catch up
Kk
Btw where you at?
He is a monster
Yep
That's the charm
Lmao
To get it
And watch the anime
Had to reread it
I had same experience with OT19
Freaking kamachi
He stretches the dynamics of a light novel
The pacing is really wild and stuff is hard to follow sometimes
I can understand what you mean
You missing wild stuff bruh
51th volume
Gt06
It's the new upcoming volume
We don't know yet
Oh my god
this is why i don't get bored
come in many lights aand colors
i think that isekai
food
heh
Qtqt
Eucliwood hellscythe
Ooooooo
Perfectly
I have an headcanon where most isekai fantasy/maou shows just fit slime world
Funfact aya
Good examples
Am i the only one who gets amazed by worldbuilding as a whole?
please yes
top
oooo
Shit wording
Neither i like it
I don't dislike it
Nadesico is a weird show
Black sarena where
what happens to Fre/nda is the best example
so, since it's from their perspective, the watcher doesn't get to see the whole fucked up deal
but that's because the characters belong to the light side
than Index
Railgun is of course less dark themed
eeeh? jailbreaker arc is not exactly happy and it's the biggest one
even to railgun
that pic is correct
so yeah
and still horrible experiments done by the dark side
there is sister arc, misaki's past
but behind it
railgun just maintains a facade
eeeh?

I never liked second half
But even on first run
Death note did that for me
freaking twisted
(the anime omits it)
if omitted
that clearly would make touma shallow
yeah this video explains something
poor touman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BaHIe47yKU
cut out important detail from Touma's background in the anime

It is explained in origin why the round shape tho
Oh well tastes

The og gundam
I do understand dw
Artillery based mechs
As a person loving
Yeah it's not the main focus
(other than mech ones)
(also there are no swords)
It doesn't stop for being such in main timeline
It's still a military politics themed mecha anime
But yeah don't worry it is not a space opera
🤌 👌
And they're 2 h each
1979
Are old animation
Remember that these 3 movies
I do warn you of one thing tho
Watch for yourself
Btw yeah other than explaining
This is the basic definition
A Newtype (ニュータイプ, Nyūtaipu?) is a person who has reached a new stage of human evolution in the Gundam universe. The theory behind this minor but groundbreaking metamorphosis is: in order to adapt to life in space, the human body evolved with heightened mental awareness
And the cases of newtype magicc are disliked by me
So i know what you mean
For the military themes
I am the one also watching gundam
They cannot without
They are piloting
But it's mostly tied to the machines
And just i 2-3 cases it ends up with physics fuckery
In some rare occasions passive telepathy
At max.
Newtypes can foresee the future by a few seconds
What a newtype can do
You seem to overstate
(till hathaway tbh)
Till char's counterattack is alright
Unicorn and narrative are the only two at fault
But it still stays military
Like unicorn and narrative
Only in late uc end
Not in uc
Hm?
Fuck ef
Do remember that gundam the origin kinda explains the whole premise behind the war much better
After watching 0079 movies you can just go in chronological order
Well you will see
Eh but
Then the road becomes easier
i strongly suggest this to people who like historical anime
the artstyle is pretty neat as well
https://anilist.co/anime/110547/Arte/
it's not like they accept her "okay you can work here" as if it was nothing
she gets her deal of issues with being a noblewoman in that time period
but i don't see an issue with that
People criticized it because of the female mc
the characters and the plot are nice
before writing it
the author obviously studied his stuff
it's historically accurate
8.0/10
after 1 year of pausing it
watching arte
i just finished
lmao ash

i am still confused

context?
hmm?
i have a "rushed" feeling
so i don't know how i feel about that
half of it is original
but
a lot
i enjoyed charlotte

tho it has its own flaws (adaptation issues)
little busters is also great

Average 1080 episode

Fucking earth federation, both are garbage
In the explanations we actually got what caused the conflict
You miss the whydunit
From 0079
If you take zeon alone
I was referring to the concept that fantapolitics are rather hard to input in any work. And snk fails gloriously
"yeah i can see this happening in the future"
Gundam 00 makes you say
In space
Uc gundam is just ww2
Are pretty much realistic
Gundam politics
but whatever
the author has decided to convey his main character like that and i think it's fine
one doesn't have to write in a way he doesn't want, i don't see an issue with that
^
it's worse than sao discussions
i will step out
i can foresee where this discussion is going. x_x
has a "joke" tone
because every time that pops up
I don't take that seriously
but still
not completely, sure
he states multiple times that being in that body changed him
He is not an adult, he is a child in that world
except that's caused by his || trauma ||
The amount of rudeus haters are trying to steer on "Political correctness" because he is a pervert
his background is really really sad
Rudeus is a victim
He doesn't.
No
he's freaking amazing
and yes
he's a *reverse* isekai protag
Maou Sadao
Ah
which satan?
but it doesn't mean that a male mc has to fall into an archetype
the archetypes
it's because female mcs can dodge
i can't argue with that
boring, flat and streamlined
is marked by these that are nothing more than "Kirito offshoots"
the average isekai mc
at least
Naofumi was*
are on the edge side of the isekai mc
Kazuma and Naofumi
and i find him interesting
note: i neither like rudeus, nor i dislike him, but i find that at least he's different than the average isekai mc
this is on the same line of Dr.Ver discussions
i don't like super robots shad
i wont lmao
noh
black sarena goes brrr
i will watch the "so hated" movie
without playing SRW
i would have never watched nadesico
lmao
10/10
btw
i'm in love with nadesico op
PLS
D:
nOOOHH
NO PLS
LOL GEKIGANGER
the plot itself is not a masterpiece tho
even the artstyle is very nice
i like the characters and the comedic gags in it
and the last episodes were a bit of a mess
it's good but it has highs and lows
8/10
finished watching Nadesico anime
i just
it goes big
but the instant it recovers
the watcher is just confused
the true issue are the first 3 episodes
best Fan Translator ever

i watched only macross F

do you remember love?
since first one
and watch the whole macross
after this i will go back and widen my mecha cultural baggage

ruriruri best character
ah
lol
batch for first macross?
a decent
that i can't seem to find
is it this possible
both good
and saihate no paladin
watching mahoutsukai no yome
i want to know what's wrong with starting with futari btw
bruh
lmao
why haru fz???
but futari was really awesome
i don-t watch kamen rider
:<
you gotta go back to the origin
also futari wa precure isn't the first one???
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
we both know
noooo solo
and i'm not joking
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
screw everything else
Futari wa.
costantly acting as a seed server for popular content.
you must be an huge seeder
but yeah to get screwed with torrenting
moved **out** from europe
this is why Nyaa owner
^
but they can't really check what *you are doing* with your connection
and baits
are exceptions
These
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
where gdpr stops ISPs from checking what are you doing without a mandate from a judge
not everyone lives in europe
~~and then get the fbi at your home~~
it wont be recovered.
and lost
if the abandonware becomes forgotten
of torrent system
it's the true real flaw
this is true
oh well

it went downhill
was really the best
Digimon adventure
but
i wasn't implying only
well
alot
pls boule
lmao
is not 100%
it's fatal when the seed
yeah mil but for a dead torrent
if not, it's a lost cause
is the seeder 100%?
missing pieces?
like gunpowder, there are good uses and bad ones
but
internet is probably one of the most powerful invention of humankind
everything has a downside.
this is also why botnets go unchecked tho
in europe
but an ISP really can't look into what you do with your connection
*leeching*
i download stuff and delete it
if not for some exceptions
well i also don't seed
okay yeah it was shareware
i'm getting confused
not shareware
err
it's sharing shareware and copyright protected
Because torrenting itself is not illegal.

Vol 5 is 🌶️
It was a good enough adaptation
You can safely skip vol 1-4
The power of imagination ™️
But he is needed to kickstart plot and worldbuilding

I think that he is the weakest villain

My guess is: If the grail and/or the command spell exists he can't imagebreak a servant
admitting he can manage to hit them of course
🤔
delete fate servants?
can kamijou touma
went full burst on something weird
my wicked brain
there is one couple and that's it, the author is not interested into developing romance in his writings
Toaruverse will never delve into romance
I saw railgun t alk
I didn't like it
Thunderbolt
And i somehow don't register
He watched 08
No
and 0083 after that ❤️
0080 is the next if you want to go chrono mode
it's just to skip the pain
MSG Movie trilogy is useless if you watched the anime
but i think it works DRAMMATICALLY better that way
it retcons some stuff
MSG Origin is really important

hmmm
or the thematics
i dunno, maybe a character
gonna try to pinpoint
what you remember
throw out
Yes it can still be
Virtual World thematics are part of Cyberpunk array of themes
not isekai
Yeah but that's cyberpunk
but yeah mel what do you mean with dual loaded_
but in code lyoko the villain and the vector is inside
as close they can get
Yeah code lyoko is super akin to sao alicization
goddamn rady
❤️
CODE LYOKO
dual loaded?
lmao
the vector is not inside.
it's that the plot centers **outside** that world
it's not that mel
i don't know how to explain
i mean...
Kirito was helping in the project
but not in pratice
Hmmm technically it's true
tl;dr it's a shame that reki wasted precious volumes on shit arcs
made me appreciate kirito unironically
Reki rewriting Aincrad (progressive) is something i appreciate tho
also, as i might have stated before, alicization lays deep foundations on concepts developed, worldbuilt and used in Accel world, set 20+ years after
Kirito || was working with them||
It's a virtual world where a corporation || called rath || invested into creating intelligent AI with a from the bottom to the top model
thematic wise
And no Alicization is not a game
it's mainly because the author got around focusing on kirito being op, confronted the true plot he had brooding in background, gave some great roles to other characters (alicization sees Asuna actively interacting and vectoring the plot for example)
is great.
Alicization + War of the underworld
yeah but in truth it's a fake isekai
first 2 volumes of the LN
only arc 1 can be considered akin to an isekai
Aincrad (Arc 1), introduced the concept of virtual world by inputting vrmmos
Fairy Dances (Arc 2), is corporation exploiting a vrmmo, ~~ and a stupid unfitting damsel in distress trope~~
Phantom Bullet (Arc 3), shows terrorism tied to what was left behind in first arc, and how the events affected the world, ~~and a plot ruining kirito~~
Mother Rosario, Shows how such tech can be used in medical fields
Alicization, shows how humanity created sapient AI 
Unital ring, i have yet to touch that can-t speak

Accel world is after all that shit happened 20 years after and that one is really heavily cyberpunkish
the core center of the plot is virtual worlds and AIs
a lot
Yes
Cyberpunk
freaking kirito
fun how accel world instead, which got adapted the same year, months before, which focuses much more on stats and game mechanics didn't leave an impact
i yeld on that point
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so half a volume influenced a decade
4 episodes.
the stats are relevant for...
lasts 12 episodes
the first arc
only for a few episodes melua
they are never made part of plot
in sao
so they are kinda irrelevant
or reasoned on
but never analyzed
Stats are there
if you think of it
hmmm
the plot is really slow to uptake
but couldn't like it
i believe
watched it up to ep 22
i tried .hack //sign
because while Mr. Kirigaya Kazuto is inside unconscious, shit hits the fan and the plot goes full CSGO
only part of the plot is inside
Freaking || terrorists || raid the plant to obtain the program
is not inside.
the entire adventure
THis is the point
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
doesn't count
You are a murrican
bruh mel lel
remember that i'm not a native english speaker
dual loaded
word
I have issues with the world
i'm at 1/4
vol 51 came out
speaking of books, i gotta go reading the misadventures of A Certain Boy with a Certain Right Hand, whom believes in true gender equality ™️
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I do sense you would get mad at zz if ya eventually watch it
Lel
Is rare
Gundam and lack of annoying characters
I could give it a rewatch someday tho
Tho the mech concepts are topdog
It has a meh taste in my mouth
Thunderbolt
Sadly i do not like
08th is surely one of the best
The mc
But that's mainly because I cannot stand
Could be zeta
My least liked...
And i like the characters, even if kou can make my blood boil out of anger sometimes
Thus ultra pretty
It's the top most hand drawn animation can pull on mecha show
It grew on me on a rewatch
But i admit i have bias
Is 0083
My fav
Where the late uc gap happens
That's it till gundam nt/unicorn
Because of that fated 0079 war
Uc timeline is a jar full of people that keep suffering, one way or the other
Y
War is bad tm
I see what you mean
In the gundam series
It's a pretty unique movie
Did you like 0080?
And friends
It changes perspective on zeon
Coz a pre pre quel
Origin is a special exception
Some things... Are better that way, you get the full insight
Because even if the release order is all over the place
I am suggesting in chronological order
Then yeah at least watch zeta first
It's my personal suggestion
Watching origin before
Of course it would not hurt
Z>ZZ>CCA
The order there is
Movie
Char's counterattack
Till CCA
So if i would pick, i would stall origin
And you haven't technically finished to know char
It centers on char
I would keep origin for a bit after
Look
Hmmm
Which centers on poor zeon soldier testing cool ass technology during various key battles of the oyw
MS igloo exists
Also if you can bear full 2000s cgi
It all makes sense that way
I would say
Go in order
Best gundam ova
S t a r d u s t m e m o r y
Did i hear
I actually prefer judau to kamille
Take your poison
Joke or simp
Or you prefer banana
Judau, your fav gundam mc
Similar
Sinilar situation yet different
You dealing with teenagers in zz
Of annoying
Different kind
Till cca
I wont spoil more
In a important fashion
Only amuro and bright keep reappearing
<@228659769404030976> you overestimate how much 0079 crew sticks around
A weird volume but good
I am satisfied
So yeah finished reading index volume 51

i resumed reading accel world
<@202444817043685386>
T his list
90-55
Ver is also there
i don't know how to feel about that
at 100
whew they shot Zeref up
after first arcs, of course
tbh
he is an antihero
and i also find something must be moved
it was made for fun
well fine it's alright to not agree with the list
or 2018
should be like 2017
this list is surely post 2014 i can vouch for that
assclass is dated...?
with current knowledge of assclass events
further down the line
So you would move koro
nvm found him
i missed the coords
korosensei again
where is
there are some misplacements caused by outdated content
Note: the list is outdated
you must take the factors in context
the scale just can't be redacted
in that way
If you measure that
or at least he fueled it
of duel monsters
kaiba caused a big part of the fuckery
but how much they deserved to suffer as in karmic retribution
as "killed x"
deserving
Let's not measure
coords?
gl
ah ok sorry
also DrVer is on the list
<@202444817043685386> you might find that interesing
poor touman
ah there 40-95
where was touma again...
also saya
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
30-85
TAKERU IS ON THE LIST
<@279341087494242304>
OMG
damn umaru

what i found again
look
who is that?
i would put her higher by 20 more
tamamo is a bit too low
saber from fate is also in a ok spot
i do not know that
also correct
right with Kenshiro
that spot is perfect
20-90
is up
okabe
good spot
osamu mikumo
LOL
hidamari sketch?
holy shit
Take Guts from berserk
happening to them/those close to them
had worse shit than that
in 95-100 range of Y
the people
But i assure you carlos
so i wont speak
my naruto knowledge ends at the tournament where the 3rd hokage ||dies||
Honestly
and char
<@145705908716961792> we gott kamille bidan and amuro
so max 10/55 would be proper
but he was sincere
he screwed up
yeah i agree with you
coords?
hmmm
yeah
sry lol
didn't notice
k
prob 35-50 would have worked better
reasonable
40-50  mikoto
where he is
with older i find lelouch just fine
or with old one?
with current CG knowledge
lel vegeta and frieza
^
infact it's 90 on the X
Ah sure
he died for it
50*
that's why i find his spot is ok
he seriously wants to be seen as an hero
Ver suffers as in
the game was released in 2016
is in the list
Tales of Berseria's Velvet
is surely post 2016
It elaborates further only in axz and xv
The show doesn't march at that point
2017
Mind you
This was made by /a/
That the author of the list just ignored her
Old list, basa was not as relevant
I do not know if someone mDe an updated chart
I am sure of that
2017
you become numb to it
at some poooint
ah well yeah
nearly
the same thing?
isn't that
lmao
tbh
chris is also perfect
fine
and he suffers a lot
yeah surely he is not deserving
i dunno i-m puzzled about him
being there
hmm vash the stampede
lmao
Yeah
but he causes the shit he suffers for
tru lol
well i see your point but i dunno
i find light being in the correct spot
and he underpays for it
is the cause of the whole shit
in the end
oh well light yagami
Wait where is light yagami again
hmmm putting someone on 100 would be the same as deserving as Frieza, Griffith ~~and umaru chan <:Ver:704169051391524875> ~~
master asia lol
yes it's the suffering chart
2017
<@761405600919584789>
tfw we get a podcast about index with the subject of discussing new volumes and we end up with big theories and brainstorming
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypF-49TocYM
You sure the torrent has seeds?
author started writing again
vol 11 came out in oct
Cima garahau ftw
honzuki is good
of an adaptation
tate no yuusha is a disaster
and bookworm
just shield hero
lately i'm not followingg much
Btw putting Ainz ooal gown
Ainz is an exception but i don't consider him an evil character
no lol
into a Gygaxian table
to put Ainz
this is if we try
```As for the true neutral, it’s because of his rationalism and strategizing, acting on gain and loss (usually) that proves he isn’t chaotic in nature. He isn’t tied to laws or justice or any other preconceptions, and so he is simply able to ignore them and do whatever it is he deems will help achieve his goals (we have seen this lack of care for rules and moral constraints constantly).```
it excuses it
He is not human, he stated that
nor evil or good
for ainz
There is no right or wrong
people go and bug him
he is neutral, he cares about his stuff
no carlos
he's True Neutral
Ainz is not evil
i own the first 4 volumes
they did  a decent job tho
to adapt
is not the easiest thing
Goblin Slayer
it's that isekai influence at work there
being "good"
btw about maous
fair
🤷‍♂️
hm
eeeh but is he? he is a traumatized person who is on a road of recovery
he is literally an unstable person
btw the Goblin Slayer as character instead cannot be aligned
lmao
some || multiclassing || went down that road
not only
to the core
is Lawful good
but yeah Saihate no paladin guy
i didn't like it that much
my brain didn't register because
i just watched that
is sky high
my opinion of kirei
man after having played heaven's feel route
KINGU
HAAHGh
TOP
all things considered
btw kirei is chaotic evil
existed ™️
Let's remember irl demon lord
first time i couldn't continue
I have to give it a second shot
but i don't think it's a good fit
Lodoss war
gotta recheck
lol
that gives me nausea
but that smells too much of High Fantasy
think
lemme thing
!!!
my god stroheim
i agree there
yep
Fascism can be considered Lawful Neutral
remember that being Lawful is a super twisted concept
when talking of alignments
Hold up
or a Chaotic Evil?
Kirei would fit a neutral evil?
Kirei... hmmm
that are all over the web
is source of ENDLESS discussions
into the gygaxian table
the wn is older
is 2009
First accel world volume (LN)
both are pretty old
to reconnect my mind to it
rereading vol 13 , signal fire at water's edge
Reki when he can write ™️
so good ~
reading accel world
btw i resumed
meanwhile we were too busy watching out for gorgons across the mediterranean sea <:Ver:704169051391524875>
dw
are usually deities
eastern dragons
i said it above
humans always made up weird shit
ancient myths
i like resuming
scandinavian myths
yep
Fáfnir Fáfner or Frænir
is correct
Fafner
no no
fafnir?
it's a classic
that image of the dragon
lel sao used
it's twisted
Western Dragons are calamities that raze the world down, eastern ones are gods
hell it's the same for Dragons
and a oriental one
between a western Maou
but yeah there are some concepts that deeply differ
Anos Voldigoald only true maou
|| https://c.tenor.com/tiT87O-3R_gAAAAC/the-misfit-of-demon-king-academy-anos-voldigoad.gif ||
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
the others are fake
in anime industry
there is only one demon lord
in the end
this caused some people losing their head in index novels lmao, when the term Majin came out, Magic God or Demon God? turns out it was the former
i know isky
Sauron is the kind of Demon Lord who equals of a Natural Catastrophe
uuuh
majutsu
mahou
ma- is also magic
there are many instances where the terms got swapped.
Magic Lord.
you **read and write** it in the same way as
as Demon Lord
let's note one important detail on the word maou
this
^
ofc it's not the only factor
hard time explaining
hmm
Asterisk War ❤️
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>

btw gimme a sec
and broken english
GOING "YEAH YEAH"
MOTSU
WITH
ALTIMA
don't forget
both ops
people are stupid
he is literally archetype of "From the bottom to the top" character
people hate the protag
i prefer accel world much more tho, the psychological factor just draws me in
but yeah
:bonk:
bad reki
he didn't kill it alone
out of the boss
kirito took a beating
that scene is great
in progressive that gets fixed
in old sao
he refuses healing potion
|| dies ||
when the guy at the first boss
Even reki noticed the shitt he did there
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
**remade** the infamous scene of the potion bottle
i like how progressive
people hate her for no reason
and Asuna is a great character
i loved how it regave life to kirito
of progressive
i've read the manga adaptation
i will
i have to watch them
i appreciate him writing progressive but these movies are original
and still think kirito has an harem
people are too much salty coz fairy dances was bad
it only goes up from there
Mother's Rosario is great
3) Phantom bullet was ruined by kirito's kickboxing, period.
2) Fairy Dances uses an overdone damsel in distress trope THAT DOESN'T FIT the damsel, asuna is a strong female lead
1) Aincrad time skip was bad
3*
had*
SAO has 2 problems
dw
i like both
it becomes better.
for AW
as SAO approaches it's end and lays the grounds
tho not-ironically
i think that AW came out better than SAO
at some point
pretty much alternating
he wrote the stuff
It's A REAL SHAME

I'm STILL FUMING ABOUT THAT
And **WRECKS HAVOC OF THE CHARACTER DESIGNS**
volume 1
only
The anime adapts
it's beautiful but filled with so much despair
Yes...
but my heart breaks in two every time i think of thatt one
when i catch up with aw
i gotta resume reading grimgar
talking of novels
*bless mtv and its anime night*
since 2006
watching anime
it's shitty adaptation
you find in asterisk rakudai and seirei
absolute duo holds down the concept
https://anilist.co/anime/20785/Absolute-Duo/
in ...
that was elaborated
have a common concept behind it
the 3 of them
i prefer asterisk
that's the trio
Rakudai kishi no cavalry and Seirei tsukai no blade dance
i'm happy
?
the distant sequel
for a sukamoka TL
for some cool dude
I'm waiting
😭
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
uuuuuh
several factors hinting it is nearly ended
since you mentioned railgun, i don't know how far it will go
lel
eh amen lovagex
i cry
they destroyed the designs
https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ls8dafj8L.jpg
btw <@277145490087215105> regarding grimgar
ongoing.
10/10 but a journey i would embark only if conscious of the fact that we are talking of a journey of 50+ volumes
it gets really messy
i don't remember the details
Eeeeh
i just cringed hardcore
when i watched season 3
i'm up with the novels
i'm an avid index fan lovagex
you tell me

want an mc who forces his ideals and claims they're good?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you didn't answer me
btw yeah ash
and i love it for that reason
it gets more and more painful
ghostra, if you embark that route, you gonna shatter
3 and half.
anime adapts
5 volumes total
from the end of the novels
that the adaptation stopped ONE VOLUME AND HALF SHORT
I will read that
Last embryo
Mondaiji game system is great because it's ultra serious
Of last trial of humanity
I still shiver at the concept
Happens there
Really serious chardev
Serious
Who are something
It's also the characters
You cannot really explain much in just 2 out of 12 adapted volumes
It's the anime
What does dirty
The 3 mcs come from 3 different time periods
Also eras
Bigger than the sun
Converge in one place
We are talking of a world where all the myths, cultures religions and so on of humanity
The worldbuilding is mental
The characters are amazing
Is Mondaiji tachi
And def underrated
Another great read
Btw
goddamn it.
it just works in timeline
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
and then i'm one of these evil people headcannoning kuroyukihime as kirito x asuna daughter
You're not wrong
btw that virtual world concept is what kickstarts Accelerated world in accel world
i also like how Asuna took the lead in that arc
made to develop || AIs||
It's a virtual world
^
i want to keep writiiing
it's 3 am
goddamn i should go to bed
is a plus
Kirito doing nothing
HAHAHA
51.
I will just leave the info of how no time is given to touma to do romance, 51 volumes = plot starts in july, now we are on the new year eve of the same year
Unital ring is WIP
2 volumes short
the end of sao
so WE CAN FINALLY SEE
and adapted
to be done
i want Unital Ring
i approve
Chad take
he is a damn wizard
also author not interested in writing romance
he's thrown rightt and left continuously
in the novels
there's no time for touma to do romance
No
i love the concept of floating islands
btw sukasuka setting is also great
.
shoot in dm
oooooh
they're doing it???
Gn everyone
"oh shit x10"
I was like

Btw another good read but the tler went mia on the last 3 volumes
A legit degenerate
He did other things to others <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Sora never lifted an hand to shiro

Reasonable as the why unveils after the anime ends
For what comes after
Is just buildup
Second half of the anime
I don't know how to respond to that
Uh?
Ash noob
Mondaiji is an isekai
If they did 24 episodes you guys would have got the backgrounds of the 3 mcs

Asterisk

I admit picking the wrong example, but i am a bit sleepy and heading to bed, will discuss this another timr
It depends on what you want to convey tbh. If you drop a -ba it doesn't hold the same meaning as a -to or a -nara or a -tara
Then you bump into the exceptions
The rule says okay this is how you do conditional, and drops 5 different conditionals
The ratio to rule:exception is like 1:4
Jp grammars's issue is that there are too many exceptions and so little rules
To learn jp afterwards
Just makes it easier

<@193408538909868033> someone made this heavenly gif by taking the manga panel
NT is more complex than OT
and nothing new
btw i agree with the guy
like s3.
not a clownfiesta.
but it needs a good adaptation
ofc i would be content for NT getting adapted
ah well
So yes please.
not because of the source.
because of bad adaptation
failed
index anime

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUTvpUXs8ms
hype
confirmed
season 3
Dota dragon blood
lel
yeah big spider and silent arc are original and the suck a lot
that anime is nearly 100% (fuck silent party arc) based on that manga
vol 15 or 16
coz the reason is index LN exclusive
doesn't explain it mil
current railgun manga
it is if it's gonna raise questions afterwards
they're the bane of adaptations
Plot holes aren't who cares
why didn't she go to saten appointment?^
where is frenda at?
then tell me
but yeah it seems that the mangaka also got bored of writing railgun
say what you want lank, i already elaborated plenty on that point
no more fre/nda for you ppls
poor frenda
by index events
railgun T is really good just because part of what happens is catalyzed
they will never do it
knowing the author
(well sad for everyone)
sad noise for railgun only fans is that the manga is doomed to end in the near future
S3 still sold more than S1-s2 combined, Accel had its own sales, and railgun t is just famous
and decide based on that
the editor said: let's see how much accel, s3 and railgun t sell
Kazuma Miki
lel
in the latest volume
was pulled out
hell even freaking WICCA
so well that i am still convinced that the author is just a sorceror
while the shit is fucking based on IRL esoteric theories
Magic side seems to suck because completely unexplained
Other than that, content was just scrapped away, touma has no background and seems like a dumb plotarmored goon
in certain volumes.
at once
3 groups of characters
is having to sync
one of the main ones
comes in several aspects
into adapting index
The hard part
lel
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
HOW LOL
so the effort required is just vastly inferior
is linear
into railgun
There is no effort
as long as we know
Author was disappointed by the 26 episodes and be done with that
lel
other than that, budget was pretty low
lel
🤡
3 volumes in 6 episodes
Content Compression is one of the main ones
if they fail like s3, it would be unwatchable
T should be
i'm curious
can you find it? lel
lel
but i can't pinpoint rn
i remember something about it
and there is nothing about it.
it's like event X happens
but then "???"
that's entirely true
yes
that she gets called
You mean the fact
ah
?
instead
I would have just pointed out that the author forgot about a character
how?
x_x
a mystery fails if there is nothing to even guess!
you can't do it!
if you don't leave anything to piece
that's it.
If you leave hints
lmao mil
so comparing everything to monogatari is meh
Lank not everything, believe or not, is fit to be told like monogatari does
And same on Lina
i think they made that up
My sunbeam <:Ver:704169051391524875>
i give up, whatever
.
*hardcore disagree* not even hinting equals to forgetting that character exists.
to never return
she just DISAPPEARS OUT OF THE SCENE
it's not even hinted
that's it.
I would agree with you if it was explained at all
and i shipped the first with the guy from the dragon knights
D:
i really felt bad at those 2 dying
and || lina ||
:((
also rip || winter wyvern ||
epic high fantasy intensifies
putting that aside, Dragon blood is freaking great
well whatever
i wish it had explained those properly
wtf
where???
lel
except index anime doesn't explain nearly anything that could help the plot

Opinion: what a bunch of clowns
Of snk final 2
I watched first 2 eps
i have to read mahoyo and kagetsu tohya too

intensify
me hoarding VNs

on w10 and it starts
i just tried to boot Tsukihime
yeah it runs
<@279341087494242304>
it's not the same experience
yeah it's just that being a VN
but yeah KnK and Tsukihime are awesome
well if you want to try again butt here we can try to help
it should run fine on w10
(sys locale is not language)
otherwise that's the reason of the crash
to japanese?
the system locale
Did you set
the 2000s VN doesn't run?
Hm?
and i think the worst of Talk.exe can be found only in Fate/Zero pilot episode
Probably it's a matter of what we search in an anime
Played Tsukihime VN first route (arcueid)
and read the novels
i watched Kara no kyoukai
not clown politics.jpg
9/10 imho
more than s1 and s2
i liked it A LOT

than Railgun and Index
Accel had definitely an higher budget
it even drops some major things from NT novels
expecially with its high budget
it's cool mind you
and that manga goes backward
Accel well, accel manga instead feels just wrong but it's just because we know chardevved Accelerator
other than Mikoto not being best mikoto
i know the grand picture
that's why i can't appreciate railgun
because it's just a small part of the whole deal
Railgun is definitely less interesting than index
but it's only fair since railgun it's easier to adapt
one of them being better adapted
Railgun got popular for several reasons
GT is also supreme good but it's still fresh to judge, it's wild tho
with 2 peaks being NT9-10 and NT19-20-21-22-22R
to supreme good
that's where the novels go from chad good
that honestly? at this point let's just hop onto NT
would take so much time

from the 1900s
blame a certain wizard from england
also index is not about the magic side, it's about the magic side *and* the science side
with ck
it has Magick
the movie was magiccc
s3? 6.5 was me being lenient, it's barely 6
at best.
it's a 7/10 adaptation between s1-s2
it objectively
if i have to rate
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
but i just couldn't on s3

also me going full fanboy even while admitting it's crapped adaptation
what do you pretend
is a 40 years long running series
well gundam
tbh i have to watch that one, i've spoilered myself by playing srw
also

lol
no
back then
i really liked unicorn
yes
i rarely adjust ratings
of what i tought of the series when i watched
But most of my tens are felt
over the span of a dozens of years
that this list has been cultivated
to point out
It's important
https://anilist.co/user/Cypher05/animelist i am rather lenient
less than 8.5
i couldn't give it

~~millhi you ready for fairy tail 100 years anime? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~
but it's not a masterpiece absolutely
i said that i think it's better than all the ship girl anime that came afterwards
and getting mad for some unknown reason
isky it-s just you not liking it
to me this is a good synopsis.
```In the year 2039, the drastic effects of global warming have caused sea levels to rise, resulting in major loss of land. To ensure humanity learns its lesson, a fleet of powerful warships equipped with advanced weaponry emerges, causing overwhelming defeat for naval forces throughout the world. Calling themselves the Fleet of Fog, each ship has a "Mental Model," a humanoid avatar which represents the ship's heart, its "Union Core." Each model has a different personality but all follow an unknown authority known as the Admiralty Code, who have implemented a blockade to prevent humans from traveling across the sea.```

"This is how anime is supposed to be"
it's so fascinating
<@279341087494242304> Elemental Gelade ep 16 so far
yes
since author went down the generic route
without mentioning that, anyways, the LN becomes boring after S2 events
S1 was decent, but s2 is just a borked continuously skipping arcs adaptation
borked adaptation ™️
what a disappointment
my god tate no yuusha 2

someone mentions hayate

i didn't know Unital Ring had eugeo
hey don't spoil
COusin
Suguha is the worst option
No thank you
in the end Silica is too young, Lizbeth didn't try enough, Sinon is Sinon
nah
pretty cait sith with wings
and a Sinon [ALO] figure
i got both an Asuna figure but it was super cheap
it's so ugly...
i will replace my low tier asuna figure someday
on many levels lol
that is pog
best girl
probably the one that really wants kirito, aside from asuna, is ||Alice, but alice is an ai||
and shinon talking shit on kirito is just 👍
but there is not really romance here
Excalibur arc
but it's been explicitly said that they wont butt in
ofc they want
and she's the one kirito choose, it's not an harem
but she's great.
people hate Asuna too much
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
lmao i like how asuna holds the sword holster like it's a katana

it progresses slowly
i guess once a year
Release Date
June 10, 2021

last volume
SAO Prog LN

it's labeled as finished
it's a waste of money
don't buy prog manga

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZkDTb-iEok
i will link one last
rip
are all shit quality
that Fripside Nao songs on youtube
It has to be said
i do admit that i have biases and preferences of course
look so far what i found out disliking in the jpop anime industry area is fripside yoshino and ClariS
my taste clicks with first one, i seem to be unable to like yoshino outside shirabe's singing
second half is yoshino's cover
half video is sang by Nao
same song

~~good way to tell everyone you are watching hentai~~
if setup that way
it tells on discord what are you watching
i think the streaming part came afterwards
it was designed for watching downloaded anime
i am noticing functions i don't even use

also lel
if setup that way
it even detects anime on streaming websites
oh shit i noticed
ofc it could be nice it could read manga list
is just great to me
but having a button for *everything* instead of navigating on the various websites *manually*
ofc if you don't need such things, there's not much to say
well yeah
the tool was made with this purpose in mind
that's all
i'm not trying to convince you, just trying to explain why it's more efficient
i made an example by searching sailor moon
this is all i do instead if i want to add something:
then return to list
go on the website, click search, add anime, open episode counter set 1 and watching
and it's slower
takes more time
going on anilist
it's that
you can access anlist in 3 clicks

and in case one wants more info on something?
using taiga *is* using anilist
seasonal based on the list
hell also this function

i love it's minimalistic interface
it has no use
ofc if you don't watch on pc
update or ignore
and asks you what to do at the end of it
the running episode
it autodetects
or fetch torrents/get notified
animelists
and manage
it's made to autoupdate
it's just too much handy
i see
best program
👍
Pchan
i understand lel
aaaah
i'm curious
what anime is that btw
tru
it's just funny
but understandable btw
B A L T L A N D
baltland lank

i love these fantasized derping
i guess in that game of eu it was gobbled down by muscovy
POLAND DISAPPEARED

netherlands went ne*d*erlands
still dominated france
the gauls
i guess
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
but romagna is super derp
as independent republic
as venice had its own territories
that's actually probably semi-legit

become the whole country without venice

dropped was this
the publisher
last thing
also again, he was still writing back then
it's ok
Vol 6 is a distant prequel
why would they invest into something that's not ongoing?
Investment reasons
for sure
2 half cours
anime is Volume 1-2
Volume 6 to be exact
and it's canonical
4 years ago
the Movie sold a lot
more or less it's not null
lmao
tho i'm super curious how much will they censor up shit if they adapt it, since there is borderline h content later on
that's why NGNL didn't get another season
afters 4 years of hiatus
the author started writing again
got vol 11 in october
No game no life

He can't excel in everything

Hey poor zun, draws, composes, writes, programs
Fits all 3 but use proper depending on the topic
It follows the same reasoning that fate does
Bur yeah whatever
Written by zun, drawn by others
They expand the plots and lores of the game
Those are official tho
Exp kasen one
I don't want to poke people but those manga are good reads
Me
Like forbidden scrollery
It has official mangas
Since 2hou has several mangas, a fanmade anime, two gacha games, many normal games
All three i would say

sasuga ainz sama
on overlord 4
btw great hype
sadly
Lank they asked to be bought, the slave status was already on them
i don't pretend anything, i just don't care about being politically correct. I'm ok with that plotline.
i'm reading the source
ardania
no he is not.
it has to do with endangering their life if the slave collar was removed
a plot reason
it's
and infact he doesn't try anything
he states many times they're just daughters for him
she retains her other world memories
it's just arisa because she is also an isekai character
do that
they don't
not lovers
he treats them as his daughters
for a reason
second he is not freeing them
first of all, they asked the mc to be bought
it's too cozy with the protag going tourist

wn
btw i started reading death march vn
yeah...
lol
the heck is that anime
hmmm
shame it will never be adapted fully
kawakami is a madman

i def will keep recommending horizon down into my grave

imho neither the mc, ayano nor kisara really did anything wrong deserving that as far the plot has shown
for all 3 of them
but i feel bad
i'm liking that too

hey if you don't, your loss <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

you will miss many gems of the past
it gonna bring you to heavens
you just need a ticket to the cultured ship then

and nothing else
so he's not a || simp ||
oh interesting
are they different?
*bruh destroy mode*
and ruin the fiesta
to butt in
or does aya want banagher
and outplay it
so my two cents it would be that it would take a couple of flukes for the Zero system to adapt
it's like fighting with a beast
is really primal
look Alaja-vijana
hmmm
the zero system...
ah
vs barbatos
ofc amuro can't really use funnels

you guys can't understand
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

out of context
nah i'm joking that's just taken

yeah of course
ah well
*as an index reader*
pls aeon
i am bewildered
*Send this to someone who hasn't read Index*

can't
fucking
i
behind s3
a financial reason
there was
i hate it when they do that
goddamn it
in full index III fashion
or is it plot wise?
it has issue animation wise
i've been told
from dal 1
btw i finished DAL s2 i honestly believe that was a steep step up

<@279341087494242304> i remembered this
🙏
HAMANNNNN
I felt sad while watching it
Igloo was good
it's not kazuto kun going full edgelord because yes
makes a lot more sense here
Also freaking "Iamdabeater!!11"
i'm curious how it will progress at this point
it's worth
do et when you have free time
yeah
did you watch it?
<@202444817043685386> my dengeki bunko bro
8.5/10
and why the fuck they recycled the infamous potion scene from OG aincrad?? reki retconned that for a reason, rip me. 

but after all it's a pretty nice movie
i'm confused a lot by the retcons
as  person who did read sao prog manga
<@277145490087215105> i just watched SAO Progressive movie 1
Higashide is fucking great
And not nasu
Written by higashide
Yes
Of something that is already not more than 6.5/10
Anime is a bad adaptation
Fate apocrypha
it's vol 1 to 4
but yeah <@272127150579122178> keep going, aw is def worth, the adaptation was almost 1:1, it just cut out several monologues that couldn't really be inserted in the anime format
Usso be like
freaking victory gundam <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but side
vol 10 is **canonical** not filler
this is important because Alicization is the foundation of the inner workings of the brain burst
as no sound was transmitted
|| they couldn't speak ||
Volume 10 || is a set of side stories, in one of those kirito while working at RATH for the alicization project experiences a bug || which || warps him to the accelerated world 2 decades after ||, || they fight and kirito wins ||
(as it is your choice)
but yeah it's a shame to avoid aw based on the mc appearance. But hey, your loss <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
~~aya is just jealous that the kid nearly gets an harem~~
He is in the dead center of "From the bottom to the top" type of mc
|| https://s3.narvii.com/image/7wnhs27u2ccjelnjyo7zyqkddf3fqor2_00.jpg || 
also volume 10 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the kid is 12
what you pretend from a 2nd grade middle schooler
i don't tknow
his chardev is really second to fews
Haru is a really great MC
plus
|| https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtM6V8PCEAASzHR.jpg ||
because accel world is basically reki showing off his writing level
it's really sad
with real life
but the point of accel world is how big of a deal is when the game/cyberspace interferes
the pig avatar is less and less
But anyways
physical copies.
i read the LN aya
and he is taller in the LN illustrations
official data
the anime failed into draawing him
he is 134 cm tall
yes
i'm confused by the question
and massively underrated
is fucking great
AAccel world

Well i am going to read a bit more death march then fall asleep

<@202444817043685386>
Not yet
But fateverse got bloated with fgo
Nasuverse is a wonderful thing
Counterforce
Alaya vs Gaia
Yep
If zel wins fateverse happens
Tsukihime happens
If crimson moon wins
Zelretch (rin ancestor) vs Crimson moon
They start from an outcome of one battle
Is more charming than the fateverse
Well the tsukihimeverse
Hf like that is weird, you miss ubw contextes
The only thing i will not continue watching is prillya
Go ahead
Ah well it's still fateverse
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Ep 22 is the only true reason to watch it
That's all
Higashide is great when writing but he fumbled and the anime was a failed adaptation of something underwhelming
So yeah tldr
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
If they didn't cut that out in the adaptation...
So an host was needed
She is not an hero nor an anti hero
Jeanne d'arc can't be canonically summoned into normal classes
Demiservant
Eh
As host
Do you know that she inhabits a nun body
They cut out lots of internal monologues
Jannu is ruined
Higashide wrote that masterpiece of a vn called ayakashibito
On nasuverse
But he just fumbled
so yeah there goes my take on that
(index 1-2 [48] are still 13.5 volumes total, squish squash happens there as well but the arcs were less intense)
3 of those massive.
but it is what it is, 24 episodes, 9 volumes, squish squash
and it just got ruined
fans are rightfully enraged at index 3 because it was supposed to be the best content in the whole old testament novels
and it feels boring in the anime
which was important for touma's background
hell they even turned upside down a focal arc in index 1 (angel fall arc)
basically shit is just jumbled together, explanations, monologues, interactions missing thus weakening what was supposed to be delivered. Of course the magic side seems like shit if they don't explain it
it's my rating, do not pay too mucbh mind
to me anything under 6 is a disaster, i deem underwhelming shit under 7 (and sometimes including)
can't blame you, i always said that
index 3 is just a disaster
7/10 at best
index 1-2 is still an underwhelming adataptation
pls aeon
also this <:Ver:704169051391524875> 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj5SNJ4xJAg
new volume is coming out
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hm? i will never say it's railgun content, it's too good for being restricted by railgun
*misaka worst is misaka best*
o7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTMFKgNBQus
but we shall see
i am not a fan of the artist
understandable
oooh
<@202444817043685386> might be interested
Reki is welcomed
👌
Touma did a good job there
in the anime lol
is one of the decent ones
tbh that fistfight
the boy with the ak
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
HA MA ZU RAAAAH
Hamazura
(assuming they do something decent)
you gonna like that shit
oooh i assure you if NT gets adapted
Tsuchimikado motoharu?
heh
they wasted it in index 3
Touma true character is no small feat to describe tbh. He gets defined as a bad person at some point and it can't be more correct
everywhere
freaking kabbalah and thelema
also Index is occult fiesta
than approaching railgun
but it's def harder
It's not hard to gett into
lmao
also smokes
(or was it more?)
182 cm tall
lmao styl
Styl Magnus?
???
i'm confused
index shanks?
also new fans to raildex are always good and railgun just that good as entry point
onwards
i really wanted to see what the author came up for mikoto during ww3 events
as an **index ln** reader i'm sad that railgun manga is ending soon
(vns are the hardest fz)
^
also
Railgun is easier to approach
even emiya shirou looks stupid in ubw anime
i get that
in the anime
Anyways yeah touma seems one dimensional
that's not the point lel
but anyways
sorry
6 LNs at the same time*
miso pls
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
is garbo
that index anime
i always saay
touma is not immortal, ib is not a plot armour
she stopped his heart for a few secs.
is because mikoto didn't want to kill him.
that if touma didn't die on that bridge
always remember
touma is a bad person
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And forces his ideals onto others
in railgun but mikoto being normal just no
the sol elements
i understand preferring
no people just no
what?
BiriBiri is a normal person
yep, i always agreed on this point
and i felt silent arc a disaster even without knowing it was Original
thus said i preferred index even when i was anime only
from the outside.
it's like watching a snow globe
holds me back
but the fact that i *know* the main shit that is going on
No i def understand the appeal that railgun gives out
ordinal scale is not bad
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
since it started with misaka worst
|| https://preview.redd.it/58so7ckbbzg21.jpg?auto=webp&s=5808f5687d8730aab26800a7da923b304dd194d5 ||
oh also
time to change it.
also i'm staarting to lose my shit at my keyboard
ghhhh
REKI REWROTE THATT FOR A REASONNNNN
tho why did they have to recycle the potion scene
man progressive movie was nice
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
LOLOLOL
who knows, you might like index anime like i did even if i recognize all the defects
well it's not going to run anywhere, but you can give it a shot
and rip
|| touma attempts suicide ||
*wall of text happens*
*proceeds to break everyone reading*
*it bothers me; of course it bothers meeee;*
but yeah to say it short, it's hard to find someone who likes touma as anime only, but it's rare to find an index ln reader who dislikes touma
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i agree with that take
ye chono
lel
pls aya?
accel requires tho
no
**which is HORRIBLE**
2) it's THE SAME CHARACTER WE ALL USE TO READ BUT WITH CHARDEV REVERTED
1) requires having watched index
Accelerator anime has a major turn off
again, manga is ending
for raailgun
btw there is no content to adapt
it would be railgun F
Railgun, Railgun **S**econd, Railgun **T**hird
it's not alphabetical
???
why U
y
and despite being bad index 3 sold
combined
fz according to the editor, new index can happen depending on how well index 3, accelerator aanime and railgun t sold
(which she doesn't get to anywaays since at some point touma doesn't go back home for weeks)
for the rest
at touma's house
Index has her high moments, she is there to live her lazy life
back in 2003
that *a certain* was suggested by the editor on vol 1 release because of that
She has a defined role, but the story is called *Toaru Majutsu no index* and not Majutsu no index for a reason
much more badass than railgun contentt showed
mikoto takes 33 vvolumes to become an aawesome character
neither is index.
mikoto is not a protag
Touma protag 1, Accel protag 2, Hamazura protag 3
he is that important
touma is not the only one.
since index protags are 3
as 3rd protagonist
let's define him
the boy was going into a wrong direction
version 4 or 5?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvRCVbS81eg uncanny swordland remix

Remember to close it when you don't need or you will end up seeding indefinitely
It's fine as it is
Yep
this is why people said "use old version prior to ad update"
and they added ads
at some point they wanted to make money
or at least similar
yeah basically old utorrent was the same as how qbittorrent is nowadays
qbittorrent is ok on latest
that was utorrent blackraiden
utorrent is adware nowadays
qbittorrent
i got it downloaded
i could also read rewrite
NASU PLS
and there was no way to get out since the split is the first choice you make in the whole gaame
because i got locked down into a dead end of ciel route
got me enraged
man i remember my first attempt at tsukihime
so i could go straight for ciel route
nice
<@279341087494242304> what one of those is it?
it's the one where ||arc says goodbye to shiki||
or nomal ending
if it's arc true ending
i can never recaall
i did one route
|| and try to not get mollusks ||
i could go back aand play more tsukihime
i could go back and do another ayakashibito route
lemme think...
that's why i summoned ya
i know you told me
hmm i could start one like right now
i got too many vn to read

vol 13
it's the first intensive arc of the LN
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
director couldn't handle 3 group of characters in unison
was adapted
in the anime kazakiri falls in background because of how Academy city invasion arc
mostly, but she appears even in NT
she is relevant in index 3
"artificial angel"
10k Level 3 electromasters are like a freaking farm for her
Kazakiri Hyouka exists because of AIM Diffusion Fields
everyone forgets that
|| and aleister drives the entire plot for 40+ volumes ||
tl;dr aleister doesn't really give a shit about level 6 esper
but because it was needed as explanation to the watcher
chibi touma teacher explains what it is not for fun
that espers produce
AIM Diffusion Field
it's stated in index 2 anime even
it's not a retcon
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/to-aru-majutsu-no-index/images/c/ce/Hyouka.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150103173458
they were made primarly to summon kazakiri hyouka
that was the second aim
anime only raildex watcher: misaka clones are a cute concept

it's not to dismiss you
it's easier to paste this than to explain
<@277145490087215105>
to be short.
a different person created a different magical ritual
*Chaldea uses the FATE summoning system created by Marisbury Animusphere. Its foundation is in Galahad's shield Lord Camelot, which was made using the Round Table and therefore represents "a place where heroes gather". Using that meaning, the shield serves as a catalyst for countless Servants.

Chaldea's summoning system requires both Master and summoned Servant to agree to the summoning.[112]

Due to the Human Order being in disarray and its own unique properties, it allows for the summoning of Divine Spirits.[113]

The system allows for the summoning of Pseudo-Servants.*
is much more advanced
fgo summoning
2024 will be fsn anniversary
it has the timespan of 18 years of writing
but it's mainly because
but i concur with the take that the ruleset is whacky
and viceversa
avenger can't spawn
if ruler is summoned by using fate system
with nowadays knowledge
without higashide Ruler would not exist
Apocrypha rules were pitched in by Higashide
and they became canonical.
nasu went "ooo i like those"
deen made them in deen/stay night
a good old example is EMIYA's Wing swords
some others pitched in fateverse
it's important to note, that while nasu approves the shit in the end
yep dw
FGO system has Pseudoservants
since the heroic spirit must be installed into a container called Servant
by Fate summon it would be magically impossible to summon a god
there is no holy grail to ground down servants
it's 2 different systems
is not Fate summon
Important to note that FGO summon
on top of new rules
generating exceptions
it's more like that Nasuverse has a ruleset that got expanded with FGO
i don't really agree
meh
**yes**
🤌
By lightning up the car
Look at the almighty lank polluting

my itch to get shit done and finally write that ttrpg campaign using Cyberpunk red
and no i didn't play CP77
i am already fan of the setting tbh
oneshot
considering it's a 10 ep long
it's really good
whew
of CP anime
Watched ep 1-5
and stuff
anyways OG author created CP20 and CPR, he merely helped in CP77 with the worldbuilding
Content still lacks
as long as i understood this is written by the OG author
but i can feel the "rushed" feeling of being constrained in 10 eps
i think that the characters are pretty nice
i'm on ep 5 so far
it's pretty good
she's rad imho
but trigger insisted
as she was deemed unfit for the setting
it seems that cdpr vouched against Rebecca character design
lmao regarding cyberpunk edgerunners
Hell cpr (2045) exists to fill the gap between 2020 and 2077
Yep exactly
lmao true
i watch bofuri only to see the bullshit the mc pulls out
lmao
ooh boy
like on the last 2 eps || arasaka taking advantage of the sandevistan boyo to wipe out millitech ||
is top notch
but the characters and the way the lore was used
Ah absolutely, i agree the story wasn't that special
shame the game flopped like that
the more i dip into this setting the more i like what i read and see
cool shit
also according to the wiki Rebecca is mentioned in the game
cool shit
oh also?

nothing was made up
in the setting
is freaking canonical
i liked how everything in that anime
🙏
rip || rebecca ||
even with the || bittersweet/sad || ending
i liked it *a lot*

if the context doesn't allow him to do so
he can't really improve
look it's the lack of chardev that misses, but again it was written like that on purpose, it's not crap writing, the setting is messed up
but eeeh
I know he's there because he was forced to
I don't mean *shittly written*
i have to correct what i mean by shit tier
actively creates deaths and suffering because of their foolishness
look what unsettles me is when the "whiny brat" archetype
i can't really say anything about that

what can i say
it could be me fanboying about the lore too much
which 08th gives but 0080 doesn't
you need context
0080 no i don't like it
08th maybe
the release order
if you do that
you gonna have huge questions
man i wish they remade 0079
btw now i got what you mean
i think that UC can only be started at 0079
Z and ZZ just don't work
oh absolutely
lmao
this discussion is confusing me
so zoomers might step back
of having aged
0079 has the issue
but still gives a good example about what the franchise is about
yep
i said it above
i started from 00
i didn't
i will never suggest anyone to approach the franchise the first time from 0079 for example
of where starting gundam tho
there are bad example
uhm

that-s 0079
~~ the nerve gas in the colony~~
but but
gonna cry my ADVANCED EUROPEAN UNION in peace
i know it isn't
unicorn
Putting this aside anyways
def ethical
forced to fly in zeon controlled territory
crew of civilian kids
But anyways i will only say as last
and in background
just on a really small scale
it actually does.
EVEN IF
it was in response to "0079 doesn't show EF wrongdoings"
that got jumbled
at the end of OYW there were 4b people left on earth
here
no blockio, this is an old ass conversation i had before
not even by a longshot
You people are making examples that are not as drastic as Zeta EF
not a ww2 era country
it's a worldwide government
it's nott enough.
7 years in this case*
in 1 day
a whole worldwide government doesn't become corrupt
it's only logical
it's implied melua
also char calls out the zabi family on their bullshit
0079 is viewed from the Pov of the freaking white base, of course it can't show the other side
that's no side story.
Zeta
I mentioned
"clear"
in the whole timeline
people being uncomfortable that UC timeline expanding defined clear stances
0083 gave us context
wayy before 0083
was already defined as evil character
The titans admiral
*ordered to shoot the colony laser* on friendly troops
the titans admiral
0083 shows us how
titans didn't spawn out of nowhere
the federation was already corrupt
immediately afterwards
is Zeta.
the one flagging EF as shit tier
i understand disliking this stance since it was added mostly afterwards
well an upheaval was inevitable by how shitty EF was treatingg them
ok i just
yep i went random since 1 am
i trust Sunrise enough
:((
man was i the only one enjoying hathaway so much=?
of terrorist boyo
for the holy second movie
while waiting
it will serve
both
will watch
more gundam is always welcome
thanks
alrighty
to start Mercury no majo?
do i need to watch the prologue episode
Anyways people
let's gooo
Piloting a GM while drunk
But yeah people, let me make this clear one last time. It's just to round this down. *I never said Zeon did good, nor they were in the right*
I just don't want misunderstanding about my stance
https://www.gundamitalianclub.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bernard-monsha_s.png
Truly a competent veteran
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
THis is why my pal bernard monsha should have piloted the GP03 instead
and the strain from GP03 was too much
he piloted a Gundam without being a newtype
exactly that
Kamille has good moments
kou is nothing exceptional
Fair fair
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it's tom cruise under disguise
KOUUUU
NOH
it took freaking *srw* to enjoy kamille
i have issues with Kamille Bidan.
but as i said in the past
Look i liked Zeta
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
THOSE ARE CURSED
NO
i remembered 48
ok i was close
(honest question)
but 40+ eps of that? (how long was Zeta again?)
which is not bad
onto a moral focus
it forces the Military/Political Focus of the timeline
not like "Fed bad"
It doesn't fit that well tho
(fucking m'quve)
and Zabi are bad on the double.
Hell it even digs up that Munzo was the original republic
Hell i liked Origin a lot, but not because i condone what Zeon said/did, but because gave me some actual lore and plot *before* the 0079 events.
Blockio i **never** said that Zeon aren't space nazis and that they're good. I always said that EF is wrong on the same identical foot. This makes the whole political situation of the timeline **gray**.  Sure it's mostly defined afterwards, but still, i wouldn't have enjoyed the timeline if the political scenario didn't escalate like it did.

The whole magic of Universal Century timeline comes out from detailing down the various events and conflicts, and telling various good (and some bad) stories about war dramas or aftermaths. If the story stopped at 0079 it would have been pretty poor and disappointing.
i expect much
and great pilot
Great prologue
Good good
i just noticed
Ad Stella yeah
timeline yet?
btw do we have a name for witch of mercury
what the shit
Lol
good one
even if the ep was rather archetypical
great great
watched ep 1 of mercury
hahahaha
i spoiled everything myself by playing SRW alpha gaiden
i should watch turn a one day
whew
which one is added in the manga?
because of how it is
in Turn A gundam
4 timelines do converge

that timeline is supposed to be an extension of the old one
hold on

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
is that worse than having kamille as mc?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
when they're rad
like you hate the funnel missiles
Melua you're too much biased against cool designs
Zeonic engineers please
> it has never worked
"Actually it's to deflect the beam weaponry"
actually linking Igloo soundtrack remembered me the "So smart" explanation of why Musai class cruisers are round by design

CHONK
has a solid projectile artillery
tho hilariously enough one of my fav mobile suits
you name it
I'm in love with that type of concept, Satellite Cannon, Twin Buster Rifle, Gundam Raphael, GP03D (with the megaparticle ship class cannon)
is it me or Edgerunners gave the wrong idea
Oi oi one thing
it was so "in character" when they left || david mom die on the street ||
Exactly
Melua in the end Trauma Team is just Murrica but worse
yep
freaking areozep
Maxtac is so rad
i agree
*Exactly*
when maxtac comes in, you're in deep shit
I MISSED THAT
AHAHAHAHAHA

RIP
NOOOOOO
created him
our brilliant writer (who also wrote the cursed mekton )
1986
y
it's an huge screw of the setting
it's really deep
|| You cannot retcon Adam Smasher ||
he didn't deserve that
I felt pain for the poor || David || tho
The very moment they called in || Adam Smasher the final battle was doomed to have that outcome, you can't beat the legend ||
now that's a legend
Here i come || Smasher-san from 2020 ||
it clicks much better if you know shit about the setting
did you enjoy the MILLITECH ACTION
it's great tho
hey hey you don't have to end in || cyberpsychosis || in the tabletop lmao
rip
sasuga gundam
👌
"Spacenoid!"
"Earthian"
now i just expect it to chill 1-2 eps before slapping the watchers with the touchè war drama
ep 2 was a glimpse of gundam identity
the anime instead is lit
now it needs content
Cyberpunk got debugged for most part, so it's def an enjoyable game
``` Once a part of the Night City Police Department,
MAX-TAC is now a fully independent organization
in its own right. It contracts with neighborhoods,
governments, and even private citizens to take care
of the most egregious assaults on the public: hostage
situations, cyberpsychos, military class weapons,
terrorists, etc. MAX-TAC is run by the incorruptible
Commander Max Hammerman, late of the original
Night City Police Forces. Hammerman is a man on
a mission: to maintain law and order and protect
the innocent. MAX-TAC has an impartial code that
it follows to the letter—it ends fights, no matter who
starts them. If you're a security service guy fighting
a bunch of boosters, you'd better put your weapons
down when MAX-TAC shows up or they'll open
fire on you too. MAX-TAC doesn't hold prisoners;
arrestees are remanded to the local Hall of Justice/
Security Facility.```
this why Rebecca || insisted ||
even || david was salvageable ||
Cyberpsychosis IS NOT irrecuperable
how did he use it without a neural link??
i missed the fact that cyberdecks are not a thing
NO no wait that sounds reasonable
AH
ah
You don't have to go *full dive* anymore
of Netrunning?
yep i felt as it was wrong
with level 5
well AGE was a collab
where is my extra+unlimited buildup
panic
what's happening, they're adapting mla correctly now??
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Stop making excuses

lodoss <:Ver:704169051391524875> 
it's so high fantasy that even i couldn't
Gundam virtue another good chonk design
Xi is a prime example
are better tho
CHONK gundam designs
and needed the movies to retcon
but that one was much better in quality, even if it was loaded with clowns
with CG
i can see the similarities
it goes downhill as you reach the end
Ouma Shuu ruined his own show
GC Mc

nah why sorry
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
well <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
in that scenario it worked because peace was not achieved
from gundam 00
it gives me some callbacks
but i see it as super weird enforcing it
btw i know about the mercs
so you're essentially justifying the plotline as "Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum"?
BUT YOU DID IT ALREADY
"we must achieve peace"
plus they fight for what? peace was already achieved.
"they fight this random person"
"everyone goes along now"
of a freaking fanfiction
it is on a level
but lelouch himself is a joke
in the movie
she's particularly good
just because qt CC
6/10
Step 1 > Step 2 >  Achieve what has been achieved on step 1
what an useless movie
3rd movie
CG Fukkatsu no lelouch
watched
GO
he bought it
IMPORTANTTTT

rezero
prologue and ep 2 gave me stuff but need moar
i am here waiting for my gritty political scenario

More sao
Oh yes
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
https://i.redd.it/6z4qco327ix91.jpg
manga tho is 🔥
tho the anime is borked since goes original after some point
it's a seinen
i totally reccomend
it's the first shipgirl anime
but but arpeggio where
but why is ttgl politics
my bias for politics

but i will take it
that's rare
sadlyu
who needs cgdct when you can have war drama, despair, mastermind plotlines and so on
of the best boy mech anime
ah ya all talking
gotta sell that source
nOVA
COSMO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYsTsxnLVSw praise cybuster
but but my isekai man
D:
Lol what
lmao
it's for something bad
every time that anime gets mentioned
from this chat
i sense the vibe "2 girls on a screen are better than one"
kk
So is it a recap or not
anyways
i will rewatch it in jp dub
which is whew 1 month after JP airing
just today
in ita dub
i watched it in our theaters
it's not a bad thing in this case since it's still enjoyable
tho i can see how much they went original
tbh, it's pretty good
i watched Sao progressive 2 movie
as i've written in general
but yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y6kW-m2JSA
Good good.
this week gundam episode

speaking of which i have to start reading latest volume
i embarked upon in 2014
it's the loooong journey
ofc
pchan
:3
saoa is good
go
it's 9 volumes ahead of the anime
ofc
don't open if you don't want spoilors

<@202444817043685386> i don't know if i linked this to you
lmao
goddamn aleister
i'm the one who fucking goes hype every time Aleister pops out
that's the difference
yeah i don't care about CGDCT
any concept that pops out in railgun has been at least glimpsed in index
index doesn't treat science
it's not like
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
since irl esoteric shit
this is why the magic side is just the best part
the go out the way of explaining the bogus science
i would just condone it, but the novels are fucking pretentious on those points
those are the 2 most blatant example
to literally *throw* a building
or the fact that accel borrowed minutes of earth rotation
if the projectile is just an arcade coin
can't cause that much havoc
"the railgun"
like
yeagh
he is mad
don't push him
lmao
plus current accel is crestfallen
so nothing like that will likely happemn
but it's just part of the author whacky concept of science
he can control time, he just doesn't know yet
if the answer is the first one
"is time a vector or a scalar"
there is a debate going on in the community that pops out sometimes
tm
the one who wields the power of god
he's just broken
it's not about the strength of something when you face accel
probably just pushed her to her demise
tho it would have solved nothing
that it's surprising how misaka just didn't push herself to the point of going berserk
i can say
later on
but yeah with knowledge of shit that happens
that's all i was saying
that's from the eng dub
weird
eng dub
Fair fair
Hahahah
good
is it still ongoing?
it's supposed to be a sort of esper power but it's way overblown
but yeah unicorn is good because deepens the lore and missing links, i don't like when they go too much ham with newtype magic tho
rip judau
ZZ?
i smell you skipped
by that
ah yes not after getting|| murdered twice in a row of course ||
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
the man is breaking in shambles, has to sleep in a BATHUB, has to eat scraps since index devours everything, ||and now got to deal with world ending threats loitering in his apartment ||

you don't get to say no lol
and that's his twisted part
Shit happened, he got drawn inside and he wont stand down no matter what lol
<@202444817043685386> i've read the latest index volume. Poor touma, that's all i will say
it drove him to the edge of || suicide, but got saved by the Will of Misaka Network ||

ignore that number
he broke at the last pic

Accel world s2
NORMAL MISSILES WERE USED ™️
LOL
6 months of plotline
Index is just 1 with overlapping events
Fate is multiple timelines
It isn't
Villain to anti hero, to something else entirely || the white freak has a freaking demon and commands academy city now ||
in the main novels
i just can't enjoy it because accel is the one who chardevs the most
is the involution of the character
with accelerator anime
The issue i find
the boy is failing school because lack of attendance <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
then people wonder why touma doesn't do romance
(see at fre/nda - saten)
he never broke the continuum of the plotline between the side content and the main one
there are like 10 days in timeline "free"
WW3 begins 3 das later.
Jail Breaker is where Railgun is at rn
this calendar is a few volumes behind, currently we are at 1st january

nor her chasing touma down the globe || like the stalker she is ||
with all probabilities
misaka in ww3
but the manga is not going to cover
to do railgun F
at some point
Look, probably they will have material for one last cour
fair fair
common opinion of anime only fans is that touma is a bad character
it's extremely rare to find a reader of the novels that would agree, not by a longshot.
in those anime adaptations
loses characterization
sadly Touma, the first of the 3 protags
1-2 are still an introduction but they hold up
3 volumes in 6 eps <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
extremely subpar adaptation

For the love of god
You just gave me something to watch
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
For 16o pregnant dumb show
Then in 2011 the damn channel dropped the anime night
All good shit
They were airing shit like fmab, black lagoon, trigun, nabari, michiko to hatchin and several others
When mtv aired the anime night
I started watching anime seriously in 2006
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Good
Then do not say that spanish is french <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
So you got my appreciation
But you went back in time to watch older stuff
But no people watching too much zoomer stuff
And or early 2010s
If you go back to mid 2000s
There are so many great anime
I see
Class s?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
That makes it wholesome while maintaining the coolness of the journey of the 2 heroines
But yeah people el cazador has some yuri subtext going on
Alright then from now on i will say that you are british then <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

The anime is set in latin america

My take on it is: Non UC gundams can be watched whatever, UC gundam has a clear start tho. Sure one can approach it differently, but my opinion is that 0079 is the best start
Also that gundam discussion is a classic
You will never see me saying "my taste is better than yours"
While I have my biases and preferences

"They wanted something with Submarines and ships, we were drunk and this happened"
filled with sake

no jewels from the underground
and that also means
Uhm i agree with you here
and it's not the same...
it's more that music changed.

err
but i don't think it's closely rockstar stuff
eh yeah

hell even Game fm
of the various genres
Yeah let's say the game covered great music on the whole spectrum
high culture.

jp folklore is just rad.
yeah it's that cursed ritual
It was believed that the spot struck on the straw doll corresponded to the area of the body where the target would begin to experience illness or injury.[4][10] However, this straw doll or other form of effigy was not a definitive requisite in the ritual even relatively late in the Edo Period. For instance, in Toriyama Sekien's Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki (1779, pictured top right) depicts the woman holding a hammer but no doll, nor is the doll mentioned in the caption.[1] In this case, the nails are driven directly into the branches of the sacred tree.
the girl in the video had the same outfit
it's definitely connected to that ritual
<@!161155855524298752> yeah looking at the video
if it was cheery
if it connects to what we discussed in general, t would be hilarious

the screamer undoes a bit and i agree
that blast this song
it's the female vocals
but this a bit overtook the concept

THIS IS THE ULTIMATE TRANCE EXPERIENCE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrvBIKmfJDw
Good one
Eh
but giorgio moroder is much bigger
Probably
Giancarlo pasquini the 60 years old legend
Then initial d happened and we know the rest
In japan it became popular because of the parapara dance at first
Freaking dave still produces eurobeat nowadays lel
Not that i know of, but eurobeat originates by a specific chain of events. Wikipedia elaborates quite enough, but it's mainly a corruption of italodisco/italodance genre. Infact one of the biggest, and probably most famous, eurobeat firm is italian. Refer to delta music, niko, dave rodgers, leslie parrish.
Millaarc <3
it was a tokyo's district if i don't recall wrongly
it had a pretty medium sized and interesting map
well i remembered the yakuza game i played
to give a look into again
well you remembered me something interesting
got it
i'm curious
may i ask what things?
and that was pretty great
ages ago
i remember playing one of the first yakuza games
Uh
it's sad to see how useless he is
he shouldn't
(mind you i play mainly on jp)
out of random
I got him
*angra*
talking about fgo here
uh
gz
good
oooh
lol
and really?
oooh blazblue
^
but he's not horrible
in a way to use the extra damage
Well you must put him
that's true
it is half a let down, half a good welfare
SIEG
and i did too but, hey we got
hoped that
So many people
Mikon ~
Tamamo is one of my fav servants
first one gave me melt, second one gave me Kiara and Lip
with 2 tries
out from SERAPH
i got melt with everything except suzuka
and about melt
Got tamamo with a ticket
ha
and she dropped.
i was there like "Now you drop it"
in a weird way
got abigail
Lol
not whaled yet.
my account is still pristine
Added
will add you to friend list anwyays
i don't like illya
i have her too but i didn't list her as support
*abigail*
i see you're a man of culture
my support list.

talking about fgo jp here?
ooo
astolfo can join both male and females
have gender locked fights
some events in fgo
I'm serious
in FGO it is gender "lesecret"
Astolfo is male in Apocrypha
na r?
and that's not a pun.
i'm going to melt to the ground
if we get a CCC localization
on jp.
with Trifas outfit
I use astolfo
since kiara is beast 3
I know
*SAN ZEN SEKAI*
NOBBUU
the manga got localized.
Guda guda came to NA only because
since CCC is not localized yet.
that SERAPH comes to NA
Look that it's not sure
bbchan ~
was SERAPH
But my fav event
at the time
but i enjoyed that one
i know that
i lose my account thanks to a misstype on the bind code.
THEN what happens?
got iri np5
i played it on jp when it popped up and grinded it to the ground
*wants Accel zero rerun*
makes me angry
There's one thing that
yep
since they will rerun 2017 this year and not 2016
in JP
to drop her
i doubt you will have more chances
That one
must own all tamamo nine
I'm waiting for TAMAMOVICH
wont waste more
and 5 tickets on it
well i threw 30 q
copy.
a third Nitocris
I just ticketed
Sieg?=
What is the cardboard anyways
well everyone knows memes about astolfo
since he is in extella link
should come out sooner or later
Charlemagne
evil
LOL
with Charlemagne
Well it can come out
yeh
Wait he got buffed
but it's not very effective
and flavor
Astolfo is more for fun
well yeah
*looks at GUDAGUDA*
yeah event stories are good
i try to get mats during events
Grinding for mats it's evilness
yeah i agree
but yeah i play it a lot only during certain events
you want to grind it
depends on how hard
good catch
same
my code
232,745,487
want my friend code?
Sparkle i heard you started playing fgo jp, right?
Astolfo is Le Secret.
But D'eon is male
Yes
since i dislike him soooo much
i avoid using merlin when i can
but i dislike it
The combat suit has that switch that's pretty lame
the problem is 15 turns
aoe heal
regarding healing
there's still the mage association one
It's a bit more powerful
^
Expecially after Lostbelt one came out
nah
lv 7-8
Well i have mage association one
default one is kinda..
get a decent Mystic Code too
if i can make a suggestion
a few times
shot down Frank and Spart
to raid now
i'm a bit tired
lol
yeah
*Evaporation of Sanity D*
^
Gudako best mc
at the time
i had so much fun
it's the learn fgo comic
The bio says he wont answer to questions about his gender
*Lesecret*
in fgo he is
only in apo
in Apocrypha
a certain scene
It's because
true sparkle
Yeah
^
everyone got trolled by dw.
about that
there's a craft essence
Don't mention swimsuit astolfo
1 hp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry_TrAjwmIc
at the time
that killed me
other video
*rooma dearu*
old but gold right?
ever made.
videos
this is one of the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxiLeIATgIA
memes
regarding
*where is the regend, the true REGEND of the samurai*
too many mats on her
well just do not waste
Mata is not a decent unit
lol
why mata hari?
with the event
when they didn't came out
everyone got disappointed
aaaa outfits
up there
i have 250 apples
but i can imagine
I have to read it yet
*Cries*
i want iriiii baaaaack
is accel zero
that still butthurts me
the only thing i repeat
than JP
i find it less entertaining
I don't play NA only because
miss critbuster
Jannu alter
well i do have
*washi ja*
to use
anyways nobu is one of the funniest servants
then Ticket saves the world *again*
i was like "i'm  going to cry now, 60 q and nothing"
regarding tamamo i got her on the update gacha
and got her randomly
threw a random ticket
i have semi too
*
tail
I wish they adapt as anime CCC Fox Tal
*MIKON*
i see you're a man of culture
Tamacat or Tamamomae?
i don't recall what
i got altera while rolling for something else
with update
Altera becomes pretty to use
summer fran here too
for example
i have all the alter egos in the game
to line out main party
well i have too many servants
i use Nero, Nero Bride, Saber alter
As sabers
i'm rolling only for waifus
i do have everything covered
and this account started on nero festival
np3 on jp np2 on na
everywhere
because i'm cursed to get Nero claudius
Well that didn't bother me the least
*balmug*
on start
Got him and SIEGF
from starting gacha
i have him
he has nice animations now
they reworked d'eon
i'm glad
#astolfoswimsuit
http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Sugar_Vacation
gn all
i'm going to bed since it's 3.40 am here
anywaysss
*ren ai happa, tekiame!*
i just love her NP chant
then my inner self gave up and Jk saber now sits in my inventory
and Suzuka
Penthesilea
I was torn beetween
Story lock was active on this thing
Mind you
they just splitted out the event
it was like 1 week after anniversary
this was the pool
http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/wiki/10M_Downloads_Campaign#SR%20Servant
gimme a second
Jk saber is life
No no dragon
now should be bigger
*there was
THere's a quite wide pool
i took Suzuka Gozen but then i regretted since i dropped her
on the anniversary
they will give a free SR
Anyways if they do like last year
i have np 3 nero and nero bride
just artorias
No no
and got Artoria alter and Artoria
then i managed to break free
i was cursed at the time on "you wont get ANY Artorias"
The thing is
is MHXA
to get
one servant that i regret not managing
Welcome to rank luck A sparkle
Gz
Wo
za frontieru
or na?
do you play on jp
paying and rolling nothing it's a bad thing.
and that's a shame
no worries
doxe i was joking
Gl there
Whale spotted
with her np
she did 600k of damage
lol
a 200% jalter for berserker raids
well i have
Lol
i undestand you sparkle
ha
Jp
i have an na account but i don't play on it
i play on jp
oh well nvm then
my id is 232,745,487
it gives me an error when trying to add you
is it on fgo jp?
wait
adding you
And got Nobu summer and Frank on second summer 2017
Well i got tamamo on rerun too
i lost my first account on first summer banner
Lol that brings me bad memories
friend list?
right do i have you on
i didn't buy quartz yet
My account is still pristine
now i'm saving up for Tamamo Vich
but i managed to get both versions
throwing my quartz all over the place
i was the same when Tamamo no mae got rate up
Well i can understand that feeling
and i even have her on NA
mine is np3
lol the game throws me random neros
(Nero, nero bride, Artoria alter, and next i'm going to level up JK saber)
but i have more than enough sabers to face the game, i just roll for waifus now
i meant i rolled him
No no
hmmm?
-> I heard you want some altera
Like that time i tried to drop tamamo lancer
in a whole different rate up
i was searching something else
Well i dropped him randomly
my first and foremost instinct was to burn him for rare prism.
i even had him on fgo
at least i'm not the only one who hates him
lmao
done
can i spoil one thing about gawain to you in private?
but hey it's a matter of tastes
it gets better
Well chapter one is a bit of a bait
to have read CCC Fox Tail?
Did you happen
now my proud Nobu Nobu, the nameless one and critbuster Tomoe gozen would be enough
at the time i didn't have that many efficient servants to take him down
it's just unfair
and went full insane with command spells
i just lost my patience
i took a lot of time but in the end
it is a pain
gawain fight
That
rip
lol
sooner or later
i think i will buy it
but cross tag has some weird variations
Blazblue system is pretty cool
oooh well
indeed
time will tell
and voice lines from the VAs
well arpeggio collab brought the fleet of fog ships there
and a High school fleet collab
had an Arpeggio Collab
WoWs
because the reverse is still going to happen
alright
or in wows?
you mean
Wait in azurlane
no it was with high school fleet
world of warships will have a collab with azurlane soon
nowthat i think of it
i don't remember
wait
hf with rashomon
oh right
what was bb again?
