i don't have him .-.
we probably broke raids
someone just cleared a bunch of my raids. didn't check who though
but its really annoying
splitting the channels was needed
<@!147754954822516736>  apparently $200 is super cheap
they don't need to clear every single raid. too tiring
no need .-.
don't jinx it
nah only 5 copies
nite
or event
buy from advent shop
very nice
and we have a god named Teemo
raid used to be bugged
553907791

arena still only has 3.5k people
not much else to say really
its like 10pm and ive been awake since 4 .-.
now that i read it again. it does seem that they wanted it this way
til you realise top 3 is the place to be
could be nerfs could be nothing
poorly worded news <@!157710301779722240>
i liked it this way a little
nah
<a:ASnyarage:515429767021985801>

<@357594748023734273> <@292700103544930315>  try now
Just started so slow
Just gotta lvl her
Got a jii from the pick for a 56 yellow <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
I was counting the gems from the pick
Yeah. Got one from tickets and a double on my 3rd guaranteed
Bought the pick ticket and a single big pack <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Can't kill the autoscorers faster if it keeps hitting carol
Not nice .-.
7 in a row that have hit Carol
XD bikki apparently ignores taunt with her second skill
I think I have ship already actually. Can't remember
Alright. I'll clear a few after this run
Kk
Still got about 45~ cp refills btw.  Gonna stop blowing through them so much once I get my mats
Trying to get the extra 50 gems from top 10?
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
How are you rank 5 spice
haz is hazzy
gonna help haz with his
or haz's
join sycreons maybe?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I feel pretty unworthy now
unworthy
don't call me teemo
<:ItheaConfused:589378964825440258>
oh you were talking to me
nope. only after you retreat/die
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
still got 13k left
you need 1 more now yea?
dunno we'll find out
healers both dead turn 3 .-.
rip shouldn't have gone in with 3
he has 100k left most likely
he might not be able to
k
i'll head in with a 3 then
90k left
176 k left
mine
add's dead
sometimes less if i'm really unlucky
15-25
helps lessen the rng a little bit
i run double healer and aot bikki
<a:ishtarsigh:655941904671834142>
yep
aand wind in however many it takes
kill earth in 3 attempts
neat only 4 attempts that time
yep
might be dead after i leave then
hp helps lessen the chance of dying before she can heal though after it wears off
add's dead
second one is pretty much dead
aot basa
haz's
both yea
might just be using 5cp
he has 70 basa i think
70k at two attempts
spice too good
crappy internet
took ages to post that .-.
last one took about 8 attempts each from master ship and I. didn't look at the others
takes a ton of collective cp though
takes a ton of collective cp though
alright
haz's
<@!99695384296701952> can we steal the jp channels raid pinned thingy?
prolly a good 50k difference
wind has way less health than earth
nah can't burn em
feels like 150k +
than i think trying a blue?
my green
yep
<@!221734538928324608>
got one from tickets 3+1 from guarantee and another on the 7th pull
ugh
oh
yeah teemo gave us about 10
maybe 20 carols so far?
started yesterday sometime
<@!221734538928324608> try now
i'll make some room
yea
help kill faster
nah

boss is up
no 3* to raise rei?
could try after this one
now its exp
first it was gold
mine are only 50 and 46
that'll do it
are either of them above 50?
<:peepoGun:670944846738882569>
what heals are you running?
green carols
you survive too long lol
alright mine'll be up in a bout 5-10 minutes.
actually pulling bikki

someone said the adds had way less hp
2/3 ain't too bad
yep

tech is body weakness yea?
adds are dead
wasn't watching
dunno
Main Party dead in 5 turns
New record
bout a quarter left on my screen
ah all good then
prolly dead in 15-20 mins
second add is halfway
that or red carol
rarely happens
yeah^
worse than body
burns for days
red carol is way harder
nah
they rarely poison
if she's tankier than burnbasa
it'll be dead after i die then
some people didn't have any good healers
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
benefits of farming blue from before
oh it blinds you
at 7k so far with no one dead
ah ic
aren't they the most common thing ship?
>only two rainbow orbs
teemo hasn't been here
i'll try a 3
some have basa
yeah lets not
what did you get?
need them rem cycles
you need at least 3hr sleep breaks
^
well 3 i guess
used 1 this morning to start me off
gonna miss my 30 points
bit annoyed
above 45 .-.
yea
2 minutes late
rip streak'
ah
so who's hosting the blue?
never enough giga crystals
Just need one more
At least I got some this time
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>

<:praise:456595725342736385>
teemmo is back
hackers praise

alright. did about 33k at 3cp
and they do way more
my bikkis are phys though
she does crap dmg
shouldn't have started the fight with basa
30k rn
not gonna beat it though .-.
lowers dmg i think
nite
your raid has half health on the second add
rip didn't join that one
<@!233522344788885504> .-.
for a single unit
thats what 400-500?
killing yours now aza
a bunch talk in fan/general discussion and wat not
yeah. we have 754 people on this discord rn
gib rice pls
one or two normals willl do it
still need 8 more

<:praise:430382114064826368>
ic
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
wonder how many mats they have
<a:ASnyarage:515429767021985801>
i've gotten a total of two out of 7 carols toady
carol hates me
...
<:ASHug_ailuna:580919817348055041>
do some of the really hard ones
<:HappyDay:305396130487861248>
got 3 gigas from teemo
almost entirely .-.

<:ASlove:581267807031918592>
Never mind
alright gimme a sec
<a:ASnyarage:515429767021985801>
heathens
teemo's better still
deal 10% of the bosses hp in dmg
just the pick ticket and a single mega pack
<:LOL:430378222333460486>
to spend on refills?
yeah i saw
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>

9point8 <@410459126208921610>
<@!410459126208921610> good to go
he's dongkong
i think all hards and normals drop it
whichever is easiest for you
clearing haz's? carol now i think
didn't snag the pic in time
the bikki i mean
Casually did another 40k solo
almost
yeah 2.2 mil at 10

gonna die next turn
yea
2k autos at 21
the turn damage really ramps up fast
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
gotta brag as much as possible
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
3 cp
can't search for randos
so many raids active rn .-.
my red has about 600k left if anyone wants to put some damage in
<:tamarip:585555973951717416>
did 15k at 5 cp
nvm might start a body. see how much i can do
was leaving it open for people to tag it
i'll start another one now then
neat
<:ItheaConfused:589378964825440258>
i haven't done any raids in like 45 mins
did what?
people can clear green normal in two 5s
yeah
.-.
too bad
just natural regen
not using cp refreshes
takes 10 5 cp
might take 2 hours or so. but i'll kill it
how much health is left on them?
once the adds are dead you can use burnbasa. wish the adds weren't blue
this burn is annoying .-.
<:NephrenSleep:586352385853620224>
good night
how much cp was that?
ouch go kev
<:FiloDumb:612284518510100515>
that would make sense
...
on xd bikki yeah
however you want to describe it
or wind blowing symbol
anyone know what this water cloud debuff is?

a few different sources then
ic
so you can set it to the bosses hp minus 1 for easy hunt bonuses
carol's adds are dead btw if anyone wants to join in
<:AShappyBocchi:584087490818736138>
thanks
question. would this thing your doing work on the advent bosses?
killing cows/jackys raid
except only hard raids
same thing
think iv'e done 18? 11 rolls
in terms of damage
5>3>10
all good
ahh ic
it's not showing up btw
2.8
got a blue 3* jii?
mine still dies after awhile at 48
that'll be why
what level is your jii?
if i'm soloing it. it'll take about 1 1/2 hours. with natural refresh
yep
done
we're both full
i'll need to follow you.
whats your ign?
yeah i'll help
right it's hazzys
oh

can't do it myself this time. saving cp refresh
i can do about 200k per 5cp for blue if anyone wants to chip in.
<:02sip:678417759901712386>
trying to level up to get more follower space rn
last chance before it dies
so dunno
think they have a pink up atm with no dmg in it
yeah.
i just want pink
only on red though
5
unless it dies earlier
raid will be dead in about 30mins
<@!180486147821142017>  g2g
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
might have to be the last one for awhile. everyone else is active
i'll kill it in an hour or so
Everyone steals my gigas
Sure did
go ahead
we got help
yea
9 giga's
<:picardfacepalm:656120081331388436>
i could have just said that
makes you auto attack until it wears off. no skills allowed
your fighting red yea?
beserk
<a:AStaigaClap:584087877189763091>
blue
.-.
<a:ASAYAYA:582388554760454144>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
<:ayaya:587664869856116747>
ic
oh
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<a:HibikiPanic:670496622194589696>
why does kirika hate me
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
boo
ok<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
needed more reds anyway
all good
150 should do it  still though
ugh this 1st one is going to be a bit less dmg than normal. healer died early
15 per
outside of carol
3* red works as well. but green raids aren't the biggest thing rn
not really much you can do atm then
yea
got lucky with my jii dupes
ai is a shit
if your second healer is weaker than dr jii she'll just keep spam healing them
hmm maybe have your 2nd healer come in after xd dies
do you have a full blue team?
<:MotoDissapointed:650675916191694848>
literally just used my last cp
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Go this go
and kill the boss on your screen
Top 3
Host
the best rewards are from
argo's red raid has 800k left
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
theres an empty ui spot for it an everything
everyone looks the same
ikr
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
that chris looks neat
argo's red
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
probably
<:jalterannoyed:585549716708655104>
this ones hitting super hard for some reason
lucky i didn't leave than .-.
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
or red carol
dead for me
took me about 15 refreshes accelerate
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
but now iv'e lost it
saw it just now
alright
gridlocks?
Just takes a couple of attempts
Carol gets too about half health before garie even dies
Yeah
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
i have a red carol that'll die sometime in the next 5 hours
gridlock the mad lad. has a dex raid up again
forgot about it tbh
neat
a good 5~ hours per season is horrible
4.3k past the first season anyway
it's up too 4.3k atm
<:thinkSad:588639046654361600>
most players didn't get their chris to 70
red is the most popular though
oh right
ü•ô
this ones closer
üçû
challenge cup has it's own refill set
there will be a bunch of farmable units that use tea later on apparently
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
only have 12
and i'll do one for you .-.
send me some cp
<:jalterannoyed:585549716708655104>
still gets a 5 drop
as always .-.
no giga
and 180k on my next attempt
did 30k killing the add
<:ASGuriHappy:582389623813177355>
got second
agh almost got the hunt bonus
give or take 100k
yeah about a mill at 5
i'll take some shots after this one
it'll have 700k~

just seeing angelas
for the jii's?
yea
Amaranthea in game
porkmeister
i don't have them as a friend though
it can mostly solo it.
porks
bringing a level 70 shirabe?
anyone need a red/red carol dead?
<:blobderpy:356439507559514112>
that makes sense
ahh
blue bikki?
dead
got the game paused atm
after i leave it might die though
not yet

Guess I'll bookmark that page ty<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Bottom right on xd bikki
Is the mote of light looking thing heal down?
Hazzys Carol raid has an hour left if anyone wants to join
<a:aNephrenThumbsUp:586862960060661770>
to see if we have the same nerfed damage as jp
has anyone tried a rage unit in raids yet?
Garie otks it
Burnbasa is useless here
Burn is way better than silence imo
Still better than green
ofc

250k per attempt isn't too bad
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
You'd want a body
Garie destroy powers
You go micha>Carol>win
Garie is impossible to kill

Dead
aot prolly
<:thinkingudao:483052061185933312>
that might be a good idea
ay your numbers gone
<a:illyaPanic:393811760273948673>
means i can skip it and spice can carry me
wouldn't even mind tbh
someone with ignite jii at 70 might be able to with a ton of attempts
scorch
burn to ashes
scorch
burn to ashes
why does body burn every single turn .-.
add blue in there somewhere as well
body>yellow>>>green
thought the harder few would be best for the hackers
so why does everyone want carols all of a sudden?
just put a bd up
one person getting final hit is better than none

There your only options <:ASsad:542054693443207188>

<@148653931092901889> either red Carol or power. Hard mode
Someone with a 70 Chris
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
The streak

<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

<:ASDVaHungry:420707995408924672>
Really considering buying the rice
<:jalterannoyed:585549716708655104>
wind is too annoying to fight
yeah. these adds always die before carol
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
garie is the water scorer
oh. you fighting red carol?
adds are heart i think
green raid
<a:aNephrenThumbsUp:586862960060661770>
working on angelas now
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<@!123525331343769600> spice
theres an hour left on the raid so you should be able to refresh spam
must be
500k left on the green carol
adds are dead
Going to kill takafuji/somekako's green Carol now of anyone wants to hit it
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
XD shirabe
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
How am i supposed to lu my shirabe If no  miracles are dropping
<:sadcat:460535420640428032>
already dead
550k left btw
it's probably one use though
maybe confirm with a jp player though
it doen't mention a time limit atloas
thats like the first thing you should have done
you haven't yet 0..0
rip your damage
oh
you got your bind code still?
jp doesn't have any yet
long hair kirika is bae
<:ASpecodrool:595653995448500224>
just want to skip ahead and grab all the xv sprites
way more like an x-drive than bikki's
animation wise
i like garie/chris the best
<:ASnice:582388549437882369>
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
you have lu ignite bikki
oh
Yea
Nah I've got work for another 6~ hours
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Alright. Just put one up I won't be killing it though. Hope for a hacker
Do you just want them summoned  <@179124101942738944>?
Yeah I checked
I've only got 12 left <:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
About 7 rice to kill
About 150k per 5cp. How much health does the boss have?
(M)(D)(P)
Mega death party
Red 4*
Except it is needed in raids?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:ASGuriHappy:582389623813177355>
This might be the most I've ever gotten at once
Nvm 200k left
It's probably dead. Spice does a lot of damage
Takafuji ingame
Also. Somekako's greeb Carol has no adds atm of anyone wants to help kill it.
Dies in an attempt usually
First add is pretty much useless though
Literally can't do anything against triple skill skips
Eh you can outheal the poison
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Gotta love when pharah goes t1silence>t2 storm wind>t3 silence
oh that was hazzys
<a:ASAYAYASIP:582388552977874955>
<:rkkdumb:676615960312020994>
thats probably true
might be overlooking it
raids*
karu's stuff is white background for some reason
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
mlb chris
oh neat\
<a:ASnyarage:515429767021985801>
not a single giga miracle
my raid luck sucks
ofc not
was trying to get the hunt bonus. so close to dying and missing it
was still fighting somekako's
not karu's
<:dokkan:314244521724477441>
Would probably help with the worm advent boss
387060168
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
200k should be doable
Ic
Oh really?
<a:ASnyarage:515429767021985801>
I better get the hunt bonus
Spice pls
of getting all 6
2k is the very bare minimum of a slightly crappy chance
200k left
<a:ASrage:393568217756598282>
and i get like 2 per day
15
i want at least 15 xd crystals in case i get another one
hazzys green carol has 600k left
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
nah. just saw it when i clicked the wrong channel
bit annoyed https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336298054724485131/681669790418337858/2020-02-25-10-11-33.png
hazzy's next if anyone wants the loot
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
450k at 1 attempt
dam spice
ded now
gotta take it too 0 on your screen
nope
you sure that you don't have a filter on?
got my screen paused if anyone else wants to join it
i'll help with it next haz
yea
when i die it'll end
join now if you want hunt bonus
your raid has no adds left btw Karu
hard to do those if your just wanpan it though
New record <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
one for the single attack and another for contribution
do 3% of it's maximum hp and you get two chances
gotta check that one
are you in rn master?
dr jii is doing 21
200dmg autos .-.
this def buff is so annoying
i'll leave*
just entered it'll end at about 10k
otherwise it on't lower for everyone else
you need to pause after you leave though
dun kill it polk
yea gotta lower it more
about to die. it'll have 80k~ left <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
is it still at 153?
getting the worst rng
actually might need to go in again .-.
did that for the last one sorta
yea
ok
it has 1.4mil hp yea?
<:annoyed:387048605464264714>
should've gone 5
it'll take a few minutes. only using 3cp
i'll get it a bit lower than
can everyone do 50k?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
just gotta hope no one else is in it
i'll lower it by about 100k
153
192k
where there any good rewards from the xd quest master?
ya
or pinks <:ASHehe:580919815368212481>
give me the xd's than
I really don't need anymore
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
you wanna see how many giga rainbow i have?
üëå
^
one more carol for you hopefully
so close
<:FeelsDeadMan:503599460522393630>
Dunno if I can get it q.q
someone killed it <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
rip
as long as no one dies or leaves it'll work
like one carol and one colour
i think you can filter one of each category
way too cluttered
how do you have your filter on all 0.0
it's hosted by a mlb xd bikki with
just refresh a bunch
its a random raid haru
adds super dead
yea
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
garie is to cool to die
59 minutes left now
sure
got a green carol up
oh you mean't red carol
<:TiatHappy:355767184343040000>
<:NygglathoDespair:379758492845735936>
50 is apparently the max
if you open one it'll die
less hassle
probably easier to just pm people your code
need time to read it all then
yea
need a better hungry emote
<:ASDVaHungry:420707995408924672>
40 rice
yellow has nothing useful atm
if we get decent damage units maybe
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
<a:gachiCOOL:508726693004050432>

spend 300 rolls for a guaranteed unit

it'll always be unbalanced
27 of those are from red carol

<a:KanadeSingA:625031533966917663>

<a:ASrage:393568217756598282>

~~that looks like zwei basa though~~
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
i'm not even looking
heart was chris. if it's one per colour
you can't just click off all the supports?

got a rage fine at about 1.2mil
had the filter on red
<:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785>
oh it's blue
I can't even see it .-.
40%~ heal isn't really enough
its pretty crappy in raids without the heal memo though
even more so if you have the healing memoria
yeah mlb will be better than 1 lb
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
i also only have 3 rice left and no need of red stuff
4*
dr jii
Erenbikki... Dr jii..... xd bikki.... burnbasa..... mdp Chris.....levibasa
<:KirikaChant:663568587310628892>
Finally got my final 2 though
missed my hunt bonus
nah
<a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
bunch of us were getting hunt from his stuff
sanic had a good night last night actually
everything is still hard
the rest are eh
carols are ezish. red is ezish
<:dokkan:314244521724477441>
gotta refresh a bunch
she drops red stuff
garie is almost dead somehow
oh

red carol at half health
zwei wing is up btw
joined your power
no room
do you have space in your follows?
refreshing isn't working
then an option'll pop up
you need to finish your first attempt
<a:aNephrenThumbsUp:586862960060661770>
i'll see if i can find it
ign?
depending on heal rng
probably would have died around 35 or so on auto
yea i had to manual it
aiming for*
yea it's what i was going for
Did it <:dokkan:314244521724477441>
autos are 850~
gram buster is hitting for 1.2k on xd bikki
wanted to hit 50. for the 100 turn kill
rezzed earlier
<:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
Agh worst time for berserk to activate
you just moved up
nah top 6 is the same as yesterday
just want my basa to be lu already
pain in the butt
some raids just aren't beatable without a shit ton of ~~hackers~~ resources rn
Rage and the carols don't
yea I saw that. just didn't realise it jumps that fast
apparently power raid hits for 800 auto's against xd bikki after turn 30
so
running both blue jiis
