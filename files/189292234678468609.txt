The last "brutal" scene what remind me this is the nanoha New Era . When the girl break her bully arm kick to the shoe keeper . And grab her head ans Brutally hit to it. 
That was "extreme" 
But this one too pretty real as she fainth from that punch
I dont know they deserve it but this was "brutal"
Damm girl wtf she get K.O-d 👀
