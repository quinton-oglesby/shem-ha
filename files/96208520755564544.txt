zipping the last 3 folders now
im on mobile, about to head home if you can wait about 30 mins <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
are you taking it down immediately?
Well its the better option than Google just making it go poof without warning
<@263983345669505025> i wasnt sure where to ping this but since the pinned to the Drive is here https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/361841960820146177/675904076533334045/image0.png
i did not know about this pin, much thanks
but if my experience on the internet has taught me anything, its to take every precaution regarding backups
I mean I cant vouch for it, it was shared to me by a friend

*Aoi Yuki intensifies*
Maria is for motherly hugs
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>

i mean its the same with the bunny suit figure or what not
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
Chris-chan on gohan
I dont do heights
||thats why I like it||
I rode it multiple times
tbf, Space Mountain is dope
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
why would Chris even have to ask, its obviously Miku's book
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
ooh, thats neat the black is much more aesthetically pleasing on Orange Heart
instead of Millaarc, Neco-arc
this reminds me of that one artist who did Umineko shit posts
YES
<:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
even if its old, it gives me life
CUTE
i mean this would have worked much better with Part 4, who ever had this idea
i wish hibiki would motivate me to work out
daaaaaaaamn I missed rwby posting
"Hi, My name is Miku and I have an unhealthy obsession with Hibiki."
The rest: Hi Miku.
I like to think that Miku gathering is just like an A.A meeting

pretty sure that twin spear one is an Eva reference

nip slip
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
whenever I see this anime style I get sad cause we'll never get it again
I could see it
I think it'd be Tsubasa, just by drawing familial parallels
IMAGINE HER HOUSE
god just imagining how messy Tsubasa's island would be gives me anxiety
...
GOOD
even edited the flat
damn thats a good edit
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Squidtinal?
Takomori?
hmmm
You're a sword now, you're a squid now.
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
which end do you eat it from?
i cant tell what kind of face Micha is making here, angry? crying? opening her mouth to be fed?
I've been around the block enough to where stuff like the one above doesnt even phase me
That'd be so cool!

accurate tweet https://twitter.com/clearpurity2/status/1261643342250676224
ohno he's hot
amazing
oh my bad
i get its supposed to be doom but it looks straight out of monster hunter
wholesome
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Saten-san!
the context of the love live one was pretty hard to see, but I've also been awake 17 hours so what do I know
DESS
finally
that just reminds me of an evangelion unit
the light novels for the series is well enough adaption, considering they wont print blurays or DVDs of the series here I bought them to support the series
https://twitter.com/ChuPirinKo/status/1304832776105943040
XDU just makes me sad now
not sure what to think tbh
thats the same edgebikki?
what
wait
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
this works surprisingly well
im not used to seeing that being done though Im not blaming them, backgrounds are too much work
ah
are those official arts? the text on the bottom might suggest so
the tv screen aside
amazing
miku at the top be like <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
i warned you
recently, pikat has been drawing anime heads on hot dogs
> miku is a penguin
<@!161155855524298752>
its too cursed
i delete it now
yep
-removed cursed content-
starting to get into pikat territory
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
all this miku art
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>

<:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843>

hooray for vague tags
dere it is
i cant find sauce
the fact that the artist of the big bikki doesnt do anything miku related should be a crime


DID SOMEONE SAY NEP POSTING
red eyes i would imagine is the reason here
actually thought it was Iris Heart at a glance
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
same
i feel as time goes on, its getting harder and harder to find sfw neps

kinda makes me surprised she didnt first appear next to those two gremlins in Rebirth 3
K-sha should have been irrelevant, change my mind
C-sha best sha

here's a piece I comm'd a friend almost 5 years back
ababababababababa
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

also the animation was very hit or miss
I mean I would say the question arcs suffered because of it
its all about pacing, which was pretty much the only flaw of the old series
im not the best person to ask tbh, Im always gonna point people to the source, the visual novel
also excited for this https://youtu.be/D2ESrHb6utY
I was well ready to drop $100 for it
on that topic, I was super surprised at Symphogear's price
so I'll support it that way since I would rather pay for $12 books than $60 for 12 episodes
i saw, and apparenty the manga is getting printed overseas
my soul is revitalized
just finished binge watching Machikado Mazoku
but personally the distorted faces and personalities sell it for me
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
another person described it as Kaiji for coomers
the figures they bet rattle the mind
just finished season 1
dunno why none of my friends reccomended it before now, but Kakegurui is a hella fun watch
cryin at 3AM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_djNpDqm3Q
