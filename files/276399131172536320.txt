Well, I slept well after university and read the chat rules. Hello all!
god, please, not madoka
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
8 episode. My heart was destroyed
<@!279341087494242304> , yeah, just now. It was too much for me
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Everyone wants to steal Miku. Besides Hibiki
I get it. Didn't look at your nickname
Kaliks?
Maybe then everyone will calm down
And finally drop her.
Without Adam
In general, then they licked each other. I'm sure
On the other hand, if you read the song to Miku when she put on the armor for the first time ... there is a feeling that she loves Hibiki
And there is. But I’m sad anyway. And rejoice
Maybe I find fault, but it doesn’t smell like full-fledged love
sadness
It was the best anime ever. But I was hoping on yuri kiss Miku and Hibiki
