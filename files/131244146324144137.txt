You're welcome
Sure, I guess.
Here you go: https://mobile.twitter.com/Lilpumpkin20001 <@782841825069236236>
Yeah
So this is something I made in Photoshop.
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/779932066065285171/863922759134085130/SRW_1.png
Indeed they do
Though with Shin vs Neo being in World 1 with Symphogear, it kinda adds another layer to why the US in it didn't hesitate in firing a nuke at them during AXZ.
It's hard to think of a song Jam Project made that isn't good.
Basically yeah
~~If you couldn't tell, I was upset when Lafter got killed in IBO Season 2~~
Though it would have been a fun interaction for the two Yoko Hikasa' character (Maria and Lafter)
Yeah, I was thinking the same as well.
I also kinda felt like adding Gundam IBO to the Timeline 3 cast but at the moment, I'm kinda leaning towards no
Plus the OVA was pretty alright in general
Yeah, that Musashi sacrifice scene was just so good in it that it made me want to add it
Also making the cover image thing wasn't the only thing I made related to it. Because I kinda made my own series/cast list in a Doc.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/13vRBz8RDbOEw0VhV4tnYa6nKabp5L7zzufBW8FDfSvY/edit?usp=drivesdk
I did have a thought of a combo attack in my head where Mazinger Z from Shin turns into its Golden Rocket Punch attack but Hibiki attaches her fist to it and punches an enemy with it
Like I could not, for the life of me, find a render of Gaogaigar which I find disappointing.
Wanted to add a couple more on there but for the life of me, I could not find renders for the ones I wanted to add on there.
Glad you like it
<@782841825069236236>
Updated with more robots
I've really grown to doing these since I've found that site that had SRW renders/rips
<@782841825069236236>

XDD
Thank you
<@782841825069236236>
Yep
And one other one I made.
Miku:....Maybe.
Miku is perfectly fine with just watching Hibiki have fun.
And I made with reactions. (Lelouch is there because of the SRW X Bonus stage where he got caught up in Salia's antics plus because I could not find a Domon WTF render.)
And your praise is appreciated, Lexi-Senpai
Only this time with actual fellow magical girls.
<@!782841825069236236>
So having found a Pretty Salia render, I made this.
Thanks
Also added a couple of what would be classified as secret units to the doc
Thanks
The only series/mechs missing on there are Gravion, Godannar, and Neo Getter
Yep
So I found a couple folders with SRW sprites so I made what is probably the final version of this. <@!782841825069236236>
You got the Gallant boi, nice
Don't think I shared this here before but here's my MG Burning Gundam I made
Added a bit of an Intro Backstory for this. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PEd5kAq_f66GLsqhtvZwo1AKupCRZXn6_KSyxn1ZtXg/edit?usp=drivesdk <@782841825069236236>
üëç
Nice
Glad you like it
Thank you 30 for having Renais Portrait Renders because I had the idea for this image for a while but there weren't any renders of Renais around. <@!782841825069236236>
And I just unintentionally found some *interesting* portraits that are in the SRW 30 folder I got them from
Well, I just got my hands on Portrait rips from SRW 30 so I'm going to enjoy using those for potential future stuff. <@!782841825069236236>
Thanks
<@!782841825069236236>
And their respective friends/associates reaction to it
The SRW MS Version of Salia fulfilling her Magical Girl Dreams
Yeah. Plus Fate and Teletha can be Testaross buddies
Yeah, it just dawned on me since I had two Go Nagai's stuff plus she could be android/cyborg buddies with Guy.
Added two more to this. <@!782841825069236236>
Never heard of that show
And Nanoha with two of her Gundam buddies.
Note: I decided to swap out Zeorymer with Gaogaigar
Made the cover for MS. <@!782841825069236236>
Yeah. I was also thinking of putting Gaogaigar vs Betterman on there as well but idk
And I'm probably going to try and make a cover image for this one like I did the other one.
<@782841825069236236>
Magic/Sciene
Thanks. Also you could probably guess what the MS means from the series chosen.
So with SRW 30 being out and me having watched a bunch of videos/streams of the game, I end up making a second SRW cast list: this one being called Super Robot Wars MS.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PEd5kAq_f66GLsqhtvZwo1AKupCRZXn6_KSyxn1ZtXg/edit?usp=drivesdk <@782841825069236236>
Thanks
<@782841825069236236>
I wouldn't have posted it in <#458060276550336522> if I hadn't.
Yep.
<@!782841825069236236>

Yeah, I figured I would give Tekkaman some love
Decided to switch out Majestic Prince for Tekkaman Blade.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PEd5kAq_f66GLsqhtvZwo1AKupCRZXn6_KSyxn1ZtXg/edit?usp=drivesdk

Thanks.

Noice
Part of that when we made this is because we were each taking turns suggesting series and Sam's knowledge of mecha show is still relatively small since he's only played SRX and watched a few shows
That's what I'm assuming.
That's fanmade, right?
YES! Huge fan of both Nanoha and Symphogear.
I think the joke is they're being overprotective of Maria
> In a world where people are being threatened by armies of monsters?
<@149704282793443328> 

You know that description would fit just about any series
So, does that mean KR Build took this from Symphogear?
2015

I mean KR Meteor does look kinda goofy.

I say more like a world where Hibiki and Carol did the Fusion Technique.
You sure you all want to know the answer to that?
Yeah, it can get abit annoying when an artist/writer just decides to nuke their stuff
If I'm explaining this, I'm explaining it in <#336297808221044736>
So I've noticed like about three images that have Maria wearing the Prisma Illya Magical Girl outfit and I'm wondering if anyone knows if this is because of something in the XDU event or something else?

Rinko would have probably work for Tsubasa as well but Murasaki does work
I'm also pretty sure they're going to end up making Chris Yukikaze in this
Ver would probably be Kiryu Sabato
Also probably Millaarc since they're both vampires and wear red
Rinko?
What's funny about them making Maria Asagi is that they had made Tsubasa Murasaki, who is very attracted to Asagi.
https://mobile.twitter.com/ingrumpato/status/1515244060868448261
Don't understand what it's saying but is that actually a good guy Fudo?
In hindsight, yeah. I should have probably posted this one in NSFW.
She is, yeah.
Yeah, they did really good work on this.
Commission art I got from TakoyakiGirlJP
https://mobile.twitter.com/TakoyakiGirlJP/status/1549711450251431938
Well, Jeanne for Hibiki is in part due to the fact of her being a female rider that mainly fights using martial arts/hand to hand combat.

Chris is in part due to a weird dream I had, something I did with Sam a while back or so, and the fact that Chris likes rabbits (Rabbit) and she basically has enough weaponry like a tank (Tank)
For anyone that doesn't know Kamen Rider that much: Chris is wearing Kamen Rider Build's suit and Hibiki is wearing Kamen Rider Jeanne's.

It's from the newest one.
I said that the last one is from the Viz Media website (which I double-checked to confirm.)
This one is the version that's been circulating around on Twitter (And is also the one from Viz Media's website.)

||https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7vDtdWXoAc18Qz?format=png&name=small ||
From the version I read when the chapter came out.

||https://cdn.readheroacademia.com/file/CDN-M-A-N/bnha_321_007.png ||
Also again, they kinda interpreting what he said in the chapter as being confirmation that he's Bi when it could just be that he was talking about him wanting to be friends with Deku.
From what I can tel the LGBTQ+ Community don't like that Mineta, a character who is mainly seen as a perverted character that not alot of people like, might be Bi.
So apparently Mineta is trending on Twitter because of a line in the latest chapter that may have painted him as being bisexual and the community is not reacting well to it.

Something apparently happened with that involving alot of sites, yeah
And Gigguk doesn't really do anime reviews
I like Gigguk
Never forget the Beyblade Metal timeline had Moses splitting the ocean with a Beyblade
But I would have to say Signum because oh momma!
You answered that fast
Question for you: who do you think is hotter: Signum or Maria? <@782841825069236236>
They got a new series of shows yeah: Burst.
I like cute redheads even if they are bonkers
My favorite girl in 00 is Nena
Again, I like Nena.
It's a cute face.
Amuro is the OG Gundam Pilot/Main character.
Mentioned this in <#357682999300718592> but I'm going to talk about it in here: Whenever Crusadermon shows up in a Digimon show/game, it's almost always going to be a bad guy
And then the ending to the Rebellion Movie just made me not like Homura anymore
Like I just really didn't like Madoka that much
I would say Nanoha is the better one between the two
Which I'm probably going to skip said collab banner because it doesn't really interest me
And I know it's suppose to be getting collab units in XDU.
Or its wikipedia entry
Because I couldn't really tell what it was from its cover image
So is Revue Starlight a magical girl show or an idol one?
After seeing this trailer, I decided to go through the manga and read the chapters that we're out for it so far and I found it pretty good
https://youtu.be/Mbim9bzqRO0

Sony:
Season 1 of Rosario Vampire was alright but oh boy, Season 2 was just a disappointment.
Yeah, they said they were doing the 2d animations
Speaking of that, a friend of mine said that the animation studio working on the spider isekai is the same one that did the Berserk 2016 anime
Oh boy.

And it even has its own proto-Aqua

So Shonen Jump apparently had a poll for Japan fans about which manga made the successful jump to anime adaptation in their opinion.
https://kotaku.com/poll-the-best-anime-adaptations-of-weekly-jump-manga-1847078118/amp
Just wondering: who else found out about Dynazenon because of Mujina?
Though I do think it would be cool to see them in a SRW game
I know about their plots and all from wikis/Tvtropes but never actually took the chance to watch them
I really need to actually watch those two.
Medusa very hot
I think that's how the cycle works
||And if that was the case, tell your sister to stop ruining people's lives||
You know if someone told me way back in the day that ||Satoko would end up being the one intentionally causing her friends' lives to suffer, I would find it hard to believe.||
That thing is like the Godzilla 1998 for Mechagodzillas
<:Chris_WTF:763433522387353600>
That is not a Mechagodzilla
.........
What anime?
The 70's punch back hard
Yeah, trying to put logic in Super Robot stuff doesn't really work
Going to start watching Gridman tomorrow
They did my girl Serena dirty
Arc-V was alright to me up until they got to the Fusion Dimension.
Aster got 0 wins
"I fuse your monster with this skeleton elephant, which causes your dragon to lose attack and slowly melt"
Like what was even the point of the brain worm parasite thing in Arc-V
So Akane has the patience to put stuff in trash bags but not to throw them away like what the heck?!
Well, that first episode of Gridman was something
It's probably part of why most SRW games with Getter Robo in it keeps the whole Musashi sacrificing himself in
I may have recently saw this but Musashi's last stand in the OVA was pretty cool
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRlMBde9cQs
Also nice Kallen PFP
All things fear Getter Robo
ü§£
It is the best
You mean G Gundam
Yes, it does. It's so not Getter
I want to read Getter Robo High but apparently only two chapters of it have been translated
Basically strength is useless when your enemy has haxes
Obviously from me posting the screenshot, Borr is my favorite
Also Borr apparently just carries this knife around.
Though I think I like 4 and 5 mainly because of Borr
Episode 4,5,10 and 12 probably
Yes
So, Just finished Gridman and man, it was so good
Like this line for him in Episode 4 was so funny to me
Borr is like a more smug Hibiki to me
I think Borr might be my second favorite role now that Aoi Yuuki has done
Not Ark with a K
It's Arc with a C
It's kinda funny seeing Borr making fun of Yuta and Utsumi's girl problems due to who voices him
Well except for that one guy
Because I know the characters in IBO didn't have problems with killing enemy pilots
I think Boule meant to replied to the sentence below the one he did
So it's a Gundam show that kinda fails at being a Gundam?
I never actually watched it
How bad is Gundam AGE?
Yeah, I would probably say the same answer as well
Who do you think has the more thicc thighs: Rikka or Mujina?
They might be focused more on Mujina's thighs
Yeah, that's what i thought
Curious question but do people ship Akane and Rikka?
Plus I'm pretty sure Madoka is most people's first exposure to Urobuchi's style
Chisa, Knight, Mujina
||Already knew about them showing up in Dynazenon beforehand but Gridknight dropping in during the fight was cool||
Also that last fight was friggin awesome
It was also pretty good
Finished Dynazenon
That reminds me of this one I found on Twitter
https://mobile.twitter.com/JosephH32149678/status/1415390019817254913
Yeah
It was definitely an...interesting anime
Oh, I remember Seikon No Qwaser
I get that joke because of me playing SRW A Portable XDD
That is alot bad
Damn
I mean how bad is Schwartz's racism in the manga
Replied to the wrong thing
That's Getter for you
So that one scene in Nadesico with them on Mars that's suppose to be serious and sad kinda gets ruined in SRW A Portable abit with its regular intermission/dialogue music playing.
https://tenor.com/view/oh-my-george-takei-wink-gif-5296452
Also I would not want to be the one who would have to go up against 20 Kiras
Something.
So someone translated some bulletpoints from an interview the Director of the SEED movie said.

Not to be confused with Dragon Ball Super or Super Dragon Ball Heroes
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IXHhMwFsFrc
So watched the new episode of Higurashi sotsu and god damn, ||Mion under the syndrome is just scary to watch.||
So does Allenby
Probably especially with those skintight suits.
~~Also won't lie, that scene is probably what awakened my young hormones~~
Yep
Allenby is best girl
https://mobile.twitter.com/NozomiEnt/status/1419051517395361796
ü•Å
Are you guys talking about what counts as mecha or not?
Nice
Yes, my pfp is Borr from Gridman
There's an arc after Alicization?
So the Gundam YouTube channel uploaded Char's Counterattack onto it.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dob8mOQ49wk
Higurashi Sotsu Episode 6 spoiler:

||.....Well, Satoko can officially say that she has killed 2 of her friend once in the loops ||
Apparently some people theorized that ||Dynarex activating in the final scene of the series might be an indication that Gauma is still around in some way.||
Like the only part that was kinda cool was when all the old protags show up near the end of it.
The Young Hunters who leapt through Time part though....
I like the Fusion/Xros War part of it
And ShineGreymon is just awesome as heck
Yep
Marcus is friggin awesome
Tamers was pretty good. That's probably my favorite Digimon season with Savers/Data Squad being behind it
Went from the two slapping each other to them throwing the hands and feet
Also this moment in Hacker's Memory:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XauoUPqocVY
A Cyber Sleuth anime would be pretty cool
I heard that and think of someone summoning a Digimon like a Persona
They got the Tai and Matt effect, yeah
Might be that they didn't like the concept of their not being any partner Digimon and the kids just being able to turn into Digimon themselves.
Same
Another season people seem to dislike is Frontier
Not really
Plus Imperialdramon is friggin awesome
But besides that, I liked the rest of it
Yeah, 02's ending is kinda hit or miss.
But apparently alot of fans did not like 02
I think it was good as well
When Young Hunters exists
Like people say 02 is like the worst season of Digimon
So Fate Illya without Kuro then
As for said thing, it was a couple of doujins that had the Getter Team as females and you can probably infer the rest fron there.
Yep
So I just found out recently that the artist who did the art for Getter Robo High also did an another....interesting Getter Rovo related thing. <@782841825069236236>
Oh
Context?
||Also I might have thought for a couple seconds or so that it was Getter Noir that showed up to help, not a Shadowy Shin Getter.||
Yep!
Also Getter Robo Arc Episode 6: ||STONER SUNSHINE!!!||
That's certainly a thing
Why's that?
Zaft is also kinda cartoony evil
That is a fucking creepy emote
Why did they think thst was a good idea?!
Who the fuck is this?!
G Gundam
So Eva 3.0+1.0 is....something
Big Brain Solution: Only have one Precure show on your list
I think they count as non-canon stuff. (Or atleast they do now with Gou.)
Oh right, those.
I mean Gou (the season before Sotsu) and Sotsu only just recently started airing back in 2020.
It's the name of the newest Higurashi season
Yeah like it's been known for a while that this was happening.
Which episode is this?
The Twins and the Village Bride is probably in my top 3 for those episodes along with Lop and Ocho.
Who looks like Rinko?
That's one of the issue that can arise when making an anime adaptation of something. The studio in charge could potentially end up butchering said anime in someway.
That's understandable
2nd season, actually.
No, you're not. Like yeah, Prisma Illya has a bit of a negative stigma due to the whole fanservice stuff but the actual story and fight scenes seem pretty good so if you enjoy those parts enough to ignore the bad then that's a-ok and you shouldn't let anyone tell otherwise.
I mean that was in the second chapter of that tiny manga with the first chapter being a crossover with Fate/Stay Night and said two-shot manga came way before the Illya anime started
I really don't like Madoka either but I did like Fate/Zero and Gaim
If you're asking about shows where a guy turns into a girls, there's also Kampfer and Ranma 1/2.
That's basically how magical girl transformation scenes have been since Sailor Moon
I also know there's anine spin-off from Alternative. How are those if anyone watched them?
||Also rip that guy who got melted||
Apparently one of the characters in the first episode is from the manga
It did.
I know of the games and their plot and one of the infamous gory scenes.
So I saw the first episode of the Muv-Luv Alternative anime and my god, the gore
Yeah like gotta agree that ||Satoko did commit the worst deeds. Like not saying what Takano did in the loops isn't bad either, it's just that Satoko's deeds eclipses hers.||
Yes
~~Black Rock Shooter in Kingdom Hearts when~~
Here's one that I think is pretty dumb:
https://mobile.twitter.com/JonlynL/status/1453032340482101262
https://tenor.com/view/no-stop-it-gordon-ramsay-gordon-ramsay-uncharted-national-geographic-enough-gif-18998518
So this just randomly popped up in my head: but for mecha fans here, how would you feel if there was a mecha anime that's plot involved around dealing with zombies?
I mean didn't people enjoy Darling in the Franxx until like the last couple of episodes?
||Yeah, Nanoha lost an arm and eye just like her Gundam brethern do alot of times||
Question, who remembers Dragonaut the Resonance?
But yeah, I thought Outsiders/Season 3 was alright
And I just realized you meant the third seaso. üòÖ
I've seen the First 4 Episodes and I thought they were pretty good
It's pretty jarring yeah
So I've decided to watch Betterman and man, is the ending them for it a boop
Welp, the Betterman Ending Song is stuck in my head now. It rocks so much.
Also just wondering: How Tomino is Aura Battler Dunbine because I do kinda plan to watch that possibly after Betterman and I figure I just get a heads-up on what to expect from it.
Same XDD
How bad is that one?
Counterpoint: Shin Mazinger Zero and Mazinger ZERO itself

Also is Infinity really that bad? Never actually got the chance to watch the movie yet and only know its plot through SRW
Mazinger Z: https://c.tenor.com/jXiv2wcDihcAAAAC/sure-john-cena.gif
Yeah like I wouldn't be surprised if Koji, The Getter Team, Akira, and Honey just occasional get together and talk about their respective stuff with each other.
Plus I mean Gaogaigar/Betterman isn't exactly the first one to have like two different properties of different genres/themes be in the same universe. Like Go Nagai has basically been done this way beforehand what with having Devilman, Getter Robo, Mazinger, and Cutie Honey crossover with each other alot.
And with Gaogaigar vs Betterman it has the Triple Zero, ||which is the full aspect of an energy source that the GGG Team had used to help them win fights before, take over the minds of just about the original GGG team and twist their morals into wanting to destroy all intelligent life.||
I mean Gaogaigar wasn't really a stranger to horror-like elements in it as well. I mean the Zonder Metals are like the main threat they fight against in the show.
Yeah, it's like you got the hot-bloodedness of Gaogaigar going on in one part of the world then there's Betterman with all its horror going on in another part.
Also I've only watched 4 episodes of it so far but I feel like it's doing the whole psychological horror mecha thing better than Evangelion did.
Yeah, I really dislike Capu2 because of that
She's a psychic
Up to Episodd 9 of Betterman and I really find it entertaining to watch. Also Kaede is best girl in it.
The Getter Arc manga doesn't have an ending due to the creator dying
Pocket full of Rainbows? Is that an alt name for Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers?
How bad are they?
So I apparently just found out today that Eureka Seven is getting/got a trilogy of movies.
So the Muv-Luv Alternative anime has been a dumpster fire so far, huh?
I only knew about that movie due to it being in the Z2 games.
Also you can just tell that my knowledge of Eureka Seven only just extends to the original show
Assuming people didn't like that one as well?

I am pretty certain that Chibodee's dub actor laughed a couple times when it came time to record this line

I also like how Tougo's magical girl form is basically her just lets her Doc Ock around the area while letting her use guns
Also I just can't help but see Karin as being a fusion of Sayaka and Kyoko now due to her having the same VA as Sayaka and having a red color scheme and acting very tsundere like Kyoko
I mean nobody expected XDU to have collabs with an obscure series like Saint Seiya or Prisma Illya or AoT but they happened
And I find it funny that Sarah Anne Williams voices another magical girl that uses swords as their main weapon
So I'm watching Yuki Yuna and on episode 3 of it
Finished Yuki Yuna season 1 and it was so good
Erica Mendez channeling her Megumin with that scene of Fu in Episode 6 is just XDD
Oh, StrikerS
So just checking: the stuff that's in the Mankai Chapter for Yuki Yuna (the one with Mebuki and Nogi), are they LNs or mangas?
Which Gundam is Nanoha suppose to be in the PFP? <@477182101330984960>
Yeah, the ribbon would have looked nice on the Movie Designs
Yeah like Yuri, Stern, Levi, Dearche, and the Florian Sisters originally came from the PSP games and have different backstories from the movies
Not yet, no
||They gave her *'Cue Meme about MGR and Nanomachines here'*||
||Technically there's now two backstories for the new characters (the ones on the posters) since they showed up in the PSP games before these movies with different backstories||
I don't think it counts though
Date A Live isn't even an Isekai
Didn't someone make a prompt where Tsubasa was reborn as a sword afterd dying?
Aliens and Cryptids, huh?
Yeah, the Arc-V manga is.....something
"Don't make me use my giant dragon thingy on you! Jinx! Pitch-poke, you owe me a coke! Pitch-back, you owe me a six pack! Ahh just stop already, both of you! .....Okay."
"You helped destroy Heartland!"

"Since when?"

"Since I had a flashback!"

"Flashbacks can lie!"
"Tell me where Ruri is or the only thing you'll be fusing is your rear end to a wheelchair."
"5, 4, 3, 2. Don't act dumb, I'm talking to you!"
"So you can go fuck yourself, Dad."

"Dad loves you too."
"What the hell are you doing here?"

"This is a tribute series. Fans crave the Kaiba."
No argument there
Which admittedly I find to be weird how what sin Bradley was swapped between the two version
Technically 03 Wraith should be compared to Original Pride since he basically took his spot and 03 Bradley had to become Pride.
Asking this question since I'm trying to reread/rewatch FMA so:

Which version of Sloth, Pride, and Wraith from the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise do you all prefer: the manga/Brotherhood versions or the 2003 versions (and yes, I know one of then is basically the same character between both version just with a different title but I'd still include them in this question since it probably get confusing otherwise)

I'm assuming that's your way of saying it's not good
||Actually, it's a new song made and sung by the same people who wrote the OG song for W||
How well

||Of course later down the line with Kamille being around, the plot of ZZ would change but from how ZZ sets up how Judau and his group ends up being involved in the first couple episodes, there is not that much that Kamille being around would change that would prevent him from still joining up.||
||Yep||
||I said the beginning episodes of ZZ.||
||They probably just choose not to mention her in it since she doesn't add anything that would be important for a Zeta retelling.||
||In terms of ZZ, yeah. Since the Argama would still need to dock at Shangri-La for resupply and repair so Judau and his crew would still break in and try to steal the Zeta and all the other stuff that happens in the beginning episodes of ZZ thar leads to Judau joining on the Argama. It's just that Kamille would still be and probably would end being like a mentor figure to Judau.||
||No, nothing like that happens||
||A New Translation doesn't really actually cancel out the First Neo-Zeon War as you might think it would because Haman is still around||
How do people feel about G-Reco nowadays because I do remember people not really liking it?
Also Shinn kinda got screwed by the creators in SEED Destiny due to them just having Kira stealing the MC role from him
They also just really can't handle the concept of Kira being a pacifist and having accurate enough aim to not damage a mobile suit's cockpit with his beam spam
I'm pretty they kinda know if they actually went in-depth with numbers and math stuff like that when it comes to economics, alot of people would not be able to understand it
Alex Dino just couldn't beat Quattro Bajeena
And Majestic Prince from what I've heard
25
I mean they had stuff like Cowboy Bebop in a game
And they manage to make Shinji into a man in the games
Acronym for Super Robot Wars
https://tenor.com/view/fire-writing-gif-24533171
That's the one from Reborn to Master the Sword
Nobody actually gets genderbent in the second one. It just has a character in it that looks like a female version of Koji and even wears his pilot suit when she gets her mecha

Anyone here remember Tenkai Knights?
And now I'm remembering Tenkai Knights
Oh yeah, Danball does kind count as a mecha
Gunbuster is the only one of the Gainax Trio that I haven't watch
^^^ Need to actually watch those two sometime
Making a top 10 mecha list would be difficult at times the more stuff you watch
Part of the plot even involves this disease in the series that can affect the male pilots (and one of the girls)
Like this can't be the subs Funimation used for this movie, right?
And I'm assuming there isn't any better subs online for this?
I can tell and see
Seriously, someone tell me  if this is the right sub for the movie or not because this is just something
So trying to watch Mazinger Z Infinity but the subtitles on what I'm using to watch seems....abit weird
~~Doesn't really count as wife beating since they weren't married yet~~
https://mobile.twitter.com/Lilpumpkin20001/status/1621612835754188806
I'm just headscrathing though on if this is the subs Funimation used? And if so, who approved those subs?
Yeah, I'm probably going to do then maybe try the torrent/sub another day
I was also trying to watch it on my phone
I wasn't.
Yeah, Infinite Stratos is something, alright.

||I mean it would be pretty bad if the public learned one of their highly respected officer tried to murder a young girl. Also pretty sure Hayate also approved of that since despite all that happened, she still was close to Graham and probably didn't want to cause him any more unnecessary trouble||
Fun fact about the 1st and 2nd Nanoha Movies: In the anime/original universe, the 2 movies exist there as like semi-biographical movies that were made after the events of StrikerS with Nanoha and Fate being consultants for them.
If you ever played Super Robot Wars, her VA voiced one of the OG characters in the franchise named Lamia Loveless
Yeah no, it takes place on Midchilda, which is essentially a planet similar to Earth but it's home for the TSAB and all the non Earth magic stuff
Zafira and Shamal are also on the bench per say since they don't do alot of combat stuff in StrikerS but they're in a better degree of it than the others I mentioned
Along with Yuuno, Chrono, Lindy, and Amy.
Yeah, she's basically on the bench now
https://mobile.twitter.com/Lilpumpkin20001/status/1623818710975758337
It doesn't do the whole "You can't do that" thing

Also Freyja is just Idol Hibiki
I mean I'm probably gonna watch the anime next before the sequel movie so I'll see for myself how it compares.
https://mobile.twitter.com/Lilpumpkin20001/status/1624762948605419523
So I'm hearing go with the Movie Adapts then?
So just a question as someone that's gonna try to take a dive into Macross if anyone is a Macross fan/watcher: Why does Frontier and Delta have like re-adaptation/retelling movies and is it better to watch said movies or just go through their tv series?
Yeah, I did
So I think I recovered from the emotional pain of the Delta Absolute Live movie
I know I said I was probably gonna watch the anime before the sequel movie but I changed my mind and.....

Unfortunately, there's no English translation for this manga at all
This one having the series head and artist of the G Gundam show make it.
No, this is a different manga from the one where that happened in
So I just found out that there was a manga retelling of G Gundam that came out in 2010 that includes upgrade forms for the other Shuffle Alliance members.
Just ignore them
I don't know what the plot is going to be fully yet but I can't just help and imagine what it'd be like in a future SRW game with their being alot of Kojis
It's probably gonna be more like Mazinger Tournament of Powwr

It is abit weird that OG SEED has only been used 3 times (one of which was alongside SEED Astray) with the rest of it just being Destiny
Didn't people not like Kyoukai Senki?
I also really liked the dynamic Io and Bianca had in Bandit Flower
https://mobile.twitter.com/Lilpumpkin20001/status/1628062285682843648
Maybe you're confusing her for another voice actress that sound similar
Bioshock in Japanese?
You ever played Arcana Heart, Tales of Hearts, or Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax?
Curious now for everyone else besides Blockio, since I already know their opinion on it, that know: how do you all feel about SEED Astray?
Yeah, Quattro go boom

How bad of character assassinations are we talking?
So I know how infamous Frozen Teardrop is but what exactly make it so infamous? The only other thing I know about it is that Relena is apparently evil in it?
I'm guessing this was something that shown in the piece of Wing Media that shall not be named
I'm sorry but who now?!
