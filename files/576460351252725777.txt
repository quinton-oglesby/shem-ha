So I have many nicknames
And my personal favorite is p-90
Cuz I usually speak very fast
My username is a nickname I have in school
okay
A pleasure to meet you all
Since we are in the introductions channel I think I should introduce myself

I'm Roberto Ramirez , 14 years old student that is really into anime , manga Videogames and geek culture
In short , an otaku
Welcome
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Those 2 have the best senpai-kouhai relation I've seen in a while
Boxing and jogging respectively
And Maria and kirika are the odds one out
Well, to be fair everyone is doing some related to their gears to train
Biki martial arts
Tsubasa Kendo
Chris bow and arrow
And shirabe skates
I believe she uses a bow for training in the op of axz
I don't know , but I like it

<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
María in general Is great
(I swear i didn't wanted to)
(Sorry for the pin)
<@84343454838030336> <:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
fake rushia , it doesn't have negative boobs size
Maple would have the constant struggle of choosing if giving material to the shield or if eating the materials herself
Either she wouldn't be betrayed like naofumi
Or she would die hours after being betrayed 
Without support or friend to be with
I can't imagine maple surviving a week into shield hero world
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>

<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
And the first part of steins gate zero was a bit too slow for my liking
BUT When shit starts to get down,
It gets better than anything before that point
No, scratch that
The movie IS bad
I love sg characters but that was a really fucking boring movie
So its the movie
It's not good per say
It's just average
Right I forgot about that one
Oh
> The episode 25 i can’t find on MAL
<@453836798796234762> 
That might be episode 23beta
Specially in zero
Cuz there he isn't a mad scientist
But a sad scientist
Some scenes are longer , other shorter
Some small Animations changes here and there 
And the post credit
The biggest change in the directors cut was Julius and Subaru's fight
rip  rem you will /not/ be remembered
the proportion of her height relative to her massive pair of ballons is interesting to say the least
i can see why it wouuld make heat on twitter in that case
i don't use twitter , basically i live under a rock when it comes to this tipe of things
why?
specially with season 3  , i have't watched it but i know its rushed
yeah , the world of toaru is really big so i rather read the novel and understand everything of the world instead of a half assed adaptation
i should read the light novel , but with the diferent testaments and so many spin off its confusing
makes sence
but if he negates an explosion , side effect of an abillity and thus not natural . wouldn't a iron bar moved with a abillity to move vectors also count as not natural?
the aftereffect of IB is an iconic sound effect
do you guys read the light novel? im just in season 2 of index
ohh , i see
but if the vectors are changed due to "supernatural means" wouldn't the illusion killer negate that?
i was saying if accelerator touched touma in any other part but his right hand
yeah , cuz thats where his imagine breaker is
question for the raildex fandom
¿how does imagine breaker works? , like yeah it can erase supernatural things and all but what counts as "supernatural"
examples: in railgun touma stops an explosion that was created from an esper power , but said explosion wasn't the power in it of itself but more as a side effect of that power
but he still stops it . same thing with misaka's lightnings 
but when it comes to other powers like accelerators vector manipulation he states that if accel where to touch him , he is done
but trying to reverse the blood direction whould be supernatural , and thus imagine breaker should negate that
after all , kuroko wasn't able to teleport him even thought she wasn't holding his right hand
so either it works with certain powers or imagine breaker is simply inconsistent
But after that the show improved a lot , and now both annoy each other but like friends
Like the konosuba squad
I dislike the first episode of uzaki because of how annoying the title character was and how much she insisted on laughing at Sakurai's life style
But he still is very important
He always appears in the series with a minor enough role to not stand out
I mean, yeah the doctor is op
But to mention that to Touma , it should have been like putting 2 magnets of opposite charged together
And the frog doctor comment that he was able to put the arm with the rest of his body together with ease
Touma + one for all+ Saitama  training= strongest right arm in existence
Like in index1 final arc he punches someone so hard that it breaks a wall
That's the power of too many nuts , otherwise it doesn't make sense

I don't care as long as he uses those amazing right hooks he has
Like god danm son , accelerator when flying with one of those
He didn't even remember his family until arc 4
Probably because of the adaption and the Early chapters of the novel right?
Touma can't catch a break: the novel
No, just fanboy over it please it just hypes me up for an unknown world for me and that's the most exciting feeling ever
wait , demon slayer aired a year ago? , the time flies when your daily life is so monotone
using homura tamura there could be a shit ton of crossover . like homura ends up in a symphogear-like timeline
> Homura Tamura is the best Madoka spin off
agree , best spin off and best parody
Yeah they Shure are
Like hibiki and Miku less than straight friendship
Like , I don't have any problems with kirika and shirabe being gay for eachother 
But when it's just hints and subtext that never ends up being important is what don't like
^
I mean you have a point
This is the first time I hear that
You've never said that
That's the only thing off putting for me
And I've haven't watched any of those shows years cuz I'm currently watch "a certain" franchise non stop
Oh right I forgot to add that one
This goes to my Moe watch list along with Kirino mosaic and yuru yuri
Pink hair 
And she is adorable instead of a crazy yandere?
You son of a Rachel(bitch) I'm in
What about oreimo's op?
But they are consistent
At being shitty
But consistent
Deen?
Both poorly animated
One for the benefit of the comedy and the other for the detriment of the whole show
I confused mad house and studio bones sometimes
Madhouse?
Didn't they animated overlod?
And the art style is passable but yeah it's not particularly remarcable
Yeah no
Akame ga kill has bright colors and the same can be said about re zero
Like they lack color , they lack personality 
It's just feels like a suffocating summer
Talking about colors
Am I the only one that feels like steins gate colors are dull?
But danm what a good filter that is cuz god danm it looks amazing
Not particularly the show itself , but I won't deny that I really enjoy it
I should clarify that the art style is
Looks gorgeous
Or to be more specific
The lack there of
Tower of god has a good song  , but the visuals
And op 2 that is miles better appeared much less
In contrast
Toradora op 1 is in way to many episodes
Death note op 2
What's up people?
Or something like that
↑
I just us any Ed , good or bad as background music to not feel a delay between the end of an episode and clicking a YouTube video
Probably because I was vibing to the song without putting  to much attention to the visuals
I  swear I didn't notice
I feel like an idiot for not noticing
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Did the Ed got censored?
I never noticed
Why is the first thing that appears a pellek video?
Testament be over vitalization tho
Right , today there is a railgun T episode
I had forgotten , thank ya for the reminder
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
Danm the cringy old memories are coming back
hence the name"4kids"
I've heard so many shit about index 3 that I decided to read the light novels of the previous arcs 
And now I have a crippling toaru addiction
I already read the manga long ago 
I stopped reading because i reached the final chapter of the manga at that time
And the most hellish thing in the manga is that
||Once they overcome the biggest of threats , there is a blood transfusion and the main blood cell ends up in an equally or more fuxked up body||
(btw while cells had knifes in the oh CaW but in black they have friking Katanas)
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Big titties white cell onee-san

Ohh , I'm soooo looking forward for this spin off
We have the magia récord anime
Rebellion has a lot of simbolism 
But I think it's not hard to understand
I must say that they completely nailed the style of animation
Makes sense
That art style looks extremely similar to "kakushigoto"
I just want to see sayaka being a stand user one more time
But nothing more than that
There is a concept movie trailer
|| Wich is just really ironic because bebé/nagisa/Charlote killed Mami ||
The 2 times Mami immobilized homura
Wich is a call back to episode 3 and 10
My personal favorite scene is Mami vs homura
Madoka mágica had normal backgrounds for the normal world and werid shit in the laberints
In rebellion , it's always weird and messed up
Specially the background
The first half of the movie is like "filler" you could say
But danm the foreshadowing is strong in that one
Its confirmed that magia récord will have a second season
That's something , I guess
I felt that it was more misery oriented
It's completely different
Its a solid anime
Until the last episode
I just want to mention that magia récord has an anime exclusive character (kuroe)
That appears for only one episode and is never mentioned again
And the other magical girls mangas are also a reason to think the universe is large
Or the back story of the witches
Like Elsa María wich was basically like madoka but if it  was a bad end
Specially because the gacha game
It isn't as big
But it's definitely a large universe
Talking about the manga spin off
I firmly believe that the majuu-hen manga deserves an anime adaptation
Is basically the same
But sayaka is not dead , Wich makes me happy
> So... which ending you guys prefer. Madoka anime or Rebellion
Rebellion ending
tho i will say that this indian poker arc is a bit underwelming
thanks for the reminder
> why couldn't Index adaptation be has great as railgun :worrySadCry:
because they come from diferent sources , index is a light novel series while railgun comes from a manga , so more information of index is missed because of this , this is more notorious in index 3 that adapts like 10 or more volumes in 20 somthing episodes
Yeah , you have clases
Get some sleep man
Almost everyone killed before bam made his group of friends
There where Shure of betrayals and self sentered people worst than Rachel
Nothing really
When you put it that way
Rachel would try to kill me to get some attention
So Mami
Ha, I don't have social medias
exept only my railgun
i was a bit surprised to see that the climax of the silent party arc used most of the ops of railgun
cuz i love the silent party arc even thought its filler as far as i know , but that shit was hype
i don't know if its because im seeing it weekly instead of one episode after the other , or if simply the arc isn't all that interesting
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
hxeros is so bad its good , its so fucking hilarius of how bad i found it to be , wich if anything only makes me appreciate it more
Yoooo , those yellow eyes are kinda nice
So does iroha
And yukino deserves more screen time
Yes she does
<:KanadeAngry:672861874966233118>
Uzaki being above yukino , iroha , ruka and Natsume triggers me
emilia was the most frigthing thing , wich is somthing i did not expect
she was more frightining that the fricking witch of envy
the whole episode was creepy
i probably will end up watching a few episodes of some unremarcable show /like usaki in this season/ and will finish it out of pure stubborness to not drop a show
I think the s2 of re:zero is better than the first one
Since s1 had to do everything from the ground up and stablish each character from zero 
While season 2 just expands on already flesh out character
And the suffering hits different in season 2 . It's hard to describe
well you certainly have a point , but its still hard for me to imagine a komi san anime adaptation
because you've hear the "show, don't tell" well komi san manga's the exact opposite to that
> i do wonder why studios don't pick up komi tho
as much as i like komi-san manga . i can't imagine it having a good anime adaptation , mostly because how the manga hadles the text bubles
cuz i wan't to read the manga of railgun and i just want to see how much was covered
so just be clear , the what chapters of the manga are covered in the dream ranker arc?
> "You can express an opinion as long not bad one on shows other peope like"
-uzaki hana 2020
That looks straight out of nichijou logic
And I do mean thicc tights 
Like they are thiccer than a snicker
And the first episode spends a lot of time animating the protagonist thicc tights
And it's animated by shaft
It's a fairly basic plot of weird creatures vs cute anime girls
Nah , it looks like it has more to it than just "the gay"
Hence why I said "the yuri won't stop me from enjoying it 
Meaning that there's more to it than just yuri
NEVER!!!
It isn't ***THAT*** gay (leave me alone I know I'm in denial)
https://media.tenor.com/images/b6da4a34a1c291b41c9de00e8060d7bf/tenor.gif
But the yuri won't stop me from enjoying this show
After all railgun is one of my favorite animes and it doesn't have subtle yuri moments per say
Maybe I'm dumb as a brick or I simply I'm in denial
Believe it or not I never thought of combining yuyu's and riri's name to form yuri
Yep
But guess it has or will have a shit ton of Yuri
Fukou da! (Such misfortune!)
And I was praying that I didn't had Yuri
Or if it had that it was really subtle
Yagate would be pretty nice
Exept for the deuteragonist
I can't not get mad at her replacing her sister bullshit
That's the only reason I watched it to the end
I watched 1 
Yagate kimi ni naru 
I think that was the name
A friend asked me if it was good and I said "I don't know let me watch it"
I didn't dropped it because I'm stubborn
When it comes to digesting a ton of information , I don't have problem , but when it comes to character doing actions 
That's when it gets complicated for me
That would be my look on action light novels
For people that have a lot of imagination light novels my have the best fights
But for someone like me that has 0 imagination 
The fights can get tedious somtimes
The problem aren't the mangas
The hardest thing to read are light novels with fights
But for other shonens it works really well
Reading symphogear is like hearing music without volume
<:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>
the one that shall not be named
it doesn't surprises me , she is a good character , though i like emilia more . i have problem with rem  fans that think she is the be all and end all of the show
ha! that emote was definitively made by salty rem fans that think rem is the only good thing in re zero
You'll have to be able to bing 18 episodes in one go if you want to see eva 4.0 in one sitting
And she actually liked it  a lot
I never expected her to watch that show
I once walked into my mom's room and she was watching kakegurui
It was ...... Werid
I find a large amount of yuri in a show off-putting
For example I was 100% on with kirika and shirabe through out all of symphogear

But when the story bends itself just to integrate hibiki x miku moments like the WHOLE FRIKING FINALE OF XV , WICH COPY PASTED THE THING THAT HAPPENED IN G
It's just not my thing
It's not like I despise it either
I do not like yuri
Yeah , I'm a bit dense I know it took me 3 episodes to realize all of this
I was so hyped for hyped for assault lily because cute girls slaying monster that are literally called ***huge*** then the aparent deuteragonist and protagonist being yuyu and riri respectively , they are from the *yuri*gaoka school they are liliths in a all girls school
And that's when I came to the sad and painful realization that 
This show will have ***A SHIT TON*** of yuri
Because those thighs are the best
And the first episode a lot of time just focusing on hitotsuyanagi's thighs
Wich am grateful of
Those thighs are thiccer than a snicker
And the first episode spends a solid amount of time just pointing at riri's thighs
Hitotsuyanagi's thighs have to be the best tights I've seen
***A LOT***
But it was for the sake of *being dramatic* I didn't mean it like an insult to anyone gay
Yeah I was a bit too dramatic
I feel like it's an inofensive Take¿ isn't it?
And I'm not ¿What can I do about it? 
It's just a taste , and I don't plan to judge anyone that does
It just there
It's just an element that I rather ignore , because it doesn't trigger me at all
But as I said before it isn't anything off putting
Well for me it isn't the thing that makes symphogear coherent or cohesive
For me will always be the in-spite of it
Symphogear has funny character , great music , simple yet compelling story lines and much more stuff going for it than just girls loving eachother
Because symphogear is good even though it has yuri 
Not *because* it has it
That's just re using ideas thematically and literally by making miku the enemy by being controlled by some big evil person or Entity
And that got solved , why bring it again in xv?
Didn't they discontinuation was a small subplot in the first season?
I still say I'm not a fan of yuri but my main problem is how a subplot that should have stayed like that , took the spotlight for the finale
Exactly
Yes
He has bad grades cuz after all he is part of the delta force
Touma has to take remedial classes for his remedial classes
It's probably the best part of the show
You definitely need it
It's an ova 
But it's pretty long , to the point I would call it a movie instead
friking oresuki was amazing , the ova/movie was superb
i think that more than a joke it's just that he noticed that is the same tipe of scene from mha ed
Beyblade bakuten shoot looks amazing in comparison to that
I just want to highlight how much beyblade battles have improved in each generation
In bakuten shoot they where boring af and the beys look god afwul
Then in v force they look like a commercial with bad cgi but at least bearable 

In metal saga beys look like actual beyblades and they are a joy to watch (I grew with this gen so I'm pretty nostalgic)

And now in burst they are a spectacle
From the trayectories , to how they spin 
It's as epic as it gets (taking to account we are talking about fighting tops)
Like deku vs todoroki but cranked up to 11
That has to be the biggest animation flex I've seen
and then there's the kai op , wich is good , but definively not as catchy
both are really good
since i only got into higurashi cuz the sequel , i honestly like the gou opening a bit more
and all of my pokemon knowledge  comes from hearing my friends talk about it while i fade into the background since i have no clue of what they are talking about 
i was more of a beyblade kid than anything
i feel like it's that type of series that everyones knows and has at least watched it , even if just an episode
i've never watched a single pokemon episode tbh
i used to do that as well , it's probably the first anime i watched
I expected it to be more subtle
it's just that . it feels , weird  . specially after watching ||the masacre arc||
yeah , i never indended to spoil you a plot point
is like , making another loop , and the same problems are ocurring
is just that the premise is weird
oh , sorry
something that confuses me about gou , is that || is rika still mentaly ancient?||
i never put any attention to the charcters ages so i can't confirm nor deny that she is 11
yeah i don't feel that bad for rika , since i became dezencitied from ||time loops stories||
it's hard to not at least sympatize with the characters
||it was a haluzination from what remember||
in what situation? , in arc 2 i supose , ¿right?
but my interpretation is that  ||the virus makes people act in irrational ways , rena with the food for example , keichi's alucinations and shion's.... everything||
kind of
||wasn't it because of the virus?||
oh yeah im dum
wouldn't that be an question arc 3 spoiler?
can you blame me tho , the 3 first question arc have him as the focus
it actually caught me by surprise cuz i expected keichi to be like ... you know the main character and all
more than in higurashi s1
yes
that's exactly what i don't get . like how is even the vibe of tryharding
i don't get what you mean when you say that gou smells of tryharding
For example ||why everyone died when keiichi wished for it in Qustion arc3||
Getting the info of the answers arcs give you a lot of handsight to all the events
And not just to the reboot
Question arc 1 and 3 get exponentially better when you understand the bigger picture
fuck it , im practicing that . my nickname p-90 for a reason
S/He tragedy , not comedy
Specially when compare to it's lackluster anime adaptation
To the contrary I find it an amazing story
I'm just biased but I don't think it's terrible
Mmmm . No
I have more fun with that than anything else from the franchise
It's a better animated , directed and more faithful adaptation of its source material
So yes it's a better that index , *but* only the anime
Index LN is leagues above railgun
Just thinking what will the writer will do to expand the magic side even more
With more spells , tipes of magic and other mitologies
It's almost an obsessive thought that's always on the back of my mind
Just imagining what will the magic do like terra and his priorities , or vento and his protection against hostility
And just where tho power come from 
I started to like that as well
I stared liking science more 
But as the show when on I stared to also like the science side almost as much
And it ads a protagonist with its own unique set of allies
Hell yeah they do , railgun compliments the lack of science arc in index
Railgun takes more time , but both series do the same thing
Same with the index arc
Or when last order was introduced
Yes that's true , railgun is better than index in that arc
But even index while not as much still show some SoL with mikoto and with the sisters
So yeah , even outside just the visual flare of the fight
The confrontation still matters
Touma might not be the "sharpest of blades" but in the sister arc for example
Theres a lot to loose 
Example the clones , 
The ideological confrontation of touma thinking that the clones matter
And accelerator who sees them as his play thing
No , the fight does matter
A lot actually . Saying that the climax of an entire arc isn't important feel wrong in so many ways
The fight it's the same
You can say that's because the index anime makes it look like touma make it out of the fight unscratched
So accelerator isn't a treath for example?
I would to as far to call the delusionals tho
I'm just a big fan of punches so for me when a punch feels nice , it just hits different for me
At the end of the day I think that's what separates index from other light novels
The emotional and physical climaxes mostly end with a punch
Specially with Touma 
Since he is the "illusion killer" 
There's nothing better than a right hook to give a reality check
And it's mostly accompanied with , I'll kill that illusion of yours
So , yeah  I think the climaxes are my favorite thing by far
I imagine a level 6 is the equivalent of a magic god
It would be interesting to see
And most of the volumes are magic centric , since it's a wider power system so it makes sense
But i feel like there's is a lack of science arcs sometimes
I'll admit that i asked myself if it's actually a 50/50 in terms of those 2 worlds
After all is one city with adolescent with powers
Vs an entire occult world full of saints and other op stuff
And just the story of 2 entirely different worlds 
That of occult religion and magic vs the sci fi and technology is pretty epic
But stop right there with 3 heroes part
If that was all it was , yes it would feel bland
But when you look at each of the heroes separately as their own things is when the story shines the brightest
Specially when they encounter 
And have a Clash of personalities
I just like his character
Honestly is one of my favorite character and i don't even know why
I think it's accelerator in term of development
Kuroko or touma in characterization alone
But saten is pretty high up there
But mostly because it's wasted potential of the main heroine
That's the only character "arc" i don't like
I like most but there are character like index herself I like , that i know are very capable of doing stuff
Look at hamazura , a level 0 and he does stuff
But index with all of her knowledge in magic could be such a great fighter even if just from the sidelines
I have to disagree on that
Since I like most of the character
But that's a point I can hardly debate since we most likely have like different tipes of writing
I ..... Have yet to read that
Except saints
Those are basically level 5 of magic side
Because contrary to the science side , the magic one is pretty wide 
So it's really hard to rank powers based on that
You mean the power system based on old mythical stuff
That is explained multiple times of how to be invocated , used and its roots?
I read most of the old testament and everything so far is coherent
You have an example of how the world makes little sense?
Anyways  it's a tad bit late 
I'll go to sleep , see y'all
But totally respectful I might add
An argument about index
That just got a little bit long
It's honestly depressing how much it got butchered
Pretty unpopular opinion I just want to say
But saying that is on pair with ex-arm is almost funny for how wrong it is
It's bad , but it's not god fucking atrocious like a certain show that's is rwby with low budget
So by all means , index 3 is a meme watch
It skips most of the worldbuling that make the show grate
It heavily reduces the the explanation of powers 
Wich is a shame since they are pretty interesting
Key moments are ruined by bad direction and paceing
It covers 9 volumes
Great ones at that . In mere 26 episodes
Index 3 is bad
I can't make anyone like it more than what they already do , but I just wanted to show my appreciation for it
But I love it for what it is
An extensive world with fun character , setting arcs and anything and everything in between
Yeah , index is not very deep
I don't even know adashima so I can't compare them
Since emilia can't be nominated for best girl 
I say elaina should have at least been mentioned
It gave me kinda violet evergarden feels
Yeah  elaina was so good
Exactly
Steam punk race a cross america (the country not the continent)
For the show
It speaks of mother's basement biased
Lemme guess
Strike witches
A magic user.
Y'know what I meant
"Wich"
So tanya
Nice
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I would say either AoT or mha are the biggest ones
Haven't watched the anime nor have I read the manga
But it apparently is the biggest anime . Period
Is it that good to be considered a cult classic in the making?
Danm i forgot that i was going to catch up with AoT on this final season
why would that be the case?
doesn't maria's voice acterss also voices rias gremory ?
so i made her watch parasyte
i have a little cousing that's about 7 . and she is a masive fan of nanatsu no taizai . she got scolded so many times because it was "too violent"
my mom also watched some ghibli films with my cousing
Wich I don't know I should take as an insult or a compliment
I've never been the type of person that speaks openly about it's hobbies and such
That has let my little brother to call me a " mysterious person"
Then I'm probably like your dad because I don't get the appeal of pokemon
And the first animes i watched it was because of her
Detective conan and sailor moon
Ngl i got interested on akame ga kill because she was watching it
Same as mine
She watched akame ga kill and friking kakegurui
Oh yeah finé engrish i forgot that was a thing
I don't think anyone in my family really cares about what I watch
But i rather avoid having to explain the show and the weird looks of "huh so this is the type of content that you enjoy"
I also remember having to watch it when everyone was sleeping just to avoid the posiblity of someone walking to my room while I was watching it
I thought it was extremely bizarre at first . But then I enjoyed it for the most part
I remember watching that when I was getting into anime
But it's a thing of taste and preferences . So who cares?
I have to disagree on that
I still don't get how you dislike that show
I specifically recomeded it to you because it reminded me a lot of Seishun buta yarou
One question that I've always had
If anilist and MAL aren't the best way to judge something
Then what is the the best way?
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
founding series i like on youtube and with good quality
then it looks like im pretty lucky then
it even changed the op to the japanese one wich i absolutly love
going back to beyblade for a second , i watched the 150 somthing episodes on youtube , and somehow , it wasn't a small screen or high pitched and the quality of the video was good
i watched chunnibyou on youtube , for the exact same reason
i really love sonic , but i rather not get asociated with the fandom
i got flashbacks to the undertale fanbase
for me it's great , but i know that there's more than a bit of hate towards it
i can't say anything , i really got into anime after watching mha
i seriously was a massive beyblade otaku . to the point it was annoying to everyone around me
counting beyblade , i've been watching anime since i was 6
my first exposure to tokyo ghoul was about the same . exept i ended up hating it
i couldn't enjoy it
again , she was more okay with the show weirdness than I
yeah , i also tried to watch kakegurui with her , since it was on netflix
she's into battle shounens
my cousing also seems to enjoy naruto . a lot
she has trouble with subtitles
monogatari doesn't has a dub
somehow i ended more disturbed than her
the face at least , the rest of the character is of course very diferent from karen or tsukihi
the one in the middle looks like one of araragi's sisters
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Or i think I have
Because of a friend . But mostly negative things i can't bother to remember
Never heard of it before
And ... What's wrong with that?
If not more
For every show out there there's at least 10 objectively wrong opinions
It got cancelled , why?
How many episodes had the original shaman king anime?
Exactly  
The preview for the next movie at the end of eva 2
It's what would happen immediately after the movie
And what the characters do and what not
But the movie does a time skip . And it doesn't contextualized shit
Wich makes eva 3 all the more disappointing because of how empty it feels
Eva rebuild 2.0 is by far the best one
And it just feels empty most of the time 
Like in a boring day when there's literally nothing to do . But more dreadful
I rather watch it raw than with french subs
French gives me PTSD
The season is great . I just wanted to complain about the weekly watched experience
2 weeks to watch a single manga chapter of content
And episode 15 is filler
Episode 16 covers a single chapter of the manga for example
The endeavor arc has been stretched way to much
Good . Watching s5 weekly is awful
The training arc is a bit on the slow end of the spectrum
Binge watch it if possible
That is major improvement from say . Season 1
In s5 he cried . Once so far
That will not help whatsoever in the long run . So he is trying to stop that way of approaching situations
Much like the concept of
For helping others one should start by oneself
Crying is deku's weakest and most definitely traits
He know he will bring no hope to anyone if he is crying
Contrary to all might big and confident smile
But i like the idea he is trying to change his "crybaby" nature
Yeah
Midoriya saying heroes Don't cry is the most ironic thing in MHA
Either way it's a little suspicious
That is a good theory
Cuz mineta makes sense 
He sticks his grapes on the foot of the robots and ez win
Not Shure about hagakure tho
People didn't saw her do it . So they didn't had prove that she did nothing?
The question is how did he got into a high prestige school such as UA?
Even character that where left in the dark like iida get a bit of spotlight
And improvement you'll see
But when it gets there . It hits like a truck
Like good ol' shounen
It takes time to get to the good stuff
Is evident from the get go
And again my doubt only was because i watched old Higurashi
People who are only watching gou and sotsu don't even need to question that
My only doubt was if it was mion or Shion who got infected
Yeah even in the question arc it wasn't that hard to figure out
But that's because endless 8 doesn't benefit from showing múltiples times the same scene 
Where as Higurashi does . Rena hiding a body and then keiichi finds her
In Gou the scene is just her getting surprised
But the same scene has is contextualized by sotsu more prominent focus on Rena as a character
Thought the watadamashi and wataakashi arc was a bit on the boring side
I think it's what makes the anime better by virtue of showing different povs
I don't see how all of the info conveyed could fit a single episode if I'm being honest
The Shion arc i mean
Wasn't meakashi/Watashi-hen answer just that?
I think everyone thought that
And probably so does the people watching by this point the braincell lost per episode ratio is inmense
I think Edens zero is enjoyable
But if my pfp didn't made it obvious
I think black clover is where the good stuff is at
I'm just up to date with bc 
With edens I'm an anime only
Oh I've also keeped up with black clover and Edens zero
I think the latter one lacks a bit on the animation department
But solid enough either way
And they keep being together for a very long time
But then it keeps improving
Like . The very next arc
Skypedia 
It might not be as good but it takes only 2 arcs to set up 
Contrary to alabasta that takes like 4
The alabasta arc was at its time
Peak one piece
And now I'm 500 chapter's in
And the more i read the more invested i was
One  piece it's weird
I just started reading it because everyone said it was good
And it was the most popular manga ever
So in my mind . It had to do something right to reach those heights
The most I've done is re read the fights in magical index 
But the manga Versions
Yo i wish I had i been reading too much manga lately
Specially one piece so i left index as a secondary priority
Black clover also made something like that
It took a fan made novel
And add it to the manga plotline
I don't really have an opinion of FT since I haven't watched a single episode
But i know people love to shit on it
I have not touched mashima's previous works like Fairy tail for example
But from what I know . He improve his story telling in Edens zero
In a futuristic world and emp might as well be a nuclear bomb
But i think she hasn't had a lot of utility as of late
Pino is one adorable robot
That always end up backfiring
With the whole . I'll be back 
Next week . With another plan
Isn't that anime the one where the main character is a Saturday morning cartoons villan?
Is not hard to have a bad impression of them at first
There is in general a lot lies and deceit when it comes to the sonozaki family in Higurashi
Not to mention ||that time she crusified satoko ||
I think we all did
I honestly was thinking the same haha
She should be . Because of Demon lineage an all o that
She is just very incompetent
More like ||one fucking the other until they break the other will||
And the best thing that the show did to pseudo redeem ||satoko . Was to split her so one part was "guilty" and the other one wasn't||
Exactly
||plus . Knowing the full extent of rika suffering in the time loops and still deciding to fuck her over . Is nothing but a dick move||
||While toying with the life of her friends for a childish cause||
||one kills for all the previous things mentioned  and satoko kills because ... She doesn't feel like letting Rika archive her dream . While also knowing about loops||
But it's is right tho . Compared to sotsu's antagonist 
Takano is way more redeemable by comparison
And gave her a lot of character change
Sadly she is hardly relevant in most but one arc . Where her lack of presence is the most important part
And then gou and sotsu happen
And that's it
I'm still waiting for a novel to be something like
I died and didn't reincarnated
And it's just a prologue of how the main character dies and chapter one is just his funeral
Cheesekai <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Damn trying to catch up with mushoku tensei novel is has left me far behind from the anime
it was the best of it's time but kamachi too goated to stop at that level
i really have to catch up . i like basically every character and i want to see where they develope
i see
and just touma's character progression
my expectatives are sky high for that arc
i really have been procrastinating
same place i was last time , left it at NT 5
so if i forget a plot point a simple description will do , same with characters and organizations
what i did was , just . read the novel and if i was confused , i had the wiki in another window
changing completly your structure for a single volume is a power move
he made 24 volumes with a consistent structure and decided , nah for this one i'll do somthing radically different
and NT4 with it's almost total lack of any known character for the most part while also having a totally different chapter to chapter structure was somthing
like not gonna lie , NT3 took full concentration of me because there was so much shit happening that it was kinda confusing
i alredy forgot most of the important details to follow the plot
and i hate it
i know
You got the OG saga , that is old school anime as it gets
The metal saga and it's more modern animation for a new generation of kids
And then burst with it's genuinely great looking scene's of spinning tops duking it out
Low-key a very good anime 
Even when the objective is to mainly sell toys
There needs to be more references to Beyblade
From one insanely long work of fiction to another that is just as long
Need to catch up to one piece to read the NT novels
Let's goo . Some demon girl next door recognition
that show just soured me
i can't get to like the black haired girl for the life of me

The difference is even more notorious when you ad one of madoka's character song
