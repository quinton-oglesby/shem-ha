magirevo v1
this kind of back-and-forth is really funny. make sense why they look older than they look already. . <:kekcry:1020632584348258414>
just read magirevo ln opening, and it started slight differently from the anime. .
good magirevo first episode. .
someone wanted them both having tilty's colour but due to the lighting around ani's head, dark colour for her is blursed, when in contrast to illya, so had to use euphi's colour instead which is light. .
the truth they never wanted you to know. . ||jk/meme||

sugar apple seems worth watching. .
