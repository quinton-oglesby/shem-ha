<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Chris better slap someone in the stage play like this

NOOO

So no space music sad

Twinkle twinkle little star
STAR MUSIC
Space music
Chris amalgam
Gotta push it somehow
Shem-ha seeing misunderstanding
Can’t misunderstand if everyone is you
Since she started believing in God
Cuz the moon is beef stroganoff
Yea I just found it on 4chan

Ask and you shall receive
<:GWjojoJotaroSweat:363025412105830420>
That episode was crazy
I loved this part when the music stops
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
LETS GO
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Apple juice

THE FLAMES ARE SO COOL
Got me so hyped at the end
Probably my favourite
I loved this episode
Hopefully we’ll get a movie that’s what I hope
can we get a 40 min last ep please
I’m crying rn cuz of that
I just got caught up recently and it’s ending
Oh alright sorry
I’ve watched it like 20 times now and I still get hyped
I have the last scene saved on my phone
Which is still gonna hurt
I think they’re just gonna get amnesia
I don’t have pets either
Big facts
I don’t need friends they disappoint me
Imma try rewatch Symphogear twice next week before the final episode it’s mad lad time
I literally started saying to everyone I know to watch it to find out its ending
I am the bone of my sword
Stop this madness
No
Don’t think about it
Not blue waffle
No
Lord have mercy
Oh so I check the chat and see this
Chocolate
<a:ChrisAngr:625356488214315008>
I can’t wait for tomorrow
Bro I’m so hyped
Twitter is getting deleted too much spoilers
This will be me tomorrow night
<a:illyaTriggered:393589454121730049>
I personally don’t have a ending in mind I just want to feel satisfied that’s all
Wasn’t Chris always long haired?
So I’m happy
I haven’t spoiled myself so far
Lol
I got work to do
I’m trying to distract myself so much but I can only think about Symphogear
My curiosity is killing me
I’m gonna wait for subtitles
See you all
Yep I’m out
I finished  it
Can’t wait to for it to get broken more by the rest
Chris’ b side is breaking my heart
Probably gonna make me cry a lot
I need to listen to them all
Im such an idiot
Where do I listen to them?
I haven’t listened to any b side I feel like a horrible human being
https://twitter.com/yametetomete/status/1178298158402674691?s=21
Memeing the fate vn great lmfao
I’m tempted to get into XDU but I don’t want another fgo
F
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
The reference makes me even more sad
NOOOO
BRO
If I had the money
I’d do that
Wasn’t granblue a Japanese only mobile game
I’m probably just seeing uk a lot that’s why
Not to big
Symphogear seems kinda popular in the uk
Hi man niceguy-kun is a great guy
Niceguy-Kun is a GOAT
https://twitter.com/feyntan/status/1178890316989878273?s=21
I think someone was talking about a fan fighting game for Symphogear before
Well the heroes really didn’t like naofumi at the start well more like annoyed at him cuz he was the only one who didn’t die
In the light novel the queen actually controlled the situation
I own the first Volume of the light novel still reading through it
The anime was pretty cool I liked all of it
I think also a raphtalia scene was different is all the versions
One change from the anime to other sources is how the queen was portrayed
When I found out it was ending I wanted to punch something
I’m almost caught up with Symphogear just need to finish season 4 and catch up to season 5
Demon slayer
Quintuplets
Promised neverland
Everything I like is ending rn
I can understand not getting into harem shows it’s not really my thing either but I do like quintuplets which is a really good harem
Yea and If you actually watch it/ read it, I found goblin slayer enjoyable as it showed goblin slayer slowly develop it not a mindless killer of goblins and actually want more in life
Whenever I hear about politics in anything I just leave it isn’t my thing
What happened to friendly debates
Like there is no need for that
This is what I don’t get about twitter one opinion said “oh look it’s a clown”
Taking it a bit to far lol
But
Like I can see that they want to defend there series that’s cool
They’re passionate lmao
I just scrolled through there post
Would be bad if they didn’t
But they learnt from their mistakes
Like the scene in the battle when he fought moto
Also they slowly started to understand that Noafumi really wasn’t bad
Oh yea vinland is really good
He also has a new manga called heros which is just fan service of all 3 series together
I might start it one day when I got sometime and not filling myself with new manga
~~well like I know of it and somethings but never read it~~
~~I never read rave master so I thought it was a ft joke~~
That plu was a dog?
Wasn’t that a joke in ft
Like yea take good care of your dog man
If I remember
Plu is a waiter
Yea
Yea for sure I’m thankful for that
But she isn’t my favourite girl in ez
Yea I prefer Rebecca over Lucy
It’s more of an actual adventure
They don’t have guild stuff like ft
Yea
Ez is really enjoyable especially since it’s space stuff that I love
