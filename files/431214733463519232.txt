cover up her mouth and you have a frowning snake-person with weird puffy cheeks
looks like thouser
_and is that thouser i see?_
is that a homebrew guide for an rpg?
Do we happen to have a source for that build genius pic though?

i mean, everyone can agree we'd eat chris in a certain sense of the word
Just a fluffy ball of sweetness
I imagine this to be Chris in the AU where her parents didn’t die
https://twitter.com/n_niyu/status/1221949509795663873?s=21
Silly voy, gay is an all-day affair
I’m just sayin either way it’s a centuries-old loli and a homunculus who probably isn’t over a couple years old
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Think about that
Again, since carol made elfnein, technically she’s elfnein’s mom
i want those as keychains
cute
I need more fanart of ponytail Chris in a sports bra and yoga pants
death by snu snu is the only acceptable means of death
Twintails Bikki looks cute though ngl
the second last one you sent
that basa looks like reina from hibike
doesn't hurt to have files saved in an external hard drive
and if you have the image on hand it's easier to just saucenao it i guess
yeah makes sense
or is her source search functions limited to this channel?
can shirabe do source search if you dm her a pic?
if you've ever downloaded full-size fanart off pixiv you definitely have at least 1 picture that's over 50MB
you underestimate kerrik's image archives
lol aria
it takes less than 5 seconds
it's not that hard to extract zip files anyway
they will have that tuft of fluff on the inside
foxgirls generally have fluffier ears
i just want more carol art lol
not really
sfw carol art?
and it doubles if we get to level 3 boost
much obliged, kerrik
i'm into the "one half of the pair falls asleep on the other while they're being comfy" kind of thing
this one's my favourite
of course he does <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
kerrik i don't suppose you have pics of DMJii snuggling in their sleep?
nah you can be possessive without being yandere
reminder what they did to miku's character for the abridged
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
nah her favorite food is miku
the line is just "sorry i forgot about our promise"
there wasn't any details on the "promise"
but actually she's real angry and so all bikki has for dinner is rice
and miku's like "oh i'm not angry"
it's more like hibiki forgot a promise to miku

nah miku definitely the top
she just pretends to bottom when out in public
i get the feeling she'd smack bikki with her braid regularly
i still like to imagine what if carol was the one who became the tech support for SONG instead
(in more ways than one)
so it's not that her trademark food is shrimp, she _is_ a shrimp

I find asking very specific “why” questions helps draw out real reasons in this situation
I think rather than just jumping to “they just don’t want me to grow up” you should sit them down and make them tell you exactly why they feel you should take that extra year
What are their reasons for it though
Good man
Sounds like your dad is just guilt tripping you into doing stuff to make himself feel better about not being your dad, if you get what I mean
I see
So basically after trade school you can only get a job while after technical school you can still go to university?
How is that different from a technical school?
Jk
A school where you learn to play trading card games?
What’s a trade school?
Cya
Primary school into Express stream in secondary school into Junior College and then into university after 2 years of ~~prison~~ compulsory military service
By Singaporean standards anyway
Now that I think about it I’ve been on basically an elite track education-wise
And from there the paths gets convoluted
Like in Singapore, after primary school you get streamed into “Express” (the smart kids), “Normal Academic” (the not so smart kids) and “Normal Technical” (the “you really can’t study” kids)
Though functionally that’s how it works
It’s not like you’re 100% set on a single path after a certain point
Yeah I think it’s because past secondary education you can kind of crossover different systems
I’m only now realizing how convoluted it is
This is the full overview of Singapore’s education system
I live in Singapore and we do a different system (that I think is similar to the UK? I’m not sure)
Man I live in a very different system
that's literally it
i'm saying cut people some slack
you're coming off as "change it right now, no buffer"
what anand said is my point
and that's what i mean
like "change it right the fuck now"
but i don't feel it's fair to force that ideal
maybe i misinterpreted, in which case i apologise
but what i read your statements as is "do it for literally everyone you meet"
we have never said we refuse to do it
and i respect that
so to force the line of reasoning "if you don't use gender-neutral pronouns you're an asshole and nothing else" is pretty bad too
for some of us we are in cultures that simply don't have this issue of pronouns or it hasn't become a big issue
imo, based on your analogy, then i say there's a difference between striding up and slapping a person across the face as greeting or accidentally slapping people when you moved your arm
I’m from Southeast Asia
If I’m offending or misunderstanding anything I apologise
I’m not defending. I’m trying to make this as neutral as possible in hopes you see my side of the situation
I mean if you guys still wanna go ahead with pronoun roles it’s fine, I just find that it’s not necessary
Barring a small minority of assholes
If people make the genuine mistake just correct them, tell them to be mindful in future for others, move on. Generally people who misgender by accident is due to their cultures and if they hang out on the internet and are appropriately mature they’ll be okay with changing and being more mindful
But like I’ve said before
the curse of balal in action
this whole thing stemmed from people misinterpreting each other
that's when we sit down and talk it out like this
anyway we cool now?
and uh i personally don't think pronoun roles are necessary since we _just_ finished a discussion about trying to use gender-neutrals from now on
i just ask for you to bear with me while i do
so for me, i will try to change
again, we are not cognizant of such things because we were (probably) brought up in communities where this wasn't a consideration and in fact i was taught in school to use "he/him" as a gender-neutral pronoun
maybe me and argo expressed it wrongly
see that's where you misinterpreted me and argo i think
can we all just agree on this and move on from the topic?
so in conclusion, i will try to default to gender neutral pronouns, but if i mess up due to me growing up in a culture where this was never a consideration, i hope you cut me some slack
maybe because it's late, but i took your statements to be way more aggressive than you may have intended
see i understand your side
Can I call you Priaria for short?
It was a misunderstanding on my part
Because I interpreted your statements as an aggressive stance to force a whole “don’t misgender or you’re a heartless monster” kind of thing. Guess I got a instinctive knee-jerk reaction because I see this sort on twitter
Again, sorry for the unintentional triggering of drama
Guess I need to work on it though since it seems like I garnered a lot of illwill with the way I went about it
Which is why I try hard to appease and discuss when things like this come up
Coz getting bullied growing up let me know how badly it hurts when someone goes out of their way to hurt you
I am though
Melua it wasn’t a permission thing it’s just something I said out of force of habit from other servers I hang out in
And I’ll make sure I try to use “they/them” from now on but if I mess up please be tolerant with me
K if pronoun roles are optional go ahead
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
What have I started?
Hi ship
Is flour an ingredient for a sandwich?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
So…
But I think if I start it here imma start a fight
Okay this reminds me of a discussion I’ve had on several servers
That’s what happened
The Curse of Balal
Can we agree on that?
We’re all just here to talk about singing lesbian power rangers
I thought we resolved the whole issue like over 5 minutes ago
Actually I’m not sure what the issue is anymore
Ironically though I’m more comfortable sharing about myself in discord than I am sharing face to face
Probably
I guess we feel lonely because we’ve been conditioned to think only face-to-face friendships are valid I guess? Which is why some of us out there still feel lonely despite being highly active in online platforms like discord
That sucks
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
This is why I hang out on discord
Doesn’t help that I’m bad with faces so I get situations where someone says hi and I say hi back but in my head I’m like “who the hell is this person?”
I can relate to that. I’m in university as well and I get the feeling that for every new person I meet I’m just establishing the relationship for as long as we require it (whether it be for a class or a project) then after that we become strangers
Yeah my favourite youtuber and his comment section told me it’s bad so it must be bad
all this, and they're still gonna delay leaving the EU for the next ten years
because they're just trying to shift blame for themselves being dumb in my perspective
imo no
good point
Yeah it probably is
So you meant that thing where online communities refer to guys as “king” and girls as “queen”?
Or maybe I’m dumb and whiskey was referring to something else altogether <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I assumed it was the “YAASSS KING/QUEEN” thing you see online
Coz I’m equally clueless
I’m asking
If that’s offensive would the “queen” meme be offensive too?
btw if any of my statements make anyone uncomfortable let me know
sounds like if you did anything other than push her you'd get reported and put on a list
smh
christ
so what, they were planning to wait till you touched their kid inappropriately before doing something?
imagine falling off your stroller headfirst and your dad doesn't even rush to rescue you when you're stuck upside down with your face on the ground
i felt so sorry for that kid
right?
i'm like "bruh your kid hit the ground headfirst pick up your kid first"
as the kid is crying the father is busy sheepishly smiling at everyone in the car as if apologizing for his kid making noise
i turn around and saw the toddler in the stroller took a spill headfirst out of the stroller
and then you hear a thud
the train lurched a little
and then there was the other time a father with a kid on a stroller on the train
yeah i had to ask the father _who was standing right the fuck there_ to tell his kid to not do that to a random stranger
the father was standing right there
like 3
i can't yell at a toddler
i couldn't exactly do anything
i've had toddlers start slapping me on the leg when i sit beside them in trains and their parents don't make any indication of stopping them
whether financially you can raise a kid aside, a lot of parents let their kids just be pricks
nah i think it's beyond that
whenever i see that internally i'm like "bro the kid was made because you decided to jizz into her, so do your damn part helping out dammit"
that or the fathers just hunch over their meal while the mother struggles to soothe their crying kid
so many parents let their kids just go wild
i just need to go outside and have a meal at a family-oriented restaurant to see it
but more often than not those people are vastly outweighed by those who have no business raising a child whatsoever
lol
"oops i have 4 kids now"
then i forced myself to sign up for shit like being a guide for school open houses and stuff
for me i was similar
that's something you have to work past yourself
but someone who can kick your ass into gear
of course not to the point of bullying
the harsher the better
get yourself a buddy to push you
and i admit i'm lowkey scared of anyone below the age of 13
kids perplex me tbh
when the current bunch of humans have all died out and that's assuming the next generation doesn't have that bias
to shift these bias will take at least a hundred years
i think the bias will remain for basically forever
and my filter is not working
doesn't help that i had a long day (and i can't rest yet) so my brain is a little loopy
i tend to get a bit over the top when it comes to things like this
my brain may just be in a bad feedback loop of only getting the feeling of being productive if i'm doing actual university work
at the back of my mind i'm always like "i need to do something work-related to feel productive"
that's my issue though
you guys ever get that weird feeling of anxiety where you're caught up with your work but you still feel like you need to do stuff so you just sit there guilty about not doing anything productive? And how do you deal with it?
your body's instinct to breathe is dependent on your blood carbon dioxide levels rather than low blood oxygen levels
yeah
Which is ironic given how people champion individualism and emphasize how humans are social animals
I feel like mental health now is in the same situation as sexuality way back when
I find that it’s weird that talk of mental states and mental issues is such a hush hush taboo
Yeah true
But hey, that’s the media for you
Which is honestly unhealthy and takes away from the main issue
It’s much easier to attribute it to an easily-seen external factor
Thing is, talking about mental states is kind of a bad word in media nowadays
I actually spent an hour trying to articulate to him why that is bad
Like not bragging about results when one person in the friend circle is upset over failing an exam
In fact one of my friends who was autistic made me realise how we don’t really think about why we have certain norms
I’ve met many autistic people, and I find that they are generally harmless except the ones who are just legitimate assholes using their condition as an excuse
now i'm imagining kerrik being hung upside down getting the blood drained out of him
never expected to find a fellow Dr Hope fan here
a little late, but i noticed someone mentioned they watched a british junior doctor
oh yeah definitely
like Agent K said: " A person is smart; People are stupid"
i feel like that sums up my feelings towards humanity in general
That whole volume of contents is like “Trigger Warning: the novel”
It did
Even in the novels
Honestly the parts of Konosuba adapted for the movie marked the point where the jokes start being in extremely poor taste imo
yeah the big problem is his hypocritical 180 on nekopara
everyone hitting him where it hurts with his wife lololol
didn't mother's basement get under fire for suddenly shitting on nekopara despite shilling it before the anime was a thing?
> mother's basement
> giving good examples to back up his points
pick one
does monster musume have a ||hermaphrodite angel|| though?
and probably put in earphones and not watch it in public
it's a show you need to turn your brain off for
i like ishuzoku reviewers though. it's trashy but i love it for that
all which involve them being observed to some degree of sexualism
you have animal girls, and you have monster girls
this season is a trip
That’s a mood
“Can’t beat that monster? Just fucking eat it!”
Bofuri is amazing
Well as someone who watched sympho, I’d say that this show will end with nothing more than teases
i'm watching this one coz it's got possible yuri
https://myanimelist.net/anime/37890/Oshi_ga_Budoukan_Ittekuretara_Shinu
this one
https://myanimelist.net/anime/40148/22_7
i'm watching it for meme queen Sally Amaki but damn that show is edgy
anyone watched the 22/7 anime?
and here i thought log horizon was dead after its author was charged for tax fraud
hey
imo you are not allowed to cry about spoilers on a show that finished a year ago
the statue of limitations on spoilers is over
imo if your perspective on eva characters doesn't change after 5 years from your last watch you may have a problem
yeah, basically
i think eva is one of those shows where watching it at different phases in life lets you appreciate how you as a person has developed
i hated it
> gigguk
ew
like he didn't fucking learn from fairy dance
i got pissed when kawahara wrote _another_ rape scene
i didn't get into alicization tbh
they're just combining 2 things that are hated to hate together
well i feel that saying SAO is an isekai is fundamentally wrong
yeah but now that isekai is a saturated genre and usually shit on, isekai stuff that aired before the isekai boom are hated by association
and since it's technically isekai you also have people hating it just because of that
yeah and the sjws went all "reeeeeee sexualising 11-year-olds"
all the sjws latched on that panty shot intro
because of shiro
i know it was controversial when it aired
ngnl is highly loved?
i'm asking coz i haven't seen a new volume out for ages now
he was said to have infringed copyright by copying someone else's art no?
speaking of authors caught for crimes, anyone knows what happened to the author of NGNL?
i forgot the name
uh
i bought the second sao game
asuna is less of a non-character
sao progressive is much better tbh
if you pick at an SAO hater's head long enough it's really just about kirito
and a lot of SAO hate is, at its core, kirito hate
i think asuna is hated due to how much missed opportunity she had
i loved the mother's rosario arc
asuna is great when she isn't a damsel
coz they literally just took the early part of the LN where he was a little bitch
the anime did haruyuki dirty in characterisation
When?
Excalibur is plot-relevant?
doesn't help that the camera gets fucked when you fight bosses coz they're all flying
lost song was so fucking tedious by midgame
it was boring
yeah that
it still blows my mind how bang dream flopped so spectacularly when it first came out but now is successful enough to have 3 seasons and keep going strong
AA is just bad
I want someone to hype about it with
Read it
It leads to the hypest arc of the series imo
Coz fucking hell let me tell you
Nothing about what happens after yes?
You just know why she got the bullet
Oh the Aria and scarlet bullet shit get even better
Spoilers for that ||apparently Kinji started working with Section 0 due to some deal with Shiranui and Aria is tracking him||
And it does not bode well for our duo
That had Aria and Kinji as antagonists
The author also had another series that got axed
If anything their appearance in the main novels was to advertise AA
And actually they made AA before the characters appeared in the main series
HNA AA is yuribait
||”Local man literally too horny to die”||
Kinji’s powers in the LN can be summed up with a single sentence:
The LNs are even better coz they go to such levels of absurd for Kinji
Right?
Sad
Damn I missed discussion on Hidan no Aria
Hidan no Aria discussion
What will r/anime shit on with no isekai?
Yeah this season is surprisingly lacking isekai
Shieldgirl isn’t isekai
Then I dropped it hard when Aqours became a thing
I used to be really into LL
I’m only watching it for meme queen Amaki Sally
22/7 is a crazy angsty mess right now
Which one?
Namely
OshiBudo and 22/7
And is the one from this season considered good idol
Define “good idols”
So by definition digimon is an isekai
But they get pulled into an alternate world and go on an adventure
I grew up watching digimon in Chinese
Prove me wrong
The true original isekai is Digimon tbh
I would say 90% of _isekai_ do that
^
Getting Miyano to do a jazzy number for the ED is a fucking genius move
In/Spectre’s openings and endings are bangers
But if the anime adapts the early parts it’s gonna be fun
Granted the manga is kinda meh now
Darwin’s Game is pretty good though
My knowledge of idolmaster, aside from the anime, is that they have a lot of doujins about the idols getting ntred
> giant space waifu
Franxx?
Idols whose concerts get raided by monsters that can dust humans on contact <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
You wanna know the best idols?
She’s way more than “abrasive loli who really wants to be an idol” in the novels
Nico in the LL novels and manga is ten times better than Nico
I don’t like anime Nico
Aqours when doing irl stuff had the coattails of the OG to ride off
I liked the OG for the fact they’re really starting from zero, both in the anime and IRL
But Sunshine and Aqours just didn’t have the same spark the OG did
LL was what got me into seiyuu in the first place
But she did and it’s fucking glorious
You never expected Hanazawa Kana to make that voice
I was too hung up on the meme
My bad
Done
||https://youtu.be/IeDG6BVd85g||
LET’S ENJOY KAGAWA LIFE!
Sonoko is meme queen
That’s the difference between protecc and waifu
But I wanna date Togo and do r18 stuff with her
I want to bring her to karaoke and pay her head
Itsuki is sweet
Togo best girl, and it’s not just coz she has the biggest tiddies
The main heroine even fights by fisting like Bikki
Yuuki Yuna is great
Wait, dess, you never watched Yuuki Yuna?
And kiniro mosaic
And gochiusa
If you want fluffier, more SOL style of yuri shows, Yuru Yuri and New Game and solid choices
Bananice
From the perspective of best girl banana
I think
More like a retelling
I’m trash for yuri
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
May I add Hibike Euphonium to that list?
Yuuki Yuna, Starlight Revue and Flip Flappers are solid recs
Pdf
Yes please
My only gripe with reading on dynasty scans is that their reader is trash and loads slowly regardless of internet speed
Imagine being so flat your character description roasts you for it
> slender and generally curveless
I haven’t even read a single page for the story yet and I already feel sorry for adachi based on her character description alone
Togo is a good waifu
Shirabe has the same patrician taste I see
Oh Adachi and Shimamura. Heard of this but never started on it
Please read this

K cool coz I wanna shill a manga
Btw do we only do anime or do we shill manga here too?
K-on made me tear up in the end
It’s so tropey but I watched it coz I didn’t know better
Your usual supernatural seinen/shounen show
My first anime was Kaze no Stigma
I’m glad you didn’t give up on anime with that
Damn Dess
And worse, it’s fucking boring
It was so bad
You don’t know what’s slow with really bad payoffs until you watched the 2004 Fate anime from Deen
But forget that, let’s talk about how much of a crime it is that they retconned IF x Vert after the first game
I intend to
And no I have not
The first as in Mk1 or Rebirth 1?
They came in the period where I didn’t have appetite for SoL
All of those three are on my plan to watch list
Azur Lane coz their amazing gacha rates keep me a slut for their gacha and the fact I can autobattle
FGO coz I’m in too deep to back out now that I hit over 5 years of play
I play FGO and Azur Lane mainly
And back to the topic of yuri in anime, the Neptunia series is great for yuri
I started on XDU earlier today coz of alt universe basa and Chris (mostly chris) but I’m losing steam with it real quick
Well, ||nobody got beheaded, so take that how you will||
Plus the supporting cast also lacks the strong character motivations compared to characters like Sayaka
But Iroha lacks the same charm as Madoka (definitely not because she isn’t voiced by Yuuki Aoi, no)
Magia Record tries very very hard to be Madoka
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Meat shields are better than normal shields coz you can use them as emergency rations
the difference lies in whether the giant entity is sentient and organic  i guess
I count gridman as less giant robot and more ultraman
franxx was good until it completely shit itself
you can't change my mind
not all giant robot anime is good
can't call my homies cute if i don't have any
there's lowkey gay energy here. on brand for symphogear server i guess
she becomes a delinquent by the second half
that's itsuki
no we're not
togo is actually a double agent trying to awaken yuna
the alpha waves are actually plot significant and is the main power source of the vertex
and they have to kill her before she awakens
yuna is actually a sleeper agent who is the host for the king of the vertex
nah krika is lying
and after yuna dies togo goes nuts and tries to set the vertex on the world in revenge
then they kill yuna coz nobody expects the main character to die
Fu's color is even yellow
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
||she doesn't||, sorry dess
you probably shouldn't click
it's interesting to see dess react to yuuki yuna while knowing all the spoilers
his first henshin _into his red form_
in the burning chapel
his henshin in episode 3
i still say her first henshin was a kuuga reference, yeah
The cow is actually the god they’ve been worshipping
The cow is the real evil
Nah it’s obviously the cow
> Togo is ~~evil~~ Homura
FTFY
this is actually a timeloop run by togo to get more power
the 3 spirits togo has is from massacring her old friends who were also heroes
so OD doesn't know what is real and what is fake
there's some points where we insert the truth
she's actually dying
the niboshi she eats are actually drugs to combat her crippling illness
or is it?
the endgame is yuna fighting a burning chapel
oh shit shirabe predicted the ending
time for more "dess reacts to yuuki yuna"?
Karin is second best
~~plus she has big tiddies~~
I’m a sucker for the Yamato Nadeshikos
Togo
In yuyuyu?
Dess will soon find out that the Vertex are piloted by past heroes who found out the government is lying to them and they’re rebelling now
astolfo is astolfo
i mean, even irl there are guys who crossdress coz they like it, not for any gender identity thing
but yeah the phones thing is arguably the biggest plot hole in yuyuyu
like maybe the chat app is a thing normal people have
i guess the henshin magic of the smartphones is in the phones itself?
can't wait for him to get to the part where togo and yuna save the world through the power of aggressively making out
and so marks...day 3? of dess watching yuyuyu
we know that
the taisha are dicks
meaning the taisha are just dicks then
...hell yeah
my bad
oh yeah it was 3
i thought it was 4
wait was that episode 3?
like you see full actual humping
episode 4 of this was straight up hentai though
Twintail anime is a trip
ino-senpai is the best
i feel nobody talks about ino-senpai
ino-senpai though
And no matter how far fetched it got it doesn’t break suspension of disbelief as badly because, well, she did say it was all fiction
Right?
She literally deduces things from fictional scenarios
It explains why the Japanese name is “Kyoukou Suiri”, or “Fictional Deduction”
I actually had an eureka moment when she was talking about “rational fiction”
But I feel like the Steel Lady Nanase case did an introduction to Kotoko’s methods well
For whatever reason they decided the snake god thing, which came later in the series, should be episode two before the Steel Lady Nanase plot
Coz they adapted the anime out of order
Reading the In Spectre manga, it makes sense why episode 2 felt so out of place
so when are we gonna see crim use their dong onscreen?
Sugita voiced a few sentai villains here and there
But then why would they even let it go past approval for a dub production if they were agonizing over whether to put it out?
Which makes it even more confusing as to why they chickened out of it despite picking it up
Exactly
Yeah you would think they have at least the first three episodes on hand to review
I think AK meant that it’s dumb that Funi picked up Reviewers and even released a dub without knowing how r rated it got
I see
Does that mean they just took it down coz they received the uncensored version rather than the censored one?
Yes
Yeah
Chapter 16
It’s from a side chapter after Nanase, unfortunately
I really hope this face makes it into the anime
Yeah they should make a flamethrower Nanase ova to package with the Blurays
Aya you sure it’s not just because she’s an idol with big tits?
Oh yeah he did
Coz that seems _highly_ unlikely unless she drugged him
Tbh the fact kotoko brought up being deflowered makes me wonder if she actually did the deed with Kuro
I need to remember interspecies reviewers exists now
…usually
It does happen, just not in anime that air on national tv
But most minmaxers don’t go “oh shit my weapon is gone. Time to eat this monster alive I guess”
It’s basically how you screw up a DnD campaign in the best way possible
Bofuri is an exercise in absurdity
The closest thing is bofuri, and even that is cute and fluffy
It also helps that she looks like Carol
And it’s great
It shows her relative childishness in comparison to the rest of the characters who are at least in their 20s
Kotoko has a mix of character traits that would be a mess and fall flat on its face without proper execution, but the author does it amazingly
it built up a central mystery and story, failed to address any details about it by the end, and it's final arc in the anime was very messily paced
dimension w was pretty bad tbh
And the best part? Nobody knew who the hell the people they casted were
They did some reality tv docu-series featuring “influencers” from my country
Well it’s Netflix. I honestly have seen them do more bad than good
It’s just fun to me to discuss it
Someone find that clip where Yuna’s VA plays the Yuuki Yuna VN
Dess call her sonoko. Respecc the spacey meme queen
Either now or in a later episode
I think they outright mention it
Sonoko is the actual best though
I find her an overrated waifu, but as an fgo servant she’s great
I love it
Dess is getting mind blown now
Well that price tag isn’t that hot
Oh yeah that’s hot
Fuck we can’t lie to dess about the plot anymore <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Oh shit oh fuck
Oh shit dess be finishing Yuuki Yuna
This also proves Togo’s yandere potential
Togo proves in this episode she’s a cold hardcore badass
Well future education is shit then
Asian education has been much better over the years, but when I was younger in primary school and stuff the support for disabled kids was really not great
Welcome to Asian education
Mainly because that’s the point they stopped making her a satellite character to Fuu
Itsuki was way more interesting after she lost her voice
And I understand what Krika means now
Now I remember what episode 9 is about
I haven’t touched the rest but I also don’t intend to drop it
Magia Record’s first three episodes kinda bored me tbh
How is the phone capturing it so accurately damn
Wait Dess is using speech to text?
You only just scratched the surface of Yuuki Yuna, dess
Oh damn you know
I didn’t watch the movies coz I watched all of s2
Oh right
Movies?
Everything is gonna be a trip
From now to the end of s2
How is Dess’ speech to text transcribing the names so accurately?
Or is it just in comparison to Togo?
Actually Fuu’s boobs aren’t that big, right?
Enjoy that BGM
Oof
Sonoko is _close_ to a god
like i said, togo is hardcore
i thought we were talking about like supernatural magic
you meant that
oh
wait wym togo can use magic
_ahembikkibackstoryahemahem_
flashback eps are fine when they don't retroactively change things
the only time where shounen is not valid is when one claims shounen is the best genre
now now, Dess, liking shounen is valid
just yuri girls punching things
we don't talk about shounen here
if not please watch it
zero did you watch yuuki yuna?
no not really
Togo's backstory comes in in the prequel mainly
taisha magic
yet everyone still speaks japanese
they mention it's a different calendar
they actually mentioned this in the first episode i think
well
ah
why y'all bullying aya
wait what did aya do
an extreme one at that
basically the yuuki yuna world is a theocracy
don't give me that bullshit
either keep the honorific or localise
i hate that "-san" is always translated as "Miss" or "Mister"
the tree can take the phone back i guess
yeah the official subs were terrible
ah
wait do you mean they got s2's plot wrong or s1's plot wrong?
sure it's convoluted but hey, we get more gayness
the second half of s2 is fine imo
the best way to give spoilers: mix it among crazy obviously bullshit "spoilers"
hey, it technically isn't a spoiler if you still got surprised by it
oh yeah hahahaha i remember that
why am i watching Dess livepost about yuuki yuna i should be focusing on class
this is a trip
togo was gay even before she met yuna tbh
wtf
Dess' speech-to-text even censors cursing
ooohhhhh
oh
i thought yuuki yuna was an anime-original?
wait which scene?
KARRRIIIIIIINNNNNN
THIS SCENE IS WHY KARIN IS DRAWN WITH TOGO AS BEST IN MY RANKINGS
DO IT KARIN YOU SWEET BABY
YAAASSSS
fuuuccckkk
is this that scene
wait is this karin
krika should've mixed it into a bunch of lies
oof
i like how Dess' speech-to-text keeps transcribing Fuu as FUU
Dess went silent
Dess you need to tell me what program you use
4?
Sonoko will be here later i think
Gin!
?
KaGAwa lYfE!
Dess is not gonna just watch one movie
the way s2 is structured is why i personally feel that yuyuyu has three seasons
Yuna returned by the power of the gay
_heh_
and she was part of a trio
yeah
I'm actually not surprised that Dess likes Togo so much, given you used Togo's pic for an RP character even before you watched the show
Smol Togo is all the gayness of Big Togo, but with a heaping dose of cuteness and Good Girl™️
Smol Togo > Big Togo
the prequel cast is a trio of Very Good Girls™️
like everyone knows
the prequels are way more overt about the heroes thing
it lowkey triggers me when Dess calls Sonoko "Nogi"
it's _vertex_ Dess
BANZAI!
lol
i can't imagine being in grad school
i'm already dying from being an undergrad
lol
this is gonna be a trip
so Dess is gonna finish the yuyuyu prequels right as i start classes tomorrow morning lol
Make sure you watch the next 2 movies all at once
Bye Dess
No
Gin is like Yuuna ||except she dies||
Togo can do what Togo wants
don't question Togo
Dess is now appreciating how this trio is considered Very Good Girls™️
the gay energy is strong in those girls
presumably Fuu got training offscreen
...great
can't be "red Yuusha" coz otherwise she'd be gunning for Karin
again, bottom energy
Togo's type is "pink-haired tomboyish girls"
Togo probably experienced her gay awakening with Gin tbh
togo has huge bottom energy
Togo definitely has a type
Dess is now appreciating the Very Good Girls™️
Dess, Asia has tiny islands, okay?
i remember someone mentioned the actual population in here earlier
just about the same population as japan?
which is odd
but now from what Dess says most of those are crammed into one movie
yeah watching it as episodes in s2 didn't feel that bad to me
i forgot that most of the second movie is SoL shenanigans
just take it landscape format
oh
also Dess why the hell are your screenshots in portrait
imagine not knowing zuikaku through kancolle
so who knows what else these gods are into
well zeus impregnated someone by becoming a literal golden shower of rain
so satan filmed a porno. got it
> hell gods dick movie
i can't remember
uh
oh yeah
boo
why are you so happy about that
this is that fight
oh no
Oh my
Dess only looks at length
I can’t believe you guys are having an argument about geography because of yuyuyu
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Dess, length isn’t all that matters
My country is 721.5km square!
specifically the prequel movies
yuuki yuna is a hero
well they're way more open about the hero thing here
i vote starlight, coz i haven't watched flip flappers
||taisha was trying to use her to induce yuna's awakening||
they did mention why
Time to up your weeb game aya
Time to burn aya at the stake for not knowing Rem is Carol
Minase Inori is godly
yep
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Rem is also Carol
it's like nearly midnight where he is iirc
yeah
should've made it a google doc so you can edit it whenever
~~upload a redacted version for troll purposes~~
saves you the trouble of dropping a whole giant paragraph
or just make a document to upload here?
The last time I had a miss was with Kotoko from In/Spectre. I thought it was Minase when it was Kitou Akari
Right now I have about 70% accuracy
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Learn to tell which seiyuu is it from the character voice alone
everyone knows the best way to get into fate is through the doujins
so yes plenty of alternative terms to use coz anything related to sexuality and gender pushes the buttons of like half the server
F A B U L O U S
crazy
flashy
I never said it wasn’t
Watch reviewers be the number 1 anime on MAL and normies trying to jump on the bandwagon using MAL for recs start to watch it as a starter anime
I should go screenshot all the enty x belfast scenes to reel whiskey in
Where there’s a specific line for when you tap the ship girl’s tits
Azur Lane’s actual game has a function called “special touch”
There’s also a scene where Belfast grabs Enterprise by the necktie and gets _really_ close to her face
I only keep watching it because of glorious Belfast x Enterprise yuri
Speaking from experience
Even if you like Azur Lane it’s pretty hard to like it
Then there’s Suzu and her raging lust for yuri (I feel you girl)
Sakura-senpai is more than just a plain tsun, Monroe looks like a fluffy onee-san but also has her big dream, etc
I like how most of the characters in the earth studies club is more than just one character trait
Meanwhile I want Ino-senpai to live a happy life making her maps
But did GuP suffer from _everything_ melting off the screen every episode?
everything is a promotion for something nowadays
it doesn't say anything about re-airing the episodes in Bd quality
ping me when you do, krika
wait i knew they were delaying the last two episodes, but re-airing everything is news to me
But I dunno if anyone will even bother doing the subs for the BD given how god awful the story is
They better
If there was an award for least erotic naked scene that’ll win top prize for sure
The body positivity message is dampened by the fact that everyone looks like they’re just melting off their faces
Which they managed to screw up
There’s the bath episode
But then again I’m too lazy to download all the episodes again <:FoCGuShrug:620795213719404574>
Don’t click that Dess
This is where you start to realise ||shinju is also a huge asshole||
oh hey Dess is watching yuuki yuna
spacey as hell but also basically a genius
sonoko is a fun character
"my daughter is an airhead. lemme just pretend to fucking die right now"
oh wait what lol
which is why her parents also let her do whatever
iirc there was something where they started as a 5-year-old her mom collapsed and she was able to convey all of her mom's symptoms and conditions to the paramedic with perfect accuracy
sonoko is a badass
you gotta sacrifice some functionality
better than losing a body part every time you mankai
in my head karin is the chris of yuyuyu
they were all kids of the madoka cast
karin is also sayaka and kyouko's kid
their real mom is mami
fuu and itsuki are actually adopted
ya
yeah what it turns out to be is that yuna is madoka and homura's baby from the power of yuri and magic
because "reeeee why is MC fat and ugly muh self-insert"
for accel world, everything past ||haruyuki becoming chrome disaster|| connects together with no real breaks except maybe a chapter or so
Railgun got delayed due to a lack of manpower from the coronavirus thing, no?
i can't believe it took me a week into watching the show to realise in/spectre is a pun
not to mention she's horny as shit all the time
i still like to think of kotoko as Carol if she never had to deal with the alchemic bullshit
well she can just drop her giant flying turtle on people and turn them into pancakes <:KaguyaSmug:643603380748419085>
but here's my two cents: there was a missed opportunity to name the guild "Pancake"
i see i missed bofuri discussion
but the main plot is completely intact
assassination classroom cut character development arcs for the side characters
Gochiusa s3 hell yeah
https://twitter.com/usagi_anime/status/1240296918493704193?s=21
Bakarina was the one that triggered the wave of otome game isekais in manga and LNs, so depending on the anime's success we may be looking at more of those being adapted to anime
Back when people could do harem anime without needing unnecessary drama (_cough5toubuncough_) or Isekai
his voice for that song is super low compared to his usual range though
fun fact: hamefura's ED is performed by Aoi Shouta aka cagilostro's VA
She comes off the same way as how guys recognise dudes like Chris Hemsworth as being hot
> the president
Lol
Even with the guys Bakarina seems to be completely unmoved for the most part. Probably because she knows they’ll stab her if she hits bad end
But Sophia is probably the only one Bakarina sees as cute/hot to any extent
Mary’s thirst for Bakarina makes me want to see her win though
Bakarina is great coz of the extreme bisexual energy in the show
The fact that the main character is a lovable dumbass mainly
And Inosuke as Sophia was unexpected but fitting
I expected like Kakuma Ai or Kayanon
She sounds too fuwafuwa onee-san for Maria
I agree that Saorin’s voice doesn’t fit Maria
everyone forgets the exclamation mark
Sasuga, Bakarina-sama!
> Just watched the latest ep of *Villainess* ||friendship ended with Bakarina x Maria, Bakarina x Sophia is now OTP||
_Mary cries in the corner_
And I mean _slowly_
Nah based on the parts of the light novel I did read it continues to dick around with SoL a bunch more while slowly interweaving plot
Inou battle actually had a bunch of really interesting plot threads that were slowly unraveling themselves
Too bad the translations I could find for it sorta died halfway through
hayami saori is a goddamn legend
where saorin nailed the entire monologue in one take
oh boy the legendary hatoko rant
I remember smile had some really amazing sakuga moments too
Accel world > SAO > The Isolator based on just the first volume alone. Once you move on to later volumes it gets debatable between SAO and Accel World
It’s weird because if you compare the first volumes of the 3 series Reki has published, the quality is from earliest to latest in terms of when they were written
Okay I know I’m super super late to the discussion and it has passed but I’d like to point out that Reki has mentioned in closing notes before that he wrote Accel World and submitted it for competitions way earlier than SAO, it’s just that SAO won a competition first and when he told the editor he had another novel too they went “aight then let’s publish that too”
Isn’t there a sports anime from this season that’s also girls doing sports while being super gay? I think it’s called tamayomi?
I have KnY and PrinConne in my backlog though
Heh
Watch Arte guys it’s a great show
That’s how I chanced upon Arte this season
And for me I just scan the summaries to do a preliminary filter fo what I’d probably like
I find livechart is easier to view upcoming seasonals
i like how i just needed "gigolette manga" to know you guys are talking about yurika's campus life
it almost felt as if they were rushing through magical girl tropes (evil twin, super strong antagonist-turned-ally, etc) so they can get to doing 3rei
2wei had too much plot for 1 season of anime but too little for 2 seasons
plot sprinkled among fluff
god now that i think about it 2wei was so scattered
yeah okay i concede that
you mean the fact that miyu shared the same birthday with illya?
if they had bundled 2wei herz's fluff episodes into the BDs i think nobody would've been mad
krika that doesn't contradict my point that they spent all of 2wei herz faffing about
i would say 2wei is where it found its footing and 3rei is when it gets _good_
S1 is very run of the mill
that's fair
and it's not horny for lolis so it actually tells a proper story
it's good
please do
sekka no chikai gives you ||the best shirou among all versions of shirou||
and we getting another movie soon iirc
but sekka no chikai was hype
they could have skipped that entirely though
2wei herz was a whole-ass fluff season. literally nothing happened
the anime dumped plot in favour of loli fanservice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-accGqP3eY
if you watch the anime you'll know exactly what scenes you're watching when this music comes on
go read the manga if you're not into lolis making out to sensual music every episode
oh hey prisma illya discussion
if you mean ||making the whole grail war a montage||, it was like that in the manga too
i wanted way more of ||shirou vs angelica||
the movie's fights lacked the bite i expected actually
maybe it was a geah situation where they didn't know if s2 was happening right until the end?
And Kaguya-sama is probably reeling up for the second best arc from the manga
Nice
Isn’t Sakura trick also the show where the “I can’t move, I’m gay!” meme subs came about?
Once you have like 3 factions running around and everyone looking the same shit gets so messy you can’t keep track. And that’s why I dropped the manga
Hell half the time I can’t tell which blond person is Armin based in the closeups
I feel like that can be attributed to the fact that Isayama can’t draw distinct faces
Thing is everything after only made sense coz Isayama wrote it in retroactively. It’s not like shit was foreshadowed
> oh yeah, why is ||Levi alive? Ackerman magic?||
Yes
I blame it on the fact that Isayama can draw a sum total of  one face
I stopped reading AoT after I stopped being able to understand who was on which side
It conveyed the message of ||something something horrors of war, anyone can die||
~~you’ll leak from the other head~~
Remember to keep tissues close by, have earphones in, and lock your room <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Dess is gonna go watch Highschool DxD now I suppose
It’s very standard. If you’ve seen one imouto-focused harem you’ve seen Oreimo imo
the real question is how many have gotten arrested over that?
“CYCLONE!”
“JOOOOKAAAAAA!!!” 
Still the best joke in that anime
Nyarko-san is chock full of references
The way they presented the story out of chronological order probably didn’t help matters. A few plot threads (e.g. ||Dorothy’s dad’s murder||) didn’t get wrapped as neatly as I would like
i started reading katekyo hitman reborn. the first 60 or so chapters are fucking boring but past that it's fucking awesome
not even genjuuro?
i wonder if anyone ever wrote anything about tsubasa talking to DMJii about the way they dissed her in G by singing a zwei wing song...?
i still think it would be funny if elfnein and carol inhabited the same body and carol comes out to be a grumpy genius for the geahs every now and then
steph is a great character. she's smart in all the ways sora and shiro aren't, aka diplomacy and people skills
for me Carol, if only because she has more than one brain cell in her first season
and that's heresy
carol that implies maria isn't sexy
rias will always be top-tier though
> Like u gonna tell me a single sword stab from a player many levels below u can make your health drain faster than your battle heal skill can regen?
that was actually a pretty smart moment discussing the bullshit in rpg damage mechanics lol
like bruv if you fall back on a rape plot _twice_ i completely lose faith in you as a writer
i dislike certain choices with writing in SAO
i've watched both and no, rakudai has a stronger plot
cypher i will fight you on that
that's an amazing one
or chivalry of the failed knight
oh yeah highschool battle harem wise there's rakudai kishi
issei is great. watch DxD
issei still the greatest chad
issei though
trinity seven is fun, but the manga got really bullshit after the timeskip imo
their goal in life became "how can i get ichika to bang me without directly telling him with my own words?"
thing is the harem got so fucking boring
> I barely tolerated S1 and that was cause of Alicia Alcott
you mean cecilia?
like i refused to watch anything from that genre for 1 year and a half
infinite stratos season 2 legitimately scared me off superpower high school harem anime for a while
never read them though
i heard the Gate LNs were JSDF wanking
she seems about 14 or 15 which isn't really loli imo
she's maybe tween age
i never classed rory as loli tbh
ouch aya spitting fire
so an excuse to have a legal loli. great...
also what aya said lol
yeah
the latter i think
askterisk bored me when the loli's introduction arc came in and i gave up
i tried to read a little bit of asterisk but i got so fucking bored
alright maybe i'm biased towards rakudai coz i read the LN and the LN is amazing
> Also why did a single swing from heithcliff kill Asuna? If they're around the same level
heathcliff probably buffed himself with mod powers?
wym
Progressive is pretty great. it actually goes into the interesting part of Aincrad, aka everything the original skipped
The Isolator is trash and i regret buying the first two volumes of it
then you see the shit he writes in The Isolator and wonder what the fuck he's doing
i know. i read progressive and enjoy it, accel world too
thing is, kawahara's writing is infuriating coz you get certain moments that are like "oh this is interesting" then slaps you with some bullshit five pages later
i wasn't referring to phantom bullet
i like anime rory's design a little better, if only because i can't buy that LN rory can fight properly in that full gothic lolita outfit
but i find it interesting that  anime rory seemed to get a major redesign from LN rory
at least not the LN version? that's good to know
as someone who served compulsory military service, i cannot relate lol
remember the days where LNs were published after the web novel version gained popularity?
yeah maybe what i heard was a take based off the original web novel (at least i think that's where Gate originated as)
Half of hamefura episode 11 is bakarina’s harem angsting over why they love her and I’m here for it
the internet will now know why ishigami is truly O U R B O Y
but i'm glad the anime is ending on easily one of the best arcs in the manga
> You're really dumb in this season hahahahahah
you're simply witnessing the glory of bakaguya
Then read the manga
Bokuben did the big-brain move by writing an ending for each girl
and they'd be okay with it
sophia is the first wife. everyone else is a mistress
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-06-20/my-next-life-as-a-villainess-all-routes-lead-to-doom-anime-gets-2nd-season-in-2021/.160871
Hell the fuck yeah
Heavy Object’s anime was great, if a bit too thirsty at times
Yeah but I got irrationally mad about it and stopped watching the show
I tried watching Chihayafuru. The one dude being a dick to the dude with glasses triggered bad memories of primary school especially when ||glasses dude got his glasses stolen||
Yeah I could tell, and from what I saw being discussed about Heavy Object as the anime aired, the ||brainwashing plot|| had nearly everyone calling bullshit
It’s common but felt a little too forced in a show like Heavy Object
Like I get that you want to use || the power of love saves the princess|| plot but _come on_
The ||brainwashing plot|| was terrible though
Oh
Wait is the ||idol who is actually a loli|| canon to the LN?
And add it to the growing list of plan-to-reads I’ll never get to
Damn I need to read Heavy Object’s LN
Yeah Heavy Object was an interesting anime overall, and you can totally tell when it became original content because it stopped going into loving detail of how the Objects are built (which was _the best_)
That was one of the times I didn’t Heavy Object to the anime’s horny
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Frolaytia and Princess ||doing a fucking pole dance out of fucking nowhere|| was great though
Yeah it was great except for when it gets horny where it shouldn’t
Like come on camera stop weakening your plot point
The worst offense was the scene where she was talking about ||how she’s essentially seen as a breeding sow to nobles|| yet the camera very pointedly pans over her tits, ass and thighs
All those scenes of Froleytia briefing them while working out and sweaty though
i'm enjoying healin good precure more than star twinkle just based off the initial three episodes
Too bad Kalafina broke up
