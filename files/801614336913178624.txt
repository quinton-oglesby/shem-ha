<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
good song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oX8Ih9r4oI
it has an endoh version also
the anime is different from the manga right? do you also recommend it?
sad episode
the yeti
the time stop one?
what was the final ending?
da hell
||VOLTEKKA||
but also very good animation in others
i think the anime is also know because sometimes it has very bad animation on some episodes
same VC for kyosuke nambu right?
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBKo2S5QtPo||
yorokobe shonen
sorry about that
ah yes fafnir

oh right it had 2
the OP is so good too
bruh
right
oh
i dont remember that much about sao
what scene?
?
didnt she let a lot of people become zombie plants?
not like i hate her
i just said i dont like her that much cypher
i didnt like the protagonist that much
i watched it
ah yes
majo no tabitai?
oh
i have that one in my list
<@87512939107450880> right i also finished gunbuster and escaflowne
i liked a lot  rakudai
what was the other one?
misaka is my favorite toaru character
ah what a shame
i wish i could read novels but my brain just refuses to work when i read books or the like
oh god
how good are they?
i need to do it but i am lazy
i still havent finished 2nd half of railgun T also
god, toaru season 3 was a mess
wow cypher punching ash
but i cant
i wish my concentration when reading books or something in the internet was good
oh i see, thanks for answering
did sao alredy end?
everyone does
i see
||wanting to spoil myself and also dumb question but does touma alredy have a girlfriend if the novel is alredy that long?||
it will probably in the next movie but it would have been cool if it was blue in the first movie
i didnt like the 1st episode but the 2nd one was good
started watching shokei shoujo

the movie is also very good
eva is also good yeah
i would say gaogaigar, its a good show
she is a ||movie enthusiast||
yeh

<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road
damn, i didnt expect that

well it was a shame the battle didnt last longer
there is bonk emotes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~would be interesting to see~~
except episode 1
very good
well with this shokei shojo is finished
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
||i am happy that at least fake mc wasnt forgotten||
nice
what a shame that the 2 best characters of the show just appeared in the last few episodes
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
bruh
what?
shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road
||bruh what they did to the poor fake mc||
oh
what does bound by blood means?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/759147444679737374.gif?size=44&quality=lossless
wouldnt that be greed?
bandicoot month exists?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/745349110239985774.webp?size=96&quality=lossless
what a shame
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
bananice
that lands the ending?
oh wait the auge?
reminds me of the thunderbolt psycho zaku
i like that the graviton rifles are fired by the sub arms in the shoulders
alongside classic grungust
OG huckebein appeared in V

both have very good designs imo
my favorite huckebein is either mk3 or 30th
even after getting SRX near the endgame
i enjoyed using it in OGs1 a lot
oh yeah right that one
i forgot what was the name of that one
wildrauptier mhhh?
üëå

and the best looking melua unit in your opinion melua?
exbein my beloved
i also liked the z1 version of it
Sousei no Aquarion is very good yeah
the will smith movie?
i love the design of the mech
i kinda did
cant disagree
forgot to turn it off
ah sorry for the ping
*granteed
which one?
i love when that happens
or be sometimes lucky and dodge it even though it just has a 20% chance of dodge
A portable the most known for it
nu gundam and huckebein 30th
in newer ones it stopped being that much important
in older SRW its very important
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
"is it a secondary unit" "yes" "give it 3 attacks"
well i also just played setsuko so thats the main reason
i didnt really use xabungle that much in my playthrough
üòî
gamma gundams only in hyaku shikki attack
i would say z2
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
gaofighgar got it better tho
yeah i also miss that, sometimes
nevermind, sorry
oh wait they arent as bad as i remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuRpslCXIJU
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
melua but in z1 there is nu gundam
it was just a little underwhelming in my opinion
yeah its good
it was a little bit underwhelming
except the finisher unlocked in scenario 57
aquarion guy did a good job for most animations of aquarion of z1
zeta gundam animated by the animator known as arios guy
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/66OsJbfcf0E
no it doesnt
shame they took the face closeup from the waverider crash
VTX did upgrade some its animations
z3 zeta is good zeta
GOD MARS
oh and of course the mech that had 80% of the budget
and Genion
z3 harute i can blame it to low budget maybe?
vangnex best OG of V
yeah
why not keep both?
for the karate chop
shame T hi nu eliminated the swan
z2 and T are peak nu

daimos all the way
they really picked the right guy to voice jua mu
also about MD
also a very good one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2io7v8LNUhg
shame AP didnt use the vocal version of it
üëå
so close, yet so far
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EiIPe11hsU
talking about J reminded me of this
i dont think its bad in GBA
yeah
i thought those were normal missiles
i dont remember seeing them in the battle
wait what?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
well because destiny sells
shame funnel missiles didnt appear in the movie
i like destiny
why not?
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
said the mechanic
"tightly sealed"
right
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
just karate chop
but no
why not add both i question myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScLscxRX_NM
üôè
arc anime music 2021 versions
because its so good
yeah thats why i added 2021 dragon
and its a bad game
is just in 1 game
right new getter
its way better than just having yuusou as the only theme for dragon
oh right
and?
no i meant that its the only unit you get for ryouma

doesnt have DRAGON
shin dragon in 30 only
or that was hyaku shikki?
of course it was going to have impact
well yeah i think it was animated by the getter robo guy
üôè
nu gundam
oh and of course
alongside some 00 units
yeah he animated kyrios and arios in z2
alongside cannard
its annoying that in W that the finisher for the red frame is a secret
you only get to use freedom and justice for the last 10 stages of W
oh i meant just srw
so far cagalli is only voiced in alpha 3
yeah a shame
wasnt that the wife of the director?
ok sorry
yeah
we see how turn X and turn A turned out to be
well it isnt great
big gun?
nevermind that
the only model i have is Nu RG
i need buy a strike freedom gunpla
~~duality of ape~~
üôè
strike freedom my beloved
if you count DD its not that long
well
i am a little dissapointed then
he is probably alredy done with the franchise
not really
i wait for the day TV eva gets back in srw
1.11, 2.22
rebuild movies are also called that
instead of calling it 4.0
3.0 and the 3.0+1.0
oh
shinji appears in shinkalion?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
elaina the evil witch?
i still havent played T so i cant say
its not bad but V is way better
well until the laminate wears off
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
beyond the time
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
eh?
ah what a shame
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
üòî
oh
||what was she again?||
huh i forgot about that
wait really?
there are also the ~~eldritch abominations~~ foreigners
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
I forgor
oh right that i just remember that also
wait what? i dont remember that happening
||i misremembered that part of 3.0 , sorry my bad||
||which is still bad though||
||i thought he just caused the near 3rd impact||
yeah
sadly she doesnt want to see the anime
she liked them
well my mom finished watching the fullmetal alchemist movies
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just wait ok
yet
cypher y know i havent even played the game
a friend said it was worth reading
well, that certainly sounds like a trainwreck
both are good
athrun is
you guys all are wrong neither shinn or kira are the protagonist
forgot about them
right, 00 raiser and qanti specially
what other gundam has big beams?
good manga
but i just wish for FATE to be readapted
OP1 is very good
deen isnt bad
same
you like the strike freedom?
ZAKU
||there was also that one turn A manga which also had an alien||
~~an scp article here~~
üòî
the gamma gundam

maybe OG
a shame possesion mode is only in masoukishin

we lost a legend this day

that pokemon was one of the first ash ever captured in the series
~~bernie hamburger~~
~~war in the pocket~~
10031
