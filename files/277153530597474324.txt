Considering Symphogear's plot, It could definetly be true
the beef stroganoff song is the answer to everything in the world
might just be the season that sucks
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
still waiting for the oggs to appear on the insert songs Wikia
Dess!
Dess doesn't let Hospitals crumble!
basa is on the Passenger seat of the dirt bike judging Bikki on every single thing she does ~~and hoping she crashes so she can jump off all dramatically~~
Even has that music from sonic forces where you are double boosting and there's some sick drifts
"Hibike"

Is Hibiki's final form a bike that she will use in EP 13?
**CONFUSED PUNCHING NOISES**
Bad quality crop but yeah she just wants to p u n c h a g o d
I mean, It was pretty obvious with Miku's "gear" Being a wedding dress

She obviously wants to marry Bikki
But something in there definitely made that bot triggered
I dunno
wowie 

Maybe they should idk have these flairs looked at by real people?
Is Kiri even at the age of consent?
Saw this on twitter, Even though I don't post here often. Here's some stuff you can do to help save the trees.
we fell asleep to RTgame unfortunately

well I did.
one of my online friends came round and we are gonna watch all of senko San in one sitting
I don't know if this helps, But Xbox systems have Anime watching apps. Just I don't know if you even have a Xbox to begin with.
