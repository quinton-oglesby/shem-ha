With every alternative Hairbikki posted I grow stronger.
This also powers me.
YES
I seek it out like a homing missile.
Long hair Hibiki is good, even as a background gag.
Also, this OL Hibiki...

Of course a Hibiki goddess that can multiply Hibikis is too valuable to let go.
All Hibikis and Hibiki-adjacent entities belong to Miku
<:MikuSnap:688429722249855020>
No horny here, just appreciation of culture.
Don't give her any ideas
The only thing better than Hibiki is two Hibikis.
This is the therapy.

Weird thing is I don't, but something about how it looks on Hibiki gets me.
Hair isn't the only thing she's been growing
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Hairbikki is always so good.
Who knows what treasures I'm missing out on.

Carol spits super hot fire.
Also "my songs don't come cheap" good lord what a hot verse.
"I'll forgive love, hate, and your incomplete race" and all the lines about freezing suns and tilting universes with her song.
Her songs pretty much already are diss tracks now that I think about them.

Miku bringing home all the money so Hibiki is free to run around getting cats out of trees all day.
Don't worry, Miku will become Hibiki's sugar mama whatever happens.

A gaggle of Gungnirs
A troupe of Tachibanas
A horde of Hibikis
A bunch of Bikkis!
