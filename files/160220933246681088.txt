And look forward to the day you find a new source of light in your life
I would say... The best thing to do if you can't repair the relationship is to find some sort of way to gain closure with the person or yourself. Just look for a way to move on.

nitro you say
that's true, I've noticed that
for some reason I've met a lot of trans folk on this server
(like i mean for a few years now) ~~i should google this~~
wait was NK always in the UN?
But anyways that's probably just the nature of my job that doesn't lend me to meeting much
Despite being on the Pride committee no transfolk except me has joined so far lol
Ah ya, this server is my first time actually having transfriends

It's a pretty good video essay.
Not sure where to post this, but it's a serious topic so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAFMXrMl23c
I see. sexual compatibility does matter a lot for some people
or is it you wouldn't be able to date a woman with a penis?
seems normal to me
So you find the person attractive if they didn't have their male features?
Americans are more specialized due to their size of forces for sure
Certain trades will be purely one branch (aircraft maintenance techs obviously purely air force, infantry army only, naval trades pure navy)
Yah our military is too small to be really divided
Like you could have a navy logistics officer doing a rucksack March with an army unit lmao
I'm Canadian Army, but more like just Canadian military. We have a weird system where a lot of the support branches are AF, Army, Navy mixed together
Sounds about right

Ahah, humor gets so dark in the field.
Crawling out of a nice sleeping bag to go walk laps around the camp aaahhh
Ah yeah. Did not enjoy waking up for camp security patrol in the winter
Trench filling up with water then freezing into ice is a horrific experience
I tried doing that in our trench but our gear had frost on it so that was out of the question <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Hate being wet in the field
Oh that does not sound fun at all
Felt like we were in the winter episode of Band of Brothers lol
Fucking digging instead of building up
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'll still never forget when that Captain told us we're digging trenches in clay fields in the winter
Blizzards cancelling attacks by OPFOR because people will get lost in the storm lol
Ohh I see. Yeah, times I've been out it's always been a shitshow
Usually because it's some jerk officer trying to get their promotion points during the EX
Ahaha no matter what, going to the field sucks
Hope service is treating ya well
Oh cool!
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Oh, her Majesty's of course. Canada
That's for sure
Korea is close enough if you want the runner up prize lmao
Should get posted to Japan lol
Ahah hope you enjoy your time in the fleet and see the world
Oh living on a submarine requires a special mindset lol
Navy people are special, being stuck on a boat doesn't sound fun
