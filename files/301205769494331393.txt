<@99158582326497280> it's Yuuki Yuuna
precisely
cause no miku to support her
AU Miku moved away before concert which is why hibiki became so edgy after getting her gear


I'm late to the food party but hopping on anyway
When you switch their colors they turn into Nico and Eli

We postin kids?
who needs to run when you can ride missiles amirite?
i think chris being weak is just a gag tbh. those miniguns don't exactly look light. not to mention the racks of missiles
kiri has proven herself to be pretty dang strong. she one-shot chris in g i think. she really shouldn't be struggling
<@!99158582326497280> this one?
i just sorted through 1000 pictures and my head feels like it's gonna explode. only 9000 more to go yay

it's homura and asuka from senran kagura
https://twitter.com/hanaspider9/status/1004697411426529282
Damn suit homura is a look
i got this. i just never had time to sort any for like 4 months. i gotta power through them
i am officially at 20,000 unsorted pictures. *cries*
If we're talking about our favorite fgo servants this picture sums up most of my preferences
indeed it does
my heart just about exploded in my chest
https://twitter.com/wawahahahabike2/status/1180509186829910016
*was fucking nuts
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Bro what what what wat wat wat wat ????  what the fuckKKKKKKK???? 
Nothing like a bit of trauma to get the blood flowing!!!!
i was so overwhelmed with DEATHH
Oh shit i completely forgot about kirika and shirabe kicking ass at the beginning
more like the cornered bat
i can't believe chicken little "the sky is falling" headass predicted symphogear
the blood is definitely inspector man's
they melted those innocent snowmen
im dead
lmao man really said that training isn't beneficial
Maria is me and the tentacle is episode 8
Honestly I hope the final episode makes me cry. Actually I know it will and I'm not prepared at all
Also I literally had a dream two days ago where I watched the last episode and after it finished I cried so hard I woke up. Wild
Yeah. Everything that has a beginning has an end. Still gonna make me sad as hell
https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1167020242138087424
Damn I saw this tweet and got sad as fuck. I can't believe it's almost over
Damn they got demolished. So casually too
oh yeah it's been a while since she's said that

with SSJ
Yeah she evaporated some naval ships
I actually don't mind how abruptly NR got beaten. Not because I don't like them or think they deserve it, but because it makes Shem-ha seem much more threatening.
fuck the laws i'm god
hot take: hibiki was the villain the whole time
antagonist?
Tears of Peacemaker is my favorite because it gave us this
damnit i was just about to say gate of babylon
What about seven swords?
but at least you get some nice music before you die
a vn in vr but there's only the bad end

||Also Fushich≈ç no Flamme was very cool and a nice addition||
||Damn that opening scene was pretty great||
the walls are probably quintuple lined with unbreakium
the miniguns would have perfect against the swarm
chris has seriously only used the revolvers the whole season
that was not what i had in mind for enki's design
highkey thought i was watching the wrong show when the ep started
im dead
lol they really brought petrification into the show
just lopping it off
that was a pretty chad move
next week is going to fuck me up
this has been one hell of ride
oh shit oh fuck oh shit oh fuck oh shit oh fuck
this is really it huh? we're really on the final episode? fuck me
to be fair that was in s1. definitely not her most emotionally perceptive moments
we've been positively nae nae'd
T-12 hours folks
it's starting soon. later all
yeah live
but better than nothing
quality is pretty spotty
https://mov3.co/en/tokyomx/
i am going to be a mess in about 30 minutes
Well this is it. It's been one hell of a ride and an honor to do it with you all. Catch you on the flip side.
||it's def gonna happen. but when is still not known||
||i thought it was funny when they were lined up and miku was taller than all of them because of her giant fucking leg armor||
||i realized that live 2020 is going to have so much crying||
||nothing but love for the staff and production team||
||this is super fucking sweet||
||https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1177983666519035904||
||fr carol sounded mad in that ad||
||they already found the reference lol||
||https://twitter.com/n_music_n_life/status/1177977313817808896||
||carol kinda dead dead now||
||also japanese twitter is freaking out over carol in xdu||
||as soon as ashita e no flugel started to be sung i was like "that's not the line. wait. oh shit."||
||FIS mech||
||tsubasa throwing fire from her hair||
||pretty sure the tune of waikyou shenshoujing played very briefly||
||like 2 new group songs||
||new flugel song||
||fine just copies shem-ha. she's literally just maria||
||well she literally did that in s1 ||
holy shit my timeline is nutty
i took 922 screenshots during that. everything made me want to
ma sole
ma hart
||the show began with a grave and ended with a grave||
||https://twitter.com/1vuIcan/status/1177984109676613632||
||i guess dying makes you less insane||
yeah xv has a tremendously small sample size, there's bound to be skew
truly a song to connect all of our hearts
also we out here trending worldwide on twitter
but we are both back now to cry some more
discord died and so did i
i expected a hug. but as the finishing blow? did not see that coming
ashita e no flugel?
i want to know what the hell happens to world after this? does it just become a utopia? do all war and conflict cease?
we were getting hibimiku kiss since s1 lol
lily you must be very happy
with the gay
grazer? are we cows?
hugs can be attacks. that's called wrestling
gonna be honest don't trust all of us to do that

we already have 3 iirc
makes sense they would do the same
pretty sure there was a set for each season
i feel like there's gonna be anniversary lives
so long as you keep it alive it symphogear is never truly dead
believe in the song of your heart
it ain't dead yet
emi the hibimiku champion. bless up
well except maybe the beyblade dmjii combo
no one's piloting anything
not really at all
jp twitter has been banging for hours. it took 7 hours for it to stop trending
which is not much tbh
it looks like symphogear but the story feels like madoka from what i remember
"Symphogear but it's just DESS"
the only thing i would find issue with is fantasy. i fail to really see how it applies
or technological girl
it's like scientific girl
well it's almost 4 am and i seriously have to go to sleep. a new tomorrow awaits in a post-symphogear world. later all
just woke. 1 day without symphogear. i am suffer
that's elfnein
who's a rwby character who's always tripping?
maria is jaune because useless
the intro to the extended version of futurism is honestly my favorite piece of music from symphogear. it just hits something different for me, especially during the live
welcome to the club
<@!99695384296701952> i figured as much. haven't touched a vinyl in quite some time
if you check each character album it's the second song
i don't think it's a literal side-b. it's just the name for the second songs generally not played in the show
Nice. i'm sure you enjoyed the kanade appearance
yo <@!246146781832806401> you finished xv!?
i can imagine fine and adam fighting each other. on one hand, adam was like fuck god, and on the other fine was like "fuck god"
well in terms of being an adaptor she wasn't anything special. she just had sheer force of will and anger
she was like reverse kanade
the only one that was any good at being an adaptor died
America just said fuck them kids
I think it also may have had to do with the fact that they were still a huge political secret. Considering the fact that they had just killed one of their operatives i understand why they may have been hesitant to look for another one
like how crackheads get superpowers with the side effect of being on crack
"as a cost of power"
probably the fictional drug trope of "puts lots of strain on the body"
i don't remember them ever saying linker. it may have been in the keywords but i'm not sure
drugs
model-k was not very good linker. model-k for kills you
when tsubasa activates anh
in the flashback when fine first awakens
If you're seeing this in 2040 there's this really sweet group called Zwei Wing. You should check them out, maybe go to a concert or something.
ty
i figured it was archived
not exactly an authority in the matter
i think it may be closed or archived. i'm not sure
oh right this the last day this room is open
whoops
oh duh i completely forgot their trio songs
probably better to say (maria or chris) and dmjii
or chris and dmjii
i meant maria and dmjii
sorry bad wording
interesting
also no duets between maria or chris and dmjii
it's a damn shame hibiki never got a duet with anyone besides kirika
Farewell all. This has been a hell of a ride. Thank you to everyone for being here together. Bye-bye XV discussion
Êà¶Âß´Áµ∂Âî±„Ç∑„É≥„Éï„Ç©„ÇÆ„Ç¢
i see
wait did she speak?
what are you gay?
if he cares so much to complain about fanfic he needs to reevaluate himself
just ignore that guy
that's so silly
he's complaining about a fanfic
i'm a chris fanboy and it seemed fine to me
both arguments are compelling
live for the now
treasure this moment
whaaa???
yeah they're really gay
Life's all about changes and development, we can't be stuck in the past, constantly thinking about what was
that's what it was. i knew there was something that made it distinctly not ganguro but i couldn't remember
yeah the love lab scene was pretty much blackface
well shit. was it someone's art or what?
if it was an actual scene from anime it was probably ganguro not blackface. i saw a tweet about love lab's ganguro scene so it might be something like that
not disturbing at all
yummy
love me some vitality
but to be fair there some very odd pokemon themselves that deal with stuff like abduction
i haven't played pokemon in a while so i'm not aware of such issues in the games
i see
wow what's this pokemon! oh it's possessed by dead kids! great!
pokemon could be the same
but i mean all types of folklore could have stories for animals
nvm found it
holy shit which video is that
i feel like this is honestly the first time she's hearing the information too and she's trying to comprehend it
we're not children
she talks so slow holy shit
don't forget tes mobile
only gears
there is no more war.
X Com: GoW
also mobile gears of war
still would've been nice
wtf kinda trailer was that we didn't even see them
shonen jump game?
what is this conference
this guy lmao
i guess enough people to warrant them making bo4
right now it's tlou 2
there needs to be a button that just makes you say "pizza time" and nothing else
mr. negative
whoa wall climbing and running look really seamless
wow all these classic spiderman villains look very good
best incarnation of spiderman ever
spiderman
mads mikkelson? i'm down
also what is that umbrella?
it really is the WALKING dead
and has to do all the work
he's the last surviving member of the usps
he's walking a lot
https://twitter.com/NakeyJakey/status/1006347933095260161
oh hey it's that guy from the walking dead
https://twitter.com/dogrunes_/status/1006348470364528645
