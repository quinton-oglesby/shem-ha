Yes
It's interesting.

Falling Punch!
Sweet, emergency food's here! I'm starving.
Alright who's cutting onions?
Maybe like too much in your face about it?
I would say he might be taking that a little too far... But it does go over the top a little from what I've seen...
It's definitely the fact that the people who are supposed to keep him in check are supporting him instead.
So that's why Martial Law is trending...
The popup announcement Discord just made.
So is it too early to say who's going to win yet?
I'm worried worse will happen
^^^
True
True
I just know I'm gonna hate going on Twitter no matter what side wins.
Just not enough to lose dramatically
I still expect Trump to win
But instead of waking up, going to sleep with Trump having won, is what I expected
^^^
I did not expect it to be this close
^^^
At least 2-3 days
I really wish they wouldn't do that.
Ah.
So they just cut out the ZZ series?
Do they make Zeta and ZZ hard to understand?
That is true
Don't know what the artstyle's like
I think there's like a 8 episode remake version of the 0079 series though
The art styles were different back then.
It's old style anime.
Worth the 43 episodes
I watched 0079 and enjoyed it
It's actually pretty good
I never knew they favored Gundam Seed
Oh yeah, 0083
I see
And the other series?
Like they trying to get rid of the others
True Gundam Musou then.
Wait there's a Gundam Musou 4?
I mean I'm glad to see Gundam 00 and Unicorn included but still.
The third one honestly lost me
It got me into Gundam in the first place
I miss playing Gundam Musou 2 honestly
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958> *confused dess*
Yeah
I liked ZZ
Oof

Anime - Cross Ange: Rondo of Angel and Dragon (I loved this anime)
Like, take the Knightmares from Code Geass. Those are mecha, but not Gundams.
Gundam is a specific part of the mecha genre
Mecha is the overall term for robots in anime
If we're talking about anime dubs I recommend Overlord's

I love when an anime's OP can 1-Up the previous one each season.
