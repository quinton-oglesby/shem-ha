<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
That's three
I did like Carol though
I wasn't a huge fan of the autoscorers tbh

Goals tbh
Nice
Shame your mom is being shitty about gender but from the sounds of it it's not something you'll have to deal with for much longer
Congrats on some sort of progress with them
Ah
?
kinda helps drown out the more depressing thoughts
when I don't have energy to do things I just watch stuff on YouTube for white noise
Oof, relatable
just try to occupy yourself with things you enjoy
and I know what it's like to feel like you got dealt a shitty hand, but dwelling on it too much just makes things worse
Yeah, sleep can definitely help with those bad moods
Congrats
oops
Oh, then I'M the one who's slow on the uptake
explains all the soy products :^)))
But I like this new take on it
Oh the GNC store is something else entirely lmao
the bit about wanting to take lessons with your parents
My bad
sorry, should've been more clear
Yeah
Gender non-conforming
The first is more gnc than anything
yeah
I was curious why you'd want to be seen as a new skater
That answers my question
Same tbh
Lmao
"if you had a button you could press to become the opposite sex, and people have always known you as that sex, would you do it"
Or the good old button test
Like, the body you'd want to have, or how you want people to refer to you
And yeah, it's less about how you act than how you feel
Me @ 17: "I'm trans but I don't really have dysphoria"

Me now: "yes I do lmao"
So 17
But I figured it out about a year ago
Took four or five years to figure it out
kind of the other way for me
gender expression is a different story, though
I feel like gender isn't something you decide to change, even if you're genderfluid
I wish I had a choice tbh
But that's probably just because that's the only experience I have
Because it's harder to call them out on being shitty
I feel like it's almost worse when parents claim to be supportive but aren't
Oof
such is life
Parents are wack
They won't even use it when we're alone together, and don't want me to tell my brothers at all
They only use Alice when we're actually meeting with the gender therapist
wish I was out enough my parents would even do that
"we're good accepting parents see?"
Can't blame you for that tbh
because same :^)
did someone say desire to redo life
yeah, I am still kind of curious
Fair enough
yeah
Socks are comfy
painful, but I wanna do it someday
waxing sounds like a good idea
Or at least, not exclusively
sub/Dom isn't really a BDSM thing
apparently it's not uncommon for trans people to be asexual
ðŸ¥š
>wants to be a girl but isn't trans
Yeah
haha pickles am I right :^)
lmao
Lmao
Big boss
Boss is good
Yellow Alice
Honestly though
lmao
Wait this is confusing
Not you, Alice
I figured you were a trans girl tbh
Ah, alright
who's nonbinary?
2 I think
Sleep well ðŸ‘‹
Basically just a guide on how to live your life as a good person
I always thought that's what religion *should* be
God or not, being a dick to each other is probably not the way to go
Sorry, Boss
What Alice said tbh
"but not the gays, right?"
Love thy neighbor, said Jesus
Your family is pretty religious, then?
Oof
Yeah, that's who I thought of when people said Boss
Alice the Red
Sure
smolice
And all it took was occasional compliments
Yeah <@166497592136564736>
The compliment thing
Same ibu
Too much stress
Like getting bi imposter syndrome for saying I'm bi but not finding most guys attractive
But I mean more in a personal sense
Yeah, it does help
Putting labels on sexuality is kinda pointless imo
But I'm dating a guy so <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I'm pretty gay tbh
oof
wonderful
I'm just saying maybe leave a few more copies in various places before leaving
oh no I wasn't suggesting anything like that
just leaving it on your bed seems a bit boring
lmfao
Good luck packing, Kriisa
who cares what she thinks
tbh I'm sure your mom is just shitting on it because she's bitter
I hope things work out for you
Your boss is amazing
Seconded
definitely not arguments coming from people with the best interests of trans people at heart
Apparently my parents have been citing similar things
same, I just looked it up
Though, maybe wait till you're out of the house
That's an awful thing for her to say after straight up denying your gender
forget trans friends, send it to anyone you think is even vaguely supportive of you
Seconding what the other Alice said that's super messed up
"insulting transgender people"
wtf
I guess the post offices have closed already, then
I'm glad to hear you'll be getting out of there soon
oof same
your mom seems like the kind of person who'd say anything to make you feel bad so her evaluation of your voice means nothing
yep
haven't heard it but same
^
no problem <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
you just need to fill out the paperwork and have your DL
yeah, you can get both
https://www.dmv.org/replace-passport.php
https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/
nice
I see no reason to not take pleasure in pissing them off in little ways
tbh it's not really a bridge she's intent on keeping intact
YES
might be hard but it'll be tough to get down
ooh can you leave it on the ceiling?
"oh god what if someone sees this when they visit"
might give them a good scare
I'm wondering if you could maybe leave a few where guests might be inclined to look more than your parents?
it'll be a thorn in their side for a while
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I agree, see if you can get your dad to do it
Not surprising
As in, I'm pretty sure there's an actual law against keeping someone somewhere unwillingly
That seems illegal
Shame your mom responded how she did but I guess it's better than trying to force you back
Let me know if I can do anything to help
Glad you've made it out Kriisa
Just find a few that are important to you
You don't many reasons to go on tbh
Honestly same
sounds like you're handling it well enough, then
lmao
it's seriously frustrating because I hate myself for a *lot* of things, but I can't bring myself to fix them, for some reason
good to know I'm not alone
ayy
Does anyone else have times where they feel like they're self aware enough to know what's wrong with them, but not nearly motivated enough to act on that?
but if nothing else, you can always come here for support
It's always been a suspect phrase for me too
yeah, it's not a guarantee
And remembering that what you want is more important than what others want, so long as you're safe
That said, I really do think that it comes down to what you want in the end
And I hate sharing empty feeling platitudes but it's kind of hard to avoid them, sometimes
Yeah, it's definitely kinda cliche
While you're still closeted to yourself it's a lot easier to repress
Especially once you actually come to terms with being trans
And yeah, living a lie kinda gets to you
but tbh to me I'd much rather be happy in my body and people don't like me than not happy in my body and... people still don't like me
If you live in a liberal area it'll be a little better
Yeah, that's always a concern
At least you can live from here on out as yourself, right?
I don't wanna give empty platitudes or anything but I agree with what rakhi said about better late than never
I guess all I can say is that it's better to take control of the time you have left
yeah, I see why you'd feel it's quite late
Ah
Not to pry, but how old are you, lat?
And I remember being excited because my parents said they'd support me
I came out six months and two days ago
????
As if not being on hormones isn't the source of that in the first place
My parents keep telling me to sort out other parts of my life so I'm less stressed when making a decision about hormones
Yeah same rakhi
It's a Problemâ„¢
My girl body looks like a gross hairy dad body
mood
And I wanna make it look like less of a guy body
My girl body looks too much like a guy body, then
^
But the mirror says otherwise
I wish I could believe that tbh
I'm still waiting on my parents to stop saying NO WHAT IF YOU REGRET IT WE CANT LET YOU MAKE THIS DECISION
I'd rather be an emotional mess in a girls body than an emotional mess in a guy's body any day of the week
same
but estrogen's definitely gonna make it worse
tbh I was a lot more bottled up until this past year
It's a good approach
makes sense, I guess
can't be working that hard if I'm not working
or maybe I am, considering I'm not actually improving
not having an easy time of improving
kinda trying to find it in myself to force myself to do things but I'm kinda just drained emotionally
but if it means anything, I'm proud of you for being able to move forward despite that
life sucks <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I can imagine
especially the mods who made this server such a friendly place to be in the first place
y'all are doing a great job tbh
But imo there's no better starting point than being aware of yourself and your subconscious
And it'll take time to build the confidence to not be torn down by those doubts
You're already a better person than them
But if you know they're wrong
that's fine
They're just a reflection of how you were raised
Your demons don't reflect poorly on the person you are
demons are demons, but they're not *you*
Nobody is an island
Anyway, don't feel bad about needing help or even wanting thanks once in a while
Ah
Apologies
Ah
Especially if it's not something you're used to
There's no shame in wanting positive reinforcement
Because from college on you're gonna be your own person
Getting away from family might be a good change of pace
alright
But any plans to go off for college?
I'm bad at numbers <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I wanna say 17?
You're uh
Like, the entire neighborhood?
Ah
I'm curious, where do you live?
And even if your situation sucks right now you're gonna be able to use that empathy to make a better life for yourself someday
Because empathy is what makes you a good person
But too much empathy is a million times better than not enough
It hurts
But that's a good trait, imo
yeah
I have two younger brothers and I've been in similar situations
I can kind of relate to how you feel, rakhi
Fair enough o7

I'm pretty sure his issue is just that he'll have to go out of his way to find lewds of her instead of being able to see his one true love every Saturday
Your waifu isn't gonna be dead
Just buy a body pillow dude
You can be doing well and still get something out of therapy
okay but the natural outcome of The Canon Ship is a sexual relationship in 90% of cases
because kazuma kind of is a self insert
regardless of "Historical Accuracy" isn't it kind of creepy to justify porn where a self insert character is with a minor
you're drawing porn of their underage bodies
you aren't drawing porn of their personalities
age aside, they look like children
yeah LO is 6 at best tbh
you don't go "hnnnng god I love how mature she is" while you're beating it
the point is people are getting aroused from the body of a child
yes???
it quite literally is wrong to draw porn of a character that looks 13
yes
y
does anyone have a link to the FBI hotline because that's a fucking yikes from me
wh
the character being discussed does act kind of childish at times
child porn is about consent but it's inevitable that the appearance influences attraction
I did read the whole thing

don't wanna misunderstand your intent
aight my bad maybe I took the least generous interpretation
why does it have to be an underage girl
but my point is like
ooh that's a good take aria accuse *me* of objectifying women
then you don't need the porn
pick the 30 year old who looks like an adult and is in antiskill if you wanna masturbate???
you're not getting off to her because you admire her dedication to the job
she looks like a child though how difficult is that to understand
so a kid with "an adult's personality" isn't exactly "technically legal" as creepy as it is to have to rely on technicalities to masturbate to children in the first place
a kid acting like an adult wouldn't be legal either
a child's body???
it's
change the fact that
that doesn't
it was fun but I never renewed my subscription
I'm kinda tempted to get back into the game tbh
oof nice kirika cosplay
NANI?
I REFLECT YOUR REFLECTION
I REFLECT BULLETS
I'd play an inferno cop game
ðŸ˜…
I'm a pretty big trigger fangirl so I have a hard time faulting them for stuff like that
not wrong tbh
lmao
franxx apparently just went downhill because they tried to introduce too much?
but the reception isn't great, so I never checked it out
it does seem interesting
and I was actually considering rewatching it again
I actually *did* rewatch it about a year ago
that's fair
between kiznaiver and darling in the franxx I think going back to KLK is a good move for them
I think part of the issue is that their recent anime stuff hasn't been received quite as well
implying klk wasn't successful
and then with all the pushing for the game they decided, ah hell, why not
I think part of it is just that trigger was occupied with other things
yeah, I can see what you mean
it was airing back in 2012
coming up on six
5 years, I think
as in, late?
wrong?
https://youtu.be/z-V6_7ZND_s
I don't think this has been shared yet so I'll just leave it here because I can't contain my hype
Ah
I guess you won't be able to get a proper PC until you get your own place?
oof, that sucks
Maybe I'm the only one here who cares but monster Hunter world is coming out on PC soon and I'm hyped
Apparently it's been fixed already
*help*
I've put in 10 hours today
mhw is quite fun
