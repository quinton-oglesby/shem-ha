Or maybe Carol is slowly taking over her.
Primal Maria.

Absolute Chaos.
A petition was made 2 weeks ago, currently it is at around 870,000 signatures, making it one of the largest.
We are on our 3rd Prime minister in 3 months and still no general election. Despite the public calling for one.
I loved this country. Ever since brexit, it's all gone down the drain.
Tell me about it ðŸ˜’.
I'm scared that we are going down towards the F-word territory.
I've considered moving to New Zealand. At least they don't want to strip environmental protections, workers rights and trans rights.
You're Lucky. I have to live in this dumpster fire.
Yes. She is one of the Worst ones out there. Two weeks ago, she dreamed of sending refugees on a one way trip to Rwanda. Also, she dreams of scrapping the EHCR in Britain which was made to prevent scenarios like Nazi Germany from happening again because she thinks it is an EU invention.
She also resigned a week ago because she was considered a security threat.
Oh for god sake.

Knew that this would be back when Raab was reinstated as deputy PM.
Oh for god sake.

Do you think that Musk may have done this deliberately?
Oh well, time to go occupy Mastodon.
Interesting ðŸ¤” .
Which I think has been inevitably a blow for those on the left in my opinion, as with me, alot of the horrendous stuff that has been caused by the tories over the last 12 years was exposed on twitter. Now it will be a lot more difficult to know what the Right is doing now thanks to this.
I mean, I agree with you. He would be the stupidest man if the UK conservative party didn't exist. But Musk and the American
Far-right did't like how twitter threatened their theocracy, hence why he bought it.
I forgot but he also lied to the company about Disney Plus saying it was making more profit than it was.
Even creators at Disney are glad he is back and Chapek is gone:

At least Iger gives animation the respect it is due.
Good riddance.
Well seeing as the Chapek treated animation like crap, supported the don't say gay bill, exhausted the MCU and is responsible for cancelling shows like the Owl House despite the show being highly profitable in Disney's eyes. I think this is good.

Labour is planning to abolish the house of lords as one of their manifestos. Let's see if they actually do it, though I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't.

This has happened before and it will probably happen again.
Trust me. This is how roaring the 20s were back then and how roaring they are now. Difference is that social media wasn't invented back then to show it.
They can't even defend themselves anymore when they are exposed either.

Nope. They are not even putting effort into misinformation anymore. It's kinda sad.
And just when I thought the Tory party couldn't get even lower, I was proven wrong.

Oh thank god.

The conservatives knew that they would not win, so they changed the rules. Though after this winter, they may not even have the 60+.

Appeasing the bigots in this country is only going to destroy it further.
My Professor said if it was any other country, people would have already taken to the streets in masses for these things.
~~Oh what joy!!~~
Having a Home Secretary tell a holocaust survivor to stuff it after she asks for her to apologise for using hostile language towards refugees is definitely the worst.
What's worse is that this isn't even the most deplorable thing that has been said this year.
The response was one of the most vile things I have ever heard.
Absolutely Heartbreaking.
Tell me about it.
I would just like one day where I don't have to worry about the state the country is going in.

However there is still bad news.
Good news, the Public Order Bill aka. the Anti Protest Bill has been defeated by the House of Lords.

Or Jeremy Corbyn.
I think we all do. I prefer Angela Rayner.
Strange times we live In.
Who knew that unelected officials are safeguarding democracy more than the people who are elected to do so.

My Lecturer said if the UK was any other country, people would taken to the streets already. Looks like he was right.

That rot is called neoliberalism.
I think it started a lot earlier in 1979. The rot we are seeing today originally came from Thatcher's government.
Tell me about it.
