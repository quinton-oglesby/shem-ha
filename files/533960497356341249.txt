Aye, she's probably the character who got me into "hot girls who could blow people up but just punches them instead", a favourite archetype of mine now <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>

I'd spend hours just driving around the city on Tsubasa's bike kicking stray Noise ass
a Symphogear game in the vein of the Spiderman games would be pretty awesome, too
I'm still keeping an eye on that fighting game that one person was making, too
would need a next-gen console or flagship computer just to handle all the EXPLOSIONS
playing as Chris would be the best thing ever
I'd play the hell out of a Symphogear musou game
I'm just wondering now when Symphogear is gonna break into the movie scene, it almost feels inevitable now
true enough
Including all the spin-offs makes following the Nanoha series a headache, whereas Symphogear has no animated spin-offs but it's still a headache for newcomers because of the naming scheme that only one person could have come up with <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I came into this series because of Nana Mizuki and being a long time Nanoha fan, and honestly besides A's and a few of the movies, Symphogear is just a lot more fun to watch while being much the same mecha/mahou shoujo gig
That's what it feels like tbh
Symphogear is kinda like a lot of different mythologies smashed together. You've got the hero who could split the planet in half on a bad day or punch the moon back into orbit on a good day; Literally all anyone has to do is sincerely ask for help and the problems would be solved but who sits down and TALKS in the middle of WAR, COMBAT, SLAUGHTER because that's clearly much more sensible, yes
Hibiki punched a several-hundred-foot hole in a mountain, I dunno why Fudou is worried about "muh sovereignty"
I think they're trying to emphasize the political tension between countries this season. We still don't know exactly WHAT America has that makes its presence in the occult scene such a threat to Japan (or the world), but it's probably just Fudou gone either full NIPPON DAMASHII or outright rogue at this point
Fudou feels like he's going more for mind-control restraints over Tsubasa; Maybe we'll see a brief side-switch where someone has to beat Tsubasa to her senses? If that happens, Fudou is fu-ducked
The Stand arrow choses who's worthy to wield it, but isn't the bracelet more like, only those cleansed of the Original Sin can wield it? Unless I've overlooked something in the settings materials
besides that, I just lurk around chatrooms like these and join in conversations sometimes. any amount of socialization helps in my case, but it's really not that simple.
made very few friends in that time and already grown distant from most of them, but there are still one or two people I'll keep in touch with once every couple weeks
I certainly don't have any friends from high school that I still keep in touch with. heck, I dropped out of high school almost 10 years ago.
I try to just be casual yet respectful with people, but I was raised in a pretty unusual environment, so my words can be a bit rough sometimes
I love to travel and I enjoy talking about my hobbies, but maintaining a friendship doesn't come easily to me
it's sort of an ongoing effort, admittedly
not too long ago - about a year or so ago - I abandoned all communities that I was part of and completely vanished off the radar shortly before moving house, so I was left in a state where I knew nobody, and nobody knew me.
It's rough, and I had to actively work to change my personality to be more outgoing in order to make friends again.
I have high hopes, anyway
apparently the combo mechanics and stuff are gonna be simplified and the system itself made a bit more intuitive, from what I've heard
May's new design is adorable and I've always enjoyed playing as her, so I'll probably main her in the new game
I'm trying to get into GG lately as well
who do you main, out of curiosity? if it's Ukyo know that you are my bane
it's like no other fighting game I've ever played, at least
I'm an absolute beginner at fighting games but I prefer games like Samsho where I can focus on the game without having to memorize a dozen combo routes
oh awesome
wasn't someone doing a fanmade Symphogear fighting game?
I love Samurai Shodown as well, but I don't have the new one yet
I'm garbage at them, but UNIST and Melty are my main haunts
what fighting games you play?
I'm not very active in a lot of the servers I've joined, but I do enjoy hanging out in them every now and then
I've just been lurking in this one only looking in every now and then, but the folks around here seem nice and chill and I respect that
