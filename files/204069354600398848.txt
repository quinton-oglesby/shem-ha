Only just saw the exchange over there. I don't have good access to discord in the workday. Normally I wouldn't comment on these things outside our server, but since I've been pinged here about it, I'll say this: I've issued a warning to Riya. A ban will happen if it continues. Victim blaming and condoning rape and such matters are not acceptable. That is all.
