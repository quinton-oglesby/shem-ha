Helena Thompson (our version of Hibiki), instead of being an only child has a brother Maurice (taking the role of Miku, as Helena's support and cheerleader). 
Goes to the ~~Zwei Wing~~ Concert, Golems (our version of noise) attack, shit goes crazy, Kathi Anderson (guess) and Yoko (guess) transform into Valkyries and start fighting the noise
Yadda yadda, story stats the same for rest of the concert fight.
S1 keeps a lot of beats from Symphogear s1 and G, but even then we got a lot of different shit going on I'll get to; afterwards, we got two completely original seasons in the bin so far, and working in ideas on s5
Here's what we worked out so far though
I should have prepared a doc for this, but Amiya brought it up so...
It started out trying to think up an Americanized remake of the series, as it would be the closest thing to the show getting a dub.
But as things came along, threw in a bunch of ideas and it's only vaguely like Symphogear, where really only the base characters are the same...but even then not really. Like, there are obvious characters taking the places of others but they have radically different lives and backstories and shit
Yeah
the characters dont
Like...if this system (like so many magic/gear systems I see) is only able to work on women, what does it count?
That last thing was just a recent shower thought
yeah
yee
in truth it started when talking about a potential dub of the series, but that got shut down due to rights issue,
So thought change to, why not a complete remake, keeping the core elements in an American setting
Not quite but yeah
there's more of course, but there's a lot of stuff we're still working out in terms of plot progression for s1 and 2
she gets taken in by (Insert replacement name for SONG/Sec2), since Maurice was there, he's let in on everything as well. 
Anyways, after that, Helena heads to the washroom, she looks in the mirror...and sees Kathi staring back at her
Turns out, Kathi's soul still remains in the armor fragments embedded in Helena; she hasn't shown up until now as the armor had not been activated. She soon becomes a sort of mentor for Helena.
Helena recovers, but gets harassed because of conspiracy bullshit spread by some right wing talking head blaming deaths on the survivors of the incident
~~instead of being a shit and abandoning his family~~, Helena's dad just moves the family out to another part of the country. Shit dies down, and eventually, Helena and Maurice head off to college. 
One day, walking home from classes, the two run into Golems, they make a run for it, in a moment of desperation, the shards in Helena's chest activate, revealing her Valkyrie armour
so...fucking close to finishing this chapter...so fucking close
wish I knew a good place to post it, not sure if ao3 is a good place for original work
If anyone is interested in beta reading my stuff, feel free
So, I was pondering random ideas for a RWBY fic, came up with one where Ruby teams up with I-can't-believe-its-not-Guts. Then I decided to make it its own story, like I tried with the Jasata project, but this time, since the story is gonna be way shorter, I may be ablle to get it off the ground
Would love feedback on this, if anyone is up for reading it

> I swear XDU could release a full FMV of these two's sex tape and y'all still be like "WELL UNLESS THEY SPECIFICALLY SAY"
Hibiki would have reached climax 3 times after Miku finger blasted her to Mars and she'd STILL not get the hint
wtf is up with the Shadow memes?
seen so much of it did not check if more than one did it
Just an artist's thing?
XDU event?
why do I keep seeing the gears as Furry dragons? Some lore behind that?

...
Bikki the edgehog
now she's Shadowbiki
And I was like "NOOOO"
I was like
"Oh hey we get to see another alternate bikki. I wonder when we're gonna see another Edgebikki story"
And then I found out it was Edgebikki
And then I found out what happened
> but its a good ride tho for us viewers
<@!263534352422404096> <:HibikiAngry:688429716096548892>
Gonna tell all my friends this was Zwei Wing
A part of me is kind of mad that they killed edgebikki's miku; like, aside from the whole trope thing; I really feel like Edgebikki deserved a happy ending. Like, they didn't have to bring her back like this. They didn't do this to alt Kanade when they went back to her world. No one died (or at least none of her friends and loved ones) in her sequel event. So why did they fridge Edgebikki's Miku?
> like iirc the tsubasa there is pretty okay right? Although they don't have chris? :ThOwOnk:
<@!161155855524298752> Yeah
As I was rewatching the Kanade event story stuff on YouTube, I was thinking to myself "If Fine isn't possessing Ryuko, what the fuck is she doing? Also, if thats the case, is Chris still a child slave or is she like dead rn?"
I'd lvoe one of the storylines to just be theem going over to Kanadeverse and trying to figure out what happened with that universes Chris, and maybe even Hibiki and Miku (Hibiki presummably died at the Concert, but I don't think they say it explicitly or anything)
I'd love to see the story for Edgebikki 2...too bad localization isn't a thing anymore
Like
Empire Strikes Back didn't bring back the Death Star, or kill off any major characters (though some came out with some scars)
But often those leave a REAL bad taste in people's mouth
I mean, sometimes good
> Those are called sequels.
<@!149704282793443328> *terrible* sequels
Is that Yuki Yuna?
Elfeight
Thats an incredible pair of emotes
its confused
Basically, Broken Biki
Its just canon...
Maybe...
especially after GX
Its hard to differentiate
Hibiki to Chris s1 e7 (or 8 I forget): "...and I've never had a boyfriend!"
I think thats the only suggestion of straightness from any of the big 6
I love how none of the the girls seem to be at all actively straight
Step mom but yeah
Yeah
HER MOM ISN"T MENTIONED AT ALL
THATS THE ONE THING THAT DUMBFOUNDS ME
> Which makes me wonder where the hell was her mom? Did she played dead and won?
<@!623294686404149269> YEAH
> Sure, I,traumatized my daughter by mistreating her but it was for her own good
<@!623294686404149269> Honestly, it was the least stupid of the Doll of the Week character arcs
> Basa's uh- dad isn't that bad
<@!161155855524298752> I understand why they never touched that pustule since it was brought up 
But damn
Really hate how they have her just casually kill 10x as many people as Fine did at the previous concert massacre
you know what I find amazing?
It took us 5 whole seasons until we got a truly unlovable villain.
He's the Hitler to Milaarc's Himmler
Him too
I blame Milaarc
oh yeah!
> Other Gears/Miku is honestly probably a fun thing to look at
<@!161155855524298752> TBH, I only think Miku/Chris works. Considering that Miku was the one that basically saved Chris and became her first positive relationship in her life since the death of her parents
Honestly, its sadder than everything that happens to EdgeBiki
yes
Honestly if this fic has done anything its fueled my interest in MikuChris...sorry Biki
My god the pain
The one where they're children is the saddest one because that nearly happened if it weren't for Fine
thank you, kind stranger
Shemha Miku is more into it than regularMiku
I honestly need more wholesome Chris after going through "Steeper"
Think he's refering to this one https://i.imgur.com/MdnuspT.png

If Steps has done anything for me,its made me wanna ship MikuChris

i hvae run through pretty much all of LLL
does anyone recognize them?



yeah. I have terrible observation skills

...really?

yes

The ending lmao


I'm sorry...I have a thing for Blue girls
Good to see best doll
Love that artist
I thought that was Hacchama for a second
YES
I think they meant in the show
yes
the gungnir gals
hate how twitter does that on discord mobile
i mean
I, again, request MikuChris
Who's the Moona?

I demand MikuChris
whose...whose tail is that?
Maria looks tiny
didnt notice
Yeah the lighting is blinding
oh
left on looks like Basa, right like Weiss
I dont know for sure if this is supposed to be Symphogear or RWBY related or soemthing else entirely
https://twitter.com/toru_dai/status/1158031793955590144?s=20
Maria's favorite Beatles song is "It's Okay to Leave A Dog in a Hot Car"
Because Maria to me is pretty boring
I'm more of a Zwei Wing shipper, and a Bayonet at least, than TsubaMari
But like yeah
I feel like thats a joke

I feel he'd love Tsubasa for the neverending angst
I'd love to see Dishwasher become a Symphogear fan; think of the art he'd do for the series
really liking evil Basa here. idk, ~~kinda hot~~

nice
I don't know if they have same voice
"Move over Noel, Hololive finally has its TRUE MILF"

I have watched the show and can tell they're not the same character wise
Just imagiinne what he'd do with Symphogearr
THat describes most of Dishwasher's RWBY art
Yee

Is that Mio Honda?
I've been scrolling through my friend's channel of Chris art to get onto my server in prep for ChrisMas

I prefer Kanadeverse still, but I can see why its called that too
Well I wasn't asking if she was involved in XDU shiit (I worded my origanl post poorly)
Most of the fics I've worked on thus far involve Kanade (K)
Specifically regarding Lost Song and the stuff unfolding there
(K) for Kanadeverse, (M) for mainverse
Kanadeverse
Has Kanade (K) gotten involved in any XDU shit
damn
Got any Kanade on ya?

I mean...they're both bottom left so
Ah yes...

What did Peace do to get cancelled this time?
I can just see Miku trying to give Hibiki a hug to try and comfort her but it only makes Hibiki snap when she realizes she can't return the hug

Looked up the artist and found this beautiful piece
Then again...that'd mean the OVAs would have to address a monment where we find out ||Tsubasa's is her Grandpa's daughter||, so...

I'm gonna shut up now, this went so far off topic
GOD I HATE STORYLINES INVOLVING ALTERNATE DIMENSIONS LIKE THIS
THEY KEEP MAKING MORE AND MORE AND IT MEANS I HAVE TO CARE OR READ UP ON EVERY SINGLE ONE TO UNDERSTAND WHATS HAPPENING AH
Like, reading through the opening Lost Song event, I come across this guy Julius and it seems I'm supposed to know him but I have no interest in him or his world, like I didn't care about Sharonverse until Tombasa and DereChris were a thing
but that also apparently requires a summary oof some other events from the first few events that it keeps calling back to but I can't give enough of a shit to care about them because they sound like super boring worlds and stuff
I'd love it if someone just fucking told me to my face what happened
(tfw I keep hearing what i assume to be Lost Song spoilers and liking what I hear but I get so bored with reading through endless docs of texts about what happened)
does anyone have any Tsubabiki art? Kinda in the mood for that, and shocked I got nothing of that

things I find hot: this

https://twitter.com/sento_san/status/1348634403476393984?s=19
too bad Kanade's around taking her


Oh boy, these two look super happy
I hope they get to be happy together and nothing gets to ruin their lives

I imagine THATs why she dons the SSJ from Ver...
So she can find and save Hibiki
I mean...if this is takes place after s1 and G, I assume Miku's not gonna take the news that "oh she's just dead" at face value
They're all torn about it, but Hibiki's completely fine with it
Miku and the others come to visit eveyr now and then
I entirely imagine she's kept in a sealed room underground
just realized this is the same artist for this

I love art that just makes one think up a story around it
i mean, yeah she can't transform...
But didn't she punch a noise before she transformed? Like, she's a relic fusion now, presumably she could fight, just not transformed

Yeah I think this is what he's looking for

Kanade being Kanade
i'm guessing its a wardrobe malfunction?
oh

I have a lot of complex feelings for this
https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/88567514


Is that literally chris?


Is that Winglet?


Thank you for making me feel like I'm not the only one on this server whose heard this band let alone that album

Agreed
That first one is top tier

Zwei Wing best ship
Niz
This one...notice bottom right corner
Though...a lot was xOgawa so...
Woke up and saw some nice Tsubasa stuff
I have two reactions to this
1.) That's fucking Chris, she's grown up a child slave, that's fucked up
2.) Damn that do be hot tho


https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/90180895


(partly posting because cute
Partially because I'm looking for the artist)

Would love a translation
https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/90130309
i mean, did you see here friggin transformation in XV?








decided to look through some RWBY art on Pixiv
I got more than enough good stuff
been having weird loading issues on pixiv, idk what it is
there

*Guts theme starts playing*
Like i said, in another universe, she's hanging out with the local heroes and figuring out a way to get back home.

Was thinking of having moments like that in my Hibiki isekai fic...if I get around to continuing that

Not related, need to get ygg on this one

what event are they from?


perfect summation of character dynamics right here
Dominance
wikipedia says 57

G-Force 2 lets go
Honeslty though, no clue. Not many red heads in Hollywood these days. 
Especially not with hair like that
live action Symphogear = big cringe
Fuck this needs to be canon
https://twitter.com/topturtling/status/1233448284804481025


scrolling throuhg a little used channel i got found some cool shit

I dont play it either, but I do wanna play with Atago's and Takao's titties nonstop

maybe could have worded that better, "come onto others" doesn't come off too right
idk, headcannon
where as Kanade is more forward and upfront and comes onto others, Chris always pushes people back it seems
I feel like they're the exact opposites

https://twitter.com/DenGungnir/status/1343583260769546241?s=20
"Serena and playing" love twitter translate
That's a beautiful Plutia

Thought that was kanade
Nice

probably too shitty tho, idk, just idea popped in my head
I have a terrible idea where Serena is able to transform from og version to adult version at will, and demorphs into kid form mid...stuff like this to mess with people
Checked the link
A lot of good Chris'....and Kanades...and Maria and basa, and Serena, and Transluminati, and...yeah a lot of good stuff
https://twitter.com/kaiyamon_XV/status/1407095677201666050?s=20

What's the oh no for?
but its gone
that image at least
i got it saved on my server

but no
was hoping this would help
tbh, that is the ONE good piece of art of that character I've ever been able to find and save

I need more of dark dominant Basa in my life

Kiraki's basa art is god tier
I dont know if i should laugh or cry
niz
I appreciate in this they're wearing shorts underneath


every time i see woman with blue or red hair i immediately think Basa/Kanade
But with Shemha, I know she wants to "destroy" me
Kanade I know will be having a blast
Yeah
I never wanted to be stepped on more in my life

Short answer: Shota Hitler clone

Axia is the only person whose Chris' are on the same powerlevel as Kaiya'

i love this gremlin

Why did Kaiya have to take this meme and give it quality

I would appreciate stronger bits of their friendship in the show more often. Sadly doesnt seem to really do that until XV
so...idk
I think the thing that makes me into it is the fact Hibiki is the one whose responsible for breaking Basa out of her emotional wall in s1
tbh, its a ship I developed for the Three Pug Night series, so
honestly favorite crackship besides Basa/Hibiki

The show's a mess, but it has a special place in my heart

yeah, the more you look at it the more...details you notice


Sorry, I just didn't remember this one at all

If it is, I've not been able to find it
i take that back....ENTIRELY because of that current project
Third fav ship though is Hibibasa, mostly because of a current project
yeah, Bayonet I''d say is my favorite...maybe Hibimiku, just because of Steps
wait, when did they do that? I'm sorry I got this far in without thinking about it, but I'm looking at Pixiv and I can't find a single Fine/Chris art they did...am I missing something?
yeah...I'm not ok with that
In that regard, I see no real issue with ChrisXAdultLeo...as long as its AdultLeo
yeah
Well, depending on the Fine
If this is Adultverse Fine who isn't a terrible person to Chris, I can see that
its to highlight the absolute absurdity of his backstory
oh fuck best/worst artist has new stuff out
why is this a thing again?



think that should go in <#336297808221044736>

idk, maybe we should kill this and just get back to posting cool art
im not sure that far but...
you know, if we're gonna have this convo, maybe we should move this, because this isn't necessarily the chat for this kinda convo...i dont think
trust me aand Ardania on this
There are horrors that I've lived through and needlessly been a part of that I wouldn't wish any of yall to experience
Not even my worst enemies deserve this kinda stuff
i know
my recommendation: watch the trailers, if you like those, watch v1-4, skip v5, and carry on with v6-8
if it doesn't click with you at any point there, you can drop it whenever. Just avoid getting into fandom groups because there's so much drama and shit that its best to live your life without knowing any of it
but yeah, focusing on RWBY
It has its place in my heart,
Theres a lot about the show I have problems with...like a lot.
Some parts haven't aged gracefully as others, the writing in the earlly seasons is kinda weak (the Faunus subplot I can go on hours about), and after Monty's death the show kinda lost a bit of its character, and all that leads to volume 5, which is one of the biggest trainwrecks I've ever seen.
But v6 on (when they got rid of Gray and weren't being hamstrung by other projects diverting more resources), the show improves dramatically.
yeah, that's a whole mess to say the least
idk why that didn't link

but yeah, Scythe/Sniper combo
not shotgun

yeah, I like a lot of the "reinterpretations"

I can't stop screaming

WTFFFFFFFF
But then I come across those two and I'm like "Wtf"
I was expecting RWBY stuff and whatever random anime art I liked back when
I was just digging through google drive, looking at my image folder from my early discord days (back when I was an asshoole who kept getting kicked off all the servers i was on and thus kept loosing access to images)
Decided to go through them all to delete them or download them and repost them to my personal server for preservation (and to save space)

HOLY SHIT I DUG THESE UP ON MY GOOGLE DOCS WTF I HAD THESE SINCE 2018 I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THE SHOW FOR LIKE ANOTHER 2 YEARS
that we know of
Kanadeverse, potentially
all this proto maria stuff is making me want to return to my Edgemiku project

Oh god that's horrible ~~please fucking do it it'd be so hot~~

also isn't Oboro the villainess?

Wholesome sword
eh, I've gone numb to all that shit at this point, so not triggered by it really. I'll give him what I know, if anything to get crap off my chest.
tfw some guy dm's me about interviewing you about some fucked up shit I was involved with in a community I wanted to leave behind and finally though I had escaped from with this new community
I think thats the joke he was going for earlier
He's fine, he just gets edgy
For example I've never taken you seriously on any of the edgy stuff you say daily
Improvement
I understand. I am a very maliable person, and I've noticed its been really easy for people to convince me of shit.
I'm more aware of that now than I was then.
and it wasn't just that. A lot of stuff contributed, including that
I'm being vague because I got into a rabbit hole I'm not proud of falling in. That's all I want to say on the subject.
These kinds of folks nearly pushed me towards alt right shit if I didn't run into folks who told me "Yeah no, these people are full of shit, this isn't what we are all about"
and only after finding Freddie Mercury was gay
I say that as a het man who stopped being homophobic back in middle school
I genuinely hope these people are just plants for right wing folks to excuse their shittiness with. https://twitter.com/lndeedee/status/1340005197695733760
This is one of his better one
Yes
Did he actually say that?
Its funny to watch my "friends" go on about how the dems are pedos and friends of Jeff Epstein...
And then I just post the clip of Trump and Epstein having a cordial chat 20 years ago and watch as my "friends" lose their minds
Agreed
It is incredible to see both my right wing friends and you guys agree about the $600 stimulus check being shit
certainly an improvement
(can't wait for Saint Germain to bring about America's downfall)
The only thing America has over UK in terms of stupidity is population size and entitlement from being the current world superpower...for now at least...
The UK has a monarchy, a state church, and a legislative branch consisting of folks with hereditary nobility.
The UK is going to be just slightly dumber than America
I will admit up front, I'm much more right leaning on a lot of stuff. 
I do try to keep as open a mind as possible tho, and not just spout out party bullshit (the thought of a religious nut like Pence being a potential candidate to ride Trump's coat tails one of these elections scares me)
In the primaries I was hoping for Tulsi, because she seemed more willing to call out folks like Kamala and Hillary for their bull. Seemed like a perffect counterweight to Trump
I'd probably name some folks you hate. Ted Cruz has made a turn around since 2016, just focusing on his anti-china stance and supporting the Hong Kong Protests I respect
Rather than supporting one party as a whole
I'm more looking at individuals in each party now
worried that folks like Pelosi will learn nothing from this, blame Trump for this, and just try to push the same thing when Biden takes office
I remember back in 2016 I used to be Vote Blue No Matter Who
Now I just see both parties as entities of corruption and evil
yeah
good
Yup

I mean, Noah when asked says Carson see's it as a power thing rather than him being into kids
Yeah, I watched him back in the day when he made dumb discord videos with his terrible and slow sense of humor that was funny because it was so bad
I've not kept up with him really because its not the kinda stuff I watch these days
Idk, this stuff just came out today. I personally would like to wait for further developments before coming to a verdict
Given the stuff with Pyro just before and other incidents I've seen play out in recent years...this could be blown out of proportions
Though Carson does openly admit to what he did here https://twitter.com/ItsJoko/status/1346350840228012035?s=20
He's only recently come back to streaming after that all went down
Last year everyone supported him when people found out his girlfirend cheated on him with multiple guys behind his back
yeaj
I've posted the original post along with the clip showing Carson admitted to these acts to other servers I'm on.
So far, the response I've gotten from them have been almost unanimous
Pretty much all the folks who respond to the posts say "Carson's 19, the people involved are 17, the age gap isn't as bad as it seems, technically 17 isn't a child anymore, etc."
https://twitter.com/Slimecicle/status/1346437094177124352?s=20
well...today's a thing now
yeah
He certainly handled that situation better than I did back when a certain asshole I knew accused me of sexting minors and shit on Twitter. Fucking flipped out on the dude and was in a state of unbridled rage for two days.
Will say though, from JOKO's twitter vid, Carson seems to be handling the situation better than most, being upfront and honest about it, not denying it or banning people for bringing it up.
I got so many adds on my phone for Warnock and Ossoff when i was in college up in Georgia
Problem being I was a resident of Florida and couldn't vote for them
Even my right wing nuthead "friends" hate McConnell
Its funny because the most vocal one is a finnish dude
Im sending this to the server I'm on where the polchat is dominated by two righties bordering on alt-right
Either they'll ignore it (doubtful), find some way to weasle a defense for it (what I expect of them), or they'll legitamately surprise me and denounce that shit

biggest fucking cope of this day
(resident Civil War nerd here)
The US military didn't recognize the CSA as a soveriegn nation, just a rebelious region. 
The CSA tried to become a nation, but struggled to get foreign recognition because it wouldn't budge on the issue of Slavery (which tells you a lot about their priorities, don't it?)
I honestly think the Democrat and Republican parties should just be disbanded at this point
Politicians nowadays are more interested in the party platform than doing shit that needs to be done.
Fucking Tribalism...
https://twitter.com/MPlDZjKLfDXN4WN/status/1346910080084557829?s=20
just something to keep in the back of everyone's mind in this
certainly
Which raises another problem:
Is this going to just insight more shit from his supporters, if they rush through the process? 
I know this is dealing with the deluded extremist end of the spectrum...but they literally just broke into Congress
At most, I expect it to just be symbolic this impeachment
Unless they can somehow manage to rush it through what should require weeks of committees and testimonies and shit, its not going to be put in place in time for the transition to finish the 20th
The vote for impeachment passed the House but not the Senate
the point of Impeachment to my Knowledge is to remove the protections of the presidency against certain legal accusations before being brought before supreme court on whatever charge he's being accused of
Excuse me if my knowledge of Impeachment and the presidency is off but...there's only 2 weeks of Trump left. Can't they just wait until he's out of office and then press charges for this? 
Because the last time they tried to impeach him it spanned months.

Hence why I said "Borderline Coup" because some of these people WANTED to kill some congressman...but only if it was easy or convinient
Riot is too weak of a term for this
Most riots don't end with the rioters getting inside the seat of government chanting slogans and calling for politicians to hang and shit
The only reason he said that is because the Republicans fucked up spectacularly, and so they're won't be any legitamate opposition to Biden for a while, giving him the perfect chance to push needed reforms...but that's not what they want to do
They want a facade of opposition to excuse inaction, because in reality, these people would rather keep the status quo. This is why every fucking time Bernie Sanders get close to winning the primaries, some bullshit happens to undermine his fucking campaign. (Perssonallly not a Bernie bro either; the guy has no integrety and immediately bows to whoever fucked him over for the sake of "unity").
Like...the Republicans just encouraged a borderline coup
Meanwhile Biden's saying "We need a strong Republican party"
https://youtu.be/FoP9ufM3bjw
All he had to do was just say "election rigged", and then just sit and wait the next 4 years before he could run again hoping that Biden fucks up or fails to fulfill the vague promises he made. 
But no. Stirs up a mob to storm the capital...then fucking turns on them
Trump is the biggest fucking idiot to have sat in the oval office
Like, we've had lockedowns and tornado drills and shit
I guess Georgia just doesn't care
I never had shooter drills

I don't know the situation so

Of course there's the issue of her starting to lose trust in you keeping something from her
But on the other hand it sounds like your looking up porn or something she finds weird or disagreeable
If she doesn't, then don't
If she pushes you do it
Yes
Of course, there are plenty of pre-ww1 MoHs which were well deserved
But a lot of the time you get some weird and stupid ones
Anyone remember a few years back when people tried to get the 20 medal of honor awards given for the Wounded Knee Massacre, but that got shot down by McCain because he claimed crap about "how the US had different values back then and we can't judge them or reprimand them for what they did" and acting as if revoking MoH's is unprecedented when there's plenty of instances where pre-WW1 MoH's got rescinded because back in the day the MoH wasn't as prestigious as it is now and got handed out like cotton candy (In one case, during the civil war, an entire regiment was awarded MoHs for not disbanding during a crisis; in the 1890s the guy in charge of the army awarded the MoH to himself).

Honestly, given how ridiculously op the queen is, I've always seen it as the better piece
Often when thats the case, its always made out that "The weak king was dominanted by his evil, caniving wife/mother" or some shit like that
Like, the one case where most historians agree was a mutual partnership was Justinian and Theodora (and even there there's a few of THOSE folks around).

I'm sorry this is a tangent but: 
Remember when Joker came out, CNN said that the film was pro-Incel and "right wing" folks came to its defence while "leftwing" folks tried to denegrate it, despite it being a leftist (more specifcally marxist) flick in its plot, theming and shit?
100%
Yes
<@!722121666641133608> <@!213645184125239317> Just to clarify, have you both watched this film yourselves? As I've said, I have not personally, but I had a friend who decided to torrent it and gave me live text reactions. There definitely is some shady stuff here and there according to him (I remember he mentioned that the girls do twerk and grind on a guy, and during a fight between the girls one of them gets pants and we see a panty shot.)
Personally, I think the biggest issue was the fact this was liveaction. If this film were, say animated, they wouldn't have to get actual children involved in the movie. There'd still be an outcry and people would be divided on the film, but it wouldn't be AS BAD as it stands now.
Yeah, same.
I personally have not seen Cuties myself (nor am I curious to do so), so I may entirely be wrong about what I'm about to say: but from all I can tell, the film is a very poor message about breaking from traditional values. The main character is a girl from a devout muslim family, who gets into "dancing" in order to break away from the stringent family life she's forced into, at least according to the folks I've talked to who have seen it; they allso say the ending, where the mc "realizes" that what she's doing is wrong and goes back to her family felt haphazard.
The bigger issue here of course being does artistic liscense justify the (simulated) sexual exploitation of children? From all I've heard, in the case of this movie, its filmmaking, themeing etc is not strong enough to justify this case.
What really annoys me about the Cuties controversy is how it just became another left/right battleground when it didn't need to be a hill for anyone to die on
I've seen lefty folks denounce the movie as well, more so than the few who actually defended it.

I don't know much about her
I mean...I'm just going off what you are willing to tell us. And from what you've told us, we are giving you the best advice possible. I've gone through the shit you've described years ago myself. And what I'm telling you is what actually helped me
That''s been helping me a lot lately
<@!354236264595324928> Do you get outside often? 
My recommendation to thinking healthier is to try to do some excercise, maybe cut back on junk food and try to eat healthier (don't have to get on a salads only plan or something), or just, sit outside and read a book every now and then.
The world's certainly fucked, and most people are often prevented from reaching the top because not everyone has the same "luck"
But don't thinkk you should kill yourself because of that shit
Don't kill yourself because you can't feel happy, or motivated or whatever
Don't think like that.

yeah, in primary school, k-12
tbh, I've only heard that part through the grape vine. Probably should do more research on it, so take everything I say with a HEAVY grain of salt
the American education system is based heavily on the old Prussian system, where schooling exist to merely educate someone enough to join the military or workforce (primarily factory labor), except that now we live in a post-industrial world and so that education is mostly useless and downright abusive (not as bad as the original Prussian school system, because the old punishment system has been phased out by minor reform, but by modern standards pretty fucking brutal)
I'm so glad my closest experience of him has been through a negative CAH based deck card

Remember how Trump put in place his muslim ban and border wall in the first month of his presidency? Of course, Muslim Ban got negated by the Supreme Court. 
Biden could do it. He has Congress in his camp, the only wild card standing against him would be the Supreme Court with Trump's recent picks on board
I can see that but...different people react differently, so, not the BEST method of determination
Well, scrolling through the chat, you've already answered most if not all the things I'd possibly ask
Loving the discussion.
Will say, I've never really been in a relationship myself, and I'm not rushing into one atm. Maybe its just because I'm just generally introverted and anti-social; maybe its just that I take after my dad and am willing to wait. 
Thanks Shemmy for shedding light on the whole poly thing. Whenever I hear about that kinda stuff, its usually the negative, abusive stuff, and usually hear it from the one fucking neo-nazi on my friend's server who should have been banned months ago.
I love how people are obsessing over Joe Biden's dog instead of actual policy issues rn
Any of you wanna live in a world where our politicians actually care about the common good and wouldn't filibuster a $2K stimulus check during a national emergency while spending trillions of dollars instead on never ending wars and a fighter jet they just gave up on? BECAUSE I REALLY WANNA BE THERE INSTEAD OF HERE I CAN FUCKING TELL YOU THAT!
Do any of you guys ever think to yourself "Is there a way for me to get out of this acursed world?"

Pretty much yeah
you know, while on the topic of hypothetical better realities than this:
Can I get a world were the War on Drugs never fucking happened and we weren't equiping our police forces with high level military hardware and disproportionately oppressing black people and other minorities in the process, leading to our massive fucking prison population?
Oh, and can we add in MLK not getting shot? I know I'm getting greedy here, but that'd be real fucking nice to have

given how many campaign promises Biden broke within the last two months, I can't be too sure he isn't stupid enough to try
well, your right
this may be a misunderstanding and its some other country or whatever, but if this is how it looks:
Biden just started two fucking wars in one week
the US may just have launched a missle strike on Saudi Arabia, but it got intercepted and shot down...
On the one hand, we've been supporting the Saudis to the detriment of human rights and the extention of the War on Terror since this century started, so I'm all for us undermining the Saudis
On the other hand...its another front to the foever wars...and the Saudis have Mecca...and the US has a track record of poor public relations acts...this is gonna be BAD
From what I've heard that is partially true, heard it is the only state in the country in debt
I know in Germany (from experience) public nudity is not at all taboo. Remember walking through Berlin with my Dad a few years back, glancing to the side seeing a bunch of men and women sunbathing nude in a park. 
Considering the Germans were quite liberal on sex issues back in the Weimar days, not too surprising
who knows, could be though
Kansas? Doubt it, that's been pretty conservative consistently for a hundred years
Like, my parents probably weren't given sex ed in school like I was
of course. 
Thing is, most societies in the last century were heteronormative for a long time, up until recent decades has the paradigm changed to a more expansive view of such things. I can't attest for how things were like outside the US, but the US has a long history of societal puritanism and prudism
remember, we are all monkey brain. We got a LOT of shit to learn in life that isn't always imprinted in birth or whatever
Anyway, on Sex ed where I came from:
I lived in Georgia, but one of the more liberal parts north of Atlanta. So, Sex Ed was pretty detailed and hit the right bases, it seems. Also had LGBT awareness, which, I should note, in Middle School I was SUPER homophobic, so, while I zoned out during those parts (especially when I heard the presenter "accuse" my favorite artist at the time, Elton John, of being gay...which is why if time travel tech is invented the first thing Ill do is go back to when I was younger so I can slap some sense into younger me because HOW COULD YOU BE THAT DUMB!), eventually I got over those hangups annd became more accepting of that kind of stuff.
god I love having to explain what a TERF is to people on a history server I'm modding. Really fun explaining the shitty (ir)rational beliefs of these...human beings, lets give the benefit of the doubt
Seems like the people who are most likely pulling this kind of shit have real dirt on their shoes
Like in the turtledove book, the one historical pov character was Hans Rudel, a luftwaffe pilot and historical hardcore Nazi (though Turtledove portrays him more loose in terms of ideology, the real Rudel was a diehard who had his squadron crash his planes behind US lines during the surrender so they wouldn't be able to use their planes).
Yeah
I'm starting to notice a pattern with the examples I recall so far...
pretty much
I remember they changed the names of one of the SS generals in A Bridge Too Far because the actual general he was based on was still alive and threatened legal action...even though he was probably liable for some atrocities on the Eastern Front, because SS be like that
probably because some of them were fucking Nazis and didn't want to get attention drawn to them
SOme do, some don't
I can only recall seeing it myself and taking note reading one of Harry Turtledove's WW2 alt-history series, where he uses a lot of real life characters with some of his "oc's" lets say
I know in historical and alt history novels I always see the "the characters in this book may share the names and likenesses of certain real people, but they're not guys" disclaimer; some historical movies too. 
All because Prince Yusupov got pissed off with his depiction in one Rasputin movie (which, he murdered a man in cold fucking blood, so, he shouldn't have been allowed to pull that kinda shit, but we live in clown world)
if they cared enough yes
certainly better to write about a deceased person, like Churchill, or...David Bowie...
Though a lot of people will have certain emotions regarding those figures if you decide to take "liberties"
certainly. 
I say that from experience, as a lot of what I work on outside of symphogear is mostly in regards to the American Civil War (never knew I'd ever felt the need to bring it up here but here we are)
true
Thats the basis for all libel lawsuits
Though I can understand it at times
If your say writing a historical story, or something taking place in the real world, you'll probably have real life people populating your fics as side characters at the least if not primary characters or protagonists. 
That said, its kinda a touchy subject even then, where you feel the need to get that person's personality down, or at least their character...when the reality is its hard to judge someone's character when you have fragmentary information about them in most cases
but in all seriousness, yeah RPF is weird to me
can I live in your world where people don't know who tf Dream is? I want that, I want out of this world

Tfw I'm sitting down watching a bunch of J. J. McCullough videos and seeing Andrew Scheer like that one meme from Once Upon a Time In Hollywood (not sure I'm allowed to post a meme image in this channel)
I can't believe I had a nuanced discussion about Hitler and the Nazis/Wehrmacht on the Internet.
How the times have changed from...idk, 5 years ago
Yeah, the clean Wehrmacht shit, thanks Halder and co
Remember kids: don't fight a war of extermination against your enemy. If shit goes south, you better be prepared for the consequences, because there's no way in hell you are going to negotiate your way out of it
Also, since he didn't have the same military education as the average general, he had a better grasp on strategic thinking than most of not all his generals, as german doctrince empasized tactical and operational focus. 
For example: in Barbarossa, Hitler wanted to focus the bulk of the force in the southern front, in order to grab the valuable resources in that sector which would undermine the Soviet ability to carry on a fight. However, Halder, with the campaign in France in mind and wanting a swift victory, wanted a push for Moscow, hoping that would result in a coup d'main on the Soviets.
Hitler gave that the go ahead...and it failed. Even if they did take Moscow, the Germans were already commiting massive atrocities upon the Soviet civilians and pows, as it was a war of Slavic extermination, they wouldn't have surrendered just because Moscow failed.
Of course, the whole war of extermination is on Hitler's shoulders. Some in the wehrmacht, specifically von Kleist, were against this and thought it be better in regions where Soviet authority was despised like Ukraine that the Nazis should be like liberators. Probably would have helped undermine the Soviet war effort dramatically
Because of that background, he clashed heavily with the Junker elite of the military, which in the long run resulted in antagonism between the two that resulted in most of the German intelligence agency actively undermining the German war effort (Oster and Canaris) and the other generals plotting to kill him...several times...
Thing about Hitler...he's simultaneously the best and worst example of the "Self made man" trope, where a guy rises from the dregs of society to become a major world leader.
Man goes from being a broke failed artist in Vienna in 1914 to being the man ruling most of mainland Europe by 1942.
Pretty much
Hitler had his strengths (would t say "positives" because he's fucking Hitler), and it seems the lunatic angle was played up by certain nazi generals in regards to the Soviet war (because America did not give a shit about that front beyond getting tactical advice on fighting the soviets). 
Later in the war, when shit is pretty much irreversible, is where you see his mental state truly breakdown so spectacularly.
I will never forget David Bowie's quote
"Hitler was the first rock star. Almost as good as Jagger"
https://twitter.com/orlandosuazojr/status/1372908959380746248 for some levity to that...confusing thing
I'm fucking scratchin through my skull on this one
https://twitter.com/consequence/status/1372724515021672450?s=20
oh thats the thing
NO ONE REMEMBERS THE SPANISH FLU
Its never brought up in high school american history, they usually just go from World War 1 to the roaring 20s and at best will only mention it breifly
"This guy breathes oxygen, you know who else breathed oxygen: Hitler"
"Yo, this politician is super charismatic...he's just like Hitler"
its more just lazyness with historical memory
Like its ALWAYS the Hitler card or the holocaust whenever people compare modern political shit to anything.
Clear example of why Godwin's Law is a thing
about the butterknife meme?
I will qualify this as its been pointed out that the subreddit this is posted on is rantgrumps, which seems to be one of those "hatedom" groups that wants to take some show or youtube channel down a peg for whatever issues they have with them. So this COULD be a projared situation going on. It is possible
However, also seeing people in the replies to the tweet trying to say what Dan did isn't grooming or pedophilia, scrolled through one convo where a guy got called out for saying that shit and he replied to the video evidence sayign "thats just Dan being Dan". So...that means Dan's a piece of shit and that's part of his character? Wtf is that defense? 
Top detractor in the replies is calling conspiracy because critical replies (presumably ones more egregious in tone towards the situation than the "Dan just being Dan" guy) are being deleted or hidden.
I can't be shocked or disappointed by any of this shit anymore. Its like fucking clockwork now.

Blame incompetence before malice, i believe the saying goes
thats why it got replaced
yup
who?
still shit on my end though
some parts of the country better than others
I knew that back in like 5th grade
go on
Reason its called Spanish Flu of course being Spain being the only country reporting on it when it first broke out, because they weren't suprressing the press due to massive ongoing war
The American education system is such an absurd failure
Like, even if its mentioned, theyll never tell how we responded to it, how society changed during that time period
And so, when COVID hit, and you finally get a bunch of articles about how we did handle the Spanish Flu back in 1918-1919, people will think "oh, these writers are just trying to be topical and making shit up to justify this *obvious conspiracy*"
talking about Bolsanaro again?
question:
If the president of the united states assaulted, say, President Bolsanaro, or another controversial world leader, could they get away with it?
yee
love how the convo's gone from talking about a politician's bizarre relationships with pedophiles to how to format spoilered quotes on discord.
Sauce: ||https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/coventry-captive-girl-attic-torture-den-david-challenor-coventry-a8502991.html||
that didnt work (last minute edit save there)
Reading the Independent article on him (as it seems to be the most reputable source without a damn paywall):
|| Police searched his property and found bondage gear including sex aids, gaffer tape, dummies, a stun gun and ropes hanging from the beam in his dungeon-style attic.

He even took photographs of the abuse carried out on the child which included attaching clips to give her electric shocks and putting pegs on her body. ||
and the site is activily deleting any posts made about her
that's gonna make people just act more critically and talk more harshly about her, because thats what happens when you enforce strict censorship of speech
its fucking reddit
yeah
like...given how two people in her life are into fucking kids, and she maintained ties with them for some time after the knowledge of them being into fucking kids was out there, it seems she has her own skeletons in her closet to me. Just makes one ask a lot of questions.
https://www.greenparty.org.uk/assets/images/national-site/Final%20report%20-%20Executive%20summary-%20cover.pdf
if you want further sources the wikipedia article links articles in the paragraphs
and her dad was a registered sex offender who had been caught in the home SHE LIVED IN with abducted 10yo girl
And AFTER that, she hires him as her campaign manager...
that's be fine if, say, she broke off with him afterwards...
But she married him 6 months later
Can't wait until a certain group of people finds out about this and comes to their own conclusions /s
Her wiki says she left Stonewall (major LGBT+ org in britain) because of hostile environment towards trans people in the UK", and I'm like "you got kicked out because you are the worst look for the trans and LGBT community"
I'm done with God today

Why does everyone go on about Crypto currency causing ecological damage? Shouldnt it be reversed because it's a virtual, no print material like cash, no trees cut down for it?
I've read through a bit of this, taking a break because need to make lunch and prep for classes etc, so I'll get back to this
But from what I've glanced it's pretty incipid. Big thing I noticed is that the article refers to the subject with male pronouns when they identify as female.
(article in question. Warning; cavalier misgendering of subject, plus aforementioned instances of pedophilia and r*pe, probably more stuff I failed to classify or notice): ||https://grahamlinehan.substack.com/p/ashton-challenor-the-boy-who-disappeared||
tfw people are sharing around an article about the Challenor shit from Graham Linehan's website (Linehan being a notorious anti-trans activist and a rank hypocrite about free speech) and getting defensive when getting called out for getting information from a blatant transphobe's thinktank
I heard about Mauler because Fatmanfalling was bitching about him on twitter and looking like an asshole in the process, got into his stuff some time afterwards. Was kinda refreshing to hear someone take down over-pretentious video essay-isms and hypocricy...
But I eventually got tired of his 12-hour streams and bad takes and pointless beefs...
from what I've gleaned from the Contradrama, she said she didn't understand NB, but was asking people to explain it to her so she could understand that concept...
Then again I heard that from folks like Vaush and MauLer back when I still had respect for those two, so that may be miscontrued on my end
makes content about political stuff
trans youtuber
Clicking on the trending tab just gives me headaches
also calling her transphobic but she made a video deconstructing transphobia in film and media like a few weeks ago

https://twitter.com/kaludiasays/status/1375609606941122563?s=20
wish Twitter would give me a description like they do every time Dream breathes
looking at it, its something to do with something she said about ATLA, and trans stuff, but I can't tell what the catalyst is
Why is Lindsay Ellis trending on twitter?
law expired? New law passed?
Because fuck reddit, barely use it outside of art, and I have been relying on this server more for that recently
Still gonna delete my account once I figure out how I'm gonna be communicating with this guy who asked me about information for a video going forward.
"we did it reddit"
i will say, kinda agree with...him...on this one
oh Kyle Kallgren...
again, beautiful world we live in
its a long story even I cannot comprehend
>low-key implication of "nazi" associated with the word
I love this timeline
like, try making "Hunk" sound like an insult. It'd be much harder than doing the same for "twink"
I mean, if its used with the right emphasis and intent
i guess it can be deragotive if its something that can be seen as "lesser"
Like, try insulting a guy by calling him a hunk, then do the same calling him a twink. Just by how it sounds, one is a harder punch than the other
honestly, I actually think there's a point to be made here, about how Avatar started a trend of asian influenced fantasy stories for the YA demographic in recent years...
But i can see why thats not the focus of the conversation is, more on her saying Avatar Redux as if its a bad thing, I guess.
I get the feeling in here both sides are just...being cringe. Can't think up a better word than Cringe but thats what fits best hearing someone complain about Lindsay Ellis being a "white critic"
maybe its because she refered to one of the characters as "twinky"
agreed. Like 100%.
I used to be super maliable back in the day. Whoever said something I thought was intellegent, fell for their immediately
Now Im a bit smarter, and I watch stuff with an sense of detachment and skepticism
too bad I don't make those
smart decisions
Will say though, in a way, MauLer is kinda responsible for getting me into Symphogear, because I met Rhyyman on his server, we got along and eventually he bulli me into watching the show. 
So I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for him
Still, don't want to touch another video of his for as long as I can
Like, Rags is a Gamergate nut whose utterly smug and assholish
Then there is Wolf, the complete edgelord who deleted his channel twice after realizing the shit he was saying was only exacerbating his own issues with mental health
A lot of edgelords in their circle...and Jay Exci, who honestly is the only reasonable one of the mainstays, though that depends on whether hanging out with MauLer on a 12 hour live stream discord call is reasonable or not
Speaking of people i USED to (keep that in mind, USED TO) follow back in the day...
aside from some right wing views and being friends with Sargon
Of course, took me some time to realize that, but of all the shit he's gotten into, I'd say thats the worst I've come across
Even i thought it was dumb of them to cover her, like, it wasn't a big deal review or anything, it was someone's first reaction to a movie
oh yeah, the Jenny Nicholson thing
terrifying?
Its just a drama circle
Yup
i mean, doesn't sound like that to me
Still shit
i'm guessing is the assumption is the person was afraid of being assaulted by the gay/trans pperson, because we all know Gays/trans people just hit on anyone whose their gender /s
i can kinda agree on the free speech thing, kinda...
Basically saying they got their own white privelege and tread on black people etc
its...its a bunch of really hateful stuff about the Asian American community
yeah, was quite surprised to learn a while that the African American community has a significant problem with Anti-asian hate and anti-semetism. 
Thats the thing about racism. Since its a bullshit and broad concept, anyone from any side of the world can believe it in some form
There's no such thing as a "white race" or "black race" or any of those other ones. We are all human, the only difference being some random gene determining skin color
Race is a bullshit concept that's debunked by modern science
Honestly, that's just European Racism for you. Like, look at the comments of some random video in some slavic language related to something in Yugoslavia and the Balkans, all of them are "Slavs" and yet the vile they spew against each other is absolutely rancid and vicous to the point it becomes absurd the accusations.
American Racism: Its...its a lot messier than it seems
And sometimes if I'm confused enough, I get hectic
I'm just so confused
What kinda jokes are there for that?
Like, why do your friends even remember that well enough or care enough to make jokes about it?
Like, i can understand why people can remember Hitler's birthday. Its Hitler, he did shit people can remember him for (not positive things, mind you)
Meanwhile, Queen Elizabeth has done pretty much nothing since she was coronoated. She doesn't even have real power or sway over her own government or country, she exists as a figurehead to sign off on stuff other people came up with.
No one ever told me that
Like, I never knew that
Who gives a shit about the Queen
the birthday thing
I get it now
I never heard of a 4/21 joke? Is it merely just that one vine "21" joke?
Ok
Wasn't asking about that
So, your birthday is the 26th but its also 4/21?
I...what?
I'm guessing your birthday is the 20th?

Do you think your family will help? Or are they...well, detached?

like, i dont know how it work on Arkansas's level
they need to vote on the bill again and have a better margin than before
https://youtu.be/tdEE5uvFhOM thing on Haber so I'll shut up and let an expert talk
Yup
Thing was, Haber was jewish, so, when the Nazis came to power, his family was persecuted and some were gassed with Zyklon B
Speaking of...one of Haber's later invention was a fertilizing agent called Zyklon A...after he died, the Nazis took that and created you guessed it Zyklon B
Like Haber got the Science prize because of some fertilizer stuff he did afterwards
To be fair, there's more than just a peace prize
At least dynamite has some civilian purposes, like mining and demolition.
Pepperidhe farm remembers
Remember the time Fritz Haber, the guy who invented poison gas, got a nobel?
Melua explained it a lot better than I could
So yeah...this shouldn't normally happen.
Sorry I stopped halfway through my explanation, got dm'd about another server drama. Anyway:
Should be noted, I don't know how it works on Arkansas' level, but on the national level, you only need 50% of the vote in Congress to pass a bill (without a perfect tie of Yea or Nay). If it gets vetoed, it goes back before Congress, where both houses must vote on it AGAIN, and this time need a 2/3 majority to pass it
The one time I can recall off the top of my head this happened was after the Civil War, when I believe the 14th or 15th Amendment, can't remember which, (which gave basic civil rights to newly freed african americans) passed in majority Republican Congress, but it got vetoed by Democratic (and anti-Abolitionist) Andrew Johnson. The bill went back to congress, and they passed it on the second go around. It was the first time it was done.

Aid: "But he never had the influence that television has"
Nixon: "The last six Roman emperors were fags. You see, homoseuality, immorality in general, these are the enemies of strong societies. That's why the Communists and the left-wingers are pushing it. They're trying to destroy us".||
Totally historically accurate assessment right here /s
Because 40 years ago we had people in power who said shit like this https://youtu.be/cMfVnBmpMm8
I mean, what else is there to talk about? /s
Philip II is basically the guy who set the stage for Alexander's Success
He turned Macedon from a backwater state to an organized one, turned the army into the most effective force in Greece, and brought the city states of Thebes and Athens under his thumb
wasn't she Brutus' mom or am I thinking of someone else?
Got that deet wrong
Like during some Senatorial proceedings, he recieved a letter. Cato, one of Caesar's opponents, told him to read it out loud to the Senate, as he thought it was part of some plot against the conservative faction or something. Caesar tried to talk him down from that, but Cato persisted. And thus, Caesar read it aloud. Turned out to be from Cato's wife, talking about they're lovely night together...if you catch the meaning...
I love reading the life of Caesar. There's always some hilarious anecdote to him
Yeah, Julius was never Emperor. highest title was dictator for life. His nephew Octavian was first Emperor (after changing his name to augustus)
And yet even then, part of it existed for another thousand years
Personally I'm of the opinion that ROme surviving until 476 was a miracle, because it suffered so many crises that should have toppled it
should note: even this is highly debated.
Which I think is why the right wing femboy meme is a thing
yeah, its ok if youre the dominante. 
if your a bottom, your essentially a femboy
its a better take to say Chritianity caused the fall of the Empire than freaking homosexuality
Rome's last 6 emperors were christians, and most have little evidence for being gay
Which...yeah, over Kashmir, because that was a mess
I think they meant Pakistan and India
yes

Oh wait, Prohibition, exact same shit
because thats what happens when you try to crack down on public vices
and all its done is made cartels big, and our prison populations bigger
its only exacerbated the issue and gave them a bundle of fresh excuses to use
Personally, I place the blame for this shit on the War on Drugs and the associated militarization of the police. 
When you give people a fuckton of firepower at their disposal and a sense of authority and power, brutal shit's gonna happen
I agree with MLK. We should understand where the feelings are coming from that are causing riots. But ain't mean we gotta condone them
Rioting is a terribly ineffecient expression of discontent. All it does is antagonize outsider to one's cause; and often the people's lives who are getting the most fucked over by the riots are often the minority communities. 
Like, there's this famous video of a black store owner crying and shouting at a bunch of rioters in LA 92 for ruining his life
/s
Listen, Poland needs its time to be "European" (Read: randomly backflipping into right wing reactionary conservatism)
1.) I get the feeling that with the Pfizer vaccine and everything coming out, things will die out, say, by the fall or winter
FUCK
Edit: Apologies. Thought I was tabbed on my server to post that....
they're like a weird language enclave, where their closest related language groups are from Siberia and Mongolia
its in many ways a positive to be involved in something like the EU for nations like Poland and Hungary, as they alone can't compete with major trade powers like the US or China without help
But that doesn't erase centuries of conflict between nations. I'm surprised honestly its ONLY really Hungary and Poland causing issue with the EU
right
Like I said, reductionism for comedic effect
Thing I was getting at with Poland trying to be "European" was me trying and failing to joke about the fact Poland in the last 350 years has spent more of its existence under some foreign authoritarian dictatorship of some capacity (Prussia/Imperial Germany; Imperial Russia; Nazi Germany; puppet state of the Soviet Union)
So now they have a chance to do the stuff other countries have done to it for centuries. 
Then again, thats me being comedic and reductionist
https://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/1382334979766632452?s=21

like, its something I hear conspiracy nuts say all the time
doubt it honestly will go this far, at least in America
Name one "successful" communist nation that didn't fall into authoritarianism
~~so basically facism~~
It's Communism without the economics of Communism, but they keep the authoritarianism of Communism, so it's literally the worst of both worlds
Exactly
my guess, its a way to circumvent needing to care about discrimination. With the tests, they could pull some shit out of their ass (metaphorically) instead of just "We don't want you on the team because you're trans".

i posted it because i remember when the drama on twitter went down there were some opinions on her and I don't know if this changes those people's views or just reinforces them
Apparently Lindsay Ellis finally released a response video to the twitter drama. 
https://youtu.be/C7aWz8q_IM4
🤮
I didn't even read that part
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Read the second screen...
I'm reading this now
My guess as to why the first one is so positive about the abuse towards to moms is probably some nonsense about mysogyny being super manly...
That's my only rational explanation for this without having breakfast
So, I've watched through most of Lindsay Ellis' video. Honestly, given I've always been a fan of her stuff, so already predisposed to supporting her side of things.
Still, can say...it certainly got...personal, at a certain point. Like, I've always been against twitter mobbing for a while now, but this was beyond egregious.
in all seriousness, I should have payed attention to local politics stuff but I spend half my time in Georgia so I only ever get political ads for Georgia and not much in my new home state
As the resident Florida, I apologize for that
if they're undercover, they are allowed to lie about that
actually thats kinda a myth
Btw, here's the rest of what he said after that
(I banned him personally, process be damned)
Similar story with me and FRBT...but way more fucked up on my part because I was a REAL aggro pos back then
Another mod is online rn, brought the whole thing to my attention, I'm thinking of just banning him on the spot for this shit, he's been on thin fucking ice for some time
He has a history of pissing people off for the hell of it (the Tarra guy)
Its just a server centered around my buddy Luka and his lowkey channel
This guy just happen to be a friend of his from the old server
yeah, I used to be a fan of Fatman until I found out he's a prick about anything other than RWBY
Raymond meanwhile is the guy who first introduced me to Symphogear...though that was via a rant on s1's ending.
Its a bunchh of the top RWBY critics
Fatmanfalling, Celtic Pheonix Productions (Raymond McNeill), British Ninja, and Sick Slick Productions (Tom Horan)
Its cool man
I met a lot of the mods here from Team FRBT's server way back when
Problem is the server owner is buddies with him, and keeps running to bat for him
Yeah

I mean, I say that, but can't really do anything without the ok from like a majority of other mods
Like, I've tried slapping him like 3 fucking times now
I'm a mod on that server

its not a good sign for healthy behavior in the long run
yeah, that paranoia you're describing is what concerns me the most about the situation here
Like, I don't know what else to say to this
listen, if you feel concerned with this girl going for someone else, than either confess or just stop giving a shit about it
just do it man. I've done this charade before, wanted to wait and wait and wait, but eventually I had to confess to how I felt, or else it wouldn't go anywhere
So, a couple things:
1.) "She most likely has a crush on me". Are you sure about that? If there's doubt, then, you need to clear that up. 
2.) Have you told her how you feel about her? Have you admitted your crush to her? If she doesn't know, then you shouldn't be so worried about her hanging with someone else.
I'm screenshoting all this and posting it in that channel for the sake of clarity

I see those names, I think, "There's no way in hell all of these guys would back this...surely its only something a handful of whackos would do"

OH GOD

<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
I'm going to bed
I hope when I get up in the morning his account is suspended.
Yeah...FUCK
Was he explicit about that?
I only now noticed the colors
I just looked
More content. Why was he upset about it? What does it compare with this other dude?
I am confused
Uhm..
Hope this guy doesn't give the server any unwanted traffic from this
Fucking transphobic Symphogear fans...
in all honesty, yeah, kinda did
A guy who rants about LGBT shit also being fan of a show with an all female ~~yuri~~ action show with trans characters treated with some modicum of respect as people
That's honestly the most shocking thing of this whole thing
I didn't even know it was possible to be this fucking toxic a person and yet also be a fan of Symphogear
Well, by his rules, he'd should get banned for posting the shit he is here, because there's nothing respectful about the shit he's been saying tweet #10 onwards
"Unpopular opinions voiced *respectfully*"
I'll admit, when he first started complaining about the black and LGBT people in his mentions, I started laughing
Then I started scrolling, and I've just been staring
Better than the more basic theory he's just a mentally unstable, socially starved jackass
good theory, honestly
Well, guess I'm going to try out Twitter's report function now
May be the first fan of the show I've run into who also happens to be a complete piece of shit
btw, he does at one point bring up that he's a Symphogear fan...https://i.imgur.com/osUBZK6.png
Yeah
Should I post the thread? I'm in the middle of scrolling through and reporting as much of this shit for harassment etc because jesus christ this is some of the most egregiously hateful shit I've ever had to witness an actual human being express
yeah guy in the screen cap
Yeah
So, some guy on twitter made a thread ranting about CR's translations for Nagataro, scroll through about ten threadtweets (what tf are you supposed to call em?) before he started to complain about the "Black/LGBT weebs" criticizing him. 
And now he's turned the thread into a trans shaming fest.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Jesus christ
Looks at Prelati and Cag
Pog
His account got suspended
Agreed
I kinda don't really want to like debate the translation thing here. Maybe in <#371105434771390465> or something that'd be more fitting. Was only point out my pov in the context of the egregious shit this man goes on
I will say, his original point ,the basic premise of it at least I kinda agree with. The Among Us reference I feel would date the sub needlessly.
But this guy took it, ran a mile with it, before dropping the ball and circumnavigating the glide with transphobia
Yeah, I imagine being involved in game development in a place like China is more stressing than in America, with the government breathing down your neck all the time
this is certainly a bruh moment

Thhat's the big issue you need to address rn
yeah
so...do you want to clarify any of that?
Second, about your issue with yaoi: I may not be all that into Yaoi male on male stuff isn't what I'm into, but I don't outright hate it or shut it off in my mind completely and "hate" it in a broad sense like you seem to, the way you've worded it. I know from all I've heard that there is a lot of abuse fetishism in the Yaoi genre, that I can understand being concerned whenever its brought up; but I have to assume there's some wholesome yaoi out there, just by statistics. So, having an outright hatred for the whole concept of "Japanese male romance" is a bit extreme to me. And there's your wording on IRL relationships but that's something I feel Lily raised plenty of concern about; again, assumption is your not being shitty, just struggle with wording what your meaning.
Reading back through your statements, there's a lot of very weird wording in here.
Lets start with what I assume is the start of this incident: you getting sent Yaoi on twitter. I know I've in the past (back when I was just getting over my anti-social behaviors and getting active online) I've forced my weird fanfic stuff on others without them wanting to hear about it; I entirely regret that shit and see why people would be upset with that, so I can kinda understand this situation your in from the other perspective...kinda, sorta. That said, you obviously have a bad relationship with these people, so I cannot glean from them really them as people beyond being shitty and obsessive. I can understand your frustration fully with these people, if they are like this
Hopefully I've broke down your situation correctly:
-Your following certain people from another Symphogear community who are spamming you on twitter about yaoi ("I got harshly forced by the fujoshis on the internet to see yaoi). 
-You complain about this, saying Yaoi isn't your thing, and feel like the stuff they are sending you contains some questionable shit
-For this, your harassed by the community and treated as homophobic
-you say you "hate" yaoi in general, but you are (kinda) ok with gay relationships irl (big pin in this one)
-You are considering seeing a therapist over these issues your having, though you know its unlikely with how you family operates to actually do that.
And just fyi Cecil, I doubt your a bad person, going to assume you just have trouble communicating sometimes. I can get that. I said some stupid shit in the past because I didn't properly consider what I was saying.
Yeah, I'm personally concerned of this myself. The wording you put to all that is very vague and broad, feel like there's something you don't want to tell us because it makes you look bad. Idk, I usually overexplain myself in situations like this, just to make sure there is no confusion or concern

I have issues with problematic stuff being brushed under the rug by a community, that I can understand
Yeah
Though I do know of some "loose" Indonesians
I don't want to be too harsh to her, given she was raised on this stuff in a very strict culture, it seems.
Thought he meant butt to butt rubbing...
Is it bad I laughed when I saw that phrase "butt rubbing"? That's just
..that's just something I never considered as a legit sex act. Like, I'd see characters on Cartoon Network shows (of less quality) do that and it's more treated like "oh, look at how whacky these two guys are"
That's just cultural barrier/cultural homophobia.
...ok, this explains a lot
The ship Tsubagawa and Genjuchris
Imagine them editing in new scenes of them hanging out with their "boyfriend's"
They edit in Maria in an adidas track suit and have her sing Eurobass
Maria is a Slav
Speaks flawless Japanese, never seems to have a problem to Japanese customs etc.
Fuck, there's loads of examples in the rest of the world of this
American culture gets criticized the most for it but it ain't an american thing
i mean, even if its because America bad and America imperialist, shouldn't apply to you as an Indonesian
My general attitude towards people gatekeeping stuff like this is to simply not give a shit.
its not the only server I'm on though, got two other servers of Friends of mine (one of whom is a Symphogear fan and a Chris-stan); and a bunch of servers for history stuff.
And then there's my own personal server where I pretty much save all my memes and fanart and stuff I collect
its a server for my friend and folks he hangs out with. Not something I'm really willing to invite you to, since these guys are pretty...on edge, lets say. 
Plus really isn't that active so, no point.
The banned Finnish guuy on my other server would find SOMETHING to complain about
based
Basquiat was a black artists from NYC back in the 80s, died young of drugs, beloved in the art world, mostly because his stuff is rare therefore expensive
it just dawned on me how weird this world has gotten from like ten years ago
I think if I saw someone say that phrase back in like 2011, I'd be very confused, or think it was a meaningless "wow look how wacky I am" phrase. 
But then incels happened.
who everyone uses as basically the Chad meme
this guy
we were not worthy of his prescence in this plane of existence
big sad
laughing man, no why
so is art, sometimes
right
this too
Honestly, I like that we are finally starting to shuffle out old suits and getting young blood into the progressive movement. Sanders is cool and all, but he's teetering on the edge of life at this point, people have to come in to take his place or else we got ourselves a sold-out Congress
the starbucks millineal lady who the media either fawns over or shits on constantly
Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez
got a commie friend who told me to vote trump this year to try and further the downfall of america so we can either put forth an actual leftwing Socialist party or outright revolution
So, there's one of those takes
probably wouldn't result in the more laisse faire, libertarianism behind the party
yup
And given how his views on race change in later life, and in comparison to the shit Wilson did, probably mean life's slightly better for black people than it was historically
Probably would have gotten involved in WW1 earlier, probably would have resulted in Germany collapsing earlier, probably would have prevented Russia from totally collapsing in 1917 like it did (maybe the Kerensky government stays around). Could push through a bunch of super socialist reforms, generally less of a black mark towards socialism in general
tfw your a lost cause supporter whose work is quoted directly in the most infamous American movie ever made, which you screen in the white house
But yeah, I agree with Cypher and Cody: Teddy should have got 3rd term in 1912
Means we wouldn't have the shit foreign policy of Wilson staining us to this day
Tbf, the Clintons also backed Don't Ask Don't Tell
...and Epstein
he was buddy buddies with the Clintons in those days...
eh,probably
Trump was pretty left wing back then, actively denouncing Pat Buchanan's bullshit. Wish we had that trump today instead of what we got in 2016
pretty based tbh
maybe not disbanding the partties entirely. I imagine they'll reform under new names. Just make them drop the old names and iconography and stuff, and so they can't call back on what the party did in the past to bolster their bullshit
the flip was a lott slower, Georgia remained conservative democrat until the late 90s, the last dem governor flipflopping over the issue of the state flag (Georgia remade the state flag in the 60s with the AoNV banner, aka "the Confederate flag") and other general race baiting stuff
oversimplification, but yeah
alt suggestion: Disband the Democrat/Republican parties
At least they should not be allowed to call upon "historical precedent" to mask their bs, like how the Republicans keep pulling shit of how they were the ones who freed the slaves and democrats were the proslave party, shit like that.
Also, they only wanted a small army, and only wanted rich white men to vote
the people who invoke this shit usually are evangelicals who never realized that the founders were mostly deists who believed in religious plurality
So actual politics can happen instead of "me Republican, me no support democrat bill, even tho it wold help my constituents"
wished we had preference voting over first past the post, or something more condusive to multi-party system
agreed
message the school, ask if their track is open for public use, or if you can get permission to use it
so, public schools, which is what I see most common, are in the name, public. So the local community owns the school, kinda.
and some complicated stuff in between but I don't understant that so I'm ignoring it
because in the US there's public schools and private schools
depends on the school
military strategy reasons?
And you can be interested in the Civil War without also being into lost cause bullshit
Because I'm interested in the subject (?)
and then there's the Civil War-centric servers I'm on...boy do I come across some fucking wackos there
yeah, he was very very cringe
oh thta guy
Which one?
still, the way he's arguing sounds like he's 15 and just watched some crazy dude's video on youtube and has not the ability to think critically of what he's being told by an adult with some editting skills
tbh, I was like not even 2 when it happened, so I had no idea about it until I was in 2nd grade really
yeah
this guy says he was too young to be there when it happened, so I get the feeling he's very underaged
Like...this is some dumb shit
Completely ignoring that the footage he's looking at is just from different angles and that different news stations have different cameras in use
this guy is trying to argue that, because the footage from the different news stations covering the event were slightly different, therefore it didn't happen
Yeah
like he's still trying to argue why he's right about the Chauvin conviction being a bad thing...somehow...
And don't harass the server owner begging to come back in
yeah
so, guy on a server in which I DONT have mod roles in is pulling some 9/11 truther shit rn
Also, last night, found out that finnish Dude I banned is spamming the server host about letting him back in, and has been doing so for the past week. 
My fucking day...
I would donate but I'm broke rn
#ACAB
indeed, he does look like Jimmy Saville's lowkey brother
like...he doesn't realize the Daily Mail has been tabloid media for decades?

oh yeah, Blair, the guy who cut out the Labour aspect of Labour
The Scottish political scene sounds to me like some of the most toxic shit ever
the first 6 words of that sentence is just true in general
~~luckily~~, I am not bri'ish, so I can't vote in this
fuck how did i miss this
but yeah, two people I immediately imagine making a response to this is J. J. (because Canada thing), and...Count Dankula (because libertarianism)
Canadian youtuber/political commentator, really great content, good at explaining to a layman with no context whatever is happening in Canada
Can't wait for J. J. McCullough to make a video on this...
One good thing about lockdown, stupid mass events like this are way less likely to happen
Yeah
I never touch tumblr so I wouldn't have known myself without a quick google
yeah
I usually recommend posting in say <#407060923078017026> for stuff like this, thats uusally where I post miscellanous stuff I don't think is important enough for this channel
I'm guessing you heard it brought up there
its some sort of Tumblr-based subculture thing.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_academia
I get that. and I know a lot of people don't
I'm guessing your bringing this up because he's one of the few irl examples of a gay man to you? Was he played up in the media a lot?
but I get the feeling Cecil isn't exactly one of those from the wording. 
To give the best faith interpretation of this situation I can for Cecil: I believe your experiencing a crisis of faith. There are two beliefs of yours being challenged, your belief in Catholicism and your belief in LGBT+ stuff. I've grown up in a household where religion was a thing but it wasn't a solid element of my life, so I can't say I have the right experience behind me to tell you the answer to your problem here.
there are "Good king, bad court" types in this as well. I presume they exist in the Catholic church as well
Certainly
But the Catholic Church...its much more integrated with the belief system of its practicioners than the protestents do
i will say though, you are treating it like its just another protestent denomination, where one can seperate one's personal belief from the church doctrine (the whole idea of "protestent" denominations, like Baptists and Methodists here where I live in the South US, being the seperation from an overarching authority, and personal interpretations of the bible).
yes
No, like Catholicism in particular
but anyways, yeah, I can understand reporting it, because yeah, it would be a tos break
at same time though, I'm guessing the community isn't behind that whole no nsfw rule, hence why they are still posting without tags. I'm guessing the people on the site would be more upset with that act than you trying to clarify your stance on gay people, because there's a phrase, "action is louder than words".
ignorance, obvious sign of a fed /s
twitch is optional for me
honestly, there are other sites to use other than tumblr, I recommend completely getting off of the platform if its causing you so much trouble
Yeah, I remember you talking about that a bit back
I wonder how many people from that school who remember that shit at all and are gonna call me out on twitter when i become the big celebrity the ego ass I am believes I'll be
yeah, distinctly remember smacking up kids on the bus with my (fabric) lunch box after they told me they were gay, and mostly that was a rise to get me to do it because EVERYONE on the bus knew I was a homophobe
will say, this conversation seems so surreal to me, as about a decade ago, I used to be my middle school's homophobic bully. the fact that that wasn't even a full 10 years ago just stunned me.
I heard a while back Schindler's List is banned in Indonesia because it was "too sympathetic to the Jewish cause". 
Not exactly the subject but I can understand why LGBT-positive media would be difficult to get one's hands on if the government bans a historical movie about a people being genocided because it hates that the depiction of those suffering in a "too symphathtic" light
Yeah Armis put it more clearly
I always try my best to discern whether someone is a good person or not, not based on their gender, race, or sexuality.
Here's the way to think about it:
How often to you hear about straight male serial killers preying on women? It happens a lot. Does that mean there's a problem with emphathizing with straight men in general? Not all straight men are serial killers. And by extention, not all gay men are like this guy. He's an outlier.
ok
ok...so why exactly are you bringing him up a lot? Is it reinforcing an old stereotype you've been taught to believe, or believed unconciously about gay people?
I assume when she wakes up her GF will contact the server to let them know whats up.
ok
Like, she must have other people still friended so they can dm her
Is anyone still in conteact?
Fuck
...
she's obviously dealing with inner turmoil, which she's chosing to take out on the server in an unhealthy manner. She needs to come to grips with how her behavior is hurtful, regardless of her context
I concur with Melua
Sounds like paranoia to me.

But racism is definitely a thing
Here's the problem with it though
Race may not be a thing, and we should as a culture be fighting against that grain
Again, I get that
I do agree with Morgan on this, in the end, skin color changes nothing about a person mentally or physically. Dividing people by race is this very stupid and unscientific.
However, just because I don't believe race exist doesn't mean other people don't believe race exists. If enough people lie to themselves to think it's real, it is real and can't be ignored.
Maybe in a hundred years racism and racialization is a thing of the past, but right now, that's really not the case
but...I imagine that'd be a bit extreme
are they compensating you properly? If they aren't you could pull "an unsafe working environment" to bring up legal stuff
considered talking to HR about this?
where do you live btw?
is that late capitalist bullshit
wtf
mandatory 60h
fuck
but yeah, have a hug Matt <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I know I've had falling outs with friends groups many times in the past. Mostly because whenever I did something wrong I'd always get defensive about it and I'd get vindictive and petty about things. One of the few parts of myself I feel I've learned to overcome, rather than just acknowledge it and do nothing about it.
Idk, I guess I'm saying I can understand why something like this is happening, but at the same time, from what youve told us about the situation, I know there's no way it can be a one for one, like how she just been a stable and calm person up until one day when she came out and "turned", I'm guessing there was no hint of this, whereas if I scanned through the logs of my chats back on the old servers I could tell immediately there was an issue with my general behavior long before I got into trouble.
Or she'll let someone know herself
maybe it was because the part of Georgia I was living in was super gentrified
Yeah, where I grew up in a suburb north of Atlanta, I feel like there were more Indians (South East Asians) than black people at my school, at least from what it felt like
waitt what did Morgan do?
Eh...
Yeah
Go up to a BLM protest and preach about race not being a thing. Wrong time, wrong place, wrong people.
And that is because of subconscious racism in America's police system
Like, there's a reason people with black skin are more likely to get shot by police
A part of me assumed that was meant like you personally believed it but
Ok
first of all, just...how?
So, that claim about Asians having "a lot of claim to the entirity of the world" thing
Partly blame the Gilded Age corruption and detachment for this, though we still had folks like Teddy come around
Elites in this country are way less likely to put themselves in danger for anything they push for
I wish we had folks like Leo Ryan around today
I get the feeling people root for biden because he's a maliable tool for folks on the more progressive wing of the party, rather than a man with any solid convictions on anything he speaks about
Biden
Didn't he launch a drone strike back in the first month?
Oh yeah
Also the weird stuff of him around kids even the Daily Show made fun of back when
meanwhile, North Korea be rping as 1930s-40s Japan
luckily those nations have stopped with the divinity bullcrap, for the most parts
and its a lot easier to convince people to die for you and do absolutely awful shit in your name as well
just saying my personal beliefs on the broaders subject
not trying to discount that
right
I do not believe in any ideas of "claim", that somehow a nation has a right to own a certain piece of land for whatever reason. I believe its an entirely artificial idea used as an excuse to use force on others
yee
But yeah
There is no fixing the system...only revolution...
...
Why is this posted here btw?
Tf
Not following British Politics, what did Starmer say that upset people?
Yeah, SNP may be the establishment now
But they ain't gonna get everyone to want to secede, knowing that Scotland would be under THEIR leadership.
Then again, won't happen given the current atmosphere, given how...well, shitty the SNP has been recently
Probably the most ironic independence campaign for both sides
Well...someone posted footage of shit going down
Spoilering for CW, possible deaths
dont forget: Israel got nukes
If anyone actually threatened its existance, specifically its neighbors, doubt they wouldn't use them
funny thing was, Trump had been extremely pro-Israel, recoginzing Jerusalem as defacto capital of Israel and shit.
Shit like this and Yugoslavia, Haiti, Congo, etc, are why my opinion and presumably the opinion of others on the UN is so fucking low
like, we trashed Iraq, 5th largest army in the world, but they were a dysfunctional arab state with no natural defenses
And considering the US army's track record since WW2, and arguably Korea...yeah, not a lot of W's
and not even just "we aren't gonna support you on this" turn against, more like, the US would have to send troops on the ground to fight Israel for them to lose
The only way Israel loses is if the US turns against it
Yeah
like, the Suez Crisis I think is the only time they "failed"...and only because of diplomatic intervention
like, every full war Israel has fought with arab powers it won hands down on the battlefield
yeah
(Even though Ataturk was complicit in late stage Armenian Genoocide, not based)
Erdogan cringe, Ataturk based
yeah, 
citing religious reasons for wanting to owning Palestine is null, if you wish to discount the other religion's religious reasons for wanting to own palestine
no, was saying Israel-Wyoming would get US support
that they were eyeing places in africa, aparently even Madagaskar
I know that before they settled on Palestine
thats my stupid hottake of themonth
Personal opinion: I think a Jewish state should exist, but shouldn't have been Israel
Like, the US has a bunch of rectangular, useless states with no population that could accomadate an Israeli-scale Jewish state
My suggestion would be to give up on the idea that Israel/Palestine belongs to Jewish people, give them a new homeland, build a third temple in Wyoming or wherever. 
Then the Palestinians can live in peace, the jews still get an independent nation, they can get easy support from the US and won't have to deal with any substantial local populace which doesn't want to lose their homes.
i remember them because i think Roger Waters was associated with them
oh them
I am so confused
religious war is stupid, thinking you have the "right" to a land is stupid
And yet, your lives are endangered because a lot of people believe that shit, and many of those people have guns and missles at their disposal
like, I know its hot topic and all, but there's people on this seerver whose lives are actually endangered, for honestly stupid fucking reasons imo.
agreed honeslty
anyways yeah
<@!279341087494242304> <@!476058996315389953> take care. I might not agree with you on some of the stuff said, but that's meaningless talk compared to your lives, which are in danger.
So, stay safe, hope you get through this.  <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>

Imagine trying to diss on some one for their race
he just left the server before we could ban him
Like the fucking holocaust "skeptic", he vetoed banning since he apologized, though in hindsight given a second look at his apology it was a non-one
also the server owner is a super lenient dude, kept coming to bat for this dude and others I've banned
entertainment
Guy has been dm'ing the server owner for the last 14 fucking days with this shit
Speaking of crazy fucking dms:
So, a few weeks back I mentioned here I had banned a dude from a server I moderate after posting about George Floyd conspiracy bullshit, as well as all the previous bullshit he's spouted over the year the server has been around
tf
I mean, yes, its grain counting for empires built on conquest and subjugation, all of them are inherintly evil 
However, doesn't mean that we can't look at them on a bellcurve and think to ourselves "If I was unlucky to be born in this time, in what area do I live in that will result in me being the LEAST fucked"
and even then, I doubt a place like Brazil would somehow end up in the control of the Ottomans, no matter what one shows me in their EU4 playthrough
certainly
like, took a course on Spanish colonialism, some brutal shit to say the least
One Empire worse than Britain and Ottomans as the same time they all existed
but its like 1 genocide versus the plural ones committed by the British in places like India, Africa, and even in the Proto-US
like, they committed the Armenian Genocide, as did Turkey (which I consider those two nations two seperate entities)
Yeah
ottomans were probably the lesser evil of the European/Medditeranean sphere
yeah
fucking Anglos
so now they're looking at the actual root of the issue: shitty people with power
hating each other got them nowhere
i mean
just my experience on the subject
Like, reading on the Civil War, there's a lot of grognards on both sides complaining how poor men are drafted into the army while the rich folks can just pay a fee and not march off to suffer
age old adage, even before Sartre lived
is this refering to the blackmailer shit?
I don't know why you'd ask that here
Fancontent
It's not that hard, there is not any traffic on it these days
Thing is, the guy is barely online anymore due to NG stuff he's doing, so I doubt he's fully aware of the crap I have to deal with from these people
He's one of those "free speech" guys, very hardline about not punishing people unless they go TOO far, which was a very high bar he set
when we found out the Chemical weapons thing was bullshit, our government immediately turned to "They were helping Al Quada", which they weren't
And all we did was destabilize the region enough for Al Quada to actually form a presence in the region, starting a stupid decade long war that morphed when Al Quada was surplanted by Isis
well, acting out an Eye for an Eye makes the world go blind
And our leaders used the specter of their threat to invade Iraq for no other reason than ~~Oil~~ Chemical weapons
9/11 happened on US soil by terrorists similar to Hamas. Al Quada wanted to destroy America as much as Hamas wants to destroy Israel
I really want to question the logic here: Lets say, this same accusations of attacks on civilian targets is made about the US military in Afghanistan, or Iraq or whatever other country we decided to ruin. Should I take it as a personal attack on me and my people if someone criticized the actions of our government and military, which I actively despise in general?
I just feel you assuming criticism of the actions of your military, under orders from people like Netanyahu who you have criticized, is a personal attack on you and israel's character, as a little, well, deluded.
I got one too, but I'll let you go first
violence begets violence begets violence. More violence leads to more violence to more violence.
so you blow up a room full of 20 people to kill the person who attacked you, whether or not they were involved with them?
Kirponos commanding in Ukraine only did so well because he actively ignored stalin's orders and mobilized his forces in preparation for the attack 
Didn't stop them, but he made it a pain for Rundstedt to advance
the Nazis mostly
so he avoided antagonizing them
his strat required neither of them attacking him
yup
And thus is why Barbarossa resulted in such high soviet casualties
like, Stalin was going out of his way to avoid conflict in the west, especially with Hitler
On the eve of barbarossa, even with all his intellegence agencies and any sensible person telling him hitler was gonna invade, Stalin ordered his forces to stand down, because he didn't want to "threaten" the Nazis

Turkey (specifically Erdogan) can go fuck itself if they play UN here
*I don't understand your weeb shit*
Kim Il sung
and the nazi heirarchy was utterly dysfunctional and full of drug addicts like Goring and delusional sociopaths like Himmler, and a significant part of the high command is trying to kill their leader
Like, Soviet Union was shit, one of the worst empires in human history, Communism doesn't work out EVER, etc, we all know this
But this doesn't mean we should push shit like "At least the nazis were well organized" or "At least Mussolini kept the trains running on time", when both statements are factually fucking untrue
Oh, and should note: 
A lot of the Nazi generals like Keital claimed in their trials how their invasion of the Soviets was a "preemptive strike" because the Soviets were totally about to invade..when it turned out the Soviet high command had no intention of such.
So these fuckers are actually pushing lowkey Nazi propaganda to push their point that "Commmunism evil" in comparison to fucking Hitler
Nazis had a history of aggressive foreign policy Stalin just did not have before Hitler comes to power
yeah
He tried to coup Austria in 34, reintegrated the Rhineland in 36, annexed Austria in early 38, got handed the Sudetenland in late 38, took the rest of Chezkoslovakia early 39, all before he entered Poland
a little bit of him, a little bit from the military juntas formed int he country
where Germany was still supplying the Chinese army with training up to the start of the Sino-Japanese War, and Japan refused to invade Russia from the east during Barb
oh yeah, that meem
Did the Soviet's contribute to the tensions that led to the conflict? In some ways yes, through merely existing as a boogeyman they made right wingers in the west fearful of Communist rule so they turn to folks like Hitler to crush them
Like, Hitler was the guy who got the ball rolling on the war
yes
btww, should note, that description thing I posted, thats from an organziation from the 50s that exists to shill for the republicans and making Communism look as bad as possible, regardless of anything getting in the way like...reality
I mean, are you talking about the monsters killing babies part or the giving the 10 minute warnings part?
Because if you mean the former, like, the Japanese did that shit in China on a shockingly regular basis, same deal with the Nazis
For the latter, Can't think of a more lenient policy for a military off the top of my head, maybe there was some US mil policy in Iraq/Afghanistan that was quite lenient, need to do more research

yeah...not sure if this guy is trying to cause harm or not.

think the problem is, he's a lowkey youtuber, has his server linked on his videos and twitter account, I think that it will enter through there anyway
I think he's trying that.

The WP article says the concern of the DoJ is that Conservative organizations would move in to support the case of the Schools...to which I say, ok, they can take the L, the DoJ shouldnt be actively defending bigotry
If that were the case why tf did the DoJ say it would "vigorously defend" the exemption? If their concern was warrentted, that the DoJ would stand against them...then the DoJ is needlessly alienating the LGBT community to placate them

I mean, I had little to no respect for the Republicans once I got into politics seriously; but at the same time, the Democrats as is is a joke to me, where the establishment flaunts about being the party of change whilst constantly undermining the people in the party who genuinely want change and compromising wiht the conservative elements of the party too fucking often

I think the problem is she is gonna wash down in THOSE parts, which I imagine is making her very aware of them being, well, "wrong"
To give a more substantial advice, think about it like this: you may not like your body as it is now. Howeverz it's the body that you inhabit right now. When you eventually (hopefully if that is what you desire) transition, they'll need your old body to be nice and healthy so it can be transitioned. So, take a shower, keep it clean. Gotta do what you gotta do.
I'd say "push through it for now". But that's from a cis male who doesn't know what it's like to have gender dysphoria

Reading that article, apparently, this case was brought to public knowledge because the company was being sued for some other shit they were doing (don't think it was specified what that was), and this case was brought up with the name of the woman redacted.

I mean...at least he isn't publishing a terf manifesto...
I guess this is another case of "Thank god I never got involved in these big franchises that turned out to be massive rabbit holes of shitty people"
So, basically a more lowkey version of Joanne Rowling?
Yeah
This wasn't Cawthorn himself? Was it just some random fan on reddit?

Hope i can sleep this shit off.
Well, I say that, I've been having them for the last 3 freaking years until a couple months into the new year, when I decided to cut back on the college grind and take a break for the summer and fall this year. I've been generally positive since, mostly been having the normal "I'd love to see my cool stories with my cool ocs get a tv series after i catscan my brainwaves onto a computer and have it all written out like that instead of actually writing it out" fantasies. 
But tonight (probably because I stayed up late with my buddies watching a show...but I've done that several times before?), nope, time to actually suffer
Idk, does anyone else have weird phantasies where you see your life play out, but its not in the "oh I'd love to be able to fly and hang out with my favorite waifus and shit" deal, its the "how can my entire life go to shit before my eyes" kinda fantasies?
I get that shit all the fucking time.
So, its seems after about 6 months of general positivity, I think I may be slipping back into depression again...fuck...

Anyway, I'll say, I used to back some of those right wing guys who kept complaining about "being purged by the system" until I saw some of their videos became ad videos on YouTube...
Well...I missed a conversation...or a billion

id say yeah, the European colonialism stuff, under the Germans and the Belgians (aka, the two WORST countries to be colonized by, by fucking far), is what really solidified the Hutu-Tutsi divide with scientific racism, when it was more of a social class thing prior.
Huh, looking at articles, so this started back in February, thought it was more recent
Yasukuni shrine is for Japan's military dead (iirc) and also is associated with the Second World War and the atrocities committed by the Japanese against the Chinese, Americans, etc.
Yeah
Wait what why?
I didn't know about it until he stopped with the regular uploads...and released "apology" videos I either didn't watched because I never heard anything for me to care about...
And then people made videos that got into my recommended feed, I think Prison Mate Luke was the guy I kept seeing making videos about it
gaming Youtuber, used to hangout with Vanoss and Terrorizer and Wildcat and such
Turned out to be a jackass...and  then people found out he sexted a 17 yo

I just realized...I'm still subbed to one of miniladd's channels....
I have a friend whose a fic writer whose main character is obsessed with Dr. Pepper (and is named Dr. Pepper), even though he's set in RWBY-verse where Dr. Pepper doesn't exist. 
Not that but closest thing I know of
I feel like its either because its harder to follow an acronym after a certain number of letters, or people keep putting out different conflicting versions that its hard to follow
Yeah
After that its too hard to remember
I only understood the acronym up to LGBTQ...
yup
Even if its played up by "conservative propaganda", maybe making a movie involving underaged kids twerking and involving themselves in psuedo-erotic stuff ISNT the best way to push and promote this movie in the way Netflix did (which imo only seemed to pander to crazy conservatives looking for their "first its the gays, then the pedos" shit to come through)
Trump has nothing to do with the problems I and many other people I know have with this film. I never even knew there was a rally at the time, what did that have to do with anything?
...yeah, I kinda agree with this, in cases like this where they just slap a label on it and pass it off and market it to the community like this. 
They try to appeal to the LGBT audience so much (and fails at that too), its almost unapproachable for straight people, unless they want to be REALLY SUPPORTIVE of the communitty and that content. Like, it looks like an old school saturday morning cartoon; but would the average kid want to watch this? I doubt it.
plus given all the shit he did down in Central America, he's gotten away with a lot of shit he shouldn't have
yeah
either this was him doing it to fuck with people, or he did get Epstein'd
but yeah, suspisious
Tbh, McAfee isn't the...best human being
Yeah
oh that thing we were talking about at the beginning? FOrgot th name
I assumed he's talking about some misguided LGBT rep group that called themselves F-slur Force
I think we know what the F stood for but not what the heck is F Force
And thats some shit I DIDN'T learn from school
In high school, when talking about the Western expansion, our professor went over the Indian Wars and the fuckery with all that. But I get the feeling other teachers gloss over the shit Americans did to the Indians. I doubt the education system wants to address the fact that Hitler read up on the American Westward Expansion and saw that as a perfect example for his "Lebensraum" crap that got tens of millions of Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, and other minorities or "undesirable races" that his war machine decided to kill to make room for German settlement.
I mean, yeah, the whole convo on Twitter was also arguing over coverups vs avoidance of discussion. Like, if your High School history class talks about World War 2, but doesn't mentions the Holocaust. Like, they ain't covering it up, but that doesn't mean they are imprinting something negative by just not covering it
Systemic issues? Nah, we got over those.
American Education system
I mean...it got ignored for a long while up until recently
Oh yeah, that time when President Hoover ordered MacArthur and Patton to shoot World War 1 Veterans for demanding their compensation for their service
Corporations yall
And because of that, twitter didn't show me that first, but the rewtweet of a nobody i do not know or follow, obviously an edgy kid trolling, just going "Lmao, there was no massacre, you made it up"
It was more because he retweeted a guy i was following who was tweeting about the Tulsa Massacre during a discussion about covered up atrocities in American history
Also, love looking at my feed and seeing a guy retweet a piece about the Tulsa massacre and just state "Lmao didn't happen". Love twitter

I remember seeing just that image posted in another server and I swore it had to be some ironic joke

The fuck is Thule?
the reason they bothered drafting it was because a bunch of poor veteran farmers in Massachusetts started a rebellion
yeah pretty much
Like, if say a trans ban bill passed with just over a 50% majority required, if it got vetoed, then itd go back to the congress (state/federal) and would require a higher percentage, either 2/3 or 75%
American Politics is very dumb
Isn't the big issue now that cis men don't want to date trans people?
I wish I could help but my track record with irl friend groups, especially of my peers and people going through stuff like this, is quite problematic. 
I reluctantly suggest you cut ties with her if she continues to hold her attitude like this. Don't judge her based on the fact she's trans. Judge her on how she acts as a friend.
these people have been giving the earth a Pacific Rimjob for decades
"Suspiciously well written"
Didnt intend to start an argument. Should have known better than to bring it up
Similarities I feel is a bit too week to describe the heinous shit Hitler did as well as the national/cultural policy of the US from the 1800s to around the mid-20th century, but yeah
Well, on the one hand, yeah, Hitler faced much more consolidated opposition than the Americans did (which just goes to show how fucked the situation in the 1800s was). Still, it did serve to justify his plans to exterminate "undesirables" from the lands he conquered to make way for German settlement and exploitation.
Hitler had plenty of evidence at his disposal to show his racist plans for world conquesst and mass genocide will in the end result in success
And then in the early 1900s, we started sterilizing minorities in those same regions to try and make them more white
America fought a series of bloody wars, often exterminating entire tribes of natives by slaughter, starvation, deportation, etc. And thus we get access on both the PAcific and Atlantic coast, large population densities in places like Texas and California
The borders of the US and the population difference between the native tribes today and the modern population shows that
I mean, we literally did employ Lebensraum. We just called it a different name
Only thing I could think up for how you can do a "good Job" of that (aside from NOT going out stealing land) is to be Italy and just lose spectacularly and have the world laugh at you for generations
Like, how do you do a "good job" when you believe you are entitled to own basically the entire continent for no other justification than "We just can"
Since its now longer "America Awesome" Day, I'd like to remind everyone Hitler cited American Western Expansion against the Amerindians as his example that Lebensraum would work
I think there's a term for this:
Genocide
this says so much

(my ignorance of the industry shows)
wait, Ufotable has cafes?
Was asking if they were at least using that money they didn't pay the government with to actually pay their employees, the average animators, in a really shitty industry for such stuff. 
Like, as much as they're guilty of national money shit, it sucks to think two of the few Anime studios that actually does their employees right get punished (this and Kyoto)
weren't they also one of the few actually well paying studios though (because of the tax evasion)? Thats what I've heard at least

Britain is better off as Airstrip One
you guys are indeed quite based
I mean, yall have been calling it Terf Island for months now
Think that's what its called in some of the Arthur legendds
Albion is an old name for Britain.
The US used to hate Britain, and when the World Wars came around, people thought they'd just use their colonial troops and allies to fight and die for them. Joke during the Napoleonic War being "Britain will fight Napoleon to the last Austrian".
I love how in the last 5 years people have finally turned against Perfidious Albion
but that was ye old times. 
We got video games these days, you can watch anime online, you can use various machines to jerk yourself off with
Why get so mad over a game that you commit hate crimes?
All I can say rn about the England situation:
Perfidious Albion: Always has been, always will be
note how none of these say "minorities harassed due to players being blamed for losing the game"
/s
for one, it is simultaneously more manly AND homoerotic
because none of you guys can play REAL uncringe footbal
i mean, people talk shit around it...but name an instance where people went out and harassed black people on the streets after they lose a game
Like, we don't have the same history of hooliganism as the brits do with their soccer
I mean, American Football the last few years hasn't made the country angry enough to commit straight up race crimes
"We don't know what's in there. It could be dangerous for kids! Think of the children!
Because they got to push the narrative
I just see my rightie "friends" post shit about it and ignore dealing with it out of principle
tbh, I've not watched this, so I am talking from ignorance when i shouldn't
Will say, while Q can go fuck 'emsevles for being Q and making fake pedophilia allegations and death threats and shit...that doesn't mean I don't take issue with the "we're coming for your kids" line. Like, that's been the dogwhistle for these folks since the time Trump came into office, should have known better and been more careful with the lyrics they've put in their song.
I expected as such
"The gays are gonna take your kids. Might as well let polio take them instead"

It never said Swaziland in the tweet. I'm guessing Manzini is the capital
And I'm the kinda kid who'd read through an Atlas book and memorize the names of every country. 
Not as good as I was then but still
Never heard of that country

Like, I knew he was an edgelord...but I think that just made me finally reevalutate that friendship
gave up on a friend just now after he bragged about posting transphobic memes in a server run by a trans youtuber
Of course its over the Israel-Palestine shit...
like, that was my guess when the tweet above said that the party was dealing with "antisemetic cases"
I remember it being a big deal back when that shit went down
There was this mural that got retweeted during Corbyn's last campaign by either the Party's twitter account or another MP which contained a lot of blatant antisemetic imagery
Is this because of the mural rt back during the last election with Corbyn or is it more than that
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Translation?
yeah
LBJ's great society?
The democrats abandoned the Dixiecrats in the mid 60s, and the Republicans slowly encroached into the region with the Southern Strategy
At this rate, bar actual revolution, neither party will die out, just adapt with the times
due to the party post-60s adopting Neo-Liberalism instead of the New Deal State Capitalism which had defined them...due primarilly to the rise of the New Left and backlash against the administration of LBJ...
I could go on about the Progressive Revolution of the early 1900s/1910s, the New Deal policies giving the black communities more employment oppurtunities, the Dixiecrat split, etc, etc, etc
On the "Democrats = Original Klan" shit :the two parties have performed the Ship of Theseus Thought Experiment and slowly replaced their party platforms over the years; and the fact that the parties are all split into subfactions and some of those have won out over the years; see: the Republicans had a strong anti-immigrant policy towards the Irish (a forerunner of the Anti-Immigrant rhetoric they tought today) while even before the war the Democrats appealed towards Irish voters, which is why the party survived the Civil War as a viable political party.
Sorry for the splerg, Civil War stuff is my bread and butter
They came back in 1910 (their first meeting occured on Stone Mountain, Georgia, where my grandfolks currently live), and they exploded into the public consciousness with the release of Birth of A Nation, one of the most despicable films ever made, due to the fact it justified and glorified the KKK's actions against black people because it depicted black men as terrifying rapists of white women. 
It exploded across the US, the largest chapters being in Indiana. They had marches in the 1920s across the US, including in the Capitol
President Grant cracked down on them hard (one of the only upsides of his presidency), and they were disbanded around 1869 (their leader at the time was Nathan Bedford Forrest, former slave merchant and cavalry general in the war responsible for the fort Pillow Massacre; one of the most horrifying figures in American history, and he's considered one of the "Heroes" of the Lost Cause mythos).
They formed immediately following the civil war, made up almost entirely of working class whites in the south, common soldiers and such for the Confederacy, and constantly harassed blacks in the south, who had recently gained freedom and rights, to preventing them from doing stuff like vote or run for office or whatever they were uncomfortable with their former slaves doing
KKK formed about 50 years before the Nazi party existed. Calling them a neo nazi group is inaccurate. 
Racially motivated terrorist organization is more apt

i wish I had the mental energy to summarize his points, but he made a five fucking hour video on the subject and i got half way at best, tired as fuck today due to work on top of that, and really don't want to bog myself back down in this shit.
I do not endorse this btw, to be clear. He has some decent arguments but mixed in with references to Sargon and PragerU
From the discussion in <#407060923078017026> , here is the full 5 hour video TIK made about how Hitler was a socialist.https://youtu.be/eCkyWBPaTC8

*raises hand*
I should have read the information stuff my mom sent me, was expecting overheating, not underheating
yeah
I'm experiencing really bad chills rn. Think its because of the Johnson&Johnson vax I got yesterday. I can feel heat congregating in my face while my arms and legs are fucking shivering. Hate this
The irony...I crave death...
God, the comics industry is just filled with edgelords
i was gonna add that he was behind a proposed story called "The ||Rape|| of Wonder Woman", but it seems I got him confused with Mark Millar (both of them are edgeboys with the same sounding last name so easy to forget)
I've watched too much fucking Linkara videos back in the day to consider this man any more objectively than that
this was until he started writing Holy Terror as a Batman special for DC. It was meant as a spoof of the WW2 comics set in the then current climate of the War on Terror; questionable decision by higher ups, yeah, but they got upset when Frank took the matter seriously and started spouting shit in interviews about how awful Islam and Arab people are and how barbaric and primitive they were and shit, and they kicked him from DC. This fucker didn't take the hint, and so he rewrote it (barely) with OCs that were basically filler for Batman and Catwoman with their names changed and looks slightly altered, and release it independently.
of course, after the success of DKR, he was encouraged to write more stories where he felt freer to express his views
hence is why he was considered a big deal in the industry
basically he was at the forefront of the new wave of celebrity comic creators like Grant Morrison and Alan Moore, plus defining the late 80s-90s generation of comics taking on darker themes and such.
(should note, not only is he an islamophobic pos, as well as a man unable to write a female character who isnt a prostitute, but everything he draws after DKR is an affront to they eyes)
here's a panel
yeah
he's probably more well known now for his independent comics like Sin City and 300...and Holy Terror, which may be the most morally repugnant major comic story ever made
i mean, he got famous off batman, but mostly because of the Dark Knight Returns, which may just be the one objectively good work of his because it has the least of his bizarre hangups involved
Ok, I'm reading more of this shitty article, I think we all need collective brain rot so here yall go: http://www.tampadispatch.com/comic-book-creator-frank-miller-cancels-convention-appearance-after-shortboxs-zainab-akhtar-starts-boycott-with-hollow-swj-accusations/
Also they mispell "SJW" in their subtitle as "SWJ"
Was researching and found this very cringe article by some paper called the Tampa Dispatch (which I have never heard about before just now) that first refers to Zainab in the main text of the article and the people speaking out against Frank Millers' appearance as "Marxist social justice warrior[s]", so...yeah, that's the people we deal with
So, it seems that theres some fuss over Frank Miller and some convention called Thought Bubble 
Apparently (from what I've gathered thus far), he got announced as a guest speaker at a convention for November; people got upset because, well, he's Frank Miller, guy gives you a million reasons to hate him; they were slow to do so; eventually a creator named Zainab spoke out about it (or did so on the behest of Thought Bubble because they were too scared to do it without some show about it), which caused some harassment towards her, apparently (still reading); apparently that got Thought Bubble to annouce they'd drop Frank Miller; and now a lot of anti-sjw/cancel culture is marxist postmodern conspiracy to destroy the world folk are upset. 
Did I get this right? I will say, as much as I generally don't support "cancel culture" stuff, Frank Miller's one of those people I have under 5% empathy for, considering some of the shit he's wrote and said.

What do you think the Pinkertons got big off of in the late 1800s?
Basically, police are allowed to stop and search random people (Bloomberg in the tapes specified the targets as young minority males) for weapons or drugs. This has resulted in many incidents where black men are killed by said cops
I mean, he was behind stop n frisk in New York, and actively defended the policy so...yeah, I wouldn't call him human
You mean the recent lore reveal story stuff or the sexual harassment bullshit?
This is quite dumb and awful and iffy already
...plz
Like wow
I feel I need even more context than this because Jesus this sounds awful
yeah
YAY legal action wait what GoFundMe?
According from my friend, someone sent him audio of...that...
lets get back to Chris-Chan|| turning out to be an incestous rapist||
Yeah
yeah
Kanye got famous because he was one of JayZ's production crew
Have you heard of Kanye? Beyonce? Lil Wayne? Dr. Dre? Kendrick Lamar? Drake?
Like, I don't listen to his music much but I know him from cultural ubiquity
He's a REALLY major dude in modern entertainment, primarily music
JayZ is like one of the biggest names in Rap today
ok thats the weirdest thing I've heard all day
...
yeah, I'm not about that shit. Its just its hard to nail this 100% every time I talk about someone who I used to think of as a guy whose now a girl.
And "Jay-Z" was apparently their go between or somethign
yes, some people protendent to be the big names of Nintendo trying to discuss the possibility of adapting Sonichu into a game
I forget, I'm sorry, when I first got to know her she was still Christian, before the trans stuff really came to light
But from the amount of information he's revealed about himself due to trolls pretending to be potential female partners or Reggie or Jay-Z, we know so fucking much about this man
He's struggled with stuff like autism and other disorders, and has grown up in a weird family. Watching the documentary series, he blames his hatred for gays on an abusive school teacher/principal but it seems his recollections are iffy. Very confusing and very complex.
Yeah
Probably the most well documented person in human history, a target off trolls for her really questionable comic series Sonichu. Has some very questionable views on certain groups of people, hates gays (despite being trans). There's too fucking much to say man
I'm guessing there's a bunch of accusations they're pulling out of their ass about him.
Wtf is going on with Jacksepticeye?
like, if they don't want lockdowns why would they send in the military? So THEY can do the lockdowns or whatever? What other fucking purpose would they have the military down there
whats the point of sending in the army?

I remember earlier wanting to rewatch Kim Possible (because i got a nostalgia rush), got upset when I found out my brother cancelled our disney plus subscription, but now I remember, yeah, why tf am I pushing myself to be supportive for once, but for Disney of all entities?

Can't wait for the My Grandpa Comes Back Home Variant. He should get home soon, he's been out since '82
im guessing thats why he's so into this cancel culture shit
well... was gonna say if that'd be an issue, but apparently Virginia actually gives a shit about trans stuff
the larp
I'd be more upset about the mispronouning if it weren't for the fact its Tucker and I honestly expected that from him
always cringe, always cringe.
I'm gonna stop with this. This is way more well researched than any of the other brainlet roman comparisons I've seen.
"First, Justinian’s project of restoratio imperii illuminates the dynamics of geopolitical nostalgia, which can be broadly defined as a lamentation for a lost world that never really existed except in the imaginations of those doing the lamenting. Justinian was certainly guilty of this, premising his efforts to restore the empire on what he imagined to be Rome’s golden age." 
Ok...so, the Pax Romana didn't happen? I mean, the world Justinian was in was somewhat of a social and cultural regression. The societal changes brought about by Christianity and the collapse of the functions of state due to the late Imperial crises paved the way for the feudal age. Meanwhile the Pax Romana was, for that region, the most prosperous time in their history, at least up to Justinians life, and probably until the Industrial Revolution begins. It wasn't some nebulous, "non-existant" past, it was well known.
First five paragraphs are somewhat solid. Most of it is factual, isn't actively misinterpreting historical context so...at least we got that thus far
i'm cringing at the references to the "great reset" (you know, the fucking Qanon conspiracy shit) as somehow indicative language behind Biden. Like, them trying to apply modern political slogans to the decisions of Roman leaders (and note they are ALWAYS fucking Romans because these people can't touch anything beyond the Latin language) is always cringe, ALWAYS. But that's just...really iffy, lets say. I'll need to read more to see whether this is supposed to be a net positive or negative for Biden, but yeah, pretty cringe
so...I'm starting to actually glance through this article
And he responds with mass murder
yeah
yeah
(I'd link the takedown video but the guy who does these breakdowns, Thersites, has literally zero technical skill with internet stuff and he sounds like a fucking robot throughout the whole hour long video)
Like, watching a dude take down an article about how Trump is basically just like Tiberius Gracchus, aka the guy who got ganked by a bunch of rich elites for trying to push much needed economic and social reforms, and somehow construes it like Gracchus was the bad guy in the situation
seems to be a lot of Roman comparisons these days in all these outlets...and literally all of them are woefully ignorant of their subjects, or are so up their ass they don't realize they are playing themselves with their comparison
https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1423259502544105499?s=21
So we are comparing Joe Biden to that one emperor who started his reign by ordering his army to slaughter thousands of citizens at a stadium? Cool
I though Picketting was when you send 5000 guys across an open field under concentrated artillery fire expecting to break the yankee lines somehow when you have zero reserves, and like 50% of the people involved get shot, but you still claim the guy who ordered the attack is the second coming of Jesus
That's the problem: you can't really rile up the people against an inanimate disease
yeah, nearly every country I can think of has fucked up covid
I'm gonna just step back and make clear my actual stances on this:
- the outbreak began in China
- China REALLy fucked up containing the virus, and refused to cooperate with the rest of the world to deal with it while it was still in Wuhan, and even refused to admit anything serious was occuring. 
- These guys have a long history of spreading misinformation and cover ups
- because of this, everyone had their guard down when the virus actually started spreading. 
- China continually pushes a narrative that the virus somehow started in the US, because nothing is their fault. 
China didn't start this intentionally, and I believe a sizable majority of the people who think COVID is some bioweapon blame Chinese people in general instead of the CCP itself. At the end of the day, the CCP has hell to pay.
I gave up the argument
I'm gonna go take a break. I've gotten myself worked up over politics for the first time in a month, forgot how much it sucks
I'm sorry, my blood's up rn
No, I cede
I'd love to believe that, but Melua's arguments have been drenched with so much whataboutisms I find it hard to do so
Melua straight up goes "There's a lto fo good reason to hate the US" trying to paint some bizarre equivalency between the two countries
Is the US currently committing genocide? Do we got an ongoing situation comparable to the shit China is actively doing to the Uyghers?
I mean, there's a lot of good reason to hate China. Genocide, politcal repression, etc
And you should have used THAT point instead of "People think China started COVID"
Or that the US is on the same level of morally repugnate as the CCP
like, saying its on the same level is pretty disingenouis
it kinda is
like,you trying to play equivalent for this is pretty fucked here
Like, I don't believe this IS the CCP trying to unleash chemical weapons on the world for global domination or whatever. 
I'm saying there's a lot of good fucking people that people trust China less than the US
YES
Well, it did start in Wuhan. The fact that China  was actively denying anything was happening there whilst video came in of police lockdowns only helped fuel that fire
Yee
the fact it got OUT of China, ground zero, in the first place is the problem. it being handled poorly by other countries is a result of them assuming the authoritarian state that gives no fucks for human rights could contain the virus in their country. But they didn't, and now the rest of the world is suffering, in large part due to China's incompetence
Yeah, they abandoned socialist economics after Mao and adopted Capitalism
But still kept the authoritarian one party system of Mao
So basically they are one of the best examples in our world today of straight up fascism
https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/07/us/black-realtor-and-client-handcuffed-michigan/index.html
hence why it fell appart so quickl
in that instant is was because the guys running Parler were absolute morons who didn't know how to run a social media app
whats shit is that she has a well connected family and is proably gonna get off scot free (unless god decides to give us a freebie)
Looking into it more
Janke (the crazy lady) apparently was the voice on the recording that outed Chris' actions towards her mother, had previously defrauded him and blamed it on a fan named Fiona
Yeah, my fuck up there
was he the guy who got her to do sex stuff with the blowup dolls?
jesus
(I am no expert on the Chrischan stuff so)
who?
https://twitter.com/PyraRule34/status/1424260115272699908?s=20
The Chris-Chan rabbit hole has spread beyond Chris chan herself it seems
(Btw, this may be fake news, not entirely sure, just take this with a grain of salt)
i meant he first Trump impeachment was all about that shit
ok
Its just another conspiracy theory
Just Trumpist shit addapted for the left
Like, I don't buy all these conspiracies about Putin somehow manipulating the US elections and shit. It seems to me more like Cold War rhetoric readapted to now
Which if they're in Putin's pocket, why tf would he want to undermine far-right political parties that would support him?
like this is the most recent shit they've been pushing
https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Spain-WikiLeaks-Reveals-Millionaire-Donors-Fueled-VOXs-Rise-20210806-0010.html
yeah, didn't they just out a bunch of right-wing spanish politicians for supporting alt right shit?
Liveleak is dead tho
idk much about Wikileaks besides the big pol stuff they push about government coverups and such
would Wikileaks even give a shit about something like this? Most of what they do is political stuff from what I can tell, and they don't seem to be one of those free forums where everyone can post people's dirty laundry on
I will say, we are talking in the immediacy of this all. This may just all be really elaborate fake news, or more likely there will be more context in general coming out (maybe police response, for those who believe that to be the paramount thing in this situation, including myself to an extent).
if you want to call back to it just reply to it
you've posted this like three times dude
Like, there's a partial reason why
you were saying "why don't people jsut go to the police about this instead?"
But that's what happens when you've been following through with racist policy
Which is a bad thing
I wasn't sayign having police is bad
Just the American police has been through the fucking ringer because of systemic racism and such to the point the average american has lower confidence in them actually helping
I mean
i mean, we are refering to American police here...
There's a lot of reasons these days that people don't trust the police will actually help
Yeah, her blaming her aversion to transpeople based on what a cis male did to her is probably the most cringe justification she made in that delusional manifesto
Her very stupid philosophy is the only reason these books are as popular as they are today because a lot of rich business folks are obsessed with her crazy ass beliefs
That is often the case with books in general. Most of the time they are the sole product of the author. Of course you have editors and publishers and such, and if they are say star wars books, they are heavily dictate by what the higher ups have planned for further films, games and other media.
I think the whole Art v. Artist debate really hinges on how much control the artist has over the medium they are writing for.
For example, you can't sperate the books of Ayn Rand from Ayn Rand and her deluded philosophy, because that's at the core of the works. Rand doesn't have much substance beyond the political stuff she injects into her stories (I've never enjoyed anything as less as Anthem).
I also love how she goes to herself "I was assaulted by a cishet man years ago. Do I take this out on men in general? No, that'd go against my market demographics. Guess I'll just take it out on those trannies"
I feel like that's the real mental gymnastics happening with her
yeah, she doubled down and made it a feminism thing. normal people don't put out manifestos about how trans women are actually predators, guys.
<@!127848372131463168>  suggestion: check your sources before posting. You've been posting stuff from really obscure right wing website stuff, maybe you need to change up the outlets you check out
ok
Will say, making a mountain out of mole here rn i guess
yesterday you tell me its a biggish deal that i didn't put a space between trans woman. 
I think its on par when you make a typo that can be just as easily be misinterpreted.
i know i didn't use the right term here but
You know what Jude means right?
not to be a grammer nazi...but i assume you mean judge?
and this i agree to
I'm fine with people transitioning and shit
But I think saying that a kid is allowed to transition at the age of 3 is just...absurd
Not transphobia
Uhm...I was eating my own shit at the age of 3. I wouldn't trust 3 year old me with any serious decision beyond "do I want cookie or ice cream" (which of course thats for the parents to control
agreed
yeah, surprised it took so long for someone to actually sue him for the shit he's admitted to on tape

WHAT
from the test it sounds super sus. 
The guy who murdered her claims to have done it in "Self-defense", then hid the body in his mother's home with his mother's help.
doesn't really matter if she's the english or brazilian one
I do that a lot it seems
guess I misinterpreted what you said
ok
.
talking as if they were the cause of the war
your saying it doesn't make sense Taliban were only 55% held responsible
because Bin Laden and Al Quada did the 9/11 attacks
its why the war happens
i mean
and we wanted to get back at them
but because Al Quada was there
The US under Dubya decalred on Afghanistan not because of the Taliban
i mean
i mean, Al Quada was what we really went into Afghanistan for. 
Taliban just didn't want to hand expell them or hand them over.
Hence Dubya declares war and topples Taliban but focuses all efforts on tracking down Al Quada and specifically Bin Laden
Pablo Escobar became one of the richest people alive just by smuggling coke into the US
same deal with the drug war
ok
(I know what crocodile is btw. I'm just confused by that statment)
i mean, i could just...not take the meds
I had this on the back of my mind for a while.
thank you
wasn't sure if it was code for some illegal shit that shouldnt be in my system
ok
You know, I've heard people joking about their ADD/ADHD/whatever medicine having opiods or coke or whatever in them, and now I'm getting paranoid that the stff I'm taking has it and I don't know it.
I'm taking Strattera, more specifically Atomoxetine. Looking at it, is says it contains "Atomoxetine hydrochloride USP equivalent to atomoxetine 100 mg"
I don't know what all that medical jargon is...should I be concerned? 
Note: I don't take this regularly, or at least when im not doing school stuff or going to work, which is usually once a week, but sometimes I just don't do those things. This month, I've only taken this like twice during the whole period. And honestly, I can't tell if its helping or if its a placebo effect, where i just take it so i can lie to my brain ill be more productive
refering to the broader genre, especially those which capitalized on public fears of gays and transfolks and such
wasn't thinking of Blacksplotation when I made my statement
then you get all the films like all the women murder shit, the "transkiller" flicks, and all the fucking Mondo films
Yeah, Blacksplotation was one of the few positive sides of that
idk if this is worse than all the 70s exploitation flicks
https://twitter.com/StrikeDebt/status/1428704807045550091?t=utAGREOboNHupB-EF-eM8Q&s=19
yup
Yeah, from what I've seen, Youtube and Google do double down on manuel reviews. Saw it happen with a dude's review of Schindler's List, got demonitized by manuel review and age restricted so high school students wouldn't be able to view it. Meanwhile, the Thai-language area contains a lot of pro-nazi shit still up, while a channel trying to provide Holocaust education got mass flagged and struck down.
that said, Apple ain't Google/Youtube, I imagine they ccould have a better system than they do in regards to detecting harmful content on their platforms
given experience with stuff like Youtube, stuff like this is gonna have some problems.
The problem with algorythims is they are algorythims, which often lack context for a situation and will misreport on something because it doesn't meet their parameters, or it does but those parameters result in something mundane being reported as harmful
its mostly parroting stuff said by Fatmanfalling, but in a more well delivered manner
irony being, when all the shit came out regarding shitty stuff going on in RT, almost none of the shit was directed towards M&K
That's a very cringe thing I've seen people try to argue why Miles is a shit person
I know there's a point where there's an implication that Miles is a pedo for pairing his 17 year old self insert with a 17 year old girl voiced by another adult
I used to buy into this back in my Hardcore CRTC days, and I can tell you, it gets really cringe and the attacks on M&K were often super overblown
and I should note: the folks who push this stuff the MOST use it to shit on M&K for "ruining" Monty's vision of some grand super project
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHSNUF-1KCOlXcI0rjk7VMYWS9-W1QK8c Here
I need to find that one level-head doc I watched year ago researching this for a project i was wokring on
People go on about "Monty's plan" as if its some massive magnum opus, where it seems the show was mainly something for Monty Oum to flex and have fun with making
From the 5 youtube docs I've seen discussing the show and monty, it ALWAYS says that he was the big idea guy, focused on fight scenes, occasionally says stuff like "Oh hey, maybe this character is a member of an oppressed group", but that M&K always handled actually writing scripts and such
I always found the "Monty's plan" thing super cringe. 
We mostly get this from Shane's letter, which is not written by a guy in a good headspace
where he has strong inputs on big ideas
M&K were always the lead writers, though Oum was serving as a Gene Roddenberry figure in the production
Which M&K stringed them together with the plot
Mostly he focused on coming up with fight scenes
He's the big idea dude
From all that I gather
i mean, it getting implemented by Monty, that would have been fine. The issue isn't that the Faunus stuff is there, but how poorly handled it was, which is on M&K's shoulders as the nitty gritty writers
It sucks that its the Xmen thing of "Minorities with Superpowers", which is really stupid if you get into the nitty gritty of the concept
Yeah
Its a complex issue handled by two first time writers with little or no personal experience on the matter.
Those were the three worse days of my life online
When I called the dude out for complaining about an episode he didn't watch, the dude decided to use his clout to accuse me of being a pedo
And then there's TheFloofArtist, who may be the person I hate the most on the internet
That said, you dude get chuds like Mediocrity04 and that one dude obsessed with Vic I forgot the name of
Thing is, the arguments are from the extreme ends of the aisle
Seen many big names criticize the LGBT rep as half assed and essentially queer baiting, and trashing on the very fucked up subtext with the Faunus subplot v1-5
Like, his beef with MauLer is probably the pettiest thing I've seen from mid-level Youtubers
Like, biggest dude being Fatmanfalling, whose opinions on anything that isn't RWBY being just...awful, or outright hypocritical
I can attest I've met a lot of the main RWBY CRTCs back in the day, and can personally attest to many of them having severe issues
I think the CRTC community has cooled off dramatically in recent years, especially as RT as a whole is on obvious decline, and the show has improved dramatically from its early days
this got out of hand
yeah
we know her backstory
but to this point its been 8 seasons and we don't know what Salem wants with the relics.
I'd say the lore got better after v5
why must you say the accursed's name
of course, if your payoff is interesting, you can justify this
But the payoffs for the 4 season wait is "Good God, Bad God, 4 relics, get them"
and basically disappoint your audience
basically, telling the audience "Don't worry, we'll show this later" over and over again, until you reveal EVERYTHING
Like, RWBY may be the worst culprit in terms of Abrams' Mystery Box story telling (aka the worst thing that's happened to media this century)
after so much Mystery Boxing
Its less that, more, it took us four seasons to realize the plot of the show is a macguffin hunt
this is why I initially dropped the show v4
oh those memes
SLA?
?
really, HBomberguy ripped off Fatman's style to a T
and hints at a next part
and Monty's death
it just stops after v3
With Part 2 coming out...who fucking knows
but that's just part one
yeah
what a king
unless they want to go on a rant about the 4 hour video
yeah i don't pester people for not watchign a 4 hour video
Anyways, highly recommend this three part series talking about the "Monty's vision" discourse. Very levelheaded, solid analysis.
Ok, but, I don't think that's a good excuse to rant about something you havent watched
rather than hearing something someone else told you about it
I do recommend watching it yourself and getting your own opinion
and its part 1, he hasn't gotten to the Shane Letter yet
also he goes hard on the Shane stuff, emphasising his role in the series
if Fatmanfalling rub you the wrong way, your noot going to enjoy what he has to say
so
https://youtu.be/wsJaBAz2soY 
Not the most in depth but a good entryway to the topic
its been a while since I saw a Rackham video on that mess.
yeah
Because the fifth dude, Ali, had been considered as a candidate for succssion since Muhammed's death, but other more powerful caliphs took charge
not until like his fourth successor did the Islamic world start dividing between Sunni and Shia
Kinda funny knowing that two Islamic extremist groups hate each other
considering I'm a fucking historian and shit, and I've not touched much on the Islamic world
a lot more fucking reading
I need to do more reading

PETA being a joke since they went out against Steve Irwin, and people uncovered the reports of them abusing dogs in their care
go on
probably more so
I find Autism Speaks to be just as cringe as the "Autism is a superpower" folks
oh yeah
I will admit, I may be extreme in my stance, blaming aspergers for me being an asshole for about 10 years of my life to try to put blame for my awful actions of back when on that factor. 
Thing was, I've been fighting against it the entire time (or at least tried to), and my methods of doing so were so poor they only exacerbated my issues. A part of me just wants to redo my life since middle school, and try not to disappoint future me forever
I wouldn't not not have it. The worst parts of myself stem from it, and I'd rather have been "normal" and not lost 90% of my friends from the shit i did because of how my brain works like an asshole
I feel like I've been fighting against my own self for the last 10 years of my life
As someone with Aspergers, it pisses me off to hear people call autism their "superpower", when from all I can tell it seems like a fucking anchor dragging me down
Yay, we ended racism...but actually police still shoot black people because of institutional racism and a "War on Drugs" bullshit.
So if this country descends into civil war, I think that's for the fucking best, in the long run
If we are to get change, we can't get it from reform. We've tried that since the 60s, and it hasn't truly worked.
America is too fucking tied to its institutions to actually change for the better
we have bullshit holdouts like these
but no
With centuries of improvements in education and shit
Like, this is shit we should have gotten past decades ago
I kinda want my country to just die
As someone with Aspergers, yeah, its shit
But at least I'm alive
because having austism is somehow worse than fucking death.
Remember: the OG anti-vax craze started when Measles came back, a disease which will fucking kill you if untreated
But these fucking people would rather die than, according to the bullshit they eat, give their kids autism
And kill or harm themselves in the process
and so they'll listen to whatever wacky "alternative" they can find
because Anti-vaxxers don't want to die to COVID, but will not listen to professional doctors
You afraid someone's gonna start talking about Mr. Hands?
Much prefer the Sherman skin.
A lot to love and a lot to hate about him; cancels out the controversy
I got a friend in New Orleans. Some family of another friend live in Baton Rouge; when I visited the latter, half the area was flooded by mere rainwater; wonder how well they'll deal with this

It's directed to Turkish workers living in Germany
I think the only one of his marshalls shorter than Napoleon was Davout...who turned out to be the best of the marshals, despite Napoleon kinda hating him for criticizing his acctions in Russia
also, most of his generals were lower nobles, who generally had healthier diets and were taller than the average Frenchman, so he stood out at conferences
that too
Like, the reason why people in Napoleon's day always refered to him as below average in height is less to do with reality (he was 5'6", the median height of a french male at the time), and more to do as a way to denegrate him
Height = Power/superiority
that too
'Murca
if your refering to Sharecropping: Yeah, basically thats what that shit was
(sorry, Civil War dude here)
But yeah, the Republicans (specially the Lincoln-supporting ones) were for reconciliation with the South. The only two guys who faced punishment for their actions in the war was one kentucky partisan commander who massacred surrendered black troops (while his actual superior got away with it scot free), and the guy in charge of Andersonville. Forrest gets no punishment for the Fort Pillow Massacre or founding the Klan; Alexander Stephens, Howell Cobb, Robert Toombs, and all of Georgia's other shitty slavebaiters get punished; no one in the Confederate Congress who kept up the war got punished (many of them got reelected and went back to US Congress in the years following). 
The idea that the Republican party was punitive towards the South during and after the war was an element of Lost Cause bullshit. Really the only thing they changed was that slavery was over and that black people should have right...not that they enforced that.
I will say, people keep trying to portray Lee as some benevolent figure who didn't care about slavery...when after the war he's constantly pushing for the suppressing of black rights and espousing "anglo-saxon" dominance and shit
Eh
Like, they breifly jailed Jeff Davis, but he got released because his cell was too cold
reality: almost no Slaveowners were shot. Most of the guys who started the bloodiest conflict in American history and recieved basically no punishment.
https://twitter.com/AP/status/1434976706020978693?s=20
but yeah, saying Lee would have somehow "won" in Afghanistan is just silly

Wasn't Saxony where the seat of the Weimar Republic was in the 1920s? Literally the most liberal democracy the world had ever seen (even to this day in many ways)?
And these fuckers are voting the Diet-Nazis back into power?
Wtf is the black spots?
Well...damn
So, hot take:
Lee was actually a good, almost great general in a lot of ways. His front remained solid for 3 years of war, no mean feat considering the best Union troops and resources were sent to Virginia. Of course, he favored the frontal assault, a tactic that was slowly but surely grinding down Confederate manpower, but he was also a man willing to (most of the time) play the maneuver game. And he was great at handling subordinates, not a hard task considering that most of them were slaveowners, whose position in society made them utterly egotistical, and resulted in much infighting in other armies. The Union wins the civil war in the West, with the Captures of Fort Donelson, Vicksburg, and Atlanta; Lee Surrendering is the last real challange, which takes way longer than it needed to. 
That said, he doesn't deserve a statue. The purpose of a statue is to represent someone whose done good deeds for the public. While Lee deserves reading by military folks, these people don't need statues. The one thing about Lee that was overplayed in the Lost Cause narrative was how saintly or gentelmanly he was. He may have been this way to fellow "Anglo-Saxons", but he was a staunch racist and was known to have rounded up Northern Freemen in his marches into the North and brought them back south into bondage, even though many of them had been born freemen and lived their entire lives as such. After the war, he decried the Civil Rights Amendments (13th, 14th and 15th) because he prefered a society where white men still dominated over blacks. 
I may have issues with folks like Grant and Sherman as generals, even as human beings at times with the shit they did and said, but they have done more positive for this country than Lee ever did.
yup
And fuck, the Union did actually deal with Confederate partisans, to mixed results. And President Grant basically crushed the KKK before it could really take its hold and possibly start a guerrilla war
I mean, there WERE folks even in Napoleon's day who knew how to handle that kind of war. Marshal Suchet was the first guy to realize "Hey, maybe we SHOULDN'T rob and rape and murder the locals" and started the concept of "Hearts & Minds". Then again, none of his contemporaries really picked it up at the time and just looted Spain for all it was worth.
And even the best general of the era (Napoleon) was horrendous when it came to dealing with Guerrilla war
Doesn't take into consideration Lee never fought a guerrilla war
Can I get context on her age? Like, Elementary, middle or High School kid?
My recommendation: get one. Tell your folks you aren't feeling well and need to see a therapist
Which you can't have in perfect Utopia China
From what I heard, the upper echelons of the CCP consider homosexuality as a sign of moral and social decay
agreed
We never invaded Syria
I love these "Our culture" types who know nothing of their culture
~~Kinda feel ya~~
shouldn't diminish that
I mean, there were ground casualties at the Pentagon
I agree that the hijackers didn't really want to crash into an empty field
Yeah

there were 4 planes involved
two flew into the two towers
one flew into the pentagon
And the last one, we don't know where it was supposed to go (some think it was gonna hit the White House or Congress), because before they reached their destination, the passangers revolted, started to attack the hijackers, who proceeded to crash the plan into a Pennsylvania field
I was only 1 1/2 years old when it happened. I don't think i really knew what had gone down until I was like, 7
I imagine this is gonna be a bigger deal for China than the Video Game stuff
stuff like this and people call me crazy for calling for Anglocide

yeah, that joke was out of line. its not a serious position I hold, and really shouldn't be making those kinds of jokes in this channel under those circumstances

Honestly whenever I hear Braun I can only tthink of the edgy dude from Bokoen's channel

Anyway, who the fuck is this Braun guy?
what are the chances that him pulling this snap election is gonna worsen his chances of being able to do coalition building wwith the other parties? I know the opposition parties (at least the three that matter) all made stinks about how greedy Trudeau was with that move in their campaigns: do you think they're gonna immediately eat crow, or are they gonna hold this over him?
I mean, I can't recall many technical fuck ups by Youtube getting talked about. All I really hear is people getting their channels screwed over by the algorythm

Considering I just hear nothing about the Saudis anymore in my newsfeed, no clue
oh that incident
Left a comment on the video, hopefully people who do click see it and steer away

Because he's the "free money guy"
https://youtu.be/qZR0XZ70QOc
Scam on YouTube. This was advertised.
that's great and all...as long as the government cares about the truth. In which case, yeah, that's a big assumption.
Remember on Youtube earlier this year, a bunch of History Youtubers collaborated on Project Shoah, talking about the Holocaust, the history of the genocide, the peoples affected by it, media depictions, Holocaust denial, etc. Well, many of these guys had their videos demonitized and aged restricted so high school students can't view it (which I think is a felony in some places in the west), many of them by manual review. I've heard incidents on Thailand Youtube of a group of educational Youtubers trying to push back against a lot of the Nazi stuff present in Thai culture by putting up videos about the Holocaust, only to be mass flagged by thousands of Thai neo-nazis, and forcing the channel to shut down.
Back to the point though:
The big issue with deplatforming is you need to have power on the platform to be able to harass these people off the platform. And often times, these guys are often able to do the same to you but better.
Yes...but I've deal with a LOT of people on discord, so I skim over stuff like that constantly
My bad, didn't know your preference on that
Honestly, I prefer deplatforming as opposed to direct legislation, because with a bunch of old white guys in power, do you really expect them to do the right thing and not diminish your voice in exchange for the rightoids?
"Fascists". Shorthand usually for any extremist rightwing group you can usually consider, like the Klan or Stormfront or any of the neo-nazi orgs around
interesting idea...if the US Government would care for the mandate
yeah
too bad they aren't the US, where most of thed\se social media companies HQ in
yeah, lucky them
again, its a matter of WHO in an organization or entity is doing it
but imagine if we did get such legislation....under a Republican administration...
I mean, corporations like Facebook controling media is awful, i don't even need to spell out why
yeah, and you think that the government is going to act as a neutral party in this? Doubt it
yeah that's just more <#407060923078017026>  material
of all the choices they could have gone with for VP, they choose the cop
but that's not gonna happen since Kamala is vp
like police reform
yeah
but no, infrastructure bill
meanwhile, we have to sit through Biden basically throwing away a golden oppurtunity to put through necessary reforms and shit, with the right basically fucked after Jan 6th
meanwhile in the US, that's not gonna ever fucking happen with our parties, not by a longshot
At least in Britain there's a  chance the Labour party will just die and be replaced by a better, more honestly leftleaning party
watching leftwing parties in the English speaking world just go conservative has honestly been the biggest fucking tragedy of this era.
but yeah, its basically just the oposition party's little club

And she's basically strongarmed me out of my phone to call 911

Wow
Well, I'm going to go to bed and hope I don't get murdered in my sleep.
If I find the backdoor to my garage in the morning unlocked or even ajar, I'm making a report. If not, I'm gonna start looking for holes
My parents are of the opinion, since we are so far away from the cities, that we wouldn't get some random robber coming over to our random house in the suburbs
no
On the one hand, she has mental health issues which she has been amplifying by not taking her meds, so part of me thinks she's just being paranoid
But there's definitely something in my garage. Our pet dog was barking up a storm, only does that when there is someone he considers a stranger (even close family friends are not immune to his disgust). And earlier this week we found one morning a bunch of boxes in our garage tumbled into my mom's convertable (note: our parents are on their annaversary vacation and I can't call either of them on this).
yes
like how many scandals did Trump have? Guy gets "impeached" twice but at the end of the day it didn't matter because they never went through with the legal proceedings afterwards
yeah
oh
This is on the same level as that one republican dude who said "how can i feed my children on just $200K?" like 10 years ago

then again, the principal at my middle school, I've heard rumors from theater kids about her ordering the "Gay European" bit from Totally Blonde be omitted from the School's performance, and other insinuations of homophobia
And the Principal of my High school had to make an vague ass public apology for what I later found out was some crime statistics post on twitter (guess what that means)
the more i think about it, its fucking weird as shit. I grew up in Georgia north of Atlanta, 95% of my teachers I had K-12 were white (I can remember one art teacher who was asian, and a health teacher who was black)
The fact I can't recall any big incidents of racism or bigotry, intentional or accidental, i find shocking.
i can't really think of a teacher doing anything as shit as this from my experience in primary education
I'm starting to think these guys believe in toxic conspiracy theories

I should say the only source I got for it is from a twitter post by alt right chud Jack Posobiec. Not sure if i can find a clip of it
So, apparently the judge for the Rittenhouse trial started ranting to the prosecuters (you know, the folks who are trying to prove Kyle murdered three people) about Rome and how they deserve to be eaten by lions.
not an expert but I have family who are part time hunters in Montana, so I know a bit of their lifestyle
so there are certain seasons you can hunt in in some places, and quotas for how much you can get
well, we stopped the wholesale slaughter of entire species, but nowadays hunting is partly done to make sure animals that grow exponentially don't suddenly overpopulate an area and damage ecosystems

I'm fucking tired of NFT shit

"You can't criticize me, given you are such obvious hypocrites"

He put the two poptarts on a ceramic plater
no
It wasn't like a full blaze or anything, but it was hot enough to fill the house with CO2
when we opened the thing, the poptart was a melted black mass
the whole interior is vomit yellow and burn marks all around inside
we got more help from a neighbor to clear out the house further. Checked the microwave, thing is a write off
it did not, but the house was filled with smoke
(speak of the devil)
I have messaged both my parents about this. Mom is out of town across the country, and woke up to give some advice before going to bed (she is still asleep as far as I know), and my father, who is in town but out of the house, has not replied to a single message or call
thought my brother and I could just cordon off the masterbedroom, opened the windows and the sliding door to the backyard, and turned on all the fans, so we can at least sit somewhere in the house. That went well until I noticed my brother's cheeks turning red. Back outside now.
Most of the smoke has gone after the first hour, but there's like very concerning amount left, and the smoke alarm is still blaring.
so, today's been hellish
My brother decided to microvave poptarts and his misread seconds and minuteso n the box. House started filling with smoke. We turned off the microwave, ran outside, and opened all the doors and windows.
why be picky?
all that is important is a long, warm, juicy piece of meat going down my throat giving me pleasure
why waste the time and effort when i could put a hotdog in a bun on a platter, put it in the microwave, wait 20 seconds, and get a hotdog with a heated bun?
...yes?
so...not making hot dogs for a while
also, Dad decided the microwave was totalled and threw it out
yeah
so...
My brother cooked them for about 3 minutes 30 seconds; the instructions on the box said 6-8 seconds
Yeah, I used to REALLY obsess with how people saw me, and all that did was turn me into a ticking time bomb of repressed emotions and shit.
Yeah...just say trollers instead of "annoying Indians" which sounds offensive.
I do want to ask what you mean by "Annoying Indians" though.
causing yourself physical harm isn't making you more "mature", just the opposite.
It sounds like these people are just out of touch and not worth your attention or time

I can't personally recall hearing any hero worship for any of the three victims in this case. Maybe I'm just not hanging in the right circles, but I know from the dialogue on this server on the whole case, most of yall have avoided going too far with it, just pointing out under the law the three people involved should be considered victims, which they were in this case. It just so happened one of them was a REALLY shitty person (something the right tries to pump up when in reality I doubt Kyle knew the rando he shot was a pedo)

but shouldnt the company have made an announcement to the employees about the weather conditions?
all in the name of staying in power
hard to say. I mostly know of the Epstein shit entirely through osmosis, and that every layperson I talk to, no matter which end of the spectrum politically they are, are excited to hear the names revealed, if merely so they can hear the big bad politician they hate (either Trump or the Clintons usually) were involved
Its not a good coverup when it becomes the most broadly accepted conspiracy theory of out current time, more so than the 9/11 trutherism or whatever antisemetic shit the chuds are on abotu now
I mean, people rn are obsessed with Ghislaine Maxwell and the potential clients she'll reveal and all that jazz, and fear that she'll end up just like Epstein
or it could be someone mistyped a handle and got your usernumber instead
or just a weirdo
yeah probably a scammer
any old servers you were a part of they could potentially be from?
no idea
i'm pretty sure he was placed as Person of the Year because you know, Hitler was making moves and shit in Europe, not that they're commending him as a person
Like how they had Trump as Person of the Year 2016, because the guy was the most talked about person of that year
"PLEASE, that village needs to be bombed so we can get one terrorist guy who may or may not be there! Think of the child soldiers we'll kill in the process!"

are yall excited for Great Depression 2: Goldman-Sachs Boogaloo to go down over NFTs and Crypto-crap? Because the part of me that's excited to watch this entire country burn to the ground before my eyes is fucking excited
it seems that the little guys who get into NFT shit are trying to get out of the economic crap that these shady fucking companies put them in
yeah
even though it was propped up by the system
he was led to believe that NFTs were the thing that could undermine the system that was fucking him over
basically
we literally had an NFT guy come on here a few weeks and say that that's the reaosn he got into NFTs
and you get a lot of despertate people on board
because its played up as a get rich quick sccheme
they get into NFTs because they think they can get out of their economic issues
I wouldn't be that harsh
eh
that the bubblle bursting at this rate may get destructive
I'm just saying
i am not trying to support this behavior
i know
but the top percent will just get off in the end
yeah a couple will fall
can't wait for this bubble to burst, and making the economic divides worse because the rich never suffer
now I know why jeff bezos gets everything
oh god
i now see why this was such a popular religion in rome
also heard that the infamous verse about how "sleeping with a man is a sin" was actually supposed to read "sleeping  with a boy", but either that was mistranslated or the whole Vatican creepshow shit started WAY earlier than we thought
we made it December 25th because of Roman holiday shenanigans
yeah, we don't know Jesus' bday
I'll admit, a lot of the anti-mask people (particularly those who are spreading conspiracy theories and shit) are shitbags. That said, given how fucked up American culture is (with Libertarianism Lite and the myth of the Self-Made Man being borderline religious), as well as all the political trends that had developed before the outbreak, this result, as awful as its been, I feel was just inevitable. You'd probably have to go back to the 60s to fix this shit
yeah...but you can tell how that was kinda a fuckup in marketting
i mean...your pointing out the real issue for a lot of average people towards masks
Its the conflicting reports that they have to sparce out which one to go with, and at the end of the day, many people tend to avoid minor inconviniences than be hypercautious
imagine blaming consumers for your own shitty practices
its always complicated
its family
thing is, Sarah's been pushing all day to have family bonding stuff. That Monopoly game was something she pushed for, even though my brothers were quite reluctant
It may be a subconsious thing is her case that she's getting exhausted by all this socializing. She and I have been staying with our parents continuously since May, and she's gonna be leaving for her new career in California on the 26th. Maybe its stress, maybe its a lot of other things
she seems to be a bit more stable and she accepted it, and was a bit more upbeat afterwards
yeah she just came back a bit ago. I made an apology to her about the way I've acted today and previous, wanting to make sure that we get a positive christmas
That said, I hope yall are having a positve holiday season.
Well...Christmas Eve hasn't gone great. 
Christmas dinner, My sister had a melt down because of a really petty argument with my dad (both were being needlessly antagonistic; my sister is bipolar has diffucult mood swings and my dad can be pretty caustic at times). She left the table in a fit, and we ended dinner soon after that. Didn't help that earlier me, her and my other siblings played a game of Monopoly that I was being a bad sport about because I was losing so hard. And for months now she's been in random spats with the rest of the family and done a lot of microaggressions that me, my youngest brother Z and my dad are on our last legs with her. We tried to liven up the mood by watching that one Santa Claus movie with Kurt Russell; but my sis just left the house without seeing or talking to anyone, and the movie had some kinda depressing stuff in the story that wasn't helping our mood too much. 
All in all...this may be the first depressing Christmas holidy I've experienced. I hope Christmas Day is better, but there's just so much petty drama in the family that I'm kinda scare of how next Christmas is gonna go.
thats not something you want to see when you work on a parlimentary "party boss" system
yeah
for all the Brits in this server

and kids
so there's  chance there will be enough backlash to make the execs worry about a mass walkout on the platform
It seems though that these tags are still in place...and Apple apparently tried to do similar shit in 2018, but that got rolled back
the irony...
Tf?
wait..wtf they ban "Safe sex" and "Sex education"?
tumblr's been a joke for years
Kwanza was founded by a black studies professor who wanted to bring peace to the community after the Watts Riot
Worst thing about the guy is he founded some Black Panther esque organization and got arrested on certain charges related to such activities
nevermind, looked them up, they posted a "Traitors of America" list that includes Scott the Woz
I feel like I'm a grandpa who has never done the internets before. 
What tf is Oneangrygamer?
that is quite an interesting analogy...
but no...we got to cancel a progressive voice because we don't know how to do critical reading
I actually thouhgt this was all over after her response video
god, I hated seeing that shit
love how Yamashita gets executed because disobedient naval officers refused to follow his orders and started killing civilians in Manila (because "He's in charge, he knew it was happening; therefore its his fault)
And then Okamura gets off scot free after killing 3 million people
literally the only guys who got punished were punished because they abused westerners or kicked MacArthur's ass at some point in the war
and we made the Imperial family immune from any warcrime trials, so the member of the family who led the troops who tore Nanking apart...scot free
Whats fucked is that for those last two, the guys who came up with that shit were pardoned and hired by the US to figrue out how to use their knowledge in case of war with the Communists...
or the Three Alls
or Unit 731
or the Rape of Nanking
see the Comfort Women of Korea
hence why there's a strong backlash against any contrition towards hte peoples they abused back then
Japanese society still has some nostalgic memories of the Imperial days
oh yeah you remind me
in reference to Japan and why Far Rightoids are obsessed with it
plus ultra capitalism, broken legal systems with conviction rates up in the 90s, some regressive ideas on gender and LGBT stuff in the broad culture
tbh, they are obsess with a nation which the far right considers to be the ideal country...for a lot of shitty reasons
my neurology makes it impossible to tell if this isjust a random joke or if the Senran Kagura and Neptunia fandoms have a racism problem

glad we can agree on something
same
i just gleaned through a "Know Your Meme" page on OAG, that was one of the fucking subjects
Skorzeny?
while Japan just copes
but today, Germany actively denigrates its history
yeah, back in the day a lot of Nazis and Japanese war criminals were still in positions of power after the war
you know this argument is cool and all but it forgets the big fucking issue
its an inside joke on the same level as Drumpf
and one reporter asked one of the Race Winners if they were shouting "Lets Go Brandon"
for months on end
because it all started because Nascar fans were chanting "Fuck Joe Biden"
pretty wrong about that
I don't evne know where I should begin
you remind me of the racist shenanigans of Brit hooligans after "Its Coming Rome"
listen, the far right still obsesses about how China is evil because they're dirty commie bastard, when in reality they're dirty fascist bastards
tbh, i think this is them trying to get across that not all of the Nazi's programs in a vacuum are necessarily evil, because a lot of the anti-socialist bullshit that developed in this country has partly been based on views on the Nazis being a mask off for socialists
i'd say Hitler was more inspired by that shit than Mussolini. Mussolini's fascism is more prototypical far right dictatorship than the shit Hitler was doing, which is genocidal expansionism and weird distorted forms of socialism
thank you for making me look into this, I never looked too deeply at the famous cover and didn't notice the fucking corpses
but in this case...yeah no
understandable, a lot of the media is often fluffpieces or propoganda for certain entities
we're literally judging books by their covers
its like saying that Time endorses Duterte because they put him on the cover of their magazine
because Hitler was an important political figure throughout his reign
Yeah
I'd post it but i don't know how to spoiler tag with the new image system
Also look at the cover of the issue. Its Hitler sitting at an organ surrounded by corpses

was he?
its just saying "This person was the most influential person of this year"
i think this arguments been had but just because someone makes person of the year doesn't mean they're endorsed by Time
I know Barbie was hired by the CIA to root out communists in south america
i think he's refering to another questionaire where people were asked if we should end women's suffrage, and people said yes thinking it mean Women's Suffering
I should have added a /s but whatever
theright to vote (cringe)
This is what we call a systematic failure of the education system
whats even funnier is that they also asked a more liberal pool of people if "catholic preist Lemaitre's creation theory" should be taught in school. Most of them say no...even though Lemaitre's theory is also known as the BIG BANG THEORY
this is the funniest and saddest read
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/arabic-numerals-survey-prejudice-bias-survey-research-civic-science-a8918256.html
like, that whole episode is the one reason I actually am obsessed with the Civil War as i am now.
really sad he isn't gonna do a deep dive video on Pat Cleburne and the Dalton proposal. He mentioned it in the Black Confederates video, and a community post going in depth about it, but the details of it all are video worthy and NO ONE on youtube has done a good deep dive on it
I kinda like him to. All of those "Checkmate Linconite" vids (except for the last one) were fantastically written and gave nuance to the issues being discussed. The ones on Black Confederates and Sherman are some of the best on eiher subject on Youtube
its the kind to get chuds to click on it expecting to get validation only to recieve facts and logic
good point
Pepperidge Farm remembers
Remember how we still ahven't put any of the Bush administration on trial for Iraq because the democrats are afraid of the fact they had voted in favor on most of Bush's actions?
I'm so glad that in my country, the Democratic party actually cares about the common man and is working in unison to meet the people's interests and totally not squabling over basic stuff like the budget, something they didn't even do for Trump when he was in office.../s
didn't one of Labour's MPs recently walk out on the party after being told by their new leader to go pro-business and tell working class folks to go fuck themselves?
don't you love it when the one party you expect to be in your interest against a regressive rightwing party is sold out to business interests and utterly incapable or unwhilling to get change done
i mean, the only "English numerals" i can think of are the phonetically written out numbers (One, Forty-Five, etc)
objectively
becuase those suck
we talking roman numerals too?
whats this about "taught both"?

This is why I am not following US politics super closely these days. I'd end up fucking crying in agony and frustration
oh wait, remember now, she compared being anti-mask to being Jewish in Nazi Germany
didn't she also say some...choice shit about the Holocaust?
can't wait for a new copyright law to extend it until the 2040s
its gonna be real sad when the champion against Crypto bullshit is gonna be Putin
Crypto bros now crying for daddy Putin to save their sham excuse for their money laundering scheme
wwhat I hate reading this article is seeing that the police's response to this attack has been deemed "slow" and in my brain I went "yeah, makes sense"
I hate this fucking world the Matrix generated for us
alternatively Nintendo can use their evil energy to just get the rights to said NFTs and start selling them
Oh that would be the funniest shit ever
ngl, this is probably the most based thing I've seen in years
I remember like two years back getting into his stuff because he was saying lefty stuff i believed in but takaing to task lefty grifters whose bullshit pushed me out of that side of politics for a good while. Thought he was one of the good guys
Then he starts asking chat about ||why having cp is a bad thing||
somefuckinghow
they don't think this is funny, they use this shit like they're making actual arguments
not dealing with this kinda shit
banned the fucker
I'm not gonna even try
I banned the guy immediately but this was just a cherry on top for a really shitty fucking afternoon
well..in other news, some asshole on another server I mod on posted this shit (cw homophobia)
so actually, an NFT of this fucker makes perfect sense. Same level of delusional people involved
this guy is legit the pol pot of the americas
reminder: Abimael Guzman ("Chairman Gonzalo") led a cult-like communist sect in Peru that caused a brutal civil war that resulted in thousands of peasants and fellow leftists in the country targetted by the organization https://youtu.be/OHqJDs3OuhQ
this makes me want to vomit for so many reason
hopefully he doesn't out his translator whose family would be threatened and killed by the taliban if it weren't for an Australian ArmA youtuber going the extra mile to delete the article off the face of the internet
It gets more complicated on the individual and subparty level, where certain faction emerge over time. In the south during the Reconstruction era, there are politicians on both parties trying to garner black voters (several former confederate generals like William Mahone and James Longstreet became Republicans and pushed liberal legislation that helped the black communities). Eventually though, the South becomes dominated by a white-supremacist Democrat party (known as the Dixiecrats) that remains in power into the 60s, even when democratic Presidents JFK and LBJ are pushing for Civil Rights.
and of course because American politics is binary, becuase the Republicans hated immigrants, Democrats campaigned hard for immigrant votes (which is what keeps the party alive after the war). 
Its not until FDR that the Democrats start shifting towards supporting black America (because Republicans eventually just stopped caring).
reminder that the OG Republican party was a merger with the Know Nothings, a "Nativist" anti-immigrant party that harassed newly arrived Irish, German, and other Central and Eastern European immigrants for "takin 'er jobs"
In that regard, they've not really changed much
rightwing guys who like to throw around SJW and "Cultural Marxism" without a hint of irony
maybe its because I don't frequent chud podcasts like I used to back in the day
and honestly its been a long fucking time since I've seen that term get actually used
its a peragotive used by the right wing to denounce liberals (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to use the term they actually like to use so I wont), primarily those pushing cultural issues like racial or gender inequality
in all seriousness, it was running into a german communist dude in a writers group on discord
running into people who actually supported my views rather than parrot partisan posturing over how their favored candidate was secretly a saint
I've moved away from plebian atheism and agnosticism and now believe I am god
I'm in a funk rn
I've gotten with a spat with an acqaintance on a forum over some issue I don't want to get into the details of. What ppisses me off is that they keep spouting the same bullshit stance over and over, despite all I do to prove that its wrong, but he just keeps doubling and doubling down. I try to change the subject so I can move on, but he doesn't want to and keeps babbling his nonsense. 
I'm fucking tired of this. I was trying to have a reasonable discussion about stuff with other people, but this guy just can't stop it with the nonsense. It's bringing stuff on the forum to a halt, making things super toxic, and it doesn't seem the moderates are willing or able to do anything about it.
I'm good
I guess the setting I thought was normal was actually not strong enough to dry it in one go. Had to run it on the next highest setting and that dried it
Yeah it was clear
I hate this shit. I hate it immensely. Only reason I'm not dropping out is because my other siblings have all dropped out of college and I'm the only one left with a chance here
And rn I'm experimenting to see whether or not the dryer is broken ...dangerous because like three quarters of my clothes went through the washer, put them through the dryer, only to find them still wet
There's a lot of other things I find annoying. Like not having parking permission to get anywhere near my classes so I have to use the school stadium lot to grab a bus to then walk half a mile to the middle of the campus to get to class.  
Also my mom deciding that I don't need my og dishes that I've been using for the last 3 years, so she she bought a new set of plates cups and bowls that are all tiny as fuck and downright useless for the meals I prepare
Yeah
I really hate the place I'm living it. It's more expensive than the place I was in last time I lived on campus, but it has way less in amenities and space and stuff. Last place had wifi, this shithole doesnt. Only real upsides to the place is the main building with the gym and pool and rec area (literally the only part of the place that doesn't look like shit) and a gate entrence that slightly decreases my fears of getting robbed.
So...first week back to college after a semi break during the summer and fall last year
I regret coming back
i won't say that last part as expert opinion though. However, this server was founded as a breakaway of another symphogear discord that put up with problematic content and behavior.
power to you. I know my fair share of abusive servers. 
In regards to making your own breakoff server: If you have people you know on the server or know users who are also the target of such behavior or have similar issues with the server, I'd say try and do a coordinated walkout.
it shitty because the explanation YT gave for removing it is because it causes content creators emotional issues (because cyberbullies can often dislike bomb videos and shit)
But they still show the dislike ratio to the content creators, so they can still see it and feel like shit from the anti-validation
second time he tried it though, the cops got onto him and he skipped town
and when Lustig the conman left town, and it slowly dawned on the guy that he was conned, he felt it would be too embarassing to go to the police and tell people he got double conned
one of the guys who he was selling it to, his wife got suspicious and her husband confronted him about his behavior
He just lied and said he was doing this unofficially so he could get a bribe
And the dude believed him...then went through with the deal, and PAYED THE BRIBE
yeah
guy was playing off like a government servant trying to get the Eiffel Tower sold for scrap without public attention
they know how to con people
thats the thing with conmen
yeah
love that guy
So much is pissing me off about this I don't know where to begin, or if I should even try at this point
So apparently there's people obsessed with a pornstar's new baby and making horrific joke about how he's gonna become "the most justified villain ever" because his mom is a pornstar who had onscreen relations with a black man once
oh yeah that movie from the fucking 80s, totally relevant to today's situation
how is this different from inheriting traits from your parents?
tbh, the only really harmful thing about it is the genetic offspring issue, which, I should point out, there are options available nowadays to avoid; you can just not have sex; you can do safe sex; abortion is an option; and if you want a kid, there's plenty of alternatives to the old fashion method
i'm now coming around to the idea that incest in and of itself is stigmatized for that one reason (which can be avoided if your being safe) and little else beyond oldtimey moralism
i mean it'd be nice if the pair would agree not to have sex with each other and keep it platonic. But I doubt that'd be easy to keep in check for a lot of people. 
I guess you encourage sex ed and use of protection and stuff.
yeah, the stereotype is usually between cousins
i will say that it is a grey area that leaves me confused. the big issue I see with incest is usually the fact biological offspring will have more pronounced negative traits and such, but if it isn't a het relationship, then that factor is kinda out the window. I guess its a matter of the nature of the relationship
1st one is funny
2nd one...kinda yikes
point is, if we're worried about the exceptions, keep in mind the exceptions are breaking other rules.
because in those parent/child cases, it could beconsidered pedophila/grooming or abuse
luckily in the case of those exceptions you can probably get them on trial for all the other shit
yeah we're not gonna make any excuses for any Josef Fritzl types
yeah
why bother with brainwashing when you can just go to the Stormfront forums and recruit there
its basically a waste of resources to do it
like, any system in the world can be abused, and at some point will be abused
but i feel like this is punishing everyone because a few people are assholes about it
yeah
like, here's the thing
Your parents can birth you and not control your life
Your parents can birth you and be super controlling of your life
Your parents can "design" you  and not control your life
and Your parents cand "design" you and be super controlling of your life
if you think that designer babies equate to you being "a puppet"
how do you justify natural inheritance of your parents' genes? Because by that logic your still a puppet to whatever combination of traits they have
i hate that phrase, sounds like anti-vax stuff
considering our bodies are always being "tampered with" nowadays
yeah
i can tell you man, it ain't gotten that far
and its not like your parents can predict this gene would make them into the perfect violin player
I don't know words
maybe its a return withdrawal or something?
well i haven't touched this stuff since May last year
then again i made the mistake of getting a lot of food with a lot of carbs
it may be a sideeffect
i think they're helping, because i'm being less weird when i take them
it may also be because i decided today to start taking my ADD meds again after almosst a year of not taking them
anyone else getting hit by seasonal depression? I''ve not been in a good mood all day
u sure it wasn't a weird lookign squirrel?
i mean, do you have any evidence of natural avian existence? /s
can't wait until '27 when they declassify their documents on MLK...gonna be a fun fucking time
oh, and the guy who organized it all has his name plaster on basically every FBI building
If you want proof of how shitty this country is, COINTELPRO (an FBI project to discredit and undermine black rights organizations like the Black Panthers with misinformation and organizing white supremacist organizations) was leaked in the 70s, and yet a lot fo their misinformation still permiates about the Black Panthers
well, at the very least, yesterday our government recognized a holiday honoring a civil rights icon...who was murdered by the FBI...
gotta love how the nearest major city i live to is named after our a president who literally disobeyed orders to conquer the state, then proceeded to ignore the rest of the government to *bravely* march thousands of Native Americans with no supplies west so white people could take their land, resulting in probably the worst genocide in our history...even though it hasn't been considered one until very fucking recently
wanna know whats worse though?
I'm majoring in history, which means I get to read up on all the shitty things people did before I was born
really shit politics, really shit corpos, really shit broad cultural and societal issues, and, more importantly, really shit people
oh yeah the "this is the best we could fucking do" era we are in
a bit before that but I had a moment of bizare optimism for a good while
yeah, I've had a lowkey contempt for the broad species as a hole the last few years
on top of the whole racism thing
it upsets me that its expected now a kid will get bullied because his mom is a sex worker
i kinda don't want to share the screenshot of the post in question, but its bad
on the topic of society's distorted view on sexual relationships:
A friend is telling me about some instagram group or something hyping up how some porn star's son is gonna "become the most justified racist" because his mom had sex with a black guy once and will get bullied in school for it.
either deleted by heroes or rebranded
idk I was making a joke
Yeah, find those guys to be even more annoying
Tbh the thing I see most often are the Just Causers
Tbh these guys pop in from time to time. But most of the other people there are reasonable and aren't racist
Love moderating a Civil War discord.
Guy came in like a week ago talking about how the YouTube channel the discord associates with "doesn't get political"
And today he goes on a rant about how "these cringe liberals and their buzzwords"
The mods and I have the dude a strike after he started another rant about "slavery good, achually"
just wanted to know the book
dont gib link
suace
are you getting these quotes from somewhere?
how the british started a war in order to ENFORCE an illegal drug trade
I don't count this, as the Italians, since unification, were consistently militarily incompetent
i mean, doesn't excuse the utter cringe that was the British dunking on them because the Chinese said "drugs bad"
thing is, Marx didn't invent the concept of socialism, and and though a lot of his own writings contain vague antisemetic rhetoric and subtexts, his theories were built upon by later socialist and communist thinkers
it is...an interesting set of words he uses
The kind that thinks "racist" is a "liberal buzzword"
This dude was a complete fucking edgelord
Yeah that too
Yeah there's this whole "slavery was actually benign and slave Masters would educate slaves" and shit like that
And they changed the name from Longstreet Road to Long Street. Which is still his name
So, Fort Bragg, a US army base named after a Confederate general (Braxton Bragg), changed the name of a road named from another Confederate general (James Longstreet)...and they didn't change the name of the base itself...
https://www.fayobserver.com/story/news/2022/01/19/fort-bragg-renames-roads-named-confederate-soldiers-longstreet-long-street/6562196001/
and the British and other European powers smelled blood
the Chinese at that point in time could not stop the British
it doesn't matter about "what could have been"
because the BEIC exploited their weakness and enforced an awful drug trade on China
im saying it doesn't matter for the discussion we were having
owns most of a subcontient; has its own private army and modern navy; engages in drug trafficking a century and a half before it was cool
Seriiously, the BEIC is the most Late Capitalist thing ever
Capitalists at their fullest will do whatever they can to find exploitable customers. In this case, the British East India Company exploited china through drugs
i think the point has been lost from earlier
The issue is that the East India Company enforced an Opium trade with china, and the British government enforced it through military dominance. 
It doesn't matter if China could have reofrmed itself years prior to the events which unfolded, the fact of the matter is, China was militarily behind and was dominated by Britain
Who is Nayib and why were did they keep buying Bitcoin after losing money each and every time?
gotta agree with Mel
when the heck has this "clock" ever gone back from 11?
or do I have to learn Russian in order to read these masterworks of literature?
are any of them translated?
damn
are you talking about those russian books with the covers of Soviet soldiers fighting alongside the Confederacy?
no their users do have spines
But the companies backing Youtube don't

of all the things Biden can have a spine about
i took "to not live a die" as meaning something dark
because you'll eventually get to a better day
its better to live through a bad day
Yeah, he has a track record of sticking with some of the crazy shit he says (the whole "slavery is a choice" thing he kept adding upon during his 2020 presidential run)...so let's hope for once he's as adamant about this
That or it's supposed to be "elaborate later"
Yeah I forget the dude hasn't been on meds in years so he can probably turn around and release some nft shir
Most based thing he's done since 2015

I mean we all know about rhat
I can't wait until these fucks make the national news and I have to ruin my parent's faith in humanity when I have to explain what furries are.
It's just...the most surreal shit ever
Neo-Nazi furries...
I love how that is simultaneously the most fucked up and funniest shit ever
Sent this shit to Commie Best Friend, dude couldn't be happier to see the Zuc suc
In all seriousness though I just hop in there now to view the chat and screencap some of the crazy shit these guys say
Unironixally, I joined the group in the first place because my Commie Best Friend told me it's made up of 60% fascists. Was shocked to know given his beliefs he'd genuinely hang out with people he considered a political enemy, so I checked it out
~~and that is why I am now a Nazbol~~
Well, that's the end of that Wargaming group with a bunch of Tankies and Neonazis and Balkan LARPers that I hang out with from time to time...

And on the other end of the fence
Apparently Gumroad is getting backlash because their CEO (who runs their twitter account) posted about how cool NFTs are
Amos Akerman crushed the OG klan by 1869 (before Grant fired him for investigating his railroad investments)
Then they got brought back in 1910, got widespread attention and membership in the millions through rallies and the film BIrth of a Nation (Aka the worst movie in American history)...but then they collapsed in the late twenties after one of their leaders in Indiana got involved in a sex scandal
actually the Klan has come and gone so many fucking times
tbh the KKK in the US has been on the steady decline since the 60s
The KKK thing happened in Virginia, if I'm not wrong
their leader just made a video about how awesome it is "those Australian beast" (read liberals/homosexuals) were dying in the bushfires going on
nothing outside the us
Westboro is in Kansas
yeah
Why are you asking me? You said there was an Australian KKK
but i guess that makes sense given those weird Australain far right protests of folks chanting about trump
didn't know Australia has its own KKK
Which has to have been some blueprint for how modern day far right groups coop genuine social movements and pivot themselves as the good guys
There was one incident when they were protesting a military funeral, only to be counterprotested by the fucking KKK
because they not only went after LGBT stuff but the military and other christian denominations that didn't recognize them as a legit church (which they weren't, despite their title).
but yeah they just seem to be some bizarre parody of that extreme evangelical right
i think they're mostly defunct, the guy who lead them since the 50s was ousted and died in 2014
my friend sent me clips of the founder of the Westboro Homophobes ranting about Canada and Austrialan Bushfires and shit
I don't know how those guys even function as people with the shit they spew.
Now instead of having your entire video catalogued taken down because of bullshit copyright laws from countries that shouldn't apply to you, they're now doing a region-based system
So in this case, if Toei makes a claim based on Japanese Copyright law, the videos will be blocked in Japan but not in other countries like the US
Youtube actually did something helpful for once
HOLY SHIT https://www.diyphotography.net/youtube-has-changed-how-it-enforces-fair-use-after-creator-receives-150-copyright-claims-overnight/
I can't wait to wake up one of these days and no longer be in clown world
I couldn't sleep until 2:30 last night
why they doin this?
i love so many historians and folks defending him about the screening saying "Oh he was just doing it because it was the big cultural phenomena, it doessn't represent his views" when the movie straight up quotes his historical work from when he was a Professor at Yale
Of course, because of Goering's prewar connections, the Nazis were way more hands off on industrial output than they should have been.
And you have some factionalism amongst his senior lieutenants. Goebbels was obsessed with class shit in his propoganda pieces; part of the reason Erwin Rommel has the stature he does as a general is because Goebbels found him more relatable as a middle class man turned officer than the junker aristocrats who generally weren't outwardly supportive of Nazi ideology
There were some socialist principles behind the Nazis, though that's because Nazi ideology is just a chimera born from some failed Austrian painter obsessed with a former Italian socialist
So...my Texas friend is having an interesting time at college. Apparently his professor got fired and is being investigated because she used a racist student's paper as an example for an upcoming assignment.
it k
What are you talking about?
because he had to make the clarification because he makes 6 hour vids about how the Nazis actually were socialists
Dude made a video last week titled "Leftist aren't stupid, actually"
Tbh, I should have known better because I'm refering to TIK of all fucking people
tfw the history youtuber you've been following and supporting for three years releases a new video going on a rant about how the British "helped civilize" India...
I still doubt theyll actually go in at this rate
that's two affluent pedos who "killed themselves" in jail before they could testify, and the cameras in their cells were conveniently not working...interessting
https://twitter.com/TheInsiderPaper/status/1495012904248168452?t=7R4W5YUWxlS-V8a-CpbzVw&s=19
of course i doubt literally any of these guys will legit abandon "the cause" because of this. they'll wake up tommorrow and rationalize it and move on with their shitty actions...because that's just the benchmark for the average person
don't you love how many people today tie their morality to random celebrities and politicians and folks siding with or against something?
Being told that your actions are going to bite everyone in the ass in the longrun doesn't phase them, but they flee the moment that some controversial fuckface back their cause
you get them from time to time, often from silicon sobs obsessed with how "modern" and "developed" China's economy is.
but its a game of pedantry at this point.
yeah
One end does, usually the far-right wing sources that see China (for some fucking reason) as a Red menance
No
Thing is though, I don't think China has been given as much attention compared to Russia for their violations of human rights
I will say, I agree with McCullough on the Falun Gong bullshit being bullshit
I'll give you that
With the caveat it was Bush's idea, and Bush is literally the reincarnation of Hitler
Know literally nothing about it
can you honestly give example on how "the west" is worse than modern PRC China?
Love to hear your take on the Uighers...
yeah, because fascists TOTALLy wouldn't implement social credit point systems or repress literally any organization that isn't approved by the state
State capitalism, at least the repressive one they practice, is essentially facism
when its a hypocritical stand thats convinient for the current international stage
you say this as if they genuinely believe in that set of words
yeah this all is just a cold political ploy on the PRC's part
I don't really support fascists getting a W...
I always assume the British are lying. Can't trust a single oen of them
I should point out my position. 
I'm not saying unregulated gun ownership good. More a necessary evil that should be exized once all of the problems of state terror and institutional racism of our police force is solved
They'll do it even if there isn't a gun present, but if they "think" there is one
https://youtu.be/n7Rm3tuMFTI
America's banned drugs list is delusionally terrible unless you considered the top rated drugs on the list all happen to be used primarily by the black community
Started in the US by Nixon and...Reagan
And on the whole "The police militarized because people had guns":
The police was militarized as part of the Wars of Drugs and Terror and all these other policies that disproportionately target minorities in my country. When you have institutions that enact violence against certain people, those people will have two options: defend themselves, or get pushed over and hope you don't get shot over nothing. 
In the case of minority protection, I support gun rights, if nothing more than a stopgap measure before we can even get in position to TRY and dismantle multiple racist institutions and policies that have formed the backbone of the US for decades to centuries
I'm anti Reagan so sorry, I support the Panthers on this topic
Yup
And conservatives changed their views quite rapidly after all those violent shooting committed by "misunderstood" white guys
Yup, that shit happened
was talking to a history professor of mine about the current state of affairs, he said something along the lines of "The Democrats are clinging onto this ideal of 'the right side of history' that the Prohibitionists and Eugenicists thought they were on".
don't you love it when both of your political parties pretend to stand for different shit but in the end are the same neo-liberal party with different brandings? Love it
yeah, I see that whole angle of "China is the threat" crowd to be gigacringe
And its always Russia's fault whenever Trump got votes or that one star wars movie got review-bombed
yeah, plus the Tet Offensive depleted the Vietcong's leadership and manpower, and took a long time to recover
~~and better artists~~
Literally just Japan without the abhorrent warcrimes
Vietnam definitely
Also based for beating china in a one on one war three years after unification, and then destroying the Khmer Rouge
Yeah, of all the Communist regimes of the period Communist Vietnam's was the most tame
Yeah no, the British would have defeated the rebels within a year if it weren't for French intervention
Yeah wouldnt count that in hypothetical American civil war
Compared to now where revolutionary or terrorist groups will bank on some sense that their people are being attacked by some assumetrically stronger neighbor to Garner support from the international community
Oh yeah the 1800s, back when the average European couldn't give a shit about anyone who wasn't white...and even then they though their neighbors were subhuman
If a revolution occurs in America, do you expect that the revolutionaries WOULDNT smuggle AT weapons in? In addition to (potentially) parts of the army flipping or foreign aid from certain countries that don't necessarily support the US government
It'll be a matter to see how enthused they'll be once things get underway
It's the big wigs who will what the army to fight tooth and nail for this ploy
I think the point still stands
assume the subheadline is refering to this
dude's a history professor and somehow thinks:
1.) Biden was in power in 2014 (he was only Obama's VP)
2.) That the US did fuck all to punish Russia for Crimea (apparently sanctions don't count)

of course, the general public who know fuck all about such movements just see a bunch of angry people running around in all black outfits looking scary and beating up people (though that's only a specific faction in the movement that does that shit, theyre the ones that get the media attention)
black has long been the color for anarchism, with red having been the color of revolutionaries since the 1848 revolutions
reminder that Nazis don't have copyright priveleges on those colors for political identity
Its his only expansion route
Yeah
https://twitter.com/spectatorindex/status/1495937013052489729?s=21
some people just don't read or pay attention
the fact i instictively check the url to see how this is definitely a scam link, shows just how bad it is
And Russia doesn't do powerprojection in its neighbors either? Belarus, Kazahkstan and Ukraine would like to talk to you
You could have said Iraq and had a better point, but no, you say Afghanistan as if that's one of the harder ones to justify
we failed in the long term on the former, and in the short term on the latter
we invaded to topple them and track down Bin Laden
Afghanistan was an invasion to topple a government which was suppporting and providing safe haven for Al-Quada
America rn sucks but if you legit think its fucking worse than Putin's Russia, that's the saddest shit I've heard in a good while
Putin has enforced homophobic policies and all of his major political opponents seem to mysterious die whenever elections roll around
Not gonna lie, funniest conversation I've had all week
I always wondered what Chamberlain sounded like in conversation
"I know this country is literally attempting to invade another country, but the US should fix itself before it helps others"
we'll negotiate after Putin is deposed
Honestly, don't give Putin an inch of respect. Fucker doesn't deserve it
if we were trying to negotiate with the Russians, maybe. But at this rate Putin's put his foot down, and US policy is in "fuck Putin" gear, so there's no need to give a shit in this case
tbh we're dealing with the quintisential reactionary dictator here (dare I call him a fascist)
if he can't take banter, he should probably stop doing those shirtless photoalbums
because this is the 21st century, professionalism is nothing more than a suggestion these days
its a meme tweet during a heated crisis, I wouldn't expect nuance
when it was the seat of a major civilization long before Moscow was (even if they're both technically the same people)
at least they're trying to stunt on a literal tyrant's bullshit arguments for why their own fucking country he wants to invade doesn't have history
as always history is gonna become a political weapon
its nationalist dickmeasuring, its not gonna be nuanced
also may be a jab at Putin's assertions that Ukraine is "a fiction" nation
the point is: "We're cool, you suck"
Thank god the Republicans dropped the facade and are just honest about being batshit psychos
dude got called out by other History youtubers for this stupidity
Dug up the tweet, this is what he says after... https://twitter.com/Cynical_History/status/1496022352618229762?s=20&t=8OpfiW2NR9oSKKKVAFf9gA
fine by me
not saying that US is clean
point still stands
yeah
by this logic other countries are allowed to not hand Nazi officials over to Israel for prosecution
and to answer an earlier question: zero Afghanis civilians deserved to die in that war. Like how zero Russians deserve to die in the war with Ukraine...their leaders however are the problem, the exception, and the target
idk...the guys in power who refuse to hand over the guys bragging about how they did 9/11...
there's a lot of shit you can blame the US for in regards to the "War on Terror" and on and on. But holy fuck, this is just bad faith bullshit
its pretty stupid to fucking blame the US for 9/11. There were signs but few really realized the scope of the operation. I hear a bunch of shit blaming Bush's CIA director for not putting the pieces of intel together to figure out what was going on, but all he had to go on was a couple saudi guys taking flight lessons. At the end of the day, its the fault of Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda that 9/11 was planned and went through; as the Nazis are at fault for WW2 starting despite oppurtunities for them to be stopped beforehand.
yeah, because when Carter and Reagan funneled moeny to Al Qaeda (as well as the bevy of other religious extremist groups fighting in the conflict against the Soviets), they weren't thinking in terms of "these guys will do 9/11".
just so they wouldn't piss off France and Britain, who would theoretically be their primary trade partners after the conflict
really their downfall was continuing the war and launchign the Kerensky offensive when it was so unpopular
i don't think its likely Putin WILL be overthrown or cowed by his own people. I just know that you can't assume the world works on mathmatical macro formulas that guarantee a certain outcome will happen given x-y-z factors.
that is also a likely outcome
Given Russia's shakey economic condition, and the lukewarm attitudes of the Russian people towards this crisis, its not garunteed but a non-zero chance there would be siginifcant social unrest in the country
not exactly sanctions, but sanction-esque conditions
what brought down the Tsars was an ongoing war, which was resulting in high expedatures for weaponry for their underequipped soldiers; the closing of important shipping lanes through the Baltic and Black Sea further denying the Russians of import commodities; and the poor socio-economic conditions of the empire from before the war and now exacerbated by it, resulted in a popular uprising against the Tsarists
one deposed the Tsar and put in a Provisional Democratic government, the second deposed that government and replaced it with a Communist one
There were actually TWO revolutions in 1917
Alright, you have to actually be shitting me
Russia was struggling through the Crimea sanctions (before Trump started buddybuddying with Putin and easing them)
economic collapse is what ended the Tsars
I think a direct invasion of Russia by US troops to take out the government would end in the death of humanit
when I said "don't give Putin any respect and let him get deposed" I meant "sanction Russia and pressure them to the point of deposing Putin"
alright then
but you seem to be really obsessed that the US should spend time during this crisis "looking inward" when it for once needs to be involved in foreign affairs
And I don't mean direct intervention, primarly want sanctions
then why are you so against the US intervening now to stop Putin's imperialism?
cool
How many Ukrainians should die because of the Russian Seperatists and Russian invasion?
Tbh, the Iraq one is worse, was done on the shakiest of excuses (trumped up documents about WMD; implications that Hussein, a secularist dictator who persecuted religious extremist, was harboring religious extremist terrorists; etc)
Because of the Taliban
Also, Bin Laden during that time WAS in Afghanistan, until 2002 when he escaped because Rumsfeld was against using our own ground troops to do the task
they could have handed them over to face international court, but they dug in their heels
they were actively protecting the people who fucking committed the 9/11 attacks
Bin Laden was responsible for the fucking 9/11 attacks, and fucking proudly proclaimed it
There's zero fucking grey in that fucking instant
if they had the resources too, I have zero doubt Russia under Putin WOULD try to do the shit the US does
yeah, because Russia's a secondary power, and can't project as much as the US or even China
why, I literally just did
I honestly should have realize your a joke after you couldn't tell that black was an anarchist color...or when you couldn't differentiate between the two Russian Revolutions...or all the stupid shit about the "evil" US needing to "look inward" rightnow instead of helping Ukraine against actual fascism...or all the times you've goalposted the conversation with whataboutisms instead of addressing the fucking problem at hand.
(which was just victim blaming minorities for arming themselves against an already abusive system)
seriously, you had a whole hoopla the otherday about the 2nd Amendment and how that only was bringing about more state violence
honestly, people are being murdered by the state in times of "peace". What does it matter if they're doing it in a war?
but if its to topple the "Evil American Empire", whats the matter?
no
as you've said earlier, America needs to focus on fixing its own problems before it can help topple tyranical governments
Well, that isn't happening without a major upheaval, which an invasion would bring
All the better if Israel wins and forces the US to change the system completely
I've been having a fuck ton of depressive episodes as of recently, and especially so last night. I've been taking a creative writing course at college and have been doing a lot more writing about my personal life, entirely becaause its the easiest and quickest for me to get done, it seems. But that's starting to open up old wounds and hangups inside me I thought I'd moved past since I started feeling general emotional/mental bliss all of last year. 
On the upside I've done a lot more classwork and personal work than I had in times prior, but I feel like I'm in a worse general state, because I'm digging up and revisiting old projects which I had put a lot of personal emotions into, and that's been bringing me down further.
Idk if I want to elaborate or go into further detail because its stuff I'm not entirely comfortable sharing with yall yet, i don't think at least. But I feel like I'm just regressing mentally back to my high school/early College days, which I've seen as my "emotionally unstable douchebag years" as if I'm not still that in some way still.
And then you look at the wars with Israel and how lopsided those were
"once"
because people forget all those Soviet tanks Arab armies have been fighting with for over half a century and always lose in battle against Western tanks, without exception
yeah, that is the case
but the problem is the LazerPig loop: everytime Russian military equipment is proven to be inadequate in modern times, after some time has passed and the general public forgets things, "military analysts" like Pierre Sprey will eventually keep making the same bullshit statements about Russian superiority and shit over US equipment
someone else here watches Lazerpig
the 1920-21 Polish War, the Russo-Japanese War, Finland, Afghanistan, the Crimean War (when they attacked the Ottomans before Allied intervention arrived)
Russia has historically been shit at winning offensive wars
Maybe he'll insist on those two Novorossiya states being recognized but not expanding their borders much, and keep Crimea
Think it will end in a Winter War situation where Putin will "win" but his initial losses will be so heavy and embarassing he can't really negotiate for all the stuff he actually wants
I'd say it will go on another month, give or take
I hope not
because jesus fuck
wait...did they actually
Good news. My college has free mental health care on campus. I'll check in when I return to campus after break and see if they can help
Ok. I'll put on Wish You We're Here and sleep to that.
I may just tell my folks in the morning I'm going through depressive episodes and probably go see a psychologist to work things out
I thought it'd be easy to go to sleep...but it's clear that's no longer in the cards given my mental state.
I'd 100% slam that button right now. But i dont know if I would have even three months ago. I was fine with being who I was then. But the this year I go to college, take a writing course, and totally on me, I remind myself of an old poetry freak girl I knew from Highschool who I thought I'd gotten over...but I still have not. Is it just depression and self loathing that is making me feel like this? I am crying too much to actually go to sleep rn
I'm pissed off right now. I was earlier when it happened, but I think now that I've had time to mull over what happened, I'm kinda angry. I hope I get an actual response from you guys on this, because as fucking angry I am with you guys right now, I know no one else to talk to regarding what I'm going through right now:
I don't know what I am anymore. I've made seemingly joking comments in the art sections about wanting to be the women in those artworks; most if not all of those were serious. before my 2021 window of happiness and after that, I've had insecurities about being a guy, specifically because I never succeed in forming intimate romantic relationships with anyone.
I remember like a week back thinking of sending a dm to a male classmate of mind asking if he would be down with gay sex. I don't think I'm gay, I don't think I see most men in a sexual manner, but I'm starting to think that's the only way I can "be a girl". 
Why do I think that? Maybe its because my image of women has been warped by my internet usage and my own self-loathing to have some weird standards for existence, that it'd somehow be better for me to be a woman than a man. 
I don't think I want a sex change, as I'm still not secure on anything about myself. Besides, even if I was, I'd be going through hell not just through the medical stuff I'd have to do, but the fact I have a conservative family who I doubt would accept me if it turned out I'm a girl or whatever I am; and that's a no go because my family is literally the only anchor of stability in my life, and I don't want them to turn on me. 
If this is too rambling or if I brushed past shit I should have elaborated on, I'm sorry, I'm tired, I'm pissed off, I'm depressed and kinda want to die. Listening to Laurie Anderson's "O Superman" for the first time right before writing this is not helping. 
I'm gonna go to sleep, hope I feel more stable in the morning. Respond away, I can't take silence or ignorance anymore.
this is probably the shittiest Spring Break I've ever experienced
holy shit
Tbh the constant shifting out of presidents has resulted in really schizophrenic foreign policy which has done nothing but diminish the US's international reputation. We go from having cordial relations with Putin during the Bush43 years to the "Great Reset" of Obama to cordial relations under Trump to Biden's antagonisms. Gaddhafi was backed by Bush43, only for Obama to help support rebels to dethrone him and start a civil war.
i can say there have been negative moments from people on this server I've experienced (including stuff I've said and done which I regret)
I'm actually concerned now because they drop this in this channel
yeah
(partly because they push Trump propaganda)
So I don't trust it
Tbh it's yahoo news
I mean, people survived that JAL crash in the 80s
this isn't helping me at all
yeah
I know these people better than you fucking do
shut up, don't say it won't be a problem
but fuck
honestly thats on my end for beign stupid about things
its not hard to figure out my irl name
and I don't want any of it to go public
because they got some fucked shit on me
whats worse is that because of stupid shit i did back on that server, I don't want to piss them off
honestly It may have been a mistake for me to show this dm
no
he and everyone else on that server is
oh yeah
https://i.imgur.com/Hj19uEE.png
lets just say I've moved past that shit
I don't want to say honestly
but yeah I had been on his server at the same time I was with this server, and it took me some time to realize the transphobic bullshit they were spouting was...bullshit
with him or the other members
I left the old server without saying a word becausse I didn't want any drama about it
nah
i just randomly got a dm from an old transphobic friend trying to link me to his new server
and there is the crux of the fucking problem
trying to "act with no distintiveness" means your repressing yourself emotionally and turning yourself into a mental emotional timebomb, which explodes at unwanted intervals like you are here
My recommendation: stop drinking, realize "yeah, I fucked that up", move forward and do better. And trust me, if your problem is losing friends, you can always make new ones. But you won't if you shut down like this
like you did here
because you derail conversations to make everything about yourself
but honestly all I remember from the RWBY CRTC days was just yellig and assholes and just pain
well if we want to get into anime fantoxicity I can only speak to really speak in regards to the RWBY comminty
I remember calling out one asshole critic I knew from one of the OG CRTC servers for making fun of the new episode despite not seeing it, and he turned it around to accuse me of having been banned for doing heinous shit to underaged girls on that server (which wasn't the case on any fucking level)
of course I wouldn't be here iff I hadn't met certain friends in those old cringo communities who got me to watch symphogear
like I always had this preconception back in the days that if your server was built around a topic, it would be super biased to one side of the fandom and would not be kind to disenting opinions about it
because this is the first time I've come to a pre-built community that isn't overrun by assholery and hasn't gone hard into some "camp" in the fandom
seriously, thank you for that
honestly though, in terms of toxic communities, I got a hard choice on narrowing down anything. But generally all the RWBY Critic Discord servers and other groups were fucking crazy
partly because i was still an unhinged asshole who didn't know how to act on discord before but also because there were just so many factions and dramas and shitshows and hateful crap they get into
Idk why Yugiho community = racists is so funny to me
ok I need to know more
what?
gnite
but I still fucking hate how all that shit in between happened
honestly, since I brought it up, I find it wierd how all the crap I've experienced in my life led me to the positive times I've had on this server
I can probably tie it all the way back to me discovering Red vs. Blue in 2011
And I get the feeling that I wouldn't have gotten to this point if it weren't for every step
funny part was, I when I brought it up to other RWBY CRTCs who had worked with him, they said "oh, he's a joke, no one here supports him", when on the samme day this shit goes down on twitter, Fatmanfalling tweets about how the guy gets "harassed" by asshole fans who don't know what they're talking about.
but even if its true WHAT A FUCKING TAKE
i haven't heard this shit
nephew of Cenk Uiger, founder of The Young Turks
Hasan himself is a political streamer, but to be more specific, is a grifter with stans almost at Dream levels of toxicity and defensiveness
As a longtime sub of her, its great to see her being more confident about discussing stuff like this. Remembering back when she did the "face reveal" video where she discussed her self image and bulemia issues (and apparently the reason she made the video was because some assholes knowingly posted selfies with her at vidcon, after she asked them specifically not to without editing them...whcih she did for them but they went "nah, we'll just post the raw photo that reveals your face to the world, even though you don't want it to")
except both of them are shit rappers
he's like the reverse of Eminem
Yeah
and now we are getting a bunch of edgelord "artists" like Takashi69 and Tom McDonald who make their entire persona being the most unrepentant piece of shit imaginable, and they're making bank off of their antics
Cosby fell under the bus because by the point joe public learned about his shit, the dude's career was already in the shadows. Meanwhile people like Chris Brown are still around despite the awful shit they've committed because they're still making money
though that also bring up the other aspect
whatever the case, he was the subject of a lengthy trial that all but proved what a scumbag he is and he's not gonna recover any of his public stature from before
i thought he was sent to jail?
the only time I can recall people being successfully cancelled have been when they get put in jail, like Cosby or Weinstein, and those often had little to do with the public campaigns against them
yeah, thats the crux of the issue with Cancelling someone. It rarely works, as there's always chuds willing to back and support the person being cancelled
literally the most cathartic moment in hollywood since...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJoMtruQA0A
For context: Chris' joke was about Jada Smith's hair loss condition which was apparently really tramatic for her (I'm not on celebrity gossip and shit, I just asked someone who cared and told me this, so may be wrong)
A part of me remembers the first time I heard about him when he dropped the immortal line: "America deserved 9/11"
And wonders how he still had afucking career after that
But then I remember Alex Jones is still around
but once he starts doing extremist politics in the 20s and making "political attacks" on jews and communists andother oppoennts in the street, yeah, after that point you can safely say "yeah, fuck this man"
I am not for the "kill baby hitler" camp of philosphoy, because he didn't have become the most evil man in hisotry
ok
oh
are we talking about hasan here? to claariify
because he's spreading misinformation and justifying the action of an authoritarian dictator to an impressionable audience
that doesn't excuse the shit he's said here
and?
https://youtu.be/Gg0OWPjdLzU
its only justifiable if you have plans of militaristic expansion
"You being upset about the Crimean annexation doesn't stop it from being a justifyiable act"
Is this dude still in highschool?
this
Hasan is just scum, plain and simple
"Well, even if he's an authoritarian dictator who has brought Democracy in the country to an end through harassment and assassination; even if he's propping up other reactionary dictatorships in neighboring countries; even if he is repressing freedoms in his own country; even if he's invading a soveriegn nation and claiming creepy shit about how they're history as a people outside of his imperialistic vision is a fiction.
He's not built death camps yet, so he's still the good guy against this country that has unit made up of far right assholes fighting for them"
https://i.imgur.com/9hK4y9q.png
the fact that oligarchs are still around, the fact the Russian military is only able to "upgrade" their equipment by one unit per year, a lot of the Russian tanks captured missing equipments because corrupt officers have apparently been selling electronics and shit on the black market, really makes me question how much Putin has "improved" the economy
Has he really? Or is that all "necessary dictator" propoganda? Because the Russian economy has proven to be quite fragile none-the-less
All this is is deranged legalize to post-hoc justify continuing the invasion
Yeah, this doesn't mean every Russian in the US or other countries will rise up as sleeper agents of Putin
While i see the connection between Scott and being the most blatantly corrupt bastard politician, I don't know how this is supposed to make him look good

im never going to Mellow Mushroom again
thing is my dorm area's club house has a free gym area with exercise equipment i can use but just have been too lazy
basically
aside from walk to class...after driving most fo the way
no
since January
i've been on this diet for months
add on top of this blue bell chocolate chip cookie dough icecream every night after dinner
but last Friday i got leftover pizza from Mellow Mushroom that i ate for Breakfast lunch and dinner the next two days
oh fucking boy:
Breakfast: Chocholate muffins; if i feel like variety, go to waffle house and get waffles
Lunch: Sandwich, chips and raisins
Dinner: chicken strips or macncheese (hopefully with carrots)
i think my heart rate is up too
the area around my heart feels like its gonna implode into a black hole of nothingness
I've been indulging myself a lot
I don't think you understnad
No
yes its today
Like, I'm having trouble standing up just by looking at the food i have
I think i need to change my diet because I feel like the next bite i take out of this cake i got for my birthday will give me an actual heart attack
basic rutine since middle school (shivers in memory of middle school)
eat, shower, brush teeth etc
yes
and just not get any milk or shit like that
current plan is to go to walmart tommorrow and get eggs and bacon for breakfast
I remember eating a slice for breakfast and nearly passing out as i was getting into the shower
so every attack on him is now an attack on Russia
because Putin's a cult-of-personality style dictator whose done everything in his power to tie his existence with that of russia
yeah
I hope the fucking ringleaders of these massacre are brought before international tribunals and given their punishment, whether execution or life in prison, but just because the bad guys are committing warcrimes doesn't mean you should do warcrimes in exchange. Becuase that never ends well for either side
"those people over there are inherently eveil anyway, and so I hope that they suffer"
I really hope you realize why people have a problem with your stance on things
considering a lot of those soldiers are conscripts who don't seem to want to actually fight this war, I'm putting this under "yikes"
this
yeah, because people thought that was a bullshit excuse...until the Milgram experiment in the 60s
I'm not saying people SHOULDNT be tried here
oh wait, THAT iS A FUCKING THING
yeah, because its not like most people in authoritarian organizations will  just follow orders rather than taking a stand against people with power over their lives...
This is why I'm angry with what youve been saying Kat
BECAUSE THEY CONSCRIPT
all for something THEY HAVE NO FUCKING CHOICE IN BEING INVOLVED IN OR NOT
or any other permanent life problems
yeah, totally isn't gonna result in vigilante attacks on people who aren't involved in any of the massacres
He's spent a lot of the last few post lowkey dehumnaizing large swaths of people based on the people in positions of power
Well, Kat's rhetoric thus far is leading in that fucking direction
Kat, have you heard of the fucking Milgram Experiment
once again: misinformation and decades of propoganda by Putin's regime
I have little problem with this stance.
But your not responding to my criticisms of your stance of "All these conscripted soldiers who have little clue what is happening and are being forced to fight this stupid war, are warcriminals"
It'd be nice to see poland or another local power to get involved without sparking nuclear war
that I'm kinda fine with, the economic retaliation (and of Course Ukraine's continuing military eefforts)
"I don't think he's playing 6d chess anymore. I think he's just stupid"
yeah does Australia have an actual "liberal" party equivalent (and are theycalled the Tories)
reminds me of how we know about certain crimes Japanese soldiers committed in China in the 37-45 war, because an officer involved in them kept sending his wife super descriptive letters about all the shit he did because he thought it was cool
Or how much we know of the Armenian Genocide is because certain Turkish officers couldn't stop bragging about it in their memoirs
Evil is arrogant
Based
But the thing is, that's the arguments I kept hearing in the early part of the invasion.
Like, comparing the war to the US Invasion of Iraq as if somehow that doesn't make it bad
yeah thats true
i entirely imagine Russian state media comparing it to "War Dubya got the US involved in and did awful shit in #58" and find and an equevalent and say "Yeah, you people were nazis for doing that...but for some reason that doesn't apply to us"
because Putin's made some bull about threatening other countries with nukes if they intervene
And given how fucking erratic and irrational this whole invasion has been, no one wants to discount it entirely
what next
done
ok
yes
Like, before it wa today? How do i do that?
how do i reset my computer to an earlier state?
ok
ok
maybe its a different thing alltogether?
never saw that
no
or some shit
I feel like I should freeze my bank account asap
what should I fucking do?
i crave fucking death rn
and turns out the dude got hacked
a guy i considered a friend asked me to test out his project
absolutely was
it was
https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/01/13/snake-alert-this-ransomware-is-not-a-game/
there was just the setup program (which I have deleted immediately)
or at least nothing else "recent"
but nothing shows up in my downloads there
I have a download folder, yes
FAST
please somebody help
I uninstalled the setup, but since i went and did the download, and can't find what it put on my computer, whatever virus it is is still on here
So, old friend dm'd me out of the blue asking me to test out some school project of his. Gave me a link to some "snake game" thing. I was like, ok, ill test this out
Pull it up, google gives me a warning that it can't scan whatever it is for virus, but I ignore this, after all, its from a friend, its his project, I trust him. 
Download it, its jsut the set up. Go through the setup process, hit finish...and get nothing. Go through the set up process, hit finish...and nothing happens
I dm him this (because he wanted feedback)
ANd his response is "OH FUCK I GOT HACKED!"
didn't know someone who writes about the holocaust can be a douchebag
You know, without being a fucking nazi
didn't know the book had backlash
All I know about it was from seeing it on a library shelf in elementary school.
"You're not Jewish, your the devil"
...
Oh God, I haven't seen one of those ads in a LONG time
Also have seen them put up a MrBeast scam channel as an advertisement
Same,
Had a 3 minute add for Botox on a 50 SECOND VTUBRR CLIP
Which is funny because these guys run off the argument "Oh the mainstream isnt supporting us" when YouTube runs their ads
And his shit is being fucking advertised
I was like "is this some Tropico-esque game?" But no it's chud politics
Tim Pool's chud channel
Got a three minute skippable add while watching YouTube. Looked like some fancy add for some action game with some dictator character or something. I look it up...
It's a fucking Timcast ad.
all the ethnic germans and poles and such all left (willingly or but mostly unwillingly) for their respective postwar countries around 1945-1946
yeah that too
because while the latter is not so likely, i doubt that Kaliningrad can exist as an independent country
question is, would they become an independent small state like Luxembourg? Or get absorbed into Poland or whoever?
i mean...i didn't know there was an independence movement there
sure
(aslo got Malwarebytes to do the scan while we talk)
this is what i got

Honestly I never feel you overreact to anything unless you get self aware and overreact to overreacting
honestly wish I knew what you are talking about
CIA is a terorist organization
The general public believes pedophilia = bad, therefore, the general public is forcing their laws against pedophilia upon us
Thats the logic  here
*oh you see, it is tyranny of the masses, because if everyone else is FORCING their values upon you, that's tyrrany*
yeah, considering how poorly prepared Argnetina was for the original invasion of the Falklands, I don't see how today's Argentina can do the same thing again
>Goes on and on about how the other guys are evil Nazi Fascists
>Declares war and pushes out propoganda to try and reunite "the old country"
>COmmits horrific warcrimes against civilian populations
I honestly would compare them to Serbia in the Yugoslav Wars more than anything else
i dont understand why one would think Putin at this points would be down for genuine negotiations that wouldn't leave Ukraine a rump puppet state
The guy in the video pointed out that Putin's (and by extent actual Neo-Nazi's) argument assumes that Poland had no reason to be fearful of being invaded by two powers which historically had subjegated them for over a century, and one of whom had FUCKING INVADED THEM AND ATTEMPTED TO SUBJEGATE POLAND INTO THEIR NATION LESS THAN TWO DECADES AGO
Dude unironically criticized the Poles for signing a halfassed non-aggression pact...but doesn't apply the same distaste when the Soviets did it...and brushes off the issue of the secret protocols by sayign "well, if the western archives opened up, maybe we'd find out about the secret protocols that THEY TOTALLY put in their treaties"
Someone sent me a video of a guy debunking the claim and pointing out how Putin literally copy pasted actual Neo-Nazi cope material 
And yet Putin and the Russian government push the narrative that the Ukrainians are Nazis?
Remember how Putin back in 2020 said Poland was to blame for WW2 because of their "aggressive" foreign policy (instead of, you know, the Nazis?)
i never have windows explorer running
it finally loaded in. Restarted 3 times. Loaded in the actual stuff after 3 minutes
I hope my computer is not caput
Like, logged in, and all I can do is move around my cursor on a black screen
So, got an update on my laptop. Logged in to work on homework...and all I got is a black screen of nothing
somehow there's zero to none of that here (since he's talking about Neo-Nazi and holocaust denial stuff, which he's otherwise fantastic about despite, well, his diagnostics on Nazism)
I say this as someone who likes his content: about 10-20% of the time (usually when he's discussing politics between Marxism, Socialism, Nazism etc), dude is a fucking idiot
Also he did a video about Indian troops in WW2 which he started out by calling Indian people racist and implying that the Raj actually benefitted India
And made a 6 hour video about it where he cites a Sargon stream and PragerU
Dude says the Nazis were socialists
(this is one of his saner and least ideaologically driven videos)
Yes
Warning: TIK

Idk why this point has to be clarified as speech against large corporate entities should also apply in cases like this
its literally in the name
Western "Civilization" in a nutshell
funniest shit I''ve heard all week
I'd say though the problems of the Russian Federation had a lot to do with how Glastnost was implemented and that the people who gained all the staterun industries in the aftermath were all corrupt assholes
yeah
honestly, as someone symphathetic to the prinicples of communist (or at least Marxist socialism), I think trying to bring back the trainwreck that was the USSR a terrible idea
I think a lot of these Tankies see Putin as the advance guard for a new USSR because the way he has acted has all been wanting to bring back Soviet-era prestige and power. Hence why he constantly refers to Ukraine as "a fiction" and blames Poland for starting World War 2. because thats all Soviet dogwhistling. Hence why he tries to portray his fight against Ukraine as a war against "Fascists"
Now, for my next topic
YouTube Advertised this shit
Cool
This may just be coming from someone morally repulsed by the amount of warcrimes the leaders of my country have gotten away with without condemnation or trial, from the shit we've done in WW2, Vietnam, Iraq, Latin America, and elsewhere
Point I want to make is:
Russia deserves the full blame for starting this war, for all the shady repressive shit they do to their own people and other neighboring countries to keep them in line, and the various warcrimes they have commited this far in the war. I will be happy to see the ringleaders and generals and politicians and oligarchs responsible for all this evil put before international law. And Ukraine deserves the full support and backing of the world against Putin's regime.
I don't want this war to be brought to a standstill and Ukraine condemn for potential warcrimes of their own. But when the dust is settled, the international community needs to set a fucking better standard than "Rules for Thee but Not for Me" in regards to war crimes. If there is a fair investigation of these incidents, even if they find no wrongdoing on the fault of the Ukrainian commanders involved, I'd be satisfied with that
Oh...so to excuse warcrimes of our allies, cool
Why would anyone bring up such an obscure piece of law to suggest such a fucking thing
And Guantanamo has been around as a terrorist prison since 9/11
Abhu Ghraib was in 04
And has it EVER been brought up in a case like this?
Because I don't recall any sane human being (note: Neocon Republican diehards ARENT sane human beings) justify Abu Ghraib or the torture we do in places like Guantanamo are "justified" because of 9/11 or any other terrorist attack against the US
Well, I'll ask you this: name one Human Rights or Rules of War Treaties that has this principle enshrined
Reading up on this Wikipedia article and NOWHERE does it even suggest that you are allowed to commit warcrimes on another countries if they do it first
Didn't Berlusconi get into office because he ran Italy's biggest TV network and ran ads with Italian mothers singing about how amazing he is?
Why tf does Putin go so hard for Stalin larp?
genuinely shocked my dad wants to vote De Santis for Pres 2024
aside from that, yeah, Red State Shithole
the only positive going for florida is that our minimum wage is still being gradually increased (not great but its better than my previous home state of Georgia, which is still somehow WAY below the Federal standard)
as the resident Floridans: Fuck De Santis
tbh the real deterent that prevented any western power from really clamping on North Korea is because its a buffer state for China
unless you know an "obvious" case or something similar
"Don't fight us or we will nuke you", never hear that shit directed towards a non-nuclear country by a nuclear armed country
I'm not
I cannot recall a previous instance in human history where a country with nukes threatens another without nukes with a nuclear annihilation if they fight them
But Putin a month back was in crying wojack mode and threatening any country that intervenes to help Ukraine would get nuked
no they haven't used them

Remember when that one Massachusetts governor wrote that Pink Swastika book? Sad fucking times we be in
Can't wait until America finally demilitarizes it's budget by the 2080s
You know what I kinda hate about how the war has gone?
The fact that Russia's military deficiency is gonna be used to justify the US's continuous overbudgeting of the military.
Apparently since WW2 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Vatutin
There's a reason the current generation generally doesn't trust them unlike the boomers
Yeah mainstream news media on TV and such desire people's attention so they almost to a t push the most extreme end of a spectrum on somethinh
Yeah, Palpatine was based on Nixon

I think the general fatalities thing is more due to an attempt to boost morale at the front, by having generals go to harms way and "share the danger" with the men. It was common for some countries like the US and Germany and especially the Soviet Union in WW2. I think the Wehrmacht lost more generals to car crashes than actual combat
And holy fuck would I prefer (gun to my head I have to pick between them) another 4 years of Trump than the actual fascist running my state
the only guy I've seen parrotted around as a potential for 2024 besides trump is fucking DeSantis
Remember in Afghanistan when the CIA funnelled stinger missles into the hands of the Mujahaden against the Soviets? That totally didn't backfire
I want my country to just...die
The judges didn't actually say that, it's just shit made up by the writers to prove a point
FYI the Onion is a news parody publication
You know that the Spanish monarchs put him under arrest after finding out the shit he did in Feedinandia? Arguing he had "no choice" and was "working with what he is given" is pretty disgusting sentiment to have regarding what he did
Fuck him unironically
Yeah no Columbus started the fucking Triangle Trade
No, they remember it and want to revert back to before women had rights
SCOTUS still be like
https://youtu.be/Hyph_DZa_GQ
yeah
oh yeah, got my racist senators mixed up, my bad, we got a lot of them
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd
the longest one every was back in the 50s when a fucking klansman filibustered a civil rights bill
Biden attended his funeral as a pallbearer
filibuster is when a senator goes on a never ending rant of literally nothing so a bill cannot be voted on
Honestly I don't want to see that.
Can we please have Civil War 2? Is that too much to fucking ask? I want my country to just die out
The midterms and 2024 are gonna be fucking sad, because while I'd love to see the democrats get what they kinda deserve for their fuckups, that's gonna allow DeSantis or Trump to take power...and less of them is better
And shit like this slipping through is unacceptable
But it's definitely distracted from domestic affairs
Yeah, Ill say the support the US is giving Ukraine is phenomenal (while Germany is being psychotic about the whole situation)
It's fucking insane that this "democracy" allows it's courts to overturn a major law of the last 50 years without anyone noticing until  the finish voting to repeal it
I'd love to see Teddy Roosevelt rise from the grave and form a new Bull Moose Party against the bs going on now
Have they been working on anything unrelated to Ukraine?
The Supreme Court just unturns Roe v. Wade without any prior notice to the public, while Biden and the Dems have just been twiddling their thumbs
Yeah
Fucking Neoliberalism
Only decent one is Canada, arguably
It's really fucking awful in the English speaking world. Britain's currently in "New Labour 2" mode. The Dems drag their feet on major social issues. And Australian...I don't even fucking know what the hell is happening there
i mean, the Finns didn't really lose, or at least they didn't lose like the Soviets wanted
The soviets pretended they only wanted the border prvinces, but they were setting up plans for a loyal finnish puppet government, expecting to overrun and conquer the entire country
Finland's resistance nixed those plans.
ngl this twitter account is a fucking treasure trove
who?
fucking papists
looking on twitter and kinda happy for once because everyone's calling out the terfs for not saying shit about Roe v. Wade
yeah they do but that's not what we are talking about
this is one of fuking Trump's appointees
"meet market demands"
jesus
wow...no
Like a lot of stuff Kat says I take issue with, but I don't with this
yes you are
Please shut up
Vyn, calm it
As much as I fucking love thata this is finally fucking happening after years of new laws implemented to extend the copyrights specifically for Disney, a part of me thinks a big reason why its happening NOW is because of the Florida shit and their pro-trans stuff

I think that the Supreme Court should be voted in by peers in the court system rather than the Executive or Legislative branch, but that the legislative branch should have the ability to impeach/remove certain justices if needed as a check. 
Also, set retirement ages and shit
I think thats what she meant
actually would me more constitutional for the Supreme Court to hold no power
remember how they changed an Overwatch characters name in their "new" game just released because it was named after one of their employees who probably was involved in the scuffed shit something most people didn't know until the news about the name change came out?
like, after so many years, I can feel nothing anymore, because its the same story, over and over and over
I've gone numb to these
you say as if they aren't or weren't alreayd in that rabbit hole
yeah
We are never gonna not laugh at the Russians after this
why did they kick you out in the first place?
did you have one?
oh so its about masks?
uhm...a part of me thinks you should elaborate
Do you mean that figuratively or literally
but if you make him buff people will like him
then again the guy backed fucking Kanye in 2020
he wasn't but he was a lowkey trump supporter

I mean, I could get a job at Waffle house or someplace nearby but Georgia's minimum wage is under the federal standard unlike my home state of Florida. So if I do get work it's not gonna cover a lot of basic needs I'm currently getting just through credit card
I feel like I'm done with college, a part of me wants to go home and work part-time with my dad or with a family friend's bar. But I am the only one of my siblings still trying to graduate
Can't really pinpoint why. Lost the earmuff on my headphones, currently taking stupid science lab courses that's just telling me to buy lab equipment to use from home; broke and parents didn't give me my monthly allowance; tried to apply for a job at the university but my school's website bugs out when I submit my application. Try to take stress off by socializing at my residential area pool but it's been raining the last 5 days.
I feel really overwhelmed with stress to the point I can't go to sleep rn
More like genocide survivors from the stuff I've read
HOW TF CAN POLICE NOT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE A SHOOTING SITUATION?
It's been now 23 years since Columbine
I just want to remind everyone
Sorry if this is meandering, I write how I'm thinking a lot of the times
I left a while ago because for the last month I've just...felt drained, mentally. Going back to school and doing a bunch of online science and lab courses and such that I find stupid and unnecessary for what I'm studying for (which in itself is kinda stupidd but that's a discussion for another afternoon when I'm in the mood...)
I also just felt that I have run out of things to do here. I run out of stuff with the show I car to talk about; I'm not in the mood rn to continue working on my fanfic projects; I really am tired of discussing politics in this channel; following the meme channels is painful with two channels to deal wiht with constant posting; and realy, the only thing else I do is look in the art channels. 
So I left the server, thinking that I need to reconsider where I'm at and see if there's some other place to put my energies in. But...I haven't found anything. School work is still tough, my sleep schedule is broken to the point I don't wake up until noon anymore, and only have had two meals a day for the last two weeks. 
I want to clarify I'm not angry with anyone, but I am saying I wish there was another place for me to be, for some other show I watch regularly. Idk, servers like these are a diamond in the rough; I've not seen stuff like this for mainstream stuff. So I don't know how long I'll be here. Maybe permanent, who knows.
I'm gonna be so happy when Putin loses
I'm laughing at a lot of these premises

wait who?
Like if its jsut the stuff we already know they're actions are a disgrace
I think its just what we already know: actively did nothing
And their attempts to just not address it is just covering their ass from the scrutiny but doing the opposite
Yeah
I thought they just actively did nothing?
what tf?
Didn't George call Putin "a good Christian man" or some shit?
yeah, love White Nationalist delusions of oppression
Totally out of "pragmatism"
I saw a documentary interviewing a bunch of anglos saying that Britain should have left Poland to die and let Hitler go eastward
Also Amber Heard
does Ezra still have his role?
Its so funny watching DC lose every fucking actor for their Cinematic Universe project
only time the courts was actually useful to human beings living in this country was under Earl Warren
I fully understand why Mink Stole hates the supreme court
Wait what exactly is this new ruling?
Yeah, Taney wouldn't have allowed Thomas the right of citizenship, let alone a position in the court
Like imagine your arguing for a new anti-animal cruelty law in Germany, and to justify with prescendnet, you bring up fucking Nazi legislation
Even as someone who would defend the Second Amendment, this...this is like the worst fucking way to do it
I am genuinely fucking shocked they legit consider the Dredd Scott Decision enough to consider as fucking precednent
Oh hey look they're using the shittiest court decision ever to justify a new shitty court decision

We should bring back tar and feathering, as the founding fathers intended
There is zero energy in the democrats, despite Biden starting his fucking presidency with a bunch of right-wing nuts storming the capitol, he has not been able to do anything substantial
It's not "liberals are just as bad"
It's that we don't have actual fucking liberals in positions of power
unless this insinuates something else entirely
Does this mean anything? Like, I don't think the DoD controls the local police that enforce state laws and such
https://twitter.com/BNNBreaking/status/1540778428798234624

Its another word for British
Say it together friends
Anglos are Evil
heard it alleged that JFK was so upsetted by the incident that he started ending a lot of asylums in the country
So out fo the goodness of his heart he ruined this country
From what I recalled, Thomas got past the hearing based on racial politics. The fact he was black meant that the democrats couldn't really hit him hard without that card being pulled.
Can't wait for this to fail to pass and the Dems do nothing for months until republicans undo more civil rights
else the republicans are gonna fucking sweep 24
Biden isn't gonna get renominanted

How tf did he get to Japan?
I remember seeing a meme about how articles about rich white guys who murdered multiple members of their family include images of the dude on a jetski or some shit in the headline. Is this the equivalent for white women?
even if this was legit it seems like a "gotcha" type situation
like i said why would I even join into a server called "shaming"?
no
even if it wasn't a scam, why tf would I go on a server called "discord shaming"? If it was legit, I see this as some asshole wannabe cancellers trying to stage some psuedo-inquisition shit
yeah I'm gonna consider this a scam
/s but yeah
I take this as a personal attack
also what the fuck is up with this "Did you do this vague thing I'm not elaborating on? Because I am blocking you so you CAN'T ask or explain anything about the situation"
idk what the fuck this is about. 
Only thing connecting me with this guy is some smut he sent me back in 2019.
got this in my dms
https://i.imgur.com/ztIVfW0.png
There reason why witch hunts got started was because one incel bishop who had been stalking and harassing a nun who openly mocked him and took him to court, wrote a book about how women are all evil and are agents of the devil and should be burnt at the stake
Good
I think he's the son or nephew of the dude hold on
Dude's a descendant of one of the guys who ran Japanese colonial rule in Manchuria in WW2, and was charged with war crimes, only to be let out of prison early to become Japan's first post-war prime minister
also didn't help that the US government at the outset of those wars was helmed by the most actively incompetent president we've ever had, who happened to be a delusional evangelical and appointed people who literally had no fucking clue what they were doing (see: Donald "Invading Iraq would make for great CNN coverage" Rumsfeld)
Iraq...no, not really. Iraq was a political quagmire the day it was formed, with Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds and other demographics cobbled together. Iraq is not a solid nation state like Germany or Japan.
oh fuck you remind me of that one biker activist who was running a rally against helmet requirements and died when his bike crashed (he wasn't wearing a helmet)
(I mean "meaningless" sarcastically. They'll just ignore statistics and pump out their own tables full of utter fucking nonsense)
this is the Western right we are dealing with. They don't care about meaningless things like "statistics"
Would a billion percent be surprised if they didn't
the right in the US is definitely gonna use this as an example of "gun control doesn't work"
I wonder if this dude is gonna "inspire" the nuts in the US to do similar acts against politicians...or if they're just gonna do what they always do and shoot up schools

same. If I ever cycled, I'd be doing so along the side of the fucking roads in and out of my neighborhood
I don't bike, but whenever I drive I instinctively buckle my seatbelt, because I had been guilt tripped by my family who kept reminding me its the reason I have never met my paternal grandpa
Alexander III and Nicholas II
Yeah, after another two Tsars got millions killed in stupid wars and murdered much of their own people in fear of the revolution these socialists were all but telegraphing
and handing them the "oh, if we liberalize, we're gonna die" excuse on a silver fucking platter
but the Russian socialists all but empowered the reactionary factions by murdering the liberal dude
no, of course not
point taken, but you have to admit, an absolute monarch enacting liberal reforms, ending slavery, and on the verge of forming a parliment system, is preferable to an absolute monarch who creates a secret police
Like I'm not pro-monarchy generally (ok maybe not since I'm pro-Napoleon), but this may have been the point where Russia could have shifted out of being an authoritarian dominated state, like it was under the later Tsars, the Soviets, and the current administration
Dude legit ends serfdom and imposes a bunch more reforms that could have liberalized Russia
But no, he gets killed by fucking socialists...and that empowers his successors to be more conservative and repressive.
literally the most boneheaded fucking moment in Russian history
u refering to Alexander II assassination?
They're eating each other now
https://nypost.com/2022/07/10/trump-slams-elon-musk-as-bulls-t-artist-at-gop-campaign-rally/amp/
The word "feminism" warps around the prescense of the Clintons
but yeah no from all I've read it was because the assassin was upset his family got tied up in a weird cult Abe lowkey supported (or at least the guy THOUGHT Abe supported them)
wasn't really liberal on the "comfort women" thing
~~I just call them all what they are: true American heroes~~
I haven't used Uber or Lyft in years, because no one in my areas actually operate
it honestly feels like one of those weird pro-corporate motivational fucking channels. Because ti has no videos, just a bunch of shorts (snippets of "successful" people)
Idk if the algorythym is shittalking me for my chud years or what
I look on youtube and see community posts from some channel called "Investingexecutives" that just posts shit like this
they're pretty infamous for stuff in the 90s like Ruby Ridge and Waco where they caused a LOT of needless collateral damage when there were more peaceful solutions
but yeah they're an enforcement arm of the IRS who essentially enforce tax laws on stuff like guns, alcohol, and drugs.
I think that's the quote from that one anime
the agency against having fun
Except it's just a jpg
No that's just how gacha games work
Whenever I hear Ainu racism brought up, I just remember that one sfdebris review of Godzilla v. King Kong from the early 60s, how the studio originially was going to set it on an island full of primitive ainu people, but they realized the times were changing, and that the general Japanese public at large wasn't going to be happy with such blatant racism towards the Ainu
So they rewrote it and set it on an island full of primitive african people
as an American that doesn't sound calmed down in the slightest
tbh I thought shit cooled down in NI since the troubles (at least that's what all the YT docs say)
are any of your family political activists or some shti?
Why brag about being an expert on overthrowing governments
...
HoloID and NijiID are not gonna have fun with this if this is true
this is as profound a revelation as "the sky is blue"
I've never agreed with the Russian far right on anything before this. Please, end the English
I told you, its Georgia
out of the blue, but I just remembered that time in 5th Grade History class in Georgia, we did an entire mock trial for Sherman's actions during the March to the Sea
I played a black slave girl who was crying over her "massa" getting killed by yankee soldiers. That was the script, but when the defense came I changed the story and said that he was shooting at them; the prosecuters were like "wtf Pug, why didn't you keep the story straight? We coulda won this".  Sherman got acquitted in the end, but it felt like it was just predetermined before it even started. 
Ngl, whole thing was lowkey scuffed, and I hope that the school system doesn't do that shit anymore...or at least rewrote the whole thing so we don't have slaves crying over dead masters.
tbh this is shit they've been doing for years, but usually its with Winnie the Pooh or Mickey Mouse.
doubt it will killed me, my family's immune system is like a tank
So, think i got a virus last night. Don't know how, don't know if its the new covid strain
sometimes the teacher would just say "Oh, Trail of Tears didn't happen until Van Buren's presidency"
and that's kinda how he was presented to me through much of my time in school
and a lot of Trump's base see the dude as a populist hero sticking it to the establishment
trump likes Jackson
what was the result?
I will say that class made me want to get into history, which is why I'm now a history major and know how fucking weird that shit was
not too worried personally, considering my health and family history
thank you
dad used a test kit. yeah its covid
it just really sucks to go through
not super concerned because many of my family members caught earlier strains of covid and got through it with little issue. Plus I at least got the first Johnson & Johnson vaccine in 2021
not yet, overheard dad saying something about getting me tested
thought I was doing better at the end of yesterday, but now I have a clogged up nose on top of chills, sore throat, and brain mush
so day three of whatever virus I got
Woke up with my throat feeling worse than ever. Painful to swallow water, not to mention pills or breakfast
Russia couldn't even control the states around it, let alone the US
oh yeah, I knew the Russia thing was bullshit when the Ukraine shit happened
he only won because Hilary's campaign manager forgot the electoral college existed and you actually had to appeal to certain states rather than just get big broad polling numbers
I've heard that Hilary in 2016 was thrilled at first to be running against Trump because he seemed to be the weakest link at the time (no evidence on if her campaign supported Trump's primary as far as I know...but wouldn't be surprised given how out of touch her campaign was)
tbh, Nixon's staff admitted to helping promote George McGovern's candidacy in the 72 election because Nixon and his staff saw McGovern as their weakest contender
?
btw, my fever's gone, been told that means that the contagious portion of whatever covid I got is passed. Still am coughing a lot, still doing weird burps, and I also have this weird feeling in my ears (particularly my right one). Think I may have a sinus infection. Hopefully I can talk with a doctor about it
this is just wild to me, never would anything like this happen in the US, not because our government isn't deranged enough to do it, but because our country is run by corpos
wonder if this is gonna affect any of those streamers and those companies
like, if there's a big vtuber agency, its three major branches are most likely Japanese, English, and Indonesian
I thought Indonesia was a bit more open as of recent given all the vtuber stuff coming out of there
dude was harassed by white supremacist organizations, police, mobs, terrorists, and the fucking FBI (because J. Edgar Hoover was a racist pos)
yeah, dude was the leader of one of the main organizations that pushed for Civil Rights for black people (as well as other minorities and disenfranchised peoples) in the US in the 1950s and 1960s. Dude's the closest thing this shithole of a country has to a saint.
I know this story, and its honestly the most wild shit ever
Nichelle Nichols passed away today
We need someone who uses Zodiac signs and soothsayers to determine who we drone strike
?
A lot of it was fear that once black people had power, they'd use it to bring the white people who lorded over them to justice...or to the minds of these racists "unjustly massacre innocent women and children"
little different fundamentally to US segregation (because Anglos be Anglos)
plus, South Africa basicaally had its Jim Crow system run until the fucking 1990s
also because Slavery was a big thing for most of the early years of the country
Easy answer: White Europeans think they are superior, consciously or subconsciously because of cultural history
And I find it fucking disgraceful that whenever people talk about Malcolm X they only do it in that dychotomy, when Malcolm himself abandoned the extremist rhetoric after going to Mecca and coming to understand Islam better
Like, he probably would have faded in relevance as the years went on, and may have stuck to unpopular positions, but I do not see MLK becoming Al Sharpton
I don't recall at any point where he was openly supporting the violent portions of the movement. Most he did was say we should understand why riots occur, while not condoning them; and working with Malcolm X after Malcolm softened on violence after his trip to Mecca
In US, we have preschool before Kindergarten.
hmm, Paypal scam occurring just when one of the largest populations in the world is currently frantically trying to withdraw from the service due to government fuckery...
But yeah, Tutsi's only became that because of European racial theory and colonial practices
Looking up what Model Minority means...yeah I wouldn't want to apply that to any group ever. Seems to be a term to diss on other oppressed groups for not being as well off as this other group.
good to hear...
took them two years to get to this
I could go on, just out of frustration that this shit is the primary focus for a bunch of late Roman/Early Byzantine history that just sounds so pedantic and stupid and annoying to read about so many councils and the esoteric beliefs of the Christian faith
Let's say stuff in the early years of the Christian church is just...a lot. So many alternate denominations like the Arians and Monophosites and shit. There were a bunch of books (chapters) of the bible they wanted included but were banned by the main denomination of the Orthodox Church as heretical
Thought my covid was starting to pass, but right now it's come back with a vengeance it feels. Throat feels like sandpaper. Coughing so often I can't sleep.
This country has developed a cult around guns. It's not as easy as, say, New Zealand banning firearms after the mosque shooting.
Because there's a lot of people in this country who have guns who wouldnt willingly hand them over, and that could cause bloodshed.
I would love to explain to these people that the only reason someone would read a book in a library is if they go out of their way to find it...which is how library's fucking work
"I want gay people to starve" - Republicans
https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/republican-attorneys-general-sue-federal-government-lgbtq-school-meal-rcna40250
we are dealing with a man who broke up a band without consulting his bandmates, then sued his bandmates for trying to carry on without him (and were outselling his tour shows), and continues being a dick to this day pretending he was in the right for all the shit he did then
but if he were making the Wall today Pink would team up with Putin and Kim Jong Un to take down America
I always interpreted that scene as the character Pink realizing that the abuses he inflicted on other, while influenced by his unhealthy upbringing, were not justified, and was at fault for, you know, becoming a fascist spokesman
Sucks because that 2017 album was actually pretty good
I remember seeing him live in 2018 in Berlin. Good performance until the second half when it just became the "Fuck Trump"/"Free Palestine" variety hour. Remember before he played the closing song, he went on a rant about how he won't play in Germany anymore because German banks weren't supporting his anti-Israel organization anymore.
Honestly not surprised by this one, Roger Waters has been up his own ass since the Wall, so it should be expected that he speaks in shit
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.insider.com/pink-floyds-roger-waters-biden-russia-ukraine-2022-8%3famp
Did he want his generals to plot to murder him?
There's a lot of shit to unpack with this
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/08/us/politics/trump-book-mark-milley.html
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/07/pink-floyd-reform-to-support-ukraine This was back in April but holy shit this makes Waters look more like a joke
yeah,, Trump's summer retreat got raided by the FBI in connection with the Jan 6th Hearings (or the billion other things Trump's done)
John JohnWick
John Die-Hard
Aristophanes: The playwright who made Socrates eat shit
Made fun of Socrates a lot, and Plato (stupidly) blames them for Socrates' eventual downfall
yeah Socrates was referenced in a lot of plays by this one dude whose name I can't remember
still, fun fucking stories
yeah a lot of Diogenes' life is ssecond hand and probably fabricated, as are lot of the wild historical figures of that era, for a multitude of reasons
So, in ancient greek philosphy, there was this fad where great philosophers tried to describe humans in as few words as possble. The legendary Plato came up with "Featherless Biped". Everyone accepted it as brilliant, but Diogenes found a loophole in his logic. So he plucked a chicken clean of its feathers, went into one of Plato's courses, tossed it into the room, and called it "Plato's Man"
that's not even the best Diogenes story
Read up on Diogenes. 
Dude decided to live in a barrel and eat scraps of food left on the ground; dude's only possession was a water bowl which he threw out once he realized how materialistic that was and just drank using his hands. 
Alexander the Great walked up to him and offered Diogenes whatever the hell he wanted. Diogenes asked Alexander the Great, one of the most powerful men in classical history, to step to the side so Alex wasn't blocking his suntan
yeah, you gotta keep the Mongols in power there
I honestly believe that the U.S. should go back to international isolation so it can focus it's resources on actually important social reform shit rather than spending billions propping up dictatorships
Would love for the camera footage to be unearthed and see every major US politiian & Woody Allen seperately try to murder him, like that one Smiling's Friends episode
I'll be here all night
tbh I don't think you can use "hung out with Epstein" as a distinctive descriptor for any aging US politician...because all of them did
during WW2 the US had 90% of the world's oil production
really has more to do with resources and stability than really foreign exploitation, but yeah thats a factor
closest thing there is to a contender to the US economically and militarily, though still a longshot in latter category
I mean, China is able to project into Africa and Oceania and a lot of places in Asia
and even then they're losing to a country a 10th its size rn
yeah, Russia is a regional power at best
sanctioning them is not in the best interest of many nations
Problem is, US has the biggest economy in the world
yeah them too
tbh the only alternative is UN Coalitions but those cannot form because of the braindead veto powers that Russia and China have.
because what would you define as "the free world"? Democracies generally? Because there's a lot of "democracies" that really are just oligarchies or dictatorships in disguise
yeah
To clarify my position:
I believe in cases like Ukraine, we should still send aid to wronged nations facing major aggressors. 
But if the free world's continued existance depends on the support of the shithole that is my country, that says a lot of how weak the free world is concieved of at this moment. And from what Lank implies, the US is often the one responsible for the big threats to the free world emerging. So why meddle more? Why waste resources making the world a shittier place in the process? Foreign policy shit has been the go to distraction for conservatives against reforms, though its slowly appearing culture war shit is taking its place instead.
I could name names, but the list is so long you'd think it was the guest list to Jeffrey Epstein's private island
the theory isn't he's still alive...rather that his suicide was "assisted" on the behalf of certain powerful parties (who exactly depends on what end of the political spectrum you are, because this dude made sure to get himself photographed with so many major US figures its insane)
I'm just staring at this rn
https://twitter.com/BlackPnwLady/status/1559327546763751424?t=HY4fgyzmN4WOHCZNwEJXRQ&s=19
And on an artist level, it just means companies are only ever using gays in the media they produce as background material, unimportant to the piece altogether making it easy to remove.
Also just realized the guy implied China funds terrorists puppet groups. I'm anti-China but yeah no, that's not their modua operandi
(America's a different story but besides the point)
The difference here is that Hebdo was specifically targeting Islam and portraying Mohammed...which is fucked up they were targeted for that but it's an extreme example. 
Also, consider if these countries DID attempt to launch a terror attack in the US against a company for promoting LGBT stuff? Drone strikes within the hour. These countries aren't run by idiots.
Same time all those trans men go into women's restrooms to assault "real" women?
(It never fucking happened Joanne)
Also when the fuck has a game design studio or film company outside of these places been attacked by terrorists for LGBTQ rep?
I mean bottom line it is a shit government that's at fault but like, why compromise your principles to placate these fuckers? Just don't sell your game there
which I should note was over a year ago
yeah
Doubt he'd do that for Sarah
I say this and earlier today, I text dad about a David Bowie tribute concert coming to town in a few months and a minute later he says he bought two tickets for me and him.
Yeah
Honestly I don't know what I'm going on about, just wanted to get this frustration out. Up to this point I've thought my family was a tightnit unit, and was something I'm proud being a part of. Love my parents and my siblings (to different degrees depending), but yeah...I'm kinda scared all of this is now just gonna collapse. I've done everything I can to keep on mom and dad's good sides, never overspending, listening to their advice, go out and try being social or eat healthier like they ask, etc. But...idk if that's gonna change. Am I next?
Should note though, my sister does have bipolar disorder, and last she mentioned she's been voluntarily off meds, not sure if she changed her mind but the way shes acted hasn't dramatically changed since said convo
It's kinda gotten worse recently, when she dropped out of college and moved to California work for a company my dad was connected to. And then by the time summer rolls around, my brother rants about how she managed to get fired from said job. She's bounced back working as a barista, but I've overheard my folks arguing about how much they are paying for the four of us. So...yeah, barely surprising
This is honestly a long time coming. Ever since she went off to college I hear mom and dad complaining that she keeps blowing through her allowance and spending on her credit card (read, the one mom and dad pay for), and compliment me for NOT doing that.
Begged me to not tell Mom and dad about this, and I said I would'nt, because, once again don't want to ruin this family further
Btw, the other day, my sister called from California, said mom and dad cut her off and she wanted to use my Mastercard connected to dads account. I told her I didn't have it anymore, which is a lie because I don't want to ruin this family further
https://www.axios.com/local/boston/2022/08/18/boston-childrens-hospital-trans
Yeah, at the least they could go after the offending users, which would affect the site culture, for better or worse hard to tell
that or I'm an idiot and put in the wrong name in the search bar entirely
I think discord just fucked up on my end
huh
Not sure if its ok to ask about other users here, but, is something up withSolopy? I haven't seen them around here in a while. Checked and their last messages were back in June.
Oh, and one time, he changed the forum admin password to the n-word, which resulted in the forum getting hacked.
Zaiger also was notorious with asking targets for bribes to take down articles...except with women, whom he'd request sexual favors for to take them down (no clue if anyone has taken the latter offer, but jesus christ).
There's one story of Zaiger, as a joke, changed the name of the server owner to one of the site's favorite punching bags (can't remember his name), and when the dude found out, he called up the provider and shut down the server for serveral days
its funny because the site prides itself on cataloguing lolcows when half their admins are bigger lolcows than anyone else they cover
The guy who owned the site before Zaiger was arrested for hacking the US government (if you heard of lulzSec, its part of that)
Listen, if you think Chris-chan is a pile of shit, my god, you need to look into the Zaiger-hole
honestly ED existed well before the Chris-story got going. 
Honestly the only good thing about it was the saga of breif owner Brian Zaiger who was selling user data for crack, and other "wacky" shit like sending his ex-girlfriend death threats over the phone, which was recorded and posted on the site because the admins hated his guts
tbh it is Hasan, his one talent is inducing rage
also on the run from human traficking charges
It has been 5 weeks since I got COVID, I know for a fact it's receded by this point...but I wake up in the middle of the night coughing unable to go to sleep
Brian Zaiger...he's my favorite loser scumbag ever
Jennette McCurdy was a big nikelodeon childstar, most famous for playing Sam on iCarly
She eventually retired from acting (as people found out in her recently released tell all book) because of her abusive and controlling mother
Also I find it hilarious that, at the end of this email, basically telling her daughter that she's dead to her and throwing around a bunch of slurs and shit, mom of the year begs for money like she's Brian Zaiger
I'm not sure if celebrity drama like this counts for this channel, but considering the amount of verbal abuse and gaslighting Jennette's mother gave her is sickening.
https://twitter.com/MemeRepos/status/1562028241853894656?s=20&t=OseE3eeaqgxJenj87rl5_A
yeah, that's something my folks harp on me for
I mean, in this case the illegal shit they did IS immoral as all hell
I think being more upset that your film is gonna get cancelled than the heinous illegal shit you've done says there's a LONG way to fucking go
https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1563267036737744896?s=20&t=C-xuKmmr0pq5dRuVuOKDaQ
yeah, I need to stop doing the "I'm totally gonna start my health binge" schtick but holy shit I'm starting tommorrow
I think somethings wrong. I had just gotten back to my room after doing dishes. I close the door comment to myself about some random shit on my mind...and I nearly fallover. Feel, well, not dizzy but wozzy. Really uncanny feeling. In bed right now (as I usually am most days). 
Idk what the heck is going on. Think I've drank enough water. Maybe its my shit diet catching up to me? Had a bowl of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, then a bowl of self made popcorn with butter, then another bowl of ice cream. All sorta back to back. 
Think this is the right assumption to make here? Or does someone else know whats up?
Yeah
Reality is whatever my political idol tells me it is
We live in a post-fact society
Of course
Thing about our current society
Trump supporters would 100% change the Reese's puffs jingle at a rally or counter protest or whatever and it be one of the less weird events in the last few fucking years
Wait what's that about?
I'm sorry if any of that came off paranoid, that's because I'm still in shock over this and not thinking 100% rationally
I know other parts of the campus have gang problems, or at least I've heard in the recent past. Meanwhile, the apartment block I live in, nearly every white guy I've talked to has a rather positive opinion of Trump. High chance of either or.
Could be, but it sounded like it came from the grassy area between the apartment blocks than it did from the parking lot
so, I was working on my project, sitting in my apartment...when suddenly I heard three loud bangs go off outside within the span of a second. I think someone was firing off a gun or something. Called the police immediately. I'm fucking shaking rn
I literally watched the actual video (just look up Tucker Carlson Matt Gaetz), and skimmed through to find the interaction, I swear, everytime I skipped forward Gaetz would just say FBI, that's all I hear
(apparently this clip is a year old but fuck it, and yeah its been edited heavily, he doesn't interrupt Tucker at all, instead just denies shit and claims the FBI/CIA/NSA is smearing him)
For context, Matt Gaetz is under investigation for trafficing a 17 year old girl (or "17 year old woman", as he interrupts) back in 2017
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463784786050416690/1013426250209034330/video0-6.mp4 Sorry this is a meme but holy fuck dude unironically said this shit
I've spent my entire afternoon looking for the screenshot of that modded HOI4 Hungarian focus tree that goes from "Beacon of Democracy in Europe" to "Deport the Gypsies"
I have...so many question about the guy who sent those photos in:
1.) Did they know what was in that book? Did they understand wtf those photos were about? 
2.) If they did, why didn't they inform the dude when they gave it to him?
its the copout of these assholes to make them look good
"If you let THESE people hang around and kick ME out, THOSE people will ruin thing you love"
Maybe there's exceptions with that on the more conservative side (or the wackier elements of the far left and right), but that's what I've gleaned from my (albiet limited) understanding of Germany
And also, Germany is one of the few countries in the world that will have its government admit without any asterisk that their country's done awful shit.
If there is any country in the world that would actively avoid starting WW3, its Germany. 
tbh, this is more just postering by the Polish nationalists harranging Germany for all the shit their people and government did to them decades back, to justify bullshit these assholes are trying to pull rn.
on the one hand, I can see this as the utterly cynical move it is
on the other...did Germany ever give reparations to Poland for, you know, all the shit the Nazis did during that time?
https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1565908472083922945?t=7D0QDc-RODSla2lKNQj42w&s=19
I'm sorry if this is weird, or if it doesn't seem serious, but I feel really concerned with how my mind has been working the past few months
Does any of this qualify as normal? Is it normal for people to just daydream about their life being ruined?
Like, I had one where I imagined myself running a successful animation studio, only to be horrifically maimed in an explosion and I live out my life with survivors guilt and difficulting performing day to day tasks

In another, I become a successful vtuber, but then I get peer pressured by my costars into eating a snail, become paralyzed and am slowly dying
And for those daydreams to fuck with you, even if they're not real or are really far fetched?
So, question:
Is it normal to daydream about how my life will turn out, and have those always end with how my life will go to shit?
I'm offended by the weakness of your statement
idk why this thread shocks me
https://twitter.com/ScottHech/status/1566941970458480640?s=20&t=erFbx7GCnoTBxpWu3f6WAA
That's excusable in like, the 2000s, when people learn texting for the first time
Like, look at their writing
Genuine question: why tf are these scammers so shit at writing emails?
attempted blackmail...but they're so fucking vague about what they're trying to blackmail me with
oh its just this

Not in detail, just someone screenshot ting the establishment and everyone having a laugh
I actually heard of this before
Oh yeah that place
I am concerned with the phrase "designed to be"
I understand this is true, but that doesn't mean I'm not still annoyed
The only other places I can post this sorta stuff are either inactive, or are my schoolmates who I talk to irl and are in a position to kill me if I show them my work and they hate it
Piss
Same deal with the other one, though that's also because it's NSFW material
Yeah, I'd expected the <#357682999300718592> peeps would give it a look, but since it's not Symphogear related, cant post anything there
(or rather link back to original posts and hope people will get attention)
Honestly realize I'm being a drama queen just for bitching about this rather than reposting my work so people see it
Same
I'll admit I've got ego issues (I always asked my writer friends what they think of my ideas but never listen when they go off about their own projects)
I get that
I don't know if I'm being inconsiderate for saying this, but I feel like I'm being ignored whenever I post any of my writing projects. Last night I posted the first chapter of my new project over in <#458060276550336522> ...and no one made a comment about it. I post a smutfic in <#336297808221044736> . No one comments, and people keep posting art as if nothing happened. 
This has happened before, I recall, where I post in here asking for help on something when Im having trouble and am looking for advice, but people just posted about current events and didn't even acknowledge my posts.
Am I being egotistical for being upset about this? Am I being toxic for this, wanting feedback or acknowledge of my work and what I have to say?
"are you saying we planned to get stalled out and pushed out of Territory we've taken as if it's 'all part of the plan'"?

And looking at the troubleshooter, it does specify "experiencing driver- or hardware-related problems"
Yeah, it's the adapter
Think it's something with my hardware? I always thought the driver was just software
Can someone explain to me why tf this driver consistently fails? I've had this issue for ages, keep uninstalling and reinstalling it, and keeps on happening
I love how I have three online classes and a computer whose internet connection keeps failing because of a recurring failure of my network adapter, with the only recourse being to: initiate a network reset (takes 5 minutes), and then be able to use my laptop for 10 minutes before the adapter fails again.
Hope it doesn't come down to retaliatory mass murder
I hate everything you just said
Is there a term for someone whose bigoted against their own group? Honestly shocked that someone this psychotic managed to grift $6k from Tumblr users by pretending to be inclusive while being racist and bigoted for pretty much everyone and everything all at once

Like...are you implying that these fucking guys can't keep their trash tier politically bankrupt parties going without Putin's support?
I really love how he says
"This is old news"
And 
"You have to be stupid to believe this"
Conversation on a history server about that "shocking" reveal that Putin has actually been funding far right movements and figures for years
Spoilering because of use of the R slur (and my apologies for using it myself)
1994? That would imply the tank had been stolen in a prior conflict. Only one of note where Abrams were involved was the Kuwait War. Must have been an A1 in that case
Who?
The US is super fucking protective of the Abrams, they wouldn't have given it to Russia
No, that is probably bs
What shit?
?
Yeah, I doubt they'd wanna hand over even the oldest model of Abrams. Think the armor composition is still top secret
No that makes it was less intuitive
Think about how it rolls off the tongue
Templeposting
Found it (spoilering it as NSFW)
And it labels the one by someone who masterbates a lot as "The Whore Penis"
Some diagram by a Christian org against masterbation showing a diagram of penises over time
Hold on and let me dig up the image
Honedtly was half a mind to email back with just that weird christian diagram of the "whore penis"
It's not even religion. They just lambast about how disgusting it is I "touch my penis"
Yeah
I have received another scam email from another burner account claiming that they have webcam footage of me masterbating
Of course I'm ignoring it, as these people are full of ot. But I'm also just weirded out by just how pissed off the sound over the fact I masterbate? Like...who tf are they trying to be? CHRISTIAN Scam artists?

I think Ive reached the point of social isolation where I'm becoming too paranoid to function. 
Last night, as I was trying to go to sleep, out of the corner of my eye, I see shillouettes of a dozen dudes walking past my window past midnight. I grabbed a hammer from a tool kit, took an hour to get to sleep and slept only in two hour intervals. Same deal tonight without the guys walking by, but I'm constantly looking at the covered window in terror
Shout out to my boy MSG!

If you watch Russian military parades you see him sitting near Putin
Yes
What matters is he's a rightwing scumbag, con martial artist, and a mouthpiece for Russian propaganda
Do not worry, all his movies sucked (except for Under Siege and the one where he dies in the first act).
Steven Seagal, 90s action star turned obese Russian stooge
I remember seeing him perform in Berlin in 2018. Dude spent the entirety of "Pigs (Three Different Ones)", a song about how abuse of power is systematic and can't be attributed to one bad apple, on showing Donald Trump's penis. 
Then ends the concert by throwing a hissy fit that German banks have freezed funding for his stupid anti-Israel shit and how he will never perform in Germany again.
Meanwhile, Gilmour and Mason reformed the band to do a tribute song with a Ukrainian rockstar turned soldier
Idk if I hate Roger more than I do Eric "Keep England White" Clapton.
And now, peddling Russian propaganda and blaming Ukraine for starting the war
Broke up Pink Floyd without telling his band mates

well, real as in this is an actual thing someone in this sham investigation wrote down and thought was pertinent to smear him with

debatable
Gee, it's like turning a blind eye to fascism just let's Fascists continue to be fascists. Who knew?
Don't forget also the League also was for Chamberlain's appeasement, and turned a blind eye to Italy using poison gas on Ethiopians
The League didn't kick them out
They left voluntarily
Are you talking about Japan?
Because they left
When?
https://youtu.be/FmQd1doR_R4
What am i supposed to take away? "Just think about it"?
You talk about nuances, yet you give no examples
No I want to see where you are coming from on this
I'm sorry if I'm coming off strong here. I am willing to believe you are being misled by misinformation casualy spread around the internet. That happens, and I am willing to look past it.
Can you be fucking specific here?
What are they, do tell?
hate to hear it man. Sorry for the timing of this all. I don't think I'll have many answers but someone else here might
Another thing:
You know another conflict that has a lot of "nuances": The American civil War
"It was about States Rights (to keep black people in chains)!" 
"It was industrialism vs. (slave based) agriculture"
"It was a war of Northern Aggression" The South seceded because they lost the election and fired on US Military facilities. 
A lot of "nuances" about that, don't you think?
I'm sorry for this wall of text but holy fuck do these people piss me off
Before and during the early stages of WW2, there was a significant anti-war movement in the west. In May 1940, before the Battle of Britain began, people in Britain were protesting the war in the streets. Many proclaimed that their leaders should just negotiate with Hitler's regime to bring about peace. Because *obviously* Hitler had proven himself an honest man and a good-faith actor during that Munich Crisis (oh wait he broke the terms soon after and invaded the country that the British government made defenseless by willingly handing over their territory). /s. Many of these were Communists or Socialists, who thought, due to the Molotov Pact, Hitler was an ally of the communist movement and was fighting the evil capitalist west. 

You know why you don't hear about these people so often? Because they disappated the second they realized THEY were under attack. Anti-war protests in Britain died out during the Blitz. When the Nazis launched Barbarossa, the same communists who had denounced the war were suddenly vocal supporters of the war against the fascist menance. The America First Movement disbanded after the Pearl Harbor Attacks. 

These people weren't just living in their times. They were worsening them. The America First Movement platformed people like Charles Lindbergh, who was infamous for his anti-semitism. They were also backed by the German American Bund, a nazi-funded organization that promoted German nationalism in the states with Nazi rallies straight out of Triumph of the Will. These fucking people are a disgrace to the human species for calling for "nuance" in a war in which the enemy did not care for such things. A war in which millions died in gas chambers, in mass graves, or worked to death in camps. These people deserved to be remembered ONLY for the shame they bring to the human race with their blissful ignoranc...if it was only ignorance...
Before you go, can I bring up a certain comparrison?
yeah, because the Kremlin literally has been bankrolling those region's uprisings since 2014
And these fuckers are saying that Ukraine is "prolonging" this war because they won't come to terms with Putin...who isn't operating in good faith, i should add
Russia started this war
This conflict only exists because Russia started it
Claiming that the cause of this war has anything to do with supposed Ukrainian or Western aggression towards russia is nothing more than parroting the same propoganda Putin's regime pumps out
in this case: it is not.
wish he would stop harassing the Ukrainian government about them being warmongers
cool
They come at it from different angles, I'll add, but they come to the same damn conclussion
Both at the end of the day side with Russian fascists and parrot their talking points in the name of a false peace
i see little difference
I just dm'd him and told him Elon is making the same stand on Ukraine as Roger Waters
Hopefully that clicks (because we both agree Roger's a scumbag)
I can't wait for my Elon-stan of a father to dm me trying to defend this shit
like, seriously, why is Elon invested enough to call the ceding of Crimea to Ukraine in the 50s as "Khrushchev's mistake"?
I can't wait to see people actually defend this as him "trying to be neutral" and ignore that little detail on the end of that second point
What is it with Elon trying to go for rock bottom at every chance he gets nowadays?
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1576969255031296000?s=20&t=SyBslDpCM2VENK0_78oLmw
Probably should update them about the situation
And fuck your school district, I guess
But yeah, if they don't hire you because you need time to grieve, they're the assholes, not you
I can't really say much, beyond an old adage a cousin of mine has:
"Well, today sucks. But Tommorow could be better"
Like, if it's between personal life shit & politics, personal life shit take precedent
Don't be like that.
We're being petty arguing about Ukraine. You get priority
The Russians have spent this whole world accusing the west of fascism because of the embrace of identity politics, while simultaneously spouting fascist talking points in their own fucking pro-war propoganda
A nationalist invade that has tried to undermine their nation for decades
I talk about fascism because that is literally what Ukraine is facing right now
This isn't Vietnam, this isn't Afghanistan., This isnt WW1
You talk of "nuance" when in this instance, there is no such thing
Propoganda?
This anti-war bullshit has been fueled entirely by Russian propoganda talking points
How does "Ukraine shouldnt be pressured into a shame peace because Russia is run by fascists who want to destroy them" not make sense as a premise?
?
I don't think fascists deserve politeness
I guess I'm an extremist for thinking that
Literally everything I've said is easily provable
How so?
If you were in their shoes, would you rather be at peace and give up your people to these tyrants in the process?
They're dealing with an army that's slaughtered civilians in Bucha
They are dealing with a country whose leader considers Ukraine "a fiction"
But it's kinda fucked in these circumstances to insinuate that Ukraine has at all brought it upon itself
It's not me.being an extremist. I know this war is fucked for Ukraine's citizens
The best thing for Ukraine isn't to sign shame peace agreements with an untrustworthy regime that has literally been murdering their citizens
I'm sorry that I do not entertain fascist apologists walking away without a counter.
Also, I find the idea this war needs to end because it's gonna go to stalemate completely ignores how bad shit is for the Russians. I can't see how this "mobilization" will change shit (especially given how fucking eager so many draft age men are to go on vacation the second the mobilization is announced)
Zelensky is responsible for his people...to carry them through a defensive war against a literal fascist demagogue who wants to conquer and destroy Ukraine (or at the very least, grab the east and leave the west under a puppet regime). 
The people who say Zelensky is prolonging this war are morons or Russian agents. I do not see how his government is at fault for wanting to reclaim territory that belongs to them that Russia has illegally occupied.
Yeah it think people suggesting Ukraine should do retaliation mass killing are vile assholes
Could you really feel safe living there?
Listen: would you want to live in a country where your nextdoor neighbor is significantly larger and run by a guy who thinks your country is a fiction?
Is that too "extreme" of me?
I don't think Russian imperialism should be legalized by such a hypothetical peace
I bet a lot of people in Bucha thought the same thing
I would love to hear their opinions on all this shit
Question: is there anyone in Ukraine who would want such a peace?
Which is not something anyone in Ukraine wants
But if they made peace without getting back their territory, they all but cede them to the Russians
It's gonna slow down and turn to a slog eventually, certainly
Thing is, Ukraine is winning right now.
<@278860841485598720> I'm not gonna say such a peace is not possible
I'm saying such a peace will not be worth it.
Well if they take issue with that, they can go fuck themselves for all I care
And leaving them to the Russians is just going to give them future opportunities to try again
And it's quite clear Putin & his cronies simply aren't gonna hand those back
So Crimea and the Donbass
I don't see Ukraine making peace without getting back it's pre-2014 borders
Yeah
Was it worth it for the Czechs?
You guys have literally said "Sometimes the loss of some territory is worth it"
But for the love of God, you all imply that Ukraine should just seek Peace rather than prolong a war they will likely win before the year is out
I can understand saying that the situation for the average Ukrainian is fucked
What the actual fuck is wrong with you people?
How tf is it strawmaning to say any of this obvious shit
So yeah, war should go on until Russia makes peace
The Russians should be the ones making peace, but they haven't been acting in good faith this whole fucking year
The only one who should be held responsible for prolonging this fucking war is the asshole who started it
Like rightwing chuds attacking "stupid liberals" to obfuscate how awful the guys they support are
I see saying that Ukraine should seek Peace at this stage is tantamount to defending Russia
Russo-Ukraine war Business, get back to your dronks
Yeah because a large number of Ukrainians died in the 1930s... gee I wonder why
Ukraine has done everything it could beyond directly starting a war with Putin to remain a sovereign nation.
And then Putin invaded
They've been fighting his spearatists for the last 8 years
They ousted his crony in 2014
Plus, you know why I know these fuckers never wanted to have Putin as a neighbor?
Do you think after this war they're going to be fine with that anymore?
motherfuckers tested gas weapons and the plague upon POWs and civilians
But for that to stop, countries need to stop declaring them
We don't want war to happen, no
Also he's a Musk Stan so felt I had to bring this up to him anyway
Yes
That said, dude is a homophobe. When I went to college for the first time my dad sent me a message to watch out for "the gays" who would manipulate me into doing something "I didn't want to do".
Like I disagree with my dad a lot on politics but I usually leave him be because he rarely brings it up to me
I hope i.havent set the seeds that will one day result in him turning his back on me and cutting me off
I pointed that out (I'm a respectful manner) and then he shift the discussion to the Minsk Protocols as if it means shot
There's a billion others he could have compared to and he chooses the one that makes him look like a dumbass
Yeah
Like, he compares Russia to the UN in Kuwait...when the more apt comparison in that conflict is Saddam's Iraq who invaded and attempted to annex it for oil
Which has to be the worst case I've seen yet
I just got a message from my dad that Russia invading Ukraine is just as bad as the UN invading Iraq during the First Gulf War
Same fucking deal with Russia
I say textbook because literally every other time the US does war it follows none of this shit
In the case of the First Gulf War:
Iraq invaded Kuwait and illegally attempted to annex them
The UN told Saddam in no uncertain terms that, if he did not withdraw and end his occupation, military operations would begin
Saddam ignored these and missle strikes Israel to bring them into the conflict and start a massive war in the middle east.
When the deadline hits, UN forces moved in, destroyed the Iraqi military and liberated Kuwait. They ended the war without attempting a regime change. 
This is like a textbook examples for when and how wars should be fought.
In all seriousness, I pray that the pieces of shit who committed, supported & denied this shit be put on trial to answer for their crimes.
I could have sworn something similar happened in the 90s...
I'm noticing a trend here with the Russians...
didn't he say some shit about the Catholic pedo scandal that it shouldn't be looked at as a problem of pedophilia in the catholic church but a problem of "gay priests"
Yeah, it was worse back in the 70s. Back then cocaine would get you a lighter sentence
In this case, hard to say if this is the lone opinion of a single government official or if its broad policy of the current government...or if it was said at all
think people should specify more often the governments of said countries rather than the entire country
meanwhile, on the far right: https://twitter.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1578828428471853056?s=20&t=1TNBYxz7SUuta4lWYzObBA
I would love to ask these anti-humanity fuckers if they think Mahsa Amini was an actual person or some (((Mossad))) plot
Yeah, especially with the Mahsa Amini protests
Like, I've read Noam Chomsky refer to genocidal mass murders as "popaltion exchanges" to ingratiate himself with Serbia so he can bash the evil west; and shit like that leaves me disgusted with the current international left that goes out of its way to justify fascist imperialism in places like Russia, all because they're just the enemy of the US
or more specifically a justification for these countries to do so
I wouldn't necessarily blame the actions of the US (though their activities in the region have been generally moral dogshit for half a century at the least) as a reason for these countries to back dictatorships
but realizing this man is gonna be paying more for egregious libel than corpos have been forced to pay out for literal mass murder is kinda surreal
I'm glad this fucker's getting the shaft
Someone pointed this out to me: Alex Jones is, adjusted for inflation, paying more to these families than Union Carbide did for Bhopal.

can you be specific about who your talking about?
Or is it just random choice anger?
like, does the person you are projecting your anger on...deserve any hate?
Not really sure exactly what your going through in life, but it sounds like you are projecting your anger issues upon something more abstract to you personally but still unhealthy

yeah on the RT shit:
On the one hand, a part of me wants to accept the apologies of Gavin & Geoff, if only because I sorta grew up in my teen years fanticizing of growing up to join AH because it seemed so fun & awesome as a viewer. But I know for a fact that is my nostalgia bias trying its best to force me to forgive people who haven't been forgiven by the people they've caused harm to. 
& another aspect: even if Gavin & Geoff's apologies are genuine, they aren't the only people in the company who've done this shit. Its usually a lot of guys in the backrooms we do not know the names or faces of. 
& finally, while apologies are nice, that's usually only step one; as someone raised half-assed Catholic, I believe that in order to achieve forgiveness, people have to work for that forgiveness. Action speaks louder than words. From what I can tell, in Michael's case, he mellowed out after he started raising kids with his wife (not sure if thats the right term now that Lindsay has come out as NB), and he's been known to correct his fellow cast on Kdin's pronouns. Geoff has been leading every apology video & stream & tweet for RT, though I can't descern if the tears he sheds in those are genuine or crocodile; otherwise I don't know much on Gavin or Geoff since I had dropped off of RT & AH.
So far Kdin has only responded to & accepted Michael's apology. Apparently they've unfollowed Geoff & Gavin, so...probably hasn't accepted theirs.

What happened with Genlock?
The only person who I've seen actually go out of their way to shittalk Monty, in all the years I've been following RT, was fucking EZ;PZ being a racist piece of shit claiming he's actually not born in the U.S. & married Sheena to get a visa (he was born in Rhode Island)
Are you implying that Monty was part & parcel to the abuse? Because I've not heard shit about him
the only downside of this whole event is that I am now readdicted to twitter after several years sober

Well, question I have is: is her apology, well, acceptable? or is she just as culpable as RT?
some suggesting the video was what got her  into RT
Heard offhanded that she was hired a while after
well, i guess the logic is:
Kdin is the one starting this current wave of negative attention towards RT. Because of this incident, she must clearly be lying about her experiences if she said all this shit in an old video
So...the talk's now shifting towards Kdin and a video she made years prior where she said the n-word & f-slur repeatedly.
https://twitter.com/KdinJenzen/status/1582210461470113792?s=20&t=nGz3dVZ7JTCcnL25eC7NEw
yeah, it is tone deaf
I pray for RT's dissilution (which is the only possible potentially positive outcome of all this)

Random question:
Are loteries ethical? Part of me thinks encouraging people to spend their money on a fractional chance for a big payout sounds like gambling. & the fact that due to taxation much of the "prize money" you are told you will recieve will not actually be yours.
I have heard there's a lot of problems with morale & recruitment for the military in recent years (this predates to about the Bush Presidency). 
This is what happens when you illegally invade other countries based on false information. Kinda dampens the mood of the people who serve, and dampens the public mood towards the military

So, visited my grandparents the last two days. Was talking with my dad and grandma about my Grandpa (who died in a car wreck two decades before I was born). 
Found out a lot more about him this time around; apparently was as big of a history nerd as I am (apparently took my dad & uncles on historic tours which my dad complains about whenever he mentions them) honestly, the more they talked, the more I felt depressed I never got a chance to meet him. 
Is that weird? That I have a hangup about a family member I never met? Idk, I just have this underlying feeling that some esoteric force robbed me of an experience I should have had. 
And it's not like I don't like my Step granddad, despite being hardcore republican, he's quite jovial and fun to talk with. And if I got a world where my grandpa didn't die, I'd never know my Stepgranddad, which would be a shame. 
On the other hand...there may be things about my granddad I wouldn't like. When I saw he was obsessed with history: he had a pet dog named Jefferson Davis; & had a Confederate flag in his possession (FYI, he is from Michigan, but had moved to Alabama in the 60s). I get the feeling of I did discuss the civil war with him, it wouldn't be a civil discussion. 
Idk...this may just be a "white guy with no real problems" rant. Just wanted to get it off my chest.
If you want to know just how bad our foreign policy was even in the early 2000s, Donald Rumsfeld (Evil Bush's SecDef who pushed for Iraq because he wanted to blow shit up for CNN to gawk at) was told by experts in the middle east that the Sunni/Shia divide existed & would be a problem if troops went into Iraq; to which Rumsfeld responded along the lines of "What do you know? I helped Reagan beat the Soviets."
And we invaded and sectarianism became a problem immediately
So the US wasn't directly involved in training Bin Laden & future terrorists, but they were inadvertently involved because American foreign policy from Nixon to Reagan was "If they're an enemy of the Soviets, they're a friend of ours"
Tbh the CIA funneled the money to Pakistan for them to spend on the training of the various groups in Afghanistan. Long story short, Pakistan used the money we have them mostly on the Taliban & similar groups in Afghanistan.
I love geopolitics
Ah yes, Saudi Arabia

that's the best summary of what his appeal is
he literally brands himself as an irl Tony Stark
Yeah I hate H3H3 much as the next guy, but this is a worse look for the people he's against
ok, so this is suprising to anyone who literally did not know who Katy Perry was before 2016
oh yeah and did a music video promoting the Air Force for a transformers movie
On the other hand, BEFORE 2016, she spent her career refusing to call herself a "feminist" because she didn't want to alienate the shallow male audience she pandered to.
suprising because she had been "bluepilled" on Hilary and supposedly made that shitfire of an album Witness because of Donald Trump getting elected and her trying to go political
Of course it was half-assed & indirect as fuck in its messaging but still

Been hearing from a few pro-Elon "friends" that Elon is actually helping to curb people falsely claiming to be him and other celebs trying to scam people with crypto shit. 
But these people never provide any evidence...and also claim the shit with Ethan Klein is justified
former owner of Encylcopedia Dramatic, who was banned from the site by his admins after they found out he was selling out their personal information in exchange for meth (and yes, that fucking happened)
please don't tell me he's gonna pull a Brian Zaiger...

the fact they're also an ISWV person as well paints a tapestry
Doubt that B17 was a full crew (I would guess pilot, copilot & maybe the navigator)
Any updates on fatalities? I mean, it'd be a miracle if anyone involved survived
At a distance its hard to tell the exact model, I guessed P51 because of the plane's look & the fact it's an airshow
~~All fighters look the same~~
something did go wrong
A P51 struck the right wing of a B-17 doing a close flyby
the videos are fucking horrific to watch
yeah heard of that too
yes
did some digging
No this guy is legit unhinged. His twitter history is just him ranting about how superior Japanese VAs are without exception and should voice everything
also love how he acts like Conroy has had a monopoly on voicing Batman over the last 30 years

Ladies and gentlemen: the stupidest thing I've ever seen
Will they take down the article? 
Basic human decency and a lot of academic ethics should say yes...
But my doubts are high
So the premise they worked off of, that the US has too few cops, they admit to being false
"There are too few cops in the us compared to other countries"
One dude asking questions later
"Ok, so the US has 1.1 times the average cops per Capita of other countries"
Fascism is an ideaology based on false premises and hypocrisy. 
Its been forever since I've read this, but back in the 30s and 40s, the Dominican Republic was run by a white supremacist fascist regime infamous for slaughtering Haitians crossing the border for work...
But their supreme leader had black ancestry and had to powder his face to look whiter.
Cringe assessment
Thanks Lee Atwater
if you accuse the otherside of having all the negative shit you do, you put the ball in their court and distract people from thinking about your own shitty people

I've seen so many of these ad inserts on a bunch of history tubers' videos, I was actually suggesting to my dad to actually get this shit because I thought it was a legit (and thought it would be funny if I legally became a lord this way). 
Of course one google search later and I pull up an article looking into Established Titles and another similar organization, pointed out that they didn't allow you to visit the supposed plots of land they totally advertised as visitable, along with other shit that made me go "yeah...something's fishy"
And then I see a million community posts from said historytubers apologizing for running the ads...but as far as I know they haven't taken down the videos they ran them on.

As someone who has family with bipolar disorder, I can safely say: Most of this shit is on Kanye
but here we fucking are.
One of the biggest rappers of all time goes on air to confess his love for hitler
Like, if you went back in time and asked someone if Kanye West was gonna talk about how much he loved Hitler, even after all his little stunts at the VMAs, all those mini-scandals, they wouldn't believe he'd sink that fucking low
just putting it into context: if this happened to some big celebrity 20 years ago, they'd just be done. Even then, you wouldn't expect it to happen. Its too stupid to happen
I'm just gonna say this:
I do not take this whole Kanye shit seriously anymore
Like, this is beyond parody. This is beyond anything the world's greatest comedians can write up.

NSW means New South Wales right? Or is this something else
(Bring up Jay-Z because he's the reason why Kanye got big in the first place and had been a longtime friend and support of his for decades)
Anyways, back to Kanye's antisemitism
Anyone remember that one line from Jay-Z's "The Story of O.J." where he just drops this line?
don't sweat it
As someone with family who have bipolar disorder: preach
Thats *Its Always Sunny*
Honestly, he's less an IRL Tony Stark like he & his toesuckers call him, more like an IRL Lex Luthor
You say that and it sounds like they're trying to bash gay people in the process for reasons that I doubt even God knows at this point
I mean, reading the wikipedia page, i see nothing regarding the Tsingtao agreements or promises that Megan suggests the US had made, or them being specifically betrayed by this act
encouraging Japanese imperialism isn't one of them
I mean, America has it fair share of Crimes
And here's the big thing:
FDR (whose actions are the main focus here) had NOTHING to do with the Immigration Act.
To my knowledge, Japan had plenty more options, and weren't railroaded into invading & exploiting the Chinese like your suggesting
I guess if that were the extreme you were suggesting
But in this case...no that is not at all whats going on here. 
The US reneged on some supposed deal (which you've not provided a source for) that included immigration, then put in a bill that killed the immigration portion of the promise, and yet you have provided no evidence that they reneged on other promises
If you aren't making it out like thats the case, why did you say it

This is legit argumentation I hear from Holocaust deniers & Neo-Nazis...one of them Being Putin
It's like saying Hitler was "forced" to invade Poland because they wouldn't give him land
at far as I'm concerned, its a stretch to call the later sanctions & embargo unjustified & that The US "forced" Japan into invading China to be ridiculous
Ok, reading it more
that's immigration to the US, not a trade deal
which was kinda scummy
Basically Japan was presurred to hand over German treaty ports to the Chinese rather than get them themselves
I know about the Tsingtao stuff
your are making this up
didn't happen
yes
.
I tried looking up whatever your talking about, there was no US embargo of Japan in the 20s like you claim]
US turned Japan into one of the strongest economies in the world & a powerful ally after WW2
What the fuck are you on about?
?
Japanese soldiers were casually sending photographs of themselves & their buddies bayonetting children and beheading people back home to their families
Yeah, because Japan in China would have certainly led to world peace if the Americans didn't interfer
Yeah, Imperial Japan prior to December 1941 was doing NOTHING to deserve economic sanctions from evil big government FDR
https://twitter.com/LPNational/status/1600671505590853632?s=20&t=LHx6EVcPqt9tODVNfXwHTQ
And in FDR's case, the embargo only targetted resources necessary for continuing war with China
that's not the point of what I'm on about
That's obviously not what these liberatarians are upset about
They're upset that big government did something, without caring to understand WHY they did it
beyond "We americans also don't want any of them in our country" which is bog standard pretty much to today honestly
Cool
Doesn't bring up the China stuff
as someone on the spectrum myself:
Go fuck yourself Kanye
someone's jealous no one's gonna let him kill people with brain chips
Dave Chappelle insulting his own audience to soothe Elon's feelings is so cringe

Put up with it for now, and then when you get that once in a week oppurtunity, go and aks
take that session then
book an appointment. Schedule it with your doctor or whatever.
<@527865934380138509> I presume you are a young adult like I am (correct me if I'm wrong; doubt anyone over 30 is on this server tho). COVID is really most dangerous to people with weak immune systems, primarily the elderly (which has been the primary demographic of deaths), though many younger people with immune system issues also are threatened. 
I actually "survived" COVID earlier this year...and by that I mean I was quarentined to my room near 24/7 and felt like shit, but in now way thought I was gonna die because of it. 
If you are seriously worried about it, ask your doctor if you can get an examination or consoltation on whether or not COVID would actually be a real danger for you. 
That's my two cents.
Of course war is more complicated than that 
But think of this:
What happens if Churchill or Chamberlain stayed out of the war? 
While his country provided no direct aid to the Soviets in their fight for their own people to survive (keep in mind, Slavs are "untermensch" whom the Nazis intended to exterminate or turn into slave labor), his country and colonies served as a base for American and British forces. If D-Day doesn't happen, if the Allies don't sieze control of North Africa and tie down troops in Italy, or keep Germany blockaded from getting their hands on precious resources like Oil, maybe the Soviets would win and take all of Europe to the Pyrenees...at the cost of millions more lives on their part. 
Britain had to stay in the war if the Nazi regime was to be defeated.
Do you mind answering my question, btw? I would love to hear your answer
Why not? Isn't allowing fascism to fester and aiding it it's existence not complicity
Any man who aids and abbets fascists is, in my book, a fascist.
I'd say you have plenty of fascist leaders. Chamberlain for one for allowing Hitler to fester.
When push comes to shove. Churchill, despite it being "unnecessary" and a "burden", continued to conduct war against the Nazis, never seeking to make peace or any deals with fascists. 
Agree? Any antifascist should on principle
Can't believe I have to explain basic shit like this to you
Like Churchill is a scumbag, but Hitler is on another level of scumbag
Only on the most basic levels could you say Churchill and Hitler were on the same wavelength
It's true Churchill despised Indians. Is it true he used war resources to create and operate death camps in an attempt to kill them all?
And while there was an antiwar movement in America, it was a minority faction just parroting splendid isolation; the pro-Nazi German America Bund was, despite all austentatious shit they did, really an insignificant joke.
And most allies Hitler got he had to coerce into joining. He had to coup Hungary and Italy to keep them from turning on him
It very clearly wasn't my man,
If it was, he wouldn't have been dogpiled by most countries
That's funny. What does that even mean?
Enemy at the Gates sucks
"nonsensically anti Hitler stance"
You mean it's unreasonable to not like Hitler
1.) You act like it would a be a positive for Churchill to abandon Europe to the fascists because "it's be better for HIS people". Quite a sus take.

Also, if Stalin felt threatened by the Nazis, maybe he should have made a reproachment with the west and aided Poland or whoever against the Nazis. Would they accept? Probably not until the Nazis scare Poland enough into accepting their help. Hitler would immediately have been on a two front war, and while the Soviet army at this time was still dogshit, the Germans did not have the resources to hold both fronts. It would have further improved their reputation in the west, and could have avoided the horrific losses they suffered because they decided to wait until the fascists attacked when they weren't ready.

But nope: he aids and abbets the fascists
I would just like to say, Socialism cool. An ideaology based on the writings of a racist German dude aren't
And don't act like I am saying that western liberalism and capitalism are good things either. Christ Churchill is a scumbag
1.) I don't recall Churchill making deals with Hitler to carve up "spheres of influence" like Stalin did. 

2.) Lenin deported guys like Ivan Ilyn with the goal of them spreading their ideaologies to "weaken" the west to allow for a communist victory. if fascism is "capitalism in decline", then wouldn't accelerating the process further the goal of global communism?

3.) I just find it fucking hilarious that communists like Dalton Trumbo heelturn from pacifists to warhawks the second the Nazis invaded the Soviets. These people couldn't care less countries like Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Yugoslavia fall to the fascist boot. No, they didn't care until the Soviets get invaded.
Remember that time when Stalin and Hitler were allies? 
Remember how the Soviets prior to Barbarossa supported fascist regimes because they saw them as the perfect weapons against western capitalism?
Remember how western communists were actively antiwar until the Nazis invaded the Soviets?
And keep in mind, there were people picketing and boycotting the movie for being racist
It wasn't just a thing everyone accepts
Like people use that to go to bat for fuckers like Woodrow Wilson, who actively pedalled the Lost Cause as the Dean of Princeton, to the point he's directly quoted in Birth of a Nation. That's not just someone "of his time", not when they are so proactive in being bigots
Love that whole "for their time" bullshit keeps being pedaled. As if there weren't people who weren't racist back in those days
1.) I never denied or downplayed the fact he's a bigot or wasn't responsible for the Bengal Famine. 
2.) If it was in Britain 's best interest to maintain it's empire, then they wouldn't have stayed in the war and broken the empire through straining and draining of resources.
Of course, I wouldn't suggest this to happen nowadays, only because nukes would be in play. But that wasn't the case during most of the war
What are they called (so I can look them up)
Hold up:
When were the Greeks communists elected? I'd imagine it'd be mentioned once even in commie hating america something along the lines of "look at commie Greece ruining their own economy".
They got 5% of the vote in 07. 
That's not "elected to power", that's just them getting their foot in the door. 
Unless there's like 20+ parties in Greece that somehow had less percentage than them and have to form a coalition with them in order for majorities
This take is as warm as the soldiers in the Stalingrad pocket
Seriously though, every history YouTuber I watch will call this shit out for what it is, and I'm tired of people saying it as if people don't already know.
I see so many comments complaining about "woke revisionism" and I'm like "we're gonna see a black Hermonie go off about how Trans women aren't real women"

Thank christ I was never a big HP fan growing up
J. K. Rowling: "Here's a story about Harry doing the right thing by giving Doby his legal freedom from Draco's dad"

Its basically neoliberalism the series

"arguably slavery apologia" no its straight up just slavery apologia
question is, is there any sign that JKR is actually directly involved in this one?

Wait, I take that back, you're British, you get what you deserve
For everyone in Britain, living with the fact the Torys who ruined your economy are gonna stay in power because your opposition party are a bunch of incompetent neo liberal sellout morons, you have my pity.

Florida Man used to be fun. Now we got this shit
I wouldn't doomer about this at all, unless a shit-ton of democrats turn out to be complete DINOs (which, with Sinema already out of the party now, I don't see many others wanting to be the next her)
thing is, it's not gonna matter much, considering that they only hold a slim majority in the House, and the Democrats hold the Senate & White House. If they ever try to push shit, Dems can just block them from getting any of their bills passed
thank you Republicans for constantly stabbing each other in the back
I will threaten to leave if he isn't banned
I am myself a high rank mod on that server but he's kinda an old guard figure so its something I'll get in hot water for doing without the other admins having their say
I'm bringing this up with my fellow mods to have him banned
I quoted him directly and he just said "stating a biological fact = pedophilia"
I'd share this but I get the feeling he'll just pick apart the source as "left wing propoganda taking things out of context"
tbh this dude is the same dude who posted a transphobe manifesto in a channel relating to the American Civil War so I don't really know why I'm trying to reason with him
I tried showing the "post-pubescent teens" tweet but he wrote it off as saying it "sounded like him mostly but that one part I don't believe" and "tweets can be faked ya know"
does anyone have any examples of that dude going off about pedo shit?
I know a guy whose going off about hiow much he loves Matt Walsh
not gonna lie, Congress just becoming National Fightclub would be better than a bunch of assholes sitting around filibustering everything

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sickles
A friend of mine just pointed out how George Santos represents the same district that voted in Dan "I murdered a man in cold blood in front of the White House and got off scot free with 'temporary insanity" Sickles
I stop considering people opinions when they post a transphobe manifesto under the guise of "suicide statistics"
After a lengthy discussion in the admin room and with the dude in the main channel, I decided to ban the dude. If any of the other mods unban him, I'm leaving the server. Wrote it out in plain terms for everyone to understand
The big issue with me doing what I did last night was the fact that the two server owners I genuinely consider friends, despite defending this asshole. The other dude I have been planning on sharing an apartment with once I get my degree this summer, and though he didn't say shit about the whole situation, I realize it would have been an awkward situation to say the least
So...remember the other night when I banned the guy from my friend's server and threatened to quit if they brought him back. 
Update: They're bringing him back...and I agreed to it. 
A part of me wanted to fight it, but the server owner (who I had gone on a roadtrip with back in 2021) got me in vc and made me feel like shit for "being impulsive". Caved in rather quick. 
We made an agreement. The dude was coming back, but would be on thin water. All political chatter will be concentrated into a single channel, and if the dude acts up again, he gets timed out until an actual decision gets made. 
Not the worst but...honestly I feel like shit after this
Buddy of mine pulled up "comparison between capitalism & socialism" on Bing
yeah
has the industry not learned from the Live Action PPG leaks?
historical colors of the Tsarist era
go ahead, give me a quote, prove me wrong
"china china china", or "chinese chinese chinese"?
I have not
Aren't you from Australia? I can understand it if your country has that issue, but as an American, as someone whose hung out with far right loonies in the past, never once did I hear them pull any legit yellow peril bullshit
And these people were openly islamaphobic, transphobic, homophobic, etc, etc.
Meanwhile the real problem with China is that its run by a bunch of fascists who sold out their communist prinicples for the sake of capitalist greed.
most of it is misinformed anti-communist nonsense
"yellow peril"s been dead for decades
Tbh there's plenty of good reason for people to be opposed to China
And at the end of the day, what the fuck is this committee gonna do, if anything? Say "China bad" or "China did covid"? Like most americans don't believe that already?
Considering that a fuckton of Democrats had voted for it (Republicans only have 222 seats) I get the feeling this is merely to just placate the Republicans so they can get Democrat shit past.
probably over COVID shit
I'd love to hear what he would have said if the headline said the girl was shot:
https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1612632233512255489?s=20
its understandable, but at the same time utterly illogical
(plus honestly Florida is a shithole, let the anglos have it...for now)
Honestly, if the choice was in my hands, I'd prefer nuclear destruction over fascist domination
but that's just me
As a devout reader of Posadas, I think everyones too nuke shy, we should commit to the nuclear dialectic and bring about the apocalypse so we can rebuild society without the decadence of capitalist oppression
tbh I have no clue why China wants Taiwan so bad when its very clear why its never going to join back
Only explanation I can think of is the US falling to a zombie apocalypse or some shit
only gonna be proxies like Ukraine or Taiwan or wherever
~~sadly~~ due to nukes, neither side is gonna do a direct war
they aren't yet on the same level economically as the US (and I doubt they will at the rate things are going), but yeah, the US sees China as the most potent threat to their status as global hegemon. Even if China wasn't run by fascists, or even had the same system of government as the US one for one, the US would still see China as the only nation in the world today who could potentially stand toe-to-toe.
Alright, I concede
indeed, I'll say I've seen that
was refering to the yellow peril as in the specifically anti-asian hate crimes committed because of said belief
my god
you missed the fucking point
The whole point of this conversation is racism towards chinese people
What the fuck is this supposed to say about American chinaphobia? I've looked at the American section of the article, and it does not once mention any "we are banning this because we hate chinese people", most of it is just "Trump and Biden believe the algorithms for the app are a national security threat"
you say that as if I don't think the US keeping Cuba diplomatically and economically isolated wasn't also bad
never brought up in school, its only something you find out if you dig it up
like, thats something most Americans don't know fucking happened
I'll disagree on that
yeah, remember hearing people trying to defuse China's initial flubbing of the pandemic breakout by saying "but after that they've gotten their act together and had had zero deaths in two years".
tbh, the origin of that conspiracy comes from a chinese cult whose leader was kicked out of the country for being a cult leader. So myths like that aren't always western inventions.
Idk, the beard makes him look better
Eh...he wasn't helping there, more concerned with the Salem crisis (which is the bigger existensial threat) than with social reform
Ok
At the least won't mention anything in the current volume
Then Ironwood would certainly be conflicted about carrying out his plan
But he wouldn't just turn on them on the spot
He didn't when Ruby first told him
And he wasn't antagonistic until he found the chess piece
which was better than what happened with Ozpin in the last few seasons
He was being up front with them about his plan from the start
I mean
I care less about that than the whole "Why are you fighting us? We should be united" line coming from the person causing the division of each side in the first place by going against Ironwood's morally questionable but better than nothing plan
I don't know if this counts as spoilers, stuff from v7
~~Though at the same time the main cast keep tossing around the idiot ball and continue to do so into the next season~~
Yeah
v7 has been the best the show's been in its entire existance, in terms of both its writting and visuals
Certainly. 
I do wish the show was more episodic, that they tried to not include needlessly heavy subject like Faunus oppression
Because all that giving the show a plot starting in v3 onward has just left the show in the wilderness, and now its just a glorified macguffin quest with convoluted stakes, convoluted world building, convoluted characters
I am not the biggest Monty fanboy. I respect his work and was upset at his death. 
But I don't buy into the conspiracy that "Monty had a BRILLIANT VISION for the series, but Miles and Kerry and Gray did all in their power to STOP him from achieving his dreams" bullshit that keeps getting spouted by certain folks
And I can't say M&K are complete deamons for fucking up the racial allegory with the Faunus subplot or anything, as they hadn't written a full series prior to that point (Miles as far as I'm aware wrote episodes in the prior two seasons of RvB); the writers who made RvB succede so spectacularly, Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum, took a back seat after s10 of RvB (when RWBY was announced), so they had to go with the next most experienced writers on the team
Same could be said for Symphogear (though I feel Symphogear handles its characters much better than RWBY)
Yeah
Its writting and story and worldbuilding certainly could have been much better imo.
In the early days, they weren't much of a "studio", their animation thing had mostly done supplementary work on RvB's prior three seasons (8-10)
Certainly
I left this reply in the comment
"Hey, your show sucks, watch this other show instead, chuds"
I hate this kinda stuff
Someone the other day posted this shit on the RWBY subreddit
https://i.imgur.com/XnowQca.png
which I guess is why Berserk stands out so much
of course, can't name any off the top of my head
I think there's other stories of large sword weilding characters
I mean
I've only read like 5 chapters/volumes of Berserk up till now
But from what I've read, yeah, can tell you and Solo took some inspiration at least in tone in yalls work
Anyways, shoutout to the one true chad of our time:

https://twitter.com/otakutweetsk/status/1405543765419433986?s=20
season is out?
Don't mention that to Rick Berman
So carrying on the RWBY discussion from <#336297840529899522> :
~~looking at you Milaarc~~
and not get a freaking redemption arc
I'd say I'll only take an edgy badguy if they get a worthy comeuppance
I loved s1 of Symphogear because, despite the dark stuff, and the death and shit, we get impact from it, and in the end, we get a hopeful conclusion, one where the main character injects positivity into the world, whether it deserves it or not
where characters get brutalized and killed to shock the audience, and adds nothing to the further story
idk, maybe I've a scrub softie tired of edgy shit in media
I will just say: I personally don't enjoy deaths in media that feel...purposeless. 
Like, scenes where we see a bunch of random civilians getting killed by aliens/robots/villains...it all feels empty, beyond showing how "evil" the villains are.
But if a character sacrifices themselves to save the lives of others, as cliche as it used to be back in the day, feels way more rewarding to watch. Its why I love Kanade so much, and Mumen Rider (though he survived his encounter; still the most based dude I've ever seen in media). 
I look into fiction as a means of escapism, from a really shitty world without meaning, and trying to find some purpose in a little universe we managed to create.
this
Alright, I'll get broad
Serena and Maria always felt to me a much weaker immitation of the main cast
yeah
I mean, we have been talking specifically about Symphogear thus far
Kanade's death is a tragedy, but one with a bright legacy
With her sacrifice, Hibiki is able to live and surpass her legacy, resulting in the world being saved multiple times
~~oh yeah, its winglet o'clock~~
so, we're on character death?
I'd enjoy Redo of Healer with less irony if we found out the main character was legit crazy and all the factions of the world were more benevolent than he presents them...
But no the show is just trash shock stuff
or Humbert Humberts
Which is a horrible first impression
is the Concert massacre
and the first thing we're really shown of her in action
so our view of her is predicated on what we are shown
But that's never directly presented to us, the audience
I've seen arguments for Milaarc about how Fudou forced her to do the concert massacre, that she HAD to do it or she wouldn't be able to live without the blood he had.
its also about presentation
meanwhile, I enjoyed St. Germain's redemption arc...despite knowing she has killed tens of thousands of people along the way to achieve her confused goal
this
just an excuse for a scene to happen
To thee point where watching it, I could feel really nothing for what was happening because no one involved felt like a real character/person
with characters that have zero personaility besides asshole
I think we've talked enough about a show we shouldn't talk about here
Interspecies Reviewer at least cares about consent
admittantly, that show is infinitly better
well, its a bunch of nsfw sex scenes and shit
They're getting desperatee enough to broadcast something that exists for the sake of shock value
I think RoH getting on TV is a sign that broadcast television is on its hard decline
there's plenty of guro shit out there that tops this
its just a topic thats had a bad history and is a sore spot for a lot of people
no
if you want to talk about it, I'm down for a discussion in dm's regarding it
regarding this situation
I remember what went down months ago
i just never touched the show because I was tired of my ISWV friend constantly talking about how much he loved the show
Redo's morals is basically Eye for and Eye determined by a narcissist
i do gotta say, i know this is an isekai trope at this point, but the girls he recruits just seem to fall for him almost immediately
now i feel less concerned about watching more of this
hope that's the case because he's actually a decent writer
btw these are tagged for spoilers AND NSFW info
||he still manipulates them into joining his team, like the show explicitly shows his inner monologue when he recruited Tarte
But that's a far fucking cry from mindbreaking them with his dick||
and doesn't ||manipulate women into having sex with him||
and the main character isn't a total scumbag
yeah
Watching the "World's Finest Assassin"
I can't believe the show ||made by the Redo of Healer guy|| is actually good...and ||doesn't treat r like an edgy joke||
yeah it seems the show slowly is revealing he has a more sentimental side underneath
||ngl same. Find it hilarious||
considering how vastly better the writing for the Assassin anime has been in comparison
that said...||the show makes it explicit that the way he acts towards the two when he first interacts with them and realizes they have worth to him is to do the good thing and be super nice to them so he can mentally manipulate them into being his obidient subordinates, rather than you know, doing the right thing...
But now I say that I can kinda appreciate that more because it doesn't make him a shallow goodie two-shoes, which would suck if he was the master assassin||
because the two current ones have had pretty crap lives before he met them
will say, it makes way more sense how these girls get attached to him than other cases
yeah
superbadass irl assassin guy gets to pick and choose his reincarnation abilities to min-max and become a godtier assassin
yeah i can tell that's the case, it is tied in the premise of the show
I do have to say about this current arc
||So, he's undercover as a bastard son of a merchant and a prostitute whose been brought in by the father to learn business
I'm waiting for him to say to a client "I was born from a business transaction".||
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE SLOWBURN ROMANCES IN THESE SHOWS JESUS?
like, on episode 7, he has two girls sleeping in the same bed with him
If he told either or both of them "Lets fuck", a hundred percent they'd be out of their clothes in a heartbeat
for example: reading this conversation = cringe
I don't read manga because reading is cringe
oh yeah, wanna say
The candidate shorts are fucking hilarious
like i said...not an isekai expert
||i mean,, thus far in the story, he's not gunning for any relationships wiht the two girls he rescued. Really his one interest romantically is Dia, whom he hasn't been trying to manipulate in the slightest if we go by this definition. And he has given a lot of independence to Maha, as I said before. She's even able to take control of conversations with him, and even calls him out on his manipulative tactics (mainly suspecting that he only rescued her because of her mana abilities).
Hell, of all the isekai protagonists I've come across (and I'll admit to not being an isekai expert), he has about no libido. No lustful glances or groping, and a general refusal to acknowledge any sexuall desires he does have...though Maha has to point out that he's gone to see prostitutes several times as Illig, so, not entirely sexless. I really can't see him ending up in some end-of-series orgy of his own design or intention.
TLDR: this main aint Shitbag Supreme from Redo of Healer||
(Sorry for the wall of text. I've gotten to episode 10 and I just have a lot of things to say regarding your argument here)
||here's the thing though
I don't think he should be thrown under for "manipulating them into loving him", because that was not his intention. He outright denies their sexual advances towards him from episode to episode. In addition, those later episodes hint more that his decisions had a stronger kernel of empathy than even he is willing to admit. 
And add on top of that the issue of, what else was he gonna do with them? Leave them on their own devices, when they are still weak and easily abused by others? Put them in an orphanage (which would be especially traumatic in Maha's case to put her back in an institution which has caused her emotional pain)? He's brought them up in the world; Maha's running Orna with he friends, and Tarte has a surrogate family who actually care for her. 
I feel like this quick sumation of his character as "manipulative" is not the full story. Its like saying Jaime Lanister is a piece of shit for fucking his sister and pushing a kid out the window in the first episode, ignoring any later revelations about him as a person.||
huh
1.) What's muvlov?
2.) Whats cursed about it?
I thought I was a weeb
But now I'm shown I am but a farce
did someone say...shameless pug?
the s10 finale made middleschool edgelord me cry for the first time since my cat ran away five years before
And I did enjoy s9 and 10, though the epsilon unit stuff of 9 is just...cringe
Season 6 and 8 were the fucking best btw
this was orginially uploaded without any titles or episode numbers, just "Tex beats the shit out of RvB"
I feel old now
So, RvB/RWBY discussion from <#336310266654490624> carrying on...
i think at the end of the day is, i don't really like fights where the characters don't matter, but instead focuses on what skills they have
hot take: Yuuki Yuna is what happens when you give a "high concept" magical girl show to a lazy director
Hibiki is a more interesting character than Yuuki Yuna
Wins by defeault
but now I'm kinda tired of the "Who would win in a fight" type of debates
Death battle was fun back in ye olden days of the internet
...soiled it...
not gonna lie that song do slap tho
this is a fucking treasure and I thank you for this
what show be this
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO!

Tbh v7 and 8 are actually good overall despite blips of stupid (like Robin being an idiot and needlessly starting a fight between Clover and  Qrow; or all the shit they did with Ironwood in v8).

<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIaCdthw5qM
may neeed to move this to spoilers
yeah,
Lets say that RWBY is a complete mess until v6...and even then its still a trainwreck, just one being brought under control
But this must be fucking painful for a non-fan/new viewer who has little context about RWBY and will need a neckbrace to keep up with whats given. Not that what they have isn't enough material to understand things, just the show doesn't really give time to anything
I get that
yeah
else this is just RWBY Kai Abridged
Feel it should have been given a fourth episode to give these scenes some time to breath and for the audience to get used to the characters and understand whats happening
yeah, in general:
I like how they streamlined a lot of the plotpoints and subplots of s1, at least in the first two episodes. But my god is the pacing neck shattering by the time you get to episode 3. If I did a shot for every scene in ep3 that lasted less than 15 seconds, I'd be dead before the halfway point
posted my thoughts ont his back in <#377148557796442134> . I feel this has its ups and downs
my friends ranted about how RT has been handling the marketing and stuff for this project, as well as everything they've done (or not done) recently
well, now I don't feel as obligated to get back to writing my 50 different projects now
why couldn't i find it in search
huh
Any RWBY fanfic coniseurs remember "Lost Rose"? I remember reading it on FF.net a long time ago and it was like my favorite fic ever, binge read that shit back in early 2020. Decided to go give it another read, as I never really finished it, but I cannot find it on FF.net or AO3. I forgot the name of the author, I hope it isn't a case of it just being disappeared off the internet one day

I wish there was a consolidated version of this but, god, these remixs are great. 
Tfw an album has three songs and all three are perfect
Great song
King Crimson is less a rock band now and more of a Jazz Metal supergroup
But yeah, that was when they had the original lineup with Gregg Lake and Ian MacDonald
I say partly because he was never the "Sex+drugs+Rockn'Roll" type
Robert Fripp shook hands with Jimi Hendrix in 69. The fact this man is still touring is partly shocking.
Saw King Crimson last night. Pretty good. Not as good as the last performance i saw in Atlanta back in 2018, truncated set which felt more like a highlight real of a concert on shuffle play. Performances were fantastic though, not critiquing them for that. Just wished the set had more juice and wasn't so bizarrely structured
Yeah, seems he was suffering from diabetes. Pretty cool dude despite being the most "uncool" thing of his day
Conversations look so weird when two different users use the same character in a similar profile

Interesting video about how "music theory" is taught often in the narrow confines of the classical white male german composers from the 1700s and doesn't accomadate for other peoples and cultures
https://youtu.be/Kr3quGh7pJA
love the lyrics, think its about him arguing for God to give him a sign of his existence. fucking beautifully written
digging through late-era David Bowie and I come across absolute treasures like this: https://youtu.be/PjhWM_Ubspg
oh yay, BTS MgNuggit Meal
Yeah, this album on my recent listens has jumped upp in my rankings
https://youtu.be/K-N_xAOOn2w I'm reloving this album
on a more lighthearted note: https://youtu.be/AdKbloadwEA
https://youtu.be/cXzuQH_I7WM KB wrote this about a roadie from her live tour who died in a preconcert accident.
https://youtu.be/_w-igWCa16Y Trent did work with David Bowie back in the 90s. Obviously was a big influence on him, and listening to his vocal performance on this, and the recorded vocals by Bowie...fuck
Sadly I'm not a Nirvana guy, may need to check the album out again someday and see if I actually like it
So...listened to this for the first time last night...when I was suffering from an emotional breakdown.
Good song tho. Certainly the weirdest thing I've listened to in a while.
https://youtu.be/Vkfpi2H8tOE
honestly prefer Pigs and Sheep over Dogs, tho
that entire album is fantastic
https://youtu.be/YBbH6EsNBAQ
https://youtu.be/oOhjZJyNOx4
And then in the 90s they went back to being a heavy act
really stands apart from most other prog-rockisms I'd gotten tired of after listening to 50 other bands do the exact same sound with now "progression"
that was honestly the best lineup
yeah
i find it insane that Belew was a Nashville bar band guitarist before he got recruited by Frank Zappa, and just hops around to Bowie and Talking Heads, leads a new incarnation of King Crimson (which also was their best)
also because Adrien > Fripp, fight me
I think Remain in Light is their best album, their most cohesive and excentric
and Adrien Belew did all that awesome guitar stuff on Remain in Light (and nearly replaced David Byrne as the band's frontman, which would have been fucking interesting given his King Crimson output)
Know Fripp played on I Zimbra
I know what your gonna bring up
yeah
yeah, I honestly love that album more than Low (though everyone says Low is better for some reason)
Ziggy Stardust, Alladin Sane, Young Americans, Station to Station, Heroes, Lets Dance, Black Tie White Noise, Earthling, and Blackstar
All of these I consider S tier
Will say, I think Zappa, Beefheart and Lou Reed have gotten me to lvoe Doowop https://youtu.be/M59puEnSvd8
but idk
I know I say that after my criticisms of Zappa
Safe As Milk has a lot of good stuff on it, but it just seems to reserved and normal for the guy
Trout Mask Replica is something I go back to from time to time
yeah
https://youtu.be/Nb8Zxjnw4sI Personal favorite track of his right here, for once he takes a subject with some seriousness
oh yeah them
because it involves the least cringe comedy
and his best
Yeah Hot Rats his his most "commercial" album
but he drenches his stuff with his out there humor
i like a lot of his stuff

So, this popped up in my recommended
https://youtu.be/a65A626Ed20
https://youtu.be/azdwsXLmrHE I love everything about this song...except the chorus
also...this is probably the most depressing song in his entire catalogue now: https://youtu.be/U1zQwl4scf0
Bowie is one of those artists who I'd probably do covers of not just his hits but his deepcuts
https://youtu.be/KJWBstZDisI
Just discovered this deepcut...appareently Bowie first wrote this back in 1971. Dude sat on this king shit for literally his whole fucking career
insane this man started his career with 60s pop music and ended it making batshit experimental music
https://youtu.be/BjRMxDdZ86g
This shit fucking slaps
https://youtu.be/F2HH7J-Sx80
https://youtu.be/K-N_xAOOn2w
https://youtu.be/nSpBs1ghyoo This is probably in my top 10 songs of all time.
imagine writing two of the best albums in your genre only for them to not sell, spending a decade of your career tethered to your label, performing the shittiest cover songs ever, involved in some of the worst albums ever concieved, and for your last album get off your ass and write absolute bangers like this before having the nuttiest solo career ever https://youtu.be/T9uIHjbt8zw
Been on a Kanye binge recently
This has become the most retroactively depressing song in his entire catalogue
https://youtu.be/B3NmMKfl3Ic
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums.
https://youtu.be/d3EOerHk47U Holy shit this is incredible
https://youtu.be/tflchAt5kJw
https://youtu.be/vLtmmFjxSoc
I am a slut for harmonies like this
Found out just now this song (which I thought was the actual outro for the Rumours album) actually wasn't on the original release. Apparently the other band members (Fleetwood and Buckingham) thought it didn't fit the tone of the rest of the album...which is just them being idiots for not realizing its the perfect cathartic ending for this album about the tumult of relationships...or Buckingham wasn't happy having a song specifically shaming him for his breakup with Nicks, which would be funny knowing he was fine with slagging her off on "Go Your Own Way"
Anyway, great song
