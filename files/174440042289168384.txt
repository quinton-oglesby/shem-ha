this will go well
well..
hmm...
let's see what happens here..
and I know yours with Rakhi's character
so I know people's frustrations with certain characters
as a listener
I've been in your game
you forget
Saki
and...
this is far from a finished game
there's only one certainty that I know right ow
lol
true
count up your crimes
So...
Saki Akatsuki...you have a roll in this
Saki-san...
I believe I know who is one of the killers
he prefers to kick stuff
Kabuto doesn't even use a gun
neither do I...
who would have the motive, Saki?
out of the three
so...
and...I know that I wouldn't do so
I don't think Shirabe would pull that
owever
I did
Saki Akatsuki...is there something you may want to share?
that we do, *Akatsuki-san*
it would be a little bit unusual if the killer had a personal motive
in fact....
that it does
that it's far from done
except of one thing
a little bit, but...not completely sure
this is Fine's hell that we're all living in
we'll see what happens...
sad
I simply observe
what motive might I have to have characters killed off?
again
Saki...
Kabuto doesn't use a fan either
nice try, Saki
that's...just brutal
ouch
you and Kirika...you're family, are you not?
we'll see about that...
may you pass through to the great beyond in peace
show your hand further
do it, Saki
okay...then vote lucifer
Fine is demanding BLOOD
they aren't absurd
Saki
yea
anyone who knows me KNOWs that
I cna't lie to save a thing
Saki
however
that it is
there could be a number of reasons
1 of which was Rakhi
there are certain characters who the GM, Saki, has been upset with withint he session
HOwever...
I play as a neutral observer and provide feedback to players
My sole role inside the game is this
what reason would that be?
now...
the 2 people killed off first have been characters inside of SAKI's RPG
is this
and lady
the question now, gentlemen...
so
I wanted to see how SHE would react
in any case
but
oops
but, I did want to bait Saki to see how he'd respond
I voted Saki and stayed there
Nope
I had to go back and reword it
I voted Saki
I knew it was you from night ONE
Saki
LOL
and i"m the popo
We do this round
I'm the POPO
I'm a cop in this game
I have a special role...
Know how I know, Saki?
```when I already KNOW that you're MAFIA```
why would i need to do that
Frame you?
I observe and comment
yeah...that's a good idea
ah...
NL?
there's a doctor role now...
that makes it interessting
and the game begins again
it's time to  duel, Jaden
so...new game, new round
what you did was win the charisma round
you fooled no one
I guessed you night 1
Skai
but NO
I told you guys
told you guys
none...but you all just made a grave mistake
a shame
*5
that's 6
oh yeah
that's what, 5 of 6?
Saki
this will be itneresting
yea
yeah...I wonder what other roles there are for this...
no lynch
yea
yeah, it's a no lynch round
there's some suspicion here..but, I think that I can believe scrms
hmm...
yeah....was interesting
...man...Fine's really getting into the role
no lynch
we have no clues to go off
the reason being that we have no motive
not really
no
and I don't know how possible that is
I'm trying to think while eating
I made the wrong choice at that time
when I had cop last round, I had to choose whether to say somthing about it or not
who have been the quietest in these rounds?
he nearly beat me in a duel once, and has shown tremendous potential
no...I ahve nothing but respect for Jaden's skills
yeah...scrms this time seems trustworthy. No...the question is, who would do something
yeah...fine really enjoys doing that...
like...I feel sick, that was gruesome
holy Ra
holy...
so if Rakhi's a cop....
okay....
?
holy mother of ra
holy...
that's the question, Rakhi
that's just cold
...ouch
I said Homura
homura
yea
is that all we are to you, Fine? Or did my wings of flame not get the point across?
shit
...it was ibu
hmm...
<:MekuSad:451558184952266752>
lily
yea
we have multiple cops this round
let's go over the info again
unless there's something we're missing
yeah...I'm pretty sure we're ready, Fine
same
so we're down to 1 mafia...
we're at 2 per...
Was thinking Jaden might be a cop, based on the info he gave
so wait...
and that someone else was saved?
they tried to get someone else....
but....
so shirabe got the ax
so wait...summarize this for me
...wait...what just happened?
no lynch there puts the mafia 1 step closer to winning
hmm...
no lynch, though it's risky
I think it could be carry over...
but...
yea
like...if you look at the style...
no worries
6 of us left...
well...
right...but damn...
I don't think any of us here did
uh...
that's...
like...damn
woah...
just...woah
oh? I bet it will
ohayou, chibi-miku
it's possible, but only for the vigilante if they kill a townie
R...
not by process of role elimination
there's no other possibility
either a mafia, or a townie
Shirabe is one of 2 things
so SHirabe wasn't the doctor
the doctor made a save this round
as such, they couldn't save anyone
Shirabe died
no
thought so, Fine
if SHirabe was the vigilante, they wouldn't be dead at this point
hmm...
can the doctor save someone, and then get offed themself?
then that leaves either lily, the now dead shirabe, or myself as mafia....
if we assume that all of this is true...
I"m operating off of an assumption for now that he is the doctor at the moment
that's true
yeah....definitely tricky
heh...
we can't eliminate the possibility that Shirabe is a mafia member
yeah...and there's 5 of us left
or we may have an idea who it is
so we know who the doctor is
okay...
they wouldn't be, you're right
they could have accidentally gotten a townie instead
just because the vivgilante killed SHirabe, doesn't mean that they got a mafia member
and again, it adds even more confusion to things
yeah, that sounds accurate
but I"m still trying to wrap my head around what happened
if we did, that'd be interesting...
...
wouldn't wish that on anyone
...cold
although I don't feel confident in that at all
miku
this is going to be a telling vote
yea
who was it that suggested the NL in round 1?
something's been bugging me, miku
nothing's an absolute...so we have to take the best possible guess
if Shirou is the vigilante, and all we can go on is his word and what Fine said
I just don't know what
...something doesn't sound right here
oh you know the truth already, miku?
back to square one on the logic train
...well there goes that idea
the other possibility is that the mafia member is also doubling as another role
if the vigilante commits suicide this upcoming turn, we'll know that they hit a townie
let's jsut go off of that for now
okay, let's say that the vigilante killed them
assuming that we use that setup for that role
but that is VERY interesting
Fine wants blood
Fine...isn't happy
but...that is interesting
oops
this...is interesting
well...
go
we
here
at all
Fine's not happy...
no lynch
yea
same
we have nothing to work off of
that might not be a bad idea...
5 people in game
yeah...it's a really tricky one...

Not for a while
Serenacon2018 is not over...
Or her spamming daggers on unsuspecting non-believers
Serena has harsh punishment for nonbelievers
Serena making it rain
Stull...
Serena fest, huh?
Ill sign
I tend to think that having that shown is...kinda needless as well, for the reasons Alice and R outlined above
would be interested in helping arrange for it, but dunno about actually singing for it
Third the petition for saki
I think I’d be okay with that; got people writing about different things now, but should be easy enough to keep figured out
don't need to apologize
You’re welcome
Huh...cool name

Welcome
Welcome to all the new people

TojiTomo is a lot better balamced than XDU; I just stopped playing bc I had an issue updating and stupidly forgot to copy down my account info
Welcome
been a while, lol
lol
is that...?
wait...Lava...
Welcome
Welcome
Welcome
LOL
I'm open to being proven wrong though
<@360948295113375756> I don't even remember your idea, so show me what you got. Excuse me for not having total confidence.; KR is easy to screw up.
hmm....
true
Liger Zero for Bikki?
true
Basa...Blade Liger
I can totally see CHris piloting a red version of her Gun Sniper
she really was
the Lena Tauros Special, LOL
I remember that Zoid...
not bad work
how big is that gonna turn out?
you're actually making that?
...
I"m looking now
...i'm watching Gaim right now
?
Will try to look it over after work
...whut did I just read?
you forgot the important part
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:TsubasaExcited:409481619842400257>
...ouch, man...sucks
Staying out of the tropes, but she is prob the best character on the show
How the hell did I not recognize, since I watched all of seasons 4 and 5 since the last time RWBY got brought up when I talked to you?
...wait...
Huh...cool character.  What show?
That...would be funny
Plus, it does explain some of her more...possessive tendencies
At least, thats what canon says
Drugs came after shed agreed
...dang
Damn...fhat was BRUTAL
Solo...WHUT
...of middle school, and of how dumb the Us government is being right now
...dont remind me...
probably
yep
Fine tries to jump over Basa and gets cut in half
Massive dump
the Goku one, I mean
per the wikia
and the pic you used is technically called "Ultra Instinct-(Omen)"
oh...that'll be a funny joke for <@456226577798135808> to make in RTT
...does that mean that Hibiki already has Ultra Instinct mastered
it's not
Maria would totally enjoy that
that cuts deep
...damn...
rewatched that ep tonight
well...they essentially scrapped that
man...they destroyed their ignite...gonna be interesting to see how they handle things fro S5
aight, <@284390402210136064> ; dunno if you're done recording, but if not, gomen
yep
that picture is...interesting
that art is...interesting
woah...
That she has
Ooh...the black dress Bikki and the white dress Miku...solo, the imagery there
...to my barely awake self
it's funny
LOL, Magical Girl Chris
GUNGNIR Datto?
Bikki’s a tough one.  She can handle a lot
And the one time she had a bunch of crystals literally growing out of her body
Yep
Rukia got me to watch it; was pretty good. Some seasons are better than others though
...we will convert you
okay, Rukia? That pic just now?  Badass
Precures.  Cure White and Cure Black
white and black...classic
...LOL
amen
Pop Team Epic...has some really weird moments in it
Prisma Illya is...a thing
....no thanks
LOL
b/c it looks pretty good
hmm...whoa re you drawing?
lol, you're good
agh, the handholding...so lewd
need more Yuri Camp
Got enough Mio?
yeah...looks amazing
LOL
that is HILARIOUS
...not even gonna get into my relationship history...how things ended p with one ex of mine was...not fun
impressive
Was wondering when you started playing that
Lol
Nice
yeah...she's an A cup
B81/W57/H83
basa's sizes are...
like I said...that's a guess
she's prob a high-end a or low-grade b
yep...
they look like something CLamp would have drawn
woah
Runner's thighs are a thing
and BIkki blushing b/c Miku put a ring on it
she got them while running, probably
Good work, Joe
Interesting pic
Everyone has things they enjoy
Not gonna even debate on this one...i dont get why people enjoy her like that, but to each their own
...yeah
Yep
...she really is that
I see tons of Bikki pics...good selection
What show is that?
How to test him...
Hmm...
and of course they crossed swords....
that they did
am using the 2nd one Rukia posted right now
Yeah
Ibu, can you put some of those in a .zip file?
I mean, I like the Basa pics, but...man...
Holy overkill, batman
...dude...ibu...
Oh?
Got time
Thanks, ibu
...not me,  but shes still the boss lady
...and Alice trumps Kerrik immediately
ありがとう, ibu
...solo, the fact that you got me to think about putting something like it into something else im working on should tell you my thoughts on it
<@!284390402210136064> , just make a .zip of some of your best Basa stuff and sned if you can?
we need more talented artists...
huh...how many of those alternate gears you got?
need AnH Bikki
woah
man...I still want to see that one of the wieldrs in a Ghost int he Shell Stand alone Complex 2nDd Gig Opening style lineup
...Basa, but that's b/c basa is waifu
...now I have the idea for that in my head...
would be VERY entertaining
yep
if they ever met, I get the feeling they'd get along REALLY well
yep
I did it
Hi
*raises hand*
...
Suit yourself; Im gonna enjoy it
She looks like shes lost her mind
Ypu gave me that pic
Solo

...yep...that’s...a problem
Interesting
Massive Chris dump, I see
Plz don’t burn, hahaha
...ohiBasahowareyou?
LOL
....don't have a favorite Autoscorer
heh...
arigatou, ibu
...don't have much stuff...just a humble writer trying to get better every day here
nice
relevant GenRyoko
<@!284390402210136064> , any luck on the Basa .zip? No worries if not
Photo dumps remind me...
Chris he foodie
I was talking about the one you posted
fun stuff though
interesting
hmm...
the babsa zip?
very nice finds, ibu
I'm gonna have fun with this...
eyp...
THIS. IS. SYMPHOGEAR.
Madness?
however...Rukia, have to ask; this Twintail better than your favorite B.D.?
I watched...2 episodes, then stopped out of sheer WTF factor
possibly the most confusing part of that show is how Tail red isn't normally a chick either
yep
...Rukia, you're the one who talked me into watching that
eh...
just a curiosity
...I kinda wonder what it'd look like
there's a part of me that seriously wonders what Chris would look like without her hair in the twintails like that
Yep...Chris+Glasses is...dangerous
LOL, Carol doing standup, LOL
amen
amen, man
The award for best scientifically made fireball goes to...
LOL
Thats tough
But, if Ihad to pick just one...
Totally
...
Can prob guess my preferred Basa pairing from the reaction to her and Chris pics, haha
LOL at the last one
Yes...need more...
Basa the dragon lady
...and do what to Miku?
Yeah...be tough to
Goodpic, Solo
...lol
Shes literally a chick magnet
But now she acts noninterested, haha
Yep
I think all the wielders are gay...although Basa acts asexual. Shes a sword.
Like that stopped millions of Yaoi fangirls on any other show
...eff that
Hell, by the end of GX i thought Hibiki said something like how she should be honest with herself about how she felt towards Miku?
None
Not so sure that Id say she’s ambiguous
Who, Hibiki? Ambiguous?
...the other discord has become kinda...irrelevant to me at this point
I think Nana’s the same way
She enjoys her work too much
Given how Aoi Yuki pulled the groping of Chris, who knows, haha
...LOL
Just for that reason alone
I dont look at 4chan
Why? Like...whats the point of that
...uh huh...
What type of crap they saying?
Like...depends on the subreddit
4chan...the red light district of the internet, if the red light district was a horrible mess
Maria...is a Jigglypuff
Would be interesting...and also never gonna happen in a gacha game
Lol
Define the problems? The guy abuse her, or was it the other way?
Wait...what?
Like...you dont get that good without sacrificing a LOT to reach tbat poinf
I think Nana’s music is her life
God...I dont remember who it was
And she got SLAMMED bc ofit
There was a story about an idol who became pregnant by her manager’s hands
Nana’s singing is her life
?
...lol wut
Lol
Impossible to outdo the gary stu at bad ideas
...nope
Gungnir kids
True
Didnt you have an idea for that?
Damn...impressive
But damn....I dont have epilepsy, but I didnt wanna give myself a seizure from how much it was flashing
Right
Had to stop after 10 seconds
Yeah...tried to watch the Basa video...
Plenty of St Germain, I see
Yeah...dont care to give myself a seizure, but poor basa
outdo yourself
...keep trying, ibu
She has to set her goals somewhere
All of that was just a dream...odds of Yuru Camp getting season 2 are?
You might as well write a bot that DLs and sorts it for you at this rate
...youre never gonna catch up completely
Miku and her “Hibiki x1000 in 10 seconds” skills
...not a shock there
Just saying that its an incredible amount to have
Youre fine, man
Lol
Dude...insane
...and you keep adding more images, too
I could see Basa at...22?
Also, I think I like the idea of a slightly bigger age gap between Basa and Momria
Would make him have to grow up fast
That works
Let’s place ShiraKiri at like...12?
Let’s put Momria at like...22-24. Where is Tsubasa at for the start of this?
So lets think for a minute...
Right
Right
Would put Maria at like...25ish?
Maybe they dies of like...a car crash or an illness of something
Okay...
Didnt Maria already adopt ShiraKiri?
Thats fair
Okay
Depends on how old you want ShiraKiri to be
Meanwhile, Maria’s been saddled with Shirabe and Kirika since she was...let’s say 18
Just graduated, if 24
Right
Hopefully the start of GX arc is another leap forward though
I’m...okay; still refining my style a bit
Well, this IS. A really good idea
Again...who’s putting this into actual existence
Amen, Shinku
So...who’s gonna write it/draw it
Didnt think so
TopdAd doesnt play much role in thisidea, does he?
Someone should write that
Dude....
Oops...meant team
Maria’s the tern momthough of Kirika and Shirabe...
...she says as she's bleeding out of her eyes and mouth
dude...
That’ll work
Okay; Shinku, can you put it in a wordpad or some sort of doc format?
Im gonna have to copypaste this into a doc when I get home
Okay...
Huh...missed some stuff, I see
and couldn't the treads in theory snap f one does sliding turn too much?
right
b/c...well, you wouldn't think tanks could drift all that well
I just find that awesome
....driifting tanks, man...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nunmlwLoJqY
it's awesome
...I found an AMV of Night of FIre to the movie
actually just marathoned GuP today
Nana is something more than Human at this point
yeah...the show is VERY entertaining, but....not sure what to think of the pricetag on the game when I could just as easily order a 10000 Yen card from Play Asia and DL it from the JPN PSN store
not too big a fan of that price
$85.00? Eugh....
right
I don't think it idd
have one...did that ever get released in the west?
right
it's prob better to be more carefulw hen turning with a tank then, and only try a sliding type turn when absolutely needed
thought so...
b/c of the weight
...someone got that gif available?
Thats my question
Yeah...it went WAY overboard
Yeah...it was...bad
Yeah...something’s not right
Go big or go home, ibu
that's one of my favorite Memoria to use in XDU
...it's funny that she's doing that...
dunno...would be cool though
Yeah...staying out of the fetish talk
...true
Thats not that many
Shes firing her LASAAAAAZAAAAAAA
Miku has a flood of tears streamig down her face at the sight
Giant Bikki
Yep...need plenty of that to heal your brain afterwards
Like...there are enough writing sins committed in it that...its HORRID
Just prepare yourself to deal with horrors beyond your wildest imagination
...wrong section? If you want to know the divisive one...
Doesnt change that the sun and moon anime goes totally against what wed been used to with the Pokemon anime
Yeah...he got hit with the reset button for Alola
Its right up there with Sinnoh on my watchability list for the Pokemon anime
I have seen Kalos
I guess the dude had like 6 legendaries
He was at his higest in Sinnoh and got beat down by Tobias
Serena remains the only chick Ash’s travelled with who actually said anything
But Kalos WAS amazing to watch too
Dunno why
Prob my favorite region is Sinnoh though
I but yeah...I actually have XY and XYZ on my netflix watch list
Meant Sinnoh and Kalos
Meant Kalos
Sinnoh and Kalos
The Pokemon anime...there are only 2 regions of it I actually like
...and off he goes?
Yep
Its not; but, its highly discouraged by the culture
...fancomic
Thats asking for issues
It is a good show
Yo ho yo ho, a pirates life for them?
...wtf
But is it Yandere Miku level mad? Thats the question
Yep
...brain bleach plz
For Kalos it was
Yep
Poor her
Will do
And what’s the skill looking like?
Nana has the power...she should use it how she wants
Any leaks on what the Pirate Basa can do?
By abusing it? Shes not abusing it. She’s putting it to use
Thank you
Thank you; thats now saved to my phone for ease of use
...didnt know they were voiced by the same VA. But...if thats the case, cue the Nana wills it gif
Basa and Collette arent even remotely comparable!
https://twitter.com/jyudo_fu/status/979524685024002048?s=21
...why would they do this?
they talk about the average day at YamateTomete HQ?
...sounds like a great day at the YT subs house
yep...totally
Good gif work
Okay.
They’re both HELLISHLY effective though
Although...friendship punch isnt as OP as...Befriending laser blast to the face
Yep
Define “befriend”
but, usually a good suggestion, Shinku
wouldn't fit what I'm loooking for it for
and you can't find anything
...that feeling when sometimes you need some kickass rock music to get you going on something...
which reminds me...
let them take their time....
go for it, man
critical hit
its supereffective
Befriending Punch
yep
yep
yeap
possibly
what, the BasaMiku accident?
?
taking the last one, thanks Kerrik

...eh...
...yep
you're never gonna catch up at this rate
man...
....
I watched the trailer for “Happy Sugar Life”’s anime last night
...please dont remind me
good cosplay
they really took that tot he extreme
...Basa has bigger boobs than Tail Blue...
Gracias, Kerrik
^this
Wasnt gonna
Yep
Well yeah; not saying that its a bad thing to get the yuri and gear art
And so the question is, can you keep up with that rate?
Bc new art is always being created
I would say though that youre asking a lot of yourself
Wouldnt say that
...Kerrik, get a bot written for this, man
...is lost
....yep
you never play NEgligee?
and no, not necessarily
...I don't need Basa cutting herself
Chris wishes Basa would make up her mind
Have you read the insane thing in the NSFW channel yet?
GuP is really good
Yep
And Ive also gotta get Yuka Iguchi’s next single, “Unlock”
Gotta get more Basa stuff
...yep, CDJapan’s getting a visit from me
Nice find
...hello
Lol, Katyushachu
...interesting
Between him, Rukia, and ibu...they are team ping for pics
Went so fast it makes your head spin
Yep
<@!263983345669505025> , got a zip of BasaChris?
<@!263983345669505025> , how much BasaChris do you have? And can I request a .zip folder of some of your best of that?
...kerrirk, Ibu.
...now im reminded of something...
Totally canon
In other words, thanks for the .zip link
Arigatou
ありがとう
...dunno
Coming for PS4
There is a GuP game
Yep
Looking right at the Kanade and Mikugeah events in particular
No...I mean the events as well
Bc merch money
Or watch them find a way to connect the game to the anime bc reasons
I want the XDU singles
...Amen
I just ordered GuP dream Tank Match
Yeah...I will not be held captive by the gacha
But I spent like...5500 gems to do it
And 3 XD Mikus
And enough XD basas to have a 56 one
...last XD festa, I pulled enough XD marias to have a 58 one
I am not a captive of the gavha, damnit
no...I will...resost
If its XDFesta...
...FUCK
<@106866895076003840> its not XDFesta, is it?
How so, lily?
Basaroth
Solo...dont remind me
...
...oh SHIT
That is EERIE
solo...dude...
OH SHIT
Oh shit
Not yet
Hibiki, you ge tpossessed?
Oh damn
Thanks
I need more Maho or Hana...
Then theyre introed to other series
Those 3 shows are your gateways
So its becoming more widely accepted
Professional athletes are open about their anime love here
...its a culture that is spreading
Give me Maho or Hana all day erry day
Isnt Yukari your best girl in that show?
I just ordered it off amazon
Already out, too
All the relevant
yep...she uncomfy with it
huh...
catmom/babysitter Maria?
LOL
Like...what else does she carry in the backpack?
As in she’s...the military otaku who’s ready for anything
I mean thy in a good way
Yukari is essentially a meme at this point
Gimme Hana or Maho...I keep flipping between which one
And youre entitled to that
I still prefer anglerfish team bc reasons
Yeah...that was insane
Tribal Bikki ftw
Gimme Maho or Hana...Yukari’s energy is contagious though
Yukari with a grenade, hahaha
LOL
...too bad the audio seems silent on mobile
Good find there, ghost
Ooh...Maho
Alice rules over us all
Isnt that sealed off?
Yep
LOL
...
yep
just think it looks like a decent drawing
I like the long-haired Bikki image
It really could mess one up
Woah...Chris in the shade
Ugh...temporary error
Thats it though; I have it saved to my phone
Was giving me a weird error
Was trying to post that, but Icant get to my icloud for some reason
Praise Nana, now
I wish that’d get a second season, but...not getting hopes up
Nice
Good times
Kanade the governor
Lol
LOL
Nice, Ghost
Chros, Kirika, and Kanade...as chinese acrobats
Yeah...the expression almost makes her look crazy
LOL @ gear characters playing XD
...waiting for Kerrik to hit Super Photogatherer levles
Miku enjoys feeling Hibiki’s fists
I have testament as my alarm clock
Or, none of the above; Nana cuts the door open and then hits one with the godly singing voice
Aoi all day erry day
Possibly
Yep
Prob bc shes appearing in plenty of events as is
Still needs a sequel event
Yeah, but thats it
Need more events with Edgebikki involved
Edgebikki’s Miku was forced to move away after the zwei wing concert, leaving Edgebikki to deal with the bs she dealt with on her own
Nope
Not as openly gay about her feelings as Miku prime
But edgebikki’s Miku is totally okay with it
So much sufferig
Eh...if it was in that situation, itd be tough to see them trusting her with any of them
...dont get the wheels spinning please
*twitch* *twitch*
Fine child care
Edgebikki needs Miku to just screw her already
...Basa in twintails...what
Short haired Chris? Interesting
Sen 3 is awesome
But...thats just how she is
Maria would only get a bike outfit to try to impress Basa
...basa may not be able to draw, but...
Man, Maho > Erika all day every day
Cool GX mural
Bikki out there doing Reverse Rasetsu I see
LOL
...sure, why not
...okay, i see you Maho and Miho
Amazing ride on the Kondocoaster
LOL
right
Dunno the conversion off the top of my head
Im at 6’2”...
cyulture is important
Interesting
So about...23 cm or so taller than Basa
I wonder if I could get a custom Basa shirt made...
HAHAHAHAHAH
LMAO
Bikki in Higurashi setting, go
Just...why would anyone do such a thing?
...why?
I THOUGHT I WAS DONE WITH YOU, THEN YOU PULL ME BACK? WHY
WHY, GAME? WHY?
...wait...what? Biker Maria and Basa event? What?
Yep...8 days after mine
Lol, Basa wanting attention from Maria, only for her to be playing a video game
Nice
huh....interesting
cool pic, Sparkle
Needs more Miku
keep going...
sparkle....is that as bad as what solo came up with earlier?
who else you got, Kerrik?
I've seen grown up chris...grown up miku, now grown up bikki...
adult miku is relevant
Mikuvision 3D, TM
Basa and....Chris. High quality, Kerrik
hit me with....
LOL
bikki don't know how to parent
Dont need to delete your posts
Riding Duel, Acceleration
***Bikki x Rice is one of her otps***
Sparkle has to give you permission...and even then, Pirate Kirika has final say
Needs more dess
Praise be to Nana
was gonna say, Saki, let's take the XDU chat to <#336298054724485131>
oh hey, it FINALLY counted my MLB of my XD Maria
my one problem with most Basa cards...they tend to be single target at times
if I did, I'd find a way to fit her in
...I wish I had more copies of Giga Zeppelin
that's also whre my XD Shirabe comes out to play too, now that I think about it
I'm prob. gona tweak my squad a bit to find a way to fit in my MLB XD Miku
...my Maria should be MLB already, but.nooooooo....stupid glitch
that's where my LB4 XD maria and FM come out to play
eh...my PvP squad is different
and I'm using MLB Biker Basa now
I have my MLB BurnBasa in almost every team regardless of situation...
my PvE team right now has 2 Basas and a Miku
Explains the eye damage, but what about the leg injury?
Huh?
I can ship that
Wait...where would you take that?
...
Dunno
Interesting
?
LOL
Her soul was destroyed in G when she took the effect of Igalima’s zesshou for Shirabe
Bc how would one justify it?
Eh...I have mixed feelinns
then again, people know which Gear I'd go to dinner with hands down, but not the point. GOing to dinner with CHris would be kinda fun
eh...I guesss I'd be up for it...
...she'd bite my hand off if I tried to grab a piece of pizza
so it's a gungnir gauntlet changed based on the Faiz belt...interesting
yep...and parts of it that are Faiz phone-esque things
reminded me of Faiz
yeah, that's what I was thinking
that...looks like Kamen Rider
huh? Bikki and Edge Bikki...with Rider-style henshin belts?
Yeah...havent heard of that one at all
Mikumo x Tsubasa?
Man...Miku sounds like a nympho, hahaha
For some reason, I dont think that’s all theyre saying, haha
Lol
Never...just mind blowing
Goodwork
The collection is impressive
Kerrik...jeez, man
Lol, WarHibikimon
Neither did I
He’s...gonna be.busy. And never finish fully bc new stuff comes out daily
Maria’s Airgetbike
That they dont
?
Interesting
Hmm...Chris with Gungnir, huh...
Chris usig what, though...
Okay, who’s the alt colored gear?
Bikki’d be a shooting guard; more of the scorer
I think she’d be more of a Point Guard
Miku playing at the space jam
Basa going all mortified, haha
very interesting timeline, lily
yep
Lol
New XD Bikki card coming in XDU
Shoujo Basa...jnteresting
Ah...nice
What’s in July?
nice
...woah...
yep
I love Fridays
I think that it was probably a bad joke made after being awake for not even an hour
yep
Kerrik, you see where the joke came from yet?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzWLZu-_GJ8
Kerrik, you ever see the Washio Sumi Chapter of YuYuYu?
but Basa pics would be something he doens't get pinged for
....I was trying to make a joke
let's enjoy...some Basa pics
hey Saki
And Hibiki going all “Miku...we need more gohan...”
Led to a crack discussion about Miku spending all her spending money on the gacha just to collect all the Hibikis
Kerrik...I remember that photo
yay, chanigng nickname
interesting
....I"d wonder how Basa lives like that too
was that a Kanade in Basa gear pic I saw earlier?
The smaller image had me hesitating for a moment
1000% it’s do
It’s do
Right column or left?
LOL, Shirabe making it rain
All Chris needs to do is ask
...please don't tempt...
huh....good job so far
<@279341087494242304>
dunno....looks a bit weird
answer: dunno, you answer that one
This...is one of them
Some gacha games are just designed to be cash grabs
The whole event is crap. The gears are HEAVILY hinted (if not outright shown) to be yuri. Why the FUCK imply otherwise, devs?
Looks that way
Woah
looks like it
b/c nades solve everything
try harder
Which LL is that?
A Basa wannabe
..lol
The mad flatter...
Lol
Huh. Nice finds, lily
Topdad with the Ore, Sanjou
No, Kerrik, it doesnt; I already have 2 that need my focus, plus the upcoming prompts thing Starting today
Airgetlam Bikki...interesting
Least we know it doesnt involve mahjong tables...*yet*
I wonder what Sneki’s secret project is...
good work, Kerrik
damn...
What game?
Sonic 06 is one of the worst games Ive seen in a while
The image spam is why she broke, yo
Kerrik...you overloaded her
impressive
blindfolded Miku w/ longer sweater
okay...THAT is badass
Sorting is suffering...or not
I tend to agree with latooni
Band geahs is cool
SCORE
SUite Precure?
woah
I get pinged, I look

NANA!!!!
Lol
The Ver image...
Kerrik...SHINE!!!!!!
Wouldnt it be like a threesome or something?
True
Lol
...whoever came up with that...is deprived
Huh
I dunno if I even wanna know what game that was or not...
Lol
Lewd
Whoever modded an idol game to Geah it...props to them
LOL
Thanks, Kerrik
That’s the one
Yeah
<@!263983345669505025> , you have the picture of the two Hibikis with the teched out belts?
but, happy 4th to those who are from the US
...not going to get into that discussion...
...solo has an idea now, lol
good show
Use all he spoons, huh
Off day?
25 actually would allow for proper growth and development...so would 18
First time Ive heard it in a while
If still talking Precure, I enjoy Heartcatch, Suite, and DokiDoki, though I apparently need to watch the ones illi suggested
Yep
Nana fanboy here
Yep
Im a Heartcatch nut...illi knows why
All of the KRs pre...Kabuto had pretty dark stuff in them
Any of those are dark af for kids
Kamen Rider may be a kids show...however illi, watch Ryuki, Faiz, Kuuga, Agito
fancy as hell...damn...
What....is that?
Kuromajutsu no veiru is a good card
Oh...I like Vail
Basa knocked it off the wall when Maria pushed her against it
I comment f it's something I'm really interested in, although in your case, <@!173112001684439040> , I just dunno what you're posting b/c I don't recognize most of the characters
same
thanks for the HibiChris fuel
Woah
Kerrik...slow down before you overload Shirabe, lol
dunno if people would want to see that (b/c unfortunately, I'm stuck witht he Leaf character model)
with how close I am to finishing Orange Islands, I could show off her johto journey
although...
I"m seriously tempted to hack in Maria's sprite into the one game I've been playing, lol
-that's what I'm saying, man
SCORE on the gear sprites
Yuri hard or die trying
plus, in terms of fighting style, not sure Bikki would be a Kuuga; she seems more like an Imperer or a Hopper rider from Kabuto
just the head horns give it away
it's IMperer
?
I approve of this
yay, more HibiChris fuel
Yubel's event is live in Duel Links, too
stil, thanks, Kerrik
haven't looked at this section too much lately
<@297542051057238017>
That can be fixed
Damn good song...especially to play Mario Kart to
Uphill
Lol
Maria mad over all the Basa ass shots...
I still need to watch that, btw; thanks for the reminder
Or 3 vs 1 Mario Party minigames
They really are
I like ZS Samus myself...but I play Lucina
Nice find, solo
I have been summoned
Maria in Black, lol
...much as I want the PV...I agree with solo
||sore wa...kami da?||
like....I cna't even deal
I'm bugging so hard right now...
Everything is totally fine
oh damn...who the hell is that who got wrecked?
they're a false front before the bigger bads arrive
this group of antagonists has no reservations about involving civilians at all. It's going to be....relaly interesting
These alchemists are playing to win, and are playing to get the most advantageous spot they can
it wouldn't have for sure
oh yeah
not so sure that they would have used one
but, in the situation as it unfolded?
b/c yeah,t he writers could have asked for one
I"m not even thinking about the writers here; just looking at the situation
b/c I'm confused
okay, explain why you think there would  have been a Kanade-like sacrifice there
Traffic Jams: Still a thing, even in 2045
any architect would look at whoever designed that and throw that person's design in th shredder
yeah...that's just BAD design
b/c the tech they use for them just doesn't exist in most cases
they don't work IRL
they don't
no one expects the alcanoise assault from an alchemist
they designed that sage to look sweet as hell....and it damn sure did
exactly
(well, they're animated characters, but you know what I mean)
yes, but again, we can't just forget that she is human....and as such, she does have those emotional vulnerabilities. I think that how she reacted and how she approached the situation are fine, knowing that. I can't be mad about that
Right, Maxwell
her reaction in that spot isn't rational....but, it IS a more realistictype of reaction given her background
can't expect everyone to always keep their heads in that spot...especially not Basa, with what she'd been through
I'm admittedly curious what they'll do with her in regards to that seal that was placed on her too...
Basa concert ad: "warning, there is a high likelihood of noise attacks at this concert. If so, please do not panic nad leave in an orderly manner'
welcome to the Kanekocoaster, please enjoy your ride
But hell of a way to start the season with these 2 eps
well...I'd been complaining since AXZ that they'd turned Basa into a background character cardboard cutout, or at least it felt like it....looks like we'll be getting more focus on her this season.
depends on where they take her the rest of the season
we'll have to see
you beat me to it, lol
oh yeah
it's there entirely to look sweet as hell
it doesn't
not enough emergency exits, etc
not to mention standard codes in case of emergencies
no argument out of me on that. Looked cool, obviously was an issue
yeah, we do
okay; before we get TOO far into this, we should maybe take the convo to <#357682999300718592>
and Meta answered my question before I could ask it, lol
perhaps a better question is this: which Kamen Rider would you even cross with it?
although
what justifies the crossover, and what crosses over?
okay, then here's the next question
and all of those end up pairing (insert gear character here) with said OC
the problem with them is that 99% of them are HEAVILY OC dependent
...I wouldn't either....
And dont get me started on my dislike of TopDad
...the only villain Id want back isnt even a full villain
Mobile keyboards are fun
Hi Cypher
Fudou is...i cant think of a word for someone like that
Id be cool with just St Germain returning
Im looking forward to it myself; the gut punchea to come will be interesting
And you’re right. armados, as far as I remember
No, she didnt show up
Without criticism, one cant get bettwr or learn from it. And what Voyeur just said applies big time
That she has a possible PTSD is something really interesting; im intrigued to see how rhey handle it
If it was Madoka, they’d all have witched out within an episode
lol, so true; so often a lot of people don't take the time to try to talk it through in reality
Basa thinks a lot...~~when she’s not dealing with traumatic mental flashbacks~~
That’s actually pretty cool
LoL
Yeah, that...is a massive issue there
That whole hall was a damn deathtrap...
Nana still is popular...
However, the heavier guitar prob has something to do with the type of tone they could be searching for
All kidding aside bc im a Nana fan, the song is a bit weaker than past OPs
<has had ‘Metanoia’ on loop all week at work
Least he isnt aiming at HibiMiku
Prob the full Kirika one, too
Waiting is overrated i. This case
That they do
Yeah...G’s plot was...looking back on it, it was BAD
The symphormation section
Aisu kuremu tabetai, lol
Hahahaha...im listening to the new Symphogear Radio....that open...hahaha
Cant forget sparkle
Solo isnt the only one...
Makes that feel like even more of a plow to the stomach
We both were
Low blow, yo
Oof cant even BEGIN to describe ot
~~which gear gets eaten alive by the Mp geahs?~~
~~Miku also wants to own literally every piece of HIbiki-related merch ever produced~~
Yeah...I want to kick Fudou's head in
I did gripe a little aobut this to solo earlier....
he's going full on rogue
noe
just an obliteration before he even notices it
I won't even give him that chance
she's been forced back tot hat
just obliterate and dispose of Fudou Kazanari
Cypher, for that asshole, there's no such thing as overkill
ANyone got a Twin Buster Rifle that can be used on him?
no...punching him isn't good enough
if that means breaking his own daughter/granddaughter and forcing her to revert to being nothing but a weapon, then so be it in his eyes
he'll do whatever the hell he feels necessary to put Japan as the #1 power in the world
he's a fucking Pragmatist
Fudou doens't surprise me
It IS something I can see
but....
and who said she's turning quite yet
....I want to punch Fudou's face in
it will likely become known soon enough, if I had to guess
(J/k, but damn...that would be crazy)
If that happens to Basa, riots
okay, who the hell gave Basa a segway
I know; i got the Metanoia single, the 2 character albums, and a CD by another group all at once within a couple days
I just ordered the character songs from CD Japan; my Chris and Hibiki singles arrived earlier this week
Fudou is so evil, he killed Kenny...for good
That bastard!
Fudou is so evil, he puts coal in every christmas present and stocking
Fudou’s the asshole who brute force steals all yo stuff, not just yo girl, in the name of japan
He wishes he could be Nobunaga
Yeah...he’d be effective as hell. Ruthless, manipulative, doesnt give a damn what the cost is to obtain his goal
<:BasaDesperate:600020200263254016>
Watch him pick index...it happens all the time
Bc I don’t go looking in nsfw very often
...i’d almost forgotten about that...
The thought disgusts me, even if it did give us Basa
And I don’t think they’ve fixed that yet
Bad communication with Bikki
Fudou’s just that much of a bastard
He tried his best to protect her from Fudou...but it still wasn’t enough
I still think there’s gonna be a clash of Fist vs Sword at some point this season...and nothing I’m seeing is changing my mind
LOL
it's a big part of their lives now...and that's really cool to see
makes me glad I ahve the Hibiki Radio app
though it IS super-possessive
sorry, that's just entertaining how she reacted to that
HAHAHAHA
never let her drop from her spot as my personal favorite character
not even reading anything, but that Basa Face is NICE
I always need more Basa
Need more of her transformation
But that would be hilarious
The world is changing, but some people refuse to change with it
Fans hood them to be higher than human to an insane degree there
it's going to be Gear vs Gear at some point most likely....just a question of when, and who she faces
the pTSD, plus what Fudou's doing....is a bad combination
but even then, she's breaking under it
whens he does...you can tell she's struggling with the hypnosis he's laying on her
I think it's inevitable that she does
and it's going to be BRUTAL
prob. in the last few eps
it's gonna be Basa vs one of them at some point
Im inclined to think that it’ll take someone forcibly knocking sense into Basa to reach her again. And the prime characters to do it are Bikki and Maria
Who’s ready for today’s ~~dosage of trauma~~ HYYYYYYYYYPE?
so was I
discuss in fancontent?
Dont you mean....***IWAE***?
give yourselves a chance to breathe
people, breathe
got ya
ah
man....
this episode....
a little speccial?
no one's laughing at you, Dinoboy
I"m talking this version of it
it has a lot to live up to....
Miku vs Bikki hasn't even happened yet
it usually is fairly simple
Go take a few minutes to breathe
please
....Dino, CHILL
so many threads
.....there's still so many directions left for the season to go
that still opens up so many options
she doesn't even have to be killed. Even if they just fail to save her and return her back to normal...
we have to remember that this is the final season as well
it can pull the trigger on a lot of things
Nougat's right, sad to say
as a sort of lead up to the ending
I think it's likely to happen
but...it IS really ironic
Dino, solo didn't ahve anything to do witht hat
Solo....you were lucky that they were
I don't think it did....I think it just gave them a break
I'm still 95% sure that there's going to be a Basa vs one of Bikki/Maria/Chris fight
Oh, we're going to have a Basa fight before then....
I just care that he dies
I don't care how he dies
...I have a particular vision for his death....and it would be GLORIOUS
preferably by Basa's blade
Fudou....I want him to DIE
Maria keeps jobbing somehow
if he does, Riot
that's....highly, highly likely
that's one of them, Dino
there's so many possible outcomes
just like he'll use anyone else he can
Fudou used them as pawns
Noble Red is boned
I don't see anyone permadying (aside from Fudou)
die and revived is possible
that's fair
okay
all options are in play
they don't have to hold ANYTHING back
we gotta remember though; final season
I can see her getting stabbed and beaten by her pretty badly
if that happens, it wouldn't be til episode 12
i'd think it's not likely to be that son, Dino
well, not highly likely, but one that's pretty much guaranteed
another highly likely one is a fight against Fudou
but beyond that...there's still a lot that's left in the air
another  one that I think is likely is Basa vs one of these three: Maria, Chris, or Hibiki
that's one fight that we can be fairly certain will happen (Hibiki vs  Shem-ha Miku)
LOL
....b/c of how it shows that they're now on different sides, and it's bait
^exactly
...Dino, you're overreacting
also, Fudou isn't the Woz.....he's the wannabe Schwarz
I can get hype, but....just not quite able to get to that level atm
<:iwae:595991616842367020>
Time stone/ Why do that when you can just call on ~~*waga maou*~~
....she herself said she died though
just like solo said
Asuka is the definition of suffer porn
Kaneko needs to earn that trust
just no way
there's no way it drags into episode 13
setting Miku free....I could see episode 12
I don't think the Fudou issue is fully resolved until episode 11 toward the end
I still don't think it'll be that soon, DInoboy
....any time Fudou smiles, hundreds die
I think it's likely Fudou
I think there's stuff we don't know yet
...you're overreaching, Dinoboy
exactly what I was about to type
it's like how I consider some of my local friends to be an extended family
that's true
He does remind me of a Heihachi Mishima though, in how power hungry he is
Fudou doesnt deserve to be called her father. However...biologically, the fact remains that he is.
though why they put a tape measure around Bikki is beyond me
that screen of Shirabe and Kirika facing SOMETHING in front of flaming wreckage....shit going down
Fudou's an asshole, but he's anything BUT dumb
It’s fully possible. Can see that happening
Depends on the point of view
Crunchy is a double edged sword
Crunchy spoils so much stuff
SHemha is easily the best villain
lol
Ryuki was really good, but that doesn't make SHinji Kido any less annoying for the majority of the early part of the season
Yeah...was about to say
Agent Smith did that though, Dino. And i have mixed feelings about ot
Whew...nice find, solo
Yeah...he was trying to be more stealth about it the first time. 2nd time he was more dangerous, at least in theory
His threat level was minimal at that point; BDH is right. N had him outpowered
If one thinks about it, they got lucky she did so
...4kids version would be cringe inducing
Crunchy’s been ~~promoting~~ spoiling the show somewhat, which could help, but...not getting my hopes up too high
Won’t get here any faster, sadly
Complaining about it won’t help
got 2
Huh
So...what are these character tokens supposed to mean?
...she has her opinions
Illi, sparkle would get jealous
How the hell...
Scripts and writers sometimes do that to be assholes, I think
have learned a decent amount today alone
in that it's educational
....this convo...is entertaining
Too good
...that song...LOL
^this
Lol
...it does look good when the women do it, but....shes right; not really necessary
Just...why?
Like...why?
Yeah...thats just...
Sounds...painful
...damn
Mind=blown
it's GOOD
Rukia introed me to this show...
Man, <@!337316978098176011> if Im ever in the area, Ill take you up on that
Kinda makes me envious of places in Europe, where it seems like they have an idea of happy employee is a productive one
I havent taken time off for vacation in over a year
And yep, I know whay you mean, Alice
Like...Ive always been a bit slower than my peers in terms of doing things.  I didnt have a real girlfriend until sophomore year at uni, and that went really well for a while.  But then you have others who are in this massive hurry to get married and have kids
I mean...society as a whole seems to place massive expectaions on a all of us.  As such. It feels like we all have certain expectations that we need to meet
Possible
It sure seems like it
And Ive always enjoyed helping people
Even though Im not experiencing it myself, its still cool to meet other people and learn about different things
It really is interesting to talk about this stuff
But in any case, thats fine
Okay, I correct my statement then
Huh...
And its cool
Youre the first person Ive met who’s like that
Thats...interesting
And it still applies; im pretty sure that a good amount of us here are always willing to listen.  I guess in that way, we all have Hibiki’s spirit within us to an extent
What ibu said
Dude...I was on res life staff in uni.  Im always willing to listen and help out.
And if anyone needed to chat about something, Im willing to listen.  Just getting that out there.
Its something Im glad for
Like...on my end, its led me to meet people I wouldnt have otherwise.  And all of them have been really cool people.
Yep
I dont have that...but, I like to think that we all have the fact that we enjoy Symphogear, which led us here.  For some of us, its led us to find that we have sides we didnt think we had.  For others, its something thats allowed us to meet people we wouldnt have otherwise
Lol
Bc man...this discussion is deep
Hmm...remind me to, if I have a life question about anything, bring it up in here
...thats...deep
Yep
Hopefully it goes well for you
Congrats
Eh...the best anime do that though
...man...why do I get the feeling that this show is gonna leave me wondering what just happened?
...whut
This’ll be interesting
Like...I know what I like, but I just cant find it here.  So i think a scenery change is necessary
overly political correctness
I find myself interested in a lot of things....helps keep me grounded, I like to think
good b/c of what Madoka does, not just b/c of the content
GOOD show
Depression is a real thing
Agreed
...woah
I could prob. do a decent job of teaching English; I just have to make the time to refresh my nihongo
...
Ah...no worries
?
LOL
Well, congrats, ibu
Warm outside weather
Man...Id totally fly down to a TX-based con
Oh?
We’re not perfect. We can try to be, but we’re really not
Yep...seems like it...
...just how it goes
Thats true...and good luck in doing so, man
...huh?
Well, idk what else to use atm
LOL
you'll do fine
you're good, man
why?
and it doesn't help that most parents don't actually do their job
I tend to look at it this way; when you look at most media, they tend to encourage that sort of hatred
I try to look at people like that...it's how I was raised
treat them with respect and treat them well
it doesn't matter their gender, race, sexuality, etc
a person is a person
maybe for the person who excludes those who are different...but it only dodges the problem
that...never fixes the issue
yep
Not converting to Dess-ism
LOL
I had the originals...theyre long gone though
Im gonna eventually kitbash a Strike Freedom and a Wing Zero
Still havent
Yep
maybe...but, go into it with an open mind, clear heart, and you'll be fine
hey, good luck with it
ah
how so?
In any case ibu, you’ll figure it out
*?
Okay; did she offer any advice(
To help you figure this out, I mean
Well...isnt that what she referred you to the specialist for?
That could have been...interesting
Okay...
Also misses the root of the issue
Maybe, but that doesnt justify her treating you like that
Sounds like trouble
that's your best option
holy shit
like...
wait, what?
then that's the first step you need to take, man
I think...it would prob. be for the best, man
...sorry to hear that, man...
Yep
sucks, man...
Congrats!
it's...a troublesome situation
The first step in this case is to officially move out. And to do that...he needs to get the rest of it in line
yeah...
plus it's fun to re-discover that I enjoyed playing DDR
yep...I've been going out to Round 1 lately and just meeting people
I try to go out with people at least once a week, and talk to people I don't know
When will you know your Trig grade?
Congrats, R
got plenty of time before r/Symphogear watches K-On
you go ahead, Kerrik
congrats, R
What are they so afraid of?
Its like people are afraid of unting together...it’s stupid
All I know is that at this point, anyone who voted for him clearly doesnt know how to loop at the bigger picture beyond their front porch. And it’s pathetic.
Who knows, and tbh, I dont care to think about it
Enough about that though...wont let it ruin my mood
But it just further solidifies it
I already knew it
Yep
And is proving it
Just isnt qualified to do so
Im convinced even more than I had been that he has no business being president
That’s just...DUMB AF
Yeah
...the longer the current administration is in power, the more im convinced that his goal is to destroy this country’s reputation globally. Just...so stupid.
He’s damn good
Hmm...that’s a start
Well, have you tried to tell her that?
Ah...that’s...never a good thing
What, she was saying that you werent interested in anime?
What you have to understand is that even if you did so subconsciously, what’s done is done. All you can do at this point...is give her space, and then eventually try to rebuild. If you can even save the friendship, thats better than a lot of other people
Dont be
Ah...then you may have done or said something that gave her the wrong impression
Ouch...that’s harsh, man
Ah man...sorry to hear that. I know the feeling though
Government is out of touch with those it represents as far as Im concerned
Liek...people get elected there and turn that into their full on career
Im fully convinced that as long as the most prominent lawmakers in this country are all 65+, this country will forever be stuck in this cycle. Need to place term limits on congress
And that way theres no regrets
Basically take the first step and try
At he minimum you’ll at least have gotten it off your chest
And for the moment, that’s what you say to her
Just control what you can co trol
Man, dont worry about it
But getting back on topic, that’s only the first step
No shame in that
amen, castform
Most officials choose not to do so,
What do you think on it?
?
Uh...dunno
People gonna love that
...wow
Right
Yep
Yep
Ouch...sorry to hear that man
Why?
is it time for alice on drugs?
...ouch
Sorry, man
Yeah; at that point, I think that if they try to manipulate the boundaries, its best to gtfo of the relationship
I dont necessarily think that most people think about getting consent though, at least not in the moment
Like...she started seeing another friend of mine after things ended, then I think just flat cheated on him
Which was...kinda aggravating.
Especially when she then later pulled the same crap with another friend of mine 2 years later
I know myself...it was more painful bc of how she tried to go about it without my knowledge. Though looking back on it, Im kinda glad I learned the lesson that way
Its human nature
Yeah
Learned that the hard way
Yep
I know with mine, she tried to hide it too, first with the polyamory excuse, then by saying “I didnt want to hurt you”
That’s just dumb
Interesting
That...didnt end well
And with a friend of mine as well
I was in a monogamous one for 3, and then she started seeing her ex on the side
Ouch...and yeah, Saki
And it sucked
Actually had the latter
Sounds like the average political debate now too, Yorin
Right
Smart plan
It’s all about that communication
Yep
Has to be established from the start
Right
Yeah
But I can see why
Wasnt the case in my ex’s case
Fair point, Yonde
Right
Eh...dunno about that
And tbh, I agree
Right
Yeah...and I thought my 3 year one was rough. Sorry to hear about that, man
Why’s that?
That’ll help?
Well, youre going to the fair this weekend
alright....when it's ready, I kinda wanna take a loook at it and see how it looks
what are you writing now?
Go for it, Alice
Huh...wonder if I have that; I know my mom has faced it for  years
Im planning on being there for Kon
That serves MASSIVE portions
being hung up on someone you can't have
...it's a tough spot though, at least at times
okay, ejecting form this convo now...mainly b/c I have to get ready for father's day stuff
that is a good phrase
the wealth isn't as easy
the credit score you can build
but that's something you can develop
that you do need
if it's a unique idea and one that fits the market and target audience, you'll ahve a better shot
sometimes you need to get into the right market and know what it is you're tyring to achieve
hmm...not entirely
hell yeah they do
now do they abuse the crap out of the system?
once they're there however, it may look easy, but it's not
they played the corporate game
they made mistakes, losts of them, and learned from them
a lot of them had to climb their way up
keep this in mind
never said that they're not working
I don't think they have it that easy
however...
that's the business model
YOu have a pair of total failures for administrations in office right now
and hte funny thing is that it's because of how there's a massive backlash to previous regimes
actually was going 100 while driving to go on vacation a couple weeks ago
Good luck, man
Get better info and more fun stuff here by a mile
Its really not worth the time
Agreed.
Langou, stop talking. you're not helping yourself.
you're Setsuna F Seiei?
so, sorry ofr a stupid decision of replying to a joke that was clearly transphobic, which I didn't realize was the case til afterwards
I look at everyone here as good poeple. Just making that known
okay, made a stupid reply to Langou's joke earlier. Was a stupid decision on my end, and I'll own up to it. Apologies for that
...then there's me, who spent all last week out cold at an early hour
There’s a reason I dont look at Valk though. Just...some things arent condonable
True
Okay, yeah...tempted to leave Valk on principal right now
At least the ball’s in her court
Good
what the hell...
Some of them wear yoga pants during the winter...and summer...
But man...like half he women I know in my area go to starbucks. Plus the one in my local Barnes & Noble makes decent smoothies
Lol, same here, ibu
I know more people than I care to admit
Tell that to most of the women I know
do what you gotta do
no worries man
<:SakiShock:455848986738425886>
that's...funny how that can happen sometimes
...well...
Hmm...wonder if we’re seeing a shift in the global political power structure. Had one of the rare calm political convos with my father the other day after reading about what’s taking place in Germany; hes of the view that there’s a backlash against the idea of mass globalization going on, at least in terms of things like immigration, as well as when it comes to a concept like the EU and the UN taking bigger roles.
If you’re going to make the change, then it NEEDS to be all at once. Otherwise, as we’re saying, it just hurts people
I agree: when you look at what the rest of the world has been doing, what Obama was pushing for was, tbh, kinda tame
Not just that, but looking at the US situation, there’s also a feeling that a lot of those have on the right wing that the last president’s policies were pushing things too far in the direction of a more progressive and liberal based society, and were doing so too quickly. And as such, this current regime, which is radically in the opposite direction
Right; see why there’s a pushback?
Right. But tell that to the people who work in those industries as they’re faded out.
When you look at it, there’s still a lot of people who want things to be likw thwy were before we all became connected by the internet. Prime example of this is the coal industry here. That industry is, quite frankly, dying. But the people who work in it either don’t want to learn the skills needed to adjust to today’s world, or are never offered that opportunity. In most cases, it’s a mix.
The world is always changing. You either change with it or you fall behind, at least that’s how it should be looked at.
And ibu, Im already seeing a lot of people wanting him and his party out of power asap. Problem is that you have a good number of people who are, again, in those older generations that are in power and feel like the world is changing too quickly, and they dont like that that’s the case.
Well...when you think about it, that’s what a lot of it is rooted in. A lot of people in the older generations either dont understand how he world has changed or refuse to adapt. And unfortunately, its people of those generations that are in power atm
Look for example at the education system here as an example. When you look at the way it’s done, its primarily privately funded on the College/University level. While you do have those that are state-funded, you then need to look at the cost of college as compared to other options. I know where I went, I think its up close to $37k per year. Part of the reason for those costs is the sheer facilities race, as well as the faculty salaries. Whereas you look at higher ed in other nations...I think you guys have said that in a decent chunk, the government pays for higher ed, while at the same time offering the option to go into trade school instead if a person chooses, correct?
Well then here’s the question for you. Why arent those people who are supposedly unable to do anything not given the chance to look into something like a trade school or something similar?
Just gonna say this really quickly: I think that part of the issue with such a low turnout is that there really, truly was not a good option this past election, at least when you look at it from an overhead view.
Sounds like it
But those other countries also have a bit more of an emphasis on preparing students for life in general as opposed to here, where a lot of time it’s about teaching to a test, and not really preparing the students for life.
If I remember right, a decent number of other countries offer that option to look in another direction
That’s a true statement. And tbh, Im not sure that needs to be the case. If you look at it, those roles that can be filled by something like a trade school have an important place in society. To me, I get why people are always pushing for kids to go to college/uni. But why shouldn’t those who don’t necessarily want to go that route be given the option to find another route, one that they may find more enjoyable?
Right
<@!99695384296701952> no, at least I dont believe that to be the case. Life in and of itself is a very valuable thing. What Im asking though is why the option isnt given for people to find something that they’re truly passionate about. If you think about it, there’s really very little reason for people to not be able to have a basic income.
Understandable
nice
I lift weights, do core work, and add in cardio togo with it
gotta build up to it
yep
just don't overdo it if you haven't done it in a while
Saaki speedrunning this...setting that world record time
People use their anonymity as a weapon
Fun
Ouch
But I had to do an extra semester, lol
It does
I had an entire semester of them once bc the classes I needed werent offered until the next semester
Pretty much
Things that you dont need to take to fulfil the requirements of the major/minor you have
Non-required courses
It sucked
I had a semester where I had nothing but electives for classes bc of how the needed classes werent offered
I know, Kerrik
Those who went to uni, yeah
Yeah...it made me more than a little annoyed
That feeling when you need a particular class in order to enroll in another one, but woke up too late to get into it so you have to wait a semester
Exactly
That’s how it went for me in uni: the race to enroll for classes was always *fun*
I...totally lost the convo from the start
Yeah...moving fluidly between tasks
*totally*
Why, bc you get people to think outside the little box?
?
Im hyped for Sen IV
All really good games
...I don't think that's how it works, Ten
...I wonder why we're so upset
*this
...Kerrik, just b/c we don't have a massive railway system, doens't mean we don't have an infrastructure. It's jsut a different type of infrastructure
Not even gonna partake in a guessing game
Lol
well, that was a read
I think that a lot of us here view you as a really cool person, and that you're one of the more perceptive people on here
WFC, gonna be real with you here. If you killed yourself, there would be more poeple who would be saddened by it than you know.
But keep your head up
Wish I knew how to really help with that atm
...damn...
just...
yeah
or should I say the govenrmnet to realize it
but you've GOT to put down MUCH harsher restrictions
not saying people can't have them
what the hell will it take for people to realize that the gun control laws in this country are WAY too lax
https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheLandingMassShooting?src=hash
Jacksonville Police is in the area and it's on lockdown
the area is on lockdown
no idea
https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1033782205443661824
warnign: disturbing
just...damn
for osmeone to go to a tournament and shoot the place up, with 4 confirmed deaths to this point nad at least 6 other victims...
it's a damn video game
ALL of them are flat shaken like hell
I follow like...8 people who play competitively on Twitter
I know
I can only imagine how the people at that event have to have felt at the time
then people are really stupid af
...if he did it for the stupid reason I"m seeing on there...
those are 2 of the ones who were killed
https://twitter.com/spotmeplzzz
https://twitter.com/True__818
they don't deservet hat type of attention
whoever it was...
nope
2 of those who were killed are ID'ed...2 of the bigger names in the scene, too
exactly right, Ox
Creates a serial lack of respect for others
that now people don't ahve to take responsibility for any of the shit they say, and feel able to do whatever they want
the problem is...
no
maybe late 90s/early-mid 2000s
so....
to be honest, I'd say before Social Media
...
🤷
it sickens me what this country's government and society has become
keep in mind, I'm from here, Kerrik. And lately, I find myself more often than not agreeing with you
but, can't count on anyone in the government right now to do that
well sometimes you have to say "fuck the career risks" and do what's right
you have to put people in place in government who are WILLING to change gun control laws
however, before ANY of that...
you'd still have that black market to deal with however
and I do agree with latooni that Auralia's gun control laws are a good example to shoot for
the main isue is what do you do with the existing weapons already out there legally? I think part of the answer is that they need to get re-registered
hmm...
but, you CAN make it MUCH harder to even get the weapon
I odn't think you can take all the weapns away
...sounds like it. And dang...that was a lengthy story to read. Still, congrats on the progress you’re making
You’ll be fine, Kerrik
However...the real question is this: which governments have the guts to look industry in the face and make it mandatory that the cuts take place? And even if that happens...how many governments would stay in place long enough to make sure that it comes to pass?
Okay...I agree that there needs to be a massive overhaul of how governments look at emissions, and that they need to be cut to almost nothing
Anyways...dropping the convo before I drive myself nuts over it
Thanks for the reminder; fixed my wording
HAVE THEY NOT READ THE MANIPULATIVE TAX PLAN THE GOP PUSHED THROUGH THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A MIDDLE FINGER TO LOWER AND MIDDLE CLASS CITIZENS STARTING NEXT YEAR?
Are they that dumb?
...hahahahahahahahahahaha
Especially with a GOP leaning Supreme Court
We’ll see how that goes
The best option, Scrmz, is that the Dems win as many seats as they can this midterm election
But, good luck convincing the deep south about that
Yeah...GOP should be removed as quickly as possible
It put the State Department in a tough spot
Especially with reports like that coming out
They’re idiotic for thinking that
The GOP continues to insist that global warming isnt real
Not too much else that comes to mind atm, unless hydroelectric counts
Wind, solar...
Agreed; part of the reason the Orangutang is in office is bc of backlash against the policies (smart ones) put through by Obama that would have started toward the needed shift. And lo and behold, all the regulations that he put in? Already repealed
Look at the coal industry for example: theyre already saying that just adopting harsher carbon regulations should help. Truth is, the coal industry needs to be essentially shut down entirely (needs to be less than 1% of world power output or something like that if I read that right)
With that said, I dont like that its that way; should be able to state that these are facts and that we NEED to do something NOW, and then implement the needed changes. But...again, even if you implement the needed policies and are willing to suffer short term economically, whos to say that voters and businesses wont revolt come election season?
Bc that’s more sellable to the voting base and to businesses
Right; more likely to have a gradual change in that than you are a drastic and immediate one
Arizona State?
Yeah. It’s sad for the families of those killed...god, the whole situation just sucks
Doesnt make it less disturbing; Im only just now catching up on the story, so there’s details Im missing
Okay...then whoever it was had an axe to grind
Agreed. It was clearly planned...Im guessing. Could even be an employee there possibly. No clue. In any case, it’s sickening to hear about.
...whoever did this will get the death penalty. No way they wont
Tell all of this to the NRA....assholes are trying to spew pro-gun rhetoric off of this shit, just like every other time
Tells me how out of touch DC is sometimes
sadly, it seems to be working perfectly
this current administration is just capitalizing on that fact to drive a wedgeinto this country, dividing its people
oh, it exists....it always has. It's just been buried under the surface and never properly dealt with
especially givent he current 'administration''s policies on things
their hesitation is understandable
right
~~gotta get those NRA dollars yo~~
the government refuses to do anything to stop the gun violence, so....it's no surprise at all
I'm not surprised
that's the one I"m playing
the PS4 one is called Everybody's Golf
and the rest of the world too, now that I think about it
it's the entire western name
nope
?
Sen no Kiseki 3, Everybody's Golf, and Tekken 7
...right now...I'm kinda working on...
Trophy Hunter forever
Amen, man
Ah...I tend to lean JRPGs, Fighters, Racing Games, and the occasional SPorts game
LOL
...I watch Anime, write, work out, play vidoe games...
...totally forgot that, plus EVERYONE knows Nanoha
SYmphogear, Yuru Yuri, Sakura Trick....dunno what else
I'll stick to the yuri...
looks fairly good so far
that's why I said the equivalent of one
...just need the equivalen tof a MOnika to show up
totally just watched episode 12 of Toji no Miko...didn't realize that it was a 24 episode series
for YDKJ
I have the jackbox party pack myself
where would jackbox even be played on? PC, PS4, XBox?
okay...hmmm...I can come on Saturdays, pretty much all the time
I think it’ll be interesting to see; just need to figure out when to watch it
Ibu Im 5 hours behind you
So it’s 6
EST is GMT -5
6 pm est if on East Coast...
So like...6 pm EST
t-minus 209 minutes
same
I can make it Saturday
get your popcorn ready cuz it's gonna be a show
yep
53 minutes to go...get your popcorn ready
osu is just the chosen method today
plenty of ways to kill time
I can
AMQ...plenty of ways
it's for them to play it before K-on starts
10 minute warning....
that's opposite of a marathon though...
15 minute warning
I'm good to go...
it's my dad's Birthday, and idk what's for dinner for that
me, I'm...not sure what I'll be having yet
ibu, sending thing to advise that here
okay...
lol
...I'm an american, and I'm right here reading
yep
4 hours and 47 minutes
a little under 5
okay...that's for next week, correct?
also, room is up for K-on watch
This for the last of season 1?
cavalry...Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry?
Who’s ready for awesomeness?
Dunno, ibu
Which means?
Bad news?
Ouch
eh...I kinda find myself agreeing
This ep...was really good
was really good
Just watched the new ep of TnM...
Yep; mobile app
Can I rabbit while on mobile...let’s find out
But...having seen it already, will be different benefits...oh well, why not
Sounds like fun
Dude...we’re a bit different from the rest of the world like that I guess?
Meguca is...interesting, but I think YuYuYu did its job better
I just didn't think it was needed
I liked it
I just think Rebellion was unneeded
it was only made b/c $$$$$
b/c to me, Rebellion was unnecessary
I'm not counting Rebellion in that
if you're looking for more of a straight up deconstruction though, that's what Madoka does well
if you're looking for a more uplifting ending, then yeah, YuYuYu hits that perfectly
however, I think it depends on what you're looking for in an ending
it almost got outdone by YuYuYu
I think Madoka, for as good as it was...
huh...got it set up already, ibu

you ever get this while setting up rabb.it?
hey, <@284390402210136064>
as in we the people
...thought it was for all the ons we're watching
what else?
I know we have a possible GuP watch....
I'm ready to rock whenever is good for everyone else
a parody of herself?
yeah...it really is amazing
you'll enjoy it, Alice
Shirobako is SO good
by like...months
yeah...it's one of the rare cases where the dub comes out before the sub
seen the movie, have it on blu ray and with me
added Shirobako to the list
GuP watch when? And how would you fit in the “The Real Anzio Battle” ova?
Ill be available for Saturday
Just was an unusual spot last week
Yeah; I should be good for it this week
Was on road; forgotto mention it with the chaos of that
So what’s next, did the K-On s2 wath atart?
How is your moemon run going, Alice?
Idk
What are they about, <@138131889142628352> ? Base cast summaries if possible?
I think I will
<@138131889142628352> no clue; sorry for slow reply, but been driving last few hours
think it's K-On!!, but idk what episode
Saturdays at noon est? Cool stuff. Sounds good to me
Im ready for the GuP watch
think it's supposed to start this Saturday at noon est
be in in like...15 minutes
I'll be in a little bit late, but I'll be in for sure
Idk what is...
Yeah, 12 noon est
Or Saturday at the equivalent of midnight for Joe when converted to est
And think it was Saturday at noon
Id be good to watch GuP right now
Still gonna be fun though
That we will
Depends on the people watching and how long people want to go, I think
Good point
Rhat better, ibu?
True


need more Hana in my life
Define good
watching something
be in in a bit
same
so...was Hanebado a manga before becoming an anime?
but out of the summer sports shows...Hanebado prob. easily the most visually impressive
I really enjoyed Harukana Receive; was kinda interesting
cast, you se the ep of Harukana Receive yet?
Think Ill stick to just 4
so I do have 4 shows to watch this season
shoujo kageki revue starlight is also pretty good too...
And LOL, that is the most...entertaining line, lol
I like Hanebado, Harukana Receive...been meaning to watch Asobi Asobase as well
Yeah; it looks interesting
Happy Sugar Life?
but, I just prefer other seasons
idk what it is specifically
I just preger OOO over it
I watched it as it aired, and it was okay
FOurze....well...
as much as I enjoy talking Kamen Rider, I'm gonna get to sleep
just...ugh
WHy couldn't she do anythin in a GOOD KR series?
why woudl she voice in a BAD KR?
...
what?
wait...Aoi was in Ghost?
...Ghost is the worst Kamen Rider series of Heisei/Neo-Heisei. ANd it's NOT close
like...the first...5-10 episodes were a little bit confusing, but after that I really enjoyed Ex-Aid
Ex-Aid picks up the 2nd half of it, at least I think
and the fact that it came after 2 REALLY good seasons in Gaim and Drive...just embarrassing
GHost is the dumpster fire of Kamen Rider
I hate Wizard's plot though
but....they had GOOD music
I thought both shows were okay, especially Fourze
Fourze and Wizard are similar in that just b/c I like the music from them doesn't mean that I necessarily love the show
I had some fun with it, but  it didn't stand out all that much
Kiva was...weird
Faiz just...didn't do it for me, for some reason
I still have to watch Kamen Rider Hibiki
I liked Blade a lot...too bad the ending wasn't satisfactory b/c of stupidity on the character's part
amen
Amen, man
Den-O was good comedically...and Hana (before she got shrunk to a kid) was <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I had noticed something off with Decade, but I dind't know what until recently when I heard there was production BS
same with Agito
so I couldn't finish it
Kuuga I had pacing issues
I havne't watched Kuuga completely yet, but I've had pacing issues
Ryuki was good too
some of those are just on there just b/c of the sheer hilarity I got out of them (looking at Kabuto for that)
Still gotta finish watching Drive, but from what I've seen so far, it's on there
Blade, Kabuto, Den-O, Decade, W, OOO, Gaim, Ex-Aid, Build
(chronological order of original air date)
but...these were my favorites
not gonna rank them
let me list off the ones I enjoyed
okay...good selection
Didnt miss an ep this week
Zolg got it
Final ep of Harukana came out a couple hours ago; really good show
Meme so hard you’re never gonna stop it
But in the ALternate Universes, its always seeming like the growth cycle
In real robot, it was primarily the former in UC Gundam
*war
Easier to focus, in a war story, on the exploits of the key players of the wat
Hmm...id say good writing
Its why you see generic unit after generic unit get mowed down
yeah, I like her
ah...
that's not Akane....I just can't remember her name
which one's the black-haired girl?
I like it
Maybe, but Rikka...she’s cool
What that person did is flat disgusting
but damn, some of those moments were hilatious
there's a reason that if I watch the original DM, I do it in the subbed format
it's too bad I can't find a Wing Zero custom kit anywhere right now...
I have a Star Build Strike HG Gunpla that I need to build at some point...I might mash it with one of the Strike Freedom kits I have
the problem is that Build Fighters Tri and Build Divers have....not been great
if you just watch it for what it is (it's really a sports show), then it's more enjoyable as one
rewatching s1 of that....it's really better than some give it credit for
Odessa....wasn't that the Jaburo op?
<@279341087494242304> Asuka was....this past winter I believe. Would that even count as Yandere anime though?
great find, Cypher
ooh...nice
https://youtu.be/J9H3tRtvJZ4
sounds...fitting
a rave w/ Waikyou Shenshoujing
okay
Nice work
It’s...a miracle
*shit
Holy shir
Wait, she’s releasing something new?
so wait...what's happening?
It is, I agree
Wish this song’s full would come out soon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDPAnd8TKYE
I know I put a like...300+ song on shuffle and listen to it as I go through the day
I enjoyed Unleashed
Generations was fun
I still go back to that game from time to time b/c it ws the last truly really good 3d sonic game
still are kick ass
no more music, illi; should be fine
I was still listing off the 3d sonic games
it was....bad
we don't speak about Sonic 06
yeah...those stages were agravating
Pretty sure we all remember it
I’ve been listening to “Blurry” on loop, but that’s bc I was on am Ace Combat kick most of the week
just like the rest of that show
Inner Universe....SO good
Lament is amazing...
...don't do what I did...my first JRPG was actually FFX
^this
my sole advice is to stay away from any Falcom game
If you're looking for a JRPG to jump into that isn't too long...
I'm currently playing Sen no Kiseki III on PS4; it's a LONG game
I actually enjoy playing the Legend of Heroes: Trails of (insert blank)
nope...just didn't care for Neplun ker
Lol, r
My mind=blown
...what the hell...
Plus make them pay the transfer fees, etc
Fair enough...or go bigger.  Want half its value in bank
I agree with Rukia’s idea
those mechanics are...weird
Yeah....
doubtful
that was...not the smartest decision I've made
Like...that loop and the bus station trick made so many of the longer chases so easy
Yeah...they rarely get that lucky, but its nice to be able to just sit there while they try and fail to get there
Same; thats why the bus station trick was so fun
Same
Or use a cheap way of hiding from them and sit on top of the bus station where they cant reach
Eventually drag them to a particular loop around town and just keeptrack of things
That was fun
Yep
Ise it to annoy the cops
Yeah; that was my pursuit run car
Ah...the Mitsu
Hmm...which one was Earl’s again?
Felt too much like it was trying to be something it wasnt
Just didnt feel likw NFS
I had the same feeling
Yeah; I hate the newer games
Carbon had tighter turns a lot, so the added handling the Tuners offered came in handy
I remember Carbon I was always Tuner focused, too
Yeah; the Murcielago was the final one I used up until the last chase
And wasnt there a Mercielago in Most Wanted 05?
And I always would soft reset if I failed to win the blacklist member’s version
I wanna say the Gallardo?
In MW05, Id always go the Chevy first->Carrera->Supra->I wanna say another really good tuner type
Id so enjoy playing through a redo of any of them
Underground 2 >Most Wanted 2005> Carbon imo
The 2005 one, yeah
...wish theyd remaster NFS Underground 2
one moment and I can answer
I'm looking more forwards to the Xenoverse 2 new DLC
not how it works at all
sounds like Whose Line, where everything's made up and the points didn't matter
ouch
...havent cared for the Naruto games in a while
How bad was it?
I still wish theyd remaster Underground 2
Your call
Bc I need more children’s card games
...yeah, Alice is right...Deck Slots...
...no, not really
Makes me glad I have my Japanese PSN
*has JP PSN*
Made for easy destruction
And it respawned so quickly at times
Yep
Why not? Though...
Man...would totally be willing to set up a community on PS4 for the discord, unless there already is one
...damn
But damn...bunch of good competitive shooters right now
Or whatver
Fortnite I was thinking about
But, is it the other Big shooting game atm?
...overwatch is huge
but anyways...if I get SGSS, I"m using that
man...I made a Basa in Xenoverse 2...but, she doens't fit too well; prob. should have made a Hibiki
comes with the ability to use SSGSS as your character
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKtCcoRZg
<@98541382393688064> Take a look
will do, Doxe
Just...why
...why
But wouldnt a downgrade just make it worse?
Hmm...
I see
Ah
...yep...who you got?
Yeah, old wiring is a problem
And yeah...that’s...a lot of time
...nice
Fair
Same
Got here for discussion
Then again...may not be needed
...why not? Let’s roll with it and give it a shot
I dont think its doable without a game to attach it to
I think after I got P5, I spent...almost every chance I could to play it when I wasnt writing?
Almost reminds me of how I was with P5 when it came out
Damn good game though
Hes getting consumed by it, haha
17 days before Basa BDay
5/8
I...actually don't have anything that high on my list atm
Man....I played through P5...was awesome
VERY nice
dont already....
I need to finish Sen 3 completely still...
hmm...
LOL
unless I use my JPN PSN
just....easier
mine's the same as on here
huh...
<@98541382393688064> What's yours?
sent <@200927407736094721>
as good as it is...idk if I have the free space on there to get it...
...
Pretty sure its a new Smash 4
Possible
but outside of Smash...not much I found interesting
I saw it
...lame direct was lame
I had a period of several months where I was playing PSO2 on a daily basis
I have too many things to work through
Berseria’s good; need to finish that
Jin Kazama
I main Jin
Ill be DLing Noctis to Tekken 7
Huh...interesting
Ouch
Fun
Ah
?
Just wanted to hear thoughts on it; looking into getting 5 and 6
Like...I heard Yakuza 5 almost was like their version of San Andreas with how big of space it allowed one to explore
Oh?
Just that they’re really really good, story driven games
Ive heard fun things about them, thats why I asked
Right
Anyone play the Yakuza games? Thinking of looking into Yakuza 5 and 6
weird naming stuff
...yeah
lol
Hell...might as well make a google spreadsheet for those who wanna share theirs if they want
mine is my discord name
right
mine is...actually pretty obv
huh...cool
right
do I even want to know yours, WFC?
sent
one sec, man; will send in a moment
sent
got a PSN, <@188714906143424513> ?
go for it; my PSN is the same as my discord, so I'm not hard to find
PS4
Gonna DL when I get home
At work
Not yet
Smash bc friends talk about it too much, Tekken bc I actually like to play it
Man...makes me glad Ill only pay attention to the Tekken and Smash tourneys
Hes been in Tekken since Tekken 3
2D fighter, right?
What game are we talking about here? Obv a 2d Fighter
Took the words out of my mouth, Shinku
Mine is heavily NFS based
How does t compare to stuff like NFS Underground 2?
...you guys are tempting me to get that game...
damn, this PSO2 update is LARGE
...that's jsut...dumb
I know one game that I don't get rusty at, haha
I actually still have to work on getting a few more moves mastered; but before I can do any of that, I have to get myself back up to par
I hadn't touched it in...months
yeah...I'm trying to re-adjust myself to play the game better
right...almost seems like they forced Tanukana into learning other characters
I guess something changed about her that makes me suck at playing as her now
they really nerfed her BAD between 6 and 7
but my Asuka kinda sucks now
I tried to do an Asuka customization for Bikki
huh...nice
you play Xiao?
yeah...Xiaoyu crouching under that is...kinda bad
Not much of that bugs methough
What arcade exclusive stuff?
Jin doesnt feel quite as slow in 7 as he does in 6
Like?
Sounds like it...get anything else?
Like...I main Jin, and I was doing fairly well after getting my teeth kicked in a few times
I played for 2 hours,, and de rusting took all of it
I was getting wrecked by 11th kyu opponents (or whatever the rank is where I have the Vanguard title)
I was SO rusty
Sent out PSN requests to those who listed theirs...but man...played Tekken for the first time in a couple months last night
I had a couple friends who enjoyed it try to get me to watch it...never did
neveer was a MLP fan...I know a pair of them though
not giving out my initials on here, but it was the last vestige of an old user name
lol, no
It's....the last vestige of an old username
that...was stupid
I just saw a Noctis at 13 Dan
man...
FUCKING TREASURE MATCH GIVING ME AKUMA ON THE THIRD MATCH
I don't like the current ones
they haven't up until now
http://tekken.wikia.com/wiki/Jin_Kazama/Gallery?file=Jin_Kazama_-_Full-body_CG_Art_Image_-_Tekken_6.png
and ekken 6
and her'es Tekken 7
that's the T4 and 5 ones
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tekken/images/2/24/Jin_Kazama.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170825232846&path-prefix=en
yeah; different design, more reminiscent of his Tekken 3 ones
plus I prefer the Tekken 4 and 5 gauntlet things to the current ones
white and black
I like the colors better
eh....I just always remake the Tekken 4 and 5 Jin outfits b/c I think those are the best ones before I start making characters
eh...close
oh?
Nice
lol
THAT part annoys me
PSN sale
I have the “Now It’s Personal” song playing right now
Lol...thats awesome
Heihachi just feels WAY too slow
Yeah...I enjoy Tekken though
Im primarily Jin, though I can also play Kazuya and the occasional Asuka
*shrugs* ill keep playing Tekken, but it does look interesting
Interesting
So bullet hell mixed with 2d fighter
Huh...interesting

<@188714906143424513>
h/o a moment, and I'll get you a photo of my character on there
but man...it's always good to find more poeple who play
I"m on Ship 2 myself...
no worries
nice
what ship?
*waves hand*
COmputer Search was so good when I played the TCG
eh...I play the occasional sports game
like...it's a mess on PSNProfiles
the manager of my local GameStop literally says that I have the most unique choice in games that she's seen
if anyone looked at my PSN Trophies profile, they'd notice that I have too many difrerent genres
eh...it's funny
but, I know that I have Sen no Kiseki III 2nd playthrought o finish, among other stuff
I...don't really knwo the full list all that well
yeah, that's a good thing
it's a list of LONG JRPGs
hahahahaha
...my backlog?
...ouch
I bought the season pass and the collector's edition
but, that's my opinion
I think T7 is the better overall fighter in terms of mechanics
just...doesn't have the speed
...that's hwy I said Heihachi was slow as hell
the story isn't as good as Tekken 6
Man...isnt that like a Mugen screen?
Waiting isfun
Listen to music
Lol
Fairly obv who my character is, haha
Only gear-related Firefox theme I could find
Lotus Juice does good work
I liked the whole song of “Im a Fighter”
True
I really liked Tekken 6’s story mode
Tekken 7’s? Sucked
At least it has a story mode
Yep
have it digitally on my PS4, but haven't installed it atm
...ran into a Noctis in treasure battle...guy is a pain at times
no clue
LMAO
LOL
I've heard some...bad things about that one
ah, okay
what's the top right one again?
P5 is amazing...DOom's really good...Nier is amazing too...Horizon as well
....RIP you?
I know I talked aboit a couple things I got on the PSN sale, but thats it
I dont remember posting anything like that
I did? When?
what game?
hmm?
There you go
how so?
...oh god...
What do you mean by the “real” fanatics?
?
I should get counseling for that one
Yep...
Am I really all that Fanatical though?
I was the one who couldnt shake the similarities between Laura and Basa
It was me, Kerrik
data Roxas is gonna be a fun one
nice
Huh...was able to tell that I subbed?
And nice, MB
I have both versions; theyre both really good
I like the PlanitV mix the best of the remixes
https://youtu.be/2Bd6oUKw2U4
Yep
SpinRiku?
Im looking forward to it myself
?
Doubtful
You have to realize that FFXV was in dev hell until like 2 years beforerelease
But that game made me want the Kondocoaster to stop
And damn, was Sen no Kiseki III a good game
Falcom, imo, does an infinitely better job of world building than SE right now
That falls on the production staff
Not every character needs an episode
Thats the downside of the advent of DLC and digital DLs
Most companies dont releSe a finished product anymore
Dunno
Hate to say it, but thats how most games are. They dont release the fully finished product at first
How so?
Possibly
Would love to know what you call a dead game for the SE part
HELL YEAH
And it’s TOTALLY worth playing
2014 for Us version
Like...Sen Iv comes out in September likely
I also have a second playthrough of Sen 3 to finish...
I still have to finish Super Heroine Chronicle...i might as well restart from 0 on that
Its in production and will likely have more info at e3
That guy is annoying
But man...
I like the concept
FUCK that fight
One name: Terra’s armor
Hence why I said Character cameos
Well...if you think about it, its always been more about the Disney worlds w SE character cameos
Just so that you dont ruin everything for yourself
Eh...I wouldnt
No one knows it
Nope
Still Disney though
I have PC and Vita of both of those
There’s a reason I chose her as the in game best girl
Yep
...this is where I admit that I couldnt help but compare a character in Cold Steel to her
Yep
Like...insanely thirsty
Sen 3 I was at close to 56 hours on my first playthrough...when I finished the 2nd big part
Like...my first playthrough of Cold Steel 1!was 80ish
...you get HUNDREDS of hours out of Falcom games
And I have...5 of the passes worth
They released like 8 season passes worth of DLC costumes
I think I got like 4 of the season passes?
I tried to keep up w DOA5 LR DLC...I gave up on dojng so
...
Ive been able to avoid a lot of needless stuff
Start with the shortest one, then go from there
Ouch
...not hard enough. Go big or go home
Yep
yay...deicide complete
(PSO2 has a false god named Deus Esca. Time to kill the false god.)
almost time for "Deicide...in deicide...oooh..."
And routinely beat them fairly badly
I run a Madden Franchise mode with friends...
Madden on that thing is entertaining
I actuallygot it for...maybe 600ish? And oh hell yeah; Tekken, all my PS4 stuff
May have been closer to summer though
1080; i got it last year in i wanna say...april?
...yeah...my old TV broke, so I splurged for an upgrade
...like 48 inch flatscreen big?
Looks nice
It’s...WAY too bug
I cant prop mine up like that
Decent sized screen for one’s bedroom
He already did the Roxas fight?
Hey, get the W. Thats what matters
Who, Marluxia?
Yep
Itypically have good service with CDJapan, at least when it comes to CDs
Im gonna use cdJapan for my Yuka Iguchi CD and for other gear merch
I actually took the free shipping route
Plus it prob includes import fees
Thats US
Merry christmas, ibu

Yuri Leventhal is a beast
...and I just ordered Dream Tank Battle...
managed to get to 15Dan...or, as it's called in game..."Usurper"
was at 11 an hour or so ago
up to 14Dan with Jin right now...
then go to sleep
Ding, round 1
home now...
okay....
Why? Just...why?
Yep
Bc nothing gear related ever came out for 3DS
...yep
Impressive
Wait...you uploaded it and got it DLed?
<:TsubasaExcited:409481619842400257>
Okay...that...is impressive
TELL US
Totally
and promotion to 16dan
I'm nowhere near asleep

...lol
just...don't let her neat a washing machine
same
time constraint
a bit
congrats
Roll to bribe Maria with a fully paid date with Basa
They dont know the paycho killer that had been released
None of them know
And if its a dude, she castrated them first
Probable death by ShenShouJing
Start running from Yandere Miku who thinks youre threatening her Hibiki collection
Makes me glad I have that whole list...good luck beating ANY of the wielders as bosses
It is
Dont think it would work that way
Suffering?
Im 100% ready and willing to play
Solo’s seen the Basa I made in PSO2 that I now need to find a new haircut for
But youre right; shouldnt need more than d6
Or rolling to see if people survive an attack when writing a mass crossover, like one CSS Stravag’s done
Heard of that myself
They rarely ever use anythjng larger than a D6
So it sounds somewhat similar to some of what Ive seen on HyperRPG’s channel from time to time then
yep...GuP Dream Tank Match is FUN
I'm enjoying it so far
it is
the tanks drive about how one would expect
this game is fun at the moment
10 minutes away from this update to Dream Tank Match being DLed...
just don't go all fangasm
if it's just a one convo thing, fine
if it leads to being friends, fine
just try to talk with them and be civil
I think the most I'd do is the same way I'd approach the VAs
agreed
I think it applies in general
yep
Which is why in game, I wouldnt think about it
Right
Like...stay far away from Bikki, and dont give Yandere Miku a reason to appear
Otherwise, best option is to just...not even try
In this case, if she’s that touchy...may be better to try to talk her down to some level, or talk Hibiki into telling Miku what actually happened...assuming that Bikki doesnt cower in fear
Thats different
He implanted a 3rd Eye into her head and pointed her in the direction of his opponents
Like...if she flips like that bc you were just saying Hi and wanting to make friends...
An Angry, murderous Miku is not an easily controlled Miku
But...
No reason
Murderous Miku...someone get her Google play cards
Prob simpler, too
Yep
And so by offering somethig she’d want
Youre trying to get info
Yeah
Its a critical
Why?
Oh no
...ouch
well worth the 8.4 million Meseta spent
yeah...ticket #68 at a -3 or -4 pitch sounds closest to Basa so far
now to see how much it sounds like Basa
got the Nana voice ticket...
Nana voice is Female voice #68
Yuka voices Tea
...now I'm gonna go try to find the Nana voice...
yeah, she does
I"m pretty sure Yoko voices Echo
but, it's not necessarily easy to find
I know it exists...
I've been trying to track hers down
Aoi voices Claris Claes
she did a bonus voice
...made a basa in PSO2....need to find the right hairstyle though
<@106866895076003840>  Saki and I can meet you  whenever you'reready to meet up in PSO2
@everyone who all plays PSO2?
I even gave Basa an Excube necklace
Wish more games owuld scale for NG+
oh?
Night of FIre is also good
STANDING ON MY FEET
CALLING YOOUUU
that feeling when you complete the Jatkosota High mission in story mode on Dream Tank Match...and don't get the finnish tank
argh
time to go boko hunting
couldn't find that theme
I just...
...I should get that one
he's on a different ship though
I know he does
?
Fair
If it was, Id think about it
Thought it would be sooner
Argh...in AUGUST? Argh
Whats it for?
Apparently some events here werent supposed to happen yet
Its bc they kinda rushed it a bit
Fair reason
Sparkle has better luck on XDU than I do sometimes
Giggity
I know I got the new Yuka Iguchi single that comes out later this month off there
Nice
Where’d you order from?
Huh...
I wasnt paying any attention
Yeah...Angelica is...interesting
Trails of, Rukia? Or Tales of?
I should do a 2nd playthrough of that
they need to play the whole "Trails of" franchise, not just Sky, Kerrik
<:TsubasaExcited:409481619842400257>
I know
Yep
But for how het heavy it may be...story-wise it MORE than makes up for it
I get Trails of and Tales of mixed up all the time otherwise
...this is why I just call it the Kiseki franchise
thanks
...okay?
what game is that, Rukia?
agreed
dunno
Probably not
I can't find the game, haha
trying to locate on app
that's girls frontline...
Sucks, man
Yeah...stay away from the Pokemon subreddit. The reaction to the Let’s Go Pikachu/Let’s Go Eevee reveal is...a massive jump to conclusions
And if that IS the new generation...then that’s a problem
I think they might be deving multiple ones
The only ones I played were 4 Goddesses Online and Neptune vs Sega Hard Girls
I actually tend to avoid the side games for the most prt
Ive been trying to figure out where the DLC characters from VII are in VIIR, but...this is...strange
...that looks...weird
Link?
Another one?
What?
I have a switch, but I dont play it that much
I have alarms set every 15 minutes from 4 am to 6 am
Amen, Yori. 6 hour sleep is best sleep
I have VIIR on my PS4; Im thinkjg its the inferior version
essentially they're showing no spine in the face of the overly PC crowd
sometimes people take it too far
I get being Politcally correct, but...
ugh...
...really...
good value, Alice
there's one that's close to done if not done for Zero
and both Zero no Kiseki and Ao no Kiseki
have all of TitS too...
I have each of the first 3
and yeah...Sen IV comes out 9/27
huh...cool
the Leegend of Heroes is just..a large series
actualllyy...
Ywah; I prefer 3D fighters over 2D, but...if they added in Bikki, Id lol
Define loads of mahjong
I heard about that
basa can't aim
that's just...sad
oh yay...the over political correctizaton of society continues
never mind, got it
I have the ones I want already, but....
why would steam remove them?
sword of culture....nice
yep
I'll play, but SUndays are a no go....
when would we play?
man...
hmm...
3
I DLed that game last night after finally finding it
huh...nice
this game...is officially on my avoid at all costs list
yeah...
maybe the Warriors Orochi game this fall?
idk if there are really any other games coming out this year that interest me
KH3 launch date needed
Madden 19 comes out 8/7...or 8/10
Sen IV is out on 9/27
that's not gonna happen before IV is released
there are other, bigger games that have my attention ahead of Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee
man...I'm not a nintendo slave
Sen IV aka Trails of COld Steel IV
saving my money and putting it toward Sen IV and KH3 instead
yep...
man...least I can put any money that would have gone to that toward something like Sen 4 or KN3
but idk what I feel about this...it's a trip back to Kanto. ANd I didn't see a radically different combat system here
yeah...it seems optional
to me, this is just...disappointing
and tbh, the go fucnctionality almost feels like a desperate attempt to make that useful
I mean...I'll get it, but...I'm not sure how I feel about this getting priority over a new region or over something like SInnoh remake
not at all
and...we're not getting that
but I was expecting a full battle system makeover
it seems like a decent idea
I mean...
looks kinda...dumb
this...
...
just...what
...what
ever since, I've overgrinded when playing the Neptunia games
whenever that one came out
so...
I think I got that far on the Vita version
it's been a while since I played it
I wanna say at the exhibition in Lastation
it's been a while
at one point I think there was
Actually, out of all of them, Re;Birth 1 is the only one of the main series games that I haven't beaten....mainly b/c of the giant difficulty spike at a certain point. That taught me to grind like hell in ANY game
I have it for Vita and PC, so...not sure the need for it
...just seems needless to re-release on PS4
why on PS4 too?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_-5yaBnVIc
...
the Saori tank wins
...took long enough...
FRIGGING MALLARDS
ARGH
...THIS MISSION
1 vs all of Oarai's tanks
oh hey, cool, 1 vs 8
5 of them and one tank of mine, even though I get to pick what tank I use
beat it thoug
well...that was annoying
...whose fucking idea was it to make a mission where it's you vs 5 Mauses in Dream Tank Match?
Supposed to have launch date announcement at e3
okay...Jatkosota High School complete...just...Anzio, Kuromorimine, Oarai, St Gloriana, Saunders, and Chihatan left
heh...jsut took me 15 tries, lol
FINALLY got past the annihilation match...
...as I'm listening to MXC in the background
1 vs 5, let's go
then the only possible match left is one on one
if I can get by this...
oh boy...HIlls...vs PRavda...Annihilation Battle
I can beat every other mission of theirs easily, but...that one is just aggravating
...I just can't seem to beat the annihilation match part
yeah
seriously starting to hate the Domination Battle using Jatkosota High in Dream Tank Match
ah...ibu's still playing p5
but playing Mahjong would be...kinda trikcy
...I keep wanting to throw them in a broom closet and barricade the door until they say something
although watching Nodoka and Saki going all googly eyes all the time without saying anything is...irritating
am seriously watching Saki lately...it's entertaining
We still dunno what her full ones are
Then Saki reveals her supernatural powers, lol
Random BS Rinshan Kaihou out of nowhere
Kan
Re-send me the link to the rules? ill look them over while at dinner
Hmm...
Nationals is “who is the baddest monster out there”
A National-class Monster
Oh?
Idk why, I like Saki and just the sheer godly level of asspull she can pull off
I just did a rewatch, lol
I didnt like the extra video at the end of the last ep of Saki season 1, just bc of how the whole rain around nodoka and her little present from Saki being on the ground
Lol true
Who is there just for Lulz
Except the token guy
Yep
Nodoka is...shes so obv hoh for Saki, but just refuses to say anything
Lol
Etopen...
...and Ive been listening to “True Gate” and “Zankoku no Negai no Naka De” on loop for weeks
I should get a bunch of Saki x Nodoka screens and pics...need that
I just got to the restaurant, so I’ll keep up to date
Well...Ive gotta learn the game, haha
We all gonna try to summon our inner e-mahjong gods?
I kinda wanna learn mahjong; should be fun when I get back from dinner
Yep
Ive never played Mahjong before, but...with how much I enjoy “Saki”, kinda wanna learn
Will have to do so when I get home from dinner
Id think about it for sure; could be fun to learn
feels bad getting bullli'd in Mahjong
yeah...a bit
so we need to create an ID, right?
Okay...
Tenhou, right?
Saki's manga
Is the new chapter out yet?
Gives me time to try to learn the game
So should be back at computer in...25, 30 tops?
paying bill now
Uh...just eating the order now
And Teru is...just blatantly cheap
Yeah...gotta become a monster to counter a monster
Im up to date
I read as much as I could to catch up
I know I had fun with it til now. Gotta finish it though
Yeah, its similar to it
Super Heroine Chronicle? It is
Still have to finish it, but may restart from the beginning
Yeah...I have that game
Guessing like...possibly 90 minutes at latest?
We just sat down
Going to dinner now, so Ill be a little bit; you guys start, Ill hop in when I get there
shit...sorry <@138131889142628352> , I pased out early last night
next week
anyone else want to jump in to the mahjong games?
get ready for complete craziness
let's see how you can do
we wanna voice chat for this?
alright...just got home
<@138131889142628352> Getting ready to leave restaruant now; shouldnt be more than 20 minutes
eh...DOA6 announced
possibly
How dumb we talking aboit?
Of course
Kanami’s jaw dropped, lol
Bride Hiyori
Sony is tomorrow...arent they?
Lol
Lol
Has my attention
Vesperia definitive edition
Most titles release in an unfinished state
I think it got pushed back bc of the feedback from the content creators who went to the one event
Prob shouldnt be though
Im a bit surprised by evilAqua
<@&454399806123671555> who’s up for a game later tonight?
Bad luck, man
Nomura gonna be a troll
Especially since his heartless and nobody are back
That’s the tough part
Fair enough
They better explain just how that happened, but I think that wandering the darkness for however long definitely didn’t help
Frigging dark Aqua Xehanort bc reasons...
I prefer physical
But Im gon a get this one too, just a question of whether physical or digital
Same
Not gonna do that personally: dont care for the figures included
...watch as peoplepay $230 for the Deluxe + edition
That is true
Bc finding a copy could easily be a PAIN
This is one
...with some games you do
Yeah...gonna start a preorder on that one soon
Prob not as uber cheap as Lingering Will on Critical, but in terms of story bosses...that’s gonna SUCK
That’s gonna be effing stupid
That’s gonna be an obnoxious fight I think
Eh...no, but given how 2.8 played out...for her to fall to darkness like that is kinda cold
Okay, ngl, not happy about what I see at the end of that KH3 trailer
it's all about maxing out th experience in the conferences
don't care for that one
Destiny 2 Forsaken...
Black Ops 3 on PS+ as of tonight
people gotta get comfortable
well...
interesting
they changed their approach to e3 this year...
Last of Us Part 2
yep
I'm trying to igure out what game
2 girls kissing, a dude getting disemboweled...hell of a kickoff
holy shit...
first game of the conference...
...WOAH
sony conference, let's see what they have
I gave up on watching the PC gaming show
yeah, pretty much
this thing is being talked about as a modder's haven; tought o say form trailer
3) Forgotten City
looks fairly interesting, but...dunno
Game looks like a wannabe CoD and PUBG mix
2) Mavericks Proving Grounds
game has alpha coming shortly
1) Satisfactory looks fairly cool
summary of PC gaming show...
EvilAqua better be a royal pain of a boss fight, otherwise that reveal is gonna be a total BS drop
Man...I think its too late in the process for that type of delay now
Like that’ll stop people from droppinng $250 on the Limited+ edition though
If Nomura needs the extra month to make sure it’s polished, so be it
Amazing Spiderman game...
oh yeah
but that looks SICK
Kojima's talkinga bout some creepy stuff this one
woah...
Death Stranding...looks interesting
LOL WHAT THE EFF
oh hi new Kairi
oh hello
RE2 remaster looks sick
Ghost of Tsushima looks interesting
that's what they said in game
but for hose in attendance, it might
*not
for us it might now
it sets the mood for the audience in the theatre
it's about putting on a show
not necessarily
Okay, valid point
Oh? Any reason?
I expect kazoe yakuman
<:SuzukaDelight:413201179267432469>
<:SakiShock:455848986738425886>
No dice, huh
In up for a few rounds of mahjong later
ouch
I'm annoyed by it
...leaving mid-game like that
that sucked...
<@138131889142628352> Just don't go and pull a NOdoka, haha
I don't think so
...is it a bad thing?
I DLed it, but just...havent started it yet
I have to start that game
It’s...pretty good from what Ive heard
Ive heard of it
Yaku
Lol
I'm done
might get Anthem as well, don't know yet
Kerrik, anything carry over from the demo to Shining Resonance Refrain?
okay..>Crew 2, KH3, and SRR all preordered...may get AC Odyssey as well, but we'll see
hmm...don't care enough about Fifa to get that
looking at the other games available on preorder
preordered...
when does AC Odyssey come out again?
and right now I"m looking to see if it's there. I don't think it will be, but...never know
either one has all the content
huh...I'm gonna look on PSN to see if it's pre-ordderable
when's it coming out in the west again?
Praise be to Nana
totally gonna hop on PSN and order that now
...
too bad Nana's a villain this game
making me want to get it...
man...
...
yeah; I think a friend of mine has his bluestacks rigged to get it working
mahjong...
Yeah....he played sharp
The complete neptunia bundle?
<@&454399806123671555> Anyone up to play a match?
Ive gotten used to playing the occasiknal shooter on console, but they’re prob better on PC
Eh...up to you
Go for it
Saki's riht, guys...
the favorites aren't living up to their expectations
this year is insane
kinda wanna see Japan get to elimination rounds at least
I watched the entire thing
tie game final
split points, wfc
totally want the Kanami in Yuna attire, lol
okay...count me in for that one
Yuuki Yuna x Toji no MIko mobile game xover event?
what's htis?
?
Yoshimitsu KOed themself...LOL
Lol
Summary?
which one?
Lol nice
hmmm..windwaker run must have run long
should be playing it now
Yeah...whoever came up with the story of New Gundam Breaker needs to be taken out back and shot with a twin buster rifle

beach Franka's cafe is best franka's cafe
I havent played Gundam Breaker yet...idk how it is
Nice
The Crew 2 and New Gundam Breaker DLed; Sen no Kiseki IV: The End of Saga pre-ordered...I had a fruitful gaming day yesterday
<@!263983345669505025>
preordered Sen no Kiseki IV today...
12-15 straigt DDR sets is a good workout
Cant help but scream in frustration
Just...a brutal way to lose
Zetsubou...
That horrible feeling when playing DDR at Round1...and losing an extra stage on the very last note
what's its name again?
oh?
and I think that may be b/c of how it's a different design team for this one than the previous ones
but....combat does feel like it kinda gangs up on you at times
and I've played through 1 of the 6 girls' storylines
there's a ton of Gunpla in it
Horrible storyline, plus kinda a little clunky combat atm
so unless you like Gunpla a TON, I wouldn't recommend getting New Gundam Breaker
...I digitaled it, so...oh well
I preordered it
I should prob. check my PS4's storage and make sure I have room
that's next week...
Shining Resonance....that's right...
some characters too op
so...a Pokemon Fan Game...with FFVIII's Triple Triad in it?
painful
that is...
what game, Latooni?
what game?
possibly 10 with tthat Wild Gengar I caught last night
yeah...and I'm raising 9 team members at once
but, no real way to fix that
so I played more of that Pokemon Fan Game yesterday...didn't expect the Celadon Gym to be at 3; team is underlevelled now apparently...
I'll need to start my copy of that game tonight sometime
very nice
GET IT AND PLAY IT
I get the feeling i"m missing out
and I'm glad I've got it digital....but...
that good, huh?
I have to start my playthrough later tonight
nice
Platinum is so fun
Won race 2 and 3, then he edged me out in race 4
Had him beat, then got blue shelled in the last turn
Man...that first race of the round was SO close
Played 8 deluxe on the switch for this
Hes there
I played Black Yoshi the whole time

Won the overall prize
But, managed a tie
Tough to when you get hit by everything
And I face a Supervisor. This’ll be fun
Final is best of 3 races
I like the line “Get across the wall”
And yeah, the Princess Principal one
Made FINAL round
Been listening to “The Other Side of the Wall” the whole time too, lol
Get to play semifinal in...25 minutes
Won quarterfinal match
Quarterfinal starts soon
That was on the last lap
Only time I was in danger was when got hit by back to back red shells in a 10 second span
Had items on the whole time
Nope
Had full control over my round 1 race
Participating in a Mario Kart tourney at work today
Lol
Fact is, out of everyone in that tourney who faced that sup today, I had the most success
Nana as the one character....Basa voice on a villain is AWESOME
or at the Legend of Heroes games
look at the Persona games
can still be done 100x better
lol
I"m playing Refrain mode and saving a playthrough, lol
yeah...bonding the Basa-voiced chick with the main haracter
I know which character I"m aiming for max bonding points with, lol
PS4 version came with the JP voices
Ive got plenty of games I need to play through, lol. End of September is gonna be rough
Okay
Ive had a switch for almost a year, and barely play it aside form the occasional Mario Kart
Right
I kinda wonder how that’ll work in the Lets Go games
That’s what Im thinking it’d have to be
Yeah
Under Cycling Road, if I had to guess
nice
LOL
How the hell...
<@!246146781832806401>
I havent heard good things aboit 5
How would you rate Star Ocean 3?
Good game
it's to the pint my team leader is talking about making a Rocky or Karate Kid-esque training video
man....
I'm now expected at work to win the tourney next month
and hell yes, I'll be in it
MK8D has another work tourney next month
Welcome to the Kondocoaster
I still have to finish my 2nd playthrough of sen III
No throwing him in the deep end of the pool?
But, sounds like Ys works well for you
Man...Legend of Heroes is good too
I hate it
Eff this stage
https://youtu.be/c_qNhgT2qIY
I just don't know for sure what I'd still need to do at this point
same
just b/c I know I'd get absorbed into it
...I haven't wanted to do a 2nd playthrough on P5...
How was it?
...dunno
What game, kerrik?
Woot
Kerrik, what is your power level?
Evil laugh Chris?
I liked Makoto, Kawakami, and damn, the doctor’s rank 10 in P5...
I did like Mitsuru form P3 though
Not them, but P3 was okay...liked the game, though Tartarus got repetitive
Maria’s gonna get jealous of Best Teacher, outside
But, I lean toward Makoto or the Go Player...
Ann was fun too
if they ever did a director's cut, they could add her
as a party member, that is
I like her. Too bad they didn't put her in
it really is a fun read
I just never finished it b/c distractions are a thing
it's fun
might actually try to play through it and take screens or something
I have the game
she's a fun character
yep
Bikki in Tekken would still be absolutely insane
well yeah, but...
if Hibiki joined Tekken...that would get interesting
Harada-san fought in EVO
lol
LOL
https://youtu.be/mpY8me_tfGk
Sometimes I have to LOL
Though Im on PS4
Sketch, I’ll play later on after work...so like 5:30 pm est
I want the "Don't ask for Sh!t" shirt, lol
man...who knows....by the director of Tekken showed up in a "Don't ask for Sh!t" t-shirt at that announcement for hte season pass 2
I remember reading that one of the higher end melee players had a chat with the Evo organizers about Melee's future there
b/c their game, while still a huge draw...
pretty sure it was just Melee players...
ugh...Frame Arms Girl collab in PSO2...
it is
yeah
one sec
cool cool
damn...nice
but damnt hat's a pricy hobby to get into
yeah....haven't played in years, but I had space marines at that point
there was a whole club about it
used to play 40k in middle school
Otherwise, when Sen no Kiseki IV arrives, I’ll be happy to dive into that
Will give a better answer after Ive had time to play it
I could go on a RANT about how they handle it, but...dont really care to get into the idea of a monopoly over a license preventing innovation
I get it bc Im a fan of the sport
Dunno yet
Havent had time to play
Doubtit though
I got the new Madden, Saki. Have it installed on my PS4, still havent touched it. Kinda wondering if Im getting apathy toward it already
I got a new game the other day and still have yet to play it
Ouch
then this is prob. the best chance
if you had the mney, I'd say to grab it
huh...nice find
not a fan of that
Fifa, Madden, NHL...any ea sports game that has an Ultimate Team mode has them
