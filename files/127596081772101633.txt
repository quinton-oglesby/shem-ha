Hello
If they did mean to make the opening a faster version of the swan songs then they are really smart
i guess im not the first to find it
oh i scrolled up
Do as you please
It’s actually the full song
I found this
So uh
https://youtu.be/spSgFGVdHPE
the hurricane messed up the sub scheduling i remember that
ill take a raw link
||Am I the only one that feels like the ending is gonna be like a glorious break..||
too many to count in the first few minutes
this was from the commie subs discord i think it's saying they arent dead
anime logic
||final commander is going to be the final move im calling it ||

Now all we need in this season is the last action hero
I just wanna know more about that guy at the beginning
raw comes out in like 17ish minutes to download
Ayy
Hopefully it’s out by the time I get back home from work
Alright
Cause last week kirika’s was uploaded like yesterday some how
Anyone know what time shirabes songs come out?
I need the next episode now
Has anyone thought of using a spectrogram to see if there’s anything hiding in the songs?
So that’s probably why Miku was *there*
I saw someone say that fudou will try and make Miku use the gauntlet and it makes sense with what Miku said in ep 1
Honestly I feel like that’s the fastest Hibiki has been able to get someone on her side ever since Chris
Yeah Vanessa seems like she wants to work with Hibiki
I was shouting at my screen for Miku to do the chant but like blood fountain happened
I’m hoping that splash of blood was that weird inspector guy
Plus why do you think it’s been taking so long for her to become a card in XDU?
They did but there’s been hints of Elfnein wanting to bring carol back
Idk but I felt like Elfneins eye color changed during this scene
And yeah carols return feels like it’ll happen
Thank you!  Now I have something to hold me off for the next 6 hours of waiting to get to download them on my phone
So uhh anyone willing to see if there’s a video of Maria’s song uploaded for me or at least some place for me to listen to it until I get home
Especially with how after ep 5 was
All the cliff hangers this season being followed up with that ending is just gonna make me mad at the song for a bit
This seasons ending is going to haunt me for months
I miss the good old days when all of them were participating in the final attack
Or they could go on the XDU route and find a piece of Shenshoujing and augment that with the bracelet
Is tsubasa gonna crash her bike this season?
There’s another screenshot though that was something else and was conflicting
I do not like these screen shots
But Hibiki’s dad is there
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657> why
...

Idk if y’all spotted anything on this but
Like the ending showing all of the older scenes
The ending hurt me
So uhh Maria and Chris unison card please
we've ascended from train
its a hype rocket
its no longer a hype train
||i inverted the colors for this scene, it seemed familiar on why the background looked interesting||
can we call this gear Shem-Ha Shou Jing
the end scene was interetsing tho
||mostly cause we suffered enough through the episode||
||maria went commando||
THEY DID NOT MISS THAT
WAIT
here's a great in between frame i got for everyone

shem-ha has slight ver face syndrome i just realized
what if thats the only XDU event that's canon
fuck i can't stop crying
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
saturdays are gonna be dry af now
