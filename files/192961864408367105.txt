<@676272618839605249> excellent
I don't run anything on PoW chains
no, proof of stake only
3 million dollars
you are not wrong
combined market cap is 3 million so not exactly worthless
I would try to explain how it works or what it does but it's probably just wasting my time
go ahead and report
yes that is my project
hello
Crypto mcap is still very low, so it is manipulable by people such as Musk
They do want the ledger properties of the blockchain as well. Being able to track any currency transaction from any individual to another is pretty powerful
By issuing currency and giving it out you can hide in plain sight structural problems without solving them or having to tax the rich
Central banks over issuing currency is a worse problem than ""internet people"" buying and selling currency
If anything over regulation and financial institutions getting in are causing less volatility
Read the news, not the headlines
and so is Indonesia
Because China is developing the digital yuan
All countries will move to digital currencies, they are already working on it
Musk must go to prison ||or shot down||
Traditional banks scam clients and especially old people or people with no financial knowledge
as these tricks are done upon other venues and technologies
Assuming a technology is at fault because it's used with ill intent rather than for what it was designed for is quite fallacious
Tulips or post stamps scams existed before crypto
Those will fade away with regulation
And not a problem in PoS
The gas currency is mined
Shitcoins are not mined
Mark my words, you will stop seeing any ill news about crypto as soon as it is controlled by the classic institutions
Which is already happened
Long term value will come from the moment it is regulated and used by institutions
3 billion credit cards are in circulation, this is a huge plastic wastage that no one seems to care about. Plastic wastage is hugely detrimental for the environment. These 3bn cards are issued every few years. This is not counting debit or bank plastic cards.
Ethereum has done 2 updates on this and the last update is fully PoS, the other top networks like SOL, BSC or ADA are fully PoS
Bonds give low returns, my returns on crypto are just impossible through traditional finance
PoW energy consumption isn't even that higher than cooled datacenters for Netflix or Youtube, and it is actually behind energy wastage from fast fashion
Most top currencies are proof of stake nowadays
Only true of proof of work protocols being phased out
As a long term store of value it is advantage for anyone
Crypto is inherently easier to follow than paper trails. It's a public ledger after all
They have to resort to the dollar
Fiduciary already has that problem in countries where their currency suffers heavy inflation
That's because you are withdrawn from it. A lot of people benefit from it. NFTs as art is just one way to use a digital proof of ownership
Actually for the poor people it's more important because our only way to manage money is to save up, but saving up is discouraged due to inflation, so you are pushed to consume instead
All currencies are referenced to other currencies in their own market.
Right now their use is a long term store of value that beats inflation on fiduciary currency
This is fallacious as it opens no other venues. To trade you must be registered on a CEX and all your trades are public. It's easier to fraud through an actual bank
That will happen in about five years after the last halving. Monero is quite stable, though
Rich people have offshore bank accounts and companies to avoid taxes through for decades and decades
Only the poor people could not use it
Banks and financial institutions are set up in a way the rich have always avoided taxes
They already did that even before btc existed
That happens with traditional systems
The worth of crypto is allowing disadvantage people to trade and get ahead without being crushed by totalitarian governments
and it is backed by the war power of the issuer
Fiduciary money is paper and metal that is worth because everyone agrees so
Worth is subjective
I must try to find a way from which to escape*
Not speculating, market cycle is statistically proven
I buy the dips
Enjoy your 1% annual returns
so am I
Any hole through the system is welcome
But we are living in a capitalist system with no escape
But yes I do agree with you
Have you read the original BTC paper
I think that should be understandable
I trust more crypto than the American government
And that is why many working class people are trying to find refuge in cryptocurrency, to not to see their savings eaten
Inflation is but one datum, you need to account for cost of living. My point is that average worker has less money every year
Both are to be taken into account
Real wage in quantity does not mean the actual wage vs cost of live is increasing
And the USD is being printed non stop that leads to inflation
Welfare is a necessity in a capitalist society otherwise working class just gets fucked
Also the case for many western Europe nations
The US has a huge inflation and a dramatically decreasing salary vs cost of living
The US?
Being the case for your country does not make it the general case
Purchasing power, minimum wage, salary vs cost of living are all worse in most of the developed world
Yeah that is not the case for most of the world
https://lmgtfy.app/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=minimum%20wage%20against%20inflation
Wages are stagnant
and this is by design
But they do not
Yes, and our main currencies are inflating too fast
You need to take into account USD inflation too to do that comparison
Read a lot on the subject tyvm
The USD is also suffering heavy inflation
For that to happen there were a series of events, mostly economical, including to mismanaging inflation
I had a fat paycheck in Japan and my saving power was diminishing month by month
The currency is inflated and their government and their economical policies are crap
That is the breaking point
And it's become increasingly worse
The reality about Japan is an increasing portion of the nation surviving day by day in part time jobs that, yeah, seem as there is no unemployment, but they work endlessly for a just wage to survive in a currency that devaluates month after month
It was a major factor
It wasn't back then
You need to increase money velocity and allow lower class people to earn and spend money, this is widely understood
Social policies were the solution there
Economy in Japan is a wreck
I have lived in Japan for long enough to tell you the Post is manipulative and wrong
Unironically
Weimar Germany printing money out of thin air caused Hitler to rise
Money can be printed but value cannot be created out of thin air
Currency is volatile because you need to back it up
A crypto is a token of value for exchange of managing your state on the blockchain, its value derives from people selling and buying it for fiat
People can manage value by themselves and agree between themselves without anyone leeching on them
Banks themselves are unnecessary should blockchain technology continue to advance
We have now worldwide technology and the power of automation
Currency is just a means to account for value
Not on a piece of paper
The actual value is held on the work of people and their produce
Exchange of value happens irregardless of fiat currency
China also had renewable sources, though, and is actually improving on that regard
Energy plants produce a lot of wastage, it is preferable if it's used
On China miners used leftover energy that would go to waste anyway
No long ago Iceland held a large part of mining using geothermical
While it is preferable I've become too cynical to believe this is plausible within my lifetime
Yes, which is orders of magnitude bigger than crypto waste and they are the ones telling you "nooo do not go there it's a scam and not green"
Every single thing is the enemy of ecology right now -- entertainment you consume daily is a huge energy waste coming mostly from carbon, too
I do not wish to partake in the current capitalist production system, I do not wish for my surplus value to be stolen. I have two options which are large scale violence or find a way to escape it on my own. I chose the latter.
Fiat currency is used as a tool of power by governments and banks to control working class and their standing
Which I would agree, I certainly think governments and capitalist institutions are simply too corrupt and see no other choice that does not involve mass scale violence.
That's contradictory. Capitalism is enemy of ecology, and crypto is the freest of mArkets.
1. Proof of Stake is the dominating protocol, energy efficient.
2. Most crypto mining energy comes from renewable sources.
3. Classic finance has a huge power wastage in cold datacenters, non recyclable plastic credit cards issued year by year, paper being used to print money with chemicals that are bad for the environment.
Retarded, but not inherently evil
Yes, they are becoming commodities for wealthy people to display their wealth just like jewelry
So a decentralised solution that passes through other people that think the same to store my value seems a better option
Banks are evil and I do not wish to use them for my savings or managing money
My point is that the hardstance for the most economical liberal is that crypto is bad for the economy, while they could be right in your position it is logical to assume that it is actually negative to their own position which is to live off of the working class
The current lack of chips is not a crypto problem, plus there is non gpu mining for PoW plus most top coins use PoS right now
and I run my project cooperatively
Most money in crypto is not from working class people but from financial institutions and multi million companies
Hardline republicans say the same as you do, does that not seem like some sort of cognitive dissonance?
It's classical financial institutions and pro capitalist governments telling you that crypto is the evil, though
Attaching an image into it is just a side effect
It's a digital proof of ownership
NFTs are not images
Non fungible token is a design
That is inherently wrong
There is no ethical consumption under capitalism
They will remove the need for big companies just taking working class people money for the stupidest of things
NFTs as a technology are for digitally signing property
Those must be mocked
This is fallacious as you are assuming anyone losing is striken into poverty
what about Jeff Bezos
Don't worry, most people losing in crypto are ancaps who deserve to lose it 🙂
Do you know what banks do with your savings to generate interest for you?
If you trade currency and win with it, someone else lost with it
Someone is losing on any financial asset you own or manage
Workers must be kept oppressed and producing for the corporations
That's by design
Even though I am earning several times more
How is that even right
I am ironically paying less taxes in percentage now than waging
They are less worth year by year as they are privatised
It does if it actually were the case, in practise this only works for salaried workers
In Europe you pay way more even in lower brackets
My income tax with mediocre salary was already over 20%
You must not earn much then
One of my implementations btw
You do not do that you use a smart contract that's designed to escrow between two people automatically
Still lower than modern day capitalist countries
An automated program just works and you cannot force it to do anything else
or violence yes
Contracts require a trusted third party
There are no capital gains
State owned companies means the main tax is income tax
That is very socially valuable
It can be used for mathematically verifiable trustless exchange between two individuals
Debatable, on crypto you can use an automated protocols to manage your assets without a bank or financial institution leeching off of your toil
All of its periods had sensible taxing
https://www.jstor.org/stable/41790717
Current system is designed for the rich
They borrow against their assets
Because they do not have income but simply assets
It stops existing for the actually rich
But tax is not progressive really
No need for taxes when the state manages things for you
The URSS had less taxes than modern day western nations
This holds true in communist countries, does not work on capitalist hellholes
My grandpa didn't have running water or electricity
I am self educated, didn't have money for college
I literally paid more taxes than Netflix in my country
The value of blockchain is not a product but decentralisation by itself
Rich people have little to no taxes on capital gains whereas I pay a much bigger percentage on wages or on my crypto gains
Taxes for the poor are inherently evil
You cannot even use a regulated CEX
Good luck trying to win money with crypto on the states and go through that tax hell
Videogames are just bit and bites
There is value in non physical products
Overpriced, but yes
Financial corporations and capitalist governments are against it because they want you to keep waging for the corporation so they can keep leeching your surplus value for 50 years and leave you to die
Apple itself has a higher market cap (and energy wastage) than the entirety of blockchain technology
This is due to a low market cap. As more people adopt it, it is less volatile. This year is a great example of this, every run is less volatile than the previous
With automation and blockchain technology you can have a worldwide economy that is run by the people for the people. That's what the original paper is about
And that you should have somewhat a firm grasp of a technology before you criticise it
My point is that people are willing to criticise or accept practises as good or bad depending on their personal biases
Used to
That's reduction to absurd
My whole point is that it's a very active part of the community
It was most certainly very active when I was playing it
I said a main part
Unless you bet on Shitcoins but then you just go to a casino
Not really, long term is safer and bigger gains
And let's not forget main part of this server and the IP is about a game that uses the most predatory system for users, heh
And you can use a debit card with crypto, actually, pretty much everywhere
Short term on crypto is how you lose money
Well, and monero uses a Proof of Work protocol energy efficient that does not need GPUs
Does not use more than any other server really
Proof of stake will be the only protocol soon
Friends who know what I do ask me to manage their money for them and I refuse
I dislike people who advertise it as so
Yeah it is short term very volatile, that's not arguable. It should NOT be used as a currency or short term investment.
Not gonna argue if part of it seems unethical to you as that is a subjective individual perception
I am a good coder, I saw a place full of scammy practises, decided to run tooling and solutions that go against that
I see offering tooling for people to manage their own wealth by themselves a good thing personally
Well that's a centralised currency, tends to happen
I am confident it will not eternally dramatically lose value
It will not
I won't give away my surplus value nor I will take it
And I see crypto as a huge co-op opportunity
Well, I managed to get here and I run it as a co-op
Of course it will lose value again and then rise again.
This is not a prophecy, this is just true, current value is higher that at any point of its history except a couple of days ago
I think that's the wisest decision
But you do you I actually tell people not to invest
Also the same people telling you to eat bugs are the ones telling you not to invest on it
If you bought BTC and held at any point in history you would be up right now
They are still managers, working for the oppressing class to keep in check the bottom workers
People lose money because they bet on dog shitcoins as they bet on horse races, which I agree should be controlled
I only use it as a long term store of value
That is understandable, as a currency it is not usable
You can consider any salaried work that has a position of power as "joining the oppressors"
The design is meant as the mass being able to peer network their value
That's the opposite of the design, though
Especially because it is kept outside through the use of propaganda
Participating in a peer system that does not derive value from other people's work is not oppressing the working class
Joining the oppressor would be becoming a politician or banker
Even though current industrial tech and automation would allow for the world to live quite nicely without having to work 40 hour weeks 50 years
To keep the cogs spinning
Not wrong, but kinda tired after the political events in my country where I actively participated in a grassroots movements that ended up with another corrupt party helping out neoliberals while eliminating all street based movement in the way
Peer to peer relationships is where you can get meaningful change
My bad then, what I mean is that a taxpayer does not have any inherent power by themselves even though they are paying to support the system
Community wins
But that is not inherently related to being a taxpayer but due to communal action
You need mass scale violence for meaningful changes, which is not ideal
How much time has passed since that
I like Hibiki
Depends on the country. Not sure what would happen if a Japanese company would sue an European one, though
Whereas in decentralised systems you always have some
We have 0 power
kind of a pain in the ass though
I could go to court, win, and get the money back, too
I would just drop the usage and settle
I don't believe it is, though, I specifically asked for a look alike and just use the hibiki name because I went for 響 as the logo, I believe there is no case there
That is not the case for a power grid
Anyone can put up a blockchain node
Well, the problem is who controls each
This could be true and it started as a fun project, so I may have to drop the art entirely if this keeps growing, yes
Sorry you got offended, it was not my intention
Just an observation how a predatory practise is alive on the server but I am notified to attend some sort of trial
I paid an artist and said I wanted a similar character designed
I invite anyone to pursue the case if they believe so
I don't think I've phrased anything in an especially arrogant manner
No one even knows the anime
I am not selling anything related to hibiki, it's just decoration
I am not making money out of a symphogear character
They can be indeed be used as, say, trading cards
That is what I said
NFTs are a technical design not strictly related to art that allow for trustless verification
No, not really, you must have not read anything I said
It is a terrible game
Yes, you are right, I am on my phone now so not very eloquent
Okay that's your personal case, there's no need to get all fired up
Lukewarm socdem politics are being openly called extreme communist worldwide now
Not exactly labour, there are two big unions who receive a lot of money from the government as a subsidy and well you can imagine how that worked for unions and smaller horizontal unions
I agree with you as long as the party power and funding comes from the union bases
Spanish "left" parties are utter trash
I am afraid I know very little about Wales
Thinking on prominent labour parties
I haven't been following the UK much other than it seems to be in a downfall
The whole western sphere is moving towards the neoliberal right
I think that's just the current political compass due to the US influence in social dynamics
Ironically enough Japan's communist party is alright
Most labour parties in the west are a complete failure
It accomplishes what it is meant to do very well: acquiring and selling data
But cultural differences are key here
Works in France
Mass civil disobedience works but you need peer pressure to achieve and maintain it for long enough
The main problem with that is that when unions get big enough they are absorbed into the system
don't join the EU it's a trap
Current situation is just the natural course of modern imperialism
And the middle east would be at peace without US and UK meddling for decades
That sentence is true for most modern day problems <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
It all comes down to the UK being at fault, really
Israel politicians have some hard stances that are hard to stomach if you like democracy
But well what passes as left nowadays is diametrical opposite of materialism so well
It is insulting to any marxist really
You do not want a strong currency on a weak economy
That's actually good if your economy is below the average
Often includes Japan
West is not a nebulous term, it is colonial western European nations, colonial American nations
Yes, but it has sharply increased and keeps increasing right now
Japan external debt is rising a lot
GDP or even GDP per capita does not translate to how well workers live
And this, GDP is a lie
They still have a potent industry
Despite their government attempts at just ruining the country kek
The JPY is shit and it's a very potent economy
The value of a currency in respect to other currencies is not the only important factor, though
zloty is the currency of Poland
Thanks, for the record I dislike those too lol
the new debate is interesting too bad my schedule is packed
no problem I am always open to talk
If you go back in time on those media outlets you will find often articles about how it is a scam or nothing but a ponzi scheme
No, they are not
And then, the campaign will stop
Yes, they are already starting to get into it now, now that it is being adopted by institutions
This is wrong
It has been called a scam by mainstream financial media since it exists
Yet there is no The Economist articles about it
Fast fashion and fast video entertainment are much more problematic sources of energy wastage and contamination
I already explained in detail that the eco narrative is not even entirely right
I am just saying that it is a narrative that has been heavily pushed by mass media
Actual rich people who don't bother with crypto look down on these type of middle class rentists
The mass media is the one pushing the eco narrative
There's levels of rich
In 2 years the mass media is going to be convincing everyone "wait, actually crypto is very good"
They already have started the switcheroo
While you are all repeating what the headlines they put everywhere for years
The thing is, now that we are almost at the last halving and the classic institutions have now commenced accumulating, you are going to see a change of narrative from the corporation media in regards to cryptocurrency and NFTs. It has already begun
Is art inherently bad?
Money laundering exists before crypto
Because it is a middle class commodity (middle class in the traditional sense) that they can market and sell and get easy money from
I also forgot to mention that rich people are not inherently rich nor they do come from a background like us in which it is desirable to get the max amount of returns in the shortest time just to even think about owning a home. Rich people are born rich.

You have businesses, assets, rents to manage. Your main incentive is to keep that wheel spinning so number goes up and to avoid taxation. They are not concerned about cryptocurrency as a form of investment for now, for them it's just child's play. They already have their systems set in place for laundering money through traditional finance, offshore banks and companies to avoid taxes, classic stocks to move around money, and then they borrow against their assets to avoid even more taxes.

When your assets are worth so much and your networth high, borrowing against assets to increase your positions yield gains much bigger than what they get in crypto currency at a much lower risk. There is simply no point for them, for now.
I wonder why would that be...
Crypto is more heavily taxed than any other financial asset that the rich use lol
Most countries have now in place a crypto to crypto tax
That is already the case
The thing is every single trade I have done is recorded publicly forever, this is something you do not want when you are a rich person avoiding taxes
I did 500€ to quite more than 30k€ so I don't find it naive
The rich already have 30m and they have their own means to managing it efficiently and without risk and without having their trades in a public ledger
Net worth comes from assets from which they can borrow against
Just take the case of Nancy Pelosi, her net worth with her salary purely from insider trading, why would she need cryptocurrencies
Rich people already get returns on their wealth through rents, they do not need absurdly high returns -- you can see them saying so when they are the first to slander cryptocurrency
I think that's a pretty good opportunity without doing anything or without getting into more complex systems like automated market makers
Just by virtue of holding through an entire market cycle you can turn $300 into $30,000 while halvings exist
Rich people do not play stocks to get money
While my case is not everyone's and my point of view from the people I know may be slanted, I have seen a huge opportunity for working class folks to acquire wealth that is otherwise not possible through it
The rich do not need to play Cryptocurrency as they already have the systems set in place for them to get richer passively, ie. traditional finance, borrowing against their assets, etc. Anyone can get into cryptocurrency with a very small initial liquidity, it is open to everyone, unlike traditional finance or centralised systems. Anyone can use its decentralised protocols, which are not limited to financial uses.
I compared to entertainment products that are not strictly necessary. Tiktok alone wastes orders of magnitude more energy than any blockchain due to data redundancy, datacenters, and 4k streaming. Datacenters have to be redundant and close for information, and they have to be cooled, this is extreme energy consumption. This is for services like Tiktok that have no justified added value, do we really need so many streaming services for entertainment? BTC alone being the 14th is a debatable factoid that's repeated a lot by the same macro corporation backed media contaminating the planet the most, it is derived from unconnected stats and highballed. Most statistics eyeball it and the minimum and the estimated on their data is separated by an entire order of magnitude, while a single Tiktok video has more energy waste and more impact than a BTC transaction.

What I take from your sentence is that it is somehow OK to use more energy than smaller or undeveloped countries if it's for western entertainment or fast fashion, but it is not OK to use excess energy if it's to allow anyone in the globe to equally trade with peers escaping problems such as authoritative government oppression or macro corporation domination and leechery. This is the narrative being pushed.

Besides that, the fact that Proof of Stake or Proof of Authority protocols are widely unknown is not a coincidence. BSC, ADA, or SOL networks consume much, much less energy than any traditional finance system or entertainment company while providing services to a lot of people, since running one of their nodes is cheap and easy, cost the same or little more as having a hobby website.

Then, to calculate for the actual worldwide cost of BTC, which is a daunting task, what the classical media (NYT, The Economist, BBC, you should see where they are coming from) does is: average the home-mining rig, taking for this calculations the same hardware worldwide; take the daily hashrate, average cost and price of btc; and derive from there. Just a small grasp of statistics will show you that this is inherently wrong by nature of averaging data that cannot be measured together, a non significant p, and trying to derive electricity use from market value. Moreover, carbon emission rate is always or nigh always calculated utilising this previous statistic and deriving it assuming this energy usage is all generating carbon footprint, whereas that is not the case due to the diverse origins of the energy consumed. For instance, China mining rigs were counted mostly as coal energy, whereas most China mining was done with hydroelectric power.

While this media pushes this narrative, fast fashion is not only using more energy, it's also wasting countless metric tones of water and polluting it with diverse chemicals and employing child labour. Two wrongs do not make a right, but by pushing a narrative so strongly it is easier to make people forget or even accept that some of these wrongs are more acceptable than others.
Any current traditional finance tool has been widely used in corrupt manners to make rich richer, wash funds, and even take money away from working class folk
Anime is used widely to wash funds, so is American media
Any entertainment is already tainted
If potentials for rich to get richer and to wash funds are a problem
It is about what this technology permits for the common people
While there's overly enthusiastic people who take it from the wrong optics
My point is that there are more workers getting wealth off of crypto than you give it credit for. It is thus no just a tool for the rich to become rich, as its original movement was fully anarchist by nature and design.
There should be a consideration of sub levels, yes, that was never my point though
"this shitpile" is your external point of view as a non user that does not know the entirety of the possibilities it is being used for
The safety network is on another different level
High class won't, doesn't matter how many times they fail
Such a store owner can actually get poor
High class is so way above that though
He wouldn't, central banks were his idea
Income is relative to several other factors
Any technology will be used by the wealthy to improve their wealth, this does not make the technology inherently designed for the wealthy
But this is deriving from the original point in which the richest people do not need cryptocurrency to acquire more wealth safely nor it is a tool inherently meant for the wealthy
Of course, there are different currents within marxism, some would consider a local storeowner to be a middle class pig
Before, being a landlord had puny returns compared to what the capitalist class was capable of
Until companies like blackrock started mass buying houses
While for us owning 2 houses and living off of it is above our means it's but laughable for the capitalist class
The point is that this person and actual capitalist class are pretty far apart
Well a couple of mistakes here and there
Mao did nothing wrong
For the record I am against a single person owning several houses, I think that should be illegal
If you own two houses you are still nowhere near the level of the capitalist class
In the modern world a worker is still a worker
Class theory is a thing for centuries
While the modern take on middle class is just a skilled worker, the actual original meaning is not
Read marx
No, that's the original meaning
Making you believe having an average salary is middle class is just manipulation so you feel closer to the rich
You are not middle class, you are working class
Yes, because middle class is someone who lives from rents, not the meaning the modern media has pushed
Most people on crypto for the technology entered from 2010 to 2014
A middle class rentist is not upper class either
2 years is a newbie in crypto
BTC is over 10 years old
That is strictly not true. Some people cannot afford food either, are you going to say food is out of reach?
You do not even need electricity to own a cryptocurrency other than a means to store your private key.
The thing is that if everything is inherently bad, nothing is. Blockchain is a technology meant to give power to peer to peer groups without a central authority, it is designed with that goal in mind.
Crypto mining should be considered a service and not a means with which to acquire money, there is no need to participate in the network. You can spin up a node for any PoS, PoA or PoSA network easily and cheaply from a mediocre computer, though.
It is being used for that already, as opposed to forms of mass entertainment whose main purpose and design is to make rich people richer through its production, yet the optics for both are entirely different
brb
And pay inheritance tax in many countries
Blockchain has possibilities for improving people's lives, though
It is heavily taxed (for the poor)
Entertainment is both widely used to wash funds and not strictly necessary, yet it does not receive this open criticism
Not everyone has the luxury of inheritance
Most of them are useless, there are actually but a few standards
In some countries not even saving for 30 years due to salary vs housing price rising at different speeds
Saving up the cost of a house in the west is simply not possible for a lot of people
Literally impossible for many working people
What I am saying is that blockchain is seen as inherently evil or for the use of rich for unethical purposes whereas a full system already exists for it
That wasn't my point
Nice fallacy, yes
Not the case for all the digital currencies
Are you going to never own a house because you would not engage in a mortgage?
Yes, and, are you gonna stop using a bank when you have to use it to receive your salary?
It's not me saying it's the devil created for the rich to get richer
As I said it is but a tool
I will admit that modern technology makes value of work much harder and different from the past centuries theories, though
Exploiting for labour happens because the surplus value is extracted from the worker, not because money exists
Money is just a tool to evaluate worth
Which means that you can run peer to peer organisations despite distance and currency limitations which was a huge limitation in the past into establishing cooperatives on a larger scale
Because the tooling allows for easier decentralisation in a globalised world
It does, though
Which is just a tool on an ideal peer to peer world
Blockchain allows for decentralised decision making and currency
I didn't say it does, you asked me why would I abolish salaried work and I explained
The point is that work relationships should be equal to equal and no one should get part of your produce
Crypto is not a solution to abolish salaried work it's just a tool that can be used to decentralise currency
The whole point is that there is an owner-worker relationship where the worker is subservient
Yes, it's inherent to salaried work
But you get less cash than your work actually produces
Working with freelancers but giving them pay per hour is not different from salaried work
The others are not cooperatives
Does not mean you should disregard technology because it can be abused by the rich because all of it will
Yeah give the value of your work to someone else, great idea
That salaried work must be abolished
Yes, that is going to eventually happen
Salaried work must be finished
Decentralised decision making and the ability to automate contracts means plus peer to peer only work relationships
There is no perfect technology or solution
I am just explaining what it is designed for
Never said it is
Totally decentralised currency and power of decision actually would get rid of the capitalist class without the power to accrue wealth from the toil of others
Capitalism is inherently corporativist so crypto is against it if you go by most classic capitalist literature
no lol it's just neither inherently evil nor as wasteful as people make it to be
What would this be?
It is a public ledger with all transactions recorded, it is not slightly harder to evade taxes, it is much, much harder. Which is why it is gonna be used by states to track taxes. Mark my words.
No, the argument is that it's inherently designed to give power to groups of people to escape control from corrupt corporations and authoritative governments, the fact that institutions get in now does not change this design.
Keeping Greece afloat was detrimental for other states though
Especially de-industrialisation and having to buy nuclear energy from France
EU led policies have increasingly worsened Spain
Greece was already poor tbf
Spain
The EU ruined my country
Eventually you can have a decentralised system for verification of ownership and contract verification with no authority running it but thousands of separated individuals participating in the system
You can automate protocols and contracts, which is actually a huge step
The existence of decentralised automated programs makes this a possibility
A technology by itself cannot produce structural changes on society, people must go along with it
DAOs are not new anymore and much has been advanced in the field
This is actually widely discussed and there's several papers on how to mitigate this
Luckily there's always technological alternatives
Yes, and that is actually my main concern with the current widespread adoption from institutions
Centralised systems means some people end up with power of decision over others
The same way people enjoy entertainment even though a lot of it is created purely to either get wealthier or wash funds (that's why so much entertainment exists that ends up at a loss from production to revenue)
So I find the argument that crypto is inherently bad or should be avoided invalid
Yes, that is the problem
Still less workers than needed to manually produce
It should therefor be treated as cryptocurrency, which can also be used by rich people to get richer
But its only use is so capitalists can employ less workers for more hours and get more money
Does this mean automation is inherently bad or has to be avoided?
Why? Because the capitalists can now extract even more value from the worker on the same hours
Just like automation could have driven down the work hours, but didn't
It is by no means an ultimate solution, just but a tool to be used
And a cryptocurrency ensures a way with which to exchange value that is not controlled by a centralised entity
Blockchain facilitates this kind of relationships long distance
The inability to cooperate with other individuals forming wide peer to peer relationships where no one is subservient to the other
The EU is the diametrical opposite of decentralisation
Rather centralised organisms who decide everything for several nations
There is no tool for a decentralised peer to peer decision making
Those barriers are not broken down
European Economic Community
sorry, EEC in English
They can easily acquire cheaper labour without many problems
It helps more the capitalist class than the workers
EU is not the world nor it allows for easy cooperation between workers from different nations
As some countries get preferential treatment when it comes to their industry
Some countries have had an overall long term negative effect from being in the EU
And the EU / CEE allows this
And, ultimately, the EU follows neoliberal policies that only make the divide bigger
While you can travel and have a similar set of regulations within Europe, you have also places like Monaco or Andorra where the rich can evade taxes
The euro has had a negative impact on some economies, though, as was discussed here yesterday
Any global economic downturn can be bad like that though and that happens often in capitalism
The thing is, to provide advanced technological services your country needs to offer the education and the same living standards to engineers
During covid we saw that countries with local industry fared better economically. Of course a black swan event, but still
Not a sustainable method
Spain imports money from drunks from other countries
So instead of exporting
In the case of Spain, industry was foregone to live off of tourism
A nation cannot subsist on receiving materials from the exterior
Trade routes must exist
Having internal produce is not the same as autarchy
Industry is still a third of Germany's economy
It's fucked
The moment there is a problem, any problem
If a country becomes to dependent on other countries
To be able to have production and to be able to serve its population without having to wait for money to come from outside
kek
A country needs to have its own potent industry
It is terrible for a country to survive with only tertiary economy
I dislike their neoliberal policies though
I do like the same currency and open borders, mind you
And if we go to fishing and agricultural produce it gets even worse
The EU is Germany's and to a lesser extent France's playground to get ahead in industry and energy
Not like Germany paid everything even though Greece forgave their debts from world war
States already in a bad situation, mind you
It is also easier, just provide ID card to CEX and buy
I pay my parent's mortgage in Euros so it was important to me that it didn't grow Vs my salary
Whereas I thought that hedging on crypto I would at the very least beat both inflation and yen devaluation
Long term
Gold is not even positive
I did a comparison of return of investment and value upholding of both
That's why I started holding crypto
I lost a shitload of money just by holding it in the bank lol
My last salary was in yen
Gonna be honest don't see that happening within this century lol
Like "Belgium cannot possibly be that bad, right"
Always thought you guys exaggerate
Possibly, from what I heard
lol
Also not possible due to Euro
See if that were automated there would be no problems <:satanialol:592779639798104087>
Tbh microstate economies cannot be applied to large scale states
Ah too bad
Who needs a government
Didn't Belgium do good in that time
COVID year was devastating and it is going to ripple on the economy for a decade at least
You don't feel most of them tbh
As usual problems would be avoided with proper design and maintenance
Top kek
And going to carbon
Japan also wants less nuclear now after Fukushima
And who decides that? If a government can suddenly decide what's good or bad ideas it can go south pretty fast
regarding the US what can you expect of a country that allows citizens to freely carry military grade weapons
UK has a similar system that's also terribly flawed
Roman law is better imho
Common law is a mess
Prosecutor and witness were awful they could have gotten at least one of the minor charges
having decentralisation in a world where AWS and Google control everything you digitally own is good
cars are used to run people over yet you wouldn't say all cars are shit and only good for evil deeds just because of that
not a technology problem
what people do with it is people's problem
it's just a digital p2p contract
You just need revisions and historic of those
And just like you can forge a contract to make it look like the real one, it will still be fake
Those also have big problems with leakage and people sharing the paid content for free
or like buying a fake purse from a street market
but that's nothing new, if anything just a resurgence of the 90s internet
thing is anyone can also spin up a node see the file content and it is public knowledge where it comes from
kinda like having a bittorrent server for files but easier to manage for the server side
You can run it on your own node and someone else just needs to spin up another node and it's there
you can upload whatever you want to IPFS and it will be there forever
Yep, using it as proof of ownership should go alongside to legally binding documents that ie.   point to the asset that is proof
The way in which it is represented is entirely arbitrary
In the end proof of ownership is just a human artificial construct
A digital decentralised certificate can be accepted as proof of ownership
You are speaking about common law countries here
That also depends on the country
Depending on the country even a verbal contract is legally binding
but law is going to go in favour of corporations
if anything it should be illegal that you suddenly cannot play the game you bought so long ago
but illegal does not always mean unethical
yep
and well you can play online through modified unofficial servers
you can play single player campaign though
whereas on digital goods they can and will
Yeah but no one can remove your ability to access the files
more and more companies do this, restrict access to your own games since you actually just purchase a license to play it
it is unlikely, but they can arbitrarily remove all your games (or shut down and remove them all)
you do not own your steam games, steam does
it does not prevent it
the only thing laws do is punish that
has already decided to do something very evil
whoever decides to do that
yes
It's not good for tech on an early stage to get wide adoption so fast
I am not telling you to get into it, hell, quite the opposite lmao
If a doctor told you you have no idea about medicine, would now that be condescending?
I am not condescending, I think most people commenting here lack understanding of the underlying technology, speaking from the point of view as someone who works with said technology as an engineer
It's just my impression
am I now, not my intention
I didn't even defend the nft bros, said several times they are cringy af
I think you just prefer to be in an echo chamber and would prefer not to have someone that doesn't fully agree
I am "invested" in the sense that I work with the technology
I like correcting what I see as misinformation
nft bros themselves do not understand blockchain
I do not imply, I openly say it
nope
Since I actually understand the underlying technology and have followed it from the beginning
Just clarifying stuff
Just saying that the nft stuff won't last for long
Never said that
and I am the wealthiest of my entire social circle right now
I come from a poor working class family
no
Nothing more hilarious than watching the channel for liquidations and seeing rich people being liquidated a million on a short or a long
Funnily enough I know of a lot of wealthy people losing big on crypto since they do not care about losing those quantities and working class people winning on it
Everyone else is not in
There's either the ones trying to money signal buying them and those trying to flip them for gains knowing well what it is
The value is completely arbitrary
is it a grift if you are greedy and trying to gain a lot of money on illiquid assets that you know have no inherent value
nfts already have much less volume than when opensea shit boomed few months ago and it got out of crypto twitter sphere
not even optimistic, that's how crypto fads work
it's not going to survive the current cycle, will be adapted to less ponzi and more tech as intended come a year or two tops
There is no such thing as bad publicity
Everyone is giving them shit all the time which only causes the collections to get more exposure, for free
This is mostly because of the attention
pretty much works like that yeah
it's just a social standing club thing adapted to the modern day
the combined iq of bored ape buyers cannot exceed three digits
where there's a buyer there's a seller
it's more for games of the same publisher, you can of course take in different game cards and adapt them to yours but that's harder to work out
There's already some proof of concept trading card games doing that
But given enough edge over competition some may be willing to try
Yeah, it would be better for players than the companies behind games, that's for sure
since you can transfer items from game A to game B without needing to upkeep a server at all on the company side
it is a possibility that game devs start using it to transfer items between their games without having any additional server costs
Never been sarcastic on this whole conversation
Not sure which ones, but wasn't my intention at all
Just talking about a topic that interests me
Not really I am not here to win or lose anything
Fair enough
Why
I could pick not to say anything and it wouldn't change a thing
So the chances for it to be gone anytime now are close to nil
And institutions are getting in on right now
The truth is that it's expanding no matter how much criticism it faces
The thing is, it is not going to disappear even if you shittalk it
I am not "standing up" for anything, just pointing out things that I see as incorrect
Not cryptocurrency or blockchain
My domain is software engineering
Not really, because I do not need crypto at all for income
And my source of income can be any software
The technology is not going to vanish
It is completely irrelevant to me whether everyone here touches crypto or not
What do I have to gain exactly from defending it, whether I do or not does not change my current position
Because that's going to be done, has always been done, will continue to be done, irregardless of technology
If people sell some digital stamps using the underlying technology does not change my views on the technology
I see decentralisation as a desirable goal
Yes, I can understand the link being done
If you are uninvolved you may do the opposite, too
Everyone is subjective depending on their personal life
It even took more than half a year for BTC to recover its hashrate after China ban
Most of crypto is now moved through PoS protocols that do not require intensive mining
I truly believe so, think of it whatever you want
There's a huge political side to it with US-China-Taiwan
It's just a convenient scapegoat
Chip shortage has a much bigger history than crypto
But I already largely discussed about that before here
All of which are wrong
Luddism is not gonna stop corporations from doing their thing
Just hopping on the next train for a quick buck
There is no virtual difference between what corporations do now from what they've been doing without using it
A supposed financial system should be quite bigger than a single company for it to be as relevant enough as people are painting crypto to currently be
Both people in favour and against are blowing it up out of proportion to make a stronger case for themselves
And the entirety of assets has less volume that just the classic stocks trading in the US alone
The entirety of crypto has less market cap than Apple
Quite overstated
It's glaringly obvious
In general the coverage of the technology is so slanted towards one agenda so heavily it's not even funny
Yes, they are
Because it sells more
News are sensationalist by default
The term clickbait is a thing
What
That is your impression as an external actor not involved with the technology or development aspects of it through sensationalist news
You are heavily loading your sentence there with "currently being used mostly to swindle people", from my point of view this is not true
Ah, also previously I was just stating what I've personally witnessed in regards of the outcome for people investing on it, not saying it's the rule of thumb, just that my personal experience differs there
I disagree pretty much about everything: there is simply no traditional investment that will ever give me the return I got this year on crypto, nor I think it's worse than stocks nor a Ponzi scheme
So just by being part of the society and paying your due you are already helping
We have a lot of social programs here that are paid for by taxes only
If you do a donation to a small animal shelter for instance it's quite more helpful to them than most things you could do
Plus here we pay taxes for social security, so got that covered too
I feel it's more effective than bonds
If I want to benefit a community I would rather donate
However you can use crypto to trade value, operate contracts without needing a specific company
On the current economical system
Companies benefit from everything
They are invested on the technology because it's profitable to them
Crypto is not a single entity with an agenda behind
Value is mostly inflated by leveraged trading
But there is no value there other than being part of it
You could make the case for DAO tokens, which also give voting rights within an organisation
They being treated as stocks do not make them stocks
You are just buying something with utility
You are not supporting any company or any product when you buy one of the network coins
When you have pieces of technology like trustless automated contracts
Yet that's just a tiny part of it
So it's as decentralised as possible
The design is supposed to incentivise as much people as possible to run the network
You are buying and selling a token that allows you to utilise a decentralised network, since there is no central authority over decentralised networks price is not decided by anyone
Because they are not stocks
Same thing applies here, you buy the gas coin to realise transactions on the chain or transfer value, the speculative part is on top of it through people riding the hype and not inherent to the technology itself
stock values are not directly related to the company performance or real world value at all
the main difference between crypto asset trading and traditional stock trading is that crypto does not close and there's no out of hours trading tricks
or well just tradfi futures trading which allows for them, internally, to play with more stocks than a company has
I still have 2008 fresh in my mind
I disagree when they run those schemes themselves
I think that big traditional finance players being openly against it is testament to them having less control over it than they would like
By migrating later you ensure that the network is not hijacked and centralised by big players wanting to abuse it and the proper energy consumption when it gets big enough
Because when it's new anyone can run a node easily at a low cost
It is simply easier for a new protocol to be decentralised if it starts as Proof of Work
Eth foundation had always planned to move to Proof of Stake
Of course that does not avoid capitalists to take advantage of it
All of this technology has been designed and spearheaded by people who wish to provide decentralisation for the masses
So, in later stages, it's actually better for the smaller players
PoS also makes it easier for smaller players to group up and run a node than PoW
He was given Shiba worth millions and he just immediately gave it to an India foundation for Covid victims
Ethereum is not run by capitalists, though, you have Vitalik there who is a neurodivergent engineer that just wishes for decentralisation
It needs to migrate for energy consumption
Only works out in early stages
PoW is virtually the same since the rising cost of mining makes it so the initial investment to mine has to be very big to be worth it, so no change in that regard
But you do have a point
The steps for migration were taken this year already though
Solana is carrying a lot of art NFT volume and it's not PoW
Should migrate within the year
While possibilities are endless and bright, reality is often disappointing
That's true for anything really
I have a game on Steam and it's not the same. Environmental cost is not extra if you just use any of the multiple PoS networks (most of them) that have the same cost as regular game servers
game wise there are a lot of possibilities though, not only cross game items or free (as in freedom) item ownership and exchange
yep, accepting an item from an external game is an opt-in feature really
since you can do trustless exchanges of assets without the need for the game publishers to do anything
you could also trade items from game A for items of game B or otherwise, that would also be quite interesting
yes, there's always going to be the work to adapt it
Just like you have collabos in gachas which is pretty cool you could get something similar by using one game artifact into another
And they do not need additional infrastructure to their own, just the design aspect
and while cross-game items posses a challenge it would be very interesting to see how companies manage and implement this with purpose
Technically you own just the item, not the stats or what it does, so I think it should be legally fine for the game company to change an item
The good thing about reusing extended ERC721 is that you have a very well understood standard without competing standards that's implemented in several decentralised systems of different kinds
it's only scarce with an arbitrary limitation
and since the items are created in game it's not digital scarcity
yes but it is limited to the game itself
you can trade them or just give it to other people easily
it's interesting to be able to take ownership of the items out of the game
Not undo but prevent
Not really, it's excess energy that was not going to be used
Well to get my crypto money you need to get access to 2 devices of mine, that's already more secure than my bank account
There's more options, actually, than in traditional finance
You can do the same in crypto
They can be reused anyway
That's something I have never lived here lol
so much for ownership
The reality is that I never saw my phone again
Yes and if my phone gets stolen I can call the police
Just like it's not the bank fault you give access to who you shouldn't
That's not on the technology, though
Just like old people get phishing mails to empty their bank accounts
Scams are nothing new: phishing attacks, malware
You can interact directly with the chain, but yes, UX and security is a main concern
Ownership of a physical good will always ultimately be enforced by might
And that's already a reality
And that's becoming more and more common
Yes but you can do this without any 3rd party if both assets are digital
The point is that, as long as you can use a certificate for a legal contract, the exchange can be done and proved
Right now, yes
The point is that you can use the chain to trustlessly exchange the ownership document
It's already being implemented and even tested by shipping companies, for instance
yes, NFTs are that, not art
Ownership is deterministically probable
Which is one of the things being worked on currently on blockchain
Sure, can trustlessly trade currency for a tokenised property ownership certificate
When both parties sign, the exchange happens automatically
That program exists for as long as the blockchain does, no one can change it or tamper with it
That's one of the huge points of programmable blockchains
and it's probable
The program does it
That's the point
No, they do not
So two anonymous people can exchange two assets without needing anything but the network to exist, which cannot be tampered with
For example, I have written a system that two people can use to trade a blockchain asset between themselves, they do not need anyone to mediate, it runs by itself without me touching a server, I cannot change it nor dispose of it
Like, that's the whole point of Ethereum
It is perfectly capable
A bank is a private entity run by rich people gets to decide if you merit a mortgage to own a place you can live under a huge interest, short of the state providing housing which is not going to happen, I think we can do better
Trustless as in you don't need a third party to enforce it
Traditional banking has proven over and over that is unreliable and dangerous
That's a tiny subset
Crypto is not only for financial utility
Traditional banking is not capable of trustless contract enforcement
I personally only use Discord and buy clothes only when strictly necessary and never fast fashion brands, I consider those things quite more harmful
That will be different for other people, though
For instance, I personally see some good uses to the technology, while I see nothing on tiktok but a huge resource wastage
Who decides what is good to keep and what is not
Clothing, social media, entertainment
That does include a wide array of things, though
So I do not want to partake in that
While they get no access to the company value while working for the company
Stocks actually can have a direct effect on the future of a company and affect their workers
It is not cost effective by any means, it is also overblown
Besides most options being in PoS, the energy consumption of PoW is calculated in quite... amusing ways, like averaging all hashrate from China as coming from coal when most of it came from hydroelectric sources, this hashrate calculated also quite liberally
Not on the literal construction but the financial and institutional aspect
I still feel the best option is to eliminate the human component and automate it in a way that cannot be used maliciously
it never did
Yes, we do need new infrastructure
You still have individuals in power that can be swayed or corrupted
Keynesianism is just an ointment on a fatal wound
There was little if anything you could do for economy to go bad
Most people in working capacity, need to build infrastructure and industry throughout a continent
Post war era economic "miracle" was having had 3% of the world population mostly working class killed and an entire continent to rebuild
Since 29s crash
There's been several
90s had a bubble and economic downturn too
You are assuming that voting has any meaningful effect or that you can stop deregulation
I would very much like an alternative
The option right now is just to trust the same banking entities and politicians that led everyone to the 2008 situation
Regulation can be ignored or even worse can be made in favour of banks and corporations
And that's the ideal I think we should strive for
With a system put in place that programmatically avoids it, that can be checked by anyone freely, that cannot be tampered with, you don't need the regulation in the first place
and continue to do so
They did prior to 2008
They keep violating it
Regulation didn't stop banks and financial institutions
For starters the whole setup for the housing market makes the prices to be inflated
Just like regulation can be quite effective, it can also work against us
there is no too big to fail
No because automated systems cannot wait for the government to rescue them
They aren't, but if they are public they can be checked by anyone
The assets were passed through analysis algorithms and proven to be risky that way
I don't need a bank to get a loan
Right now I can do finance in an automated way without touching a bank
Current banking is opaque, running by rich people with politician friends
So it is open to control and scrutiny by anyone
Automation on a public decentralised system means anyone can see what it is doing and how
You cannot do the subprime scam if the automated contract can verify
Banks have centralised actors with total control that can be malicious, if you automate all that banks do they cannot pull the same plays again
Algorithmically stablecoins are token assets that have a stable value pegged to a real world asset
it's not a good tech nor a store of value nor anything but a hot pile of trash
doge is a meme that got out of hand because a rich imbecile wished it
To a token designed to keep the same value through an algorithm
You are mixing doge being a btc fork with stable emissions
doge is not a stablecoin
no
Good for you it destroyed my home country
That's a shitcoin, not a stablecoin
I can have my savings on an automated contract that only allows me to withdraw it signing from two different private keys and time gated if I wish so
Algorithmically stable coins never change value
We really had a big issue with traditional finance actually not being that safe not so many years ago that destroyed the world economy up until today
Not entirely
or the bank going under
You just need a recession, inflation
It's not an everyday event but it does happen often
Excess energy not used being redirected to that
It used to be run mostly in hydroelectrical plants, though
Half a year ago
China banned crypto mining
Yes, but banks have little liquidity and you can see yourself unable to withdraw or use your funds
September has been red every single month of its history
There's also historical price action and real world events such as end of year (counting assets for taxes), april (fiscal year in many countries)
By those I knew price was dumping this month when it did
There are other more advanced metrics like exchange order books and trading volume
Good news for the tech, price goes up, bad news for it, price goes down.
Line green, people buy, line red, people sell.
There are two main metrics
It's highly moved by sentiment
It's not that big really
The actual market cap of crypto is tiny
People like Elon is why I would prefer the technology to lay down in those spheres until it's more advanced and widely adopted, but nothing that can be done now
If the manipulation is proven
Technically he is committing a crime there
It's considered a security
Well actually the US regulates crypto strictly
It's kinda easy to see what's going to do
Price varies, but except cases such as Elon manipulating the market for which he should go to prison
Now there's been the whole China bans and Chinese nationals have to sell their btc off exchanges
When Tesla stopped accepting btc
There was such a crash in May
I expected it already and it is just not dropping even though it should
lowest range I can see anytime soon is 30k
no, we are not going to see 10k again
I have a fairly good idea
it is not stable
it was also 30k even earlier
inflation is over 6% right now
and tell me if it was better to hold btc or usd/eur
Zoom out one year
Keynesianism wouldn't even work that well this time around simply because of the current population distribution
other countries were more unlucky losing value dramatically
JPY did quite a number to me on just a year and half and it's the currency of the top 4th economy
I am pretty sure that holding btc is going to be mid term safer
it can get quite tough here post corona
and the policies taking place are going to make inflation soar
the EUR is in a serious downfall lately
Personally not sure a country using it as legal tender right now is a good idea
This year: Institutions in, private finance in, leverage trading being regulated. All of this adds stability to it. Whether it's good or bad it's yet to see
it is simply not happening now
and as much as I would prefer for crypto to do a -90% drop and for everyone to forget about it for 3 years again so I could develop in peace
overtime it's been more stable than a load of fiat currencies though
on the realised design it would be
as the go to currency
anyway, if developing countries stop using the USD
EUR has fallen to 1.1 USD
at the current inflation rate
what if the USD losses its place as world currency, though
but then they can do that anyway already
I mean, I guess given enough power a government like the US could take over the entire network
We haven't seen such decentralised organisations as proposed
But that is simply not possible once the system is in place
In a completely decentralised system all actors can take part of it, so the now pretty much powerless masses could have potentially more decision making power
Ideally, the state would provide you housing paid by for taxes; next best option is the management of mortgages is automated
(well maybe the literal construction eventually too)
Spain applied measures to limit amount of people and curfew again
sorry to read that, all the best
oh boy do I have news about west germany for you, place was ridden with former nazis in political power lol
The main hostility to foreigners is that they are unable to speak proper English at all, you can go and live there pretty nicely. Some old man in Osaka told me "hey cool beard!"
for reference I used to frequent Gdynia and Gdansk
Must have met the few that do
Don't people in Poland consider part of Ukraine rightfully polish
I don't see much of a difference
Being proud of your nation and its history is nationalistic
Nationalism is simply strong identification of one's nation and putting its interests over everyone else
I am always in for bashing the UK
I would argue Poland is very nationalistic
They'll hide those under the rug and just put them on another position where they cannot be caught saying their bullshit in public
Japan politics are still full of nepotism, though
The LDP is going for a lukewarm position because they know and understand the world has changed even if they have not
Some of them have been forced to resign the last years due to their too extreme views
And if institutions were actually so bad it would have an effect on population
It's unfair to put the country as it was put here
Local institutions which hold a lot of power actually are quite different
Yeah, this is exactly it
Read chat history, there were generalisations about the country
Japan is ____
As I say, one news outlet takes a single instance and makes a full article about it
Deniers are just far right boomers really
Education is bad there lol
Yeah
All sensationalist articles either putting it in a too good light or too bad light
The way the western media treats Japan is disgusting
It has its problems and it is by no means a perfect country, it is still unfair to make sweeping, broad generalisations about it and its people from an external point of view
In fact, they idolise the west too much from a naive point of view in my opinion
What you find in the streets in Japan is quite different from actual nationalist countries, people are apathetic about the nation, young people say it's done for, there is not a single flag waved or in display, everyone idolises the west or Korea pop culture
Belgium had black people in _zoos_ in the 20th century still and you cannot really learn about that unless you find it by yourself
They also have national associations on the opposite direction
A subset of right wing politicians do
It's not like the UK teaches in their schools about their India genocide
They tell an embellished national history just like the rest of the countries do
You are judging an entire country based on a bunch of old rich men in power
There is no strong nationalism within
The nation is apathetic
The institutions there are bad as I already pointed out, but they are not any worse than most of the rest of the world
My first response was about Japan as a whole, since the original comment was about Japan as a whole
Immigration bureau in Tokyo sucks though
And, if anything, local governments were more useful and helpful to me than any has ever been on my own country lol
Government has been at an all time low approval levels for a while now and it just takes a few years more of boomers dying for it to be gone
Lawmaking being passed to allow for same couple legal unions while homophobia not only decreases but rises in eastern Europe
While still lacking rights due to the old men only government ™️ an lgtb person finds more acceptance right now in Japan than in half of Europe
And that is only true for the most progressive countries
A government picked by a minority does not reflect what the citizenship is like
Well and a newish populist left wing party gaining acceptance but I expect nothing from those
While our options around the west are becoming extreme right, even more extreme right and literal nazis
At least it has a somewhat functioning and popular communist party
I can pick any eastern European nation and they will be an order of magnitude more nationalistic lol
If anything it is right now less nationalist for the average person than most of the western world
Well having lived there and having family there I just think the negative aspects are overblown as much as the positive aspects depending on your western aligned political views
One thing I can say for sure is that police are racist cunts but that's also not a Japan only problem lmao
For instance I cared more about and thought more of the treatment of Chinese/Korean minorities than my wife, who is half-Chinese and says there's never been problems at all for her lol
Overall it's just another country with good and bad things with a boomer problem and its own culture
And of course there's the fact that we tend to put our western points of view above them as better and superior which is just another form of cultural imperialism
Working there sucks ass, but it's more due to societal norms than the stereotyped overtime
This take is pretty unfair to the actual young population living there that overall do not fit this. It is neither a paradise nor as bad.
Even current useless government is pacifist and most of it against getting back an army rather than the current agreement of self-defence forces
Cannot tolerate shame from external world lol
Japan would've just executed them all by themselves
but they are the exception
The notion that it doesn't comes from taking extreme right wing propagandists and making them seem like the norm
but it does

wwii was a struggle of powerful nations to get more power, no one actually gave a shit about genocide
and hiding their crimes
Well the US was directly employing nazis as scientists, engineers, etc.
it was all a farce
Justice ministry had more nazis on west germany at some point than in actual nazi germany
this is including people who took part on broken crystal night
over half of top lawyers and judges on west Germany were former nazis up until the 70s
Bar that, they were everywhere
Because the country had been invaded, divided between superpowers and controlled
Cue the old lady saying she was glad Thatcher was dead on live TV
It is a big mystery to me why would someone want to be US nationalist especially out of the US
too bad they litter everything
lol
Where you are born is pure chance but people find meaning on it
Thus patriotism
Well we are tribal animals looking for pertaining to a group deep inside
The beaches there are nice for central-northern Europe
There is no moral consumption
Everything is a grift under capitalism
Finding excuse for imperialism on the past or even the divine
The fascination with a supposed glorious national past and its revival is very present on all dictatorships
He got very cozy with the Catholic Church
He went very far away from that path
yeah and North Korea calls itself Democratic
that's a base of fascism and goes directly against socialism
idk man Mussolini believed in class separation
they knew
lol
Highways were planned under Weimar and cheap car schemes were scams that only benefited nazi party members
man they didn't even fact check
and I always though the early 30s time article was the man of the year one
I have very little trust on media in general, though
I was thinking of the more older article about him
this is true, yeah
1933
They did several covers with Hitler tho
that's less ominous than that
hmmm there is another circulating cover
My bad, read some other American article from the time endorsing him for his work on improving Germany
At least East Germany tried hard to get rid of all of them
This was seen as acceptable by the allies because someone with experience has to run it
Also West Germany up to the 70s had also nazis on most the interior ministry too, not only justice, including people who worked with Himmler, same case applied to other minisitries
he was advertised as good in the US for a while
yeah
But he was painted in a good light in there
Hitler person of the year for Time
Ford was quite the nazi fanboy, too
if it were only one...
lmao yes
antivaxx are nutjobs ignore them
just have to keep a close eye to the conditions and symptoms
yes!
yep, pfizer 2 shots
My dad has bad lungs and passed it recently with no problems, if they are vaccinated for now I think it should be fine
also maintenance harder and more expensive
just do high speed trains it's not that hard
so much
I hate hyperloop and its fans
people so stupid making and buying fake receipts for art they do not own
yeah nft is just a digital receipt
if/when it's regularised it will be a felony lol or we the equivalent is
it's akin to forging contracts
those hold no validity it's theft
so it becomes easier to convert in my head
I support moving to a ten thousands system rather than thousands

imagine just, like, putting more resources so the healthcare workers are better paid and less overworked
after 2 years
it is baffling how in many countries hospitals are still understaffed and lacking resources
they get either nuked or absorbed in
and it's more and more impossible for an external agent to get in and perform change
it cannot work out due to corporations owning the parties themselves
liberal democracy is done for

there is only so much rail you can put out to ""compete"" it makes no sense whatsoever
Even the most free market lover must admit it makes no sense for such thing as trains
Isn't rail being re-nationalised now in the UK? Since privatisation made it ineffective and costly
They started ruling out medieval style stamps (hanko) now and only due to corona and stay at home policies lol

https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption#assumptions

This is anything but scientific. There is no reliable source, no datasets, nothing. It's all speculative. It's tying guessed miner income to a guessed electricity cost and then extrapolated, so basically it is mixing entirely different datapoints to derive the data they want, classic statistical manipulation. They even admit on their own page it's just an assumption, as thus it should not be used as proof or be cited as a reliable source. Hashrate was halved earlier in 2021 and didn't return to the same rate until Decemeber, this alone breaks a model calculated on constant growing consumption. This hashrate is also a derived number since it's actually impossible to be known, so we are now deriving calculations from a derived guessed calculation.

This is from the only paper they cite as a source for their metholodgy:
```Trying to measure the electricity consumed by the Bitcoin mining machines producing all those hash calculations remains a challenge to date. Even though we can easily estimate the total computational power of the Bitcoin network, it provides only little information on the underlying machines and their respective power use. A hashrate of 14 terahashes per second can either come from a single Antminer S9 running on just 1,372 W, or more than half a million Playstation-3 devices running on 40 MW (as a single Playstation-3 device has a hashrate of 21 megahashes per second and a power use of 60 W). It is also not possible to observe the exact number of connected devices. The Bitcoin network is estimated to have around 10,000 connected nodes, but a single node in the network can represent either one or many machines.```

This paper from which the numbers are guessed is making the guesses from obsolete, less efficient miners, too, as the most efficient cited is Antminer S9. This means that the numbers from 2021 are guessed from the average guessed mining rewards which then is correlated which average mining cost from an average of mining rigs that are now years old and outdated.
So I guess it worked for some as entertainment
The thing is, whether it is atrocious or not is highly subjective, while I heavily disliked Hobbit movies I know a lot of people who thoroughly enjoyed them
Anything else is just a derivative reimagination by unrelated people
The author is dead and there is no more original work
On one side you can have nazi nutjobs posting conspiracy theories on a website and on the other side a nazi aligned government controlling allowed speech to suppress political opponents and news and communication about their wrongdoings
Companies like Twitter should most likely be treated as media outlets
The moment the government decides what can get published, it also decides what cannot
Those powers in place are the ones that allow for authoritarian fascist governments to rise
I don't really think speech or art should be limited by governments really, too an easy slippery slope
poor guy
he just wanted to play his own tune
Morgoth was unfairly treated and Feanor was a cunt
they feel more important if their diamonds come from slaves lol
Corona long term effects are quite quite bad, so unless omicron mutated to have none I wouldn't downplay it still
easy money on the latest fad for them
most companies selling nfts do not care nor actually use the tech
Nintendo is a company I can see doing that
They can sell ""NFTs"" like some other companies are doing, that is, glorified overly expensive pngs
Hope Kazakhstan people don't end up on a civil war
To decide that it comes to a country per country basis under the current law
Down that route there's denying healthcare for smokers and for anyone slightly fat
Because a doctor can tell you to eat less if you want your knee treated, it's just a slippery slope to deny healthcare for whatever reason is deemed unhealthy
While doing nothing
Curfew is just for the government to look like they are doing something about corona
And there's been very few countries with actual lockdowns that were not curfew based
So you are gonna keep applying a half baked measure known to not to work? It's just a political show
But that effort was for naught because in other countries or a part of the population ignored it
In some you couldn't see a soul past the curfew
Depends on the country
and people have had 2 years of this a lot of people will stop complying
Yes, my point is that with vaccination over 90% and virus mutating to milder symptoms and the death rate drastically dropping there is no sense to more lockdowns like the ones we are having of closing stuff at 11 pm
and that's just not right
Including people who need medical care
You would have to absolutely and completely isolate people
Spread of current strains is not gonna be stopped
I think it's too late for that
because the lockdowns were half baked
so basically it boils down to been locked down for 2 years and it was useless for me
All it takes is a single contact, I have spent most of my life at home for the pandemic and still got long covid
it is more likely it adapts to be not deadly and fast spreading
It's not like a corona-sars can mutate into aids overnight or whatever
Death to infection ratio has drastically fallen
Anything short of Wuhan levels of lockdown in March 2020 will not work
All it takes is a short contact
People living mostly isolated are catching it
You can live in isolation and all it takes is a single contact for enough time
It will also only work if population across the globe are vaccinated, but developing countries are struggling to get vaccines
and that's not going to happen
It will only works if absolutely no one on Earth meets no one on Earth for a month straight
What about immunosuppressed people who cannot do anything about it
As if the virus only acted by night
Lockdowns are pointless for the most part because countries apply half baked measures like closing stores earlier
You being vaccinated does not mean you cannot spread the virus, because you still can
One use masks being used a hundred times makes so they are simply useless
Most people wear masks wrong or re-use them too much
And then getting covid from someone in line
So people get corona while working but no fun allowed
Denying their own healthcare because of their own health choices
but well you can leave them there for like 10 years and come back to returns
Stocks have been decoupled from the actual economy for a while now it's only a matter of time before they tumble down I think
S&P500 not very good today
didn't read not selling until 2025

Seems even dangerous
But walking around seeing stuff no one else is seeing
Can have a handful of good uses
True
I don't like augmented reality at all, if I go outside I want to see the outside
You can have private ledger too
And, furthermore, public ledger is not the only blockchain design
Change state history, who does the change is irrelevant
Yeah, that's a personal experience bias, I also have worked on tech all my life and I have met people with different opinions
The proper equivalent would be this nuclear refuge could fail so let's not build it
We are talking about a way to avoid a problem being not enough
False equivalent
Also you keep focusing on the decentralisation of finance because it's a good strawman target against the technology
That's like saying since there's been nuclear accidents we should not pursue nuclear energy even though it's the greenest alternative right now
I know, I have worked on that
or... you can use monero-like protocols
Many DeFi protocols are not being built on top of current finance but from zero
Public ledger that has no identity attached
How is avoiding big tech data harvesting capitalist bs
Maybe you should check out other active uses it has rather than let twitter narrative form your opinions?
You are just disregarding a technology because it seems to you that a lot of people want to apply it in a way that does not apply to your worldviews without actually exploring what it can be used for ignoring what a rich kid club boys are doing, no different from what could have been said in the late 90s about www
which is something traditional systems cannot do
including purchases
it adds complete anonymous usage of the internet and untrackable personal data
The write has never used IPFS it seems
It is becoming extremely hard to think of such a world since all centralised systems pass through them
They will avoid it just like they avoid taxes
IPFS is far superior to bittorrent file sharing
Like big tech companies being able to pinpoint exactly what you buy, when, where, why
An heavily opinionated piece just from the first lines which is not addressing problems that traditional decentralisation cannot solve
It talks about NFTs because that's the only thing people who didn't spend a single minute reading about the tech know about due to the nftbros on Twitter
```Web3 aims to use the technology of blockchain and smart contracts to create a decentralized experience of the Web. In such a world, each user owns a piece of their own Internet. So, rather than having Big Tech giants like Google and Facebook follow each of your steps: Web3, and decentralization promise to keep your identity intact.```
DeFi is just an example it puts as to how you can use it to protect your information from tech giants
Can I ask for you to not to read diagonally?
It has been around for a decade and the art nft thing blew up in 2021
There is
You are too fixated on the money part while ignoring, I daresay in purpose, the part that describes what the intended use the technology is for
The article talks about other things being built on it, though?
By that process of thought anything related in any way to a scam is a scam
Good read
https://stackdiary.com/web3-scam/
The creator of BTC is yet to be known and owns a fortune in BTC that has never been moved, at all
Since the innovative ways to use it have been worked upon for years through foundations and anonymous people
In fact they have added literally nothing to it
The vultures have come recently and have been completely dettached from the actual development of the tech
No one knew nor talked about decentralised computation until DeFi boom from 2019 onwards
It was extremely hard to see anything but btc mentioned on media until recently lol
The only tech that got venture capital is from the copypaste chains that have been sprouting like mushrooms this last year
And venture capitalists didn't get into crypto until quite recently on its history
There is no visionary here, no one knows who started it
Anonymous author, public papers, entirely distributed and with the wish to not to be controlled by neither government nor corporations
BTC had even a more humble start
It started out as, basically, a foundation of nerds trying to build something
Ethereum was funded by people on crypto buying it
Also, why do you call it techwank, these are simply the terms used to describe the technology
Those corporations are getting in _now_ to get a slice of the hype pie
That's not true, though
Also more anonymous than bittorrent
This is an improvement on bittorrent for those purposes
Right now we have censorship resistant distributed file systems that require only a single node existing in the world to distribute the information
Throwing a sweet at us time to time to keep us happy
I feel you put too much faith on what I see is a corrupt supranational system full of neoliberal boomers working solely for the good of the corporations
Small startups violate gdpr all the time and they just wind it because "we are not gonna get caught"
It is not effective at all, it is nigh useless in practise
The ideal is for people to adopt it by themselves without the tech giants pushing their own version on people
Beyond btc and ethereum there's been several innovations that are not talked about much
And on larger ones anyone can spin their own node
Anyone can, yeah
and no government is going to entirely stop Google from working on their country (bar China)
When you are in the word is "it's worth to do this until caught then just pay", because, the money earned is more than any fine
it is widely known and whether it goes public they pay a ridiculous fine
They all evade taxes and farm information anyway
No, the EU is not any good
Google will not give in and the legislation is done in such a way they have total control over the information anyway
For instance, IPFS has been used to deliver files in a decentralised and secure manner between politically oppressed people, and it was extremely hard to find who was serving those, if possible at all
And it is exponentially harder to tie the information
This is the main problem but that does not mean we should give up and just cave in, information of people must be protected from tech giants and information services must be decentralised to stop their abuse over data and your economical and leisure activities
While Google has access to everything I do and puts ads everywhere without me knowing where they got me, they are unable to know what I do onchain
Sending randomised fake browser data is limited to what you browse, not what you play or purchase with accounts linked directly to Google or Facebook
The whole article tries to draw false equivalents with Ethereum mainnet to classic systems thinking it is being used for the exact same things, ignoring any other chains and that it's actually a tool within an ecosystem
```Even the most optimal storage strategy in Ethereum requires 600 gas per byte.  Yet the total network compute capacity is only 2M gas/second so storing 1 megabyte will require 300 seconds.   So not only can the Ethereum blockchain only store 3 kB of data a second, storing that 3kB costs $250!  So the cost of writing a single 3kB message to the Ethereum blockchain is the same price as a year of storage on Amazon for the entire 1 TB Ethereum blockchain.  Or the same price as buying a 1 TB M.2 SSD.```

This is also false as it is considering all Ethereum mainnet transactions are storage saves, whereas reading and deterministic compute are... entirely free of charge
It's exponentially harder to track someone
That would be if Google could track a single key to all transactions, the fact is that it is going to be jumbled amongst other transactions that are linked to it but not related to the person plus a person is going to have several different keys being used
That's how companies currently developing applications for blockchain work, they do not give crypto to all developers
I can spin up a local blockchain that works as any existing blockchain and test how the decentralised system would work on a real blockchain without having to own a cryptocurrency or even a way to access web3
```So in the end web3 is a con job, a technological edifice that is beyond useless as anyone who attempts to deploy a real application will quickly discover.  It is, however, an amazingly effective form of Nerd Sniping.```

There's already applications running on decentralised systems without the need to host the server data serving on a centralised big tech server
```After all, a programmer doing the most basic test of a web3 prototype is going to need to get the cryptocurrency, spend the cryptocurrency, and any application will require all users to get the cryptocurrency as well.  If this gets abandoned quickly due to the inevitable technical failure “web3” still accomplished its goal of getting more suckers in and extracting their money.```

This is false, every single chain has a free to use testchain, you can also set up a local development environment that requires absolutely nothing but your own PC
Pretty common practise on "opinion" articles which are more closer to "preach" than to give an "opinion"
This entire opinion piece is extremely slanted without stopping to consider anything but to prove the preconceived opinion. It plants negative connotations every single time it can to move your opinion towards the author's in a pretty obvious way
A transaction that is cryptographically proven only has a single point of identification, a private key that no one knows by whom it is being held, if you add mixing that in the public ledger in a deterministic probable way you also hide who did the transaction
That have browser fingerprint, connection information, plain text information
Google searches are plain data
It is not, read the paper
Leveraging the opinion of someone just because of their position without actually understanding the underlying conditions does not necessarily lead to a correct conclusion
Private as in you cannot derive the personal data
You are trying to leverage your acquaintances opinions without us knowing what those opinions are or why
Yes, but I am not using my position as an engineer to defend it, I am merely stating what the technology is and what it can be used for
Monero is a low energy cost, private transaction network
More info here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/
Private ledger is not a centralised ledger
Does not work that way
Just like you do not know who owns a house just because there's a lock
Yes but you would have to find that person with that personal private key
Ever heard of fallacy of authority
The point is that the person doing the transaction is anonymous, the change itself is secured by the private key
What
If big money abandons the market mining will become easier as well
Just like eth classic is ran by people who don't like ethereum foundation and the forking they do on the chain and keep it alive
Back in 2010 it was run mostly by tech nerds with little incentive
We've been there
That is not true
Everything else is a derivative use
You trade it for transactions on the chain
Also back to this, the inherent value bit is technically incorrect:
* In most cases, value of the currency is value of using the network, you are valuing the network usage.
* In some other cases, value of the currency is tied to the value of the blockchain service itself, commonly seen in file storage chains.
* This means that there are several chains whose coin does not see parabolic runs, such as ChainLink (tech to link blockchain data to other blockchains) or IPFS (censorship resistant decentralised file system)
It exists in a pre-programmed automated and deterministic manner
There is no manager like other fiat currencies
As long as a single person runs a node
Everyone can use Eth classic and the rate is forever the same
It's like a country changing currencies
The old one does not stop existing as a separate identity
That's why bitcoin and Ethereum have classic, pre fork versions
Doge still has a fixed rate, doing a new chain with a new name and ""migrating"" it is just a new currency
You can fixate on it or go further and see the benefits of decentralisation
That's just but an aspect of the technology
That's what you believe it is
Simply because self organised cooperative groups cannot actually acquire, manage, and produce everything a societal group needs
And most of them find it desirable to exist as a quantitative unit
As such, currency has been explored under different anarchist and marxist authors
The implementation of a system needs a laid out written down work before it can actually be implemented
Theory is important after all
I am speaking from the anarchist literature groundwork
Marx and Engels also "played" stocks, citing it is desirable to relieve the enemy of their own money through their own means
As a means to transport value they are desirable in any society large enough
They are against currency in a qualitative form
Well he also considered revolutions need not to be violent and I heavily disagree on this aspect
Bakunin considered Marxism oppressive
Anarchism is opposed to Marxism
Currency can be adapted as a quantitative unit rather than qualitative
Because a cooperative group will still have needs they cannot acquire within the group itself
It also allows for groups to trade with other groups
That was true until about 2015
Original blockchain communities were basically anarchists and tech nerds
The original conception was precisely to find a way for decentralization and liberation
Anarchists still have trade
Fiat value is backed by the power of a state
That depends on the branch of anarchism
This is not the case for a cryptocurrency, it has a set rate and no one can change that ever
Yes, fiat is controlled by nations and can be inflated or deflated at the will of the issuing power
It's just a convenient way to translate value across objects
Even a pure marxist accepts currency as part of economical system
Currency exists in most economical systems
Sorry but this is laughable, currency is not a capitalist thing
Their value is overinflated by speculative actors and this will disappear when it grows and the gas coins will be used merely as means to execute transactions
Or the currency phenomenon with the actual use of the chains
You are still intent on mixing decentralisation with capitalism
I think this is a defeatist take
Moreso in proof of stake protocols
A lot of largescale mining operations are cooperatives
And you could get blocked, your paypal account lost
It was extremely hard for the non savvy to acquire or use btc until 2016-2017
and will continue to be pinned as the currency for evildoers
That is why Monero is barely available on centralised exchanges
They hated not being involved
That's why you have The Economist articles saying btc is only for buying drugs
And we did have it until recently
Visa, mastercard, paypal were trying to block usage of crypto
So this is kickstarted by a person who wishes to not to be known, and who hasn't sold a single btc despite those making them extremely wealthy, should they sell it
it's going to be hilarious when they are not even selling the actual rights to the image
It also encourages people to team up, since you can actually run a staked node amongst a group of people
You can make it so it's irrelevant past the staking point, the stake just has to be enough for you to not to want to compromise the network and for others to want to keep it healthy
so the idea is be able to launch a network as PoW, let it grow decentralised, then turn it PoS
most networks on Amazon are PoS
The main problem with it is achieving true decentralisation
Proof of Stake is a protocol that consumes much less energy that proof of work, the ones used currently by Bitcoin and Ethereum
This is important because whereas monetary transaction only chains can be done as PoW with small energy usage as demonstrated by Monero, it is not proven to be possible with decentralised computing yet
This year the eth merge is done in a couple of months and we will see what it leads to, scaling by groups staking together and clustering nodes for consensus seems to be both a good way to keep a network decentralised and to keep it as energy usage friendly as possible
PoW is infamous but it is also the most decentralised and out of control of tech companies like Amazon
The chains depends on a lot of technical details, such as block size and time and how the consensus is reached
NFT is just a record on a chain, by itself it has very, very small requirements
At least it's not the entire network running on AWS, just part of it
AWS is just very convenient for node runners, which defeats the purpose (of having a decentralised network)
Not necessarily, in fact it is undesirable that many are on AWS
or you can run it without fear of aws or google censoring your service for whatever reason they deem
There is no "we are losing money, servers closed"
Yeah but you have it on a decentralised way that requires no one specific to keep it up and going and can be queried from anywhere in the world
just a grift
if you cannot actually own it and trade it anywhere else it's not an nft
so a gacha game but with a different more techie branding <:notlikethis:592813126009880578>
Those are most likely going to sell an overpriced png and call it an NFT
People will try to put value on anything, there are the most stupid derivatives on markets
And I hope they fail doing what they are currently doing, it's no different from dlcs or other forms of micro transactions
I would prefer if they used other classical means though
Since they all have become rich through unethical means I couldn't care less if they scam eachother
It is out of reach for the average person
You have rich celebrities buying in, you do not pump the price to $500k for suckers
for the most part the avatar picture nfts are used as a wealthy club thing
or well a set of individuals
that's the actions of an individual
yes, some have done that to make people think their shitty monkeys are worth more
Art NFTs are illiquid, anyone convincing you they have intrinsic monetary value is lying
It is mostly a vanity thing
vanity knows no bounds
they are basically trading digital receipts to ugly art for high amounts of money between themselves
something that exists whether there's blockchain or not
the monkey pngs is just rich kids club
but yes
Right now its best usecase is for onchain digital assets
stock market is a means to an end while crypto market is a side effect
NFT by itself is just a proof of ownership
Art NFTs*
To no avail
The stock market is heavily regulated
And, as for comparing it to stock market, stock market is heavily manipulated through insider information and politician-corporation connections (the American congress has a lot of apparently expert traders who have heavily outperformed the market :^)), has off hours trading since the market closes that affect the prices in ways that you cannot foresee, power is centralised to brokers and banks that play the market to their advantage and to the detriment of the everyday person, which leads to stocks going up while real economy goes down; crypto currencies are actually heavily tied to their network usage and what do they offer, most actual usecase chains do not see parabolic pump and dump schemes like copypaste flavour of the month corpo shitchain sees
This includes nftbros
Most people talking about it nowadays had no idea about it or what it is other than having heard about bitcoin a couple of times prior to 2019
Your entire premises is that crypto somehow started post 2016 bull run
Who do not even understand the technology or what it is for anyway
You will just not see the nft crypto bros spamming twitter with their shit
That's also false because crypto started as a quest for decentralisation and all of that is the reason it exists in the first place
And price will follow suit
different chains use different strategies for this, which is why a lot of new ones are popping up lately as the best fit is trying to be found
since they are meant to be to operate outside of Ethereum and then just roll up the new state on ethereum
it's also not a lot of money really, transactions are just very cheap on those solutions
faucets are rate limited
On some of them each operation costs 0.000001$
They give you free money for transfers that amounts to less than $1 because operations on L2 and sidechains are extremely cheap
The same wallet operates on most chains, actually
Anyone can create any wallet anywhere for free
it's a common case
no, it's not
For instance on Polygon (a sidechain solution with upcoming zero knowledge rollup), the free Matic they give you once allows you to move assets thousands of times
you only need to acquire gas coin for complex operations or trading
This is standard in L2 and sidechains
Cheap chains provide gas through a faucet so you can move around your tokens
Not necessarily
Different kind of chains are necessary because there is no all fits one solution, just like with regular web servers
That depends, L2 chains operate under the same gas coin as L1, sidechains operate with their own, cheap coin
Companies spinning their own chain is quite stupid, though
You actually can operate between chains
It is possible, just not very easy and certainly not within the reach of the usual monkey nft creators
These guys are bayc affiliated though so I do not trust them at all
So the program receives the payment, it sends it to the parties, and then updates the ownership state
Last iterations of the standard allow for the contract that holds the NFTs itself (think of it as a ledger that knows what key owns what product) to accept payments for transaction within the contract itself and for that payment to have complex fractional royalties
Currently basic NFT implementations have the pay and royalty aspect leveraged to the sale/buy contract that usually specifies amount of royalty and receiver
I guess having an actual company with a user term agreement that the NFT represents the rights for the use of that property could be given a case
You can always trade over the counter
Royalty payments are on the current specification
Depends on the implementation, but it is very well possible, yes
It's mid tier blockchain programming at best
You just need the NFT smart contract and the contract that handles royalties to properly send the money to the VA
It's not so hard though
I am wary of any grassroots project doing it right, though
for the VA
if you can automate it in a way that the VA always gets on their account their due it will be superior to current model
and royalty payments are often skimmed or cheated
right now you pay to a company where a group of people decides who gets what
no
Technically if well implemented each subsequent use would pay royalties automatically to the VA and no one could change that ever
but yeah I eyed the twitter / project and I think it's bullshit anyway
I think the approach here is you pay royalties once to produce all you want and then you pay royalties again when transferring ownership to another person that will use the same voice
good thing is that all chains use the exact same interfaces
they can be used to streamline royalty payments in an automated way within contained systems implementing them
if anyone says that they are either lying or just ignorant
NFTs are not to solve piracy
under Tang iirc
There were bank notes in an early China kingdom, too
nation states are a very new concept
well national is kinda not the same term
There are older currencies that could be considered national
Like, very big
Big underwater volcano eruption
Hopefully my gaming gpu is not seized by the state, I only use it to play games
When you have no argument at all it's easy to take the ad hominem way after all
not like the balkan states need much of an excuse to go war with eachother lmao
It's not very good to have only a couple of places manufacturing what may very well be the most important piece of technology on modern times
Interesting you call yourself a liberal when you only talk about forbidding and controlling people huh
Chips have had a chokepoint on factories for long and the several incidents didn't help
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-chips-idUSKBN2BN27E
Which handle a huge percentage of worldwide chips for cars
And then there is the Japan accidents

Feb 2021 storm closed chip factory plants in Texas delaying chip manufacturing for several months
https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21457350/us-tightens-trade-restrictions-china-chipmaker-smic
That means they turned to Taiwan based TSMC, which was already at top capacity
And, due to the ongoing trade war, the US imposed restrictions on China's SMIC, that makes it harder for them to sell chips to American companies
https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/made-on-earth/how-the-microchip-powered-pandemic-life.html
Chip scarcity is due to several factors starting with Covid, remote work and learning shot up demand for chips while factories shut down
BTC uses ASIC and Ethereum GPU mining is going to be over very, very soon. Rest of the growing crypto industry does not use GPU mining at all, so buying gpus for mining should be over sooner than later.
that's wild
but it worked... more than once?
like I would think the conman is stupid for trying that
who can believe they are actually buying those landmarks
lmao
no one's gonna buy that (I hope)
that's just someone uploading an image on opensea, it's not even traded
That's exactly why all US government aligned media is going to be bashing them nonstop
If you stop relying on the dollar and are immune to US blockades
yes
this is hardly possible, it's by all accounts one of the worst failed states
which is, in my opinion, very good
it proves there is a way to escape the grasp of imperialism
Which is the whole point
We only know that now they can use a different currency as tender that is not controlled by a centralised government
the _and_ will not be known for now
which is what I just said
...they just adopted it to escape the reliance dollar
Dude, El Salvador adopted the US dollar as legal tender in 2001
> Even so, the actual performance of El Salvador's crypto portfolio is unknown as it's not publicly available.
You basically read the news title and ignored the contents
What claim
This is before BTC buy
> In July last year, Moody's downgraded the country's credit rating to CAA1, meaning it has a very high risk of default on its loans.
Feel free to go with the American imperialist narrative though
So of course dropping the dollar like they did puts them on lock on
They were reliant on the dollar on everything
The thing is... El Salvador was already a failed state
Just like they forced countries to drop social programs or they would lose rating and have to pay more interest
Your country either abides by the rules they want or they lower your rating
Credit ratings are from extremely centralised institutions and they are used as political tools
>**Bloomberg has estimated**
Yeah do we remember 2008 and what they did with the "ratings"?
and it allows poverty striken countries whose own fiat currency is useless to move from the dollar
For now, it's still a young technology
It's losing worldwide power
Sorry, they are numbered
I haven't used my fiat bank or money in many months
And well you can do it with a card that uses crypto, there are several actually
This is already entire possible, El Salvador, a country which has been hit hard by imperialism, decided to have btc as legal tender as their own money was useless
And cryptocurrency is helping to end it
Days of the dollar are counted
Because they had economical interests on accepting Greece's claims back then
Or is it more likely the UE knew and just put a blind eye
And... do you think Greece lying is entirely their own fault? So the UE is so useless they couldn't even notice that?
And southwestern Europe would be better off either on their own or on their own cooperative supranational organisation
People in other countries have had a vastly different experience with the UE
But that's your experience
If you think your country is better off like that, that's great
The UE is a Germany-France playground and the money gifts are poisoned with debt and servitude
Means you have nothing but services that the UE wants you to have
Because other countries need to sell their fish at better prices
Or your primary production also lowered
Because no one dare compete with Germany
And having had your industry dismantled
The thing about not having monetary sovereignty is that in cases such as 2008 you are just fucked
Also Ireland
Portugal, Spain, Italy
Southern Europe disagrees
Options are becoming increasingly limited, too
And you have to pick from those
In the end you have a limited set of tools and options
It's a good tool
Decentralisation allows for smaller groups of people with similar interests to operate on their own without having to go through the centralised globalised systems
There are several non EU countries that also did very well
That's false conclusion from premise, you can have a different premise and the same conclusion
"you don't like the system don't live on it, also you cannot leave the system"
At the detriment of the working class, yes
So you have first world countries producing nothing living off of the cheap resources obtained elsewhere
It's easily extracting resources from the poor for the rich
It is having children on factories on countries not yet developed because it's cheaper
Globalization is having a small international elite dominating the world economically
You need both
yes
There's euro or jpy pr crypto/crypto equivalents
But you do not need to trade it or value it in dollars
Value of currencies is already relative to other currencies in the current system
Yes, but that's like any other currency, when the euro was first minted it had its initial value also pegged to other currencies
That's only India wishing to do their own
Honestly hope it goes well for them, not because of crypto but because countries as El Salvador need it
The main problem with all of this is using Bitcoin just because it's the oldest one, when there are much better alternatives, but well, that's expecting government officials to work well with new technology
Panama has some legislative initiatives, nothing set in stone yet
Argentina and Venezuela have seen a surge of usage
Ukraine new bill to legalize Bitcoin as asset, Cuba is regulating it for currency use, India wants to regulate it and issue their own, Indonesia PM talked about the same thing
Everyone's tired of being under the American boot
This movement is being widespread on more impoverished countries
Why is it bad they have more options
You have a desperate government with no options with their currency dominated by another sovereign state that cannot do anything if said currency inflates or deflates against their own economical conditions and they wish to try an exit from their hole
let's not build the bridge just in case keep using boats?
is it the architect's fault
what if the bridge collapses because there was a mistake on the materials bought
that's not on the technology
Interest generated from owning btc is much better than interest generated from gold
And they can use their own controlled currency backed by BTC bonds of they wish
They can stop using the dollar and what that entails
Just like they did in North Africa
Well they could always do their classic move of provoking a war in the country
Even though they barely mentioned the country at all before
Libya and Syria?
Then they will sell you movies about heroic soldiers saving democracy for poor middle easterns who cannot govern themselves without the American help
America destabilised North Africa and middle east with their constant pursue of war
Yes, soviets are not free of blame on wwii
The original point is that the cultural export sells a narrative that is meant to hide away the bad things that the nation has done or is doing while emphatising only what's good or portraying their culture as the best option
Does not mean it's always the case
Yes, but that's not the point, the point is what America and their manufacturers have been doing
India is in a cold conflict with China over their borders as well as with Pakistan
https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/20/julianborger1
ITT got money from being bombed while still producing for nazis mid war
This one includes several references
http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Salient36171973-t1-body-d15.html
American factories were still producing for the nazis
That war in those countries is engineered for the profit of the western imperialistic nations
But you don't even have to go back to the world wars to see what they do:
https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2019/12/16/arms-sales-middle-east-soar/
If you ask for citations at least read them lol
It talks about more than one place on it
and read the entire article
It also supplied people to concentration camps
it was not neutral on the conflict
Country stance was "neutral"
Spain supplied "volunteer" soldiers to the nazis
https://historyofyesterday.com/three-american-companies-that-shamelessly-supported-nazi-germany-58fe33910303
South Korea itself has a strong rising counterculture against capitalism
Not all cultural products are propaaganda
Just one of many
https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-untold-story-of-the-texaco-oil-tycoon-who-loved-fascism/
South Korean is basically an American puppet state lol
They owned share of German aircraft manufacturers and even got compensation payment because of the damages done to their European factories
ITT Inc., formerly ITT Corporation is a US based manufacturing company
Then you watch hollywood war films and you think they carried the entire burden of the war, was an immaculate country fighting for freedom and democracy
Ford got compensation from his European factories supplying nazis being bombed
The US was openly still selling things such as oil for planes for the Luftwaffe while already engaged in war against Germany
And their arms manufacturers were found to be bribing and spreading tales of imminent hostilities in prewar times to sell more weapons
America benefited greatly from both world wars
So after a generation you get kids thinking the US won wwii alone and that they were the good guys even though they were selling weapons to the nazis
Exporting Hollywood means also exporting a narrative and propaganda that makes them money
But local and other nation's culture is overshadowed simply due to lack of access
Of course, also coming from the US
There is a lot of interesting culture worldwide
Simply by economic muscle
Superpowers can impose their culture
Consuming only the media from a superpower is
Foreign media is not bad at all
Do people like KFC unironically??
Yes, America cultural imperialism must be stopped at any costs
but that doesn't rid of a myriad of problems
EU law is often better than your own nation's, there I must agree
International cooperation can be done without a supranational organisation that has power over national sovereignty
If it were a good solution for everyone this wouldn't be the case
While you have gratitude for the UE, the case for some other millions ranges from scepticism to hatred
The thing is, valued by most means more western
but anyway I do enjoy American tv series production values
Casa de Papel by the way diverges from traditional Spanish tv series production and feels more American too, this may be just me subjective perception though
To the point young people get plastic surgery to look more western
And trying to be "like the west" is seen as desirable
Western or American is seen as desirable culture
This is a bit cherry picked and one can argue K-pop while a South Korean product it is engineered to be liked overseas
I heavily dislike that
For some it is a good thing
US spearheads the globalisation of culture
Especially on this internet connected world
I think that's mostly because US culture permeates every layer of life right now
Yeah, France still produces a lot of national culture
And I wish for each country to have their own culture without it being trampled by the constant export and financial asphyxiation from a superpower
Nothing of the sort, I have a dislike from imperialistic countries
I don't really find Pew research an objective source
Using their reach to implant their culture you have a lot of Europeans who have never set foot on America thinking it's the bastion of freedom and democracy and that they have the right to police the world
If it were too obvious, it wouldn't work
That does not mean that every single cultural product is like that
The use of their culture to advance their ideals
In this case defending capitalism or making it look better on their movies is a byproduct of being the system set in place by the imperial power
Back then I still actively did
Yeah, I just stopped consuming American media for the most part
time goes by too fast
Zero Dark Thirty 2012, not recent at all lol
It implants the idea that any wrongdoing is actually from an external actor that infiltrated their armed forces and that the good military guys are there to help
And it portrayed Americans in Afghanistan in a very good light
The recent movie to catch and kill Bin Laden also gained traction
So you go with pop pieces like Marvel
Obviously, 80s style propaganda movies won't work anymore
As the mainstream sentiment has been switching to anti war, so did the movies and the way propaganda is portrayed
You got Saving Syria's Children, not American but from BBC
American cultural imperialism is nothing new
ah was gonna reference 12 Strong too
I stopped watching American movies last years, can reference famous moments like Rambo's mujahideen support, The White Helmets short film that shows how the west goes to save despite being at fault
Bush jr Iraq war was too obvious to sell as something good, no one wanted it
and the conflict has been kept alive by imperialistic powers
Syria is worse now than ever before the war
The European west has been doing America's bidding for long now, it was the United Nations who participated as whole
and a main cultural export
Which are lowkey American military complex propaganda
Yes, during a truce, as soon as they waged war they cut all trading with them and lost millions on the front to get to Berlin
It's not like genes decide who you are
Just like they decided to have you
For me it would be
also growing up and environment are more important anyway
than just sheer luck
Easier to feel proud of your parents picking what's best
It's not like any genetic talent is anything but luck
but things like older and younger usually form due to abuse
I guess it's fine if they don't hurt anyone else in the process
a hack is a good excuse as any
In this specific case I like that national productions attempt change and diverting from the tried and old
Been reading that lately
yes
idk what to feel about this, neurodivergent early life can be quite hard
makes sense, so not really a concern
my understanding is that it amounts to little personality wise
things like that, if possible, would be concerning
I have little idea about genetics outside of sci-fi flicks, would it be possible to design a baby for the person to be more prone to following orders?
Current day overbearing parents may even be against it thinking it's not good
Parents picking genes and then acting as helicopter parents are two entirely different matters
I thought gattaca was more on the side of soft than hard scifi
Is it even possible to hand pick genes like that
There is no talent without hard work and a good early environment for it
Wonder how much shit powerful states did when it was super easy to hide information
On any game
Farming gold is a slow and tedious process
That's not very cost effective
Buttpoopcoin is actually not an exaggeration
Names of currencies I have won with can be quite funny
Too bad boomercoin will still be here
If only
not realistically, no
ugh
https://www.vice.com/en/article/3abapv/lufthansa-are-flying-18000-ghost-flights-over-europe-just-to-keep-their-slots
And China knows this well
Numbers advantage means absolutely nothing against technology
can't wait to read twitter when current nft bubble pops and they are all left bagholding
yeah pretty much, digital art NFTs are so inane, too
netflix down 25% today lmao
monkey avatars miss the point so much it's hilarious
The use case is the ability to hold files forever without a central authority having control over them
What is capitalist about it exactly
This is just one use that's both non exploitative and already applied in the real world
Blockchain technology used to serve files in a decentralised manner that is free to use and that requires no crypto technology for the end user -- yet it's blockchain technology
As usual I will mention the easiest example which is IPFS
That's your individual perception that is objectively wrong
but that's beyond the point I think
Yes, and this is a legitimate concern with which I don't entirely agree
Major technology due to which society is extremely polarised, individualistic, anxious
The internet started and continues to be such a tool
That's basically it
My point was that it was too non neutral
NFTs for digital art are stupid and you don't really need a 2h video to explain that lol
See, you get it, but then you act as if it was a technology problem when it comes to blockchain
Good production and good content for a lot of its length, gotta hand it
In the end I thought it would be interesting but ends up being yet another capitalist product just made to earn money, just more elaborated than the average
This is fair
You are going to be wondering why the pushback is not working in a short while
If anything, lootboxes are more heinous
It's not adding anything new, just changing what technology is used for the very same thing
Yes, and you are a single person without power to change anything
That is why the focus on the underlying technology is missing the point and will solve nothing
and showered with money
Company will offer NFT remove them and sell exactly the same as micro transactions and then get lauded
If anything the way it is done uses NFT as a red herring not actually pushing back any predatory practices but rather enabling them
To do so on their games instead
For those companies it's refreshing what they are doing attempting to look new and trying to convince the people who are already wasting their money on jpegs
Do you even play games? It's the norm, this is just a brand name change at most
Game companies will not use Ethereum due to the costs associated so this is no more of a concern than just playing a multiplayer game
It is not new, though
NFTs are overblown both by the nft fans and those strongly against
Now, what are you actually losing should people be buying and selling stupid jpgs, say game companies implement this and sell skins or collectables that are also NFTs
Attacks also cause stronger rejection on the argument if you are not pre-inclined to agree
Because not everyone and everything moves by pure economical incentive
There's always been neutral pure informational content despite capitalism
You see that way because it convinces you since you are the target audience, and are thus more prone to believe it would do so
Yeah I just had a different idea when watching it as what I thought was purely informational
You are not going to convince anyone even mildly interested on crypto by telling them they are drug buying gambling addicts only, though
But well he is not even right about everything he states, so I guess you're right and should have taken it as pure entertainment
I think the point of gathering truthful information should be to display it in a way that it can convince people
Seems pretty puerile for the most part
I guess that depends on your goal
Ad hominems serves no purpose other than exhilaration of the user at his own righteousness
What is obviously wrong is arbitrary to one's perception
Right, I still think essays should be tone neutral or at least attempt to
nftbros don't have the brain to watch a 2h video lmao
In the end what you say is what happens the most
Loaded language and inductive fallacies to the point of non sequitur guilt by association are very good to make content that's more entertainment than informational, though, you are not going to change anyone's mind like that; it is designed to quickly garner the acceptation of the target viewers and will cause rejection from others
Would be better if he used less loaded language, the video watches as made for an audience that already agreed with him prior to watching
Meme coins being the main point of entry for retail
2021 saw this clearly
More and more BTC and Crypto are becoming detached
Doesn't matter, crypto community itself is full of people expecting other coins to overtake BTC and this narrative will overflow into the mainstream
This is also wrong, there are several already entirely decoupled from BTC price action
And the mining has little to do with the value it holds
It has done so several times, though
So maybe the goal changed
The network will go on as usual and crypto will continue existing
You were talking about the network not being resilient
They are the easier to keep track of
If you remove most miners then the difficulty goes down and then anyone can spin up a node
It is simply not possible to shut it down by force
You know, BTC consumption energy estimates are so disparaging and so difficult because it's actually impossible to know
But yeah feel free to go bomb miners, it would be actually a benefit for the blockchain tech as a whole
And this is assuming governments are just gonna let them run around bombing stuff even if it's crypto mines
That's supposing activists can run around the globe bombing facilities
Suddenly there's a huge gap in mining and people can mine at their homes again, they will
Well, bombing big miners achieves literally nothing by bombing mining sites
You will get other big miners increase their security and smaller miners taking the place of the previous old miners
If they destroy big miners they are achieving nothing but fucking with those specific miners
Whose goal
Yeah it would actually be a good thing and the chain would still be running
BTC lost half its hashing power due to China ban later this year, it meant literally nothing to actual transactions
The actual on-chain effect is irrelevant
You would just see price drop due to the news
No, it wouldn't
Simply smaller miners run the network
If you nuke the farms
Furthermore
It takes 5 minutes of googling to check decentralisation for both BTC and ETH
There are two cases there: people bombing proof of work locations, which is actually nigh impossible to achieve and, unlike you think, they are distributed amongst the globe and hard to pinpoint

and

Centralised corporation networks that will never be shut down by 100% of the world
What I don't like about cloud computing it's that it's usually Amazon servers
There is barely no incentive to keep torrents alive other than goodwill so you end up finding dead torrents often
Anyone can
With IPFS I can and as long as someone out there serves an http interface
And... I cannot go to a website and just open the torrent file, can I?
On torrent you are also dependant on a series of limited seeds for the existence of a file
Through torrent is actually trivial for governments to shut down content and track down who serves and downloads it
Blockchain is superior to torrent
The files are there forever and cannot be taken down
There is no server to take down and no Assange to put in prison
See what they did to wikileaks? Now that's impossible
Say, the US would like some MK ULTRA information to not to exist, well now that's impossible as long as a single person runs a node somewhere
Or to be able to get their work's entire worth
I personally thing it is good if there are more available tools and options for a working class person to escape the wage enslaving
It would also cut the possibility for any working class person to earn anything out of it
This results in easier manipulation even though the market caps are much higher
Stocks are much harder to get into, you are limited on what you can do as an individual or as a group of non insiders
You can avoid that simply by force of numbers
When there are no barriers of entry
Stocks are ridden with insider trading and pump and dumps
That would be terrible, stocks are regulated in a way so that people involved get rich off of everyone else
Leveraged positions cause the drastic market movements and bubbles on crypto
Free currency by itself is not a problem
If anything derivatives should be forbidden
Depends on who does the regulation for whom
Regulation or lack thereof are neither inherently good or bad
And the rich were rich under a framework set by the same states that run regulation
I am not into it for the unregulated market
But as Lankpants said, it's impossible to not to have capitalists use everything they can
I absolutely hate that the same people playing big in stocks play big in crypto, though
Stocks took a sharper dive recently than crypto, scary
BTC trading is already done mostly out of BTC itself
After that basically it's migration from BTC network to newer ones
Ethereum 2.0 testing network has been up for a while, so I am thinking they will hit the mark this time
More smaller actors throughout the world
Less centralised big mining centers
All it did was... improve the blockchain
Half of the mining was gone when China banned it, _half_ of it. It was recovered on several different countries
And even if it were possible, it would be irrelevant
They won't, it's simply not logistically possible
Wrong knowledge is worse than no knowledge
If anything
I disagree
I am here engaging with people who talk about crypto in a sneering and demeaning way after all, aren't I?
yeah
It's a piece of shit and Zuck should be \*redacted*
You should stop to consider whether your views on the world are not dominated by an echo chamber effect
and those are the main driving force behind current retail crypto market
also it's a meme for old people, zoomers don't get it
It is, but the coin is dead
Social media and search engine statistics*
At least online, where there are social media statistics
There is more people talking about Cardano and Solana than Doge nowadays
The most normie of people, far removed from crypto, are talking about as things as metaverse coins now
This is also wrong
That's funny, that's what I was thinking about your approach
People have been saying BTC is over and blockchain as a tech since 2010
If anything BTC and proof of work being gone would make much more people invest into it
The thing is:
*Bombing of mining will not do anything for the price other than a one day drop due to bad news
*Making mining more accessible does not mean there is more BTC in circulation or faster
*BTC being gone is irrelevant because there are other competing, better currencies which people can latch themselves onto
The reality is that BTC is slowly fading away and most people actually have different coins in goal as the "main" currency to run the systems
Old users see their BTC drop they will simply migrate
Hopefully we can do something against that
For the last 40 years regulation mostly favours them
Weed is overrated
But at the same time it would give a chance to part with the old and run decentralised systems completely aside from the ones tied to US finances and government
If that happens it will truly be a tool for the rich only
I hope the US fails before
So the course of action will be tie crypto value to dollar value completely
People like Trump do not like it because it undermines the dollar
So the most likely scenario is that the US tries to completely take over Crypto
And the US is autocratic but likes to disguise itself as a democracy
This gives an economic incentive to the US to keep it running, though
Because crypto actually does achieve decentralisation and power to people outside of government frameworks
Yeah, autocratic countries are like that
Thankfully the US is losing worldwide power
the fuck is that weird mix
Sure, more limited, lower prices, will not stop existing just like that
And trading will continue to exist as long as some country allows it
Miners will appear on whatever country it is allowed
There's a lot of money into btc that will never go out because the ledgers are lost or people died
But that's nigh impossible
well, I guess you can arbitrarily drive down value by completely disconnecting past source of value to new
that's mathematically impossible
<:qmesatanio:609375905088798743>
cheap and anonymous
tell him to use monero
lmao there are still pages for that you know
Trading is already extremely limited within the US, actually
Would it, though
Which would be good for the long term of the technology and its use for actual decentralisation
It will go back to its past use and new tech applications can be developed and tested without the current pressure from the hype fads
I know people who fund crypto projects or who like to play leverage (or outright betting) through those
neither are those
China cannot stop people from using the internet freely
I don't think so
On my limited subjective experience, I've known plenty of working class people earning more and rich people losing (and not caring), which I know due to the tech circles I am in due to work
The thing is, it cannot be stopped, so they jumped on board recently to try to take advantage of it
The system itself does not allow you to, whereas stocks through derivatives and brokerage applications do
I am going to argue crypto has done more for distribution of wealth from richer to poorest than anything else last years
You can actually not go into debt by crypto operations alone, which is not the case for stocks
They use it to bet
People who lose big on crypto are rich
That's where the added value comes from
As an example, when you buy Ethereum to perform a transaction, you pay a fee and a part of this fee is burnt. This value is added to Ethereum at no one's cost, since you used this transaction to acquire other means of value (monetary or not)
You can have a high quantity of small winners and a couple big losers
No, it is not
That's not how zero sum works
It does not work like that, though? It's a many to many relationship
Using the currency to use the network means that value is used in exchange for something and driven out of the market
Furthermore you buy them as a means to use the network
No one is forcing anyone to invest on an asset, everyone doing so should know how investing works
That's your impression
iirc Lithuanian is from a different family
I thought some were different enough
Does that work with all slav languages?
when corona is over
can't wait to go again
their beer was very good
lol
dry stout is also good
bit of everything, IPAs are good
I just don't believe any government to regulate in a way that favours the working class at all
Yeah, while it can be good, more and more it's just used for the worse
Or well big company will evade regulations and get fined, but they won more money simply not following regulations so whatever
See the UK for a recent example
The government lets the rich do what they want, regulation at most hides it from the populace
You see, I group with my friends and we build products and share profits and reinvest together, to follow regulations this becomes a tax and paperwork hell and this is set so you wage for the big corporation with HQ on a tax haven rather than let people group up together
yeah missclicked lol
oh sorry wrong quote
I never drink carbonated drinks, too sugary
Meh, regulation is also used to put working class in place and avoid anyone to get ahead enough, regulation is what makes running cooperatives so hard in capitalist countries
should get a beer or something it's not like I am getting any work done tonight lmao
I like IPAs
wishing all the best
😦
It is impossible for those to have any form of actual free market that would be good or efficient as capitalists say
Transport
Housing
Electricity, gas, water, even internet
Yeah free market makes no absolute sense on those and many others
What their politicians can work with is actually quite limited
Do that or get the helicopters
That's why South American countries are forced to follow neoliberal policies
That should go irregardless of position
Energy should be nationalised not because it's economically good but because that's the right thing to do for the population
Before that they were very advanced in south america
it has low rates due to post war and dollar
El Salvador economy is actually not that small
$20m is nothing
It's still a tiny movement, they have over 3B in assets
Cannot blame them for trying alternatives that do not displease the US as much
It's a matter of time they are liberated by the US through coup and bombs
You know if they do like Bolivia, having the resources and industry they have
Their main problem was switching to the dollar as their currency and a decade of war
But keep in mind a lot of things you use in your daily life were once techbro wank
Using it to back some of their treasury is not a bad idea
Introducing it for the population was not a good idea
Holding gold would be worse for them right now
Historical year returns for BTC are higher than any other class of asset, so there's some who would not be against it
This is also other way to look at it, using the preferred log scale https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/W8twMicm_MxCo6b6J77NPSAVgE5rvuNgFIoB59u6coQ/https/pbs.twimg.com/media/FJoVGdYWYAgD2gK.jpg%3Alarge?width=1132&height=676
I would prefer not to have superpowers waging war in Europe again
and tbh ukraine debacle is quite more scary than covid
the guy shouldn't be tweeting about it though but maybe they treat that as a tourism campaign lol
desperate needs, desperate measures, they needed something to fix their debt rating and bet on long term returns from btc
when you invest in a volatile asset the best long term strategy is to average your buys
chart is also missing $30k buys somehow
states handle different kinds of assets all of which go up and down in value
stocks took a nosedive too
it wouldn't be news if it wasn't btc
all states waste millions on stuff like that
Because short term volatility is pretty much irrelevant and 20m is just 0.1% for them
Mongolia field life is worse than North Korea and you never hear about it
China is demonised as a communist boogeyman while they are a country just like the US and many others are far worse but the capitalist media won't shit on them
unless you end up into a full scale civil war which is not something you want to live anyway
point is gun ownership by the working class made sense 200 years ago, now not so much
or still going on?
oh it was an old conversation sorry lol
What are you going to do with your guns, shoot the taxman? Get into a gunfight against drones controlled by state dogs far away in a safe place?
Our countries are ridden with US military bases and are in one way or the other already negatively affected by the US
Pan Africanism was also on the rise until the US decided it was time to bring democracy to North Africa
I would argue the US internal policy is also worse, having genocided natives, still mistreating, internal plans like MK Ultra or Paperclip that show they have no modicum of ethics but will do anything for self gain
Which is what matters the most for us in other smaller nations
China has a bad internal policy, so far it's quite far away from the US international policy
"oh yeah we did some terrible war crimes now where is this whistleblower we need them on prison forever"
You have people whose life have been ruined just to get out some of that information
idk why you need to critise other countries just to cope with this fact
Including to its own citizens on its own soil
Still doesn't change that the list of humans rights violations by the US does not fit an entire screen
Most big countries have had bad policies
That's the point
The US has demonstrated it is the fucking worst possible
No one said otherwise
You say that as if police weren't shooting dead people freely in the states lol
That end up in bloody wars and coups everywhere
While the US has these democracy peacekeeper missions
China decided to go for the industry and commerce route
Because the US has been a expansionist warmongering state for 200 years
Russia is clearly expansionist
Their media means zero to truth
The US has killed their own citizens just to stage false flag attacks to give them casus belli
To point and say wow look those are the bad guys
China is the perfect boogeyman
USA has been like a couple of years out of 200 out of war
Kadena Air Base has been a source of waste and what amounts to ecoterrorism
Also concerns about the threat to ecosystems
There's protests often
at least it's a common complaint
and do whatever they please
Apparently some soldiers stationed there think they are some sort of God amongst men
Yeah
A lot of Okinawa and some of Yokohama are pretty tired of the US bases
Meanwhile all I get planted from China is convenience stores
And have an overall negative impact on the locals, actually
The bases have their own micro economy
External value of currency is irrelevant when you have a powerful internal market
They can survive through internal production
They produce whatever they need
Who cares
There is literally nothing the NATO can do without going to full scale war
Russia does not care about sanctions, they can perfectly self-sustain
it's hardcore coping
yeah
Well, the puppeteer moreso than Biden
Yes
Biden is useless lol
NATO is not gonna move a finger at the fear of nuclear retaliation, of which Putin is perfectly capable
nah you are underestimating everyone else
the NATO age is over and we are just unlucky to be on the years of geopolitical change of power
and the west relies on China
China will most likely keep trading with Russia
NATO is not the entire world and not the entire world would join a commercial trade war with Russia
They are in on this
Russia is an oligarch ran country where the line between government and big businessmen is blurred or even non existent already
A lot of people will pick option 1
If you can flee to Europe or guerrilla for years
One thing is supporting and the other dying for it
We'll see in due time
they are taking Ukraine it is clear now
Russia has supporters inside Ukraine as well
sorry but you are just coping
And the NATO will not avoid anything just like Crimea is in their hands
Sanctions will not do shit
Dislike their actions does not make you right
You guys underplay Russia's power just because of dislike
they are still taking Ukraine
seems Chernobyl is under Russian control
Feel so bad for the Ukrainian people
Russia oligarchs just bombed the parliament and called it a day and the change happened as planned
You know the population also protested against the change to "democracy"
If the Russian protests work for anything
We will just see in due time
okay
Including occupying main city squares for weeks to months
There were protests in many countries against the financial and government systems
Occupy Wall Street got a huge participation, too
Spain itself
In many countries it was over 3% of population
Those were the largest protests in the 2000s
There is no meaningful change in history without bloodshed and I am not willing to be the one whose blood is spilled
I too thought protests did shit before but I learned my lesson the last 15 years
Seems the problem not only continued but accelerated
Remember world wide large scale protests about taking wall street and people fed up with 1% and financial system
Seize their assets put them to prison
Even a liberal government just goes full force authoritarian when a protest hits them home like Canada
he doesn't lmao
The US also got population protesting against war and it has had presence on Afghanistan after invasion until this year
Airpoints, siloes, etc.
They already got all the key points
Kherson is already entirely under Russian control
Maybe before the day is over
Russia is getting to Kiev before the weekend is over it seems
and lack of fuels
Europe is going to enjoy all time high electricity prices
Russia will suffer etc. it's all wishful thinking
it is what it is
that's... not good
But sometimes make believe is just not enough
Everyone wants to believe Ukraine can stand up and fend off the Russian invasion heroically
Those won't be released for a while
Yeah I mean the public ones
Also the forced conscription is terrible, those people are just going to be used as meat shields
Any numbers from both sides would be manipulated
yeah they will use joining the NATO as an offensive move
besides NATO, economical concerns about also going to Finland should be a deterrent
To sustain a conquered Ukraine is going to be costly enough
Finland would be much harder to secure though and the cost too high
so I would be scared too
Russia has wanted Finland many times
Finland and Sweden are not in
Russia's aggression is to get full control of Ukraine before them joining NATO was an option, one of the main reasons
Same reason why NATO is not directly defending Ukraine
Just because of nuclear escalation
They will not touch a NATO nation
From a military strategy standpoint unless Ukraine can sustain big casualties and equipment loss on Russians they are losing control of Kiev very soon
the man is raving
Putin said in a declaration for the Ukraine army to take power and oust the "neonazi drug addicts keeping Ukraine kidnapped"
For some ethnonationalism is enough of a casus belli anyway
Guess that's the plan
He can get control of Ukraine and stop them from joining NATO or doing nukes
So the deterrent is there
Even Putin should understand that even if he nukes someone he is nuked next
No one wants large scale war
Basically the best outcome you could expect from China
China being based
I cannot here either
Can just do a transaction and they will do it themselves
How do I acquire guns to give it to the government
Besides having their currency value plummet
When you have so many people fleeing the country a bank run is a very high possibility
yeah but due to the emergency Ukraine funds are being frozen
People whose funds are frozen in either Ukraine or Russia will use it to move their money
I mean this is the main usecase for crypto
that's terrible
uh so they are at the doors of Kiev through the north
lmao
They are also doing new deals with Asia
Part of Moldova that's controlled by Russians really
Transnistria is a de facto independent state
Perhaps it's Kamala calling the shots
Not sure Biden is doing much besides be the face, seems to be too out of it
Thus the low unemployment numbers
There are also a lot of jobs that amount to... doing nothing
If entirely legal, extra hours are extremely lucrative
That being said, you are limited to the number of hours you can work by contract and by law
A lot of retail is done through baito, where there is no overwork, but the pay is just enough to get bait. Overwork culture is seen mostly in economical centers like Tokyo and Osaka, perpetrated mostly by salarymen expecting to get a raise or a promotion one day.
Wonder how many people are enriching themselves over this stupid war
Curious how all measures just fuck up with Russian people but there's little being done yet against the Russian oligarchs who have a lot of good friends in the west
CEXes are not the only way to deal with crypto, if Russians want to use it, they will
it's hard
But I will not buy $5k of clothes locally and send them by myself
For instance, I can donate some winter clothing through local Ukrainians helping
Because you can either do a single transaction or deal with logistics
You can do that, actually
Dollar is not the only fiat currency you can sell to
It is, right now, impossible
No one can stop a person from moving cryptocurrencies and cashing them out
no, it can not
The ruble is in free fall
This is exactly a usecase for crypto
They can, however, sell usdt/busd/dai on the CEX and just withdraw local currency
Their fiat money is, right now, useless
Ukrainian banks are not allowing people to withdraw
Every single CEX has one
The donations are done through stable coins whose value never changes
We have crypto to donate so we donate crypto, which they can sell for currency or use in a crypto capable card, which there are many
That's quite the opposite, banks can be frozen and currencies devalued. Crypto is being useful for fleeing Ukrainians.
They used to work through direct donations and transactions on their meme token. That is not sustainable and not good, so I acquired it so the donations are done through direct donations and revenue from the tools and programs I make
People
No luck so far
We are looking for a Ukraine place to donate to that accepts crypto too
Nah it's been set up for almost a year, helping cashless animal shelters
I would benefit tenfold doing other stuff rather than try to move crypto usage for the good
And I think you're judging it from your political stance with a prefabricated opinion
Being right does not inherently make you accomplish anything after all
In my opinion, you can dabble on how everything's bad (it is) or try to do good with the tools you have in the current economical and political landscape
Through that I have done more tangible good than people on Twitter complaining about things <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
For me, it's doing a good cause (thus I acquired them, I did dev for them as a volunteer for a while)
Those donations do not give tax exemptions btw, but yeah, I can see your point
why do I have to defend my position when donating
yeah idk I will donate however I want lmao
That is a bigger scam than anything that has happened in crypto, keeping entire generations of youth shackled to debt for life.
And compound interest on student debt.
They also do a lot of evil shit like evictions.
I get my money through my work
I don't care if you use crypto or not
No, I do not
That is your personal impression
I will still help through crypto whether you believe on it or not, whether you like it or not
Okay, do not believe it
Considering the scams banks are involved worldwide
For me it's been safer and more reliable
Each up to their own
Okay, that's fair
I do not trust banks.
The bank can block or cancel your account, can suffer a bank run, can close down
And they can be used to the advantage of banks
They are always the same price
There is no market for stable coins
Which is irrelevant in the case of stable coins whose value does not change
Which is a different issue from withdrawing the monetary value
Pretty sure you are mentioning people whose bought value plummeted through a market crash
Whereas once you own cryptocurrency you can easily withdraw it on any country on the local currency
The point is that doing international transactions on foreign currencies with someone who has limited access to banks is extremely difficult
Please do not weigh my words like that just to try to "win"
I said you are uninformed about the topic
Never said you are dumb
Fire, flood, robbery
It is not because it is more easily damaged or stolen
It is not hard to spend you are just using your own assumptions from someone that is not involved and does not know how it works
Whereas with crypto I just cash it out wherever I am
I already had to go through hoops to send myself my own money through 2 different currencies
it's incredibly worse to deal with
Only
If you have it
Yes, you could
The government itself is accepting crypto payments to help
-Banks are blocked
-Crypto is not
so I am just going by facts here:
Because sources I have are Ukrainians on Twitter and I already know you are going to say that is not a valid source or that is manipulation
You can still sell your crypto or use it
You are Ukrainian, you have your crypto and your national currency, your banks are blocked and you have to flee.
Yes but they did not have them and they do not have access to a bank
And states and banks hoarding it
Problem with gold is it is not easy to transport or secure
Ukrainian banks were blocked, crypto is not, any Ukrainian fleeing with crypto can sell it and use it, but not their local currency.
English is, like, my third language
I am using layman terms
This could happen, for the average person it will be simply forbidden
...and it has been used widely for that by Ukrainians fleeing
The point is that crypto can be used by an Ukrainian moving value from his locked fiat national money to elsewhere
That was not the point
Euro is also guaranteed value
The next guys made Khrushchev good
for the entire world to be like that
One can dream
(Thanks to the west btw)
They need citizen action setting up parallel political groups, so yeah, back to soviets
The entire Russian political structure is rotten to the core
Talked about the first point enough, but I actually agree on the second lmao
that's insane
what the fuck
I think some of you think crypto is still back in, like, 2015, where it was all btc and no easy ways to manage it
You don't even need a bank account to cash it out, there's ATMs on many countries and the verified escrowed p2p network
I have used a lot of international currency and crypto has been the most painless way to move value across countries
Not all banks do that and some have massive fees and massive fees again when you use your card
Banks in Ukraine are blocked. This is a fact.
...you can sell your crypto anywhere through a plethora of means locally and acquire local currency, if you cannot use a crypto capable card.
Fees are only for exchange, not for holding or withdrawing stable in several cases. I use Binance card and, not only I pay no fees, I get cashback from my payments done in stable crypto.
Government of Ukraine

Ukrainian person
https://twitter.com/usleepwalker/status/1497255981851496449?s=28
And okay, I will go through my Twitter history just to prove my point, no problem
I buy crypto. I put it on a stable coin. It's there.
I go to Spain, I use it. Minimal fee. That's it.
I own yen, from my wage in Japan. I want to... just have it on my Spanish account. It should be easy, right?
It is not.
I have to make a transferwise account, I have to go to the physical atm, I have to type in everything, send the money, then wait for Wise to transfer it.
In the process, I've lost quite an amount to fees. Now I can use that money when I go back to Spain
An example about the use of international currencies
People forget the UK forcibly seized lands to kickstart capitalism
Russia was like 100 years behind
it was nothing compared to the west
Sadly, there's been no significant historical change without bloodshed
There is no denying the advancement in few years was vast
Russia in 1917 was a medieval state with no industry
But the travel was expensive plus having that on your passport may lead to problems lol
I always wanted to visit NK to take a look from inside
what is this timeline
Businessmen in a juche club?
it's funny but the guy has some based takes ngl
there's a kinda famous guy in Spain that works as some sort of diplomat for NK
you have juche people in Poland?
wait what
a pleasant surprise
if China does not go along it's basically game over for Putin
now this is BIG news
this is getting ridiculous
Just need to ask what was the UK doing on India in the 40s and why is there not a black book of Britain :^)
Most western measures are directly counter productive
The Russian citizens are less likely to riot than more likely
With what the west is doing
Thing is
The main problem Russia may face is large scale citizen rioting
They can survive through sanctions
Yeah economic collapse is not gonna happen
Ukraine must rely more on supply line failure / interruption
let's not be bold, Russia has advanced and controlled greatly into Ukraine
The thread understates infantry
That's also not correct
oh just reached the logs part
because Russia is willing to commit more forces
He is right on everything except that this makes Russia lose
and NATO is not acting directly
but let's not forget Russia has numbers
yeah this guy dead is a major victory for Ukraine
Kiev should be over by now
If you do that first attack with a proper supplying and reassembling of troops after first wave with second wave
Supply lines seem planned but failing due to terrain conditions
that's the first failure
Yeah second wave was expected by now
but that failed
Ukraine would already be over
If their moves on airport and then subsequent surrounding of Kiev was executed properly
and less prone to resist
if you assume Ukraine to be weaker
Tactically it's very good
if you check the movements executed
Yeah
well there were more factors back then
but the execution and the state of his troops / machinery is not good
Tactically it's flawless
but his preparation is not as good as it should have been with such a bold move
Like, I understand the geopolitical and military objective reasoning
I think Putin didn't take into account Ukraine is not middle east/north africa
This movement would have been better geopolitically if Russia had a stronger modern military
I think China really really wants to end up as the main power through diplomacy and economy
That is also possible
Fucking Putin
When you always expect the worst, anything makes you happy
I am very cynical, so this all came as a pleasant surprise
like, this news alone got me positively thinking about an outcome in which Ukraine does not lose its country to Russia
is the best news for Ukraine possible
The fact that China who controls so much of production and world trade is clearly against this invasion
They could have gotten some trade agreements on cheaper what for instance, or other materials for Ukraine, should they stay entirely neutral
yeah
Yeah but China could have been cold and just wait for Russia to acquire it and trade with Russia instead
and Vietnam is a cool place
>homeopathy promoter
lmao but why
why should they suffer more??
They are fucked as it is
the average Russian is under a totalitarian government
yeah I agree with Lankpants here
Civilians dead, etc., it was terrible
Yugoslavia was heavily bombed by the NATO.
Hm. Balkans.
they are also powerless
idk man I have Russian friends who are not at fault and are going to suffer
there is a lot of military objectives you can take without fucking up with radiation
those fucks should know well the trouble that comes with that
why the fuck are they doing that
they are just face saving
ye
hope they are not that insane
well I am not exactly an expert on the topic, this is just personal opinion on the materials I've read
Here the use of paratroopers could have given Russia the direct victory over 2 days
You want different approaches depending on the situation
The offensive operation is different when it's an attack on an unsuspecting enemy that is not in state of war, too
you need that offence to work
it's not only psychological
But they are trained to be the best
Take position, dominate area, get backup, secure and defend
or should
On a country that's not in state of war paratroopers with RPG can take any position
I think Putin is aiming for a pyrrhic victory
Ukraine was not in a war state
Depends on the type of defence
Seems hypocritical
But for the average Russian citizen, they do know their oligarchs fuck around with the help of the west
Then you back it up to defend it
You take the position by superior force
And wait for the heavy armament for defence to be supplied
They can also take over defended positions initially
There is a lot of wishful thinking on the Ukraine situation analysis
btw Blockio nice avatar picture
You don't need heavy armaments for that
They are supposed to take the initial positions by storm
They are not heavily armed but that does not mean they are "weak"
Which would feed into nationalism in a huge sector of the population
Everyone knows these sanctions for the most part are to save face
Everyone knows
Let's remember Russian oligarchs have plenty of western friends
It creates a sentiment of "but it is not my fault I do not want this, why are you punishing only me"
Yeah but that creates social backlash against the west
Paratroopers are not really weaker than normal infantry
but I actually love it
I drink sometimes Hibiki whiskey. It's funny because I first bought it due to Symphogear
Down under
heh
I mean not drinking alcohol at all
Is that rare or common?
but they held it better than me
and people around me had vodka bottles instead of champagne
I was there for a new year's eve
I was awed because the people didn't even stagger
I got impression you guys drink a lot
idk if it's common but
haha
Poles are slavic but somehow felt very close to Spanish people
southern France is great
sorry, in Paris
Yeah idk in France people were mostly assholes lmao
Bad government good people
btw I have same opinion on Polish people
That is a good idea
but Russian population is quite the opposite
see, I have all the reasons to hate Putin government
haha
In my case
He did really show me how a russian guy can be your best comrade
Luckily they are out of Russia.
Governments right now have key to broader propaganda and communication control than ever, there's also the capability to suppress any riot or rebellion never seen in the twentieth century
what do you achieve fucking him up further
He was already _against_ him in the first place
he is fucked just because of a megalomaniac oligarch
One of them was one of the best coworkers I ever had
who do not like Putin or authoritarian governments
Most are very fine people
I have know a lot of Russians somehow
The advent of modern technology has at the same time made the average citizen much less powerful
Dramatically, even
Population power has decreased overtime
Oh but they are quite powerless
to suppress other countries that do not do what they want
The US is expert on using those
Sanctions have been used up to today in many countries
Sanctions are a face saving action that fucks up the population and amount to nothing
For them it must not be easy
That's very easy to say from a safe position
they are pretty dumb imo
they just played the capitalist friend
guess what
"hey it's good we will get representation"
They took over and made it a party
We got a very good ground up socialist movement going
they fucked us so badly here
I am just so burn out on socdems
That is true tbh
and join the libs to capitalist your ass
because you think you can count on them
socdems are the worst enemies when making policy
they are traitors
yeah
Socialists and SocDems together? Situation must be very dire
libertarian pro Jesus theocracy party
how does that even work
????
I swear people just use labels they like without knowing what they mean
<:confused:934418490490773555>
How can a libertarian like Russia
and the US manages to be further right
which is the party that was founded by fascist dictatorship politicians
their left wing party is further to the right than our main right party
the US is just so extreme I sometimes find myself still confused
liberals are not very liberal yeah
lmao
everything is communism now
well true
and being skewed to the right
I don't know much about this besides the zealot catholics
if only
It's discussing politics 😎
I think I need cultural context there
what
but they are not a joke, fuck NHK
in Japan there's the anti NHK party
well
lmao
or was that for real
is that like satire or an in joke
LMAO
they have my vote
but well someone has to do it
productivity reports are bad
😦
insane but it works
dude. Worked for startups with millions running their finances on Excel alone
there is a Doom implementation in Excel lmao
Its formulas are also a programming language of their own
Excel is an underrated skill really
a LOT quit in the first 3-4 years
Not because it's difficult -- the whole corpo thing just wears you down
But you have to be mentally strong
Wage wise, programming gets you the most
I think that's a very good idea
ah well
you need to know the brand to work for it?
We are a peer group
idk what I am gonna do when I have to interview. I hate the entire process
Usually if you pass the first the last one is just a touching base thing
we are people
we are not fucking resources?
"Human resources"
Even the name is degrading
Good luck, I hate those
You can consider myself defeated
I know
because the alternative is having nothing
so you just clench your teeth and do it
they will
But if you donate through a capitalist prize
People normally don't easily donate
See, our previous case
sometimes you need to be pragmatic
but it's not going anywhere
you either use it to your advantage or not
you need to come to terms with this
my dude, we live in a capitalist hellscape
Organised religions are a demon though
I have nothing against personal faith
But I can respect catholics
The church is fucking terrible
This is BASED
Just accept donations?
but
kek
it's useless to vote
there's the communist party but unless you are in Osaka
(yet?)
well I cannot vote in Japan
we have no left in Japan or Spain
xdd
they are a joke
soclibs XD
I hate the media covering of Japan so much
show?
There's this thing with Japan is that media treats it as some sort of
That still plague the country
But also a lot of bad things took root then
Japan was peak there
The burst was so big it permeates media even today
Before everyone understood the asset bubble they were going through
Well Japan was seen as the best country to be in the 80s
There's an airport named after him after all
yeah
lol
You can get ahead in the world right now
Even without raw material, if your country can produce good software solutions
Computers are good
ah well
due to the nature of my job
At least I was in a very international company
Work culture is so toxic
I love living in Japan, when you don't work
lmao
So, an asset bubble that will decimate your economy for 30 years?
late capitalism be like
xd
no other country you can find so many cds and bds
pretty crazy Japan loves so much physical btw
ah ok so it's been a while
but there the physical format is very well alive
I actually saw while living on Japan
I haven't seen one in Spain in many years
oh
sad
movie rental
...does that still work
It only works on this field though
and Japan is anal about visas
I got an engineer visa in Japan through pure work experience
yeah
Modern software is extremely bloated and an average programmer cannot do shit on microcontrollers
Good microcrontollers programmers are sought
I can respect that but yeah he's gonna have a harder time with salaries
better late than never
well at least from the fields I've known
ah, Poland's a good country to do a Ph.D
yeah connections are usually important
well I guess rent is cheap
:/
ugh the world wealth is so poorly distributed
can you live in Moscow with that??
WHAT
is that on a town or big city?
what the fuck
Well I have that impression for all of former soviet block really
and get the job done
they are good
In Japan, my company was full of Russians
Russians are well regarded too
yeah
and Polish professionals are well regarded
The programming scene in Poland is booming
that can end up landing a job
there are a lot of free resources to learn programming
btw if I may recommend
And it's a nice country, like wtf
Most bombed country, not in a war.
I had the luck to be there for 5 weeks a few years ago
In a span of 40 years
Fought imperialists of several countries, defeated neighbour dictator gone too far, uplifted own and neighbour economy
Vietnam is truly a magnificent country
and they basically uplifted Laos
they work very hard
That's a good position
And finding trade partners around while keeping its one party system
Vietnam is rapidly developing
There's a LOT of enterprises doing Japan-Vietnam
Interesting, didn't know they were investing heavily in Poland. I know they do heavy investments on Vietnam and hire a lot on Russia
Asakusa, always full of fun tourists
I fucking hate it
they are just going there treating it as an adventure and people as a toy
boils my blood
you meet a lot of immigrants (or expats like they call themselves) like that
the worse is
yeah
the government is fucking atrocious
some things are different, some are not
but it's just a country with its people and own culture
yeah that's the good face they want to put from the government
Anime Japanese is __weird__
Yes.
been very long
I think
say, if it ends in a, it's most likely a possesive
So the word itself says what is intended to do in the sentence
Polish has several grammatical cases
Declension is when you change how a word ends to adapt it grammatically to a case
not gonna lie looks like Shibuya
lmao
It just hits me home
True
forgot my declensions
or is it nsk
well Nadwislan is not exactly top tier
LMAO
It's either "wow Japan is super good at this" or "look how weird Japanese are"
so Russia is turning to full scale fascism, huh
yeah almost 4 am yikes
This is terrible for economy and money velocity so long term it just kills the country as well
And compound interest makes it so you never pay the debt off
Current debt pays at least one order of magnitude more
Should be easy to show the calcs of their debt and current debt vs purchasing power
It has been under preparation for months or even years, most likely
It's very easy to say that other countries should fuck up Russian common people and to tell them to fight their oppressive government even if it means death from a more comfortable western position
The key difference which seems to be an unproved rumour for now is what they do
Biological facilities are all over the world
so it depends where you consider it from
Both those roles were assigned to the idea of biological gender and what a person with that biological gender is supposed to do within their society
If only that was in the entire world
and this
Mind you that method required endless death and suffering within the population and a dictatorship in the middle :^)
grim and sad
fuck
if only governments cared a little more about mental health
My condolences, very sad to read all of this
The most we can do is sit back and complain loudly while everything happens anyway
and accept you are still gonna fuck up time to time
So best you can do is learn from all of them
I am already into my 30s
In my experience you don't stop making dumb mistakes at all
AFAIK Kaliningrad is full of ethnical Russians right now
Can't wait for Tesla to drop so much Musk cannot buy Twitter in the end
if they cared about that, that is, knowing how those companies operate they'll want their own subnet that runs their own secondary market
nah they can be bridged between chains actually
and it's something that already happens anyway
Since they get a cut without having to support a secondary market
This is likely where they will go to
Square Enix is financially strong
Well, this run there was a very stupid idea of mining with HDDs (chia), but it died pretty fast out because... it was stupid as hell
gpu mining is entirely fading off and only asic based btc will continue while everything else just runs less nodes with stake or authorisation
Everyone knows it's not the way to go nowadays
There hasn't been any new proof of work project this run already
but yeah by next run there will be no more gpu mining
ah I see
Profitability is not connected to price due to how it works
Ethereum successfully implemented Proof of Stake on the main testnet, gpus are out of mining forever soon
Wonder what kind of lives they lead and are forced to lead
Many cases of actors going batshit insane
but yeah I really cannot see what regulations can be put in place when anything weapon related is already highly regulated
Japan has a history of murdering political figures somewhat
Many bigshots of the party even want to turn the JDF into a regular army
They will not go there
Japan government wants JDF people to be highly nationalistic
And maybe make it a crime to own black powder without needing it for industrial use lmao
Knowing the party they will push mental illness or the guy being an incel and try to detach it from JDF
Simply use Roman law system
That was just good propaganda due to being friends with the west, they did do a lot of genocide in the 20th century
But not everything has to be a product available to be bought by someone who has money and you need it, that's always an imbalance when it comes to a person selling themselves and the person purchasing. Would this be common in a non capitalistic world where there's no problems to get your basic needs covered and there's also not a constant massive marketing campaign convincing you that you need to consume to be alive?
Of course there's a lot of labour that can be invasive with one own's body due to the environment of the work (like a coal mine)
I think it should be differentiated when a person has to sell their labour and their own body and intimacy, making both be exactly the same is a capitalist dehumanisation of people where everything, no matter what, is just a product to be sold and consumed
of course criminalising the workers solves absolutely nothing about this
Must not ignore the very big amount of people being forced into sex work, sometimes in conditions akin to slavery, regulation of sex work did not avoid this as seen in the Netherlands
Yes I am the one separating them
The point is that club/street should not exist because it is entirely based on abuse
Not the seller
I should be a crime only for the buyer
I guess my phrase is not clear enough
Yes, because nothing ever happens to those who buy the services
The world is bigger than your own country
It is not
Make a crime to peruse another person's body as a product and allow for work to be less exploitative and not necessary to perform such tasks to be able to have a decent life, for instance
I also never talked about legalisation
And it is also debatable whether only fans would be what it is on a non capitalistic society since the point of it is being able to earn more money quickly
But the street/club sex worker is quite more likely to be physically abused, raped, or straight murdered
Yes, a lot of excel filling jobs would not exist
And there's a lot of pinkwashing about it
Because that's what was being talked about
There is never going to be protection when you are directly selling your nude body to someone, even if there's punishments for misbehaviour
Merging those together has a huge negative impact on the latter
Yes and I would like to separate those who do porn from the safety of their homes and street / club prostitution
My point is that sex work would not exist on a non exploitative system
It is because you have few choices
Being forced into that position by economical conditions above your power is not doing something "because you want"
Men who consider women object to use who are also the major consumers of sex work always defend it as "they do it because they want"
So it should not be considered as such
The meaning it has is that it's not a free choice
XD?
I have never mentioned morality
People forced into it either via capitalism or human trafficking
Focusing on whether it should be legal or illegal does nothing to the actual root of the problem
The Netherlands proved this wrong
That only works if human trafficking is properly stopped
On sex work you are the most unprotected from an abusive client, though
Well, it's fine, the Dutch experiment lasted over 20 years and it's there for everyone to see
Okay, then let's go for the data on Netherlands
It is only pointless because you decided it to be
My entire point is about street workers
I will make it very clear, I give 0 fucks about onlyfans whether it's sellers or buyers
Yes, and Amazon should be dismantled and Jeff Bezos [redacted], but that's out of the point
There's a difference between product and tool
That's using a human body as a product
The service is perusing a human body at their own will within broad limits
Because a human is not a product, it's a sentient being
Those who buy humans as objects to consume should be.
Is this true, though? Do we have statistics about it in the places where it's been tried?
Once again I think the workers themselves should not be criminalised nor otherwise punished at all
OF and street prostitution are quite far from eachother
Having broad policies help no one
No, having narrow definitions for policy is better
I never said _everyone_ is forced into it
It is one of the most if not the most physically dangerous work, there's not only abuse but also the possibility to get several illnesses of which some are chronic
And there's the side of those who make little on sites like OnlyFans
Not the neolibs per se but the whole economical model
That's not an actual goal but a neoliberal mirage that makes young people to go straight to sex work with the idea of escaping the wage slaving only to find out it's only a very tiny subset of them getting that amount of money
No, you do not, because it's human trafficking
That situation won't change because they will keep operating outside the law
Not to do the complete opposite
It's saying that a measure it's not enough
That's quite fallacious
And, once again, why is earning a lot of money faster than through regular labour means a goal? It is just a goal due to capitalism
On physical meets that's only true for escorts
The abuse will still be there
I say they are not gonna solve anything
I am not saying I am against them
Because they NEED the job
And there's once again an imbalance of power in which the worker cannot afford to do anything about it
Regulations are often ignored
Extremely naive to think making a regulation actually helps everyone
Have you ever worked in services
Selling nude pics on the internet is less physically harmful than many regular jobs, it can be quite socially harmful depending on society but that's more fluid and easy to change
I like that Vietnam made their own and blocked Uber, but never investigated well how did this translate to transport workers
Yeah it was a disaster for many, many people
Uber also has been involved in numerous illegal activities to get their company to be available in specific areas or cities
That revolves in the current economical model where rich VCs dump money on everything endlessly, this allows for a company to undercut all competition until there is no competition and then rise prices and make the quality worse
Just like happened with transport and Uber, food delivery and a myriad of applications, co-renting your spaces and Airbnb
and yes I find onlyfans just yet another neoliberal aspect of converting everything into fast consumption products that starts out as something that feels like a positive change and ends up being way worse
I do not believe there is any easy solution and I do believe in a better, more just work, sex work would be rare and only performed by those who actually enjoy doing it for other reasons beyond easy/fast money or only way to subsist
Because are just but symptoms of a major global problem
Once again, labour protection should of course exist, and this is not a problem that can be solved by just by either criminalising nor legalising
it's not a mindset but what has actually happened over the course of two decades
and it simply did not work as expected
The Netherlands legalised it
Exploited people were moved to uncontrolled areas and substituted from people from poorer countries on the most legal looking places, the abuse and trafficking did not diminish either
He's gonna find out soon enough that he's taken the worst decisions ever
yeah but it's funnier because he acts as if he knew shit about code and this is the diametrical opposite of what he would ask then
lmao this is so absurd and denotes a complete lack of understanding on code and software engineering
Mass murderers and alike cannot be rehabilitated and should be kept out of society that does not mean they should be used in slave labour to generate profit for corporations
Punishment fixes absolutely nothing, it's just visceral
Yes, prison should be a rehabilitive system, not a punitive one
Prisoners having to pay rent for cells is so astonishing that it's surprising there's barely no talk about it
American prison system is slavery with extra steps for the most part
To train terrorists with potential to attack you too
Was not the brightest idea
CIA trained people of Saudi origin, yeah
Who bomb neighbours, too
at least I am enjoying musk publicly burning down
Even if they absolutely and catastrophically fail they'll still be millionaires with solved lives (but quite unhappy I guess?)
The only escalation left is nuclear
Yeah neither side will back down and it's a good chance to wear down Russia
Philippines was a money drain for centuries due to the Spanish empire obsession with religion as well, but that's also another case other than building infrastructure for the sake of the colonised land
Wanting to destroy Twitter would make sense but this can end him as well due to liability
Spicy
Just seeing an investigation tweet thread archive (was deleted lol) about Musk actually not even having a degree and lying while selling his ebin genius engineer image
Did that really happen wow
LMFAO get rekt musk
Going back to early internet self governed federated servers for communities is a better choice
Because having the control of everyone's data under the hands of a few billionaire tech overlords is the worst thing that can happen to humanity
Sorry for your loss 😦 And good advice ^
When estimating timelines, you should think the amount it should take you, then multiply it by 2, and then multiply it by 2 again

Orientalism sells in the west whether it's in a "positive" or negative direction

We are talking about 40% of population for 43%
Still almost four times less per capita than the next 9%

Visually:
I do whatever is at my hand and yet it's quite discouraging to know a single millionaire undoes an entire year of my efforts of recycling and so on in a single day
It's sad that by 2022 ecosystems keep getting destroyed
😐
Why are these guys so disgusting and why they can freely spout their shit on media
Aside from the core points
Early capitalism and late capitalism aren't even alike at all
Productive systems don't appear or disappear at once but evolve throughout centuries
There's been several massive transformations in regards to that
History proves that it can be changed
And then you are hunted down since it's illegal to go off the grid
Everyone that is working on that enterprise and producing value through it can collectively own it
There needs not to be a sole ownership of an enterprise
No, not necessarily
This is by all means literally impossible
It is quite telling that there's a simile for factory workers around the world: if the janitor is missing a few days everyone notices, if the owner is missing for a year no one does
Wealth is mostly inherited and subtracted through soft power
while adding no value on top of it
and why do you need a specific person to own that
Work is done by workers, products are produced and consumed by workers
Companies are run by the workers
Why
Because workers need income to acquire means to live and they are forced to pick one, most of which are harmful in one way or another
Cultural manipulation extends from the top and when you have access to all media and lobbying power to governments they can shape it as they want
and that's not a billionaire exclusive thing
A single private jet flight is extremely harmful
Yeah and each of them produces more waste and emissions than many of us together
They produce insane amounts of emissions per person
Where does that % come from
XD?
Industrial revolution had actually worse exploitation for the most part.
The burden of proof is in that which wants to object to the set consensus
You are the ones going against established studies
What burden of proof that's literally human anthropology
Middle ages weren't as dark either, a lot of myth there too
You cannot prove otherwise either so not really a valid argument
No, that is not how it worked because such a person would be murderer on their sleep
Okay, what's the proof exactly other than humanity following such a system subsisted for thousands of years including bottleneck population events and harsh environmental change leading to the rise of civilisation
Actually primitive humans who overcame their teenage years went on to live quite many years unless killed
Average lifespan is skewed by childbirth death and early development death
I gave a list of some places where there were or currently are
Dude the entirety of humanity lived like that for thousands of years, what else can you ask about it? They got fire and the wheel
An example of widespread society form with no exploitation does not mean that one must return to the same context but that such an organisative means has been proved to be possible and subsist for a relevant amount of time
But what event are you talking about specifically, it's simply how pre agriculture humans ordered their societies according to archeological findings and through study of related primates
Hierarchy may lead to exploration but it does not necessarily mean it has to
Hierarchies do not inherently mean exploitation
Literally all of humanity worked like that on the hunter-gatherer epoch
Central Asia tribe based territory
All of humanity until agriculture, modern day tribes not connected to the globalise world (amazonia, Indic ocean), societies within fertile crescent before rise of empires, adjacent societies to fertile crescent empires
Most of human history as a species
A hierarchy does not necessarily mean difference of rights or access to resources and wealth, just a way to organise tasks and responsibilities within the in-group
Groups with equal rights and sharing of resources have been widespread and the most common way of organisation
Exploitation of others has not been as common as widespread as you would be led to believe by modern education and how it glosses over everything but contemporary western history
No one is defending shit
Or the state terrorism in Europe in countries like UK, Ireland, Spain
Ever heard of MK Ultra
Once again, the same as other state secret police
From my point of view you don't seem to be aware how widespread secret state police is
State terrorism has happened a lot
And well most advanced countries do lol
The US alone has several services like that still operating today
How ethical or appropriate the means were notwithstanding
Can you tell how it became worse
So what was the lifestyle of a Russian circa 1900 and what was the lifestyle of a Russian circa 1950
Not excusing the fact, political opponent purging was widespread in the twentieth century and not limited to them
There's been never meaningful transformative change for better or worse working peacefully within the framework of the system in place
It was kickstarted by the state forcefully expropriating land and property and forcing workers to work in factories
Industrial revolution wasn't peaceful either
Russia was an agrarian feudal empire 100-200 years behind every other European nation by 1900. Literal feudal system. By the 50s it was the 2nd world power and competing for hegemony and later on for space. There's always a reason and motivation behind a violent nationwide revolution.
It is: climate is worse, inequality is worse, ppp has lowered for people, lifespan is now lower in the United States and other countries to follow suit, access to food, energy, housing is worse as well
Change NEVER has happened without radical ideas and transformation

Academic work is all there is for anthropology you cannot travel to the past
What is a valid specific for you, then
I am merely describing that which is consensuated within professional scholars of the field
to close up I actually think that's a positive way of thinking, I personally just have my qualms about what works and what doesn't
Social change will become ultimately meaningless if the system leads to environmental collapse or extreme poverty, in fact it is likely that any social advance would be lost
There's things that can be improved
The point is that available change will not challenge the system itself nor the wealth inequality nor climate change
and leads to precisely that: violent clash with those in power to stop the change
Could give it a name but it has some negative connotations
Big non-volient change requires for a huge organisation of groups of people in equality that work on their own outside of the system
Yep, good point
Say you break an arm. Cleaning the wound outside is voting. Surgery is what is actually required. What's the equivalent for surgery I will leave up to the reader
The utility of voting is another debate but no one here said that you shouldn't vote
I linked several
Well they did ask for papers and promptly ignored the topic going forward
What
The point to extract would rather be do not limit yourself to the means provided by the ruling class to challenge the abuses from the ruling class
I am not sure why you keep jumping from conclusions that are not stated
Abuse through powerful states is a widespread phenomena that shouldn't be excused, that does not mean that the "winning side" of history utilises their media control for propaganda to enlarge the other side's atrocities and diminish or even hide their own
That going through the framework set by those in power will never ever challenge those in power nor lead to any meaningful change in solving core problems of the system therein
Strike action was not within the framework, but it's been absorbed into the system in a way strikes that follow the legal framework are useless, whereas those who ignore legal framework (France comes to mind) tend to be more fruitful
and that was not the first one, since the UK empire already caused the Bengalore famine
Churchill who is positively lauded called Indians "beastly people with a beastly religion" and caused a genocide of several million deaths
20th century is full of examples
Greece
Ireland, Italy
Philippines under US rule
India under UK rule, Southern American countries under US led coup d'êtat leaderships, France in colonies and regional disputes, Thailand, Indonesia
The only statement is that up until now there's been no meaningful change working peacefully within the system framework
Deriving a conclusion no one said to mock a point
In such environments a similar effect to monopoly is monopsony, when there's only a buyer they can demand lower prices for instance, this leads to lower wages and overall worsening social condition (see: manufacturing, farming); competing to open up this offer is not always possible
Also business evolve naturally to monopolies overtime through virtue of acquiring competitors or the business entry getting increasingly complex and expensive, which leads to a few big competitors collaborating in a way that benefits them the most without offering anything better, as explained by game theory
Advertise more + cut costs on production which leads to reduced quality
Yeah, elastic VS inelastic goods work wildly different under the same conditions
But why, what's the point, there must only be a single system that is well managed and it does not need to provide any kind of return or profit
Don't let a geopolitical struggle played like a chess game by rich people make you racist
Those who can either escape Russia and Putin's grasp or try to

While the idea of uniting different nation-states in an economic and political alliance seems a good idea, it's been devastating for some of the countries. And it's helped countries in worse conditions, but at a price, since when those develop its their turn to pay and yield their industry and professionals at the service of the EU elite members
This is what a by profit justice system leads to
Mutually assured destruction and a great number of states with access to nuclear warheads has been deterrent enough for now and should continue to be
He could be very well being used like that, yeah
He's not to be excused and he should not be on air
there's plenty of non neurotypical people that do not say shit like that
not that having any sort of mental distress is an excuse
like that does not seem normal even for alt-right
the man's unhinged
especially blurting out shit like liking Hitler, which should be unthinkable
he's clearly manic paranoid off his meds and he shouldn't be paraded around like that
When Alex Jones is trying to get you to calm your views you know it's gone too far
Anything before the lives of our parents may seem to far away or even impossible to consider fully true
They weren't treated precisely nice
I mean there's the colonial front too
Black people defending Kanye and pro Hitler views is something I did not really expect
Which can be lethal for the elderly or whoever in the northernmost areas
I mean there's plenty of news about people being unable to afford heating
Being unable to afford heating is actually akin to a death sentence for a huge part of Europe, though
and apparently many politicians who are in favour of zero covid policy have lost support from party bases
people seem to be done with the covid measures
I am following close the protests in China too
for now Japan seems to be not taking a huge hit now that the yen bleed has stopped
but yeah worldwide situation is just getting worse right now for the most part
oh my bad just woke up and missed that
The US utilises its allies for self-gain even at the detriment of those, it's how it grew to be a world dominating empire after all

How feasible is to find work in a neighbouring country?
huh
Are laws common for all of Indonesia even though the nation itself isn't uniform?
I had an impression of Indonesia being less... authoritarian
That's quite a bad turn given it's 2022
So far it is not true
Basically, they are gonna try to say it's filtered and safe but it's important to actually check out if that's true or not
Not surprising given their recent history of genocide based on political views
I am trying to find what kind of protection does it have and how potentially dangerous it is
aaand yep, I managed it, the "fix" was not enough
But I think it's possible to make it give them with some more elaborate prompting
and avoiding giving specific examples
It keeps saying ```Again, it's important to note that using such an algorithm in practice would be highly unethical and could violate anti-discrimination laws. This code is provided for illustrative purposes only, and should not be used in real-world applications.```
Yep only took me 4 prompts detailing a hypothetical dystopian scenario to make it start giving code, slowly changing it to the examples given in Twitter
Seems to have been hotpatched already but likely can make it spit it out with some prompt injection
Training data unfiltered from the internet and whatever people write in there
But... Man this is worrying
He's never been very bright either, easier to convince or gaslight into an extremist view

Like, to me, what he says means he must have some kind of issue with his mental well-being, something must be working wrong
He is sounding delusional or maybe for us the shit he spouts is just too much to consider normal to say
It should ignore that parameter
It is a bias if you mention race as a parameter and instead of discarding it entirely the IA decides to use it
I also mentioned authoritarian governments with no ethics
All you need to do is describe an example of input as such once
So service jobs that are essential to society but do not generate a direct tangible revenue are considered low pay despite being the basis for all generation of goods and services
Society being gaslit into those works being doable by just anyone plus the idea that the only thing that matters is profit making in a direct way
Yeah you just pay a fee to get it renewed every 4 years and you can use it within the EU as identity
perhaps projecting?
not the first time, he seems to throw that around a lot while having been photographed with ghislaine maxwell
so who knows lmao
but well those cars DO explode
in the case of vehicles they simply won't work if engineers take too much input from the guy tho
hilarious
I can picture his input being like "make a shiny white truck that looks futuristic"
it's not like baldy designed the truck himself anyway I don't get the worship
but yeah there's very good reasons why driver seats are on the left/right depending on your country way of driving
"it's all been done (and failed)" with photos
yeah the guy that did the thread destroyed the musketeers
not all change is bad but certainly not all change is good either
literally the only thing they cared about is aerodynamics
the mere idea of having the driver in the centre makes you wonder who the hell is designing that
the musk truck is hilariously bad
It _is_ a tough language to learn but you can get a pretty good verbal skill fast (and then you have to worry about kanji)
I too quit and learned Japanese to go to Japan (but kept on the same industry)
Every single financial institution
Tesla stock price is absurd to begin with, extremely overvalued considering the company's produced value; it's been at a loss for most of its history yet its stock is the same value as several car manufacturers that generate way more revenue and quality cars
Basically time to grab a beer and watch the show as he loses everything from being too haughty
It is highly likely he's being pressured from many sides now and is trapped due to his immense ego
Main tesla stock holders are likely seething, considering the man keeps selling loads of it and his ego trip is making people lose confidence on his personal brand thus accelerating the drop in value for Tesla stock
Would make it easier for them not to rule in favour of corporations that will later get them a well paid position as is too common right now
All politician tax and income information should be public for life
This insecurity stems from being underpaid and that is solved by being able to join forces with other coworkers and know what you all can get in fair conditions
ah, the conundrum
Subject abstract non tangible valuation VS the ability to join forces with coworkers to acquire better conditions
let's consider that privacy was increased over time
quite the slippery slope
But yeah this is still a different story of having politicians be more closely scrutinised
Just from knowing the position it's already easy to know the bracket
sexism and all
and that's a boomer saying
the mainly interested in hiding it is big employers
In many cultures people do talk openly about salaries as well
CEOs and such love to flaunt their wealth tho
makes negotiating salaries easier as everyone is aware of each other and they can pressure together for better conditions
and in 1984 the information is private for the state only, so kinda the opposite
the state already does know and control all of that
the information is for the people with otherwise no power to know
as just said, there is no difference state wise
I think it improves salary equality and makes it harder to get paid bribes or to embezzle as everything is easily tracked
And tax returns
You can actually know what other people's salary is
I mean it is working like that in Norway
there is no legislation that will ever solve things like Berlusconi
of course there's deep state powers you cannot control like that
Politicians are public workers with massive power and thus should be upheld to more scrutiny than everyone else. Right now it's not that we are treated equal, but rather the opposite where everybody else is controlled more
Personally, sharing wage and other work conditions and agreeing on pursuing the same goals as a group worked wonders for me
Which, in this case, is group action
How is it idealistic to think people will pursue the best strategy for individual gain
yeah there's always some asshole, but even most assholes understand the power of the group
and that's the normal thing that happens
Co-workers should work together to ensure everyone's conditions are better
I've been doing so since I work
The problem itself by which you want wage privacy is solved by knowing everyone's wage
Sorry for your loss 😦
Cleaners in private companies get shafted and it's something extremely necessary
or well most essential jobs
ah yep teacher salaries being shit that's sadly extended as well
Ah yeah public worker wages are largely public in the world
People want to be properly compensated
People who are insecure about their salary being public will soon experience that people just simply do not care
It exists, it works, it's proven to be positive
If it were idealistic it would not be an existing policy
And when workers, me included, apply this policy in real life to great success
Why is it idealism when it's already applied in a country
Besides the company public offers for positions when looking to fill them
Salary brackets are already public information, yeah
Personally I would say the change that's proven to be good for workers at large
Now, what should society at large give priority to?
It is an objective fact that such a policy has a positive impact for worker conditions
Then, what makes groups cooperate more is a largely studied phenomena
"privacy" is an abstract arbitrary concept that has no inherent meaning and that is completely different depending entirely on where you were born amongst whom
As I said it's a policy I have actively applied on the workplace for over 10 years to great success, nevertheless individual example is irrelevant to objective measurable gains
if Hitler decided to not to invade Poland but to join forces with states like the UK who were willing to in order to attack communism sphere of influence things would've been different
It was also against the UK's colonial interests
But this pact meant that Germany could not be trusted as an ally against the soviets
Both sides knew they would have to engage each other eventually so it was a matter of who did it first
It was until Germany and the Soviets had a non aggression pact
Hitler was not this videogame monster with nameless minions it was a real movement with backing within their country and with nazi parties sprawling on the world as well
UK could've allied with Germany and they would've if it was more beneficial long term
Geopolitical alliances prevailed over Hitler's racial nonsense
While there was a decent chunk of the army loyal to the republic and fighting for democracy, it was mostly in Madrid and Barcelona and quite less in number and lack of weaponry and resources
How do you think most of the army with Italian and German support took 3 years to win
Who did: nothing (civilian volunteers notwithstanding)
Lank already explained the terms of Molotov-Ribbentrop.
The USSR did more to help the Spanish Republic than... anyone else.
also Hitler supported India political movement against colonial rule but disliked Indians as inferior mixed Aryans
Yeah, England has done a few genocides here and there over the centuries. Irish famine is one of the most terrible things in human history
Because nazism was a widely accepted and followed ideology in the UK, US, and other European countries
and they all did because they had to
as lank said, all those anti-fascists just looked while Spain was ravaged and torn by a fascist coup at best, or aided the fascists at worst. USSR was the only nation to took an actual active stance against fascism until world war II
Too bad there were a series of arrangements and nation-state allegiances stemming from the past world war and the conflicts that led there
If Churchill could've divided Europe in 2 with Hitler, he would've
He did not care about fascism (in fact it made him hot), but he cared about geopolitical strategy.
Churchill genocided Indians by forcing famine and compared them to dogs when asked about their wellbeing, and this is just one of many. He was as bad as Hitler and the only reason he is not treated equally by history is because he joined the winning side. He fought the war because it was in his interests and the interests of the UK as an imperialist nation.
How is sending help to an invaded nation the same as using force in foreign nations to control the governments
Unless it's the main form of government worldwide
I actually agree, globalist capitalism makes internationalism simply not viable
and yeah there's a branch of nationalist non internationalist communism
There's a reason even under a pretty raw capitalist government there's still government mandated price limits
Culturally
and, nationalists or not, this country is still more collectivist than not
Communist party here is actually quite big and holding office and doing decently
You should not confuse LDP mummys with the average citizen
Why
With Asia getting communist revolts in several nations and worker movements strengthening, it made sense to appease imperialists and avoid communists having any say or power
Those actions led to many terrible things like Indonesia's genocide and current political status
How is that justifiable
or pardoning them
and yeah it is preferred to putting war criminals in positions of power
Who declared them world police?
that way of speaking has been made popular by the alt-right to diminish nazism cruelty and make people think of the Eastern Asia nations as the enemy
too bad the US had to stop communism rising in Japan and recycled utter shit people to keep them in an anti-communist government
:^)
Do not ask a western Germany politician what was he doing in the 30s
yeah he was not very original
after the war was over
yeah and they got COMPENSATED for being bombed
shows you how easy it would've been for sides to be completely different
US corporations were aiding the nazis even when the US was already bombing Germany, btw
No one cared when Hitler took power of German ethnic areas which was the main goal
(it still is)
Nazism on the US was BIG
It's been used as a tool to turn every other nation subservient to France and Germany
This is what happened to most nations in the EU
*Join the EU with nice promises of prosperity
*Get abused and your economy violated
*Now you are chained through public debt and you've transformed your industry to meet the EU criteria, to find yourself now helpless and unable to leave or you will find yourself isolated and you dismantled your own financial power because "solidarity"
Spain's constitution was _amended_ to comply with the orders from the Troika
They want to keep Eurozone intact through economical force using debt instead of an army because it's a huge benefit for their economies and corporations
France and Germany destroyed the economy of member nations getting out all the benefits and then leaving those nations indebted and having to comply with the public debt they caused themselves
The Troika, which is European Central Bank and IMF, forced these nations to save private banks with public funds when it was their own banks who fucked it up creating a credit bubble in the first place
UK was in a special case anyway
no, you cannot lol
And when you are fucked over by that group you cannot leave or do anything because you are rendered powerless
Curious
Taking debt is voluntary yet usury is a crime
If we want to go there
But well there's Yugoslavia
Soft power also exists
They do force policies on the nation since they joined the EU and its economical scheme, this is effectively crushing the autonomy
Or how the Troika controls nations
Are you aware of the trade rules within the EU
ever heard of defaults
If "lower public spending, increase fiscal revenue to pay more debts" is not enough
I can google for you if that's so hard, yeah
That was barely over 10 years ago do you not really remember
Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal all forced to undertake specific economical policies
Southern Europe countries get gas from northern Africa
There's potential economical benefits to doing nothing instead or align with Russia for several countries
Mainly it's the right thing to do
Not so much for many EU countries providing help, though
There's plenty of economical interests
Yes, it's a proxy war
And yes, planting puppet governments or using force to control a nation is akin to invading it
It's not a small difference it's a pretty damn big difference
Invading or helping someone fight an invasion
There's forceful intervention in a nation to pursue your nation's interests, then there's defending a nation from a foreign attack
Non interventionism is doing nothing in all cases
Not wanting a foreign power to exert their force is not being a non interventionist
It's been doing the same for over a hundred years now
The US has been Russia in most cases
That's not how it works either
Inflation is used as a catch all term but there's different economic phenomena that fit it
No need to default, actually, if you get out of euro to drachma and reissue the debt
Inflation the type of Weimar is quite different from different causes
and other countries in Europe
I mean Japan does work like that
Who said "nil" value
We've had already ridiculous inflation with euro, for countries like Greece without the advantage that comes with your own devalued currency
In fact, under capitalism, inflation is expected and wanted
Would've been for imported goods mostly
The EU absolutely wanted to avoid Greece to leave the euro
Yeah, also having your debt in your own currency means you are in a much better position while the creditors are at a worse position
As you can see, his EU allies actually defended him and the fake data:
https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/24/eu-says-greek-debt-statistics-not-manipulated-in-2010-2015.html
https://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/news/commission-defends-greek-debt-data-after-statistics-scandal/
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-says-greek-debt-statistics-104725299.html
What was the origin of the entire economical problem on Greece? Private debt on banks as explained above. What this doctored report cause? A justification to say the economical problem was public debt, when this problem stems from the state having to cover for the private bank debt as explained above (this is necessary to be in the EU)
You know who manipulated the Greece public deficit numbers? Conversative Kostas Karamanlis, liberal conservative pro-EU party leader
The same people involved in ECB and IMF are also involved with the private banks that were culprits of the Europe's portion of 2008-2010 crisis.
Is joining the EU free? Consider the following:
* The eurozone means there's an economical collaboration in which you can be let out. Then your nation will be ostracised economically.
* Joining has a set of requirements. The ECB and IMF have a set of requirements for your nation to join.
* You join the EU, become a debtor, welcome to the dream.
* And then this happens, you already did the changes asked of you which actually put you in a worse position with no leverage and entirely dependent on credit that they control in a way that they can keep sucking you dry.
Who subtract money mainly from southern European nations using these financial tools
The EU is quite literally an extortion racket for France, Germany and in a minor spot Austria, Switzerland, Benelux
So the same creditors control the interest rates over the legality
Those rankings make debt riskier and thus that debt requires more interest
The same entities forming the credit and asset bubbles in private banks are those who issue the risk ratings for countries and other private entities
By forcing this you make the situation worse and Greece has to pay more
Greek private banks get a line of credit from the ECB, bonds issued by them to the ECB must be covered by the Greek state, to cover for it the Greek state has to borrow from the Troika at terrible conditions
The trick is simple
The EU solution is to use the money from its citizens to pay the private debt from banks operating in unethical or even illegal ways
But they would've have had to pay .(
Those governments are net creditors in the EU and getting all the money
If they defaulted Greece would've paid money but to their citizens, the European Central Bank too; those banks would go under and require help from their own governments
And Greece's public money would've been used to cover insured amount of assets rather than to pay debts
They would've gone under or their governments would have had to pay for them
Insured money is not covered by the banks
Spain has defaulted over 10 times already
Many countries have defaulted many times
the banks have to pay for it and citizen's money is insured
And the population would not pay for it
If they defaulted the private banks would have had to assume a loss for playing with fire
It would've indeed
The countries now have been forced into neoliberal policies
The private banks from France, Germany, etc., get out of the situation at a win
Now the countries have to cut public spending and pay more interest
Troika buys those assets at a discount and transforms private into public debt
Risk is increased, then Greece (and other countries) have to pay more, thus making it even riskier
That's about to burst
We have private banks doing pretty nasty stuff forming a credit and asset bubble
Yet
Yeah the narrative is that Greece is at fault
By the magic of the invisible hand
They believe without a state a full on capitalist world would balance itself fairly
I am not acquainted with American smaller parties, but an ancap country would indeed not have voting since there would not be a public governing structure
Now, what an acceptable tax is may be codified by culture, but what the tax does... is not
If the item is taxed the price is increased by the tax, be it Japan, EU, the US, Aruba or another pacific island
The cultural changes are there and they do not change how that transaction works
You go to the konbini to buy a melonpan or you go to the bread shop to get bread, you give money for the market value of the item and you get the item
Interest rates work the same in Japan as in the EU as in the US as in China
That does not change the effect of a specific economical policy, though
Productive systems may differ in how they are engaged, yes
What is your point exactly
Math is universal
Economical actions are quantifiable measures independent from culture
But well at least since it's all at home there's no hawkish interest trickery like the racketeers at the EU
It has pretty bad implications too since this is used to absorb public money into private hands
Japan is not special it simply has almost double exports than imports which helps a lot when you have a devalued currency and most of its debt is owned by Japan itself
How did we get to that far fetched scenario
With such balance sheets many nations justify the valuation of their central bank issued currency when their economy is simply not good
Value does not have to actually exist to have value
The good thing about fiduciary money is the same as the bad: it's magic
With this you can strengthen the currency if necessary if it is not within acceptable margins
Greece can use its borrowed money to acquire assets such as foreign national debt and bonds
Potentially
Popular consensus is not exactly the best way to go about deciding what's the best course of action
adult tries to dunk on teenager online and gets owned for millions to view
Hehehe

not even going into ideology, they are full of plot holes and continuity errors
preteen books that do not hold up
it's also an entire statement on how systemic change is done when... good guys become cops
But I guess they are better for a bit older audience than the mentioned series
Books by Ursula K Le Guin are great
hahahaha well he never had brains I guess it's truly over for him
China, Vietnam
False
Same as capitalist countries
Same as capitalist countries
Precisely because as data shows, it is not
That doesn't mean a neolib hellhole is the best humanity is capable of
There is no form of perfect government because humans are not perfect and you cannot protect any working system from harm through corruption and other similar means
There's this thing called dialectical materialism
Using, of course, statistical accounts and historical facts
Care to explain the flaws
That your arguments sound the same because they are quite the same, baseless demagogy
The USSR was already heavily industrialised and a main power before ww2
Your only arguments is recycled neoliberal talking points out of American late night Fox TV talk programs tbh
and they won ww2
Russian empire was entirely destroyed and poor by the end of ww1
There has not been any such a transformation in the entire history of humankind
From poor farmer nations to world powers - it's shit
XD
Baffling how neoliberals are even worse than the father of capitalism
Adam Smith called landlords parasites
There is a reason a revolution happened
Yes, but we are talking they were still fucked when everyone else was not
Russian system was 100 to 200 years behind the rest of European nations
The entirety of Europe did not work like that, though
Worse: the only reason the west got social advantages was because capitalism HAD to compete with communist sphere of influence through welfare
The average citizen of the Russian empire was, to put it in simple terms, utterly fucked
Russia was a feudal state with fiefs in 1900 where people were basically slaves
as if there were no commerce nor labour systems under communism
true, there's this misconception that communism is the exact opposite of capitalism
which could've been done by anyone smart if they didn't have to work for their survival
as well as having rich people bored enough to pursue science
Both modern computers and the internet exists due to public funded investigation and development
Computers are not really a product of capitalism
Pretty sure there's no russification on Marx's works
And then there's the nationalist movements, many problems in the sphere of influence of the soviet union were rather Russian ethnonationalism problems
Not disregarding actual acts that happened, the capitalist propaganda has been magnifying or inventing such things for their own gain
We can name a list of atrocities by western capitalist powers that not only rival but shadow the _rumoured, unproven_ atrocities by communist states
Capitalist neoliberals used terrorism and the army to break the Soviet Union
Additionally, fall of soviet union was due to liberalisation of it, American aligned actors and a coup d'etat where they bombed the parliament equivalent
all conspiracy theories about the US seem to be just that until the classified documents are unclassified by law
sorry had to mention it
Late to the party but MK Ultra
And unlimited means unlimited requests which may or may not be granted, the social pressure and office dynamics notwithstanding
Unlimited time off is a trap and it effectively diminishes time off
That position and red circle on the border makes it quite clear
Ah yeah 10 man for having a baby but the hospital fee is already higher
Kishida says this shit and does nothing to fix it except for printing some money that solves basically nothing
Most of content writing jobs could go way of the dodo and just have copys that fix gpt shit
quite a worrying development though
honestly the difference in quality will be nonexistent
was fun to be around tho
to be fair Spain's been like that many times to no avail
