<@&458048859910832149> We had a low turnout this week, which means we have a long week of waiting until the next prompts. **Except it's time for our surprise bonus round!** That's right! We're launching directly into the next cycle of writing! Your feedback has been read, prompt suggestions have been considered, and here we are! Once again we have 3 options to choose from, and this time, *multiple entries are allowed!* That's right, if you really love two different suggestions, you can, if you want, write two prompts! The deadline will be ***Monday*** night at 11:59 PDT. As always, page limit is 2-3 pages!

But that's not what you're here for, right? You're here for `The Prompts`. So let's get to it!

1)
```Some of the characters in Symphogear escape without sufficient penance for their actions shown on-screen. Show us at least one character paying a price for what they did: Jail, community service, exile, or something else.```
2)
```Alternate Universe: Ex-villain becomes a gear user. How does the first deployment go down?```
3)
```A friendly argument becomes heated. Very heated. What is it, and what happens?```
There you are! Three different topics, and as a special note, Prompt #3 does *not* have to be Symphogear related, though you might get better feedback if the audience knows the context of the submission! Happy writing! (Or not so happy...)

Greetings all! I have been authorized to reveal to you that, unfortunately, your moderation staff are not perfect. This was formerly a big secret, but we do actually sleep. After careful observation of server activity, we discovered that those from Europe and Australia are mysteriously awake during our sleep periods. The only conclusion is that people from these areas *do not* sleep! We have decided to harness this power for good, and have brought onboard <@290431224596660224> as a member of the <@&336301943179968514> ! Please treat him kindly, but also heed his wise words of moderation.
<@&458048859910832149> This is a special edition of writing prompts, hosted (at this point) by *me*!  Symphogear writers, the format has been switched up just a bit for this week! The topics are going to be more specific this time, but you get to choose **1** out of **3**! You must base your prompt, in some fashion, on at least one. Page length is still 2-3, and the deadline is Sunday night at 11:59 PM PDT, though if you miss it by a few hours that'll probably be okay. 

The topics?
```Game show
Travel
Black```

Artistic interpretations are okay! Good luck!

Nevermind, <#469534906150551552> is the place to be!
@everyone Ibu's Jackbox party time in 5 minutes! Watch <#336297387863703552> for more details.
<@&458048859910832149> Hey all! Now that the Symphogear G rewatch is complete, it's time for another round of prompts! The rules are largely the same as last time, with the focus this time on examining and enhancing the second season!

The focus this time is on examining the second season of Symphogear, and seeing if we can't improve it! The three prompts:

```*Bonus Footage: Add a scene to Symphogear G, or shortly after Symphogear G! Character didn't get the development you wanted? Give them some! Idea for a fun extra episode? Want to write a retcon that shakes the entire meaning of the season? Share it!

*Alternate Universe cut: Retell a scene or scenario in Symphogear G where something's altered or changed, or was changed in the past. Maybe Hibiki had to defeat the noise at the Tokyo Sky Tower by herself! Maybe Hibiki's arm never grew back. Maybe Maria really was Fin√©. Surprise us!

*THE HERO(?)'S MASTER PLAN: A lot of things in Symphogear G didn't go the way any of the cast members expected them to. What was Dr. Ver really planning, from the start? Write or draw an in-character journal or document detailing what was supposed to happen from Dr. Ver's perspective.```
As before, please write a 2-4 page piece on one of the three prompts, due in my PMs by midnight June 16, PST. Ish. Don't worry if you're unsure exactly when that is.

SPECIAL EXCEPTION: For the third prompt, you have the option to supplement or replace the written content with a .png, .jpg, or .gif of a hand-made 'master plan,' but it must be either scanned or photographed physical media, or created in Microsoft Paint or a similarly simple program. It must still try to be in-character.

Hello all! The symphogear rewatch recently finished the first season, and to celebrate, we're having a new edition of Writing Prompts!

For newer users, Writing Prompts is a (semi-)recurring event we have here for the writers and aspiring writers in our community, where users submit small stories in response to a prompt and they're posted to the community, semi-anonymously (by me) to be read and discussed, with a slant towards helpful writing feedback. It's also just fun!

Since many of us have had our minds refreshed on season 1, the theme of this edition of Writing Prompts will be Senki Zesshou Symphogear Season One, Director's Cut! Pick one of the following :

```*Bonus Footage: Add a scene to season one, or shortly after season one! Character didn't get the development you wanted? Give them some! Idea for a fun extra episode? Share it!

*Alternate Universe cut: Retell a scene or scenario where something's altered or changed, or was changed in the past. Maybe Miku's at the concert instead of Hibiki. Maybe Hibiki DID get kidnapped by Chris. Maybe the villain is someone else.

*Cutting room floor: Season's one ending has a lot of controversy.  Some make the accusation that it was originally going to play out differently but they changed their minds late into production. Write how you think the ending scene(s) could or should have gone!```
The rules are pretty simple. Write 2-4 pages on one of the three topics and PM it to me (in google docs or something works fine) with a deadline(ish) of Midnight PST, Sunday June 2nd. They'll be discussed in <#357682999300718592> one a day, ideally a day or so after they were submitted. 

And while you're at it, keep your eyes open in G for stories, just in case this ends up being a recurring thing. <:BikkiWink:391790927082946560>

First commercial for XV! 
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1128670692118028290?s=09
Hey everyone! XV's just around the corner, and the hype-building community rewatch to go through all 4 seasons of Symphogear starts **tomorrow**!! The plan is one episode a day, with discussion threads going up on reddit at 6pm EST!  Feel free to watch privately at your convenience, but if you're interested in joining the server collective rewatch (hosted and administered by <@!127644949884698624> ), that'll start at 9pm EST! Discussion will happen in <#576238192555065374> (with a spoiler policy of nothing beyond the most recently viewed episode!)

On a technical note, if you're going to be joining the live server rewatch on cytube, you'll want to install tampermonkey from https://tampermonkey.net/ and then cytube's google drive userscript from https://cytu.be/google_drive_userscript.
Hello all! I'd just like to touch on a little point related to rule 1 really briefly! "Don't be a dick!" This typically extends to direct attacks against another user, or groups of users, but can manifest in different ways. Arguing in bad faith is one such example! While we encourage debates and discussions about difficult subjects (preferably in <#336297840529899522> ), we do so with the expectation that people join in with the intent to educate, be educated, and take stances with at least some modicum of awareness of the topics they're talking about. 

There is a lot of leeway on this! Don't feel like you can't participate in discussions. But also remember that purposefully and maliciously using bad faith arguments is not permitted on this server.

Thanks, and sorry for wasting your time with stuff y'all probably already know. <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
Friendly reminder to mute <#377148557796442134> if you want to dodge Endgame spoilers as they will be permitted in there <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Due to a rise of mobile gaming/gacha discussion in <#337805317276565525> in the last few months, we're going to be opening a new channel to give a better discussion ground for all your rare pulls or game updates! Say hello to <#567740255273222175> !
<@&458048859910832149> Sorry for the delay, we're back again! I'll get right into it: Same rules as before. 2-4 page submission, due sunday night my time. 500 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> per entry. Pick one of three prompts below to base it on!

```1) S2/SONG is deployed to a trouble spot, but they discover a never seen before gear when they get there!
2) A secret comes out: A major character has been wearing a wig *the entire time!* Show us the discovery or the fallout.
3) Snow has arrived! The characters get into a snowball fight, but it turns serious. Tell us how they fight to win at any cost.```

Also look forward to two older entries that haven't been posted yet, coming soon!

<@&458048859910832149> Hello all and sorry for the delay! I'm on a vacation ( <:MikuGay:336656810788388864> ), and sadly didn't have the time to sit down and come up with prompts. Luckily, <@297542051057238017> stepped up and offered these!

rules this time: 2-4 page limit, due PMed to me by sunday night pacific time. 500 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> for valid submissions. 

```1: Something that happened before everything started for the main characters, could be in the distant past or closer to the present, wherever your imagination takes you. In other words: a prequel.

2: Something that happens after series, can be a next generation-type thing, or what the main characters are doing now, or whatever you think of. in other words: a sequel.

3: A moment from a similar world to the main one, except there's something different about it, something has happened differently in this world, whether that's a change to the backstory, someone who died survives, or something else, it must have differences from the original. In other words: An Alternate Universe/What-if fic.```

You can write a snippet or a scene, and <@297542051057238017> has suggeted using at least one original Gear in your work, which I think is a neat idea! However, that will be purely optional, and you will get 500 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> whether you use one or not.

<@&458048859910832149> After a ~~not~~ small delay, it's time for the next round of prompts! The time of the year is upon us, the most terrifying time, with the most terrifying prompts!

This is the final week with the extra conditions. This week? The scariest one of them all! 

`You must include a self-insert OC. It does not have to be literally you, but it must represent you, the author, in some way.`

A complete submission, 2-4 pages in length, that satisfies the condition while being about one of the below prompts will earn you 600 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> ! A partial submission that merely satisfies the below prompts will earn you 200.

So what are the prompts?
```1. Isekai! Someone(s) has been transferred to another world!
2. Someone is seeing and/or hearing hallucinations. Perhaps they're from stress, or other mental causes, or perhaps they're externally influenced.
3. Family reunion! At least one character is required to meet up with extended or estranged family - whether they like it or not.```

The deadline is this Sunday at 11:59...ish. There's clock resets and whatnot happening, so it's fine if you're a bit late. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921> PM me your submission when complete!
<@&458048859910832149> October rolls on! We emerge from the depths of corporate sponsorship to dive deeper into fanfic nightmares!

Rules are the same as usual. 2-4 pages, due Sunday night at 11:59 PM PST, about one of the following 3 subjects! PM them to me when complete.

```1. A wedding! Whether participating or attending, show us the magical day.
2. A villain reveals their ultimate plans! Everyone loves a good monologue, and everyone loves reacting to it.
3. Sleepover! Some characters are having a party. What's the gossip and what's the fun times had?```

But, of course, there is the extra condition for this week:

`Crack Crossover!`

That's right, to get the sweet, sweet accolades of your peers and 600 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> in your pocket, you need to do a crossover with Symphogear and something entirely inappropriate! Symphogear x Big Bang Theory! Symphogear x King of the Hill! Symphogear x Frozen! Symphogear x Jersey Shore! There is no rung too low to climb, and you're encouraged to get wacky.

If you don't feel like trying for the extra condition, your prompt will still be accepted and discussed, but you will get a smaller payout of 200 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> . The focus for this month is on the extra conditions, but I don't want to exclude anyone.

If you have questions about anything, please contact me directly!

<@&458048859910832149> Another week, another prompt! We still have a few submissions left in the queue that will be coming out in the next day or two, but that doesn't mean you can't start on the next!

Same rules as before. Write a story based on one of the three prompts offered, **2-4** pages long, with the latest you can turn it in being 11:59 PST this Sunday. The choices?
```1. An origin story! Tell us about a character's roots.
2. Betrayal! Maybe it's mind control, maybe someone was harboring bad intentions all along, but a good person is now a bad person! Write about it.
3. Competition. At least two people have decided that they are going to have a contest of skill or luck to determine an outcome. Tell us about it.```
Of course, we are still in *The Month of Fanfic Nightmares*, and once again there is an **extra condition** to make things a little more... horrifying:

`The story must contain enough product placement in it that the readers will suspect the author is getting endorsement fees from corporations.`

Perhaps it'll be an extensive use of a single product with characters advertising its benefits, or perhaps you'll endeavor to namedrop as many household names as possible, but at the end of the day, it should feel like you are, for lack of a better term, a 'sell-out'.

Attempting to satisfy the extra condition will net you 600 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> ! If you choose to submit without it, you will still be featured in the review cycle, but receive much fewer <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> to be determined at my discretion. And I'll be sad. <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>

<@&458048859910832149> It's a new month, and a new style of Writing Prompts! From here on out, we're changing our biweekly format - one week writing, one week reviewing - into a single, sleeker format! *Every* week will have a new prompt now, and submissions will put up for feedback within a 24h period, or placed in a queue to take place the day(s) after, if there is already one scheduled for the next day.

But that's not the only change! As a little thank you for participating in our weekly server event, the first submission you send in each week will earn you 600 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>! You can also get small amounts of <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> from time to time by participating in feedback!

Enough about the format change. Let's talk about this week's prompt! The rules are mostly the same. Write a **2-4** page story about one of the three following topics and PM it to me by the end of next Sunday, PST. The topics?
```1. Climactic battle against a past or future Symphogear villain! 
2. A romantic date!
3. Someone getting reprimanded for something they did or didn't do! ```
Here's the catch, though: In October, every week will have *an additional requirement*. You are encouraged to be as cheesy and terrible as you wish, as long as you follow this requirement. Following it is **mandatory.** This week?

`Between 50% and 100% of the characters in your story must be as 'Goth' as you are capable of making them.`

Yes. I'm serious. Welcome... *to the Month of Fanfic Nightmares...*

It's time again! Season 8 of writing prompts! This will be the last prompt under this format, as we will be swapping to something *mysterious* for the next cycle! For now, though, rules are the same. Write a story or story fragment 2-3 pages, send it to me by Sunday night (PST), and we'll spend the next week talking about them! The catch is it has to be about one of these topics!

```1) Road trip! Characters have to travel from place to place in a confined space. Tell us about why, or what's going on inside the vehicle. Does not have to be Symphogear related!

2) Setting challenge! SONG HQ is a major element of the show, yet the fact it is a mobile submarine is frequently neglected. Tell a story where the aquatic nature of the base is highlighted.

3) SONG has been deployed to mitigate extreme weather disasters! Can the girls help? Can they even save themselves from nature's wrath?! Show us!```

Good luck!

<@&458048859910832149> It's time for season 7 of *Prompts*. Once again, as a refresher: Three topics, you must choose at least one and write 2-3 pages based on it. Multiple submissions are allowed, as long as you choose different topics for your submissions. PM them to me when complete! Your deadline is Sunday at 11:59 PM, with a tiny bit of leniency for late submissions.

I know, I know. You want me to get to the topics. Here they are:
1) `The UN has decided SONG should double as PR. The girls are now celebrities, as heroes! Write a scene of one, some, or all of them dealing with being under a camera lens.`

2) `Elfnein has designed a new upgrade or piece of equipment. Show it in action.`

3) `Conspiracy. Whether it's two friends hiding the fact they ate a roommate's lunch, or an organization of hundreds wrapping shadowy fingers around the future of the world, it's a constant element of humanity. Show us a conspiracy in action, or someone conspiring. Is not required to be Symphogear-related.`

Have fun and good luck!

DiscoTek's Symphogear season 1 release is now available for preorder! Supposedly it has new translations and has stuff that might not have ever been translated before! Plus, it's a way to show western interest in the franchise!

However, please understand that these are Region A Blurays and they are not likely to work outside of the Americas, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.
Hello all! We've finally gotten around to updating the server rules and guidelines. Please check them when you have a chance! While nothing has dramatically changed, things are a little better spelled out now. As usual, feedback on them goes in <#336299268107403274> .
While it's fun to play around with emotes and make jokes, please be aware that some of them are hand drawn art by users here.

Attempting to use them to create jokes designed to disgust other users or make them uncomfortable is disrespectful to those artists and you are formally asked to be responsible with them.
Happy birthday to Amou Kanade!
As an aside, regretfully the server game Symphogear RV is closed with no plans to revive it.
Please give your love and thanks to the FIS bot trio for helping us out for the last two years. We will be moving to a different administration bot going forward, though it may take us a bit to get everything fully running again.
Congrats to Nana Mizuki on her marriage!

Hi all! I'm sure most or all of you do a great job of keeping your PC sanitary and free of viruses etc, but recently an old discord trojan has been updated to be a bit nastier than it was before. Forbes has an article about it here: <https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2020/05/25/warning-malware-steal-discord-passwords/>

However, if you just want to check if you have it and move on with your life, this part of the article is all you need to know:
Also happy birthday to our wonderful staff member, <@!106866895076003840> ! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>

It's been asked that people stop impersonating other users with nicknames. Please abide by this. Nicknames directly spoofing another user or impersonating them will be reset.
Hello everyone! Today/Tomorrow, depending on time zone, is a most special day! Kirika Akatsuki's birthday!

<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017> 

On the server, we like to do small things for the girls on their birthday. Kirika's birthday is, perhaps, a bigger deal than most, so I asked her what she wanted. Turns out she thought Miku's birthday was really fun, and begged us to let her name the channels.

We agreed.

I'm sorry.
There's been an update of the rules of the subreddit, if you are a user of the subreddit please check the post detailing the changes.

You all also have a 100mb upload limit to files on the server - please keep any uploads related to the channel they're posted in.

And finally, we have a custom url! After a quick tally of suggestions, two reign supreme! Please vote in emotes below:

And finally, oh my gosh. Thank you everyone who boosted this server, thank you everyone who hangs out here to make the server worth boosting, and thank you all for making the Symphogear community so fun to be in.
After our 2-day war, the results are finally in! While both sides had vocal support, the server has decisively sided with Carol. The birthday remains hers and hers alone, and she will keep the banner at the top of the server channel list.

Elfnein didn't take the news very well, but Carol ended up taking pity on the poor girl and spent some quality time with her, cooking up some alchemically-enhanced candies for them both to enjoy. In the end, both were happy.

Thank you all for celebrating her birthday!
Additionally, special thanks to <@!106866895076003840> for letting us use her art for the server birthday icon!
March 3rd is a special day! It's the birthday of one of the greatest threats to the world of Symphogear, Carol Malus Dienheim! While preparing for her party, though, Elfnein declared, "I want a birthday! It should be my birthday!" 

So it is time for a war.

Both of them are turning to the people of this server for help! Below this message will be two reactions, one for Carol, one for Elfnein. Selecting one will grant you a role and a color that will last 2 days, and you cannot have both roles! At the end of those two days, we will count up which character has the most members under their role, and they will have the spot of the Server Birthday Banner at the top of the channel list!

The Birthday Battle of the Alchemists has begun! <:germain:609728369399037953>

As server staff, we wish you all a happy 2020!

It's a most wonderful time of year! Symphogear is a cast of many characters, almost all of whom go through hardships to find a better life. But perhaps one of the characters that struggles the most, who fought the hardest to move forward from a life of misery and self-rejection to a life of openness, friends, and heroism, is the gun-toting firecracker, Yukine Chris.

Today/Tomorrow, depending on your timezone, is her birthday, and I invite all to celebrate with <#658798535734591540> , a new and temporary art channel. This one's a bit special - in honor of her journey to find happiness, ***only images of Chris smiling can be posted.*** (SFW only, please, everyone should get to celebrate) She can be with other characters, she can be alone in the picture, but ***she must be smiling.***
Commentary in the channel is fine, but it is against the rules of the channel to post comments that would make Chris sad! Violation of the channel rules will result in loss of ability to post in it.

Congratulations on how far you've made it, Chris, and Happy Birthday.
Symphogear Live 2020 has been announced for September 13, 2020
As Christmas and Christmas Eve roll across the globe, Merry Christmas to everyone!

Hi all! The zesshoushinai OVA episodes are beginning to come out, though are not subtitled yet! There's a new channel, <#652243263117459458> , to talk about them so people don't have to dance around spoilers in <#336310266654490624> ! Please keep conversation there until subtitles come out.
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1197799848977817600
Also as a birthday present to Miku we have let her be Custodian-For-The-Day! Please forgive her of any disruptions to your normal server activities
Hi all! Hey, I normally don't post XDU related stuff here, but this one is weird enough I feel the greater symphogear community should at least be aware of it:

Symphogear XDU is having a collab event. With Godzilla.

Yeah, I don't know why or how either, but it's a thing!

It's over! The XV spoiler policy has ended. You may now treat XV spoilers like any other spoilers on the server - keep them out of <#336297387863703552> but they're otherwise fine to discuss.

I'm not going to talk like Symphogear is fully over, but I have enjoyed XV's airtime immensely and you all were a big part of it, thank you!

**Bonus:** The server is now looking for XV-specific emojis, particularly of antagonists! While the best emojis usually come from the shinais, if you see something you think will work, drop it in <#336299268107403274> ! There will be a 500 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> bounty on each emote accepted for a few weeks. As a small reminder, server policy only accepts emotes that are sourced from official materials or have artist consent to being used as an emote.
The bingewatch mentioned above at <https://s.kast.gg/g/0fb1b0vlm2> will be starting in about 10 minutes! It should be running for about 6-7 hours so don't be afraid to tune in partway through! I'm told it'll be covering season 1 of symphogear!
<@183270924701794305> is hosting a symphogear bingewatch at October 20 8AM CEST! It'll be hosted at <https://s.kast.gg/g/0fb1b0vlm2> ! As I understand it they plan to play all of the episodes, so if that interests you, check it out!

Note that this isn't being run by server staff, so it'll be up to you all to be on your best behavior, or otherwise listen to Kuro.

On a related note!

**This will be the final weekend that the XV spoiler policy for the server is in full effect.** If you want to catch up before channels like <#336310266654490624> or <#336297674707828747> become okay to discuss XV in, now might be the final best time to do so.
Happy birthday to Serena!
Hello all! It's time for another round of <@&458048859910832149> ! For those unaware, this is a happens-sometimes server event where the writers and aspiring writers of the server are challenged to write a short scene or story in response to one of several prompts. 

As before, the amount is 2-5 pages, and this time your deadline is the end of the 21st of October! After you send it (in a PM to me), they'll be uploaded to <#357682999300718592> anonymously so people can give helpful praise, feedback, criticism, and appreciation! Credit can be claimed at the author's discretion, along with a full list of who did what at the end of the period. 

In a slight break of our normal pattern, the prompts can be found in <#357682999300718592> as a pinned post, to avoid potential XV spoilers. Special thanks this time goes out to Emily/Rakhi for coming up with two of the prompts!

Not a part of our writing circle? Feel free to join! type dess_iam Writing Prompts in <#448237561085952001> and join the discussion in <#357682999300718592> !
As of today, <@106866895076003840> is helping, even more than she has already, to keep this community positive and inclusive! Please welcome her as the newest staff member and listen to her wise suggestions. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
As foretold, <#357682999300718592> is now open ground for discussing XV content as it may pertain to creative works or planning them out.
Hi all! This is just a heads up that in 24 hours or so, <#357682999300718592> will be added to the group of channels that XV spoilers are okay in.  If you want to avoid them, please mute the channel before that time period is up!
Symphogear XV is over! Perhaps this is the end of the ride, perhaps not; only time will tell. Thank everyone for being a great community and for being great to each other. This server will be here for you as long as you want to talk about Symphogear. <:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697> 

Believe in the song of your heart!

`And yes, I know some of you are waiting for better subs. Bless your strength of will.`

As a final note, the countdown clock on the expiration of the spoiler grace period has started, but it is, for the next month, still in effect.
Hello! Slight update to the spoiler policy! You're now highly encouraged to post any art pertaining to XV, particularly the latest episodes, into <#601872369660854272> ! If, for some reason, you decide you really need to post any XV art in a different channel, it absolutely must be spoilered and clearly marked for XV, with episode number if possible. Failing to do this will result in losing access to post in channels that are not spoiler-okay.

Self-made fanart can still be posted into <#357682999300718592> but please be extra careful about tagging spoilers!
Happy Birthday, Maria! To celebrate, SONG has allocated some of its recreation budget to her discretion, letting her host <#608052141969375272> ! She got added help in the setup this year, but something went terribly wrong! The coveted SerenaCon tickets got lost in delivery! 

If you figure out how to find one of them, please drop in to make Maria happy and celebrate her favorite little sister! <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Happy birthday to a very important girl, Amou Kanade!

While the tragedy at Kyoto Animation Studio 1 is tragic and still unfolding, please keep the discussion limited to <#336297840529899522> for now. I'm seeing discussion in three different channels -- as well as all over the rest of the net -- and it's important for people's mental health to have spaces where they can avoid thinking about tragedy until they're ready to engage on it on their terms.

On that note, condolences to KyoAni studios, the animation industry, and artists at large for the attack.

XV IS ALMOST HERE! I'm sure we're all super excited! ***All Symphogear XV discussion and analysis must be confined to <#431914167826382860> .*** In addition, any art, fanart, or fancontent produced and shared in their relevant channels that is related to anything in an XV episode ***must be spoiler tagged***. This policy will be in enforced effect until one month after the final episode of XV airs.

<#336310266654490624> is *not* an acceptable place to discuss theories that involve XV content until that period has passed.

Small exception for any XV content that is added to XDU, which may be discussed freely in <#336298054724485131> without spoiler tags.

All XV screenshots that are definitively XV also need to be spoilered unless they are in <#431914167826382860> .
<@&458048859910832149> Heya all! With GX completed in the rewatch, it's time for another session of Writing Prompts! GX has all sorts of highs and lows and interesting, beloved and hated characters.

So let's write about it, expand it, change it, or even fix it! Choose one of the three prompts to work with.

```1. Bonus Scene! We don't get a lot of time with many of the characters in GX. Show interactions that happen off-screen, or between shots. Maria and Kirika shopping? Garie and Leiur chatting? Why not? Sky's the limit.
2. Alternate Universe: Write a scene from GX, but something's fundamentally changed. 
3. The Big Fix: Write an outline of GX, redoing the overall structure and/or events. Bonus points if you keep things actually in GX, like Carol and the Autoscorers, or her general goal. If possible, break down what episode has what, but if you just want to have a bullet point list of events, that's okay too!```
We're having a little bit of a rule change, you can now submit **2-5** pages. The due date is midnight at the end of the month (or a tiny bit later, it's no big deal if it shows up in my DMs the next day)

hello!! staff here. We're going to try an update to the server to reflect some needs we've witnessed lately. To summarize briefly: we are doubling the amount of live/shitposting channels on the server. We will add a new channel - for now it will just be called <#977744682035605514> - that functions like the current channel, except without NSFW allowed. Feel free to give frequent live updates on the game you're playing or anime you're watching, or post the dankest of memes, if you wish.

The old live-shitposting channel will be renamed <#407060923078017026>, to reflect that NSFW content is permitted there. If the anime you're watching has girls clothes mysteriously dissolve on a regular basis, or you've got a funny meme about dildos, this might be the channel to post in. If you just want to use it because someone's already liveposting in the other channel, or it just feels more homey, that's okay too!

A few points, briefly: 
\*These channels are somewhat 'anything goes,' outside of violating global server rules. There are no rules on spoilers or anything, but please try to be considerate of what's going on at the moment - shouting off a spoiler about an anime someone's watching may be kind of a dick move in the wrong context, which isn't okay. But, at the same time, if you're encouraging people to talk about the 10 year old show/game you're digging into, and something slips, please try to be understanding that you opened the floor up to the discussion.

\*There is no limit on who is 'using' a channel. If someone's posting screenshots of their game every two minutes, and then someone else decides to use that channel to start posting screenshots and reacting to an anime, or spews up a few spicy memes that everyone starts talking about, that isn't against the rules. If it bothers *you,* you can consider moving to the other liveposting channel, if both you and your content are of the right age, or wait till later.

\*Just as in live-shitposting previously, <#407060923078017026> is is really supposed to be 'NSFW-lite.' Hardcore porn or being horny at other members, or other similar conduct that makes people uncomfortable, may be better off in <#336297808221044736> or perhaps not on this server.

\*With these changes it is expected of you all that image-heavy dumping in channels like <#337805317276565525> or <#371105434771390465> will cease. Do them in these new channels, please.

Special thanks to Lily White for the art used for the server icon today!
Happy Birthday Chris! As celebration we're bringing back <#658798535734591540> , which is a channel with the restrictive posting condition of only posting *Safe for work* images where Chris is *happy or smiling.*
(Thank you Lily for the image alteration)
From all of Staff,

The padorus have invaded the servers emotes! They've taken several hostage, and those will not currently be available. In the mean time, though, the padorus are here!
Streaming in voice chat is now enabled. Please use responsibly.

Additionally, after carefully considering feedback and the current state of the server, a change has been made:
Hey all, small update to the rules: In response to some events that have occurred over the last month, and in pursuit in preserving a space that people feel comfortable in, we've explicitly forbidden politically and socially charged content in <#336297808221044736>. This includes things such as race play or lesbian conversion kinks. This is not intended as a condemnation of people who enjoy this content, merely a firm request they not be shared in this space.

In addition, we re-iterate the request to spoiler tag and put content warnings on more extreme content, including non-consent.

Official spinoff manga about daily life and cooking will be web-serialized
Hey friendly reminder that <#384870333620027403> is *not* an 18+ channel and that memes that rely on sexual content to work are not fit for it. <#407060923078017026> is 18+ if you need to post something with that kind of edge.
Commands go in <#847845345273839616> !

Hello all! Quick update on XDU materials: If you come across material that has not yet been added to the game or posted on the official Symphogear/XDU Twitter accounts (or other media), please handle it as a spoiler and put it behind relevant tags. This applies to both XDU channels and more general symphogear discussions.

(Alternatively, consider not posting it at all, as spreading leaks can have bad effects, but using spoiler tags is the minimum I'll ask of you)
Kirika says it's her birthday, so she wants the channel names she picked back. Shirabe is glaring at me until I do it. I'm sorry.
Special thanks to <@!106866895076003840> for creating art for the server's transition into this new age!
<a:Susphogear:826967918548877382>
Due to a falling off of public interest in Symphogear, and a renewed interest in Among Us, this server will be rebranding. Try out the new Airship map today!
Special thanks to <@!106866895076003840> for the beautiful server avatar!
I know a lot of people are very excited about the Nintendo direct! Once it starts airing, please move all discussion about it and related announcements to <#377148557796442134> until an hour after it ends.
It's Shirabe's birthday! As a result, we're giving you all the opportunity to celebrate with her by clicking on the Shirabe emoji under this post to get a birthday role that will color you Shirabe Pink!

The moon can't shine without the sun, though, and Kirika begged to help make Shirabe's birthday better, so you can click on the Kirika emoji to turn Igalima green, and turn the server into a green and pink wonderfuland! (Note: You can only have one color.)

The colors are temporary, and will be removed in around 48 hours for you automatically, so you do not need to worry about turning them off.

As it is Chris' birthday, I'm reopening a special channel dedicated to her happiness: <#658798535734591540> ! Posting in the channel is simple: All images must be SFW, and *all images must have Chris smiling.* Enjoy!
Merry Christmas, everyone! Have a good time and stay safe!

Hello! This is still getting polished as an idea, but it's now december, which means `padoru` time! Due to this and just being tired of having too few emote slots (250 is not enough!) I'm opening the first of what may be a series of Official‚Ñ¢Ô∏è r/Symphogear emote servers! 

I recognize that not everyone can fully benefit from emote servers, which is why when new emotes are suggested, they will be curated with consideration for replacing another emote on this server first, before being considered for an emote server. If I could squeeze more emotes onto the server for non-nitro users to use, believe me when I say I would.

If you have more emote suggestions for the emote servers, you can use <#336299268107403274> as always, though please note I may be temporarily slow in helping with that.

Dicaido voted for Rakhi

lynching the wrong person puts them 2 steps closer
No lynch
I side towards no lynch but can possibly be persuaded if someone has a good argument
option A has the benefit of maybe hitting a mafia, but may lose us a useful role
So we could guess someone at random or choose to not lynch anyone
Ok, don't know how I missed that
So am I right in counting 5 remaining?
scrmz had experience playing the game and isn't an illogical first pick
Does anyone have anything interesting to share

ohio minna-san
Shirabe could have possibly killed themselves though why I don't know
~~R are you giving roles to people outside of town~~
Or the whole thing is solved by you being mafia and lying about it
Which means that whoever is the actual vigilante is keeping quiet about it, unless we're in some weird hell where Mafia can be vigilantes (???)
Oh, right, good point
yeah, you did
so I think Shirabe might be the vigilante
I do find it really interesting the vigilante isn't speaking up
I think that's a possibility
I think so
If we accept that Iori's the doctor, then some sort of mafia mindgame doesn't make sense here, because I couldn't target myself knowing I'd be saved
I'm the cop and Shirou's mafia
then let me drop my bomb, and let the fact that the mafia was targetting me be weight
Ok
No one's going to contest Iori, then? If Iori was lying, the real doctor would know
Anyway, if the doctor feels brave enough to tell us who they were targetting, that would give us extra information
Do we have a dispenser of justice here who wishes to not skulk in the night but let us know of their self-determined actions
no, Iori's
Iori, I'm most interested in your opinion here
well, except from me, apparently
It's not, but they were under no suspicion
Interesting! Considering that I, just tonight, investigated Tsubasa, who was clearly a Mafia. What an *interesting* development.
I swear if there's a camoflauge rule I'll be annoyed
Shirou
yea
It was me because the alternative is to sit around waiting for someone to talk and get fingers pointed at and get really bored in the meantime
which means it's either Iori is lying or I'm *probably telling the truth*
Okay let's remember that either Iori is lying or the mafia targetted me
Lily, who is clean
The second night, yes
about him being mafia, at least
I don't know why I was trying to catch him out, I already know the truth lmao
where were you told this
unless they tried to kill someone who had protection against it somehow
My vote echoes Iori's, whatever that may be.

Iori, I will vote whoever you vote for, even if it is for me. I cannot be trusted, but hopefully the information I have given you, *wrong as it may be,* might be useful to you.

what if, indeed, my very perceptions of reality have been compromised
I know I'm not mafia, but what if I'm wrong about everything else
what if there's a third option
Do you think I'm sane?
Iori I trust you more than myself
I don't think lying is the only possibility here
I'm pretty sure I know the answer but can't bring myself to say it
My obviously 100% reliable, totally accurate investigation that pinned Tsubasa as mafia on the night she was murdered
That is... what my investigation revealed, yes

that is not a bike that is a girl <:thonk:824436307186024488>

the long black thrusters? tubes? on her hips
seeing the giant spears on her sides makes me think of my favorite part of Kanade's normal gear

and thus Latooni learned his new friends were capable of batshit plans
I feel like that's a pertinent question
can I ask about whether any personality conflicts have happened behind the curtain before
what are the key permission differences between the roles
ü§î
oh my god so much backlog to read
I mean, assuming Alice is correct and everyone gets input
the difference at the top is judicial
I don't know if it's nitpicking, but saki's already in prime position to gain legislative experience
I wish the little ballot books they mailed out before elections were this interesting
and he's the only one who can answer if he can do that
I think R's experience would be very valuable but he'll have to push himself to grow in these matters to be the right pick
this is the polar opposite from the breath of the wild server where there's no hierarchy and the server owner and literally every other active mod besides me are on fucking vacation
is that about it
but for that you need **THE COUNCIL**
The server's growing and to deal with that you're laying the groundwork of a better moderating system, so that not only can the moderators do a better job, but, especially with the possible need to gain more moderators, there's a system in place to watch the watchmen
so let me sum up exactly what's going on here so I make sure I know what's going on and what I'm doing before I exercise my newfound and unexpected vote
And I don't mean Alice, I mean other people on the server who do not have power over you
The question I have to ask is when you're at your worst, can you trust people enough to listen to them when they tell you you're crossing a line?
though I am touched by your willingness to share
I'm not really concerned how bad you can be
reins on the reigns, as it were
reins
I see, and in a way, your experience works against you there, because you feel like you *know the way* and it pushes you even if you might not be in the right
Has this been a pattern in your life in other places and times?
I'm honestly more interested in hearing R's concerns about himself over anyone else's, I think
Okay I don't really like dredging up this shit, but to me, R has displayed a ~~determination to fist~~ dedication to improving the server, he's been here for a while and is still obviously looking to enrich the community, and he seems nice enough, if eccentric.

With that and his seniority, he seems like an obvious pick even though saki is a solid dude and my fair tomodachi with the knowledge that I have available to me

So I have to ask... what *exactly* is everyone, including R, scared of happening here that skew the votes so sharply
anyway I'm still readin
yeah 3 weeks ago
If I'm not a boy, I'm so boy-adjacent that I don't feel like it's worth my time to do anything about it
I get that they all found themselves happier after coming out, but... idk. I had to tell them to stop eventually
The first few times I didn't mind but it began to grate on me, like my friends weren't satisfied that I could be a boy and not believe in traditional masculinity
I've been accused of being an egg a lot
*History of the world, Part 1*
I see the server has a dark and varied past
>`Mafia`
naruhodo
~~I regret my vote~~
anyway I'm fine with either, if you want to test out if I go mad with power with training wheels or just throw me in the deep end, whichever you're more comfortable with
that color kicks ass
oh so they're basically just maids who delete messages
do alchemists get a cooler color
I have no reason to doubt her I just haven't seen it in action
yeah I'm ahead of you
geez
~~I should probably visit at least once~~
üçø
the opposite of mild is uh, suicidal
don't let that 'mild' delegitimize you, btw
This could just be similar to a crossdress high but it's sounding more solidly like mild dysphoria
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
ohaiyo, r-kun
she's unsure if she wants it dropped in the server yet though
you can tell them to get fucked because your questioning is valid and I will fucking yell at them if you're too unsure to
the "0 friction" thing isn't because I hate how hard it is, it's because it's a lot of force to move like 1 centimeter on the spectrum
but that's really not my thing
I guess I could claim titles and play in discourse wars with extra weight
If I did I'd still be so boy adjacent that it'd be like ??? why make a deal out of it
yeah closeted implies some things and it also implies I'd want to 'come out'
anyway you could make that argument
not in a meaningful way
I'm fine with what I am because *I don't care*
I think I'm more closer to gender null than anything else
but the fact that you're still thinking about it a day later is a good sign
and if there was 0 friction in the world I might declare myself nb
I had to give it a thought for a while the first time it came up
Like, I've worn a skirt, I always play girls in RPs, and I've made *comments*
I have learned to keep some things to myself to avoid provoking comments
filled with primordial gay energy
is this an or or is it an xor
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
üôÑ
yes, good
oh, I see
üçø
sp00ky
this server was created right about the time I started watching symphogear
subreddit was created 3 years ago, I see
what's the timeframe on this?
I gathered
I'm a retired channer so I'm familiar with the strengths and flaws of the community
what a weird fucking hobby
*wow*
wait they just promoted everyone in the thread?
that was quick
"no you're wrong"
So it doesn't display a public notification?
for internal user conflicts, the stuff that is a *problem* but is not "get fucked, not okay, you're out" do we have a `process` for like probation or warning or whatever
more than just the internal user conflict stuff
yeah
what are the likely actual threats
so uh
yeah fair and now I know
I'm glad you did because that way I ended up here <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
If you don't have that, or at least implicitly, you get nothing but loopholes and dickish behavior that's allowed because it's not specifically forbidden
just want to throw that out
we have a really pretty rule list btw
I see the pinned instant-ban names but anything else I need to be aware of
problem-causers
uhhhhh
omedetou r-sama
yeah I'm still thrown by sparkle there
I remember it being discussed and me being disgusted by it
Should I join the server or is me being completely unaffiliated acceptible
I'm not going to press them about it because I'm not going to interrogate anyone in serious discussion unless it's a real shit opinion
there's a lot of ways you can take that but while some are mostly benign, others are a warning flag
while the full conversation is probably worth reading for context I'm going to make sure we all see this particular line because it seems like a yellow flag
I will probably try playing knight but I'm a white mage player at heart
I'd wait for the invites to drop unless you really want to shill it to the server ahead of time
it's time to vote for priest again <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
speaking of mmos
and that was before mafia
saki's phone prepared me for it but it's still weird to get used to
so much to scroll past
this server is much harder to find the channels I want now
I don't think that public shaming is effective correctional behavior
generally the kind of thing someone would be instantly banned for if they weren't otherwise good users
The only time I'd ever publically announce a warning is if someone's crossing a line I don't want anyone else to think of crossing
oh well I suppose that makes sense
dess_warn Latooni `test`
I mean, outside the command it's used in
```latooni miku```
yeah I use chibi miku-san as my avatar in a lot of places
:3
I remember feeling guilt, maybe regret at lying, but nothing like a vague sadness
I sat down and thought about it much later and decided it was less identity-based and more forbidden thrill, though
I remember pretending to be a girl in an MMO and finding it a little thrilling years back
though I want to use she/her whenever possible to give her the little happy buzz
they is always safe
#figures-and-fanworks ?
hm
what's up
Does that mean they're quasi-off limits or have they just never stepped out of line far enough to be shut down
Yeah, makes sense
that makes chris' comment way more disgusting, ugh
*wow*
lesbian fetishism instead of actual respect, I'd guess
it's fucking weird having an english server be led by a non-fluent speaker for what it's worth
noted
<@456226577798135808> is Khairz the valk overlord?
(the discord ibu mentioned is valk, not this one)
namco
oh no, it's like capcom or something
so I think it was sony that picked up the team and we got Xenosaga 1-3
but then squaresoft became squareenix and was done with it
Xenogears was meant to be like, episode 5 of 7 or something in a giant epic
Already ahead of you <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hilarious, considering the history of the xeno series
which is
yeah nintendo owns the xenoblade property
end of chapter 3 is crazy though
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
the part I liked was the end of chapter 4
oh you're near the end of chapter 3
I wanna know if it's worth making you get to the part I really liked
saki what chapter are you on in xenoblade
I have a mediocre phone with low storage space
giant conversation block I can't interact with, haha
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
because latooni's hair is lavender
~~I wish we had lavender~~
*hmmm*
*I wonder why green is at the top*
oh
mafia?
what are we making color roles for
she looks better with the gatling guns
100% robot

they made a non-corpse version of her
that's cool
if there's no horny
but I mean
are you sure because I'm pretty sure there's a hentai doujin of t-elos teaching kos-mos how to be a proper maid
that's the body of mary magdelene, your party member has her soul
yeah I got it backwards
she's a corpse
haha yeah
~~I've never actually played vol 3 so I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure she is~~
makes you want to go necro doesn't it
yes
xenogears and xenosaga went very heavy on metaphors sometimes
and we're talking like "one of your party members is probably a christian angel and another is wearing the body of mary magdelene" kind of weird religious shit
it's hard getting into it because it involves diving into the weird religious shit of xenosaga
she's basically kos-mos' prototype sorta kinda
she is closer to a corpse with robot parts
in that I am not fully comfortable calling her a robot
t-elos is kind of a weird edgecase though

usually yes, though
sometimes they're robots so big you live on them
sometimes they're just giant robots
artificial life is a very common theme but no
I am fond of it because they always have robots
3 series that *kind of* fit together but don't
same staff, 3 different companies
anyway and then nintendo hired the staff to do xenoblade
it was namco
Ten and Faye are my biggest hope in terms of making their character 'big' enough to take the spotlight
I do not want to have the spotlight all the time
blub
D:
aaaaaalice
I'm not unhappy with the way symphogear is, I just... have preferences
Genjuuro is a solid dude but there's room for a non-macho hero, though at least ogawa does an okay job of slightly filling that role
~~I still wish there was a boy user~~
yeah, maybe 'higher' would be correct
also I think there's a high percentage of eggs in the population of "boys" who watch magical girls
it's easier to crack if you're relatively sure that people will still like you after
the latter I think
at this rate cute girls will outnumber boys on the server <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I'll fix my phone later
ok
which isn't true, I just think they're a ~~spineless~~ centrist
there may be a point of contest in the future because I think WFC thinks I don't like them or something
so you're Kriisa now? How do I pronounce it
you're fine
this centrism is making me ill
~~I know so fucking many trans alices and annas and emilys I swear to god~~
it's an unusual one
saki-chan is saki-chan to me but I recognize the need for a name and will update the contact in my phone with the new one if that's what she wants to go by
saki has a name change what does it mean
it was well handled
this is the infoblurb my torrent site had up
I actually thought kanade was going to be a significant part of the show when I first watched it
~~red because of blood~~
it sounds like a soda flavor
I like the simplicity of naming after relics
is that important though
if we're splitting rep from color
do we need a color for kanade and hibiki both
I hate pepe emotes in general, this is extra bad
ugghghg
I didn't even look closely at the emoji
Take them seriously every time, and when they say "I'm kidding," tell them "please fucking don't"
ka wa i i de su ne
„Åã„Çè„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Åß„Åô„Å≠
as a lesbian you actually do not need permission, as I understand it
nice
that's always a fun moment
has it hit you that you're gay
so saki I have to ask
nice
basically being an elite emergency response force that specialized in heretech, I'd assume
noise proper have been sealed away and hibiki has punched everyone that used alchanoise until they stopped
let's assume that song does but noise, for the most part, do not
I have a vested interest in this
where do you see Lena in 20 years
anyway
I'm not unhappy with OVA but I can see the drawback you mean
OVA, that is
I am a little curious that the system decided on multipliers rather than modifiers
you could have a really bad day and be at -2 but you will *never* be worse than that without something modifying it
so it fudges your result but you're always within a given range of competence
you roll 4 dice and the dice can either turn up -1, 0, or +1
say you're gifted enough at [category] to be at a natural level of +2
the system exists on a scale from like, -4 (shitawful) to +7 or 8 or something (legendary)
the premise of it is like
~~the system I have my eye on may be to your taste~~
I see
A "my number is bigger than your number so I win" thing?
but it helps with not having to personally decide every combat beat
if the GM is like "this fight has gone on long enough" they can just start lying about what they rolled or what the TN was
I like rolled arbitration because I've GMed long enough to know that deciding whether every attack hits or not sucks
~~mondays are still the easiest day for me~~
I feel bad for saki getting to have only limited fun so I have partial plans drawn up for a secret project
<@!127644949884698624> given the assumption that Lena lives, what do you think her epilogue would probably be after the campaign? Like where would she be 20 years later?
it can be good if someone else on the team makes the effort to reach out but otherwise it's constraining
"never doing this again"
I made an isolated loner in an RP once and was like
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
though lena is big enough
besides lena
agreed
the next damn session
Alice we were probably going to fight an alchemist like
but if you'd rather go from scratch that's fine
at least 3 people have put work into it
Saki's setting seems decent and from what I can tell
Well, at least we established that Aegis would be strong enough to top Lena
I'm good though I'd strongly want to use Aegis as she is my precious and I hate losing RP characters I really like before they've had a real chance
kirichan stabbed her in the back with the zesshou scythe again
for the *muggles* out there
you may want to have a secondary go-to name that's easier to deal with
can I ask what made you pick Kriisa
especially in california
Starbucks should be fine about it
You could always decide to run stealth, but that can be psychologically wearing
that's a good app
so shit *similar* to FIS' shenshoujing cloaking chopper gets made
BASICALLY though it's somewhere between 30 and 80 years past symphogear and the world's had time to get its head around sakurai theory, the frontier data, and heretech in general
at that point you fill in gaps as you go
I need it somewhere in the 60-70 range to run
25% coherent
it's like
I do have a really cool setting if I can get it to come together though
It takes a lot of focus and it's not something I have in huge supply
ADD kicks my *ass*
I'm not very well aligned to do it, talent wise
I'm unsure if I'm fully ready to run a game though
I was trying to get people to help me develop my setting without being too obvious
~~please stop telepathically stealing my campaign ideas~~
she is a good girl
I just really want to keep exploring Aegis
or both
either or is fine with me
that is a pretty legit funeral
elon musk might do it but he's too busy breaching labor ethics in his tesla factories
chisel that shit into stone
you're a person and a woman, for ther record, and I'm slightly fuming at her declaring otherwise
it's, of course, better than it could be
That's kind of rough and shitty but maybe she'll adjust further later
I expect she's still absorbing it, but how was the initial response
and?
it was twintail and k-on or something
it wasn't even symphogear porn smh
Rukia was posting images in <#336297808221044736> at about a rate of 3 a second
Maybe Rukia's flood killed shirabe
then yes, saki-sama, girl power
unless you just wish to assert dominance
yeah but it flows less eloquently
like talking about how gay half the staff is
it works really well but it's high level abstraction
There's a system framework called powered by the apocalypse where mechanics are less mechanical and are more a way to structure and reward players as you basically cycle around the table, taking turns telling your part of the story
you can't satisfy everyone and have to make decisions
others want it to be a story arbitration device and a measurement of character growth
they love the dice rolls, they love the numbers
some people want it to be a board game
this is a key problem I ran into when designing RPGs
it honestly hasn't changed much as a concept
dnd was originally a wargame with light rules slapped on top to make persistent characters
too smooth
I usually hate freeform combat more, because it always feels
sakriisamori
sakriisa
sometimes it's really inconvinient narratively
you can have a party wipe without death
any GM who refuses to lie about rolls doesn't know what they're doing
you fucking lie about rolls
Here's the secret to preventing party wipes that you don't want to happen
rolling in RPGs is something I have Opinions about so if you ever want me to dump an essay on you pick my brain over it
if it's freeform, without is easier
depending if we're using roll20 or not
IC and OOC
maybe two
R's self-insert, a sentient talking cape
and I think ibu would take it personally because I suspect her leaving last week wasn't entirely unrelated to <#449826367903629313>

bluh
there
ok
HOW DO I ESCAPE THAT DAMN EMOJI
you deserve them \:(
lots of hugs, though
because her worldview is not currently "I have always had a daughter"
trying to rationalize and explain it in a way that fits her worldview
still in bargaining phase
is the fancy way to say that
in vino veritas
yeah probably
also please note that my advice should be taken with a grain of salt because I'm cis and only have second hand stories and my own conclusions
if she's already doing this like 6 hours later
she'll have a ton of misconceptions but it'll probably work out fine in the end with your mom
I'm not saying you have to put up with any bullshit that comes up with it but it can be a useful roadmap as to what might be going on in their head
Even though it's fucking wrong, parents usually viscerally get hit with the "lost a son, gained a daughter" idea with all the trauma that implies
She's trying, then
she's in bargaining phase
I'm kidding don't take this line of thought too far
what if you combined it with macro
ü§î
the problem is I can't keep a straight face when reading a sentence like that
anyway sometimes you get people who want to fuck the birds
~~anywhere on the internet~~
maybe have it trigger once an hour if someone types enough characters in all caps
thank you kirichan
whether they calm down because there's other actual funny forms of humor or leave because "sjws" I don't really care which
people who post borderline offensive memes tend to get it when their messages keep disappearing
so it's not like it takes emotional energy
Actual community division, pacification, and resolution almost never needs to happen
I kicked someone for talking about soy too much and then following it with "soyboy" today
I'm pretty low tolerance to anyone in their first day
anyone else who tries to start shit gets booted pretty cleanly
those that arrive to troll usually try to do it by spamming, and the bot picks them up cleanly
most people show up, get helped, and either leave or behave
it's really low-effort honestly
I rubbed my temples a bit at that one

I'm not really a redditor and I barely know valk
I'm not going to have a lot to contribute here
it's a very real danger that they'll show up to shittalk the mods being interviewed in the questionnaire
It's worth considering that if the idea is to create a discussion thread
right
I was going to look at saki suspiciously
nevermind then
oh ok
no, in sympho
there are some modding the subreddit right
I'm more worried about people on valk
subreddit mods
get a questionnaire

I also want to note that there's nothing in the r/anime rules preventing people from spewing garbage about trans things if it comes up, so there's no guarantee it'll be removed
it is worth noting that there's a difference of anonymity, but there's something about a split that makes people want to play in the drama
from then on, *every fucking thread* where the system came up on 4chan, someone would try to start shit
a schism ended up happening
When I worked on a tabletop system for evangelion, between versions v2 and v3, there was an argument on how to do an updated 2, a 2.5
I have a point of relevance, I guess
I think that's reasonable
and if they decide to pick another subreddit for safety for now, I won't blame them
I think it's reasonable to be warned your project might need close scrutiny, yeah
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I don't see anything wrong with it
I'm really sleepy so give me a bit to read it like 10 times over
o
we do spotlights?
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
does someone want to throw out an <#336300750248476693> about hitting 1k
it's how I ended up here
headpat
For the record I think reddit is a hellsite and deserves no respect either but sticking to the rules is a safe option ~~and makes breaking rules for when it really counts possible and more effective~~
for the same topic
an *alternative* subreddit
has valk or anyone ever made a splinterboard
I'm all for breaking the rules and causing havoc for a worthy cause but expanding the influence of an anime board doesn't qualify in my playbook
Going a little too far, R
no objections here, as I am but a mote of dust when it comes to reddit
Yes it seems fine to me
If that discussion happens today I won't be able to do more than may be hop in with heavy moderator action, I'm stuck at work
So much better, right?!
I think he'd only call you a rapist if you slept with someone now and didn't tell them, even though people die when that happens
I think you are
It's not okay even when I get why it happens
I hate having an excess of empathy because I can understand why people do shitty things like refuse to adapt and empathize with it even as I hate it
I spent half the discussion going "he doesn't mean *that* does he" to myself
Yeah that was not great
Also, I'm not feeling 100% solid on every point I made so if you want to call me out on something I welcome the opportunity to learn
<@!127644949884698624> please read over <#336310266654490624> when you wake up, there's a discussion about the degree of Fine's crimes that ends up indirectly being adjacent of trans panic shit
dragon's response concerns me but as long as he follows the rules it's fine, I guess it's really hard to wrap your head around the idea that the only people who get to decide what is a slur are those on the bad end of a systematic power difference
oh boy, that's a fun thing to wake up to, I can tell <#336297840529899522> must be  fun read
I'm sleepy but I thought it was fine last time I saw it
fine by me
I had to use old.reddit
I actually could not connect to the site under the redesign for 2 weeks
What are the logs? I'm about to drive home though
I used to be really uncomfortable about then but now they are just fun meat parts
Miku didn't seem to be afraid of it <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Magnum bikki dikki in fancontent and someone being scared of a penis
No internalized issues here no sir
Makes sense
Though obviously you can write whatever you want
I'm against late submissions being accepted for the prompt
I'm all for mindless smut but it seems worse when it's mixed in with classier stuff
It's complex I agree
I'm not going to judge anyone for that alone
I don't think so
I don't hate the far right one
And now solo is like wut
Smug little shits
Oh I have the 20th off, that's nice
I thought I detected something personal there
and with shit like his comment on "I only don't use trap because it's against the rules" shit yesterday I am sketchy on his stance
nothing, just... not realize Saki was trans
that comma is driving me insane
I know that if I got it it'd have to be the 50 but I can't justify it
that's what's tripping me up I think
why not pay the 50 for a year
That's probably disingenuous of me, sorry
I'll be interested to see if he has time to get to the fair though
I suppose
*not sure* how dragon missed it unless it was intentional "I'm going to choose to ignore this"
I have excellent taste in girlfriends, so that makes sense
Ashley is my girlfriend and I volunteer this information so that I can get overridden in moderation discussions involving her should such a thing ever happen
Hibiki has a catchphrase, therefore she's not allowed to cry in any universe
I think my favorite is that
it's not unreadably stiff, just practice-more stiff
dialogue is a little stiff but you'll grow into making it flexible, everything else is stupid as hell
lmao these cutbacks are trying too hard
Kriisa just needs a bitch sometimes
you heard it here
(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª

I think it'd be prudent to show restraint, but prudence and agency are different
and nothing important changed
yeah I see bingo's confusion that it's weird to be happening out of the blue
I am still reading
in the future it might save you a screen or two of effort if you swap to compact mode for this
Fair
Stealthy
Why not just do it
creation in general is low-burn in fancontent
Well, it's been a year since symphogear's been on the air
oh, I'm getting what you mean now
like <#357682999300718592>
Some channels should be immune from this
I think that's a good idea, yeah
we might even end up using them
If they want to discuss them that's fine
I think it might be worth semi-informally asking about it
okaaaaay
unless it's a "fill in the blank" survey which I don't know how to do
and, worse, there's no nuance
I meant a poll as in a discussion but I might set up a survey instead ü§î
is this worth an everyone ping or is just posting in suggestion box good enough
that should alleviate the degenerate filth lovers ~~like me~~
We could poll the community and then lean on the conservative side of what we get
Well
It's quite possible to be needlessly strict with it
isn't the sfw/nsfw division for the community's benefit?
I get what you're saying, but at the same time
we could poll the community and ask what they'd like the standards to be
the bepis-talker
discussion has been *loose*
that's a good point
We can declare things like "no nipples or lingerie" but you need to have a goal rather than hard rules to know the spirit of the matter
I think "Is having this pop up in public going to be super awkward" should be the rule of thumb for nsfw
it's no worse to open up in public than generic anime images imo
It's an image of a bedspread and there's nothing superbad visible
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I appreciate being picked, you are all nice friends who want the same things I do from a community
That would have to be the conclusion
there might be one someday
You know, it's a miracle there aren't smutty symphogear figures
because of the bedspread
Alice was wondering what our definition of nsfw should be
though I'll miss people being scared of penis
That sounds reasonable, I suppose
~~I thought Hibiki wielded Gungnir, not Excalibur~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
shirabe doesn't source in fancontent
which is a dumb thing to get mad about
but then we don't have to be mad at someone who forgot to slap <> on
hmm
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
but it did
...I don't know why my brain interpreted it as put it in NSFW and then mention NSFW in the fan channel
because if you put <> around a link it doesn't preview in discord
give a warning and put brackets around the link so it doesn't preview
but
Alternatively: We could allow NSFW content in fancontent
I am exaggerating *a little*
Someone comes in 6 hours later after it's dropped in NSFW and never sees it
because the archival factor is relevant too, you know?
Personally I'd rather have a cobweb filled NSFWFanCreation channel than shove it all in NSFW
*established characters*
if I ever feel comfortable writing fanfiction at all I might do smut, but
that moment was exactly as stupid in-game as it is in art
going to post it in hiero
I've been reminded of one of the best pieces of official pokemon art
it's an oldie but a goodie

<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
~~random googledocs~~
is there really no other source?
rewrite "smutfic is allowed with warnings" i m o
not everyone uses ao3
no
Do we have a rule on that, even?
if we're ever lucky enough to get a smut cosplayer that'd go in NSFW too I suppose
no meme bs
they can always go "Hey, check out my new fic NSFW:"
And if not
So the official ruling on smutfics?
Okay
rip surprise bikki dikki
~~I would not get fired but that's because my boss is chill af~~

Can I interject that
I guess I'll download
also please appreciate my shitpost bio
I am `afraid...`
that might be the reason I haven't played much

I've played like almost no opus magnum
it cost me like 10 bucks
please admire
I have a foil portal 2 badge
I have *extreme theming*

we shall commence at some point
I need a new portal partner
I'd like to see a piechart of my hours spent playing source games
I have never played gmod but I own it
saki posted that on my birthday <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
O
boku no hero academia character I think
because say voip out loud
that might have been on a previous pc
but
last I remember playing risk of rain I had slowdown
*voip*
I'm curious if my pc can handle it
huh
oh RoR is installed
I have gmod downloading

lemme know when you see my portal 2 hours
all of these
yes
we will do all sorts of tomodachi things
but yes at some point we will
also I don't think my controller is functional
I'm bad
also I'll always have a soft spot for the original arturia and all the other sabers can fucking suck it
it gets really edgy sometimes but it's still a cool story
also, penis worms
yeah fate's sex sucks
after that you can leave
F/SN is worth playing
rather than fucking dumb for the lulz
I miss when Fate was only artistically dumb

I was way into black rock shooter a decade back
she has scars which is pretty cool

jack is dragon's favorite character

I want to make a comment like
also those glasses they gave her in ataraxia h o l y s h i t
she was the coolest character in f/sn
I love medusa
almost all the heroes chosen have a *theme*
scroll up to dragon's latest image post in <#337805317276565525>
keep a straight face
I can't
Until someone pushes the system to a breaking point, anyway.
I think dragon's prediliction for loli characters is, as I said, skeevy, but I also think it's something we should be mostly hands off of and merely enforce around the edges where we have solid room - "that in-game screenshot of a character in a microbikini should probably not be in the SFW gaming chat" would be a reason of action, rather than "the character looks 12"

I suggest we draw a **hard fucking line** the instant any chat ever implies a parallel between actual children and fictional cartoon ones when they're being implicitly sexualized, but otherwise we treat loli fetishism like other fetishes we don't personally like -- tolerate it unless something extreme happens.

If this was Alice's personal social server I'd say be harsher - but we're a quasi-offical fanclub of a show that, as its marketing, sexualizes cartoon children. It's part of the package, and I personally feel like we have to give loli fans an inch in recognition of that.
I think pretending to care about discord's ToS and using it as a public show of force, particularly given that shirabe is a prominent character, because a specific user is skeeving us out is excessive and probably a bad overall move and certainly for a tainted motive
I guess I'll start at my conclusion
I'm home but made a shitty mistake that's going to torment me for a while so if I'm weirdly strained or something during this that'll be why
I'd like to give a nuanced opinion on this but I'm not going to type about half naked cartoon girls at work
Woah I somehow never got the notification for this
also <#448237561085952001> moved to the server category, I think
it sounds like a start
`the power grows`
put it in our dark closet of doom for a moderator to drag out when needed
yeah
if someone wants to hang out in a voice channel but write in text it's really awkward to shove that in a main channel
well, whatever, you get what I mean
like e3 etc
For special events we should probably bring it back out
though I do think a voicechat general may or may not need to reappear on a short term basis someday? I don't know
I do want a third opinion to make sure we're not overlooking any hyper important reason to keep X
but aside from that, yes
the music merge needs saki's input to make sure we're not breaking anything
role-assignment being right under introductions and rules makes a lot of sense regardless
so I think that would probably be worth a messier way to handle kirichan's commands
and completely axe a category
But if we merge music commands and music, then we can put bot-testing wherever and role-assignment right under welcome
afk is one too
sorry, 4 voice channels
I only started getting annoyed by it after I joined staff
I do remember the server is a lot less cluttered and messy looking when you're not on the admin team
Regarding anime club it does also establish a space to talk about their current show that sets up a spoiler policy different from <#377148557796442134>
Might also worth be looking at moving the 3 voice channels to their own subdivision near the bottom
1) yes
2) ok
3+4) Both channels get used enough and the no-text quality of hiero is special enough to lend to community identity
5) sure
6+8) Way less elegant, but doable with the commands in a pinned post
7) I don't see a problem, though ibu will be sad
9) Fancontent is explicitly under the symphogear divider, the server would have to be reorganized, and I think it might be worth keeping the channels pure
10) I think it's a bad idea as long as there's a server campaign going, and, as a reminder, tabletops doesn't clutter up the screen of anyone who doesn't opt into it
I read over it and I think vali's fine so far
üò¶ I'm worried
what a crash
oof
a lot
considering results vary
I was a little concerned how much hope they seemed to pin on tits, honestly
might not be a girl but *probably isn't cis*
yeah
I wonder which changes freaked them out
I miss when type moon made things I cared about
~~also she could probably defeat roughly half of all the Servants even though she's human~~
it's only obvious in the game cgs but she shares like 20 expressions with saber
also if you think the "saberface" jokes are new, saber actually has the same fucking face as one of my favorite characters from Tsukihime
Apparently it only targets specific forms of testosterone according to my gf
wants to avoid any risk
saki clearly is this dedicated to not liking pickles
I actually don't know that much about that anti-andro
ü§î
saki did you ever see *the comic* I posted earlier
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I like playing as girls because skirts are great
*even has a pink jacket*
<@!102691114762371072>
Did we ban him? Don't remember seeing him around lately
ew
it's not a big deal i m o
but *oh well*
The only downside to the music merger is people will mute the music channel if commands annoy them
h e r e  we go
I didn't really have the time or energy to narrow down the idea besides "symphogear in the past"
fine of some sort would be
If I had written something it'd have been season negative 1 where it's symphogears in like the 1700s because it's not new technology
the `suffering` prompts just needed a touch of optimism and refocusing at the end to be good
but
I don't want to tell people what to do and don't have the attention span right now to compose my thoughts in fancontent
I picked up on it
I can toggle my own staff role to check
yeah it's hidden
and create a new command post to pin it
headpat
spew the bile of your mind across our screenscapes, good sir
it's the composition
but I don't like it lol
I mean I feel like I'm not entitled to say I don't like it
I hate that think face
ye
I'm serious though, Saki, if you come off of that call tomorrow and need to switch meds, reach out to us, because its important to me that my friends get to be who they need to
yeah she got it last week
She might be right
~~I have probably paid somewhere around 2500 dollars on funding trans girls medicine, housing, and name changes~~
I'll remove that limit from you if it's bugging you that bad
If you have questions you should call them and not wait a month
you will have to operate your day thinking about bathrooms
something like spiro has enough side effects that they change your lifestyle
She's not lying though
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> It's not a waste and don't beat yourself up over it
Can I also ask if your doctor specializes in trans patients
but I am not an endocrinologist
I've just also heard it has less, or more targetted, main effects
I've heard it does have less side effects, much less
I've been told by two people it's usually not the antiandro of choice
Saki can I ask why finasteride
she is doing *GM* things
yay
I wonder if I got in
oh
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm proud of you for pushing for this even on a spoon heavy day
Nice
I mean it is but it's also specifically a thing
airshit is just part of /k/ inspired culture
yeah I almost entirely overlooked that
yeah that makes sense
tsk tsk that's two strikes
and we put all that in the command to warn them that they get pmed?
Do we want any kind of hard protocol on when a member of staff should recuse themselves of dealing with a specific user? Like personal conflict of interest or something?
I forgot the one
can I have the refresher meme on sealioning
we'll listen if you want to
speaking of which download the black maria picture from sfw so we can clear the pin
you're a good dude
you should probably just do that
I have all 4 seasons downloaded
the worst gatekeepers
I don't know if you've heard the stories but doctors are actually
(she better, actually, because "it looks slightly risky" would make me start sniffing for gatekeeping)

okay see I thought you were going for the other eating
`vore`
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
it means kriisa has a doctor that doesn't suck
all in all this is good news though
less drinking parties, more ice cream parties
point in his favor
yeah
just for the record
scrmz used a thinking emoji with a noose next to it, I asked him not to, he deleted it and apologized
what a pleasant person
I've heard the name before but don't have any context
the only way it isn't maria if it's serena because I recall her having weird earmuffs
Doesn't make it easier
I respect that a lot

She's the only other gear who engages at all at this point

Though 'makeout' is a little heavy for what I had in mind
If things happen naturally it's a high probability
Do they control that or is Faye going to get drained by accident in the ATF RP <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

What do I get for doing so

is there a way to lock onto a character when attacking
no one will probably take Melua so I better try to nab Aegis
so I have to create all the characters I want like right away
shit, does that mean I can't be Aegis
I don't know maybe there's multiple Alices
that's incredible though
wasn't me
and we can roll it out if we do this again
I'll archive the jackbox channel tonight

Character development for the 6 is crap after G with the exception of Chris in AXZ
Personal growth by proxy, if you will

They had to balance out the spot of good writing that revolved around elfnein
`does nothing`
Yes we will do everything we can
You're a good girl, kriisa
Ok
I worry because there's implicit pressure there that they don't like you for who you are but what they want you to be
Even if it's a joke you're insisting you know more than them about their identity
Mostly annoyed for your sake kriisa but I also want to tell ibu that making ongoing egg jokes about someone is shitty
Ughgh
can you make us copies
if not by mafia, then by lynching
logically this would paint a giant target on them to get killed every game
I love how people bring up that they have vast experience playing the game
IT WAS ME ALL ALONG
IT WAS ME AUSTIN
I want to bust in there
or at least R could
honestly we could just demod saki for the length of a game
kk
<@456226577798135808> do we want to prevent live townies from talking in spectator chat or even reading it

it's fine

That's actually excellent

hopefully someone can give me a hand with that after work
maybe I should actually have a party for this one then
<@456226577798135808> was it Hemokan or whatever you had trouble with
It sucks
I've been ms2 fishing all morning
I can't believe Alice used my shit screenshot in her tweet
wow
oh my god housing plots are going to be like 20mil in the actual game
why would they be sold out
founders packs are sold out
this show is filth
so would carol, for that matter
Fine would rather it be an arousing success
yeah I have to do daily shit
You can probably convince me to roleplay for assistance for the next thing
Even so I'm jealous of your focus
that was a lot of work but it went well
especially you, R
well done
I've never encountered the role before in the games I played like 10 fucking years ago
well done R, that was a clever game
ü§î
I can still see here
yo let's do it
anyway I'll play if I'm demoted but I don't have a sockpuppet and am not making one
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
both worked anyway
ibu's was good but implemented poorly
your plan was stupid but you implemented it well
It's fine, you're doing great, and I don't think anyone minds the breaks
oh, right
is this the whole song or just the 1:30 opening
if only you could use the pay currency to do it
I'm trying to do only my railgun
it doesn't handle complex chords well
oof
Is there a reason I wouldn't want to open one midi track into multiple mml tracks
oh, that's less daunting
is 3ml the editor you use
ü§î
but some of this can be avoided if you take a track meant for, say, just piano
inputting each note by hand
do you adapt this from the music by just
but I am totally down for it
as long as you don't decide to finish it during saki's game tomorrow or like 3 fucking am yes
I'll have to come back later
this lag is unplayably bad

yes
"but lat that's not a high standard"
it was an unexpectedly decent toku show
I was reminded today how totally out there sailor venus' plot arc was in PGSM
still mad at R for copying my look
oh I did see that one

no, I have no idea
oh
can I ask why a maximum of 3 tracks can be checked
I mean I can do that, I suppose

for 1:30
3000 characters for the main right hand track

this is still a monster

and it's OP length
0 tempo changes in this version
I'm opening up a different midi of the same song
yeah it looks like it's the swing
hm
that or it's their way of swinging the note
staccatto's a big part of the song
oh god I know what the tempo changes are
maybe I can find a simpler version
hum
there's a lot
yes
which will get cut a measure earlier
the ending measure's going to be 92 for everything except track 9
no that's it, I just did terribly at naming it
is that not it
wait

https://musescore.com/user/13887436/scores/4393241
there's not a small amount
oh oof
that should be *manageable*
out of 4
I want 1:30 of it

this is export mml to clipboard, right? Can't find another option
does that compress down?
track 1 of this says it has 5k characters
right but uh
sure
oh, Meas
because it's 4 minutes long
now I need to figure out how to truncate it
yeah I've figured out the easy step of combining everything
I think I'm starting to get it
I'm still trying to understand what's going on
how do you paste them back in
hmmm
HELLO BOTTOM PANE
OH
...I don't have a bottom pane
it just puts a red bar there
it doesn't highlight
I want to end at measure 55 but it goes to 111
there doesn't seem to be good selecting tools
Alice I can't figure out how to delete massive amounts of a song
but first maybe I should do my damn job and answer the mod survey
and then make a second sheet to make it an optional duet
yeah maybe I'll go for a reduced fidelity
I think I might be able to barely make only my railgun work on a 10k solo sheet if I cut out chords
eh, I'll only watch it if someone else wants to
oh the hearthstone reveal stream is today
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
how do collab pieces work? How do they know when enough people have queued to start them?
wish the ingame drums had a highhat
not tonight though
I might take a crack at it
it shouldn't be hard
we need to work on this
https://musescore.com/fantasysheets/scores/3082091
I'll investigate in the morning though
probably even split
I really want to do this one, but I can just tell it's too much
*stares at sheet music*
I might try to do tetris a theme tomorrow
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
thanks alice you were a huge help
I have created weeb music
I did it
well the preview seems to work
<@!127644949884698624> do I stick v15tx before or after the MML
I get that I'm on west coast but ughh
wtf happened
Still big latency
It's destiny
I had it in MS1
It feels right to have the beta bandanna
Also I mean
Yeah
I might have to bite on one of the founders packs
piano/bass might also work
there's no violin or anything is there
aww ty
I might still use only my railgun as a group thing later
neat
does the auto performance voucher burn like dozens of copies of the song
I'm halfway through intermediate thanks to our jam sessions
I found a different song, more beginner friendly
It might also make a good duet
I might be able to fit this on a 5
3k, 10k, and what's the middle
what are the sizes of sheet
I can, though I lack music theory knowledge
but neither do I
ü§î not sure this author knew their chords
right
ahhh
so how do I export everything
I'll have maple preloaded
god it's so satisfying when it works though
it's fine without them
to try to hang a note a fraction of a second
they were a cheat
Alice I figured out the single track mid-measure tempo swings
ok so it seems to be that the solution is to just cut out the fucking stupid adjustment from 160 bpm to 169bpm
there's a series of excellent 4chan posts on the topic
I am making fun of british lingo using britsh lingo that doesn't actually exist outside of jokes
12th bong of the clock, mate
she says, at 12th bong
I don't think I broke anything?
track 1 seems to have the primary tempo shifts
but it's in track 2
the callout wasn't in any of the other tracks
that's the thing
*tries cutting it out*
whyyyy
so one track sets the tempo at 169 on tick 0000 of the measure, another sets it at 0216
d#
nevermind
oh I think d+4 is a note
is the t169d+4 meaning it's 169 beats per minute for 4 beats?
Why does this track keep making calls to set tempo at 169? Nothing's disrupting it
<@!127644949884698624> so I just have to make sure the "t169" or whatever is on every line at that measure, right? assuming it's at the top of the measure
argh
what, there's a tempo switch in track 2 as well
a tempo switch, hidden in the depths
mother fucker
I appreciate you trying to work with me though
yeah if you need to play it without me I get it
I hate getting so close to being under 3k
composurerine
I'll probably log on after I fix this megaman track

it was dragged down to nothing by default
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
oh yeah I kind of get you
sometimes repeating things in prose is a problem, but sometimes it gives it 'rhythm'
like
I get what you were going for but there's a diction quality here I like
yeah I think so
if anything, it emphasizes that `it's about girls` which is fine
I think the original works fine and I don't think repeating the first part weakens it
this is usually a yellow flag
It uses a bunch of commas but they serve different purposes
it's aesthetically bad
but I'm pretty sure my favorite english teacher would hate it
no, I guess it doesn't
I think this turns it into a grammatically incorrect runon sentence
is there any feedback in particular you're looking for
I don't have a problem with this intro is my final conclusion
I think my k key is going bad
the content is good I'm just thinking about authorial tone
I'm trying to decide if we want it this personal or if we want to be more encyclopedic
also I think one of nanoha's friends gets kidnapped and killed or something in the vn
not really consequential to the plot
just an imouto character
a little girl
where nanoha is just
that's because they're way more important in the vn that nanoha's a spinoff of
you remember s1 had all those family characters they focused way too much on that didn't matter
I still can't believe nanoha exists because of a really shit half-rate eroge vn
TIME AND DIMENSION POLICE
and then suddenly
you've got probably the most *fucking standard* magical girl show ever
aside from s1 being terrible for half the show nanoha s1 still blows my mind (I'm blathering as my mind's processing the intro)
I'm going to look at old spotlights to compare

if they were I couldn't dump 2 guitars' worth of chords onto one sheet
yeah I know
I just need to actually put the parts onto sheets
anyway I've got it all done
the high hat beats that is
more than the guitar does
the beats definitely add a lot
https://musescore.com/fantasysheets/scores/3082091
the percussion is pretty punchy
I don't know how it's going to sound when I turn the hi-hats into drumbeats
I'm most concerned about the drums

I felt I had to, with decisive battle

if alice is the only one I know going to play I'm not going to buy a founder's pack
so R now that you've hit level cap, are you going to play on release
if we were to try to do that I would advise we shutter <#336297808221044736> first and I don't want to take that step

I'm still amused at the 75k tip

so I still have an advantage
even if dungeons are level adjusted, you keep skill points
that said
dungeons are level adjusted yeah
which the 75k I got as a performance tip might almost cover
no that's a lie I'm going to go buy a 10k sheet
I'll probably resume story after I finish this autoperformance cycle
can't wait
it seems like 3 minutes of music is roughly 5% of a level

<@127644949884698624> I do in fact open the morning of the first so I can't make it
which is not explicit
It's only under 'don't be a dick'
`1. Don't be a dick. No slurs, bigoted language, attacks on others, or harassment of users will be tolerated.`
an explicit rule
well, it was an image, but it was effectively a giant emoji
do we need to codify this into a rule
sparkle is the third person I've had to tell not to use emoji with a noose
last I checked no one knew what was actually going on
the rule the ffxiv discord broke didn't exist 5 days ago
for using "retard" too much or something weird
though the initial claims were like
posted it yesterday
neat
there's more to it, but it's... it's just unhealthy to use that kind of language and thinking
"it's okay if it's ironic" is one of the principles that led to 4chan's evolution into what it is today
I'm personally of the stance that, in a public setting, ironic slurs are still slurs
but we should tell him to either not post stuff like the coldsteel meme or at least blank out the slurs
I'm not sure what to think yet
agreed
I was processing it differently
ohhhhhh
but if someone has a problem I'll agree to it
I'm fine with whatever the last thing is personally because it's just another wierd commercial from another country
oh yeah I didn't closely read the coldsteel edit
alright

so it's just a matter of whether glitch wanted to put anything in

I also wanted to tell R not to take the writing prompts results as devastating until we get like, two weeks in a row of bad turnout. Outliers happen - I'd have had a submission if maple hadn't happened, for example
We love and respect the work you put in R, and I don't think anyone disagrees that you do, in fact, do a lot. But even if you do a lot, even if you do the *most*, doesn't mean that you have all the answers and should get to dismiss us.  We all want to work to improve it, even if we're not all as equally skilled or have equal spoons for it. And experience means a lot, but it doesn't mean everything.

Framing yourself as the pivot point of everything is possibly valid? but it doesn't matter, because it's not the only framing and it's destructive.
I would personally rather convince R that it's counterproductive rather than just putting shackles on him

Can we make those *guidelines* rather than *rules*
If someone has the announcements channel muted, they are probably not a geniuine member of the community anyway
Most people I know do in fact read announcements
Opt in roles are good, and the announcements channel is good
because there there's a spot for community contribution
for the spotlight
ALSO we're already probably going to do an everyone ping today anyway
my attention being called to it has done nothing but maybe interrupt my workflow
It changes nothing and I'm going to do nothing
```Open phone
Read channel
"oh, it's kanade's birthday"
close phone```
because here's what I'd do
R I think I'd hate getting pinged about kanade's birthday
.5 of a ping
honestly a server icon change is already like
We want to foster activity with cakes and cookies, not megaphones and cattle prods
ü§∑
it's going to happen
Note that we have a departure correlated with a ping

is what she had
but I'm sure she's already on top of that
Alice should get that thing she wrote ready to post
our user count should bloom this week
speedy
If you reach the point where the server's running your life you need to breathe, my friend. And we can always find users to designate to host some of the events
We don't have to have a party for every birthday, but they can be fun
yeah, I think the general properties behind a server ping are 

1) A fundamental change in the function or operation of the server (immediately effective core server rule change, more than just "we have a new channel")
2) Timely information for community members for *something they can actually do*

If you tell someone "It's Genjuro's birthday" there's not much they can do with this information

If you tell someone "It's Genjuro's birthday, we're livestreaming Bruce Lee movies all day, join us and nominate your favorite action flicks" it's an alert for them to get involved
Some are just going to sit on the server for the art, some are just going to sit on the server and mute it *for the emotes*
We just have to give them reasons to look
We can't force every member of the server to participate in everything, we can't demand we take up their screenspace
Some will
Changing it for birthdays seems like a really fun thing to do and a way to get people to click on the server
but for special events it's solid
that'll lose its effectiveness
We can't use it all the time of course
<#336297387863703552>
just now
if it's fun, it'll grow
and that's okay
it's not a giant writing circle yet
5/14 is really solid R
we have a lurker come out of the darkness in general chat
To reinforce my "Changing the server icon is .5 of a ping"
Also
is there a way we can get a count of people with the writing prompts role
5 is pretty promising
I think limiting the role is maybe going too far and I still trust R, for the record
boof.
I cant trust you with this power

as you were saying that I hear "So how forced was my transition" in voice chat and I would have spat out my drink if I had one
even if that's what they want I think it's abuse to do it

why isn't it here
we have probably like 15 empty animated emoji slots here
you have giggling micha on lulubus

she's tuturuing
this is social engineering on the "this only works the way you want in movies" level
actually I do have feedback
yeah ok
I know nothing about khairz so I'll stay silent on this
what symphogear event do we celebrate by hosting a livestream of a mortal duel
`he would have to kill me first.`
Do we have anyone capable of that
I don't really care about media releases
Which is Maria's bday I think
I'm more interested in the 17th
I take it I missed some Shit
Whuf
"But my freedom of speech!" I cry, as tears flow down my face, embodying the unfairness of being denied such an American act as belittling and oppressing an entire race of people
So... remove the people who do that? Smh
"We can't have the discussion without it devolving into hate speech"
I have never been tempted to join
I feast on drama
üëÄ
It was kriisa being a goof
I saw the threads on /m/ but never played
oh, cosmic break
I don't
ü§î
thanks R
now I have to listen to live and learn
for best effect, this needs to cut off the last few words of the previous line
`I'll make you eat those words!`
fuck
ok that was pretty good
I give consent to use me as a joke if we want to go meta
so uh, it only works the way you want in movies
But the idea you need to know is bullshit in the first place
Yes I'm aware of the other trash implications
"How do I know to be bigoted or not if you don't give me a heads up"
God I'm disgusted
Oh it finally loaded
No that conversation with bingo is enough
I've had nightmares about this shit
This conversation makes me ill
Just read that crap
Wow bingo is trash
But if its out of your control..
I was guessing bomb threat or shooting threat yeah
Rip
makes sense
and xyzzy already has the base set
We lack a proper nervous tension emote
üëÄ
Pool party fine is a fun time
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
üëÄ
Kriisa very much getting the trans girl experience
ü§î preoccupied hm
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Looks clear as mud
The way that leaves him convinced that he's a good person
The liberal "well my hands are clean" way
Complicit in the worst way
`Despacito plays`
is the list attached to a server
I mean
christ
is the quote list global
dess_.. Saki
yeah that's why I'm fine with what he's doing
because slur use is going to get someone disciplined anyway
I was thinking more just fucking up good pools with shit quotes
could be a problem down the road, but I guess until abused it's fine
yeah okay
do we want to discuss limits now
quote functionality
ok uh
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I thought you were m not s
`i've already beaten you`
or are you
you can rename her on the server but you're kind of stuck with dess_
if the show grabs me I'm always up for helping establish healthy spaces
as beautiful as this corner of the internet is it's not something we should advance by hook or by crook
I agree with the sentiment though
uh huh
I meant metaphorically
I'd be tempted to lock his keys in his car
has science gone too far?
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
oh no I've been erping with her in PMs
ü§î
oh nice
but you can be wayyyyyyyyyy too overeager and clumsy about it
The bigger, more important side is that *hatching is life-saving*
There's two sides to this
Thanks, Alice
I was just never... *in*
*yes I know how fucked up that is*
I've spent the last two or so years in a social circle pretty much exclusively of trans people and I suffered from bouts of feeling like I had no self worth because I was cis
you can make them in private about me but please don't in public
~~I won the fucking lottery~~
That was most of it because I'm not dumb enough to romantically pursue a lesbian
I'd say tmi but that's actually really cute and I don't feel it's too much at all
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
but I was also aware how good it was for Kriisa's self esteem
I was aware
but before that uhhh
ok the last few days it was half hint dropping
We actually had a conversation whether to disclose it to you as server business, Alice, due to bias worries, but since complaints for Illuminati go to Custodians anyway we felt it wasn't material yet
fun as fuck
I lived right between baltimore and DC for 6 months
about 20 miles
I thought otakon was in baltimore
`use me daddy`
I've been thinking of trying out flip flappers with one of my girlfriends lately tbh
is this a serious commitment or something you'll lose focus on in 2 weeks
alice you're doing the flighty thing again
exibitionism, now? damn alice
sounds excellent
oh word
dess_.. shirabe
nifty
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
so 'coincidence' is maybe not the best word
I'd argue that I'm both dating Saki and got invited to be a mod for very similar reasons though
good morning R
_holds his head in his hands_
then I'll adopt you as my sister, nerd
except the transphobes and terfs
ALL üëè TRANS üëè GIRLS üëè ARE üëè QUEENS
the suicide talks for people I only kind of know are the fucking worst
Like if I decide to adopt you it's one thing, but trying to intervene in every problem
I want to do my best to be a love and support battery but god I get drained fast if I'm thrown in the deep end
yeah, that's valid
trans girls typically live really shit lives
I mean I kind of get it
and then every few months one trans girl sexually abuses another one and the entire community is expected to split and exile one or the other
callout culture is *strong*
oh my god yes
That's why I connected to you when I first got here
death by 1000 cuts of belonging to a community you don't belong to
sometimes my girlfriend would invite me to a social space and I was like... "Uh, isn't this marked as a safe space?" and she was like "Yeah but... no, yeah. You're right. Sorry."
but like, to put it in perspective
I am too
it's a trans-adjacent space, if you will, with all of the positivity and desire to accept people, but I'm not at risk of metaphorically drowning here
I was just... really happy to find this place
but on the flip side I'd be tempted to claim I'm now relatively highly educated on related issues
if it's all you consume
I got constantly exposed to memes about how awful cis people are, how they're the cause of all evil, and even when you *know* the caveats to that... the fact they're true messages just *eats* at you with time
I think that's what really had me down, actually, is the life-saving bit
huh
it was one of the highlights of 2018, I missed nothing
`Kriisa is hatching`
oh wait no "Oh?" is the egg one
R is evolving!
What's this?
Wanted xrays
She fell and hurt her arm
1m away from being called
I literally got called out to drive my mom to the hospital last time I tried
I'm waiting for a haircut so I can't atm
Yay I'm an exception
Are you okay with Miku making a mistake? Thinking that Hibiki would be more grounded with reconciliation?
her lesbian hypnosis
Miku can do anything
it was Miku
ask for help from valk <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
ganbare
I experienced physical pain from that one alice
ok
meteor mash
_checks twitter_
deep breaths
*pats Alice*
can you explain that
what

pls fix
<@456226577798135808> you made a typo on a pronoun

`are our local lovebirds not joining`
That profile
ü§¢
Read whatever you want into that
Unless we get distracted
We will probably be pseudolivetweeting a lot of it
So I don't know when I'd talk to them
Maybe that's best also I'm at work and then after that I have to make sure I'm ready for 3 day ultradate
After this weekend
I'm reluctant to engage on him with any topic because I'll get pinged on some repeat or tertiary thing in the future
I wonder if wolf realizes what his pinging behavior causes
thanks me
and now I look like a jackass
I see "gamer" in a tag and I flinch
oh no what are we going to do without users like *EpicGamer*
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
`j o y`
ughhh
how do I claim the title of Saki's #1 fan
alice can I duel a user in mortal combat
<@!127644949884698624> 100% orange juice is 1.74
Oh <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I see invalid user now
They've been banned I think
Probably after 2008ish
I think generally they just made games without caring
I think it was after all the fans did
Different kingdoms and possibly dimensions
It's more about the myth of the hero
But I don't think zelda time is best expressed in a linear fashion
All timelines simultaneously
If you want a serious answer I think botw is at the end of everything
Alice please I almost said "but,"
Fuck zelda lore purists
Thank God this server doesn't have timeline arguments
going between yellow, and "green, playing hearthstone"
you're going nuts on my screen
oh you mean of things other than pornland
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
what an incredible name
PORNLAND
and let his own refusal do it
You could just bring it up publically
oh that's absolutely fine
Being vindictive is maybe fine but collateral damage is not okay
I do not agree that their users should be open to abuse because they happen to be on valk
do not sign them up on discord.me
It's fine if we need to use a command to access it or something rather than giving us a feed
this is in the botfeed in the zelda server and I find it useful once in a blue moon
<@!102691114762371072> how possible is it to give us information on how long a discord account has existed
they're banned

<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
on IRC, you assume everyone's logging
I don't think anyone needs to know? I don't think it's dishonest?
what's the suggestion though
busy
yeah Kriisa is
we don't need wfc coming across a meme telling him to end it
yeah
this is honest mistake level
this one isn't anywhere near as bad
dess_warnlog <@200927407736094721>
they have already been warned once for hiero content
is it actionable
<@!127644949884698624> I'm a little concerned about doxe's meme in hiero, mostly the top most part
~~I am barely capable of remembering to breathe~~
I am not capable today of contributing to this
too transparent with our desires to see valk burn
I feel like we shouldn't be
good user name
<:angery:406621640311701506>
I saw eyelicking in a doujin once 
It was an experience
I did feel light headed
IT WAS SUDDEN FOR MY LITTLE PURE LIPS
I got a kiss and had a heart attack

<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
You can see them in the AXZ op
Maria also has big guns
Kriisa has a standing offer that I can play with her joystick
I think so
Rename general chat to #empty-room
This is like some vocaloid fandom shit
R are you ok
Do we know Serena' s deathday
Pineapples
Is this your fetish r
There was an audible "noooo" in the room
Can we make the server look like it's empty on that day
I don't think it needs to be said but we don't want you to do that R
I've had this kind of fantasy with a different focus before
R don't take the tough love thing too far
I'm busy beholding saki
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Tomorrow here
Today in japan
<insert Garfield Monday meme>
I spiritually identify as <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Or maybe <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I linked your vid
Japari park came up in another channel
ALICE
_shoves all other conversation off the table_
üëÄ
congrats~
you two are getting time?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
minus the laughing
familiar
sounds uh
Kriisa? You're a smart girl. Can you agree you're not in the best frame of mind to censure users on this? You can ask us to get someone to fuck off and we'll do it for you.
then let me be a mom <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
but moms are different from dads
I'd love to apply
do you have a suggestion or something
ah
oh I thought when she took them she gave them back to herself
???????????????
dess_take 2 <@!127644949884698624>
nope
dess_plant <#447995991438786564> 1
from dawnish in japan to midnight america
I still say we have nearly 2 day birthdays
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
kumikyoku is such a good medley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-x6R0mKzII I would make this
what if they made 50k music sheets
it'd just cut out beats
I couldn't get darude to sound right
ms2 does have a limit
dess_say <#336297387863703552> this is why you don't teach moderators new things
NICE
dess_say <#447995991438786564> test
BAM
dess_say test
orz
saki and I weren't meant to be apparently
oh yeah I guess I probably should just so the mod team is fully aware and can make informed decisions if any weird tension happens since I'm now in a headspace where I can say the words without falling apart
your video got favorited nerd

this was the response
I can sympathize
but I don't leave for a few hours
I'll be back like 2330 est
which I do not feel like I have the emotional strength to do but *whatever*
and I might be at scouts
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
it's a good voice
It was a fallout image edited to have astolfo and talked about traps being gay etc
ox apparently forgot that there was more context to the image than being a fallout image
sure
you got it before me
yeah thanks
dess_say <#384870333620027403> WHO DARES POST TEXT IN HIERO DESS?!
and also, it breeds guilt
and any trashtalk that happens with sports fans has no place here
you don't personally know and interact with the people who win or lose you packs
I wanna veto that
idk
maybe the prize pool will be an emote slot or something
let's not incentivize cheating the f2p rules
have most of the reward be just for entering
maybe a mild prize pool actually
I think as long as we gave hefty kiricoins just for entering and a good prize pool then okay
that'd be like next march or april
a rotation?
I think even asking someone to play for 2-3 hours every 3 days for a month is still a high requirement
it's a lot of labor and the labor is rewarded with severe advantage
hmmm
I saw but cannot vote for another half hour or so
No, but only after they have displayed this mystery threshold
Yes but we're discussing actual demotion now, not regret
I have a short tolerance for them right now
Then can we not make excuses
If you want to demote him for an actual reason that's different, but otherwise it's not a decision to be made until he actually has been gone for a while
In fact I think I prefer it
I don't object to R being a custodian at a lower level of activity unless he goes way dormant
Is lavender on the table
I advise against switching yellow to me because people are used to yellow symbolizing something on this server
I don't like the green though
I'm going to roll my eyes and go with whatever here because it's not worth fighting over
Saki knows I want the blue
I want the blue
She dumped me so I couldn't dump her when she turned tailcoat<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Oh I see
Oh
?
I appreciate it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
No
just bring it up if you think it's unreasonable
that's absurd
I can't see us scheduling in some repeating thing on a calendar to take fuckin rollcall
"huh, they haven't been active lately"
probably once in a while when we go
If the concern is "have they been active enough"
yeah I'm absolutely against little civil tricks to out someone through loopholes
(kidding)
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> aw you're so kind
We're adults capable of critical thinking and we can operate to factors beyond what can be captured on a checklist
I'm for studying it case-by-case
if you want to look at the list and ask if we prune every month or so, fine
I say we don't set a number
On the botw server every few months we look at the mod list and go "huh they haven't said shit for a along ass time" and demod them and that seems *sufficient* for me
"They've crossed the limit, I can make the push"
This is the kind of rule that's open to abuse in bad faith
Agreed, and particularly not a tight one like 3-4 days
I think you're capable of that but it involves realizing that you need to be
I believe you can do a good job in your role but it involves being better than you have been
I, for one, am absolutely swayable in this
defending, rebuking, and *acknowledging*
I, personally, want to hear what you have to say R
Ok
I'm not comfortable with this conversation while he's afk
R's orange
Ok, can we not get sidetracked over shitty edgelords
I'd rather fuck with them by being a better server
I'd rather passively fuck with valk
I want to hear that before I contribute
particularly the low points
I want to ask R about how he feels he's performed over the last month while I've been here
Okay they went dormant like a little bitch instead lemme read up
this is what I'm dealing with so I should be done soon since a banning's gotta be imminent
I'm going to be busy for a few minutes, MUH FREE SPEECH happening on zelda
oh no she broke
I think she's doing a wonderful job of proving her legitimacy in the role right now, however, before tonight I would be tempted to say she's a Custodian for Alice's sake of sanity and almost never contributes to moderation in any capacity

but again, that was before tonight, and she's being lovely
Abusing other moderators is not okay but getting heated in discussions isn't something to be automaticaly slammed for, if it's kept behind closed doors
It should have weight, but not the same weight
The third is that you're valued and you really have done work to better this place and we love you for it.
Okay.
I understand your viewpoint - our server is really the focus and endgoal - but the rest of us have agreed that the end doesn't justify the means, particularly when the means have risk attached, so are you willing to abide by what we've decided several times over?
The second of the three things is the "break the rules" thing
Okay. I won't abuse that.
You don't have to trust just anyone as long as you trust someone
In my mind, the biggest problem is your anger/passion. Like, having a heated conversation is *fine*, even if not ideal, but once or twice you've crossed too far and straight up attacked. Can you draw a line in your head for that? Barring that, can you trust in *someone* to tell you when you're just going too far?
Okay, I have just a few things I want to kind of ask R
I'd kind of like to take the floor when possible
I don't really want to be rude but I am less interested in hearing about how dumb someone was too many years ago than I am in what you were saying earlier, R
isn't coelasquid the person who draws manly men doing manly things
you dumped on him quite a bit and he should get his turn
I'd rather you didn't
Please
Yes
`concerned`
I am
I am sad I no longer get leg rubbing privileges
kriisa does have nice legs
dess_.. timeline
You're getting what you wanted, Kriisa. I think you should let the bitterness there go, it's just going to drag you down at this point
Your criticisms are legitimate but I think if you reread your comments you might find them to be a little much
Yeah, you were, I think
I would have been hard against him staying on if he breezed past his faults
much later than that and I have work, but I can glance at my phone I guess
Yeah, okay.
I don't want a conversation about him while he's gagged
We can either vote or we can wait
I cede the floor back to Alice
That was my last point
rip dmjii mods
I'm upsetting the balance of the server
what level of change have I wrought
my god
<:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
ü§î
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
ohio

papika's design reminds me of nono
<@!127644949884698624> I'm succumbing
She's trying, when she's not asleep or at therapy or doing things she's already scheduled
I've been way too depressed to take care of it since I got home, too
ugh
same
I can have a decent beard in about 13 days if I stop fighting it
and yeah my bad, I should have shaved twice a day, I knew how you felt about it <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I moved in that direction once and I got pushed away so I took the implicit hint
üçø
yes
I see no reason for action
If Alice's concern is that she makes mistakes she just needs to listen, which she has no problem doing so far
I appreciate your thoroughness but I feel this is theatrics
No extra proving of himself necessary beyond that
I suppose I vote for demotion, with *expectation* that he get promoted again after whatever period if he keeps his temper under control
_sighs_
Is this a mandatory vote? I'm not doing great today.
I don't really agree with it but I don't have any ammo to fight against it
Sure, okay. I don't have a problem with using excuses in public as long as we're not using them while making decisions.
It's not a hard no, just a "are you sure you want to do this"
Anyway I do have a point to bring up that this is going to impact server perceptions of R
but a+ profile
I mean she's always cute
ahhhhhhhhh lyssa's so cute
I feel like you have to be playing the mobile game to remember she exists
~~why are we pretending serena is a character~~
that's how I thought it would work
Okay
but it can be overridden
It's reasonably strong
Uh
Like, fuck cops, but the flashing of a cop badge is a sound psychological trick
I object to that
Uhhh
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
so I still can't have it
I mean you can always order someone to step on you
orz
under the heel where we belong
You know what, that's a solid enough reason for me to vote against it
I'll go where you all point me but I feel I can accomplish as much from here, generally
I plan to abstain from every vote involving my promotion unless we become really that short on staff
ok
Huh
the sadist in me says it'd be funny to pull the rug out from under her at the 11th hour but I feel we debated this pretty decently yesterday
Bridge bunnies could be intense blue
We're going to disallow staff from participating in the endrole consumer aspect of kiricoins, right?
I do have friends
*sobs*
`so Latooni can have Elfnein blue`
ü§î
*cpu quietly smokes*
My cpu is smoking at home just thinking about me installing software capable of that
~~where is our fine emote~~
Thank you R
Not really as optimistic as I'd like a profile picture to be
ü§î
<a:micha_nodding:432434127149727744>
That is a fair point
Could just make it yourself even
Trans flag? There's got to be etsy or shit for that
If we ever really want to do dumb meme shit we can just ask the rest of staff if it's okay
I mean I'm fine with being locked out
Do we really need special kiricoin compensation
We have nepotism type perks as it is
R i want a good screengrab of shul shagana chris
I feel like I need a good elfnein avatar
<a:MariaBlush:448756431785820171>
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
I was smart enough to be concerned about it
it can be... abused and misused but it's a neat concept
do we want to let members give coins to other members
well this way custodian gold is held back
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
glad to see you're no longer tied up
welcome back alice-chan
<:Elf9Seal:432752319017254914>
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
~~I think it's a one way crush~~
<@&336302034070536192> someone please wake up üò¶
I want another moderators input on Yorin because I want to kick him over this and I need to be talked down to just a warning
that's "slap on the wrist" shit
I'll let her fucking slide on that one
no fuck that
oh, that was right after Yorin said the shit about her being a woman
she goes too far here
(I'm compiling my notes here, sorry)
Okay, reading through this, so far my opinion is that Hazel's being a little pushy, but on the other hand, WFC and Solo are playing the "you don't live there so you don't *know* maaaaaaaaan" card
also I knew solo was isreali but oh boy he's a zionist
this is actionable though
I'm still reading through it
oh
why did hazel leave
I'm not convinced
not so sure
Solo could have probably been straightened out with user-led moderation but Hazel
Was that public? hm
we can deal with once every 3 months
This is the first public disciplinary action I think I've ever witnessed on the server
Three warnings got handed out in a row, with a kick - *publically*
I think us performing action on these things *reinforces* the fact that this is a safe space
I think there's a positive effect from this though
like, what, should they apply for a timeslot to discuss in or something goofy
I can't think of anything that would have prevented this other than somehow banning the topic or having a moderator awake
still the only one with the good taste to rep elfnein
I am more sympathetic to Hazel's point of view on this than the zionist view
for the record in case this comes up again
I *think* she/her
nothing registered
hold on I try to use discord notes for this
but really Israel's an ignorable problem, or would be if they'd *stop committing atrocities*
Hazel's point of view that Israelis don't belong there is valid and fine but it's not the only point of view, but she's not wrong for having it - especially since she really does also probably think the same of other places like America
It'll probably be eased by the fact that Solo got a warning, Yorin got a kick and a final warning, and WFC got a warning
yes, I still remember the tone policing card she tried to throw down
wow my l key sucks
Probaby just a talking to
I'm not really sure how to handle Hazel if she comes back
yes
Israel isn't really reasonable and Hazel's probably more in the right than Solo, but I agree that she was just too out there
Delete and move on
bleh
I more want a way to clear <#448237561085952001> when people goof without doing it manually
not really what I want
hm
in the documentation
the prune says it deletes nadeko's messages
oh right she has a mute
to delete messages
<@!102691114762371072> does kiri have a wipe command
What a shit thing to read first in the morning
This situation was awful enough I'm for public warnings
Because I'm all for like, a suspension, at least
We going to just warn yorin?
Hazel was also being too pushy, which makes that last part harder
Solo is in the wrong but doesn't see it
Yorin needs action
hazel left over it
a long read
it's
serious
I'd argue it's still less public unless you have a greeter bot though
yeah
It does, if she's prideful
joining is a public act that gets telegraphed to everyone
I *more or less* agree that she's likely to, but there's a barrier
Lemme give you the biggest reason I think might deter her from coming back R
It's the kind of place that lets frustration bounce off of each other until you get "die cis scum"
I see the edges of them on twitter a lot
I'm sure she has a small discord or friend community that share similar vehemently expressed views as her
I doubt she's in for a rude awakening
I'm not going to be so arrogant as to think she doesn't know what other communities are like
I think I hope she does but <#336297840529899522> will be less thorny if she doesn't
I'm not going to claim she is or isn't coming back
english
what
if it's several days from now we wait until the next time she goes off
depends how far in the future it is
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
ok ok
Until we jump to banning him for trolling, the most we can do is ask them to not post in serious discussion if they claim they have no maleficent intentions
This is behavior difficult to call out
I'll make a note
see if we have context this changes things
I don't want to ascribe ill intent to where it isn't
Do you have a reason to be paranoid on this
actionable
that's
She had called solo "dense" and "insane" at that point
lemme check where it was at that point
2 in the morning?
same image alice
far too many recorded atrocities
far too many facts to throw at him
there's
I think it would have happened eventually
Solo was pretty set in "Isreal did nothing wrong - okay it did but *what do you know*"
we want to be ~professional~
keep the formatting right
search it for context
```dess_warn```
ok
but that's just a guess
probably because he knows it's a really bad fucking look
also he's *really* sounding like a Zionist who wants to deny being a Zionist, just fyi
I fully admit I don't understand the pressures of being Israeli but I don't see what about that means someone can't say "fuck the state of Israel"
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
R I will end you if you say it
and like, saying "it's complicated and you don't get it" isn't the problem so much as he circled back to it several times
"It's complicated and here's a reason why" *has a chance*
"It's complicated and you don't get it" will never do that
"would this expression of a position theoretically persuade *anyone*, whether they were in the discussion or not"
I think a metric would be
well, actually, leaving is fine
You're allowed to feel hurt from these discussions and feelings are valid but it's a *dialogue* and you can't just go "WELL YOU JUST DON'T KNOW" and leave
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>

Enjoy your vacation Alice. Make Otakon cuter by being there.
There is probably something to what you say but due to my personal experiences and beliefs I will never support muzzling or muting this subject on that channel without specific and extenuating circumstances
Someone else might really need to
I don't want to establish a rule that says you can't do that
Actually it's only the historia that sucks
Cursed texts
I'm still the only Elfnein <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
And even beyond that, *everyone* is worth something
You both are worth and deserve support and care and it's not how much you contribute or produce that determines that, but how much you try to be good people and care for others to the best of your abilities
Here to remind everyone but especially to reaffirm to R and Kriisa that personal worth is not a measurement or even necessarily a correlation to what you produce ‚ù§
Yes
I'm sure she did
and dealing with *things*
I thought it was more nuanced than that but I was tired too
But I'd have to read back and check
I actually don't recall her saying much of anything about *people from israel*
_rolls eyes_
good morning
why did parm leave
ok song it is
and it'd be a lot of me talking to thin air from her point of view
I don't really want to bug elise even if Kriisa's company is always lovely
already got a room
I'll host
lulu?
where do you want to get on voice because even if it's one way explaining is easier and tts' codec sucks though we can use it if you want
oh do you want to do tts shit
<@456226577798135808> you going to be around for a while
the alien is god
the someone bent over
that's fine
ü§î
<@102691114762371072> you're adorable
It had even occurred to me that was the problem
I'm fine with no drunkposting
Kerrik weekly posts 4chan memes in hiero that are slightly too far that I delete
I think parm is a reasonable candidate but think now is not the time and she needs more time to be observed in tricky discussions
Also, ew, white woman with dreads
I second that I don't have a desire to be a policeman without influence to stop a system I care about from breaking

Please be careful of the politics of this channel so that it never reaches that point
I want to mention we're reaching the mod population threshold where most decisions tend to be made by majority rather than by consensus and that's a different dynamic
It's less amusing to have the mods joke about sockpuppeting
I'm going to politely ask to stop the doppelganger jokes on public
If scrmz is going to be a mod which I still haven't even really thought about
Actually
I'm at work and there are lots of customers
If my input on anything is desired please postpone it
He is young
I'm on a 10 which is mostly over
gg
Were they fruitful
Education
If your base goal is to care about people, the light clicks eventually
We love you girl and I had faith you'd get it
I don't think this stuff was easy for any of us to learn
If you do appreciate the context, does that lessen the harm it does to viewers?
Yeah
Alice do you have the equality comic
I guarantee you everyone in this channel contributed to the system here somehow, it takes effort, education, and time to fight it
Uh thanks kiri
Girl calm down I'm not accusing you of anything of the sort
For the record I had a very strong "but that's not fair" response the first time someone tried to tell me this
The system can be cruel without ill intent from the constituents
I'm in the same boat. It's why it's systemic, because it takes little to no active malice on the part of the perpetrating culture to sustain itself

It just takes a lack of awareness and empathy
Does that make sense? It's not because you're *white*, it's because you belong to the culture that trod straight over them and it's harmful
The fact that you like them or not isn't really relevant. The pertinent aspect is it's one of the million cuts to slighted minorities and taking a cultural symbol when you don't belong to the culture directly manifests as a microaggression if someone from the culture sees it
As it generally involves someone deciding for themselves that it's okay
For the record the solidarity argument is really sketch
There is not a power differential I am using here
Discrimination and bigotry maybe but racism is systemic by nature and I guarantee that's not at play here
And for the record the rude thing is wearing them in the first place. Going "hey cool I want that"  to an aspect of cultural identity for a group that's been sidelined, mocked, and screwed over is in bad taste
Ok
Customer
Since it requires a lot of extra work with the hair she was born with
It's a form of cultural appropriation I find particularly bad
it was lucifer
refrain from that
I'll uh
Whoops
if you want to follow up on it Alice, I'd give it a day in between
agreed
that's possibly bad
uh
agreed
let me know when to drag him into the chat
since everyone already had a vote over it, I'll not bother thinking further on it and just officially log it as an abstain because I was too busy with work
but I also concede that he has experience, and he seems to at least be pointed the right direction
and I feel like his youth is a concern with the subjects and principles that guide this server, of which the discussion we had today shows that those of us here, who are 5-10 years older than him, are still struggling with
I... don't know him that well
scrmz
so
ok
I'll think about it
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
Don't want to write about a game show? Choose parents
What if we try more focused prompts but give them options
R was online a second ago
is now a good time
good question
it doesn't really matter where they're based as long as that's true
we just need someone awake when we're asleep
Lauren feels like the only other choice I can think of and she's not enough of an entity here yet
we can do alchemist
if we're worried, for *whatever* reason
I think I don't have a problem
He showed genuine care and attempt for WFC in his *moods*
I had a bad first impression with him trying to desperately get into the tabletop game, but he's not really done anything wrong in the time he's been here
I don't know him too well
oh so I actually need to input
didn't everyone but me and lyssa say yes
expect me to pull the scrmz switch tomorrow when most of you are up
I enjoy your words alice <:MikuSinging:421435301731368960>

because episode 5 right near halloween
how soon do you want to do the flipflappers watch
alice
I can get why you'd be alarmed when someone said that, but there's ways to peel back the mask in that case
just about every newsworthy thing Israel does?
well
Okay that's a concern but it's also a tool to shut down people who have a problem with
I just watched episode 5 of flip flappers and it might have been some of the best horror directing I've seen in a decade
which may or may not be anti-semetic
to be anti-israel is to think that you do not think that the jewish people are entitled to a nation
for the record I don't think being anti-israel is anti-semetic, it's to be anti-zionist

so many people turning out to be trans

every single color role has at least one member
since R is in hell I'll do the prompt

ok
Oh, the symphogear rewatch that'll be tied into r/anime
What other secret projects do we have planned
<:KiriWhoops:442974593498611732>
"oh I guess this is just mod chat okay oh wait no my friend's a girl"
yeah I couldn't take it seriously for a good few minutes because I thought it was just standard horseplay
within the week of me getting access to the channel
you hatched like
It was a vote for Custodian
ish
2 months
"Hi Latooni we think you're pretty cool would you like to be a mod and oh yeah we need you to pick who's running the server"
~~this is nice, why did I immediately have to get thrust into a major adminstrative decision the instant I was onboarded~~
oh yeah I wasn't watching general chat haha
üëç
Kriisa already knows but the whole "scrmz is Saki's alt" joke should probably stop at this point, at least in public, on this server
One other thing
Oh
anything you see in here *stays in here*
there have been personality conflicts and issues we've never let leak onto the rest of the server
speaking of this channel, you now have access to logs of this channel
the warn format is also pinned in this channel
when Yorin made that "just like a woman" comment that's really what pushed everything to be made into public warnings
then a public warning and admonition may be warranted
UNLESS it's a huge breach
Yeah, in here is best
When we warn we have *a format* of which you see in warning #1 there
dess_warnlog <@!127644949884698624>
```dess_warn username warning text``` sends a PM to the user from Kirichan and logs it in her memory
<@290431224596660224> the biggest tool you'll need to know about is dess_warn
Okay so
no I will not be stifled <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>

`quietly foreshadows`
oh ok
oh gmod is foreshadowing
what are we foreshadowing becase I've got loads to foreshadow
it was mostly "huh this person follows alice and her posts are decent, so I shall follow back"

I wouldn't do that
Please Kriisa
There's probably a lot of the 'culture' I'll have trouble accepting, or accepting that it's okay for me to be part of it
I have a *lot* of baggage from being the cis ally on the side for so long and being implicitly told where I have to wait at the door, so to speak, so... yeah, I can't really find egg jokes funny in my case, I guess
I suspect I chose the easy answer because anything else was scary
I've faced the question 2 or so years ago
Anyway, please don't refer to me as cracking
I'm considering it, yes
Girl stuff feels too kinda right to be cis but boy stuff doesn't feel wrong
I *suspect* I'll end up being bigender but ü§∑
boy and girl are both okay
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
Because I already know you've always got my back, sunshine
that said I expect a speedy promotion to join the trans custodian oligarchy
we have scrmz now
no
What the hell, I'll do it now.

For the last two weeks I've been kind of doing a lot of navel gazing and pondering because some things have been really bugging me. I've finally arrived at a partial answer to my own questions:

I'm not cis. (Discord's new spellcheck doesn't recognize cis. Fuck discord.) I don't know what exactly I *am* yet, as it may be merely a girl, but is more likely some flavor of nonbinarism like genderfluid or bigender, but... Not cis, and I think I'm tired of forcing the jigsaw pieces to fit to that.

I'll probably need a few more weeks to fully examine all the pieces and make some decisions, but in the mean time I'd like my pronouns to be adjusted to she/her and/or he/him - yes that means you can keep calling me he and I won't care, but you guys are my friends and I wanted to update you. They/them *doesn't really feel right* for me so I'd prefer that not being your primary term for me specifically.

Um, I guess that's all I really had to say. <:KiriWhoops:442974593498611732>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

how many hours a day of this do you play
If we do monthly we should open up multiple entries and expand the page limit to like 2-10
I was thinking of doing a single day for feedback based on the single submission I've gotten and doing another choose three thing with more specific scenarios on the following day to see how reception is to that, with the option to move to monthly after that
People seem to want more restrictions in prompts
all the hugs to you

and `A friendly argument becomes heated. Very heated. What is it, and what happens?` for number 3
will be #2
`Alternate Universe: Ex-villain becomes a gear user. How does the first deployment go down?`
I think
It'll be one of three options
and people are chafing at it
I want something on the dark side because everything's been so light and fluffy
how's this for an option
`Some of the characters in Symphogear escape without sufficient penance for their actions shown on-screen. Show us a world where at least one character pays a price for what they did. Jail, community service, exile, or something else.`
dess_remind me 6h prompts
thanks kiri
dess_remind <#336299788792496129> 1m test
<@!102691114762371072>
alice can probably be persuaded otherwise
for <:gokigenyo:246346856286650369>
we're considering timing it so that episode 5 happens on halloween
and let people resubmit as many times as they like
but maybe we'll hold off MEGAMULTI OPTION for when we try out the month-long way
with 1 generic
I don't mind expanding to 4 options
honestly, with the expectation that we're handing out specific scenarios
remember, they have *options* so it's okay to have a grim one
Another one was `A week has gone by since one of the gear users has fallen in battle. What's it like at SONG?`
<@456226577798135808> I'd like to look at the survey suggestions you've got
no
it's an altenrate spelling
yes
one idea was `Altenrate Universe: Ex-villain becomes a gear user. How does the first deployment go down?`
we'll push the deadline to monday night in response
There's no reason to wait till next week when we have no prompts
the ~surprise event~ was that I was going to start the next week right here, today or tomorrow, with specific prompts for 2 options and a more general third
Actually
it's even harder irl
orz
even if it's impossible to notice
so it's a trans switch
its *splatoon neon pink*
the left isn't neon red
I had to pay like 60 bucks to replace the joycon *I will demand gratification on this small side benefit*
alice look at my switch in <#337805317276565525>
just like Chris sang it when she had a home
Kriisa's going to welcome both her Chris figures and herself to her new life by playing Monochrome when she finally has a home
besides design theory
Progress isn't going to happen before Monochrome gets played
One roll per fic seems reasonable
I don't want to bust the economy over writing fics
we should assume that anyone who submits is going to be giving feedback
people cannot
machines can translate easily
no
Submitting can be 70, feedback can be 30
I would prefer either 10, 100, or 1000
1000 or less
at least 10
I don't think we should ever do more than a participation bonus for writing though, unless we roll out bonus bounty challenges
+1 if elfnein is adorable
I agree with you that changing it up and down barring special events is fucked
based on the participation levels
We'll make a one-time assessment when we roll out kiricoins how much writing prompts should be worth
That's what I mean
but we can have the number be higher if submissions are slack
I say we probably award kiricoins no matter what because it's community participation in a community event
because that gets a thread
also uh, the next prompt, too
üëå
so if they sleep on the other prompts for now it could still work out
and then create extra content on it
One of the hidden goals is to get someone to go "I wish I explored that idea more"
in fact
If shooting a fucking shotgun of prompts out every other week is what it takes to guarantee a better flow, it's not hard to come up with them
The goal is to get people to write, for other people to appreciate the writing, and to grow a sense of community
that's fine
depending on the author
I like 2 the most, because it can be drama, tragedy, or comedy
yeah we'll see
I'm gonna pull the trigger
any objections on the prompt options
so
oh good god
what if we get a madman who does Ver in a gear
come on
but
She's a candidate and if people want to write about her first deployment I won't stop them
if not I'll take a try at it tomorrow or something
<@!127644949884698624> if you could do the wrap-up post to credit outside998 with the single submission on the subreddit that would be really awesome
In the future submissions will earn kiricoins
Much more open ended than the other two
maybe
we'll see
in case you actually write
I think you're just going to have zero motivation but
oh dear
alice needs <:weed:394025071951216640> to balance out the <:15min:453039155975553035>
ha
ye he's shit
you needed it man
fair
though we had good reception to it this time
by the way R you're free to write one of the prompts if you've got time on the weekend, unless schoolwork's getting you
oh those teachers are always fun
n i c e
"I'm gay" > fuckin 4 retweets 20 likes ezpz trans twitter has no chill
as an aside
you're a very nice enby and it's very uncomfortable to be in the shoes of an abusive jerk
you picked a difficult story
is school everything you thought and dreamed it could be
o/
yeah it's still the colloquialism
back from when registers had bells on them
which is a hell of an anachronism
ringing up a customer
not in retail world
it's not
I think the context *really matters* here
absolute cunt to his trans daughter
~~gonna be fuckin busy sunday night~~
WOW I just realized it's a good thing I made the deadline monday night
Kriisa you're good at like everything, of course you're not useless
ask away
I'm basically second in command of a 2.5 mil a year store
Keeps everything faster
because you have to pull it out all the time to make change
you divide the currency as you put it in
Ohh yeah
so this is part of my job
I'm literally a manager
Can you explain?
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/785/524/8fc.gif
also I thought the compact mirror gadgets and makeup kits and stuff were cute
but it was fucking fetish fuel
*dirty thoughts* about that show
young me had
GO has good gags once or twice an episode but it isn't worth losing teen titans for
I fucking loved raven as a 15 year old
teen titans was good
wonder woman's cat should have been invisible
code lyoko was after my time *oh my god I'm the oldest here*
anyway there's a lot of really good gundam injokes
which is bad, but underrated because there's a lot of -yes
but the one you're thinking of is probably SD Gundam Force
there were a number of SD gundams
oh
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/8/8f/GF13-050NSW_Nobel_Gundam_Front.png/revision/latest?cb=20120818132217
it was bad
it was gundam seed
there was a gundam reboot
the series is less about growth and more about repeating the things that made the original good, determined to make every successor a pale echo of the original by force
the gundam trap
the damage that was retconned out in the bluray <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
he survived to reverse the chateau
threw him off the edge
she failed to kill him at one point
but so much else was wonky
the elfnein/carol thing they were doing in the second half of GX was really good
I really liked how elfnein was a personification of her doubts and suspicion that she was fucking up
I think if they had 18 episodes and didn't ~~waste them on the girls~~ misuse them she would have been compelling
also for the record carol was almost a good character
this is a pretty massive hateboner
damn, alice
_glances at twitter_
*fuck you dexter's lab*
a new season from a different director and with a different art style
you know what's worse than a reboot or ending badly
oh this is Alice being Alice
right so where's the problem
or something
because dna scan
did the watch gain new forms
it's really easy to sell toys
same reason kamen rider keeps going
so many good shows didn't make it
afsffffffffffffffffffffffff
`only one season`
"I only have 30 projects I need another one"
alice you're almost as bad as Kriisa
alice


megas XLR was done by serious robot fans
what an underrated show
along with the angry scientist
General Specific and Private Public
OH
What were the military guys?
Sheep in the big city was amazing and deserved more than one season
he's in semi-retirement now because he got hearing damage
oh shit my best friend at work was an audio technician on the first two seasons of power rangers
I watched power rangers on its original run *I am so old*
fucking doug
see now I'm showing my age
was that a doug spinoff
but yeah Aunt Katie fucking ruled
maybe there was starch in it idk
it's thick because it's *fucking cold*
CRTs just smoothed it out for you
green applesauce
no it's just
it's also *fucking cold*
applesauce
it's
no
yeah I ate the slime
y'all want to know what slime is
**AND I GOT SLIMED**
got to go to the Nickelodeon place and tour the studio and Keenan and Kel were filming
got to cut in all the lines
So I got to go to Universal Studios with her
His sister was, at one point, a lawyer for Nickelodeon
I hardly knew my Dad and I visited him like... 4 times ever so whatever, BUT
Okay so
YEAH
HEY IS THIS A GOOD TIME TO MENTION I MET KEENAN AND KEL
`All That`
just turned!
Just turned 29!
üëÄ
You have a taste and I align with it
Well
You have good taste
I really enjoy getting your likes tbh
Yes
So many surprise girldicks
Showing your friends' likes on Twitter is such a bullshit thing
If someone says "that's funny though" please consider giving them a warning
'Was it funny' what the hell
*puts bread on her shitlist*
I think you're right
Always be horny on main
Oh
?
~~This means Kriisa has two switches~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You'll cave eventually R
Reggie can do no wrong
I'm still in stitches over a Twitter post that called notch an incel Willy wonka
But I'll refrain
I really really want to tear them apart for "well if it's fun I'll get it no matter what" mindset
Toleration of microaggressions because it's not a big deal to *me*
This is what systemic oppression looks like but I'm not opening that can right now
sense my fucking defeat as I enter the next room
I really like this one because you can just

<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
ok
Saki hates everything that tastes good
action movie watch is a strong option yeah
what in the world can we do that's suitable for hibiki's birthday
and it's a big one
september 13th is the next birthday
the term is capsize
between you and Alice and Kriisa and I the boat would always be rocking
sounds like a nauseating experience
I refuse to believe he's never considered boycotting or ignoring someone or some company because they've held anti-isreali views
funny because I'd think he'd know what it'd be like to drop someone's ass because they said something against your ways
for the little one
headpat
thus she was born first
Kriisa will hit her birthday first
Kriisa was born before you
you're younger
not you
wait, you're turning 24?
I thought you were going on a different angle here
ohhh
~~I have given her enough shit over being a toddler~~
but this is more of a forum trick than a chatroom one
the tricky ones are the ones that create the alts before they get banned
discord's such an effective replacement
it has
ah
that's probably larger than #hearthstone
it's just kind of shit
ps fuck espernet
I have never run into that and I'm an op on a relatively large espernet channel
and yes people can get around it but they give up a lot faster because it's more of a pain
collateral damage is usually preferrable to having no defense
it's not something you do lightly but you do it when you have to
yeah this isn't a new problem
why is this not a feature
love how IRC is superior to discord in that you can *IP ban*
hahaha what
I failed out of entire possible futures <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'm not saying you should snitch but you should not stick around that group if that starts going down
ye
such bad trigger discipline
GUN!
that reference made me so happy
Did someone say [Pussysplitter, Blessed Blade of the Dickseeker]?
_shoves a pen into your hands and takes the cards away_
I'd want to be a spider though
moths are so cute!!
I see the weed is working
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
all hands on whose dick
dess_. Alice you are the weeditor
oh boy
and then you were going to make me read it
fuck
WRITE
<@!127644949884698624> GET OFF HEARTHSTONE
`prompts`
hm
oh I misread
self torment is applicable punishment
chris and miku were actually who I had in mind for the prompt
because this is *heavy*
And... I really hope it's not the only one!
I've got a submission!
lemme know if you need hugs
it's almost like weed makes you not want to put out effort
her twitter spews lava every time she tries to write it
yeah it's fine? I couldn't tell which parts were written under inebriation and which weren't
I wish everyone could enjoy the surreal experience that is wake-up texts from Kriisa
dess_remind me 10h read Alice's weedfic
can I read it tomorrow morning
this was just an experiment and it's okay if it didn't work
you're a good girl alice
a nonon for everyone
she goes hard in her quest for satsuki pussy
nonon quite possibly does harder shit
<:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
_arrests R_
because if you lose it's the fault of everyone who isn't you
I suppose co-operative games get it worse
well, some like hearthstone fix the problem by not letting you interact
I wonder what the threshold of popularity is before a game inevitably becomes awful
cute
f5ing
very willing on that end
Miku will be uh
I want you to know your suffering has been entertaining to watch from afar on this matter
It's really good
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
But I'm still thinking
Due to my car if nothing else
I will probably not move during high winter
Because I was serious
I mean for my contribution
I guess it depends
How much a month do you want
Ahhh
It's possible it can't be next to anyone's
The router can't be next to everyone's pc
As long as you're willing that's fine babe
Hope you're willing to change that or it'll be a real limitation when you move
`don't have a Wi-Fi card`
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
You're running before you jogged and you're getting winded because it's hard
Write stuff you don't have to be so invested in just to get your volume up
You should probably take a break from the transbikki au after this piece
Headpat
Tell him to be more aware of what he says and to not let it happen again I guess
If he apologizes *right now* he can get off the hook
I think he can't pull out of this
Yeah I'm having way more fun lewding Kriisa in live shitposting than watching this
Otherwise...
If he immediately apologizes for it I say let him off
This is the same class of infraction
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
The president of the United States respects him naturally
Among other things
He said the Sandy hook elementary shooting was a faked media production to get gun control
Alex Jones got caught looking at trans porn what a day
IS LEGAL HERE BISH
_prepares tranq dart_
and ironically there's only *one* minon mage card that really was needed
remember when people thought minion mage would be a meme
<@!127644949884698624> do you have a computer logged into <#336297840529899522> as the active window or something
oh my god
but in return it was a pretty rich casual experience for almost its entire decade long life
yeah they missed making it a competitive sport
They also can't seem to decide if they're balancing for the top 500 players or the casual population
very very much a "sand every sharp corner off" approach
overwatch had a strong start but the balance team doesn't seem to know how to maintain forward momentum
team fortress 3 would probably be better than overwatch
there is no such game, there is only an unrelated "dohtah two"
Kriisa is really cute
I would have more input on these rules but
headpat
they just wanted a freebie
`yeehaw`
they no longer have Kriisa as a friend
apparently they had Kriisa as a friend before they got banned
through girls' frontline yes
Alice I wanted you to know Kriisa is using yeehaw on her team
anyway, the one who bragged about trolling servers
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
Kriisa has reminded me that Vali was the one who bragged abou
I'm being watched
hi Kriisa
no remorse
no hesitation
Kriisa went "fug u" and blocked them
she had a message from some Vali and we recalled it was ibu's friend who got banned or something and they wanted a kirika dess audio file or something
I just watched Kriisa stone cold destroy someone in girls frontline
for the last part
same
oh
colorado is
does weed make one not feel like trash
Yeah no it's never going to be mentioned
bonus super gay keyboard courtesy of Alice
for scrmz


oh shit
*activity*
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I can and will burn out if I'm to be available to do it at any time
For the record I am interested in helping people
If you put that in the rules then staff is defacto going to have to deal with it, whether you're available right now or not
\:(
me too
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
üò¶
no
I know the feeling, and it's the worst shit in the world, but it would mean a lot to us, to me, for you to still be here
I assume the feeling isn't new for you and you know it'll lighten up later
dang
Can you tell me a bit about how your current deck is doing
'just' ideation like it's a small thing
is this just ideation or is this "I want to do it"
We love you Alice
dang I've been there a lot lately
well you can't just turn it off
what is riajuu
I am once again impressed
yes yes Kriisa you're talented at a disgusting amount of things
*calls nintendo about the hacked DS*
oh nice
whee
yeah I do that without weed
Do we know who left
can we make a Color Me Ver and give it to everyone for his birthday
does Ver have a birthday
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Did discord change something? Because now all of the names are broken except the people who came back
Just leave it for today
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Today
Have you eaten to say
Hey remember how type moon is totally working on a tsukihime remake üôÉ
That term means nothing to me
I thought you meant a western release for a second
Oh
Tsukihime actually came out?
06? 07?
I read it in
It has flaws and it's long but I'm considering rereading
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
No
As in the computer
there is a very big pile of "little things that upset me" in my life and a very small pile of things of "things that make me happy" right now
very sick of my life tbh

cannot wait for Nightmare Prompt October to do its wrath on Solo
I think the thought was someone hosting a kung fu movie watch night?
(MariaxSheldon otp?)
Like "write a self-insert" "make everyone goth" "cross-over with the worst show you've ever watched"
Give people *nightmare challenges*
I'd really like Kiricoins by October because I'd like to do something unusual with the prompts for that month
how are you doing girl
more importantly
I told lone not to use "trigger" to apply to people unless he knew what he was doing with it, he settled down quickly, and yorin jumped into the conversation for no real good reason
konbanwa arisu-chan
I was legitimately mad at his fucking attempts to hide behind the dictionary
<:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
I'm still mulling over both the "write a prompt to continue a past prompt submission of any author (including yourself)" and the "write the worst symphogear 2-3 page fanfiction" prompt ideas but if either pass muster they'll be saved for special occasions
yes?
I've already done so
I see him typing in a sensitive conversation
is this when yorin gets himself banned
I don't have plans to do anything except hibernate today
yeah I can do it
Shakes, ideation, anxiety spikes
I've had low blood sugar absolutely destroy me
Have you eaten
And on a personal note, having you as an available resource and person to talk to in my life means something, Alice, and has helped me at times
good, do that
Something can be arranged but probably not ultra short notice, is it possible you can hold on for a bit longer?
save it for a winter holiday thing
and then have more normal stuff
that they all must be about *cold*
I might make a overall condition for all three prompts
Do you think a snow day prompt is good enough or am I going to have to go full on skating prompt
in case anyone is wondering why jacq is being so pushy about user submitted prompts
go on
oh I'm going to need help compiling the submissions into a reddit post
`I'm taking partial credit for this one`
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

Maybe I'll just go with conspiracy for #3
It's the more freeform option, but maybe I want to go more open
But maybe it's good
Not sure on this one
`Character A has decided it is time for Character B to learn a new skill or overcome a weakness, and they'll use persuasion, trickery, or force to make it happen.`
I'd ideally like the third one to not be locked to symphogear
I need one more
`Elfnein has designed a new upgrade or piece of equipment. Show it in action`
This one is good though
`The UN has decided SONG should double as PR. The girls are now celebrities. Write a scene of them dealing with being under a camera lens`
Not sold on it
ü§î
`What if Sakurai Theory had been widely published when discovered? Where would the girls be?`
Thinking about a focus on what-ifs
Worshipping tomorrow's prompts
because our writers do not need loose association
If their writers are anything like our writers they'll also run into trouble with the idea of short prompts or one-word things
My ADD makes me bad at actually doing creative writing but I'm really good with ideas for writing

I'm low key highly looking forward to coordinating avatars again
That stuff can be really fun to work out but you *need someone to bounce off of*

I want to point out that it is actually a concern to be down a top-level moderation staff involving one of our users who is frequently cause for concern

We'll also need a server icon
my pc is acting up
It's tomorrow
dess_.. timeline
mmmm dick
Kriisa is moving in less than a week but we can ask her to work on it after that
Maybe?
I need an evil elfnein picture
I mean it's an idea I want to try because *I want to inflict horrible things during october* but
I'm not seeing why submission rate would spike higher
80-90% of the time
people do shit during the week and write during the weekend
there's a flaw, mind you
I was thinking about testing a more rapid thing in october, yeah
I'm going to push back on the month long idea right *now* because October has so many possibilities I don't want to blow the whole thing to get like 7 prompts out of it for the month
that's not sustainable I don't think
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
this time it's 3
especially for school starting
5 is pretty good
I think I had 5 last time
sounds right

I'm not really wise, ~~I'm just really old~~

You can read her statements as a manifestation of brazillian machismo
I mean it's possible
I know some people do it but it's such a *weird* concept to me
I can't imagine trying to date without being friends first
"this might be crazy, but what if I'm friends with the girl *and* want to fuck her?"
*modestly*
Armor split was just a way to get you to grind twice as much
Slightly different shoulder armor

He was 14 and a big guy and I don't think any other weapon would have let his father accomplish what he did, and... I still liked guns, for a while, but that thought would never leave my head
A good middle school friend of mine died to his father's murder suicide
I'm glad it stopped there
Ah
I had the romance forcibly taken from me
I used to really like guns
If you don't know every possible place the round could end up you shouldn't be aiming it there

I've been so preoccupied with uh
I need to write reddit posts and do the prompt things but *spoons*

well yeah you were like 14 and all 14 year olds are terrible
And no, Kriisa, I reached out to her as a friend, so it's not solely your cross
I'm imagining getting judgement passed on me because of a mistake I did 4 years ago and that's a horrid feeling
It's going to be rough on her but I concede the reasoning
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
That is a long time
I don't like banning on the advice of someone 4 years out of touch for the record
Dealing with this is not going to be fun
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Oh
Haha
yeah I'm going with 'both'
I think you'd be going to both
the server would either be mortified or unsurprised
this has been an *interesting* voice chat
Gonna be honest
Alice is typing this quote so I don't get it wrong
sorry hun
the highly active part of our server is what, like 30 people?
not ideal but okay
I think it's okay
Mountain dew ice is too acid

2 pings I mean
but we had 2 in 2 days
nah
the pattern holds true
oh snap someone else got the elfnein color
Especially since shaming shit like muscles can trigger dysphoria *in others*
And that's fine but the solution is to mute the channel if there is content they find that triggers dysphoria rather than to police everyone else with tsubasadisgust emotes

Saki and I are going out again and so please take that into consideration should, god forbid, action need to be taken

you are the one who brought up 'defuse' first

it's worth being aware of them
I think you're underselling things here R, the fact that you "defused" a user doesn't mean they aren't a bomb, and aren't a bomb going forward
It also really does feel like lectriclord is being disingenuous and being very "why are you liking what I don't like, that's wrong"
I'll say that I don't think lectriclord was doing anything wrong but was about 2 sentences from moving into adjacent, harmful concepts
"they were gross at one point so why can they be thought of as hot ever' is *not* a thought process I want on the server
It does feel icky to me

I like the idea of a few cards per week you can straight up buy that rotate
ironically since we're not charging money, we don't have to be as generous with manipulating the RNG
I'm kind of against coupons to get the exact card you want
going to have a baaad day in the morning
I intend to be distracting tomorrow
have fun
I gueeeeeeeess
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
because I do not want Kriisa pushing herself to finish a game in like 4 days when she has, like, a life
the only reason I'd want it earlier is to encourage participation in bad fictober
oh she is no longer online
she's online in lulubus if you want to admire her
yeah it's fine, especially as we'd not implement any of the things that would cause harmful behavior loops
<a:badelaugh:428703436566036481>
I'm not sure I can trust this coming from an enby who exclaims with joy when a game gives them timers
I have been informed that that is not what it is
it'd work like the .pick thing on val's server I imagine
but like for something like being very supportive and helpful to another user
yeah though we should probably codify what circumstances we should be encouraging
prompt submissions is one but we need a primary
I inflicted a terrible version of that ED on alice the other day
oh god
<:Kiricoin:473685957330206731>
previously I just watched the first few seconds
yeah I actually watched it and it was pretty trash
it's the n word used in a colloquial, reclaimed fashion
Hm
on april fools day we hand out MS paint cards with lena on them <:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
there are a few elfnein memorias though
<@290431224596660224> Genjuurou has a unit card, elfnein does not in XDU
I think launching gatcha in October and the game in nov-dec makes sense
I don't know how much bandwidth Kriisa bought
Yeah
It'd be good practice anyway
Can you write a thing, not right now, that shoves every card in a set onto a webpage to view
Launch should have some special stuff on top
This is for common pool btw
It makes sure they're the more basic designs added to XDU earlyish
But just show attacks should keep it simple
We can add in some GX to round it out I guess
How about just attacks that were in s1 and G
The rng crack thing
Pulls, whatever
They should be valuable because they are scarce, since they have no other reason to be valuable yet
Packs should be harder to open and less commonly opened
I think before the game launches
That one image was the only problem
Seems fine
This feels like bragging ü§î
Hey successful feature activation
Feature request: a default name scheme so we do not *have* to name them
<:Kiricoin:473685957330206731>
I was thinking just use emoji

~~I can't remember how to do it on my model~~
It appears as a null line
No, it's like a 0 pixel image or something else equally impossible to select in mobile
Image for my second card did not load
It's a good name
I named it
Roll the bones, in lulubus
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I haven't got any cards
So phantom I can't see them
I got all the phantom girls
Kriisa's integrity is way too high to do something like that to a big project anyway
I was making joke
Maybe you got a sign backwards
Check the favoritism module
I am being a good tester by breaking things

Tell them about the wonders of vore, the weak will leave
Just name it "[girl]" "[girl] 2" etc if you don't mind checking the names, maybe
Can Maria tell which girl an image is without you constructing a new database
Also a rename function
Like type "." to get the default name
Going to rerequest an option to let Mariabot name gears for you for the dull pulls
Gay telepathy
What if you add flagship color to embed

Like just hold off on a few days for the total gatcha package
I don't think we should launch this without kiricoins?
You need to implement store integration
she's not explicitly asking but that wouldn't hold up in a court of law as a defense
is Rakhi asking for upvotes okay or not okay

you might also want to look at what each girl is *bad* at or weak to
`Maria: Self-deprecates`

what's the currency give command
for teams
the role thing is good though
tch
is there any way to give out the same amount of coins to multiple users at once with one command
it feels like a bad idea to me
I just feel weird about the idea of the staff ending up the richest on the server because they have the opportunity to do things that others don't
but Kriisa absolutely deserves something
it is not generally great for us to have more resources than the users
I mean I'd rather the staff didn't get paid, but... I don't know, this is kind of complex actually
Considering the writing prompts are going to be 500
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I do not want them to create *just for* Kiricoins
I want people to be encouraged by Kiricoins
People don't actually have to know our system
internally
I meant
we should probably formalize fancontent rewards
we would know who's hoarding due to the leaderboard if it worked <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
<:thinklink:301637755316994049>
It's non symphogear related and we never discussed that aspect
I was thinking about that
We can also give out 10 generic tokens the day we release tokens
My <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
WFC is used to dealing with bad pulls
I don't disagree with the sentiment but yeah it's still favoritism
ü§î
Are you really rigging the gatcha
Agreed
because there's some *very ignorable shit* there
And I don't know if I want to punish anyone for ignoring like, liveshitposting
maybe just for a moment, but it does
I don't know if I want them always on? You've seen what it does on val's server - it derails conversations 1/3 times
but I'm not the expert <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
Because I'm pretty sure it's a feature Nadeko already has and doesn't need to be written
I thought we were only going to do them on special days
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
Shirabe's sleeping again
As popwobbles showed, merely wanting to get it isn't enough to actually enable someone to give feedback
I don't think it's a huge problem
It's alright
because we have literally floated this suggestion for a month and a half and this is the first objection I've heard
Is this on the subject of prompt feedback
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs
that's a lot of gimmicks
some of them are going to be way better than others and that's probably fine
Like give them similar abilities but different AI patterns
or you're going to have *a lot* of units to design
Honestly, from a design perspective, I feel the cards should be more homogenous than not
Tidying up your business comes at the end
I feel like if it was locked in it would either not be mentioned or come at a far closer date to the actual act
As someone who has been there, I understand but it's still cruel to throw that at people 

Though what they probably mean is "someone, anyone, please care about me"
Whew
Or other Unicode
Though based on how it's stored katakana could eat that up pretty fast
Past that you are being intentionally ridiculous
120 characters seems reasonable
I'll have to see how it looks like after I pull At Least She's Not Serena
Hm
I think I even tested for you I just can't remember
Does Maria reject quotation marks
Oh
Rename has specific formatting
Use rv_help
Haha
Ah
I've been debating whether you should post on the subreddit, tbh
Why not?
Go click the thing
Lily's art wasn't going anywhere
Kind of thought it would have been good to get a third opinion on the matter
I uh
A reasonable argument, does anyone have a counter? Do we want to specifically encourage symphogear stuff?
ok I have no idea what's been going on because I've been at a varying level of consciousness for the past 5 or 6 hours but are we okay with people joking about calling kiricoins cryptocurrency or could it bite us in the ass somehow
I don't want people feeling like they're suffering because they have life things and aren't glued to here
I object
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
She's down in image sourcing too, as of this morning
Speaking of
Who did we lose
Sorry
It's fine to have a temporary measure, I thought we were discussing design
On the other hand, the user has to wait for you to get off work or wake up to get their starting money
I really don't think this is a good idea that accomplishes much besides making you feel good Kriisa

If Maria creates a file for them, you know they're interested
Put stat tracking in your bots then rather than being a human point of failure
Couldn't Maria just ask Kiri to give them 500 coins when she makes a new file for a user
It's valid but *is it what we want*
:U
but someone was very eager to be generous
which is why I wanted to discuss it
We've already handed out coins for non-symphogear fanart
*Is* all user created content equal
It's a non-symphogear thing he writes and churns out random stuff that doesn't really interest anyone on the server and I think some of it was even written for a grade?
also we need to talk about what Jacq just said, like, now
instead of having a bunch of people kinda rich
super rich
so we're just going to make someone like
now that we've done it I'm willing to commit to the riskier path
we'll see how it goes
but that I feel are insufficient to tell everyone that "we changed our mind, sorry suckers"
Arguments that might have swayed me to agree to it, before we told everyone we were going to do it
500 is pretty chunky
I know you would
I'm cutting the feedback thing to 25 unless we get one banger of a discussion
I'm also a little worried if the whole thing is an anxiety trigger waiting to happen for someone but I usually overthink that stuff
we're creating a system where we're codifying people who are doing social participation stuff are going to end up "wealthy" and there will exist a quantifiable measurement and comparison of who is more relevant to the server, in theory

and like, I don't know if that's going to be a problem but the Melua a few hours ago was worried about it
one of my fever thoughts as I was having a nauseating sleep
oh right
so when the shop opens up, nothing is fair
while everyone else hovers around 0
Because it's completely possible - and happening - that people just collect the coins without spending them
It just occurred to me we can't ever use kiricoins to buy custom roles or anything now
She will run a joke for 6 months straight
Rakhi's jokes never die though
I too do not like it
in here there's no one that can misread the joke
I know *I* feel salty when someone takes my money
I actually think having a winner takes the pot thing is... not good for community
because we don't control who winners are
not always in a controllable fashion
and one that just shifts money around
because that is also a partial solution
it's a partial solution
Caps until if/when we enable them for non-gatcha things seems reasonable
the answer to "idea is bad" is not "opposite idea is good" though
I still feel like this is a redistribution of wealth in the opposite way I'd want
weird
dunno maybe it doesn't work with invites
you disable embeds with <>
so I'm hyped
I just finished doing an adult thing I hadn't done before
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
hm
We're never going to keep that metric and it'll make it feel *doubly* shit that no one's responding to their stuff
I
for events we're not even sure what they are and whether we want them
one just has that extra salt in the wound
~~R does have a point in that I think gambling for actual resources feels shitty regardless~~
the salty feelings are there
their money is taken
there are losers who get none of the pot
that doesn't matter
We are the federal reserve <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
I think this particular idea is not great
Mind you this is just an example
No correlation between # of people entering and the prize amount
No pool needed
And then the winner gets awarded
Make events pay to enter
Yeah, I'm pretty clearly out numbered here, I just wanted to put my opinion out there
For actual casino gambling you're paying for the experience, but I don't think we can duplicate the adrenaline feel
I'm of the mind that when someone loses coins they should be gaining something, I'm just philosophically against gambling I guess
yay scrmz isn't dead
perhaps we should take a break and come back to it
I seem to see this conversation going in circles, though I might just be really tired
was off the home row
whoops
Honestly the hardest thing about tipping is letting users know they can do it
Tax is unnecessary
Anyway any positive interest on gift giving just means we have to put a lock on gift giving because otherwise people will just pass the compounding interest back and forth
<:latte:351057804984844298>
I skimmed over the suggestion
Oh
I don't think anyone suggested that
No
<:concerned:288512422912720896>
Anyway, sunshine, is that command open to all users
But I agree with your points
It also moves the economy further away from our ability to regulate wealth
dess_give 5 <@102691114762371072>
There are pros and cons
Where users can tip others kiricoins
Do we want a tip function
<a:kirikabear:493835576659935232>
Cinch
Too soon for event gatcha
User card pages at least
<:beatriceWtf:361624848780361738>
A few people being extremely wealthy is what's going to kill stuff like putting emote slots up for sale
But that's probably me overthinking it
That is good, I was just thinking we might want, say, memorias to have a different rate of bonuses
Ah
Future proofing
If we want
Can you make it a variable that gets checked against the gatcha so different ones can have different bonuses
Hahaha
But once we have like 3 gachas up they should rotate at about that rate
X-drives shouldn't last all that long
I concur since no one minded
Kriisa a rich bitch <a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
And you'll get her next summer
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Do we want to look at implementing the memoria gatcha with the free weekly pull
Idk
I feel that we should consider not racing gatcha by since awakening is difficult
I was hoping there could just be a pumpkin one we left up all october
Is there a spookyween gacha card set
I mean I think people will be okay with pulling again
You said daily daisy chain
Imagine being paid to give gifts
R you know how you were worried paying people for reviews would make some feel less genuine
Oh no I'm never going to be able to afford gatcha if I can give gifts <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
It feels good to give
People will find reasons to give gifts if they know they can do it
Even if it's just once a day
But this can easily be made soulless by any pair of people willing to cheese it
If it's for a good cause I'm ok with currency generation
Having Kriisa in my life already makes me rich <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Have a fan art gatcha but make them all draw elfnein cards
But maybe it'll make it happen sooner <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
If that's what it takes maybe I should save for elfnein <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Uh?
Why didn't Elise pull anyway
Where do I sign up for the beta test realm
Stuff me full of robot pls
No
Still a month and a half away but I'm excited
Denver <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I am way too excited about my plane tickets
Maria won't get mad at me if I have to delete one of her posts with an offensive card will she <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
That's fair
Relying on a single, employed moderator isn't the best strat
<@102691114762371072> We might need an override for offensive names
Ohhh
Especially with funny names
They're occasionally relevant to discussions?
rv my card should be everywhere though
It reminds others to check in
I'm fine with dess timely
I think I still have AM2R on my laptop
Oh
I thought he was just doing static sprites for fun
Is he actually making the fighting game
Nice catch R
I mean it had an fma spoiler but that's not delete worth lol
Your hiero post poofed
Sorry R
I hate phone interface
Oh uh whoops
what's our safe for work policy on card names

rv_mycard Kriisa in Heels
but don't plan around it
if I work I'll almost certianly miss it
oh wait, sunday
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I'll be there for some of it sometimes
0900 or 2100
9 what
Is there any events you can put on? ~~also writing up subreddit posts for writing prompts is something I'm terminally bad at~~
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
the cards don't match
I don't...*think* that's what's going on?
I called some of them with mycard
I don't think so
like rename or something?
hmmm
I was just wondering what was going on
I mean I don't mind it this way
they are not the same
did it once in user lookups and once in cardlookups after my recent pull
it's shifted
because uhhh
each time
<@!102691114762371072> does rv_mycardlist generate the cards in a random order
cute
if she wasn't dead and forgotten
she would be
I mean
do we want to do anything with that
SERENA'S OF DRINKING AGE
WOAH
~~what if the special event for serena's birthday is forgetting to hold one for serena~~
dess_.. timeline
I am going to be the queen of handing out kiricoins with these prompts
oh ok
I swear I saw this months ago
is this a new version
and it gets into their head
I've seen so many artists beat themselves up over stupid stuff like missing a day or falling behind
The most important thing about Inktober is to not feel committed to it
So is our metric for rewarding people for hosting server events going to be "if they can't win, they get a compensation," or is it going to be based on them holding it at all
I guess that's true
anyway Rakhi reminded me that I'm intentionally missing out on the opportunity to get 600 coins a week by *running said event* so I'm just going to drop that here so everyone else can decide what's fair from that
we could get the s3 model but then she'd just throw exceptions saying she can't work because she sucks
she's terrible at everything
I can
but that would cause our economy to be a net negative
According to Kriisa, she doesn't get them, Maria just deletes them
we did test it a few times
though
it'd be divisible by 500
where does the excess come from
if, when we give people money, it's granted from Kiri's account
I want to know where the 6931 was generated from
I'm so excited to be running the writing prompts this week
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Because for some gatchas it will probably be less obvious
Mariabot throwing up sparkle emojis or something
It's not a bad idea
X-drives
rv_userlookup Latooni
yes
and glow
and white
they're fancy
so if you get the X-drive rare bucket, you're on equal odds
because I understand Kriisa's system, the system picks a rarity bucket, and then pulls a random card from that bucket
if you pull an X-drive, you have a 1/9 chance of pulling any girl
I mean
if the planting thing is what's causing dead channels to look like they have activity I'm not loving it <:NononPout:454088299963875349>

\:(

oh no you mentioned her and now I have the gay thoughts‚Ñ¢
oh no
I think you might be able to put something together based on that, I don't know the interest levels though
going "oh, I'll be too gross to touch if I say I'm trans" is uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh a bad look
I saw that yeah
<:redditsilver:289464718744092684>
Even if I like the idea
I also object because it's not transparent for anyone else clicking on it
It's not the best time travel story but it's got the most soul
I love bttf
It's easy to be good here because everyone has such unified feelings on caring for our users

First a splash screen, probably
That way you don't have to get someone to load a thing to look at your stuff
They can just be on generated webpages
Collections and profiles don't have to be in the app and maybe shouldn't be

No, Kerrik got it yesterday
wait
10
I couldn't search it up before and we *don't have this written down anywhere*
that's fair
unless it's been 5 per day?
Uh? The others didn't go through
it's still too early to launch a new one imo

and Maria

mirrors the show
Same
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
I think so
I'd be careful about burning out the meme but you can obviously call it whatever you want
having to explain the name on top of it isn't great
the event's going to be enough of a joke to explain to people as it is
it's a minor meme
I don't think it's really that hard
Serenacon
mm
Alice is probably faster
it's generally 10 minutes to an hour of tinkering
yeah
She'll have to convert it into the game's music language, and possibly split up the tracks, since you're capped at 10k characters per sheet - and the 10k sheets are expensive
<@!127644949884698624>
```The point of the prompt limitations this month is to produce prompts that are more unusual, more cheesy, and a little more off-beat, goofy, and sometimes even "bad." The limitations were presented as "the month of nightmare fics" and we thought it might be fun if we got people writing things that aren't necessarily "good" or technical wonders but were still fun to read and write. Future conditions will be more encouraging of this direction, and perhaps I overestimated cultural awareness of goths (chosen for their proximity to generic spookiness) :KiriWhoops:```
I put a "ban on first offense" personal note on their profile
"BUT WHAT ABOUT MY FEELINGS"
"BUT WHAT ABOUT MY FEELINGS"
response to another user telling them trap is a slur (different server)
it takes speculation out of the market
ahhh interesting
can you put red merets up for auction
yeah, standard operation
I'll probably pick up one
I don't remember how growly the electric guitar is in maple
they're soundfonts rather than instruments
Every instrument can play chords, regardless of how feasible it would be in real life
It's good but I'll keep thinking
Hmm
It must be written with heavy handed product placement
I've got it
Oh my god
Nah gotta kick it up a meta notch
I've got one but it's not the best choice
Still open for stupid meta suggestions for next week
I'm already at 5 entries this week and it's not even friday
I am going to make Solo cry blood this month
you could iterate all possible moves with some extra logic cutting out too much repeats
yeah don't push yourself unreasonably you goofball
no I haven't eaten in like 30 hours

sorry I've missed all this convo, I feel like death
Yeah we'd have to strip all branding off
Which is annoying but not life ending
I think it's fair for you to get a weighted sau
Seriously though, its your program they'll demand a takedown of
I'm fine with the risk but the most important vote here is the one who has the most work to lose
I want to say "same" every time I see that process name
it's just hibimiku with a really weird twist so I thought you'd be into it
if that's so you don't have to read it
haha really
yes
I took care of sparkle
also Alice you're going to want to read today's prompt
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
sparkle probably deserves coins for guilty sister but I've never read any of it
haha
they shut up when I said it was rule 1 of the server
"respect isn't a right"
I got a free speecher on the other server
actually discussing it
people are
can we put a like 30 minute cooldown on the igalima thing
Each character has an archetype right now
But I'm mostly thinking of silence as a boss move
I just think the silence is okay if we tie it to something that only fires off last in a round
Can we add into the ability pile "this unit always moves last/first"
Oh
Like the silence
There's some abilities on the list that might only be used for pve boss units
Counters will be rare, either a passive ability or as part of a defensive ability package
Right now we're just ordering the toolbox
Counter chance sounds good
And then there's a solid chance Bushi won't care
The overlap of someone being fluent enough to figure out how to do it and being bitter and petty enough to execute is small
Mind you I think we're at like a maximum of 20% chance of bushi noticing us, and even then that's if a user tries to rat us out
I remember making the game assemble types of fish with different movement and feeding attributes
I don't know what the structural differences between java and python are but this is where java was most useful when I used it
It screams "time for Kriisa to learn OOP" to me
Which a bunch share
And I think it's less a list of functions needed as it is a list of Lego pieces needed
I mean I stared at it
She's effectively playing a zachtronics game right now
Inventing algorithms
Honestly the part Kriisa is working on is my favorite type of coding
Grid based movement as seen in every strategy game that doesn't allow diagonals
We have, in this system, successfully squared the circle
You only need to hunt around areas that are blocked
Have you tried the reverse
Kriisa I assume you've tried to figure out where a unit can go
What an absolute unit
Absolut vodka
But try searching for taxicab geometry
Kriisa I can't do much at work
Correct
Yeah you lose out if you delete
So yes it does encourage hoarding
You'll just get it added to your collection after you delete it and repull it
Deleting it removes the terms yes
10 tokens means you get one card of your choice from the shop
You get tokens
To show off cards you like
rv_myfavelist
A way around that is a favorites list
And keep pulling it
Right now they get refunds if they *max* a card
Also it's a mixed message
Every gatcha game gives you a reason to delete
No
I don't see why we need inventory limits, though we may want to let people trash cards to clean up their roster
I think we're playing with 4 deployed characters
I'll probably cut the prompt reward down to 500 after the bonus conditions pass
I'm like 3 behind
dess_remind me 6h review all submissions and pay them
I feel like you did too
But the backend is always more fun to code
Java does not have good or pretty UI handling
Ugh
I kind of miss coding now
How are we going to tell the player what buffs and stacks are in play
I think we should treat ties as losses
When is dot damage going to occur in the turn phase
Agent_Smith sets mode +m
bash.org is still hilarious if you can dodge the bigotry
Oh good that still works
dess_.. Outside
dess_.. Latooni
One dot
We can come to a final decision later I just want a working term less boring than generic token
We have appropriated all rainbow technology
Prism is a word owned by the gays
Oh yeah pass on that
If you have a super special material in the story that could work too
Chaos, flux, meta
I mean there are alternatives
A cube is a prism, geometrically speaking
üåà token
Just directly hand out prism?
What do we do for repulling fine etc
Because generic token is a bad end-user name
Which I'm going to propose we call Prism or Prismata tokens
Right now they're hibiki tokens, tsubasa tokens, generic tokens
The tokens do not turn into kiricoins
Same here
Once you get a sufficiently big collection in hearthstone you have enough dust floating around to get you whatever you want
What are you scrambling for
When you hit that point you have all the cards anyway

Movement from all happens before abilities? I was under the impression each unit was resolved one by one

<@127644949884698624> how should unit adjacency bonus be visually represented, or should it be at all
Jacq has a policy of being incompatible with ideas that don't fit their worldview

<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Saki's reply crashed discord on my phone
The default will be wagerless fights
Field buffs are useful for stuff like acid rain or other stuff
Will there ever be field wide buffs not attached to a specific unit
System resilience is usually a positive feature
It allows more control over area attacks and buffs
I like the 2a 2b thing some
Hm
They still get hit, but get to run away
Though that isn't the worst
So we are going to end up with that weird case where the slower units end up getting to pull away from their attackers
For one team?
Something we won't have
Frozen synapse also has AI to attack mid move
Individual queuing solves a lot of headaches but is much less cool
Units get queued together from both sides in the same action queue? Or is it player a picks and executes and then it all passes to b
I don't have the document in front of me and can't double check
Wait, I'm stuck thinking about a singleplayer only design, let me ask something I feel foolish for overlooking
I do see Kriisa's objection, as I don't mind a player getting information about targets, but I think it's not fair that the one who gets to be safest is the slow character
When you're building the foundation you generally want to have it triple checked
This ordering is one of the most important things impacting strategy in the game, I'm sorry for scrutinizing it extra close
And I don't object yet, I'm just trying to take it apart in my head to get a good look at pros and cons
You're doing very well
Yes
It's not trying to retaliate against red
It's going after its target
Why is it a bad outcome for black
It is a bad outcome but at least you got to attack what you wanted to
And you're still going to run into a problem if they both have unit targets
Though it's not a problem if they don't end up adjacent if the attack goes off after a unit's move rather than at the end of all of them
Right, I see the objection
Gladly <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Then I don't see why the tile units should have priority
What does a unit do if it cannot get to its ground tile target
This way is harder to plan around and abuse which is both a good thing and not
but it may not feel intuitive from the user POV
they still get the same number of turns
it effectively will last one turn shorter than anyone who you hit with it that has moved
and futhermore, when you hit a buff on any unit who hasn't moved yet
that'll take effect *that turn*
if someone hits someone who hasn't moved with a speed buff or debuff
Under this system
Okay so
just a clarification
This isn't an objection
So one eternally has initiative over the other?
should a speed 6 100% of the time go before speed 5
do we want to slightly jumble speed as we shuffle everyone into a queue to resolve ties or give slight rng
and hexagon coordinate math
now I want to look up hexagon math
it wasn't a serious proposition
you know I love hexagons in pen and paper maps but just realized how much more work it'd be to code them
huh
Hexagons <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
They're drawn simultaneously but are processed in 2 queues
It affects the balance especially of the "can't attack, nothing in range" action
I understand your design a little more now
You were planning to draw all movement simultaneously?
Rebuilding it is not simple
There's a reason you measure the foundation 3 times
I respect her time enough to wince at this suggestion
Yeah that's unreasonable to test both I feel
I think Kriisa is right in that the kiting thing is being oversold
Which is more exciting to me
Personally I just like resolve each unit approach because it means less whiffed attacks
~~your favorite meme, now featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry‚Ñ¢ series~~
<@!102691114762371072>
I'll include that in my writeup tomorrow
but we might want to look at a policy at normally delaying them when casting them on others
I think we should want buffs to be able to apply immediately, for self-buff use
but that belief isn't enough to deny the appealing way you worded that ü§î
I think you should be able to throw *some* wrenches into a turn
Chris is less mobile while using Billion Maiden etc
though it's a fine thing to be self-inflicted
movement debuffs are something we need to be very careful with because whiffing on a planned action isn't a fun experience
I'm okay with movement buffs because they can add strategy etc
they should be able to do that regardless of whether there are movement buffs in the game
the idea is that the AI follows its target
yes
I'll give it a shot though
I know a certain someone who can be distracting in the morning
oh that might not be the best timing
dess_remind me 14h Write down the possible options for handling buffs and then list out their pros and cons
but what is it
I have a lot mentally on my plate
uhhhhhhh
making this even more complex
for self-buffs I don't think anyone disagrees that it needs to have an instant effect?
this is only for units that buff and debuff others
Mind you
it fixes the problem of a buffer's worth being highly impacted by their own speed
so its a question of which problem is less bad
I do agree that it's a problem if buffs take a turn to apply universally, as that isn't intuitive either
I think it's possible to do that without being OP, but it's a tightrope
this is going back to the point I made where design resilience is preferrable to having to hand balance around a flaw
"you can take a hit... next turn"
Having bad units isn't a bad thing, but having units that can't do their own job is not great
like why 3 mana cards are more than twice as good as 6 mana cards in hearthstone
it's a response time flexibility thing
they'll just be unplayable crap unless their buff is crazy
so if all the other buffs take effect immediately, then the 'meta' is going to trash any buff unit that comes with a low speed
compared to next turn
a unit that grants *any* buff is vastly more useful if you can apply the buff right now
Kriisa's highlighted a bigger hole though
low-speed buffing units would be shit
if buffing was affected by speed
on the other hand
I don't object to that design though it makes buffers less flexible
yeah
then it shifts where it is
The tricky part is if a unit that has yet to move gets hit with a speedbuff
I'm not going to let you ask her to hardcode all these <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I feel like I'd be willing to take a scythe and cut large parts of these out if Kriisa doesn't magic up a sufficiently modular way
this list is much more intimidating than when I last saw
I agree that they're cool but not vital
I think we should put a note on speed buffs letting Kriisa know it's totally cool to veto them if she gets there and finds them too annoying to work with
I guess that means a unit will have to have an active/inactive tag that lets the game skip over it in the queue but that's probably for the best
I guess?
as otherwise you can just build a list of units and the order they move at game start and tweak it once in a while
The only really major objection to speed buffs is it makes implementation slightly messier
I mean Alice is meant to be used but not by us
I liked the lego mindstorms visual language
as long as we have documentation on the syntax, that's fine
but also really useful
because it seemed *possible* but difficult
That's exactly what I was hoping you could do
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
a language thing
yeah!
I have some ideas on how to facilitate this but I don't know how feasible it'll be without knowing what kind of architecture Kriisa ends up using for the modularity
The build-an-ability thing should be doable for most of them, maybe, though Kriisa's made of hot stuff if she pulls it off
nevermind that
invent language that translates to assembling an ability...? Ugh that's ambitious
That's, what, about the most we've ever had? slightly under?
We're up to 7 prompts though
some of this stuff has been fantastic
I might keep the 2-4
I mostly needed something that started with D
it was close enough
I guess would be one way to put it
Boldly formatted paragraphs

Disingenuous application of prompt subject

rakhi's submission...
Ask me no questions and I will tell no lies
someone discovered the exact tone I wanted
at last
`Most of Hibiki‚Äôs clothes were all black or other similarly dark colors of her soul, so she couldn‚Äôt
compromise with anything brighter. `
Maybe
typing speed, connection quality, not being on mobile, and being more present
you've seen how that turns out in val's server, it's not an equal distribution
because you're planting them for people to pick
and some are probably going to get a lot
the average user is probably going to get very few
because that way the secret is *less obvious*
like, you could hand out coins to anyone who has to know the secret but not join
I mean
Also, honestly, if all the mods are Maria, it'll give it away
I'm staying as is, ~~serena isn't important enough to talk about~~
<:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
you don't pick cape because you like maria, you pick cape because black gungnir is the coolest looking gear to date
I feel like it's cheating
hmmmmm
someone pointed out the years on the left are bullshit
we should make a new one
I am excited to hear how Kriisa's day goes
I wanna see that second one
Your first license

what happened

You haven't said as much but I guessed
mm
glad I did too, that was a good day, all in all
I mean I took a train for a one day celebration with Kriisa
not a huge deal
you can do it year round in socal
if you really want to skate
Like
Kriisa was willing to visit jacq
yeah I don't think they got it that uh

it's dedication
browse their channel saki
the greatest youtube channel
oh yes

MH's moving from niche to mainstream
we'll see
blow air in the opposite direction
replace your hammer with a fan
anything
living in retail I forget that weekends mean
dmv closed
that would be hilarious
The best outcome of this is the channel is filled with "What's your favorite thing about serena" and then 20 planted kiricoins but the channel is otherwise dead
I kind of actually think staff should refrain from posting there for a while, actually
unless maria users are inactive at the time
I'm assuming that everyone's going to figure out how to get into the room within about 1.5 hours
lemme reload
but you were clever and anticipated it
they're just both too slow (imo)
I do think the vertical being slower than the horizontal is good
though the full screen solves that
I have to use my browser scrollbar to see everything
bigger issue
and both speeds felt like... a little slower than what I wanted it to do?
but I tried it out (smooth as butter, btw, excellent work)
I think the concept is good
even town driving's going to slowly eat at the lifespan of stuff without coolant
this would have prevented the trip
yeah it was after
leaky coolant
her car needs a little work
mhm
gonna be a bit tight but I can help a bit with next month too if needed
good
ALSO I'M HIGH ON FRIENDSHIP
oh kriisa when do you start
but when you do that you add the veggies much later
actually I've made some good soups that way
chicken and veggies
gonna be goo
I've got a slow cooker going
but fair enough
late jan or early feb
compared to like
is november the best time to do that
ouh
at some point yeah
which is a solid 10% chance
if I ever manage to actually solidify the rest of that plan
I have plans for her
though
rip Aegis
but it's a star-filled sub <:ChrisAngerDess:496162035856441354>
it's an okay dub
you watch FMA:B dubbed, which I mean
but no Kriisa
two mistakes in the same joke means I have to agree that you haven't peaked
not a very pure sub
so the joke missed
technically I'm a switch

I've seen her in the botw server
oh
also 8 prompts this week!!
I still feel a little smug over that
No, I just said that "I was just trolling" is not a substitute for "Sorry"
does that count
I told bread off in public and he ran away like a bitch
I think the only person we've told to stand down is WFC and that's for other reasons
The only judgement being "you didn't do enough"
Perhaps
kinky
it'll help if you have other terms to fill in the gap
It will probably be a slow process yes

I'm so happy for you!!!
If I were there there's about a 40% chance you'd be knocked to the ground by my hug

it kind of explains why it's shitty if you ask that question
One thing you might want to ask them is why are they called traps
<@!127644949884698624>
oof that's heavy for my sleepy ass right now
Lucifer does not want kiricoin rewards in exchange for their art and we should probably ask other artists if they want them before awarding them in the future
You are what you eat

I forgot it's a bank holiday because nobody else gets it off
happy dead natives day
yeah it is
rip shirabe
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
we can't make roles that are invisible to most users, right
my only reservation is uh
the people who don't want kiricoins are going to feel strongly enough about it
that has more potential
opt-in is, on some manner, a choice of greed
I think an opt-out system is more in line with how we want to use kiricoins than an opt-in system
stuff like yugioh and shit
or we could even make a kiricommand or something to have a list that any of us can check or edit
we make it procedure to always check it
they get added after the first time they mention it
Or we could have a master list in this channel of who doesn't want them
luci keeps using timely, yes
<a:badelaugh:428703436566036481>
that sounds fair
this is not intended as a normal prompt that you can do something extra if you feel like it
I am currently asking for a damn prompt with the extra condition and if you choose to *not participate in the event*, I am willing to take it in essentially out of pity
because that psychologically changes *what I'm asking for*
I am *not*
I am not
I really am not inclined to word it as a bonus
but I'll probably end up at 100
I'm thinking the non-extra condition pieces should get zero, honestly
I am grumpy
the event is the extra condition and if you're such a closeted writer that you can't flex something different then I don't feel like you should be rewarded
it is a penalty
I do not care if it feels like a penalty
I won't make an anti-abuse policy until it gets abused
we'll see though
well, Rakhi
I'm mostly concerned about
Serena and Maria for her birthday
ü§î
This is good
She has black sclera and a pink chainsaw
Record it and put it to music
Yumbo
Jumbo is larger than mega jumbo
for essentially the points that were laid out in the channel
The conclusion was that this was the least ridiculous option that wasn't really that bad
feels anime robot
it just
boot, arm, shoulder

Very little sunshine
you look like a robot with the proportions
you're a robot
she's currently workriisa
Kriisa, would that be possible?
that makes sense
they get an RV role added to them
you're saying that when someone has an account
OH
Not that I want to impose on her but if it's useful it'd be nice
and I can't imagine it'd be very taxing on her
that'd be useful
and yeah if Kriisa could give us a boolean command on whether a user has an account or not
oh is it
if it was easier to add/remove I'd suggest popping that one up only when we're about to throw down an event
mafia and stuff
and it's cool
Fiat currency whose value is exclusively tied to the kiricoin
What is the conversion rate of kiricoins to the more valuable bikkibuck
We'll make exceptions for special server watches like the bikki birthday thing but otherwise eh
I agree
Definitely changed my life
<@127644949884698624>
taken out of context this horrifies me
mmm, I'm fine with a low payout after the event as long as people show up
I think these are the key points we need to ask when deciding these things
Is there appreciable organizational effort that went into it?
Is it a server event? Does it build community?
I really don't know, especially with her asking someone to drag bread into it
I don't know, honestly
No wonder XDU does memoria, its a good way to dilute
I don't want to go ham on special cards yet
Maybe include the phantom thief stuff for both of them because I think they had a story together?
Can we look at starting to celebrate these things by Japan time? Between XDU and fanart, it really feels like the celebration is the day before
Having a home, even just an online one, helps a lot
<:yayakaSmile:284164860428812289>
(Not really going to count bread)
6-1 person turnout isn't bad
Struggling to find a timeslot and getting every one to be there isn't free work
I think we had a three person consensus that it was fair
Harp
And the standard piano and timpani
I have an unopened instrument box
And I can buy bass guitar if that's what you mean
I can get a harp easy
such great friends
I don't deserve to be this lucky

"I was wrong about Trump" - Caitlyn Jenner

No
I once had a customer give me shit for not physically handing him his card back but instead putting it down on the counter

yep

terfs hate us because they have a persecution complex set up that's based around being the biggest victim

my last day off and my boss wants me to come work
I may or may not have spent the last half hour debating with myself if I was going too far with my point <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
it wouldn't have been my space
I would have left
I don't think I'd have stayed here, when I identified as a cis male, if the admins did that
I don't...
like
but you're not a user, you're a top-level admin, and it's a *very strong* message of "if you don't enjoy this, you don't belong here" when someone in that position goes off about something
regarding filling <#384870333620027403> with trans shitposting
if a user wants to flavor the server in that direction it's fine
<@!102691114762371072> I'd like to actually suggest that you not do that

Besides me after Kriisa kisses me
What is a melty girl
I feel so old
there's times I have to hesitate before pressing my razor against my face
I'll think about the subject and try to be available
Not that shadowbanning works on discord anyway
Ok. Fair.
<a:MariaBlush:493803272360951808>
What I did today I did without my mod hat
You might be overstating my abilities there
Other than that just schedule something and maybe I'll be available <:concerned:288512422912720896>
Monday or Tuesday, kind of, with restrictions
Retail has no weekend
Usually not really <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
Whether we can, should, and how
We probably should have a conversation someday about removing people from the server who don't overtly break the rules but are a toxic presence
Pretty sure Kriisa wasn't serious though, just frustrated
Unless Kriisa means ban without telling anyone which I disagree but less harshly
I agree with Kriisa's frustration though
It's not and never will be a punishment while I'm here because it's abusive without being corrective
For the record we're not shadowbanning
Anyway you don't deserve flak and you're wonderful and you can outlast your bitchy shift manager üíö

My mom's heavily into geneology and has been working various branches for like 18 years now
meaning I am in fact a princess <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
so last night I learned I have direct descent from King James IV of Scotland
have fun
nice
thank you!
I stopped it
ü§¢
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
but yeah I have nothing else to do except throw myself into retail and suffer
and yes it is except ~~it's not fine~~
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I can't imagine coming home from an 8 hour shift and playing a shooter for 2 hours
or the shower
alice probably fell asleep which is fine
"yeah this mod was cool but we played it to death so we're not doing it with Melua"
I'm just not happy to see it thrown in front of me
like it's legit and fine
~~also I'm glad my minecraft experience gets to be dictated by what other people have played to death because it was quality content and then decide to not use~~
it's objectively better than it used to be
so
yeah but simon doesn't do minecraft anymore
I still watch yogscast
I know possibly more about modern tinker's than you do at this point
yeah no
empty, half full, and full
I thought it was three frames
I'm still stunned to see the crafting bar animate
#4 Alice, for similar reasons
#3 Kriisa, for convincing me I actually deserve it
#2 - Kriisa, for helping me pick it
Credit for this goes to #1 - my wallet, for buying it
but you're not showing me anything
ü§î
yeah
I never knew
all these months
R did you know maplestory is a pretty and fun game
I could, it's creepy and I've been watching it closely to see if he turns openly creep
I never knew
I can't believe maplestory 2 was a fun game this whole time
there wasn't bloom on yours!
there's even bloom!
also I never saw Melua on your screen so it could have been a different game <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
from a distance
it's not actually just 3 frames
progress bars are actually animated
wow
through that absolute mess
wow apparently I was actually undergoing torture and everyone should be amazed and praise me for actually playing with you all
WOW
I THOUGHT IT WAS JERKY BECAUSE SERVER UPDATE STUFF
AIR MOUNTS MOVE SMOOTHLY?
WAIT
what is this
*lighting effects*
maple has
oh my lord
later realized it was because it was defaulting west server to the top slot
maple was giving me a empty roster of characters on my new pc

I am struggling to get windowed fullscreen to work
so diablo, maple, or something else is on tonight's menu

Introduced as my mom's son ughgh
I am not at this dinner as Melua
I am very uncomfortable
what a shame, I woke up thirsty
so I wouldn't worry about it
I'm unsure about the long-term potential of diablo as a group activity
wao
and you all missed it <:smugeline:424643613310451712>
I was all sparkle-eyed and a voice full of wonder
you all missed out
and yeah
running badly at low quality settings
I'm in a very much zoning out mood
it's probably for the best
welcome back
hi alice
you work tomorrow?
wait
I could probably imagine a campaign or something with lots of lulls
at least a high intensity one

Your frustration and anxieties are understandable and worth talking about even if you misunderstood our situations  but I want to say I think you can escape and make it on your own
We'll find a way out Kriisa
Not surely
Did you do the thing? Can you do the work? The only two questions that really matter
The worthless expensive piece of paper is less a notation of your intelligence and more one of perseverance and doing what you have to
The next is that employers care less about you retaking classes than you think

No

and I think Rakhi was exhibiting the laser focus thing you see out of people on the spectrum sometimes
The discussion was about UK
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
It's just social tonedeafness and bad etiquette
I can't imagine any rules he broke
The entire voice chat going silent wasn't enough of a clue for him
difficult if sweaty mctryhard comes in and starts barking orders and commands
figure out if fun was there
*attempt* to have fun, even
I was fairly miserable yes
I can't count on being rewarded for skill <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
I'm counting on spending time with everyone being the source of fulfillment
without friends
it really feels like the kind of game I'll play when asked but it'll make me melt in anxiety on my own
just have to steel myself for the backlash of causing game losses
I might do it today while at work

I don't recommend opening that lid
Only an applicable argument if you enjoy your life
Amateur philosophy hour in serious right now
Wonder what he'll do when he discovers 2/3 of the mod team are trans
I don't think he'll last long
You'd be the most likely to know what was tacky and what wasn't
That was why I asked you tbh
He back
ugh ew
so maybe just say "in UK"
okay yeah saying "in england" would be extra offensive
that should be so offensive it shuts him up
next time he says stuff like that ask him what it's like being an american republican living in england
being selfish, I guess?
I'm confused what it's a dogwhistle of
They might really be stuck with some stupid idea that like "oh, right, trans girl, that means girl that was boy" and then that association becomes *stuck*
and it really might be stupid cis thinking that's to blame
I've been thinking about it
Hmmm
I say we should quarantine all XV discussion until a full month after the last ep
We'll actually need a spoiler channel in a few months anyway
Though
And then after a few hours it gets wiped clean
Have a specific anti-spoiler zone channel where it has special rules that newer users can come in and discuss stuff while specifying where they are in the show
We could do something weird
none of us are skilled enough, financially secure enough, or masochistic enough to jump into that
I thought R had some other team
oh I wasn't aware this was an us team
it's the kind of thing people will hit you with liabilities with if something goes wrong
I don't know the capabilities of R's team but I'll agree that a social media platform is kind of a scary thing to jump into
it seems good
it's a different one now than when she first asked

Take as much time as you need
Rakhi's up to talking about or posting their picture like I think 7 times in the last 36 hours?
freddie kruger

<a:badelaugh:428703436566036481>
No one else will
If Rakhi calls you on it be willing to adjust
400 is reasonable
That was my phrasing but the intention was that 500 was base level, 600 was because it had an extra restriction, and if you refused to do the extra thing you got a pity payout of 200
I got told off for that once
also you can post in both but I'd ping in only one
it's usually 500 I'm not sure what you were looking at
You get *maybe* 3 scenes if you're super frugal
while preventing novels
it seemed the most flexible to let people do fun stuff

Sure, but your "why" was compelling to me
I was going to say that I think that a ping today to wish everyone well and to hand out coins would be okay but I understand Kriisa's point of view and will pull back to a more neutral stance on this
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>

How many kiricoins should we give out for xmas

should we have a policy to delete welcome bot messages of people who leave immediately
Should we have a post where you can react and get X kiricoins for christmas

I am a little very not okay with any depression venting I have done at some point in the last two months being thrown out here because you two are having a spat while I am at work and have no input
I'm serious can we take a 45 minute recess
Can we wait for like 45 min or an hour
Uh this sounds really big and I'd like to actually be part of this conversation
oh wait we have one
we need a server icon if nothing else for chris

shaft brand delay dust
Ironically I think you'll have to earn R's place back on the staff more than vice-versa
I absolutely second R's reinvite then
alright then
I'm in PMs with him and I can say that atm he will absolutely not help this be resolved if he's here right now
he'll refuse
he's pretty livid right now
I'd wait on R's reinvite
I don't think anything here is unfixable, if everyone wants to fix things
Everyone's having stressors in their life right now, and I'm really glad you're taking a critical look at this Alice
I'm just going to put this on the table and say you've fucked up. There's a level of trust you need to show your friends and you haven't been showing her that level. It's one thing to think someone has weak spots and to be ready to compensate for them; it's a complete other level to talk with someone who hates them to try to get dirt on them. Like, it's really not cool, and if I wasn't really invested in keeping Kriisa here because I think *we, as a team,* do an amazing job of establishing a safe and warm space for fans I would not really fight her on slamming the door on the way out, because it's really not okay to be working on an angle of *searching for problems* from your friends.
Okay
Alice, is Kriisa your friend, in your consideration?
Can I ask a foundation question here
I'm kind of caught up.
Okay.
I haven't had a chance to read up *because I am at work*
Can you just formally promise?
it's... very good for you to promise to not do it here
It does bear repeating, since you did rip Kiri out destructively on Val's server
Let's avoid it if possible
Schisms suck
What you just wrote seems to contradict that
You once said that you owning the server was a function out of discord necessity, not out of power level distinction
I uh
I think that's fair
Alice suggested she wanted to move that direction ages ago, I thought it was good then and I think it's good now
*speaking of which* I'd like to formally request a promotion to Custodian so I can be a counterbalance to *things like today* should they be more directly related to the discord server
I think there's a difference between "isn't friends" and "actively doesn't like/can't get along with/has friction"
you're the only real point of contact Xam has with the circle
I would not include Xam in the friend circle idea
that said yes Kriisa you do tend to want to dictate the flow of activities which is... okay? Just double check that everyone's having a good time
This one is really nuanced and Alice please don't push too hard - her never doing what she wants to do is just as bad as doing it too much. But, like, Alice, one big thing about Kriisa I've picked up ~~and fallen in love with~~ is that if she's being blind about something, usually it's... just because you haven't talked with her about it. I know you're not big on confrontation but Kriisa needs it and responds to it in a positive fashion if your confrontation is done with positive energy
I just want to jump in this one real quick
Anyway, Kriisa, I think you get the outline of what Alice is saying
Yeah Alice you weren't the only one who put the brakes on her
Yeah, I don't intend to rehash the argument
Yet you get really upset with people when they're outside your compass, like R and the ends-justify-the-means stuff for his tests
the car example probably isn't the only time you'll think a theft is justified
But it includes some kind of non-standard things that other people would balk at
Kriisa, you'll agree that your internal compass can be pretty rigid at times, right?
Okay I think I kind of get it?
I'm trying to think through on this
I think you ran through that one a little fast
but make no attempt to fix them or reboot them
If Kriisa had left yesterday, I would trust her to leave the bots up
Yeah, I was thinking more about abusive behavior from the userbase at large or something
If someone has shown a half year of goodwill and effort to the server - not to the other staff members, but to the *server* - and leaves, I think maybe that they're dependable to still have goodwill to the server... barring certain leave reasons
I agree with what you say Alice and I think that is clearly written
I am here
I'm blaming Saki for summoning this problem by bringing it up
I'll deal with it if they PM me or ask publically
Agreed with all points
I'm pretty sure that Kriisa's bots are pretty much her daughters and that implicitly killing them and replacing them with someone else's kids is something she's not going to take to well
I don't think this is pride, since I think you might be thinking that, Alice
I know we're stressed, strained, and not happy with each other - yes, I'm aware I'm understating - but can we not do ultimatums? Our personal conflicts affect the users, and I want to give this conflict the best chance to be resolved positively, and ultimatums don't increase those odds.
Take care of yourself.
Okay.
Then can you trust in the staff you've picked to do their job and help you make the decision to keep the bots
Okay. You have a really high bar to trust. I think I understand with that example
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Can you trust that Kriisa believes in the good of this place more than she'd want to spite one of us specifically? I can't imagine her wanting to hurt the users at large here
how about this, Alice
which... I mean, reasonable
I think the most harm you'll ever get out of her at this point with this promise is just aggressive non-support for maintaining them and updating them
and I hope you know me well enough to know that while I'm in love with her, I'm not blindly biased
I trust her to not pull the bots or do anything destructive with them now that she's promised, for the record
Kriisa's made some bad decisions, but I've never, not once, seen her break a promise
it kind of goes both ways but can I ask how she's betrayed your trust in recent times
uh
we should probably credit her somewhere as is
Actually
you *better* put full credit to her on like, the rules page or something
If for some reason you do end up hosting copies of her bots
smartass
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
*Extremely,* like, "this is going to explode in 72 hours or less with this approach"
I am in the process of getting ready for work but let me drop input real quick: Refusing to be accomodating is not being a dick. The line about mistakes is confrontational and on the road to taking it too far, and I suggest Kriisa not talk as if she knows exactly what's going through Alice's head and write a narrative? But at the same time I'm *extremely* concerned that we moved to administrative action so quickly over this.
I don't think refusing to redo colors is being a *dick*, just being not helpful, and more than that, I thought our course of action against moderators involved, like... review and input from other moderators? Like this is the reason we kept appointing more people to the role of custodian so there'd always be at least one neutral party?
Woah hold on
I'm a little puzzled why it's a big deal, it's... color?
Did working out this stuff help at all? Things are going to be okay if we work towards making them okay.
~~I'd fuck Kriisa~~
I think you're getting at that there should be a backup in case something does happen one day, which... I don't disagree with? But I also think it's not an emergency - even if she does leave, they'll be up for a while, and she's not going to leave us out in the dark.
By giving and taking away
Guess you never punished them
<:yayakaSmile:284164860428812289>
I know that screws with PMs
Maybe your home computer is pointed at this server in the active window?
There's a setting somewhere in the desktop app that silences phone pings unless you've been away for X minutes
Phone pings or desktop
I do agree that a separate space and breathing room is probably a good idea right now
I can't say what Valk is like because I've never been there, but it sounds more like the way they'd run things
Rule 1 goes both ways, please don't escalate with threats of demodding, especially when it's the kind of threat that makes every single moderator on your staff take pause and be concerned about due process here
I'm late for work, please refrain from trying to choke each other while I'm gone
I think at this point there might be rumors on the server and... well, it might help
I think it might be wise to move to illuminati
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
The server owner thing seems fine, I think either the flat structure or having Lyssa be at the top, for now, might be fine
Lily, Luci, and Kerrik are probably the people I'd see the best working out
I'd suggest Lily but I'm like 80% she'd turn it down, she seems busy
I don't know of Skeyb
I can wait for a day or two
that's fine
I will definitely be finishing this one up - I have no idea when it's supposed to end, actually, I'll ask R - and then I'll take a small break but I will probably host them from time to time, maybe even regularly? I'm not sure right now
...I'd like to step down. For now, at least. This has been... a lot, and my personal situation at home is getting worse and I need to find a new job to support my mother, and more than that, I kind of just need a break. Right now it's not going to be fun and I'd have to treat it as a job, and that's not going to be fair to the server or myself. If you all want to re-ask me to join in a month or two, I'll  listen, but right now I'd just... like to step down. This place is important to me and I want it to succeed, but I can't bring my A game right now.
Sorry I fell asleep, but uh, I have something else I want to say
Yeah that is a possible concern
and they left, and I made sure they wouldn't accidentally come back
and the whole server at that point was "mate you don't want to be here"
and finished with this
https://i.imgur.com/Vmy188G.png
so they go in saying they're "very much "AGAINST" [yuri]"
lemme go find the post
that's a more useful tool, honestly
wasn't aware
*oh*
they outright confessed they hated the whole LGBT spectrum and didn't tolerate any of them
yeah, they left and I banned them after leaving
just that those are some *targetted remarks* from a new discord account
mowee's a smurf probably of the person who left and I banned, but I have no proof
ah, hm, good point
oh, the part I was saying would be effort was locking the command to only work in serious
this command shouldn't ever be used outside of serious
From my cursory knowledge of kirichan I don't think Kriisa could do this without shifting from "truly minimal work to set up" to "kind of a pain", but you can easily make it just a policy thing
they come in from a translation standpoint and use context people aren't really working with normally
I suggest *not* using andrearitsu's blog post though
It'd be super simple and I think she'd be okay with it
and R should be credited in the sidebar of the subreddit proper
so maybe there
<#336297587802112011> does have -and-information there
yeah, he just wants you to start looking for an opportunity to do that
oh, the reddit banners
and I think there's more?
the banners on the rules page
R says yes, he'd like credit, and he'd like you to work on replacing them soonish because he'd rather them not be there but is willing to let you have time to phase them out
I'll ask him later
Also I know he's gone but if R developed any graphics or related that is in use by the server, it would be right to give him a credit too
She is genuinely invested in the server or she would have left when she dropped role
If they're in use it seems right to credit her, updates or not
If you don't feel comfortable giving her credit for her work the bots should go away
Giving her credit shouldn't be related to that
That she's willing to adapt them to our needs for small tasks
Just ask her, unconnected to the credit, and I'm sure she'll say yes
if you think it might be needed in the future that's different
I do think that Alice implementing that rule when it was being discussed would have been a very bad idea
I have no objections
Alright
Mm, that should be fine
neato
ah
I can see it
Okay. I would like to step down by then, announcement or not.
except I did it in the other order, but whatever
Deleted this in hiero and asked them not to do suicide joke memes, they agreed
I am willing to stand in as a temporary janitor/watchwoman until sunday to assist with coverage
I'm not going to tell anyone "you have to nod and say yes that "including rape scenes is valid art" is an equable opinion"
yeah
the rules are different when someone in that pile has authority
but
and if someone has an idea that's really poorly defended and that other people don't like, oh well, the job of the moderator is just to make sure it doesn't go into harassment
the discussion belonged there
I don't know, maybe you want to make a policy that moderators, as part of the fact they have power and serve the community, need to take a half step back in arguments and refrain from using rhetoric or strongly worded language? For the record, I'm not really concern that solo felt ganged up on in serious discussion, or that he was led there under false pretenses
Yeah, fair
they were, in fact, under a legitimate threat
I'm not really sure if that's a defense, but
Rukia's lines were arguably moderator actionable
this isn't really the issue and I'm just whistling in the dark while I think about it
but
I've suspected sparkle as having some rather conservative viewpoints on LGBT issues and I think that's part of why she was more disturbed by Kriisa's resposne than Rukia saying anything
I don't remember the incident that strongly
Dogwhistles are going to get called out
I rolled my eyes at Sparkle's last message
er, well, their suggestions
tentative towards sparkle because her suggestions are usually a hair subversive
I'm
yeah, what is it?
sunday?
when does that end
The answer is still probably yes, but I'll think about it while at work
I'll think about it
Oh, sorry
a distraction
don't know if you want to use them, them being Pewdiepie related is


mowee's trying to start something
Alright, reasonable
you alright?
Can we have the Serena role added to the self-assign please?
I think the reasoning is solid, and while I do think Kriisa and I can talk any issues out, I wouldn't mind having an adjudicator just for peace of mind. Can we do this today or tomorrow?
I informally warned bloop in xdu and there was no response made, so I'm just recording this here
\o/
üëÄ at zbd unsubbing from writing prompts
I mean yeah, I also don't object to a piecemeal play-by-email kind of discussion
Kriisa suggested a separate gatcha gaming channel due to high use of <#337805317276565525> by dragon, cast, and a few others for gfl and fgo and other stuff that has niche appeal, do we want to discuss the merits of that?
Thank you
I'd like to be custodian please, I never want to be unable to moderate another argument or thought of as lesser

If this arrangement is temporary there should be no problem in acquiescing for this temporary time
it's plausible enough I'm not going to witch hunt
soul saber's been around for almost a week earlier
yep
PM the first one and explain why it was bad, PM the second one and say "hey that wasn't cool why should you *not* be banned for @ everyone and threatening a user"
weird name person is pretty obviously new to discord
the second everyone was malicious though
just of courtesy
it's not a violation of rules
Probably not
should we take action against the person who everyone'd
there was an @ everyone as well
anyway
I'm an idiot
oh, oops
If it was just the @here I would say it's over but
It's not over
it's at the end
oh I'm dumb
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/bednig/rewatch_senki_zesshou_symphogear_rewatch_schedule/

do we want to append this to it
everything is ready to go
Looks good to me
it seemed to be a popular move
sorry
I didn't mean to wake you
<@285555416056856576> <@!102691114762371072> Can we get a unanimous agreement to make a #gatcha or #mobile channel today? GFL/other chatter is pretty common even when there isn't a major update, but it constantly interrupts other discussions when there is
do with the non desscussion channels as you please
okay got the good puns
there's a few I have to do first
hold on
sounds good
My twitter feed's been full of Kirika for like 5 hours yeah
I mean it's not, it just misses having impact
and tomorrow is too late, honestly
The album cover I think
Thank you. It means a lot.
I'm ready for a break
I've had, with some napkin math, some 200+ hours of sitting through your relationship in the same room
that's the only distinction
that's it, sis
I wish you luck, I just don't want my face rubbed in it
You should know me well enough to know that my desire for your happiness is always genuine
I'm glad you're together at last
Have fun
A point.
I am still for giving her an advisory role officially
You are being arrogant, but perhaps not presumptuous. Consider me asking for a favor now, then.
I was directly asking you, another user, for a favor. My good mood isn't so much tied to you being gone - it's being free of the chains of having the awful garbage of having your relationship shoved in my face non-stop. It's wonderful, not having to think about it. To have time to breathe and heal. If you're really having such an exceptional good mood, it'll be equally as good if you don't brag about it.  It's the same decision you've always faced. Is your own pleasure - and sharing how great it is is a decision to enhance your pleasure, not educate people - more important than respecting a friend, or preserving a friendship? I'm glad you're safe. I'm glad you're happy. I'm glad it's everything you want. Please leave it out of where it is my job to read every single line posted. I've got the lulu bus muted if it's really that important to brag about how great things are.
I'm not horribly opposed to nitro boost having a color
If it's a problem we can add another color me role of the same color
and even that I'm not sure of
I don't feel I did either, no, except possibly phrase things badly off-server in private voice comms
I'm sorry to have made things more complex
I hope the Not Fun passes
dess_warnlog <@96735309600935936>
Oh ok
Idk
dess_warnlog @Nagatocchi#1738
Go do that
in japan
it's tsubasa's birthday in an hour
I'll talk more about it later
It's not different to fanfic writers
it's one 11 year old making out with another, somewhat unwilling 11 year old, with full tongue action
I'll link you the original video later if you really want context but it's incredibly uncomfortable
not good
*uhhh*
the hieroglyphs meme is uhhhhh
ugh, going to have to keep an eye on ikxi from now on
O
I feel like it's a bad idea as a gut feeling though
I don't know, if it routinely gets bad maybe
It's really really important to some people to have underage titty the way the devs intended it I guess
It'll probably be fine without zerona
makes sense
ah
Have you been in contact with them? I'm unaware of other issues with them
"they won't let me say a derivative of nigger, I'm out"

informing them it was deleted and "asking" them not to do it again
I've sent a PM
I personally think everyone deserves chances
So R's very probably back on the server as <@495797356248432641> and I'm being prodded to ask if we should discuss doing anything about it - I'm against being proactive here
(planning out announcement post)
Hey everyone! XV's just around the corner, and the hype-building community rewatch to go through all 4 seasons of Symphogear starts **tomorrow**!! The plan is one episode a day, with discussion threads going up on reddit at 6pm EST!  Feel free to watch privately at your convenience, but if you're interested in joining the server collective rewatch (hosted and administered by <@!127644949884698624> ), that'll start at 9pm EST! Discussion will happen in <#576238192555065374> (with a spoiler policy of nothing beyond the most recently viewed episode!)

Want an alert of when the server viewing's about to air? Make sure you're signed up to the Rewatch role! Type `dess_iam Rewatch` in <#448237561085952001> 

On a technical note, if you're going to be joining the live server rewatch on cytube, you'll want to install tampermonkey from https://tampermonkey.net/ and then cytube's google drive userscript from https://cytu.be/google_drive_userscript.
for Lyssa's info - <#336297808221044736> had Rukia be a trashfire and they've been kicked twice in the past
??
Hello all! I'd just like to touch on a little point related to rule 1 really briefly! "Don't be a dick!" This typically extends to direct attacks against another user, or groups of users, but can manifest in different ways. Arguing in bad faith is one such example! While we encourage debates and discussions about difficult subjects (preferably in <#336297840529899522> ), we do so with the expectation that people join in with the intent to educate, be educated, and take stances with at least some modicum of awareness of the topics they're talking about. 

There is a lot of leeway on this! Don't feel like you can't participate in discussions. But also remember that purposefully and maliciously using bad faith arguments is not permitted on this server.

Thanks, and sorry for wasting your time with stuff y'all probably already know. <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
I think you being emotionally compromised by this whole thing has to be part of the discussion, though
I'm pretty sure you'll need to be involved
idk about saki
I'll be around
I think it would be wrong to give olivia/speran the satisfaction of getting a ping from kiri with an official warn but I'd like to consider her shortlisted for banning, with a possible later ban without further action after a three way discussion
yay! I'm glad
Lyssa, I would appreciate some feedback about
things
after your vacation
I support it and I'm going to go ahead and do that for the time being
I do know she's got work this morning so it might be a bit
oh boy
and officially resolve this
<@285555416056856576> you're definitely going to need to review <#336297840529899522> and give some feedback, sorry in advance
dess_warnlog <@!175163984197058560>
I withdraw prior suggestions they be on an advisory role
Jesus
yeah, I've been thinking that for a while
it is, I deleted it
or we could say "spoiler tag unsubbed content"
we could just declare all art channels as open grounds for spoilers
alternatively
before subs come out
what I'm worried about is the art that comes out after an episode has aired
So what do we want to do for art channels during XV? At minimum we should require all XV art posted to an art channel be spoiler tagged, but that's a minimalist approach
yeah, I'm looking for an excuse to at least ban him from serious discussion
I would have made that one private
ü§î
*aside* from the fact this server isn't mine, you just have good ideas
I value your input on it
<@285555416056856576> let me know when you have some time to shoot back and forth ideas and concepts about the future structure of this server
I mean, I have an objection that I don't want to be dumped into being the only active moderator of the server when I have an extremely full schedule for the next week
The first line is so dramatic it undercuts the rest
For clarification, for the time being, I am not going anywhere
Yeah I'm just going to note they're on thin ice for a warning in the future if this happens again
a reasonable concern

???
it was marked as "audition version" or something which
but whatever, we'll get to hear the A-side in a few days and the CD's probably shortly after
yeah I have a feeling there's more to it
youtube channel
an unconfirmed leak of kirika's cd
Keep an eye on the new user, "normie killer xv"
better representation
meanwhile on botw
<@285555416056856576> please let us know if you're alright, I'm concerned
yeah I needed a few minutes to think about it
"someone needs money to go buy toys, please donate"
but I don't see how it's appropriate as a server-wide thing
I feel like this would be fine for one of them to ask, without pings, in general
botw had the other bots
Not really sure Nara's moderator material here
quarantined the two new users
as an aside, I don't think Ikxi would do great, but the other three seem like alright choices and Illindus is also a name I'd want to put in the pool
Since we seem to be struggling to all be on at once, perhaps we could at least have an asynchronous conversation
Okay so some stuff that needs to be discussed, imo
1) Expanding staff - we need more people to form consensus quickly and possibly provide more coverage
2) Kriisa's situation and how to address her stress
3) R
4) probably others but that seems like enough to start
also another one got banned
so they're quarantined instead
I either messed up when applying a muted role or it doesn't cover every channel (<#567740255273222175>)
Yeah, understood
Broken
Also shirabe seems to be brojen
They're now on mute, we had a sex bot flood a bunch of channels (they are banned)
Mildly concerned about 3 users in a row joining with name/number accounts
<@285555416056856576>
I have tomorrow off
I'm here for like 15 minutes <:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
`clearly not bitter at all`
for all 3 times it'll ever be named again
TETSUOOOOOOOOOOOOO
the serena/kanade sunglasses images are so good
I'm proud of you all for using every serena emote this server has in the channel
Serenaserena
no, we'll combine the ideas
Serenagear
born a joke and died too young
it'll be like dogecoin
the standard US econmy
look if the coins aren't picked up they'll clutter the floor
<:KiriCheer:442974585529434113>
there are no neps here, just a serena-shaped hole
<:ChrisAngerDess:496162035856441354>
This is a pretty empty convention
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
<:KiriApproval:453731003383676938>
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
imagine if they only released one serena card for XDU and it was a zesshou
<:XD:453037492933754891>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
serenant, the insect form
"fuck god" as in literally copulate scrmz
Fine's goals are wonderful
Serelua sounds like medication
There might be more but those are two that come to mind quickly and they're quite enough to be against it
being in an LGBT server, for example
two: Sometimes the servers you're in reveal personal information about you
there's two cases of abuse for this: One, you can hop in servers they're in and harass them in previously safe spaces
I agree
but I'll have to wait for Boss' input
Since we have no reason to expect the consent of every user on this server, I'm pretty sure our policy is that we're against this kind of thing
Yeah
Maybe we'll take additional measures in the future
We've banned the bots that enable that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Anyway, Kanade's birthday is over, and the server has been moved back to its former state. It was a great suggestion though, and we'll be looking at more birthday party type things in the future.
<:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202>
We actually just made that channel invisible about an hour ago until we can fix it
I'm in favor of sourcing every image unless it's taxing on the bot itself
https://youtu.be/5vwz3LulCA4
I have the perfect song to put on loop
<a:questionspin:475525016994447369>
If you want to discuss it move to a symphogear spoiler channel instead of a server suggestion channel
That's not integral to being hibiki
yes
was there anything you were curious about in particular
Yes
That doesn't make it any less likely to draw the exact type of person we don't want to be associated with as a server
It's an anime about crossdressing
Not to mention it's not just anime
Oh, this would be a subreddit partnership? I was on the wrong page, sorry
Most anime discord servers have certain very large blindspots
If we did such a thing, their community policy would honestly be far more important than how similar the media is
<:Elf9Seal:432752319017254914>
Months, whoops
Shirabe was a few days ago, I think tsubasa was a few days out
Rakhi she already told you she'd do it after magfest, it's just harassing at this point
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
but it's not a terrible idea
XV in particular will have a dedicated channel for a few months and won't even be allowed in <#336310266654490624>
All promotional materials are fair game in <#336310266654490624>
If leaks actually happen we'll open it early
It already exists, just hidden
should be good now
She's stepped out for a bit, if anyone wants the role, @ me here
<:JiiThreeSeconds:442974585650937856>
~~oh wait I misread I totally did forgotten~~
~~I haven't forgotten~~
That's super cute
<:BikkiOhNo:586337444597596202>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
its tru
generally X (plus the Y) implies Y is held separate from X in my experience, sorry for being unclear
oh
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176> <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680> <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330> <:ChrisHey:607742733817479168> <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105> <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386> <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560> <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792> <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
I count 10
yeah I missed some I think
7 (plus the hug) + 2 animated
oh I like that
while the offer is appreciated and I will certainly keep an idea like that in mind, there are other avenues being explored and it'd also defer any future conflict of you wanting to bring someone onto the team but not being sure they could be trusted with that kind of authority
Eh, I'll do it anyway
I have a solution but it's a little messy for anyone under 18
is it understandable enough at that size?
<a:HibikiWarCry:613117025501446144>
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
<:KiriWhoops:442974593498611732>
Thank you very much!
Just to double check you give permission on all?
I am taking *nom*inations for emote name
I've been thinking about it, it's a little high detailed but it's also not like we're ever likely to fill the animated slots so I'll probably plug it in when I get home
thank you outside!
<:KirikaSpook:602224871585480776>
If someone messes with contrast levels to make it pop more I'll add it
doesn't really work, it needs color work at minimum
<:sd:637318631205896192>
it wouldn't scale down well and it has to be under 256kb
For? The current one is not heavily used
<a:MariaBear:605209620478427140>
You're correct in that a policy will probably have to change one way or another
as a principle I don't think that channel can exist - the current situation is a makeshift thing and one I'm not very happy about
What you're proposing is just a place for people to post unsourced art
the entire purpose of the bot is to source images because every image *should* be sourced and we're too lazy/dumb to do it
Here's the major problem with it and the problem I've been struggling with for it in liveshitposting
I'm unsure how good the grey bar is going to look, but at the very least the background needs to be transparent
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
but B) it'll definitely lose the expression at 64x64
A) this is good
hmmm
yeah! If you want to take a crack at it and do a cutout or something
I'm still thinking about the shem-ha one above, I like the emotion but am not a giant fan of the square of hair
dess_award 500 <@247701824335904770>
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
it'll change on the next birthday, which is nov 7
Yeah, no insult against other ships, but it's highly representative of XV
emotes at their largest size are about 64x64
etc
basa can't aim
kiri has a bunch, yeah
The tweaks are live
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
I like it, though I wish the blush held up better
<:MikuFear:642787437902561300>
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
but also <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
so just count it as planned
New role colors are something I'd like to get done but they'll need a bit for our resident alchemist to get home and move
Some of the padorus may come down after the holidays just due to how many emote slots they take, but for now they're all in
Approved, I'll set them up in a moment
<@!102691114762371072> you know how much this costs me

<@!142136901602770944> elsa, kanade, maria, serena, and tsubasa would all be lovely additions
I've gone ahead and made the change regardless
I have to overhaul emotes with the Passing of the Padorus
I'll add it later today
Regarding the earlier conversation we've come to the conclusion that we are unfortunately not willing to use kiricoin to purchase custom roles or colors or anything like that, sorry
I'm just going to drop a comment here to let you know you're not being ignored but I'm going to take possibly a few days to get back to you on it
<@!238855496797257729> I can't upload 1 and 2 because there's a filesize limit of 256kb, how did you do it?
I just can't come up with an implementation that makes sense
I like the idea
As I said I've considered it before
Please cut down on meme responses in this channel
YouTube is going an EP a day and is stopping with GX, is it really worth this for all like 20 days left of the upload?
They've been spoiled.
The next person joins and is still in s1
Say someone has a "spoiler free" conversation about G
I've considered this but how would that be possible?
It's been swapped out
<:ShiraBean:661077098428891136>
Can someone give a shot at making the white transparent?
Oh that's good
token representation
here's the miku though

but that was 11 slots, over 10% of our entire non-animated emoji budget
if we end up somehow boosted to server level 2 I'll put padorus back
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
yeah it's going to invisibly tiny
Unless we hit level 2, but... well, pretty sure discord's about to rip the "free boosts for grandfathered 4.99 tier" out at the end of the month, so that's not going to happen
Shirabe's probably near the max of what I can give her in terms of slots
I'll poke around in a bit and start adding stuff
neato
Did you rip those out of the episode?
It's here for now, since it's been remade by a user
<:GenjuroLaugh:665645853599465482>
earlier one worked fine
has to be under 256
oh, it's too big
oh I meant to do the laugh last week whoops
<:JiiPleased:442974585596542987>
Updated <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005> and added <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345> which I should have done a week ago
I really need to go back through this channel and look at things but it might be a few days before I get around to it
the goofy face isn't going to really come across tiny
Is it possible to make the top part transparent?
I appreciate the energy of the image but unfortunately we can't use it
<:KirikaCry:671948299179130885>
<:MariaWhat:671948299405885440>
yeah sure take your time
<:ShirabeThink:611251942236094484>
that lone pixel bugs me
<:KirikaMonch:672480608068304933>
actually does someone mind cutting the corner off of
Can someone do the transparencies at the edge of this?
aaaaaaaaaaah
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940> <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984> <:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
we're slowly approaching the point where we need to be choosy
~~or <#407060923078017026> to a lesser extent~~
I'd appreciate if we can keep nsfw content in <#336297808221044736> <:chito_eyes:383687871699222529>
asking Lily if it's okay to have another Hibiki emote is like asking Hibiki if she'd like more rice
~~do we need more than that~~
singular
oh
We have some serena ones
fanart includes fan edits without permission from the editor
Bigger problem with it is that from the quality it looks like it's been reposted a few times
you monster
<:KirikaSob:674720015047720961>
I touched on it on the channel it originally came up, but mostly there's the question of how useful discussion of the show would be if you're not allowed to reference any spoilers. If people want to make a case for it, I'm open to hearing it, though
it's possible this is just a rush
In another few days or a week or so the staff will evaluate how busy xdu is and whether it needs special care
ha
oh sorry
Oh, wow! Thank you
when boosts expire, servers have like a 3 day grace period to deal with it
we'll handle that when we get there
If it's only one or so, I might buy an extra boost every month
We've actually gained a few boosts since we hit level 2, losing a few may not put us out of reach of level 2
so we're at the point where we're going to start being picky
It's also worth noting we have like 2 slots left
it's not staying
Nah, this is just a test
it's too tiny I think

<a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236> <a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236> <a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236> <a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236> <a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236> <a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236>
this is too powerful
oh my gosh they're in sync
<a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236>
but help is always appreciated!
yeah, and the meta's going to be different in global with stuff being distorted by different unit release orders
An interesting idea but a very high effort one, we'd have to manually input every banner
I think the bigger one will be better here
this should be alright
more dmjii love is always welcome
gladly
<:JiiCry:421446826177331220>
Not on this server I didn't!!
1) MG ball is great
2) you might be in the wrong channel
<:SongStone:688213224012644370>
Looks good
Yeah I'll add one if someone gets me a good graphic
I just want to know why the hell discord lists emotes from Z to A

also yes at the rate we're using them we have effectively infinite animated emote slots
~~keep in mind, while we have 100 slots, it's *only* 100 slots~~
for example
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
Not like this is a commonly referred to emote
like <a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236>
I do try to keep to a naming scheme but sometimes things just have to be different
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
this is good
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
<:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
I don't know if that one really displays a useful difference from the other cry ones we have
hm
21 slots
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
wow why are you roasting my staff like this rady
that's so cuuute
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
<:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
<:Bike:690470896892379136> is probably going to be one of the first removed emotes when we hit the cap tbh, I'm not sure going that hard for the joke is worth it
||who?||
updated
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
I think I just screwed up
yeah, it's in my folder
and named [character]padoru so they're all mixed
they're mixed in with other emotes in my folders
I'm thinking it's more likely I missed it when uploading
yeah I dunno
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
oh has it <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I'll come back to this
it might be time for padorus to go
hmmm
you're welcome
I concur that it'd be a fairly dead channel
discussing collections is also okay in general chat as long as it's not super image heavy
the nitro situation has been resolved
Not all the perks, just the level 3 ones
A heads up, someone had to drop their nitro boosting, and we're now 2 boosts down. We're currently scheduled to lose perks in a little under 3 days
we have (virtually) unlimited animated emote slots
I didn't see them either aaa <:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
I'm paying for them
I appreciate its value to some users but there are no intentions at this time to add it to this server
All the girls in symphogear get along, and we should too <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
discord vc streaming suffers a lot if the streamer has a so-so CPU
I'll take another look at it later but I've worked with pluralkit before and we don't currently have plans to add it
as a legendary magical girl once said, that wasn't very cash money of you
That said, please avoid, like, casually insulting the majority of the entire server in the future?
I think it's a good idea for small servers for groups of friends, but I think this place has grown a little large for that kind of thing
a channel devoted to negativity is a source of negativity
I'm glad you arrived at that conclusion independently, because I agree
I'm turning it over in my head atm
It's done, just do dess_iam AMQ in the <#448237561085952001> channel
180 (what it is now) is still 3 times discord's suggestion so I don't thinknit hurt to lower it
Is the bitrate still a problem because like I'm taking potshots at what should work
I cut it in half of what it was and yeah I'll try to do that when I get home
I maxed it let me know if it's too much for some people's connections
To add more color roles? It's possible, we're just running out of distinct colors
if it's something you wish to see recovered you can attempt to message sakimori about it
Markov has been disabled, yes
you're right I cannot resist
to clarify, I don't want to encourage a channel that will become flirtatious or sexually charged, because I do not think that is a very good way to keep people safe in a large public server, which is my first concern when considering this stuff
if it gets buried under the art, maybe the discussion wasn't meant to be
if a discussion pops up in another channel or you have a nsfw question, take it to <#336297808221044736>
I don't think this server is the right place for like, a horny chat, and I don't think there's any way to set up a nsfw-discussion channel so it remains just calm discussion of nsfw material or concepts
titties in anime and stuff are fine but like, it's not the best place to discuss heavy kink
it's intended to be light nsfw yeah
I mean if there starts being extensive NSFW discussion I'll *consider* it
I've been paying for their hosting and that situation seems stable for now
no, multiple colors in a name are not currently possible in discord
I can say for sure the symphogear channel usually isn't that active, I'll try to watch xdu and see if it's inhospitable to questions
the best workaround I can give you on mobile that's not a pain is to spoiler tag an image link so the preview will be spoiled
`||text||` should work just fine
first one needs a lot of work to look nice and sharp and we only have 5 emote slots left
The second two are fanworks and even if I was inclined to, we have a policy of only doing them with artist approval
I'll move shirabesob to weep
or no, better idea
yeah I'll go for weep
yeah but shirabe/kiri sob are already taken, as are cry
I like the Sobaba/Zabasob idea
I have to figure out what to name them
oh my *god*
oh my god
I'll let <@!106866895076003840> make decisions on shemha inclusion
<:FujitakaSalute:688199574917087256>
CarolShock was lost to the days where we had few slots
aside from shipping wars, we already have 3 bots, any additional bots should only be added because of a highly needed function I think
There's a reason most emotes come from the shinais
I actually really like the face it just doesn't downscale well
please don't beat yourself up, being an active and respectful member of the server is contributing to it in a far more important way than emotes
don't be too rough on yourself, that tsubasa's decent emote material, you're just screwed by the fact that with 248ish emotes it's hard to find gaps
there's potential, but there is definitely overlap
rady the new shirabean has white pixels everywhere
Andou one's off the table, 95% of the server population wouldn't know who "andou" was and wouldn't recognize her from the emote
I'll take this in another channel
can someone cut it out
ooh
if you joined it as a halo player and you kept getting pings about stellaris, would you like it
on paper the concept is nice, but I worry it wouldn't make much sense

xennoni that should be covered by our next rule overhaul
My flesh is mortal and I am weak
Please don't tempt me with sweet adorable must have dmjii
The rest aren't animated and must fight for dominance for my amusement
I'll add it in a few hours
and that's a lot
because then we'd have to set something up for *all* said pairings
I'm going to get ahead of the wagon here and say that the server isn't going to really go in hard for pairings that aren't basically explicit
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
is it really that different from üèçÔ∏è
honestly I think bike *should* be first up on the chopping block
but someone would have to cut it out fresh
yeah actually that 4koma hug would be fine - I just can't do a double emote on a non-explicit pairing
it was a joke
I'm not removing ver at this time
~~ver~~
I like hype
bears are not a problem
we have 200 free animated slots
kiri has 3 less as of 50 seconds ago so take that into account
to squeeze more in
it's okay to give our girls some love
kaiyo we have 250 to work with
<:TsubasaDere:689195981841236109> is the only one even slightly worth considering, we can put that off later
bring it up some other time, you all have put out 10 or more emotes that I'd be cutting first
for a character
sometimes you don't want expressive emotes
We can discuss that *if* better emotes for them ever show up
the other two are characters that have almost nothing
kanade I could agree to cutting
she has very few emotes and it's a solid one
I'd rather not
but I'm not rehashing this conversation right now
I've had my eye on it for a year
A lot of the older emotes on the server I'd like to keep around for history's sake even if they're not used a ton
kiricoin might be cut but I'd rather postpone it
the first I'm determined to keep for legacy reasons
even
I think <:AYAYA:656050350314487808> is a twitch emote
is a famous meme
<:AYAYA:656050350314487808>
off server by a server member
I see it used often
Sure
It squeezes out most color and detail
So shrink them that small
Nevermind, even though you can upload images that big the biggest they display is 32x32
Even the biggest possible size, 112x112, try shrinking down images to that size and seeing how legible they are
I think it can be really hard to grasp how small emotes are
Neither would do well as an emote
We have enough crying ones in general, theyd have to be extra good
Micha maybe
The Kiri one maybe
Asumin does not need an emote slot
We will try
We want to work with you but there is some amount of burden on yourself to try to selfexamine
Aria, you perceiving moderation as hostile is something staff can only do so much about
There's no perfect sterile way to tell a human being theyre going too far. We'll do our best to use the best possible language, but as users please try to accept guidance when we give it
It is *everyone's* responsibility to keep peace here. People who have a staff role have just accepted a higher burden.
We've stepped in in the past when it came to a user oversharing over a period of months, kaiyo
I'll consider an official emote server but we obviously want to do everything in out power to make the best stuff accessible to all
That's amazing
Then it's rejected on the basis that it's either going to be favoritism or way too many roles and work <:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
Rady it's rejected on technical reasons <:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
While I would welcome lighter matters, I would like to state that if you feel like you have something to suggest for the server of a heavy matter, don't feel like you can't say anything because the conversation has moved on
*In addition,* the server already has more than a small amount of channels and permanent channels are only getting added on a basis of them really being a necessity, like <#567740255273222175> was last year
~~I actually had this typed up hours ago on my phone and forgot to send~~
Since this is in an official server business channel I can be a little more frank about it - I'm glad people are having a good time with kirifish but I've also noticed it annoys a decent chunk of people. You're encouraged to still play with it in continued moderation, but I'd have to decline a channel or other exclusive area for it.
that's a different command
I do not see a typo
what are you trying to do
I'm not fundamentally against it, I just don't think we *have* to have an Akira - but something something miss shots not taken
Some don't get considered for long, but they all get considered
I consider every image that gets posted here
The original server owner didn't put an Akira icon in because historically it got used to be dismissive or sarcastic to other people
that's the kind of image-dense material that live-shitposting is for
if you're documenting the cooking process
also
you're more likely to get people talking about it in live-shitposting
yeah absolutely
bake something fuckin fancy though
if you like
I'm not going to definitively say no but <#407060923078017026> is much more of a "hey here's what I made to eat" channel
uhhh
also it's long
it used to be #collections-and-hobbies but that didn't really get across the fact that you could put stuff you made in there
yeah
on second thought I'll just remove the nsfw tag from it for now
should probably note that somewhere
it's not meant for like, porn
titty figures
I know why
OH
Hm.
Ah.
This seems like a pretty good compromise
> <#357682999300718592> - Have you created your own artwork/fanfiction/other content for Symphogear? Share it here! Everything is welcome, so long as it falls within SFW territory.  NSFW creations go in <#336297808221044736> , though you're encouraged to drop a message in <#357682999300718592> telling everyone to go check it out! If you see someone just uploaded their content, please consider waiting an hour before sharing your own!
what, they can post it in fancontent but no actual discussion can happen? That doesn't seem great
yeah
<:chito_eyes:383687871699222529>
it's being discussed
rady I'm not ignoring your point
it's also in the channel description if anyone cares enough to read it, which they won't
yeah, but as katafrakt points out, you generally only check the rules channel of a server once, or once in a long time
yeah...
I'm not saying no, I'm just asking if maybe that's clear enough
you cannot get in without a warning about it and it has the icon by it
discord screams it at you
is that needed
for a while
yeah, you can tell we've been drafting this
oh
I've triple checked it, it should be fine
yeah you might need to ctrl r I guess to clear the cache
<a:thinkspin:393587517196075009>
while I appreciate the joke I really do not want *any* sense of confusion
should be fixed now
ok do-over
oh thanks
besides, the padoru jokes aren't that far away from starting in force
a single padoru is fine, you can live with it
it's still 31 unless there's a different place to look
this is just a notice to the community that if nothing changes we will be at level 2
or don't, I'm not specifically asking for boosts here
why does it matter
haven't checked
I haven
someone who was double boosting probably ran out of nitro or something

they relaxed the requirement from 50 only a few months into the boost idea when they realized nobody's going to get it except the biggest servers that are probably partnered anyway
we've never been at 50
The most impactful consequence will be that the 100 most recent non-animated emojis added will become grey and unuseable
I don't think this is important enough for an announcement but I thought I'd note it here
Just as a head's up, we've lost a boost and will be delevelling in 2 days
I think that's why it tends to end up there
we only need 1
we're delevelling in 2h
<:CharlotteSip:709139006939725924>
I don't want them to suddenly vanish because it's april
emoji rotations don't feel ideal - people generally work certain emojis into their conversation pattern and have automatic go-tos
especially since the emotion it conveys isn't very notable
I agree, it's not worth the effort
These have high potential but gotta look at what to cut again <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
garie laugh is going in though
I'm not sure the new carol adds something that these don't cover decently?
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831><:CarolBlush:617039657896509460><:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
<a:padorudefault:654781130083532851>
Thank you!!
Relic of a bygone era
I'll probably delete it later
It's also not self assignable
which of the two do people like better
we don't need it as a pog
sorry I don't think I was clear enough
> As much as I prefer comic style, vastly over anime, <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042> is more pog
which mikupog should we keep
anyway I added it
you're looking for stuff called "zesshoushinai"
torrenting, generally
idk if we're there yet, but if you feel like doing other girls, it'd mean more chris would be fine
there's a point where I'm going to be reluctant to add more specifically chris animated emotes
What if instead of having like 5 sleep emotes, we got better images of them all and made them a bot command that rotated randomly
hmm
~~I try not to say forms of "well actually" to anyone when I can help it~~
I saw you post that earlier but it doesn't change anything
> But <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> is the only Kirika emote with glasses,
I'm glad this was brought up, it's the primary reason it's still around
if it makes you feel better matt no matter how well it's done that monstrosity is not being added
if they would rather not talk than obey those, I'm sorry to hear that, but it's a channel on this server, not a separate server
They are not required to join conversations on other channels, but they are required to not choke out xdu with discussion of other stuff
No. I'm not facilitating their desire to have a different server on the server.
it's still not getting in though <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I'm sorry if I upset you yumi, it was meant in good fun
Ngl I'm concerned a media channel would just become about toku and people would go there to talk about a tv show or book and just get annoyed looks from people who wanted to talk bugmen soap operas
just as a curiosity how much would I be prostituting both my ethical integrity and my love for kirika and shirabe *for*
we've already lost them, it's under the grace period
level 3
fyi we're 3 boosts short
wait we did
oh thank you!
not a good way to sell me on it
I really, really do not want to dedicate more slots to a joke
I'll consider it, or other solutions
Huh
moderation staff doesn't have the time or energy, and I don't think we ever could do this, to check on whether the content being shared follows server or discord guidelines
no
one of them
`p u r g e`
sorry lily feel free to
oh no
I am playing god
<a:smump9:719779671176380456>
> How much would it cost to remove the kirifish emote?
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
LILY THAT EDIT
*we're seriously running out of distinct colors*
Again,one of the biggest problems
we do check that the roles are actually readable on both themes
we have cape for that
<:MariaSip:731709620065927240>
the fish joke is already overplayed in the introductions channel and I don't intend to make it more central to the server's identity
Unlikely
it's an interesting idea, my major reluctance is that it would only be for those with nitro, but that's not a hard no
I'll probably be replacing it with the chibi
tada
We're only two boosts away
There's also the question of whether Lily would want to set up a system where the girls she's very fond of could be easily paired to kiss anyone else, and I would support her if she decided she had no desire to contribute to such a thing
I'll leave it 100% as to her discretion if she wants to tackle it, though I do think 14 emotes is a lot... if it gets done I might go through with that aux server idea <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I'm not sure she's taking commissions right now, but she can read this and think about it
I'm asking for them for reasons‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
don't worry about what to cut
yeah I'm replacing the shirabe wink now
Please submit emojis that you like that did not make the cut on this server (that still abide by our emoji rules)
if I promote private emote servers they'd have to follow the same rules
but Server Emotes‚Ñ¢Ô∏è can't use any fanart that doesn't have the artist's permission
oh, you're free to use whatever emotes you want as long as they're not offensive and obviously break the other rules
no, the server has rules about what emotes it can use

on paper I don't hate it, in practice I feel like it would require creating like 20 roles and mean that almost every image gets a ping
rady mentioned it and I haven't fixed it yet because this weekend sucked and I'm being lazy
wow I remember removing carolshock, guess we added it back
At least on phone
Looks good when not in line
If it doesn't end up here it'll be on the emote server
I'll review stuff
If this is something people want where would they like me to mention it
I don't mind writing it myself
Ygg doesn't have to say anything
After boosts expire there's a 3 day grace period and admins know it's coming
So I don't ever post about it because it comes across as begging to me but do people want to be made aware when we're going to drop a level before it happens
Do you have a preference on the emote name? It has to be Kirika[Something] but as the artist I'm willing to let you suggest the name
I'm fairly certain it would not look great at emote size
oh, speaking of which, we drop a level in 3 days
animated emotes are really simple to add and I don't have to review other emotes first
where is it sourced from
Its a remnant of a time when the server was a magnitude smaller
<#371105434771390465> wasn't originally intended to be the discussion channel honestly
Not much at this time
I mean if someone started talking about ladybug in there I don't think anyone would blink at it
I personally am fine with all animation and related content being anime club
It's been added and I've added you to <#739277869124943964> to credit you Star
Yeah, lemme ask, do you prefer KirikaPlease or KirikaPlead
When it comes to bots kerrik's opinion counts extra out of deference to his effort
Its not out of the question
We had it once, it was turned off well before the bot left
It is likely to not just be a bigger/better version of what you already have; this kind of thing has a decent chance of altering server culture over time
We'll continue considering it. I am curious, though, as to how many people actually want this server to be a focus point for creating horny symphogear smutfics? And, please, remember that this could include stuff you don't like, like ships that might feel bad to you, or self-insert hetero smut.
I'm also concerned that people will devolve from using it to respond and critique nsfw fanworks to using it to be horny at gear characters.
Alright, I disagree; channel bloat is a problem.
Once every 30 days sounds more realistic at this time
by an order of magnitude
Also, I think you're overestimating how often the channel will get used
there's also the point that needs to be discussed that a channel dedicated to discussing nsfw fancontent is going to badly trigger and/or viscerally upset someone at some point, even with precautions.
<#407060923078017026> is currently used to talk about nsfw games (not, like, rance level, but I'm not exactly sure an in-depth discussion of that would be desired on any incarnation of a nsfw channel in this server)
I currently see one or so a month, if that
I'm not commenting on the suggestion atm, but am reading feedback on it
Correct
I actually don't see how this would be useful, can you explain?
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
We have this
I see where you're coming from but I think it's fine for both channels to have a low chance
She doesn't currently have independent rates for channels, and I don't honestly think it's too needed
I've been focused on keeping it low enough so it's a rare event
If general being interrupted is a problem the argument should be to turn it off
Ive been counting how many times she goes off after every day and adjusting
N-no it doesn't
<a:ChrisShifty:744677308631089162>
I feel old
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
MikuHype > MikuSquee?
birthday bot command seems great
we can maybe move the old to the secondary server
I do like the new kiriactually better than the old
<#739277869124943964>
ngl I like a lot of these <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
‚ùó
I added <:KirikaSusWarm:827361152916258857><:ShirabeSusWarm:827361152702480385> to the emote server ~~just in time for it to be irrelevant~~
<:HibikiAmogus:827221273523519498>
I am not at this time prepared to change every channel, but we can do that one
you've had it for like 3 days zenbu
possible chris that can be replaced imo if people feel strongly about the new one: <:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821><:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889><:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792><:ChrisShock:620077681484103680><:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>
If you wanted to host them yourself we could talk about it
<#673253184885489696>
it's sounding like you need a vtuber intervention friend
Yes, but only Kizuna Ai
*monkey's paw curls*
at that point might as well put it anywhere
yeah
I'm concerned with a space where people could talk about the newest content without stepping on toes
I'm not concerned with giving the manga a channel
Idk if you noticed but it's a wall of spoilered out text
Would people be interested in a channel to discuss manga chapters as they come out
Thanks, it should be fixed
I have seen vtuber chat happen in live shitposting on a serious note
The server's level is already not on a trivial verification level
Did you get it from someone on this server?
üëå
which includes deletion and etc
users can only unarchive if they have the manage threads permission
Also I've done some research
threads aren't very visible anyway - only in the top hashmark - unless you're in them
you can choose how long it takes until it auto-archives, but not to turn off auto-archiving
there is no such thing as a permanent thread
I have thoughts on this and I think threads have a place but I think it's going to be a limited and rare thing here
I have some nascent ideas but they may take a few weeks to mature
Threads are useful but they come at the cost of needing to be watched
but those channels aren't going to get threads
Oh, sure
the fact that some people don't want to go to general to talk about things and just live in there isn't the server's problem, per se
I see the benefit, though the channel is explicitly there to be flooded
interesting
if their vent gets out of hand, they will be asked to take it elsewhere, not a different corner of the server
Threads are not going to be used to help people vent in serious discussion
oh, kerrik did cover that
This isn't the server to do that stuff in
or on the server in general
Actually, the major reason is I'd like to discourage venting or begging for support in that channel
I'm very upset at you for spoiling the possible surprise
We've been discussing it
~~it was there all along~~
I was thinking faction badges
More seriously thanks for the feedback
~~dont you use emojis in your username?~~
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
I mean, not the thing I responded to
but that's not what they asked for
this is how it was set up before
yes
Elfnein is a fork of nadeko
I mean, if you wanted to stack it on top of the current system
afaik you cannot do a color me only x command unless you made a new bot
more or less, they're largely a hold over
we had it like that originally
people asked for the opposite
It's possible
but I'll add something to the channel description
there's already a new rule proper for it
üí∏
maybe y'all were planning to but I've honestly been so busy with work I forgot <:verytired:739234579994640424>
That's a pretty good idea
it's not my place to tell the people who want to use it, "hey, you should use these pronouns instead"
I understand and I may add that as another option but I'm not going to mess with the requested pronouns
we/us was added by request
having 'fun' with the *intention* of annoying other people is technically against the rules, y'know
you remember correctly
even if I think it's dumb it's not my place to tell people they're not having the right kind of fun, unless it harms someone else or the server
I once put my foot down in the symphogear discussion channel when the hibiki don't think image started to chain because that's fucking up the space people talk in and force them to scroll through garbage, but the shitposting channels <#384870333620027403> and <#407060923078017026> are whatever and y'all can do what you want in there as long as it doesn't violate existing server rules
not in the shitposting channels
I also wanted it to be more menacing
So, for goodness' sake, be good
It will sit there, watching you, to see if you've been bad or good
It's not leaving
asterisk seems like a bad idea
I'm sure that would be a beloved feature if it was real
probably with bots and roles
How many times should I post this PSA in a row?
Very little to lose, maybe, but very little to gain
The last one was posted immediately after the regular fell for it
I'm for doing it if it will help but I don't want people putting the channel on mute because it's annoying
the most recent announcement is literally don't click suspicious links
we get new people continuously but I'd estimate we get maybe 2 people a month or less who would actually check the channel - and, even if they did
I'm really not sure what I'd say on a new announcement I guess
Don't click links, don't input your personal info
If you really think it'll help I can do it but like
it's still phishing
It's... the same thing
<#336300750248476693>  ?
if you are tired of repeating the conversations my biggest advice is don't join them when they happen
it's not going to stop the discussions from repeating
I gotta be frank
that said
they've been prompts before so you can always ask for them to recur
maybe it's just late but that looks pretty close to leiur and hibiki to my eyes
lily put in a lot of work adding the last batch of colors to make sure they'd work
oh, right, there's yet another constraint in that it has to be easily readable in both light and dark discord
that just sounds like inventing a color that will get confused with both fine and carol
there isn't really many options left
it has to be visibly different from these three

okay but did you read the part where the eye has to be able to tell
only the last answer is even close to a valid actual answer
one of the problems is we're literally running out of unique colors the eye can distinguish
what color would an adam role be
I think I'm going to stop discussions about what show to watch now, and if people still want to do group watches after the rewatch, it can be reopened then
I'm beginning to see a flaw here
but I assume you want this to be a lasting community thing
if you two want to make jokes about it then go do a private watch as friends
I'd probably want to close nsfw if we went public
it's essentially a community run activity
it's just that it's my job to read this channel but I can't promise they do
though I would definitely recommend DMing one of them with it
seems fine to me
It is a common complaint, is all
It's <#336297387863703552> or <#336297840529899522> is what it is
I don't want to moderate a public nsfw channel and I don't think the rest of staff does either though I haven't discussed that with them yet because we've never really examined the idea
not to isolate it
the objective is that the channels enable conversation in places to not be overrun
if every subgenre has to be forbidden from general it gets turned into a channel where the only thing that happens is people say hi and bye
to not mince words, I don't really care considering care's gone into the topics of the channels, and some liberty should be taken to avoid the most generic options to sustain the feeling of community
which is the intention
western cartoons are generally talked about in anime club
I intend to ask that manga remain in anime club
that might be enough
well, I suppose it'd get used, just 90% LNs, based on server history
I'm still not sure there's genuine interest in it
I'm interested but it would need to get used more than once a month
you really don't have to suggest stuff like that we'll definitely announce it
this is probably the lamest way I could learn about it :(
There's been a lot of people going "oh we're split" but like, we're not
That's definitely a cross that bridge when we come to it considering I talk to Alice regularly still and I don't think an actual split will happen any time soon
That was a polite suggestion to stop shitposting in this channel
Time to run this experiment for tabletops
<:blobcatthinking:575405441018888364>
End of service
The xdu channel makes enough jokes about eos being just around the corner that I don't need to
If it comes up frequently enough it may be worth adding
It is the kind of niche thing that general may actually be a better fit for if it's getting drowned in gaming?
As someone who has purchased zines before I will say your audience is going to probably care a lot less about written content than visual so keep that in mind if you're putting one together
I don't think server staff have the time to organize something but we can try to support someone who does
This is a discussion of possibly changing that policy going forward for birthdays rather than an argument that mistakes were made presently
This post was to open up discussion on the matter to get a finger on the community's opinion; should consensus be reached I will do my best to make it clear
Especially since they get archived
I'm not a huge fan of people having to open and join a thread in order to find works
I've had this thought for a few months, but would people be open to changing or removing the standard grace period in fancontent during birthdays? Creations during it can be time sensitive, after all, and the desire to create and post content spikes during that time.
üí∏
I think it makes the server more unpleasant to be in with an excess of unneeded channels
In general I'm pretty against channel bloat as a server philosophy
elfnein's a nadeko bot, her quote function works just like any other
in extreme situations like something explosive going on the server or people spreading hazardous links you can be as public as you want lily
~~almost never, on this server~~
it's something that's been on the table a long time but you all also found the major hesitation point
that is more or less backwards from how these things generally go lily
probably in lesser situations too but there's no nuance to those and I'd prefer being notified sooner rather than later
Bots are needed to record edits or deletions
After the incident we had lately its prudent of us to log
Maybe
Could be a mobile thing
I moderate a very large partnered public server and they don't seem to have it
I don't even see that on a server that *should* have it
It seems to be moot atm, I don't see an option at this time
Interesting
I don't think this is necessarily one of them but like, if a feature has to be babysat
While that's a topic that can be explored some other time, a thing that needs more mods is questionable
And mobile?
And again I need to see how visible it is to moderators who don't join the channel
Also no pinging is a small problem too
It is slightly more useful when someone is streaming but otherwise it's the same or worse as having a voice text channel on the server
<@331908049822547978> it's literally just a text chat for voice
Point against it
Hm
Maybe!
Undecided, I haven't looked into ease of moderation yet
it's been requested that people use this channel for the intended purpose
that sounds like a neat idea
#relationship-problems
the point about it being fit for a symphogear server is a very true one and I can't see getting rid of it
that's a pretty good point
traffic is important to some channels but is not the end-all-be-all of every channel - <#458060276550336522> is valued no matter how slow it gets in there because your personal works should be showcased
and I think that would make people less happy
on that note, though, I feel like I'm actually dis-incentivized to rename gaming because while stuff like PC gaming tech definitely fits, stuff like his videos on radios or analog color TV signals definitely do not, but if the channel gets renamed, to, say, gaming-and-tech, the logical place to dump them would *not* be general or anything, but be the gaming channel
yeah I noticed you've been working through technology connections and I think they're a great youtube channel - I've watched them for like 3-4 years now but that's getting a bit off topic
things not having a defined channel is okay, that is definitely what general chat is made for
The name idea isn't without merit and it'll bounce in my head like a dvd screensaver for a while
A few thoughts: 1)*WHY* is there this sudden huge push to have a tech channel?  PC hardware gets brought up in this server like 2-3 times a week, and generally does not generate large discussions, not the 2-3 times a day I'd think it was a good idea to have a new channel for. 

I've been mulling the idea over since it's been proposed, but since it's been proposed, *basically no one's talked about it on the server.*

I realize there is an aspect of "if you build it, they will come," but there just doesn't seem to be this huge use case for it, despite the rallying in this channel.

2) Regarding some hobby channels with very low activity, ~~somewhat <#447132690349555712>~~ not music but definitely <#449826367903629313> have been considered to be cut for a while now but the former gets considerable use, even if there's little discussion so that's fine and the latter's mostly being held up by the fact there's one community d&d game being hosted on the server created in times the channel was more active, so out of respect for a community-made endeavor it's sticking around for now, but unless there's a hobby resurgence it will probably vanish someday

3) Moderators are being considered, there will probably not be an application form.
<a:HibikiPanic:670496622194589696>
I'll probably add the bloons role if it continues to be a recurring thing
<a:KirikaPlead:991905685967208529>
<a:KirikaPlead:991905685967208529> has been updated
I'll try to do it when I'm well enough to be on my main PC
whichever you want
Is it 100 over a 24h rolling period?
Just, something to consider
There are no firm guidelines here
It's a good use but I think you should also reflect on how often you use it and for how long
Streaming is open if you ever want to have more of a community watch vibe going
A lot of what I've seen live posted anime wise is stuff that's kinda niche or wild - cast and his terrible tiddy anime come to mind
Every few posts would probably also work fine
Idk, I don't personally know how people feel about spoilered content presented like this, I am open to feedback before firmly deciding anything
Spoilers that people have to work to avoid are something to make you feel better rather than something actually useful imo
If this seems excessive maybe it shouldn't be live posted
It's unreasonable to expect someone to scroll up 20 pages to find out
Every post
I'm also really unclear whether content that's spoilered should be live posted, though I'm probably going to say it shouldn't be unless you mention what series you're spoiling every post
The split wasn't to allow someone to post in it non-stop as much as it was to enable someone to use the channel for sfw stuff
I'd just like to poll feedback on how the <#977744682035605514> / <#407060923078017026> split is working out, any observations or suggestions
less easy when there's 300 of them and they're ordered by *date added* with no option to filter alphabetically
it's one of the oldest emotes on the server though
Events no, they're moderately obnoxious enough that I don't want to use them for something unrelated to gear. A role to ping sounds fine. Polls or anything are up to whoever wants to run it.
yeah go for it
I'm not... against it? But channel philosophy has tried to avoid channels that go without use
Carl's mostly here to record message deletions etc
Just use shit post channels and don't annoy people with them I think
What commands are these? They're not really here for users to use commands
that is what I'm saying doesn't happen.
to see what they were promoting
You would look at the channel to see what other people were doing
by 'ignored' I mean by anyone doing anything other than posting their content into it
I've yet to see a server where a self-promo channel doesn't get ignored
I'll add them when I get home
<:Hibipog:724036037742952481>
they have no other purpose
2/3s of those are really only useable to be a toxic ass, or to ironically pretend to be a toxic ass
That's really cool that we got permission, I was thinking about asking myself but I was stopped by something
Mhm
Time to decide what emotes to execute
Please reply in the thread.
I'm interested in people's opinions on if and to what degree AI-generated art should be permitted on the server. These comments are not designed to spark an argument or discussion and differences of opinion are welcome, I would just like to know some points of view of server members while staff considers what the server policy should be.
I think the team is more interested in finding solutions than in punishment, and the userbase is small enough we can get away with that for the time being. It does lead to some cases where it can be said we might be too permissive, but I think the other direction lacks empathy and respect for the server culture.

Another busy server I moderate works on a two strike system so I definitely get the purpose.
I appreciate your willingness to find compromise; the current liveposting situation is a pile of compromises as is to try to provide the most utility and purpose without having like, 8 channels
in the mean time, even when someone's liveposting, you have a second shitposting channel to use if you like
I don't wish to do that, as people find it enjoyable
I feel the only fair alternative would be to not allow liveposting in general, including for symphogear watches
I do definitely think there's a marked pattern of sundays looking like CIA documents and I do think we can shift some of that to <#377148557796442134>
the shitposting channels are intended, at least on my end, as a catch-all anything goes (as long as it doesn't break server rules; not taking some decent care with spoilers for hot content would qualify as not following "don't be a jerk"). I don't think having 30 pages of one person reacting to an anime would be any more welcome in <#377148557796442134> than it would be in any other non-liveposting channel.

I don't currently have plans on disallowing any Spoiler discussions in anime club. They are going to be a little hard to avoid to occur sometimes, but if there's a heavy conversation starting up, users are allowed to ask it to be moved to <#377148557796442134> . Saying "no (marked) spoilers in anime club" is like saying no spoilers in gaming, not even when it's incredibly related to the topic at hand. It's kind of stifling to conversation, and generally being asked to move to a different channel is the same thing as killing the conversation. Sometimes it needs to be done, but sometimes it's unneeded.
yeah sorry
she did get a new mech in the last game or so though
she hasn't gotten meaningful focus since probably OG2
yeah she's suffering from the bloated cast
Alpha 3 on through to Z
my personal favorites are the late PS2 games
no, though I feel it used to be better
I may have played an excessive amount of srw
she's still effectively 14
the OG universe is like what, 3.5 years past OG1 now
I'd just like her to actually grow up someday
but she rocks the gothic lolita pretty well
yeah I really like her uniform
Latooni with the sniper rifle is actually one of the only times I've ever felt it useful to have the ammo resupply item in a SRW
My favorite bits of her are probably when she's pretending to be a super robot pilot to impress Ryusei though
Yeah, and then I moved her to the Wildraubtier with a sniper rifle and she almost soloed some maps
thank you

Hello!
~~also Re:zero walked off of a cliff after Rem's arc~~
Actually at this point I think it's safe to say it is trash by default, but due to statistical sampling, rather than an inherent feature of the genre
I think that may have been the intended jape
ü§¢
That's like calling zelda "have you ever played The Legend"
Bread, you can't shorten the series name to "Mahou Shoujo"
...
as arbitrary systems go it's 23/23
it's very arbitrary
plus more
that's still like 120
that's still 2 songs per disc
since it wasn't released when I wrote that post
Actually is it 60 now? I don't remember if I counted the XDU OST there
being song #31 is pretty good
There's 59 fuckin albums
what was my stat
there's

Kirika is good and my sister idolizes her
quality avatar
aww your avatar is cute!!
hello!!
but maybe I changed for that
I'm pretty sure I made a point of not attending
I'm not sure I've abandoned the Elfnein color since it was introduced
Chris has 26 people rocking Ichiaval Red, while Kirika has 15 rocking Igalima Green, if that has any impact
difficult dilemmas
hello!
The only solid detail is that it's in winter
We know next to nothing about the plot of xv, only intentionally vague hints
I feel like they've been dating all along lol

they're in the "are you a bot" corner
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Hello!
this isn't 100% proof and as I said they're not banned until proven guilty, but they're in a channel where if they are a spam bot, no one but mods sees the spam, and if they're not, they can tell us and we can let them out easily
So far they've all had the same naming convention of <name><3-4 digit number> with no profile picture
also hello Potatoes, what a fun name
They're in a place where if they're people they can let me know
yeah, probably!
they were all bots
they're all gone
Hello?
o/
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
there's a few differences though
little bit yeah
hello
discord seems to be doing a decent job disabling them
hmmmmm ok
Again, I don't see why we need to be a dick to just anyone
no
well there you go
check the roles of the two probably-bots
just, you know, without being a pain in *everyone's* ass?
also rakhi we're already doing that?
no this one's probably legit
welcome back!
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
audit logs show no kicks
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
hello again
not a bot
they've spoken before
this is a returning user
oh hey!
so they like to just throw out random letters I guess
the other seasons are G, GX, AXZ
it's the 5th season
XV's just a title
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
they probably use a little for some of the concert scenes later on, but if they did I never noticed it
actually yeah I'm surprised symphogear's used so little cg
yeah, the other server this happens in has all joins only mentioned in an admin-only channel
one other, I mean
happens on at least one I am
I think it's a discord wide problem suddenly
I don't think it's that we're special or anything
<:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552> if only
no differences
that one, on the other hand
no it's the crest of the SEELE organization from evangelion

The OVAs? Usually they're torrented or something, I'm not aware of streaming sites that have them - but I also don't follow many streaming sites

please don't

Do keep in mind that right now the server's under a bit of a spoiler lockdown in terms of XV, where it's all contained in <#431914167826382860> - but also, the newest episode aired like an hour ago so you might want to wait until it's up on crunchyroll or your site of choice before heading in there

hello friend
ads, sloppy translation work, and they don't subtitle all the songs
as a note, crunchyroll is uploading AXZ but has not fully finished yet
I personally do not advise crunchyroll either but it is an option and one that is more convenient for some
Generally people use services like crunchyroll or a less legal streaming site, or they torrent it from sites like nyaa.si

Be aware the server's abuzz with season 5 stuff since it's airing, but if you keep out of <#431914167826382860> you should be fine. But s1-4 spoilers are allowed in the symphogear discussion channels, so beware <:laugheline:454887887847030814>

Welcome! <#336297387863703552> should be spoiler free but beware of all other channels
but that was well over 2 years ago
to be more accurate I didn't have nitro at the time, I just wanted to see what *kinds* of emotes were here
it's why I joined lmao

san diego has better sunshine
haha nice
Pretty good
anime nobody cares about either has impossible or extremely expensive merch or dirt cheap merch
but it was only 20 bucks
rip me I succumbed to temptation and bought a fig
and it can stay there
*custom onahole*
And now I kind of want Chris to summon her overkill gear and fall over
I kind of want to get one of these and paint it red and name it the Yukine Chris Gunsniper Special
it is a general non-symphogear creative content and collection channel <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
this channel was meant to be both from the start, the name change is just to make it clearer
but I am intrigued
I feel like the tsukihime and melty blood people would destroy everything else in a mega crossover
nevermind it's a decent deal
oh it's the pvc
and other suppliers have it for less
amazon has new ones for 90
180 is ridiculous
yeah if it's the figma, and it seems to be
wait no that's an order of magnitude off
you weren't kidding
wow
Price
¬•4,571 (Before Tax)
But it's nice
I don't have 180 to spare for that kind of thing
Yes

That was a contemplative ü§î
It is preowned

The metroid is squishy :3
The metroid is pretty firmly attached to it's capsule and I'm not breaking my favorite amiibo
I never saw this question
do you lack the fine taste needed
why wouldn't I be
I didn't realize I had the amiibo backwards
that's actually an ass shot
Figure quality is medium but since it was 20 bucks and from a show no one likes I'll take it
Best girl has come home
aside from the regret of being broke
if you buy every color you'll have no regrets
I went from /m/ to /tg/ and *could not escape it* for entirely unrelated reasons
this is part of why I hate the meme
there have been plenty of memes with actual thought behind them but "its red so it goes faster XD" is not one of them
all the low effort ones
~~I loathe mecha red memes so much~~

you generally don't
liger zero isn't a particularly great unit and the multi equip function isn't really her style
bikki would probably be in one of the million cat-like melee-based units
also her swords are wings
exactly the right level of cool
storm sworder!
I feel like blade liger is too cool for basa
Leena was a ridiculous character
neat
if they get multiple, amiami will restock
generally it's not amiami so much as it is that these things only get one production run
but it's very unusual
I have
yeah
it will probably never be restocked
don't think it's confirmed yet, but since the seasons were planned in tandem it wouldn't surprise me

I want the XV version
`nice`
I'm probably going to sleep soon, actually
Social exposure is definitely something that's going to change a lot of things about her life
oh, youtube
YT?
oh, sure
well, I mean, author-inflicted suffering is basically bullying <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
suffering allows them to show strength in hardship, or grow from it
I am incredibly mean to my own characters, generally
She certainly comes across as eager but new
I can imagine when she's fighting the forces of darkness at 25 and grimacing every time she transforms
like, she clearly worked on it at home
Either just the annoyance of magical shit getting in the way of your life or the fact she clearly spent way too long coming up with a bad rhyme
this is completely original content, right? Not based off any actual magical girl show?
It ended in a weird spot, but I imagine you plan to keep going with it?
It's fun
word should be able to handle odts
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
this is why we *renamed the channel* Kriisa
This is for non-sympho writings
Good taste
I really love s1
There's a few that are close for me but this isn't the channel
Fukken love her b side
Wow that's the sexiest 800 dollar shelf I've ever seen
Looks like a kitbash
<:Elf9Seal:432752319017254914>
It's like seeing model Ts and a supersonic jet getting used in the same story to me
My opinion hasn't changed
If you can instantly transmit dozens or hundreds of tons of mass long distance, why is it so hard to vaporize something a kilometer away
Warping doesn't seem to fit with a world where telepresence has a noticeable delay and long-range energy weapons require massive stationary generators
in my opinion
You want to strip away hugely convinient things that don't seem to fit with the tone otherwise to avoid the same feeling
Videogames are full of artifice for player and game design convinience and they contribute to making it feel unreal and without real consequence - they remind you you can just reload or turn it off
You don't want video game similarities
but I wanted to pass it on
not mine
no


I feel like warping feels technologically off and pushes it from "kind of feels like a videogame" to "definitely feels like a videogame"
it feels like 4 different books at once
hmmm
my favorite merlin is t.h. white's merlin
a young girl can be very concerned about the aesthetics
I think that's fair
especially while she's still using her c-rank NP
yeah, original Saber is a good compromise
hacker magical girl
fucking
My favorite magical girl was that one-off thing for Chisame in the school festival arc of Negima
well, frilly dresses with swords, yes
I've never seen a cross
I feel like it's either sword lesbians in power armor or frilly dresses with wands
~magical defense fields~
oh yes I remember that
bikini armor!
(it's better in the movies)
with a bow
Nanoha's barrier jacket, for example, is just her school uniform
Usually they don't pick how it manifests, but sometimes it's a psychic manifestation of their tastes or other things
Magical girls with elbow pads and kneepads
I refused to hold it still long enough
I was weak
compared to something like that is it a big deal if she's a chick?
who lived backwards in time
it was wonderful
The solution the the crisis in the book revolves around crashing the monolith's alien computers
fully titled 3001: the final odyssey
the 4th book in the series started by 2001: a space odyssey
this reminds me of that thing they had in 3001 where the moon had a vault of all the worst computer viruses and malicious code, unconnected to any antenna or network
but most of the every day red tape of humanity feels like it'd just sit on physical memory somewhere
I could see them having hard copy backups
company merger conditions, treaties, terms of surrender, maybe even marriage contracts and stuff
but NDAs seem so *routine*
I think some things will have a hard copy backup
*probably* not? I feel like a digital signature and maybe a biometric signature would be the norm
for treaties, wills, and big super important things? I think theatrics is something that will never leave humanity
For everyday stuff? No, not really, no more than you do when you sign EULAs or sign for packages
That's an interesting question
hmmmmmm
The only time italics are ever okay for a body of text in fiction is for an in-universe journal or textbook excerpt
She shoots punches
emitting an anti-at field?
titty kilometers is too many titty
"the only action she'd seen besides training was <pirates>"
what about
the magic power of 3
the things brains find aesthetically appealing is weird
<word>, <word>, and <long phrase>
ironically making it a three part makes it flow beautifully for some reason
there's nothing technically *wrong* with it, it's just unbalanced
<one word> and <long sentence> is always weird to read through
the sentence structure is a little off
all I know about it is that it's from Os which is around the point I stopped going to /m/ so I stopped getting dripfed knowledge
kamen rider has a fanbase on this server but it's not universal <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Kriisa is a woman of all skills
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Hayate is a stickler for her way
They all seem so happy to be there
I don't think cockpit cams are unrealistic
hmmm
it's what the big yellow disc is on the gundam's beam rifle
because mechs usually have gun cams no matter what
are these mechs?
her school uniform but a ribbon on it
which is just like
Nanoha's movie barrier jacket is so many times better than her TV one
that's true for every mechanical design in nanoha though
the movie version of her hammer is so much better
if she's german shouldn't it be wita
A... hetalia meme?
I've seen this reference
riichi
I still haven't opened up my Fei Yen Miku
oh, damaged
that's tempting
bikki nendo is 55?
movie design ‚ù§
Lots of nanoha
2 remixes
oh, cirno perfect math class
and marisa stole the precious thing was like the one iosys touhou remix I don't hate
also hetalia is worse than touhou
oh right how did I forget
aww the elfnein sleepover poster
damn
I don't think Ver's a very compelling villain to use? He's just... giant meme
I'm pretty sure she's an expert in whatever the animators think would look cool at any given time
I am not an expert in swordplay though
she's been portrayed using stuff from kendo, iais, and lord knows what else
I haven't noticed her using any style
that said for symphogear fan works you may want <#357682999300718592> - this could work, but more people check that channel I think
I mean the Akashic Records would *absolutely* be a relic (and the most broken one ever) so sure?
Firestarter and Carrie are two big examples
Rakhi might be thinking of Stephen King stories, which frequently have little girls with supernatural powers attached to emotional states
saving humanity to lord over it as hero and king
that was very much not abandoned warehouse district
Tokyo Sky Tower scene
also there was the whole
I mean, Ver destroyed pretty much an entire naval fleet
the only people we saw die that wasn't his or maria's fault were in flashbacks
every single noise summoned in s2 was his, miku attacked the ships with his programming, frontier lashed out and destroyed the navy at his whim
is pretty much directly his fault
every single death in season 2 except for the people maria killed
lots of times
with the cane
yep
it's what drives him, even though he lacks the moral fiber to really be a respectable one
he has a need to be a 'hero'
sure he doesn't come from the future, but that seems like a trivial point aside from giving the girls/probably just hibiki a chance to say something cheesy like "then we'll make our own future *punch*" or something
"a dude who says he's the savior but is an asshole and kills people" is literally the antagonist of season 2
üòÆ
even slightly
not that
Ver is
Typically the god emperor is supposed to be comatose, but even beyond that he's supposed to be charismatic and liked by almost all
or readers
I think he's an even worse protagonist assuming your viewers know anything about symphogear
But I do like that kind of title styling
ironically I'm just reminded that Sonic and the Black Knight actually had a cool plot in spite of being a sonic game
I do kind of dig the supernatural wildcard agent you have to try to talk with/around
I'm not saying those dragons are bad, just not my thing
it sounds like it works for you
still
but it's embedded in tolkein so everyone does it
the greed idea
yeah, that's the other half of dragons I don't really care for
I dunno why I've just never been into the d&d or Warcraft style dragons that are almost more agents for factions than anything elsr
Despite some of the problems my favorite dragons are still McCaffrey's
nice
and we've seen what he'd do with it
I feel like ver's already had a shot at near-unlimited power
I'm still sure it's not more powerful than some of the riders, but
shit we didn't see
I also want to note that frontier could do
not really, I'm fairly familiar with how shounen media likes to trip power levels
the former, maybe, but I feel like the latter is rarely
are kamen riders typically more powerful than someone with the cane or frontier
I mean
because as much of a living meme he is, the one interesting thing he did in GX was he was totally willing to die to actually be that hero
and of course ver's somewhat dependable as an ally against anyone who actually has an annihilation goal
because you can use them against each other
a world with two vers seems less dangerous than a world with one
who is basically a kamen rider and is factually the savior of the world
very impressed with Hibiki
he never seemed
probably not
though he may have been scheming to stab her in the back
I think he was willing to be second fiddle to Fine
well
you're not wrong to post it here but you're totally entitled to put it in <#357682999300718592>
it's okay here too!! It's just <#357682999300718592> is the home for it
but
<#357682999300718592> is for symphogear fan stuff you made, this is for otherstuff you made
<#336310266654490624> is for symphogear related content you didn't make, unless it belongs in an art channel
n-no
Ah, okay
`what is a flame toy, I'm a huge gearhead but I keep away from transformers`
That's really cool!
for Gundam, anyway
S Gundam and variations, Crossbones, Victory, Shining, Flag.... probably my top picks
uhh
what suits?
Ey nice sumo
I'm unsure why this is a grave sin that no one can possibly enjoy
I know lawyers that love phoenix wright
so like, she's been born at least twice at that point
also it gets more complex because one was a domestic care gynoid except like... she got put in for maintenance? and then the world kind of ended? leaving her to wake up with her memory formatted several hundred years later in a starkly changed world?
still wouldn't call them births though
or maybe activation date or maybe several other dates
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
And technically one ended up stealing an element of transcendence from Elohim and experienced an apotheosis and now doesn't really have a beginning or an end
I've got about 5 who are artificial beings
I've never made a birthday for my OCs, they either were never born or I just never cared enough
damn, that's good
Neat
If it's written it just needs tags
NSFW is fine as long as it's spoilered and tagged of it's non written stuff
Lmao I forgot what server I was on
Oh wait
Safe for work only
Yes!
it's a cool idea but
it's depressingly common in magical girls now too
and they fought with the power of ROCK or whatever their genre was
What if it was just basically fate/stay night but instead of summoning heroes you summoned musical artists
what was the inktober prompt for this one
no that kind of stuff is generally live shitposting
compare marvel vs dc movies
implementation matters more than concept
probably someone has but *it's not a major cultural phenomenon*
that I know of
No one has personified music and made it fight
One of the biggest traps in creative exercise is the need to do something never done before
way more happens
there's 1 relationship between two sides, there's 6 between 4
or 4 factions or whatever
I remember seeing a writing lesson about how to structure a good story if you just set up a 4 corner pattern the writing basically happens for you - 4 characters with specific, seperate, contrasting goals
and opens it up into a shape
the most important thing is it takes the fight away from being a binary side vs side conflict
and way more to deal with contrasting values
a good fight has way less to do with action
and, honestly
it's a good narrative device to have several main characters of differing values and morals clash
yeah the reason it's been used is because it works
even last season we had granbelm
it's like half of all magical girl stuff at this point
your style's really cute
especially given that it's not a classical symbol
I find it interesting that pluto is in the middle
scylla and charybdis?
hahaha
not bad, I feel leaning even harder on trying to sound nasally would be perfect
oh neat
hey neat! nice to see you still writing
<:nospray:656050349270106125>
wao
she's never seen 00
good luck!

<@!263534352422404096> if you're unsure about MG, just buy a HG or RG
hibiki praying for your success
nice GN drive
I actually really dig the greyscale toning
super cute
it's good
oh god yeah I see the nichijou look
I had all 6 original Toa, all 6 uhhhh the first new form they went through, and all 6 bohrok
*bionicle*
I can't really say that many do at all
it was wild
and then the first movie was just a direct sequel of the flash game??
I had the GBA game and I really liked how it actually lead directly into the flash adventure game that was surprisingly huge and well done
lost interest pretty quickly after they moved away from it
but seriously I really loved the mata nui part of bionicle
Pohatu is the coolest and Kopaka is the second best thank you for coming to my TED talk I will not be taking questions
nice work
woa
I kind of have to agree; while model making certainly belongs here, I'm not entirely sure how far that extends to putting together parts in a mobile game
does it cut pizza
aaa I love her
it's just him
c l o u d s
terrifying
Still beaten by superGM
Superzaku
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
also that core fighter is dope
especially since it seems like the ultimate evolution of the GP03 concept
I love the V2AB so much
I think the worst was unicorn which had a ver ka kit before it had any other kind
a katoki... design.
also I always find it weird when they make a ver ka kit of
bandai kits pretty much never require glue under ideal conditions, but as lexi says, it can help
Office lady vibe is a good vibe
Cute
this isn't #gunpla-general
possible places to put it include <#336297674707828747> , <#336310266654490624> , or <#407060923078017026>
I am going to ask that if it's not your build, and you don't own it, you refrain from putting it here
I'm really excited to see what palette swaps we get for smash tbh
super good
I like this sword
Nise Gundam/Fake Gundam

this just reminds me of the OG fake gundam
I love Lucifer so much these are great
Aaaaa
I hope we get the throughbred story animated someday

<@!436484603276951583> I'm going to ask you as a moderator to stop pinging people and putting them on the spot to give you criticism. I've gotten private complaints and it's completely within someone's rights to decide to not give feedback and not feel guilty about it.
looks good though
I mean it's Genesic, there is no goldion hammer and I think a scale model of the crusher would be beyond your budget
regarding the exchange earlier
you're not going to get in trouble because you acknowledge people exist who aren't allowed on the server
`w i d e s c r e e n`
I think the biggest issue I have with the digital one is the odd flame effect in the iris
I like the pencil better but they're both good
What's the significance of the one green vfin vane?
I think you overdid the saturation but there might be a decent in-between
Unless there was something going on elsewhere, your responses to them do not particularly warrant an apology
you're fine
<a:aKirikaShake:750076140798083136>
<:PapikaPout:636113698280439808>
but I do think hibiki would need to challenge noriko for the title
pretty great
That *said*, <@!436484603276951583> please be aware that begging for input is bad form and if people don't feel like giving you generic feedback, they won't. If you want a tip, try asking for more specific feedback when you post it, rather than general feedback 2 hours later, because it really does seem like you want attention when you do that.
<@!740195087895756820> This is incredibly out of line and engaging with anyone like this is definitely against the server rules, particularly since we've been over this exact kind of behavior once before. Your posting privileges are getting removed for a week so you understand that this is a final warning and there isn't going to be a third time.
especially compared to the freedom
they look very disappointing when folded up
the backpack is honestly my major complaint with the suit in general
Sweet zoid
that's just Tempura Gundam
what is the punishment for failing the dab test
Hell yeah I think freedom is my favorite ce suit
it sounds like a PSX version of the song
I like this a lot
Looks great
Oh damn she cute
I saw the twitter post and damn those eyes good
ü•ö
That box art is maximum obari
nice
I am a white girl who hates heat
waiting for the day where bandai solves the issue of bad gold plastic
There he is
you just can use the gear-specific channel if you want
here is okay
<@719658405911855174> more symphogear fanart is always appreciated! If it's symphogear art you can put it in <#357682999300718592> - just make sure it's been at least an hour since the last art or writing contribution so everyone is fair to each other
<@247701824335904770> I love your design and especially the little circuit-like tattoos
good luck?
so uh
I'm pretty sure the hyper mega launcher was like hs exclusive or pbandai exclusive
do you prefer the hi-nu style of orderly fin funnels or the nu makeshift wing?
there he is, the boy
looks good
James Bond's giant robot with the power of the sun
metal cirno
I dunno if she treated herself with SOCs or Volks but they can get pricy
the fancy gundams are honestly probably generally the less expensive ones there
There they be, the Metallic Ones
Especially since it's rival is the Turn X and that makes even less sense
No I think it sounds pretty dumb
‚àÄ Gundam is hard to beat
If you want goofy Gundam titles that aren't spinoffs though
Asuturee
Much less in Japanese
I do also want to check that you're aware that "astray" is an actual English word
It's a spinoff manga so the bar is lower
I could keep going but you can talk all day about shitty Gundam names
A man called four vagina faces off against someone called jamitov hymen in the second Gundam anime ever made, I think they gave up
Crossbones have so much cool ideas in them
ikuraga looks good
its the girls
I like this a lot
have one more box shot because it's the single coolest thing I've purchased since I bought the SoC GaoGaiGar for my ex as a goodbye gift
this is my favorite bit of packaging
The most invincible super robot under the heavens has arrived!!
(shirabe for scale)

Large...

One of many
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
I was thinking of the ootori but no, ootori is much uglier
Oh that's that weirdo pack from destiny hd remaster isn't it
Yes
I'd play it but I think it can be tweaked
Also there's a lack of basically anything before 1990
(reused shows mean reused animations)
So it doesn't get me fully hyped
It's alright but some of the shows have been overused in srw last decade
I feel like she has the power to summon an anvil over my head

oh my god
Discord please
No because it has raids global doesnt
No because it has raids global doesnt
for the weeklies just do the practice raid 3 times a day
right now I'd prioritize just cashing in on any hard raid you think you can
honestly?
it's how they were supposed to be, whoops <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
Right now there's very few people who can really make a dent in a hard boss, just as a warning
Or let them know of a hard boss that's got some real work put into it
Thank you!
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I'll be returning to it to knock it lower and lower
number is 894904181
yes!
It's up, please assist! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
well, I'll be posting it after I wipe to it
I'm posting a red raid, it's only normal, could people please try to knock it out? It's for my weekly.
that's how they do
There's a green humanoid alcanoise at under half health by a korean name if anyone wants to hop on
and advent
nothing in the game right now was designed to deal with a level 70 unit except for raids
honestly, at this point, I'll take a 52
I'll take a 60
<:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>
good hungry emotes right here
<:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000>
300 damage shy
Yeah, though there's a commonly used 3*
and is strong enough to be used by those who pull her
The new Maria's also int
thanks to her color
aot basa is decent right now
and probably getting lucky with piggy backing on a few raids
You can do that much damage too but it'll take a few weeks of getting good units and multiple copies of good units
or really good MLB units
the people doing 200k typically have level 70 units
-20% will make them do 0
mind you, if your healer only does 20% healing
I don't think so
you mean like a hard enrage guaranteed wipe?
the downside of LU 3s is most of them have really unimpressive skills
Oh
lol
real talk? a level 30 LB0 FM is probably a better unit
yeah squishy in raids doesn't work great
whoops
oh this is raids
or 5th, I guess, I moved XD Jii up to 4th
I use her because my 4th spot is honestly pretty weak
and even then she's still fragile
she needs copies to not be fragile as hell
Flaming Ring
4* red yeah
but having a counter to FM is good, considering a level 40 unit will do like 3k damage to a blue
she's very tanky but the damage output isn't that fantastic
AoT Basa is mostly harmless except to blues
Ignite Shirabe and XD Kanade are the biggest counters to FM atm
yes
yeah, the best Body character right now is one you don't want to LU
I'll probably be doing these once or twice a day for a bit
thanks kaliks
so close to getting kill credit
rip
shit dude they sure are
It's up
it'll be up in a few minutes
lemme make sure I have follower room
894904181
uh
Alright, I'll get started on the fight
Hey, if I post a green carol, is there anyone willing to take some chunky swings at it?
Not really
<@!98283721718763520> can you free up follower room
oh
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
ah, well, work
I could use assistance working towards my first 70
Has anyone been on a carol binge recently
5k is super easy
o/
yeah if you could ping me when you have slots free that would be nice
so it doesn't get sniped super fast
make sure to only open it to friends
I picked a bad time to start the gold quest then
oh damn
why repeat the cycle before Kiri though
no one's really sure what they're doing
it is a little weird to be overlapping
and the event's a distant sequel to another event we haven't had yet
people wanting to know if a unit's close, they get told no, "Hurr hurr, gonna be next week then"
these jokes are getting really tired
at all
ogawa's not soon
relic fusion between SSJ and Aigis
oh, tama
not yet
there is no shem ha miku
ganbare!!
they won't be useful for me for ages
yeah I got 5 giga hearts but
1 giga, not bad
joined and paused
you don't need
well
for the good rewards you kinda need 10
3% 5% 10%
year+
after AXZ content started to be added
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
roll 15 times and you'll get one
the event girls are getting really shafted
probably not any time near zwei wing though
eventually
at least giga rainbow are always useful
I forgot to check who killed it but I had a full health raid cleared for me an hour ago
I've got work in an hour
what's the ETA on that
at 4 the XD Shirabe's just straight up better than level 70 3*
XD shirabe's about as good at that level
if you have 2-3 it's not worth it
Do you have XD Shirabe?
eh.
calls her a relic in the selection menu
or is red carol easier
is it alright if I put up a red relic
actually I do need red crystals
I put the green carol up for unrelated reasons lmao
sadly I've pulled no ignites or I'd take you up
<:sadmiku:432799416227725312>
red is ignite mats right
it's green carol though
oh you already follow me
yeah I've got one up right now, let me clear room in my friend's list
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
I need my first 70
I mean if you want to knock down some green carols I can put them up
this is supposed to be more targetted at co-ordinating raids
also you might want <#673253184885489696>
feed them to a level 70 now or later to level up the skills
neither are happening
so we can kill?
to flex
1 closer! and giga rainbows are useful
thanks for waiting I had to add them
I'm in
what's ahegao's ign because I think I see the raid
thank you
oh!
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
ping me if you do red relic
dw
is cool
ah I didn't get in on the carol
is the 5th joining dragon
thanks all for waiting I had a phone issue
all in
ok
give me just like 60 seconds
scary fish man
it is
ugh, slowly getting there
only 4 now
I hate how he goes three times first
<:nospray:656050349270106125>
so 5
all rainbows <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
at some point we will be soloing them
yes raids get easier
As time goes on and people get better units
I should have room
894904181 but I probably have to make room
uhhh
well, I have a carol up, if anyone sees it, give it a smack or two for me
üò¶
I missed carol
oh no!!!
unity shards feel easy to get compared to the needed number of awakening gems
nah you'll find a home for them
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I need 7 more
I wish I could give you my heart crystals
god really?
another up by geostri in the yellow
all my best stuff is red
I have no units capable of really touching an int raid or I'd help
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
8 more to get
whoops there it goes
if anyone's got a green carol raid at like, last hit status let me know ;-;
shame I just started pvp match
oh shit
I need miracles so if thats up that'd be cool
getting there...

which isn't a roll worth the trouble
so I'd just get the participation bonus

did we do carols yet
ahhh
Alright I really just needed Miracles so I'm stepping back, down to 6
can't remember
either midnight or with daily login reset
3 more for jii orz
rainbows! <:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
ok, standing by
okay!! one sec
yeah @ me if it's going down
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
normal's probably better for megas, since the highest damage credit is megas and not gigas
I think the current number is 8 since I'm pulling out
I'd also like to request heart
you're putting up raids with 1hp left right
miracle
actually I think a hibiki can clear faint
yet
I don't think anyone can clear faint/silence/berserk/etc
also several shirabe units can clear poison
there's a few units that have select immunity to poison etc
not yet
bern was asking about the techs
every one counts
being a giga away is suffering
even a giga
tech crystals in there
make sure to do your weeklies
orz
I need a single giga miracle
thanks for checking though!
nah I requested it for saki because I knew she'd be late
I'd give you giga melodies if I could
get all rewards for yourself
that's cool
you can farm them on 10cp then
wao
poison is only from Phara
I don't think she ever stops using heal debuff
she makes for better FM bait than what I'm using
though actually yeah I'd probably take shirabes for them if I could
can you give me a good unit instead
I don't think they have a special rate
so many
I have so many giga melodies
where your ability to get Highest Damage is *completely* RNG
ah yes Fine
you'll get there
it's in the name
3* MLB mems will eventually be meta in arena due to cost
and the bonus gets improved by LB
yeah
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
Your first three get taunted to only focus on Leiur
All P to rush carol doesn't work
there we go
we're 70 XDJii buddies haz
I should be fine
lmao
hope I can do it on 3cp
I'm in
I followed
working on it now
<@!431656503490117632> is the one who would be the role assigner though
we have three bots here
I'll poke at the idea tomorrow
Hm yeah
12+ XDU roles is definitely excessive (there will be more raids later)
The capacity exists, but it will probably not be implemented
Wow, rude
there's no way you're not going to have a million of those
5 giga rainbow is worthless
the 5 giga green is good
damn thanks haz
gonna go ahead now, I think that's a decent wait
same
I do!
they will focus the elemental weakness in the group, which is carol
Alternatively, don't use red units
Leiur will taunt them
If you want to focus on leiur, make sure they're in your first 3 units

o
are you all talking about ignite basa
burnbasa is the red 4* basa
f
I'm rooting for you Crystal
6*s gain additional attack chance, counter attack chance, and 50% damage reduction to defense piercing attacks
Please ease up on the suicide jokes
kiri happened
I think I have about 80k
The joke's gone a little far now
no
quite the niche piece
that's
yeah someone's undercharging
hibiki goin hard
rip monty
They were amazing trailers
Not that it's a slam
RWBY peaked at the trailers
she would take all the drugs
I know nothing about dogrunes but anyone who has the capacity to say "yeah I was an ass sorry" is a good dude in my book
But no, kirika had to kill her
I want fine back
lol
GX was not a good show
yes
???
alt 236 gets me √¨ so
I was like "why not try it" and episode 1 was ridiculous enough that I wanted the rest
magical girls but with mecha suits
honestly for me it was the character design
I wish akb0048 didn't fumble at the end but the ride wasn't bad
"it's batshit" is sometimes a sufficient quality
I wouldn't have watched akb0048 or haifuri if I watched anime because they were high quality stories
and I don't think it ever will be
let's just put that out on the table
symphogear isn't exactly the pinnacle of storytelling
determination to fist
working through tension and flow
Tsubasa's got the rubber-band type strength working for her
design-wise I'd say Kirika's the second most athletic body shape
that's like one shot
Maria's pretty squishy
Everyone else is either willowy or squishy
Hibiki's the only cast member that really has overly athletic tone to her
No I don't think you're wrong
to me she seems the most in-shape out of any of the main 6
probably
chris looks like she ate too much spaghet
nice
does that count as loss of sleep
that is pretty gay
It just posts bullets and ribbons
The secret to linker is w e e d
I was like "the fuck???" when she showed up
my OC even had "Emerald Night" as her theif name
because she's *terrifyingly* close to one of my first OCs
My favorite's Emerald
since someone was considering watching it for the first time
It still would have been considerate to avoid the spoiler, though not mandatory
generic super talented girl
watch them if you watch nothing else
the best part of RWBY is and always has been the first four trailers
monty went too hard in on "I'm trying to be anime"
first season is kind of trash
but they're all really good
It's hard to compare that with some of the Freelancer fights
also the Tex fight in 8
Okay yeah Red might be the best, but some scenes in s9 are close
my favorite bit of monty's work
I should watch s9 of rvb again
in G it was I think a shmup fighter and in GX it was Gundam SEED
I'm actually curious what she'll reference next with her X-drive ship
I feel like it needs her X-Drive spaceships in the background
carol's very well done there
should be kiri's face with „Éá„ÇπÔºÅ in front
the dendrobium missile pods and the fractal crystal arrows are the closest
I'm a little surprised chris hasn't gotten a grenade launcher
which are objectively better than grenades
because singing and friendship can give you missile platforms
if it's good enough for homura...
maybe next time it'll be the dendrobium
my picture collecting days are over
I've gone through the collect and lose cycle too many times
do you really need 4 girls
*back*story
I love how they can't keep themselves from just layering on more shit to hibiki's backstory
calling her ass out is enabled in every channel, saki
oh no, I was just scrolled up
oh she found it after all
totally <@449062815534153748>'s fault
her desire to fight is the strongest out of the main 6
She's been on the borderline between bloodthirst and hot blood
I miss chris with bloodthirst
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
*banned for life*
as far as I know they're just colored powders

tsk tsk
though I do really love the scribble judges on those back images
thanks(?) DL

a r t
üî´
that's a lot of moonrunes
Dang
don't forget Shiraback
***art***
teenagers are filthy impure beasts
as an added bonus then shirabe would actually look for sources
that image should be pinned
I mean I would have thought that right click > copy image and the ctrl v was about as painless and low effort
why not just upload
kerrik you *know* that posting 4chan links is a bad way to share art if people might be checking it a few hours later right?
oh hey kuwabara
she full on desus
she doesn't dess though
suiseiseki is the one true desu-er
I mean it could be that she's a filthy pervert
I wonder why carol chooses to be a little girl
this is honestly a likely explaination
hahaha
<@&425667771699822614> please dump the like 3 pictures that exist of topdad in honor of father's day
lewd
and I mean I get that some of it is budget, but a lot of it is "but the merchandise!"
"okay it's over, back to noodle arms"
"better give hibiki some mass because it's a training scene"
they do this a lot
she's fit in the op but nowhere else, really
yes bless the OP director
"see look hibiki has the *slightest* hint of tone when she's wearing her gear and only then" is laaaaame
and it's shitty that we live in a world where that's "*not marketable*"
body types of all kinds are good and symphogear girls should be way buffer than they are shown because they fucking work out
is good shit
I was a little too busy hanging out with saki and dragon yesterday to jump in the conversation but for the record, I like your art DL
ugh
oh it's not actually
ü§î
with a name that showed up as the first result in a google search
signed their artwork
if only they like
<@449062815534153748> you're breaking my heart

shirabe please do your magic
neat
oh the wiki sources
but it's probably offiicial then
ten I don't care where it's from I want artist source
rare, medium rare, medium well
is the secret project a mahjong table
dang
s t r o g a n o f f
Fine was at the epicenter of the curse
I don't think godly power is the same thing as being directly hit with balal
It left during the last ep of axz didn't it
She'll just pout instead
She is too much of an airhead to say fuck
This is probably my favorite anime alignment chart
She has steel
Miku is sweet but she's not soft like elfnein
She can get mad as hell
Miku will totally say it one day
G Maria was more than capable of saying it
She's a fireball though
It's always a small category
I was really objecting fine' s placement but accept the given reason
I feel like tsubasa and Maria should be switched
She probably doesn't say it as an explitive but as a verb
The chart is for attitude, not documented cases
Has anyone ever made a 'says fuck' chart for symphogear
I like how itaba just fires off that name in G like it's nothing
oh nice
like maria had
chinese dress
do you have shirabe in a qipao by any chance
oh that's a good look
one of the better anime schoolgirl ones
the lydian uniform is honestly very good
Kingdom hearts 2
That meme is potentially older than some users
Maybe she'd interest me more then
I wish they did less 'I'm weak' development with Maria and more 'holy shit how do I live with the person I was in G'
<@102691114762371072>
Shirabe is fed up with your hypocrisy
gomen
Haha whoops didn't mean to spike your anxiety
I'm at work and couldn't search it so I went with ~~annoying~~ pinging you
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Iterative meming might better be done in a different channel from now on ü§î
Shirabe just felt like slacking for an hour imo
We wanted you to feel needed <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Haha
üëå
Righteous anger
I support Chris bullying Hibiki
Sunkissed
or am I dreaming this
Didn't they leave soy sauce on Mammu's grave
it's kind of hard to read
I think?
she's holding soy sauce
I was in terms of service
oh I see
you don't have to answer ofc
so I'd like a ballpark
they don't list their pricing up front
<@256945399338631168> how much was the piece
leave her ponytail alone
where she assumes her lover is interested in someone else and gets depressed over it
I think Maria would be the horrifically insecure kind
no
Maria would make a good prince

in my favorite one the during the secret boss you can hear the agonizing scream of a tortured man's soul as it's ripped apart by the super computer you're destroying
kirby games are fucked up
02 basically is an evangelion angel
ciel is still bestgirl
like chi is ti
shi is really si in the pattern

that'd qualify for "not as good as the first one"

I can't imagine having eight pets
But who is the owner ü§î
Apparently all the girls have leashes
woah that autoscorer hibiki
she needs to lift more
She looks good in a collar üëÄ
how glad I was that robot shows stopped being like they were in the 80s
I think I realized in the middle of dancouga
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
is she powered by breast milk
how do you ignore magic breast milk
I read that as going from hearthstone to college
100 years later, elfnein recovers their souls and puts them in autoscorer bodies to fight for justice once more
aigis is easily bestgirl in p3
aegis is an autoscorer OC but yes aigis is also good
I wish I could get them to draw aegis
they're fairly newly made
only 4 so far
hibiki is the best one
but I still love them
I've seen the first three before
I REALLY LOVE THESE
it wasn't really a full gag until GX
though she was less DESS in G
dess +50
she's such a chuuni
personality or whatever
kiri would equip the items with the stat that does like, nothing
look at her and her powerful scarf
I feel like character design peaked at G sometimes
still want basabutt shot
it's so good
I keep looking at the autoscorer hibiki
or was it hibikibutt
chris displaying the awkward tsubasabutt shot from s1's fight with nehushtan chris
yes, good
she digitized
do tsubasa's zesshou next
I feel it's notable because they put the characters' breasts on a different, closer 3d level than the rest of their body
did you play the 3ds version of pirate's curse
it's just the movement tech in pirate's was so good
half genie hero was fine
even if half genie hero looked *really good*
pirates curse was the best one
homestuck is a webcomic with occasional flash video content
throughout all fictional media #2 seems really high
I mean he's scum but
really
I think elfnein is becoming my favorite character in symphogear
hibiki bursting out of her shirt
neat
~~no~~
I am pro-cape
shirabe is the cutest housewife
she's been napping for two days and saki knows
she knows

mine, from forever ago
there's plenty of magical girl shows that do it just fine
BIKKI ALTER
shirabe's is really good
is chris hiding a boner or what
the homework is sorting
do your homework
I feel like chris would wear a skirt even as a boy
Does she source tumblr
Could do without the heterochromia magic child thing though
Makes her look military and aerodynamic
I like that kirika concept
Holy shit
there's a few errant `s
I hope you're appreciating the irony here
\_____\______\______\_____\____
she is precious
Yeah, make sure the pantsu are off <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<@!102691114762371072> MS. TSUKIYOMI IS ASLEEP AGAIN
...oh
What a flower
<@!102691114762371072> your bot has developed narcolepsy
Since we're still in the context of collars, I imagine being called a good girl feels even better, eh?
Good point <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
kink is not sexual inherently but there is a relationship
but the power dynamics you're implicitly asking for are more popular among artists who do nsfw
and I know you're not
they can be
you might get better results if you ask in nsfw
I like office lady Chris
It's just
Extremely there
I am not lewding it
*navel*
where she was pulling off that weird next door girl barbie look
ponytails can be sophisticated, but irl twintails are never going to leave the association with late 90s britney spears for me
high risk mild reward
it'd take one badly shut door to undo 4 years of work
no girl would ever have them though
sure they're neat
like these miracle twintails like shirabe where you can somehow have like 8 strands of hair that reach your hips but nothing else
twintails look horribly juvenile and doll-like irl for me
(X) Doubt

Modestly in demand
The rare non-sub trans girl <:Germain:421434126856486912>
I'd say like, 70%ish of my friends?
But seriously, it's a common theme among trans girls
pls
not even wing zero
wing gundam kanade
huh
AI lewding is fun *not that I've ever written such a thing before*
Kyaa~ you can't ask to see such things! She's for kirichan's eyes only <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
If only we had a bot that looked such info up
Elfnein needs hugs ~~especially when her daughter is being mean~~
We have a new fan of them here
I'm kind of curious what happens when Maria finds Tsubasa's collection of Kanade gravure shoots
oh these are super pretty
it's been bounced around a lot, usually with rwby characters, but not always the same ones
oh, hm, my bad
how many more times am I going to see this conversation with different people
But I'm sure it was something
No idea
Hibiki deserved it
ü§î
That would be a mistake to do that so I can't do it
Then no mistakes are made
Unless you're me <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I bet that @YuriMGirl posts lots of fascinating things and compelling discourse. There's no way such a prestigious account would be full of maple and symphogear shitposting, or anything
very good shit
thanks kriisa-chan

shirabe pls
üëå
<@!263983345669505025> hit me with a robot
she's probably #2 on the "most famous anime tsunderes of all time" list
you're kidding
that's probably what people are keying off of
Rin Tohsaka, but with a rack
she looks a lot like Rin
I like that last dress a lot
Mio's voice is the fucking best and I wish her rasp got more big roles
I need to rewatch nichijou
It's probably god
what a million dollar smile
the sadness when your giant claw hands can't hold a parasol
that sounds like a good start
~~I still wanna have anime nights sometime~~
but since there's not, you're not
if there was a Fate route movie you might be
you're not
thats like an 80 hour experience
I'm not going to ask Kriisa to read the VN even though that's totally good advice
the climax scene with the double throw is *SO GOOD*
and I will fight people who claim otherwise
fate is a good route
~~why won't they remake fate~~
*considers putting the fate movies on the list of shit to watch if kriisa and lat ever have anime nights*
R you could say the same thing about the franchise as a whole
yeah
good character design though
that's fucking adorable
https://twitter.com/Rabbit_XV/status/1023580496742113281
or just a very summery shirabe
do you have shirabe with popsicles
<@!263983345669505025> okay sunglasses are no go
you don't see long twintails in real life, and when you do, they're full bodied "this is all of my hair pulled into two tails"
so is Shirabe, frankly
yeah chris is extremely Anime Hair
for like 3 years
this also means that if her twintail gets trapped or cut, it's gone
and only a little bit is long
this means that almost all her hair is cut short
Shirabe's twintails have like no volume
it's not
no idea what I'd use as a profile picture
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
ah
is that an apron swimsuit
pls
<@!263983345669505025> Shirabe in sunglasses, nsfw works too
she looks like a 2010s jrpg protagonist
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
maybe she's always that big but just isn't wearing a bra there
adorable though
*massive kiri rack*
wow that's heckin gay
I like it though
Miku with a cape
Nope
I got it slightly wrong, sue me
I have good taste in memes
I knew it has to exist
It's been "adapted" a lot
She's really embarrassed because he said something really cheesy about her on camera
There's a japanese meme where a guy is interviewed with his girlfriend next to him and she's hiding her face while standing under an umbrella
<@263983345669505025> is there a shirabe/kirika "special someone" edit
*determination*
I read it as "I am going to sink my hands as far into these pillows as they'll fit"
It doesn't look like envy to me, though I guess it might have been intended to be
even if kirika is *a little* too big
<@!102691114762371072>
that one is excellent
serious, I think, as I have been told by my beautiful co-Illuminati that nsfw is really an art channel
(good shit though üëå )
actually I think I'm going to delete that because it's <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436> too lewd!
you have good taste
we might want to move to serious discussion or something though I wholeheartedly agree
I mean collars aren't the only way to have a power dynamic and aren't required
like I know three girls in this server who are or wish to be collared
I exaggerated their rarity slightly but dommes are valued and if you date another trans girl, from the experience of my social circle, collars being involved are not rare
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
They have no shortage of girls to fawn over them
Trans girls who top are as rare as gold and as valued
She's not on Spiro
As long as you don't mind being cissplained we can talk about it
Submissive/masochistic/etc seem to be common and I think I know why but I'm not going to go into it in public
I think that was my clue, beyond the stereotype
She posts Maria punching things in her Twitter like once a week
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Yeah but I can't ping Alice if it doesn't look like Maria can beat her up
Where is her muscle
Reversed roles than what I'd expect though
Oh that's adorable
someone really likes helpless tsubasa
DMJiimon
they're standing on it
das some gay shit
MEGANE
she has the muscles for it and can already do an axel
shirabe would be the best skater, of course
chris you can't pose like that with a skirt
`comic sans`
I can't take these megane kirikas
cirno with tattoos <:thinklink:301637755316994049>
miku toots as they please
I don't know, commit to the swimsuit or the seifuku
the sailor outfit is like
They could have done better
I hate shirabe's
except shirabe's
these are really cute
I don't know much touhou but I know circle 9
I did
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> elfnein my precious child
Piggy no
tons of love
they get plenty of love
they don't need more love
ugh I hate the whole setting
but I lurked on /tg/ for enough years that I fucking refuse to sit through another topic of the worst part of the lore I've always hated
I'm predicting that'll change within another edition or two
<@456226577798135808> How do you feel about white capes
No, embeds work
Elfnein as Schierke is too perfect though
do you have any with thumbs up
that's gay as shit
the omelette has tsubasa's name on it
oh my god
cape tiddy
Precious little terrorists
orz
`is powerless`
d-d-dess
I think of the angel in the volcano in evangelion
We've been asked to not be lax about it
oh and the cis ones are good too I guess
All girls are precious and good and girly, no matter where they are in transition ‚ù§
she's not been able to get on HRT for a few years and at this point it's all twisted around and is just reminding her of what she can't have
There's a girl I know on twitter who's slowly selfdestructing over trying to claim every cute as goals

MAID OUTFIT
<@!102691114762371072> she okay?
actually she hasn't sourced anything in a while
uhh
source is <https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=65115131>
shirabe please


Clearly we make a pair
It's probably the green
I love the look of the one on the right
"oh man she's great"
my rewatch of GX for Aegis was like
I think elfnein
who is also elfnein

elfnein is my precious daughter

I am such a stupid sucker for Gia's shit
they were whatever on Micha but I loved them on Garie
the shark teeth were my favorite part of the character design
Yeah I don't think your tastes are invalid or anything but she was just so expressive and fun for me

Garie being a rotten bitch was just fun to see her interact with people though
but I couldn't find anything solid about her to like other than being fanservice the character and slutty
she's okay
like
I wasn't all that fond of cag aside from her fighting style
it's a good aesthetic
7/10 no glasses or goggles or safety glasses or anything
<@102691114762371072> isn't this like, your shit
I like how shirabe looks like she's more like 17 here

Then you've got a power complex and are not in the majority of the audience
which *is possible*
unless you're being sarcastic
especially when contrasted with the tomboy's side
the other one, every single positive point is a *conditional* one that is actually partly negative
Every single bullet point is worded to be a positive feature on her side
A bit?
they clearly list an equal amount of pros and cons
this isn't biased at all no way
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>

Barbed wire pattern on her coat too
`who is she sub to`
üëÄ
that kirika collar
that was cool as hell and I'm mad they never did more of that
except for that scene early on where Akane opens up wounds for fighter jets to shoot into
look if you want to watch vividred I can get you an 8 minute video from the final episode that has all the cool shit in the entire show
and it has the strike witches approach to fanservice
it's pretty mediocre
probably not
oh my god someone remembered vividred exists
I'd say if you go deep enough in R-18G on pixiv you'll find something
I don't believe it
No, I mean citation needed on her being the first
[citation needed]
her power is maximum
Shirabe is not helpful
...
I've seen it a lot
when did this image come out
the just thing to do is look for ways to fix it for everyone
The answer to solving one problem is not to shackle a group of people
Two seperate issues
You seemed to bring it up in response to the research and I don't see the point ü§î
so could anyone else deciding to start a family
they'd have to make tsubamari an actual pairing first
well

something wrong with that
is there
There was a bit of research published earlier this year that suggested it might be possible to create sperm from a woman's stem cell or skin cell
why the pink eyes though
thanks shirabe

I don't read it like that, it seems more like "how is she handling this so well"
more like she's adopting the girl
this one doesn't seem haremy, at least
Nice!
Reminds me strongly of Len, the vocaloid
I'm two episodes behind though
It's pretentious as hell but backs it up and is quite pretty
The symphogear girls aren't melodramatic enough for a revue lol
look how hopelessly in love shirabe is
Shirabe is such an enabler

I recognize Kerrik's background!
<:NononPout:454088299963875349>
Kanade does seem to have the confidence needed to walk somewhere bucknaked and still command the situation
she should wear a shirt
Airgetlam has iffy colors, given Maria's skintone, and it's just kind of blobby
Airgetlam looks worse, to me
I think it's fine aside from the dumb shoulders
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
just like Shirabe is a technological machine, thematically
She's a fairy tale jester and her gear feels right
when you pin her theming
Her design makes more sense and feels right
Well I want cheongsams too

CHRIS WITH GLASSES
I said feel warm, not be warm
when you have someone to hold hands with you can feel warm anywhere
there was artwork here that had Hibiki with long hair that had orange tips and was wearing Kanade's orange Gungnir with the spear
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I think my problem with Airgetlam, and to a lesser extent Igalima, is that they don't sufficiently look scifi enough to match the other symphogears
Okay can we not play games about trying to weave words around a moderation request? It wasn't a comment fit for this channel.
Kerrik this is sfw
Like Latooni, actually
elfnein is not a waifu she is a wonderful good hearted girl who must be protected
also *I don't lewd the elfneins*
look how long her legs are!
she looks older in that picture!
I don't know how to feel about that

why is she holding her crotch

uhhhhhh
ah, a jigglypuff
I could use a good long dream right now
good, long `dreams`
ok
you just have intentionally found parts that are a very vocal minority
the internet doesn't actually adore muscular women all that much
or anyone who looks like they're anything but a perfect idol with a perfect idol body
or muscular hibiki
or muscular maria at all

https://twitter.com/meltyeye/status/1044294349033537537
the ass shots are just to check on her healthy growth
of course
it's why she's pretending to employ a prostitute
sorry
ok
it *seems* like maria is out on the town visiting where tsubasa is gainfully employed
maria is dressed to the nines but tsubasa's in showgirl outfit
is that why she's employing a prostitute
wow and all this time I thought it was testosterone giving me strength
I guess they're performing at goddamn London Sea World now
And then it was somehow at water level with the bay?
they flew in wires in an *open air stadium*
the opening of GX was bullshit
because *someone* sabotaged the topic
you're off topic because it's not nepnep
but feeling out your personality is fine
Interviewers are forbidden from asking anything about orientation, race, gender, marriage status, children status, or anything related
I'd have a hard time not saying "I find the concept of spirit animals appropriative and exploitive of the indigenous culture"
it is 2 more butt pics of her than I have

I'd absolutely hang out with Fine
what complete nerds
not sure any are my type
hm





the tassels would get dirty all the time and get caught in things
hibiki's would get annoying
hoodies that show cleavage don't make much sense
Maria's looks good aside from the absurdly open neck
N from me but it's a clever concept
ehhhh
<:papikaGun:304122221868220426>
it's a yugioh 5ds joke
Oh my god just realized that Maria is reading the Apple book because of the G song
Hibiki no don't tug that rug
Symphogear brought to you by Level 5
She looks like she belongs in a kids toy anime

Anyway as Re: Zero showed us, authorial intent isn't really all that important
I just see the screens on twitter <:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>

https://twitter.com/conamaru/status/1045737350574161920
Oh hey it's the best anime ever
Most people don't
Or nonbinary
Because the authors do not understand the concept of being trans
Despite clearly not being in every way
Counterpoint: da Vinci is also canon male
A painter has no control over what someone sees
The consumer is the one who decides how the character exists in the world they're shown
They're gay mascots, despite being declared not gay
See bert and ernie
But the point is that it doesn't matter what the author intent is, only what perception is
A crossdresser character got claimed by the trans population of Japan to the point where the author retconned it and rolled with it
Yeah
I know, that's why I didn't call you out
I prefer hiyama screaming
The more anime you consume the better it is
Shirobako

Perhaps you'll get to see it on her next bday
Or get ideas? <:zeldathink:437701753656573962>
and the actual reason behind her looking like Arturia, uhh........
Her entire design is a marketing stunt to get F/SN fans to play Fate/Extra to find out why Saber had a slutty dress and tits
but because it's very contextual
I hate her design
I wouldn't know about that, but the glasses are nice
<:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>

As a reminder, "best girl" conversations are discouraged here because the idea that someone is best implies that everyone else's favorites are lesser and that they're wrong on some level for having those favorites - it just builds up a lot of bad blood for a minimum of benefit. The results of popularity contests are interesting to look at but should not be held up as a measurement of quality of character.

I'm not implying you're trying to push that, or something, the phrasing of the poll just bugs me.

so it was *weird* when she showed up
and she was invented like 3 years before rwby vol 1
and her callsign was emerald night
who was a thief
I had someone who was basically a seafoam green haired pacific islander
yeah I guess
I'm weak for emerald considering she's *so close* to a very treasured RPG character of mine in design

germany hasn't copyrighted the syllables
homonym?
uh
as everything is either in english or translated to english and √ü isn't an english letter
there's merit to saying it's weiss and not wei√ü

it's not actually a german name since there's not actually a germany
I mean
gynoids are the highest form of life

It might be best to move this to <#377148557796442134> at this point
that said RWBY definitely does have a good and evil thing going here
that's true enough
yeah
regardless of her being happy about it
Her evil actions were important to the plot
`(in a film, novel, or play) a character whose evil actions or motives are important to the plot.`
she's a sympathetic antagonist but that *is still a villain*
Miss, and the presence of grey in the world doesn't really affect dividing literary characters between protagonists and antagonists
that's how it works
you're a villain until you leave the villain team

it's actually gundam GP-03 Dendrobium Orchis thank you very much
but someone who has seen 3 episodes would understand that something is very wrong with what they thought
you gave it context by labelling them
I would have figured out some things with what you gave me after like episode 2
It's not like people just forget what they read and see
What if you start watching the series
Three isn't that long ago, most people don't follow every season
I feel like the overlap in people who would visit this server and want to watch it is p big
<@400844698140409856> I'm not saying you  made a wrong call by posting it but consider if this is quality enough to post and potentially majorly spoil someone who hasn't watched the show yet

2b has an actual character
She cares but is also a bitch about it
2B is almost acidic in disposition, giant contrast
She's too bubbly
Just doesn't work for me
traditionally it's pistachio, vanilla, cherry
it refers to chocolate, vanilla, strawberry in the US generallly
perhaps closer to italy it's more obvious
at least, in the US
just so few people know that neapolitan *doesn't* traditionally mean brown, white, and pink
the original neapolitan was green white and pink
neapolitan was an interesting choice because it arguably is about gear color rather than hair

don't read a synopsis of it ideally
diebuster should be seen but uh
Should symphogear have more consequences? Yeah. Should it pick the consequences that just drag the girls over coals of suffering? I don't think it should really go that direction much after s1, it just made a conscious decision to not be emotional torture porn.
Symphogear's lack of consequences is a problem but it was pretty indicitive of her power and it was a little evangelion homage
I think it was fine

no I agree
Ganbaruby
it's more like putting blinders on a horse or something
The song shows it wasn't like, total mind control to the point of remotely piloting her or rewriting her mind
you asked where the meme came from??
(it's not, some of it does count as it was in fact Miku's desires)
even if that were true
she murdered hundreds of people in an attempt to get bikki to stay in her life
She is there for moral support ok

they all look the same but they all look good

symphogear is bombastic, Starlight is artsy
Not in a bad way, it's just
It's just *way more pretentious* than symphogear
also the fighting is choreographed to the music
battle songs
rather than
it's a musical
Starlight's songs are all custom fit to the fight and scenario
The only similarity is that music is playing during both
fundamentally different
it's
I don't think the way Starlight does combat is really anything like Symphogear
it's probably healthier this way
honestly
but not buff
hella fit, yeah
because you don't see them work out and they're *definitely* not that buff
I didn't notice they were the girls from revue though tbh
I'm not sure they'd like it

right
pink, green, and brown
why not use the real colors
if you're going to refer to the fis trio as neopolitan ice cream
did someone say anouki

kanade's going to be mad when XV revives her from the dead
`why are carol and miku falling over`
that's a good outfit swap
She weighs one hundred fifty kilograms and fires two hundred dollar, custom-tooled cartridges at ten thousand rounds per minute.  It costs four hundred thousand dollars to fire this weapon...for twelve seconds.
That move is actually possible pretty sure
even at the largest size, it's tricky
<a:HCxSK_gif:405742182344032256>
imagine it 4 times smaller
it's already hard to make out
<a:HCxSK_gif:405742182344032256> this is like a quarter body shot
yeah, it'd merely be a terrible emote
but if someone wants to push for it, the discussion can be had in <#336299268107403274>
I'm uncomfortable with having a teenager's ass as an emote
shirabe uses a database

https://twitter.com/_RegisterSIX/status/1143724137245892608
I'm a little confused how she's supposed to be doing that because typically it only works because you're holding the straw in your mouth, providing a counterforce for it's tendency to spring away from you
I mean, it's fine as a material, but I couldn't even jokingly say "they're better"
Chris isn't the girl who left her old life to defend her parent's dream of filling the world with healing music, she's a gremlin who's always eating and getting mad at others for being romantic
my main problem with the 4komas and other comics compared to the source is that characters are reduced to their most comedic virtues and little else

and not merely because she saved Hibiki's life, but her cry to not give up living deeply affected her and how she went about life
neither Tsubasa nor Hibiki would be who they were without her
Serena is a motivation more than a character, but Kanade is a legit side character whose presence is a core element to 1/3 of the modern gear cast
that's enough to get a sense of her style and character, unlike Serena
she's in minute+ long flashbacks at several other points in s1
She's around a lot more than the first episode

the moe anime boom did happen in the middle
everything is flat colored, straight lined, little to no smearing
2000-2007,2008 is the worst period of animation history imo - even the 70s have more charm to them
I had this conversation with someone
yes
blood is the least important qualification to be a family member
and I wish Symphogear would be more shojo than it is in terms of art style
it is very shojo

shirabe does not know the meaning of too much kiri

everything he designs or redesigns has the same "feel"
Katoki has been designing robots for like 40 years and in the last 20 his designs have largely homogenized
anyway it doesn't really use recycled unicorn parts
being a tiny facetious but it's pretty much the truth
I am
the last huckbein after all the others were blown up for looking too much like gundams
Katoki has been able to draw exactly one robot since 2006
I mean, I don't blame you for making that mistake
no
piece of mary sue shit
fuck Ing by the way

it's a limitation of the saucenao service
probably too many lookups but idk
yeah, I can understand the different perspective
Obviously doubleposting art isn't the best, but if you're just here to get a source, you're probably not going to scroll back to see all the messages you missed before posting it. 

I don't want people thinking that by posting art in here and sharing it while looking for the source, they're giving the impression that they're incompetent online or inferior in some way, so could you avoid dropping implications of the sort when attempting to help in the future?
<@252548554453811202> thank you for your attempt to be helpful, but using this channel to source material is an okay use for it!! Sakimori did write the bots and added a bunch of features in the integration to make accessing saucenao easy and fun for everyone and if you ever made a feature, you'd know how satisfying it is to use it.
ty for your hard work <:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>

reposting a few for source check
That's not kosher with me
Because the point of such a channel would be to post unsourced art
Adhoc group chats are also an option
With discretion and moderation
This isn't my server, it's our server
This was much better than coming to me for a Decision, for the record
Not entirely but "we don't need the function to not source art" really isn't the worst case in the world
seems reasonable

generally though if someone's butt's hanging out or something better safe than sorry
and don't worry about links going back to NSFW galleries, you're not responsible for that
it's pushing nsfw territory but it's fine
this is miku incarnated into one of those rock people from the misery manga
thanks!

she checks pixiv and a few other sites like deviant art, the biggest gap she has is twitter
shirabe doesn't check boorus
see? people just. Know.
THATS SO GOOD

perhaps the only cagli picture that doesn't feel like it needs to be nsfw
https://twitter.com/hinaki_yz/status/1235324050194534407
but it's also garbage
I'd argue Infinite Stratos comes close to fitting
that maria one's been in the works for months
you haven't done anything wrong but just be aware of the bot's limits
visqi sometimes posts pieces of their collages before the full banner's done
also if you want to post a lot of images from the same artist consider jii_skip
it's a bad use of her bandwidth and it's... I mean, just part of the image
I'm actually going to request that you not just post image fragments in this channel, like some of the visqi clips above
yeah that's the only part of the image I don't like

ngl the first thought I had was "Tsubasa just ate something super sour"
very imaginative though
this does beg the question 'why is she geared up right now'
is dragon kanade in a gear? does her skin just look like that? if it's a gear why is she geared up right now
this fucks with me a lot
apparently
ryuko + peach = panty
it almost feels like a different character
I can see why artists keep them on though
oh these are quite nice
ryza!
kirika who never found her shirabe

also gomen for 6am typo of your name
it's okay!! I know you've been other places for a while
jii_skip is good for lots of stuff from the same artist or comic pages
rany we also decided that jii_skip was being overused and was being unfair to artists, if shirabe gets overloaded we just have to deal with that
here is okay!!
yeah more thought has been put into it ~~and complaints from live-shitposting users~~
even with the sourcing overload
sfw/nsfw are better places
ummm how many you thinking of dumping? short answer is no, I just want to know what's going on

oh that's what you meant
you see both words in things like android or gynecology
androgynous contains both
gyno means female or feminine
or masculine
andro means male
andro as in masculine
yeah I think the emphasis on the pectorals makes it more andro than normal
~~that said you're looking for 'otter'~~

outside of that episode I'm not 100% convinced Maria and Chris ever actually talk to each other
they didn't and I think it's kind of a bad ep
marichris have nothing in common except for one AXZ episode that pretended they shared similarity

Chris is really cute
truly a waste of a good choker
i love her
just guys that scream/sing I guess
I thought this was a SRW reference but I don't think this cast list has ever existed
interesting to pair the alchemists with suits, when it's the autoscorers who were intentionally themed to suits
yeah it's a good one
https://twitter.com/foshymooo/status/1301542599006629889?s=19
yes
but 1st movie is interchangeable
the movies are a seperate universe
no, not really? but kind of?
It's okay, I just disagree it's important
~~It cut a sidestory that gets brought up like once in strikers and has no other impact~~
~~I don't agree~~
it's completely replaceable with movie
first season TV isn't really worth watching for any reason other than historical interest
yeah, just treat all the movies as one AU and the shows as another, with minimal difference between events of the first two
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Seperate, yet completely carry over all character and mechanical designs of the movies, and not of the shows
the only change that makes it 'make sense' is the fact they cut out the one unneeded plotline of As
except for the fact that 3 and 4 are sequels to them
movies 3 and 4 are *very clearly* sequels to 1-2
I mean then you could just say the commentary track is non-canon...
movies 1-4 are all same AU
the in-universe movie thing is just a theory isn't it
it does a better job of telling it
I generally recommend watching first movie *instead* of first season
going from movies to strikers will give you animation quality whiplash though so
Reflection and Detonation aren't canon to Strikers though
so is second really but less so

If you don't want to have the bot source them for various reasons that's fine, in that case just mention the artist in the future <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
but at least one needs credit
if you post one, and the bot sources it, it's fine to skip subsequent pieces obviously done by the same person
The golden rule is everything should be sourced
they don't all look the same style
<@!161155855524298752> can I ask why you were skipping? Were they all drawn by the same person?

there's concept art, it essentially involves seperating layers of her hair, rolling one layer up and fixing them as buns and then wrappping another layer over it to make it smooth

I already mentioned vivid???
even if they're only 19 or 22
yeah, that's because everyone who's over 17 years old in shounen is an old veteran
if you want to include manga I'm sure there are other older magical girls
force isn't an anime
japanese women are getting taller but their average height is still only 149cm
because japan
she feels taller because everyone else is tiny
Tsubasa's 167
Maria's only 170
they're all pretty short
you don't have to be that tall to be the tallest
Strikers is 6 years after the *main events* of As, not the epilogue
she's 15 in A's epilogue and 19 in Strikers
she does hit 23 in vivid but I haven't watched it so I don't know if she actually really counts as a magical girl in it
nanoha's only 19 in strikers
not counting the apple flashback at the start of G
well
by the time you see maria on screen the first time she's already 21
one of the oldest magical girls in anime history
they look like they could be 23
that's such good dmjii

oh that's fucking weird
just establishing that kanade's been very relevant to XDU as a whole
I mean, I'm not saying it needs a different name
it's a big deal but her not being in it isn't... not being in XDU
LS is a plot thread only like 9 months old
she was the first one to get a duo relic and kanadeverse is alchemistverse
Kanade's been involved in XDU since the start
what does (K) mean
Tesla's holding that over edgebikki's head
She is dead but is possible to bring back
or eleklied or whatever
I feel when they inevitably revive AU Miku they might give her a gear
I'm not entirely sure we'll get AU kanade

The axz that doesn't happen because no one stops ver
At best you'd get her being a wreck who tries to be a hero out of nothing other than guilt
Miku isn't that kind of person
It was less her aspiration, and more just the kind of person she was to help everyone
But it's not like that was her 'dream'
Her motivation is centered around herself and those close to her
Miku isn't a hero and never has the motivation of a hero
No, I don't see why she would
She did promise to come back alive, even if it killed her
I mean I think it was her plan the whole time to get hit by the beam

She's wearing heels
Looks like she'd be about 172 without hat or heels
Dunno if you're going by cup size instead though
No, but Carol is almost certainly bigger in terms of size
But no "high leg leotard so high cut you can see tsubasa's pubic bones"
They were still body suits of course
I like s1 designs for just being outfits instead of going in hard on sex appeal
Well, axz finale I guess

Literally or metaphorically
Draw your own conclusion
Well to be exact there was a bondage gear picture shortly after a Chris/fine picture
Axia definitely did Chris fine art but I don't have it on hand
It's not, since Chris is wearing the s1 bondage gear
I mean considering axia's shipped Chris with Fine before it makes sense
Letting your hair down means stop putting on pretentions and facades and act casually and more true to how you feel
Yeah having "hair down" has additional meaning when it comes to women
Hate how rp accounts never give credit
But the tail is definitely the serena
Similar
I'm guessing this is an upgrade from later in the series
The huckebein is so close to being a Gundam that for almost 10 years srw stopped using the design out of fear of lawsuit or something
Idk if you like the huckebein how far are you, really

But the pictured mech is one most Gundam fans are unaware exists or pretend it doesn't, since it's from the live action movie
I can't wait for hibiki to outshine the protagonist with an interesting character arc- wait this sounds familiar
I can live without Symphogear Destiny
no why

But final fantasy 15 is like the 40th game so
Yeah
Fyi I wouldn't really think about it in terms of "part" 1 and 2, they're about as related as most final fantasies
MY BABY
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
22 is year of the tiger
that's Gundam Heaven's Sword
I just realized how good a joke this one is

oh my god
the persona she goes to school in is the one people draw the most
I want to see Chris as Akane but as like, trash gremlin Akane
she's super talented and is one of my favorite symphogear artists
kiraki's actually a woman! She does cosplay and has done phara and leiur and stuff
Sure is neat Shirabe got added to genshin

<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
Garie is Maria yes
And she keeps basically stalking her
Every autoscorer is paired with a girl or girls, phara is the counterpart to basa
I think that's why I really like those early moments
I'd rather have human characters than easily likeable ones
Who she is in gear is who she is because of her scars as much as her successes
The tsubasa we saw back then was a generic blushing shojo character
I'd like tsubasa less if kanade lived
<:catsip:656050349399998464>
Well to be a good opposite they gave the girl with the least personality the autoscorer with the most
Yeah hibiki was carol
Imo it's the coolest Easter egg in gear
Matching the girls they were rivals of
GX album covers
3_skip
In her hat?
Y'know how all 4 autoscorers are visible in carol's xv transformation for 2 frames?
Micha is dmjii's counterpart
It's definitely Maria's rival
She goes after hibiki and Maria shows up to fight garie
They're wearing the axz summer song uniform so this is probably after their bonding moment
Looks like they're just hanging out

F/SN was pretty far up there on her being a homicidal monster, in love or not

I feel like that's a little tortured of a stretch but I do see what you're going for
I feel like nu is the most unkirika character lol
Who knows if they like it but they definitely like having furry clients
Yeah I finally found some others after scrolling enough
Or a furry artist?
That's debatable but I was more getting at drawing that doesn't make someone a furry
Sometimes people just want to meme about weed cat
There are other reasons to draw anthro
I don't think Ashley is a furry?

carol's dad and ver pre-villain reveal are the same basic character design
but elfnein is worth it
nia is my sole and only regret for playing in jp
it is a true statement yet without value
this is like saying g would have been different if maria smoked weed all the time
https://mobile.twitter.com/ninaryo/status/1318847579740762113
so it's quite the delicate balance
the unfortunate part is anime fight pacing dictates that if you try to go all out at once you never win
it is worth noting he's two thirds god
Hibiki really has no way to resist Ea
gil would destroy hibiki if he went all out but he's definitely arrogant enough to not start at max gear, so hibiki has a chance
the cooler bikki
shows of force only work as an establishing moment for a character, never in a climax

A lot of these "artists" refuse to share their models
Maybe if they were supposed to be test tube babies
I don't think it's a better look personally
G gave the impression that Shirabe only had agency because Fine permit it
Pretty sure fine wins if she wants to
I think having the irises have a gradient from the inside out would probably be a better way to go
I'm not digging it personally

homura a classy bitch
Cags would probably sound like you're swallowing a hurl since the g is unvoiced and all but silent
it's a good shirabe, though it's one niyun retweeted from drawing several years ago
you'd be more likely to get an akb crossover with delta, and considering most of those voice actors are retired, that's saying something
I've kind of gotten the impression kawamori isn't particularly impressed with the satelight works that aren't his
The Zohar belt buckle ...
<:blobcatsmack:575405442176385064>
It's definitely based on s1, check her gear
Yeah in z they just give you a hard 3 turn cool down (reduced by one with the falcon)
If you're seeing turn 7 or 8 in most srw games you're not particularly good at the game or are intentionally sandbagging
I love the X in srw z even if you only get to fire the cannon like once a map - assuming you can even see the moon
But she's also not a badass
Presea is not... Not a badass?
Hmmmm
Too much white for me

More homura please
Sigma orbis is so dope and is one of my major gripes with W
I dropped out near the start of the third game
Inazuma's first two cours are great but it starts to drag as they get into the swing of adapting one game a year (meaning over 4 cours each)
So you have 10cm robots teaming up with saint seiya soccer players
It's a crossover between danball senki W and the at the time current season of inazuma eleven
God I still can't believe the movie exists
It's good but the use in W brings it down a bit
Idk of I like the mk 2 better
There's something so satisfying about shouting "hissatsu function"
At least s1
It's no bullshit my favorite proxy battle shounen period
Yeah it's LBX
An amusing plot
Well
And narratively it's basically Gundam built fighters but with a good plot
It leans into the toy look and does great
You should try danball senki
Shout out to the best level 5 Gundam
Yeah that's probably the best age design

It'd probably be cool if it wasn't designed to do what it did

yes if your objective is to make a character like an action figure it can work
and I mean, looking like paint vomit can suit a vtuber, but I feel the rules are different for narrative characters
~~and the tasteless color use~~
I feel like there's a game this would be a great design in, it's just not fire emblem
source is obari. obari drew it.

she's interestingly not a 'cute' character
for <#357682999300718592> there is a soft rule where users are asked to please wait at least an hour after the last fan creation was posted before they post their own, just to make sure people get a fair exposure

Kanade was billed as one of the two main characters before s1 came out
possible
I'm expecting it, if we get alchemists that defect to join song
but
you joke about ignite
I think it's the less likely option but I wouldn't discount it
I would not expect a movie out of XDU
10 minute ovas
yeah, I could see that
while the animation quality has gone up, I don't like the revised character designs they started using in G
I'm actually scared of the idea of a s1 remake movie
yes
I just struggle to see music-based spinoffs
spin-offs, yes
she'd either be ascended, disabled, or convinced by miku to retire and be *happy*
right
symphogear would fall flat on its face as an idol anime
but that might just be wishful thinking
I privately expect hibiki will be unable to fight after the season for some reason
"you already know what symphogear is, here's more of it, watch it"
anyway the message is pretty clear I think
yeah, it's pinned in this channel
what japan calls these teaser videos
promotional video
most PVs aren't good trailers imo
I bet he stays dead
if he dies
so
killing genjuro off actually makes it possible to have a strikers-like symphogear series where one of the gears is the commander
anyway
yeah, everything's fair here
but
I mean, symphogear is no stranger to bad writing
ehhh
that said I think there's still a 40% chance that the only deaths are new characters
exactly
he's the easiest to kill, narratively, while still having a big viewer payoff
I'm privately betting genjuro goes down if they want to establish something as high stakes and give the gears determination
I'm kind of expecting a repeat in XV - kind of meh writing but they execute it just fine for everyone to shrug and go "yeah okay it was more symphogear"
but it at least was executed adequately
I think axz's problem is it's just a dull plot with nothing going on outside of select hype scenes
now, I fully expect they're not the end-all be all, but I just am not going to be happy with *just* them
"you may have defeated what was basically lucifer, a perfect being at the head of the organization, and his most able underlings, but now you must face...! ...disgraced scientists and lab experiments"
that's dramatically a terrible step
they're *explicitly* the b- or c-team here
but I do need more than "the dregs of last season's organization do bad things"
I don't need custodians
I give good odds the secret final antagonist will also be a singer
yeah
pretty high
in japan
the anime is made to sell music
because
the protagonists are always going to sing only music genres that are popular and profitable in japan
And "advertised" was a strong word, more like "notified"
Haven't seen that practice in a while though
So when you write up a schedule it can be less messy to use negative hours with a single date
It's because every anime that isn't for kids airs between 10 pm and 4am
I've legit seen anime advertised as airing at "-1:00 July 6" when the air on the 5th before
We'll go into detail on the spoiler structure as we draw near xv, but expect lines to be drawn pretty clearly
I think the days of 6 hour speedsubs have long passed
If we have a dedicated sub group on it which symphogear might be big enough to get we could see 2-4 day times yeah
I don't think more than half of the blame can be given to kaneko
I think a lot of it is the director change between s1 and G
I think it's the director
I don't think it's kaneko
but this cast has to just be a smokescreen for the actual drama, or it'll be a whimper of a finale
XV isn't doomed by any means
XV has a cast of 6 veterans who have been through 3-4 world ending crises
in G, you had grounds to work with Fine's leftovers, because Section 2 was still getting its act together in its new role, with a changed world
this is supposedly "the culmination to a 5 season series"
"The followup to AXZ"
this isn't
but even if they did
and I don't think I agree
you say that as if G's antagonists worked for the season
I mean
Carol fueled hers with memories but I don't think you have to burn memories to do all alchemy
actual alchemy
I think they were mostly powered by
used on random civilians to establish them as a scary threat
mind flay's going to be like autoscorer drain kiss
we'll discuss it, we've got a month
but XV content's going to be coming hot and fast and will probably come before subs sometimes
if you want
"Promare spoilers"
and say
you can spoiler tag it
oh, put that in the art channel
before it's subbed
for example, we'll start getting fanart of an episode
For now the art channels are fine, but we'll have to discuss stuff for the actual airing
hm
I'm sure that's reductionist but I'm also sure they followed the same playbook when coming up with the designs

I'm sure that's reductionist but I'm also sure they followed the same playbook when coming up with the designs
tall domineering leader, quirky crazy lady, tiny petite girl
the girls are basically a repeat of the alchemists
I mean
It's ok you can pirate with the rest of us
Kind of a middle finger to tsubamari fans though
I actually would love that end
~~in the afterlife~~
it's solidly ok
`I'm glad I'm not the only one who wasn't impressed with the 45 second clip`
yay
in fact they'll never explain anything
but they'll never actually explain that it was happening at the same time as the series finale
and then 4 years later we get a movie explaining what was going on while bikki was having her mind trip
looking at tableaus of her life
the last two episodes of symphogear are just bikki sitting in a metal folding chair
solo just imagine
also like 2 eps in they get philosopher's stones
Bikki dies and he picks up her legacy
The true end of xv
every anime fan needs to watch shirobako at the point they start asking "how does it end up like this"
I expect I'll be skipping the OP by the second or third ep that has it
I don't really like it at all
but I really want a symphogear gaiden
I know I'll just get a zesshoushinai
I want an actual OVA please
aside from the hajimari no babel/axia no kaze callouts
the activation chants are probably the most blatant in every full DMJii duet
if it's integral, it's <#336310266654490624>
then <#377148557796442134>
is the symphogear content tertiary? if it is, spoilertag it and warn that it has symphogear spoilers for [relevant season]
it depends
well
probably <#336310266654490624>
no
rather than "THIS IS THE SPECIAL ATTACK"
she should be using her weapons to make physical contact with enemies as a default gunkata kind of thing
I hate that it got an attack card
red hot kick
maybe that's included in the docs, maybe it's not
publishing a theory is different than publishing a patent-like explaination of the procedure
also they've still never really clarified if anyone besides Ryoko had the ability to modify fragments into a full Symphogear System, for the record
the fragment of dainsleif they had is unuseable or disintigrated now
oh, wait, the question was about miku getting an ignite
both SSJ and Dainsleif are destroyed
How much of that is wishful thinking at a tragic final season solo
~~it's just kayano ai singing "haapi baasudei tuu yuuuu"~~
shirabe missed one of her buzzsaw attacks
clearly it's a reference to her crippling wedding dress addiction
I must be remembering it wrong then
played OOC as an ED
Maria's barely counts even
Elfnein has done it about 15 times now
I mean they can fix gears
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Go to bed jim
It keeps them from having to add a linebreak for the next day on timeslot schedules
in the past it was that anyone degenerate enough to watch non-kids anime could manage to stay up that late and everything
rewatching those two AXZ episodes kind of reminded me that nobody in the show *really* mattered except hibiki
highly doubt it though
I
that would be wonderful
kinda the whole point of the curse
we are never getting those translated
I love that show
But it's definitely obvious that when the industry moved to digital animation, they weren't really ready to take advantage of the tools
same!
visually speaking
which, as a warning, might be one of the absolute ugliest periods of anime
it's very mid 2000s anime
or at least that she's most stated she desires
I kind of don't want Kirika to find it out because like, it's the thing that represents her shitty childhood, and I think it's a more healthy story to tell viewers that you can accept and move forward with a shitty childhood instead of trying to "fix" it, which you'd symbolize doing by giving Kirika the one thing she's lost that she desires the most
I don't think I'd want that storyline, but it's one we could get
maybe kirika finds out her real birthday
yeah, spoiler will do for now
If we have actual people who have seen an episode of XV, it might be time to open up the raw discussion channel
Hmmmm
can't wait for the final episode of xv where hibiki kills madoka
I think you're in for a bit of a shock when it plays in the show then
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
Scroll up to millhi's tweet
"intentionally played on the radio as a promotion"
"leaked"
Though symphogear likes to play different
OP frequently is the ED of the first episode
lmao, could be
this channel has been waiting for over a year for its time to come

and now it probably never will

;-; <:HisoneSalute:442506729893265418>
I am 100% sure they wouldn't have done that scene if they knew a sequel was possible
~~fuck you aquarion evol~~
But also every previous one
Genjuro actually being a custodian the whole time would be one of those moves where they don't only ruin this season
I'm 95% sure genjuro has gag strength
I doubt it
on second thought I'll pin it in <#336310266654490624> so no one has to wander into big spoilers

I love how gx and axz have destroyed all our faith in the show writers
Black lantern kanade
Lmao
and then they were like
I feel it was more they launched XDU with the promise of it tying into AXZ
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I guess
bikki befriending a ghost
you didn't
which
the references didn't even make you feel like you missed anything
though I think that might be one too
The antikythera gear they plug in tiki
the 3 seconds they stared at the gear
yes
also, I feel that remaking s1 with G-XV artstyle would not be great
the director isn't good enough
I actually really hope it's not a remake of s1, because uhhh
A multi-timeline thing would make getting new people into symphogear harder
ugh
midsummer in antarctica
And I don't think they'd say "midsummer" and give us
we got winter designs for all characters
that said
I mean, it might not be an eva reference - ancient shit in antarctica is at least as old as lovecraft
while I don't think it'll be val verde, the southern hemisphere did occur to me
much more likely to be in winter than to be 9 months later in a snowy midsummer
september
AXZ also ended in like
The official character designs are definitely winter outfits and winter uniforms
I think some of this will be a flashback
Some of the synopsis stuff mentioned midsummer and everyone, including the translator, was confused about it
for an episode
the comment in that AXZ interview up there with Stefan makes me realize they *know* how risky it is to give any guy airtime at any point
I'm not sure they would have
ooh, I wonder
another symphogear song
why wouldn't you think it was just
why would you assume that was from the gatcha
"okay this gear's good enough"
"well we said we were going to, so I guess we have to"

If you all want to spoiler tag discussions about an episode that just dropped in the last day, that's probably a nice thing to do and I encourage it, but no one is under any obligation to
Used twice, fired never
<@115223143102152705> silly, Chris can't snipe
Just noticed Chris has a revolver in the CD art
1, really
2 hours
that said the subs will be out in like
https://nyaa.si/view/1156611
it's from the S2CA, you can see her scar glowing
the gif is G
<@115223143102152705> japan
it'd be *really nice* if you spoiler tagged
again you don't have to but if you do watch raws in the hour or two before the actual subtitled broadcast goes up
+more hours for upload
rip rabbit
yeah I'm excited for theirs too but
it's not symphogear without heavenrend
neat
whaaaaaat
horriblesubs will rip it and post it on nyaa
they'll be on free after a week I think?
<@!99158582326497280> commie's pretty dead
the invite link is in the rules channel
and finally they're using a *lot* of s1 BGM, though I think it's been redone slightly
then you have the transformation
was a callback to Hibiki's Zesshou in s1
yeah, Chris calling bikki out for being a hero
3) we open the school shot with the lydian theme, something we've heard a bunch in s1 and almost never since
2)song of the heart is a *huge* deal
1) we open with a discussion of Fine
okay let's see
even just throwaway lines of dialogue
a lot of s1 callbacks
there were
s1 didn't get much exposure in the west when it was airing
most people in here probably never saw that
you all started talking about budget on your own
we were talking about the transformation
y'all are conflating budget with art style
when you watch a lot of magical girl shows I feel the more unique transformations stand out in your head more than the shiny ones
that's one of them
there's a few really obvious ways to make scarves cool
yeah I don't buy that
it's just... tenuous
I'm not dismissing it
like
it's a dj pose
we've had piano/dj control consoles for 5 seasons straight
not sure that's a callback
I couldn't really read it very clearly at the time but it seemed legible
I thought it was fine
that's a really neat concept that I hope they really use well
Elfnein can alchemy through the gears thing
I'm *super* excited about the whole
Yo related to Kerrik's post
I already counted miku
that drops it below 5
yeah I guess I could see them having a dual transformation
and that's not even including the new villains
as a side note, if we get 45 seconds of transformation for all girls, that's a little over 5 fucking minutes of stock footage goodness <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
https://spykemh.tumblr.com/post/186101128363/discovery-with-hibikis-transformation
don't go pinging people hours later
like, if it drifts there, fine
Armados *please* stop dragging people in to have off-topic conversations
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
something's not vibing and, okay
you're just having a mood/taste thing
I can tell you
okay well
oh I see yes
I scrolled up and didn't see it
do you want to actually discuss it or do you just want to be negative
uh, ok
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
do you mind moving this discussion
Gungnir's both the spear of Odin and the lance of Longinus, the roman soldier
Gungnir's proof of that
he is
It's possible Argetlaim is really just Argetlaim and the bio reference was actually a nod to Wild Arms
thanks japan
I couldn't really make it out
I think
I liked the satellite cannon punch
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
aside from the hexacombo attack Maria just jobbed didn't she
oh that's true
welcome
yeeee
and that's all it took
I think the point is that *people thought it was*
I don't think it's the same spear that stabbed jesus
*this is still Kaneko fusing relics*
but
I'd argue that yes, Gungnir was associated with the lance of longinus' deeds and they got conflated
Anyway!
yeah, though I don't think she attacked with it
attached to her fist
<@173112001684439040> she busted one out in X-drive in G
truly a mystery
and yeah genjuro fukken ready
https://twitter.com/RevolverUnit/status/1147791151434354689?s=20
~~just sub from ear~~
why you have to curse them like that
`first release`
is he credited as enki or something, I missed the part where he was named
oh
?
are torrents fine
<:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
...
my favorite is the bagpipes one
I think it's my second favorite intro, better than G-beat, if we're just talking about intro
all I know is I enjoyed hibiki going getter-3
XV's transformation sequence rivaled Nanoha's movie releases
and I think the official manga releases
that's just crunchyroll, yes
I'm so tired of people going "yeah that's bad but I still love Ver when he's here because lol sugita!!"
I thought I saw the Earth but I guess I wasn't paying enough attention
I think that's what made me assume it was on the moon
Wasn't it the far side of the moon that lit up
I mean the opening cutscenes was basically a frontier type control room on the moon
Bokurano level power scaling
This is like
Or maybe they can manipulate the universe on a quantum informational level, basically reprogramming it
<:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
Or is using metauniverse laws we can't see
I think the explaination is that the beam is so powerful it disconnects the space it hits with the ordered universe
Reminds me a lot of the final act of asura's wrath
I am very excited to see the girls fight an enemy who operates from outside the universe and it's laws
On that note though
My main point is if you're hung up on it and need to find an explaination the rest of the season will be rough
This also isn't the first anime to try to use it, I know I've seen sub absolute zero values in diebuster before
The fact that it's an impossible temperature that violates the very concept of temperature is sort of the point
They immediately say something about "extra-reality laws" or something (probably will be a recurring theme)
Regarding the temperature thing in ep 1
the girls are seasoned vets and screen time is precious gold in a climax season
I'd rather they skip the training montage honestly
yeah
There's always attack cards
apparently symphogear's opened the can on metaphysics being in play - not quesitons about the soul, but a set of rules external to the ones our universe operates on
I don't know, I'm expecting lots of fun rules breaking this season
that which is dead cannot die
`Yes - Roundabout plays in the distance`
the floating gear fragment forming a scope was pretty neat at least
make a combined gun or something
like
~~I thought it was an oddly lazy finish to the fight~~
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
is this the red hot fakeout
I'm really expecting him to get killed when he does
I'm kinda glad
welcome to the xv club wfc
wouldn't 1080 just be an upscale or do they air in 1080 now
~~BD bonus feature~~
Bikki alone isn't enough if they drop the ball on the rest
XV might dethrone, might not
prior to XV, I think I thought Nanoha movie transformations were the best for non-creative transformations like Sympho s1
sure, I get it and it's a great capstone
as transformation/gattai sequences go, the zi-o thing doesn't strike me as particularly impressive if you're allowing it to be compared against animation
like, I don't think Adam's *that* far above alchagears
true though I think alchagears are a huge power level tier higher than the power levels symphogears (outside of X-drive) are supposed to ever achieve
it probably wasn't so he could deal with the coffin itself
Consider that some of the dialogue hints that Adam was in such a panic to get god powers before the coffin emerged on its own
Antarctica's one of Lovecraft's favorite places
I mean
So I think they'll try to get some Kanade resolution even though really she's been pretty decently resolved
Right now XV is tied more to s1 than AXZ, imo
Season 1 was referenced **heavily** this episode
I actually expect so
but if you mean shots of kanade
even if it looks like she'll be antagonist-aligned at some point
I'm still hoping for miku wearing gungnir <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
it'd be kinda like what gurren lagann did with the whole parallel works thing
a few of them are pretty cool
maybe if we're lucky we'll get XDU storylines animated in OVAs after the season's done
if what you want is your favorite characters to always get a happy ending even when their death was the only significant lasting event in the franchise, I'm afraid I can't help you
XDU works
But if what you want is Kanade interacting with people
which is a significant enough event that it changes everything
it's a universe identical to the show exept they find the gjallarhorn
which does happen
aside from the 3.5 stuff
I told you
oh, no
point is Miku wasn't there after Hibiki was ostracized
yeah I'm not actually clear on the details, you might be right

2) Hibiki's XV transformation where she has a scarf over her face is a pretty clear reference to an XDU character (typically nicknamed edgebikki) who is Hibiki from an alternate universe where Miku died at the concert
1) the Antikythera gear that powered Tiki in AXZ was retrieved by the Alchemist Trio in the XDU Season 3.5 storyline, which is the part of XDU that's been confirmed to actually be canon (and has no AU shenanigans in it)
exactly two references
there is
which is basically a dimensional door
the Gjallarhorn
It takes place in a setting identical to the series except they discover one additional relic
where they play in alternate universes all the time
if you just want scenes of kanade being alive play XDU
I'd argue that not killing off hibiki wasn't even the bad move, it was just the awful way the end sequence was handled
I see your point but don't agree with it
symphogear's so close to jumping a shark as is
please don't actually bring her back
I just want an homage or memory of her
it's mega*death* now
excuse me
yeah the plot tends ridiculous, not nonsensical
~~the body is actually Fine's corpse~~
~~Karen Zehntal~~
on the watch I've really only seen something even approaching solid from one way
is it evident
that's all far beyond the released sakurai theory concepts
everyone seems to have alchanoise and symphogears are useless vs alchanoise
that's my prediction for xv
genjuro's going to get involved in a fight, everyone's going to get excited, and then he's going to die
Hibiki is more killable than Chris
Chris is *untouchable* because she has so many passionate fans who will pretty much burn their merch and not buy any more if something happens to her
Like, let me give an example
and only if it's yes do they go forward
"is this okay monetarily"
they double check
I think they write the story
but I am saying the story is bent to satisfy it
I'm not saying it is
her arc *finished* in G
Tsubasa would have been benched 3 seasons ago in semi-retirement
If merchandise wasn't important, if having Nana Mizuki in the show wasn't more important than the actual plot
Okay look
Hibiki's story *has to end*
As someone with a yugioh avatar I think you can see how you can have a climax season that ends everything and yet still have a franchise
yeah it's the way the business works
that's kind of the point
they wrote the series around selling merchandise
yes
not XDU
sorry, AXZ
that means they get to put out like 4 more CDs
You know how XDU has so many duets?
no matter what they say
seasons 2-4 were definitely designed around selling CDs
*uhhhh*
uhhh
because this is the final season
I'm not sure they *can* kill off a user
From a marketing perspective
less impactful
just
yeah, ogawa's possible
there's nothing stopping them
Genjuro is really the only one they can kill off
for fun
he went and used the cane on children
I'll remind you
Then
"I want to be admired and worshiped and be the lord of the land"
Once his insanity was in full swing it transitioned from "I want to be a hero" to "I want to be king"
you can save the world *for the wrong reasons*
I'd argue ver was pretty firmly evil in his full revealed intent
at all
doesn't sound like a final season
That... uh
nothing in G makes the "pretend to be terrorists" part make sense
but
the only problem with Ver's motivations is none of it makes the "pretend to be terrorists" part make sense
they could have just made the XDU 3.5 chapter *all of AXZ*
like no lie
~~AXZ was pointless overall~~
AXZ crammed in so many goddamn special inserts that we only heard each character's A side a maximum of twice
I miss when I could actually like, get used to a character's theme before the show ended
speaking of which
but they're functionally the same
I mean, I think ascending into godhood is more likely than *death*
from a story arc perspective
it's the most likely besides genjuro
yeah
first is something like 30% likely, the others are sub 10
roughly in this order: Hibiki, Maria, Kirika, Shirabe
I do actually think there's a few girls who could die
I do not think Symphogear's a soulless money machine, but if money wasn't critical, I don't think we'd have 6 goddamn lead characters in a 13 episode show
Serena is a motivation
except for some select XDU players
Serena isn't a character
aside from Bikki getting the shit beat out of her
and it's designed to elicit warm fuzzies
harmonies etc
Lydian chorus at least has more meat to it
It works *terribly* as a climax to it
It works decently as an opening to G, actually
symphogear isn't really a comfortable home for slow tempo
but
these are true things
I mean I'm not here to tell you to not like it
point is it's musically simple to the point of boredom and the tempo doesn't do it favors either
it is, it's just basically a folk song and sounds really boring to me
god I hate prelati's presence in AXZ so much
I do not think Adam particularly cared about looking like the hero
except we now find out that the coffin coming out of the ice was probably a few years away at most
it sounds like it does
I mean
same place it did for Fine
He's certainly an asshole, though
because he was trying to fight whatever is about to happen
But, in the end, it's difficult to really assess how evil Adam was until XV finishes
his being not human makes the ethics a little more complex
Adam's an interesting case
Section 2 would have come and fought no matter what
because that was excessive
there's gotta be other ways that don't involve "declare war on literally everyone"
but
yeah, the phonic gain is the *only* actual thing I can think of
there's a reason a lot of Sailor Moon villains wear BDSM gear
And actually, breaking it down in more magical girl terms, Fine could possibly represent one of the opposite poles of a traditional magical girl - the lost innocence, the implicit corruption of sensuality
I actually think the nudity did add to her menace
I mean, as a lesbian, I needed Fine being casually nude <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
if you think tsubasa's s1 chest was "relatively small" I feel sorry for any girl you date
hahahaha
from wherever they left to
I think the corpse is going to somehow cause the other ones to come back
why are you assuming they won't
"let's have a super ominous sequence that oozes malice, wait gotta have a jiggle"
why satelight
forgot about the 3 frame jiggle
ugh
here you go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6pUTyd_0aQ
yeah
everything else was just people using toys from Season 1
the only thing they added to it was Frontier
G's "world development" was *super narrow*
I think it's because they wanted to expand the world
she had memory rejection
she never had body rejection
for the record
so yeah, she had to go down
they expected this to be the last symphogear season and weren't sure they'd ever get another one greenlit
addressing the seasonal villain thing
she wants them to think that elfnein's magic solution will solve all their problems
she doesn't want to overpower them
?
*much easier* to steal from someone if they think you are dead
it's
there's a few things they needed to steal from SONG at that point
ah, there's something else
like, from injuries
I think she was dying
honestly?
at that time
the symphogear users lives are literally more important to her plans than her own
because uh
but she can't use that
yeah
I think she really did get the shit kicked out of her there
I do think you might be overestimating her power level
so clearly she does not agree with herself on every level and there's probably a layer of extra angst on top
the part of her she put in elfnein wouldn't be trying to stop her
If she didn't think that she should be stopped
Carol hates herself for betraying her dad's ideals but won't admit that she's doing it or that she hates that she's done it
and finally
anyway I'd argue that it was also extremely useful to have them think she was dead
in the finale she was supercharging herself by burning everything
I don't think she could overpower the 3 in ignite that easy
she had to go all out to force them to ignite and she did not want to be captured?
and she was going to die?
because... she died?
it's *possible* this was her first "primary" body change
I got the impression she didn't bodyswap all that often, if ever
which means the anime was the original production
regarding the manga, it started releasing about 2 months before the anime
they had *concepts* planned out ahead of time that they fit together like puzzle pieces
what actually happened is agematsu had a notebook full of ideas he really wanted to use and they've been slowly using them as they go along
The interviews did not state they had the plot planned out ahead of time
But I don't think it'll result in death
They're absolutely flagging that Miku's going to be a threat to people though with the ferris wheel thing
impossible
but they're making a big deal out of it being the climax season, so it's not
I feel like the story would sooner attempt to show Miku trying to live without Hibiki than Hibiki try to live without Miku - and I think killing off Hibiki is in the "more unlikely than likely" category as is
Narratively I struggle to see it
oh, and her legs are spread wide open towards the camera, too
after she has been smacked to the ground
season 1, while Chris fights Tsubasa, there's an extended shot where you get a view of Chris in the distance over Tsubasa's prone buttocks
that damn tsubasabutt in s1
anyway back to fanservice - Symphogear's got it, it's not selling it full blast like ecchi shows do, but it's not exactly quiet about it, between the increasingly skimpy Symphogears or the occasional tit or ass shot we *do* get
like "why does getting close to people hurt"
the TV show mostly just angsts about things that teenagers think about a lot
which is where the heaviest stuff is
the movie's rated R
these are qualities that were formerly seen as "refined" in classy japanese women
She has no major emotional action past episode 6, she's quiet, she's demure, and she's willing to stand in a corner for hours and look sad but pretty
Okay so the thing about Rei is she's basically a doll
it was definitely a selling force in the 90s
but
luckily it's kind of phasing out because the concept is sexist as hell
There's also the whole yamato nadeshiko thing that a design like Rei plays heavily into
just because japan puts cow udders in some shows doesn't make boobs no longer big when they're not fetish huge
also, they're so slim that they're still pretty busty
Rei's one of the best selling anime girls of all time
remaking character designs in order to satisfy foreign audiences would anger pretty much everyone who had already seen the show, ever
okay
hm
but
It's complicated, but let's go with yes
no one cared because *there was next to no market*
that'd be like trying to market American Football to sell better in south east asia
you *definitely* weren't an anime fan in the 90s
you're talking about evangelion there, right?
"trying to sell outside of japan" idea
I don't understand this
???
they do it because there's money
evangelion's probably one of the more interesting entries in anime history for its themes and what it tried to do (whether it successfully did those things and whether those things were worth doing is a different discussion) but its presence as one of the merchandising kings of anime has more to do with putting 14 year olds in latex suits
it's that you watch the kind of shows they put fanservice in
it's not that you're chasing fanservice
I think you miss the point
has more fanservice
yes
which
you probably tend to consume shows meant for your demographic
I'm saying you probably have a slanted view of japanese media
I'm not saying shows aren't worse
if you throw them all in a pile, the number of children's shows and introspective shows and various genres you probably don't watch and probably don't keep track of outnumber the romcom harem nonsense - though, perhaps, not *hugely*
that's not true
1)
not just the girls getting stripped, but stuff like Chris's transformation titty bounce, Elfnein's initial outfit, and Carol being the horniest villain in the series, even beyond Fine
It spiked in GX
alcanoise were an excuse to humiliate the girls and strip them naked on screen for the viewers
not the fact they moved to it
the problem is how they implemented it
alchemy is fine
I don't have a problem with them adding alchemy
Joe's either finished or working on it
I also think they want to set up him being eager to jump in so they can do it again later with lethal results
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Or we'll do either or both of them but the deaths will be fakeouts
Alternatively it could be the thing that breaks their morale before they rediscover/reaffirm the message of the season/series and it invigorates them
It's cliche but effective
I think someone in particular will sacrifice themselves near the end and cause the cast with broken morale to rally
hibiki, they blew all their budget and that's the only one we get <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I will destroy you
it's expensiiiiive
(this is really what the shinais are)
I'd watch SymphoGO!
man
As I understand it it caused an existential crises and they realized they lacked the capacity to enjoy symphogear at all
I think you'll probably find yourself liking symphogear again at some point but in a different way
I really hope she gets to participate in another group song for XV
Are we counting hajimari no babel
I'm sure wfc probably knows her runtime
or other apparitions
she had a lot of flashbacks
don't underestimate kanade fans
rip
joe already noted what it is
what, the table
you can also post it elsewhere but spoiler it and note "XV content"
ty
tomosato felt bad for elfnein and installed a booster seat and one of those fake driving wheels you get for toddlers to make her feel like she was helping
ye
it goes symphogear 1, 2, 3, 4, 15
o7
community drama
out of curiosity can you share some of these other concerns or are they like
is this a thing we have to take action on or
they are throwing money away and hoping more comes back to them in return
Fate is very much not taking easy money
they're going for a very high effort high expense method of trying to expand dominance
but you were arguing for *easy money*
clearly you can expand the franchise if you want
oh, I see your point
you're asking why there's *fate* adaptations?
wait
they're ads
other mobile games that don't have anime manage fine
something that can be handled without any animated content whatsoever
you go mobile game
if you want easy money
I'm just saying
and it *really* begged a continuation and people would have snapped it up
movie 4 was new content that was such a big deal that a lot of fans still argue about whether it's compromised the core theme of the entire show or not
`I am pretty sure the Madoka stuff is just a retelling in movie form`
took them 5 goddamn years
look how quickly they jumped on doing that
a new madoka series or movie would be easy money
making new animated content is not easy
they already have the mobile game to cover the easy money part
the only stuff people ever talk about are the plot aspects and tuturu
because I've never heard anyone talk about any of that
I can
yes
you cannot connect naruto and serial experiments lain and go "why aren't the marketing strategies the same"
unlike symphogear
Because steins gate doesn't fucking sell itself on girls
everyone loves personal growth and every season tries to have personal growth even if since GX it's all been arbitrary vague anime growth
well, permanently scar the character of a waifu
it's a lot trickier to permanently change the character of a waifu
I think you're still missing the point that okabe isn't a waifu
Symphogear s1 didn't have a problem traumatizing their cast because it was a one-and-done deal
I think that should be mentioned
okabe is a guy and not a central piece of merchandising
a difference there
there's uh
This is a show that sells itself on VAs, you can't really get away with benching characters too much
at least, with the current model
or it stops being financially viable
All 6 girls have to be in fighting condition and on the front lines in every season
the fact that everyone needs to be preserved to make new seasons is why no lasting consequences have happened
the fact that no one gets permanently hurt is *exactly* why symphogear needs to end
Chris' personal scars, were, tbh largely retconned away
and overcame it
Tsubasa spent two straight seasons dealing with her personal loss
if the fact that some characters are similar to other characters means they're boring, you must find the entire anime world a wasteland
I don't think so - sure, there's lots of genki characters out there, but aoi put a pretty decently unique spin on bikki
I don't think she's any worse than the rest of the main cast
Hibiki's story is on the borderline of being overtold
and I think anything that features her as a central character is fairly doomed
but you were insisting hibiki should absolutely come back
Sure
sales would start dropping
same cast
nothing different
exactly like GX-AXZ-XV
made another season
I think if they just
Anyway I think the argument was that you think they can't make a final season because it's "easy money?"
and then the rest tank
because you can only sell your first two volumes with the concert
it's a cheat
yeah that's true
every season has made more sales than the previous season
that was a "well, s1 barely made it to viability with CD, maybe we can do it one more time"
Symphogear G was *absolutely not easy money*
also yeah uh
emiya's cooking class was really well received
unlike fuckin Ms Akatsuki over here, zesshouing and walking into the command room 10 minutes later in a hospital robe
I mean Tsubasa nuking herself felt pretty in spirit - It didn't feel too cheap not having her die considering she's spending the next 3 episodes in the ICU
Ono was also main director of 5Ds
oh
the ending scene of s1 really feels like it wasn't the original written ending
I also think they decided about 3/4 of the way through making s1 that they didn't really want to copy madoka all that much after all
that's the biggest reason why the tone feels so different
anyway yeah, S1 was a different director and we've had Ono since G
yes
https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Katsumi_Ono.
he did arc v
he didn't do that arc
As long as we have the yugioh director I don't think that will happen
~~TALKING TO YOU MARIA~~
but it's something she came to terms with and you don't need 4 seasons of the same plotline
I mean, G has a few scenes to help clean it up
as a weapon she'd be exposed to death
yeah
she killed herself emotionally to deal with it
she was stuck on it
just like you have probably 98% dealt with losing a treasured pet or family member who died 2+ years ago
Tsubasa's 90% dealt with her loss at this point
This is Tsubasa refusing to heal
Again, this isn't a fresh loss
and she realized that's what Kanade would have wanted for her
Hibiki (and Miku) reminded her that life has a "forward", too
She had no purpose because she was *looking back at Kanade and the past* the whole time
She finally gets the answer she's been asking for from Kanade
because the climax of the first season involves her finally answering the question of what it means to live
Or Tsubasa continually having scenes where she talks to a Kanade who isn't there
Armados did you miss the entire extended conversation they had on the hospital roof about how much Kanade meant to both of them
she is helped over her hangups and she now has comrades
Tsubasa's been clinging to it because she had no one else in her life and she had hangups
Remember that it has *already been two years* since Kanade died
Tsubasa dealing with Kanade's death is, to me, one of the only sanely handled character arcs in the show
It's really hard to find big name VAs who are known singers *because Symphogear already hired most of them*
the biggest blockade is the cast
**but**
a next generation style of show
eventually
I agree with you that I can see
I misunderstood your comment earlier, I thought you reassuring hibiki it wouldn't be the end of the current symphgoear style of show
anyway to circle back
and they sang First Love Song instead
and then her friends showed up
She sang
It might have been let go
I am not actually sure Hibiki ever actually *fired* her zesshou
so there's that
which is a force unmatched by anything else
but Tsubasa did have the force of completing character development behind her
~~without zesshou~~
Tsubasa destroyed it afterwards
it charged up again
well
it fired again
no
It's hard to say
she needed charge up time to be the most effective
she isn't as good at spamming them in s1
to channel the beam
and deployed
it was even out
that's how she wasn't erased
her gear's defensive system was juiced by a zesshou
even if DBZ used it that way a lot
don't get attached to dramatic animation uses that you think that that animation means "literally erase'
you see the beam sweep over her
that's why she wasn't completely erased
but she nullified some of the strength
yes
so she didn't take the full blast
they deflect
that's what those little moonlight butterfly crystals do
she had deflectors
I'm pretty sure Chris was about to die because she fell from about 700m up but the internal damage from the zesshou probably didn't help
it felt very strongly like an eat your hamburgers apollo moment
most will go "why is there cabbage in my pancake"
but if you tell an english person "let's go have pancakes" and hand them okonomiyaki
YES THEY'RE TECHNICALLY PANCAKES
so
anyway the people who translated it as Swan Song also gave us Heavenrend and called okonomiyaki pancakes
and then it sits at a big fat 0%
It drops from a 2/4 lethality rate in S1 (counting Chris) to a 1/14 lethality rate in G
but yes
it stopped Tsubasa singing for *a while*, and Chris was absolutely about to fucking die
I think season 1 didn't really kill the idea of it being a swan song too much
Swan song felt really appropriate for S1
Zesshou is Zesshou
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
but I'm not about to suggest the whole cast can
Kayano Ai can do it - she's actually a worse singer in Symphogear than she is normally due to it
very different from changing your *singing* voice
changing your voice
here's the thing
but uh
yeah Kayano Ai has a strong range
maybe it grew them the first time she transformed
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but
though this doubles down on "how can it make a symphogear without all the converters and doodads that caused such trouble in GX"
and maybe some of it just splintered very small and grew over time
it gets a pass
this is more the kind of thing that it has to exist for the story to work, so as long as it's not *absurd* they can't do it
and it's very narratively convinient
it's not too much of a stretch to believe they couldn't
maybe but
there's plenty of stories out there revolving around stuff too dangerous to surgically remove
*that* I believe
*is still fucking suspicious*
if you think about it
which
I think it was because I couldn't understand how Hibiki could have the entire symphogear system in her if it was all in the pendant
either, I guess
it wasn't until GX with Elfnein directly performing surgery on the pendants that I was like "oh"
I don't know why I assumed that but
first time I watched s1 I assumed that the symphogear system was more like a... uh, morphing grid kind of affair where the relic fragment didn't actually contain everything, but it was some sort of external network Ryoko had built
you know what's wild
from G
```In fact, the Symphogear system has 301,655,722 different varieties of locks applied to it. Depending on the user's level of ability and their personal battle style, there is a systematic progression of phases that the user will go through to release the locks. 

The purpose of this setup is to adjust the Symphogear to the user's individual preferences, however it is also in place to reduce the strain put on the user's body as much as feasibly possible. In order to achieve this, and give the user a greater mastery of the system itself, it is essential that the user be trained with the device at an increasing difficulty and learn to operate it proficiently. ```
it's a keyword
the locks thing is canon
something about 21 bajillion locks
but all the girls unlock their gears to be more capable
She gets better at firing them later
in s1
she needs the giant ones that take 15 seconds of defenseless charging
those micromissiles aren't destroying kadingir
most of her missiles suck
but even if she did fire the zesshou, she's in a goddamn X-drive at that point <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
fucking rough
that was
I can't handle another 00 Ptoleimaios
*god*
god
I feel that one's fairly unlikely, if only to avoid criticism from the fact they already had an elfnein death scene
<:KiriCry:442974585831292928>
I'll try to remember to avoid it with you
<:blobcatthinking:575405441018888364> I love collecting the variations though
yeah that's valid
"if only there were some clue, anywhere, in any fashion, as to what it could be"
"gosh I wonder what outside's favorite gear could possibly be"
but for me it was more
I can see kanade's point
<:Thinkki:514552069563088896>
did you appreciate Maria having a drill punch
welcome to the XV club, outside
I think Symphogear as a franchise might take a break here
yeah that sounds solid
I think where Symphogear goes from here depends a lot on how XV does and how XDU does
*they* don't know
right now
I expect
of the fight group songs
can you imagine having to do multiple takes of that
we had topdad vs Carol, we had boy vs junta man who controls all the noise, and now we have signal flare man
in 3 seasons
3 times
because we've had this scene
signal flare man was cool but I think that's just someone having a big fetish for small man stands up to powerful man
they saved all those mooks in antarctica
hey
hey
too bad 00 s2 had a shit plot
00 s1's end was really pretty awesome looking back at it
Losing the sub bridge would be about the same
rough
it was
It was also the death of the hero ship (and the hero base of operations, and basically the hero organization)
One of them was missing the lower half of his body I think
yeah most of them had already evacuated
in a really drawn out fashion
two bridge bunnies died
Beam cannon to the main bridge
I mean
XDU brought the priest back and drew some thicker lines suggesting connection
AXZ
They can't stop getting along unless they were getting along previously
presumeably things weren't as bad before her
Fine's also the reason the moon curse exists
one of them sat on one of those office chairs with a bad piston
lmao
though I'd find it unlikely purely because it's very undramatic
yeah, I actually wouldn't count old age out
why not bury one on earth?
even in myth, gods die
just because they're like gods doesn't mean they're immortal
kirika looks like she's gotten into the wedding dresses again
<:MikuCry:489493686779117578>
but it's *probably* not a red herring
it could
but that's just a guess
<@285546830220099585> I think she locked Tsubasa's trauma in place
Symphogear's firing on all cylinders for the first time since G
That was excellent
ALSO WOW I'M LOVING THIS ART STYLE SHIFT
the song was okay I guess but it's amazingly low energy and the animation is generic for having such heavy growling instruments
symphogear has finally made an OP I will want to skip every time
wow
it will be
helps give the concert strobe effect
it might be fixed for BD or it might be intentional
no tweening
It was all keyframes
yeah the concert's a mess - but impressive despite that
everyone's rounder and has less angles
for the slice of life scenes
AMAZING
THIS NEW ART STYLE
YEAH HEY
unless we get a terrorist event in japan in which case we could possibly be waiting a month after that fucking episode
NOPE SORRY WAIT A WEEK, FOOLISH MORTAL
Exiv
Chris' sneeze, aka the namedrop for the season
~~I actually won't be surprised if we still get a redemption arc~~
wait, what do you mean no subs
have fun
this is "the character of Kirika and the character of Shirabe, being gay"
This was not "the gay duo of Shirabe and Kirika"
10 minutes of DMJii on screen together and yet it did more to elaborate on them as individual characters than *any scene prior*
Anyway can we talk about how we had like
the lesbian estrogen is strong in her
stared at hibiki's boobs?
remember when she fucking
I choose to believe it's because it's how Kirika's personally developing
Kirika is a horny bitch <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
the actual episode files don't have them
both the dimming and the low-framerate ghosting is a post-production thing slapped on the actual episode to make it broadcast-legal
13th major arcana
and then I was like
So yeah about this, I was wondering about the light flash for like
20 seconds
I think some did
most got away, even if the animation really sucked shit at showing it
out of 80k people
about 5k dead
first live was uh
it went down really well
Like, considering how *absurdly* ambitious this episode was animation wise
Overall it was great for TV
but
Animation struggled at a few points
for me
ep 2 was cool but Gekkishou Infinity kind of overloads ep 1
it probably is
I think G is the only other Symphogear besides XV I felt had a better ep 2 than ep 1
I was like "that's not a V"
yeah same
so good
and that's
is the Death card
especially since that would make Chris kidnapped like 50 years ago
I wasn't serious millhi
maybe they're reading old papers
I don't think?
no
either she doesn't overcome the trauma and she's fucked, or she does overcome it and there is no possible character arc that can be impressive
no matter what they need to bench Tsubasa after XV though
but someone might pick up a scar along the way
I think we'll be piloted towards a positive ending
This is early february at *latest*, probably january
Sorry, probably 2-3 months away from being 17
Kirika's a month or two away from being 17
Not realizing that the point of animation is to look good in motion
Yeah I've seen a lot of people make fun of frames of anime from like trigger
I think it makes sense given kirika's character but it also says a lot about the storyboarder
Isn't it possible her boots help form the giant arm
Looking at the leg armor thing
Zwei wing has like a 5% lethality rate
I'm sure it'll come out that a bunch/most escaped or something
Don't get too carries away counting deaths
Right?
Not alchanoise
Banana noise were noise
Odds on Bavarian girls being fudou puppets?just trying to anticipate the outside twist
So
Galaxy cross was fine, it was only after the concert
Nougat was talking about irl
Nana or not
If we get a terrorist attack at a live symphogear is cancelled for like 2 years
Stadium capacity was 80k
Around 5k iirc
Fine planned it so she could steal awakened nehushtan
Ehhh
It was more organic and less giant pointy eyes
I actually liked the slice of life art better
<@152422489417318400> we don't have any info more than you
Yeah it's a stupid stadium
<@152896851660505088> y u do this to me
Yeah I'm not counting phara
With xv it's 4/6
(everyone forgets flight feathers)
That's a 40% chance things are okay!
It's only 3/5 before this
There's a lot of collateral
Rockets do have backblast
And then 4 is chris
Oh yes
Who is on CD 3
`and maria`
When she sawed down the noise right around the soldiers
Also holy cow I forgot how good shirabe got
They're finally more than just their relationship
I love how kirika and shirabe got more individual characterization than like the total of symphogear up to this point
Tsubamari is now an actual ship instead of just narrative pairing
Hibimiku will be purified by the flames and emerge even stronger
Is that when the CD hits
Basically protomatter
Yeah they talk about what it is in gx
Pretty common pole dancing move
My guess is a leg split
How would they know
...
And then the autoscorers showed up with a new kind of noise
They did
I think that probably doesn't count
The one concert with zero problems ever
Gungnir also wasn't at flight feathers
Does everyone forget that the concert in g had zero injuries
It works until you get to see the numbers
Yeah fair  <@283649756226387978>
Itd be kanade before serena
Miku
It lacks the impact they tried to make it have
Yeah they tried to justify it but it's a mess of a plotline
More people survived than died
It's like blaming *one particular kid* at the parkland shooting for surviving
It's. Dumb.
90% of the zwei wing concert survived
Let's not forget *it's a stupid plotline*
Also hey
It involves regressing her character to work
Yeah I hope they don't go that road, it's clumsy
the whole stadium is absurd
maybe Tsubasa can fire those swords
if Shirabe can fire those saws perfectly
I mean
oh gosh
Unstoppable Force met an Immovable Object and they both broke down
Durandal dusted itself in its struggle against the infinitely regenerating Nehushtan
https://twitter.com/Regris_Kallen/status/1150176336314425344
anyway, Fire
I only watched that part of AXZ once though because I find AXZ kind of boring
meaning they have the real things the other doesn't
doesn't kirika have a fake bday and shirabe have a fake name
My girlfriend will talk about this a lot.
yes.
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
ah
yeah Metanoia's super low energy for a symphogear op
I thought I saw a tweet saying Miliaarc, at least, wouldn't be redeemed
We have 13 episodes and we're going to deal with shit like Shirabe's backstory, what the hell Argetlaim actually is, deep fucking traumas apparently, the A-plot(s)... They haven't been flagging anything about Kirika in the keywords or bios or anything and I worry she won't really get some of the *very limited* spotlight
~~have Kirika be one of the only ones who stays in SONG so she's forefront for the 10 year later sequel~~
We do, but I have no idea where we'll get it
I need caffeine, dang
I'd be kind of like a instrumental bookending the close, too
the first thing you hear in the show
musically
First Love Song is
~~it's going to be apple and I'm going to break my laptop~~
Symphogazer could work
Actually I think it should be either First Love Song, or Nijiro no Flugel
maybe they'll go with "well her soul's dead but here's a copy of her mind" or something
god I'm dying to find out how they're going to work Fine into the plot given she's super dead
ah, I see your point
they're static scenes
well
if you watch season one backwards, it's about the fated birthing of an angel from dust
I was mad
that was shit
6 epsiodes before it was revealed
GX showed Argetlaim
and I'm still mad it won't be a surprise now
it's a completely new way of attacking
even if it is the previous golden form
but deeper since s1? **yes**
Deeper in XV than AXZ? not that I noticed
"there's still the final form" doesn't make "we're spoiling the midseason upgrade" any less shit, krika
that's something I really would have preferred being surprised by
am I the only one mad they used the new bikki form/attack in the opening?
hey
she is
you really can't mistake which one is the vampire
but there's not a huge difference
technically they plug in right at the bottom her spine
I mean
*I cannot get over this character concept*
suitcase full of her favorite combat buttplugs
yes
yeeeeeee
buttplug enthusiast
(reminder that, before S1 aired, marketing materials really portrayed Tsubasa and Kanade as the leading duo)
no rakhi symphogear's never jumped into grim stuff like killing one of the leading cast members off in the first episode or anything
they're cool *now*
adding the skirt buzzsaw made up for the stupid yoyos in GX
I should probably go have that caffeine
<:thinkeline:410534291462815745>
my logic doesn't make sense
wait
I hope it is a passive effect or Kirika is *even fucking dumber* for using it on shirabe if it's uncontrollable
~~probably doesn't during zesshou, either, unless they need it again~~
probably doesn't have the whole soul killing bit though
because her scythe's been a jet engine since G
<:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
AXZ faust robes were at least in there by episode 4 and it's not something you were dying to see *since last season*
you'll find out why we're reserved
keep watching meta
She's an experiment so there's really no telling
yeah, unknown
kiri or wolfgirl
who
every time
I love it
that XIII
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQsOqg32Y7o
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
they also misnamed fudou
it's similar
`let it rip`
a e s t h e t i c, voyeur
OP, I think
at one point
Kerrik we see her use giant feet
let's not get too explicitly lewd
pretty obvious about it
I can't wait for Maria to trip during her transformation sequence
what you're looking at is all keyframes
<@106861977086779392> I'm not 100% sure the concert looks like it does because of rotoscoping
which means they probably looked into the Frontier incident
which means they probably know Hibiki can channel divine power
They presumeably know about how Adam failed
Well
"how would they know about Miku"
yeah it's like the last 3 seasons never happened
üçø
üçø
meta's here
oh
really interested to see what Symphogear would do with a concert scene with a movie budget
I'm
higher end of TV-capable animation
it looks good in motion
it'd go along with her whole GX "I'm strong because I'm weak" ~~bullshit~~ resolution
I mean
I would love Maria forever if she did that actually
Killing everyone was just the only way that she would be able to not be beaten to a pulp while doing it
The reason was the seal
I expect it'll focus around skating, ballet, and yoyos, given her figure and gear
"no you'll be late for your pole dancing class"
for all commie's faults they tend to do a better job checking details than CR
what subs were you using
then it's probably 7
I thought 4 was where she lost her arm
is that 4?
with her *untransformed* hand
no
with her hand
at the very beginning
but it's the episode where Hibiki punches the noise
anyway I don't have G on this computer because I have 250 gigs of space
other people took that and refined it into a new art
she created basically protoalchemy
the two statements aren't contradictory
it's reviving the dead, undoing final actions for the pure sake of making season 5 more of a spectacle
that's the worst kind of retcon
please don't actually write
but if you want them to take that route
say "well it's fine's soul in shirabe but it's actually in someone else"
in theory
they could
anyway yes
something about Igalima's Zesshou is something that rends the soul
She mentioned it where she busts it out against Hibiki
yep
obviously circumstances matter, but for something like armor purge, there's really nothing saying she had to be naked after
in the 90s, they weren't - if you saw a character naked from 20 feet away, that was fanservice
things do not need to be slow lingering high detailed shots to be fanservice
also a bunch of music groups took their names from araki
did you know there's tarot cards named after stands
dracula's also a jojo reference
its true
zenbu
jojo is
jojo is all encompasing
everything is jojo
dance styles are jojo
tarot cards are jojo
Shirabe was talking about how she's been changed
We have the tower and high priestess at least
cups is sometimes chalices, staves is sometimes wands or clubs
they're also sometimes "discs" or "rings"
you can see why they're known as coins
but
some versions refer to them as pentacles
tarot have big, fancy cards, but also a bunch of numbered cards
yeah
coins/staves/swords/cups
Nara: examine the autoscorers using the themes of the *Minor* arcana
Maria
how could you forget the comic relief of GX
the tarot motifs are an understated quality of gx
please treat the deepest lore with respect
it's Steve?
isn't it exciting
Serena as a major arcana seems...
·µÉ‚Åø·µà ·µê·µÉ ≥·∂¶·µÉ
because she discovered the whole relic fusion thing
Fine in s1 accelerated her plans
That said
is probably hard to come by no matter when you incarnate
access to complete relics, especially ones that *specialize* in destructive force
oh wow yeah that's a good point
she pionered heretical technology, supposedly, but others perfected the alchemical branch of it
I don't actually think she had access to alchemy
and secondly
honestly? it's possible alchemy isn't enough
it makes sense she couldn't really *destroy the moon* in the 1600s
Pretty sure it's a combination of technology she had access to and incarnating in a person that could accomplish things
oh
stuck?
that's not "bad planning"
afterwards
not hitting when you have 19 in blackjack even though you find out the next card's a 2
it's like
I don't think that's bad planning more than tying up loose ends
they thought it pretty likely there wouldn't be
so no, no choice
I don't think Fine "exists" in a form that can make choices until she reincarnates
probably for the best
yeah, it's gone for good
what with the ridiculous minute long recap at the start
tbh running out of time makes complete sense to me
we *might* see the extended one, but I don't know
we'll never see the lewder one
they're not the same sequence, exactly
2) later, they had a mostly finished version (how finished isn't clear) but they ran out of time and about 10 seconds were trimmed to make it to broadcast
that got a bunch of it cut
originally there was a lewder version roughly storyboarded
1)
okay let's break down what it actually is
It might not be finished
Ehhh
This is fairly accurate, it was tweeted by the artist himself
then what.
he punches a hole through Fine's chest
*let's say*
Let's say
Genjuro would have lost anyway
hot take
she also miscalculated that Chris would be willing to zesshou, because it's *entirely* contrary to her character as Fine knew her
they're the same person
unfortunately
I don't think Genjuro could ever beat Ryoko
I think Genjuro could maybe beat Fine with meme power until she started summoning noise
They knew Ryoko was a cats paw, they just didn't know for what precisely
this isn't really the *wrong* move, just arguably not the *perfect* move
you've moved from "these are holes in the plan and it doesn't make sense" to "I don't like this"
but okay the bottom line is this
maybe it would kill her
Chris has failed every single mission
This seems like a pretty small quibble
and thought she was fairly controlled
She probably didn't think Chris was a problem because she psychologically abused Chris for years
her cover was blown before she could transition to late game
She needs the symphogears alive
there *isn't* a before that
and destroying the tower
ignoring the noise
what's stopping them from
if she tried to "split"
she was defending a tower
when was she supposed to fight tsubasa or hibiki one on one
because the symphogear users were how she got the funding
She needed the symphogear users until the tower was completely ready
okay <@239893407122718721> heads up because I think you're getting terms mixed up
which isn't a bad thing, it's a different writing tool
I agree though, he has a flat arc
you get a really keen look at his worldview
they developed him in his speech to Chris
I refute the "not developed" statement
Also
edgy but okay
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I guess you'll be happy when XV kills him off then and shows he has limits
yeah, it being cold outside was specifically called out as *not* the reason he's not fighting
if you say XV, you clearly suck at viewing comprehension
when did he ever not do something because it's cold outside
as long as the main character's untouchable
and still sucked
SAO could have fixed that
but
right
spoiler: it sucks and has no tension
watch SAO
if you want a story where the hero has unlimited power and cannot lose
his bullshit is derived from the fact he's *not* the hero
Even if it doesn't
he doesn't know she can't be killed
He could, but why *would* he
they just didn't want to reveal that card yet
and got hurt
let his guard down
Genjuro would have dealt a "killing" blow
nah
who knows
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
so
This was, nominally, Kirika's episode
but
I'd say "oh no that's Chris' episode"
we only have 11 eps left
or they won't have enough time to build new ones
but that means they can't cut every support beam out there
yeah
but the ending overall has to be a positive outcome
It doesn't have to have a perfect survival rate
XV's gotta have a positive ending or the whole series fails
I think Tsubasa might be the only one to get Seal Inversion'd
I don't think they'll be targetted *together*
that's a loooooot of time to take up
I don't think we're going to see a targetted, specified trauma for every cast member as orchestrated by the Alchemists
it was fantastic
so I'm not sure GX really counts
*one fucking episode* to have their arc start, finish, and end in
I mean, in GX, everyone who isn't hibiki got
XV hopefully will save us from that too
I think in she's been used pretty awfully and, personally, I think her popularity's hung on purely by power of aesthetics
not that I think Maria has much of a shadow
it didn't do much, but they weren't hanging out in Maria's shadow for it
they got grouped with Maria for a while because all three used linker, but in slice of life, they spent a lot of time hanging onto Chris or, there were the AXZ eps where shirabe was paired with basa and Kirika with hibiki
I don't think so?
5 minutes of XV did a better job at treating Kirika and Shirabe as separate characters than the totality of GX and AXZ
I'm sure we'll get something
that's development, even if I think it's weak
AXZ gave her the fact she's willing to basically crucify herself to give someone a good birthday because the fact she doesn't have one tears her up inside
G would be enough to say they don't have a flat character arc
but yes the zababa duo are hard to analyze because the writers tended to use them more as a aesthetic unit rather than as characters in s3-4
Considering some of Shirabe's first lines in episode 2 were about how much she's been changed by kirika I think we'll get more insight
I think at least some of them have shitty arcs, or arcs with not enough time to mature, but they definitely have them
I only bring up the distinction because as underdevloped as FIS might be argued to be, they're definitely characters changed by the world rather than having a flat character arc
it just means the way he interacts with the world is by changing it rather than it changing him
That doesn't mean he doesn't have depth (it also doesn't mean he does have depth)
when we're calling genjuro flat we're really discussing that he's the same person in s1e1 as he is in XVep2
"flat character arc" is a literary term with a definition
that's fine and you can do that
it means character who doesn't have a progressive arc where they are changed
"flat character arc/flat character" (in this context) doesn't mean "character with low amount of detail
being excalibur wouldn't be important enough
Tsubasa changes her perception
my point
that's
....yeah?
they don't explain it worth shit
I mean
philosophical armaments work on what's perceived rather than what is
reality is secondary
perception is everything
I thought it made perfect sense, honestly
Tsubasa clearly demonstrated that how it's used is the only thing the philosophical armament cared about
all we know is Maria defined it as a sword
*ehhh*
Serena might get focus just for being the first wielder of x00
we're going to get a lot more than "oh yes she died"
if this is serena
did we ever figure out who these were because my first reaction was maria and serena
good chance they will
she's in the opening
dead space used twinkle twinkle little star really well yeah
if they try to use it as a climax again
I'm going to be so mad
see 00 Gundam
I sound like I'm meming but that's really what happens a lot when you get two seasons greenlit
it was called AXZ
we had an upgrade arc
no idea what
Chris already has something she's afraid of
yeah?
...
but it was a vital clue
it was brushed over really quickly
the scene where shirabe addressed genjuro like they'd met before
Oh, also
not really much I can say to that
ok
*that* is subtlty
by carefully inspecting the scene
but you could absolutely come to the correct conclusion
It was misleading
I'm still lost but alright
I don't know why you're trying to insist it's not
again my point was that symphogear was being subtle
if you just paid very close attention
but it also contained the truth
yes
???
Most subtlty involves misdirection
but it was actually a dome centered on Shirabe
where Kirika made the Asgard shield
<@200030864497704960> except that one scene in G
whether it prevents her from using her gear or just prevents her from being effective in it remains to be seen
yeah it's not subtle
*pretty sure* that was metaphorical as well
Tsubasa dropped her sword at the end of the ep
GX Gungnir Maria lost her cape
They do, to an extent
that's them redefining the world through perception
the whole thing with them being able to jump buildings?
It's not really a thing in the West outside of philosophy/works derived thereof like the Matrix
the world changes
if your perceptions change
when the only world you truly experience is the world you perceive
It's kind of like solopsism extended into reality through magic
You also weren't raised where every rock and tree has its own spirit or god
I don't think I'd call it stupid, it's a cultural perspective thing
It's very Eastern?
new
but the ideas that work off concepts rather than reality isn't
Anyway yeah GX probably did a shit job explaining it
ok.
"it's not a relic, it's a different relic"
and she'll deal with it
they'll go somewhere where they *happen* to find out the truth about her
Shirabe's plot will probably be fit around the edges
they're in the same room frequently
amazing theory, but debunked
there's like 4 links in between there
do not, honestly, really have much to do with *custodians*
Tsubasa having a concert and all those people dying
there's *a little* wiggle room
made of finding out her past
imo
she'll get an arc
no
I'm not sure Shirabe needs a role beyond being herself and exploring herself
maybe we'll do a Madoka episode 10 and just spend a whole episode flashing back to Fine's story
the problem is more that we're getting *tons* of Fine-related keywords imo
seems fit
this was a flashback to the activation of the curse
I mean
that contextualizes it, I think
supposed to be the final climax in the symphogear story
G was, of course
She was talking as if she only had the one soul and would not be reincarnating again
but she sacrificed her soul
her reincarnation was Shirabe
Right
Fine's dead and Shirabe's no longer her host in any way is how Symphogear has handled it up to this point
looking back at it, the curvature is suspicious if you stare at it
hints in the very same scene
More than hints beforehand
so your analogy fails there
we concluded that ourselves, as did Kirika
because they never told us Kirika was Fine
It doesn't
I mean unless you're arguing that it was obvious rather than subtle in which case I bow to your powers of first-watch observation
but they're all misleading
Magicians are subtle because they *have* to be to make the illusions work
why it being misleading removes any chance of subtlety existing?
isn't?
this
like no one is arguing the chris tie thing isn't subtle? I'm just confused why you're saying
yeah I think that was the moment the writers were hoping the people who didn't pour over previous episodes would go "hey wait"
you can be lied to and still subtly told the truth
pause first
most villains who parade noise like that
yeah
but they didn't and they wouldn't
Yeah, they could have made a probably better decision
Characters not being supreme maximally capable badasses isn't a failure of writing or plot as much as I've seen anime fans argue along those lines in the past
and it's exactly what Miliaarc's trying to leverage
is the arrogance of the strong
to think you can hesitate there
I think it's worth noting that Maria and Tsubasa hesitating at the concert is actually a reinforcement of the enemy's main theme
it might seem like "everyone" dislikes "everything"
but when you read through several different people disliking several different things
we're absolutely not required to love symphogear and everything it does without exception to be fans
is fair
which, I think you'll agree
I think it's more that some of us dislike different things
kind of
her dad recognized her
Hibiki transformed on camera in G
the show or keywords would have told us
it's not known
no
and that probably slowed her as she had to decide whether she needed to or not
and she was in public
also she wasn't transformed
I mean, yes? Were you expecting a wild personality shift?
Not everything needs to be an A plot
elsa's going to be dmjii's foil, primarily, I think
Maria would be the first witch
because 6k years ago is *way too quick* for it to end up in antarctica
do you think they're going to retcon when the tower of babel went down
wait
but uhhhhh
that'd be so sad
üá´
rip mummy
well it's in america's possession, but using anime shorthand that means it's probably in the continental united states, yes
I have no insight into any bit of Prelati's character other than they used to murder children and now have a child's body
which would make her a trans woman, even before she was given the body
some of Cagli's dialogue suggests she always wanted this body
Cagliostro
ace is shorthand for asexual
that's valid
I've seen people claim her as ace representation, and
she's basically otaku bait
and finally, she's themed around guns and mecha references
She also had a very nicely done s1 arc helping her popularity
Chris leads the market in pervy ecchi merchandise by several miles
same
Chris is never getting a girlfriend because she has to be single and unclaimed for the otaku fanbase
OP kind of pretty clearly draws lines, just like AXZ did
which is... pretty appropriate
She has the bloodthirst needed but she's hard to take seriously at first
Her design works imo
if she tries it again narrative quality would demand she's thwarted by adapting heroes
Chris/Bikki/Miku gets Vanessa
it's in the OP
Better character design than cagli <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Millaarc's outfit struck me as annoying at first but it fits her in motion
<:BikkiAngery2:530170341624905739>
I'm talking old school, sailor moon etc
I'm not even talking neo magical girl
so the slender hands and long nails don't surprise me?
Also giving your most evil villains hyperfeminine features is a staple of magical girl
she comes across as psychotic
Millaarc didn't come across as genki to me
over on the right
them
<@185949743321579520> see the <@&338468649646161921> category?
*give them to me*
the little XDU robo FIS as nendos
FIS nendos are good but you know what's better
I've known solo for a year now and I can tell you there's no ill will here

I'm currently at work so I can't really run this conversation now but please assume good faith
I appreciate you trying to deescalate but that's not how to do it
Hey do you mind not demanding people to explain themselves
Basically choose to believe in magic, 20 minutes at a time
I can do that with gaogaigar
I think the closest I can come to an actual phrase that works is let childlike wonder dominate and overrule the critical adult who usually lives in your mind
I think he's just in the mood for a different tempo
I think lectric is something else anyway
If you're really so bored by it waiting shouldn't be hard
<@302063351767498752> if you want to give the show a fair shot and don't want a mood or phase to ruin it I'd wait till the show is over and then binge
Used to be the other way around
The dimming isn't as annoying to me as the ghosting though
Well it is
It goes against eastern pride
Not plausible at all
That's a post process effect added to the episode master file in order to pass broadcasting restrictions aimed at preventing seizures in viewers
So action scenes in broadcast anime get weirdly dark and blurry right?
Sorry to have such a strict policy <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
That day is now as long as you spoiler them and mark them xv, but I know you're mainly on mobile
There was ghosting in hibiki's
Ayahi was asked during recording to provide some "bouncing" sound effects for the sequence if she could and she had no idea what to do
For those that missed it
but we'd all rather see gunplay
Like a sexy chris transformation has some merits, I guess???
really worries me it'll kinda be shit
during the transformation
sound effects
Ayahi's quote about being asked for
>finish her training
I have no idea
it's worth noting that it's shirabe singing, rather than nanjo, which limits her - Kayano Ai's singing is worse than her normal capability (though still good, of course) because she has to remain with Kiri's range and act as her
yeah they're not hiding that there's going to be one
it's good
we've already heard one
"okay take her"
"who's your favorite girl"
they go to the ADs and go
how the henshins are done in XV
basically
that doesn't mean they ended up using the idea
Ayahi said it's what they asked her for
hibiki's was, just in a non-sexual way
they all should be
well
every second focused on the tits is a second not focused on guns
remember kids
People have been saying there'll be more to do with GX than anything else, yes
I mean
Ame no Habikiri didn't completely shatter on touch either
she got pretty thrashed from it?
I mean
but it is only a table as humans dictate
any flat surface can be a table, or used as a table, or become a table
A table is a table only if humans treat it as a table
Let me think of an example
then changing the concept means the weapon has nothing to attack
If a weapon attacks something at a conceptual level
completely 100% true
it's a real world
It's like the matrix, kind of - if you never wake up from it
I don't really want to get too into solipsism but it's kind of fundamental here
The thing you're not really getting is that there's a completely valid argument to be made that facts don't exist without a conscious mind to interpret them
aren't you the one who claimed philosophical weapons don't make sense and are stupid
Again, I don't really agree - It all holds together *fairly* well, though you have to make some assumptions about a few background details
there's some writing flaws but I don't think I agree that everything in symphogear is stupid, and that's what symphogear is about
I don't agree with that
~~good writing could still redeem her, but I don't think viewers would appreciate it~~
Millaarc is intentionally thrust into the realm of villains not made to be redeemed
FIS can't have done what they did because it was always in the plans for all 6 to be friends at the end
yeah I have no idea, I personally think they won't pin a hard number to it
<:cocklotte:345973495756357643>
that's a death flag if I've ever seen one, for Genjuro
oh no
It *looked* like dogshit
maybe
I didn't hear about that if so
really pretty shit
Episode 2 was
I think so? but I think they managed to still tell most of the story
probably not but hey
see the rest someday
maybe
we might
at least with shenmue
where we only ever got to see 1/7th of the intended story, with some of the rest mashed up and mangled into a remixed Xenosaga
it'd be like a Xenogears situation
and then it would end
because odds are we'd have gotten two seasons and had a story 2/5s complete
I'd have hated if they were
god
My point was that Symphogear isn't all mindless silliness that doesn't work - I think a lot of it does work (with some bad writing) and that if you think it's all dumb maybe it's not the show's fault the pieces don't come together
is because people think Gungnir can do that
the only reason Hibiki can punch god
similarly
Tsubasa's attacks are very Sword until the very end when she redefines herself and how she's moving forward through life
only a little bit sword
a kitchen knife?
that's very very Sword
Give me a claymore
like
you can have a stronger conception of "Sword" for some things as others
but that doesn't mean that everything is scientific
there's actual thought behind it
there's more than rule of cool
I don't agree here
it's very labor intensive with lots of checking required from the AD and you have to have them animated somewhat sequentially
it's kind of misleading to call it expensive
and then regains it and loses it
Tsubasa also loses blood for some of the shots
it's really expensive to give permanence to that stuff
They needed arcs, not focus episodes
I also think axz fucked up hard in that trying to explore their connection in a single episode alone - that's probably the only part I actually dislike
Meanwhile the xv tsubamari focus is needed to actually sail the ship they tried to pretend they built earlier
It felt external rather than diagetic
Axz unique pairs felt really forced to me
So was durandal
Nehushtan was busted
If she was regenerating she hadn't lost
If Fine hadn't truly lost I don't think she would have been so pointlessly petty
The counter to Fine's unlimited durability was infinite force
The pride/bloodthirst in it is pretty hot
<:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
because
I just want Millaarc to say Kazanari Tsubasa some more
Kinda like tsubasa's bloodspray in xv
If you don't watch things get better it's almost always an error
If it was just the two relics they'd probably be locked in that state without end
Cagli is borderline too extra for me
Adam is possibly the least evil main villain, ironically enough
Concertobots
I can't see a song named tomorrow without thinking of FMP
"Common Sense" - good to have, most don't have it, cuts through bullshit
have you seen the keywords lately
she just sneezed
I mean
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Venturing to different timelines would be hell by the way lol
What you're talking about is worldbuilding details *unneeded for the season plot*
and then you complain that Symphogear doesn't use its very limited time to worldbuild?
Okay so you first say that Symphogear doesn't need longer seasons
but it feels natural and right there'd be multiple branches of Black Arts
Alchemy isn't mentioned until GX
like, sure
I don't think you need to announce that a brick exists in order for the building brick to work
üëç
not her future
XV has hinted they'll be looking at Fine's past
I think it's just about the Exiv sneeze
that's basically an entire keyword
This is the 15 year old girl experience
`"oops I was wrong now I feel guilty so I will kill myself"`
üìû
Cobra no
You still can't punch them obv
Yeah there's a keyword about how noise are vulnerable to counter attack for a moment before they hit someone
she just aged herself up while wearing it
carol's relic didn't increase chest size
I think the season's fast tracking this Alchemist plot a little too quickly, meaning we'll probably have an episode 6 climax and then expansion of scope
9's usually it
sorry it took me a while to zero in on it
21:21 should let you find it
because wow that was a very obvious animation error
Are we on the topic of bad animation because of them forgetting to animate one of Vanessa's lines
Gravion still looks like garbage
in my day anime looked like shit and was never fixed <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
I concur that Chris was the least impressive one so far
as in the tarot card
13 yes
I didn't hate it but I just kind of dropped it without realizing I dropped it
+ was just pretty boring
ah, ok
I watched blood+ and dropped it halfway, are they related
yeah maybe without the dimming the visual noise will pop better
I liked Chris' transformation funnels but the rest was kinda messy
yes
It's completely possible that japanese nationalism is actually thought of as a heroic force making him not seem completely evil to some of the writers and or viewers - just too hardcore about it
they alluded having their own goals in ep1
Answer's pretty obviously the second one
G3FA
Hexarevolver
they have a soulful quality to them
I like Shirabe's songs even if they're not bangers
we've missed out on so much
imagine if symphogear had been using dmjii this way the whole time
how many of those frames are in "cursed scene - do not open" folders
XV seems to have a lot of places where I'd expect G-AXZ to put one, but doesn't
or are they doing way less attack cards than before?
is it just me
OH SO
Tsubasa receives her gear upgrade of the season, Blade Liger
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
It's elfnein welding a soumen slide
DMJii is the wholesome comedy relief they should have always been
If G never existed I would expect to see s1 compared with madoka
I'd call it "was dark so it could ride on the success of Madoka"
"the curse of being compared to madoka"
<#371105434771390465> <:ChibiDess:391790922565812225>
d a n k
press f for miku
Both gx and axz had gimmicks that prevented b sides from having time
Trying to keep their power output high, maybe?
I mean hibiki having it didn't do a lot
Not that having divine power seemed all that useful
If we're dealing with god-like power this season we could see actual resurrection
I am not talking about fakeouts, though I guess that's possible
Only way Miku dies is if she comes back from the dead later
but Commie handled that one fine with Team Primary Colors
(Traffic Light also needs a bit of work, considering they're applying to Red/Yellow/Blue)
not the food item
The problem is the colors are the reference here
whether neopolitan is a good choice is up for debate, but if you're trying to make it accessible to the point where you're not using okonomiyaki, you really shouldn't use dango
dango is definitely not what you should use when localizing
it's a Big Deal that this is the climax
all of the promotional materials
It was in like
I love her to bits but until XV the writers haven't really given her a chance to shine
And elfnein was a pawn in GX, and actually useless in AXZ - the only time she was almost useful, Ver came back from the dead for a moment to steal her spotlight
joe pls
Thousand Tears
Oh, that'd be fun
and her gear manifested them in response
it's possible she trained hard to be able to fight like Kanade
Considering Tsubasa didn't have foot blades yet
stuff would be orbiting and such
maybe like how shirabe does yoyo tricks to assemble her armor
Kanade never really got a fighting style in the series besides "generic superpowered spear user"
Kanade's would be really cool, but I wonder what theme they'd go off of
*most* magical girl shows have symbols of purity and other "virtues" embedded all over the place
Adam and Eve are always portrayed as nude because they're pure and innocent and not wearing clothing is literally part of that
Nudity being purity is actually common across a lot of cultures
Kirika's definitely has an element of sexuality to it
I was more building off of Miku's comments
a lot of magical girls are naked during transformation because it's basically a state of purity
If you come from the west it's kind of jarring, but nudity in japanese media isn't automatically lewd -
aside maybe from GX where everyone gets naked for no real sensible reason
Symphogear's kept the horny fairly low-key, to be fair
yeah, I think basically all of XV's sequences are going on my top 10 list
Honestly I've always had a huge soft spot for the season 1 transformations so when they opened with that in XV I was really excited
It's a loveletter to the entire series, which is amazing
and yeah, I agree, Hibiki's is a masterpiece
<@269655454957830144> it's not a spoiler but going into it in detail would be!
anyway symphogear XDU would be better off focusing on the unique stuff
especially considering it's half of the entire show
I just don't think it's worth the entry price of three hours of the viewer's life
yeah there's content for the viewer
and as it released it was hell
I recognize the artistry but I was also there when it happened
sorry
I have feelings
<:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
2 months of destroying a story
and it was shit
it was an auteur piece
because they had to *rerecord* every episode
I still remember the news articles about the cast members preparing to strike over it
Endless Eight managed to *destroy* one of the most successful anime properties of the 2000s
Millhi please
Endless Eight, Symphogear edition
I'm not holding my breath
but
I actually wouldn't be surprised if we got Satelight Parallel Works kind of thing
The joke's fine, I just want to make sure there's absolutely zero ambiguity that *acting* on the joke isn't okay
<@440138597539119114> if you willfully and intentionally ignore a user's polite request with the intention to annoy, irritate, or harass them it's violating server rules to not be a dick
is cold
I didn't get the impression they were stuck inside them
Hibiki's having a 1 v 3 fight and the other 5 girls are just sitting in the dirt combing their hair or something
and badly written
really weird
The other 5 characters sitting quietly in the corner with Amalgam gears felt
he's not cocky enough to put everyone at risk just to pull a stunt
Genjuro takes actions in emergencies
Mazinger ones, specifically
There were so many Mecha references
Maybe he can, but do you think he's willing to risk a bullet in Elfnein's brain that he can?
*so do the people pointing guns at SONG*
tomosato has combat training but one of the things y'all are kind of forgetting is
I hope they don't do that
honestly him being surprisingly strong felt like a setup to reveal he really is a custodian <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
which zoid's been tossing around
it's either because he still keeps up his warrior training or it's because he's secretly a fucking god
but still
w > v > b I mean I can see how they got there
AUFBACHEN
whoever has that blood
guess who noble red has to listen to
All the blood's been collected in one spot
it's only dropping pretenses if they name him
he's working other people and getting them to make moves
he's not
It's fudou, but you all are saying fudou's dropping pretenses
She's shown working out and then never has muscles in any other shot
lmaoooooooooooo
T, worse game in the series?
for the compressed explosion
It actually makes sense to try to enclose them near each other
who said they were dumped at the edges
I knew it was a maze as soon as the blocks started falling
*Aoi* was referencing jojo
Okay gear wasn't referencing jojo
~~testament~~
or busy with noise
stunned or something
usually they pretend to be like
<@279341087494242304> "oh hibiki's having a 3v1 fight, let's sit here in our bubbles and have popcorn"
we're gonna attack the moon <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
6 is going to be where we have a climax so we can expand scope, I think
Adam voiced like everything
like, tits are good but it felt out of place
bad
The tit thing was
It's possible it could happen episode 7
calling it now
Basa vs Hibiki climax fight of episode 6
the only use is as a bomb
what's the fucking point
or they'll have blood sickness
ability that they can't seemingly use for more than like 5 minutes
presumeably so people get trapped inside?
giant fuckall labyrinth, right?
that
I just want to note
Ver aint in the fucking stone
we're dealing with things *in the stone*
Anyway we're not dealing with things in a "psyche"
no
ah
"we're going to have an indefinite delay and by indefinite we mean one episode"
fast
that's
did fire force resume
wait
the actual source
what why
Aphrodite A
Do you mean Ignite or Berserk?
things don't have to line up
space compression is going on
Yeah I mean
a mecha attack that only exists in the audio drama and game versions is going too niche
I think buster home run is too obscure a reference
it's coming to PC so it'll probably be pirateable now if they refuse to put it on english storefronts
the simple triangle kick she did in episode 1
not Super Inazuma Kick
solo did you know SRW gave use Gunbuster doing Inazuma Kick
the closest we got to that was the momentary flash to blind
I don't think we're getting eye lasers
that's an old mecha reference
you got the boomerang wings
I mean
here's what it looked like in the 70s
Mazinger Z
from the first ever piloted giant robot show
It's a similar term to alloy
for the record
Amalgam's what you put in your teeth
Amalgam's a much better name than ignite for the record
sangelmon wasn't in the OP was she
Yeah I kind of think no one else is getting much of the spotlight with Amalgam
please no
or even Cag! She got along with fucking nobody
I will be so mad if someone has a character bonding moment with *prelati*
afdadfsdf
is good joke
XDU is a horrible idea done for fanservice
It'd be like reviving Kanade, a horrible idea done for fanservice
it's gone
Miku wearing Gungnir
or
Brand new Gear
I don't know why people would *want* SSJ to come back when the alternative is one of two things
it is never coming back
because that's what it does
SSJ could probably destroy the god power bracelet
Like
it's too narratively strong
SSJ will never come back
üò¨
it felt like the safest possible "symphogear" plot
I remember not really getting engaged on AXZ too firmly because it just never felt like it was taking risks with the writing
it's full of "uh?" moments
but going back and looking at it knowing everyone's ultimate goals
G is an awesome ride the first time through
s1 holds strong
the other seasons feel weaker on the rewatch
but it's not rare
I wouldn't say it's a universal opinion or anything
Absolutely serious, s1 was the best season in every single aspect except animation quality
Tsubasa might deliver
but we'll see
It needs a really good character arc to beat s1 imo
unless you're doing a string of monster of the week, midseason's when you step up
I don't think we're getting calm at 6-7
maybe some of them were striking the day of filming <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they were just quiet
but we didn't get a peek at them until after
or something
or tired
maybe they're stuck
like
SONG stands quietly in the field while Hibiki 3v1s
dropped into tiny minor roles
she was huge and then just
did she have a scandal?
what the fuck happened to her?
girl empowerment isekai
let's go back to inuyasha
but yes, the industry wouldn't magically be better without it
there isn't really a substantive difference between isekai harem trash and generic harem trash
I wanna say sword art online ruined anime but it'd be bad even if isekais weren't everywhere so
oh she's younger
dess_.. timeline
Serena would be like what, 25? 26?
Kanade's hair would fill a stadium
maybe if they ever do xdu ovas
I mean SSJ or Serena don't get updates either do they
Hibiki has a different design, Genjuro has a different design
but it's a different design
like, Tsubasa's pre-skip gear is on screen for like, what, maybe 60 seconds?
a lot of effort for something you don't really get to see much of
s1 was actually really good at really minor character design changes that really sell the 2 year timeskip
<:llennDisappointed:432399986630590474>
or however old she was
yeah he looks like a normal dude almost when he's talking to 10 year old kanade
Genjuro existing has made it really hard to asses how much a normal human is capable of if they just *try*
warrior shit
also fudou probably trains every fucking day
probably more like 6 or 7
I expect we'll be scaling up from "fudou, the master politician" by episode 8 at the *latest*
I mean
I don't think he'd be crazy about japan if he was straight up original custodian
I find this one unlikely
or fudou, if he's somehow an ancient pure custodian
Is the bracer still fully activated or did the sequence get fucked with
they have to be freed before song can not lay low
yeah but you jumped over that part
thing
shooting their friends in the back of the head
aside from the whole
I think basa will leave SONG to join fudou ep 6 and hibiki will fight her ep 7
It's definitely still different
If you want to see old ideas applied to digital animation see redline
You also need to go back to celluoid which we're never doing
Lmao otaking
Bless you <:ChibiBikki:391790930593579009>
Do you have that as a larger gif  <@142136901602770944>
They wanted to cut back
It's why gundam 00 s2 units look way different than s1
The more detail the worse it is on the animators and the longer it takes
It's animation cost
Armados the problem isn't problematic design
The v2s would never be approved for animation anyway
Honestly I think I prefer what we got in the anime - though, let's be honest
It looks terrible but so did her other robe
WHEW
I do want to keep the server from being too bloated but archived channels are easily hidden I suppose
I have no idea! Probably not? But you never know
<#351966524887793675> is actually still archived but set to invisible, not entirely sure why but maybe I'll look into it
*about a month after XV ends
still visible
and then it'll be archived
about a month
It'll stay up until the spoiler blackout is over
we're in february of the year after AXZ
17
A noble tradition since the early 70s
Oppai missile!
Song spends most of it's time docked to what I assume is some sort of naval Base with a healthy coptor contingement
Shell probably be kidnapped for bracer within two eps
Oh yes now I remember miku
Hidden
Even though GX definitely should have had argetlaim
S1's the only season to have a shift
But it'd be cool
I don't expect any
Yeah probably
Pretty sure he'll go along as long as a 11 year old girl has a gun to her head
This is the Japanese government forcefully intervening
This isn't the UN changing song
They don't have the authority
I hope they leave it there
<:Germain:421434126856486912> being in the stone made sense
I kinda hope the saint Germaine thing is a one off trick
lol
They're not retiring that any time soon
Metanoia's getting a gigantic publicity push because Nana single
The second op was just the next verse of the original op
I miss gaogaigar
I'd say new things might get added to the opening but we're not likely to see a major overhaul
Less than 5%
Opening song?
Yeah
?
<:KirikaSpook:602224871585480776>
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
is fun stuff
nanjo doing numbers
I thought I heard somewhere that there's a convention that ken typically applies to single bladed or dull blades
doesn't tsubasa normally use single bladed swords
imo
tsubasa's genre is just a hard sell
tsubasa
her season 1 song is great
in terms of genre/feel
though maria feels a little all over the place
absolutely
every season has at least one
First Love Song
and used well
and amazing
because *those* are all good
Are we counting the centerpiece tracks like Radiant Force, Hajimari no Babel, Gekkishou Infinity, etc, in "unison songs"
"k, here's new song"
while the other unison songs are just
also the DMJii ones have setup between their A-sides
the first one is the most special because it's novel, but the others are always a nice warm feeling
all the DMJii ones are great
I think what I liked least about them was that they replaced the A sides
~~I keep wondering why everyone keeps praising change the future, because it fell completely flat to me, but it's probably just a brain taste thing~~
I didn't like them that much
it's basically "it's like music, but with extra random noise"
because *especially* the way symphogear used it
the worse it's going to sound to new viewers
the longer it's been since it's been culturally "popular"
but the further we go in time
of course not
but now that dubstep's kind of dead, it just seems even worse
it wasn't really a good dubstep mix in the first place
ignite is aging horribly
also
it's not that they're bad so much as it's a wasted opportunity to be good
and yes the ignite versions were a waste of a chance to do something cooler
memory's kicking in now
ah, yeah, okay
I don't think even bikki has sung a b side since G
We would have if ignite wasn't a thing, pretty sure
no
oh
monochrome
yeah
some characters only got to sing their a-side like once
AXZ was the worst at this
I just miss the strong attachment of song  to character we haven't really had since G
They're a way for Fudou to be doing things without doing things
They've established strong character arcs for both Hibiki and Tsubasa
They're obviously not the big bad, but big fights happening doesn't make the smaller fights irrelevant
Nah, they're going to be relevant
XV is so absolutely miles better handled than AXZ so far
so it would be hard for them to have an ideology
prelati had no character and cagli also had no character besides a one line note in her design sheet "fucks, probably"
"hi im hibiki and i've never had a bf, what if you didn't????"
"I HAVE TO KIDNAP/KILL YOU"
this was basically the whole Hibiki vs Chris thin in s1
Millaarc's totally going to die in the process of all this so the writers don't have to redeem her yet leave Bikki's spirit pure, yes
at least now we are befriending the mass murderers as god intended
Prelati tries to save her sister while SONG's fucking *execution* squad drops in
Prelati's fight was actually a really cool idea but the baggage behind it messed it up yeah
just like "yay we win fuck them!!"
and more weird that it *wasn't a big deal*
that they killed
I thought it was less weird
you can sit here and go "WELL ACTUALLY IF YOU WERE GENRE AWARE YOU'D HAVE KNOWN" but since you're sitting here looking back I think it's a little unfair
in AXZ they were *very clearly* implied to die, and Symphogear's never done a "lol dumbass I tricked you" fakeout to that point
Armados I think it's a little unfair to say "if you'd pay attention"
also yeah "girls go all out and fucking murder an alchemist and high five each other at the end" felt *fucking weird*
choreographed to be fun for me?
that even with all the flashy aesthetics it just wasn't
but I felt like that for a lot of AXZ?
I agree in that the fight didn't really do it for me
singing softer isn't underperforming, it's just that Chris' metal-adjacent genre requires her to go hard usually
Leiur still makes me mad
??(kaiju sister that is never explained)
which explains why she looks like a mess
Micha was one of the first, iirc?
Maria's arc in G was good but I wish she wasn't given redemption because the only decision she ever put backbone into the whole season was "maybe I should let Ver abuse us and kill people instead of listen to DMJii"
Fine's plan was good in the broad strokes but a lot of the political details were stupid - also her plan was rushed at the end
please remember you can have good tactics and someone can still be better than you
but his plan was shit
his tactics are ok
he'd send in SSJ to wreck havoc at the right time
he'd rig anti-linker in prep
like
but his *tactics* were decent
negative strategic sense
Ver had like
actually okay
val verde's commanders in AXZ had some okay tactical ideas for all of the 20 seconds they weren't fucking outclassed
not tactical
carol was strategic
ignored
both SSJ and Zababa have outright confessions that just get
they even made fun of that in the shinai
it clearly *doesn't fucking count*
we did that
please don't have "I love you" in song form
and then she sings a version of hibiki's s1 song
miku using hibiki's pendant to save hibiki is my dream
yeah
SG's probably actually got a fragment of her soul in the Gear, but I think the other two are just mental constructs
G?
where are you getting serena from
I hope it's not apple ~~because it sucks~~
tbh I wasn't that impressed with it either
oh, yeah, fair
but they could have been buddies
It was probably their version of Solomon who did, in parallel with binding demons
G makes it maybe a little less likely but not impossible
In season 1 I felt it was very very possible she did
I'm curious why you're so confident she didn't make them
I mean
She was a high priestess right around the time they were used as weapons
Or maybe she always had access to it
there's really no way to be *sure*
the other points in history could either be a natural phenomenon or other times Fine woke up
because the only notable event that happens 10 years prior is Tsubasa activating Ame no Habikiri for the first time
well, the ones in the last 10 years are clearly her
but she also takes out targets of opportunity (SSJ, Nehushtan)
The primary reason they've been showing up is to be a constant natural disaster to cause section 2 to get massively more funding so she can build up the HQ/Kadingir
but it's clear she can let noise into the world *somehow* that's not the cane
so we have no idea how she does it or how fine her control is in summoning or anything
HOWEVER, via Chris/Fine we learn that the Cane's only been activated for the last 6 months
which puts the start right around the time Fine wakes up in Ryoko
but Hibiki in her homework learns that they've only been really appearing constantly in the last 10 years
We know the noise pop up occasionally through history, and someone (ryoko, maybe) theorized it was a natural phenomenon and there's really no way to say that does or doesn't happen
Okay so to elaborate on this
share in <#357682999300718592> when you're done
nice!
"Hey tsubasa, love your work, can you sign my hostage"
clearly she's just a fan
the question is whether the writers will forgive millaarc
people who do terrible things in real life frequently have motivations that are not "be fucking evil"
you can be sympathetic and do terrible things
that said
I have a feeling we'll see Millaarc die before the end of the season so she doesn't get the opportunity for "redemption"
but "definitely confirmed" is a step I don't think we can take
It's very probably true that he did
it isn't
no
a stray lamb
rather than just
hopefully the show treats her that way
very bad person without doing it for arbitrarily evil reasons
I think millaarc is a fantastic villain
like Zababa in G
We could get a really spicy battle duet
I don't know
because we'd have gotten the transformation
they wouldn't have done the tease though
I think Basa is probably going to defect away from SONG and the song will play during her big reunion/double cross?
not in this context I don't think it is
a generic magical girl
it's
yeah honestly
doesn't have to be much more than that
1-2 episodes as OVA sounds great
as I said
it isn't
except, of course
but they wouldn't be crazy about it except that it's just more symphogear content
they'd see it, sure
most *symphogear* fans don't care about utazukin all that much
it was a low risk project
the difference is remaking the first season of nanoha was an easy sell and people were *easily* sold on "we're going to make the first season, except good"
it's not a success story waiting to happen
utazukin wouldn't be successful just because it's utazukin
in the same order of magnitude, at least
*about* the same cost as a season
movies are
a full anime feels like a mistake and a flop waiting to happen
a single episode of utazukin would be great, kind of like the shirobako OVAs
annoyed, once again, at AXZ just brushing past the 'deaths' of the alchemists
god
but there's a few others that could work
I think that would be the best way
I want hibiki to offer redemption and millaarc refuse it
so third from the bottom
even with redemption arc she'll still be less boring than adam
idk
blue ranger girl
but illegally, they're all on nyaa
illegally yes, legally I don't actually know
and then we have several weeks to wait until Tsubasa
Maria's is next week
Yeah
CDs have been releasing for XV once a week
For?
for better or for worse
GX and AXZ were really defined by the CD gimmick of the season
on two characters at a time who had nothing in common
AXZ wasn't arcy it just did half-assed focus episodes
1/5th
probably more like
well
the other half was Shirabe
She had half of an episode
Maybe even 5 times because fuck if I remember what her arc in AXZ was
4 times now
the same conflict
or we wouldn't get
They've already showed they don't actually care about Tsubasa's progress as a character
I don't think Kaneko has it in him
WHEW
if genjuro goes he'll probably die and she'll take command of song
End of 3 yeah
*everyone* knows this
noble red are not antagonists who can carry the season
we'll need new enemies regardless
the fact that everyone else got Amalgam designs too makes me doubt that
we'll... see
too noisy, too big, too overscaled
for every fight
too much
and the fists are
it might be
but judging how they handled ignite
anyway I hope this won't be the combat form we see hibiki in most of the time
they come from the back of her neck
the fists are a scarf
they do an okay job of show don't tell but they still do most of the worldbuilding *outside* the show
https://symphogear.blogspot.com/2014/03/symphogear-keyword-compendium.html here are examples of s1 keywords
the long story short is Alchemical energy changed the gears (because that's what alchemy's good at) and now they do an unexpected thing
We'll probably learn more when the keywords get translated
apparently now that they have the energy of the philosopher's stone in them, they can basically activate a faust robe *on top* of the gear, giving a Amalgam form
so they basically forcibly infused the gears with it, and rather than X-Drive, they got the Rebuilt forms (burning out dainsleif in the process to use it as a fuse to keep the *relic* from burning out)
the problem is, in GX they were dealing with phonic gain, so it was easy, because the relics ran on it, but here they were using alchemical energy from the spellcaster
the initial plan was to try to copy the GX finale to use the energy to kickstart X-drive
yeah to cap off what everyone was saying
the answer is probably not because it was really not obvious she even used x-drive ignite
hey remember x-drive ignite and how it was used to do the amazing job of flying slightly faster to catch someone falling at terminal velocity
*MUGEN PUNCH*
I want hibiki to mugen punch
he had a picture of the flight crew iirc
eh, something like that
the guy who was in the shuttle landing in GX
the guy who fed them info on Gungnir's going to be relevant
I'm really hoping
I guess Carol's the biggest exception but Carol's kind of a question mark for a while
Even Ver wasn't out as a villain until at least the end of 2
The *actual* villains are always low-key
we didn't see Fine until about episode 5
he's human
lmao
Vanessa's probably going to have a superattack that destabilizes herself
`Her body is held together by a high-density energy field not unlike the one used to form the Symphogears and Faust Robes, but unlike those she is able to maintain it indefinitely.
On the other hand, her output isn't quite as high as that of the Faust Robes, and as such the technology was dismissed from becoming a formal outfit for alchemists.`
ah, yeah, Elsa's the strategic and tactical genius of the group according to the keywords
I'd have thought they'd go with "Vanessa's the brains behind everything" but apparently that's not the case
This is interesting that Elsa's the one who came up with it
`In an attempt to compensate for this flaw, Noble Red (particularly Elsa) began to use the labyrinth as a confined space to compress energy into as a form of attack.
This technique is dubbed "Daedalus End."`
nice
aside from that it's probably nothing special from a writing perspective
"Same gears, bigger numbers"
which is
therefore it's much less shit than ignite
it's a power up that gives them different equipment than normal
one ghost is enough
thank god
looks like we won't be getting character introspectives for the others
fuck you, season 1, I guess
Hibiki now has an armed gear
well
"high output armed gear"
I wouldn't mind a hail sakimori <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
we'll get something better
alcanoise aren't really dramatic enough I think
sorry to break it to you
7.31
it even says
out
it's uh
there's no reason to expect consistency with the AXZ events but there also could be
I have honestly personally given up any hope of anticipating how the fuck the divine power will act in play
symphogear literally has the SEP field
oh my god
`A mysterious barrier that functions to keep people away by diverting their consciousness, making something appear as if it does not exist.
It not only affects human consciousness, but also interferes with direct signals sent by machines.
One of the many secrets Germany kept during the war, it's possible that it made its way to Japan due to their alliance with Germany.`
üò¶
I missed the text on screen
or crazier shit like R2rY
rr'' or R1r or R0R0
Actual rh factor typically looks like
I don't think it's implausible, as long as you think it's possible some dude with the last name of Soil made the discovery
it's a made up term, afaik, so it's not like there's a *wrong* way?
'fixed'
I mean
SOMEONE
the flames alone should have gotten
tsubasa not killing anyone is just proof that kaneko's a bleeding heart
that was new
she did use heaven's wrath to slice in axz
tsubasa gets a new attack every season I think, but maybe not axz
nothing else matters
elfnein sang
anything shaft
well
THE DUCKS

we're *on* the arc
miku's getting kidnapped or otherwise rendered unable to finish the discussion with hibiki
they've now actually fought
we are started on the miku arc
what do you mean solo
It's probably the inspector
Her Girlfriend: "Kirika, it's smart people time, don't jump in" "oh"
it'll probably be on one of the BD bonus discs
elfnein probably isn't getting a b side
<@476058996315389953> SHE SANG
but it was good
I still think Hibiki's transformation was better
Shirabe telling her to be quiet because smart people were talking
"oh"
"Kirika the smart people are talking"
there we go, had to get rid of the spoiler
whoops
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
It was me
probably, anyway
the inspector got killed
miku's fine
<@279341087494242304> it's just a karaoke thing in general, tsubasa did it in s1
so she can be all 3 Bigs from Big O
wonder when we're getting propellers to fly with
if, in fact, that's why they're there
but they could have also chosen to have melting snowmen
anyway it's possible they could have done some other way to cover it up
Madoka got delayed like a month because of the tsunami
the episode can't get shorter
because you still have airtime
it's either that or delay for 6 months
they *absolutely* would
they absolutely would
oh
but it's *possible*
I'm not sold on it
do you think if we hadn't had the KyoAni tragedy a few weeks ago, we might have seen people instead of snowmen
<@279341087494242304>
so
here's your answer as to whether any heroine will have a bad ending
and yeah, solo
no casualties
6 blocks engulfed in flames
keeping him alive was what enabled the chateau to fire in the first place
counterpoint:
I'd hang up the pendant rather than help him live after that
I fucking wouldn't
would you defend him if you were FIS
not only is the Chateau in play but we're kidnapping Elfnein presumeably because she's carol
guess where Ver's body is
Chateau's in play
honestly
very possible
Ver appearing is
fire damage in general is kind of a touchy thing
or something
maybe they were melting cars
it's also possible it was just never in the cards to have Nana kill anyone
I'm pretty sure it was in GX
üëå
Vanessa's telepathic call sound
speaking of which
<@289013001632350208> please don't use terms like 'retard' here
I mean it's pretty obvious to me from these 5 episodes that XV was sketched out very roughly when they did AXZ and then they filled in the details and wrote character arcs much later after AXZ was done
but clearly it's not what we're getting
I'd really hoped that AXZ and XV being greenlit at the same time would make them two parts of a whole
she will
so yeah, if grandad can establish that he has legal rights to order her
I mean this episode established that tsubasa is a cop and believes in the letter of the law above the concept of justice
No I don't think so
<:elfsix:385723661119651860>
Shirabe's was so classy and calm I loved it
<:shirapout:579426690237988885> kiri-chan, *complicated matters are being discussed*
<:shirapout:579426690237988885> üó°
it's the same reason the transformer films were a mess
but the gear actually forming on her is so dynamic you can't see shit
The revolver spinning is awesome
I'd put it more likely she decapitated herself for some weird reason than miku
Yeah it's a pretty blatant fakeout
it's too noisy
yeah, probably
it's good
people avoid this channel if they want to avoid the latest episode details
but generally
uh, spoiler tags with || at either end of what you want to say
millhi pls
>blaming kaneko for animation mistakes
and I'm glad they *finally* brought that up
hibiki went to the concert on her ticket
she's already traumatized
glad she did though
yeah I have no idea why she moved from machine pistols to revolvers
the philosophy behind the progression of the season just feels too different
maybe, but XV's giving me the vibe that most of the work on it (even writing and design wise) wasn't done until after AXZ
yes!
a thing
that was
Shirabe ain't all that flat, since apparently she can fucking ramp yoyos off the underside
if only we knew when saturday came
The difference is that AXZ was made with the *knowledge* that there'd be a next season
when AXZ aired
I bet Noble Red didn't even have concept art yet
but, for example
Rebuilt Gears being the best example
they did absolutely design *some* stuff in AXZ with the intent of XV
I mean
gen and yatsuhiro are the most killable
I'd say the shows that tried to get closest to gear's music action scenes were Revue Starlight and AKB0048
it was the first *piloted* robot
mazinger was not the first robot of anime
not so, some are tetsujin references
I *think* so
she does in fact obari pose I am 80% sure
using the sword from blue flash
tsubasa does have one of those iirc
there's nothing wrong with using stock footage
*miku duckie*
did you see
Lily
there seems to be a lot of small production hitches but the product's going pretty well so far
yeah, I guess
if they're both combat tracks
Is it possible they're holding back for the B-side
Do they only make stuff for shows they're directly part of?

Good Smile Company
Is there some deal embargo I'm unaware of?
Is there some reason GSC *hasn't* touched Symphogear since s1?
Yeah uh
I like how you phrase it so it is still her being horny even with the "explaination"
Ignite was 6, yes
they'd have needed no powerups at any time
Honestly, if they just dropped references to old seasons the entire way through while executing a climax plot
hibikei
hebiko
This one's really good yeah
Alchemists were around just fine for AXZ
most ruthless little girl
Nanoha never bothers trying to be fair
I take that back
Also see Nanoha
yeah I've been liking XV's songs much more than most of AXZ/GX
Like, the song was clearly made for Kirika's voice, but this is still good and your technique is good
<@184766091363352576> this is really good
and it probably won't even affect what time it goes up on crunchy
I wonder if Serena could actually show up as a ghost - not through Amalgam so much as through Argetlaim
hm
Japanese got an extra alphabet literally for the peasants/women
I mean
the more levels of school you go through, the more you learn
some of it
but it's neat what they do with it
so it's not something I'm huge on
furigana only exists because the japanese written language is inherently classist
I mean
furigana play is an interesting phenomenon
beat me to it because 8 megs wasn't loading fast
I don't think this is "fudou can't know about this"
I don't think they're turning on fudou right now
the fact we didn't hear vanessa's message makes millaarc very unlikely to die
<:sadmiku:432799416227725312>
the only kisses in symphogear are used to kill people
be careful to not trip over idolmaster links
that's the point, they're just bait to get you to watch
preview images are given without context
I do think Kanade's revival is a little unlikely from a meta perspective of Minami as a seiyuu
even the inspector
poor elfnein would react in horror at anyone being killed
I still think she's not being put into danger at all
otherwise the whole argument arc they were setting up falls flat
the only way miku can be killed is if miku can be revived

one of the more famous enemy mobile suits from gundam, the MS-09 Dom, was directly referenced this episode by Vanessa's movement technique
as a fun mecha history lesson
So
The inspection's been thrown out
DOM AND GUNBUSTER
VANESSA'S REFERENCES THIS EPISODE
YO SPEAKING OF
Maria's actually being useful
that was fun
or an ancient war
an x-ray machine's purpose is to see people's insides, but you can just give someone cancer with it instead if you feel like it
Its purpose and what it can do are two different things
yeah
but not itself
it'd be weird if the SSJ could destroy any relic
they don't have anything *established* to cleanse it
no
but I could see it happening
I'm not putting my chips on this bet
<@152896851660505088> obviously by purging her or having some sort of corrupted outcome or something, who knows
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but maybe they'd do a huge reach for Tsubasa for the sake of a final fight
yeah I don't think we'll get it for everyone
as Final Boss
what if we get GodTsubasa
And she also had a buster collider
apple
<@398201668338057216> technically we got a new song
Maybe it's rebuilding disguised as careful disassembly
tell me that's not jigglypuff
jigglypuff
hibiki is #1 I think
you don't do that without stamina
have you seen how she runs around and dances at concerts?
basa's fit
what
unless gravure idols
all idols are fit
banned I say
ver is banned
no
I'm not aware we were ever comparing body shapes
yeah
in terms of fitness
I don't see how that's relevant to your choice to use it here
I'd appreciate if we didn't just do edgy memes for the sake of bring edgy
I was trying to figure out why noble red needed the antikythera gear and it took me forever to remember the music of the spheres machine
The ultimate Thanos snap
Miku is going to replace everyone with a copy of hibiki
10 minutes of vague threat
AOL instant messenger
Outside of Apple
It happens in am early season
I think it was Fine?
It was referred to by Fine as well
I mean "Lulu amel" should have made you go "wait what" back in G
Something is going on with Maria but I think it's the key to a puzzle we haven't encountered yet
Miku is obviously going to get the power at some point but it doesn't have to be *now*
Autoscorers are without sin
They were clearly doing something with autoscorers parts
There's another option for a divine vessel
Americans will be involved when we get to the rocket arc
Millaarc vs Tsubasa will happen with the sides reversed
Doing a literal barrel roll over a missile with no ramp????
The bunshin was the least impressive thing ogawa did with a car this episode
Going to be real here
It was probably stomped on
It was bent in half
The phone was clearly damaged beyond just fell out
She feels like a real person
Millaarc is wonderful to watch
And was surprised when they seemed to already know
I was expecting that
Honestly
Though its worth noting Elsa seems to be all around smarter than her
We don't have a timeframe for how long ago Vanessa was a researcher
Correct
This is something keywords are going to have to fill me in on or I'm never really going to be comfortable with it
Maybe, but then how do noble red know? Why would he tell them? Them taking Miku makes sense because hostage for elfnein, but they seemed to already know she could be a vessel when elfnein blabbed like a doofus
They'd have to figure it out separately
Yeah
The way ogawa and genjuro talked about it made me think it's not even really recorded in official files because it's just a *theory*, so how would fudou know?
As far as I'm concerned, noble red knowing about Miku is currently a plothole
Lulu amel appear *somewhere* in symphogear before xv besides in apple
Oh was it Adam who name-dropped it
They struck me as an alien forerunner/seeder race
Solo if they gave us an inazuma kick everyone would just say "it's a rider kick lol"
Even though gun/diebuster are my favorite mecha shows
Honestly the Dom one was my favorite
It's pretty strong
Just realized it
Vanessa has Zeong hands
Fuck
Apple felt to me like it was always meant to be plot relevant
My fanon failed autoscorer makes more sense now
Hmm
It's a different cut isn't it
<@152896851660505088> probably different animators without time to coordinate
I'm a little surprised we've never gotten an itano circus in gear
Anyway on the subject of mecha I really liked Vanessa's Zeong attack
It's trashy and gross
Content warning
Valvrave has a ||2 minute on screen rape scene for shock value, and the raped girl gets into it by the end and has a crush on the protagonist/rapist from then on||
It's absurd for the point of cliffhangers rather than to construct a plot
S2
More like Geass sw
That show shouldn't be homaged by anyone
Valvrave references are banned <:elfsix:385723661119651860>
<@279341087494242304> which would be tastier: Tsubasa vs Hibiki But For Real, or Fudou Tsubasa vs SONG Millaarc
Matt Damon plays Kazanari Tsubasa as Jason Bourne
Miku is a scorpio
Functions as a celestial computer
Again
Who
They used it to power tiki
Unless they did in xdu when the gear was stolen
They have never at any point talked about what it does in universe
Why did Ogawa find it at noble red's base? Because they were using it's abilities as a celestial computer to do the whole planetary harmony thing
Solo can we appreciate how kaneko has been using the antikythera mechanism correctly without ever acknowledging he knows what it does
(super inazuma kick is not though)
I mean, inazuma kick is a rider kick
Considering hibiki didn't need to learn gungnir's name
Interesting that the chant works with a totally made up name
We've known since the XV bios came out that something was funky
miku will help hibiki defeat the final boss
it's definitely not going to be miku, though
we still have to go to the moon
the second half of the show isn't going to look very much like the first half
I don't think the last boss is remotely predictable right now
I can't wait for XV to fucking end so we can add Noble Red emotes
just not impossible
I find the "Adaptor = lulu amel blood" unlikely, mind you
Maria, maybe, or all the Kazanaris, or maybe all gear users in general
I'd say there's a few possibilities
I mean if I had to guess
I take it back, Adam *could* be it, but I doubt it
adam is a prototype
adam is not humanity
adam is not it
very similar to the nephilim idea
a "superior" race to humans
they were the crossbreed of humanity and the anunnaki iirc
yes, it is
do you mean is it a real term?
What do you mean Nep
Nihilanth or something
it wouldn't be a sure hit
I think it could work but they'd have to put less budget into a next gen thing because yeah
speaking of Maria, XV's high animation quality is making the bad parts stick out all the more, and I really hope they polish up that horrible sidemouth she was doing this episode in the BDs
even though, of course, she had it down just fine
Tsubasa thought she had this whole "idol/sword" balance figured out, but is being told she fucked it all up
As much as Tsubasa wants Maria on her stage, she's never looked to her as a guidance figure
It shows she's breaking and losing her way, and is reverting back to her former guidepost to tell her what's right
and the SymphoMegazord is going to pull the trigger
Vanessa is going to turn into a giant gun
MASTER PUPPETEER
TONY GLAZER
I think the final antagonist in XV hasn't been introduced yet
gotta flex that nitro somehow
<@!102691114762371072> has the complement, as usual
ogawa would just backflip a car over thanos and use the car to pin his shadow down so he can't snap
you're just reminding me how disappointed I was at Shirabe's X-drive use in G
**Y E E T**
I really loved Godannar's
full episode epilogues are wonderful
"Or maybe I'm just saying shit to distract you and about to blast you in the face with a missile"
It's really kind of more like
"just kidding" isn't really a good translation exactly
the only reason we had such a ridiculous thing like "destroys any relic ever" is because they needed a sneaky way to cure bikki
it'd also be pointless
how could there be a tsubamari couple if one of the final fights ends with Maria driving airgetlaim's dagger through tsubasa's corrupt heart
https://twitter.com/SpWhiteBs/status/1158787958117261312
gimme a bit
yeah
she's even the main character
I don't know if she uses her millaarc voice there, but she's in there
Aimi's in bang dream
I mean
if solo likes it, you probably won't, ninryu
everyone else will find a happy ending, though I think some of them will retire
I think the only two people from a prior season who have a chance of dying here are Fudou and Genjuro
But, honestly
I'm pretty sure there'd be a riot in japan
which is to say, not very capable at all
she is equally capable in being a terrorist and fighting terrorism
and he's uhhhh
Obari was animation director of that
I don't know, I'd believe tekkaman blade was more referenced than you think
(the hell and heaven vacuum lock would be one of these - Chris was hit with a green tornado, by a character who uses nothing but green tornados, whoopie)
Anyway there's a *lot* of intentional references for sure, and a handful of what are probably false positives from coincidence of design
GGG turning gold isn't iconic, at least, not outside the specific context of goldion hammer
Anyway I do definitely agree that g Gundam would be way more relevant than ggg here
They clearly knew about the process to turn something into gold since the 3 phases of ignite were named after 3 of the 4 stages of transmutation
Transmuting into gold is one of the ultimate goals of alchemy, after all
Hibiki turning gold was the culmination of alchemy tidbits they'd been planting since gx
I don't deny it, but this wasn't an Easter egg
It's like claiming that orcs in 40k *must* be referencing Gundam because red ones go faster
*particularly* when your new power up is "literally wearing a philosopher's stone"
Point is it's not a big reach to come up with it yourself
It's more like an ugly yellow
Well
I think so? I know someone else does a gold thing
And no one claims kinship there
Especially since I think raideen did it
I don't think you can really claim that "turning all gold" is a surefire ref
I also agree getter 1 was a garbage reach
It's almost certainly more a reference to alchemy as hibiki has gone through the trans mutational steps
Some are bad like the hypermode claim
All the 3s aren't going to watch 4 seasons later
Sensible
Why, does MAL tend to vote on visuals alone
I'll never get it though
I'd like a 10 year skip montage
her willpower is always weak
I'm not writing that one off.
Kirika's thrusters?
probably not a tekkaman reference
the green glint?
like
kind of a popular animator to mimic
just claimed
me
that's from the acclaimed anime, Senki Zesshou Symphogear XV
shit's fucked, yo
the very last one is a stretch but I bet if you crawled through the show there are Tekkaman references
GGG's hell and heaven vacuum lock is probably a coincidence, pulling a blade from the chest is *probably* Mazinkaiser but there are other robots that did very similar moves, and I feel the four arm reference is probably convergent design rather than intentional, but who knows
Some of the tekkaman blade ones I have heavy suspicion on, especially the green glint on transformation
turning gold might be a reference to G Gundam, but I think it's a little sketchy to claim that it's probably a reference to that - it felt like it was more properly a part of the alchemical story they were telling, and even if it wasn't, I feel like saint seiya is the more.... likely reference
The getter reference is a joke
regarding the berserk scene, it's just too much like eva for me to dismiss - Left arm lost, animalistic crawling, jumping on enemy, regrowing the left arm. I didn't even catch the rings, that *might* be intentional considering they were thinking of evangelion when making the scene
this? this is obari and references to him
that's *absolutely* a reference, I was convinced of it when I saw G the first time
and if you mean the berserk thing for the eva one
Masami Obari is the animation director for Tekkaman Blade and he's homaged a lot
I actually think the kirika ones are somewhat credible
<@!279341087494242304> the mecha references is dreadfully incomplete and there's a few that are outright reaches rather than being "yes, this is a reference"
I appreciate your contrition, and am eager to see it demonstrated by your concerted effort to not do it again
I mean nanjo's not young
we're less likely to get Miku as Hibiki's angel on earth
but I'm sure all the hibimiku fanatics would scream
I wouldn't mind an ascension ending
I mean, real relationships don't typically need some huge crisis two people bond over to start
that means something
Tsubasa wanted her on stage with her
but not before then
I think they have chemistry in XV
I was very much not a fan of tsubamari before XV, but they're finally putting in the work they need to make it a seaworthy vessel
he pilots a robot that does attacks
because *Koji* doesn't really do attacks
I find it more likely than Koji, honestly
but like
I don't either
Terraformars (TV) as Ivan Perepelkina
Terraformars Revenge (TV) as Ivan Perepelkina
<@!279341087494242304> I think I found it
<@!279341087494242304> is there a chance it's from cardfight vanguard
but AXZ I'm not sure
which was Big Bang Punch
GX had the giant fist
hm
Z-hen was a brilliant way to throw a bunch of go nagai's ideas into a blender and have something pop out
Z-hen was fucking great
It is a little intrusive
chris doesn't dess
That's fair, do you mind not doing your OC monologues here, though?
haha
leiur's sister never talked, or was explained in any form
didn't talk a lot
leiur mumbled about being flashy

Also we get non-sexy faust robe carol, which is cool!
i cri
elfnein praising her girls
I'M IN HEAVEN
ALL THAT ELFNEIN DEVELOPMENT
XV is incredible
HOLY SHIT
Carol must have put it away when Hibiki caught her
I might have got the order backwards, eh
Episode 5
Carol had to step in
Micha got beaten by dmjii before they even got ignite, pretty badly
with her strategic and tactical mastery
Elsa could probably solo any given one of them
it'd have been an actual fight but I don't think the autoscorers would trounce
at full power
I actually don't think they'd be a match for noble red
nabe would be losing his shit
13
they're trying to stuff the power into an old autoscorer body
also
noble red isn't going to fold
lame
that was
can we talk about hibiki being donked out like a bitch
don't want to waste all that character development they're finally giving elfnein
with the Philo stone and s1 callback
I like how we got a bigger Kirika sequence
ALSO <@!279341087494242304> INAZUMA KICK HAPPENED
for Super Ver
they're putting the main power into ver
it's just excess power
no no it's not ver reborn
I don't see it likely
idk after AXZ had Kirika zesshou and then walk into the command room 5 minutes later doing just fine
I think Genjuro could die though
they've said as much
because they want happy endings
the show could kill someone off, but the writer/director would never do it
so big deal
her character development's been put on loop the past 3 seasons
I mean
carol put it back into Elsewhere space, clearly
they didn't age her up
what?
carol's back, elfnein's dead
about her building a new autoscorer
I really need to finish my elfnein story
they had no reason to be brought back at all
they did the autoscorers wonders
did them dirty?
I really hope we don't end up with SSJ gear
I really hope not
the custodians needed the moon to do the curse
but it's worth noting
we have no idea what having divine energy actually lets one do other than fire giant lasers and do the dimensional repair thing
why would godmiku be capable of applying the curse of balal to hibiki
every single manifestation of god energy we've seen is some grotesque giant thing
being a "god" in symphogearverse does not seem like being a "god" most places
for one
I still don't really think it's possible
I actually think we might see nephilim again
Ver chews too much scenery
Right now they've been really artistic about bringing old seasons back but still going ahead with XV as XV
Ver would do a lot to ruin the show
<@506219877724454929> please stop whining about madoka every time someone mentions it; they have the right to discuss the series on this server without you guilting them
imperfect
failed bodies
they were prototypes
Armados: these weren't brought back autoscorers
Carol pulled it out of Elsewhere with alchemy
> Chris turns into a gun
"let's stick buster collider on the end and make it crackle with electricity"
I love how they were like "how do we make sure we convey that this is an inazuma kick instead of a rider kick"
Full on yuri has trouble airing on most networks
please don't write "loli carol toys" and then follow it with an emote of someone licking their lips thank *you*
Micha's acrobatics I believe
Micha has a dance
next they'll discover the zodiac
yes, bravo, jojo also named things after tarot cards
elfnein might be referencing the magician
she was made to help build the chateau and to set up SONG to be used in carol's plan
there's no real way to be sure
She's anywhere from like 1.5 years old to decades
noble red's accomplished a ton for being a joke
more hibimiku fight to the death set-up you mean <:sadmiku:432799416227725312>

<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
headpat is a special command
so
emotes are really really tiny and there's a lot you can't make look good
speak for yourself
I've seen it happen
I don't think it's too soon
elfnein/carol duet
you know what's on the table as a possibility for next episode?
oh my god
yeah it's crazy
that said, inori is inori
possibly
even if Carol's in control with her fragmented self
I think the eyes are because elfnein's still there
elfnein also talks like a little kid in addition to having such a cutsey voice; they were probably afraid if they didn't go overboard on differences the visual similarities would confuse people not paying attention
and they needed to make sure they were kept distinct in the minds of the audience
They probably had different VAs because in GX, they're two very different characters with very different motivations and very different levels of sympathy they're trying to get from the audience
no
questionable
and yeah, saying it's not carol when it's clearly carol's voice actor is
they're narrowed like carol does
Why don't the eyes indicate carol
broadcasting restrictions can be, weird
I don't think they'll kiss

also, let me suggest that elfnein doesn't stop being elfnein just because she is now also carol
regardless of who she ends up as
if it's elfnein at the beginning of the sequence, it is, by definition, elfnein's transformation
god the opening to that song is so good
keep in mind that in-line emoji are only 22x22 and the larger ones are only 30x30
she's terrible for emotes due to a combination of contrast, not being on screen much, and not ever doing anything interesting

I'd recommend avoid sticking them in the middle of an intense combat sequence or anything but they're fine for exposition or slower scenes
I haven't, yet, checked YTT subs, but I will say in other subtitle works where I see them, I can *appreciate* good puns, but they also contain a danger of distracting me from the next half-second while I groan or chuckle or just focus on the words rather than the content <@152896851660505088>
why the fuck not
we had saint germain
still hoping for elfnein/carol duet
if you don't like the accusation, probably should work on that
"where do you see negativity here" is probably in the month or two that you've been here you've generally posted nothing but cynicism, for the record
but not both at once
I'm pretty sure we have at some point
why are we misgendering the kirika <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
I wonder how many surprise character albums we'll get
even if she does nothing else, that's enough
she already has a new song
yeah
there's always the theory that it's not *really* carol because her eye color didn't change
And, of course
but I'm glad elfnein's getting both closure and growth out of it
I think Carol's going to say her final goodbye this season, possibly even next episode
but a strong wind isn't going to light a tree on fire
A strong wind will make a forestfire explode
in GX she amplified her relic with phonic gain, I think - which makes her alchemy superpowered, but it's like...
Carol attempted the genocide of the human race, it's a little sketchy to just keep her around
I don't think the show is ready to answer the question of uh, "what do you do with someone who is both innocent and someone who is to be condemned when they share a body/mind"
perhaps more importantly
also
<@239893407122718721> very true but burning Carol off seems likely as a writing tool, as, frankly, Elfnein cannot be too good, too knowledgeable, or too skilled, as she's on the protagonist side and everyone loves an underdog
Anyway that's all I really wanted to say, was that you had that as an opportunity to work on
but one can do those things without being a wet blanket
It's fine to critique, it's fine to criticize
is that *really* "Barely being here"
If you're here only once a week, but that once is the most active time each week (episode release day)
About you, by name.
I've received several user complaints that you make this channel unpleasant to be in to the point that they now avoid it.
Do you mind working on it?
üò¶
*arifureta has bad everything
there are worse shows to be
They need to do it in a way that doesn't minimize or undo what Kirika did, though
I'd love it
which is a big order
If they can satisfyingly explain her coming back
fight against godbaby - bored, everything after the eyecatch - FREAK
it'd be this one
if any episode was a gaijin 4koma
yeah like
goddamn even just rewatching the whole "suddenly autoscorer" gets me and this is my 4th time seeing it
the episode only really starts then
because let's be honest
I skipped ahead to the phara reveal
and that always feels like cheating
I feel like it'd be 90% custom parts
Would it really be that good
Of note is Victory Gundam, which is a mass-produced robot made of 3 pieces - top, legs, and cockpit- and they'd just send out a new torso or legs if the pilot got them blown up ~~or suicided them into an enemy~~
bionicle came a little late to science fiction to claim credit for that idea
any other kind of android/cyborg with replacable parts
or
I do want to advise against putting puns in sentimental moments, but maybe that's just my tastes
I don't know whether this episode makes my in-progress fic of "elfnein builds an autoscorer to try to prove carol's work wasn't all bad" better or worse in terms of how it fits in lore - it's set after GX, before AXZ
It's not clear what limits alchemy has
yeah, can't depend on that
OH WAIT GX was the season I used horrible subs for
I don't think I saw that line ü§î
It has never been implied that Carol replaced her body before but it's an easy guess
where characters can look like they're moving forward without ever changing
instead we got a bunch of anime filler feel good character treadmill plots
I think there's a really strong story of dichotomy and light and shadow in GX that they could have told but didn't
to help herself destroy the world
Carol would use her own desire to stop what she was doing
this would also make Elfnein be a gullible plant who would totally help the heroes convincingly
I interpreted Elfnein as kind of a drop-box Carol specifically shoved all the super sweet memories into, so she could burn them first and stay on the path of evil even though she knew it was wrong
(it's a little murkier post-GX)
but they're not the same person
they are based on the same template and share a common source of memories
I'd argue they're not the same person
yeah that's obscure enough I'm cool with it
I regret that it's needed
<@!476058996315389953> I don't want to be a downer but do you mind changing it <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
as much as I love it
actually debating on whether it's violating spoiler policy <:ElfneinThink:605194207166070794>
I'm uhhhhhhhhh
I'm expecting Carol to burn away the parts that make Carol Carol and leave Elfnein behind
here Elfnein calls dad and lets him know she's going to be late and could he pick her up and that's the only time we really see them after the eyecatch
cut out all the gears altogether
where an entire half of the show just
I actually don't think we've had an episode of symphogear before
yeah pretty much
He added a tiny bit to GX but him being in AXZ was awful and took away elfnein's chance to have an arc
but might as well watch the autoscorers again
I was going to just have the episode open to get that line
that does help thank you
Okay so does anyone have any idea what this line is talking about
<@486087033652248576> SSJ's headgear was #1 when closed, but like, #8 when open
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I don't think aya has skipped anything
f
anyway yes a lot of Big Shit happens in episode 7 aya and you should try to watch it asap if you want things to remain a surprise
<:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
and I will spoil you
Aya you come into the spoiler channel with that
how dare
best unit in the game is hibiki
luckily
but
balance sucks
it's better than the worst SRWs, not as good as the best
it's okay
eh
now she's in high heels!!
her trip still got miku captured though
noble red can't die before vanessa does this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv7cW_ijtQQ
She probably has to burn memories to store memories
it can't
so the reasonable answer is
this is "plot hole" big if that could happen
okay yes but
and it's a limited time afair
there must be a massive investment cost to storing memories
because with that kind of idea carol should have been like, unbeatable
it's not good enough
no no no
burn your memories, reupload, burn them again
*copy* energy
you can just
that's  a violation of thermodynamics
if carol's memories are power
there is a problem with that
I mean
elfnein's outfit was pretty horny and she had some horny dialogue
yeah, that's my guess
she got older so they wouldn't feel bad about attacking a child
The first time, remember
she just likes it
but more likely
she might not need to hold part of her power to keep her young
She might be able to cut loose more like that, regarding carol
remember that carol's body is also a homunculus
unknown
this episode felt *very strongly* like a sendoff
but I don't think we'll get them back in an appreciable way
I guess there's a possibility for using an army of shitty broken garies, michas, leiurs, and pharas as cannon fodder swarmers and I wouldn't write that out
not when you're trying to astound
You don't repeat surprise tricks
"oh look they can come back infinitely yawn"
not during the show
they won't do it
it'd be fucking boring to have them come back
while that's true
outside
in a flashback while they talked about how great it was that Nastassja loved them enough to abuse them, yes
Carol had centuries of spare memories to burn to kickstart them, Elfnein does not
that they drain from people
they run on memories
and, quite frankly, I'm not sure Elfnein would rebuild them considering she doesn't have a good way to power them
I don't think they'll be relevant to the rest of the season though
yeah
The other three are in literal multiple pieces with broken shards lying around and Garie had the dramatic eye fade thing
I'm pretty sure the autoscorers are already dead again pat
ha...ha.
miku's fukin dead
haha
I'd argue Gundam 00
When is the last time that happened for an anime original
Announcing two seasons is still nuts
~~they get explained in the conclusion movie after the series ends in a cliffhanger~~
I mean yeah, I'm sure stuff like Amalgam and stuff was made up on the spot
but having to switch bodies
or Elfnein not dying
Apple being the climax song from G
like
A lot of weird decisions from older seasons are making more sense, with the rumor that Kaneko *wanted* to tell this climax but wasn't sure if he'd ever *get* to
mm
I hope the harp wasn't spoiled for you
that's the bigger suprise of the episode than "carol comes back"
going to be honest
and really
I figured there was a good chance
I was *hoping* you didn't know about the autoscorers
give writing it a shot then ~~I've seen like 2-3 marvel movies max~~
yeah adult carol was sluttier
you yeet the baby, the baby yeets your face
elfnein will eat your soul now
yes!!
it turns out there's a massive conspiracy set decades earlier to set up for XV's big reveal - Misaki Kuno is just a carefully staged pseudonym and alternate persona of Inori Minase
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
still has carol's voice though so
who knows
could be animation error, new way the eyes work, or elfnein faking
<@!246146781832806401> I feel like it's worth mentioning that someone brought up that they gave a closeup of elfnein's eyes post-harp and it didn't have Carol's eyeshading
unless elfnein is faking
it's carol in carol's body
the ending song is great
god yeah
wire is metal
At the end of elfnein's transformation her lion zoid chomps the screen
consistent
frames in anime aren't uh
maybe a little longer
technically it was a 1/12 of a second shot
with the GX album poses for the girls they jobbed to
https://i.imgur.com/GoIpF8J.jpg
did you catch the frames during the durdabla transformation with the autoscorers in the hat
WFC
oh
and Noble Red probably didn't exist as concrete ideas in his mind
there's a second image not previewed
click the link
ü§î
or is she cleaning
there's a scene in AXZ where miku's cooking just fine
why do you think they can't cook
it's a "character trait" <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
I'm pretty sure it'll never improve
Considering they edited the BD release to make her eating *messier*
I was really glad it wasn't because that means the spoiler you got wasn't even true
We still have to find time to go to the moon
I feel like Miku is Soon‚Ñ¢
just because there's more people who pay attention to it since some are holding off of XV
If you're doing a watchthrough of GX and want to talk about GX <#336310266654490624> might be best
I mean there the answer is "Because we're making toys of it"
it was fun yeah
what, the robot voice?
swimmers, for example
plenty of people with healthy weights have visible ribcages
anyway as people said
for the record, both times Carol fought, she also showed ribcage
this is carol's body, albeit her backup body
<@90164247643828224> this isn't elfnein's disposable clone body, remember
that's the development
Her fork's better wound
oh, I see what you mean
just some Vercreature to get pummeled again
I'd be cool with that
fine
that'd be
bring back his corpse as some weird nephilim zombie thing
There's a way he could be brought back without pissing me off, but it still involves not bringing sugita back
she used it when she ditched the rest of the team
Shirabe had the competent brain cell
Ver lucked through everything
because uh they weren't, mostly
but in combat or tactics or strategy they never seemed competent
Maria, briefly, when she was being all OP as hell with her cape on top of the sub
FIS really sucked at seeming threatening
also has to be said
Noble Red's better written than the FIS girls *as of G*
Noble Red is the best antagonist squad we've gotten and that includes FIS
those would be other relics and that is a possibility yes
she used the ship's cloak
that she used
that fragment was miku's pendant
it was already in a symphogear system at the time
they used *a fragment* of SSJ to power the ship's cloak
to make up the power difference through phonic gain
that's why they bother with the symphogear system
no symphogear is made from a complete relic
no?
individual pieces of the *original* relic
there could be fragments the same way there's two gungnir pendants
around the bracelet in the activation machines
not in the bracelet
no
with carol taking over
with elfnein's mind
it's carol's body
I mean
y'all are just reminding me how dull AXZ's final few eps were
Kaneko didn't think it was
because uh
since there's no irregulars, there's no primes (or "dash" as they call it for some reason)
that's all you need to know in s1
that's essentially the model numbers there
I'm pretty sure s1 did have keywords talking about the "first, second, third" symphogears
yeah I privately don't think he came up with them until probably AXZ, but GX at earliest
the "r" would have made no sense in s1
it's used in G but kind of barely and dropping a hint that it's *weird* wouldn't be very interesting there
until GX
relevant
Argetlaim wasn't actually
I think GX is the earliest they could have dropped it
because she could now fuse with Nehushtan
Hibiki's *real* damage to her plan was it made Fine try to do things ahead of schedule
no, actually
but the long term planning was great
It got mucked up at the end because she ended up pushing it through ahead of schedule
Fine's plan was really very good
thank you fine
It's not *confirmed*, but it's very logical considering that Fine's ward ended up wearing it
that much is easy to read by implication
It was stolen by Fine
what Jam was going after is if you were making a joke it fell flat <:Bikkiwhoops:439560179214843914>
because she had invulnerability
that was her being cocky
yeah so
Didn't she basically double cross the americans
it was a relic
it wasn't a gear
If she hadn't been cocky and cut Chris loose, or been cocky from the invulnerability of Nehushtan, she probably would have succeeded
elfnein's proclivity towards tripping is lampooned in the shinais
it made AXZ worse by including him
yeah
Ver's addition to GX probably added more than it took away
but I don't track interviews/radio closely
I've also seen not all that much from the FIS cast members
I know she's attached to Fate, but I don't know about Tsubasa
Maybe it's just another job for her? I really have no idea.
Aside maybe from Nana, I've never seen her thoughts on it
I'm really glad Symphogear's been a positive project for the cast
Tsubasa's next week right
Awwwwwww!!
> She's too invested in Chris
but it should not be the past seasons in a blender
I like that XV is touching on all the past seasons
Honestly, better 7 minutes than 7 episodes imo
clearly XV is all the plot details kaneko had to cut from other seasons
How would carol handle getting daedalused
to pick up kiri and her broken spine
that's the ambulance coming
üö® üö® üö®
oh no
she's probably permanently going away soon
if carol counts as a character
everyone else is near zero
genjuro is most likely
Elfnein wants reunification but what she needs to be a healthier person is probably closure
she needs to find a purpose for herself beyond that
That means it's probably best for elfnein that she meets and loses carol
If anything
and carol took over afterwards
I wanna believe that Elfnein busted out that earth alchemy shield before the transformation
It's the best solution, writing-wise
pretty bad
I don't put it past symphogear to go "ITS COOL YOU CAN WORK FOR US AND WE'LL JUST FORGIVE YOU" but that's
also her mind
and, if she's staying
and it is her body
but carol did
You ready to put up elfnein for warcrimes
final problem with carol staying
anyway
that would be what everyone would think
or, at least
that everything elfnein accomplished from there on would be because Carol either did it for her or held her hand
elfnein's *so* much worse an alchemist than Carol was shown to be
I don't think you really appreciate what I'm getting at
it'd all be carol
If carol stayed, nothing elfnein would ever do again would be credited to her
I don't think carol can stay
godbaby is either going to be absorbed into miku or get killed easily
it both does and doesn't, like all japanese wordplay
not entirely true
that's
I mean
you'd have to really, really lean on the word to make it sound out of place
I mean, a *lot* of desus sound like dess because the final vowel isn't voiced
it's a little dark for my tastes
but DID from elfnein's unhealthy need to see carol again
what if it's not carol at all
oh my god
that doesn't mean you've watched them
to be fair
elfnein's searching for carol because elfnein doesn't think she's good enough
yeah I don't remember this, is this an AXZ shinai or something
"tomorrow we say tomorrow" refers to the fact it is 2 days away.
I'm reserving judgement until after she's had more than a single line of dialogue
I'm reserving judgement until after she's had more than a single line of dialogue
most bottoms I know want to be cats
tbf
look miku's already talked about how much she loves hibiki's gentle fisting
agreed that prior to XV, tsubamari was more to do with them being unattached adults rather than actually having chemistry
a gentle fist
she needs
3 pages of pictures isn't - I'm not really upset about the pictures, I'm trying to get you to understand channel courtesy
A link with an album of images would have been relevant
because this isn't an art channel
They don't
no.
<#336297674707828747> is the art channel - there are some exceptions for relevant XV images, but please have courtesy toward other users
Yeah, please don't spam both channels with the same images
because the philosophical weapon thing was in play
This fight isn't really a good way to compare amalgam vs x-drive anyway
poisoned blood
f for noble red
If it was a third of a second squish it would have worked
the maria/chris combo move was such a bad pacing move for the sake of a fanservice joke <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
please don't ping me
When you want a pet god a thing that kills gods is bad
would be to have Tsubasa stab Hibiki in the back
I figured the way to counter the god killer
the girls influence what the gears look like
rather than SSJ
It might be Miku that's doing it
like, its abilities
we'll have to wait and see but I don't think SSJ is actually part of this
this was carol's plan b
no they didn't
it was badly directed
watch the immediate sequence
<@145705908716961792> the earth shot comes after the other 3
at least, never explained in-show
aside from s1
they've never explained any of the show title names
they were in the background in one shot
~~I'm not convinced they have paid VAs this season~~
going to be sad when she's executed
it's time to try elfnein for crimes against humanity
90 minutes is a looooooong time
they could go to the moon, have about 4-5 fights, and still have time for exposition
plenty of time
that's uh
eh?
some of those ops or eds are going to be actual plot
and, honestly
not counting recaps or ops or ed
that's roughly 90 minutes of actual airtime
we still have 5 episodes left
I mean
this won't be it
that's about 6 times longer than it needed to be
a 2 second cut of breasts smushing together
it would have even been fine if it wasn't like
the one time they've been shown using it
they use it as an iv drip
they're a liability
everything is japanese when japan controls everything
what part of imperialism don't you get
tsubasa was huge
what the fuck kind of standards do you have
"tiny bit"
this is like, D-cup
y'all are just used to anime titties
tsubasa was on the large side of normal in s1
tsubasa's going to stab hibiki
give them a chance to establish themselves before trying to figure out the ultimate goal of the motive we don't know yet
shem-ha was just reborn
she's paired with kanade and serena because they're anime side-characters, not because they're dead
Considering it's in the ep
Uh
I'm a little mad about that
We got a fucking insert song
They're no longer antagonists but are now third party
They've got blood poisoning and Fudou finished using them
Noble red is done
It's better than Chris
Crunchy rarely does
Can I suggest you never use whatever service you used this week
But I don't think she'd lose
Carol would probably struggle vs Adam with the whole perfect body thing
Please try to cut back on the caps Dino, it's like you're nonstop shouting in here <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
The fact that the montage is *now* makes me think Miku will be saved sooner rather than later
Honestly
Fine appeared in like episode 7 to the protagonists dino
Millaarc
Er
What if he had Vanessa seal Miku
But no real evidence for that
I think Fudou gave them the proper blood laced with a different toxin
We're going to be opening with recaps till the end
Lasers are cheap to draw
<@506219877724454929> Please try to cut back on the caps Dino, it's like you're nonstop shouting in here <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
None of this is Adam's fault
Or shitty copies
Beyond mind control
But not for XV
We could get evil gear users for symphogear 2
As long as it keeps the signature effect
It doesn't work as a protagonist gear
She will
And while it's possible for someone to permanently lose a gear, it's not possible in episode 9-11
No one is going to die, especially one of the main 6
And it makes for a terrible protagonist gear
<@189146272865845248> ssj as previously used in G makes for terrible fights, in theory - when you know the girls can't get hit because the gears will be gone forever it makes the stakes drop
And there were probably mirror fragments around her in the machines as per the screen Vanessa was working on
She's surrounded by shenshoujing or a similar mirror border
<@468591607332208641> look at Miku's final pose
The memories and knowledge are gone, who cares about the brain
She doesn't know everything
Carol scraped together memories elfnein had of her
Elfnein has been shown to have a lot of gaps in her competency
(x) doubt
If millaarc gets herself killed for her sisters it sidesteps the problem
Millaarc might have been more even
73,811 vs roughly 70k
No she didnt
A miserable pile of secrets
Not writing
Thats, again, an art thing
It's all animation direction and art
I actually don't see much mecha influence on the writing
To assume there are other gods
That's quite the jump
that's the endgame.
we could have had x-drive amalga- oh my god.
shame
and mama Carol didn't give her her party gift
bikki was late
it was clearly a gunbuster reference first and foremost
<:shirapout:579426690237988885>
Inazuma kick
but filling the channel with your story drafts is disruptive and honestly kind of off-topic
you really should try writing actual stories, even only 2-4 pages, and improve through that
this channel isn't your notepad
<@506219877724454929> I mean this in a nice way, but
Please try to stay on topic
I think carol will burn herself out of elfnein's mind before we're done
who knows
so she's basically stealing elfnein's memories
but she could put old ones where they belonged, when they didn't originally belong to her - she's using elfnein's memories of carol
I think the intention behind the kopipe comment wasn't that carol could make new memories
in addition to the bracelet
There's a lot of discussion on it, and a lot of reasons to suspect she's still wearing either Shenshoujing or a mirror relic similar to it
maybe he had Millaarc seal miku
She's had a philosophical weapon as an Armed Gear from s1
is to connect
because Hibiki's armed gear
yeah
shooting people in the head is not gag joke material
I don't think it would work
actually scratch that
compared to the other two
in any way
like, sure, I guess that would work, but it wouldn't be particularly narratively good
like
stupid
really
that's
Tsubasa's about to ram her sword through Hibiki's back
or
either he intentionally set up SSJ to be absorbed by Shem Ha
those plans are probably one of two things
fudou said he had plans to take care of Hibiki's anti-god status
it *might* have it
but it is probably shenshoujing
and symphogear could pull that card
there are other mirror relics that would probably be basically SSJ but not
or yelled, or whatever
miku sang into her butt
just a pointless "look how puppetmaster I am" wankfest
it's possible but I think it's not really needed for the story to work
that all left her in axz
bikki does not currently have any divine power
fuck if I know where she is or how she'll be brought back, but the narrative demands she come back or risk the story being unsatisfying
anyway, miku's not gone forever
and thing goes in > thing comes out is pretty central to alchemy
this isn't fma, though it's not unreasonable to assume that alchemy would have *some* related concept due to kaneko not being garbage at historical research (usually)
symphogear has not actually established a law of equivalent exchange
would like to note
I mean yeah I think that's like 20% possible right now
maybe????
how that would control a god idk but
might not even be canon
besides SSJ's transformation which uh
Nothing has been added so far
there's tons of little details in fights that exist just for references or tiny fun details
they've been going all out
most of XV is excessive animation
uh
it was green until it was detached from the rest of the gear
I think condition red was because the earpiece broke off
x-drive amalgam
...uh?
It's a very mature dress
undergears
the dress is a better look
was slightly sad that she transformed tbh
it's an amazing dress
I guess I just really didn't want "herp derp instantly destroys relics" to come back
eh, I don't know
I feel that using the actual relic again
and yet
*true*
not SSJ++
new design
I wanted a new relic
I'm still bummed that it's back
we have SSJ to take SSJ's place
yes
considering it handles the plate in the back of her head differently than the show does
<:yayakaStare:292520684326748161>
I don't think we'll start now
We haven't once referenced any actual mythological gods besides sumerian
durandal 2.0
HIBIKI WIELDS MIKUSWORD
*probably*, ninryu, but can you imagine MikuSword
subgroup
YameteTomete
at least, irl
there's more than just SSJ
It's also possible it's another sacred mirror
prostitutes do not usually wear ragged dresses
SSJ relic fragment was destroyed by SSJ's beam in G
yeah I don't know where you're getting that from
I can't believe hibimiku are fucking dead
<:sadmiku:432799416227725312>
yeah Chris has been skimping on the billion maiden use this season
still looks like Sentai Ranger Symphogear
undergear is when they do stuff like hexarevolver
that's amalgam
that's not undergear
shit fanfic, barely references the original work and is filled with OCs
that's uh.
She's blocked stuff with billion maiden before
she is of a much more noble heritage
vanessa cares not for your piddlesome gundams
a few times
they've had noise swarms
Chris' henshin was kind of awful
I mean
but it works as shorthand
so calling it censorship is a little misleading
Nothing's getting removed
because the ghosting made it really weird
cannot wait for BD on that
and the censorship ghosting ruins it
oh my god the one part of the x-drive fight where they like swap between things every other frame
the big mirror unfolded from the knee things
her giant beam attack in G came from her legs
*gundam zz legs*
Gundam ZZ legs
but that *dress*
the gear is kind of whatever; it's okay
I really hope she kicks everyone's ass and then walks around for an episode in that dress
god I love her dress so much
<@!98541382393688064> they're in the dying remains of the god-baby, "real-time" might not really be that relevant
miku dying is about as likely as the symphogears losing and there being eternal Shem Ha rule
it's shemha
I said earlier, but I think everyone losing and Shem-Ha winning and ruling the earth forever is roughly as likely as Miku staying dead at the end of the show
yeah they won't
do you think it's bad to hope miku never comes back so we see an entire season of that dress
I mean technically supporters of the teleportation paradox would agree she's died
it's interesting
because as laid out in the keywords
I really wish the show would take 20 seconds to actually explain amalgam's gimmick
everyone did it, only Hibiki went into the offensive mode
so that when they go big we know it's Amalgam at work
we popped X-drive early to show that they still have the old X-Drive designs
I actually think Amalgam X-Drive is probably the endgame fight suit
<:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
7 was a better episode than 8
and were not impressive
did nothing
X-drives uh
since
luckily topping this episode isn't too hard
ah, right
did we ever have one?
when was the last time we had an OOC insert song
I was so goddamn disappointed that we had an actual insert song
Was that actually her b-side
and the assumption that everyone else will do it
I almost regret the germain duet because I'm getting tired of the stand jokes
that's going to be the threat
Fudou's going to be a threat when we end an episode with Tsubasa's sword rammed through Hibiki's back
the itano circus was neat
but it's *a weak scene* and they shouldn't have made it weaker by having a long cut in the middle for fanservice when they could have done a quick cut and *still had the fanservice*
I'm fine with the scene in the context of the show's entire flow
yeah
because everyone did fucking nothing
the X-drive fight was already kind of a wet fart
it disrupts the flow of the fight so much because they slow down so much
a half second cut would have been great
why did it need a 2-3 second cut
the docking scene was really bad
those are your two options
<@209896097026408449> basically it can either go 100% defense, 0% offense, or 100% offense, 0% defense
uncreative
I think it's mostly that scarf fists were a bit
symphogear with time travel sounds awful
no thank you
<:Thinkki:514552069563088896>
she could take the bracer, maybe
oh
that's the main thing throwing me off
hibiki will need a new relic at some point
I've been considering what they might do
yeah, maybe not
the gear?
I really want the hibiki vs tsubasa fight we've been denied since ep 3 of s1
one namey boi
or
70 thousand faceless civilians
who would win
problem solved
by having her protect someone with an actual name
that's too fun to pass up
I'm willing to sit through a bad redemption arc if it means good millaarc fights evil basa
so yeah, a flashback of her waking up and millaarc doing something to her seems possible, though I still think the whole line is ehhh
she just fainted, didn't she?
mildly weird that she *has* been out this whole time
when you think on it
actually
there's been a lot of time with miku off-screen
but
yeah
it's a longshot but it wouldn't be the worst asspull symphogear's done
something something handwave "it got in miku before hand and it's harder to undo than stop"
who knows
maybe something about the mirrors used is relevant
The only thing I've been able to come up with is that Miku's been Sealed by millaarc but that seems like a longshot
????
it's "perfected" now
they did mention linker!
I mean
I wasn't too upset by the zesshous
Ehhh
and reject it
I actually want someone to be offered the chance to redo everything since the concert
ssj can get fucked, I want that dress always
IS SO GOOD
THAT DRESS
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
god has not yet been punched
a mass of divine energy was punched
when did stupidity save the day
the saddest bingo we'll get
we're actually only genjuro fights away from a bingo
I thought "honorary no more" was to make her a 7th protagonist gear
https://twitter.com/Crime_Wizard/status/1005466633555476480
it's a good time to pull this tweet out again
I admin a symphogear server and I've literally never seen that comparison.
<:yayakaStare:292520684326748161>
because we've had a subplot of miku struggling to confess the entire show
hibimiku will never kiss, we'll be graced if Miku actually tells hibiki she loves her
let dmjii unison kill gods
so maybe WFC's right and gungnir's about to be permanently destroyed
This is like the third episode in a row they've gone "we've got our secret weapon, godkiller!!!"
they're playing it up too much
I actually am starting to think
Genjuro dying while defeating a sideplot enemy (like fudou) could work
the pairing's DMJii
so combine that with Shirabe's trademark
yeah, she looks like Dark Magician Girl and once upon a time she was nicknamed DMG
they pulled out X-drive now so they can pull out something better later
~~shirabe dies to give kirika a birthday somehow, curtainfall~~
godbikki stands around for a week doing nothing
you *know* the final three episodes are fucking lame
and worst of all in AXZ
you *know* the Alchemists aren't actually fucking doing anything productive
and on a rewatch you're *aware* of it
because there's a lot of Nothing being accomplished every episode
but AXZ in particular felt agonizing to rewatch
and decently told
it's mostly a coming of age story
because aside from the bad conspiracy politics subplot
s1 holds up pretty good on a rewatch
"why the fuck is hibiki emoing out here over nothing"
"why are we monster of the week"
which slap you in the face first go around
I found GX *improves* on a rewatch because you're already prepared for the flaws
agreed with G being worse on a rewatch
it has the most systemic flaws
but
I actually really like GX and I rate it above AXZ, personally
6 episodes of vividred can be skipped and you lose absolutely nothing
like
vividred
wait no
<@145705908716961792> plenty of originals still have filler, but all of the ones I can think of are 2 cour or more
and believe me, I've been tempted to try
there isn't an episode you can outright skip
even gx
in any season
we've never had filler in symphogear
it's a hot mess
GX really feels designed by committee
something something kaiju reference
it's too disorienting to understand what's going on
The actual equipping of her gear was directed poorly
Chris is at the bottom for me <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
pallatable
the rest would be
If they rewrote the lines where he chewed the carpet at the end of G and redid the whole way he intended to rule humanity's survivors
honestly
G Ver is why all the other Vers are shit
I mena
<:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
about 6 times slower than it should have been
boob squish
the best examples would be a flashback when Fine was alive and manipulating FIS
but there's not a lot of ways
there's a few ways XV could use ver without being awful
and it'd be fine
AXZ needs like 5 episodes redone
god
particularly AXZ
most people work in anime because they love working in anime rather than because it's a good career move
actually make enough money to pay everyone involved
so they're not constrained so much by the fact that the anime industry doesn't
also regards to cg animators, they usually do more than just anime
`watch shirobako`
because you need education

to bring out the shirobako chart
is it time
secretbikki
yeah nintendo pulled a coup there
yeah
but the AC staff are doing Daemon x Machina
they'll never make a mecha game again
not from soft
well
it's called DxM
they are
<:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
nowhere
> Armored Core: For Answer - Guest Designer, credited as "Shoji Kawamori." Designed NEXT White Glint.
I think?
iirc
he did white glint
probably DxM, kawamori was involved a lot with AC
but I can't quit you
I'll never forgive you
fucking kawamori
~~if its mecha~~
actually satelight is one of the more interesting studios to have its name attached to a project
pocket full of rainbows
enki turned on the curse so fine would stop sexting him
hey if two custodians were on the moon and one shot the other, would that be fucked up or what
she can do that without the cane, just not as well
Fine summoned the noise
Solomon's cane didn't get turned on until 5 months before Hibiki first activated gungnir
she killed others later, but she was newly kidnapped then
chris didn't do the s1 attack on the concert
"see y'all bitches, I'm off to my ***moon base***"
xenogears, here we come
it now thinks it is a god
shem-ha is actually the AI controlling the custodian's space ship <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
we've only seen a mummy and a mikuform
what are you comparing
the whole enzyme thing/blood poisoning sounds very different from what linker does
song might have some of the blood
<:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
they're grunts, plot dictates the enemies have enough to let the gears show off attacks
in exchange for help developing the chateau
carol might have given the illuminati a lot
elfnein decides to get into the weapons market
"one part cesium, two parts plutonic quarks, mix with water"
alca-noise are created differently
with the cane
because Fine kept summoning them
and the noise began attacking after that
It was the activation of Tsubasa's relic that awakened Fine
she's the last announced CD until BDs
oh, she is
unless tsubasa's still to drop?
afaik
there won't be any new songs released officially for a few months
they need to be judicious with callbacks
not too late for it to fall on the side of the latter
sadly
it's
XV's been kind of carefully toeing the line between fun callbacks and overly recycling
ouch
minus one tiny capsule that shot nastassja up and the world governments already raided it for stuff
with nephilim
and blew up
frontier got eaten by nephilim
and they don't do everyone
I think there's an edge case where Tsubasa could be the final miniboss
and, in fact, it makes the slow pacing on the the whole seal inversion thing make more sense
we could very much end up with a divine power-infused tsubasa doing fudou's bidding
now that SSJ seems to be around
but
obviously it's metaphor
Fudou keeps saying he'll make the divine power into a blade to use to defend japan
so I had a thought when I woke up
There's an aufwachen waveform behind Shem-ha
and it deletes curses
SSJ is in play, supposedly
because
but you can also call that foreshadowing
I mean, it is
120 minutes of kanade
<@!279341087494242304> opinions on theory on fudou's plan
At least testament acknowledged the other girls existed when she used their abilities
The next step of fudou's plan really doesn't make any sense yet unless they did something to miku off-screen
even for a god
minions/priests are useful
until next episode
yeah, that's something we can't get a single handle on
I agree with Kaliks in that I feel that NR's next step is attempt to negotiate with Shem-Ha to give them humanity? After that (or instead of that) it'll be to join up with SONG
"they might be dead" leads to them having to check some other things
"they're kidnapped" leads to immediate manhunt
to cover everything with blood so SONG would be slower in responding
The inspector?
the poisoned blood was him trying to clean up the mess
Fudou's done with them
We're probably at that point
~~I care about millaarc~~
Millaarc might die, so if you care about her, there you go
none of the 7 girls will die
genjuro's the most likely one but I still think it's more likely he lives than dies
don't hold your breath
you'll get your wish
fudou will probably die
something stupid
"elfnein's upgrade in GX to stop alcanoise from disassembling stuff also counters SSJ"
"the gears are now resistant to being deleted because they're partly alchemical"
It's possible they'll pull a real asspull move
<@200030864497704960> the fragment miku wore was destroyed in the frontier incident
agreed
yeah
and a bronze mirror border around her
honestly, I could see it
and enki missing an arm was a red herring?
without fucking destroying the show
and have both Fine and Ver have their cameos
yeah we could get a scene about Fine giving airgetlam to FIS
Fine's gotta be in, even if it's just a "6000 years ago" flashback
I expect miyuki
and refusing some role offers
isn't the VA semi-retired
I feel like that's an episode 11 thing
or solomon's vault
I was actually more hoping for nephilim or frontier's last fragment being relevant
n e v e r m i n d
I guess evil miku is the G callback
oh wait
everything's been s1, GX, AXZ
we haven't had one aside from the very first shot of the show
I'm still waiting for the G callback
no information
This is one of those "wait 5 days" questions because there's just
hopefully we get Shem-Ha standing around in *that dress* for an episode
I think so yeah
or the final fights, really
At this point I think Carol's going to stick around until the final fight
she might need screentime
remember that Miku is also Shem-Ha
miku is not final boss yeah
"at this antarctic research base"
"we've found one like it before"
"we found this weird species inside tiki"
it was like
oh right
was it? god I don't remember ep 1 that well then
not the arctic
Scorpion was found inside Tiki
theory: Airgetlam's getting set-up to be super special/godkiller/something so that Maria has a way to one v one divine weapon Tsubasa
"it's a knife/whip/funnel/railgun/vector manipulation gear, okay"
which has bugged me until now
yeah
which we find out in XV means "fucking weird-ass shit"
and then in AXZ it was labelled x00
just keyword/bios
"Maria wields the mysterious" etc
It always gets dropped in bios or keywords
it just hasn't shown up on-screen until vanessa's comment about iraq
Kaneko's been making a big deal out of airgetlam being mysterious since GX
axz was just dumb tho
him being in relic jail did make sense
ytt pls
SYMPHOGEAR BS: <<It doesn't have to be beef, boys don't know this>>
beef
be
to
have
it doesn't
I'll back you up
solid call
blue flash?
I feel like probably
Were Kaneko and Agematsu good friends before symphogear
I'm sure he has assistance and cocreators on some
Agematsu does everything that's not a cover
establishing motifs and using them well is why tanaka kouhei is my favorite composer
And, honestly
You also saw it destroyed
When it could be a technological revolution
It's basically the same as suggesting someone just blow up an alien spacecraft because it might be bad
Anyway it's completely realistic a government would take ages to dismantle the chateau
It's kinda why Fudou is really pissy
So yeah,no big deal
Japan lacks the international clout to chastise US on symphoverse
Please don't use the r-slur, I think this is the second time you've been asked
The absolute utter morale hit Japan would take would be lethal
Fallout isn't even the worst part
John Wayne is a normal name
Did I see someone earlier suggesting Japan nuke it's own city in order to demolish the chateau because that might be the single most poor understanding of Japanese culture I have ever seen
What if Carol had more than one fragment of dainsleif
It's possible it was easier to do that than dismantle the world
Because there is no other way to defeat the whole multidimensional enemy thing without a philosophical weapon
It was just the best plan
And maybe it can't
Anyway I don't think carol knew it could even still work
Yeah she blew it up to try to stop it from going in reverse
It was destroyed because it wasn't supposed to run in reverse
I think most people and governments would decide the small risk of it being activated again is worth the chance to study it as it's dismantled
Yeah I don't see any reason to expect Miku is deleted when she wasn absorbed into the power and bracelet rather than vice versa
Also carol was the one person to maybe subvert the process
While I've been expecting Miku for like 4eps
Probably because there was no way in hell to prepare for them
I was more blown away by the autoscorers but it was good shit
Sounds like they return to an anchor point though
I don't think so
(the former is probably a smokescreen of why she knows enough to do the latter tbh)
If it's outside of that she doesn't have in depth knowledge unless she's been able to research it
Help build part of the chateau and help install ignite
She was built to do 2 things
Elfnein has very spotty knowledge
So he may not do it
Leaving things open for a movie may mean not doing the decisive end kaneko had in mind
Or, honestly, even likely
There's honestly not a real reason to think a movie is certain
It's possible but we're not getting ot
Tsubasa dying and reuniting with kanade would be a goddamn punch
Also Miku has less of a chance than the gear users of dying
(x) doubt
Fudou has a bigger chance of winning than Miku does of permanently dying
That really just means shemha is dominant
Nanoha did it better
pachinko is basically slots but with a metal ball involved
you're getting way off-topic
it destroyed gainax
pachinko is power
it's okay, they gave their souls for sawashiro
~~s1 design superior~~
honest
we'll never be so lucky as to have hibiki solve the problem by being
and yeah
kind of? It depends a lot on the differences between shemha and devil gundam
please stop trying to derail the conversation in this channel to talk about lobo or avengers or other stuff
Miku being a hero on the frontline sabotages her character
I really, really hope she doesn't
pretty sure
it's a granzon reference
the "Ore no uta!" at the end is so fucking good
serena - the real non-character of gear
really, as long as the 12-15 crowd is into it he'll look at making a video on it
or it has to make him money
if matpat makes videos about symphogear I'm bailing
as long as it's not a total asspull
I'd love to see Fine again, though, I really liked her,
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
her soul's been killed, but that still could leave her memories
and
I've been thinking about it
where a lot of an episode isn't in the present
I could see a Madoka Episode 10 thing
and
hard but not impossible
st. germain suppository
is hibiki without bagpipes really hibiki
music theory
the way a song sounds is part of the theming
her CD was the first released
yes
I kinda wish preview pics weren't a thing
also it seems to be an excuse for your "miku in a perfect dream" fantasy
I think there's so much conjecture here it's not a very useful theory
Carol's one of them
GX had some really awesome and amazing building blocks to build a story out of and it kind of just decided to give us a rubble pile full of them instead of making a structure
5 was the non-kaneko one right
a beam whip is pretty far from segmented whip sword
but there's a lot of examples that are way closer to what Maria has than bleach
like I don't know where segmented whip sword started
that's almost certainly not the inspiration
considering stuff like Ivy from soul calibur exists
uh
yeah, a half-cape for her butt
pretty sure
she has a butt-cape for airgetlam
read into that what you will
so
she also got a titty window in black gungnir for GX
apparently when you're no longer evil you lose capes
she lost it in GX
*pets Aegis and her shield-based gear*
echoes of scientology
kind of like what was going on near the end of G
I think Tsubasa will fight someone one on one or something while there's a bigger fight on a different field
I think she'll be a miniboss
fudou isn't about appeasing gods
judging from both its appearance and the bronze mirror frame surrounding her in her transformation
Shem-ha seems to have either SSJ or a similar mirror relic as a pseudo-gear
and is one of the final fights
is fudou's god puppet
gets divine power
Tsubasa gets hit with SSJ
I still think there's a chance here that
miku was in the OP for G for one ep wasn't she
probably
well the Fine plot was really the B-plot compared to Hibiki's coming of age and taking up Kanade's torch
yeah nobody's going to shift because you're not used to it friendo
but there's nothing stopping kaneko from bringing them back if there's another key to the realm
it just sealed them in, but it also had nephilim blow up which may have wiped out most or all of them
The attack was to disguise the theft
Nehushtan was already active
I don't think she intended to force a zesshou
That said there's a flaw
That's why she gets off 2 attacks before her gear goes dark
Anything in her system was just leftovers from training
It was a concert
Kanade wasn't on linker
More than that
That grinds my gears
Fucking Serena is in the op but kanade isnt
I mean I guess they could have meant that
I'm with Rany, I think it'll be taken care of in the second act of episode 10
Imagine Kanade telling Tsubasa she's proud of her though
Part of me wants an ending with Tsubasa dying and reuniting with kanade in afterlife
They do it and release it on April 1 and it's a rooster putting on a gear
Apple ignite would actually be so bad it'd be fantastic
Apple (Amalgam Ignite)
It's Serena singing apple
It did scream "this anime is a game adaptation"
It's a shame they wasted "evil mimic robot" in the dumbest fucking way
Having the same guardian doesn't make romance off limits
Priest granddad adopts both of them after shirabe parents tell them
I want to point out
but the point remains
it's possible she signed onto an XDU contract with a continuing needs clause
mind you
yeah
We already know the solution is gentle fisting
Maria with the useless lesbian aesthetic
Hibiki needs the flashbacks, where else does she get all that kanadust to cook beef stroganoff with
yes
it's not like they don't make money from free viewers
yeah they can and probably should be 1-2 episodes behind
2 days ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLym7dcWw68
3-4 days ago
they already uploaded that
they should *really* insert a special thumbnail
and
they really should wait until after the episode goes up to free viewers though
they have a reason to upload and that's fine
I do think
starting to look like yelling in here
I think we can cut back on the text markup
it's a dickbag thing to do even if there's monetary incentive to do it
but that doesn't make them immune to criticism over it
You're correct
it's bad culture even if you can see it coming
and it would not be your fault
you can absolutely legitimately not know the signposts are there yet
AXZ hasn't finished uploading on crunchy
counting only Fine's latest incarnation
well
but SG = Millaarc > Fine ?> Carol ?> Ver for actual kills
Carol > Ver > Fine for *prospective* kills
yes
then it's also Chris' fault for everything he did
yeah true, but if you count everything Ver did as Fine's fault
everything else is more for terrorist purposes
the concert would have been the biggest mass killing
Fine's total deathcount is probably somewhere around 10-20k
and do not believe that about song
they believe(d) fudou's actually willing to help them
Elsa's most vividly shown strategizing in her first appearance and in the junkyard
Absolutely one of the best storyboarded/delivered moments of the franchise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tth8RBM0Ol8
`fuck that's a good scene`
"SYMPHOGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"
and hibiki gave the literal answer that had a dose of metaphorical truth
she broke her spirit, how is she fighting again
what the fuck is it that keeps Hibiki going
that was *metaphorical*
"What is this armor you've clad yourself in"
she's like
no
Oh
She *definitely* didn't expect X-drive to be activated
it's so difficult to activate, she could expect to dictate its terms
She might have known X-drive was a thing but like
why build a tool that could defeat you
Fine probably built them to be specialized, as well as built them to not be all that overwhelmingly powerful
As of XV it's been overhauled and upgraded like 3 times to be expanded considerably beyond its original function
maybe get some partial relic effects out of it, but
it really was designed to really only counter Noise and that's about it
the Symphogear System really was pretty shitty
It really is funny how subsequent seasons have really hammered in that
Perhaps Chris was a functioning gear under her control she could bait America with prior to FIS
G shows she had plans behind plans
Ichaival was almost certainly a different backup
I'm unsure she needed Ichaival for the cane
o7
a unique threat only she could stop
a threat to prompt the government to need to respond
that's why the noise attacks
toys to get resources from the government to build kadingir
because that's the entire point of the symphogear charade
she needed section 2 to have symphogear soldiers in order to draw funding from the japanese government for the base
Having both die would have inconvinienced Fine
I feel like it's really hard to charge someone with murder when their victim's waving hello to you
synchrogazer and radiant force are probably my absolute favorite songs in terms of how the show uses them to manipulate emotional impacts
how it matches up to Synchrogazer
probably the most important part of it
and of course
it can't not feel good
even when you see it coming
and then hibiki screams in your ear and it's beautiful
Bikki's up and you're trying to deal with the anticipation, and then suddenly you get 3 light beams and HEY THEY'RE NOT DEAD
it's so well delivered
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
god I miss the s1 glowing rings of censorship
killing a character to establish consequence is what you do when you're bad at establishing consequence
could be wrong
the "who's miku" one yeah I think so?
~~pretty sure solo used that trick in a prompt before~~
they're sentai outfits
Ignite's obviously gone for good unless we get something goofy like Carol had two shards of dainsleif
I actually think there's a good chance we'll get Amalgam X-drive
Hibiki's gear is not cool enough to do every fight
I prefer it like this
honestly
thank god
I feel like we'll get everyone using amalgam if only for like a single cut each just so the ADs can come up with supergear designs
We have no guarantee anyone's going to get Amalgam before the finale, when everyone does
no shit they're going to be together
"are they going to have a duet"
The issue isn't
and I'm saying your argument's based on bad parallels
seriously
"they wanted to reuse the footage" has absolutely no impact on whether they'll be using amalgam in a duet
that's irrelevant
so that's a bad example
in AXZ
DMjii were the one pair who managed to do a unison attack without ignite
Actually
I could see that
I don't think they're gutting anything
We don't have enough time
It's either all defensive or all offensive
no one else could do anything
You saw one of the drawbacks in the debut episode
actually
but yes
For one, it's not approved by the government
you lay out the best case scenario and then start working through drawbacks
Amalgam being introduced early is actually part of good superform design
oh, I like that
it's pretty clear they needed it
Hibiki got her ass kicked and put into the medical wing
it was multipurpose and that's good
"take over your HQ" was also a way to disable amalgam from fights
nah
FINAL OMEGA STYLE DYSTOPIA
please give it to us for 2 minutes
Symphogear Megazord
that said
like GL did it fine but it's not something to be emulated
GL's ending was, imo, bad
she was going for a conductor choreography
Her not moving was great
maybe she'll move from physical swords to ideon swords
is just going to be what she uses all the time in ignite
the sword tsubasa uses at the end of s1
XV's also really good because they brought black back into the design
that's why the G gears were the best
yeah ignite's black and low-detail to make it cheap
which was some lame-ass "spikier stuff"
I'll take "bigger stuff" over Ignite
I mean
the yellow on gold just doesn't pop
compared to, say, Basa's
I will say bikki's amalgam is the worst looking amalgam we've had on screen so far
Musical Fighter SymphoRanger
they still let her go fight for them
Shirabe was also an ally of the big bad
they'll probably live on the song boat
have at you
enough talk
a miserable pile of secrets
Tsubasa didn't know that
she ended up not being dead
sure
I mean
they killed Prelati
god from the machine
Amalgam was literally a deus ex machina
noble red had the victory
I mean
they don't have to be threatening at this point
but they're no longer the antagonist
Noble Red's been threatening
the only effort part of the beam fight from the *beam* point of view was the Itano circus
done
and then you digitally put lasers on top
you draw the characters
the lowest effort animation
beam fights are
???
I want hibiki to mugen punch
I'm really not interested in someone who argues "genocide is only for a whole race, not a group of people" when the UN disagrees
you know what
"some got emotionally damaged, others willfully damaged their own emotions"

genius, truly
armados have you ever considered magical girl might not be the genre for you
Old linker is, new linker is only on overdose yeah
like, is it harmful?
what do you mean by "counter-effect"
Akira can at least be used to tell a story about how becoming a better person is hard and takes time
I'm not writing it off yet
but
they could easily fuck it up though
I fully believe they can integrate topdad in a way that makes the show better
*that* is not a discussion for this channel
isn't a hero
stereotypical lawful good paladin
hear me out
particularly when they have a relateable motivation
You cannot be a hero and demonize the enemy
If it doesn't affect her, that's a fall from grace moment
I'm looking at handling his comments seperately
Someone being toxic doesn't justify insults here
Yeah, this whole channel needs to take a few breaths and try to not do the personal insults, please
that's what I was thinking of
melodramatic
yeah
like whenever Sugita starts yelling and being insane, that's chewing the scenery
chewing the scenery is a phrase used to refer to someone being very dramatic and full of... texture?
"Let's keep going, Ryoko-san~"
Kanade chewing the scenery in that part was so good
they've never shown it used on someone who has a good sync rate
Linker helps make non-Adaptors have a better sync rate closer to Adaptors
we have no way of understanding its mechanism
I don't think so
70k+
73,811
Carol (Attempted) > SG = Milaarc > Ryoko!Fine ?> Ver ?> Carol (actual)
then it's
If we're only talking about Ryoko!Fine
but possibly before, who knows
Yumi: Not as of AXZ
yeah, kind of, but at the same time, she's also flying the thing
ehhh
not 6 thousand, just 6
so let's say that between Ver and Miku FIS killed around 4-5 thousand people, and then Maria killed another 6 or so
the ships going after Frontier is the biggest group of casualities
and the boys at the base
a few other groups of soldiers
and almost all of it is on Ver alone
FIS' kill count is actually *really* low
Bikki's still friends with Chris and Miku who should probably be executed by Bird's standards since duress and circumstance don't seem to be relevant
want to point out
I mean
Symphogear had high fives
*typically* a show that's hitting the same emotional beats as Symphogear would have a moment of solemn reflection mourning how it was a necessity and how they wish it could have been different
While that's true, Raiden
god those were good shows
Everyone saw hibiki naked, even
sounds like people might rush to support
idk
A terrorist disaster no one died in?
2
s1 had
also we've seen 5 basa concerts
Only two had anyone die
because it's okay to be a mass murderer as long as you *care*
it's the number of people who have lost their lives due to her goal
I believe so yes
70k died
100k was the concert's capacity
I thought 70k were lost
uh was it 10k
Who is Anki
Dino please don't give a character shit for wearing traditional clothing, that's inappropriate
Because they didn't anticipate being backstabbed by the government they work for
But with the inspection they were forced to take a holiday
They explained both of them have shadow staff all the time
They *do* keep an eye on them
absolutely nothing else in storytelling has the power of a well-crafted ending
all these adaptations with no endings
perpetually evergreen media with no ending is the worst part of the modern anime format
god I want it to end
I do
"this is a climax of the song, it needs to be played sforzando"
"be emphatic right here"
like
it's a sharp musical accent
Sforzando would be more correct
only because he didn't do anything
well, maybe adam was worse
not great
aiming for his level
also ver was the worst villain we've had in 4 seasons so
emulating endgame is probably the worst option any media can do in the next 5 years
just mugen punch it
I want hibiki to punch the moon from standing on earth
the only ominous part of the tagline was god (kimi)
to me, at least
On first impression it means to defy fate or providence, that's all
anything bad
I don't know why you think that tagline means
or television episodic dramas
except for ones about the cyclical nature of life
also reset endings are terrible anyway in every media
but because endgame's ensured no one can use the fucking mechanic for 5-10 years and not be a hack
and not because "none of it would ever happen"
it'd be garbage
doing nothing
didn't hibiki stand around for a few days
and that's all the major plotbeats of AXZ
and then Adam's plot cooks off
then the fool's stone
you've got the investigation into kamukura
you've got a bit of downtime while the alchemists school the gears
you've got like one day and night in val verde
it helps when very little actually happens
Ame no habikiri was first activated like 12 years ago but that doesn't mean it was a proper symphogear yet
no that's probably not right
wait
Tsubasa for about 10
there's no way it won't short of a production failure
she might be dying but she's still alive
When Vanessa's cut you just hear metallic sounds
Miku's going to end up with the highest killcount in the show
pretty sure the other two are fuckin dead
Vanessa's alive
yeah probably
incredible episode
üöÑ
I don't think it was vanessa
there'll still be XV Shinais
10, 11, 12, 13
4
good job, maria
was useful
finally
Maria
its role in the story is different
It's not a climax, but it's just as good
Tsubasa stopped the swing
He didn't stop the sword with his head
also "why doesn't genjuro do everything" fans can finally shut up
it hurt
<:MikuShock:391808765009068035> the episode
millaarc was bisected
millaarc got the worst hit
no
and if only they were inhuman
or something
powers of god
if only we had like
god
atm
I also think they're dead
but
yeah I think NR could be revived
National treasure doesn't *automatically* mean heretical technology sacrist relic
Uh
that's nice I guess
Maria/Basa finally actually becoming a ship
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
did you have fun
yo ninryu
He's not a new character, but he's obviously trying to be better
Top dad's scenes were well handled
rip the best antagonist characters gear has ever had
anyway
by reprograming miku
so 3 characters
alive
well
Vanessa's fine
but I think they might come back anyway
I think some of them are fucking dead
I expected Shem-Ha to actually have screen-time in 9
I'm pushing back my estimate to when Miku gets freed to episode 11
they just have to be used correctly
cliches aren't inherently bad
Vanessa isn't dead
Millaarc is dead, barring anime regeneration (possible)
Elsa's dead, barring anime bullshit
we have 4 more episodes
3 more what
it's explained in the keywords ~~and nowhere else~~
the attack form has no defense and is all power
the bubble/cocoon mode is pure defense and cannot attack
It has two modes
next episode is going to be Tsubasa jailed for crimes against the Nationstate of Japan for destroying one of the three sacred treasures
thank god
what if ver made the faust robe
XV is the final one
apparently tsubasa backstabbing everyone > Carol coming back
so I can keep looking at that dress
can we just leave miku as evil forever
what if vanessa gives the other two mecha bodies
fuck
it's not a reflection on him being shit or not shit
his apartment is fine
yes
shem-ha probably has a similar relationship
but I still like them
and I enjoy having them around
because they're tasty
I like cows
I mean
At least Shem-ha seems to like humanity or I think there'd be a lot of people dead very fast
Miku's kill count continues to rise
I love my little murder trio
I hope so
the opening was painful
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Elsa has beast-like anatomy
Elsa's only living if she has inhuman anatomy
Millaarc might have vampire regeneration that can do it
Elsa
when Vanessa's cut into you hear metal and mechanic sounds
Vanessa is probably alive but maybe dying
Two of them are *probably* dead
I think it's homicide but ok
which is pretty fucked up compared to this scene
and everyone's like "YAY WE WON"
They kill Cagliostro and Prelati (or, at least, think they do)
it makes the AXZ alchemist fights **that much worse**
I think the biggest problem I have with Genjuro stopping Tsubasa from killing Fudou
pretty sure
it was a reference to the shichishito
80 slots free
we still have *lots* of animated emote slots though
Kriisa filled them up with carol
oh never mind
we still have a few slots
I mean
Once the spoiler period is up I'll probably do an emote drive or voteoff or something
but then, if he knows they're dying he might have already written them off
seems really bad planning for fudou to assume they're dead
Hm, that's a point
"long gone"
Vanessa doesn't fit
they have all been alive within the last year
There's 5 or 6 people who have been known to build faust robes
I still don't get who the person who built the robe is when they've supposedly been long gone
There's a gap we're missing
how Fujitaka and Tomosato were doing *action bureaucracy* this episode
Can I mention
it sabotaged some of the show in order to have them
G better have good cliffhangers
best cliffhanger is miku reveal in G imo
it's fate/stay night in chibi bots
they're not very similar and do very different things
but
Madoka influenced early Symphogear and Symphogear wouldn't exist without Madoka's success
it's just a flesh wound
Lunar Ruins
I think if noble red isn't dead, they'll come back not the way they were
it is now
if his political career wasn't already over
he had one of the three sacred treasures
yes
yes
murakumo is more commonly known these days as the kusanagi
no
she's having a bad day but
for some weird reason or another
and it's possible her faust robe body has some blood pumping through it
I think she *might* have a spine
but there's 0% chance she's dead
Vanessa might be dying
Vanessa's alive and will finish NR's arc whether everyone else is alive or not
if you fail to deliver you typically need a good reason to not follow through with it
the catharsis of an audience is part of writing
that's part of finishing an arc
you wanted tsubasa to beat her up
And it's not like she's *needed* to finish an arc
millaarc dying here feels right in that it feels like she wasn't supposed to die here, narratively? And while it's a weird and not commonly used mechanic, you can pull that trick to make it seem like someone is so powerful they can cut through fate
today
at least 70,000 people who came to see her didn't die in direct relation to her failure to protect them
"lol Outer Physics"
but it's still coming out of elsa?
the beam blinks off for a second before the sweep
what the fuck is that animation error though
disarmed, if you will
<:chrisbored:579135026751602728>
Hibiki only got a stand because of the AXZ live
after it
changed
It was pulled from the game and there were some indications the writing staff was
no one knows how bad it was
The second half of the event never went up
Kirika was a crazed maniac who kept needing to use the gear more
XDU doesn't have the writing quality to carry it
XDU is the mobile gatcha game
but it really did feel inevitable due to marketing pressure
if XDU wasn't a thing, miku getting SSJ would have surprised me
I feel XDU actually did weaken it a bit
it rolls off a lot more smoothly in japanese
<@255411266473033728> it makes a little more sense why it's so important because it's actually one of the three royal sacred treasures of japan
no
what?
ver's awful and it'd be the single biggest writing mistake XV could ever make to bring him back
she has an arc to wrap up and help to give
Vanessa's still alive but probably dying
they'll be discovered next episode
Anyway
You don't have to be strong to move the plot along
Please, they were the best antagonist characters symphogear's ever had
but it's a possibility
*probably* not
it's just, is it good enough to fix this?
she's been stated to have regeneration - she complained her normal regen wasn't working on the cut Kirika gave her
MIllaarc actually has more chance of being alive than Elsa
this isn't impossible
mind you
Elsa is only not dead if she has non-human anatomy with her vital organs not being where they are supposed to be
I noticed that last night
yeah
well, I think they're pretty great and wish you could enjoy them <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
his plans were crap
Dr Ver kept having things fall into his lap
Shirabe took the single braincell with her when she defected
FIS not accomplishing anything is a running joke on this server actually
they were
FIS were fighting much weaker opponents
I don't think so
not as weak as FIS though <:laughatyou:579135727808413698>
they're an interesting end-justifies-the-means set of cute girls
they're cute, they do neat things
what's your point
yeah
idk NR's been pretty popular in japan
worst character is ver imo
them being fun and interesting on screen and a good foil makes them good antagonists
it just seems to be higher when religion is involved
generally any male authority figure in anime has a good chance of being evil
Carol's own bad choices and petulant anger are the reason for her being evil; her dad's death didn't make her evil, it only gave her a reason to choose the foolish path she chose
she knew what she was doing was wrong
Her arguments weren't ever designed to convince anyone
it would have had the autoscorers anyway
GX had a really interesting story it chose not to tell because it was too busy telling bad stories
she just chose to turn her back on her goodness in order to get revenge
elfnein is made of her feelings and memories
if she wasn't, elfnein  couldn't exist
Carol's interesting, because she was always a good person at heart
It might have been like "do we make the autoscorers a scene or an episode at the cost of cramming stuff later"
I feel like there was some planning shifts
it's also worth remembering that Tsubasa's CD was pushed back to this point
I'm suspecting this whole episode was supposed to be an episode and a half
you see her arm flying across the frame
possibly 4
Millaarc is in three pieces now
wait, who are you talking about
even if it wasn't from tsubasa
well, at least we got the ideon sword reference I wanted
is pissing me off every time now
that animation error
power differences encourage abuse
XV is much more painful to wait for the next ep than AXZ was
welcome to the club
she kicked her
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
horizon effect
so millaarc's killcount is .5
half a name
that's like
he had a title
don't you know how anime works
nameless so she's not a real person
maybe
I guess the inspector counts
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
while millaarc killed 0
yeah, she killed actual people
Miku now has the highest named character killcount
I'm going to miss Millaarc's shit-eating grin
<:sadmiku:432799416227725312>
"nice relic dad, have you seen my shichishito"
it was Dads Doing Dad Things
yo meta
with the ending message that "understanding is important because without it everyone fucking dies"
and just go full Ideon
what if symphogear decided to derail
sometimes I just wonder
we might not have another protagonist death
I ranked him as the most likely to die but if Yatsuhiro's actually dead then he's probably off the hook
not anymore
This isn't that kind of show
I don't think any one of the 7 main girls is going to die
that same thing is no longer a factor
something very significant happened the year before symphogear came out that was the cause of the grim tone of season 1
very unlikely
turns out symphogear's a fictional story in-universe
Clearly that's the cast getting together after they shoot the show
<@!400844698140409856> That's not an acceptable kind of joke here
this is 00 quanta with a bunch of equipment from 00 and exia slapped on lol
did someone say 26 swords
what a good zelda game
or have split yourself in to 4 bodies
lol
let me have mine <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
gunbuster, aside from the pose is much more rare
all the time
Rider fans get rider kick references like
in addition, both gunbuster and diebuster have characters do an "inazuma kick" which is a triangle kick with a flash of lightning behind it
is buster collider, where spikes jut out and electrify the enemy
one of gunbuster's special moves
okay so like
You can't just count every triangle kick as a rider reference
they're inazuma kicks
meta they're not rider kicks at all
you can punch it after it's cut in half
or, if you need something more recent, Buster Machine 7
Ideon Sword style
I want Tsubasa to cut the moon in half
I have faith in our girls to save Miku
I've loved the whole ride so far
I mean, if they never threw a hard punch I'd have been really disappointed in XV
seconded
"some would argue this is overkill, but she was really annoying"
"I got really tired of Fine's sexts, so we built a language scrambler"
no
that would imply there's some max limit of phonic gain that represents 100% connection or "punch-through" of the curse, doesn't it
interesting theory
reminds me of McCaffery's Talent series
you're right, of course, but I'm just saying it's an ending that could happen
I mean, it's the conclusion of >moon keeps everyone from understanding + >understanding is the key to getting along
but none of us could really imagine that world or find solace in that ending because it's so unrelatably out of reach
"now that there are no languages, everyone is in harmony" is certainly an ending that could happen
but if the theme is inapplicable to an audience, they're not going to form a connection
if a theme has resonance, it doesn't matter all that much what absurd shit's going on screen, meta
the theme of "conflict can be mitigated or fixed if we just  try to find a way to communicate" is pretty relatable
uh
and we're absolutely committed to this course now with the *really obvious foreshadowing* of Akira saying "a curse can be a blessing depending on how you look at it"
having the final message be "just remove all barriers of communication and everyone is happy" is going to find resonance with no one, so the obvious solution is the girls are going to find out they need to either leave it on or, more likely, turn it back on in some form
that's a non-relateable ending
if you end the story with removing the curse?
from a storytelling point of view
because like
the curse is for everyone's benefit and perfect understanding is just something to live without
my gut feeling since G or GX or so have doubled down
I remember a book I really liked involved people having to find the name of god so they could repeat it to a fallen angel to chastise it
yeah, sure, it's just not really accurate to call it god's hidden name
in actual religion
tetragrammaton
like
shemha is less god's name and more a name for a name
via lunar ruins curse
I predict miku's going to be saved by giving her back sin
what her amalgam is based off of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-Branched_Sword
And I *just* warned a user about this the other day, but saying "eh, X tragedy/suffering is worse" is not really ok
<@506219877724454929> do you mind not dropping shit about warcrimes in a channel about discussing anime when it's completely unrelated?
üá´
rip noble red
maybe he's a big RE4 fan
I mean you can have a Mauser C96 without being in ww2
She's also the one it's implied came up with the whole "landmine > Daedalus end" thing, because when she finds the tracker, she's like "we need to get ready for them"
like you can keep doubling down because you don't like them but it's there
> Compared to Vanessa and Millaarc, she may be lacking in raw power but makes up for it in strategy, tactics, quick-wittedness, and flexibility.
here's her episode 2 keyword
> Despite being the most junior of the remnants, she is considered to be a notable genius and reliable organizer.
here's her bio from the website
before Vanessa goes after it
Vanessa *calls in* and Elsa's the one who makes the call on what to do
with the ogawa car scene
biggest example
like
It's keywords, but if you pay attention, she's the one who comes up with ideas on the fly
The seal was probably a request by fudou, but the way to attack the concert was probably elsa
Elsa raided the hospital while DMJii engaged Millaarc on the roof
the hospital bloodpack scene was a success btw
all the actually important stuff
you know
retrieving the bracelet
Implanting a seal in Tsubasa
those aren't plans
well, I guess Adam didn't really overlook anything dumb, but his plan was also not really complex, so
everyone else has overlooked some pretty dumb stuff
only Carol's done a better job planning in symphogear
most of NR's plans went pretty well, considering
They would not let Tsubasa kill Millaarc
what would be the point
They did fight a few times but like
Including the way they did the concert attack, probably
she came up with all of NR's plans
Like, literally
She was the brains
but it's a little unsatisfying
Anyway considering Vanessa's around to finish their arc I don't think it's *bad* writing, since it does serve a purpose
And they wanted to expand another part of the show (autoscorers, maybe?)
I also think this episode was originally an episode and a half in planning
though
I think it's abrupt to establish Shem-ha's power level
Vanessa was somehow cut and fell over, but we only see it from her viewpoint (she is probably not dead yet)
Elsa got speared in the chest and half her chest sliced, Millaarc had her torso sliced in half and lost one or both of her arms
while he might, I'm privately hedging that Fudou doesn't get definitively answered for a few more eps
still can't believe he fucking had kusanagi
he thinks his idea is the correct one and everyone else is a buffoon
but at the same time
No, fudou's not an egotist
they were
Fudou is a mockery of the concepts blind nationalism and family loyalty without family love
you're starting to make a clown out of yourself by backpedalling for reasons to not care about the conversation
I think it's pretty solid
Elsa's shown being the leader, definitively, twice
They're not on the screen very long
it makes sense to be fudou
rather than
as you said, it's all speculation, but it feels like you want it to be fudou
fudou still intends to be the protector of japan and destroying infrastructure is slightly less likely to come from him
her coming up with it makes more sense than fudou coming up with it
Fudou probably was just like "attack"
*probably* Elsa's idea
bringing the building down
Actually
I think the closest you can cut dubbing to air is like, 3 weeks, without it being a nightmare?
FIS didn't deserve like, anything they had handed to them
yeah
most of what the alchemists did in AXZ was chew screentime while we waited for the endgame to happen
they did fuck-all
it's not like SG did a whole lot in AXZ, mind you
until she's actually dead
we don't know that
god I prefer all 3 of NR seeming relevant
haha remember AXZ and how it was obvious none of the alchemists mattered except SG
it was a computer-enslaved god to act as a defense system for japan
I mean, we saw his endgame here
as a relic it's pretty much entirely ceremonial
Shichishito doesn't really have any lore about sword breaking
you kinda scrunch your face a lot
but going back over it
AXZ is like G in that the first run through it seems really good
I guess
fudou is politically fucking destroyed
so unless the implication is that "killing bad guys is fine as long as it's not family," it's fucked
and it was celebrated
but she's already attempted murder before
sure
but only because AXZ really fucked up the tone on its own
Gen stopping tsubasa is the first thing XV has done that has made a previous season worse
fucking hell though
and get killed by either shem-ha or circumstance there
I do suspect fudou will end up on the moon
the story will never portray it as a bad move
even if fudou goes and kills a bunch more
gen will never regret stopping tsubasa
only Maria was deployed to the mansion
commiserating with everyone else on tsubasa's betrayal
elfnein was at song
well, yeah, it's the fastest to redo errors, because they're done on the spot
it's fairly unusual in this age to be months ahead
You can cut it closer but you're going to be dropping QA
the primary things are XDU, the concerts, and the radio show
that's beautiful
like how kanade's in nijiro no flugel
we might get a 9 gear song without them being ghosts
but won't be in miku's body at the time
I think shem ha might be the final boss
I think it was either just a Really Good Sword or it was an inactive relic that functioned similarly to a Really Good Sword
and yeah, I don't think Murakumo was an active relic at all
and superhero origin
I'm not going to compare it against s1 because s1 was a different genre - it was coming of age
but XV's first two thirds are better than any other non-s1 season
whether XV holds up is going to depend on the ending
because they have to dig into an epilogue
10 minutes after 13 starts the plot will be resolved
by the time 13 starts the plot's going to be almost over
I mean
and then another climax to destroy shem-ha
that we'll have a seperate climax for freeing miku
I just think there's so many possible ways to bullshit shem-ha being around without Miku
that we're going to be beating up miku
you're missing the point
rather than some giant Shem-ha construct
that'd mean they'd be using the killer finale moves on Miku
I'd be a little surprised
probably a full ep or two
miku's going to be freed from shem-ha some time before shem-ha is the final boss
he's likely going to throw one final small wrench in some gears somewhere and then get killed by either shem-ha or, more likely, circumstance like vacuum or explosion or rubble
I agree
yeah no I meant villain teams/6th ranger magical girls
it's a mainstay of sailor moon-era magical girls
uh
Nana's a veteran voice actress at this point and she probably sees a little bit of herself in all her characters and has learned to compartmentalize
probably a little but you're probably projecting some
dark magical girls are another magical girl concept that gets used a lot, especially in conjunction with "understanding" and "communication"
but like, that's a huge chunk of media
in that it's about understanding, I guess
A) she's an actor, B) her, like, big VA break was Fate Testarossa who has way worse parent problems?
I'm going to guess that the whole dad dying scene wasn't *that* hard on Nana
"maybe attaching junk to symphogears is bad"
because it's kind of... not needed
but I'm pretty sure they removed the fool's stone
spellcaster blew up didn't it
incorporated into the gears
it's kind of
rather
they never got the philo stone from SG
yeah but the reason it cancels it is just "because it does"
yeah that's a lot of ?????
> The nickname given to the unanalyzed substance that once fell off of Hibiki's chest. Chris Yukine thought up the name. In the past, Hibiki's body was fused with the fragments of Gungnir (the first medical case of a fusion between human and sacrist). As the fusion grew deeper, it gave birth to various supernatural phenomena. One example of this was Spontaneous Combustion - the abnormal rise of Hibiki's body temperature to extreme levels. The inside of her body became like a kiln, creating a substance that eventually grew outside of the body and was collected. The research teams determined the substance had a composition extremely similar to that of the human body and the phase during which it was created was fixed at an imaginary number. Various parts of it differed from the makeup of the human body and it was temporarily filed as an undiscovered substance. Up until this point, it had been stored at a special location along with other unanalyzed objects that are controlled by the Japanese Government in cooperation with the United Nations. When Elfnein read the report about this object she didn't approach it scientifically as the research teams did, but rather applied her own unique approach as an Alchemist. She realized that the identity of the substance was like a "Philosopher's stone set in a negative phase." From there, she began to build her hypothesis.
because hibiki created it, I think
because using hibiki's gross-ass scabs makes the relics icky I guess
yeah, they could only ignite once with the fool stone
yeah
and the other is yeah, there's actually drawbacks and nuance to what it does
one, they had reasons to not use it - AXZ actually gave them reasons, they were just too, uh, dumb to pick up on them
amalgam has two qualities they should have used with ignite
pgsm is legit one of the best toku shows I have watched
I don't really read song lyrics on the first watch so
probably
heavencloud
but
it was goofy
that's very fair
"adds the most to the show while they're in it"
I guess my definition of "best villain" in this context is
Carol could have been amazing but GX's writing let her down
I'll also agree that I really like Fine
NR were really fantastic even if they struggled to accomplish things
imo
XV
regardless of what she wants
He says Maria's going to help him repopulate the earth
even then I think he would have been a bad villain, but as you said, he was supposed to be more comedic
the rape line (really not needed for anything) and the AXZ plot
Ver would have been fine without two things
functional?
he's
fudou isn't all that likeable as a villain
You do not have to be a good person to be likeable - many or most people are able to seperate "enjoy their presence on the screen and what they contribute to the show" from "is someone you'd want to hang out with in real life"
Millaarc is one of my favorite characters in the show and she's pretty unrepetently a bitch
they probably would
you asked if anyone would like elsa if she wasn't a cute dog girl and yes
to contribute to the conversation, oclisto
carol's is also something I enjoyed more than the gears this season I think
I think my favorite is the sanjelman duet
how far is the ytt version
or omniscence
it'll be interesting if they go with omnipotence
does miku know about the godkilling properties of gungnir
like a repeat of the god-awful form-changing "chateau defense system" in GX
it feels too personal for Shem-ha's attention
I don't think they could do that and do it well
the moon's just a building mystery/anticipation
like, hanging on the edge of a cliff
a cliffhanger's supposed to be the interruption of action
I think you have to stretch the meaning of cliffhanger to include the moon activation
no cliffhanger this week
they're probably dead and they might be brought back to life later with divine power
I think they're probably dead though
the final possibility is vanessa somehow makes something that keeps her friends alive
Elsa can survive her wound if she doesn't have her organs where they're supposed to be, which is unlikely but a non-zero chance
whether it's "replace all my organs" quality regeneration who knows
she complained that Kirika's wound doesn't heal like normal
millaarc's been stated to have regeneration
I think you need to consume more types of media
yeah, I think it's more like Miku is the car and if you control the steering linkage, it doesn't really matter what the driver does
<:JiiBored:442974565258231820>
because the song tells us Miku really was personally invested in beating the shit out of Hibiki and everyone else so there'd be no more fighting in Hibiki's world
in G it didn't do much other than to selectively control Miku's already present impulses
it's probably way more advanced than G
true heroes
fudou'd probably end up winning everything
if NR hadn't been there and tried to reboot it
you know
yeah I'm pretty sure she was changing parameters
I don't think any of us really expect kanade to come back like that unless they drop a reason
"fellas, is it gay to buy matching bath toys"
they even share a best friend bed in a total heterosexual life mate fashion
Agematsu was supervising but he didn't compose everything
Elements Garden, but who exactly I don't think they say
that's probably going overboard on fanservice
but
I also want an excuse to shove the original three into their s1 gears with songs
goddamn that'd be strong
I kinda want a chris fakeout death with this
honestly
prepare your tissues everyone
I lied it's on 3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PANLJiR2A8&list=PL_-pqBbmYl0_k2l6c8rs64XT-ABb0ycf8&index=5
no, it's on OST 2
s1 was amazing at leitmotifs
oh its a playlist how nice
and a few other spots
this is the opening to ep 1
it was the strongest season for bgm
So glad XV's using more of s1's stuff
I don't think I noticed this was First Love Song until my third watch of ep 1
saturday if you're fine with crunchyroll subs
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Maria Solves Everything might be the one thing that could disappoint me more than Bikki Solves Everything
you don't do that to heroes unless you don't care if they look powerless
that would destroy a lot of her heroism
I also find Maria getting kidnapped pretty unlikely
I find that pretty unlikely
yeah uh it's been a while hasn't it
lmao
idk what you're all up about
it is totally normal for girls to sleep in the same bed when there's two beds in the room and to call each other their sunshine and their shining sun
clearly they are heterosexual life mates
but it's definitely the one that makes more money
It's one of the reasons I think the push towards duets everywhere and such is really not an upside for the musical direction of the show
because you hear them a maximum of like twice a season
*especially* starting at AXZ
really bad for leitmotifs
I feel that most symphogear music post-G is
Actually
I wish symphogear would do something similar like it did with hibiki's s1 b-side
not even remotely lol
Gun!
I'd rather they didn't bring back ignite
one is a drama, the other SoL
it's why I liked shirobako but not new game
I prefer drama
I'm not very fond of them
madoka came out the year before
Especially since all that would have to change is about 3 minutes of footage
not even close
It's not unprecedented
they realized they did not, in fact, need to mimic madoka to be successful
I think the ending was revised
I mean, I don't think it was a clickbait
kaneko doesn't have the heart
until miku comes back
saving miku hasn't been an implied part of the conversation to this point
I mean
AXZ's godkiller conceptual weapon idea makes shem-ha pretty not scary in terms of absolute power
I mean apparently all it takes is a pointy stick that people *think* can beat a god
I mean a lot of things can one-up shemha in fiction - most of the metaphysical superjuggernauts I know of
I'm pretty sure in symphogear you're looking at her in Miku
this is a goku vs superman level debate
it's all vague and generic fictional power level arguments, really
didn't happen
Xan's point was that shem-ha would be able to fix herself with a dimension where that
that's fine then
the textbook definition
is
I mean posting content with the objective to upset people
careful, that's borderline trolling
also "random man shows up to solve everything in a magical girl show" is pretty much the worst idea I've read this week, for the record
are we really going to have a power level argument
they're comfy feel-good shows
like, I see their point, but the juxtaposition and setting contrast put some interesting strains on it
<:Thinkki:514552069563088896>
this website calls girls last tour an iyashikei and I'm
even though they're both career anime
but not a fucking minor character
some fakeouts can feel great
I mean, usually
fakeouts are worse
but
not that death = good writing
from a writing perspective I hope this was an actual sacrifice
I think I lost my last shred of caution after Kirika zesshou'd and then walked into the command center 5 minutes later
the show just can't convince me that they're in danger
not that I want anything bad to happen to them, mind you
I can't
but after the last 60 episodes
I really wish I could believe that anything permanently bad could happen to the main 7
she'll be fine at the end
the one she used the homing bullets in
it was a thing earlier yeah
very full of shortcuts
it was uh
the montage where they're observing the shuttle prep
Yeah the bad points were way worse than the normal bad points
it's probably just managing the budget, but jesus
Am I the only one who noticed the animation quality fucking dive this episode
we're now firmly on the path to redeeming all of NR I think
almost nobody gets them anymore and villains can just ignore them now smh
XV really shitting on the attack card tradition
zababa does what tsubadon't
The only attack cards I remember were pre-amalgam
I don't remember it but maybe it did
Krika said basa had one
She only gets attack cards when she has an armed gear or relic
shem-ha used it maybe
it was just in no way exceptional, I guess - especially since half of it was overridden with dialogue
it wasn't bad
it was fine
~~shame the duet was not really great~~
<:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552> <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552> <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552> <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552> <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
tiny hat
they're probably at the bottom of the gear power list individually but they beat everyone when teamed up
it's their gimmick
Zababa in unison has generally been the strongest force outside of X-drive
this is the worst baron ashura I've ever seen
I'm aware of the connection
shem-ha looks like a yugioh lady
we've been waving around Gungnir the whole time
I mean
yggdrasill is a very big deal in wild arms but at the same time it's a big deal in myth
like, it's a weak reference
but it's also not *right*
Saying yggdrasill is a wild arms reference isn't *wrong*
we knew cheat powers would be in play after ep 1 yeah
like, at full power
it sounds like she basically had omnipotence tbh
(my upload rate on discord is shit so it'll take a while for example images to come through)

Vanessa's been going full SRT since like ep 4
it had tapes that it'd use to throw tops
actually
the *tape* is possibly a reference to Voltes V
aside from the name
It's nothing like Voltes V
"it's *this*"
it's similar to a lot but nothing I can say
I don't know what the V combine is quite referring to
but

that's iron cutter
that's not rocket punch
that's actually the antagonist of the next yugioh season
~~I don't remember what it did in 3~~
I might believ eyou
if Yggdrasill does similar shit to wild arms
now
wildly postulating to justify your emotional feeling that shem-ha should be above trying to attack it on the ground
now you're just reaching
Elsa specifically said "oh dang we should have expected they'd predict this"
they didn't know the gears would be there
Recall that they made a big deal out of Hibiki's dad saying a curse and a blessing are the same thing, just depends on how you look at it
yeah probably
if shem ha wants to
she could be in the tower
she might not even be on the moon right now
the big question
of course
and
Maria was also 20 feet away from her
the closer you get the more information you get
that's *not how sensors work*
that's not how sensors work
that's
Shem-ha clearly isn't at an all-powerful level yet if Maria can brush her attacks off like that
Perhaps she doesn't want SONG to get the observations they'd get
and all Hibiki did was fucking faceplant
She's seen Hibiki exactly once
Please keep in mind
I expect Gungnir to be deleted
she also has SSJ
but
With her godslaying power, she's probably a legit threat
with her as the conductor
just, you know
I think she wants perfect harmony
I actually think her offer was genuine
that's weak, solo
ehhh
well, miku's supposedly wiped from existence and so can't give her the influence the fanart was hoping for
there's a good chance she is either there or going to go there
we have no way of knowing but she made two capsules
yeah probably
shem-ha's been using less of her power than shaggy
I think that perfect understanding will not be portrayed as something to ultimately quest after by the show because it's not a relevant message to viewers
when they remove the curse everyone dissolves into orange tang and komm susser todd starts playing
I'm not the one who thinks that it doesn't make sense that what happened in the show happened
if an identical twin saves your life that doesn't make his brother not a jackass
I think it does matter if you're talking about redemption
but ok
that's not how ghosts work
that was Maria's mind
that was not his ghost
ver was dead
ver didn't unlock shit
technically
that's just doubling down on him being right to tyrannize everyone because he wanted to be in power
that's not how redemption works
no
but that's not a redemption
like, sure, Adam was right about the danger
<@202536957685923841> adam
nooooo
it got deleted???
oh no
https://twitter.com/SpWhiteBs/status/1156387427377790976
anyway if we're talking about NR as normal people
if that counts as "disguised as normal people" then sure
they could walk around in coats, hats, and sunglasses
I meany, yes
the animal ears and fangs?
what
with
Vanessa is beauty <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
We're now dealing with people who can do things that are literally not possible
She's more likely to be incorrect than lying
it's less punished, it's easier to forgive
it's still less of a sentence irl
yeah
People seek justice less when the action doesn't get followed through
Yes
than committed murder
punish less for attempted murder
we, in real life
And yeah, Sorano
People don't want the show to end on a note of "Millaarc did good in the end, so it's okay to remember her fondly despite her being the biggest mass murderer in the show"
it's the show narratively absolving them of their crimes
I think what people are afraid of when it comes to NR isn't them seeking redemption
that's what SG was in the show for
Adam didn't have to be redeemable
I mean
<@202536957685923841> hi! welcome to the magical girl genre, which is filled with ideals such as communication, connection, friendship, love, and the belief in the fundamental good
with the exception of Ver
Symphogear has had the villains have nuanced and sympathetic motivations
because she's originally a good person
Carol is *only* a villain through anger
and he needs to be in control to do it
He's convinced only he can stop Shem-ha
No, he does it because he's megalomanic
"Adam was trying to take over the world by force for a non-selfish reason" is not a redemption
does it redeem the character? no
sure
like, does it make merchandising him easier?
and I'm saying your meta-narrative analysis doesn't hold up when talking about an actual redemption arc
<@185949743321579520> do you have a timestamp
1/10000 is a simple number in japanese
I'd believe it
Go Nagai is to mecha as what Tezuka is to anime overall
also devilman
he helped invent magical girls, too
so uh
also for Cutie Honey
Go nagai's responsible for all the Mazingers and most of the Getters
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Dynamic Pro is the name of the license holder of most of Go Nagai's stuff
millaarc is not a good person but goddammit I love her time onscreen
da ze
Also because she has the best KAZANARI TSUBASA!! cry
Vanessa is the team mom and morale leader
all the keywords are very clear on that
Elsa's the tactician of the team
Even keeping SONG away from uncovering details for a week would be a huge benefit
<@185949743321579520> I'm guessing Elsa advised it to destroy evidence of who NR were
Millaarc has 70k+ first degree counts
to put it another way, SG has a lot of 3rd degree accounts
Millaarc was out to do numbers
SG counts people who she didn't necessarily want dying but were in the way
I think that's fair to do, right?
or explosive?
are we treating alcanoise like a gun?
I mean
so
says
she
they were people who died because of her plans and actions
Also SG didn't personally kill 73,811
I think calling her the biggest mass murderer is still fair!
Milaarc was "70,000ish"
SG was 73,811
We don't know
Being pedantic
Actually
what was he to do, imprison her?
SONG was shut down and all agents placed on leave
he had no one to guard her with
I mean
Ver and friends took most of the relics FIS had with them to feed the nephilim but maybe the government had already removed the fragments or maybe the US government reclaimed them after FIS got kicked out of their hospital base
Fine was passing materials to FIS
Remember that Fine jacked the SSJ as shown in G
but people here were discussing it for about 2 weeks before it came up for real
you saw an image of it on the terminals Vanessa was setting up around Miku
They were really subtle about SSJ
the curse would absolutely destroy her power
If Shem-Ha *is* words and understanding
where ideas shape reality
we have stuff like that in play
Try to think really pretentiously because yeah
I mean, this would be a concept as a cosmic force
Understanding
despite being
so it would not understand itself?
a god being the very concept of understanding makes sense - the very concept of understanding would have self-awareness, would it not?
percent's pretty easy for english speakers to pick out, as Japan generally uses "paasento"
which would be the harder way to say percent
She never says percent and I don't think she said "1/100th"
btw this is probably the most important line this episode
We knew Miku's going to wear a gear
I'd have hated 5 episodes of knowing Miku's going to eat it
yeah we'd have known miku's getting kidnapped
**when no one else can**
how do they know they're going to make a symphogear system out of it
only "relic in Symphogear system"s are locked to specific people
we're trying to differentiate between "relic in Symphogear system" and "relic in faust robe/complete relic"
just different shards
SG-r03 and SG-r03' are effectively the same gear
We're talking about relics as used in symphogears
I mean
It's not
cleanse the curse off someone else
they could just make their own Miku with that logic
actually a reason they might think Miku is *not* in danger
that's uh
is not a logical stretch
Saying it's related to her in a way that threatens her
By association, not by logic
Pretty sure anyone could be slapped in a faust robe
not every gear user can use every *symphogear*
actually that's not true
*tied* to miku?
SSJ isn't
I also don't think that SSJ fragments would necessitate that "OH MIKU MUST BE IN DANGER"
linker is one hell of a drug
man
instead of Shirabe's
because she's letting her soul take Igalima's hit
of Fine talking to Shirabe
It's why you get this big scene when Shirabe takes the scythe in the bakc
I don't have G on this hard drive, but they bring it up twice that Igalima's zesshou reaps souls
I have a feeling it broke off because the regolith was a lot less tough than the ruins
and Kirika's just fucking carrying it around in her gear
harvested
but
imagine if the souls aren't deleted
golden wings
X-drive Amalgam
supposedly from everyone
Kirika's scythe supposedly deleted it
forever
Fine's soul is supposed to be dead
probably not really in the files
but all the shit elfnein's been working on in GX etc
the world now probably knows what an aufwachen is
does not mean it includes an instruction manual on Symphogears
I think releasing "sakurai theory" on how relics work
she wore all of them in that silver form
we already did that in AXZ tho
this whole season
I have been praying for Miku to use Gungnir
I mean
the AXZ conversation implied that Hibiki and Miku might be able to wear any symphogear
above average bromance though
honestly yeah
or the fragments we have, anyway
I don't recall anything jumping out at me when I read the epic
in not-fate-land
does gilgamesh even have any actual relics
I think enkidu has some chains
does gilgamesh even have any relics associated with him in actual myth
where are XV 9 keywords translated
so uh
I use zesshou but I'm not going to pretend it should be subbed like that
fucking Ms Kirika "I sang my zesshou 5 minutes ago what's up my dudes" Akatsuki
I think they should have just kept it near-fatal <:ChrisAngerDess:611252450346795132>
even when they don't die they all intend it to their final bang
It works in all of s1
It was never a good *translation*
but it no longer works
Swan song was a fine localization for the original
given it's satelight we have a pretty good chance of a recap movie
but it's not the entire episode
sure
god I am so excited for shirobako movie
so it's not outsourcing
<:15min:453039155975553035>
remember when they forgot to animate people coming back in GX
this is pretty blech though
yes
or cheap, rushed animation
and the flat pans aren't an error but they're a sign of cheap, bad animation
the miscolored bikki pants are an error

there's a lot of poorly drawn details that will probably get polished in BD, but the biggest cry for help was that flat pan across static scenes for the shuttle prep
it wasn't a horrible mess but it was a noticeable drop
10 either had budget slashed, was outsourced to a cheap studio, or was time crunched
I wouldn't fucking guarantee it
judging by what I was seeing in 10
idk
"it's probably already animated"
always be genuine
solid gag
ty
we've explicitly had the music of the spheres be a thing
ah, back when iron man was a c-lister
so in a few months
expect it on like BD 3 or something probably
you mean the album version?
I'm not a fan but it's guaranteed to be relevant
And probably it's apple
Despite seeming like they cannot
I think it's a pretty good bet that songs will save the world
This isn't a normal everyday "I'm excited" phrase
She didn't
Carol could have used terms that didn't have sexual connotations
Another sub group translated it as "there's a tingling below my belly"
Yes
She's turned on
Carol's dialogue is overtly horny at one point
That
Carol dressing elfnein in
Carol being horny
Ver's repopulation plan
She was grabbed without consent, you'd be shocked too
I feel like the show might end with the quest always on and the lesson that it's actually a blessing because it's not understanding each other that matters, it's the *desire* to reach out and understand
What does "banished to hell" even mean
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
it's Good
<@!142136901602770944> is it alright if I swipe the bikki one too
That looks better
Hmmm
Kinda like how she has spy glasses
I think she said that because she's a giant nerd
Shirabe revealing she is at least a big as nerd as Kiri is always good culture
I wish it were otherwise but they're just not positioned well to be super relevant
It's fine for her to be on the backfoot
Chris has been main character in like 3 seasons
she qualifies the whole way
oh nvm
The deuteragonist may switch between supporting and opposing the protagonist, depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict or plot.
Maybe even for part of the first series
from Nanoha? Absolutely, past the first series
I mean technically it's the second most important character
When you have a pair of primary characters instead of a single protagonist
like Planetes or Eureka 7
The only time I've seen better than Miku is when they're a straight up deuteroganist
so maybe it will
I mean Hibiki is eating dirt a *lot* this season
it won't happen but *I want it*
I really want Hibiki to eat pavement and then Miku wears Gungnir to save the day for a few minutes while the other gears get Hibiki back
the frame the avatar is from
I do not know whether killing them was required for that
I think she put a fraction of her power into them to complete them
I don't think so
would explain why the curse of balal fucks her over
which uh
It's either that or shem-ha gets her power from the concept of communication or something
it's Shirabe because it's "extreme beta style"
It's Kirika because of how it's written
across 3-4 different alphabets
yeah it's a reflection of Kirika's horrible habit of mixing how she writes her special attack

*gods in mythology and all of history
the omnipotent being lost, which was pretty fuckin rad
Asura's wrath had a fight against an omnipotent being iirc
that's only because DBZ is designed so you can fix any problem by punching it hard enough
still be infinite
if she had infinite power, a small fraction of it would
technically that'd imply she's not omnipotent
(which are not the same, none of the greek gods were omnipotent)
just god-like
I don't think they've ever implied her to be omnipotent
Armados has demonstrated he doesn't understand magical girls over and over
She can do things that don't really agree with physics but she obviously cannot currently overwhelm a symphogear's systems through brute force
Maria blocked her shots
She's clearly not that powerful right now
communication is obviously going to be incredibly important to defeating her yes
DBZ doesn't ever help
just in a constrained fashion
Avalon might be considered true omnipotence, tbh
an omnipotent force would overwhelm an absolute defense
Avalon's a point of example of it not being omnipotent though
like, I don't think enuma elish would defeat type-moon
enuma elish isn't the most powerful thing in the setting
There are things that can block his attacks, there are things that can overpower them
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
so
gilgamesh isn't omnipotent
that said
character flaws are not part of nor do they negate omnipotence
whether you're willing to use it
not
"omnipotence" has to do with capacity
also wow
which, really, there isn't a way to fight
the gods in nasuverse are the planet-class entities, generally
if this is a iPhone idk
I don't use apple but I don't know what would keep it from working like windows?
generally you find a download and then do that
including the OPs
<@!246678192360783872> it also has all of nana's discography
we're going to get a mood-killer song for the climax not once, but twice
the true antag has always been apple
also supported by Apple
(the Fine part because she's an FIS test child)
that seems to be the direction the show is going
It would seem so yeah
Enki apologized to her but that doesn't mean they had a thing
no, but no one said that Fine was into Enki
I mean the babal curse was almost certainly put in place to specifically depower/stymie shem-ha
also glad that turns out fine was a raging lesbian the whole time
I hope she keeps the dress
Honestly Gear's philosophical weapons are easier to understand if you've read some fate stuff, yeah, as they use similar philosophies
they asked if they could no longer become human
she never lied
because she didn't want human underlings
"If you can build a motorcycle, why didn't you build a regular bicycle"
I think it's more like
that was the implication the episode was dropping
because it doesn't want to because it thinks humans are shit
I'm good at defusing <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I don't know what she's on about not being able to connect because I'd date her
Vanessa is very <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
I agree, a robot pairs really well with a tree on fire
steve rogers needs twintails
I think dmjii are due for a bunch of unisons anyway
so give them new moves for their amalgam cards
which is what x-drive and ignite were
why would it be something other than just another unit
probably
print high cost cards
just
giant black and gold spikes everywhere
honestly it sounds too much
Enki's apple <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but that's *pure* conjecture
that once you're perfected, in either direction, you end up in some sort of final resting state
It's also possible there's something philosophical going on here
I don't think they can do it on their own
answer's fuckin no
if she's not about to make them human
ssj deletes the gears while they're fighting in space
the finale of symphogear
it's either going to be a teleporter or they're going to have a moving fight back towards the earth
Tsubasa's gear was even extending beyond the shuttle's heat shield
sure they had a shuttle but they weren't inside it
in GX 1
kinda did that
they
I mean
judging from GX 1, yes
anime girl standards are impossible
it's just natural movement when you're yanked when surprised
pretty sure
it's not her smiling at it
Watch in fluid animation
sounds like a job for carmen sandiego
shrink it and steal it
roll credits
they all die of exposure
Millaarc can now probably actually drink blood
yeah
under what wasn't even full mind control
miku killed several hundred people
kinda like
including the concert outfits
That dress is the best costume design gear has had to date
Kaneko's stated in interviews he really prefers happy endings
gungnir probably won't
both bikki and miku will live
We have no idea where Shem-ha is currently
she might still be on earth
possibly Shem-ha
Yggdrasill
is how I see it
she's going to die
if carol comes back
I don't think any of us have very large bets on her definitely surviving the end of XV
but
yes, carol's currently present
who knows if elfnein can
she clearly could use alchemy to manipulate her age
carol had stronger alchemy skills
it's what made Godannar go from "kinda good" to "pretty good"
a year later
and then we get a full episode epilogue
my dream is the final fight concludes at the very end of episode 12
that's awful
hahaha oh noooooo
not like there's a loss there
so
but Serena wasn't a character
aside from stuff like Serena I guess
the interactions having canonically taken place or not doesn't really affect the fact that the characters they describe are still the same
but they're the same characters
just keep churning out the endless stream of events
I mean you don't need gaidens for "character interactions"
I'm not a huge fan of pretty meaningless gaiden stories
I'll pass
I mean if 3.5's weird pharaoh stuff is the level of story content we could expect from those
the contextual set-up for GX was amazing and imagine if we had a season of nothing but SONG responding to disasters in extreme ways
yeah
even when they're fighting the big bads
the girls fight noise in pretty much every battle of every series
but
I like noise
AXZ ep 1 felt like more of the same, just extreme
big plus
also there were no noise
I preferred it over the AXZ ep 1 tbh but it was probably mostly the song
yes, k2 was the mountain in GX
she punched a mountain open
duh???
in one swing
she'd have punched all the shot out of the way
I want to see it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZASOvtEABsE
oh my god I bet she can
oh my god what if vanessa can turn x now
well
they managed to nail the worst one
amazing
what
names are a little, uh, nonintuitive due to how kanji works, but I believe hers is in fact straightforward
I believe so
resonate
ultraspecial mode
I expect we'll end with X-drive amalgam
a single blast of their energy shut ignite down
because the Faust Robes hard-countered ignite
no
I want to see aoi's drawing for elsa because this is cute as shit
interesting
I think Vanessa's spine and organs were still intact and needed blood
hibiki and miku
plebians
it's obviously a tales of phantasia reference
instead of „É´„É†
I think -„É™„É† might actually *be* a typo at this point
which, I mean, is proper
JP uses „Éù„É™„Éï„Ç£„É´„Çπ
not quite
hm, true
because it's a perfectly fine way to read the kana
which text doesn't say polyfilm
Was there really no way to keep the textual reference and yet also the term polyfilm because that was obviously supposed to be a nod to shirabe's sciencey stuff
I guess I retract that, but
You mean aside from the sailors she murders in g
Yep
There's still a decent chance Tsubasa gets a final moment, she doesn't seem fully resolved
There's a lot they need to do with dmjii, they just aren't important to the plot and it's the climax season where there's no real empty arcs
Maria finally gets a season long development for the first time since G
Chris doesn't get an arc this season and that's fine with me
I think she'd have the giant eyelash wings ~~that I dislike~~ that Chris has
Chris has been spiky since G
Post G symphogear has too many angles
It's good
I like it
Maybe in the movie remake where they take away s1 designs and pretend things looked like G the whole time
Where everything is rounder
I just thought it was part of the slice of life animation shift they've been doing all season
That's the edited one
10 felt like the whole thing was outsourced except it doesn't have credits that were substantially different
It could be either
I really hope it's a sign that they're conserving budget and not that they're getting time crunched
Those shuttle prep shots of panning static frames
10 was the budget save episode
9 feels like it was originally storyboarded to be 1.5 eps
More happens in 9 but 9s badly paced, I think you might have benefitted from a double feature
Maria knowing a song that name drops Lulu Amel is a hook he an Agematsu must have had for 6 years in mind
I think apple is a clue that kaneko had more in mind already by G
S1 was written without it in mind
Also movies don't have an exact predetermined length
You never see that with anime because it's way cheaper, relative to the rest of production, to shoot extra scenes in film and discard them compared to animating extra content
Aquarion Evol did it for the opening ep, which was satelight
Unless you release it on bd or something
You have to really fuck with timeslots
It's rare and expensive
Post G development for DMjii has been "they made up from a fight, they care about their abuser, one's introverted and the other likes birthdays"
Chris has at least had a chance to grow as a person to a reasonable degree
more or less
but that doesn't mean they lack the ability to block
It's what makes them not have to block
it just prevents them from using the bullshit reset mechanic
any better at actually *defeating* a god than any other attack
Gungnir isn't like
and all gears now have Amalgam which is like, the ultimate defensive move in cocoon form
by SSJ
because they get deleted
we only see them like 3 times and once it's as an attack, and another time they don't really work
that deflect energy attacks
Ichaival has reflectors
wow that was closer than I thought
extreme sigma style
can never remember the name of the wheel
also Shirabe's uh, what was it, sigma emergency style?
who was specifically copying everyone else's signature moves at the time
is Hibiki
the only other person who has been shown to do it
not Ichaivals
that's Chris' ability
no
nor does AnH
Ichaival doesn't really have anything special
x00
it even has a special serial number
Airgetlam is a special case in general
that's supposedly why Millaarc never healed her cut on her arm
It is stated that Zababa's blades have an effect on the soul
It might
because, again, her soul was erased
and she supposedly can no longer do the whole reincarnate thing
Fine reincarnating in her descendants is, currently, the only known effect of interest of being related to her
rather, Shirabe's soul was going to be destroyed but Fine offered hers up instead
Fine's soul was destroyed by Kirika's mis-aimed zesshou attack
XV keywords, even
atm
Keywords specifically call out that nobody besides Ryoko can
she's got the diamonds they get on their outfit
like that, clearly
~~her hair is in ignite form~~
anything
"these two anime faces look similar" is not really
which is disappointing
they didn't actually give her a growth arc
and Maria's somehow been put in the middle of XV yet
they spent too much effort sidelining her and reinforcing that she's "weak"
I feel like putting Maria at the center of everything is too little too late
~~I've been getting distinct hints the last 3 episodes I'm going to be underwhelmed by the ending~~
sounds as good as anything
I just have no idea what
Maria's going to accomplish something notable with hers though
something cool happening
Chris will just be
Maria's is going to be plot relevant
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I think maria will be Special
we'll probably get chris
chris, maria
who's left
I'm unwilling to say "airgetlam can't do X" about any given X right now
Maria might be the only exception here
(which, at this point in symphogear's game, you shouldn't)
if you're going to kill someone off
I feel like
the point was made, no dogpiling please
reusing punchlines rarely works in any media
when it comes to reaction images, it's really "rule of one"
~~mindwipe end~~

can you give me a quick shot at this one
since waiting for keyword translations is agony
WFC
I really hope it'll actually be ai no tame
nuke blow uppy
because
I figure they probably believed it
oh that
~~kirika tho~~
shirabe's never been okay with murdering
it should be someone with a character arc that season
I'd argue if it's a b-side and not in the anime, it's, by definition, not in your face
NR isn't inherently unredeemable - redemption is about regret and making amends
anyway fudou's probably unredeemable narratively because he's compromised family for nationalism and I feel like that's a bad mark in japanese ethics
I think pride and nationalism are not the same thing
"fuck you, got mine" is the basis of the idea
you are a nationalist in that you draw lines and deprive others of things because they are outside the lines
by definition it does
any attempt to redeem fudou at this point is a commentary on the viability and worthiness of nationalism
I mean that's part of it
if fudou gets redeemed but noble red doesn't I will be upset
~~vanessa killed noble red~~
the 70k was also to stop the gears, just in a more abstract way
"let's use noise to destroy the supports"
Elsa probably came up with stuff like
but
and a reason to yell at SONG
fudou needed tsubasa sealed
yes
lol
she's the one who planned it
but
Elsa's narratively cleaner because you didn't see her involved
70k's the only number we can work with yeah
of attendance
you're assuming 100% fatality rate
but
yeah
100k was the population capacity
where's the number where you cannot be redeemed?
For one?
you're like 24 hours early
musani <:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
I mean, it's way bigger than the most common star sizes
correct
<:miku:277254848829849600>
goes well with the science and technology theme
shirabe's songs are really great, nanjo goes for a purity of note aesthetic I really dig
She's more a callout to robots of the 70s and 80s than inspector gadget
I'm not sure sumerian myth has a devil
the episodes that have been out for 2 months
episodes 1 and 2
keep in mind XV 1 is like
no
I think the implication is that, yeah, it's the original universal tongue
It's not a real life language
I love discussing Arkham but this isn't the channel
don't get too sidetracked <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
this was just a dude
This wasn't even comic-book Ra's who comes back from the dead
and he had *no power*
Like, one of my favorite movie superhero villains I've seen was Ra's al ghul from Batman Begins
but a compelling villain he was not
like sure, he's a huge threat
he's some dude who breaks the universe because he wants to impress Death so they can fuck
Thanos in the comics is pretty much a joke
~~and that's only if you accept that Thanos works in the first place, which isn't a given~~
you need to show all the other threats up to then to have any weight
Thanos only works because he's the final boss
I'm not sure I recommend the approach for like, your first villain
because his role is to be the hidden puppetmaster
he's a terrible prime antagonist
Vandal Savage also doesn't work well without a world to manipulate
I think sometimes he has powers but they keep taking them away after the universe resets because they're really not the interesting part of him
for the most part he is just Dude With Ambition And Time
want to chime in on the vandal savage stuff - one of the reasons he works is because he *doesn't have powers* of note beyond immortality
Aoi punching the big bad in the face with a fist full of super robot plasma energy
reminds me of dancouga nova
~~prompts maybe~~
I am *probably* going to put <#357682999300718592> under the spoiler area after XV finishes
waiting's a fair strat
yeah
Spoiler tag in <#357682999300718592> I guess - I recognize it's inconvenient but I'm going to give the highest consideration to people who aren't caught up on XV until the end of the spoiler quarantine
Hm
idk, we forgot
sounds like he'd be shem ha's best friend
who knows
whether it's on screen
nah tsubasa will sing again
but it might be later than that
the coffin fight is, in theory, december 21st if we take them literally that it's midsummer
XV's concert is early feb
maybe 4
yeah I'd say about 3 months
we've seen her damn corpse
I mean, we know shem-ha can die
there's a lot it could mean but doesn't have to mean about capability
I mean, full fledged god doesn't mean omnipotent
"I liked it better when it didn't ask me to think but was just action" is kind of how I read that
the fetish of eating people or being eaten
vore fans rejoice
where domon explicitly lays out his feelings
I'd like it, but I'd prefer the part just before that
Like topdad, XV diving a little into Adam could help fix AXZ
Killing the wielders or not is less of an issue than never doing anything interesting on screen
But Ver is just meme man
Frontier helps, and Nephilim helps
Ver is the only antagonist to not flesh out the setting by existing isn't he
Ver has no possible role that's not shit
I'd appreciate Adam in a flashback tbh
Just like the shuttle missile launch in GX
Who knows, we never will because we got our season's *action bureaucracy*
Restrictions are better than seeing it every fight like gx/axz
Just reminding the viewers why it's gone
The complaint wasn't even a real complaint
So power level wise, it's shit
To this date we have no idea how good ignite is because the enemy they counter gave up
We've never actually heard how Faust robes do vs noise
As long as they dictated the engagement
Noble Red would have easily held out
G FIS wasn't shit
Noble Red could have kicked FIS' ass
Meanwhile they're fighting Elsa 'Lelouche' Wolfgirl
XV is where kaneko reveals that no one ever making intelligent decisions was a calculated weakness rather than bad writing <:KirikaDess:535188438547169280>
Not to say Adam wasn't stronger, but they'd have a shot with their best stuff against Adam
Due to ignite cancellation
For most of AXZ the alchemists were legitimately more of a threat than adam at full power, as a reminder
It's them being boring that's criminal
I can accept villains making bad decisions
Makes me want to see her in a morrigan bodysuit
You're seeing Team Concert get 1v2 styled on
<:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
Really enjoyed Millaarc this ep
open bat killed me
Millaarc going getter
also fucking
it was just fine
I've been worried for years if Symphogear's ultimate backstory plot would suck
I really loved this episode
goddamn
Especially since you want to discuss some AXZ content, <#336310266654490624> is there for you to discuss stuff from s1-4 and not be exposed to any XV discussion
if you have a problem with it, please mute and come back when you've watched it
this is the spoiler channel
<@480107127042736139> don't tell people to not spoil in here, please
you're going to get drowned out by people wanting to discuss XV11
<#336310266654490624> might be a good place to discuss old content, especially today
open bat
I'm not really all that great with subgenres but I will completely take your word for it
she basically backflipped them
It was a wrestling move
it's pretty obvious understanding is going to be the key
Shem-ha is communication and language itself
any more than Chris' parents are
I don't think we're required to get her featured in the season just because she's in the intro
I have no idea
we might get nothing
we might get her in a flashback
She's already been mentioned
Got the wrong impression of why Balal was activated
Pretty sure Fine's the victim of a miscommunication issue
she made none of the *relics*
Ryouko made all of the *symphogears*
I'm looking forward to Team Gear using Battle Fortress Luna vs Yggdrasill Earth
ah okay
or was that the a-side
it was nice
that was hibiki's b-side right
Someone out there would have done something, pretty sure
this was established in XV 1
The coffin was going to activate whether Adam told people about it or not
adam was there while they were there
yeah
there?
was
enki
enki and others were involved
she wasn't the only custodian
he resents them all
also yeah
japanese doesn't do plurals that well
because shem-ha is a custodian?
well, yeah
Millarc doing Open Get
~~cagliostro's swimsuit covers more of her than her other outfits~~
all three Illuminati ones
carol is still not in XDU, but that didn't stop them from putting the alchemists in several times
Maybe it's to represent that she's language
I don't think Vanessa was pulling out any *specific* references I recognized, but the whole sweeping beam thing is used a lot
so we got Open Bat
Getter Robo is normally made from 3 fighter jets jammed together into a robot, and can "Open Get" to seperate to dodge attacks
whose trick of splitting into parts to dodge an attack is ripped from Getter Robo
The biggest one is Millaarc
Open Bat had me fucking rolling MIllhi
Noriko Takaya
played
Noriko Hidaka
just
oh my god the gunbuster references go deeper
not miku shem-ha, but the proper custodian
who voices shem-ha
animation was so-so but at least we stepped up from 10's nadir
yeah
beautiful
cut off his arm
oh my god the gaijin in the back
Coffin was going to resurface from climate change and general tectonics iirc
he's lived for 6000 years
but it's not like it wasn't going to happen
he indirectly triggered shem-ha early
it was in Tiki or something
it's in XV 1 that they figured it out from data left behind isn't it
yeah he did
what?
he just, you know
since her coffin was coming out shortly
but Adam was afraid of Shem-ha coming back
I mean, there are other custodians
turns out symphogear reused douglas adams' plot
yeah
It's either that or just fucking Mazinger
I could see Orchis yeah
Vanessa's going to be fucking incredible ~~and probably on SONG's side~~
and Millaarc
we've had the ultimate forms of Elsa
so
I love millaarc so much she's so fun
but that's just me hoping
or maybe they'll use the moon as a battleship vs earth
I think Vanessa's giving them a ride back yeah
Phara stole it by being invisible during the beach episode
which was also the leyline map
Carol needed the photosphere they recovered from the Frontier space ruins
and Carol was because of the frontier incident
I think the "now" was because of Carol
not "now"
he plans for "sooner or later"
08 sounds more like it ye
Is the manga that new?
Like toriko
I'd say more bad early 2000s shounen
It'd need a lot of time and retakes
No one is used to drawing that kind of movement
It's fine, animation budget would have had to be obscene to deal with .16g
Aimi
What if she uses Amalgam to blow up the machine generating the curse
The computer was for terraforming
And then it'll never fire as the enemy cloaks away <:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
We'll get Chris Amalgam next episode, this giant arrangement of cannon and gun
Theory
So
She spent all episode looking horrified
Elfnein is on the bridge
XV 10 might have been an intentional cost-cut
Because every anime has production problems
Carol is going to alchemically refit it into a spacecraft
It's not going to explode
Why did you remind me it's not too late for genjuro to die
Aw
So I've been told
Phoenix together with a dragon is Chinese symbolism of marriage
Someone on another server pointed out
by the AD
but it's good work
well, that's not quite the key
wow that's a great keyframe
I'm incredibly looking forward to Ultimate Vanessa next week
I fell over laughing
It was the reference
Yes
Yuka has been killing it
I'm actually going to be sad when shemha gets her own body
The piece that broke off exposed them
Fine did aim for the ruins
Godannar did such a good job with that
Yeah I think I have to drop my hopes for a 20 minute long epilogue
but I think that chance has passed
but they had the option to feature her without dialogue
well, they wouldn't get someone else I think
there's no reason to do a flashback for Fine if they didn't get Sawashiro, so we'll see
idk though
but there's no reason to think they're done
I think this is the barest minimum amount they could get away with
There's no reason to say this is the last flashback
I'm still expecting Chris to fuck things up for everyone next ep
it took maria 50 eps to do something right but she finally did it
we'd know it was coming by now
I think at this point shem-ha is definitively female
it's not as "WHAT" anymore
like
I'm a little sad they actually undercut Fine's bullshit move
I'm sure
is the official answer
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
*so* generic
it's a little harder to really enjoy because it's
rewatching it I liked the fight more than the first watch
love them
smear frames are where the real art of animation happens
attack cards are neat but some of the seasons were using them as cheap time-fillers
fine with me
and, honestly
XV's been avoiding attack cards in general
what if this ends with maria cutting off her arm
cosmetic surgeon
I think it's significant shem-ha hasn't been fought in her faust robe until now
episodes 9 and 10 kind of indicate that there was a production *issue* but it seems to have been handled in the normal ways
I have confidence in that, at least
symphogear's never had a major production failure
luckily we've no reason to expect this
GuP
fucking
and we don't even finish the final fight
technically worse case scenario is final episode OVA
But it was very vague and poetic
There was a keyword implying there was nothing left of miku
It's almost like there is a motive in cherry picking imagery to maximize tensions
Padre superior
The girls wear skirts that split at the front tf you talking about
very likely
I mean, assuming everyone in the anime is cis which is
There's a robe, but no gear
Amalgam is combining a gear with a Faust robe
Fudou believed NR was on death row
I believe it's a tween
And then you complain there's no unique fighting styles
So you bitch about noble red
Armados wait
Her design is a little stale for me
Ok I guess
Miku shemha is great but Noriko shemha is uh
I'm not impressed with the two custodians we got though
Maybe
She's turning it back
Thus
Breaking the curse reverts everything relevant to how it was - humanity, prime to be used as a computer
Also time travel is a terrible storytelling mechanism unless it is a *time travel story*
There's two goddamn eps left
Time travel isn't an option
They tried to use the unrelated phonic gain
That's the whole point behind the s1 and g concerts
You don't have to try to turn on a relic
Maybe it's fuckin broke
If Carol's xdrive worthy phonic gain didnt turn it on
I think the chateau is a non option
plate tectonics and climate change were going to reveal the coffin
shem-ha was coming back no matter what
na
bet it can fight anyway
Next ep is the gears get pummeled ep
because of how it ended up handling the second half and ending
because it's trigger's worst show
I think spinoffs and movies are more likely to screw the series over than the last two episodes
be careful what you wish for
edgy
there's no secrets here
*airtime is bought months in advance*
...
airtime's bought months in advance
we'd know by now
~~no one expects A-1 to be good~~
so they get the credit and blame
but they signed onto the production committee
yeah
if bikki doesn't reach out to shem-ha I'm going to be disappointed
yes
yeaaaaaah
it's why comics suck/have to reboot their entire universe every 8 years
He's ending the series because you cannot tell stories about the same characters forever and have them be good stories
<:yayakaStare:292520684326748161>
they blew up the only fragment of dainslief they had
ignite's gone forever, barring an asspull
It was a good callback, it wouldn't have been a good season anchor
not even the others'
it was only Saint Germain's stone
And technicaly
Don't confuse "irrelevant" with "unimportant"
She's still important
Especially making the ghost relevant
I think reusing the ghost would have limited any future fights a lot
or even reused
I would not have liked Amalgam ghosts in general
I liked Sanjelman ghost
or something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL5g_-tEpQw
hm
Kinda, but I'm thinking more like
privately hoping she's going to combine with some external unit
I'm pretty excited to see Ultimate Vanessa
you're basically demanding they invest twice as much time as they should into a work to get slightly more value out of a few select parts
I will say though that you generally shouldn't tell someone to consume a media one way so they can enjoy the "Director's cut" the second time they read it
I mean, yeah, extended conversation there is best
that's uhhhh
probably not
so there's some in-universe doubt as to whether it actually is the relic
>>> The group's reading is "Murakumo", and 
strangely, it has the same name as the Japanese sword, Murakumo, who shattered the head of Amaha.
and the machine translation spits out this for part of it
the XV keywords talk about Fudou's sword
for the record
Judging from Durandal and Nehushtan in s1, all relics are activated with phonic gain; maybe they're also all powered up by it?
Steve Jobs implanted his soul into DNA of descendents to awaken when they hear the phrase "walled garden architecture"
It plays into the western concept of Technology As A Threat
a really common thing
Scientist becomes a god is
also kisses aren't needed for romantic confirmation
there's a lot of power in being someone's weapons broker
according to AXZ, bavarian illuminati was in order to probably finance themselves and also be in control
but that did
Most of the stuff in the season didn't really *surprise* me
I think it was my max hype point for the entire season
so good
I love the autoscorer return episode
also it has rockets
Reminder she ended up as a child subject in an American program
while the final battle isn't bad, a lot of the second cour was narratively weak because of it
yeah I had that in mind with the ungrounded comment
Escalation isn't inherently bad but it can cause the conflict to become ungrounded
you can only go up, never sideways
it's limiting, moving forward
<@506219877724454929> please don't use "triggered" like that, it depowers the word and makes it useless for people who actually have traumas/ptsd and who need to legitimately talk about their triggers
I don't know this reference
but they serve different purposes
neither is inherently wrong
which way you go determines the emotional flow of the story
it's just that having an actual dick of a villain *fulfills a role* in structuring a story that a sympathetic villain might not
and mind you, that kind of end is okay too
because both can't win (barring an ending where everyone gets along because there's just been misunderstandings the whole time)
if they're sympathetic, that means that someone good has to lose
they are the villain because they are in opposition to the protagonist
I'm talking their narrative role
villain isn't a watsonian term here
because that's just the old way of conflict, with an extra step
we're assuming you're not having some eyerolling way to dodge out of it like "THEY CAN BOTH BE RIGHT IF THEY TAKE OUT THE PUPPETMASTER"
this isn't what you want
if you don't want to tell a tragedy
and now have a tragedy
By having two sympathetic sides, you lose a heroic story
it depends what you want to do with the narrative
It both isn't and is a bad thing
Especially when the moral of the anime supports his motivation, though not his actions
the primary reason they don't tell you Master Asia's total motivation for 3/4 of the anime in G Gundam is because if we hear what he wants to do before we're trained to think of him as a villain we might very possibly be rooting for him
you run the risk of them being too sympathetic
I think one reason we don't see unconventional villain goals that often is they're difficult to nail perfectly
I mean she also accepted that not only was she working for a flawed cause, but the means were wrong too
which SG herself later rejected thanks to hibiki
SG was trying to do good, if you accept the premise that "good" can be predicated on sacrifice
*checks channel*
*peers at conversation*
They finally fixed it like 2 months ago
for *years* they had Miku in SSJ as the thumbnail image for Episode 10 of G
Crunchy gives no care about spoilers
yeah you should have no idea that Chris is a symphogear user at that point
but not because of nehushtan
Chris is, in fact, a new symphogear user
that's them being idiots
Crunchy?
who said
the Symphogear System is what Sakurai/Fine did to relic fragments to make them useable at a lower power level using an active phonic gain source
it wasn't a symphogear at all

but I think it gave her hope that maybe there was another future she could be okay with
she even still performed one last act of spite
yeah while criticism's fine, ripping on someone's work and tearing it apart for laughs and giggles isn't
oh are we talking about solo's favorite fic
But Gungnir functions as both
*in general* no
it's just a hobby
I know you think that you think you're coming off as sentimental here, Dino, but at this point the way you're talking about it is unhealthy
but you could try macross
it's a pretty expensive gimmick
I expect they'll help song for the last hurrah
with Elsa damaged like that I'm pretty comfortable saying Millaarc's been depowered
Well, I mean
they finally fucking learned
without being fucking monster of the week
we're working through the villain trio's final fights
btw I want to point out
at this point it should probably splinter off, I didn't mean to make a whole discussion out of it
note to self, never discuss anything with time travel with armados
unless a new symphogear project gets approved
XDU will probably continue for about 2 years after XV
4 laid all of the cards down ahead of time
4 wasn't an asspull
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I saw as they were just holding her while she swung it, personally, because having someone tug on your arms makes swinging a sword *harder*
9 had bizarre tonal and pacing issues it's going to take me a rewatch to really dissect
probably 9
for me it's probably 9 or 10
other than shounen cheerleading
s1 they weren't doing shit after Bikki got durandal
so yeah, you just want them in the frame
then Hibiki wouldn't have had giant fist
but your statement that they didn't need to be there was factually wrong
ok
especially in GX
hibiki needed their energy
which is fair
I guess you just at least want them all in the final shot
as I said, Symphogear's never really done a good collab finisher
just, Maria helped too
they threw their gears to Hibiki
in the way that GX did
s2 only requires them
but that's it
once it was Maria Too
it's always been Hibiki Does Things
gear's never done a decent collab finish
I think it's completely possible they'll make Hibiki solo shemha at the end just like Carol and Adam, but maybe they've learned their lesson
this isn't that kind of show, cypher
Also coldly condemning Noble Red and leaving them to rot and suffer uh
Vanessa gattais with the moon and uses it as a battlestation
symphogear already struggles with that, since it's made the commitment to tell the stories of the other girls as well (something they thankfully dropped the intensity on in XV when they let Chris and DMJii support without having arcs)
also, it would have made the narrative more heavily hibiki
they can't add extra on
the staff know exactly how much time they have to spend
but it's extra time on something minor and remember
it's interesting
sure
to grapple with something like that we'd have to be spending a lot of time at school and after s1, Symphogear only covers school when it *has* to
it's not relevant
because while it's interesting
idk, I think there's probably a story there about Hibiki dealing with rumors about her we were never told about
1/3rd is from the class rotation alone, and then you have everyone who moved/died
but with GX you have a school that is *mostly* new people
the uniforms alone are proof they didn't
but a bunch of students probably died and I'm sure they onboarded a bunch more
as school is an institution, not a location
it's still the same school
just a new location and building
it's still lydian
it was a good 2 dozen people in there who saw her, most of which had lydian uniforms
but
I'm pretty sure most people in the school did not know at the end of s1 for the record
it's irrelevant to the story they wanted to tell
it just means it's not part of the narrative
Media deciding to not cover a plot arc doesn't mean it doesn't happen
it's just not a story the anime felt like telling
I think maybe they did
you do have too many characters to easily have them all be jumping in to do something, unless it's one, repeated identical action. You could have *some* of them do something pretty easily, but you'd piss a lot of people off with every character left out
I mean it is 5 sub protags, we're working with the observable fact that Hibiki's set up with the main character arcs
sure, but hear me out
I think the one line each is a syndrome of having 5 sub protagonists
*I get it*, Hibiki is the fulcrum of the show
which I mean
they're both "passively support hibiki while she does the work"
to me the only difference between this and GX is that they're in the frame
Symphogear
G
GX
AXZ
All the previous episode 12 titles were the season
I feel like if I had any remaining doubts that this was the last season, the title of episode 12 dispelled it
initially I thought they built the whole moon but it's possible they just built a city on/under it
unclear
well
yes.
36 kars on mars
Confusing <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I mean you're demanding a lot
What price will you pay if it does
Even the weakest season of Symphogear has had a bombastic ending
oh whoops there's a different shot with 7 meteors
miku's also in the meteors too
symbolic
that's uh
the girls are already running dry on character arcs
I really don't want a whole new season
I guess
therefore, virus
shem-ha is language
vanessa is robot
Basa's bodysuit is the best of the amaglam designs though
too few details
ignite got worse looking the longer it was on screen
ignite was worse
disagree
so
the ep 12 screenshot was of Carol
about an hour and a half ago
<:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
turns out kimi dake ni is just a cd-only b-side
maria doomed us all
it was maria
it wasn't ver
Carol's plan was that it *might* work
chateau is almost certainly fucking broken
if befriending her upsets you you might be watching the wrong anime
says who
maybe
kiri's scythe
too much to do to spend 7 minutes on a fight that doesn't matter because she's scheduled to lose it
it's not the focus of the ep
carol's fight was mostly underwhelming for time reasons
she was singing enough to activate x-drive
it's fucking broken
Carol's song didn't activate it
kiseki means miracle btw
I thought you were going to miss it
is CR's subs not translating the last line of dialogue a "translation fail"? Are you beholden to someone else's god-awful translation work in order to make the tie clearer?
I've been a bit torn up
okay speaking of tl notes
aka murder everyone
there's a pretty heavyhanded hint in XV 12 that millaarc regretted what she did/had to do because she was "weak"
probably yggdrasill
none of the little nods or winks have been vitally important
for people who are up to speed on side materials, it'll make a lasting impression
they'll blink, go "what?" and then forget it existed 30 seconds later
for people who don't know the things
it's good
this is the fanservice season
like Chris' buddhist shrine
there's been a bunch of stuff in XV that's only been acknowledged in side materials
I mean
NR avoided every pitfall the alchemists had
much better than the alchemists from AXZ
I thought NR was great
yeah AXZ discussion's still around in the cobweb section
if hibiki goes ssj god or ssj blue gungnir actually deletes her from causality
it stopped the moon
apple didn't stop nephilim
but just came from miku's DNA
it's possible that shem-ha didn't even come from the bracelet
after all, since Miku is free from the curse of balal
beyond divine power
I don't think we have any records about what the bracelet actually holds
I no longer think it's likely we're headed towards an end that breaks all the relics
the gundam ones I remember most were the Dom and Zeong references in the highway fight
I'll have to make room to download XV again though
I don't know them all but I'll try if I'm reminded to do it
yeah it took me a while because it reminded me of a few things at once in distant ways
from Gundam 0083 Stardust Memories, the Mobile Armor Neue Ziel
Vanessa's ultimate form reference, for the record
missing the point entirely there
or at least, a knowable human antagonist
because there's not really a human antagonist
prequel spinoff is pretty bad as a premise unless they tie it into a s1 recap
I think if a movie was going to be the series conclusion, noble red would have been the entirety of this season, and Shem-ha would be introduced at the end
I don't think Kaneko would sabotage the seasonal pacing just for a movie
I typically don't get hugely invested into side projects but it'd be nice
Miku will come to a resolution that will at least momentarily thwart Shem Ha, yes
A buffer is still a combatant
She meant in a "not on the front lines" way
She didn't mean in a pacifist way
And if she was given a gear it'd ruin that sentiment
A lot of people really didn't want Miku to get a gear this season because Miku's self proclaimed role is to be someone who can support without fighting
Only they they're related to the original fine
<@269296221766680578> it doesn't matter who is descended from shirabe
Because that's what s1 and xv do
None of the problems can really be resolved
The problem with a prequel movie is a complete lack of catharsis
But what if between the decision to give her a 2 minute backstory and something to lean into in the future one day, they chose the latter
I mean I'm not suggesting that kirika had hers deliberately withheld
What if Kirika has no backstory as a keystone to leverage a potential gen 2 anime
Wild idea
Hey
She was also mostly relic at the time
SOMA would be an example of the concept applied to *intentional* horror
Much better than spooky asleep old gods
Bringing up that your existence might be manufactured, irrelevant, and bent to someone else's whim?
No
As a whole?
Matrix is better existential horror than Lovecraft
He settles for xenophobia and generic fear of the unknown
Lovecraft stops short of existential horror
Sometimes it feels like nasu ruined metaphysical fiction the way Lovecraft ruined horror
gals üëè being üëè pals
they are filled with the light god could not know, I imagine
they were already in amalgam when they popped off
because this is amalgam x-drive
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I'll take your word for it but I never noticed once in 4 watches
and Chris has baggage
Only Chris was crying
all *that* says is that the show recognized Fine is a character more complex than clearly evil villain 100% of the time
is not the same
showing her in a momentary sympathetic light
especially since I don't think the show did forgive her for it
I mean you can consider redeemed as that but that's not useful from a literary discussion point of view
and lose her life for it
possibly because Fine realized Hibiki was going to stop the fragment
Hibiki changed Fine's mind at the end
redemption is the act of making up for your actions
that's connection and understanding
that's not redemption
G did
s1 didn't redeem Fine
her only redemption act in GX was to give her body to elfnein
carol was spiteful to the very end
ver reversed it against carol's wishes
carol did not reverse her mass genocide
went through a redemption arc
ever
especially since Maria never
personally I find it kind of gross that numbers/methods make people "irredeemable" or not
<:MariaSunglasses:611251941988892682>
oh, right, because if you only murder 4 people through unrighteous reasons, they give you a symphogear and make you a main character
I'm just trying to follow your thought process here
what would lowering the kill count do for the show
rather than desperation
*evil* implies darkness of the heart to me though
yeah
is it bad and wrong and injust
requires the victim to be emotionally compromised at the time
which, as we saw later
she did it because noble red was not strong enough to deal with the gears straight on and they needed the stained gaze trump card
which is what I would consider *evil*
she didn't do it because she wanted to
I mean
more just "morally compromised"
with the latest episode I'm unsure millaarc falls firmly in the "evil" category
forgive, yes, redeem, no
again, you *really* want to use the word redeem for what it's not
any time Shirabe is not Fine it's part of her redemption arc
that retroactively makes most of G her arc by her *decision* to not take over Shirabe when she could have lol
when Fine says she didn't want to reappear
though actually you did bring up an interesting point
but it qualifies while the former doesn't - it's like giving someone a coupon for a half-off pizza to make up for totalling their car
I mean, I agree it's a very abrupt scene
but *they have not had a redemption arc* until they *act* on it
a character can want to do good
again
not the mindset
**the action is important**
but in the second one she kills herself to save someone
right, sure
it's *textbook* redemption
because she's performing a significant action to make up for her past actions
and it's seperate from reunification with an enemy
a redemption arc is an established literary concept
forgiveness is a seperate concept
Hibiki's willing to be friends with mass murderers *before* they're redeemed, why would a scene of them being friends be a sign of redemption
**this is not redemption**
the show treats it as a sympathy "we can be friends now" note
I disagree
that's just a nice gesture
that's not an action of redemption
but you're still not redeemed *until you make up for it*
you can feel sad you're evil
*redemption requires action*
I can't have this conversation if you're going to keep making up the definition of redeemed
like
ok
yes
The show's working on an emotional note of regret and failure to connect
She's not redeemed
it didn't
and never regret what they do
who are never redeemed
it's completely possible to have emotional moments, sympathetic moments, with villains
But
A redeemed character is one who has basically joined the good side, who has performed actions to "make up" for their past ones
while a true statement I'm not sure the relevance
that's not redemption
Anyway, yes, they portrayed Fine as a tragic character
I think kaneko/agematsu must just really have some sense of justice where the characters still have to die for what they did
idk maybe they thought their corpses burning up would have been too much ü§î
so weak it undermined some of XV when they tried to do the same thing, but competently this time
narratively
AXZ was a realllllly weak season
yeah
noble red zero-shifted their butts to earth
we jehuty now
you watched space tunnel
shem-ha won't be in miku's body very long
they need identity that's more than "the other's girlfriend"
yeah
but I feel most everyone else has run their course
I wouldn't mind DMJii showing up in a sequel because of how little the show utilized

at all
suteinu does not seem to be a common name
and Hibiki's had like 4 trios
I feel like DMJii need a quadruple circle
as Illindus mentioned, please don't use the r-word on this server
the military junta in AXZ did have those little canes that seemed to control them
oh
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
because that's most of the media he's consumed
nothing about how they internally think or are programmed
the only real talk we ever got was "they're made to dissect things"
no
it's a pretty common narrative threshold
actually dino has a small point here - from the point of view of justifying heroes murdering them
they don't follow orders without the cane and just work on internal programing/"instinct"
I don't think we're ever really informed how capable they are autonomously, but it doesn't seem to be very
so you cannot kill them
that noise aren't even alive
there's a case to be made
I mean
or etc
or youkai
yeah killing wild hostile animals typically doesn't
to kill even a villain would make them less pure
I think it has something to do with a concept of pureness of heart or something
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
even when it seems like maybe they did
the heroes don't kill in these shows
but the bottom line is their hands are clean and they didn't kill
yeah, and it was a tonal "what"
I mean nobody stays dead anyway so it hardly counts
the plot will bend over backwards to off villains that need offing without their direct intervention
for pretty much any reason
heroes aren't supposed to kill
I get the feeling that they haven't really seen many magical girl shows though because like
I've seen some that don't seem to be satisfied of any ending for her short of Tsubasa doing an execution move on her without remorse
believe me, some still hate her
or maybe it was at the jeweler's getting cleaned
for that shot
over it
she put a glove on
With limited edit access
There's been some plans for a year or two to make a more accurate, walled garden kind of Symphogear wiki
<@354402389282783235> features a lot of little details that are unsourced
Rampant nationalists are real and are eager to put others in harm's way, wouldn't surprise me if Fudou has support irl
but there's a limit to how much crap you can pile onto one character's plate and not ruin their focus
or you have a stale, dead series
slice of life still needs character growth
another problem is overdevelopment
at that point you should probably just make a different cast who have facets that would more appropriately be explored through slice of life
yeah, I don't think I'd really appreciate it
just running into the girls doing fucking nothing for 2 cour, when they've been defined by their life or death struggles until now?
cool, good
a tiny bit for shinais so we can see what they do on their time off?
like
I really don't want slice of life symphogear tbh
yeah it's not even a b-side
like there's all the jokes that miku and hibiki are dating but the anime's *consistently* been hinting since s1 that Miku's trying to be honest with herself and admit her feelings
that was sung under mind control
outside of the song
The show heavily implies that Miku still has never actually told Hibiki she's in love with her
Miku's the one with the inner tension to confess
it's Miku kissing Hibiki that's had the directional tension
Also Hibiki kissing MIku is not what the show's been setting up for 5 seasons
By grammar do you mean full use of punctuation etc
I saw some discussion that people thought Hibiki is going to kiss Miku out of it and I'm almost certain that's not going to happen because it's a terrible use of a kiss - and it involves kissing shemha
but yeah it's not a very bold prediction
I don't know if she'll force her out or just stun her
but that feels like a freebie guess to me
I think I predicted that Miku's going to mentally come to a resolution that will throw Shem-Ha for a loop at a significant moment
I have no idea
XV's finally learned to relax the rules
everything is too goddamn stiff and angled
G-AXZ had kinda poor animation for more relaxed and casual stuff
actually that's a good point
modern, heavy duty drills don't really prompt one to ask about edges, though
if you're thinking of the standard anime/comic spiral drill, that's usually 1-3 edges/flanges
it depends what kind of drill
you have to rename the file to start with SPOILER_
it's all good/great, rarely A+
Nothing in XV really has blown me out of the water other than Carol's song and *maybe* Maria's, but honestly that's true for most of the music after G
I also really like Shirabe's
AXZ was soooooo focused on selling music
Or any other of the duets/trios
Maria in particular has busted out her best A-side since G
we're actually allowed to hear people's A-sides more than fucking once
but part of that is
I'm into them more than most of AXZ's
depends
Please avoid using that abbreviation
They rejected the storyboards
It was never made
Or cut
Anyway the original "too lewd" transformation wasn't lost
You mean the stand powers that are already lost?
we got the alchemist heart and everything
I heard it was cut 10 seconds and we did get a slightly extended transformation the second time she transformed
every other season was either flugel or a hextet or both
it'd be a severe break from symphogear tradition
you were right about what
OP and ED CDs are designed to be sold without real relevance to the anime, usually
it being in the ED CD doesn't really mean a lot
because CDs have b-sides
that's ayahi solo, right?
the credits song will not be if the world had a song
but it's possible we'll get no epilogue
ideally third/third/epilogue
not pointless
it'll be the excuse she has to have a body to fight them after they save miku
you can be 19 and a top scientist
Counterpoint: it's anime
we do not know how old she is
the context of the word use is way more relevant than the fact you called it weird
it's less that the word is offensive and more that judging them to be weird because their culture is misaligned differently than yours smacks of moral superiority
oh, I see
most of what I'm saying is not aimed at you
I'm not sure what you're talking about here
circling the conversation around to the source, Japan's cultural trends on stuff like limited PDA showing is something to be observed and cognizant of, but not so much judged
A lot of people think that words are harmless and you shouldn't feel bad for hearing them, but that's a really simplistic way of looking at it
you're free to respond to things as you wish and that can be a fairly healthy response but server stance is that words and ideas can be harmful, and having some non-nuanced ideas about an entire group of people and thinking they're "weird"[phrased in a distantly superior way] because the culture is textured is harmful
yeah they do
and how they're "timid"
particularly with how they "worship lolis and boobs"
I'm pretty uncomfortable at the orientalism being thrown around here
we'll probably get handholding and smiling at each other
Japan has a thing about PDA
even in romance anime
Kisses are uncommon
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
maybe I'm wrong
do I just have a terrible ear? I swear the song when she came after fudou was completely different
why does everyone forget that tsubasa sung her b-side this season
there isn't much time for a nuanced fight dynamic
Armados the fights are like 4 minutes long
germain's soul being left behind in her spellcaster made a tiny bit of sense but I wish they had shown her like fading away or something
*different connotation*
<@!476058996315389953> You could maybe read the season 5 tension about that, but season 1 Miku staring at a book on how to be honest with yourself, and then seeing Hibiki with Tsubasa and being angry and jealous
we've had a like 5 season long subtextual plot about Miku trying to get herself to confess to Hibiki
and yet
because obviously they're together
It's weird
See
*but it's a starting point*
that's not all of it
okay if you don't know where you possibly could have been offensive in what you said, reread the words "bouncing gigantic boobs and lolis are things they worship"
anyway
I can't comment on that because I don't watch long-form shounens
It's basically an extrapolation of Chekov's gun
an unfinished story arc is a waste of viewer's time
over and over
disappointing to the reader
and it's just
characters die *in the middle* of their character arc and there's no catharsis or resolution
it's that without plot armor
Armados the problem isn't switching characters
enormous fun
noble red were really enjoyable to have around and I was really happy the way XV used them most of the season
that said
it's kind of a necessity for conflict-based storytelling
a plot
in fact
almost all villains are plot devices so that there is
solo it's a pretty weak take
but XV's tearing through so much plot I don't mind as much
and AXZ
it was *really annoying* in GX
like
if Symphogear wasn't treading so much ground this season I'd be more annoyed
People are, actually, in fact moved and changed through a combination of words and actions
but she was willing to
she just didn't end up killing herself
in XV 12
I mean carol did have a self-sacrifice moment
stop trying to backseat moderate, especially when you're making up issues
please
there is no flaming
please stop trying to derail the conversation with batman vs superman
Death is the least interesting permanent consequence you can give to a character
plot armor's easy to deal with if you want a gritty story - you don't need to kill characters to remove the illusion of invulnerability
at most Carol's going to delete herself and Elfnein gets mild-moderate amnesia
12 is the "Everything goes wrong" episode
the chance of anyone major dying is zero
now that we're past episode 12
I feel like 80% of the time you write "who agrees, X" the response is "not really anyone"
to use as a disguise
Fine did preserve Ryoko's mannerisms and ego
I would imagine all of Fine's hosts affect her in one way or another but that's really just logical extension of the current situation rather than something supported by the show
Ryoko influenced Fine
but the fact that Fine has purple eyes at the end has significance
<@480107127042736139> you're right that Ryoko's mostly overwritten by Fine
but yeah
<:yayakaStare:292520684326748161>
The entire fucking point of Madoka is that hope is the most important thing in the world
not gold eyes
Fine has purple eyes when she tells Hibiki to believe in the song of her heart
that's why you see it a lot
and portraying that on screen gives viewers hope
The poster shows the major tension of the series
Anyway
lmao
wasn't s1's poster of Tsubasa and Kanade
what does this have to do with a poster.
Miku is *incredibly* important because **the entire focus of the story is on her and Shem-ha**
**a character's status as a plot point or not doesn't make them not important, it means the exact opposite**
then let me respond to your point
at this point you seem to be trolling, looking for responses
Dino you've brought this asinine point up about 5 times today and have seemed disappointed every time when people haven't responded to you
*the entire second half of the show is about saving Miku*
the two most important characters this season of the main cast
it's just hibiki and miku standing there
how the heck is it misleading
but not a ton
there've been a few
hm I'm trying to think of actual deus ex machina's the show's pulled
doesn't have to be a prior episode
and earlier can be "earlier that episode"
you can have a solution that's not a deus ex machina if it's set up earlier
there's a few ways I can see them resolving this and a few I probably can't because it involves revelations we haven't had yet
well
bringing in marduk is cool at least
is ok
I was a little disappointed by SSJ returning but
I think finishing Earth's story is a fine way to go
ones that don't involve the main 6
They *might* be saving stories about other annunaki for potential spinoffs
it's not aliens at all
the twist ended up being
alien invasion was what s1 was about
especially since XV's revealed Miku's bottled up the blame this *entire* time
but we already have the b-side primed and waiting
I mean she doesn't have to
oh that would be a good scene
and not vice versa
the only problem I have with it centering on hibiki confessing is the show's put a lot of emphasis on Miku deliberating over having `the conversation` with her girl
and vice versa, barring waikyo shenshoujing
it doesn't make that relationship any less central to the plot
XV is trying to wrap up about 7 plot threads with 13 episodes, I'm okay with them not doing extensive development of a relationship we already have a pretty good grasp on
it makes it difficult to take anything you say seriously
you need to work on this exaggeration habit of yours
it just happens to be between hibiki and miku
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
carol will be in XDU after playable shem-ha SSJ Amalgam X-drive
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
so
Fine did have basically x-drive nehushtan in XDU
though
x-drives are a symphogear thing
so probably him/her
I mean I can't think of a character in fiction who the plot bends over backwards more to make the best, always, than The Doctor
bonus basa tum on the same page
which was posted by satelight on their storefront to sell the AXZ artbook
I assume you mean this
because they were already revealed
confused what can be leaked
I mean I'm just
they first show up in AXZ 13
looking at the dates
I don't think it was leaked until after they appeared on screen
it's from AXZ
anyway yeah
Azoosugia
cool
yeah they do use it
oh I've found the material
I think zoid uses it but zoid's pretty far out from being central to the fandom these days
I have no idea what an azoth gear is because it's not really a fandom term
they can now be used for another purpose
dunno about perfected
adjusted
dainsleif somehow got added to the gears without much changing how they look
or something
unless there's spacial compression involved
maybe
it's not clear how much of a fragment you need to make a symphogear
the first XV content will probably be amalgam
and then, the last gatcha before the game shuts down, superrelic durdabla carol
durdabla carol
another 2 years
gremlin with hat carol
2 years later
and then
yeah
oh
we'll also probably get Noble Red Swimsuits
maybe not fudou
well
agree to the rest
they're basically GX's
I don't know if we'll get the ep 8 x-drives
while not ethically defensible, when you're weak and backed into a position of powerlessness, it's easy to be attracted to less kosher methods
disagree to the first one
I totally missed that because I forget how broadcasting works
oh
it is a super good emote
I'm more of a komm susser todd person but sure
even the thumbnail's fine
Crunchy's able to title a video without spoilers
amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_zP2bp9Ru4
because carolxneinryu is not their normal username
I think solo was asking what the "ultimate sin" is
it doesn't have major pacing, character, or tonal issues
it's just
ps I don't consider the "best executed shounen" to be particularly deep or amazing
the best executed shounen I've ever seen was a videogame adaptation
and manga adaptations amplify all their problems of shounen because it's the nature of the media to meander and pile on top of itself because the author comes up with more ideas later
shounens can exist and be good, the problem is they're generally manga adaptations
sentinels was original animation
let's cut 88 off
well
star blazers ran from 79 to 84, voltron was 83-85, and robotech was 85-88
90s started to move forward
80s had the mashups
there's a few
robotech, star blazers, voltron
anime in america syndication was not very respectful to the source material
if symphogear had run 30 years earlier it would have been mashed up with 1-2 other shows, the plot rewritten, and named something else
<@189146272865845248> if it's appropriate they totally would
Might not be too hard
Sawashiro is probably on contract for xdu
Also
They might, if sawashiro did something in xv13
We see it in an identical desert landscape
Iirc
We're shown it again when Vanessa talks about it
I think it's just a reference to airgetlam being found in iraq
I always thought that was weak
Nothing costs too much to animate for an OP
I like that Hibiki got a red scarf, good classic kamen rider nod - unless it's a getter nod
which is where every season's tagline is from
might be a reference to Gyakko no Flugel
bizarre
it's not satelight's only cash cow, so they're not guaranteed to focus on it
consider the franchise on indefinite hiatus until the live
we won't get news about it for at least a year or two
it's pointless to think about it for now
yes it might get a spinoff
you're going over points that have been discussed like 30 times by now, so forgive me for not really going into it in depth
if the live stream used MBS it might not be for another week
hey, nice recap
it's a pretty old slang word
pussyfooting comes from the connotations of walking like a cat
They've been saying "Final season" in a lot of promotional material
I could see them not taking the risk
Symphogear has a very high chance of not selling well if they get a new cast
whether that means the end of the franchise or not is dubious but it means you shouldn't be counting on it
I think it really is the final planned season of Gear and they won't be jumping into any new projects immediately
<:cagmurder:580135748788027393>
the raws come out in like an hour or so
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
oh is there another subbed outlet in another country
crunchyroll releases their copy in 2 hours 48 minutes
dino it doesn't matter where you live
...
3
Even a full adaptation is still frequently worse from a storytelling perspective due to how mangas are composed and written
manga's pretty far down the list
anime original series is the second best
anime movie is the best way to tell your story
somewhat
The manga isn't the anime and isn't really fully a companion piece to it
Serena, however, was never a character
we saw extensive further development of her in flashbacks
I'd argue Kanade was meant to be a character
they mentioned some sort of major ecological disaster
but there might be another similar disaster
time frame's completely wrong
Maria and Serena don't come from chernobyl
that was just someone being artsy
there wasn't anything left in the "plausible deniability" category
nnnnnno
cultural differences
that was hibiki and miku being out
there was no closet ending
what closet ending
but connecting to all of humanity transcends time
got the impression everyone there was dead dead
I uh
~~douzle mille~~
for people who followed the background stuff of the show
fanservice
I don't think it could have been cooler with the time they had
but they're not confirmed yet
We'll probably get zesshoushinais
Kanade was too powerful to let live
so the seven harmony thing confirmed something
sadly
Kirika's been mostly comic relief since GX
I'd expect a live
~~We're not even sure we're getting a live yet~~
all sung by Nana Mizuki, the show's biggest VA
they're always set to the OP, except for GX which had Glorious Break
yeah
<@270093671779663873> every finishing attack in every season happens to a song sung by tsubasa's VA, not hibiki's
of the whole episode
got me the most
Carol and Elfnein's conversation
HIBIMIKU FULLY CANON
LILY
you mean the new ed
OH
Lasting Song, cypher
It got thrown into Solomon's Vault
where they give us more content in the bluray version of the episode
I wonder if we'll get a BD Epilogue
Hm
writing wise
bring them back if needed
so they can uh
I think the fate of the gears are left intentionally ambiguous
rather, Elfnein built some of it and then Carol's personality built the rest of herself
it's how she came back
out of her memories
Elfnein built carol's personality
Carol activated her faust robe by stringing the harp
<@183270924701794305> Carol's gone, Elfnein's capabilities are unknown, and SSJ wasn't a symphogear
<@155150213445582850> Madoka was big enough in the west it had international theater showings
<:garebear:580116081595645975>
what, is it going to explode *after* the finale season?
for XDU
Symphogear won't get big enough
they're canonically lesbian
derp
there's no way to deny their feelings at this point
When they don't let them confess, usually it's to preserve plausible deniability
<@272035441312530434> it's not
I actually would have hated a confession without a reaction more
I thought it was fine
Considering the time crunch
Fine was stated to be a high priestess - which implies she's a human who talks to the custodians
Fine was a human
but the *fanbase* was shown to have existed
I mean, years prior
but Millhi's point is interesting
They left it open to be artsy, not to pretend they're not gay
whether Madoka likes Homura or not's never tackled
Homura's feelings are unambiguous but
Madoka definitely has it
there's *no other conversation* they could be having
that's what I'm saying
there's none here
yeah
they do not have to fuck on screen to be canonically lesbian
YTT doesn't even have ep 12 out yet
good carol
catharsis, maybe? Relaxation from the resolvement of tension, rather than the absense of it?
I don't think they said that
which is the only thing that she wanted to become like a god for
Yeah, basically, the vibe I got from Shem-Ha was that humanity was now powerful enough to find their own future
we got humanity's collective apotheosis
instead of hibiki becoming god
Did I mention this is the first time they managed to make "Bikki solos the boss" work
that's kind of risky
masterplan did operate on the theory that god could stay contained by a computer
I'm puzzled as to why
you can say it
they did a good job of moving the plot
sympathetic or not
they carried a lot of XV's quality on their shoulders
NR were excellent
maybe
fuck if I know which one
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Hero_Series
metal hero
<@279341087494242304> you like to ask about references
I'm going to hold my thoughts on the conclusion until BD 6 comes out
So that just leaves 4 major cast members who didn't
I'd agree
ah, true
no one else did, though
Elfnein did
well
no one else did
Hibiki and Miku got a resolution
I have the most problems and rants about GX, but I think it had more spirit than some other seasons
XV's definitely in the top 3
see, this is why I say you exaggerate a lot
no
yeah, we got the confession
once again, the day is saved
thanks to

<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
DMJii never got an arc to finish
or scared, even
GX and S1 both had concerts with no one hurt
Even romance anime
Because kisses aren't common in anime
They don't need to fuck on screen to have a relationship
<@302063351767498752> they did show plenty gay
This is not ambiguous
Nanofate was ambiguously friendship
No
I think they're attempting to convey innocence by keeping the confessions private
I think it's more than that
**they held hands naked in front of God and talked about their feelings for each other**
You're just not accepting what they *did* give you as confirmation
They didn't leave it up to imagination though
If "friendship" works for you I hope you marry whatever friend makes you feel that way
The key feature of plausible deniability is that there has to be a plausible alternative explaination
There's lines earlier in the episode that makes hibimiku's feelings for each other pretty explicit and the episode ends with them both about to confess what they feel is the same thing, finishing with them staring up at a pair of shooting stars falling together
Krika I'm on break but is there a part you felt *was* ambiguous
That sounds like a promise lily
~~and time crunch~~
We didn't get the confessions because of an artistic desire to preserve their innocence and privacy rather than deniability
It's pretty explicit
<:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
S1
I thought it was good if rushed
Was *so good*
The line about saying her feelings counted for as much as shemha's 2000 years
Yay
Oh are they on there now
<@388516680742993933> we probably have zesshoushinais and a live (neither announced yet)
I feel like we're going to get a few decent BD upgrades
Yeah
Adultverse
6-8 xdu stories that aren't bland?
There's like what
Especially with the new color wheel <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Xdu isnt
Azur Lane is a good game though
She acknowledged their strength and let them create their own
Shem Ha believed that strength determined who could create a future
They need touchup
All the xdu stories have too much of a pattern of fighting pointlessly every 5 minutes
Nobody present has any reason to have even grudging respect for him
I'm mildly annoyed
I'd love to have Vers that weren't shit, animate then please
Serena has a character?
Still the best moment


<:ElfneinNeedsAnAdult:611251975807434767>
CRYING INTO THE MIC
HER VOICE ACTING
that elfnein scene
god
~~she's to be shipped with the otaku~~
they run off memories and she doesn't seem to be the kind to be okay to harvest them
she has nothing to power them with
the camera just cut away before they did
they did confess
can confess
they
yeah, you get my point
the west loves gory violence but freaks out at nipples, inconsistency is common
by a lot of cultural values it would have been uncomfortably imposing on them
they just cut the viewer away to give them privacy
their moment happened
they didn't cockblock their moment
Hibiki would be using karate chops instead of punches
it's all meaningless
XV was being botted upwards on MAL anyway
she also made some for FIS as a backup plot for something something something, I lose track of that plot thread a lot
so she could use the money division 2 got to build kadingir
in s1 she made symphogears as a toy that could fight noise so that division 2 had a weapon and so that division 2 got money
fine made 2 gungnirs, clearly she didn't give a shit
she really was too powerful
the 7 point harmony thing reveals why kanade had to die
I mean yeah
GX and AXZ's halfassed "aw she's blushing" bait didn't cut it for me
yeah XV finally brought me on board the Mariabasa ship
it's just a big departure
that's legit
very growly
agree that I don't really think metanoia fits great
I didn't expect it to be so *undeniable*
I expected it
should probably actually do it someday
forever
lagrange has been on my list for like
because I enjoy being right
I settle for the easy calls
I'm still working on my post GX elfnein grief fic
I predicted gyakko no flugel ending song
"get into XDU right now as it's about to go bad"
the white made Airgetlam in particular look kinda... bad
glad XV finally added black
like "HEY THESE ARE GOOD GUYS"
the invasion of white into the gears up through AXZ is kind of obnoxious
though the aesthetic designs degraded over time
the mechanical design for the gears did improve though
I prefer the older character designs
it just needs more shading
I actually think s1's art style is better than G and onward
tsubasa's dreams are pretty obvious
well, one of two
she's the one character we actually have dreams for
just like her parents
Chris would be a philanthropist artist
what if Kirika was the songwriter for an idol group and Shirabe was the choreographer

not how far
you said future
music teacher?
Kirika is a, hm
Mariabasa are idols, obviously
~~dmjii because they don't use protection, oops~~
it's the symbolism
they can wait a few years
angry ones
if you marry them and dmjii don't catch the bouquet there will be words
hibiki saved miku through hugs twice now
have we brought up that
imagine being so gay god corners you naked to ask you a question and you bring up how gay you are and hold your wife's hand
is it really open if there's only one possible interpretation
'open'
(I didn't even fucking notice she was doing this insane shit until I rewatched 13)
she used heaven's wraths in a thousand tears attack
we got an upgraded heaven's wrath
and half of them are like, amalgam ones
we've got a bare handful of new attack cards
it's odd
they've named almost nothing this season
I still suspect the legs are a zz reference
you get topdad in GX
if you try to go through with something when the viewer's thoughts don't line up with the action
whether someone is redeemed depends on the viewer, not the action
and they only killed 70k
I've been watching people want noble red's blood and nothing would redeem them
that was probably their thought process
I'm pretty sure at the end of the day you just can't let someone who attempted genocide of the human race just hang out
and values Elfnein's love for her above her own life
where carol shows that she loves Elfnein
I ultimately think I prefer this way
he really loves flirting with it
no, but urobuchi has a nihilistic streak
deconstruction's a bit of an empty term
just as long as you take a break between 2 and 3
yeah that's fine too
before rebellion recontextualizes it
TV deserves to be considered on its own merits
take a week off between finishing the TV series and watching Rebellion
but if you want a tip
go for it
it's kinda like the best batman or captain marvel stories, about the keeper of the light in a world of darkness
yes
madoka was still an anime about hope, it's the later copycats that really got grim
tsubasa was a pretty needy 15 year old and I could see Kanade at 17 not really... you know, being into her
I've actually seen a good argument that while tsubasa had the hots for kanade, kanade was just a mentor/older sibling type
I feel like an open end is only something you can call it if you can come up with plausible alternatives to them confessing their love
I think some would need on-screen sex to feel like it was "official" at this point
nah
it's canon
Miku's her light
edgebikki is the only gear user in her AU isn't she
this happens a lot
with a ~~gear~~ artificial relic thing
he fights
no
ogawa's that AU too right
and ogawa
dur da bla requires playing notes on the harp
it would sure make sense to put it in england when you're putting the tickets in bds only sold in japan
so I'll take that as a pretty reliable soft confirm
I doubt she'd say that unless she was contracted to do a live
hmmmmmmm
but I think a livestream happened recently??
I haven't seen it
seems like a questionable use of focus
especially when they could be animating more epilogue content instead
I wouldn't hold my breath
that we'd get a new transformation for BD?
I might just be weird
one of the draws of my favorite mecha shows is they show the same high effort animation like 40 times in the show
again, though
I'm not sure I'd actually... want it to be different?
but I'm a sucker for stock footage
Mm, if her non-shem ha robe looked substantially different I'd want one
screaming "I love you" at each other through their gears
technically they confessed in G
They might have just been like "we're dating right? yeah we're dating" some point after G
a sign of them being fully united now?
Cutting Edge x2 has a *lot* more of DMJii singing the same line at the same time than past duets
and I realized
so I was going through the released album version snippets released on the youtube channel
and sforzando is january, along with Cutting Edge x2
looks like december
I just want hanasaki yuuki
we only get resolutions for tsubasa and hibiki
they should show the other 4 girls doing something
If they want to pretend they have 6 main characters
Hm
you get footage instead of black
<@204501539308568577> you know the black scrolling credits at the end of the symphogear seasons
There was added content in GX
I can't remember the last time you said anything about anything that wasn't some form of "this is bad and I don't like this"
<@239893407122718721> figure out a way to "be realistic" that isn't just "always be raining on people's parades" or leave please
interesting that crunchy didn't pick up the BDs for it
did you see the really bad walk cycle
Crunchy only obtained Symphogear when GX was starting up iirc
no one'd pick up the series otherwise
thank god it does for s1
for S1 and G
it does
so yeah, maybe it's because she's 'passive'
but basically Fine's holding back, intentionally *not* possessing Shirabe even though she's awakened
but a different one
I don't think she does in *that* scene
yeah, basically
because Fine actually has a few lines here and there where Shirabe seems to know too much
that was Fine talking to Genjuro through Shirabe
yes
THAT
OH
"being spoiled" is another way to talk about someone treating you nicer than you deserve
And Shirabe was, I *think* being grateful she could help instead of left to rot in the brig
yeah, I got that
I don't remember the scene in question kuro but it's probably related to gen being Team Dad
Maria getting ready for a concert
DMJii doing a thing
just show Chris going to college
like
if they did it efficiently
well
if they did it properly
it'd be a minute or two of unvoiced content
with people reincarnating
set 12,000 years later
Symphogear Evol
Zesshou Senki Faust Robe
that makes sense
and a way
they'll find a reason
If they need to make more gears in another production
what Hibiki did was she used her feelings for miku to *alter* her philosophical armament, transforming it from a god killing curse to a god purging blessing
Remember we've been told repeatedly the difference between curse and blessing is minimal
regarding why did Metanoia work
I think I've got it
Solo
okay
I kept forgetting the god killing ability is also a curse
see, I was stuck thinking of the curse of balal all this time
and I just got it
I know this is what the episode basically screamed at me but the translation was ass
she overrode the god killing aspect
that's what the line about "who says my feelings can't contend with 2000 years of curses"
Hibiki single handedly remade her ~~noble phantasm~~ philosophical weapon
hey I had a thought
figured
millhi is it as bad as I remember
is a pun
of the entire 5 part series
the entire emotional climax
so
they really were planning this from a mile away
fuckers
that as well
the same
so "give it back" and "give her back" are, as I understand it
and of course there's no pronouns in japanese
and she believes that the strong control the future
yeah, she'd been defeated
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
since the armament works on what people believe it can do
she got everyone in the world to desire to "give it/her back"
explodes away
so, of course Shem-ha just
Kaneko's too much of a wuss
you don't become a VA without a stretch of background hollering and unnamed characters
have had acting experience
all "newbies" that are up for consideration for a main role
anyway
She was *Madoka*
Well obviously
when she was signed on
ungifted
Aoi was musically uh
that was the single worst idea I've had in months
I have impressed myself
wow
how'd you like Kesha, Adele, Taylor Swift to don their new gears and fight Noise under the command of Captain Yeezy
Symphogear International
I know
in a different form
I mean it's what Carol did to her
<@279341087494242304> the knowledge that Hibiki was actually aware of her feelings and knew she was into Miku makes that scene sting a lot more than the idea of her being oblivious
this makes the s1 scene where Miku says "I don't think I can be your friend anymore" *all the worse*
oh god
Hibiki wasn't a dense idiot, she was just afraid to cross the gap, same as Miku
renai circulation symphogear mashup incoming
nvm
oh, selfish wish
dino just described madoka
for the record
reflection and detonation were based on plots written by kaneko
`I personally find shuten Aoi's worst role`
you might want to go to <#336297840529899522> if you really want to talk about this though
they'll get there
which is soon I have heard
Tsukihime remake might actually happen after Nasu gets off FGO
Tsuchinoko real
yeah, please no
XV Hibiki is fine, but a Carol that's definitely not from GX isn't
as long as it's not important
so yes
as per my post in rules
> If usernames are judged to be in violation of the spoiler policy, they will be changed. If profile pictures are violations, you will be asked to change. While crops of XV screenshots are not off-limits for profile avatars, ones that reveal major twists or plot beats of XV are.
It's the poem about a cuckoo coughing up blood
"I don't think I can be your friend anymore"
~~which makes Miku rejecting Hibiki in s1 hurt even more~~
same with Miku
Hibiki has apparently just been too afraid to close that last distance all this time
and her own
she *knew* about Miku's feelings
but she was fucking *in charge* of that confession
see that's what I thought until this episode
I can understand that point of view
weird is a little judgemental for me
Japan is different, at least
even in het *romance* anime
*any* kiss in anime is rare because as a culture they don't really like PDA that much
I, personally, don't think it's because they're lesbian
And
There's been a lot of discussion about the no kiss
*chef kiss*
the guitar growl while hibiki starts to pull in that golden energy in response to shem-ha
I think it'll end up above AXZ next time I rewatch and rank
GX had a lot of problems but I like it a little more every time I rewatch it
Chris never called Hibiki by name
Just realized something I didn't realize I was disappointed by
a music video for kimi dake no ni would be really good goddamn
I mean I'd love more animation, I just don't know what they'd do to make Miku's different in a way that was worth the hundreds of dollars it would cost to make
is way more likely than getting a transformation sequence we kind of already have
I think putting 45 seconds of possibly even just still images over the credit roll
at all
I don't agree
why redo it
before it was a transformation sequence for a gear that didn't have one
why are you betting on that
<:Thinkki:514552069563088896>
it's only been a year or so since we last saw her
probably
running flower
I thought it was a nice touch
I thought the numbers were different, but I also didn't go and check
I thought the one at the end of XV was slightly different though
so movies would be around that
apparently most 1 cour shows are about 2 mil <:llennDisappointed:432399986630590474>
I *think* that's a few million dollars you're asking them to put down
5? Unless they're all 4 hours long it'd be more like 7-8
recap into continuing seems unlikely
symphogear has 65
Madoka took 2 movies to do 13 eps
movies are certainly possible but I agree that it's not in the "most likely" category
I'm saying it didn't have to be part of that arc, cypher
Yeah
Smiling and waving silently along with everyone else seems just a little weak for the girl whose courage made everything else happen
It could just mean kanade saying she's proud or something
Nah
Due to VA issues im sure
Yeah, but XV did a bad job in general in tying kanade in
Because kanade got kicked out
I'm a little sad about the ED
The actual plot and subplots could have been tied up better but as an emotional capstone it's very good
A+
<@139432096023183360> hibiki saved the world by linking everyone's feelings and getting them to subscribe to hibimiku
2 gungnirs
~~it bugs me she made 8 gears~~
Less dumb, more willing to make a riskier move because of morals
It's a pretty obvious move to make which means the most obvious conclusion was that the custodians had empathy with humanity
In that universe she didn't stand still like an idiot for 5 minutes
Hear me out
Or
Maybe she died
Adam's plan isnt affected by any other season, at most it's delayed a little by not having the chateau data and leyline map
Symphogear Rebuild 1.0
Oh no
Symphogear Redux
The worst timeline
S6 rolls around and reveals 5s ending was all a yggdrasill induced dream
Yep
anime
but do not know for sure
I thought precure was
gundam and macross were original works
precure
macross
<@231492516820680704> gundam
as demonstrated by at least one person here
including symphogear
most of them aren't for everyone
there's a lot of very very good original anime series out there
mind you, if they do do a movie I could see one final live
their voice budget spending has kind of been absurd, I'd imagine
perhaps if symphogear Strikers or whatever gets approved they'll try to move to cheaper voice actors, believing they have brand name power
yeah, that's possible
we have no idea if elfnein ages or not
he just got sick of it
Kinda the same reason Amuro's voice actor swore he'd never do another mecha protagonist again
I'd expect not everyone to return
due to idols getting older/wanting to do other things with careers/etc, if there's another series and another live
anyway, point is
I can see a cameo, yeah
Aoi loves the project, but she isn't a singer, knows she's not a singer, and being on stage/mic with some of the biggest names gives her anxiety, she's said
Nana's hovering on retirement and Aoi doesn't like doing symphogear
it won't be with all these girls
if there is
Maybe there will be another series, maybe not
probably will be the last with this cast, yes
the reason symphogear's sales kept climbing was a lot to do with the lives
love live etc just do what symphogear does to make actual money, better
I don't know if you can call multimedia projects "anime originals" but like
Symphogear seems to be an exception <:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
and *generally* they become major franchise tourdeforces
Anime originals do hit 5 seasons, it's just uncommon
yeah, circling back around
GIRI GIRI AIIIIIIII
amuro wears a locket ||with sayla's intimate hair|| for luck <:llennDisappointed:432399986630590474>
parts of it were very very dumb
dumb
it was
there's a novelization of 0079 that was his original story, basically, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't published until after the anime
Figmas being poseable is a big selling point
80's pretty decent
<@468591607332208641> for a decent *poseable* figure with reliable QC
Figmas and Nendoroids have the benefit of having good pricing and QC
not from them though
yeah
they make figures
Good Smile Company
but we would have gotten figmas and nendoroids
GSC doesn't do any of that
no
I'm eternally sad GSC didn't sign on to any other season except s1
please don't drag nsfw stuff into conversations without a good reason <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
ironically, this does more to stop her from talking than being dead
one of the reasons you haven't heard Kanade say much of anything since G is her VA's pretty busy
If they can't get Nana Tsubasa will appear about as much as Kanade
yeah, there's obviously limits
there's a degree you're kind of expected to push yourself
to an extent
suffering comes with the job
shirabe's VA is both a major player in another idol anime and part of fripSide
Nana's *gotta* be thinking about retiring
but
zesshoushinai is the title of the little chibi OVAs
they're busy animating the show until like 2-3 weeks before the bd goes on sale
shinais are never on bd 1
more than one BD1 that is
if you're ordering more than one bd maybe
maybe it turned to dust in the 5,000 years
they didn't see it in the control room
eh, I don't know about that, but I'm not about to jump into an argument about the thematic nature and limits of mecha as a genre atm
rather than be a power spike
it introduced the upgrade early, but used it to screw over the protagonists
actually that reminds me that XV did something that I've seen mecha do a few times but never magical girls
rather than a quirk
it's a good quirk but it inflated until it became what defined her as a character
the dess is definitely something I wished they didn't double down on
I'm glad XV moved away from "Kirika is stupid" and moved to "Kirika is an easy-going memer"
is by her being A Teen
it's the only way the whole DMJii climax moment in G works at all
immature definitely fits Kirika
well
I'm not going to rain on anyone's parade, if it's how you want to read the relationship fine, but Hibiki doesn't really seem all that dumb and Miku doesn't seem like she looks down on her

the post is probably a joke though, but those are my thoughts <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
sure.
uh.
isn't the biggest reason was that she had no choice because it was destroyed
'why miku never kept her symphogear'
mizugia
Flying into the beam was probably the single most significant action in symphogear, aside maybe from Kanade's sacrifice
and hibiki being dead
the parallel universe where hibiki didn't fly miku into the beam results in shem-ha never being in miku
I think most of those gears could have managed that if they weren't beat up
I don't really think that's a mark of her being OP
so that makes sense
faust robes are implied to be better than symphogears in general
but hey, close enough
they chose instead to forget Miku existed
Oh, yeah, SSJ would have to be depowered at the least and they wanted a non-fighting protagonist
I feel Axia no Kaze doesn't, as much
but almost all symphogear songs work great out of context
it is much better in the episode
it worked, the same way that two independent songs played back to back would work
*ehhhhhhh*
and
It got used in full in final AXZ
it just feels completely independant
It *kinda* works, but the second half needs more anchoring with the leitmotifs
Hajimari no Babel was a good implementation
The chants shouldn't be used for a setup to an heavy action song
yeah
it shouldn't, not when paired with the first part
and
my issue with axia no kaze's second half is that it does slap
she is precious
I use elfnein whenever I'm not doing a dmjii combo
I just don't think it fits
it's not bad
it doesn't fit
yeah axia no kaze's second half always annoys me
elfnein commits fraud by claiming herself as a dependent
If you're declared legally dead and get revived through a medical miracle I do not think you get a clean record
I could see Elfnein getting locked up in the next ryugu
Kinda glad they did because I kinda don't want to have to think about SONG/UN figuring out how to deal with Carol's crimes
what she *needed* was closure, she was *searching* for Carol
let me rephrase
okay
hopefully, she's found it
She also refused to take breaks because she spent all of her free time searching for closure with carol
I really hope that part of the way she's been changed is she'll stop refusing to sleep
but okay
probably older
changed
I'm glad she came out of this okay
elfnein is the most precious muffin
aside from my latin classes I don't know a lot about this period
I guess Gallian or Gallic is more accurate than Gaulian
he was later executed
he's considered somewhat of a hero because when he lost he handed himself in to allow as many of his men as possible to escape
Vercingetorix was a gaulian king who fought caeser
kiri would be a full time twitch streamer
or maybe
Kirika feels like a future PE teacher to me
Tsubasa/Maria are probably going to continue idling in idoling
I might open up fancontent to be XV-spoiler okay in a few days but for now it's not really open to them
yeah I have no idea
dino might be hoping for keywords
I think maybe kaneko didn't make up his mind either
I agree it's ambiguous though
pink shards
after
before
here's my evidence
chances are the converters broke
actually
uh
but idk
I think some of them have dab sprays?
kiri would play whatever characters had a dab emote
But regret suffices
It's not redemption
Well
It was revealed that millaarc might not have enjoyed murdering everyone and that's all the redemption I really need from someone who doesn't really exist
She'll be like 60
Just don't count on Nana to save you
Look forward to the noise attacks in 20 years
Macross has been quiet
Satelight has been *really* lax in cashing in their nostalgia cards lately
<:basaWHAT:578349187327066132>
Millaarc did kind of have a shit eating grin during every kill
Germain ended up getting a single line to the tune of "hm maybe these weren't warranted after all"
Yeah pretty much
professionals
well
and
The only times I thought they showed chemistry was on stage
there was no chemistry, just moe blushing
Previously all their scenes could be explained as either just professionals working together or Maria having a crush and blushing in response, at most
was talking about maria/tsubasa being the yuribait
I
try and actually flesh it out into an adult relationship
They had to cram Maria and Tsubasa together to make up for the fact that the pairing had just been yuribait before
nothing to suggest it isn't still there
they didn't *cover* it
I don't know if dropped is the right word
the OP told us who'd be getting scenes together
well, just like AXZ
I think Chris was mad at her at one point? Maybe it was just reacting after she left the room
I have, in fact, seen this scene, yes
I think it's just a perspective difference
prior to XV
the maria/basa conversation? A disagreement on whether they laid actual foundations for a romantic pairing between the two or whether they just threw Maria blushing onto screen as bait
the fifteenth season was the best
Not really an answer for why it was inside tiki but she seems the kind to like to stick random stuff inside her so
It was how they knew to go to Antarctica nvm
OH
I'm not just remembering that out of nowhere?
That was in xv 1 right?
So why was a scorpion inside tiki
not relevant to this channel
like Tiki
but I was expecting they'd try to use one as a vessel for the divine power
I was a little suspicious they'd do something with all the autoscorer bodies
and it didn't even have the girls doing much of anything
but to me, XV 7 was peak symphogear
13 was an incredible send-off for the series
episode 7 was my favorite goddamn
some can, the rest have google translate <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it was some weird mishmash of alchemical and relic power pretty much nobody designed any part of it to do and elfnein and the bridge bunnies only made it work with some adhoc adjustments
Fine's gears didn't defeat Adam, and neither did Ignite
She just had an awful personality
Though I did like the *idea* of an autoscorer who was mostly for computer stuff
Ver with Nephilim is probably second from the bottom after like, Tiki
She was an intimidating protagonist not because of the force she could exert but because there's kind of an inevitably about her
Particularly Fine
Also power is hard to define for some of them
Officially? No
Or, at least, intend to keep pushing xdu as Content
That sounds a lot like they intend to keep the franchise going sooner rather than later
Oh?
Tsubasa shakes her fist at team rocket blasting off again
they fight
no one is hurt
but considering an alternate world where Millaarc just drops into the concert
yeah
were there better ways of doing it?
it established XV wasn't going to be the hug party that GX and AXZ was where nothing bad ever happens to anyone
For me, killing the girl worked pretty well
s1 had a lot of tinge of "you can't save everyone" and such, especially at the start
XV definitely acknowledge s1's overtones in a way that especially GX and AXZ dodged
fucking elfnein faceplanting
that was a good selection of clips
unlike hibiki, chris, or tsubasa, which are kind of overexposed at this point
because you can still tell stories about them, especially as individuals
I hope those two are the two that actually do get prominent billing
if they ever do a spinoff
still
but yeah the things they've tackled are no longer weaknesses
~~they never started one~~
DMJii never failed to finish an arc
they're signalling that they've grown by the way they're used
It's kind of like Chris
in XV they're shown as fullfledged members of the team that can be relied on
DMJii's arcs have mostly focused around struggling to mature and connect to others without being a burden
yeah seems ok to me
the hair's good
I mean
you like batwoman more than batgirl?
this isn't a server position, it just seems a bit <:concerned:288512422912720896>
I don't really appreciate your association between lesbians and "cringy"
if they sell no BDs and get 10 million signers on a petition they won't do anything
buying BDs will do more
topic is XV
No
legit
Something XV lost in its ambition of trying to put 16 episodes of stuff in 13
They spared her a single line about not having to suppress her heart anymore or something
and hey, we'll always be here to write fan stories and talk about characters and stuff
it'll get better
most fans will move on
it's okay for franchises to end
Just because there isn't any content doesn't mean people will pay for content out of desperation
my mistake
iirc there's a dmjii unison
I think XV was trying to tell us how they've grown by *not* showing them in problems they've kinda had before
kinda like Chris
however
They did stop Elsa and they helped stopped NR a few times early season
They were part of the team
yeah I felt boob missile was inevitable
Basa's move was half clever, half suicidal
the late half they were busy with "yeah just use the homing bullets we have a plot to close out"
I feel like we got an okay amount in the early part of the show
Triggered isn't an acceptable way to refer to people getting upset because it devalues people with traumas and makes it difficult for them to talk about things that cause actual physiological harm and reactions

"just a word" isn't a concept, words harm and words help and saying things are "just jokes" or "just words" isn't server philosophy
Hi I'm staff
noble red were getting sucked out, and it's not like you instantly lose all air pressure
orz
but a special attack card with one would be sweet
I don't think I'd ever want Chris to main a shotgun
as that typically involves minimal movement
from an animation perspective the revolvers were much better than billion maiden
no billion maiden or crossbow spam
a few one-off weapons for special attacks
that was basically the only thing she used
I was excited for the revolvers but
XV Chris was weird
she also never used a shotgun
<@185949743321579520> regarding the "only thing chris hasn't used is throwing weaposn"
Number two is animation fixes ~~including Chris' parents~~
Epilogue is number one yeah, I've wished for it enough here
Itd be awesome but there's some structural stuff I want
Personally a Miku transformation is number 3 or so on my priority list for the final bd
Miku by herself may never happen but would be the final bd
If you mean shemha that should be the last moment of BD 4
I think my order is s1 > XV > G > GX > AXZ
SHC is psp iirc
"person on foot" is a very rare size
And theyd all be ss or maybe even 3s
Also tiny units are generally very strong if you can get size ignore
Protags are always good unless they're heavily repeating series
Bikki won't be the worst
I could also see Maria being all 3 FIS girls
I feel like they need Chris
Even if we probably wouldn't get 6 units <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I'm still hopeful for symphogear to be in srw
The consoles that are region locked these days are pc and phone
it's what kirika would play
~~nana does~~
over all volumes
yeah AXZ was only a 14k average
*not* anywhere in the 20k range
they are
Have you looked at BD 2 sales for the other series
XV BD1*
most shows have trailing tails
I kind of expect it will?
I mean
and is a commercial failure from a BD standpoint
yeah fire force had a decent amount of social presence
bonuses they didn't put in BD 1 besides a CD
I've read speculation that the BD market overall is uncertain and they manage entirely on bonuses
streaming services
major change since S1
also
because they're 60 dollars for 2 episodes
the pool of people who buy blurays is really small
most 'successful' anime don't push past 15k
the CD sales are really strong
G had a live, yeah
they don't cancel 400 dollars of merchandise they don't need because they're "mad"
5 copies of a bluray or more for better chances at the tickets
People would buy like
Chad for clarification
Yeah the patch job was pretty solid
it has a handheld mode and a staff mode
We see it change shape at some point
unstoppable force vs infinitely regenerating object
not anything else
but it was Durandal vs Nehushtan that were in mutual annhilation
The staff can change shape, for the record
yeah I'm pretty sure the broken and fucked up dolls were a reference to Chris' past and role as Fine's puppet
I like that filter
animation error fixes and polish usually happen as they put it on bluray
that's why it's like that in the BD version
it is, yes
instead of megadeath
also spelling it megadeth
time to delete my account
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
oh
fixing the important issues
security guards don't count
I mean XV's only the second with loss of life
s1 had a few thousand die but tens of thousands escaped
I think
s1's had less
it was stolen by the researchers who ran away from America
ironically I think that's what they were *doing*
SONG didn't exist for another 6 months
sure
Just done with more budget
That's actually a call back to how s1 was animated I thought?
It's a carry over from singles on vinyl records <@301205769494331393>
Only one plays in the season
They all come with two songs
Every character has a single

just stick it at the end
no I meant after the long title

30 is aquarion
80% of this is getter, ggg, or gurren lagann
gomen
fuck me I sound elitist as shit
this was not created by a deep fan of the genre
there's like 3 anime in there
I mean not really
I'm upset
they're mixing gundam into this
as a super robot fan this hurts me
Commie is ridiculously bad at side projects like bds
I'd like to get Misaki Kuno's take on it because she doesn't have a lot of high profile roles
I think Ayahi is the VA most attached to the series
üëÄ
it will be archived, yes
I would appreciate if we didn't go into a discussion of who is liked and not liked though, that's not going to be healthy
I knew it, VTN hates me <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
fudou to fine
that said I'd love a longer scene but <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
to the audience, they are eternally in the moment we've wanted them to be in for so long
because in a lot of ways, cutting on the brink is more powerful
I think the reason they didn't wasn't because of cowardice but because of a desire to paint the scene with more innocence and purity
yeah
there's no "just friends" alternate explanation for that scene
also I think hibimiku was canonized by the show, even if we didn't get DA KISS
I'm glad you finally caught up! <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
maybe chris' parents didn't show up because they admit that genjuro is her dad now
he looked like g ep1
at least they didn't give him clownface
kiri why
headpat
where people carol kills don't come back
millhi do you have any idea what happened to cause the big GX animation error gaffe
yeah if they weren't in the op it'd be easier for me to swallow
along with uhhhh adding chris' parents to the "everyone's here" scene wtf where are they
what I'm really, super hoping for is BD6's cut will have an animated epilogue over the black scrolling credits
that sounds a lot like it has a vocal
yeah there's an instrumental when miku shows up at the end
don't want to draw one up just for a song and a line
contractual issues I assume
<:sadmiku:432799416227725312>
should be 8
7 part song
XV's gyakko
UGH
I did like the slight added texture Millaarc's line revealing she's been hating what she's been doing added
yeah
anyway I was pretty happy with XV in all, didn't quite hit the right notes at the end with the NR plot to make it better than s1 for me, but it's solidly above the rest
nice

I was very excited symphogear was willing to actually have lasting dramatic events again
ep 2 was wild
I was kind of annoyed at Vitalization at the time because it's Hibiki + Maria rather than everyone, really; and I was particularly annoyed at the moment with the show for not letting Maria sacrifice herself
That's pretty fair
Mine's probably the SSJ tackle
maybe not visually impressive, but a way better point about connection when that's been the theme of the series
I felt that metanoia was a really good capstone
was kinda the point of the whole curse or blessing conversation
if she used her god-killing fist on the final boss, miku would have died

You get a token when you pull a card you've already max awakened
No
is the current plan
Tokens would not be convertable to kiricoin, but you will be able to make them into prism tokens to buy any card
Not yet
until then they are being tracked and recorded in your account so you don't lose any
Tokens are something that you will, in the future, be able to trade in to buy specific cards from the shop

```rv_rename
Use this to rename cards. rv_rename "Secret Bikki" "Not So Secret" will rename your card 'Secret Bikki' to 'Not So Secret'.```
<@212254733925089282> rv_rename is what you're looking for
I've never seen Rakhi use gomenasorry, if you're going to claim something as your brand you have to be noticeable about it
You will be able to buy kirikas of your choice one day
Pet them, take care of them, love them
is what I was getting at
Right, because at level 2 or 3 they look different from each other
if it's a duplicate of a card you have it probably awakens with different art
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Yeah, that's a good point, we should expand the documentation a little
if something went wrong we'll refund you anything you missed, apologies
She has access to the backend files and can tell us what's up later
<@!102691114762371072> when you get off work, can you look at this?
If you get a duplicate of a max awakened card, you get a character token, which will be used in a later implemented shop to directly buy cards of your choice
It means you get 5 pulls, but if they're duplicates it'll go towards upgrading the card(s) you have
Rares in RV don't really match any star system, when we build a gacha we basically go through a list of cards and shove them in a common bucket and a rare bucket - how rare they were in XDU doesn't have to apply to the gacha
It's pretty rare to have a 4 level card
For that card, yeah
Awakening improves the card art, and you automatically awaken a card 1 rank when you pull a duplicate
We don't have guaranteed rares but the rares are pretty common, if that makes sense
she might be more distracted though
Tokens are used for a future shop not yet implemented, but they are being tracked
look how happy she is

The method to use tokens isn't currently implemented but they're being tracked so you still get credit for them
if it's at max level and you get another dupe, you get a token
that simple
when you get a dupe, it levels up

is that the transparent chris you can see inside
but that's partly also because transition usually involves cutting a lot of ties
I think most of the trans girls I know have moved after transition
Understandable
then it's probably not what your long term plan should be
but if it feels like youre just settling on being a feminine guy
It is okay to just be a feminine guy
obviously you need to take considerations of what's going on in your life right now, but as a rule of thumb thing
I'm cis so don't take my advice too seriously, but my friends tell me that if you get to the point where you're having long debates with yourself over it, it'd probably be good for you if you just did it
sun/moon fixed that by giving everyone equally boring options
yeah no need to get defensive
boys got jack shit while girls got like... all the fashion
oh my god that was absolutely my motivaton in pokemon x/y
the favorite excuse of eggs everywhere
Validation's a powerful drug
It's a gamble, I think
I just assume that any online space defaults to having a shit and uninformed look at stuff like trans issues and avoid bringing the stuff up
if it's the same nexon that I played for back in the original maplestory beta, nexon doesn't care about anything but microtransactions
I think it's people who respond to life being unfair by being jerks to other people, because if you can do that, then that means you have at least *some* power
I think it's a manifestation of a specific evil but the trigger is the same as generic white feminism
and that's how you get shit like TERFs
because then you fixate on that one thing, and everything is filtered through that
I think one of the most dangerous traps is when you have overwhelming privilege... just with one large tick marked down from that
and for a lot of people the truth is there's not a lot you can do aside from keep an empathic mind
because the response is "well what am I supposed to do about it"
yeah, there's a problem when you tell some people all this
oh I misread your point
but it's hard as hell to *see* that
You still have more privelige than others in that situation, because things like getting a job etc will be easier
because people can live in kind of a shit life and still not see that the system favors them implicitly
while other people can *certainly* see the relative difference, it makes it difficult to educate about it
instead, you merely aren't taking the same penalty others are
you do not get a thing
in the way it manifests in most people's life, it's not proactive privilege
I think there is a lot of difficulty in how decisions revolving around privilege are usually framed
compulsive voting isn't a solution because all you're doing is guaranteeing decisions made without critical thought
of course, you can't be careless in which you attack and how hostile you are about them, and this is typically where things get knotty
there are paradigms and ideas that people have that are harmful and that they cling to, and to let them feel safe in clinging to them is a form of perpetuating harm
I also disagree that "making anyone feel attacked is wrong" is a worthwhile goal - at least, without critical thought behind it
white feminism has an overall trend of ignoring people who don't fall into their little world
the role of hte white bisexual progressive female character in that video was actually to be obnoxious on purpose because her role was to show that even if you're disadvantaged, you're probably still better off than others
it's not enough to just not use the privilege to do bad things, the ethical thing to do is to use it to help others who don't have it
particularly if you've already picked a side you're increasingly inclined to shut yourself off or metaphorically change the channel if people keep trying to thrust emotional burdens on you
also there's the problem of acclimization and desensitization
perhaps different levels of nuance are required across different projects because not every level will be tolerated or swallowed by every slice of population
I feel that asking me to rewrite their skit is not exactly a fair rebuttal here, it's a shade too close to "well could you do it better?"
but it turned me off of the video
was it wrong to bludgeon? perhaps I'm not qualified to make that decision
the decision to convey the point that way rather than, maybe, just game theory of the fact that the people on top are going to stay on top was what I considered a bludgeon
playing cards with the actual inequalities etc written on them was really what I thought was too much
I'd probably abstract the message one step
I don't have a problem with other people watching it
I generally don't spend my free time by choice being led around intellectually like a child, so I'm generally not going to watch a lengthy video that tries to beat me into submission with its point
perhaps especially for that
even for a message I agree with
It means I'm not going to sit through it, generally
I couldn't get all the way through because I could tell that no matter what point it was going to end on it was going to be heavy handed about it
pretty distressing
I think exodia in context would be
I don't think you can, because while you can put out the same effort to offend everyone equally, you inflict different levels of damage on different groups by doing so
"how could you put this in a children's _____"
otherwise how could you be trapped into it
yeah the implication here is that "being gay" is a state to avoid
and implicit heteronormativity
it's essentially an elaborate joke about being "tricked" into being gay and like, ???
also even just using it for characters is problematic
it's honestly really complex and I tend to remove myself from those conversations
it's good that someone's supporting but at the same time they can't be the banner wavers
when the charisma and hero worship starts kicking in, it's like the movement gets... stolen? from the people it should belong to
I kinda get the hate, and I say this as a cishet straight white dude
that said an ally is liable to get fried at just about any time  for various reasons, so...  I don't know, it doesn't surprise me
I'm unfamiliar with (or have forgotten) this specific drama
and that closed some people's ears on the matter
because yelling at the big men in charge felt good
There were certainly some people who laid blame and accusations relating to privilege around without real willful and critical thought a few years ago
knowing about privilege solves zero problems, it's just one - and not the only one - way to build a structure to talk about a solution
educating about it is good, but educating about it doesn't do anything in itself
It might be because it's... a thought framework
it is, of course, noteable that it's not an inevitable outcome, it's still hatred, and having a 'reason' for actions does not remove your culpability for them
it's similar logic to abused kids becoming bullies
and having some power feels nice! Especially when you're so used to complaining about not having any
Masculinity isn't too bad but you gotta redefine parts first because it's all mucked up
üëå
She/her?
That happened to me
But on the other hand, for some of them, seeing someone close transition leads down the path to becoming better people
It's better now than it uses to be but you'll lose a few probably
Friends are a hard part
which is an incomplete metric
gender dysphoria
another problem is that you'll frequently see stats that are just for like
it's common *enough*
1-3 or something
I would believe something around 1%
not a permanent decision
yeah, nothing wrong with trying it on for size
if you don't know about that but you're just pretty sure you're not a boy, that's valid too
if you think you're a girl, you're a girl
transition is irrelevant to whether you're trans or not
trans femmes, trans women, trans girls are the usual terms
I know girls who have started in their 40s and they still get results
20s not terrible
The younger you start the more pronounced the results
And unlike GRS it's kind of time sensitive
That's good
I've known people who had to give up and self med
Lucky
Most of it revolves around lowering testosterone levels and increasing estrogen levels
I'd suggest HRT first
There's a song from an old visual novel called Ever17 that I have been programmed to cry at every time

It's like seeing a growling baby tiger
lmao you're adorable
They usually depend a lot on the type of hormone therapy you do
It is worth mentioning there's emotional and sex drive changes but I'm not really an expert on those at all
I didn't realize diuretics were uh, that severe until then
My girlfriend goes like every or every other anime episode while we marathon
Mostly but not completely true
It's a stereotype

There's a long list of euphamisms
Feminems
Your endocrinologist will go over this with you like 6 times before you start
I mean being trans is a raw deal in general
that must have been hard
it's frequently used for fertility and menopause easement
HRT is used for things besides transition

I agree that's a misuse of power but I don't agree with the idea that "therefore, unions are bad and we should let the powers that be decide whether our jobs can actually feed us"
it's their job
they're elected to do that
Mr "Oh it'd be a shame if you unionized, you'd miss out on those stock shares!"
like, elon musk is in the news right now for doing exactly this
this isn't just a trump thing
I think the contradictions are actually a little deeper than that but I don't follow too many sex workers and only have a loose grasp of their stances
insert some spiel about them selling out to the patriarchy
sex worker exclusionary reactionary feminist
the TERF and SWERF overlap is incredibly huge because demographic is a big part of both
Yeah it's a shit form of pseudo-equality, where everyone must be equally subjugated and suppressed
if you're being Horny In Novel you might as well be porn
it's like a parallel
if you're being Thirsty On Main you might as well just post nsfw
isn't that the law of twitter
nothing stopping porn from being interesting or wholesome
I'd probably classify it as porn without further information
It's an eroge and it's not the kind of eroge that barely touches on sex, from what I've seen
"I prefer porn-focused"
it's not too hard
because ideally we'll stop mostly using it *this* generation
This is a debate our children should not have
it's not too hard to move on
trap is less than 2 decades old in the online lexicon
but those are all old words and much harder to deal with
the word 'bad' is, I believe, transphobic or something
And ableist, and other problematic content
it's literally predicated on the fear of ending up gay
The word is inherently homophobic though
same as now
back then it meant people like bridget, cross dressers, etc
No, not really
which is almost as bad
and if it's not based on the *fear* that they are, it's certainly based on the *joke* that they are
when this was highly relevant
I was on 4chan /b/ at like 06
something's only a 'trap' if A) you can be 'tricked' into it and B) if it's something you're 'avoiding'
which is this
and honestly andrea never brings up an aspect of trap I think is worth visiting
and well enough supported
I'm not actually going to disagree with that, but I feel like all the scattered points are well enough defined
what about the article do you want to discuss
yeah I'll bite
Anyway I'm feeling spunky is there anything I can help with
It's emotional labor
man you make it sound like germans are really good at being offensive
you can pick the gender that's in quantum flux
use qbits
that's actually a really interesting example <@!193408538909868033>
yeah, "to retard" is a thing but it's been so mixed up
just like "negro" is a term for describing african americans but *you shouldn't use it*
The use of that is dated, though
I feel like that says everything?
>informal, offensive
>dated, offensive
the others are too difficult to
Retarded is something you should cut
ahaha yori
fuccboi
it wasn't directed at me but it was still horrid
I had to sit through a "you choose to be offended" lecture the other day
how do you bungle an ass
???????
but I sat down and thought about it and it took me like 20 seconds to go "yeah no I'm a boy"
I hit a lot of the egg checkmarks
like
If you're deliberating this long over it you're very probably not cis
good luck
but it's mostly out of the US lexicon to my knowledge
I don't think a lot of people know it's that bad anymore outside of those communities
probably because we had shit like government issued posters that literally said 'slap a jap'
yeah 'jap' is pretty bad here
yes
NYC is probably the state with the second biggest rural/urban dichotomy after cali

I'm still not used to seeing billboards for weed shops
at *some point* a good person is going to wake up and realize that the justification for hurting others is paper thin and falling apart
I think a person's goodness isn't determined by what they're taught to believe, but they might need some time to see the wrongness of that before the goodness will lead them away
like at the start of it, five guys etc
yeah I know an enby who was huge into gamergate for a while and then woke up

I don't think I've ever stopped being glad I bailed 4chan in like

<@!225771411833225216> Are you sure that ultrasound was uh
I'm not in position to watch the video but does it touch on the 'argument' that getting offended is a choice
The face of Rational Discourse
/s
free speech means you should be guaranteed to make a livelihood off of any trash you want
you're not prepared to discuss it
rather than a defense mechanism
I think generally that if you think that being 'offended' is from having your feelings hurt
but nationalist fevers tend to run higher when we have stuff like the 08 recession
'fairness'
enforced fairness
similar stuff that lead to desires of 'ethnostates' tied in with feelings that things aren't fair, which can lead to a desire of authoritarianism
It has a lot to do with feelings of displacement
I did na-zi it coming
yeah sure
oh that's not a euphamism

Being trans doesn't cause mental illnesses, but the fact it puts you in a stressful environment (the environment's fault, not yours) aggravates and creates them
Ganbare
that's less something you want to correct and more something you want to avoid unless you're trying to extract money from them (possible)
as I said, it's mostly used by chasers
It's more a red flag
it does center "girl" which is nice but idk
I think I've seen it most often from sex workers and chasers, yeah
~~I just want to be cool~~
that's deep
you're still valid even if you're not getting help yet
üò¶
like it's okay but so is a lot of things
I am actually not a specific fan of yuri
it was a 9 year relationship, so there was uh
card
where my girlfriend pulled the "I want to be poly - because I really want to date someone else without being guilty over it"
My girlfriend is poly and I'm insecure over some things as a result, but a lot of that is baggage from my last relationship
boundaries have to be discussed and *kept to* and trying to guilt or manipulate people into adjusting where their boundaryline is is a sign the relationship isn't meant to be long term
The consent has to be pretty preloaded
Polyam only works if 'consent' is a concept that's damn near worshipped
that's hella rare
I will say that the polycule isn't "everyone lives together"
there's a whole damn polycule adjacent to me
You'd have to argue pretty hard because some of my friends have been making it work fine for something like 3 years
there's nothing to abuse
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but then again all the poly people I know are dirt poor
That's a cold an inaccurate way of looking at things
The actual answer to that is that either you compromise who you are to enter into a relationship or you *exit the relationship*
you're a good guy and you deserve someone better who pulls manipulative tactics like that man
and honestly?
Yeah it's super not okay that they abused you like that
that's still violating or abusing consent
Being poly doesn't mean you get to redefine relationships as you please
That's not okay, yeah
it's okay
well, not super happy
I'm not happy with the former but the latter fucked me up for about 18 months
I've had both
and about sticking to them
It's all about borderlines drawn up ahead of time at the beginning of the relationship
Entering into a polyamorous relationship and switching to a polyamorous relationship are two different things and the latter is far more inherently toxic
To continue a conversation from a different channel
this is some lewd geometry talk
that sounds very uncomfortable
`square peg`
but its *definitely not* something you can hit a partner with, "hey I want to be poly now"
Anyway if I'm going to be frank I don't really *like* it and if I had complete choice I wouldn't be in one, but my girlfriend knows about my issues and respects my boundaries and I don't think we're any less close because she's polyam
really what I consider honest polyamory
The "I want to be poly so I can cheat" type of poly isn't uh
it's in effect building their own family
because they sure don't get it from anywhere else, a lot of the time
who need and thirst for a network of support and validation a bit stronger than most people
I will add that most of the people who are poly that I know of are trans
and it's a giant network
it's usually one person is dating 3-4 people, who are each dating 2-4 people
"a group of 3"
when I see successful poly it's usually not
no getting out of that one without lots of pain
that's bad but hopefully that should be fairly treatable once in the hospital
saki how many chills ran up your spine reading that

On the other hand, those who stick by you are likely good people
Losing friends over transitioning is horrible but it seems to always happen
Hahaha
How limiting is the dilation schedule? Twice a day for an hour?
Non-harmful coping mechanisms preferably
At the end of the day it generally comes down to maybe medication getting rid of the worst of the problem and finding support and coping mechanisms for the rest
It implies there's someone out there who can fix it
'Seek help' is always so misleading
Yep
But it helps to have friends who tell you it's okay to be sad sometimes, and try to focus on the nice things when they happen
I used to be medicated and I miss it
<@138131889142628352>  there's mitsuya marketplace in kearny mesa

getting mistaken for a girl in mmos is the best
I've been called she a few times because I usually use absolutely adorable miku pictures as avatars
so many cute girls in this channel
it's a pet peeve of my girlfriend's
for the record a lot of trans people hate "mtf" or "ftm" because it implies they were, at one point, a different gender
but not having personal control over your space always sucks
~~it does look like a store display~~
bleh
nice
hide the important stuff under your porn
Some even got damaged, right?
that's really not cool
this isn't the channel to go into that though
and kirika still is

Yeah, it's something you're going to want to move past when you're ready

Madoka *is not* the same show without the context that existed when it first aired

strife and suffering aren't always the same thing

Yeah, it's now tied to basically trust in the respective government
That's why currency has in the past been tied to an actual substance with value and applications

" A new study estimates that this process consumes at least 2.6GW of power‚Äîalmost as much electric power as Ireland consumes. This figure could rise to 7.7GW before the end of 2018‚Äîaccounting for almost half a percent of the world's electricity consumption."
yeah but the computational requirements are straight up destroying the planet
I hope they get banned asap
I hate blockchain currencies with all my might
speaking of which
I'm curious though
I'm not sure how ancoms envision it going their way
aka large corporations
it's called "the people who already have resources and organizations set up"
there's a regulating body to steer it towards ancap
fans as in fanatics and not as in "I like this concept"
but I also hate the expectation a lot of socialist/communist fans have that you *have to* read the literature to discuss it
I don't like talking too much about it because I haven't read a whole lot of literature on it
in ancom everyone holds hands and shares
at least I feel like america would
which would be even worse
alyx you know it'd end up ancap instead of ancom
and it's a bandaid that more often than not hurts people
states rights is a shitty bandaid on the problem
you have a problem with a bad government
you don't actually have a problem with states rights
if you have problems with the federal government being able to stop the state government from doing something
okay here's the bottom line
the supreme court can except of course, their ability to do so *isn't in the constitution*
it's the ability to *not let anyone else tell you no*
autonomy isn't the ability to make your own decisions
I don't think you understand autonomy
Having policies and laws based on districts is fine, having *autonomy* is dangerous
worshipping states rights as sacrosanct is dangerous
district-driven policy is fine
it simply redefinies who the majority is
But splitting into states doesn't respect the wishes of the minority
They should be considered, listened to, and then discarded if there's a reason to do so
there are mistakes in it and things that should no longer be in it - it wasn't designed to be worshipped, it was designed to change as the people changed
it's a fucking country now and states rights are useful but overly worshipped
The constitution was one of the best documents of its time but the united states is no longer 13 colonies that need to learn to work together
people are just really intent on being awful shitheads and transphobes
there's honestly a lot of solutions
that's one solution

some people are so deep in the socioeconomic hellzone that it's a major diceroll that any bank loan will ever happen for them, or that they'll be in a position to use the money on something that's not *not dying*
"it's something you can develop" is not a universal truth
It also requires initial capital and resources that are a straight up form of privilege
While entrepreneurship and organizational skills are actual skills and actual labor, they're paid *super disproportionately* and you're supposed to accept the inequality because "they took a risk"
I minored in economics and I really liked how the model of capitalism works on paper, it's just the textbook version glosses over everything it does wrong and the abuse hardbaked into it
As long as people treat money like a score, it's harmful, no matter what it's rooted in
where are all the straight femmes hiding
I've never met a straight trans girl except one that had internalized terf and truscum rhetoric

some feminists dont view trans issues as feminist issues, because they view trans women as men in skirts and trans men as traitors who have joined the patriarchy

or they've just never been educated on intersectionalism
I have noticed that the online trans women community I get a glimpse into tends to... uh, worship, I guess, lesbianism? So maybe they never get attached to that kind of community because it's alienating

The most drama that tends to happen is 
"Mipha is the cutest"
"Actually I think almost all the characters are flat and poorly written"
"HOW DARE YOU REVALI IS MY HUSBANDO"
The current highly active membergroup is like at least a quarter female so I feel it's not a bad space, as gamer domains go 

Not that it's an infallible metric but it's something
They play it, they beat it, they ignore the server for months
Most of the community is fairly transient
Actually I think it came up once, someone remarked that she kind of burned out and then the topic moved on
I've been there 8 months and it's never come up
Neither is stuff like sexism present in the game or similar stuff though I watch really closely
No
Breath of the wild subreddit discord
Yeah there are 722 people online on the other server *right now* and we can't really have that flexibility
As an aside I want to say I admire the moderation team for picking the hard option on how to do things here, though I guess it helps that it's a small server 

I moderate on a larger server and we usually go with more hardline on politics talk and generally I have to assume that anyone bringing it up is a troll I have to remove and it's nice to have a more relaxed approach here
is he charging for his novel
haha jesus
how long is it ibu
DL's art is awesome

I'm dying of curiosity but I'm not about to join a bad server just for this
what's the flavor of shitfest

sometimes it's just *respect*
sometimes it's actual tangible help, sometimes it's just the ability to exist in a safe space
basically someone taking it upon themselves to decide that someone does or doesn't qualify for X - and depriving them of privileges because of it
oh
I think there should be some decently intense "are you sure" questions when initiating treatment with complications but if someone's gotten that far it's probably not doing it for a lark
it's an easy trap to fall into
there's different levels of argument but they're all bogus
you have to be on HRT, you have to have *the surgery*
you have to be *diagnosed* with gender dysphoria from specific physicians
Truscum are people who basically say you have to *qualify* as trans
is it a basic truscum argument? It boils down to gatekeeping
ohboy a truscum argument
ah
and I agree with WFC - bad people existing in a group doesn't make the group bad, but giving them free reign to spread harmful shit around turns the space toxic
Because this is the kind of thing you see cherry picked studies come into play
I'd try finding other pages on the subject to contrast with this doctor's
This man sells a book titled "why gender matters"
Solopy I scrolled down to the bottom of the page
Boogie is centrism at it's most toxic
Also the nastiest part of 'sex and gender are distinct' is that it's a baseless statement and nobody really is sure how much sexual expression goes into brain development
I can understand why it's a sore point though because 'there are exactly two sexes' is used to invalidate agender people and harm discourse about trans subjects in general
Even college textbooks are more a depiction of the model than a dissection of what sex expression is
I would suggest researching intersex, yes
And of course there's multiple sex chromosome cases galore
And then there's the stuff that's possibly environmental influences on natal development
`only two sexes`
Is not something you should treat as gospel by the way, the biology is incredibly messy and fucked
I don't know why the ice isn't broken
This is arguing on bad faith with a mindset to harm those that believe differently
I think that's really the biggest takeaway
Science is a *mess* these days because most things are bankrolled by this conservative think tank or that corporation or yet another liberal special interest group
Who you're friends with is your own business but he didn't even attempt to preserve this space as safe and nonhostile
He clearly jumped in and engaged with the intention of starting shit and causing injury
Once in a while that 'joke' popping up is an opportunity to teach, but there was nothing but callousness there
Sorry for the late continuation there
Please note that it's different from passivity, which is fine. There you're simply not engaging with politics, but when you tell everyone else to stop fighting you engage in causing harm
That's radical centrism
He worships the status quo because if you do nothing enough things get better anyway according to him
I consider boogie a radical centrist which is why I was so dismissive earlier
Radical centrism
I'm never okay with agender invalidation so I'm glad that was the result
I think it's possible to be very against something and yet enable it
I think you bear some sort of 'responsibility', but I don't think it's an *endorsement*
*bluh*
that's gross
is this still valk
The closer to closing you get the worse people get
I hate retail customers
I somewhat see your point here but it doesn't feel like something to upbraid someone over
Debate is emotional labor and you are not required to continue to engage
Phrasing might be better but saying that someone is too aggravating to personally engage with is fair
yes
not taking precautions is not the same thing as *inviting it*
it's nothing of the sort, it's merely me living the way I want and not taking a precaution
I could walk down a dark street saying "Man I love having lots of money" and it would still be 100% someone's fault for mugging me and 0% mine
but when you put it as "she's asking for it" you're actually diverting the responsibility of the rape from the rapist onto the victim and defending the rapist
I don't know the context
so the answer's probably, at least, that he's no ally, even privately
actually jack dorsey is a bad example here because he's had some really questionable likes and follows
but that's also asking you to perform intellectual labor for them for a *stupid* reason
I think it *is* transmisic, in the same way that passively accepting racism is racism, but I think that directly accusing them of it risks them going defensive... I'd probably have just led them down the path and let them make the final conclusion of "yes it is" on their own
here's what I think on this issue
otherwise it's enabling
Whether they ban immediately or just issue a warning is up to them, but it needs to be public and clear that harmful shit isn't okay
I'd consider it a public stance that they have no interest in protecting members on their server
I'd have to think more on it
I'm just not sure what I think about making it a generic statement
I mean if you're looking for approval in condeming how this specific situation was handled you have it
I also think it's important where you draw the line
I mean, on some level that's always true, but like, I think the degree matters
I think it depends what kind of platform
that's how we get death by tide pods after the forbidden fruit meme hit the youtube crowd
there's a bad pattern of content creators turning adult jokes and humor into preteen-accessible shit to make it trendy and funny and "this is cool you should play this" for people who aren't developed enough to handle it without it fucking them up
it'd probably be better if it didn't have all those "haha let's play doki doki on stream together :)" videos on youtube
I feel bad for him
and when I was 15 I had plenty of those
this kind of game isn't good for you when you're in a low spot
I wish the kid had taken the warning seriously
At work in a place I can't fathom why I placed it there

Yeah I don't really need help finding it
I lost my switch and it's kind of one of the bandaids allowing me to cope with the fact I really kind of loathe my life
I am actually kind of a wreck right now
why even be in it
like awful viewpoints are awful and potentially worth banning over in themselves but when you violate the premise of a discussion channel like that it's just ugh
"shut up sjw"
honestly that'd be enough for me to at minimum ban someone from a serious discussion channel, if not the whole server
but it's certainly what it sounded like, and if it's not that, it's a *shade* of that
Again, I don't have full context here
considering the other side was, well, a rape apologist
like maybe it's not to your taste but this doesn't feel like sufficient reason to say "well ibu wasn't being great either"
it's pointing out the entitlement of the gamer
except irl
the kind of protagonist who jokes about tripping flags
if you've never had ideation that clear that's a problem
oh yeah I missed that part
but it also might not be for you
It could be part of an adjustment period
I think if it's just ideation and you're not feeling compulsions to do it you're not in danger
Yeah I have that
does it have to do with crashing because I have those a lot
Everyone you heard bitching seriously about "nice guys finish last" holds some of the ideas that formed incel culture

they're not really behind
Japan's about as confused over it as the rest of the world
so the alterations they can and do make are *extremely* confined
translations don't get to touch the scripting of the game
since, generally speaking
it's hard to pin down concrete examples of this
Yeah, fair
and the resulting games have a lot of humor in them that honestly doesn't translate back
They've had to answer the question, "what do we do with this verbal tic" like 12 times over
just about every name in the game is a japanese pun and some patterns of behavior are *japanese* archetypes
they have to fuck with *so much*
I think the Ace Attorney games are really like the biggest example of this
I don't think just any change is fine, but I think that a good localization can make a good game better
because there isn't a singular author no matter how much the lead writer wants to think there is
it's passed through so many people's hands I don't have a personal problem with the 'author's intent' getting twisted or moderated
anyway I consider massive media projects like AAA videogames to be living media, almost
there's like a single frame where it's not perfectly placed
it's an impressive job considering they did it purely with subtitle scripting
I don't hold media made for consumption to be inviolate but I understand some people do
that's fair
they put so much work into it too

so
also ScarJo is going into this right after playing a character who is supposed to be asian
I think there are problems but I think we're past the age where we have problems finding qualified actors
Also it's really hard to find work and someone should have been given a shot at a lead role
There are trans men actors, using a cis woman just implicitly says "well they're the same as a woman"
It's a trash casting idea, as bad as making scarjo the major in gits
Holy jesus and I thought ghost in the shell was bad thinking

I used to be a channer, so I *get it*
Since I've never been on valk I don't have anything to directly contribute, but the "it's just normal for us" mentality is a dangerous one
I feel like I don't really know enough about the drama to form a final opinion, though, because I've only heard second hand about the kind of pressure
But these days there are really companies that are that sensitive to PR pressure
If that's the case, they still made a mistake by announcing her departure
it's a complex issue
She was in the wrong, but that doesn't mean the public response was just
I have a problem with the company not just quietly saying "Statements made by employees do not always reflect company values and the matter has been handled internally"
Here's the problem: If it's established that the pattern is "throw a shitfit publicly" "Company publicly disowns someone," you get more, and worse, public shitfits
TB contributed to making a select group of people's life on the internet worse for a while so I'm not going to get into that
And I'm saying none of that matters for how the incident was handled
but the problem as I saw it was that the community called for her head and the game company gave it to them
I skipped through it but the video seemed to 90% be a recap of the twitter stuff so I might have missed something
the problem isn't the action of letting them go if it's judged to be sufficiently out of line
they shouldn't have made an announcement about it
and if they did decide she didn't meet their standards
her posts did seem to be a bit out of line but that doesn't make a gamergate-like teardown campaign any more justified, or arenanet any more right in letting her go
because I've been seeing shit like this pass through my feed and wondered what kind of hellhole started it
but thanks, it does answer questions
this is perhaps not the best journalism
Does anyone know what's going on with this GW2 shit? All the second-hand conversation I'm getting sounds hideous
(cops don't belong at pride)
they can absolutely control who marches
they have cops there
I heard TERFs had an authorized march and the london pride twitter page (I checked it like an hour ago) is nothing but "look at all the corporations sponsoring us! :)"
London pride seems terrible
but that's both not always possible and you're demanding intellectual and emotional labor from someone to do it
sometimes
This is related to rule 1 of the server, incidentally

yeah you can
is that it's correct to be tolerant of everything except intolerance
I think the conclusion philosophy has mostly reached
it's that forcing people to be nice is still limiting freedom
I get the argument
That's the course of wisdom, but going burnt earth is as equally protected and unprotected by free speech as anything else
it doesn't mean that anyone else has to let you talk in their space
that's it
The right to free speech means that the government can't silence you
Ugh, yeah, reminds me of the whole milo speaking at colleges thing
but I think open communities should strive to limit it
And yeah, obviously, tight knit groups can get away with more
Yeah, I've grown to hate it because when someone's hurt at a joke, it becomes 'their fault' for not being able to 'deal with it'
That's fair, it's just the foundation of why I don't think that "it's just banter" is a healthy attitude to have for anything larger than a small circle of friends
I'm not really drawing parallels to any other situation because 4chan's somewhat unique, though if you were careful about it, parallels probably could be made
Because as the people who say "no dude wtf we aren't discussing that" decreases, others feel more at home - and those people decreasing is a natural consequence of time, if there's no punitative measures for that kind of attitude
In the 4 or 5 years I spent on 4chan it went from clever people pretending to be stupid, to internet harassment and vandalism simply because they could, to "let's make our own 'fictional' fascist movement and joke about it without ever really saying it's *bad*"

And most of that boils down to that no one is accountable and the people who provided the counterweight "dude that's too far and not funny" community response slowly left, as it grew *tiresome*, and basically the toxic stew thickened over time

Even the structure of the site shows the damage that's accrued over time. Early on a 'containment board' was simply something that sprung up because people got really tired of nothing but touhou discussions in their anime boards. Later, it's because they got really tired of people earnestly suggesting that gassing the jews was the correct move on nearly every discussion board.
Over time the concentration of "nasty" increases because the more mellow people decide it's not for them
but what that means for the community is kind of nasty
Sure, on a personal scale you can just leave
Ugh, I'm remembering 4chan now, wondering why I ever thought "if you don't like the heat, get out of the kitchen" was a good foundation for a community as a teenager
but it covers up actual toxicity and prevents quite a lot of people from feeling comfortable
yeah that's not cool
the guy who wrote up the recommendation that passwords require unique characters and mixed case and stuff has said that it's one of the biggest regrets of his life
judging from all the "look at all the corporations that joined us with rainbows today" posts on their twitter
there's apparently a lot of money behind london pride

Yorin throwin it down
*Oh*
is you start being like boogie and telling people they shouldn't fight so hard right now and instead focus on the long game
and the most dangerous part of thinking that slow and steady is the right way
but "slow and steady" is not a cut and dry superior option here
I'm not arguing for violent revolt
Putting dramatic changes off for a long time leaves people dead
but it is *not* fast enough
Like, whether you want to do an alternative course of action is a matter of debate
because it's killing people
If it can't, it's not fast enough
<@!246146781832806401> there are some legitimately good arguments that sufficient change cannot occur in an electoral system, but I agree with you that the alternative price is too high for my tastes
and I'd like to take a moment and say fuck tankies <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Revolutionist vs Revisionist is an ongoing argument on the far left
80% of the trump administration, particularly the stuff that gets less newstime, is "undo everything the black man did"

obama the king of drone bombings and deportations, your friendly superliberal
church is still to blame for suppressing galileo though
there were reasons besides the church to prefer the ptolemaic model over the copernican
I actually had a conversation this morning on another server whether the church gets too much credit for preserving the geocentric model of the universe, which I think it does
I saw but "overzealous" is a wiggle word that I don't think the left hits very often
apathetic members of society are the problem
we have like a 30% election turnout
If they're embedded making them upset doesn't matter
There's more to look at than right wingers
If making people angry was all that pushing hard for change did, I'd agree
I wish I was more of a historian because I've seen discussions about how 1930s germany had a major political party who argued something similar but I'm not educated enough to replicate that discussion here
But it's not a *mistake* to try to fight for it right now
The far right isn't going to change barring the occasional case of one of them having a gay daughter and realizing that *wow, they're actually people* instead of just disowning them
that is the real purpose of protests and actions and shit like putting gay characters in lead positions - though the last one also has a wonderful effect of lowering the suicide rate
the way to to change cultural opinion is through exposure and effort
The way to change things in an electoral system is to change cultural opinion
```I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice.```
because it's highly relevant
I think it's time to trod out the tired, worn out MLK quote
Facism in history has shown that the boot comes down completely and hard given enough time if you do nothing
it is not the *purpose*
Except it does, because making them angry is a *side effect* of the actual protests
I apologize if putting A and B together was too much
the discussion up to that point was that we shouldn't piss them off
"You should avoid creating content that centers, validates, and elevates oppressed people because it upsets the right wing" is perhaps the most distasteful opinion I've seen in today's discussion, for the record
so *demanding*, so *urgent*
people urged the black community to not be so *forceful*
This was a major problem in the civil rights movement
If they are already your enemy, making them hate you more is less relevant than rallying support to get in their way
maybe they'd hate you less, but they'd oppress you more effectively while doing it
maybe it does that, but it also does slow them down and stop their full blown strategies
And no, I object outright to "all fighting hard does is make your opposition hate you more"
I would be careful about using carolyandere in a conversation that literally is adjacent to the concept of genocide kerrik lmao
<@174440042289168384> here's a return question

Does someone have to be productive for their life to be valuable
through not having the opportunities others do
If you're 'dumb', or lack talents, or something else, there's a lot of people who legitimately think you deserve to suffer
it's absolutely oozing with ableism
I think that's the real sick part of where we are today
and everyone deserves a basic quality of life no matter how 'not-good' or *untalented* they are
not everyone gets to succeed, no matter how good or talented they are
There's a finite amount of opportunity in any given field
A couple hundred years ago it worked with almost exactly as much luck and exploitation of others as it does now
it's because you're shit and *deserve* it for not working harder
there's embedded social darwinism in american society that basically establishes that if you're poor, if you're sick, if you have bad teeth
That's really the underlying problem
as if it was a bad thing
I cannot recount the amount of times I've seen an american respond to some story about someone suriving cancer and not paying for it with some snide remark of "yeah, everyone else paid for it"
then it's glorified
unless it's being responsible for your society by killing other people
It's because US culture has this sick and twisted idea of individualism and how it's a bad thing to be responsible for your society
not the important ones
which are, in many ways
for presidential votes
actually it turns out I was wrong and we're actually near 60%, *hrm*
Low turnout has nothing to do with this election
As long as they stop before property destuction they're usually good
but anyway, hebrew and christian apocrypha are awesome
it has the power to basically delete something from existence because of course it does, which makes it probably the second most powerful thing to ever exist in SRW canon

The OC enemy faction's mechs are all named in hebrew
super robot wars alpha 3
my favorite videogame of all time pulls excessively from hebrew myth
especially all the shit he supposedly did that's not in the bible
solomon kicks ass
because we've elevated jobs that need academic degrees to some kind of weird pedastal

the person she's playing is a historical figure
it's worth noting
also
(there would still be a shitstorm, but I'd have preferred that)
Okay.
by casting a cis woman to play a trans man, you're contributing to the idea that trans people are *just acting to be the other gender*
Wien here's the problem
it would be easier to swallow
the white washing would be less bad at that point, yes
*you're asian all along* is the final twist
that's the plot twist
They still made her a japanese woman
Yorin
Just because her body is artificial is independant of that
once human
She's a cyborg
yes she does???
we're contesting her ability to be a good person
Also *no one here is contesting her ability to act*
She has culpability
She was willing to take the role
She signed on to play the part
No
I felt the 'plot twist' was really really bad
I disagree, considering she's just finished massacring Ghost in the Shell
yeah she's still shit
yay, a happy ending
You're absolutely valid, whatever you decide
yep
Is this a decision you made today?
no I can not say I have ever tried this
she clearly wasn't a fit and was put it in it to sell the piece
and also attractive white women should stop being the way to sell media
it's free promotion
It's all intentional marketing
you want to know what I think the real disgusting thing about this is
damn straight
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Good!
because they'd been told to let it burn

they were there
yeah, because the firefighters were in on it too
yeah
The power to not be racist is yours regardless of facial structure

saki this is serious discussion <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
I'm not foolish enough ~~yet~~ to pay 50 a year to use emotes
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
You mean you don't all have a tall glass of genderfluid to drink in the morning?
though you're going to have to make legal concessions somewhere
being a girl sometimes and a boy sometimes is valid too
You might also want to look into genderfluidity and some other concepts
100% valid and I support you
you and you alone get to decide what you are and how you present
Not being on HRT doesn't mean you're not a girl, or that you're a boy, or that you're a boy who has to do masculine things
I thought she was just drunk and commenting on your looks
??? I don't know
go further out than that
next week is too soon
As un-internet as possible, I guess
''''normal'''
try to seem as wholesome and normal as possible
I should probably get a haircut before then
Fine, but you might have to talk me down if they try to correct me
I'm bad at picking dates, but if you give me framework I'll try to make it happen
I was kind of worried about meeting your parents because I assume they'll go "oh, it's his fault," but honestly now I just want to watch your mother squirm when I call you Kriisa
what the fuck
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
They will either succeed or not succeed without you and that's not on you
When it comes to paid labor, don't let obligation to your employer override your misery

I should eat a cinnamon roll

I've only heard her once but she's adorbs
you should be less shy, your voice is cute and pretty, Alice
ü§î ü§î ü§î

I could use a 200% better boost
it is, in fact, legally not a part time job
30 hours a week is not small
kerrik's right, enabling saki-chan's gatcha addiction is criminal
saki's mom is blaming the internet for saki's transition so it's extra stupid
(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
wow she disabled your internet on purpose?
Your mom's being a bitch and you deserve better
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
what's your deadline
I'd like that
I wouldn't depend on federal law to keep you safe right now, to be frank
gonna be super bummed if I can't visit and/or camp with you though
if not, please remember to also research states' anti-discrimination laws and shit saki
I hope she changes her stupid mind
ughghg
what the hell
I'm not opposed to spending money to spend time with you
I'll think about it
She'll hardly be the first girl who had to find a new family after coming out
.<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Yes
I have been mad about this shit all damn night <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
so cases like this go under the radar
There's a lot we don't know because we typically only karyotype when a problem is suspected
human biology is fucked
they had completely normal SRY genes
the more I read this the more insane it gets
but it seems she might have directly passed it on in some way, meaning it's part of the family heritage
Unassisted fertility in an XY human female is uh, nearly undocumented
Pretty unknown, I think
also XY
oh, and the daughter she gave birth to?
None of this was known before she gave birth, the expression was pretty standard for a woman
Here's a case study of a woman who *gave birth* who was *mostly* XY, but was also X, with the tiniest amount of XX. It varied *by location.*
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2190741/
There was some discussion a few weeks back about how high school biology is the really simple version and XY = Male and XX = Female isn't really that simple
He's a good guy
which is, perhaps, an unfortunate fraction
3/5s
"who cares? it's just a discord" etc
I asked for receipts and the only thing I saw was "the discord server is run by a tr\****"
On the bright side, everyone else was like "who the fuck cares"
Just slurs
I had a look at it, it's not even name drops really
Someone always stabs someone else in the back
It seems like you'd hate it saki
I hate risk
California education was pretty big on "haha yeah we displaced all the natives and destroyed their culture oops"
Pretty sure
Slows you down, makes distractions less distracting
Opposite of an upper
Literally
Because its a depressant
I actually don't know how it works in the other direction
because as I said you really have to have an anti-androgen or you run into really nasty stuff like brittle bones or something
you'll probably be doing at least two a day
yeah
that can cause them to get dissolved by stomach acid faster than expected with some medicines
I don't know though
I don't think you chew the pills
I'm sure there's drawbacks of some sort
I have no idea on the details on that, I've only heard of one girl who does that
medicine goes in through your skin
uhh, they're like big adheasive things that you put on your skin
but I usually hear about my female friends taking pills
or patches that do the same thing, like you use to quit smoking
some people get implants that slowly release over time
usually but not always
that said you need to also take a testosterone suppressant or else bad things will happen
estridiol is frequently taken with pills, it's not actually estrogen but your body metabolizes it into estrogen
that sounds handy
ü§î
I wonder what it tastes like
ü§î
Is there an added penalty or is it just that you don't get to make progress
OTL
stay strong
YAY
Switch is covered by warranty but I was afraid the game store wouldn't allow me to transfer the profile/save to a new one
this is quite a relief
I've been actually hugely low-key stressing over this all day
status update: did not cry, it was *actually* a failed power adapter which I did not expect and thought this was a wasted 30 bucks
I think when I get home I'm going to plug in my new switch power adapter and then cry when I discover that's not the reason it's stopped charging
That sounds excellent
Doctors are frequently the single biggest gatekeeping obstacle for trans people and names get passed around of the ones who actually know their shit
They're not gods, and a lot of them have prejudices on top of that
A lot of doctors do not know the specifics of endocrinology, because it's not a very needed thing for a GP, and quite a few of them think they know things they don't
I have found that the average trans girl knows more about hormones than your average doctor so you might want to find an expert or do your own research
see an endocrinologist (if possible) if you want to know the fine details
both hormones are important to both sexual karyotypes
I don't have any close trans guy friends
I don't think they need to suppress estrogen, but if you have too much testosterone some of it will metabolize into estrogen, as I understand it
so I had to settle on 'child'
I actually struggled writing that because I refuse to misgender you even if I'm pretending to be them
0 effort on their part but they get to transform their feelings of "are we doing the wrong thing" into 'justified' "our child is moving out and building a life!!"
From where I'm sitting it's simple
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
And all the pictures would have been lost
I know girls
I mean
`You want to get your head bitten off?`
I'm super happy for you girl
wooooooooooow
I think so
general nutrition center <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"it'd be nice to be a girl because girls get to wear skirts" is sometimes a different answer than "it'd be nice to be a girl because being a girl is what I want"
I think jacq's answer shows that it isn't really about being a girl so much as it is bending social pressure around a certain thing in their life
I think it's complex here though
I find it a complex question which says a lot about me I guess
if that's what you feel you are, it's okay to be that
It's okay to be a boy who does feminine things
plenty realize in their 30s or 40s
extremely quickly and not that late
but the usual outcome is less "deciding I'm going to change" and more "deciding I'm sick of lying/pretending"
it's a possible expression of genderfluidity
I could see that being a valid, though extremely uncommon, decision
haha, she's no longer kicking her child out in disgust, isn't it *grand*, isn't she a *wonderful, nurturing mother*
This gives me twice the belief that your mom's redefining in her head, because apparently appearance is everything to her
what the fuck kind of performative crap is this
what.
it's a trans girl rite of passage
the something is 'ya'
„ÅÑ„ÇÑ„Åß„Åô
I will say no more
I might have a good birthday gift idea for Saki-chan now
*oh*
oh
30% more sock per sock
More or less. I have similar feelings, but not as intense, I guess
and not all of them are sexual
kinks are *way* complicated and some of them are really nuanced
It could be anything from kink to a repressed desire to redo everything to something else completely different
I think that's so potentially layered I can't unwrap that
yeah this sounds like a gender pressure thing rather than gender dysphoria
is that where you wait to become an adult
it's *probably fine*
yeah they told me
s1 chris had the best outfit
hahaha whoops forgot to pay my health insurance for 2 months
‚òÜ pantsu ‚òÜ
I'll think about it
hm
for me it's just a "it'd be nice I guess?" thing
the desire to do it is probably a bit stronger for you
it's the effort of doing a thing
It's not the pain I have a problem with
if getting rid of body hair was effortless I'd probably do it, would feel nice
there goes all surprise
damn
and ibu found the site
I was going to surprise you with the fact they existed
~~fuck~~
Considering it's made of fragments of <#336297840529899522> perhaps it's better we don't
She's allowed to compose a message, she's just not allowed to post it
Because nobody needs gibberish pop up when they're discussing suicidal impulses
She's not allowed to type in this channel
yeah
Please don't take my moderation requests as jokes because they aren't
this is still <#336297840529899522>
try not to get too silly
I get a pretty solid beard from like 2-3 weeks
I mean, not for the whole thing
more like assembly
like Panic Button does
you could look at teams that push the engines and adjust for hardware level interaction
you have pulled back the curtain and looked into the darkness
`if our 90k line 4 second subtitle bit doesn't run on your computer, get a better toaster`
getting fucking wolfenstein 2 to run on a glorified tablet
it's people like panic button that are the true wizards of the modern world
why not both? Boots for being classy and socks for being snugged
is it so clean you could eat off of it
alice is trying to convince me to wax
both are independant
Kink and sex are frequently linked but they're not the same thing
I think you mean it's not a sex thing
yeah it is
It's not, but I think part of that is the HRT
~~saki'd be cute in a collar though~~
Other trans girl stereotypes: They're catgirls. They're submissives. They want someone to put them in a collar.
hugely
yeah
that being spiro making you crave salt
pickles at least has a *reason* behind it
but all of the inside jokes make reference to the fact that "all trans girls are like this lmao"
I know quite a few trans girls who actually get imposter syndrome because they *don't* like thighhighs and they're *not* programmers
because even the jokes they tell in their own communities, by their own members, hurt people
Just be careful
Kriisa: "really, there were no clues or ways to know I was trans"
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
`technically non-binary last I heard`

you'll always be Saki-chan to me, sis <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Saki-chan's cute as fuck to say though and I'll never let that name go
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Her name is Kriisa
dragon knows
<#384870333620027403>
I know about 10 deadnames because of that and that knowledge will *die with me*
As an aside the paypal thing is *absolutely* true
I'm a cis male who loves girly shit, for example
But there's also a spectrum of other things you might be
We should talk more about it sometime, Ox, because you can be a trans girl who decides to never transition, but still be a trans girl
~~the name Alice gives you away as a trans girl~~
I think I used dragon's real name but you specifically said that you wanted to be Saki
I swing between a humanist and a nihilist and in either case I don't care
agnosticism*
oh right
you're not the only person I know there
There's a few, Kriisa, and yes, the prospective company is a major one
I'm actually seriously thinking about wisconsin and/or michigan as an eventual place to live now
and you're all adorable
you're all precious
orz
If you say you're a lesbian while dating a guy I'll defend your right to say it, because you're the author of your own sexuality
I will tear anyone apart here who tries to gold star sexualities in here
my girlfriend's a lesbian
it happens
it's somewhere near a 80% correlation in my experience
I just assume "totally huge lesbian" when I hear "trans girl"
I want to see stats for that
well, I'm not sure of GDP, but it's some economic measurement
California is #5 in the world
the united states is a beast
my state could be a soverign nation and still be richer than your country
the exact infrastructure Kerrik's giving us shit for not having
We're used to long drives because we have the freeways to make them possible
our freeway system is actually one hell of a publics work project
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>

~~I'm to the south of one end~~
Say she's paralyzed or otherwise medically challenged
ü§î
Kinks don't have to be sexual to be a kink
Huh, interesting
So it's like the innocence and helplesness of losing control that gets you?
Does it have to be the ice rink?
What about a girl slips on a rainy sidewalk
<@!173112001684439040> do you mind if I probe a bit
Go on
üçø
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
if someone has an ntr fetish you're not allowed to give them shit for it
That's a joke, by the way
~~except for ntr~~
at most you'll get ü§î from me

It's playing a game with every cheat code on.
When nothing you do has resistance, nothing you accomplish means anything.
I think so. I think a life with no conflict is going to be suffering in its own way.
Like, a prom dress and you have to go to prom like that
What about someone dressing you up in girl's clothing outside of skating or ballet
Sissification/forcefemming generally revolve around someone stripping you of qualities you secretly didn't want but feel that you're unable to divest of yourself
That's... still interesting though
Hm
OH
just being completely stripped of 'masculinity'
Though strictly speaking sissification doesn't have to involve becoming a girl
It's basically forcefemming
I'm guessing there's a desire to surrender control of a core aspect of self
especially since I saw a mention of diapers
bondage is selling it short
no, but the thing it's around usually is
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
oh wait I bought 2 because of wear and tear, that's why it was so much
but it was a little fancy
yeah I spent like 60 on a good daycollar
Like, 4 times, I've come `this` close to asking how many collars Lyssa's bought Alice
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>  Alice...
Like, you're dressing her because she's otherwise helpless
Does that add or subtract to it
yeah, exactly
I mean, considering a smaller girl holding your leash <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
and it can be hot
oh, it's quite possible
I mean there's more to it but that is a good fucking start
haha
it's not sfw
because uh
this is a conversation I asked to be moved from <#336297674707828747>
I mean if you find both really hot, I think maybe it's less about controlling someone else or being controlled as it is the exhibitionism and threat of public embarassment?

I could easily be wrong though and it could be both
it's a good scenario
which I mean
It sounds like you get off less on the direction of the power dynamic and more of the actual scenario
Yeah that sounds switchy
"This programming module is incompatible with this OS and it's going to be 60 hours of work to compensate" is different from "I have to choose between a healthy diet and education"
This doesn't mean all conflict is equal, and that X conflict is worth having around because it makes you stronger or some nonsense
yeah, family is a common one
longterm stealth is bad for mental health
stealth is where you are a girl and know you are a girl but pretend to be a boy for social convinience
just Kriisa jumping in and making her life be what she wants
0 time stealth
fuckinnnnnnnn
says the girl who speedran social transition
`And racing is unhealthy because slow is usually the best results`
I squirmed a bit
They do nice things to butts though
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
does this include heels
ASCOTS
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
yeah scrmz you have
so it's not the ultimate thrill
no it's a pond not an ocean
*dumps chemicals in the water*
I have some news but it's so much more fun to not just come out and say it
yes
too far away to be worth considering <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yes
for snuggles
I will prove that statement wrong <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've got one scheduled so I'll make do
damn a cuddle sounds fucking great right now
then they'll tell me
no
society will fill their ears about boys and girls enough as it is
just raise them as agender until they're ready to pick
They don't have to assume they're one to consider between the two
I disagree
considering not everyone is a boy or a girl
I'm not convinced it's necessary to have either boy or girl
but I think it's possible
it'll require a lot of work and explaining
I'm willing to fight society to give a boy or girl the childhood they should have
girls just aren't allowed to play with them because fuck girls I guess
most boy toys are actually gender neutral and are fucking awesome
I think if the kid likes hotwheels and dresses we can probe a bit and help them make a decision
iirc
instead of M or F
also oregon lets you put X for sex
they should have already made a, at least preliminary, choice
by the time they need to look at their own documents
they don't have to read their birth certificate
you can't escape gender associations but at least they can pick the gender
or, they'll pick for themselves which they'd like
right?
they'll just be drawn to the outfits and toys they like
do you? If they don't consider themselves a boy or a girl
wait till they pick for themselves
I kind of want to adopt and raise a kid and see how long you can do it without assigning gender
all girls deserve it
you deserve it
and I'm really glad you have
you've still had a privileged hatching, relatively speaking
As shit as that fucking shit is, Kriisa
`and she still does it anyway, fffffffffffff`
"I can take my mom deadnaming me" 3 days later "I told her, I couldn't take it"
Aw
Of course not, but I don't think anyone here is expecting a server convention
I don't think anyone here is taking it as a contractual promise jacq, I think you're fine
"oh they shit only 4 times a day"
What else are you going to talk about when the baby's first born, I guess
hard to do this beyond just the core family
yeah it's
I wanna stare
that carries the basic idea, yeah
boys should get to wear dresses
That's a fine alternative and should be people's fucking minimum
41
41% of trans people attempt suicide under the current way we do things
`idk I feel like that could cause more issues than being raised one
and wanting to transition to the other?`
hormones aren't needed until puberty no matter waht
if they wanted to swap several times during their growth that's fine
they wouldn't, and that's okay
there are ways to teach people about gender without immediately comparing it to them
you're a boy because you know you're not a girl
there you go
how do you know you're a boy
problem solved
and they'll know what they want to be
that's a big mood
`I used to have big dreams but now I crave nothing more than being normal`
I say you occupy useful and memorable roles as someone who helps people a lot with XDU and as Kanade's cheerleader, but I can kind of see you're not in a place of mind to be easily swayed
We would miss you
cute, feminine
Kriisa's voice is nice
is there a fucking curse on today or something
so hard
your mom's being shit
oh my god Kriisa I'm so sorry
fucking fucked up
your words make me violent
rather than put empathy ahead of it
your mom is a hedonist who cares about how her life is ordered
maybe she trusts my evaluation that it is cute and good like you should also trust it
I like your voice fuck dammit fuck your mom for being fucking wrong
it's not a good monday
also kind of shit
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I'm glad he knows sunshine in his life when he sees it
good
I hope he treats his sister right
good luck
you can get through it
I believe in you, Kriisa
It's still a reasonable excuse
do they know the position involves a new state
yeah, dead end here
Possessing someone else's personal identifying information is not a crime in and of itself.  It only rises to the level of identity theft if you use that information (1) in an unlawful manner under subdivision (a), or (2) with fraudulent intent under the remaining subdivisions.
california law seems to not give you any leverage to demand your papers if they don't actually do anything bad with it
Penal Code 530.5 subdivision (a) prohibits willfully obtaining another person's personal identifying information and using that information for any illegal purpose without that person's consent.  If you are charged under this section...but have not used the information for any unlawful purpose...you should be acquitted of identity theft.

If, for example, you obtained someone else's personal information but didn't actually use it...you originally planned on using it but ultimately decided not to...you haven't violated this law
though you can try birthdays
I do not think brute forcing it is an option
You're passing the line from "fan of culture" to "appropriating culture" at that point
I'm kind of against picking a japanese name *for obvious reasons*
It's like a tattoo for your name!
Or astronomy
Maybe make it aviation related!
Maybe base it off a profession you like
We'll have to workshop it sometime
They'd have to admit she exists first
But no, I don't think they'll miss Kriisa
they might miss the son that never actually existed <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I *knew* I should have confronted her
Fuck
Thank you?
good luck
also nice legs
zio it looks good
Melua's a really pretty name
I think I'd probably go with  roleplay character too if I was in that situation
lisa needs braces
Chris Zyxxix
~~Saturia~~
Anxiety is a frequent trigger for it
Same root thing
Do you ever click pens or buttons
As I said, it's a family of activities
It's what fidget spinners and fidget cubes were originally designed for
Stimming is a term used for a family of activities that some people, not limited to but particularly those on the autism spectrum, engage in. It involves pursuing tactile stimulation for it's own sake to help them think or just because they really enjoy it.
That might be less fetish and more stimming
Hahaha no kidding I am so out of gas my self
yeah same
Congrats scrmz and ibu, hope it works out
I'm not an expert though
There's nothing universal about that that I'm aware of
If you mean earplugs then wearing noise cancelling headphones and sunshades isn't uncommon
I'm not following the cognitive leap
Bright lights, multiple people talking at once, loud rooms
This includes more than haptic sensations
So I guess
Uh, a common quality of being on the autistic spectrum is a tendency to be overwhelmed with sensory stimulation
assuming kriisa's mom actually gives up and it's not just her being drunk this is probably for the best
And wrong just to remind you
The shit she said about your voice is disgusting
You had two major events in two days
Our lives do feel vaguely soap opera right now
Actually saki
Uh
I guarantee he's still on his wife's side and is just trying to feel less shit about it
Keep ignoring him Kriisa
Nevermind, uncongrats, hope it miserably fails
That's what I get for skimming
Oh
absolutely noted scrmz
Thank you for the self-awareness.
I'm very disappointed in this conversation. Here's what I'll say publically on it:

1. This is the <#336297840529899522> channel. This is meant for discussion. "I've lived there, I have a close perspective and here is what it is" is a valid comment and leads to discussion. "You don't live there, you don't know things" is both very possibly not true - it is possible to be educated without being there - and an attempt to shut someone down and out of the discussion. It also adds nothing to the discussion.

2. This is the <#336297840529899522> channel. Civility is highly preferred here.

3. ***NO SEXIST COMMENTS, SLIGHTS, OR DISMISSALS. EVER. ON ANY CHANNEL.***
Being sidetracked is fine but this isn't the channel for games
That can be the hard part sometimes
I honestly think you might need some self-introspection there because I don't think that should ever have been a reply you should have even *thought* of. Try *much, much* harder next time, please.
I don't think there's any way of interpreting bringing up her gender like that that isn't really fucking scummy
This channel is for discussion of serious topics, and starting them is fine, unless you're specifically trying to inflame something by doing so, which you were very far from attempting to do
You hanging in there Ry?
therapy can't help you if you aren't prepared to listen
now I could use it but I cannot afford it

while, mind you, pretending to be somewhat of a self-advocacy group
Their stance is that autism needs to be cured and it's basically run by people who are parents that are bitter that they have to take care of their kids
I'm just going to slip in a comment that you should never ever donate to autism speaks or anything that gives them money

Frustration at internal pressure to move forward that doesn't have an outlet? Feeling like your wheels are spinning in place?
1 year out of 17 feels new to me
But it's okay to be thrilled by who you are and what you do when it's all so new
Whether or not you're a pervert (it's hardly exclusive and it's not my business) I am completely convinced that you are in fact a girl and are in no way presenting for some cheap thrill
It's okay and valid to be trans and sexual

The point is they didn't sufficiently acknowledge that the post *is* harmful - this is a total non-stance presented as an apology
It underlines that it's a still a joke in their eyes
It's not self aware, it's just "gosh who knew you people would get upset"
The last line sours it really badly
Like they dressed it up pretty but it boiled down to that
The official twitter account made a "did you just assume our gender" joke and then they made a non-apology that boiled down to "sorry you got offended"
*sighs and crosses cyberpunk 2077 off their desired games list*
That is an... interesting dilemma
Sometimes it's fear of abandonment, or fear of being second best
sometimes it's possessiveness, sometimes it's fear of losing a planned future
Jealousy can be combatted by looking for the root causes and what they want out of a relationship
If it's just impossible, you flat out have to make a choice, it's not fair to put someone through that
You absolutely have to care about how they're feeling and do everything in your power to make them comfortable
Sometimes people can deal with it, sometimes it's a permanent barrier
Jealousy is a *natural* human reaction and you should never be mad at someone for feeling it
Jealousy
Let me bring the worst challenge up right off the bat
It's difficult
Polygamous means you're marrying more than one woman
Polyamorous, fyi
it's easy and common for someone in the array to claim they are but are not
As long as everyone is *actually* okay with it
Can you elaborate further on that

I hope that works for you

I'd argue you'd be going back to a shelter but not a home
I saw a post today that "home" is a place where you aren't misgendered or deadnamed
to the point where I will probably not be buying
It's less 'write off' and more 'drop down a lot in my priority list in where to spend my limited funds'
It's basically a strawman attack and a mockery all in one go
It's so weird to consider it AAA
I was really interested
They haven't permanently burned a bridge but they have extra work to do
But not good enough to make me a willing consumer
Good that they tried
It's a microaggression and pretending it's okay is how it gets cemented as okay and that's how people's lives slowly get ruined by pain of 1000 cuts
"People didn't like it" doesn't imply they were wrong to make the joke
I'd have vastly preferred that, but if they just mentioned why it was bad and said it wouldn't happen again I'd be content
You can also make more than one post
Which means, yes, you can do better
They doubled it last year

"I'm sorry we upset people" is not "I'm sorry we said that"
An actual apology
Considering it's 100% mocking a caricature of a group of people, a caricature that doesn't really exist
And honestly if you still find this brand of joke funny it says *things* about you
Also jokes can do real harm even if the *intent* is to be humorous because ultimately intent doesn't matter all that much when you're performing harm
Word for word
It was *literally* "did you just assume our gender"
For the record, no, but it shouldn't apply
...
That just sounds like you only take action if they're out to harm you, specifically, and don't mind giving your dollars otherwise even if someone else is harmed by the company or employees
I mean
Yes
It's not hard to form an opinion on games through trailers and demos then just not support the ones you don't think should be supported for various reasons
There are *so many games* out there that there are plenty that the game is good and the devs are not (publically) bad
I don't have time to play them all as is
Other games are fun
And further more, why separate the art from the artist when there are other good games who are made by people who don't find that joke funny
How do we know
It's just big enough for me to re-choose where my 60 bucks will go
This isn't the hugest deal
No "it doesn't reflect our values," no "we've made sure it won't happen again," just an "oops sorry you're mad"
It feels like preserving image rather than trying to make things right
It means they don't appear to act like what they did was *wrong*, just that people responded badly to it

I think it's possible to Agree to "I want a say on a final deal" and Disagree on "We need a say on the final deal"
There's two ways to read it, is all
"We need a say on the final deal" isn't so logically straightforward, because if you have strong opinions that it should never get that far, it would be correct to say "no, we don't, this is all bullshit"
That's not what the statement says though
because that's a possible part of brexit?
yes?
you think there shouldn't be a final deal
if you think brexit shouldn't happen

australia had a gun culture
like australia did

which they probably would
Making it a bureaucratic nightmare to get one won't work if someone sues and the supreme court says "lmao nope, that law's illegal"
the point is I don't think we'll ever get acceptable gun control while the tide of opinion is so that we *couldn't* change the amendment
It's going to be next to impossible for an actual solution before we can change the amendment

So do your best but be careful
Sounds like you're a little high on NRE which is good but might make you a little overconfident

NRE = new relationship energy
And remember that sometimes one of the best ways to do that is to break up early if you see her in pain
Good luck

I agree that it sounds like she's not really into it but wants to give it a shot to not completely give up on her dream

You do not owe toxic people your friendship
but he needs to find new ways to deal with them
I'm sure he has his own problems
So in a related way, yes, that was the reason
He was banned because he specifically stated that he enjoyed stirring up hate in communities, and stated this several times
also you can art which makes you automatically better than like, 30% of people out of the gate as a friend if you leverage it
I know some people who refuse to call unless there is direct and current threat to someone's health or life

Yeah, they wouldn't be as toxic if they were A) not made out to be competitive, with ladder points and stakes and B) not co-operative affairs
There's no reason to make both girls suffer when from what you said neither of them was into the idea and it was going to be a limited time relationship

if you have a community newspaper that might suffice
so some 1-person distribution probably is not going to be seen as a sign of attempted good faith
and you have to wrap it up with a court appointment
Lying to them about this if they press you means a permanent break from your family after you move out
You've probably realized it but I feel I have to mention it
I suggest no but do not know your circumstances
If you haven't decided yet whether you're going to lie to them or not if they ask you directly I'd start thinking about it
If they're a common element in your life they're either going to know or you're going to have to ditch the symbols because they'll start pressuring
you don't have to fight the panic response

these two girls are *very much* not your only future
And, it's worth stating
You're asking monogamous people to compromise with polyamory but you're unwilling to consider a future where you compromise to find a single partner?
Eh? What do you mean by that?
but it was a house of cards
You didn't make *serious* mistakes, I don't think, because you didn't really burn anyone's feelings too hard
But people can't do something they hate for another person's sake indefinitely, and if they can, it's very unhealthy, so it was an unstable condition and not something I think was a good idea to engineer given that one of them was a temporary relationship that was going to cut off as you transitioned anyway
That's *usually* a sign that they don't like it but are willing to entertain it for your sake, at first
You said that the girls were unsure about the concept
From what you said there were warning signs that you kind of ignored because you were on an emotional high
about long-term relationships end up being less about passionate love and more about mutual effort
I wish I could find that post I read out loud to you Kriisa

High school sweethearts being a permanent relationship is an exception, not a norm
Like, the kind of thing where you'll see people live together even when they're not 'dating'
platonic relationships can be a really deep friendship
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
because that's what abusers do
either the relationship breaks or you do, and you become a different person
You break, one way or another
Well, it might always become abusive, but there's no way to stop it if you aren't willing to push to improve it
It becomes abusive because you refuse to do anything to risk breaking it
I'm not sure what it is you think you need out of a relationship but I'm not sure it's healthy if you feel you need it this bad and friendships won't cut it
Neither is the thought that you have to "get someone"
It's okay to be single
I'm worried about your priorities in finding a date
You're pursuing relationships to make you happy and it's not even a secondary interest to you how your partner will feel, it's a tertiary concern
so yes, limited experience

Also weird rapey matriarchy overtones

"glass ceiling" came into use in the 80s to explain the phenomenon of women getting corporate jobs, getting promoted up the ladder, and then getting mysteriously stuck and passed over at a certain point
or idiom, rather
It'd be an effective metaphor if "glass ceiling" wasn't an established cultural metaphor I guess

yes

I tear at my nails but my transition has instantly let me try to grow it out
trans people is fine, yes
It's easier to deal with when your friends use the right pronouns and names and agree with you that you're not just a freak
It's why validation and respect are so important
and that quiet voice is still inside us
We have to be very loud about how much we like ourselves because we all grew up being taught to hate people like us
or being trans and not knowing you are
but it's way better than being trans and pretending you're not
being trans sucks ass
I have an interesting perspective because I thought I was cis for like 2 years of being deep in trans social circles
cis people are the origin of 95% of problems in our life so it's really easy to be mad at them as a group but it doesn't make them inherently trash
It's important to weed out the venting and complaining
It's important to realize that it's easy to overdiagnose though
this isn't feminism, this is a woman who makes powerplays
It depends if she was just venting to you or trying to tell you something
I'd suggest start stomping on your own fantasies, start thinking about how it's never going to happen and impossible, if you want to heal and be open to other relationships
sounds like a serious hangup
Generally going on dates when you're lovesick for someone else is a bad plan

There's also been an interesting side conversation going on how Kavanaugh's emotional breakdown has been framed as "Raw" and "strong" while if Ford had done it, it would have been "hysterics"
it won't affect anything
It's also worth noting he made an extremely partisan speech at Congress, while a sitting judge, which is straight up not allowed
make sure you take care of yourself too, emotionally supporting someone like this isn't just about them, you need to make sure you can bear the weight too
I bet
But I admire that you want to be there for her
It's not weak to cry and it doesn't disrespect her and if I were you I'd definitely need to vent
If you haven't cried yet, it's okay to cry
Oh, that's hard, I'm sorry
Oh, jeez

No I mean
well there you go
There's a backstory there of someone cheating through something clever
Interesting

that's interesting
studies that give real insightful results are typically borderline unethical or extremely unethical
progress is extremely slow in the field
psychological studies are always a mess and they always have to be repeated 8 times and get different results and then wrong conclusions get made
why the hell do you think psychology is so poorly understood
They're always criticized and they *always* have to be addressed that "this study isn't rigorous and insufficient to make a final conclusion on"
but at the same time, scientifically useless
Excuse me the sun is not fat it is thicc
If you don't party there's nothing special about night, its just harder to see

I've never thought that cheating was an even slightly acceptable strategy to get what I wanted, personally

Sometimes it's just caffeine doing that for me
scrmz you're a good guy and I have confidence that you can do what needs to be done for things in your life to turn out alright, whatever they might be
think about, realistically, how long it might take you to get a job, and think about what you're going to do in the worst case scenario if the money runs out first
start thinking about cellphones, insurance, car stuff if you've got one, start doing research on places to rent in your target area, travel costs
You asked earlier about 5000? You might be able to cut it shorter, but... I would start looking at the money per month you're probably going to have to spend if you're serious about planning this
*luckily* it turned out alright, which surprised me given her background
I was 100% ready to have to run away from home after coming out to my mother as trans
yeah I can really feel you
Is this in a literal sense or a community sense of having a non-prevailing opinion
Otherwise it sounds like a recipe for homelessness
I think 2000 is pushing it unless you can get employed immediately or bum off someone for a bit
The way votes and stuff have been turning out lately is part of why bigots and power abusers have started saying they feel persecuted and afraid
You get to have full part of whoever wins  even if you don't vote
yeah it wasn't exactly dragged out of him
I don't have an opinion on destroying his career or not, I just know that I have no interest in adding to his success in the future
The thing I hate most about this is he's trying to avoid the work, trying to brush it off as something that's fine to say when you're mad
I agree that everyone makes mistakes and you should be able to recover from them with work
I agree
it's the exact same logic as trying to defend saying the n-word during a "heated gamer moment"
I just want to express that no you can not be bullied into saying what he said, and no, being in an argument doesn't make it okay to say

If the premise is that Sarkeesian wants attention why would you make or link a video about her

If they're really sorry about doing harm they look to do good
I generally wait until they make a public statement overturning their previous views and/or do some suitable charity gesture
It's a 3.5 out of 10, pretty formulaic "I got caught in something not minor" apology from a guy with influence 

It's not necessarily insincere but I've seen it lots before
That might actually be partially personal prejudices speaking because usually "fake news" is aimed at the facebook crowd
the general public
They actually put out a report a few weeks ago that pointed at one of the worst-case forecasts of global warming and said "hey look, it's too late anyway, let's repeal more regulations"
The weakness of a democracy or a republic has always been enacting rapid, needed shifts in policy
The sentiment is appreciated though
Sincerity aside, there's a strong element of "it'll all work out in the end" to the phrase that I feel isn't really appropriate
Fine points, but you'll excuse me if I think "better late than never" to be a little too blas√© for my tastes
I can expect job opportunities and every day interactions to go much differently
Same with the quality of life drop
It's not the hormones that are responsible for that, exactly
I'm starting so late I have to seriously evaluate whether the improvement I get in feeling like myself is worth reducing my life expectancy and quality of life by a sharp margin while still not getting what I want, because I will have to expect to be very visibly trans for probably the rest of my life
I'll turn 30 next year
Rakhi don't take this too hard but I'm not really sure you're thinking through this hard enough to say that
I feel like my body isn't the worst starting point but I'm just doing this way too late

Funding can get cut to people who don't comply etc

Yes, the administration doesn't have the power to change laws
This is less him directly and more the hatred that he's placed in senior administration positions
It's going to lead to me being unwilling to even visit like 60% of US states, probably

Good for her!
Title IX is the anti-discrimination law, in general, so whenever you see news about tinkering with it it means the government is adjusting how much they protect people from getting shit on because of X factor
but that means there's places in the US where it's increasingly unsafe for people like me to live
Yeah, they shouldn't have the ability to strip state protections
It's fun and sometimes accurate to assume that the administration is full of bumbling fools but you shouldn't ever let that lull you into thinking you can trap or outmaneuver them in a gotcha moment
Try to not assume they're incompetent at this, because there are some smart people on the team who are determined to do harm
reread it closer

No I think you actually need state government input on one of the methods
I think you need 3/4 states to ratify
Actually I think it's 3/4s?
You're thinking of electoral college now
It's not easy
You essentially need 2/3 of the entire country to agree on the change

Yeah, don't count on them to save us, and there are cases where the Republican candidate will do more for you than a democratic one, especially in more local political circles
There's a reason Sanders didn't win the primary
The core party is all old money and isn't really good people
The only policy the Democratic party (not a candidate) has ran on that has ever been not shit is "we're not republicans"
I don't like phrasing it that way because it implies the Democratic party is better
The second amendment was obsolete as of WWI
And there's not much we can do in the worst case, because to loop this conversation around

Judicial branch
Which is why it's very important what justices get appointed
They can also smack down a state's power to protect people
It's up to them to decide who they'd rather form the core of a community. Personally, I think that you're best off focusing on the group that demonstrates they actually care about others.
You either make a place comfortable for people who like using slurs or make a place comfortable for people who don't
It's a decision they make without possibly knowing they're making it

Particularly since courts have ruled that ToS are not legally binding contracts
I actually don't think that Discord's ToS thing that you can't sue them will hold up in court
Sorry to hear that
I'm not even going to touch that, but there's not a lot of legal rights that conscription conflicts with
I don't have any real opinions on the draft except that it's a policy with a lot of downsides and there's a reason it hasn't been used in like 50 years
I think the bottom line, though, is that though there *are* examples where free speech should be curtailed, criticism of government policies by a civilian should not ever be outlawed, as at that point you're running up right into the soul of why that amendment exists
and *that's* a dangerous point
however, applying that chain of logic requires human intervention and it's up to humans to decide what is a threat and what isn't
The argument kind of makes itself - national defense is the paramount duty of the nation, because if the state fails to protect itself, it will fail in every other duty and be unable to give any rights to its citizens
National defense and national security have always been a sticking point in the constitution, honestly

sometimes you need to know that you matter
seeking attention isn't inherently bad as long as you're careful and mindful about it
That's literally the reasoning
Because you're already getting subsidized all over the place with government money

Can I interrupt and say that I really don't like the mentality that "taking meds is never good"? That seems like an unnecessary way to shit on people who need it, and their lives are universally improved by it. They don't work for everyone, but please don't make people feel that they're doing something bad by taking them.

The bottom line is that the texts pretty explicitly rule out sodomy as ungodly, yet people have to try to reconcile that with trying to not look like hateful bigots to a huge part of the population, so they reside in "it's fine to feel gay things, but the Lord says not to do gay things"
It's a common conclusion I see a lot of judeochristian groups come to
There's no scientific evidence for if they were born nasty or if it was learned behavior

Letting material accomplishments and possessions define who you are is generally bad long term
Another thing to watch out for is defining yourself by your collection
If you're emotionally invested in protecting it it might border on unhealthy
The real test is how much you'll be hurt if it's deleted or lost
Then yes, at that point it is unhealthy
If you just stare at it and let it trigger your dysphoria
It's not healthy but it's not, by default, unhealthy

Also I fully support passing bills to be harder and less likely to happen than not passing them
*at least we elected them*
I mean if the entire legislative body wants to ignore a bill that's fine
but I'd rather have them than have a house of lords <:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
these are all valid critcisims
you won't get any more cases of someone like McCain tripping up a party line vote

humanity has never not been civilized, and will always be

what are we defining as the us government
People shouldn't care if it's removed
It's a battle royale game
Having it in the game makes people feel like shit and objects when they see it, while removing it means... I guess others have to actually find good sex shit to jack it to?
Pubg is a realistic survival shooter royale thing, how does the emphasis on genitals do anything for the package
Why not remove it

As cool as it sounds you really don't want a space division

Marxist communism technically doesn't have a government
You point it at a different spot, intentional or not, and people die
The ban covers it for a reason
I don't trust anyone with microwave power transmission right now, honestly
<@106861977086779392> directed energy weapons in space are also banned, even for peaceful applications

It's what's probably the biggest barrier for space-based power generation
Honestly I think if you're planning past 5 years right now you're putting the energy in the wrong spot
Do you have a plan b? Having a backup might make the exams less stressing and might help you do better
Yeah you'll need an exit strategy

relationships are challenging but very fulfilling
It can be really draining to deal with it but even though it feels like you're talking to a wall, you're not
Just because they spin what you say into a negative doesn't mean they don't hear your points

And legislature in several states specifically permitting that
I'm not really sure your point here, being fired for being violent is a different thing than being fired for having extreme opinions
I think generally companies can terminate you if you're convicted of a crime
"I think rich people should have their money taken away from them" is a whole different league from "the white race is superior and must be preserved"
or anything comparable
extreme left supporters aren't advocating for genocide or expelling people because they're not white
which I mean, good
I know people get fired when they get identified in neo nazi rallies in the us sometimes
Obviously they can't, yes
"except in cases of impeachment" could easily be read and interpreted as the office can't pardon anyone impeached
he can't pardon someone charged with crimes according to a state law
One of the major caveats I mentioned is that the office only has power over federal law
First clause of article 2
```The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.```
There's some caveats, but yes - as long as he's not impeached
You got turned down, it was a soft rejection, but you really should wait several months before asking her out on dates
that's fair, as long as you're gentle
it was good that you asked
so why give them shit over it
Because it doesn't hurt anyone and it makes them feel better to do it
in this case, sparkle's choice to use the third person
a written quirk
Just kind of shove it out of your mind until then
My advice is to stop planning it
Okay
since y'all aren't even actually voting for anything and are just having a formalized collection of opinion
especially, mind you
thus, if there's reason to believe beliefs have changed, it is worth a revote because if it's markedly different *it tells you something*
you'll get three almost identical results
you hold three votes in a row, if beliefs haven't changed
Then it's not a reroll
Then why are you playing devil's advocate by bringing up a point you know is bullshit
If you hold three votes in a row
*voting is a non-random process*
Like the argument of rolling until you get what you want is a ridiculous one
You are agreeing with it by giving the argument credibility and calling it a "genuine argument"
not one of the past
I think it's imperative that a nation's policy follow the *current* mandate of the people
If the referendum had taken 6 months later it would have had the opposite result, just by virtue of old people dying and others hitting voting age
He seriously needs to rethink things if he wants to take a huge vacay

Is this the first time he's talked about suicide

Realistically this is probably near the extent you can do
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Those types end up in serious hundred thousand+ debt trying to make fantasy reality
Because it sounds like he's the type who planned out his life and won't take a hit to something lesser
Maybe consider withdrawing your invitation to go to evo with him out of concern for his life
It sounds like you do need to talk to him
Not just peasants
Find out that *normal goddamn people* work those jobs
Also the fact that labor is "beneath him" is exactly why he should do it
Is he a trust fund kid
There is honestly not a third option where you stay there and they magically respect you
If this doesn't appeal to you, I'd suggest swallowing your parents' bullshit and nod and take it until you can get out
college is a little overrated for a lot of valid life paths
I'm not being sarcastic, this is a real choice
You could consider trying to move out, abandon college for now, hotbed with someone for a few months, try to find a job, and find a place to live on your own and establish it
Them hearing you is more important than their protests
if they snap back at you, just... take it
Being kind of quiet and just letting them know how much they mean to you and that you're glad they're in your life is okay
I'm pretty angry at them treating you like that
You applied for a kitchen job at a sushi place with a fish allergy?
I've seen a lot of that kind of "so what" attitude from friends
Telling a trans person who grew up through dysphoria and other stuff that something might kill them in 15 years is frequently going to be met with a blank look
Also liver health tends to go down
It's funny, most trans people I know would agree that saving your life in your 50s is a nice *side* effect, because they're generally taking them to save their life a lot earlier
HRT is prescribed for a lot of health conditions, actually, though the doses and desired hormones aren't always similar to transitioning doses
This was a super rare case, or so we currently think
It usually leaves you sterile though
Sometimes you get a "normal" type but something goes wrong and the genes aren't expressed right
There was a case a few years ago where a woman who just gave birth found out she was XY
Genetical or Chromosomal sex is something we usually avoid because, honestly, most people haven't had their chromosomes checked
If you're asking whether an AMAB (assigned male at birth) trans woman still needs checks for prostate cancer the answer is yes though
Surgical procedures also have an impact - it's harder to get testicular cancer when you no longer have testicles - but also it affects the body's hormonal balance as well so that can help or harm in several ways
It actually does improve a number of issues for men and women
HRT wasn't actually invented for trans people, it was applied to us because the side effects were what we want
I think hormone therapy treatment, where you take pills to alter your internal chemistry, does impact this stuff
Can we clarify which treatment
*explicitly*
Signing the contract is only a problem if "handles fish regularly" is explicitly in the job description and requirements

So technically, if there was a complete shutdown, my friend would have to work on Christmas as it would no longer be a federal holiday
But contractors still are contracted until the contract expires
So under a complete shutdown most federal employees obviously don't come in, holiday or not
Yeah it doesn't apply here but let me finish
However, in the event of a complete shut down, *there is no such thing as a federal holiday*
So do federal contractors
Now, federal employees get federal holidays off
A friend of mine is a contractor for the government

Nothing about the concept of a singularity threatens humanity, only their role as a dominant intellect
It's called the singularity because it's hypothesized to be exponential growth to something like an asymptote
This results in a developmental explosion humans can't keep up with and can no longer understand their creations
The singularity is when machines can design better versions of themselves in a repeatable loop

it's not related to her getting harassed, which is what this discussion is about
And I'm saying that bringing all this up isn't doing anything but poisoning her request for advice or help
there's no such thing as justified harassment
It doesn't matter, because even aside from the fact I don't agree with that logic train, it's *completely  irrelevant* to the fact that she's getting harassed
I think levelling the accusation at her that she has or had a hostile agenda doesn't belong in this conversation and prevents this conversation from being constructive or helpful.

I generally assume they're either impaired or having automotive troubles and are taking the safest option
B was a hazard, but all of that is on A's head
I *do not* condone transferring blame to someone else because they made the first person "impatient"
And
yeah A is still the most culpable here
a reason
A lot of people who are driving slow frequently have like

because cops can just ticket you for hazardous/dangerous driving
slow driving, even without posted minimum speed limits, can get you a ticket in the US
but from there it should be pretty good
yeah importing things *through* england might be bad going forward
maybe I should buy some Elite dangerous skins, actually
If anyone wants to import something from england now might be the time
not all of them
uh
Even then, what does the word *literally mean*
Because that's a lot of why the use of the word is a problem, not the *direction* the word is being shoved in
Yeah can we back up here and discuss the origin of the word
https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/21/national/social-issues/school-uniforms-go-unisex-japanese-schools-seek-better-fit-lgbt-students/
but as I said, Japan *is* changing a lot faster than most weebs give it credit
To use your example, lesbian porn was popular in US for *long* before people supported gay marriage
I don't think you can hold it up as a symbol of sexual freedom in japan, is all
just... a lot
I mean this isn't a blanket condemnation of everything that falls in the genre
haha
it's... not representation
And that's the problem
Are you going to tell me that's not fetishized?
Yaoi? Yuri? *generally marketed towards and consumed by people who aren't homosexual*
because
I disagree that there's no difference than using attractive people, it's not "sex sells", it's actually marketing homosexuality as a fetish half the time
it's literally using homosexuality as a marketable product
also yuri and yaoi are typically not good gay representation
there's several news articles every year about new ground being broken
japan's in the middle of a gender and sexuality revolution, same as most places
If you know specifically someone's trans there are better terms but it's a decent umbrella
(japan has other ones for that)
it's not a fetish term
it doesn't make assumptions about *why* you're doing it
Josou is good yeah, it literally translates to "wearing woman"
crossdressing, trans, GNC
There's several perfectly good terms for several groups of people that are all less mired in bad history than trap
Never reverted from yesterday
oh sorry
Another problem is that even if it *didn't* originate from the idea that you can be "tricked" into being gay (it originates from exactly this), the term's so filthy deep in fetish connotations that even just casually calling a character in it degrades them - Bridget (lol dated reference) wasn't doing it for a kink, neither was Astolfo, but that's the general context of the word
I've seen exactly two - three if you count Ferris, which you shouldn't, because that was a retcon
Kriisa's being generous, I've seen her rock a nice dress
Australia has some far right elements that are possibly worse than america, and they're definitely worse when it comes to handling some LGBT issues

False empathy - they think there's equivalence to their own life and they can judge and make calls based on that, and that just because they're not in a position to *need* surgery and thousands of dollars in care, someone else isn't either
but yeah I was mostly just checking for sarcasm
I apologize for being a little jocular there
very depressing style
yeah, I don't really expect anyone to follow international news and watch for every bad article to keep track of everyone's sins
Sometimes if the only road you can see ends up driving into a brick wall, you have to go off road
I was honestly talking about 5-10 years later by "later in your life"
if you do not think you can focus on your studies due to dysphoria-related stress, and you cannot address that while studying, you might have to take courses later in your life when you can sort that out rather than wasting 4 years of your life
Something to consider, honestly
Sometimes you have to abandon one of your goals, or at least for a while, to take care of other things, and for that you just need resolve to not give up
And it's hard, and it's painful, and it hurts a little or a lot every day, but I still look back at the decisions I made to arrive at that point and it helps that I wouldn't have changed any of those decisions
I've had to put my own transition off for what's probably going to be a total of a year to address more important things
Have you considered dropping out and finding a different path?
I'd start looking at what you can do to be socially and financially independent of your family
And yeah I really don't have time to argue with "lmao why vote" apathy today
Most kids do just follow how they're raised, but critical thought vs tribalism *before* 18 is so nonexistent anyway
Probably one of the biggest reasons to not lower the voting age really
that happens a lot at that age frame

why do you refer to a woman as "a female" out of curiosity
at least, she doesn't see it as "hers"

yeah
and that she did not really want this prominence whatsoever
"the lead"
so she's important but not

If you're right wing you don't care that much about *not* being racist
I'm sorry your feelings are hurt
The fact that there were non-racist reasons to vote leave doesn't make brexit *not* about racism, considering the leave campaign leaned very heavily on racist imagery to win
I'm glad you were able to come out
this typically translates to "I can't ever afford the care I need, I'll never be happy with my life, I'll never manage to face myself in a mirror, I should just actually kill myself" for the record
Heavy stuff
~~I find the columnists at ann pretty decent actually~~
It's not called fanservice for nothing
I don't know, I feel like your point is just kind of weak, especially since nudity in anime *is* generally ecchi and designed to fill a similar niche to softcore porn or the swimsuit issues of SI
"everyone" is also just a vague punching bag here
I mean the west has been bothered by nudity in anime since at least the very early 90s, this isn't a 2019 thing
Also I've never seen anyone connect changing room scenes with rape and is there any reason you decided to bring it up
but that's my opinion
Anyway I think japan's too lax about portrayed sexuality and the west is too strict, and I don't think one should be lauded while the other is mocked
no FeMC has been confirmed and she seems to just be a new character
I've heard from like 10 people she's not the FeMC
there's now too much competition and licensing fees are rising because they're worth more

I always get the two confused
Or is it battery?
Touching someone without consent is legally assault

you know
that's true according to
actually
I wasn't ever aware of ANN themselves ever fabricating anything
it might be *someone else* falsifying
That aside, reporting on information that's later cast into doubt isn't falsifying
I'm not aware that ANN did any of these things
yeah, okay
you mean the vic situation which was totally actually worth reporting and had quite a bit of credibility at the time?
since when is ann "twisted for clickbaits"
the commercialization of female characters is actually largely why so much anime is bad right now
*the hot glue crowd*
ann that is
they're typically people with experience of being immersed in japan and have a more jaded view of east vs west
Nepalutune I think you're actually going into dangerous territory here and I'm going to ask you to not descend into continued points used to discredit sexual assault survivors - you've been proceeding down them like clockwork
"Very nice and kind" are actually red flags for someone whose job puts them into physical proximity with adoring preteen girls
*everyone* knows Vic's a creeplord at cons
these VAs have spent time around vic at cons and shit
Mind you
honestly my take on it is that he's displayed behavior in the past that should get him barred from any decent convention anyway because the reports span almost 20 years now
"not clickbait"
what the hell is this then

I'm going to guess you're kinda young but the Bluray vs HD-DVD fight was big news in the industry back then
documented
it's
really?
as mentioned before
the *real* reason it did well is because of the bluray player
like
because it had shit like god of war
niche doesn't carry a system worldwide, yeah
you could pay 2k usd for a bluray or get the same exact components in a ps3 for 600
especially early on PS3 was way overspecced
PS3 was carried because it was a bluray player
nah
that's a profit since porting costs so little
and even if they sell 1000 copies ever
because they're easy to put on PSN
uh
also a huge amount of these are remakes and ports
even *slightly*
and not big sellers
for the record
most of these are niche
it was the only thing that really drove vita sales for a long time tbh
that was vita
again, p4g
or gundam vs extreme
since when is p4g ps4
~~where I lived no one even had 720p tvs~~
if everyone already had blurays at ps3 launch you must be affluent
also responsible for a bunch of sales
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_cluster
it was an affordable DVD player when they weren't cheap
for the record this is also how the PS2 did well early launch
people bought it so they could watch Spiderman in HD
but at launch the PS3 sucked shit
like yeah, there were some gamers.... some
*people in NA bought it for the blurays*
I was *there*
but
I don't know how old you are
Zerona
it just sucked at it
360 tried to do it too
I mean
*Games did not save the PS3*
they bought it to play movies
but people didn't buy it to play games
yeah
it was *half as expensive as the next thing out there* for a bluray player
it was expensive for a game console
was a *bargain*
the 600 dollar PS3
Zerona
and the 600 dollar PS3, as expensive as it seems
and then people needed bluray players
and they basically won the format war through that
Sony picked up a bunch of really hot exclusivity deals with movie publishers
Again, the bluray player was what made it not flop early in its life
lifetime sales

PS3 didn't flop
they made great distrubuted computing clusters
I knew several people who bought PS3 just for the *processor*

It means telling someone they're wrong and nothing's going on when they're right and things are totally going on, making them doubt themselves and disbelieve their own observations and reasoning leading to mental instability
there's also a small side drama going on about peanutbuttergaming telling projared's wife "this ain't it chief" when she throws light on everything
Projared blocked his wife and posted a statement saying he was getting a divorce and then his wife tweeted out how he'd been cheating and gaslighting her for a year or two

He only radicalized starting maybe 3 or 4 years ago
He wasnt a shitbag when he made Minecraft
Notch once wrote several paragraphs about how Steve? was supposed to be a non-binary representation of the player or something, the shift to the right is really disturbing
Markus is referring to notch, his real name
The former is supposed to be the inventor of Tetris and the latter makes me actively wince now, since he's changed so much
An indie game I've been replaying features a young girl inventor who was mentored by a duo of Alexei and Markus, it was made years and years ago
I just know there was something problematic and also some big beauty youtuber make a 45 minute video explaining why she's no longer friends with him
I don't know much about the second part
yeah
lemme see if I can find it
uhh
desensitizing happens
It's a fine word to use, you're just so used to hearing it with a connotation your brain isn't treating it as its literal definition anymore
which, if you're not aware, is pretty openly the neo nazi front news page
Ironically one of the best articles about how that translates to aligning with white supremacy comes from, uh, the daily stormer
he then made an encore discrediting the idea of privilege
https://twitter.com/notch/status/936215345400033280
it's law, everything has to be defined
```In general, a child for the citizenship and naturalization provisions is an unmarried person under 21 years of age who is:

The genetic, legitimated, [5] or adopted son or daughter of a U.S. citizen; or 

The son or daughter of a non-genetic gestational U.S. citizen mother who is recognized by the relevant jurisdiction as the child‚Äôs legal parent.```
by being someone else's child
ah here it is
In addition to meeting the definition of a child, the child must also meet the particular requirements of the specific citizenship or naturalization provision, which may include references to birth in wedlock or out of wedlock, and which may require that certain conditions be met by 18 years of age, instead of 21. [8] ‚Äã
I haven't been able to find the fine print in the US code but nothing in the US citizenship and immigration service's webpage mentions having to be married at all
yeah this seems to be less that they have legal ground and more that they're doing a bureacratic paperwork dance
I don't think you can hold that belief without believing that poor people deserve to die because they deserve to be poor
those kinds of people are pretty insufferable
sounds like someone I knew a month ago but will hopefully never hear from again
you're not alive when you're lying to yourself about who you are

this article doesn't matter
only a few states but if you're born in a state
legally they're not enby, most likely
And even entire political parties who are basically neo nazi light
Except the difference is, now there's movements that are virtually the same thing, just who don't openly put the word "nazi" in their name
10, 15 years ago "neo nazi" was a joke concept, a fringe lunatic
I don't think it's overselling it
they're saying it can be permitted to exist *anywhere in the world* because the CIA won't be there to engineer a coup
they're not saying communism can exist in america
the forestry service works okay
I think more of it is that the laws will not probably not be overturned, though if the Senate passes the equality act this one at least has a good chance of failing
trying to get the most outlandish bill you can to be passed is going to result in the supreme court, even if they lean conservative, to draw lines
interestingly I think some of them are going to backfire
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau ask this dude, he literally wrote the book on it
the willingness to get arrested for protesting
part of civil disobedience
but that is
throwing foodstuff is assault and the guy got arrested for it
<:no:260447352295260160> I refuse to sign on to that as a slogan
this is what generally makes mild civil disobedience actually effective - the inability to stop it without going too far and pissing off unrelated people
politician number 6 to get milkshaked recently
yeah this is like
there was a political rally the other day and the police asked McDonalds to not sell milkshakes or ice cream at a nearby location for a day and McDonalds complied
unless this is brand new, no
A+
```Nigel Farage hit by a milkshake in Newcastle city centre. He‚Äôs furious. Telling his security ‚Äúit‚Äôs a failure‚Äù and ‚Äúhow did that happen‚Äù. ```
also
at least some of them probably feel like it's a states rights thing, and while that means they don't consider this equality act a top priority, it's a little different than "I WANT TO DO THAT"
I want to butt in here because I feel that's an unfair distinction
`And I'd also like to say that 173 people in the house of reps want to be able to discriminate against women and trans people!`
I am a fan of this milkshake thing as a form of mild civil disobedience

I actually think this is good, it makes Nigel look pathetic
And you can always shut opponents down by slutshaming as an added bonus to many of them
That's it
And this allows them to feel good without having to go through the effort of actually being a good Christian
Christians get up in arms to defend the unborn because it's the one group they never have to communicate with and treat as people
There was a really interesting quote I saw from a pastor the other day
there's a mental health cost to never having a single luxury
I don't think everyone can
some can
I also love the take that one can cut every luxury out of their life and, uh, not die
it's not easy to learn to be nice, but that doesn't make it not something they should be doing
it's possible
there's plenty of abuse survivors who don't chain it out into harming others around them
but at the same time
I think that having context of why someone is the way they are can change how you approach them - and it makes it easier to not *hate* someone for being an ass
trauma and disabilities can make it more difficult to learn to be "nice" but it doesn't give you a pass to not try
Nope. It can be important to understand when trying to deal with someone close to you who is one, but everyone has a duty to try to care about others imo
does any other country have some weird voting day tradition like that

it also tends to not get all the images

that are important
historians are actually kind of freaking out over the internet because millions of pieces of data are being lost all the time
it is possible to hide and remove content if you're careful
that said the internet isn't as all pervasive and permanent as people make it out to be

because it's "somewhere"
it's what you said, but the whole "BUT ITS THE INTERNET" comment made it feel like it wasn't a big deal if they did
"it's always going to exist" is different from "professional websites should catalog your personal struggles and traumas unrelated to work" yorin

<@284390402210136064> do you mind not posting suicide coded images, particularly in the serious discussion channel?
at worst, you become mildly controversial, and in marketing, the only form of bad news is no news
It's lip service for good optics without having to ever actually make a stand
regardless of what the actual topic being discussed is
however, they continue to pretty much automatically demonetize any video that discusses transgender issues as not being "Advertiser friendly"
here's their current twitter page
Youtube is a prime example of this
the other is to make a bunch of LGBT paraphernalia to sell at pride events as a new market of consumers to exploit
one is the meaningless rebranding to be rainbow themed while not actually changing policies to be LGBT inclusive, as a marketing technique to get LGBT people to like you more and buy more from you
it comes in two varieties
youtube's rainbow twitter icon makes me choke with rage every time I see it
particularly in this channel, where people may feel like opening up about traumas
please don't use trigger as a synonym for upset
there's talk of them being banned from dublin pride, which is particularly fun, as that's their HQ location
I haven't double checked it as true though
Uh
the issue's probably the pointing of a gun at the presumed recipient
but it doesn't make you a good person
you can keep stepping on their foot and ignore them
sure
while it can absolutely be taken too far, someone telling you you're being offensive is the emotional equivalent version of someone telling you they're being physically harmed by an activity you're doing - like stepping on their foot
I just read the stephen fry quote on being offended and I'm going to firmly say he's a twat for saying it
there are situations that are not covered by the first amendment
it's the old crying fire in a theater argument
the government *can* arrest you over things you say
it's also worth noting that
I do not know the UK's articles on preserving the right to free speech
equal-air time was a political candidate thing, the fairness doctrine was just that media had a responsibility to present both sides, which the government's gone back on
oh whoops, mixed them up
not only is it not, but the FCC pulled the plug on it 3 decades ago
a lot of people think that the fairness doctrine - the policy that both sides need equal airtime - is part of free speech
it does not entitle you to any other right to be heard
freedom of speech means the government cannot step in to muffle someone
Luckily brexit will take 4 more years at this rate
For UK in particular
I mean no trade deals with eu or America and you're kind of screwed

you were once you moved from the possibility of it being a typo - legitimate - to saying that's exactly what happened
*It is not your place to handwave away someone else's behavior before they have a chance to explain*
that's completely fine and things happen
it's completely possible it's a typo
I am absolutely going to hardline this because this channel, specifically, is a spot where people need to be able to talk without worrying about people meming about the state of being "triggered"

astolfo is a GNC boy, best I can figure

what do you mean why
don't use it?
which is both awful in terms of what it means for gay people and trans people so
It started as a meme on 4chan in 2007, about characters who "tricked/trapped you into being gay"
if a penis makes you recoil in disgust and horror, it's not that it's a flavor you don't like, that's *way deeper shit you've got going on, man*
"oh this cute person has a penis, I can't be gay, I have to kill them so no one thinks I'm gay" HAS LITERALLY HAPPENED DOZENS OF TIMES
That's literally the reaction that gets my fucking sisters killed so don't you dare fucking brush it under the rug as "normal" and something that's okay to bake into terminology
that's literally it
gay panic
that's
Yes
I am also glad a lot of <@!102691114762371072> 's clothes are open
again, the word trap stems from "tricking you into being gay" - even if you can somehow argue it's not being disrepsectful to trans or non-binary people in an instance, you're still pulling at the same string as the gay panic defenses
or, if it's really just the womb you're after, AFAB - trans men can still have babies

~~it's a turn on~~
that's the opposite of "care about not hurting people"
You seemed to be intent on your right to assign labels to people without regard for how they make people feel, and only care because we have the power to kick you
and insisting on the first
You're very keen on ignoring the second
"it's best if we cared about not hurting others"
than "it's best if you weren't hurt"
better
you know what's
"A bad person could do a good thing" is *not a justification* for a good person to do a bad thing
people have shown a lot of examples where pokemon animations are extremely short cycles and attacks are slightly bumping the model forward
"we wanted to spend all our time on high quality animations"

The removal of the gimmicks of previous generations, and, above all, the fact you can't collect them all
I have heard some people say they might skip this generation
and that might also worry investors
in a negative direction
Pokemon's taking some steps it's never taken before
but march 20, 2020 is definitely not 2019
nothing more concrete
2019
but no, it's a giant unrealistically huge erect penis
I would have been actually happy to see just a normal bulge tbh, not shaming that kind of thing
which ruins the versimilitude they were trying to go for
for the ad imo the problem isn't the fact they're using someone trans as a corporate marketing technique (suitably dystopian) but the fact they have a ridiculous fetishy foot-long dick
your spokesperson is *a spokesperson* who represents you and your company's values by implicit fact that you gave them the microphone
you're liable
if you hand your corporate twitter account over to someone (and this was their official account) and the account makes a "did you just assume my gender" joke
and I don't think it matters
I never heard it was an intern
that's a step forward
"hey I don't think these people, who can hear me, actually exist" is kind of rude to say in front of them
there's several here, that can read this conversation
I mean
*sex is complicated*
and she was XY
and then they did a genetic test
there's a case of someone who was assigned as female at birth, as all the conventional "girl" bits, gave *birth*
Biology sexuality is actually complex and they give you a really simplified version of it in school - it's like trying to teach about quarks to middle schoolers otherwise, when you could just leave it at "atoms are the smallest bits"
Enby's a shorthand way to say "NB", nonbinary
because singular they's baked into most english dialects
yet it flows naturally to you
sounds like singular tense to me
"they're *a* human *being*"
it looks like you actually don't find it that hard to refer to them correctly
"it" is rather inhuman, and they don't want to be called "it" usually
and they are
I hope you realize how childish that makes you sound
or a them
they want you to call them a they
I mean, they're not
okay so
you can have X instead of M or F on your license
it's even legally recognized in quite a few places
plenty of trans people transition from their assigned at birth gender to a non-binary one
if you really want to argue about how many sexes there are, please try to look into advanced texts about intersex phenomenon
non-binary stances are valid and I'm not really sure how much it takes out of your day to just let people live as they'd like
pretty high
that's
Current statistics suggest about 1 out of 60 births is intersex
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex
this is medicine
this isn't mindset
no
Okay like, a lot of this stuff is room for discussion, but erasure of intersex people isn't
chromosomes do not do the things they do perfectly or well
because *her whole life* everyone thought she was XX, including herself
about how someone with XY chromosomes gave birth, and literalyl every single doctor was surprised to find out she was XY
did you miss the thing I said earlier
I'm (ugh) almost 30
no one can take your belief away from you, but modern science is distancing itself away from that position
I'm still here to watch and make sure everyone gets along <:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
not malicious, maybe, but still rude
"I'd really like you to do this" "I don't feel like it"
okay it doesn't have to be malicious to be being a dick
you have the right to your own religions and belief systems
(don't misgender people because you don't like them, that's fucked up)
instead *of asking them*
why are you saying the answer is to "Examine them more carefully" to decide what they are
So let's say you have someone who has these mixed traits
I never claimed it was
You're the one who called it an exception
So you're taking it on yourself to be the authority on whether someone is male or female
Modern science thinks the exceptions are pretty common
Because girls can grow male genitalia and vice versa if hormone levels in utero are out of wack
are we talking cells that produce sperm
if we're being biologically reductionist we need to be fully reductionist
what the hell is a male cell
why is context so extremely important
if the line's so easily drawn
being impotent's not uncommon
what if, if we're being biologically reductionist, they can't produce semen?
what if they don't "function as a male"
a cultural interpretation can change, especially as science reveals the picture is actually more muddled than "one or the other"
the point behind bringing up other cultures wasn't to say "This is the truth" but to say "the concept of gender isn't rooted in biology, but in cultural interpretations of it"
again, several states and countries legally recognize putting X instead of M or F
but we're also not following our own
We're not following their traditions
they did things differently, and modern society's reorganizing itself to open itself up to third or undefined genders
then they're of equal merit to consider
Are you insisting that your culture is right and everyone else is wrong
and, they received social treatment as not being male or female but something else
the ancient israelites believed that infertile people were actually a different gender than fertile ones
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender#History
moving on from sex, which we've already talked about intersex, "gender" is a social construct - some ancient cultures have been discovered with three or more genders
I don't normally like to persue this argument but a lot of people find it easier to split sex and gender
it's not exactly a 1 dimension gradient
just this kind of web of organs, hormone levels, etc etc
last I looked
yeah they're currently going with a spectrum theory
just not all the way there
they were close to that I guess
I honestly would have accepted "I'm still a dumbass but understand the culture here and will support it while here"
Part of the culture this server was founded on was that nonbinary people *are* a real thing, are valid, should be included, and that they shouldn't have to weather bigotry here
You do not have to hate someone to hurt them
I don't really have any power over you believing what you want to believe as long as it doesn't cause harm, but please note that making non-binary people feel invalidated or erased is part of that. A pretty big part.
I was typing a thing up but I'm a little dumbstruck right now, give me a second
because the subject being brought up is a subject about respecting a pretty big group of people
"oh you're one of those people" implies the exact opposite of "oh, you believe what I do" in this circumstance, which is a danger sign
(I am being reductionist for the point of humor here, as a clarification)
it leads bad places
yeah, don't insist on 2 genders, kids

if Hana thinks her point is worth not apologizing for - which I'm currently taking for granted - then we're establishing that there's a personal freedom in apologizing or not and it's not really a forum for discussion here
My point is more
You're making an awful lot of personal attacks for someone who thinks someone should apologize for using too specific an example in telling the server to not bully and harass people
I agree with your concerns, Alice. Thank you for the feedback.
Would someone following your instructions put them in the hospital? Intent does matter, to a point, but so does negligence. I'm still considering your initial question, but, uh, regardless of whether it was your intent at the time, it seems like a really good time to remind everyone it's not good idea to use that kind of rhetoric at people, you know?
It did.  But that's why I brought up self-harm.
I do think reminding people that telling someone to self-harm or kill themselves is unacceptable as well if it happens, but your outlined concerns make sense
That's a fair request, but it's reasonable - no, *responsible* for us to keep names anonymous until a user makes it clear they don't mind their identity being part of the discussion.
But I don't, yet, understand the harm caused.
I don't think you're owed an apology for it.
Pointing your name out as the person who did this would accomplish nothing except encourage other users to then possibly bully  *you*, which is absolutely not an outcome desired from this
Bullying and harassing other users is against server policy, the user in question was handed an official warning, and names don't need to be brought up in public to remind the server that it's considered unacceptable, as apparently it's something that can be forgotten.
I'm uncertain what's considered the problem here, as the user in question was absolutely free to maintain confidentiality, but I'll make a note that staff should mix words around slightly to preserve further anonymity the next time we have to remind the server that telling someone to self-harm isn't okay.

I still haven't forgotten the "did you just assume our gender" twitter joke followed by "we're sorry you were offended by our tweet"
it helps normalize things
I'm okay with being pandered to sometimes
CDPR has *really* pissed off the T and Q parts of the LGBTQ alphabet - I don't think this will automatically win them over, and it will actually damage their position with the idiot alt right
is it smart of them?
but
Maybe
there's a lot of spin
It is worth noting that both republicans and democrats see criticism of israel as a political punching bag to get to discredit their opponents
As I said, there's a lot of nuance
But shutting down all argument against it because you're worried it *could* be is obviously flawed
It can be
No one is required to blindly support the actions of a possibly bad government just because people are pointing guns at them, there can and should be discussion
That's not automatically being antisemetic
So, there's room here to be critical of things without being abolitionist, right?
Okay
Maxwell, do you agree with everything Israel's government does
Okay, before we get sidetracked, lemme ask this
You say that as if israelis are incapable of terror
and if y'all are going to branch into that I really do need to get more caffeine
but anti-israel is not anti-semetic
This is a really delicate point with a lot of nuance
or anarchocommunism
Far left is pretty much actual state run communism, I'm surprised you have to ask
they're  for the most part offering a very watered down version of socialism
and yes
meanwhile half of congress, the judicial branch, and the executive branch are dominated by a single party
you have one party that varies from far-right to right, and the other that varies from center-right to center-left
the two american parties are "balanced" in terms of amount of people but not in distribution or political position
as a side note ICE is one of the things closest to an SS the world's had in a while
and it absolutely helped then
the war on poverty started in the 30s
just read it this morning
canada just reported their lowest ever poverty level this year
rather than "problems that should be solved"
A lot of why America sits pretty far to the right is the current american cultural paradigm features very heavily around "reasons why we shouldn't try to change it"
yeah that's generally where the "action" part of "democratic action" comes into play
because rich people rewrote the tax code
they currently do not use loopholes, they currently use the right to not pay any taxes
which covers it neatly
yeah most plans I've seen involve severely taxing either inheritence tax or income tax after your income/net wealth starts to hit hundreds of millions
I guarantee you if someone were to come in here and mocked 'dilating' or what have you they would probably not have a good time here
it's typically kind of a regional thing
nobody takes all of them
the us has PSAT, SAT, ACT, and SAT II for entrance exams
it gets better
hormones are never going to be as extreme in the rest of your life as they are like, right now, and that affects your mood and thoughts more than you might expect
Okay one thing that might be less obvious right now
that's not to say you shouldn't handle things carefully, empathetically, or delicately, but that's the bottom line
rule number one is never ever let a suicide threat inform your decision to pursue, cease, or pause a relationship - when that starts dictating what you do, you are in a manipulative and abusive relationship whether the other party intends that or not
chances are his career is already half over
he's a child actor
sure, maybe a little kid doesn't understand the desperation and terror you probably have if you're looking for a job
yeah the signing off is the part I found fucking terrifying
it gets you death threats
because accusing someone in power or fame doesn't score you brownie points
another problem is every single time some white dude in power or fame gets accused, every discussion on the internet gets filled with "you know maybe he's innocent" *when they are usually not*
in other places, it harms
neutrality is only neutral in a court of law
Instead, if there's an overwhelming preponderance of evidence, maybe have the empathy for other people in the chat to just leave the "possibly innocent" unspoken - instead of going "MAYBE THEY'RE NOT GUILTY", which has the unspoken "it's completely reasonable and possible that 8 sexual abuse victims are lying about this" attached to it
we are not in a court of law, and our priority is not how good and safe the accused feels, but how sexual abuse victims in the chat feel when they've been gaslit and had to fight the same stuff - it doesn't matter if we, in this channel, determine his ultimate guilt or not, or even if we strive to maintain ultimate neutrality for a person we haven't and probably won't ever meet
**but**
I completely agree with you that the legal system needs to go through due process and that they are not guilty in a court of law until reasonable doubt has been removed
which is what you do when you openly question them like that. Like, yes, of course, if they're not true, he's maybe not garbage (you can be innocent of something and still be terrible in other ways) - but bringing it up only serves the purpose of trying to get people to doubt them, to perpetuate the idea that eight women are willing to permanently fuck over their personal lives to score some intangible social justice points, or revenge, or whatever the excuse of the day is
there have been rumors going on about him for ages and this server is *really* not in the habit of silencing or invalidating victims
yeah
it's really easy to trip up queerphobes who freak out about nonbinary not existing or not thinking "they" works as a pronoun
they's already so baked into most english modern dialects for talking about yet-to-be-revealed gender

You'll cry more
this is why the right, and especially the alt-right, insists on debate - they love it, they just have no intentions in engaging in good will
if that wasn't possible or you weren't in public, there was no reason to engage
I remember ben shapiro once explained to fellow conservatives the only reasons to engage in debate is to embarrass your opponent in public
literal fistfights happen every few years
I'm just curious if you've ever seen footage of the house of commons
iran blew up some oil tankers earlier this week which pisses the US off, because all oil belongs to them, of course, and now iran shot down a US drone that they claim was in their airspace and the US claims was in international airspace but either way it probably shouldn't have been where it was
I'm more watching the impending start of the US-Iranian war
"I don't want to be in one" is not the same statement as "We aren't in one"
that's still a little vague for a first relationship
did you tell him you're breaking up
and this is all really just from my experience with american cops, I'm not really willing to make assessments in general since I haven't experienced other countries
I do not think that everyone who signs up to be a cop is automatically evil - though a lot are - but I struggle to see how those who remain in the force 20 years can be good people
and sometimes the cost is that black dude sneezed
and second is that we've idolized enforcers as protectors of the peace and agents of justice and defenders of freedom etc and then turned around and said that yeah, their lives are worth a lot and they should be encouraged to preserve them at any cost
it's inherent, it's like candy for people who want power
first of all, the existence of an enforcer branch of anything attracts those who are naturally authoritarian and bullies
well, it's twofold
as I said
after a full search
that this person was being interviewed in customs
I'm going to repeat
"I've established to the recording that I think you're a threat and I can probably legally shoot you now without repercussion next time you get close to me"
but the implication was huge
the person wasn't doing any such thing and was being, in fact, a rather restrained unaggressive dude
the customs agent loudly said things along the line of "please stay away from me so I don't think you're going for my gun" around 3 times
I was reading someone's account of being held at customs
if these things weren't true, self defense wouldn't be a valid legal defense to the extent it is right now
my opinions certainly aren't as extreme as Hana but I believe that the life of the police officer is way too valued and they are trained to value it way too highly
some people prefer a negative peace of the absence of violence over a positive peace of justice
isn't there an MLJ quote on this
I do want to point out that good people becoming cops has not stopped bad cops from leveraging power to an extreme extent nor has it prevented bad cops from being completely protected from things they do, up to and including unwarranted murder
I'm unsure what your question is
I mean pride exists because cops treat queer people like shit
Actively describing something as a phishing attack and explaining that it works through people being stupid leads to stupid people thinking they're immune
I actually think that with fame and this kind of pressure, it can create a problem where there actually wasn't before, especially if that person doesn't have avenues to mental health care routines, people, or programs
the good parts are unhealthily good and fawning, the bad parts are ridiculously awful
the whole influencer/small time celebrity thing is really bad and society just doesn't treat any part of that kind of many-to-one relationship well, in either direction
I mean, you're right in that we should strive to not tolerate those things
it does
environment is literally part of mental health
"this person is just less mentally healthy by birth"
yeah, mental health isn't something that is like

I mean, I wouldn't mind seeing halle bailey with red hair, but if she doesn't have it it'll be fine, ~~it'll be mediocre anyway, just like all the other live action remakes~~
some play along with it as a joke, but if nobody pauses to say "hey, we're just kidding, right?" things will slowly turn toxic
or zealotry or religious fervor or whatever drives them
because even when it's a horrible joke too grotesque to actually want it, some people just cannot resist the call of nationalism
alright, fine, fair - the point is the entire thing was a joke, and a lot of the fanbase got so invested in the lore and the theming that they no longer cared to look at it that way, or at least not entirely
comic book style ridiculousness except its so big on pretending to be gritty that successive generations got more and more invested in the grit

As someone who has extensively watched not only Gundam but the Gundam fandom, I do have to say that even using fascists in shiny uniforms as bad guys carries a small amount of risk of romanticizing it to your fanbase
if it works for the president of the united states, it can work for anyone
there's also the people who treat it as unique or special and then there's discourse around whether that's a highbrow form of slutshaming or not
I think a lot of the discourse happens when people try to lean on the identifier or treat it as queer
There's frequently a lot of discourse about it
Yay!
And if it didn't change under Monson it's not going to change now
I mean the official stance on being gay is that God gave you extra hard trials and temptations you have to ignore
Oh yes I'm familiar with how odd the culture can be
Highly compassionate except where they're not
Mormons are like that
Nah I don't
I've heard slc is one of the least bad places of Utah due to commerce etc
The culture wasn't as bad where I live but it's not Utah or Idaho which are like black holes of mormonism
yes I believe even the tiny part of the article I linked that gets shown in the embed mentions the commonwealth
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement
it's convoluted, stupid, and shows a huge misunderstanding of just about everything
people who believe that through interpretations of common law rulings they aren't actually subject to, say, the US or state government as they have essentially a citizenship onto themselves and not to the US
sounds like the sovereign citizen farce we have in the US
sometimes there are just those days where you're in a bad headspace and then life piles more stuff on top of you and that's just hard
Bad days are rough
I don't think this is a healthy question
Uh? These sound somewhat like witch hunt questions to isolate someone on the server
I am not sure what you mean
yeah I think his career's pretty over in the big leagues at this point, even if there's no conviction, because like... just, you'd have a lot of people refuse to work with someone like that
note that you can't text search the deposition part because the OCR got screwed up
which means this is probably legit because this is far too high effort for someone trying to dunk

regarding the questions about the whole vic thing
it's not a bad strategy when it's possible but it really isn't always possible
whether you intended it or not this has the same energy as "how is cyber bullying real just close your eyes"
don't you read kind of a lot of manga
<#371105434771390465> please
As would Grant
It was more /pol/
Not really in the national
In the primary yes
Yeah he won the primary partly because he was the meme pick
Trump's populist platform destroyed her
The rest mattered a lot less in 2016
Clinton was the establishment, was the swamp, was a corporate bought out figure, was part of a democratic family dynasty
Basically any time you read about "antifa" that's youth activists
I mean part of the problem is you're in idaho
If you think youth are just complaining on social media, chances are that's because all you do is read it - there are plenty of youth activist groups
It's a good exhibit piece
I missed that discussion but you know what? that's a fair counter
if you need to meme about politics this might not be the server
Can we avoid posting contextless, attributeless headlines that don't really have much to discuss other than "haha, look at <vague spectre of Left/Right since there's no author>"
how do they introduce the debaters if they both start in the blue corner
oh no is it ant man's fault
maybe it deserves attention?
And considering I've heard animators get death threats since at least the 90s
If it was a disgruntled fan, it's always been bad and light's being shown on it
onore texas
This does sound a lot like eugenics arguments
Yeah, uh, misunderstandings or accidentally going too far can happen, but I actually would really like to never see a user defending a comment they made about another user that the second user found distasteful as "you're taking it too seriously" ever again please
jokes can definitely be creepy sometimes
Chasers are basically replyguys for trans women
Oh.
Are we to understand that this is your opinion rakhi
Unsure, I wouldn't blame them for closing, but they might be determined to stay on exactly as they are
I feel it's appropriate
you're just asking governments to turn their back on all that income tax?
I don't think you'd ever see that as a possibility
Legality would make both of those drop way down
Both of which are at risk because it's usually illegal
Basically if both parties consent and are of age and know what they're doing, you deciding them doing it is wrong is basically policing what they do with their body, which means you need a very strong reason to do so

Is the short form argument
Exactly
They're kind of gross though useful if you choose to market to them? They are specifically fetishizers though and I've never seen one who looked like relationship material
I think the most likely course of action is KyoAni will dissolve and their employees will be absorbed into other studios or new startups
most anime studios, even effective ones, re-invest most of their margin in the next projects
they probably didn't have a lot of spare capital
And
34 people out of 120 and a bunch of work in progress and archival stuff
that's brutal
like, even if nobody died, redoing your destroyed work?
that has to be traumatic
I'd not be surprised if nobody at KyoAni wanted to redo anything they were working on
Your biggest hope is it gets sold to another studio
it went in, but the GOP-led government jumped in and said "they have to pay any and all outstanding court fees before they can vote first"
Last year people voted to amend the Florida constitution so that people could vote even if they've had a prior conviction
Okay so uh
I mean the classic example of that is the definition of how old something has to be to have its copyright expired is "older than Mickey Mouse"
oh ok
are we talking about votes and prisons because on that note *fuck* Florida
A lot of interpretations of that whole thing is that you have agency and it's satan's job to tempt you to use it freely, but being able to choose freely doesn't mean they're good choices - the proscriptions of life laid out by the christian god are supposed to be the "good choices" that will lead to the best results
<@!182890099183190018> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_New_Testament_canon I mean, the bible's been actively edited and chunks of it cut out or added depending on the "needs" of the church council in question
Yeah the Vic stuff is weird now
thank you!
That said, please spoiler that AXZ plot detail if you wouldn't mind <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
there is no stronger philosophical weapon than that of the author's belief
for shit that isn't anywhere near as bad as scandals in the US
Japan will *patch a game* to delete someone's lines or replace them
but if you think exiling disgraced actors can be harsh in the US
man yeah Millhi touched on it
but *you should never ask*
and make your own private mind
you should quietly wait for them to present proof
If you'd like to see proof
*ever*
*you* should not be asking for proof
Unless someone is accusing *you*
Okay, let me put it this way
"I was raped" "uh huh, talk to the hand until you've got evidence"
Yes you do
what is, actually, *more important* is not bringing up "they could be lying" as a possibility when a victim comes out unless *you have* serious proof they might be doing that
Full story is important
I want to put in an addendum to that
logically speaking, it's a false statement because it isn't always true but claims by implication to be
the statement draws a direct causal relationship
"where there's smoke, there's fire" isn't a true statement, but it does have some wisdom to it
that's completely relevant and should be discussed when he comes up
There are *plenty* of people on the internet who have gone to a convention and experienced Vic being kinda creepy
I'd actually pause there
you can be accused by tons of people with fairly good reason to be believed of rape and still get elected President of the United States
considering, you know
having power and fame means you're *really* resilient to accusations
I don't think anyone with like, actual power has had their career ruined by a false accusation for a long time
I'll agree it's a mess, but I submit it's unavoidable and not completely undesireable because it's a natural consequence of people being held accountable for their actions - which is a different concept from "being punished according to the law"
I think you're seeing where I'm going with this, though
what about testimony from multiple people
It does, of course
would you say that "pretty good reason to believe so" would include testimony
that's kind of my point
We wouldn't associate?
if someone's a racist and wants to hang out with me but I don't?
yeah?
Well
every time you decide who to hang out with
That necessitates a judgement
<@189158439316881408> do you agree that people should have the freedom to choose who they associate with?
People should not be able to get away on technicalities in the social court of judgement
I actually disagree - criminal cases are overtuned in favor of the criminal because the consequences are *dire*
it is still *more* likely that they have done it than *less* likely
But "preponderance of evidence" means that while there is plausible doubt
the standard for criminal cases is "without plausible doubt"
so
but I am saying cut them from your fucking life on it
I am not saying lock someone up based on a preponderance of evidence
we would not be criminally punishing them
For what it's worth, the way I or you would be engaging with someone would be a civil idea
"proven guilty" isn't really all there is to making a decision
Are you familiar with the idea of "preponderance of evidence"
rather than better
and then usually worth discarding because most decisions in life are worse from ignorance
That's worth considering
Right
Weren't you the one complaining about how this stuff destroys lives?
Should they?
C) *I would like to decide who ends up with my money*
B) Authorities decide punishment that isn't always consummate with the crime
A) Authorities are slow, because proof is so required
Several reasons society should be involved
In the court of law they really are innocent until proven guilty
it is their job
They always ask
Authorities do ask
It's reasonable to ask for proof if it's directly your business
because *asking is doubting*
and I think that's a form of evidential weight on its own
they are putting themselves on the line to do it
but when *anyone* makes an accusation about a public/loved figure
And Poi, when it's about random white college kid #350 I don't think you're too off the mark
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Vic's actually now had his opinions on being overly friendly with 14 year old girls recorded in court documents so I won't be supporting him regardless
it fit into established information that everyone in the anicon community knew
And it wasn't "automatic"
There's a reason people assumed the worst about Vic
I think we got here from Vic
I mean
you are harming them by asking them for proof, you, sitting on the sideline
it is, however, *harmful* to **express** doubt to the victim unless you have goddamn fucking good ironclad reason
that's fair and legit and fine
I really don't mind if you don't assume someone's a rapist
Anyway
or 3
or 5
or 10
what if he's a man, someone said so, and that someone is documented as being alone with him for 20 hours
I mean generations later the allies are paying a lot for attitudes established by them "winning"
unless the representatives are assigned by lottery
political parties are unavoidable in a representational system
DNC has or had some system called superdelegates that got to vote as well that altered who won and I really am not fully up on it
A fully functional third party would be fantastic and much less of a garbage fire but we're just not at a spot where one is just going to erupt into being atm
but there was some *shit* in 2016 with hillary vs bernie
and then the DNC will use that to pick one
Anyway the system as intended is going to have something like 20 democratic candidates face off in primary elections late this year/early next
sometimes they even get 1% of the vote!
there's always a few third parties
oh, sure
Democratic National Committee, yes
trump and whoever the corporations pay the DNC to put on the ballot
Luna or some of the Jovian moons are better, though the latter aren't currently easy to get to unless you are a robot
The problem with that is mars' gravity is on the "annoyingly high" for just extracting water for fuel/etc
iron
it's
First of all, red sand is a resource
No, I mean Luna
wtf brain
I meant the moon
pluto???
There really isn't one, aside *maybe* for Pluto, and that's just as a refuel/construction depot
before it'll be attempted
discover an actual good reason to do that
We'd have to uh
Dyson sphere is a plateau I'm a little skeptical we'll ever hit, though I can easily see a dyson cloud - assuming we ever solve the energy transmission problem
not indefinitely so
but as I said
somewhat feasible
Current strategies are burying it in old salt mines, which is...
For one thing you're offsetting the green energy gains immediately by firing disposable rockets
Nuclear power's risks are usually way overstated, the bigger problem is our current waste generation, which is... manageable for a while, though not indefinitely
maybe a shopping mall or something
I've heard it leans rather to the right
Have you looked into driving several hours once a month or so for skating?
Moving is hard
and things that take forever generally don't get funded
it'd take forever
but
terraforming mars could probably be fairly low tech
I just turned 30, I'm still starting
Also valid
Heteroromantic, bisexual
The closet wasn't worth it
I spent two years in a similar spot
Or otherwise LGBT if you don't like to be labelled by that, which is valid
As staff here let me specifically say that respect towards minorities is mandatory, and that a lot of regulars here (including me) are queer
Huh, he didn't manage to escape?
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
That's a word that's been ruined for me
Oof
Is ok
Miku is wonderful
Staying polite and silent just makes you easier to be erased, historically speaking
If they're on the white supremacy train they don't need more reasons to hate dude
What?
I actually have a Portuguese mutual but it's Portugal Portuguese rather than brazil
That sounds fairly rad
Anyway Miku is your Twitter in English
Sakimori is pst in my bed <:NononSmug:453854264138137606>
As Katie said, there's no reason we can't progress carefully and have open discussions and hear people out
Your argument literally sounds like "other people have decided your issues, so sit down and shut up"
We're not talking sabotage, we're not talking anyone being put in danger, we're talking a non-destructive blockade, which is as a classic example of a strike or other political protest as you can get
Where exactly do you get off that "these people have already been walked over, and some people (who clearly didn't get agreement from the people who are protesting) signed off on it, therefore *they don't have any grounds for* ***protest***"
Uh?
As nara said it's just a chatroom, there's no human rights being infringed here
They made a game of the rules
Intentionally
They caused forbidden content to be posted
Holy cow you do not need to rules lawyer like that, they should have been censured and probably ejected
weiiird
I do
This is why PMs exist
This really sounds like something that should be in PMs rather than trying to call out someone in front of the whole server?
I associate trench coats with film noir
maybe they should be protesting
if they don't address their concerns
If the impact studies are good enough, I'm sure someone can convince them things are fine
clearly, they disagree
This isn't actually related to "they shouldn't be able to protest"
This has been a thing much older than that
Also the terminology of "man wanting to be a woman" is incorrect but I didn't really want to get off the point at the moment
If you asked a group of trans people how many of them had had thoughts of self-mutilation, I think you'd be surprised at how many hands went up
linking it to gender dysphoria is both not entirely wrong but also seems like a very charged comparison to draw
it usually is only really discovered after a serious attempt, actually
I've actually heard of BIID before and yeah, people with it are highly prone to self-mutiliation
Oh!!
pour one out for minnie
granted, processing astronomical data isn't something I've done before, I'm more used to survey data, but there you go
there's always like a .2% chance you've got a really bad data set
margins of error are usually at a specified confidence level
If it's just working with sigfig issues, that's different, but generally there's more
At least not if a statistical operation has been performed
margins of error aren't absolute
also
like, just because the predicted course is to the "left," everything within the possible margin of error is absolutely a possible thing and it could be going at the rightmost edge of it ~~or beyond, if there was an equipment malfunction~~
statistical tools aren't really intuitive to explain
I get you ahiijny
if you can push a little you can push a lot, if it's far enough away
but yes we'd probably divert it several times greater than the possible range would be
is what ahijny was getting at
orbital calculations of observed bodies have margins of error
they hit the earth because the earth gets in the way of their trip around the sun
asteroids do not hit the earth because the earth pulls them into the earth
diverting it off course has nothing to do with stronger gravity fields
and yorin no offense but you need to heavily brush up on celestial dynamics
but it's doable
hayabusa's struggles highlight that
if you were talking about that yeah it's not simple
I mean, aside from implementation
what issues does divert it off course have
Then stop drooling over it
this is people's actual rights and not something to appease you
if you're going to do it, please not in this context
please stop fetishing lesbianism
it's a tiny bit self-serving, to try to restore morale to the people
I'm not even sure it has all that much to do with GDP or *that* much to do with cultural relevance
authorized by the US government
A comparison would be the 9/11 victim compensation fund

<:maddyhug:587370244247388172>
if you've got more info it's not in the article
but that's not the same as all lost data from the site
apparently it was able to recover all the data from the server, even
it was able to recover data from a server
that is not what it says
but yeah Japan - not great on LGBT, but a lot better than most western "otaku" believe in terms of cultural acceptance even if the legal situation is still bad
but there's always the condition that you can't restore functionality
they usually code it in terms of "sex reassignment surgery"
It's actually common in a lot of places
I believe you still have to be permanently sterilized in order to get your gender marker changed, for example
but there's a lot of progress they still need to make
japan is definitely on the "less shit" half of the coin, worldwide, in terms of LGBT
quick wiki check
don't use homos
"gay people" is okay, as is LGBT
I don't know about other languages but it's been used as a slur too much in english
please don't shorten homosexual people to "homos"
oh, my mistake then
For context, I believe Yuki is in brazil?
it is
in some nations
as Kerrik says, it's slow
I expect this is less an opportunity for change and more of a barometer of change already in progress
it'll probably slooooooowly continue to improve
they've slooooooowly been improving the past decade
this is interesting and valuable insight
No appreciation needed, it's something difficult to talk about
while being good isn't the same as being nice, the parallel is obvious, I'd think
who are you hurting
being nice
If your selfish desire is to be thought of as a nice person and you selfishly chase after that desire by
Being a good person is about making the choices to do good things more than it is about having a pure motivation untainted by ego
that's okay
but you know?
a lot of people who are good people act in that way out of a self-centered desire to like themselves more or to "act like" a good person
if it's important enough to her to act on, good, if not, there's no reason to screw up the friendship over it
there is zero obligation to chase her down and ask her
The girl's feelings and agency is important, and should be considered *if she acts on them*
even if someone doesn't hold a grudge, they're still likely to be upset and want to lash out
jealousy isn't rational and isn't easily countered by intellect and reason
huh, no, he is a theologician
I see an attempt by someone who is probably an anthropologist looking at and trying to understand the protoreligion rather than the actual modern interpretation
I skimmed the article and I don't see any attempt to "prove how stupid it is"
and every culture has some sort of flood story
I'd even maybe call it fear
probably just bad association
hmm
what's up
I think our track record's been pretty good about trying to help you out
I don't know if I would say I want it to, but I believe it will regardless of what I want
I remain faithful in humanity's ability to barely scrape by
Things can be changed in a decade
It's going to take about a decade to be anything more than words
I don't know if we'll go into a straight up production race quite yet, but this is less "WE'RE ZOOMING TO THIRTY BILLION NUKES" and more "We're taking the handcuffs off"
I think the biggest implication is that additional research will be funded
I'm not really being a proponent of MAD here but the logical train of thought is pretty plain
you have to make the other side scared of you
if you're basing it off the past
logic dictates
so
yeah
technically what happened last time is both parties were scared to do anything and so nothing ended up happening
the fact the russians refused to comply made this inevitable
anyway
Canada is not going to escape a nuclear world war
It is a gamble and the losing throws include "permanently lose both people as friends"
and it'll be destroyed forever
and they'll agree to try it
Because a lot of people *think* they'd like that kind of relationship until they realize they had an unrealistic and toxic view of what it's like the whole time
you shouldn't bring it up as an option
If your biggest goal is protecting the friendship
I'm going to level with you
I was answering yumi's question
Of course we don't
since they are not monoamorous
if three parties are interested in trying polyamory that's what they need
Really? That was shorthand for me because I didn't want to talk about the long process of emotional education and emotional maturity all three (or more) parties need to go through
it just probably won't if you aren't ready
not that it *can't* work
I feel like that's actually the worst option if you want to preserve friendship
the fart bomb is good though
yes

I love you too, Kriisa
the real test is if you blame others for everything going wrong or if you try to push yourself
nobody is perfect
real talk, it hasn't always been a stable relationship the last year, but the reason it's working and strong is because we've done our best to see what the other needs and what we need to change in ourselves to provide that
you just have to worry about what they're leaving out
you don't have to doubt what they're telling you

Trump isn't a warmonger, he's a gloryhog
It's probably true
bbc is fairly low on the bias scale but not at 0
It's not like we *haven't* had thousands and thousands of active nuclear devices ready to go the past few decades
I do want to point out
yeah, sorry
My immediate answer was "conundrum" but that is not helpful
we have no such quandry at the moment that I'm aware of
It's still an ongoing ethics decision whether it was right, but there was an actual ethical quandry that dropping the atomic bombs was meant to answer
the nuke wasn't arbitrarily used on japan for fun
There's a lot of nuance to that you're missing
I mean
Oh
I think the decision was made over the course of a month
Another has happened last night in ohio
I'm going to ask to refocus this conversation because it doesn't seem to have been very healthy and continuing it isn't going to make it better at this moment
Part of the strategy, of course, was to make sure the enemy knew how capable you were, so there was a lot of intentionally leaked intelligence during the cold war
the idea was to make so many nuclear missiles and deploy them in so many different ways that a first strike from the other side wouldn't possibly leave you without deadly retaliation - meaning they'd be too scared to launch the strike
It's actually the reason for the arms race during the cold war
because both sides knew that going hot was the end of both of them
and why it didn't go hot
it's why the cold war happened
They're aware
hot damn, finally

I'm seeing people indirectly calling other people in the conversation "Assholes," which, if you don't want to call it a fight, is conduct unbefitting of the channel.

I think we're demonstrating the danger of exaggerating to the point of lying in order to prove a point
this was a rhetorical question rakhi
pure exaggeration

There's a possible first amendment defense there but you could probably slap them behind similar regulation as other stuff like cigarettes

"north korea is about to fire an ICBM test into the ocean" is something we've had a half dozen times already
But "north korea intends to fire a nuclear-equipped missile" would have been a very, very loud deal in the news, as would, "North Korea is about to fire *at* someone"
disclaimer, I haven't actually seen said articles
every time you read about "north korea shot a missile" it's either into their own country or into the ocean, as a test
north korea hasn't fired at anyone in decades
no
that could *carry* a nuke
the latter is more the point here proving they have long range missile technology
the other is the ability to explode them where you want
one is the ability to create nuclear devices
there are two really vital different technologies in being a nation that's a nuclear threat
okay so
merely a missile that could carry a nuclear payload on it
Almost certainly not a nuclear missile
I'm pretty sure he knows about Mutually Assured Destruction - you can't use it as a shield unless you can hurt someone
opposite of to the point of incompatibility
at least, it's very hypocritical for the US to claim it is
I do think that "weapon development" isn't antithetical to "wants diplomacy
about 3-4 times
they've been firing projectiles into the east sea routinely over the last 2 months
much better
that is
I'm pretty sure if the lolicon was quickly deleted and the poster banned there's not a lot he can do

there was no evidence of preparations
my guess is he was never going to do it, just wanted to write a threat
here's a more accurate breakdown of walmart's "take down violent video game ads" thing - it comes across much less "everything is the fault of vidya"
regular psychiatric evaluations to see if the state feels you're safe or not is a possible path to common dystopias, I'd like to point out
fig you went off on a group of people not here and there wasn't really much to add to it, please don't be upset at other people for not focusing on your contribution, we did read it
glad it got cancelled
Okay I think I need to step in here
but "establish state power to assess and remove the mentally ill" is generally not good
there's lots of awareness and education and stuff we can be doing better on
there is
just adding to imbalances
It is worth pointing out that tools that would be able to remove "undesireables" from society, in terms of your "regular psychiatric evaluations", would more frequently be used on minorities and more frequently not be used when it should on those in power
it's not very good at it, but every first world country implements some socialist policies
even the united states has socialism
Now, there's merit in having more than one side in a discussion, for the refinement of ideas, but there's *absolutely nothing* saying that both sides are automatically bringing a fair view in that process
there's nothing saying that both sides *have* to have right bits to them
"you can't fly with one wing" is centrist nonsense saying that everyone has to be a little bit right
yeah, that's an old TERF argument and it's basically never happened
it's terfs, right
the difference between busting out the n word and going "You know, I think David Duke actually has a lot of good ideas" - the second is way worse than the first even if it's less "rude"
"oops I made a booboo with my words"
rather than
it's less that he said something racist once and revealed he has pretty toxic views on immigration, immigrants, and shares a lot of white nationalist ideals
Sometimes that helps, but there are contexts where even illegal use gets tracked and counted in the numbers
So it comes down to how much you want money going to that person to spend on Bad things
talking about it, getting people into it, and consuming the media can help them find more success
but Rowling gets money from every time they agree to make a new movie, or she writes a new book
Notch is completely divested of minecraft, so that's fine
It's important to contextualize that helping to popularize and consume works of currently living terrible creators does actually give them more money to give to horrible people and non-profit groups
*However*
they're just saying people who try to argue with that kind of stuff are using worthless statements
they are not saying that both systems are bad, both systems are good, or anything of the nature
the entire point of those examples is that people use ludicrous shit to try to reduce economic systems down, and you can make them seem fair or unfair if you just swap numbers around, which you have complete control over since it's all manufactured
Especially when there's no centrist views being presented
I don't think that's a very good comment to make Rakhi
the general point of all his outlets is to convince the poor masses that pro-capitalist measures are in their own interests and to take pride in having such opinions
but fox news isn't the only one of its kind he's made
his most notable achievement in this context is the creation of fox news
rupert murdoch has probably done more to ruin society than any other single person in modern history
And your options are to basically try to change people's desires or stop counting people as people - the former is incredibly difficult, the latter is inhumane
they aren't always good
part of the problem of wanting a political system that represents the desires of the people is you have to contend with people's desires
in theory they have experience and wisdom by having lived through other parts of life
making other people suffer makes people feel better
trains are kinda nice, but american trains tend to be pretty awful
which is ironic because I think the only people who hate the democratic party more than the right in the US is the left
a lot of self-declared centrists think that they're very wise for thinking they have a balanced outlook, or that they alone are clever enough to look for truth in everyone's statements instead of blind trust in the party line
a "left" and "right" leaves so much ridiculously unsaid
even the two axis compass is pretty flawed
I do not need to entertain xenophobia in order to gleam your wisdom on removing some restrictions on small business owners
because it implies both sides should be fully heard out, and that really isn't true on a broad-spectrum basis
and frankly, some stuff like "both sides have something to offer" is straight up toxic when you're comparing entire agendas
Nara's got it, most people I've talked to extensively about it think that because they don't agree to a full blanket checklist of ideas from one of the two traditional "sides" that they're somehow in a theoretical middle category or that "both sides have merit" when it's not really how issues... work
I haven't heard of them but wish them well, wow
It's fine to mess up, but it's important you learn from it
Why do you think you keep making the same mistakes

Thailand has a history of trans adjacent concepts I'm not really educated enough to expound on
I think most "attracted to genitalia" type things has more to do with social conditioning than it does with innate sexuality
yep
yeah it's just bein straight
all the superhero origin stories out there play out roughly the same
More than that, it *is an origin story*
It's a blockbuster hero movie, they're all generic power trips
just men for worldwide
well, white for Western stuff
But to refocus, *worldwide*, media has not even started giving women a fair chance until the last 20-30 years, and even then, the biggest projects are still highly stratified towards white men
While I think you mixed up on what I was asking what we're going to stop, I will say, briefly, I am not going to ask people to not discuss Madoka on A) a server discussing a magical girl show that directly borrowed from Madoka's success B) <#336297840529899522> on that server
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
we should stop?
we did it once
So you're saying
Okay
Anyway, Captain Marvel is a big deal because we do not traditionally funnel 150 million dollar creative works that focus on a woman in control
just a female lead
yeah I'd say that Madoka is not a strong female lead
She's very Yamato Nadeshiko-esque in terms of being demure and quiet and inoffensive
I mean, magical girls in general suit the bill, but yeah, the context of "western media" is important - not to mention even, say, Madoka has issues
Ripley from Alien <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
it's not yet
it has to be normal, first
for people to treat it as normal
that's why captain marvel got attention
ever
women being protagonist superheroes has never been normal
To fork a conversation from <#336297387863703552> , you might be on the wrong server, <@506219877724454929> - while everyone's definition of "SJW" is wildly different, this server's gay-positive, lesbian-positive, bi-positive, trans-positive, ace and aro-positive, and basically pro human rights in totality, so, uh, if any of those things bother them you'll either want to check them at the door or leave, because while criticism against feminism or other movements is fair and worth discussion, terms like "SJW trash" accomplish nothing but convince people that this isn't a safe space. There's no criticism, you're just grouping yourself in with people who hate various minorities for generally poor reasons.
Yeah the second half is trash
also cintai I have no idea what you're saying
but as a blanket statement, it's... uh, concerning
Like, not saying "have you never met a trans person you're diggin? you must be a transphobe"
some trans people pass *flawlessly*
if you're not sexually attracted to any trans person, but you are to cis people, you're almost certainly got internalized transphobia somewhere
Uh? A) uh, throws me off
a bare apartment is hell on psychology

1) twitter's owner and administrators, if anything, have shown more tolerance for extreme right views than extreme left
2) people probably just don't interact much with these losers
why would I
there wasn't an anti-vax movement in either country 20 years ago
uh
numbers I'm looking through aren't agreeing with your statement
isn't anti-vax also growing quickly in uk
It's a general "temporarily inconvenienced millionaire" argument
but it's mostly bullshit
<@!263983345669505025> has named the primary argument against it, "you're punishing the entrepreneurship drive, less jobs will be created"
where poor people pay less and rich pay more
the argument's about a sliding tax rate
nobody taxes on flat numbers
flat tax rates hurt the poor and benefit the rich
30% of 7 billion means, uh, one less yacht, I guess
30% of getting $40,000 means you can't live
<@183785454447886346> is that fair, though
it's almost like the monomyth is a thing for a reason

A lot of it's on me, I've been antsy lately, my apologies <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
I've seen people seriously try to argue that "I'm not transphobic, it's just not my *taste*"
o my bad
no matter the roots
it's a "you do you" thing
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I'm not actually going to really go into that, considering it very possibly does have to do with growing up with genitalia being gender-coded? but it's not toxic so
same as anyone else
oh yeah no absolutely I've known some people who happen to be trans who I wouldn't wish on anyone without massive personal growth
If you *won't date a trans person*, period, there's some shit going on
Genital preference isn't really a solid argument considering not all trans women or trans men have a given kind of genitalia?
There are very, very few reasons that you would never date [trans people] as a complete group that do not have roots in internalized transphobia
There are plenty of reasons why you wouldn't want to date a given trans person that are fine, logical, and probably even a really good idea
There's a distinction here
garbage by a different kind of name, I guess
It *sounds* like if someone leaned on this as an excuse they're kind of a mess
not all cis women get normal periods etc
also cintai this mystery person (mind you, I have never encountered someone like this and unconvinced they exist) is ableist as hell
Yeah,  please pick any other word for it, it's unhealthy and not allowed on the server
be as alarmed as you'd like
It looks like this more often than you think. This isn't "don't be alarmed" but a "this is what the world is like," I guess
Yeah.
I've never heard that factoid and but it's interesting to consider
This isn't special or new.

the situation in Syria is certainly worth discussing, mind you, and I actually hadn't heard about it until you mentioned it, but please don't draw that comparison between tragedies in the future
The fact that it's insensitive to the person in question isn't the issue compared to the fact that you're dismissing the feelings of pretty much anyone else who's ever lost someone to suicide
the only reason you're not getting a server warn over that one is because it wasn't explicitly mentioned it was a suicide
Please do not ever respond to anyone ever again revealing someone killed themselves with "at least it's not as bad as [other tragedy]"
last few days it's come out that several people were abused by him earlier in the decade

I think boris johnson is lining up for a full vote of no confidence
a censure is just "vote yes or no to punish or kick out"
this is functionally similar to impeachment but way simpler, as impeachment is, in US terms, basically the senate putting the relevant person on trial
apparently there's a related concept called a censure motion which is like a vote of non-confidence except it doesn't attempt to remove the entire cabinet
I don't know if they have a mechanism for that or if they just use a vote of no confidence
from like 86-19
(11, according to what the site I checked counts as mass shootings)
and, again, Texas *is* #2 on the mass shootings list
I mean, sure, alaska isn't very well populated, but you were just wondering if the issues you percieve with texas were a population thing


Alaska, of all states, is #1
of gun-related deaths
texas is fairly far down the per-capita rate list
if you want me to look up gun crime in general that'll take me a bit longer
2nd most *mass* shootings
I'm going to clarify
Along with Florida, yes
Texas is tied for #2 though
California has almost double the amount of mass shootings over texas - mind you, it also has 1.5x the population
that's a different claim than "isn't flawless"
I mean, I could probably argue there are places that do not have "bloody severe issues (a large understatement)"
overestimating, because you think their capabilities are better than they are
jeez
even if you're not trying to pass and are using a pre-transition gender coding, being on hormones will typically *still* get you flagged
unless you're incredibly gifted how your fat deposits worked out post-transition, you're going to flag it more often than not
they have different settings depending on gender
being trans is hell with those
they even still made me open up my luggage so they could look at my laptop
all your stuff is still scanned, you still go through the backscatter machine, etc
which most people don't
but I also had a background check
and I think there's maybe one less step
with less people
you go through a special line
you don't skip
as someone who's actually used precheck
and can deny you
they do run a background check on you
it will keep amateurs out, if the guards are focused

The biggest problem site in the world right now is India
While I think the middle east is becoming more capable of managing themselves than, say, the 90s or 80s, they're still one of the major hotspots of the world
So if it's a false flag op, they didn't respond to it in a predictable way
just that they were never gassed
to my knowledge
They never accused anyone else of gassing their civilians
The attacks have a bit more globally available evidence to them
because bailing on allies tends to be bad mojo
and we're now more or less stuck there
Most of it's a string of bad decisions made by previous administrations
Current, past, or future?
go for it
as long as you recognize there are probably no experts on foreign policy here
so people would never make an exception for that
Also, hats that don't have brims are either for cold weather or associated with lower class, generally
Of course they don't, but it's easier to generalize
in a greater cultural context
Generally anything that might hide your eyes can be seen as rude, I think
where you are and are not supposed to have them on
Using 'covers' is also pretty firmly delineated in the military
I believe, yes, originating from religious practices
Uncovering your head is a sign of deference and respect
I think we shouldn't mince words about how big a deal the impressions he gives off are
He has one of the biggest platforms to young children on the planet
If PDP intended to donate to them to try to amend the harm he's done, he better recognize they had *reason* to call him out
I don't think anyone can convince me that anything else, unless it happened in the last week, is as big a factor
The biggest reason is the community pushback
I mean you can be a white supremacist and racist without being a fascist, it's not a perfect term for this kind of thing, for the record
who doesn't know how to manage a community
I originally thought he might be intentionally dogwhistling but I've come to the conclusion he's probably just an idiot
irony isn't actually dead, you just have to be an idiot to use it
I don't think PDP's right winger or anything, but his fanbase has some pretty nasty corners to it attracted by his previous mistakes
and more that he's pulling it back because the nazis in his fanbase stirred the pot
the issue is less that he's pulling it back
he's pulling it back from the ADL I believe
Either you're aware you're possibly doing harm and do nothing
Okay, here are your two options
Then don't upload videos
*but don't blame parents for it*
You can write them off
It is literally up to you to decide how much you care about young viewers
Again, it's up to you here
It's a lot easier to blacklist porn sites than it is to blacklist youtubers, <@!217896572954869761>
pick a better counter example please
hell yeah you're doing something wrong
Why are you uploading porn videos to a site that doesn't ask if you're 18
It's not a dirty word
And that is your cross to bear
that's you deciding "it's not important enough"
and you don't adjust for them
I think if you know your demographics
I don't think you can offload it on parents and feel like you've done your part
and I don't think that's really responsible
yeah, I've noticed a lot of youtubers with large youth followings insist on maintaining adult humor
I do not condemn him, but I do not absolve him of collecting the fanbase he has, good and bad
I don't think there's room when you're a role model
I think there's room for making ironic jokes about nazis
I think it's important that they be aware of their demographics and at least giving thought to who they're writing off
PDP doesn't even mark his content as even potentially not kid friendly
for the record
It's a sliding scale, not really something you can say "not really" to
and make the content for everyone
clean your act a little
It's possibly less work to just
I mean, we're assuming you're really determined about sticking with the adult content
you can stick a form letter on it if you want
respond to all the kids
if you do that
I'm assuming you're responding to fan mail in general
Like, we're talking about responding to fanmail from kids with "hey, thanks, but please stop watching my content"
because you make less money
but no one does that
you can probably be absolved of (most) responsibility there
And yeah, honestly, if you *do your due vigilence* to try to get kids to not watch them, to make it not for them as much as possible, to drive them away when they're interested
what a shitty analogy
Ford did not personally build my damn car
because you made all the decisions up to the point of hitting the "upload" button
you're responsible for the way it impacts everyone
part of the deal is that everyone can view it
You put it out onto a platform that is explicitly for everyone
You can't do everything, you can't stop everything, but you can't pretend what you upload, if it harms young kids, is not your fault
it is up to you to care or not
kids are exposed
they don't
You're absolutely right that, ideally, parents would control everything properly
I'm not offloading anything, I'm telling you to look at what your actions are actually doing
do you expect every parent will do a good job?
I mean, youare
Offload it if you wish
And that's fine
but it's still what you're chosing to do
Doing nothing is an a defensible option
or you change it
Just remember that if you're not careful, you're creating problems in the future in order to bring entertainment to some today
they're saying it's useless information
that's not what they're saying
The permanence of the soul is an matter of interest to a lot of people even if there's no way of knowing what happens to it
Eh, I don't agree with that
a chain of conjectures is not evidence
a chain of conjectures isn't evidence
since the only possible response is "yeah, so?"
It doesn't contribute to conversations like this, at least
Pointing out there's no point doesn't change ethics
Nihilism isn't conductive to really anything
yeah, "agency" is like the fourth favorite word on the LDS talking points list
where god and the forces of heaven are signs of hostile order and static decay
There's a reason there's a lot of fiction out there like His Dark Materials
Garden of Eden is one of the places where it's most obvious that god is not fully benevolent
as theology goes the base concepts of LDS is... reasonable? But it's just in such an absurd, culty package
Mormons got around that by establishing a different need for the Atonement than original sin, iirc
magic super civilization in the americas we've never found somehow
I expect there's another few religions that expect divinity is what awaits in the afterlife
the mormons hold that the whole reason of creation was to put people through a process that would make everyone who followed the proper steps into a full fledged god
obtuse
it's
it does involve a concept called "anti-time" though so uh
Stephen Hawking laid out a cosmology reason that there'd be no need for a creator, that the universe could be self-creating
I disagree, personally, as informing action isn't the only reason to obtain knowledge
I completely believe the reason that black people finally got a break in the church was because BYU wanted a better football team
It's pretty bad for LGBTQ, yes, since even the most accept form of it is officially "god gave you these feelings as a special extra challenge, go be hetero and have babies anyway"
I was never a member; my mother was and is
I tried to not get too involved in the community
here the impression seemed to be that bad choices were our fault - Satan's place was as temptation, but the agency's always in your hands
I'm in socal and not in Utah/Idaho hell
I dealt with a less bad flavor than you did I think
sarcastic points in one group turn into challenges for a brawl in another
it's just, this isn't really the same audience
Nothing wrong with them
far leftist youtubers/discourse
a lot of the super exaggerated stuff you throw around in here sometimes is like you begging for people to argue with you
this isn't breadtube
<@284390402210136064> you really do need to cut down the rhetoric, please
are you liable for disclosing inaccessible content present in the files
which is still an interesting legal question
hot coffee is something I haven't heard referred to in like 5 years
you missed some discourse on the ethical burden of the village vs parent when it comes to raising children

It's usually used to refer to the past
Aka "hatched"
A trans person who has not figured it out or come out
But it's very rude
It's possibly true
I mean
When you do that, you're literally proclaiming to someone you're more in touch with their identity than they themselves are
It's incredibly harmful sometimes to be that intrusive
Other people suggesting I was an egg actually contributed to me coming out 2 years later than I might have
They hate that social progress and movement can happen and is happening whether they go along with it or not
yay!

It's generally suicide
the social difficulties of asperger's are likely to be the biggest (though by no means insurmountable) challenge to getting/keeping a job
asperger's typically puts one at a disability in that kind of thing, which is why conscious effort to learn can be helpful
the biggest thing you can do in the meantime is try to watch and understand social interaction as best you can
there is, but it's not a hope you should be complacent about
Trump's platform of "anyone but the democrats" is still about as good as ever
I just contest the idea that someone else is *obviously* going to win 2020 because I actually think it'll be pretty damn close
but yes, impeachment is a pointless process
though, ethically speaking, a mandate of the people isn't a sufficient reason to overlook breach of duty
yeah, sure
the impeachment continues
and if he wins re-election
yes
someone's optimistic

go on
I'm sorry things got derailed away from your point, Dino
spoiling aspects of XV
is actually
saying what is a relevant plot line in XV and what isn't
it's discussion about XV
The fact that you didn't understand that talking about what could happen during the last episode of XV is talking about the plot doesn't make it not talking about the plot
Please do not discuss XV plot in here; it's not necessary for the discussion
fair
I do kinda wonder how they dovetail or if it's just like, a rider
I mean it is doing exactly what a FOIA is designed to do
you're not the only one to have the kinds of challenges and struggles you experience, it's okay to get help
While I don't think it's appropriate to say you *need* therapy, I genuinely believe you could be happier and more successful with some
I'd try to start opening lines of communication - steam chat, whatever - of people you want to stay in your life
building off of "conservatives aren't going to die for him," it's worth noting there have been reports that there's internal discussions at fox news about moving away from supporting him
generally the honest answer is somewhere between "ego" and "lack of empathy" in these cases
but that perhaps it's not really our place to tar and feather them
I'm not saying it's irrelevant
of course
though when it's relevant to the policies they've made it certainly needs to be addressed
I do think you have to have a complex assessment of people raised in societies that were more eager to throw groups of people under the bus

there's been a movement the past few years to paint a bunch of american revolutionaries as Bad because they owned slaves. There's certainly a discussion there, but I think leaving it there is reductionist and unhelpful. Particularly for people who are already dead and cannot change what they've done, I think these kinds of discussions need to focus more on portraying them as humans who have done some good things rather than as Heroic Role Models, or Evil Villain Hypocrites

This is a really complex issue - Being annoyed by it is plenty reasonable, generally
street racing is also a hobby
there is an argument to be made that some hobbies cannot be permitted for public safety reasons

at least, not when used by your average civilian, even one with firearms training
handguns are not the miracle accuracy machines they are in media
much less one
you can't expect to hit your target with 3 bullets from a handgun
luckily the court disagreed it applied to *someone else's fucking home*
the idea that this lady could have used it in *someone else's home* was really scary - and they could have conceivably done it, what with them being an off-duty cop
basically that murdering someone that's a 'perceived threat' (legally, this is basically free) isn't even manslaughter even if you have a way of safely retreating from the situation
related to fizzy's point about guns and self defense
stand your ground laws absolutely terrify me and I'm so glad that cop lost that case the other day - the one where she tried to use stand your law to defend her going into the wrong apartment and shooting a dude
I agree personally, and the most agonizing thing about this discussion is that defenders like to derail it by going on about what an assault rifle is and isn't, completely missing the point
the current political climate of america seems to be "it would be really nice if that stopped happening but oh well"
depends how much we want people to stop killing our kids I guess
yes
it's doable
I believe you can remove most of the guns in america over a 40 year effort
even if the old one has problems the new one addresses
"the old one works fine, no"
you go
conservatism means when people suggest a new idea
conservatism generally means the opposite of progressivism
You asked what the general distinction was, not whether it's possible to come up with harmonious policies
they interfere with each other
but it's generally about right - individualism vs left - social duty
okay so "left vs right" in america is a little bit of a joke because it's like "do you want to be 1cm from the right end or 3" on a meter-long stick
fig are you just continually searching for things to worry about?
A comparison was made to soul singers,it wasn't ganguro
but climate change and US-Iran relations are both what I would consider much scarier

You've seemed pretty concerned about north korea before, and, honestly, while it's an issue, it's only one of several that could screw the world over and isn't even among the most pressing/likely imo
google needs to get their shit together though
at least they don't remove content entirely like tiktok <:llennDisappointed:432399986630590474>
Saki please restrain yourself that's not warranted, particularly in this channel
I think Saki is trying to ask to not devalue the threat of "nazis" by equating them with companies who legally leverage their control over IPs
Arguable
TF2's economy is why everyone now has loot boxes
TF2 had a huge economy
oh no
Overwatch has a gigantic esports scene yeah
I'm disappointed but not surprised at this
blizzard's been hugely invested into china for a half-decade+
not investment
most serious tcg players buy singles and only buy boxes for fun
and more they're not done *wrong*
I think it's less correct to say tf2 (and similar systems, like rocket league) were loot boxes done right
this isn't the channel to give feedback on tf2 weapons though
oh
dead ringer's surprisingly weak but that's only because most spy players don't understand how goddamn strong the invis watch is
you could also craft the weapons
like pooh
yeah one of the objectives of this is to get mainland china to ban the work/character
I don't think I've seen a pr disaster like this since gearbox
Kibler, for anyone who follows HS
Back on the topic of blizzard, one of the casters of the finals of the league that the penalized player belonged to - major name hearthstone streamer - put out a statement recapping everything and concluding that he was stepping down from casting the finals at blizzcon
I know they probably hate it but at the same time that is a lot of money to lose out on
I'm really curious what the other grandmasters are going to do

yes
in the truly worst case scenario, you don't have sufficient evidence
in the worst case scenario
it's only self defense after you go through court to prove it was self defense
either one is eyebrow raising
or their servers breaking

kebab stand was also hit, meaning a meme has taken lives again
"China should invade the rest of the world and bring them to heel too"?
how do you even get equally divisive
probably the most reasonable decision to the news
interesting stance

And it's worth changing your game to avoid
hurts
Yeah, not being able to tell the population your game exists
yes
I can kinda understand the interest in playing in a "what if Nazis won" scenario, it's 
common?
in alt historical fiction
I'm sad to hear that Maya üò¶
oh
you end up with lots of nationalists
game about historical nation building
it's just
The developers are great
Paradox community is /pol/ on steroids
including the holocaust would mean saying "hey, do you want to do holocaust? + nationality points - international relation points"
the kind of game HOI is
the problem is
well
New Order had swastikas removed and any reference to "Nazi" in the text/dialogue (there were a lot) was changed to "Regime"
new colossus was, I believe
please get your grandma off twitch it is bad for her
and then you build an entire industry over fantasizing about school romance, because it's the only place you can envision it
too tired to look for people to bone
too tired to bone
instead of punishing them for wanting them
but it's the only one that seems to make people not *want* more kids
generally, yes
the best way to slow birthrate is to raise per capita GDP
see also negative externalities
the climate situation is a textbook example of the tragedy of the commons
then we either do a patch job like normal or it falls apart
it'll be messy all the way
problems don't have clean solutions and not everyone wants the same thing
winnie the pooh (or the chinese version thereof) ended up being one for xi jinping that kinda stuck
so people started using slang and oblique terms to discuss things
consequences range from mere censorship to worse things
you're not really allowed to talk about xi jinping on the internet in a bad way
okay so
it's not actually anything to do with being compared to winnie the pooh
morality is a system that decreases freedom in interest of societal benefit
yeah
Justice is by definition the imposition of consequence for actions, while freedom is typically thought of the ability to do actions without paying a prohibitive consequence
*that* part is fucked up and almost bullying
Betting on who will do it
"please have literally anything unusual happen to me"
I still remember enough of school life to understand that way of thinking and I'm not really going to judge teenagers for it
yeah
so
hate speech is explicitly permitted under supreme court ruling as protected by 1st amendment
Yeah I actually made a mistake earlier
as a side note "not being able to be a racist asshole in public makes us just like china" isn't a good look
I think if you agree we've established that "completely free of consequences speech" isn't something we actually want, thus nitpicking "is it really free???" isn't relevant
and not get punished?
Should you have the freedom to incite panic in a crowded space by shouting fire
Hi <@456226577798135808> do you want to expand on the concept real briefly
Anyway the second amendment as intended died in world war 1 where a militia could never hope to match state-held military technology
is not covered, due to later laws
Crying out "fire" in a crowded place fallaciously, or hate speech
you're unable to be arrested by things you say
for example
The bills of rights have legal 'exceptions' stapled onto them
convicts generally cannot own ~~or vote~~
pretty sure status in society does affect your right
working with fireworks is banned in most of california, for example, due to wildfires
I actually disagree with the premise that "every citizen should be able to freely enjoy a hobby" when a hobby is contrary to public safety, fwiw
Fear of it happening is understandable, but conviction of it happening tomorrow is unhealthy paranoia
There's a lot to suggest that the whole thing was lobbying by mindgeek to control things even further and just permanently shut down any adult star who didn't sign with them
Mindgeek has monopolized the sex industry and they're about as scary as disney is to other industries
I apologize for not doing it immediately, this space is open as a chance to teach others and resolve questions without too much judgement

but sometimes trolls are just trolls
yeah
thanks for visiting
your words remind me of someone trying to stir controversy without a endgoal beyond stirring the pot
you *can* get arrested for disturbing the peace
and everyone's telling you you cannot get arrested for saying it
Getting fired for something is not the same thing as getting arrested for it
You asking in <#336310266654490624> is the perfect place to handle it and all further discussion will be there <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I don't know OAG enough to compare sankaku to it, but sankaku has all of the stuff said above plus a pretty overt defense and love of the concept of lolicon
full of really questionable articles
Sankaku's kind of
but it's basically someone - this is personal terminology, it's not really a thing - who behaves a lot of the same ways the 'alt-right' (which is a nebulous group including MRAs, neonazis, incels, etc) does except mostly just applied to games and anime. They're the kind who get upset over a company daring to censor the underwear of a 13 year old girl when localizing, or game journalists pointing out "hey this isn't cool" to some exec making sexist jokes or whatever

it's basically the remnants of the gamergate movement with anime thrown into the mix
okay yeah this is probably a better place
CP also helps morally connect "porn" to "bad" so yeah I'm fine with finding an alternate term
I do understand ninryu's point
oh that makes sense
I've guessed Child Sexual Exploitation Media but who knows
yeah, google isn't helping me
Regardless if it contributes to CP
I will say that any site or community is allowed to police content they don't want to be associated with
I get that stuff gets discussed that people are very passionate about but amping up the rhetoric results in shouting matches
If I can take advantage of a momentary lull in the heavier conversation can I ask that we please refrain from responding to people in this channel with all caps/shouting at them over responses?
yep
that's interesting, I'd never heard of that study before
but it's now actually findable
It's still not even in the majority
We're only finally getting to the point where there's a decent chunk of lesbian porn actually made for consumption by lesbians
The difference is generally the way the industry uses the actors, rather than fetishes involved in the media, radyjko, if that's where you were going with that
Touching back on "porn objectifies women" - it does, but that's because we have a shitty porn industry, not because the concept is inherent
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
Also in lesbian porn made for straight men, it's generally less portrayed that they're *lesbian,* and more that they're women who are so always horny that they'll just fuck anyone pretty
Kriisa pls
yeah
That's the path to growth
It's an eternal false reality, that they can't be a bully because they are the bullied
Nerds make the worst bullies - see gaming communities
Generally it helps them deal with the fact they're abused by others
üíö
that's a lovely surprise to see when catching up on this channel
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
that's borderline apocrypha at this point
it is a legal defense to lessen the sentence
In most states, self-defense is not a legal defense to get out of a charge
assuming they don't have stand your ground laws
if you *could have reasonably escaped or attempted to*, you're still on the line for third degree iirc
Self defense is complex and varies by state
Yeah, or probably the most common is car collisions
I have no knowledge so I will not guess
Third is for the really, really bad oopsies
it's still second degree if they end up dead
So you could argue that "I didn't quite mean to" for second but if you still intended to hurt someone badly
First is premeditated
spur of the moment
Second is murder without prior planning
No, that's manslaughter/third
can you see if he pleaded guilty
I could see this being a plea
was this a plea bargain
All of these defenses are generally purely to affect the judge, not a jury, since the jury has no control over how severe the sentence is
also "claim" doesn't mean anyone has to buy it
just to lessen the consequences
Again, not the kind of thing you do to get out of a crime
You might be able to claim provocation from that
as I've said, I've never heard of it being *successful*
Generally the defense is "the shock upset them and made them not fully in control of their actions"
It's an attempt to lessen your sentence, generally
trans panic has been entered as a legal defense but it has never been *successful*
I've looked into this before and as I understand it
"your waifu is shit why do you like her" is not
I mean, character analysis and such is fine
that's where waifu wars get toxic and nasty
tearing them down is not
talking about how great characters are is fine here
<@!102691114762371072> do *not* take shots at people in this channel
I mean, "able" and "willing" are two different aspects
but I think there can be a pretty wide gap
"only the master race is human and deserves rights," for example, is not really a viewpoint most people could engage in any meaningful way
there's definitely some base level of agreement you need to have a discussion
I think 90% is a bit high
but it's still important to do so
We do, which makes threading between them harder
Narcissists with a savior complex are *dangerous*
Please let it rest
She's taking a break
absolutely no shame in that
self improvement is always a good goal and I'm glad you're getting help
as a side note please do not make burner accounts to flame the server with <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222> 

I lost sleep the last time someone was really intent on doing that to this place
because it's a perfect mix of legitimate criticism and controversy and a very hefty dose of xenophobia and racism
pro-china/anti-china's going to dominate media discussions for the next few months no matter what
if it comes to that
only that they did a test screening and apparently it was *really* not well received
yeah it's not clear what was messed up
While the support for the one china policy is obviously going to dominate the news, I'm honestly more surprised they fucked it up so bad they have to reshoot the movie
Stay safe please
There's a lot of terrifying things pence could do but they're mostly undramatic
Still, I don't think he could push that through
He does, however, have influence
President doesn't have a vote at all, though he does have a veto
The president doesn't make laws or make things illegal
I don't think the executive branch has this ability
I don't think pence can legalize conversion camps
it's the fact you can't shoot them down
the terrifying part of MIRVs isn't the fact a bunch of nukes hit btw
probably because they were banned by treaty
though I think the MIRV ban treaty got undone a year or two ago
MIRVs got banned though
shotgun nukes have been a thing since the 80s
actually I consider the nuclear arsenal dipping below a certain point to be a terrifying prospect
you're not significantly shifting the blast radius
you wouldn't need to throw a nuclear grenade
<@!203444794737950720> you missed a step
capitalism and communism don't actually have a correlation between freedom and order
that's irrelevant to the conversation though
particularly when you're discussing sliding back and forth on the scale and not the extremes
using it as a criticism shows a complete lack of understanding though
god that would be awful, moving away from the glorious way pure capitalism treats people
it's a danger
Yeah
That said, I'm pretty sure you're more at risk on a vehicle going to school and back every day than you are at school from a shooter
Same thing every other student does, which isn't a whole lot
staying home isn't a solution
I can respect that feeling <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I think you're still Emily last I checked
Quite a few people in america don't have a driver's license because they're too poor to have a car
what is this supposed to be, titanfall?
a major studio making an fps with a well written campaign?
*everyone* lives in the cyber world
no, like
you need star trek fabricator magic, generally, or matrix-level management
but they all need to find a way to get rid of resource crunch - even *rare* resources
there's transhumanist utopia works I think have feasibility
yeah
I don't think it is
you asked if it was feasible
you're going to still have a classist system that's not a utopia after all if you ask the right people in that case
ehhh
well
that's basically what it takes for removing capitalism to make sense unless it's an authoritarian system
are there fabricators that create stuff out of nothing
ditching capitalism is pretty possible in a post-scarcity world
what does the standard cybernetic package involve? basically an integrated smart phone?
but for discussing morality or utopias yeah this is fine
otherwise, yes, a different channel - #general, honestly, since it's not symphogear related, or maybe <#377148557796442134> - would be more fitting than <#336297840529899522>
If you want to actually talk about that instead of the fanfic, you'll need to elaborate
You haven't really talked about the technology or utopia
yeah, pretty much
we don't have the City asimov envisioned, but the fact that from boston down to near baltimore is kind of a giant solid urban chunk is close
yeah, I'm familiar with the r daneel books
worse, you have to have a society that won't use the giant power transmission systems you built as death rays
they just never would be built
Generation ships *could* work
~~especially the idea of extra-solar colonies~~
I mean, current understanding of physics and medicine implies that such a thing won't be achievable with further technological development
not with current understanding of technology
oh, well, it's not
because if it's not perfect, *someone's* getting shit on
I'm going to submit the idea that if a utopia isn't perfect it's not a utopia
your status determines how much processing power you get
the anime movie Expelled From Paradise deals with a matrix-style utopia except that it's not perfect
though even that has limited resources
that's what I mean
people really like playing the game of guess who and it's happened in similar ways before
I haven't personally been there in a long time but I've been in contact with a few people who have; it hasn't substantially changed
If you do please do it in PMs or another channel
anyway I think the conversation's played itself out and this probably isn't the channel for it <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
oh, neat
skyscrapers, though they're very much a volumetric affair, are frequently tracked by how much square footage/meterage they provide
an interesting fact to cap this conversation off
The actual holiday is uniquely Christian but they did stick it when they did to make it easier to convert pagans
That's imprecise and a little dramatic
not fresh, but related

is marked with #metoo
the tweet
though it stems from the same objectification of women
yeah probably not
that isn't just a girl with a large chest
it's pretty notable she is arching her back and thrusting her tits into the focal point of the drawing
"people aren't allowed to have big breasts" is a pretty disingenuous way to try to clap back at someone saying oversexualization doesn't belong here
individuals have different reactions to the dilemma
well, this is a principle that works as a law of large numbers thing
Because the option is rarely "doing something" vs "not doing something", it's "doing something" vs "doing something else", and if the consumer feels it's enough of a hassle they'll just go with plan b that has *about* the same amount of enjoyment (or slightly less) but with less fuss
this is a known principle to basically every UI or marketing person
every barrier to entry lowers demand
but you're way more likely to go "eh. work. Not gonna bother today"
yeah
every barrier to entry lowers demand
it works for wow
you're not going to sub to another month of wow if all your characters are gone
you're not going to return to hearthstone to buy more expansions if you've lost everything you had
they sell games-as-a-service
because they don't sell games
Nara deleting your account is pretty huge to blizzard
but only to a small group
it's a distinction that's *super* important
so do people who work with computer sims
engineers use fluid correctly
yeah there's protests outside of blizzcon and there's quite a few people wearing pooh costumes or mei hongkong t-shirts
self-awareness is pretty much an emergent system that qualifies as magic
in any aspect
there isn't really a good understanding of how identity works at all on a biological, brain structure level
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
the "you're an affront against god" stare is skin-crawling
the "I haven't seen that before" stare is kinda ugh
the stares can be annoying, but sometimes they can be threatening
Conforming to cis beauty standards generally because of internalized cisnormativity, or because of desire to not get gawked at/passed over/attacked
and yeah <@143129446046498816> that's the crux of it
or otherwise discriminated against
the most useful part about passing is probably the fact that you're less likely to be attacked by a transphobe
it's an argument for another time
but there's a lot of discourse that passing shouldn't be a *goal* because reinforcing cis perception etc etc
like yeah, it's worth knowing whether you pass or not *for safety if nothing else*
terminology of passing is generally fine, it's attaching value to it that's in hot internal dispute <@143129446046498816>
that's referred to as "passing" in community lingo
it happens later
just
not distorted, not damaged
going on blockers is a completely reversible thing with no damage except a delayed development
~~and they're already sure~~
"wait until you're sure if you want puberty blockers or not" removes the use for blockers at all
do you think it's not a relationship until you're living together
it's pretty easy to do irl as well
but in the modern form of planning dates via text
mildly
I think dunkek kinda indicated he wanted to move on
you never hear from them again
send them a text
yeah
ghosting happens *all the time* irl
oh yumi
I don't understand your question
How can you have that level of trust for someone who can just get in a car and leave
the second person reported the first, most likely
a relationship is a level of trust and intimacy and that doesn't have to be physical
in the same program
that could handle 3-4 types of chats
because with so many things floating around, it was common to use programs like Trillian
yeah, though apps isn't technically accurate
I grew up when knowing someone on the internet was knowing their forum handle (and PM box), their AIM, MSN, and *sometimes* even ICQ number
to know someone over *one* chat protocol now
it's so weird to me
god
but getting banned from discord is A) not likely and B) *probably the least bad thing*
yeah I mean there's lots of bad things that can happen to teens sharing nudes
B) reported incidents
that kind of thing only really gets detected on A) partnered servers because they check up on them
but
yes, technically, it *is* against TOS to share nudes of underage kids
sounds to me like you're kinda being nosey
you did?
are you claiming you are not a friend
the person who left had been trying to work herself up to leave for about a full year
a friend of a friend of mine left a 3 year relationship and apparently it was weeks before the partner was going to pop the question
and the other is a hell you're convincing yourself to walk away from
sometimes one of these appears to be rock solid
the relationship as perceived by person A and the relationship as perceived by person B
while true, I'd argue that there's two actual relationships for every pair of people
going on routine dates with each other
5 months in
as in
dating
It's possible you just need to spend more time around the person - you dated your ex for like a week or two, right? - but it's also possible you have a major mental blockade to intimacy
are you not interested in intimacy?
so
are you asexual by chance?
which is kinda the direction it goes with reactions
generally agreement is expressed by building on each other's statements rather than turning a discussion into a voting contest of whos opinion is more accepted
is fine
~~the irony is that "^" is the exact same thing and I've had to told people to cut it out during heated topics~~
Reactions are disabled here because during a heated, tense conversation where people have strong opinions on a topic - which happens in this channel - reacting to messages with upvotes and "THIS" is more harmful than anything
hormones, the great eroder of formality
and generally one of the parties is horny at the time
generally there's a lot of flirting that leads up to it
My point is that the unpleasant details of the world aren't necessarily because of context but because the author *wanted upsetting context*
People die with little warning, again, because shocking the reader is a major authorial intent
The author spends like a page and a half describing a character shitting themselves to death and dying of dehydration
game of thrones is an example you have to be careful with, considering it's made to shock and titilate and gross out the reader
While I see stuff about 14 year olds getting married off in historical dramas, you pretty much never see that in works  of fantasy, even if they revolve around the same general society - intentionally grim works like a song of fire and ice aside
to a point; if it's meant to be consumed as purchased media, it's intended to find resonance in current, modern society
but in pieces where the protagonists are sufficiently heroic and sympathetic
It depends on the media
Though when a pairing happens between protagonists, you can view that as the author endorsing that kind of relationship, generally speaking
but I don't disagree with the general point
At extremes it comes off as fetish
it's unhelpful
but it's not right to come into an argument where people are going "hey, this scene is wrong" and go "yeah but the nation's full of bigots so what do you expect"
If you want to accept the content for those reasons, that's fine
you're giving them excuses
You're not giving them justifications
Justifying it as backwards doesn't make it okay
the problem is kazuma is presented with flaws but is portrayed as likeable
vivid
I know what he meant, the description wasn't, hm
<@203444794737950720> those characters are cool, using them as an excuse to put an 11 year old in garters and stockings is not
Sorry to drop this but I've been occupied and reading back and this chat had touched on things it probably shouldn't have
I understand that many of you are here to learn but I do urge people here to drop the mental age is the critical thing argument - while not wrong it's a common defense of pedophiles and I will take action over continuous dogwhistles in order to protect minors on this server
Sexualization of children really isn't cool
You have no interest in seeing someone just like you being awesome and doing cool things?
Dino, would you pay money to see someone make a movie or tv show about you as a superhero?
I don't think content like batwoman, or black panther is for *brownie points*
If I may offer another opinion
it makes *everyone's* review worthless
perhaps, but when review bombs happen?
and many of them are probably bots
but I'd guess no, some are also highly religious, some are just crusaders
demographical information isn't available on votes like this generally
...RT?
at that time
2250+ reviews
this doesn't happen for no reason, this happens because people go on a crusade
and it's why it's hit 8% audience score on RT
it is stupid
when people complain about batwoman and PC culture *they are angry that she is gay*
That's unrelated to PC culture
Please don't try to claim critics don't know anything and batwoman deserves the 14% rating **when there are multiple news articles about the review bombings**
joker failed to do a lot of things right and critics noticed
yeah
it has a 70%+ critic score
it has a low audience score because of anti-gay activists review bombing it
no
which, I think is fine
I assumed this was about making batwoman into a lesbian for the purposes of the show
don't know anything else about it
I don't think batwoman's artificially inclusive either - but my knowledge is basically "she's a lesbian now"
~~the wig's fine, batwoman in the comics wears a wig~~
Okay, but you understand the desire to see it, right?
Dino weren't you working on a fanfiction that a cooler version of yourself was a key part of
I'd like to ask you to not make that comparison again please
lol
yeah it was a neat move
knowing him he probably wanted that agreement more than the money anyway
but the artist *based him on samuel jackson*
Nick Fury's a bit of a weird case, when he was rebooted as black in the comics, it was before the movies
I was addressing radyjko's comment
both Nick Fury and Lucius Fox were traditionally white in comics until recently
if you have a good actor, go for it
particularly in comics, turning a white character black isn't that weird
for most fictional characters skin color isn't a terribly important facet of a character's fictional makeup
Your criticisms of the shows being boring and such aren't any less true, they're just almost certainly not because of "PC culture"
actually this one might be mad it's about a girl, period
yeah, "I'm mad they put gay people in it"

the original source of the word boomer, by the way
are you familiar with the millenial thinkpieces/hitpieces that have been around for a while?
To start with
In the context of its heavy adult nature, it doesn't - <#336297808221044736> please
This still sounds like kink talk
if this is just kink talk, you might want <#336297808221044736>
for there to be power to make something a slur, generally there has to be a power imbalance
it's a big meme right now because someone claimed that on twitter and just about everyone is laughing at them for being so dumb
it is
yes
kind of a kneejerk reaction to something they can't fight against, really
it must be offensive
and if it's used to make someone powerful feel bad
because people started using it dismissively against old people telling young people what to do
or just boomers
also known as baby boomers
babies born from late 40s to early 60s are part of the "baby boom" generation
yeah
a phenomenon that started at the end of WW2 when all the soldiers came home and had a very vigorous reunion with their family
is from 'baby boom'
Personally I'd argue the EU is becoming more like a nation
if brexit had been done quickly you'd been in the middle of a depression right now
it's okay!
hi what is up
ancoms basically go "well some people make it work in groups of like 30-40, maybe it could work for everyone", to my knowledge
this is good advice for anyone
and jobhunting gets tricky then
I'd say they're overstating it, but we are likely to slide into a recession soon
that said I highly, highly suggest disclosing at least *after* you are hired if you are in a state that requires them to make reasonable accomodations to disability
A lot of applications will ask you if you want to disclose conditions, but you can put "I don't want to answer" on it and it's legally protected
and that really sucks, yumi, someone violating your stuff is really, really upsetting
It's possible to use they/them pronouns until the baby's old enough to pick
I assume it's the trans people known by the visitors who have been lost
even as it becomes normalized
so my assertation is that no, that won't stop being a thing
well, that'll continue to be a thing forever
if it's for targetted marketting
as it becomes less impressive to stick up for LGBT
they'll stop doing it
the difference is that if it's for brownie points
as it is profitable
as a result of that, they will probably not stop doing it
it's not "hey we care about women," it's "hey women we were thinking about you, buy our product"
putting a rainbow on something is like making the packaging pink
at this point it isn't just "look how good a brand we are", it's legitimately targetting LGBT people specifically as a demographic
I think this is isn't something people don't really get yet but corporations have mostly stopped marketting towards gay people for "brownie points" several years ago
yeah that's fair!
well done
rady got it before me
anand joined the third of october
they're not under alice and I'm not namedropping their account
they are on right now and discussion of past behavior is not justification for current or future harassment, to be clear
Perhaps the tweeter only has an issue with language used, in which case they're being pretentious about being not-pretentious
helping friends is emotionally fulfilling but it takes work, especially if someone's really far down
this sounds like friends are only friends if they can be immediately useful to you
dude is semi-gender neutral but definitely has masculine leanings and some people may tell you they'd prefer you not use it when referring to them
I'd counter that "wut" isn't exactly a prime serious conversation response
yes, it's that bad
/pol/ is the board dealing with international politics and nationalism
over the 13 years it's existed it's morphed into basically a pure breeding ground for people to just act out their darkest and most malicious desires of how to talk about people and treat people because there's no accountability
4chan is a community that their entire thing is light to no moderation and everyone can post anonymously
because that's what /pol/ is
please just believe that people were, in fact, intentionally malicious dicks
I don't have any of them at the moment and I don't feel an urge to feed your scientific need to see how people were assholes, to be quite honest
I mean all of the important examples were horribly racist and I don't want them dropped here
4chan got really involved with pepe right around the time /new/ or /pol/, whichever existed at the moment, got big
yep
If an eggplant is going in a message at basically any point, it's probably for crass reasons
emotes are vocabulary of their own right - if someone sends me a bunch of eggplant emojis, I'm probably going to think they're crass
Considering the alt right made the üê∏ emote a dogwhistle, all non-kermit green frogs are a bit suspect
I have the same disdain for them
peepos are not really much better imo for the record
<:hugeline:587370244247388172>
you can plan how to destroy charities, how to convince groups of people that people are not people
you can plan vile things without violence
but
oh, the planning violence bit yes
but you have the freedom to say the thing
like terrorizing people etc etc
you can be arrested on things *having to do* with hate speech
hate speech is protected
the only thing I can think of that isn't protected is stuff like calling fire
what isn't?
or talking about it, or convincing others of it
and that requires that the people who make the platform be okay with people planning all the most vile shit out there
what you want is a completely open platform
the concept of free speech is the concept that governments cannot control what you say - which is admirable
if they did that there'd be a lot more quarantines
pretty much, yeah, it's a joke
(there are other derivative sites like 8chan where these rules aren't in place)
I think you're no longer allowed to doxx, but again, that's to keep the feds from calling them too often
but nowhere in the rules is *any* sort of respect for any user laid out
I want to clarify for thoroughness' sake that most boards on the site have some minimum rules - no bots, no advertising (or at least advertising bots), no *excessive* off-topic posting, etc
happened
also a bunch of school shooters have said "gonna shoot up a school tomorrow" and yeah
after the football thing
yeah
that had to be added
that's not an original rule
oh, right, you're also no longer allowed to plan terrorism
multiple times
which they have been
the only rule is no CP because that gets the feds involved
and with no limits on the kinds of bigoted jokes you're allowed to make
I lived on 4chan for like 4 years and that was before it was *completely* awful, and it's just... you know that kind of "friendship" where all the guys are always punching each other in the shoulder a little too hard and calling each other derogatory names and implying their "friends" aren't manly enough if they ever have feelings or anything

it's like that without actually knowing anyone and never feeling any need to tone it down
but it's bad
there are funny posts
That comment was uncalled for
this isn't moving goalposts, this is switching subjects
you're veering so far off I don't know what your point is anymore
so that would be the difference between these two
Unless it's *particularly* vile of a subject matter, it's a community that gets you quarantined
your argument's paper thin
anyway
it happens
it's like saying you're a christian but don't take heed in certain verses
you can be a marxist and not believe in violent revolution fwiw
if they do not, perhaps that is why they are not quarantined
does the community?
yeah, he does
/r/fascism, though? Breeding ground for extreme nationalism and calls for shit like eugenics.
The kind of person drawn to /r/communism, you can crack a billion jokes about them, but most stereotypes aren't that harmful
The communities both draw is of relevance here
most quarantined reddit boards are full of very, very harmful worldviews and people actively planning to spread them
etc
And this assumes it naturally ended up that way instead of someone trying to enforce a language on the world
Yes, but only moderately
stungun? which, oddly enough, are generally not guns?
what a logical grouping
arts and transportation
MAD got us through the cold war, it should with a little luck get us to the new year
tories are similar to the former tea party sub-collective of the republican party as I understand it
yes please I would like to buy nhs
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
2016 was pretty grim but people were scared of things falling apart much faster and nastier than they actually have
deep breath and the knowledge that though things may get worse they won't get unliveable
A thought occurs to me that they're probably related to desired eyebrow curves for both genders but I've never looked into it
there's a different ellipsoidal shape that they tend to vs masculine ones
rounded and frequently have wings
before I started getting more feminine glasses I always got the super expensive titanium flex frames because they last *forever*
this is a little more immediately dangerous
yeah, trump was one man who actually has curtailed authority at a lot of points
it's what with your countrymen believe
the problem isn't with what your news lady said
The election can be read as a mandate supporting brexit ~~and racism~~, that much is true
I'm guessing most of these are questions regarding brake failure
it might be the wrong approach but I think it's putting it mildly to say the author of the article has an opinion on what they're writing
they're making a car and programming it to save the driver
my take on it is the last sentence is the only line written there that has meaning to it
while they are utilitarian you should never underestimate their value as a fashion statement!
that's probably a fair statement
men's has more steel/silvered frames
women's section also generally has more colored frames, or frames in brighter colors
it's purely a stylistic division
yeah, I'm just saying
men and women don't have different heads or anything
though there's like, nothing wrong with picking whatever
many eyeglass shops will have mens and womens sections
for an illustration of feminine glasses, think of the hot librarian stereotype
that's a dangerous focus
the biggest problem I have with it is people would now have someone to blame
studies have shown there's no impact on voter fraud rates with voter id laws
so poor people who do not have cars are sometimes hit
it costs a bit of money and if you don't drive, you don't have a huge reason to have one
worse, those reasons tend to correlate to certain socioeconomic demographics
in the US it's a hot topic because arguably if you don't have an ID on you you're being disenfranchised, and there's a few reasons you might legitimately not have one
etc
where do you keep your voter id normally? do you remember where it is when it's voting time? if you lose your wallet, how long will it take before you get around to replacing it
personally I still feel like it's a bad idea
people who struggle with obtaining ID wouldn't be given credit anyway
because every point of friction is some people who are going to not vote
While taking some precautions for a fair election, it's the duty of the government to make people fulfilling their civil right as frictionless as possible
they get a lot, but it shifts more liberal because they have more to gain from liberal policy
yes, and conservatives (in the US) do not get much of the poor vote
because you're part of the party that poor people vote against
an astute observation, but with fizzy's proposition, it could, in theory, be altered
billionaires should not exist
yeah but now "jk rowling is a terf" trends on twitter
the two have been killing and oppressing each other for ages, that doesn't add extra depth to the next swing of the pendulum
I don't think it is
you overestimate it affecting whether that qualifies as an important part of the issue being misrepresented
I don't
no
the fact it's part of a pattern of centuries makes it worse rather than better
I don't think "there's bad history between our nations" actually is a valid nuance to this kind of problem, personally
that is what I mean
yes
had a german campaign
when *every* FPS was a WWII shooter
most WWII games back in the pre COD4 2000s
Germany in the later stages of the war threw most of its research behind rocketry and aerospace
it didn't help we kept bombing all their research labs
Germany was doing some foundational work but they had nothing even close to the manhattan project, as far as we can tell
you can get away with using unenriched uranium with heavy water
too good at it
<@!152896851660505088> heavy water is used for a neutron moderator because normal h2o is uh
yeah it just has extra neutrons
yeah nazis didn't crack the whole nuclear thing, though they were running some basic experiments on heavy water
that's it, those are the two things behind all nuclear plant safety
2) you need your thing to get hot or you cannot make power. But if you let it do its thing, it becomes *too* hot, and 1) fails after you melt through all your boxes
1) keep everything that is supposed to be inside, inside
everything safety related to nuclear power has two elements
I'm not sure why
I just learned bits of everything related to practical engineering as a kid
no steam
just
they still use turbines
the major exception are hydrodynamic plants
which didn't have a campaign but you sure did play as germans
maybe I'm thinking of battlefield 1942
I think it's less common than I remember but there was definitely a few
wasn't cod
someone did
dammit who did it
killed the batteries behind running the pumps iirc?
I was a bit busy at the time of the post but mood, trueblade, I totally relate
I know some people who have personally been harassment targets
because that's not *professional* apparently
and if looks are more important than facts, you end up with a lukewarm information exchange where people are afraid to say things like "the president of the united states lied"
but I do think appearances are bullshit and you can be completely rational while being absolutely furious at the state of something
I want to preface this by saying rational wiki is largely a joke and has been in the past the home of the worst atheist bros
a way to be important and better than others and to some people that is something they crave or are otherwise missing from their life
because it's a way to be powerful
and if watching news over the last few years has taught me anything, it's that trying to seem unbiased and fair can actually cause you to undersell the facts
the article, I mean
I think you're bothered because it doesn't feel "professional"
it's... really not an issue of nuance
kiwi farms actually is a cesspool where doxxing is a major board hobby of theirs
it's correct, as far as I know
I skimmed the rational wiki article
Are there even kids, or is he just being power hungry
Do you usually have depression?
<:laugheline:454887887847030814> thanks for the shoutout but I haven't done it alone
I'd like to also posit
breaking the bubble of personal space is definitely a high intimacy level
That doesn't mean you're not friends
So reluctance to cuddle seems more it's a reluctant to be close, in both a physical and emotional sense
not by default
Well, I mean, a cuddle isn't sexual in nature, generally
That's more a sign you're not comfortable being emotionally and physically intimate with men rather than attraction, isn't it?
Cuddling requires physical attraction now?
germans kind of get the association shoved down their throats as children
to not wear them.
know.
People who wear german flags
is wearing a german flag and a swastika together coincidence
that in no place, not even where it's a symbol of luck
(fewer minority checkboxes you tick there the better)
minors typically get away with small infractions if they seem like 'good kids'
they'll be fine
and they're a minor
as long as your friends aren't dealers and you're not going out doing other illegal shit no one is likely to care
not allowed and punished are two different things
okay if that's what you're scared of just go
if no, decline
do you want to be high, do you want to be with people who are high
there's been quite a few comments throwing nonbinary people under the bus, for example
and has been publically mad at groups of people who "make her look bad" - transwomen and transmen who aren't playing by her acceptibility rules
Contra's gone on records hinting towards a belief you need to follow a bunch of checklists to count as "trans"
yeah there's a very large reason to believe it's an intentional part of the LGBT metaphor going on in the first movie
based on a hilarious interpretation of the matrix scene
redpilled is the act of being made rightwing or alt-right
because contra's audience is now largely centrists and rightwingers who like her version of transgender because it's very palatable and she puts emphasis on passing and such
She also has a lot of people who lean right who have been quote "bluepilled" by her telling her it's totally fine and right to have her opinions
Yeah, there's a reason a huge slice of the trans community no longer supports her stuff
with fewer and fewer wiggle words along the way
That's been one of her major flaws for a while
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
That should help
<@!486087033652248576> It's not uncommon to dwell on bad things when you're alone, yeah. You okay?
you've shown it a few other times
I've definitely noticed a possible bad outcome to an event, even if it's incredibly unlikely to happen, can paralyze you and scare you away from an action
It's fine if you don't want to mess with weed, just... people who do it aren't going to get you arrested just by existing in the same room with them.
but I think you're being a little too harsh
You're free to associate with whoever you want for whatever reasons you want
because police are reluctant to ruin a kid's life over something tiny, ~~if they're not prejudiced against the kid~~
That's exactly why minors get away with it
it can't be war, congress hasn't approved it üôÉ
over all of history
War is well documented to accelerate economies and boost technological development
and it is really difficult to change the rules at least in the US
by being invented in 1780
the middle east has been considered the likely starting point of the next large scale war for at least 30, 40 years
getting motivated people is *so* much better than drafting
recruiting is important
take a look at yourself
draft talk is understandable, just... if that's the reason you don't want to go to war
except that's not an immediate risk, but us continuing to kill people abroad is
There's also this angle
I don't think we've ever had someone with worse foreign policy
I can't say this is exactly unfair of them
hmm

There is no such thing as killing every government leader unless you feel like doing a genocide
I would expect ground action
Iran's military is actually competent
I kinda don't like Type IV and V because they're scifi faffery and the Type I-III scale was invented as serious hypothetical astronomy ala SETI
yeah that'd be a 'Type V'

ah, that shows poorly on dark
here's the formula carl sagan came up with
it's a logarithmic scale yes
The idea about the Type I-III system is the scale of energy the civilization is extracting and using rather than the details of how
harnessing geothermal and tectonic is two ways to get power from the same place
No, but how you get the energy isn't really as relevant as having the energy
we do not yet qualify as a Type 1
<@!379633671897874433>
problems
Type 4 has
1-3 you can just calculate
We're about a Type 0.73, if anyone finds that interesting
A type 5 with multiple universes
a Type 4 would be harnessing a universe (the original scale ended before here because Kardashev thought this was impossible and/or ridiculous)
A Type 3 is harnessing most or all of the energy from a galaxy
A type 2 is harnessing all the energy a star outputs - the classical device for doing this is a Dyson Sphere
biofuels, geothermal heat, tectonic forces
Type 1 civilizations are harnessing all, or almost all, energy a planet can provide
Type 1-3 civilizations are an old scifi concept called the Kardashev scale, with a theoretical 4 and 5 added on later
Like, there's just a fundamental inability to look really far away at what's 'currently' (pretending our timeframe actually has a meaning here) going on
we look out to see *the beginning*
because we don't look out to see the edge
Our observable universe is really not representative of what truly exists, correct
(for the objection "what about dust", dust heats up and glows if you force enough starlight into it)
otherwise the sky would probably be glowing white
from one edge to the other it's definitely higher than c
oh, yeah
I'll take your word for it, it's been a while since I've read up on this and I've probably got it wrong
theories do not predict space expanding faster than light
weird
theoretical cosmology is
There's been some weird theories from hawking etc about space enclosing itself
but it has no edge
it is not infinite
the surface gets bigger
picture it being inflated
picture living on the surface of a balloon
okay the best example for this, rady
pictured a post-scarcity future where races work together as alliances and federations
Guy who invented star trek
maybe it'll even happen
The Roddenberry future is something I like to dream about
I mean civilizations have joined before, but yes
(probably doesn't have an edge, cosmologists still go back and forth on that one)
but it's not infinite
Mind you, it doesn't have an *edge*
yeah
they're not infinite
as far as we understand
it doesn't, because
Relativity just kinda destroys the idea of Type IV for me
basically, yeah
Because it's a commercial airliner flying at a normal commercial airliner route *out of tehran*
There's also been some theorizing that it was Iran defense being jumpy but that seems unlikely
I honestly think it's just as likely or more to be a freak coincidence
It's unclear
It only gets things to de-escalate if you expect the other country, Trump-led America, to back down and quietly go "yes we deserved to be attacked"
Similar to what you said about the india/pakistan situation - There's some obvious facts to spit but the sheer history of things makes things complicated in the eyes of some people
it is when you've got an embedded base of generational, cultural pride about defeating those damn commies in the cold war
truly we have a master of foreign policy who takes the best actions to de-escalate and protect the lives of the american people
the only way this plane would be getting shot down
which is, unless the question is attempted assassination of someone on board
my statement was that it's unlikely they'd see it on a radar and jump to threat response for it
right
oh, you were responding to kaliks
I'm saying it's unlikely they'd pick this target by mistake
You shoot it down on purpose, but have made a mistake in picking a target
You don't accidently shoot anything down
It's one of the checks iirc
The ATC *should* have caught it if they weren't squawking
and they've been abusing it
there's a law that allows them to isolate a child if they're posing a threat to themselves or others
that's what the article's about
it's not
security checks call them ghost guns
they've been a concern for a few years
patterns for functional 3d printed guns exist solo
but it's still an area being worked on
I think some have survived a single firing
I think rady was making a joke that falls flat
and if he wanted to actually do it or do something bad with it he wouldn't be watching it in front of you
no
I feel that button comment pretty keenly, I was there for most of my life
Because then an American shows up and they're like, Extra
I guess I can see it but it still seems weak
Japanese standards of skin color and beauty are a Pandora's box for sure but idk if it supports their point
Also last I checked most anime characters are Japanese, not white
But it's something you have to criticize series by series instead of the whole genre
Rather, a lot of anime runs with a strong fascist or nationalist root
Some of it is
[small exception for child abuse but if you're in this server reading this I expect you to not be doing that]
they cannot squeal on you barring you saying you will do something that is *imminently* threatening your own life or that of others
let them know, ask them questions, *never* lie when they ask you about what you take
instead I'll just say: don't do that, it can get you killed
I'm actually debating deleting emily's advice about keeping drug use secret from your doctor because that can get someone killed
so yes feel free to ask your doctor
unless you're saying you're totally going to do something life-threatening
if you ask about illegal drugs
they can't even tell your parents
not for asking, anyway
they can't arrest you for it
I would
Colonization doesn't roll back, unfortunately
It's only about who's in charge
They're never leaving
That's not up for debate
Not recognizing taiwan is, by your own logic, not going to make things any better for the indigenous
That's more of a reasonable point, but can I ask why you think that both sides being unethical on a certain matter means that the taiwanese deserve to be unable to choose
And other countries, like Canada
you don't recognize taiwan as having the right to be seperate from china... because they do a bad thing, that china also does?
That logic doesn't make sense
anaheim was a major plot thread of mid-UC yes
If you're not in the LGBT+ umbrella you should probably still not refer to people with it for the time being, and there's LGBT people who don't like the term... it's messy, as things related to people usually are
It's still a bit more complicated than that
ugh that bites
yes
It's less that something is "too focused" on girlpower, but that you're not the one supposed to benefit from the message
maybe you're not the demographic they care about
It's also worth considering if something feels like it's targetted towards something
emily means it doesn't have to be your responsibility to argue with him, correct him, or do anything about it if you don't want to take that burden
in my opinion moderating is an unpaid job and drama requires you to drop whatever you're doing to watch young adults be emotional for possibly the rest of your day - you're right in that they should be ready for it, but it sucks lol
they're mad at you for dragging old drama up and making more work for them
they're not mad at you for invading the abuser's privacy
yeah see this is the actual concern
If it is intended to be satire, that's arguably worse, because that would imply they really are trying to say that Hibimiku's an abusive relationship and are showing it through exaggeration
Satire does
Parody does not require a message
While it's parody, I'm not sure I agree it's satire
there's never a valid reason to give a death threat
there's lots of valid reasons to hate it
but you said "who can hate it" and like
Death threats aren't criticism, they're abuse
No one's defending those death threats
that was an incredible strawman
Yorin
HOLY SHIT
What people find funny being subjective does not mean you cannot be booed off the stage
which this does not do
the other is to make a point
one is to exaggerate for comedic effect - if you don't find Miku being an abuser funny, it's failed and open to criticism
okay there's two points to parody
effort does not mean quality
Turning Miku into an abusive creep is completely fair to dislike
if you paid HA, you only have a chance if they have either a warrantee policy or really unusually good customer service
there's nothing available to you besides small claims court
If the service was out to scam you and you paid them and not HA
It's usually a polite correction because people are usually scared of consequences for telling you how misgendering really made them feel, tbh
you are probably ruining at least one person's morning/afternoon
If you live in a city and you meet 50 or so people a day (say, retail job or whatever) and gender everyone you meet
Okay like
you should
Honestly?
"If you're refusing to use a better way after being told your way hurts someone" is more accurate here
<@!431214733463519232> You're looking at this wrong
this is the equivalent of being careful with your movement
so
especially if you're not careful with your movements
no, you can whack someone across the face by accident
"I didn't mean to slap you in the face" isn't the prime defense when you can be more careful to not go around maybe slapping people
Being misgendered is like getting slapped in the face
that's good
yes pronoun roles will be optional
it's slang for >text like this
pronoun roles would solve this whole fucking conversation
Why are you greentexting me
I'm looking to implement the pronoun role thing if possible
The problem is more this:
"Sorry my bad, I default to he/him"
"You should use they/them when you don't know, it's got almost no downside and you'll avoid hurting people"
"nah I'm good my I like my way better"
"okay but it's not about you"
"eh I like my way better"
Going to repeat this: You wanting to understand isn't bad but it also isn't always worth putting them on the spot in public
<@!189146272865845248> you're requesting them to disclose motivations and feelings in a public forum, your understanding is not the most critical thing here
Then the question's not really relevant
Aria are you interested in coming to a conclusion in this discussion or in challenging them directly
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
oh, alright
We don't need your permission on this but thanks I guess
and there'll only be three due to how the system works

yes!
Saki deserves a shoutout for helping me with her Kirichan

ah
it's in place
it's done
I mean
Yeah this is not a HK coverup, that's a real galaxy brain conspiracy take
I don't think he has a chance
that's it
bloomberg's platform is that he has more advertising money than others
trans people have a notably higher rate of kidney issues and UTIs because there's a trend of being too terrified to use facilities in public and there have been cases where people hold it in all day, every day, until they can get home
I should also note
and uh
it's cool, it's a general rule of thumb that bathroom bills stem from a desire to make a group of people suffer more than they are to protect people or make people feel comfortable
Using the one that they've been wrongfully assigned to makes them feel like absolute shit and is a reminder of the parts of their life that really suck, so they'd like to swap over, but they're quite aware that society wants to paste them to the wall if they don't look enough like they belong there
Nobody wants to *make a statement* with bathroom choice
they're all terrified
But you really don't have to worry about "pre-transition" people using the "wrong bathroom"
It's a slow, gradual change, and the only part of it that might not be slow or gradual are surgeries that are frankly no one's business and don't affect how they present
There isn't a magical point in the medical transitioning process where they are "male enough" or "female enough" to use the other facility
If they're willing to go to the other bathroom, they have, by nature, decided to present as the other gender in public
how they present
Because the only real concept of "transition" that matters is social transition
pre-transition people would never use what you would consider the "wrong" bathroom
Also
The law isn't about pre-transition
Also, back-up
If they are required to?
Do you think this would ever put someone's life at risk?
Mmmmmmmm
or even when it would make you uncomfortable for her to do so
even when she felt she was ready to
That girl could never ever ever use the girl gendered facilities
Okay what law #2 is saying
bathroom bills get people assaulted
<@!263534352422404096> for #2 remember that you're asking women in full makeup and dresses to be forced to use mens rooms
or is it just that transport's an issue
as in italy is attempting to forcibly break another country's quarantine?
No guarantee they'll listen, however
You get like a total of an hour of free time a day, right? I would attempt to tell your parents you need that time to deal with stress, and packing your schedule more full isn't going to help you live a better life
maybe there was a connection issue
according to the audit log no
But yeah, no hard feelings, I appreciated the thoughtfulness of the discussion
Going to the bathroom is a fairly vulnerable experience and it's even worse when you're stared at all day
it's okay to have personal weaknesses compared to others' personal strengths
and that's okay
I guess another way of putting it is you can't max all your stats, and while min/maxing your life is not healthy, you're going to have a 'dump stat' *somewhere*
It's good to try to keep informed, but if you make your objective to *always* be the *most* informed, you are just committing yourself to endlessly drinking from the torrent of information and never actually acting on it
September 12th, 2001, the most important thing in my life was an essay I had procrastinated on
Hey, it's just part of life
Advanced music theory has it be very very useful to be able to figure out what key something's in by listening
but it makes discussing it a lot slower
you don't
a lot
helps
it just
You can compose without knowing music theory
it seems a little weird that music theory 101's making you memorize pitches but I guess it's probably pretty needed
the rest is just achieving better memory
you can do it
If I play you a C note and ask you 10 seconds later if a note is a C note
you can do A with time
B) is commonly known more as "perfect pitch" but an ear for pitch can describe it
since they don't produce the sound
B) is rare but also isn't needed for composers at all
A) isn't that uncommon in composers
The ability to tell A) what note a sound is, and B) if it's on pitch or flat or sharp
it's good you can feed off that, some of your other meals might be more expensive now
good luck with that
I don't think they could have seen the weapons revolution of WW1 coming
(hi florida)
up to the point where if someone attacks you in your home/business you're entitled to murder them
this is something that varies wildly state by state
that's generally how these are tried in court
If you have the chance to run away and you shot someone it's excessive force
so why should other forms of excessive force
Beating someone to death because you were spooked shouldn't go unpunished
with that at all
I don't agree
I mean
The hardest part of substance addiction in the long run is the psychological component
this is less different than you'd think
it's the internal procedure for the democratic party
just so we're clear the insane confusion going on is not the american system
it would be mildly cheaper
All of them still equally destroy your life
Okay
it's not the substance doing it
but that's just normal addictive behavior
but alcoholism is substance abuse, so is being on weed all the time
*some* substances are dangerous
also that's not exactly true
Is speed related to severity?
I don't see your point
sure, physical withdrawl forces the cycle tighter, but it's the need for routine and for things that give comfort/satisfaction/pulling the lever of the skinner box that really form the actual addiction
While it certainly doesn't do the hard work for you, it's impossible to get better without those things
Hey I'm glad you're getting help and want to better yourself!

It's very easy to let bitterness drive you to bad, harmful decisions
It's always strained when that stuff happens

you might not get 5G reception in buildings unless they have relays
more to the point
it's why your 5gigahz wifi doesn't reach the rooms your 2.4 does
the higher bandwidth you go for radio, the lower penetration you get
it's more than that

this is a point of concern rather than something to panic or actively fear
you really shouldn't let these stories stress you like they do

substantial jumps
those are
we had 9-10, then 10-12, then 12-15
*3 successive times*
That's basically "boom, new figure, enjoy"
in 5 years?
For a jump from 9 to 15?
we're fine
hi I live in a city that almost doubled it in like 5 years

If you open up with "X is shit" or "X sucks" or "what idiot would ever like X" you're going to get distorted answers about why people like it anyway because they'll be inflamed and defensive
Habitual "forgetting" will be noticed by the moderator team, though we won't be draconian about it
As you're starting to repeat your points, I'm going to ask that we move on soon, because I think you've sufficiently aired your side of things, and at this point it's just turning into a lecture..? It's good you provided more of a background on things, but they've been advised on a lot of these aspects and a public dressing down, cross-server, probably isn't going to help.
Is there anything else important?
We've discussed earlier that attempting to start a conversation like this is toxic and a habit they need to change
Proselytizing isn't against ToS, pretty sure
<:BikkiSad:391790930967134208>
in my experience
the matrices are usually at the end of the textbook in the part of the course the teachers never get to
also complex numbers
it's been a *while* but iirc it's more advanced trig and matrices
but many aren't
and, I mean, some jobs are worth reordering your life around for to accomodate shifts like this
in other words, just not the same job people signed up to
but now with the new expectation that 40 is the bottom line, you're either made to work 6 days a week, every week day, or have a bunch of almost 10 hour days
I think the problem was that the job was offered with the expectation that one would work 5 days a week, and the fact that they wouldn't let you stay the full day on saturday was their problem, not yours
Previously I think the policy was that if you worked 5 days, that counted, but apparently the saturday shift isn't a full day or something
I don't think we're understanding the same problem, because these things total 40
I sadly don't see anything illegal about it
thus it is a moral imperative to thrust information in people's faces, because to do so is otherwise similar to letting people suffer, willingly
The conflict here is that people believe that ignorance of their faith and not being taught it directly damns people to eternal suffering
"have you heard of our savior, hamster jesus"
DNC won't let that happen though
if he makes it up against trump he might win
now it's being codified into law with actual harsh punishments
previously you could be charged with a bad 911 call and a few other misdemeanors and if the prosecutor was feeling bold, assisted manslaughter
States are pushing legislature through for swatting
yeah, because regular cops shoot people too
(just so we're on the same page, the term 'SWATting' does not mean that the actual tactical response team is being sent - the term's also used for sending regular cops)
Police are generally unaccountable for their calls in the heat of things, it really encourages a mindset of paranoia on the police officer's part and a need to protect their lives at the cost of others'
Even some illegal stuff is not off limits for *discussion*, though there's limits

I mean, there's also the threat of not being allowed to do anything with the party/people anymore
it's happened a few times yes
no reason to do it fast
there wasn't really a time crunch on it
yeah we didn't have pony express type systems until the mid 1800s
Personally speaking I'm not convinced that you can't be a good person and in an enforcer position, but it's certainly complex and the arguments against that are pretty decent
Though discussions are still out on whether that's because people who hit their family become cops, or because being a cop teaches you that exerting force to make people do what you want works
studies have shown that demographically speaking, people who are cops are much, much more likely to physically abuse their family than people who are not
It's also an organization that attracts people who enjoy having power over others
The general thrust of the arguments are that being a cop, even if you are not one of the abusive people on the force, is about linking arms with the ones who *are* abusing people, and overall being the enforcers of unjust laws made to target the weak. If you're a good enough person to actually condemn the abuses cops do, a pretty strong argument can be made that you couldn't, in any good conscience, remain a cop.
but it's pretty uncommon
oh yeah, pornography addiction is real

that all the stuff for delegates and caucuses isn't part of american government
She has a bunch of opinions I'd expect to hear from a 50 year old trans woman who's sick of these new wave people
or that kind of stuff
Like, she seems to think "I can get these people to let passing trans women use the bathroom if I agree there's only two genders"
she also spends way too much effort trying to deradicalize the far right by trying to seem "reasonable" and such, which is how we get attitudes like throwing enbies under the bus
I don't think she's ever *said* it
which, by the way, is why I've disliked her even before the enby stuff came out
and she's a self-declared spokesperson for trans people so that's not an out
She tries to defend a lot of the comments as venting or harmless complaints, except they're on her public twitter
it was basically "I'm so sorry you hate him!! He's nice!!"
She hasn't ever really apologized for it
the way you say that it's like "if you try to explain yourself we'll go for the throat"
emily there has to be like 13 better ways to put that
Since you're making some pretty controversial claims I'm going to ask that you provide better arguments than "I'm right" "I think you're wrong," because this discussion's really not productive right now
The justification for administrations is that people choose to put them in place

man, of all the problems I have with government
Anyway, I appreciate you joining us, but <#336297840529899522> is for actual discussion, rather than soapboxing
This is just preaching at this point
Alright
they're not wishing for it, they're just enabling it
That's unfair
Most forms of anarchy establish a system where resources are shared

And technology that lets the government remotely disable weapons is *definitely* impermissible by the 2nd amendment
If people aren't properly using gunlocks now, they won't in the future, and guns that bad people have won't have those devices enabled
Any idea that technology can stop guns is fantasy and isn't a solution
It's the people who buy a gun for self defense who tend to make the most mistakes
People who actually have gun-based *hobbies* are usually some of the safest owners - though I might make an exception for hunters
I guess I just think that the constituency of the politicians that would be toughest to sway also wouldn't really buy into these, so I wasn't considering a grass roots thing
No, it's a point
There's limited political energy in the world, and using it on small conciliatory projects sometimes means bigger things don't come to pass
I do think it has the downside of politicians getting to pat themselves on the back and go "I did something about gun violence"
Because the original intended use of giving americans the right to have guns was to empower them to use them against the state, mostly
In a lot of states, gun locks are already mandatory, though their use isn't generally enforced because that's kind of really gestapoish to perform home inspections
Kids in schools are going to get shot up just as much
you haven't done a single thing
If your objective is to stop the culture of fear inspired by gun use
If your objective is to stop suicides, a suicide prevention campaign is useful, though not tremendously effective
While decreasing suicides is nice, it honestly doesn't decrease gun violence in any relevant way
And yes, most of them are partially owned by the NRA and/or gun nuts and/or want to appear to be gun nuts for their constituents
technically the only people you'd have to convince to be okay with increased authoritarianism are the legislators
It might ultimately be worth having to endure that, though; it's not worth dismissing though there's valid concerns
My concern here is that the state will use the ability to track guns to mostly crack down on the lower class
It also doesn't *prevent* gun violence
A trade-off, but one that might be worth it
That's probably a better solution for the administration of justice, though it empowers a police state further
Yes.
We're stuck and the major barrier to change requires an *overwhelming* majority opinion to bypass
we're stuck
yeah, it's frustrating because
I actually have the same concern, I have no illusions that revolutionaries will be good leaders. Anyway, the best bet is dismantling the second amendment, which won't be possible for another 70 years minimum; the next best bet is to just improve gun control in minor ways. Gun violence is going to be a part of american culture for some time, barring a major government shift, I think the only real goal we can have is to lower the statistics, not eliminate them
"well my idea got shot down, guess there's nothing else to do but legalize murder"

having an aged society and lowered birth rate is heavily correlated with a stable first world country

neither's really fit for this channel
either lighthearted or dismissive, depending on how used
Anyway, the bots are a lighthearted function, but "wut" is a lighthearted response
The answer is no, *it cannot be whitelisted.*
The function is called "custom reactions" in the bot
Reactions can't be set to specific channels
No.
where basically everyone who had money made semi-perfect testtube children, and they're the only ones entrusted with important jobs
It's a movie
genetic engineering is honestly fairly likely to end up in a GATTACA-like classist society where the descendants of rich people are actually just better and more gifted than poor people
amorality in theory is evil in practice
It's a disgusting worldview, in my opinion
if you die poor, it's also not because you didn't try
but I doubt that
I can't speak spanish so I can't really discuss the video
"they're not trying hard enough, that's why they're poor"
Yes and yes
That's literally "poor people deserve to be poor"
That's awful
therefore, they're taking from people who should be making more
there is no combination of traits and effort a single person could put out that entitles them to earn that much
nobody deserves to be a billionaire
And a brown person will get refused
neither are true
At the end of the day this is a very long line of rhetoric saying that people who are rich deserve to be, and people who are poor are too dumb and stupid to be rich
being liked is more important than being smart
I disagree it's about being smart, even
it's systemic and the answer isn't "Work hard"
social connections determine whether you can even end up in an educated spot to even be considered for it
a very high amount of mobility has to do with inheritance or marriage
it's frequently not effort
Say you could find one person and you could even *get other people to agree* that "they deserve to be poor"
Yeah, rady makes a good point
There's lots of studies, by the way, and no evidence has been found that welfare support systems discourage people's desire to work
Then they die
live a not horrible life
If you're medically unable to work, perhaps that should be the role of the government to help you
then you die, and you're no longer poor
you still don't deserve poverty
even if you work minimum wage your whole life and never try for more
nobody deserves poverty
in fact, it is untrue
it's still awful and likely untrue
why do you think we care that you think people in your country deserve it
Dude, you keep emphasizing that it's mexico
No, you're just generalizing that many/most poor people deserve what they get
Entrepreneurship is a lottery too
All social mobility takes place using a miracle
Real talk
they deserve to be suffering
just so we're clear
The words "Choose to be poor" literally mean "deserve to be poor"
"they get food and a shitty house and don't die"
the compensation is
living on welfare is really shit dude
because that's mostly the rich.
wait, when did we start talking about the rich?
a whole lot of people
a lot of people
you mean
3 people, right?
Carlos, you mean more than like
welfare programs *do not encourage laziness*
Studies have shown
And again
B) no, I don't agree *they deserve to live a shitty life and die*
A) I've not heard this statement about france
yes
*overturn the system anyway*
**who cares**
if you think that only a few people 'deserve' it
You don't have to say it to believe it
Unless you do, in fact, believe that *most poor people deserve to be poor,* which is a line of argument you really seem to be going for
is the current system worth upholding and not trying to overturn for everyone else?
my condolences
yikes, sorry I brought that memory up Cypher
Welfare money does not have a correlation to willingness to work
> mel there are people abusing that system tho
studies show that they're not, and they'd be just as non-working without welfare, just dead or homeless
Yeah, it's talking points used by people who want to cut welfare
I mean, personally, I do hope they change their opinion because it's a really dehumanizing one that encourages beliefs that poor people deserve what they get and should not be helped
There's a non-zero chance they would have done a lot worse than 'give up' without a social safety net
participation in this channel isn't mandatory
dnc would probably actually fracture for real if it admitted being the villains they are
well, nothing legally
and yes, mexico does have extreme corruption, though I would hope that you can get a good worldview even in such a circumstance
It's fine to be dissatisfied with an apology but don't use it as an excuse to press in, please
Alright at this point I'm going to ask you to dial it back
I think at this point it's kind of best if the conversation stalled out, I don't think it's going to resolve in any informative way

`ok boomer in bioweapon form`
97% of fatalities from covid have been from 50+ year old people, iirc
yeah, while what happened is a scary event, there is very little chance of it having immediate consequences to you
yeah discord's warned that server performance may suffer
it's a podcast that ended up picking up a large part of the... what would you call them? Young activist left? Revolutionary left? The part of "left" beyond the "I like the status quo but with slightly more taxes" left
Please ease up on the chapo "praying for people to die" rhetoric, this isn't the server for that, regardless of its appropriateness or not
The only other stat I have memorized is that 97% of all fatalities are 50 yo+
~~that's how brexit passed~~
Like all developed countries, the UK has an extensive amount of older population
like, 20-40
this statistic is for *young* adults
The major problem in pandemics is caregiver capacity
I do not think that it lasting until a cold snap will create a worse result than the worst-case-scenario right now
actions are being taken to reduce the much more likely spike now
you're worried about the possibility of there being a spike later
Basically
Again, same amount of cases, same amount of immunity, it just takes longer
Statistics suggest that actions like these will still result in the same amount of cases, but over longer periods of time, where hospitals can not go over capacity
the idea of this isn't to *stop* the spread by isolation, it's to slow it
> we do run a risk of letting pockets of it bide their time over summer, when it's less likely to infect
that might work
because that is literally how the USSR came to be - it overturned an unfair power structure
the next step to think about is what happens after you destroy the system causing the injustice
also yeah I live in a county with iirc 11 military bases, I will die if there is a war
Additionally, the company denies they ever received an offer
Trump trying to deny the rest of the world it? I don't think so
That sounds in character
Trump trying to get the cure to be developed in the US so he gets the credit?
It sounds like a false rumor to me
just one that is more likely to fracture
In a lot of day-to-day stuff, yeah, coalition governments function like a 2-3 party government
Coalitions are wonderful to prevent a oligarchy from just fucking everything up but they also make getting things done somehow even harder
it's just something you have to deal with
"Ah, but the power dynamics are a lot more fluid" is exactly as much a negative as positive
like
Please stop putting all this stuff like it's positive
not what they want to do
but they're also bad because coalitions are generally held together by agreements of what not to do
Like, coalitions are good because they prevent a party from just shoving legislature through
It's also bad
because all of your party desires have to get chewed up and thrown in a blender with everyone else's to form coalitions
it almost doesn't matter how many you have
once you get to 5+ parties
exactly
but
sure
even 20
the bigger problem with the 2 party system is power is binary
no political party will ever follow exactly your ethical demands
only slightly worse than you represent everyone in a 3 or 5 party system
honestly?
and its needs and wants will change in response
there is never an end point, never a state of 'fixed' society, because society does and will change over time
I do not think reformation is impossible, just a slow process that will always end up behind where it should be at any given time
I mean, yeah, the downside of every revolution is that revolutionaries end up in charge
I just don't see your conclusion aside that you're personally jaded from it

I don't see why "sometimes it doesn't stick" equals "why bother at all"
I am probably biased on this but marriage just has a certain commitment and intensity to it.

Do you *need* it, aside from monetary reasons? No. Does that make it less special? I don't think so.
this isn't judgemental
why has this not been a gradual thing for you
aside from the fact that you go full blast on anxiety on everything you hear, why are you 'suddenly' really scared of this
sure beats kicking people out into the streets during a plague though
since a lot of people aren't getting paid for staying at home
yeah, the move should have been suspension of rent
that means nobody's getting kicked out for not paying rent or mortgage until this is over
which you do not, or you'd know
unless you have celiac disease
gluten isn't harmful to you in any way
because everyone in the house will be exposed to it if the person who goes out gets the virus on them
My point is it doesn't matter who has a strong immune system
it just means you, personally, survive the virus just fine
a strong immune system doesn't mean you're not a carrier
again, it doesn't matter
but the risk taking is very relevant
if one of you catches, you're all going to be exposed
being the most healthy isn't really important
(kidding)
make sure to shake hands when you get home
I'm not surprised
hawaii has historically been very hard hit by epidemic
same thing as this year
It won't last 10 years though
There'll be another depression, we were already headed towards a recession when this hit
They were making the decision between economic health and physical health
Which, by the way, is part of why governments dragged their feet over quarantine
because we're going to go into a depression over this
It will be, yeah
Isolating a vaccine is difficult and I've heard that it might be 6+ mos in the future
just not on a global scale
And flu quarantines do happen several times a decade
Yes, it's a concern
you're literally being given a weaker form of the same illness
yes, that's what a vaccine is
idk where you're pulling 50/50 from
flu vaccines have high efficacy
fairly, but not completely
Most of us are fairly immune to it at this point,which helps stop its spread
The deadliest disease in world history is just a flu, the thing you've survived several times
That combined with a very high virulence is what makes it a pandemic of concern
COVID-19's mortality rate in certain demographics is noteable.
Railgun, this is serious discussion, please leave 5th grade comebacks in 5th grade
Yumi's correct
I'm not upset at the article, though, I'm pretty sure the reversal happened *because* news started to break
(I work at one, they've been pretty shitty about the whole thing but their turnaround's not shabby)
They're even giving everyone who has to stay home 2 weeks of paid time off
like, to the hour
Gamestop did a 180 almost exactly the time this article was published
There's nothing to prosecute, those guidelines were overturned before they could possibly be put into play in any location
There was a discussion here yesterday about not understanding why COVID-19 was particularly scary or why it was a huge problem, this video summarizes it - very high virulence, potential to overwhelm hospital capacity and cause a large number of unnecessary life loss.

it was a very generous estimate
yes
NYC is only testing those who get admitted
also 23k is only the amount of tested cases iirc
it's not a small number, but they're clearly putting up a valiant effort to give everyone care
NY doesn't have that many deaths yet
that said
NYC is fucked
I'm pretty sure the *state* of NY is doing kind of okay
loss is always hard, I'm going through something myself right now, and there's never a simple solution, is there?
incidentally; avoid donating to salvation's army, they're historically terrible on treatment of women in their shelters, much less lgbt
a large amount of charities are operated by religious institutes
it is not a crime wave

moderators are not required to traumatize themselves to do their jobs
that's grounds for kicking and go "oh, I didn't check the content, should have thought twice about posting something so risky"
tbh
do always remember that you are not forced to be on a server
that said, on another server, it depends on how big it is, how public it is, and what the friend culture is like
it's in really bad taste and the "it's just a joke bro" mindset can be pretty nasty sometimes - you got hurt? your problem, the slap in the face was a joke!
to be clear if someone posted upsetting content in this server with the goal to upset people and the joke is that it was misleading either Lily or I would still, at minimum, have a lengthy chat with them about it
It's hard, and the only real solution is time and having places to healthily vent your feelings
full healing was more than that, for sure
Over the last 4 years I've had my fair share of really rough breakups, I didn't even start to function normally for a full month after the worst ones
but if you'd like a reminder to use <#336297840529899522> , I'm sure that will happen
Unfortunately for you, you'll have to manage your impulses without that; that kind of disrespect isn't really something I can allow to be encouraged
you don't have anything to apologize for
you know the particulars best, use your best judgement
that's fair
A lot of friend groups, especially for boys, revolve around joking about each other, coming up with slams and digs at each other, and being little gremlins and proving how tough you are
never let a friend culture desensitize you to caring about other people
personally, yeah
that was all very well put
I have a would-be willing assistant
Honestly I should study how to do it
Hahaha nice
because, mostly, the answer is "it does, but you're pointing most of those fingers in the wrong place"
and is a good rebuttal to "youtube sucks"
it was very good
yes
youtube's content ID system is basically an agreed contract of trust to let them take care of it and not get the website shut down
institutionally - copyright law basically paralyzes content creation as an entire medium and any hosting site would choke and die if taken at face value
all the content policing is *very much* the lesser of all evils
youtube sucks but on average it sucks less than people think
most of my 14-17 years were spent mimicking people I thought were cool
that's part of being a teenager
tbh
the facts don't fit this specific conspiracy narrative, rakhi, there's plenty of legitimate things to be mad about
ok now you're just being reckless
it's going to be a close race
please don't do this to make a point, you're wrong if you think biden's going to win by anything like a sweep
yeah
A) economics is way more complex than that and correlation does not imply causation
B) have you considered that it's actually completely worth paying more for groceries if it means people won't die
also most of "britains prices expensive asf" are due largely to their unrelated horrible foreign policy lately
you're just fucked
So if you can't afford the insurance
Because of insurance, things are charged for over their value
yes
I call that a good deal
yeah, but getting in a car accident doesn't cost them 60k in medical expenses
its so I actually get medical care that I would otherwise refuse because it would bankrupt me
the point of free health care isn't so I have more money
taxes
we already covered that
but I won't be dead
yes
I'd rather be on a waiting list for a checkup than die because I'm poor
Despite it, you know, working fine for every other first world country
uh-huh.
instead of paying insurance I could be paying taxes and would probably be paying less, yes, this sounds like a good deal
it's probably more like 20-25?
In non-scandanavia countries (they also have free schooling)
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I don't know what propaganda you've been swallowing but a large amount of people in this conversation live under socialist systems and still live complex lives full of rewarding choice
police, power, health
Competition doesn't work on utility services
I once needed an ambulance, I had to pay 3k
*they're probably not going to be all that much higher than insurance costs*
More to the point
several dozen
Wait, we do
If only we had case studies to anticipate how much more it would cost
holy cow
"compromise" means "pay higher taxes and enjoy free health care"
No
There is room for compromise that does not screw over everyone
what's your point
yeah, and people have billions of extra dollars
but your theory of trickle down costs is actually not as true as you think it is
Flat tax is a horrible idea and anyone who pushes for it hates the poor
There's a limit, but sliding tax scales do have advantages, yes
If you make enough to be in the 45% bracket you really aren't hurt that much by it
it's kind of high but they also have free university and other major things
it's difficult to balance
the creep factor
you don't stop a virulent pandemic
they're doing a pretty decent job
Trump's being insanely anti-republican right now, it's kind of a trip
And I encourage you to do so, but I do want to let you know that putting people down as 'autists' isn't permitted behavior here.
while AMAB people are
honestly I feel part of it is AFAB people aren't... very... encouraged to be online

I'll agree in that lectric seems singularly weak to FOMO
it's less that it's a normal symptom of puberty and more a normal symptom of depression, which shows up during puberty a lot

https://twitter.com/timkmak/status/1251936242834563073
that's a shitshow, worse than group projects for classroom based ones
except when a professor has a horrible idea to do a group project
online classes are less being taught and more structured self-study courses, typically
it's more like, assigned reading, assigned projects and tests, posting and commenting on a message board
you don't have to tune in for lectures everyday, generally
online classes in college are typically not like the zoom thing going on though
yeah, they're way easier to schedule and shit
this is where you find out that you'll be highly incentivized to take online classes in college anyway
or, honestly, there's a chance of a bigger spike, depending on if we just throw everything fully open
Particularly with the push to re-open, there's a chance of a new, smaller spike
Still dealing with this in fall is completely realistic
I think you'll probably get spring 2021
also everyone else will have missed a year too
yeah, if you're in a new school it won't matter
what
opec and russia are playing games
it's a lot more than just not travelling

"whether or not working is good for you or others"
I mean this highlights the fact that our society says "you're only allowed to be alive if you work"
I know every disney show or spiderman movie or whatever really treats high school like this amazing time but you're really not missing out
you're not missing out on good memories of being a teenager
I have good news for you

You can come to some hardline policies even after having a thorough think of things, you know
the kind that believes that because someone leans more one way than the other, that they've failed to think for themselves and think it through
the kind of centrist you're espousing is probably the absolute worst kind of political thinker
You might be thinking of being an independent
Ah, so you want to have an even bigger circlejerk
Instead you want to be associated with centrists, who are centrists because they like some right-wing policies and dislike a lot of left-wing ones
because the people who suggest them make you upset
you dislike left policies
So
They frequently are very smug and believe that both sides are jerks and the true way is down the middle, but that's just another group correlation - just like being volatile isn't a natural outcome of believing in leftist policy
When you identify as one, you're indicating that is, on average, where your beliefs are
a centrist is someone who believes in centrist policies
A centrist isn't someone who dislikes both sides
It's fine to be annoyed with political groups, but it's a really bad idea to try to switch to a label you don't fully comprehend just because people in the groups annoy you
Same with right, frankly; just because a lot of it is selfish thinking doesn't mean it's all from brainwashing
Do you think that if someone believes a lot of left policies, they didn't think for themselves?
It lost me a lot of friends tbh
I was when I was that age
A lot of teenagers are, it's really appealing to try to be different from everyone else
but yeah a number of cis gay people have been fairly "fuck you, got mine" in terms of rights. There's discussion in LGBT+ circles about "we should drop the T, they're too noisy and make us look less respectable" and stuff, to which the response is usually derisive laughter and outrage
yeah I meant cis gay not cis het gay because that makes no sense!!
man I know a lot of trans people that have problems with cis gay men but they'd never advocate legislation against them
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colorado_Civil_Rights_Commission
Same as the stupid cake thing
Religious freedom
Anyway
This is interpretation of stuff done months ago
What do you mean justify this
*no* that doesn't mean people are blameless for spewing it
*yes,* if you go diving into memes on the internet, particularly in bad places, you would be wise to prepare yourself
I disagree with the mindset that "if you get offended, it's your fault" of the posted argument
Burning disgust and desire for self mutilation has absolutely nothing to do with your feelings for other people
Lectric many trans girls are ace and dysphoria has nothing to do with being a lesbian
I did some of the dumbest, cruelest things of my life at 15, yeah
I want to make it clear, being someone who does all the housework doesn't make them an abuse victim, but going out into the world with the explicit plan of "I'm going to find the first person who can take care of me and let them control my life" is very much not a good idea
Not only that, you're almost certainly going to end up an abuse victim.
That won't work.
The day will come where you have to make your own decisions and there is not a safety net for you to just, not do that.
Okay cool please never act like these people have a point just because you're too bad at arguments to counter them
but it doesn't mean there isn't time for hobbies
Finding enjoyment in tasks that aren't purely selfgratification is really key
There's a little truth to it, honestly
or viewer.
I don't think it's sufficient reason to condemn every reader.
I think that's a decent reason to judge the creators of GS, WFC
I think GS is really tasteless and not that good to boot, but with shield hero I feel that being a proclaimed fan of it hints directly at a person's central politics
to the point where the protagonist is "the one good slave owner"
see shield hero, where the entire thing is an incel white knight fantasy kick
I agree with some of these points but I think portraying it as shock value is, at least, a step down from what they could be doing
It does seem to be the theme this morning
Pointing out hypocrisy doesn't actually dispel an argument, anand
*within reason.*
That definitely doesn't sound like a fair reason to judge someone; I do not research the differences between adaptations before viewing one and I don't think there's a moral obligation for me to do so
because you decided to express disgust at people without hearing out their reasons for watching
no
no, they were name-calling
no
<@!189146272865845248> eye for an eye isn't acceptable here, please be careful
Yeah, I don't think you can say it's why people watched GS fairly at all
<@!203444794737950720> absolutely out of line and I disagree with you completely to boot, I'm very upset with how this went
I don't think anyone's claimed that Goblin Slayer is like, amazing
And to everyone else, being a peanut gallery isn't helpful.
Getting caught up on it is fine, attacking other users for going "yeah I have mixed feelings on the show but I enjoyed some of it" is really pushing it.
libertarian also comes tied with the concept that people shouldn't be assisted by the government, because that means someone wasn't allowed to do whatever they wanted (keep all their money)
Wisconsin's currently suffering a spike in new covid cases because they had open polls like 2 weeks ago
because right now, even saying "go out and vote" is... not... a good idea.
honestly, it's really tricky
true enough
Regarding the initial question, this is a better breakdown than I gave <https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/03/19/transsexual-transgender-transvestite-what-should-you-call-trans-people/>
oh no, you didn't
Does that make sense?
I am also trans
I am a woman
like "this is a black person" "this is a poor person"
Trans is an adjective that is sometimes used to make things specifically clearer
however, we can't ignore the fact that we have specific obstacles, and like anyone else, those obstacles hurt us, change us, and shape us
For almost all of us, being able to be just a woman or a man is literally all we want out of life
Hm
I have to leave soon so I may not be able to answer though <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
sure aya
my dream in life is that the trans part of me is basically never relevant, if that makes sense
yeah
I'm struggling to say this in a way that doesn't speak for anyone else
either heterosexual or homosexual or bisexual
I've generally heard them referred to as 'chasers', because they tend to be... kind of obnoxious in twitter DMs and such
If people are into transgender people as a sexual preference, that isn't an orientation, it's a fetish
I don't know, I'd almost be more inclined to compare it to twink - the term has a lot of sexual connotations
if you're describing other people, you should probably never use it
a lot aren't
Some trans people are fine with it and use it
honestly, it's kinda complex and a lot of people have more nuanced views on it than me, but all in all transsexual is mostly an outdated term, and has a *lot* of fetish connotation to it - it's thrown around sometimes as a subcategory of people who modify their bodies as part of transition, but... like, that's a meaningless distinction. 

Mostly it's just kind of a filthy word that feels like it belongs in the 80s, you know?
but that doesn't make it ethically incorrect
You can argue that we shouldn't be *telling* people that
Ignorance after a certain point is maliciousness.
the first point they had to correct their ignorance, they did
Type B hasn't reached that point

but this is literally not what you were saying
willful ignorance is
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhRQxk9QA-o> I've linked this before; it outlines how testing makes things flow easier
Once testing's more available things will be easier
no he just read what I said and is taking the worst possible interpretation of it
you should definitely expect at least some pandemic measures to take place into 2021 yeah
I didn't think I needed to explain how the net societal benefit wasn't being maximized
Nah, there's no criteria where it's being used very efficiently - even from a point of greed, because resources are funneled into the competition
There's nothing to say communism can't work, tbh, and it's worked very well in some documented cases
Thanks to self interest
We are very far from efficient allocation
I'd say the same about capitalism, because the goal there is to use self interest to allocate resources very efficiently
Communism is the concept that most important resources, including labor and capital, should be communally owned and distributed according to need

There are lots of different models to achieve this, some of which are more like communism than others
don't listen to that corner of yourself
yes
natural gas... is actually a pretty great energy source for what it is.
the main reason coal's still used in the US is government subsidiaries; the main reason oil's still used is frequently there's connections between the companies that refine and the companies that consume
honestly the energy companies are very aware of the cheaper cost of alternatives
or, at least, it's a failure of free-market capitalism which is the 'ideal capitalism'
I'd argue it's a failure of capitalism, considering almost every time it has to be state regulated to a much higher degree than other aspects of the economy
"Natural Monopoly"
Economics has a special term for it
Utilities almost never operate under standard capitalism rules
Tie the state to a person, like a dictatorship or an unlimited monarchy, and there you go
If you want an economic system that maximized personal profit, you make it a state owned system and have the state's goal be maximizing profit 

Any form of competition cuts into your personal efficiency as it shifts your demand curve
anyway there are browser plugins that let you block websites
yeah, it's not a major problem here but as a rule of thumb, it's to be avoided; "me toos" don't add much yet can make heated conversations worse
trolleys still exist yes
it's okay he was only pretending to be an idiot!!!
I struggle with some mild forms of paranoia myself ~~abandonment complex from a 9 year relationship shattering~~ and I don't really have a huge solution other than find people you can trust and trust them
I mean, yes, you were, but I feel like a close friend of yours should probably be aware you're prone to paranoia and not be intentionally obscure
oh, only one
to have a production you otherwise like but has that one really horrible episode, or joke
like
sometimes that makes it worse
I didn't, thankfully
god it *sucks* to be having a good time and then be punched in the gut by realizing your existence is the next big joke on screen
It's definitely not the most offensive thing, but
but they're not and the status of being married affects everything from taxes to *being able to visit someone in the hospital before they potentially die*
if the words "married" and "marriage" were stripped out of all policies, laws, and bills, there'd be less to care about and we could just have ceremonies
there's also the whole "it's nice to be equal and not a second-class citizen and have your love and your rights recognized by your government" but baby steps - practical matters first
*nobody* can stop you from having a ceremony
he's not completely wrong in that a primary reason we really care about *legal* marriage is because of all the tax and property issues that married couples can benefit from
I mean
he's routinely presented as basically a person of almost pure goodness in a shitty world
I actually disagree that he's never presented as a great guy
Star wars was controversial at the time because a woman used a blaster, fwiw
It shouldn't be divested of context
It's an irresponsible use of a, especially at the time, highly delicate topic and it ends up just fueling it into an incel power fantasy rather than examining it properly
does the viewer
If no, it's not a controversal topic, it's someone's opinion
in the show
Is there any doubt about who's right and who's wrong
it's *encouraging you to think* that women are lying about what people did in order to harm those people
the show is about false accusations
???
The show has already done harm
And it was used as a rallying cry to deny sexual assault allegations
You'd think, but it's like, perfect incel bait
If you understand that the show is a work of fiction, it comes off that much stronger as a power fantasy, Carols
or the context of the world it was designed to be viewed in
yeah, I don't think that's as important as the context of the world it was written in
oh, the context of the world it presented
it's a harmful premise
but in a world where people are actively trying to dismiss rape claims as false defamation moves
Like, the initial premise of the show is reasonable
yeah, exactly - that's why the show is worse than it seems
"the protagonist is *the good kind* of slave owner"
isn't this

not about being owned by someone else to take care of me
Probably show a pretty bleak example of how much it sucks and make it a story about escaping that life
Freedom of speech is not freedom from criticism
is this them not exercising freedom of speech?
Most people decide to not be a crass asshole in public
Authors deciding not to tackle issues has nothing to do with freedom of speech
furthermore, do you think the false accusation thing is more likely to be met with "oh that's nuanced idk if this is a good portrayal" or "FINALLY, SOMEONE ELSE GETS IT"
Do you think 'we as viewers' applies to every viewer
it's the writer's choice as to what some of those are
all art has things in it
my point
that's
correct
generally they're positive things, like "rely on your friends" or "train hard and you'll get somewhere"
yeah, they all have takeaways from various parts
the younger they are, the more likely
there's *always* going to be a subset of audience who pays attention to themes on some level
I don't think there's any such thing as 'just a dumb shounen' for the record
It's art that reflects the writer's feelings, like all art does
*that kind of cautionary tale right now is irresponsible to the point of negligence*
the next point is
And
"this could happen to you. accusations are a weapon. think twice about trusting them."
it's
"all women lie"
the takeaway from the accusation isn't
No, the author was trying to justify the hero being a slave owner
the setting bent over backwards to justify it as the morally correct thing to do in his position
[convoluted world design]
depending on the objective, yes
and that's frequently morally correct
'honorable' and 'morally correct' are not synonyms
*screwed over by a woman's accusation* - there's a subgroup of people who are going to get way more off on overcoming that
also, the "screwed over by everyone" lacks nuance I think is *particularly* relevant
and is rewarded by hot girls
I think the show is trying to give a power fantasy to viewers, "this person who you identify with is so awesome people *want to be his slave*"
I think the show isn't there to say you should own slaves
that's not the point I'm making
yeah, no
Watsonian perspectives are useful for talking about fleshing out a world, or examining the self-coherence of a piece
she = raphtalia
the author wanted a story where she was naofumi's slave, maybe as a kink thing, maybe as an edgy thing, maybe as a "this is all controversial, maybe I'll get more sales" thing
yeah, you can't use real life historical context to deflect from the fact that fictional context was created to justify this
This is where it becomes a power fantasy
Yeah, and this is where it becomes a bad story
was the author.
the only thing that forbid him to do it
the point
you miss
Then free your damn slaves
looney tunes is wb
that's literally the Good White Slaveowner thing recast
most animal or robotic life has a fairly objective understanding - this is where nutrition can be found. this area is dangerous to my life. etc
sentience is having a subjective understanding of the world
yeah, idk, they didn't seem to have any ability to feel anything though
I think they're sentient, I think what you're asking is if they are sapient
well
they're (organic?) weapons created by humanity
but there's no reason to believe they are
no
this is a very philosophy 120 take
And yeah they went in hard on trying to redeem nastassja and should not have
also chris
wisely, I think
they just never play on them
It's interesting because fine does have sympathetic notes in her character
washing your hair every day can damage it fwiw
Some people can get away with every other or so
also, what you do daily
It depends on location, weather, and your own body
maybe if you find enjoyment in something that can never be completed that would help but you certainly can't plan that
I really don't know the best way to start to break it
your whole approach to not only life but just *consumption of entertainment* feels a lot like you have a hunger to check boxes that say "completed" rather than anything else
You really do think that way, lectric
as several of them mentioned it's almost certainly illegal as most states have revenge porn laws
the others are probably the same range
one of them seems to be paying for school which would mean college
if they don't and the relationship as is is fine with you, then problem solved
assuming, of course, these little things like begging to see selfies or acting like you're closer than you feel bother you
you do not feel the relationship should be on that level, so please respect that
it's that *you do not like their intimate behavior and would like them to stop*
you need to make it clear that it's not that it's the word "relationship" that you object to
it sounds like though, that they consider being in a relationship kind of a nebulous cloudy gradient, which is fine - but it also seems like they're trying to use that as deflection of getting to be intimate or behave intimately around you. The last line makes it clear - they want a relationship with you
it also means nonsense
but "we need to think more about these people and focus on caring about them," while a discussion that should probably happen somewhere, isn't a discussion I intend to have happen here where there are minors.
There's a lot of things you can discuss here
It's very challenging because a lot of people online who are pro MAP or whatever language they're picking either have other motives or are assisting those who do - at the very least humanizing pedophiles and going "they need friends too" can be very dangerous in an online context where grooming is common and easy
idk
most other downsides are via various implementations of communism which are varied, and some of them are designed to be temporary
a very short list of a downside, compared to capitalism: self-profit is a strong motivating force
unbiased objective look at communism: it's the goal of using communal effort and labor to support the community, rather than, say, everyone taking care of their own resources and laboring under a metric of self-profit
uhh
My interpretation is that they were getting gratification by calling you that and they're pouting that they were asked to stop, but I might be reading into it
Let's take a moment to recognize that we're all trying to respect each other and are just slipping up, and that we're not going after anyone here
<@!189146272865845248> I think the best way I can compare how what you said might rub someone the wrong way was if like "oh, I don't know on the whole trans thing, I don't know if someone's diagnosed with "Gender Identity Disorder" or is just weird"
not policy efficient
economically efficient
it's why nations are big in the first place
The idea of fracturing nations is appealing to some, but some groups of these smaller groups are going to realize that by transferring their power to a bigger collective they'll become more efficient and more powerful
large scale policy making can never be both fair and efficient
maybe nothing
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Of course the next question is "well then what's better" and the answer is quite possibly
this is why attacking the other party is very useful because it's the first step in moving from ideas into what's closer to a religion
the ruling ideology in a representational democracy is either that which has made the largest amount of compromises possible, or that which has forged a fanaticism, something beyond ideology
At the end there is very little fusion of ideas, very little picking the best of the bunch or earnest debate of merits and flaws - it's appealing to the largest proportion of the largest coalition that decides forward progress, or lack thereof
you have to build a coalition of people who have ideas *kind of like* yours and hope at least the person you collectively pick won't screw you over, like the person who holds ideas opposite to your group would
particularly when the number is 1, it breaks down
you get to pick (very small number of) person to decide things for you, at various scales
it's mostly the fault of representational democracy
honestly
thinking it as "divisiveness" implies there's a single goal they should be sharing, which is impossibly reductive
the same goes with the "right"
"left" is a group of people who disagree with a different group of people, not a group of people who believe the same thing
there is no "left"
You're missing the point pretty hard here
Mario and Gears of war team up against Counterstrike and, like Portal and Firewatch
first person vs third person
it's like trying to make people who like video games agree on like
I'm saying blaming things on a "left/right" division ignores a *lot* going on with political thought
"a lot of divisiveness happens with the left" is a point of view that really only happens because one's been trained to think of politcial landscape as a binary spectrum and then being surprised when not everything fits together
while the USSR had its own internal problems I'd definitely say their worst enemy was america undercutting them and economically screwing them at every turn
whether it's DID or something else
unless they're involved significantly in your life, it can't harm to throw them a bone and treat them the way they want to be treated
honestly the kicker to that is it usually doesn't matter
taking a break
Even if they're not catfishing, they are *definitely* guilt tripping at this point
I kinda get where he's coming from in that he's really annoyed at the idea of always walking on eggshells, but your boundaries are more important
yeah this is where the rabbit hole goes
puppy love is a force of recklessness
Because I remember being way too intense with the first person I had chemistry with
Are you his first crush lectric
it is not a human right to be able to find other vile people who think what you do and who like to shout horrible things
that is not a given right
you can say whatever you want but you do not need to be boosted or amplified
freedom of speech is not freedom to be platformed
The crews don't really overlap
Them coming out so rapidly is less a sign of cashing in and more a sign that marvel is bankrolling like 5 movies in development at the same time
Them being merchandise farms makes them consumerist but the idea that films must all be revolutionary high art that breaks new ground or is peasant consumerist feed is kinda toxic
I disagree that marvel movies being formulaic makes them consumerist
This hypothetical person usually holds this superiority belief as a point of pride and you're not likely to get them to budge
This isn't trying to expose something is bigotry that they thought wasn't
If they don't accept that bigotry is bad, do you have the time to explain that caring about people is in fact good
What would you be arguing
Evageeks was a pretentious hellhole 8 years ago, not surprised not much has changed
Glad you feel better
It's okay to be unsatisfied, and keeping a perspective is healthy. If you have the perspective, there's no reason you can't vent.
It's just broken in the opposite direction
Either way, it's not because the system works
True
Mind you, whether you're truly guilty is a different question
So yeah, defense lawyer in Japan is a joke job
<@189146272865845248> if you're arrested in Japan you're guilty, basically: conviction rate of 99%
4chan doesn't do things that they cant escape the consequences of
The doxxing is a real threat, honestly
Breaking into ships and destroying material goods does have direct correlation to destroying a business
Peaceful protests end up with you blackballed out of your career because how dare you disrespect the flag
Both of you need to take it down a notch
For the record there's an off duty police officer spotted coming away from one of the newly lit blazes in suspicious circumstances
Yeah you have to prove intent to kill beyond reasonable doubt
Yeah it was a police experiment store is what I heard
Yes
Iirc one of the reasons the target was hit was they were denying entrance to rioters begging to come in to buy milk to deal with the tear gas
Getting convicted at all would be a refreshing change at this point tbh
Yeah I was replying more to Aria
Again, you have to prove he intends to kill, and prove that he's not just really stupid and incompetent
It might be doable but I completely get the prosecutor's decision to push the charge they know they can prove- that he willfully used a bad and reckless technique that killed someone
For second degree
> if you press down on one's neck and one says "I can't breathe" what do you think is going to happen?

Legally you have to show that he actually intended to kill, rather than subdue with a bad and reckless technique
Don't think anyone deserves to lose an eye, bad reporting or not
Okay that's reasonable but even murder in self defense is kind of a big deal, in context of current events it's probably best to not shrug it off with cheery anime girl pictures in serious discussion
<@350410910600527873> can you elaborate on that
https://twitter.com/Selena_Adera/status/1266707305158017029
a lot of people don't understand that there could be this violent a response from this many people without organization
some people work together to show up at a place at the same time but there's no unified structure whatsoever
it's an ideology
antifa isn't an organization, yeah
Making it part of the public domain does a lot going forward to make it not weird
Onigiri part of the point of pride month is to normalize it because people beat/fire/otherwise harass others because it's "weird"
still, don't do that, if you're wondering if you should do that
oh I was sleepy and it was just a sarcasm post
please don't repost awful memes in here to discuss how awful they are
"starving artists create the best art so we should keep them starved"
the argument is
and even if we did
which we have no reason to believe we'd lose
theoretic drive for "human specialness"
out of some
because it's always used to try to shove down a world where the entire population is fed, given medical care, and kept safe
I think "you can't deny the risk that we might lose some theoretical poetic drive and stagnate" is bad
just don't be shy about realizing that maybe they haven't
<@!266379640069685252> I don't think you're dumb or naive for hoping they've changed or wanting to see if they've changed, I think that's very good
Military is full of people who just wanted a way to pay for college or family
You're also more likely to be white when you're a cop
You become a cop because you want to be a cop
I feel like military is slightly more likely to not fire on civilians than cops but it's still terrifying

I used to be a long time user, and the problem with 4chan is generally that the *best* kind of person you can encounter there is someone who doesn't have a problem seeing anger, disrespect, hatred, racism, and vileness on a daily basis in the place they want to hang out. The least toxic person is the kind who can either shrug or laugh it off. And, honestly, over time, the ones who secretly do have a problem with those things end up leaving, sooner or later - so, over time, the site becomes filled with people who participate or literally do not care.

Not all boards are equally toxic, but bleedover is a real thing, and you *will* see it if you hang out there, so... I don't know. Maybe it's not some sort of cult, but it is a place where the price of membership is to not give a shit. And of course, it can end up being a gate into the real hellholes like 8chan, or whatever the latest bastion of "dang, the mods won't let us talk about this because the FBI investigates 4chan when they do" activity is.
It's not the end of the world, and it's not the end of your world, lectric
Pretty sure I've mentioned this before, but it's unlikely you'll talk with much of any of your high school friends 3-5 years after you're out
I've heard the phrase used "good people can become cops, but there are no good cops"
the assumption that all cops are bad exists because the bad cops continue existing - thus nobody is good enough to kick them out, and everyone remaining is bad enough that they're okay enough with this to work with people who either commit these activities or avoid punishing those who do
It is normal for things to mellow in a relationship longterm, and if  you want this to be a super longterm relationship you will need to adjust that expectation somewhat
it's not worth chaining you down to something that hurts you
if nothing changes, find a better relationship
tell them that for you, it's not enough
Bring it up, just, ask if this is the level of affection they want in a relationship
There's a limit of the good you can do while being the biggest, highest profile, most noteable Uncle Tom in america

Sadly those issues are fairly common in the wargaming scene and 40k in particular

this would be true no matter what school you go to
it sucks.
You'll find you have two options in life: present the way you want only at home, or present the way you want where someone is going to give you looks and other shit
it doesn't mean everyone in there is a nazi, lectric, you deal in absolutes way too much
a female cast where this never comes up is a rare and, to most people, bad sight
'yuri undertones', is, if we're honest with ourselves, girls having emotional connections, including friendships, with each other
true, but it's kind of like someone begging for help finding ice cream that doesn't taste sweet
are they looking for a magical girl show without any slightest hint of girl-on-girl affection?
I'm trying to figure out the context of this one though
sometimes it's fantastic, even though it's not my thing

glad you'e okay cocoa
oh did OAG and *The List* come up because that's been one of my biggest sources of amusement during everything lately
The whole militia living in the oregon woods ended up being declared by a judge to be legal, which sets precedence
Also there's precedence of occupying federal land, though I don't know about state or municipal

the longer it functions the better position america is in to have a discussion on alternative policing and socialist systems
not because they're not evil but because why would they wait
yes I think it happening on pride month is coincidence
If you want to discuss points, that's fine; I'm going to discourage plucking random twitter people out to mock because mocking them makes you feel better; at best, you're exposing other people to the stupidity, at worst, you're getting people to attack some person on twitter
Where are you going with this one
conservative, yes, but not partisan
Gorsuch on the other hand has turned out to be a pretty decent Justice
trump's first SCOTUS appointment actually was the writer of the majority opinion

there is no voter base they care about
there is no bacon to save
this is SCOTUS

I should note that public figures saying something stupid that have cultural or policy impact *can* be material here to discuss.
Thank you
I'm going to be direct: if your response to these requests is to decide to still do them, but in a different channel, action will be taken that may include removal. 

Lectric, you're a welcome part of this community, but there's aspects and activities that just don't belong on this server. Being annoyed by foolish people online is normal and talking with your friends about how absurd it is is pretty normal, but if everyone just dumped people they don't like or who have said something stupid, in *any* channel, it wouldn't be mature discussion of any kind - it'd just be call-out posts of a constantly increasing negative toxicity nature.
Asking why kids have to learn about racism is probably the clearest manifestation of white privilege, because black kids have to get the talk around that age regardless
yeah! And the african version of it introduced one with AIDS a few years prior
don't see why racism's any less of an issue that should be tackled
Sesame street actually broke huge ground way back when by being pretty much the first show willing to talk with kids about death
but even the push for body cams comes because of this
I mean, yeah
people recording it is
Police brutality isn't new, and it isn't on the rise
I wonder if there was ever a chance of changing this country before giving everyone video cameras
It looks scary but it's really just a way to phish for people to send donation requests to
it'd shut down smaller sites

But yes, your choices make up who you are and if you do different things you become different people

I've deleted it; please don't post jokes where ableism is the joke
what you're describing is not a "world is bad" problem, it is a clinical depression problem
then I don't think you're on the right meds
the only other thing I have to say about this is: please come to this channel to bring a discussion to the table, or lay some things down you've got on your mind. This place is not an excuse to post things that harm people because you can with no greater goal than that in mind.
they are never to be used for cheap dunking points
Slurs are, in specific conditions, a subject that can be brought up in this, and only this, channel to discuss
thank you for the ping aria, it was definitely warranted
particularly if there's upsetting graphic content attached to it.
for those who saw the content, it is not okay. please do not shove slurs and people being horrible in front of the community in order to go "gosh. look how bad it is."
yeah this isn't okay
all these high profile twitlongers dropping at once are causing server errors
from what I gather a lot of smash groups are run by people college age and have a fratgroup approach, or at least did
jeez
I've seen people reacting to it without seeing what's going on
high profile twitch streamer
oh jeez
the godzilla short is really cute
it's not just smash, evo and dota and others are having shit come out
live esports events *in general* have a giant problem and at the moment I wouldn't mind if the whole thing was torn apart and shut down
but yeah honestly with everything that's dropped this week
the counterargument is that it is, in fact, useful terminology and metaphor
maybe it's time to ditch them as cs stuff?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
that said, lingo about master/slave
I don't think that will ever change
lit areas represent openness and truth; lightless areas are dangerous, hidden, and mysterious
I think no amount of playing with semantics is going to divest associations of white good black bad, because *it's not racially based* - at least, probably not primarily
it sucks, 100% of the time.
people do not come out and make accusations about popular people for fun.
I think the threshold of "allegations made about someone before shit should be taken apart and paused before anything else" should be very, very low
it is not a small amount of effort being spent and then a person goes "look, I have done something, I have fought for justice and a better future" and then sighs, content they have done their part
but I worry it actually has harm
it has some small amount of benefit
so probably not the trump vote, no
Kanye came out and said his trump thing was just a ruse to get people out of jail
and then the victims get even more harassed
honestly a part of me hopes this gets into the national/international news cycle so parents are more aware of uh, other aspects of conventions and esports
Even if he didn't consent, blackmail isn't a valid recourse
I do agree with all three parties getting removed
I don't really know the personas that much ~~Except Yink, who's been a friend of mine for 15 years,~~ I 'm just tired of kids getting hurt
At the start of this all coming out, someone floated the idea of banning people under 18 from these events, and I thought there had to be a better way, but at this point, clearly nobody's capable of watching the watchers and my mind keeps coming back to that thought
it's an acknowledgement that things might not be okay but you're interested in hearing the answer regardless
A better question might be "how are you doing" or "how are you holding up," as long as you're prepared for a potentially glum answer
you have to then realize you got that far last time, and you can do better next time
first step is to realize relapse isn't going backwards, it's a stumble going forwards - it's still a step on recovery
and nothing happened
it's that in most cases, not a small number of people knew
the most damning thing about these accusations isn't that they happened
I don't really have a great argument to the people who are proposing to just ban underage kids
yes
I still miss it
I dropped off my adhd medication when I was 23 and no longer covered by parental health insurance

I have no idea how the comment that Sherman didn't go far enough was supposed to be taken, but saying it's a shame there wasn't more genocide in the past, which is how I'm reading it, is not a take I think that should be expressed on the server
everyone does the dumb mistakes
Fizzy you're not a bad friend
the second dmjii pairing to break in the server <:KirikaQuiet:716004744358920303>
I think overall it was the right move
Yeah, I'm doing alright
> SECOND DMJii pairing breakup?
> What was the first?

I have a shirabe profile picture for a reason
it is possible to backstab someone and still rely on them, if you make calculated decisions
in the general case
capitalism revolves around being able to rely on others purely because everyone involved is in it for self-interest - you can rely on them, because if they do not do the action you expect them to take, it will go against their own self-interest. Whether this is because you're paying them or because you have the power to hurt them, you can still rely on them
Because betraying your friends, even in a game, is not something that's left behind and forgotten about in the game
The human behavior involved isn't, though
If you ever play the boardgame Risk, that's a pretty prime example: Backstabbing an ally has a very, very high game winning rate
Or to benefit so much from the greed that the people you upset cannot screw you over
I don't think we're close to worrying about it
VR currently can handle one sense well  (sound), one sense okay (sight), one sense badly (touch), one sense only in theoretical patents that have a lot of problems (smell), and one not even theoretically
On the other hand, we're probably in the terminal stages of late stage capitalism and might destroy everything anyway
As long as you can abide by the rules of the server, you're welcome here, regardless of your condition
also the idea that "we've done it this way, therefore it's the best way" is just a dangerous ideology in general
but it's a rather involved argument
yeah, I'm not sure I agree that it's possible to promote conservatism without being harmful
marriage between a man and a woman, anti-abortion also usually factor in
I'm going to scream when he still gets just as much of the poor vote
and it's not healthy
I've watched a friend bounce from relationship to relationship; I think the longest she was single in the last 2 years was 2 weeks
yeah, just take it slow and easy
but I think it's a bit of a stretch
I know people are trying to lay down a first amendment lawsuit against the twitch channel for deleting comments relating to anti-army statements on the basis that moderators are performing as employees of the government and therefore it can be claimed that it is actual censorship
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Army
Army's been trying to recruit through videogames for at least 15 years
they run propaganda
yeah, that's recruiting
yeah US Army has an esports branch
democrats probably feel they're protecting minorities
USA is not likely to get a second wave because the first will not end, correct
A mask that is
Europe is likely to get a second wave because almost no one wears one there
It was half-assed and people claimed victory too fast
it's definitely both, and there's lineage components you have to prove in order to qualify for certain things in the religion
fixations can be useful diagnostic information
apparently it's a fireworks factory, but wow
https://twitter.com/BNONews/status/1290678928093454336?s=20
yeah I've definitely seen it happen, but be wary of situations like that, because then your partner has control over you being homeless
I guess using x-rays is better though yeah
it's not *that* different
most of the energy gets absorbed by the air immediately around the nuke and turns into a conventional fireball and shockwave
still, yeah, we're at like 8-10% of a nuke here
oh whoops I'm wrong, it's actually not as good as tnt
there's a reason it looked like a nuke
this is a good fraction of that, and of an explosive with a bit better capability
that literally just means the same energy as 15,000 tons of TNT
the hiroshima bomb was 15 kilotons
as a reminder
So uh
If you dump enough energy in, yes
yes
<:ShirabeThink:461322366010654730>
so
rady is polish
even within those places, but even talking averages here
I do think that someone who says "I'm into asians" hasn't met that many asians because like, you go down the pacific coast and people look really different from place to place
and I want to pause here by saying if you've been doing this you haven't been performing some unforgivable sin - more that this is a chance to be better and make others less uncomfortable
if the answer is "all of the above" we're back to racism
it doesn't say whether you like a certain skin color, or a facial shape, or a body type, or a personality type
"I'm into asians" doesn't say anything about your preferences
yeah, that's the thing
getting told that your race is hot is like... uh, great, I did nothing about this except be born
You can give someone compliments on physical appearance or talk about it, but the ones that really count are the ones that a person can control and maintain
yeah
if it's something you'd never mention to someone who's asian, maybe ask yourself why you should be saying that at all
"do they talk to me just because I'm asian?" etc
It's kinda grody and colors interactions negatively after that
There's another flip side to telling people "I'm into asians" or whatever - consider how any of the target group feels when they hear people say that
Yeah, when you "like how asians look", you don't like how asians look, you like how a pictured stereotype in your head looks
you have no control over what they think you meant when you say something of that nature
the biggest thing about the previous topic is considering how other people hear it and use the information
it's a complex topic and isn't cut and dry
and that's why people consider it racist
"I'm into the stereotype of an asian person"
it's interesting that they seem "kinda" Asian
considering they are *fully* Asian
and exoticism, which is honestly almost a fetish in itself
as an example of association
white fever in other parts of the world definitely has a lot to do with social associations of wealth or other things
~~well, there's the implicit "I don't like non-white people"~~
people from tibet look really different from people from korea
the fact that "europeans" don't have association of looks but "asians" do, despite both being equally diverse, is kind of part of why there is an issue here
that's kind of the point rady
small, or worse, submissive and demure and polite
you can't enter a conversation assuming your definitions match with stuff like this
blanket terms only work if everyone agrees what you mean
There is no "to be completely fair" about pursuing people from a culture because you think they're easy to boss around, jesus
fuck off with that anand, I do not want this discussion to be "WELL ACTUALLY RACIST BELIEFS HAVE A POINT SOMETIMES" right now
I've run into people on more than one occasion who like asian girls because they're supposed to be "demure" or "quiet and submissive"
I'd argue it's *still* bad, because it's unclear if it's even talking about physical or cultural stereotypes or what
because the other person is trying to *guess* what stereotype you *have*
And the counter point is that it's a bad frame of reference because you have *no idea* what you just put in their head
and even that's not fair because of course everyone in those countries looks different
Koreans, thai, tibetans and indonesians all look really different
you're not even *communicating what you like*
that's honestly another reason why that kind of language is a problem - your stereotype isn't someone else's stereotype
instead of the part where you reveal you just treat everyone from that part of the world as looking a way they don't
okay then you should have started at that point in the discussion
iirc the exact origins of the term was because people used to respond to images of Bridget from Guilty Gear with Admiral Akbar image macros
exactly
yeah!
It's not a positive term even aside from people using it horribly
and if you think about it for two seconds, traps, outside of the shitty context, are never good to come across
but the point is it's always been a shit term
no obviously it's a shit term now
like even if you don't accept that the word was a slur, the very idea behind it is offensive to gay men
"trap" refers into the fact that you are "tricked" into being gay, and it was a thing to mock
it was never ever made in good taste
okay as someone who was on 4chan when the word was coined
good for them
subreddit's mods are trying to do the right thing
it's banned on this server because it hurts people and it's not unreasonable that it hurts people
I don't think I realized that compassion had more value than being a memelord until like 24
I hope it does
While you're not wrong, Aria, you sometimes phrase things in a way that puts everyone on the defensive because it comes off as almost an indictment that the understanding isn't coming from us, that the love and support isn't coming from us
gambling is terrifying
jeez really
it's possible they'll drop the charges before going to court but even so publically they're kind of ruined
not exactly how the japanese system works
> remember, innocent until proven guilty
if you struggle that much, a respiratory illness is almost certainly going to kill you
generally speaking people who have medical trouble with a mask have complications that they *really should not* be in environments where exposure is possible, anyway
It's been 5 or 6 years and I still think of Fluffer's last night sometimes
Sorry to hear that
seems reasonable really
I know from another friend that plurality can make it more complex
I'll admit I didn't know either, but yeah, it makes complete sense
however, they're also the one who takes the loss if the business doesn't work out
in exchange the franchiser gets a cut and certain oversight ability, but overall the franchisee gets more profit than if they were just a local manager
also the rights to use their branding and advertisement
the idea behind a franchise is that people or companies can open a restaurant, and then pay a brand to give them equipment, recipes, and access to their supply chain
correct
https://twitter.com/dpinsen/status/1295483079662997504
and the time between you recalling the event will increase
but the emotions tied to the memory will dull with time
you won't ever forget
but time's the only true solution
you can try to pair bad memories with good ones
time
Focus should be given  on giving everyone identical opportunities, even if that  means  giving some people more resources  than others
People are not born equal and are never going to be born equal, it's never going to be correct to treat everyone identically
I wish for equity
I don't wish for equality
no
just a notch
you don't have to tone it down all the way
Shemmy tone it down a notch
This server is not a welcome space to alt-right ideas
Also, please just drop the useage of the term "cultural marxism" - it's so conflated in alt-right buzzwords that I'm going to ask that you find a new way to talk about whatever you want to talk about, though I want to let you know that while I'm permitting this discussion as a learning opportunity
you're quite ignorant of extensive nuanced debate if you think that's what the discussion of racism is about, rather than structural oppressive  strategies baked into society
thank you, emily
Yeah
And as the others point out, both need aid
becuase a rich african american kid will still get hired less
That's horribly inefficient and also  incorrect
because those resources need to be used to help others instead
you need to give some groups *less* help
you need to give some extra help
if you give every single person equal resources without critically thinking about their situation, some will suffer more than otehrs
equality kills people, you want equity
no one else has to listen to you or give you a platform
however, free speech is only protection against government
free speech matters
if sufficient alt-right talking points  are  parroted adjustments will be made, without the namecalling
make your point, but clean up your rhetoric
Shemmy please don't make me give you a warning
There's always going to be institutions that prevent or merely divert progress so that they may benefit
The biggest problem is that there's no straight path from A to B in any country for this
it isn't giving everyone the same opportunity, it is treating everyone  equally
that's what equality is
Equality is treating everyone equally
on this topic, at least
I think we've reached a decent equilibrium of understanding here
just never tell anyone else they should be saying  "too"
If you want to say Black Lives Matter too I think that's fine
so good night, but I don't want to see this again
I am not going to let you repeatedly bring up white racism in this server
You don't have an extended amount of time to discuss this in this server, as a warning
Goodnight
Trying to provide equity isn't racism
"reverse discrimination"  is a rhetoric tool of the people you're trying to fight against
As long as you fixate on white racism you're hurting progress towards your ideal rather than helping it
don't pound a dictionary and say "wrong!!!"
scholars have put a looooooot of effort into understanding the nuance behind racism
I've been victim to *actual* oppression  due to my gender
I've been the victim of selective policies due to my race, but it is not racism
it's not perfect, but it's a stepping stone to get somewhere better
Right now, addressing demographics and boosting some groups at the slight expense of others is one of the best, imperfect tools we have to give people opportunities
I think these are all really strong improvements and I'm proud of you
permanent heart trauma etc
like 70%
death rate is low, but permanent, or at least months-long complications seem to be sky high
> Well recovery rate is 99.96% according to a recent CDC statistic that I saw recently that the news doesn't want to report
not because others might have it, but because we might
that's honestly why we wear masks
I mean the safest way to protect people *is* to assume everyone might have it, including yourself
look at europe
we'd be past this
you know if we actually had closed everything down
No, we can absolutely live like this for the next 2 years or so if needed, caution doesn't equal fear
when there's a large faction who wants to reopen everything full blast so line can go up
It's obvious, but it's a huge argument over maintaining quarantine and health measures until at *least* next year
I have seen articles warning that covid patients are at high risk for flu deaths
We haven't had a cold season since covid panic started, and cold/flu seasons haven't been news for several years
About a month ago, yeah
They're now reporting to white-house led agency who magically is reporting a recovery
Previously? Hospitals were reporting to them
because CDC no longer has accurate numbers
Also all information from the CDC in the last month is unreliable
how about we try for maximum control of the problem and then if it's not as bad we're feeling relieved
You're kidding, right? healthy athletes are having careers cut short from permanent respiratory issues, teens are having new heart problems they didn't have before after catching it, people are hospitalized for 2 months, and we should just assume it'll get better and "take it with a grain of salt"?
for every person that dies, expect 4 more to be heavily affected by that death, either emotionally or financially
1% is many
1% is not a few
because that also fucks your economy
it's also utilitarianism to keep your working population from dying
Because, believe it or not, if it's the states fault, it's their fault for listening to people who say exactly what you've been saying
"people aren't upset enough about death" "covid is an overstated agenda" "death is normal we should be fine with this" "it's the states fault, why aren't you more mad at them" 

You've literally had several conflicting statements to argue over in the past hour and I'm officially giving you a warning for disruptive trolling here, this is ridiculous
at this point it's starting to really feel like you're shifting goalposts
yes, people do this, people have been blaming florida and such for the last 6 months
(PS: Line will go down if 3.8 million people die)
it's "is it okay to murder 3.8 million people to make the line go up"
so the question isn't "is death natural"
Letting someone die when you could have prevented it is murder
worse, even
3.8 million people dying will *still fuck the economy*
1% is 3.8 million people, in the US
dude
They shut down too late and reopened too early
that's not how it works
tha's
no
They managed to keep people safe and keep businesses from collapsing
If the justification is great enough, I'm okay paying it off for a while, yes?
same thing works for larger project financing
Yeah, well, when you buy a new car, there's ways to pay it off without having 60,000 dollars up front
that's where bonds come from
Or just borrowing it against the public
??? taxes???
most places don't even need masks now
no severe economic damage
Again, look at europe - their governments paid the living expenses of everyone during the shutdown
interesting
hmmm
No, that really seems to be what you were saying
is your stance really that it's fine to kill someone if it turns out later they had a record
you're not being sarcastic?
wait
police unions <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
great depression is probably a better guideline of what a collapse would be like
this is the right place yes
rather than, like, fallout
oof
I wanna see if Kaiyo's results are different, and if so, how much so
I've been impressed at the good discussions here lately, lots of stuff that doesn't have right answers but have had people with interesting things to contribute
And yeah I think "lol we can't speak it" makes it easier to be brushed over by these people
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> the fact YouTube failed to properly deal with a channel does not make how they dealt with leafy inappropriate
I think a mindset to look for happiness helps.
as yumi said, it's about deciding what needs it and what doesn't
keep in mind "never complain" is not the answer and will just get you locked into abusive relationships
unless you're going to school to become like, a real estate agent, the economy's fluctations should only have a moderate impact on your career planning
My technique is generally more of a "flirt loudly, but make them wonder if you mean it"
this isn't really something easily learned though
I used to think that advice was solid but I really gotta be honest - while at some point you need to be loud and direct, a lot of early courtship sometimes works best if there's "is she? isn't she?" games going on
The better you are at reading people the better you can adjust your tactic but also at the end of the day someone who needs an approach way different than your normal self probably isn't a great fit
I think my best advice is try to actually have a fun conversation before you hit them with the coffee date or whatever
I remember with boys you kind of have to be more restrained about it, but also it was way more obvious when someone was trying something
I don't even remember what it's like to date boys anymore, the rules and expectations are all different for wlw stuff

<@481518367845646346> 

Medical personnel have been spending 10 hours a day in them for like 50 years, it's fine
masks are wonderful tbh
I mean, really, I look back at the british student named cho chang and wonder how I didn't see these things when I was a kid
rowling: i know writers who use subtext and they're all cowards
I feel like over long term rupert murdoch might be the most destructive human being I can think of
I'm not convinced, though; in the last few decades being a democrat or republican has become a borderline religion or patriotic affiliation
but then one dies and the other gets big
maybe the republicans in the next decade
we'll probably see it with the democrats in the next three decades
yeah, once in a while a major party splinters
which is why people talk about it.
yeah but that issue's probably harder to change than the voting system
but you really cannot ignore the impact that the bad voting system has on deadlocking the system the way it is
america isn't completely decided by a voting system, of course.
There are other reasons it's like that, too
I mean. Yes.
The only thing that could change is some major zeitgeist which doesn't. happen. Money prevents that.
FPTP prevents new parties from gaining hold
It is, because it's preventing it from changing
I'm really just unsure why you're pressing so hard that third parties can exist
yes, they exist, but also yes, their vote system sucks just as bad and destroys just as many political parties as usa
I think you're not doing a very good job of listening but okay
the fact that the 3-party mometum exists doesn't change that
I don't think there's really a point here - FPTP pushes away from a 3-party equilibrium to a 2-party stalemate
especially if both sides continue to run on "anyone but the other guy"
I'm fairly certain that getting rid of FPTP would enable other third parties to gain traction regardless of media fixations
it's bad, but don't fall into the trap of thinking "center is best because both sides are bad"
again, we saw this with weed
Ownership and management would inevitably move to become more of an upper middle class thing where they don't want to risk losing it all to legal punishments
as opposed to now, where they have zero rights
I mean, you put in rules and regulations and they become employees with rights
> Legal prostitution still involves human trafficking, brothels should be cracked down on. What consenting adults do in their own bedrooms is one thing, organized sex work attracts pimps and grifters no matter if it's legal or not.
 isn't this like the weed thing where it's waaaaaay easier to regulate and check in on it if everyone's doing it legally and as a registered business? I feel this is a weak argument
thanks meiyi
> The article is an unsubtle propaganda piece with bad faith writing

this sums up all of sankaku's articles that aren't complaining that the west censored underage vaginas
Please never link anything from there again; nothing they post approaches real journalism and the entire site's target audience is people who do not belong on this server
Oh I didn't see sankaku complex article got linked here
Gorisch is surprisingly kind on it
Like trans rights etc
They didn't have a majority on a lot of issues
I'm sorry, that's literally fucking nothing compared to the current news.
Can we not discuss that right now?
This is literally the most significant presidential power and Trump has gotten to use it 2, maybe 3 times, and most presidents use it 1 or 0 times.
> Does it make it... much worse than it has been?
<@203444794737950720> 
Trump is scary for a maximum of 8 years (God willing)

This is scary for 40.
rather than "I like trump" that means "I hate change and worship the constitution as a document"
when an SC justice is "conservative"
Aside *maybe* from Kavanaugh and whatever new guy gets put on, they're extremely aware that decisions made on this go beyond trump
I don't think so
right now it's "I was just joking lol"
it's possible he could give an EO removing biden from the ballot but I really, really think he'd lose a lot of the right that likes law and order
but it's really questionable if he can give you an EO telling you you have to cross the street because he said so
the most binding part about them is obviously he can give an EO that mandates a change in some federally run program, because he's in charge of all federally run programs
like, it's not really clear if disobeying one is illegal
it's questionable how binding EOs are
It's a depression/anxiety thing where your own thoughts make your state worse and worse
If anything, less shots to the head means you might be better at the job

I'm turning this back off
incredible
trump going to try to swing over swine flu
really
while people who do not have privilege are *scared of other people* and rely on the state to keep those other people off of them
it's my experience that libertarians are generally people who have significant amounts of privilege, because they're scared of the state
to enforce this.
yes, this is why federal laws are formed
the rhetoric of "human rights are automatically granted and inalienable" is complete bullshit unless steps are taken to stop the majority from enacting its will on the minority
unless it's a law (or economically adviseable for them)
health insurance has the right to not cover trans procedures
unless it's a law
doctors have the right to refuse care of transgender people
I advise you rethink your position.
**unless it's made into a law**
Everyone also has the right to fire transgender people because they don't like them
yeah, no, it doesn't work like that
which
the majority of federal transgender protections is *supreme court rulings* right now
> If someone brings up a question of "what about Transgender rights" the response is "They already had those, and dont need to ask the government"
<@!255412045933969408> 
hi, going to be frank: 
we don't have them, they're not federal law, don't throw us under the bus thanks
I think the more important thing to realize is that his feelings do not deserve priority over your feelings when it's this severe
sometimes it's a lot more mild and subtle
You do not have to be sobbing all the time or look like you belong on an album cover to be 'grieving correctly'
https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1308209927274536961
I'd argue it's racist in the cultural appropriation way of racism rather than the "fuck these people in particular" kind
the dignity of the country/office should be last on your list
out of all the things to complain about
like, going to be real chief
that was kind of his point
I really do not agree that it would be just the same
it would be more normal, mitigated, republican evil
I've been sitting here watching this "pence will be worse than trump" rhetoric for 4 years and I really do not think we'd have the same degree of unmitigated evil and absolute bottom of the barrel foreign relations that we currently have if pence was there
Trump's honestly been as effective as he has been because he's done a lot of borderline illegal shit, I think pence would follow more career politician lines which would limit the damage
okay so much for that loophole
it's two terms that they served for two years or more on
oh
is it two *full* terms?
though I wonder what the wording on the number of terms you can have is
but I would definitely take 8 of pence over another 4 of trump, and I'm someone he specifically hates
and pence could be a problem for sure
it's not an impossible scenario
you'd have to find a regressive judge, which are rarer, and most of the rest of the bench isn't regressive
(hence the word 'conservative')
honestly, conservative judges are more likely to leave in place past decisions
that was a supreme court decision
the executive branch does not have the power to 'undo gay marriage'
pence isn't good enough to whip people up, but he's good enough to carry the torch 20 feet to the finish line
People who are ready to vote for trump are, in large part, not going to decide to just not vote and let biden win now
vastly higher, lectric
it's almost a guarantee
Pence will comfortably win if Trump dies, since he'll lose not too many fanatics and pick up all the never-trumpers
it's a very bad idea to utterly destroy the next most likely to win candidate, especially if you think that the DNC is paying big money for you to not win
that's less about seeming nice and more about a risk assessment of foreseeing if you're likely to actually lose everrything imo
because it's incredibly important to the democratic party that they seem like the "nice guys"
pretending to be a sheep is why trump can get away with everything
respectability politics is bullshit and the sooner you realize that having your first objection being that someone is rude or uncouth about policy-making is the most dangerous reaction you can have, the sooner you can be a betterr voter
it means you can be a sociopath and people will smile and let you
facade of care is more dangerous than lacking it
I think you should seek to abolish the binary rather than abolish the concept
Imagine trying to understand math without ever labelling numbers
Sometimes you need language and descriptors to better understand abstract concepts
gender is equally a way for someone to understand themselves as it is for others to understand others
Lectric, people were getting very frustrated at you because you attempted to tell everyone that their perceptions of gender that they'd spent their lives working on was wrong and harmful, without any attempt to understand nuance. I realize there was no malice, but I think it's inappropriate to try to tell people off for ganging up on you in this circumstance, particularly when people were attempting to share understanding with you, giving you the benefit of the doubt.

Something like gender is very nuanced and complicated, and while no one in this server has the right to harass you, if you drop an opinion in this channel that gender is harmful, everyone has the right to respond to that argument, particularly when your claim dismisses others' self identity.
yuck
but, more seriously, this is... a mess
I still miss Ray
man with Ryan gone the AH dream team's really fallen apart
Monty was also heavily involved with a few seasons of Red vs Blue
aw Ryan
if someone's bad at reaching out to others, you're likely just ending a functional friendship for no reason
yeah
Additionally, if you do that kind of thing, it's not going to solve a core problem - you're just going to need another example of proof in a few weeks/months and do something else melodramatic to get them to prove they care and give you that hit of attention/endorphins you need
Leave because you don't want their company, leave because you need space, but don't leave just to make them prove they care
> Leave and see if they contact you I guess?
going to second that this is a bad way of handling relationships - if you establish the relationship is about chasing you down, that's either manipulative or destructive, depending on how you look at it. It's a two way street. If you have concerns, try polite and open communication
they won't be first
if they fall because of it
America's going to be one of the last ones off the resource cliff
Keahi's position was about as sociopathic as the CEO who's happy that they're selling the business to someone who's going to cut 90% of the jobs because they get a comfy seat on the board or whatever
yeah, some do that
anyway most public speakers don't wear masks and I think that's fine because it's pretty easy to isolate you from anyone while on podium
seal your borders, be ruthless in containment, it's doable
it's really not that hard to believe there's no rona in it
user complaints inform mod decisions
the tweet's from apr 17, probably from evil democratic governor who keeps the shutdown going in the middle of the pandemic
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130
or is that just a myth
there are tax benefits to the current situation, aren't there?
honestly for the reasons Raiden just said I don't think PR will be given national voting rights as is
yeah, maybe, but I don't think that'll happen unless we get that interstate voting pact
oh, I see, you're talking about a non-PR solution but just overhaul the college in general
which means it's effectively impossible
pretty sure that's an amendment
Hispanics tend to lean republican, it's really hard to say
why bother
the platform would be dying though
you could
and no one will be able to download it
ever
if it doesn't go through, the app will still function but no longer update
(probably)
if it goes through, then it's not an issue
but moving on from this, here's the reality: currently, tiktok only has one more month to live, unless the deal to sell it goes through
probably not, but it possibly is, and no, it probably doesn't - the likelihood that the chinese government would use it to attack you, specifically, is near zero - the threat is more likely that it would be used in more broad attacks or attempts to undermine
unsafe to who
the ban is a national security measure, and one I don't think is totally unreasonable, and tiktok is in the process of getting offloaded to a company with far fewer questionable ties so that it can continue to internationally function
ByteDance, Tiktok's parent company, is heavily attached to the chinese government, and you can honestly do a lot worse for an espionage network than an app installed on everyone's phone that has access to personal information
I think people who say people will suffer as much under biden as they do under trump are not part of very vulnerable groups
they rarely have actual plans of how to accomplish anything
it's not like green's an amazing party
I'd rather you didn't quote any lines
Aria I think you need to take a break
in the current political climate, if someone is voting a third party, they weren't going to vote for one of the other two regardless - the logic that they cause trump is juvenile
I would think that out of everyone, you would understand the need to use language that doesn't come across as an attack, Aria.
This isn't a venting channel, be more careful in the future.
I'm not even slightly a democrat
Rather, you burst out with a "fuck you" before they did.
You did not.
No.
Please take a step back
there's nothing that fits what you're describing
Aria I just scrolled back through the last month in this channel
that doesn't automatically translate into attack
People are allowed to be unhappy with your decision Aria
As I said, it's a privileged position, but it's also not something you should attack someone over
It's more effective than abstaining from voting, and nobody has the right to compel someone to vote for them just by existing
but it is far more accurate than calling it a vote for trump
there is a point to them
Calling it a spoilt ballot is not hate
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but this is known
yeah, 3rd parties are just a fancy form of spoilt ballot
Your initial argument was that people shouldn't be criticized for voting otherwise and you then proceeded to argue that point for so long it really looked like you were saying that voting dem is wrong
some people are casting their votes on the platform of "this decision will least result in me dying"
It's absolutely your right to vote for a third party and anyone who says you shouldn't is out of line, but it is also a position of privilege to do so
Yeah, again, I'm going to say that people who advocate voting for third parties in this election are not part of super vulnerable groups - and no, I'm not talking about the poor, I'm talking about targetted demographics
you're the one who keeps wanting to talk about why trump won
Lankpants I get that you're upset about stuff but you've been redirecting conversation from adjacent topics into "I want to complain about the democratic party" for basically the whole day
that, or they have a habit of hyperbole that they should work on and tone back
Yes, it's placebo.
I'm going to be blunt: I've skimmed the chat. What lines you consider an attack are not relevant, because the only things that were attacked in this conversation were ideas and stances in the general, not in the personal.

If you are not willing to be challenged, if you are not willing to hear that people dislike your ideas or ideals without feeling personally attacked, this is not a channel you should be spending time in.
I'd rather this be resolved
https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1317594466698645504?s=19

Just in case someone is still on the fence about the whole "is he fascist" thing
you can't make a law and then say that you broke the law 6 years ago, but you can make a law and say you're currently in violation of it
marriage isn't a single act, it's a continual contract
I'm not sure it's really post de facto though
whether it can be retroactively made illegal would be up to the state lawmakers, if the supreme court rules that it's not constitutionally protected
depends if the law that makes it illegal has a grandfather clause or not
this typically is only used in cases of incest
if they're against the law, they can be annulled
the government already has the power to annul marriages
possible doesn't mean likely
but it's possible state courts could do it after the supreme court made a statement
there's no grounds for annulment from the supreme court
take this with a grain of salt, but it's interesting
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so
okay, after doing research, it doesn't meet the legal definition of a contract - and one primary reason why is that the state has the power to alter the conditions at will
perhaps they'll have trouble annulling them
so
this is a different category from a voidable marriage, which I don't think this would fall under
https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/void_marriage
in my state, at least, marriage is a civil contract
The state is in flux
every 4 years the commander of all the military is up for rotation
I mean, they do
Funny, I didn't know we called elections civil war
it is in most ways a state
I mean, it is frequently not in every way a state
it's anarchists who struggle with the idea that they could be called a state, not the other way around, so if they rename it to avoid their own problem it's fine
no actually it's the other way around nuker
There are now millions of people in america cheering for the leader of the country to continue defying the rule of law, including stuff like "twelve more years" - I'd say this was a symbol of decay of the ideal of a liberal democracy
I mean, we're *not maintaining it*
the solution to have one person decide things is a very easy concept to arrive at
Many people arguing produces inefficiency and waste
Really? Because it's quite easy for many to envision more forceful alternatives
Indoctrination will not be one hundred percent effective
Exile? Imprisonment? Remove their ability to exercise force?
And then, even assuming you deal with external threats, how do you deal with the second generation? They will not all share the vision
I just think it's inevitable that the force consolidates
correct
So it sounds like you either get too little force or witch hunts
It takes one person with charisma to go from anarchism to a traditional state
anarchism doesn't seem stable, it seems metastable - it'll work until there's a slight force, internal or external, and then collapse
> I do think a discussion on whether humanity should be preserved over humans is a required part of any examination over economic management and stuff like high research
I didn't say it was a quesiton of primitivism
if you could colonize mars or even alpha centauri, but the cost was the depletion of earth's resources and the lowering of the quality of life of generations to come, insert ethics question here
no, not exactly
I do think a discussion on whether humanity should be preserved over humans is a required part of any examination over economic management and stuff like high research
it's really about what level of the hierarchy of needs you prioritize, I think
which is at least a novel way to answer it
their answer is mankind has no need of it and should not be pursuing it
the anprims in particular have an interesting answer for your particle accelerator question
ancap, ancom, and anprim are all extremes of the ideas thrown around for it
the hardest question to answer is what's the economic regulation mechanism going on and anarchism as a wide-set ideology does not even come close to agreement on it
like, for example, the YMCA wouldn't just stop existing
organizations can exist within an anarchist state
the USSR accomplished quite a lot of research that didn't have immediate application use
(though this does bring up the question of what happens if a community decides to do something that has negative externalities on other communities or the globe as a whole, which is an interesting question - if there exists a federal level that can forbid such an action, I'd argue it's not really much of an anarchy)
some are better than others, but if there is a winning solution, there's almost certainly more than one
it's like saying one country's constitution is the "right" way to do it
if you can think of a solution that would work, there you go
there's no "anarchist plan"
There isn't an answer to that
kinda like how new zealand does not need nearly the same organizational depth as the US
the number of steps would presumeably depend on population size and need
I don't see why the number of steps particularly matters, for the record - 2 is the same as 20 in terms of "Does it work or not"
The idea, I think, is organizational hierarchy without power hierarchy
<:catsip:656050349399998464>
If you wanted to, you could have every single policy decision up for public vote with our current technology
if you're going to argue its merit, do that seperately from asking for clarification
yeah, okay, but you were trying to clarify what it was
It's certainly possible for smaller populations of up to a thousand or so
I am not advocating for it because I don't think it's possible, but, in theory, it exists
there is a metastable position of cooperative rule
You do not automatically end up with multiple states
The state *always* has the monopoly of violence because the monopoly of violence *defines it as a state*
Nuker, you're coming in here and muddying the conversation through your own misunderstandings and then saying everyone else is misunderstanding stuff
I mean, I highly support that because it's the best path to dismantling the electoral college
if you do it for some other reason you have to give up seats
the fourteenth amendment even lists ways you *can* remove a citizen's right to vote without impacting your population count for the house of representatives
but then, it's pretty openly known that the US doesn't let some citizens vote - many states forbid current or even former felons from voting, and Florida passed a bill recently saying you can't vote until you pay your fines or something iirc
but not that you cannot do it
14th amendment does not explicitly grant permission to vote, but says what happens when a state forbids it, and the 15th says that you can't deprive the right to vote for a variety of reasons
on a closer look I think I see the point
> I just learned that US consitition doesn't actually grant right to vote
<@!203444794737950720> 
does it not? you might need to explain your point a bit more, I was pretty sure the 14th and 15th amendments were pretty clear on it
the public picks people who decide policy for them, and those people have no commitment to actually doing what people will think they will do
the public does not decide policy, at all
yeah it's worth noting that democratic republics are very, very much not democracies in one way
anarchists have generally been reformists at one point and have firmly given up on a partisan democratic republic ever giving them what they want
probably because the current problems that exist really really bother you and threaten your life
because then you get the president of the united states gassing innocents in order to have a photo op
I mean, yeah
~~Anarchists do not have a unified voice on what force looks like in an anarchy other than, "not that"~~
In our "democracies," you have no input on what the soldiers of your country do
the key concept in anarchism is what happens to the force attached to the state
Technically Rady is describing a democratic republic and not a democracy
in terms of a human cost
like, any anarchic society would have to ask themselves how much science is worth, how much art is worth
yes
can't change it because there isn't a unit people use, and there isn't a unit people use because it hasn't been changed
Your phone could be updated without much effort to show new co-ordinates, but there's plenty of devices that are not prepared for regular firmware updates
If the moon is ever decently developed, there *will* be a launch cannon on it, because a mass driver is just so economical there
space elevators might be attractive one day but their downsides have been explained, along with the need of magic materials we still don't have
anyway, regarding launch systems - the g-forces earth-based cannons generate make them unattractive for many, many payloads. It's high enough that it's not just organic payloads that have a problem. Launch loops or skyhooks are probably ideal, though both have problems if they fail
you will be literally changing the co-ordinate system everyone uses for location on earth
you're also redoing all gps systems
more than redoing all charts
so, unfortunately, that's a little hard to rectify by just switching units and getting used to new names/conversions
the numbers just crunch easier when you're marking a chart by hand
the main reason is knots, because the nautical mile is basically the building block of our modern lat/long co-ordinate system
circling back to imperial vs metric for air and sea use
if you don't want to talk about it, it's probably easiest to just not hit enter on a message
You are not required to share your reasons for voting or not voting, but making an issue of not talking about it is just going to annoy people
if you cannot draw a line on what ideologies can be spread on your website, the most toxic and hateful will spread more than the good
I spent a few years of my life on 4chan and that was enough of that concept
I wouldn't be on a social media platform that doesn't have the ability to censor
when it comes to censorship
especially since simple solutions run into the scunthorpe problem
simple solutions have no justice, no nuance, and no humanity
I don't agree at all
a call for violence was policy and not an unpopular one
If you're upset with that particular war, look more at the 2002 effort against al-qaeda
but I think a lot of people would disagree
I'd be fine censoring it because I'm not for extranational intervention
I mean, sure
what if something like 2003 comes about and there's a discussion on whether to assault iraq or not
that metric doesn't work
advocating for genocide is a political opinion
it depends on the political opinion
I mean
You probably won't get pulled over unless they're looking for a reason to pull you over
Are you missing both front or both rear?
Glad to hear you didn't get hurt cocoa
I think I'm the last one to have contact with her - the best understanding we have is that she's in the hospital, "safe and stable" in the words of her mother, and that the note is probably a scheduled tweet she could not cancel because she was not given possession of her phone
No, we're definitely not sure
It's the sign that your body isn't winning, basically
It means the infection is spreading and you may be looking at septic shock in the next day or two
tldr this isn't a problem at all and you'll be fine, but if you see a red line, get urgent care
I have a slight ingrown on my toe and it's generally responsible
Yes, your toenail can provide the cut
And as a final note
If you have an immune disease this may not apply
At that point in my experience it resolves quickly
Once it starts leaking pus I'd gently push all the pus out and wipe the toe with rubbing alcohol (and bandage it if you're super worried)
It'll be sensitive and you might limp for a bit but your body should take care of it
I wouldn't see a doctor unless you see a red line going from it, but at that point it's urgent care
I've had toe infections like a million times
like, nicotine should *probably* not be legal in my opinion
that said the high addiction rate does need to be considered
yeah, I was going to say, there's dozens of prescribed opioids
most other are harmful
marijuana was made illegal because it harms the textile industry
also yes most illegal drugs should stay illegal
decriminalization does nothing for selling the drugs, fyi - that will still ruin your life
But not overprescribinf is a preventive measure
You could state they're not being effective or they're putting their attention in the wrong place
That's a fallacy
There's always time to make a new immune strain
I think you missed the point
There's a lot of discussion about superbugs over here
That sounds like a disaster
I hope they don't do preventative antibiotics
The main treatment for it is antibiotics and they don't use them anymore if they don't need to
Also, there's a really good chance they'd say "come back if it has a red line"
I'd recommend not paying for a visit - advice generally isn't free - for what's basically an upgraded scrape
it has to do with the fact that at the time, if the government came to force you to do something with a gun, you had access to the exact same kind of gun
the second amendment has nothing to do with police response
pretty sure we have laws for alcohol that already cover that yeah
people need someone to take care of promotion and logistics, not every prostitute is a self-made business person
I think brothels and escort services are really just inevitable if you want it to actually function and be regulated
legalizing sex work would save a **lot** of lives
legalizing brothels is far from the craziest idea you could have
I'd argue that any highly addictive substance or behavior isn't harmless by nature
but the discussion of "should people be allowed to turn their brain into a skinner box" is a difficult one
with 1 being the narrowest category
Statistics show that people generally own either 0, 1, or 4+ guns
Gun ownership is severely skewed
*so many* guns out there
there are
if america tried to move to that system - not that it would be easy, as two thirds of congress would have to agree to it and 3/4 of states - there'd be little results for probably a full generation, maybe two
It is worth noting that there's likely to be a big trump spike today, and then biden may catch back up with mail ins
This is currently looking like 2016 again
Trump is currently in the lead for ohio
Here's basically the best readout of how things are
https://twitter.com/FiveThirtyEight/status/1323813550385729541?s=19
It's overwhelmingly clear there's two wildly different kind of Republicans now
Yeah both are ready to die tbh
Repubs would have to be less conservative to survive
Remember that states have more rights as a whole than the individuals inside them do
I don't know if it could effectively be overturned without a very assertive bench - you would be telling the states how they have to vote, which goes against state rights pretty severely
On paper it works to transform it into a popular vote
Yeah
But there is a way to short-circuit it and defeat the concept while playing in the rules
Actually changing it involves 2/3 of congress and 3/4 of states to decide to change it
But that is how it is
I do not enjoy the idea that someone's vote is worth 3 of mine
Yes.
Because well over half the population is in urban areas, so voting wouldn't represent the needs of the rest of the country... Is the argument
The counter argument is the cities win
So they don't count as much in total, though each person in them counts for more (sometimes 3x as much) than say a californian
Low population states
There's always a lot of red as the winner
Lectric, I hope you get answers and I think things aren't as bad as you fear, but this isn't really designed as a venting channel.
Also that 10% estimate is no longer right, models are now showing a closer race
(tie is a loss)
34, 270's already a majority, the tie is 269-269
last I checked, anyway
it's worth noting he's projected to win az and NE-02
it's going to be close for a few days
uber and lyft spent 200 million on that proposition to force the state to allow them to keep fucking their drivers over
he can still tie or win without az if he picks up pa
fuck, I guess you really can buy votes
Trump has a very possible path to winning
neat
https://twitter.com/NBCPolitics/status/1323822291688587264
Looks like AZ flipped blue and is also picking up a blue senator
Oh wow
> unless they somehow win the election without entering the debate or something
You do this by starting to win congress seats
I'd say 2-3 days if it's not close enough for recounts
yeah they've halted counting in several key states
yes
there is too much volume
I cannot go back and find articles read tonight
finding source is going to be on you, I'm afraid
most of the remaining votes are trump-heavy areas
who knows why Fox jumped in so early, but AP probably did it to piss trump off
From what I'm reading AZ probably shouldn't have been called
I might actually have preferred him to lose over trump
mcconnell won again, by the way
so every 2 years you've got *some* senate seats up for grab
A senate seat goes up every 6, but they're staggered
Every house seat goes up for election every 2 years
It's called a General Election for a reason
SC would never allow it, though they might theoretically allow throwing out votes that arrive after november 3rd
https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1323890404887068673?s=19
GA's knife edge
could be wrong
2 hour I think
what are you looking at
there's already been like 3 challenges on that
late arrivals are also *very* prone to getting tossed
aside from possible late arrivals which... I don't know if they're in the system or not
just not tabulated
mail-ins are part of the total votes - they've been received
yes
and whether trump manages to get them thrown out or not
whether the blue wave really is going to be big enough
it boils down to two things
biden's counting on the mail in votes being heavily blue in several states
it is *not* 90% now
because that model's already in pieces
are you talking about the projection from like two days ago
> Polls say Biden has 90% chance of winning, while all states he *needs* to win have ~3-5% lead for Trump
<@!203444794737950720>
Matthis leaving was pretty huge
Trump's had a lot of military quit on him
I actually am not convinced Trump has an army if he goes off the rails
nevada's a trip lmao
the margin is 110k votes


if PA flips, and I think it could, I expect it to be tied up for weeks in arguments and accusations of forged ballots
I am *heavily* oversimplifying, but that's the point here - wild cards come into play the longer we go
yes, the election was decided by the supreme court
2000 shows us that if you can drag your feet long enough anything can happen
Trump has a chance as long as a recount is possible
throw out all democratic votes
Insist all mail-ins are unfair and should be illegal
Ask all his voters to vote day-of
but yeah, he's finally playing the strategy his advisors have planned the whole time
if we don't finish above 1% difference, expect a demanded recount, and expect interference
his base has not changed
Trump is not a different person
why would it be?
while it's tense I haven't been disheartened, but I also didn't expect it to be different from 2016
ps, trump's party is celebrating the big red wave in miami-dade
also so the USPS could be sabotaged - apparently 15-27% of mail-in ballots in miami-dade got lost
The reason he told everyone to vote in person is so he could safely throw out mail-ins if the chance arrived
I mean, it's not Trump would blame, it's Trump's (or his advisors) been planning to blame it on the democrats
this is good though
https://twitter.com/NVElect/status/1323939478403076096
imagine if they both did
The rest of the votes to count are likely overwhelmingly blue but while NYT thinks there might be enough left, I'm seeing people doubt their estimates
pennsylvania is a lot of rural/mining/factory/blue collar area
most of the rust belt did
yes
ND's suuuuuuuper hard hit by covid
republicans get to fill it in with a temp until a special election, yeah
died from covid last month
one of the people voted into the ND state legislature
oh this is interesting
https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1323914087340781569
meanwhile
The country's been really split ever since 08 and the racists suddenly realized the left had gone too far
fig where have you been
and if it works, it basically cheats the broken system
It's got a good shot
just a small reminder that while far too many people do support trump, it's not *actually* close
https://twitter.com/BreeNewsome/status/1323840600874098690
hopefully we'll be pulling out alright from covid
coming off of a strong response to 9/11
I think
2002
but 2022 has some flippable seats
2 years of not doing anything
> and the Senate going red pretty much just 100% confirms that Biden won't do anything
the party will not put someone there willingly
you need someone anti-establishment
I dunno how easy this will be to replicate
yeah
though if it is 51 rep we'll get to see if collins *really* crosses the aisle or mcconnell just let her do that for campaign points
senate looks like it'll be 51 rep which means nothing will get done that needs the legislature for the next 4 years and I'll be hoping trump dies before 2024 rolls around
here's why AZ is a mess btw
that's dangerous
but only one?
if GOP has to fuck with 2-3 states to pull a win, that'll sap their efforts and I think they'll kind of fold
on biden's side, if trump hits 270 he takes it
because that's going to be a lot of dirty maneuvers
hopefully we don't land on 270 though
but it's hopeful
numerous news orgs aren't willing to call it yet
AZ's still shaky
the whole PA thing is now a back-up plan for if AZ doesn't turn up blue
MI and WI are really, really big
4 million more people voted for trump this year than in 2016
We have almost no evidence of republicans breaking rank to vote for biden
Final polling numbers suggests that may be less of a factor than initially thought
second most likely, NV being red, but most uncounted votes are from LV
imo trump's most likely way to victory right now is AZ coming out red
recounts tend to change the number by a few hundred
I'd also expect a recount
which is very unlikely
Trump's almost certainly losing MI unless he can somehow get votes that are already counted thrown out
they resist change
when it comes to justices, "conservative" tends to have a very literal definition
Gorisch is a really good example of this
but they do not have to worry about what the republican party thinks of them, and putting a conservative judge on the bench tends to mean you can't get away with doing shit that normally isn't allowed - it's a good way to halt progress, but not exactly the best way to enable your fascism
You can put someone on the court who shares some of your values and philosophy
appointees to the supreme court have no allegience to trump
I do think it is really, really important to stress:
no
suing for *anything* is legal, because it's just the process of bringing a question before a judge, "is this allowed, and if it's not, can I get restitution"
what do you mean legal, solo
there are expedited ways to get to a judge nuker
ah they want to throw out old ones too
> The Trump campaign also said that its in Michigan lawsuit demands that the campaign be allowed to ‚Äúreview those ballots‚Äù in Michigan ‚Äúwhich were opened and counted while we did not have meaningful access.‚Äù
biden would be the winner
if the count in every state was halted right now, btw
the state has the power to force electors to vote the way they've decided
in fact, with faithless electors, they've affirmed the opposite
It would 100% be challenged in court, but the supreme court would be really, really reluctant to tell states "you're not allowed to vote how you feel like" - that's the point of the electoral college
iirc Maine's doing it, it could have theoretically altered Collins' win but her opponent conceded
but AZ has said they plan to release results in about 6 hours, possibly earlier
I mean, NC's said they're not going to say anything for a week
there's reason to believe it doesn't default to biden
but, as you can see from my post
Normally, no
Fox got a *lot* of flak for jumping on it so early, and AP called it literal minutes after Trump said AZ was his in a speech
it means a news agency has looked at it, and is confident enough in its outcome that they are staking their reputation on it
so, "calling" a state doesn't actually mean anything in real, concrete terms
posted this earlier
he needs to hold AZ too
really excited to compare carter to trump to boomers though
incumbent advantage is huge, yes
While I think it's everyone's responsibility to vote, nothing good ever happens from forcing people to make decisions about shit they don't care about
thank god, no
but even so, people who are trending poorly in the hospital are more likely to skip a vote than your random person
it tends to be you're in an ICU for a bit
From my understanding, when you die of covid it does not tend to be rapid
for today, anyway
so I'd guess about 200-300?
so, 1130 deaths today, about half the population voted, and people who died from it were probably more inclined to not vote than vote because they're deathly ill
oh by the way, 100,000 us COVID-19 infections today, new record
MI was called when it had basically 100% reporting because it was so close
Most states that are called are unshakeable
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
yeah, it's just
Fox was... rather early.
they usually call them when it's mathmatically impossible or *extremely* absurdly unlikely to go the other way with the remaining uncounted votes
when you see 100% district reporting is when we have the finished count
generally, yeah
but it's not a slam dunk
this is obviously probably not the case
if 100% of uncounted votes are Trump, he would definitely win AZ
the election goes until *every vote is counted,* it's just usually by the final count, we already know who won
there is no legal element to it
"calling" is the news station saying "we are sure enough of this result to report the projection to you as a sure thing"
"calling" is a news thing
okay so uh
Not for sure going to happen, but everyone who said it shouldn't have been called by Fox and AP *said that for a reason*
Trump's closing it to flip back
Yes
yes
AZ's slowly trickling in, Trump's closing the gap as predicted
the electoral college makes for interesting drama, even if it's fucking awful
yeah, GA's close
https://twitter.com/JennyJarvie/status/1324166753962909696
no one's counting on alaska for anything, it not being called isn't a big deal
if it's a 270/268 victory, it almost certainly will
If Biden picks up like 3 states it probably won't
don't tell them they owe 500 dollars if they don't
If you want more voters, make people aware of the stakes, make people aware of their choices
Mandatory voting gets you bad/uneducated opinions, and bad opinions are more harmful than no opinions
even though you would think that these two traits would encourage voting
you seem really convinced that the average person who chooses not to vote is socially minded and educated
basically you want it so that trump's campaign has to eliminate two state victories to pull biden below 270
flipping it would be insane
it's already trump
take alaska off the table
I would really, really like to avoid sitting at 270
https://twitter.com/AIWashburn/status/1324161971248386049?s=19
he'll need nevada too
yeah, true
it's completely possible there was an ulterior motive in calling it
AP made their call minutes after trump bragged he had arizona in the bag in a speech
just like, if you made me guess, I'd say biden, but I'm prepared for it to flip
and not even like "really unlikely"
unlikely, but completely possible
it's completely possible to flip
To win Arizona, the ballot mixture has to be... about the same as what the ballot mixture was last night

just like PA and GA have a blue shift going on, AZ has a red shift
AZ's the major candidate for that

yes
the remaining votes to be counted are 50,000-60,000
the reported difference between Trump and Biden is about 18,000
Cypher
anyway
within *1%*, candidates can request a recount, but recounts don't really swing more than a few hundred
the difference is 10,000 votes
yes??
Because there's enough votes left
Incorrect
you may never wake up
GA also got closer
some PA votes trickled in and it got closer
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000> Waiting for results continues to be stressful
this system exists by this name in other countries, which is why people keep assuming you're talking about fines
I don't know what that phrase is, but mandatory voting is the fines, it is the jailtime.
if you want to make voting easier, if you want to let anyone vote without barriers, you're actually looking for a different phrase
and, more than that, to make it so really shitty people *never get voted out*, even more than what things are like now
it is a really good way to get really shitty people and really shitty policies in
mandatory voting is that it is the law that you must vote and that there is a punishment if you break it
mandatory voting *is* fines or jailtime
removing barriers to vote is not mandatory voting
PA is an auto win
yeah, I guess losing AZ and NV is a loss for biden if he doesn't pick up GA+something else
the win is 270-268
269-269 is the tie
yeah
your math is off
no
yes
are you counting the one nebraska vote
so that would be a trump victory, almost certainly
and there are more R-filled states than B-filled states
the tiebreaker is the house, but each state votes as a block in the house
*Biden* needs 270
the tiebreaker is massively trump-favored
269 is a trump victory btw
269-269 is a result
268-270 is a result
269?
trump needs one blue to flip and everything else to stay red
biden would win
in all states
if voting stopped right now
no he needs everything else too
there is no contest, no matched force
I mean, I feel 'stalemate' isn't a good description
but GA would need to be above dispute
with NV hopefully in the bag, GA would clinch it
Biden needs to be at 63% for the rest, and he's been ahead of that
GA's 13.5k votes apart right now, 50k ballots left to count
this was from yesterday iirc

probably trying to steer the republican party away from the clown populism
I am curious what Murdoch's plan is
especially if you're fox
it's another to be wrong about the overall winner
it's one thing to be wrong about a state

a lot of people are pretty sure the monarchy would dissolve the instant they actually used any of it
UK's crown is powerful on paper
most UK people have no real idea nor care who their MP is, at least from my experiences talking to them about it
they just vote for their rep to accomplish this
people almost never vote for their reps, they vote for the person the party says they're going to make PM
I mean, the UK functions the same way in practice
Ghost voters being those who lie what they'll vote on polls
New voters and ghost voters, though I'm not sure I buy the latter
I've been obsessively watching 538

(the whole "ignore the will of the people" thing is how the interstate compact is supposed to work to defeat the electoral college and restore popular vote)
it's *possible* but it's going to cause absolute chaos and probably a restructuring of government
but this is absolutely unheard of and is like the queen getting directly involved
there's a chance that the state assemblies could meet and could decide to ignore the will of the voters and appoint their electors outside of expected values
technically
so
I've already seen some Rs start to go "wait, hey, we control most state assemblies, what if...'
and until january 21st, it's *still* not really over
until the electoral college votes are cast, it's not over
the election doesn't actually happen until december 14th, which means there's plenty of time of fuckery to happen
some bad news for you

isn't GA the one where the governor won the election when he was in charge of running it
I expect counting is still happening, but the people who are updating are not around
is probably the honest answer
someone went to sleep
however
yeah, career military hates him, and a lot of POC are in the military
trump needs to win 54% of remaining votes, and a lot coming in is military
biden keeping GA is 50/50
I don't think NV will flip even in worst case
that was someone's worst-case projection
still like 10k military ballots
as a reminder GA can't be called yet
PA might end up as much as 3 points biden
yeah, PA and GA should make this a done deal
or less
like most states, GA has an automatic recount if the difference is 0.5%
whether they matter or not isn't really relevant
it's not going to change the election though
GA, that might actually be relevant
a few hundred or maybe a thousand vote difference
and they've already said they're going to do a recount
I believe there's still provisionals and military votes to check
100% isn't actually 100%
of those posts
but at least one is
my bet is half or less are real
you know this isn't real right
that is a required part of a concession speech
Trump will never concede and will push it to the electoral college vote on Dec 14th and will probably still contest it
there will never be a concession speech
and making it 269-269
I've had a nightmare the past few nights of a faithless elector breaking ranks
I'm glad we're not looking at 270-268 though
but there's nothing technically preventing it, much like the Queen directly interfering with UK politics
it's never been done before and would cause extreme chaos
trump could still win when states with GOP legislatures (like PA) vote to disregard the will of the people and assign red as electors regardless
*really* nasty
if things get really nasty
I mean
murdoch wants biden to win but doesn't want support behind him
this is interesting
~~I haven't been paying attention to it because it doesn't matter~~
oh you mean popular vote
2.7% where
it's just a waste of time and poor sportsmanship
but it forces the opponent to find them, and sometimes even progress down the tech tree to have flying units to shoot it down with
there's no way to win from this position, typically - while flying they can't use any abilities or produce any units or receive any materials
when losing, some poor sports lift off their final base and move it to a corner of the map
Terrans have a racial ability to have most of their buildings and structures lift off
yeah
never early GG

I think I've seen most shit in AZ worth seeing
yeah, NM is mesa land
still gorgeous though
whoops
oh wait that's AZ
stuff like the painted desert
very pretty though
new mexico is basically empty
most of the red ones are just farmland or unfarmable land
this is the rust belt
it's neither really conservative or liberal, it depends on what policies are being pushed
the rust belt is kind of towards the top right
port cities become trade centers, trade centers become financial centers
almost all the super urban centers are on the coast
as close to a law as you can get
the coast is blue, the flyover states are red, this has been pretty known
biden's team has said that they are confident they are able to escort trespassers out of the white house
recognize when you're doing it and refocus on your current activity
ask less "would I be happier doing something else" and ask more "am I enjoying this"
you need to stop wondering how green the grass is
it's not common
Florida was that close in 2000 or closer
news media are just seeing the margins close enough to be confident on it
it's looked like that for 24h tbh
you get to appreciate stuff more, like tourist traps and seeing how absolutely flat and full of nothing kansas is

Sorry to hear that, Aya
that's because the military hasn't been given an order yet
why is that worth encouraging an air of disregarding the election results
while true
yeah, it's under 6
they voted for trump, as it turns out
Pennsylvania reported they found a person using a dead relative to vote twice
Oh, yeah
Please stop spouting that off without understanding stastistical significance
It's not even unlikely
the % is literally "how many ballots in this stack of ballots voted this way"
they don't affect the %
voters who don't vote aren't counted
Also uhh
regions do vote 75% biden
what do you think it's going to look like?
let's say they count that batch of mail votes
let's say that trump urges you to not mail in, don't mail in, mail in can't be trusted, only do it in person
Let's say you're in a region that votes 75% biden
why???
the disproportionate votes were predicted, even
It's not statistically unlikely
Him telling proud boys to 'stand by' and never clarify that he meant 'stand down'?
Him stammering and being unable to get the words out?
And him refusing to condemn white supremacy?
I'm waiting for the refutation
dude "my best friend is mexican" is not a defense
He ran on a policy of building a wall to keep filthy mexicans out
He's obviously racist but not openly racist
I'd say be openly racist but he did go all in with the "good people on both sides" rhetoric
as far as I can see Trump has very few personal beliefs himself, and 90% of the decisions he's made in office have been about ego
and that's really the same thing
Trump isn't extreme right, but he's an idiot, and he staffs himself with extreme right advisors
Trump's voterbase isn't people who voted for him, it's people who'd vote for him in a primary
Are you saying 71 million people are?
But trump's voterbase is not moderate
The moderates have already dropped it
but it would require him to not be trump
Trump did have the power to make them think it's not stolen
yeah, they believe it's stolen because they're being told that
It's doing nothing but leaving a scar that will last for 25 years of people who do not think elections should be listened to
his fanbase believes him without basis at this point
There is no legitimizing
for 10 votes
ngl if we should put trade locks on china because their government can't be trusted
their economy dies too
guess what effect an economic shutdown of america and europe does to china
but this isn't one of them
sure
he put in policy after policy to make it worse
if china's somewhat to blame for this, Trump should be america's worst enemy
yeah, okay man
china's default answer to bad things happening is to pretend they didn't
inept handling
I draw the line at firmly debunked conspiracy theorism
alright
I find it fascinating you're more worried about china and not about coronavirus being at levels 4 times it was in march
yeah but project veritas is even less trustable than turning point lol
the republicans have no legal right to get the money back, last I heard

I'm personally against private gun ownership in the US; I understand the hypothesis that it protects against police and military action by the government, but I also have lived the reality that it's a force multiplier that gets people needlessly killed, and I lost a friend to gunfire

I'm guessing this is now mostly about building his brand and finances rather than because they have any avenue forward
he hasn't conceded until he says he has
unfortunately this isn't middle school
no
and they get scared from stupid shit like that
but because they see all these scholarships for every ethnic group and go "where's mine, why don't my kids get chances"
not because they think the white man is the god of the earth (some do, but not the group I'm talking about)
They really do and that's the majority of these voters who back these policies
this is the fiction they work under, and so it doesn't make them wonder a single thing
it's because the left is unhinged and uses "nazi" to shut down anyone they don't agree with
They already have a narrative of why
Screaming at them that they're a white nationalist is just going to cement them in their current party
There's a lot of pro-trump people who do not understand how they are racist because in their minds 'they don't see color' or several other rhetorical dead ends
The voters you have to pry away are the ones who support white nationalist policies without *thinking* they do
I don't think they're saying either
they could maybe get away with it if there's also a bill that pays for doses

"per million" is basically a ratio - 10% would be 100,000 people per million, even if the population was only 60,000 total and 6,000 infected

Crossdresser is a fine term but it doesn't solve the full need of the question.
Crossdressing isn't the same as presenting as a different gender. If you're in a t-shirt and jeans, you're not crossdressing, no matter how much makeup you have on or how you've styled your hair.
That has also been complicated by imperialism and basically turning into one of thailand's major tourist attractions as sex work
From my limited understanding on the matter, I am told thailand has cultural roots in having a third gender category
Which has no bearing on intent
I agree that if you self identify as the t word you probably want the deception aspect, but the most common use of the term is to label other people and characters
The term comes from 4chan in bad faith which is why it's banned here
Not really - you're mixing up 4chan rhetoric with intent
The entire point of the t-word is people who present but don't identify as the other gender
Which was a spinoff from a one-off comment on a rather ridiculous analogy
there's been a lot of those clones over the years
8chan is literally "I liked 4chan but wanted to do more illegal things"
most overt raiding and harassment is against 4chan rules and gets acted on - at least, in the past
that's generally 8chan

I am going to say if you're going to make it a moral right to fap to drawn little girls your argument blows
Just while we're on the topic and so we're on the same page, lolicon is banned on this server and you'll be removed without appeal if the mods decide an image posted goes too far
Please ping me if things get out of hand, I'll be unavailable for a bit
For the purposes of this discussion whether someone can *only* get off to children or not is immaterial
<@445783190976856065> this is a horrible argument please never repeat this
It does, which is why I think your argument is weak
Depending on what lolicon artists we're talking about I think this argument is spurious
Hey I understand your point and think that, in this channel, specifically in discussions about them, there is room to use select words judiciously. There are two caveats, though: using them as a tactic to make an emotional punch is pretty not great, and if they are needed and relevant I think it's best to at least censor them with ||spoilers|| - the word might be being discussed but that doesn't entitle you to just hit people with a slur when a groups of people have traumatic history with that word.

I get that things can get heated but we should do our best to care for the others in the channel as the discussion happens.
Other than "your party's opinion on this is x"
Propositions do not involve parties
And yeah, corporate anti-union activities are fierce
They might be in favor but I typically see local propositions involving then defeated
I mean they've factually been smeared as something that's negative, claiming they are not is a different thing than saying people are still in favor
Unions have been successfully smeared in the us as corrupt and selfish and they're not very popular except for limited areas of blue collar work and teachers/public service areas
If you want to play semantics that "people are pro union" isn't at odds with "people consistently vote against unions" that's your game to play but I'm not joining
Which was kind of my point
Sure, it means the public has been convinced that helping union is bad
They're a california thing that things go to public vote
this seems like a step down, honestly
and that's where true proportion fails
they should be outvoted, but their regional representative should match their beliefs
yeah
You want regional voting systems that can get as close as possible to true proportional representation without skipping the middle man
it's more of a problem for parliments and congress
I mean, I don't mind that, on stuff like president and stuff
true proportional representation doesn't give you great regional representation and so you still have problems
aaahhhh
The notice is pretty clear in laying out exceptions
and you would probably even be prosecuted for prostitution in that case - just not the actual hooker
it's still a crime to force someone else into prostitution
Yeah
kinda but more complex
These are all aimed at victimless crimes that police use to arrest the poor and underclass
and I dunno if you're ready for the discourse that making prostitution illegal does way more harm than anything else
what do you mean 'criminal threats'
that's a not-subtle message to cops that they've been abusing power
the resisting arrest one is interesting
There's like 5 that won't be; the ones that are usually used to clean homeless and druggies off streets

my major concern with the interstate compact is that it'll be defeated by any one of the states having their legislature flip
This is far more endemic than Trump's reaction to this specific problem
He's a problem because he's tricked half the party into thinking everything is a conspiracy against them, and they're now lashing out at the system, including republicans, because Trump ran on the concept that 'establishment is bad'
He's not even doing that, last I checked
that's not true
who has since gone off the deep end
I think that was rubio
republicans self-sabotaged when trump won the nomination, all of this is inevitable fallout
It is pretty expected that a queen who rules against parliment is going to be the start of the end of the monarchy
UK being imperialist is nothing new
The queen has pretty notably not gone against UK politics for a half century
like, don't throw "gotchas" at me if you know they're insincere
the queen delegates basically all of her power to the prime minister because if she didn't there would be Problems and she'd probably get removed
I'm not going to have a discussion with you if you're going to keep throwing out stupid shit that any one in the UK would roll their eyes at
I assure you in the states, there's plenty of people who track how their members of congress vote on key issues
No, that's the problem with tying the executive branch to "whoever controls the most seats"
in practice, people vote for a prime minister
on paper
It's not about making sure "perfectly equal", it's to make sure someone's there to go "HEY, it's true that the rest of the country will get 5 bucks, but everyone in my district will lose 20,000"
Yeah, you can't make compromises if no one thinks of you, Zenbu
most people don't even know who their MP is
That's a problem with the way stuff like UK's parliment works, not the concept
both demographically and geographically
that's why representation is important
policies do not hit a country with perfect symmetry
your local level government has no influence on national laws that might fuck your region over hard
also
To a degree, but funding doesn't match that
if there are no representatives you stop getting represented on a local level, regardless of if your feelings on national issues are communicated
they can't imagine that many people not sharing their collective delusion of trump as a noble protector
a lot of the GOP does really believe it was rigged
they're pretty openly pro-authoritarian and anti-democracy at this point
yeah they've been on the whole god-emperor thing for a while
liberty hangout is such a huge joke
usually coaster heads
unless you're one of the few parks that have nation/worldwide appeal, or you're marketing to those that hop from amusement park to park
generally only one can serve an area
also amusement parks are generally de facto natural monopolies
necessary for their thrill seeker model though
but they've lost ground
Six Flags was on its way to doing that in the 90s
it basically was trying to monopolize the industry and squeezed small-time adult stars for every penny
I'd argue that even without the abuse stuff, pornhub was a problem
after the visa/mastercard thing where they declined all payments to pornhub, pornhub just purged all nonverified content
Room for a competitor is wide open
so it looks like pornhub's grip on the adult industry is finally being shattered
Though if you want; symphogear
Not off the top of my head at work, no
Atlus is more conservative than many japanese media I've seen
Slowly and grindingly but they're getting there
I'd argue they're getting there for lgb
Catherine full body was a pretty clear shout-out on that
Also atlus is just straight up anti-trans
Isn't the p4 the one that your party member makes gay jokes all the time
Atlus has always had a weird faux progressive feel
What did you have in mind?
If you start seriously arguing that hitler had the right idea you're not going to stay long, as an example
Pretty serious, but you don't have license to say anything or act any way you please without consequence, if that makes sense
Sports: Exploiting black bodies for profit, moved forward a century
I mixed it up with the us trident sub program that was basically exclusively associated with the ohio-class sub
Oh whoops
It predates "ok boomer" by about 40 years
Meant for hunting other ships or boomers
The opposite of a boomer is a fast attack submarine
"boomer" is a term for subs that are launch subs meant for strategic attacks - they exist to lurk and fire at enemy targets, usually with nukes (not all nuclear subs have nuclear weapons)
Because they're not just nuclear subs, they're boomers
I love tridents but they're not very useful these days
oh, unless this was about native americans in which case yeah we should support them more
Not that I think the UK shouldn't have something focusing on india, but it's a lot easier to reconnect with heritage for indians than black people, who will never know even what part of an entire continent they came from
black history month is a way to make sure the culture they've built since then is acknowledged and reinforced
their culture was taken away from them, their culture was destroyed, crushed, denied when their ancestors were brought here
I didn't really understand black history month when I was a student, but it makes more sense to me now
The full implication is that 'black lives matter, but they're treated as if they don't"
if you go with all lives matter, the statement that "all lives matter, but they're treated as if they don't" just isn't that true
like an award from someone who does everything in his life quid pro quo means something
Especially when you don't believe in it as a solution.
Then stop arguing stupid shit. "It'd be better if a slightly different group of people died" is an obscene point.
Inflated costs are solvable without throwing the bottom population under the bus
I don't think you do
Find a different solution.
So to go full free market you do have to gut the policy to give emergency care to all, as well as strip away the baseline government medicare given to people in poverty

It's a fact that being able to pry money from those systems is part of what's driving the extreme cost

Moving to free market, however, replaces it pretty straight up with the question of "are you willing and capable of paying a fair market price for your care" with death being the reward for "no"
It isn't very different from the current us system.
Healthcare shares too many qualities with natural monopolies; even attempting to make it a free market is doing nothing but selfish inefficiency and asking for straight up abuse
The original point came across less "people on twitter are a joke" and more "people who want to try communism are lazy, low-skill clowns"
3 people were taken to the hospital but it's not serious according to an article I read

I think this is overall a bad thing but it's not going to crush the internet very quickly
which, you know, have always been pretty blatant piracy anyway
The only kind of content creator that even has to slightly worry about this is reaction videos
yeah
DMCA violations was illegal, and it's still illegal
The law hasn't changed
youtube does some other weird shit instead to get people to let them take it down rather than sue them
this is kind of a nonsense comment because fair use is still a legit defense, and it's not going to affect youtube because youtube hasn't had an *actual* DMCA case in a decade
The trouble usually comes from people deciding for other people what the labels are
LGBT people excluding other LGBT people from their labels basically is never a good idea
if anything, sapphic should be more wlw than lesbian, considering there were heterosexual relationships on lesbos
Honestly, I'm going to go back to this 'sapphic' thing because it's gotten under my skin - I think it's absurd that there's this idea that it means anything qualitatively different than lesbian, considering the etymology of both
even if you aren't completely opposed to the idea of sleeping with a very select list of boys
maybe you feel like the term lesbian describes who you are more than bi
honestly some wlw have a huge history of being exclusionary, with history of an attitude of "gold star lesbians," the idea that you're somehow more 'pure' or more of a 'true lesbian' if you never were with a guy before you came out of the closet
I do not think it's up to you to say "you should use sapphic instead"
some people police the term lesbian and say that you're not allowed to use it if you're attracted to men in any degree
tying pronoun roles to that is absurd, terrible policy
<@!278860841485598720> Those are good points I agree with, and I apologize for even incidentally implying they weren't important; however, I don't agree with the ultimate point that they're ultimately more harmful or devastating. It might be a matter of viewpoint; you're not exactly in a position to see the harm from objectification as easily, while impact on children is pretty universal to see.
yeah zenbu you kind of just rewrote her message
but, really, since I never consume any content involving them, it's not like I'd have any actions to take one way or another
Maybe part of me isn't really chasing down "what about the others" because I have some sort of internal block in following a pogrom led by keemstar <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

I think if voter law reform happens the states will permanently flip
Though, you know, it helps that Q believers were told to not vote
More than anything this leads support to the idea that the south isn't as red as it seems, just suppressed
The pessimist in me says that if they win it'll mean we lose one or both houses in 22 and they stay lost till 28, but hopefully it'll be worth it
And it was A) immediately relevant to the conversation and B) political current event stuff isn't really encouraged in live shitposting unless the meme far overpowers political commentary, like jeb winning every state
Yeah I don't think you're in the wrong for giving it credence

What I read was enough that a conviction looked difficult though
From what I read he definitely did have a knife on him, though it's not open and shut whether it was in his hand
It's also put the government at risk as senators sign onto ridiculous shit they don't believe in to try to ride the coat tails of trump but I think it'll pull through
The blind sensationalist populism has crippled the GOP as a whole
I concur that blaming china for the origin of the virus is bad rhetoric I'm not really fond of seeing. Criticism about the inital reaction is one thing but "bat soup lol" is on the same level as "the china virus"

yeah, there's no governor to say "send in the national guard"
idk, if it was antifa people would already be shot dead
apparently virginia's sending its national guard in lol
oh this actually makes sense, pentagon's probably been focused the last month on "how do we make sure we don't look like we're doing a coup"
hopefully they reverse that decision
they just did not

there's probably authority below him that could

Republican party has always been a coalition of capitalists, conservatives, and radical right
They're no longer up against money, they're up against a rival cult
Not unless they can stop trump from talking
Trump always had a huge risk of destroying the republican party and he's still on track
Its moderate and extreme elements as of yesterday aren't getting along
Republican party is likely to crumble
There's a quote tweet that doesn't get embedded in discord
At least this one's ironic
In their version of reality they're out of options
Vote in people to fix it?
What is the alternative
I mean
In their understanding of reality, they didn't; the election system was compromised to the point there effectively wasn't a vote, only a democrat led formality

Obviously they're wrong but in their heads a rebellion is needed for the safety and health of this country
I mean it was all pretty tongue in cheek because there's no shortage of cases of military shooting us citizens
only 2 years, unless this really is the death of the republican party as "the other party"

This is the most likely impeachment conviction we've ever had I think
Only because the vote will happen after he's out of office
He wants Trump gone from the party
McConnell wants the impeachment but idk if he'll vote yes

They're not being stopped, they just have a penalty
The fine is a pretty efficient solution though not bullet proof
Under their logic you still cannot stop them
So what
Say they did have a gun on them
Fenny the argument would suggest there's nothing that the search could do
Its a major headache to summarize but it's basically the crackpot theory that trump has an insider in the military and they're going to establish martial law and eliminate the "deep state"
Its an interesting argument
Because they argue the police don't have a right to stop them as their presence at the deliberations is constitutionally protected
The impeachment is big news but the 2A shit going on is arguably more interesting

If you want to impeach him you can vote no and get what you want regardless, if you don't have a spine
And you know the votes to impeach are there regardless
But you also want to be voted in again
Alright let's say you want to impeach trump
Trump has never been loved by the senate lmao
not for another two years anyway
I understand your point but I don't think I personally agree with it
As awful as those policies are I think going down the road to open fascism's gonna be worse, because it certainly doesn't mean that won't happen
Trolley probleming this is a bit juvenile
there's other parties on the presidential ballot, they're just never more than like 5% of the vote, *all of them combined*
many state legislatures have one or two people from other parties
but no, there's nothing forcing it to be two-party
that's likely to change going forward though
neither party wants to split because it means giving up power
US can sustain more, it's two party only because it's in a quasi stable situation
it's the same problem as UK's MPs but not as stark because the two party system doesn't show the flaws as blatantly
yeah
oh I see
the actual physical regions are important, not the distribution of population
this is true for the electoral college and it's true for the us senate
to me, 'land based' means the presence of land is more important than the presence of people
I'm not really seeing what alternative you're implying
are you suggesting that as a californian I should just have all 53 californian representatives on the ballot every two years?
a district can be 2 square kilometers if you pack enough people inside it
how is it land based, or what would the alternative be?
districts are drawn up according to population, not according to land area
I don't think I understand what you're saying
unless you meant the shapes of the districts in which case, yeah, it's dumb
you get two senators even if your state has two people
house is determined by districts that are supposed to roughly have the same amount of population
other way around, senate's much more land-based than house
to get rid of 2A you need 3/4 of either the population or representatives to agree
states that pass them have them overturned
2A means you'll never get those to stick
I think we did?

otherwise they have a first amendment right to lie

Heads of state cant be able to be easily stopped or you just get governments shutting down every time there's someone on the other side able to arrest
There are reasons why he's not going to be a good president but this likely isn't one of them
It is, I'm just saying I can see him ripping a paper in private
It means you're hot under the collar and are likely to be impulsive in your anger or frustrstion
Temper doesn't mean *tantrum*
That's a way to win the main election, not the primaries
Biden is most of it which is why he won the primaries despite having no meaningful achievements and plenty of bad shit on his voting record
But not politically wise
Losing patience is understandable
The entire thing but part of the whole mythological "being presidential" is being superhumanly wise and poised, and basically everyone who has run who isn't trump has tried to match the template
Its one of those Not Done things
When you're running for president, yeah
I've also seen second hand reports about it
A righteous temper is still a temper
You saw it at one of the debates where he snapped and told trump to shut up
This might happen with biden tbh, he has a temper
I like how half of this isn't systematic shredding but him being a little angry child
Imo it makes it worth watching closely, but not automatically evil
a censor board isn't automatically the work of evil, especially when it's not in the hands of the government (comic book code, for example)
lists of words you couldn't say, etc
at the time, that was part of ethics standards
it was
at least, the white, male, middle-class, heteronormative version of ethics standards
I think it's not totally impossible to have an anarchist network of small scale organizations but there's a lot you have to study up on before really advocating it
You will always have executives
You will always have candidates, even in a communal system
The concept of candidates putting themselves in boxes exists regardless
If you make your box big enough it can outvote the other box
Left and right boxes exist because you have to pick one representative
Uh-huh
Treating it overly literal gets you people storming the capitol because "we own it anyway don't we"
Yes, but republicans love him and still think his doctrine is relevant
Reagan
So goes the basic logic of why he was elected
Trump represents someone not of the system to people who think the system is crooked, and if he's a little racist that's fiiiine, no one's perfect and it just shows he's genuine and not self censoring like those washington puppets
If you're doing it you have an ethical responsibility to figure out how to minimize harm in the process instead of "let's just try it lol"
I'm sure everyone that is in hospitals or relies on social support systems will love having this experiment and totally won't possibly die
If your government is 5 blocks where does the power come from
How will infrastructure be maintained? How will you sustain utilities? Etc
But it can sure be superior to workers in applicable fields, which was the initial point that started this question
No one's claiming it does
Though I guess that's semantics on what creation is whoops

but there's a variety of other reasons - texas has a lot of companies located there due to lax state policies
mostly moving away from california to get away from rent prices
'blue' and 'red' are shorthand for democrat and republican

texas won't, since they're turning bluer by the decade
"we should do it if they agree to fast track"
At least one D senator is saying the same thing
This is probably his last term, remember
He might be ok with that, but that's a point
The interests of trump and McConnell's idea of a republican party are at direct odds
I'm honestly not entirely sure he won't whip people to vote to convict tbh
Is my guess
So Mitch has more time to whip

then you decide whether not enough sex is a dealbreaker and either adjust or break it off
if you have other reasons to want polyamory that's one thing, but there are other solutions to being horny
I think you'll open yourself up to more chances for happiness if you look into sex toys and stuff as alternatives rather than demanding open relationships because you get horny a lot
there is always compromise
also, hard truth, the best relationship you'll ever find, whenever you find it, will not perfectly satisfy you
because, honestly, I think the latter might be an egotism fetish and you might need to work on it
As in your libido is too high or as in you need multiple people to get off

it could be that brain development advanced to the point where abstract reasoning became strong enough to create this system as a byproduct
Because it could be that the cause and effect are reversed
You're not incorrect but it's also a very tall order to show that that it's genetic rather than memetic
but you could make the same argument about currency, and I don't think anyone would suggest we 'evolved' that.
because, yeah, it's a breakthrough that improves survival rate and enables a society to function better and protect the population better
I'm uncertain that you can actually call this evolution -or at least, it's not clear-cut because there isn't necessarily a biological factor -  unless you're claiming that there actually was a shift away from psychopathy due to natural selection
ethics as defined by game theory
Wow
young children frequently do not have ethics come naturally to them
which is memetics
most humans do not think about their morals because they're heavily conditioned
while I don't disagree I had been inferring the term's use here as 'genetic evolution through natural selection'
there's clearly a market
Of course, but that doesn't invalidate the point - the fact that the anime audience, west and east, has those madmen in it is why Redo makes economical sense to make
The fact that people fixated on Shield Hero during the whole vic thing and used it as a rallying cry really should tell you that revenge porn is part of shield hero's appeal to some people
doubly insidious
lol
absolutely
yeah
I hate shield hero too, because it's probably more harmful than redo in the long run
I don't think I'm defending anyone
it's a difference in severity, but not in concept
which is like... a very mild version of Redo
because people were very vocal about liking Shield Hero
and I think it is worth mentioning the western market did a lot to encourage the production of Redo
but also like, it came out of the same cultural well as the rest of japanese animation, it isn't our problem to fix (except by refusing to watch it on any streaming service that dares to have it) by declaring it "not anime"
yeah, it sucks that it's poisoining the well
yeah, I'll admit, that's a pretty copypasta worthy statement
it's not going to magically fall out of the market because you want to lie about what it is
and... you claimed it wasn't anime?
obari directed angel blade for example
even accepting that it's a term, which... I'm not taking for face value, hentai's still anime. frequently with like, actual directors
I wasn't aware you needed to be 'branded' to be an anime
This is shooting the Ubereats driver who ate your dinner
This isn't shooting the messenger
if someone has a yaoi paddle they probably fawned over Vic at some point

oh yeah
but this is off topic
FMA was a *big deal* from 07-12ish in the english anime community
> Victor Joseph Mignogna (/m…™nÀàj…ín…ô/; born 1962 or 1963)[1] is an American voice actor and musician known for his voice-over work in the English dubs of Japanese anime shows, the most notable being Edward Elric from the Fullmetal Alchemist series, for which he earned the American Anime Award for Best Actor in 2007. Other notable animation roles include Broly from the Dragon Ball films
 <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
but he tried to counter-sue for defamation and his cases were thrown out and he had to pay the defense's fees
no, he settled in arbitration
(which meant he was a huge deal 10 years ago)
voice actor, most famous for edward elric
it was, as I said, a rallying cry
well, the imagery of shield hero
considering people were directly using shield hero to defend vic from abuse allegations, it feels like less of one to me
it's difficult to fully seperate the media from the time it was released in
I think the context of shield hero's popularity being in the middle of #metoo isn't a coincidence
idk
because honestly stuff like Redo's existed in direct to video porn form for ages, but this is the first time I've felt it's like, 'part of the season'
I'm not saying 'defending' Redo, just saying that Shield Hero's decent success certainly led to stuff like Redo being tried more mainstream
like
don't forget that all of his actions are twisted so that they're justifiable
that's definitely revenge porn (of the pre-2000s sort)
it unquestionably has the appeal of the little man getting justice for being wrongfully hurt
I'm not commenting on the applicability here, just summarizing
the super short version - "The Thermian Argument is a logical fallacy that occurs when a question or criticism concerning the political statements that can be gleaned from a game or other work of art are countered instead with an in-universe explanation for why the thing being criticized is actually valid."
I'm not sold on it being specifically racist rather than just tapping into some common vein of human psychology but I also wouldn't write it off
but I'm not sure people who haven't seen stuff from resist would see it
I could see it - it's a mild visual coding thing, yeah, I was going to bring up terraformars as a more extreme and obvious example
the adaptation of planetes completely redoes the manga's order and the anime is stronger for it - it's not the place of an adaptation to mindlessly put words into motion, it's the place for it to *adapt*
you don't have to agree, but it's a lot easier to at least see where they're coming from
and it's easier to see why people have problems with it
imagine a D&D modern campaign, where all the races are brought forward into a 2000s setting
for a moment
just
it's *very easy* to see races paralleled to human socioeconomic roles in a lot of settings
remember that most settings are usually in a multicultural society that's basically a fantasy version of modern economic life
does every orc lift? probably not
and people *in* species are meaningfully different from each other
that viewpoint doesn't have anything to do with if racial bonuses are morally right, just that they're bad design
ask me in <#449826367903629313> sometime, this will horribly derail this channel
god I regret posting this
~~if you're hardcoding racial bonuses in, you're building a boardgame, not a roleplaying vehicle for telling stories~~
they had their chance in 4e and ran away from it to be more like older versions
D&D's never going to be free of the mess that is 'build your background to be optimal at your job'
as someone who got pretty deep into anthropology this isn't really a good way to look at it - it's not race, no scientist treats it as race, and genetic correlations frequently don't match up anything like what people assume they do based on physical features
D&D's going to be stuck with problems like this as long as good and evil are absolutes externally defined by cosmic forces
5e still kinda has it
I think what Noi is saying is that scientifically race doesn't... actually exist, while in D&D they are clearly different species
I'm not really sure what the intent is
I think that comment had too many abstract leaps
while there's room for depth I also think there's room for criticism when a story asks us to accept things without critical thinking or to pretend the real world has nothing to do with the writing of the story
as a kid I just smile and nodded at the hook nosed goblin bankers in harry potter
I mean, it does, in my opinion
because they're trying to understand the D&D world by applying the context they know to it
actually, new players are where you get comments the most like 'oh, so orcs are like thugs'
because they're not going to try it in the first place as a new player
you're not going to lose the player
I mean
You only see them in the crunchier TTRPGs
Racial stat penalties and bonuses exist primarily to fuel the hunger to make builds, rather than the roleplay side
Plenty of other systems do it completely different and there's plenty to roleplay off of
This feels like a real "D&D is the only TTRPG I've played" moment
The fact I come from a race that doesn't value education and doesn't understand math is something to build off of, the fact that my confuse spell fizzles more often doesn't do shit for roleplay. *It's not the stat change that gives you roleplay fuel.*
The *worst* part of "design races different by messing with stats" is it absolves the players of having to look past the stats
THAT IS WHY YOU GIVE CULTURAL HURDLES AND NOTES INSTEAD OF ROLL BUFFS AND PENALTIES
**YES**
I don't get any roleplay value out of having a will save that works slightly less often; it's not like I'm going to play failing the roll as something that happened because of my race
you want to give me roleplay value, give me cultural tidbits and meaningful hurdles, not a penalty on dice rolls
it's roleplay anti-value
I disagree
~~dark vision is a scam which is why players get so tickled the two times a campaign they get to bring it up~~
in terms of any metric that the game cares about, no lol
No, you objectively have a worse wisdom stat than if you did that and picked a race that didn't have the penalty, which is the only fair comparison
having a race with -2 wisdom does objectively make you worse at wisdom checks rady I'm not sure where you're going with this
unless you just want your group to hate you
giving you a int penalty does *effectively* lock you out of playing wizards
I mean
which for all intents and purposes, racial stat bonuses in D&D do ~~because it's a little too aggressively designed~~
humans get an extra feat, elves don't need to sleep and get darkvision, etc etc, but it doesn't say that "you can do this job" and "you can't do this one"
generally unique racial abilities cause less problems than stat modifiers
but yeah, I think the success of shield hero made them think there was a market in syndication
it feels like a pretty standard direct to video hentai plot
This is not an acceptable solution
The alternative is to pull all invites (had to do this for another server I run for a bit)
You cannot stop it from happening, you can only do your best effort to respond.
They had filtering bots to autodelete messages, but accounts started using exotic combinations of icelandic unicode or something
Apparently the server had a thousand boosts lol
So I believe the hate speech thing was a convenient excuse
Discord needs to recognize good faith attempts to moderate or the entire thing of large servers is pointless.
I read the response from the mods, they did their best efforts. You cannot stop people from trashing the server with suicide burner accounts. If discord finds the situation bannable they should just turn off voice channels for every server with several hundred active users.
like most LNs the writing doesn't seem to be particularly advanced and it is supposed to be taken at face value
when the fears of "what if someone points their finger at me" were at the height
I really think shield hero being popular at the height of #metoo is not a coincidence
I meant noble as in portrayed character, not origin of birth or peerage
Noble Slave Owner‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
The moderates were appalled he did nothing to stop them, the extremists were pissed he basically conceded and threw the 'righteous movement' under the bus
of his followers
basically pissed off both sides
he lost a *lot* of support by saying nothing during the riots, and then even more by caving after them
yeah, his supporters in the voter base will basically blame anyone else for his failing, but if he shows weakness they'll be repulsed
so he could fuck this up, but as long as he doesn't personally talk I think that's unlikely
'not be embarrassing to your voter base if you vote for him'
The minimum bar he has to hit is
but, honestly, I do not think the competence of his lawyers is going to sway votes here
he would if this was a legal case
> So Trump will have to work up another legal team within a week if he doesn't want this going south for him.
you know, with no evidence
president wants them to defend him by saying the election's stolen
They were building a case to say you can't impeach an ex-president
and no desire to throw their careers away arguing what the president wants to argue
I get the feeling it's quitting out of frustration
Who you were will only be who you are if you don't care to change it.
Yeah, so you deal with that. Its what you do with your actions going forward that defines you.
You don't have to like who you used to be in order to like who you're trying to become
They're good for voter representation but they do not make the clownery in congress any better
Third parties bring coalitions and backstabbing
it's just not meaningful until senate does something about it
'impeachment' is the part in the house
the senate trial is on the 8th
he's been impeached twice, it hasn't been delayed
some states do allow private attorneys to assist the state in prosecution, but it's not a common practice
and wasn't particularly common before then
<@!87512939107450880> I'm not sure where you heard that stuff but it hasn't been legal in the US for 40 years
Under Leeke v Timmerman (1981) supreme court denied the right of private prosecution
ah
~~that said, in almost every country, you lose your job if you lose a lot more cases than anyone else in your district~~
you might be thinking of civil law where the plaintiff's lawyer is private
also I just read cypher's comments and I'm completely unfamiliar with any jurisdictions where prosecutors are not attached to the city/state/whatever in criminal law

japan's situation is more thorny than just chasing open and shut cases
laissez-faire capitalism is how we got 1929
sometimes they can be religion-based, like anarcho-capitalism, who believes the religious figure known as the 'invisible hand' will correct things and set humanity on its most optimal course <:KirikaDess:787798526779195402>
generally anarchism is a way of dismantling the state and distributing power to other, typically smaller, nodes or systems
but anarcho primitivism is pretty open about "if you die, you die" mentality
that's a much more complex topic
it sucks and is inhumane
anarcho primitivism
you joke but that's an actual political stance
ngl there have definitely been worse periods of US history than the ones where the senate and house were deadlocked
you can only try to improve the society around you to minimize it
you cannot get around this flaw
or educated
or smart
democracy has always had the major flaw that there's no guarantee that the majority of people will be right
if it requires a change in the constitution it will be impossible to change for at least 30 years, you need a whole new generation of lawmakers
so trying to go "well you should change it" is unproductive except in a way to sneer
I agree with most of your points, I just think it's dishonest to pretend it will fix things - and some of the major stuff cannot be changed
Everyone agrees the electoral college isn't representational, the people who defend it just say it's fair to be that way
I guess you're intentionally not answering my point
Electoral college is only used for the president
Just that the whole first past the post thing is shredding britain due to it
I'm not saying that more parties is bad
So first past the post's flaws get way more magnified
Id actually argue their electoral system for non presidential positions is worse, because they have multiple parties
Seems like a good comparison to me; having more parties doesn't stop that from happening
And why do you think that's the number of parties and not the entrenched political strategies? I think it's a culture problem more than there just *happens* to only be 2 parties
WW1 was another example where, although tangible interests were present, they were not the reason things happened
generally the arguments for capitalism isn't 'economic growth' but 'efficient use of resources'

Hm, personally I don't think hate has to be unreasonable any more than love does, but the point that there's a point where hate is *justified* is a legitimate one.
How old is Stellar?
Like I agree it's bad I just don't think "feds can't visit" is correct
This is effectively getting to run their own county
They're still part of the state and federal law will universally apply

Hello
Afaik CPS is stretched thin and demands a lot more proof
it's been interesting how few republicans I've seen denounce it
McConnell is on another level and always had been
A few of them might value sacrificing their careers if it means saving the gop
But here it's almost certainly going to happen if a conviction does, as it's the major reason republicans would vote to convict
It can
But it is not the only outcome
One of the effects of impeachment can be removal from office
He was impeached while in office
I would be absolutely fascinated to see the results of an anonymous vote
To vote yes as a republican is to lose your next primary
It almost certainly won't even if McConnell wishes it could
Trump's lawyers quit last week lol
No
The argument is bad (and was defeated) but the interesting thing is it hinges on the election being legitimate

Especially since you're underage and in a delicate situation, please try to avoid posting stuff detailed enough to identify you irl
This is really more intended as a channel for discussing serious issues; it's not really a venting channel, and it's definitely not a flirting channel
Would this conversation be more suitable for PMs at this point?
it mentioned a "need to be different from their older counterparts" and all I could think of was gaia online
2000s anime fandom teenagers put a whole lot a weight on "random = funny"
millennials weren't different, they just grew up lol
and like
I saw a news post yesterday talking about tiktok and the gen z millenial divide and talking about how zoomers love to be idiosyncratic with a touch of edgy humor
it was just an accepted part of conventions
the weirdest part about that is I don't think anyone can really explain it well
2000s anime scene was weird.
it used to be, they used to beat people with paddles in conventions

also because terfs should shut the fuck up
but like, the zombieland saga "shut the fuck up terf" shitpost got posted in here because it was quite relevant
"haha, I know just the perfect funny le maymay that applies"
but be careful when people are talking about a serious topic and you're like
obviously if it's central to the discussion it's fine
there is somewhat of an exception for shitposts for slightly spicy ones during current events like the day after the election and such
it's an anarchocommunist flag of some variety
but yeah, this isn't usually a great fit for shitposts
I understand the intent here - it's likely to kick off political discussion
What you're feeling is the pressure from cisnormativity
Cis girls are also girls with an asterisk
Yeah that sounds better
Non gender conforming
Poke me about it tonight and maybe I'll find it when not on my phonr
Ugh I can't find the article
Japan is also struggling to find what exactly to call these characters and cosplayers and fashion users, though they're definitely further along than we are in finding good solutions
The admiral akbar meme of "it's a trap" was central to the formation of the word though
Internet slang research isn't a really well done field
A few but I haven't seen any really solid pieces
The "trap" is that they have a penis.
I was part of 4chan culture around the time it was coined, back with Bridget from guilty gear - believe me, that is in fact the origin of the term.
I see
You straight up replied that you don't see a problem with the logic of tricking people into being gay. Not exactly sure how you're expecting things to play out from here.
I'm not pretending that
And understand the problem
<@181831124958445568> I do actually expect a response from you here that you understand the server rules
Anyway, I'm quite serious, find a new word
If you can't see the innate problem with that you have an issue
Find a new word, the entire idea is that they trick or "trap" you into being gay without you knowing
but fields and positions and such can expand beyond fixed amounts
For sure, there's diminishing returns out there
"you're saying women deserve special consideration? you've gone too far"
but I've also seen these kinds of memes used to shut down arguments for anything other than surface level 'fairness'
I get where you're going
There's a *huge* reason that you can be sued for a ton of money if you ever ask a prospective employee about their family planning as part of a job interview
Men can go on paternity leave, but they don't get passed over out of fear they will.
The issue of maternity leave alone prevents women from getting hired, tbh
Plenty of careers are "men's careers" and need extra focus to break that barrier
To continue the forced cardgame analogy, the deck might be stacked against me, but I got more cards dealt to me than others.
I was upset about this when I was younger, because it stacked the deck against me specifically. But just because it wasn't 'fair' doesn't mean it was wrong.
Certain minorities were very, very, very underrepresented in terms of attendance at university. Initially, there definitely was bias - "oh, they're asian/have an asian name, I bet they'll work harder than this other person" did happen. 

But the thing is, eliminating that bias wouldn't fix the situation, because the problem's much deeper - certain minorities weren't *getting* college educations and related careers and so they couldn't *give their kids* college educations, making the cycle continue. Far fewer people from those groups had the opportunity to even compete on an equal level. Selecting applications purely on merit, with colorblindness, would be 'fair' but it would be a disservice to society as a whole. 

That's why there's a whole lot of minority-specific grants and scholarships out there, and universities have been asked at points to try to have a minimum percentage of certain groups. They're not asked to compromise on their standards, just not be colorblind, so society as a whole can try to improve itself with ripple effects and fix the unfairness of past generations.
I think the area I can best try to illustrate this kind of thing is college admissions
There are definitely some people who are actually out for blood and want to take things the other way, but usually these kinds of arguments are designed to discredit and laugh at actual progressive work
this is obviously a very reductive argument that doesn't apply to everything but it highlights the point
If the situation is unfair and one group of people has more than another group of people, if you switch to giving them equal shares, *one will still have more than the other*
On paper this is true, in practice people don't seem to understand that when there's long-standing socioeconomic divides between two categories of people, if you just do surface-level treatments of 'treating everyone the same' you typically fix little or nothing
Think about the little trans girl who sees that and goes "???!!! I can do it too"
Think about the next step from that stellar
and honestly, Chevy etc aren't doing horrid
they've had good EV tech while being almost bankrupt for the first half of the 2010s

yeah musk overtook bezos a few weeks ago
also if you're saying to this channel that wealth shouldn't be so controlled by america I think you'll just get nods
yeah
many of them are chinese
they're not, for the record
iirc there's one person in china who's a woman but I think she's also married to another person on the list
and more interested in the appeal courts and other high courts
I'm less interested in the US supreme court, where every appointment is a chess game move
manage to never be on top.
Women are overrepresented, yet even so
Interesting that Noi's point is actually self defeating
March 2017 - In recent decades, the number of women in the judiciary has significantly increased worldwide. In many countries around half of law students are women, and 2014 data shows that women in OECD countries make up more than 54% of professional judges. But women are still vastly underrepresented in top-ranking judicial positions including on High Court benches and other senior roles in the legal profession.

Women only hold 33.6% of judgeships in Supreme Courts. This trend is mirrored in the proportion of presidential positions women occupy. On average, women hold 45.9% of presidencies in courts of lower courts, 28% in courts of appeal, and 18.6% in high courts.
rady that argument meaning it's not a zero sum game only really works if you only get one shot at applying at one job
yeah, well, military
they came up with the brilliant idea of putting padlocks on tanks after that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnUoUKEIGoo
mind you I can't think of any san diego incident with dozens of cars flattened ~~aside from the runaway tank~~ but we also don't get ice, ever
so A) drivers have no experience with it, B) there's 6 months of road oils that suddenly become slick
san diego turns into a mess with like 300 accidents in a day when it rains, because it only rains like 20 days a year
like it can with bridges
it also happens if the road goes from no-ice to yes-ice without warning
for those of you who have had major road experience it's that section of I-15 that weaves through the tiny corner of arizona
no it was on a bridge that weaves through the canyon like 40 feet up
it was probably the most scared I've been in the last 3 years
there was also no cell service
sakimori (for those that remember her) and I did a major road trip and there was a stretch in a canyon that was stop-and-go traffic on ice in an icestorm that I could *easily* see becoming a 30 car pileup
iski's point was less about F1 and more about unrealistically high performance vehicles zenbu
god steve ballmer's still #10 on this list <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
so it was an actual military vehicle
I actually passed it every day when I was at college
the tank was stolen from a national guard armory
a cop climbed up on one, popped the hatch, and eliminated the driver
eventually he tried to do a u-turn on the highway but got stuck on the jersey barrier in the middle
cops couldn't do anything except follow behind it at 25 mph
anyway the tank thing was interesting
it is worth noting it didn't have munitions
the 'not-locking it' has less to do with 'they can't afford it' and more to do with alert preparedness and "why would anyone steal one?'
I'm glad he's out but I don't think it's ever felt like something to celebrate after the initial relief
I get you're kind of going for a silver lining thing here but it really doesn't feel that way to me, he's still a rich white dude who can get away with murder, he's just out of the seat of doing maximum harm to be replaced by another dude who doesn't particularly have my interests at heart
he has the power to split the party
political speech is very protected and it's a very hard argument to show imminent danger
while the senate argument to convict him was good I really doubt it would have been good enough for actual court
it's worth mentioning, I think
he can be convicted, he just won't
focus on the part of yourself that doesn't need romantic interest or validation in order to do things
some of the more grim results suggest that it may be years before we have effective herd immunity
herd immunity target numbers have been under dispute for basically a year, it's a per-illness thing and the variants are making them recalculate

but they're not trying to do anything but vent
they're not dunkek
"asians are good at school" is one that has a lot of negative effects
Even positive generalizations can have negative effects
"trump was elected by men" is a reductive generalization but it is still a useful one, if you're interested in trying to look into cultural reasons of how american politics got to where it is, for example
Mm, Solo has a point, there's a lot of nuance I'm trying to think of how to put into words
not all generalizations are equal
There is a difference, yes
I think police are an example of why sometimes you have to look at the whole rather than the individual
I think it's also important what you're doing with those generalizations
I think saying "Nazis happened, therefore every attempt at analyzing groups as groups leads to harm" is doing society a disservice
but to say that you shouldn't put men as a category to say they're a problem, or that they cause issues, is trying to say that there's no forest there, only individual trees
"pretty much yeah" at yumi's point, that is
like, I think everyone agrees with you that "all men should never be listened to ever" and variations thereof are... hyperbole and silly
this is "not all men" in a different wrapper, for the record
pretty much yeah
You shouldn't ever make a final judgement on a broad category but there are times where they are absolutely useful in decision making
I disagree with that
like, the idea is noble and should be adhered to where possible but judging people as individuals both is asking a *lot* of other people - do you do research on everyone you meet before you open your mouth? - and it will never manage to look at systemic issues that might be shaping society more than 'individuals' do
there isn't enough time in anyone's life to judge people as individuals
dogwhistles are phrases or symbols that let other people who share your beliefs know that you're on their team without openly broadcasting the socially unacceptable bits. I don't think this fits.
"all men are trash" is venting in the same way as "die cis scum" was venting, or "fuck whitey"  imo. I disagree it's a dogwhistle - I think this is either a misunderstanding of the term, or hyperbole. Is it innately transphobic? Yeah, there's probably something to that, but not on any conscious level for most of them, I think. 

Almost all cases I see stuff like this it's less a rational case of why X group is systemically bad, and more blowing anger noises into a void because you spend most of your life in areas where people slap you down for having *reasonable* objections about said groups of people. ('not all men!' is exhausting to hear and partially dismisses whatever issue is being talked about)

Being immersed in an environment that repeats that kind of rhetoric for a long-term period can absolutely be harmful to you, though.

if no compromise is desired, maybe they're not your friend, just someone you hung out with
bring up that it hurts you
or insists you take part in this private part of their life that hurts you
If your friend insists on talking about things that harm you outside of their private area
if you don't want to hear their thoughts
engage with them outside their diary
You're basically reading your friend's diary
Is it bad enough it's hurting you? If yes, then you decide if your mental health is worth it.

who endorse it
you'd unplug from the people reblogging
because they're reblogged by people you do know, right?
but I think if you're in someone's personal bubble and it conflicts with you sometimes you just need to unplug
It sucks, and I was in a similar situation a long time ago, and it was very mentally taxing
"you can't vent about how men are fucking you over because men might hear you" is not really a policy you want in a space for personal thoughts and feelings - tumblr isn't really supposed to be a discussion site, it's more like collective blogging
I think
the former does not care how it is received, at least in the moment
that's a major part of what divides venting from discussion
quite frankly if the posters cared about whether people understood the intent they wouldn't be posting it
college as in tertiary education - the question was about whether the american school system is for profit; american lingo applies here
the real profit seekers in public education are textbook sellers and other suppliers
This is true for colleges but there's not really much profit to be found in primary or secondary schools
These people chose to 'buy' the very expensive product and statistically it's going to give them a bigger paycheck than those on the public option
biden's point of whether or not people who go into large debt to get into top-line private schools should be treated the same as loans to get into public schools; and that money that would go to those private students would be better served going towards K-12 is something I cannot make my mind up on and I keep going back and forth on whether that's wrong or not
For a lot of coastal patrol work it's useful to be detected late
Or the mission doesn't require stealth
I could honestly see military vessels using it on deployment as long as it's not super expensive to cut loose
Its also not difficult to argue he paved the way for murdoch's tv empire
Iirc he also said that Michael j fox was blowing Parkinson's out of proportion and shamming
but only if you don't fuck it up
the latter isn't a bad thing
and more as precedent that will be expected of the democratic party
less as a single relief action
I think biden's looking at this the same way I am
(see my statement earlier about private schools being a breeding ground for the elite class)
~~Assuming demolition charges aren't a viable solution~~
but I think that the decision to pick the pricier school is one that should be largely borne by the decision maker
and I agree with that argument
because the realistic look at this is this *is* a kick-the-can solution that will probably never be solved rather than deferred
I just am struggling to really firmly deny Biden's point that universal, blind forgiveness is the wrong way to efficiently use money to improve education, when private schools are what they are
but back to the point
neither of us think your point is bad, just that you wouldn't take any awards home in a debate
"we should adopt a policy of debt forgiveness to encourage schoolgoing for the sake of society as a whole" and "we should stop telling people they're supposed to go to tertiary education"
I mean yeah without in depth explanation of nuance those statements are pretty contradictory
which is why the public option is a solution to the dilemma
I'm not saying we shouldn't, just that if you don't tie other policies to it *that is what you are doing*
Debt forgiveness on private educations while doing nothing is a kick-the-can solution and is endorsing having tax payers pay in perpetuity for the elite class that controls them
the private/public division is the heart of the issue here
Lank are you ignoring the actual argument here
~~the solution to this argument is to deprivatize all universities and stop creating breeding grounds for the elite class~~
You don't need private schooling to get a highly educated population
what is the reasoning for me to pay for people's harvard education if the argument is that *it does not have value*
*I* couldn't afford a harvard education
the argument then becomes
imo ICE should be abolished and they should start from scratch in the enforcement category
ICE was effectively secret police under trump
in general
restrictions on deportations are good, not not-good
Or was it obama? I remember someone deployed nat guard overseas and it upset people
Basically yes; the national guard is basically an 'official' militia on steroids and is used as such unless your name is bush
people hold full civilian jobs while 'serving' in it, taking a few days a month to keep up on training and such
but the thing that makes national guard national guard is that they're on reserve
could this be done a better, cheaper, more effective way? yeah probably, but it's the current way things are
they've kinda ended up specializing in logistical deployments and are used a lot for wide-scale emergency relief services
the biggest point of the national guard is for militarized forces to be deployed internally, usually in tandem with state government requests
anyone who is currently working as an ICE agent is someone who was okay enough with the way things were to keep doing it and I think that's pretty fucked
biggest reason is that
For every sanderson there's 5 tolkein or D&D clones
But my point was more the idea of an unlikely sage armed with modern knowledge (also the plot of maoyuu)
There isn't a distinction
Scientific and sociological knowledge ahead of its timeframe
A character with modern economic and scientific knowledge doesn't have to be from a different reality
I'd also argue spice and wolf is the same thematic idea as bookworm without isekai, for that matter
There are too many shared qualities of this modern interpretation that don't exist previously
Anyway I'd argue that the isekai genre *is* new (relatively), even if the idea of crossing a protagonist from one setting to another isn't
Bookworm isn't even new, the concept has been done before without isekai back when maoyuu first started getting posted on 2ch
Isekai web novels were the realm of the amateur author, and then the popular ones get adaptations

They share a lot of the same sins as a result
One reason isekais are so popular is because you don't have to be a good writer to make one - with your character coming from a similar background to the reader, you have an ideal viewpoint character to give exposition to the reader at an easy to digest pace

It's worth noting a lot of rezero's plot hinges on the protagonist being an ignorant outsider, so being an isekai is relevant in that regard

I do think rezero has the same waifu bait problem most isekais do, making it slightly bothersome to watch as a woman
The main character acts like too much of an opinionated asshole for that to be a prime motivation
I don't think it's primarily for ease of self insert
I was put off by some of the topics they enjoy(ed) drawing, but the thing that bothered most people was they went beyond "not like Maria" to roasting other people for liking Maria, especially ships that involve Maria and/or Tsubasa or Chris, and blocking people who showed support for it
it's possible for people to improve and get better, but when it comes to how people feel about other people, it takes a lot longer for things to change
To try to recenter it; setting coherence and originality does not have a huge correlation to popularity
We are definitely very off topic exploring this detail, but I remember papa weasley mentioning how temperamental it was

No one is charging huge amounts tbf

Utility companies aren't always perfectly capitalist systems (though in texas they almost certainly are)

Power systems and other utilities are considered "natural monopolies" and are frequently very regulated or nationalized
Scarcity driven prices is definitely a capitalism thing
Mind you the flip side is they didn't get their power shut off
Electricity is subject to supply and demand as much, if not more than, any other good
In good weather wholesale is definitely cheaper
Rather than pay a service to provide you electricity and then pay their rates
Wholesale means they paid market price for electricity
You look like someone who didn't bother reading the link before asking questions
These specific people bought it wholesale
Capitalism ho

yeah I mean it's fair and only ultra pedants get really hung up on it, since the rest of the first film offers so many interesting ideas to chew on

I skimmed earlier and I just had another look; I think the author may have taken down their blog
talking about white privilege is accurate but most people have incomplete ideas of what that means
'reject whiteness' isn't much better
though I'm not sure if there's a way that looks good when taken out of context
yeah, for sure
I guarantee that part of the video is explaining that 'whiteness' isn't something you're born with
I don't think it's passive aggressive
ironically outrage over being told to be 'less white' is probably tackled directly in the video
agreed, it's an easy punching bag for people with an agenda
this slide does suggest they're setting the whole idea up
but it's hard to say if it was a horrible misstep in the course itself
I'd argue it's still objectively a poor choice because it leaves Coca Cola open to... exactly this kind of bad PR
it's possible the rest of the course builds to this
these are two slides out of context
that said
it is exactly the message it's telling, but you're correct that most people don't have the foundation to see it
'white' isn't a race, it's a sociological construct that you can take advantage of with sufficiently pale skintone
but I think those that are saying this is crazy or doesn't make sense or is indecent just haven't read enough race politics lit, tbh
I agree with 'tone deaf' - this isn't going to get its point across to the people who need it
ah
being a little hungry sucks but I don't think it's particularly *unhealthy* either
probably yeah
If you're sorry you could at least have the decency to not *ping* someone talking about their problems to tell them "haha this reminds me of funny meme"
Relying on bioessentialism leads to bioscreening
My point was that if you try to debunk it with that, it's a completely reasonable response from their end to say "well okay, then going forward, we'll test for it and you have to pass the test"
Bio essentialism is still bio essentialism even when you think it's on your side
"sorry, your brain scan didn't come back girl, you're boy forever"

that's exactly my point
idk, it sounds less like you need 'real experiences' and more like you just don't like hanging out with them now
this is not really the time to be organizing much
there is a pandemic
I mean
I don't think wasting 3 hours doing not really anything in a skatepark is any particularly more of a 'real experience' than fucking around in tf2
I think it's a bit bullshit that it's 'more real' or whatever but if you want to, try to go see movies together or go on a camping trip together or something post pandemic

The office also refers bills to the appropriate committees on behalf of the Senate's presiding officer.

there's no snowballing in the mining field - especially since miners tend to sell their second hand cards and hurt nvidia's sales

which is why basically every building in new york has a water tower on top
the standard solution is water towers
yeah
(also highly relevant to steam hammer-as-a-terrorist weapon)

not without its obvious downsides though
same here, but NYC definitely has unconventional needs (I don't live there)
pressure is a huge difficulty
particularly in high rises
not true, there are problems with using warm water
yes
if you ever see something like this in a building or whatever, it means there's steam powered heating
no, new york city is largely heated through steam in underground tunnels, and steam pipes in buildings
any place that uses steam for heating, which is a lot
New York, for one
why not ban them all
so it will happen
which one is going to not conform to the rules
I'm just thinking, any concerns about 'black market appeal' or whatever are going to be filled if even a single successful currency is banned
I mean you would have to ban some of them

It's not a debate point, especially since there *is* ongoing arguments about using the j&j vaccine and the fact you can't choose which one you get
Yeah
yeah I'm not going to argue for or against that, I just disagree with nuker's portrayal of the alternate
ww1 and ww2 both had about 30 years of tech advancement take place in 5
if ww1 and ww2 hadn't happened, we'd see less scientific growth, not more
ww1 would have had some sort of eruption, and given repeated flirtations with overt authoritarianism and fascism, I think a country going the ways of the third reich was inevitable
There were criticality accidents before there was a successful sustained reaction
so it could be universal if someone had a bad bang
I'd maybe agree, but as far as I know, certain genetic research on humans is universally banned
the best case scenario is a nasa-like institute, but even NASA only exists because of the cold war
Because I think it's far more likely the government would say "no that's too dangerous for you, banned" rather than try to do careful oversight of civilian research
I'm actually now really wondering if we *would* have nuclear power without military research
I think it's pretty easy to concieve of a world where civilian research into nuclear advancement is banned
I don't think the fact that capability for research was damaged translates into lost opportunity
nuker is trying to equate research with goods and services and I don't think that's correct, because they're also ignoring the fact there'd be significantly lowered demand for research
yeah, I agree with that
so is yours that we would have had more progress without war
and if you actually look at it, the sum progress during that period of time *is still several magnitudes greater* than the last 30 years
I'm not sure they'd ever exist in a public service form if war didn't exist
GPS and interstates etc
and then there's infrastructure
the only argument is that they'd end up in the civilian market earlier than our timeline, which is dubious but not one I really care about arguing
textiles were pushed forward, medicine was pushed forward, everything took a *leap* in ww2
Again, I think you're definitely off the mark here
and when they do, it's because they're bankrolled by industry
universities don't deal jack shit compared to industry
it's competition that drives scientific advancement, even now
*food science* took a jump
like, every field was hit outside of biology maybe
ngl I think you're underestimating how far reaching scientific advancements in ww2 were
(if it's what you care about)
especially if you think that scientific advancement is inevitable, then doing it *faster* is the only metric that matters
this isn't a broken window thing
you just conceded that scientific advancement is accelerated greatly by war
okay, then you just contradicted your own point nuker
you do not get unlimited funding from anyone if there is not competetion
the primary factor is who's willing to cram geniuses in a room and give them unlimited funding
I disagree, scientific advancement isn't determined by scientific talent
manhattan project was kind of insane
I agree that war isn't necessarily better for economy, but I am not actually certain that in a world without ww2 tensions we would have nuclear power even in 2020
broken window theory applies to economics, not research and development
nuker is also using broken window fallacy incorrectly
it's a fucking 747
why bother?

YAL worked, but it had to be *in the air*, 300km away from the *launch* site, within like 3 minutes of launch
yes that was the problem
that's what the thing on the nose does.
you... can
second it's more because the design *idea* of YAL was bad.
first, I disagree it nullifies any benefit of a laser
no
for firing
YAL was great
it was thrown in the trash because it has no actual purpose
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_YAL-1
military grade lasers *do* exist
blinding weapons and space weaponry
make that the two biggest military uses
the biggest military use of them is outlawed by treaty
the bigger issue is uh
*because we killed like 9 people in our space program*
you absolutely have no idea how much of a nightmare developing rocket engines was
*even outside of military uses*
heavy launch capability didn't launch itself
we have that launch capability because of early military and NASA projects
??
I don't think any research endeavour has ever had that funding rate in mankind's history
and NASA's budget was absolutely ludicrous in order to get apollo working
they were
the plumbing is a nightmare.
the motion of a rocket is simple physics
no
I think assuming it'd happen in 20 is foolish
I think 100+ years is me theorizing
I absolutely don't think that's an overestimate
the amount of *immense* trial and error and absolute sink of resources until we had anything useable was quite significant
I do, however, think, the delay would have been measured in possibly centuries
I also agree space craft would have existed
research would possibly have been banned before it would have been concluded
god needs to reveal what tech we need to declare research victory
if you have farm tools, you have capital
idk if it's ironic, capital exists in every economic system
the closest large communist state we've had existed in a perpetual war state
though we don't really have a good handle on how a communist state would deal with research
an interesting point
but it's a flaw the world would have had regardless of war
They think they're onto the path of an RNA vaccine for *malaria* now
we just had a 'war' that advanced medicine by like 5 years in 9 months
honestly, for biomed, there's a useful comparison
That's the same concept, that it got resolved with military development, but in a different field that happened slightly earlier
Is that an actual counterpoint though
it had to drag material science and metallurgy up with it and required lots of iterations of very expensive testing and lots of custom manufacturing
that's fair, but in stuff like rockets, 'developing a technology to viability' was the part that was *significantly a barrier*
US once made a point of shooting down a falling sat
and designing them for that purpose makes them prohibitively expensive
or anti-satellite
but if you improved tracking, you might be able to make it anti-fighter
it's unlikely the YAL could have ever been used against ground targets, considering that... it never burned a hole in a missile
which is not a hardened target
granted, that was to kill a missile
600km range.
no
YAL had a theoretical range of 600km, the problem is curvature of the earth
at least, unless there's a black project, which there could be?
and we're not in wartime so they haven't pushed for the project to be progressed past that point
yes

I understand the reasoning, but I personally don't think that's a valid reason.

same
unless you still use a crank
how do you make a non-electric starter motor
aren't... like all starters electric
the venn diagram of people who like nascar and people who hate liberal emission laws is damn close to a single circle
you'd have an easier time shutting the sport down
the left turn lobby is going to be very upset if nascar can't persist
maybe you'll go slower as a sport, oh no
you get street cars and you put better suspension and wheels on them and you've got a valid car
I mean
You can constrain them as much as you want and the sport would be fine
why should they not be expected to meet public standards
aren't there some really long rally car races
and especially for stuff like concept cars I'm okay with them not meeting emission guidelines
showcars are weird
a lot of of race cars are super below emission levels if you test them like a street car, with street car speeds
opposite problem lank
it is, but you have to custom write the laws anyway, because testing them like you would test street cars is going to give you wrong results
they'd have to perform at standard race RPMs and be calculated towards the maximum amount you could race a car in a year, multiplied by a safety factor of like 1.2
sure, that makes sense
~~and we don't get evangelion~~
so I'll agree the laws should be modified
I agree with that, they should have to pass them at their expected level of operation
but stuff like emissions laws and such
you can ditch say, some durability restrictions if those exist
but for the exact opposite reason you do, zenbu
I agree that the law that street cars can't become race cars is bad
I view it similarly to sports persisting with high evidence they cause debilitating injuries, because those sports are a massive entertainment market and have the money to stop people from doing anything about it.
it's that they got out of the regulations for no good reason and being rich was probably part of it
My concern isn't that it's excluding poor people

you might be thinking of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX though, in which whether transgender people fall under is an ongoing legal argument
anyway <@!481518367845646346> basically the constitution doesn't really say *that much* about stuff, and part of what it *does* say is, in very basic terms, "if we didn't say it's the federal government's job to decide something, states get to run it how they wish"
their access to the channel has been removed
<@!181831124958445568> I'm done with you existing in this channel primarily to be an asshole
unless by "constitutional law" you meant a federal law, in which case, the constitution is probably on arkansas' side that they can overrule it

I think that you're basically just on the opposite side of the fence from the people wanting the change; I know their arguments are the exact opposite, that they want people to stop defining them by their autism rather than their qualities as a person

just a fundamental difference of view I guess
it doesn't stop horrible laws and it doesn't stop fascism, but it does increase the amount of people who have to be complicit to enable those things - possibly even suggesting that the majority desires it
I mean this is a pretty standard mechanism - you can pass a law with a narrow margin, but if your executive branch isn't on board, you need a very large margin, showing, in theory, a high amount of representation of the people

vetoes that cannot be overturned is a giant step closer to authoritarianism

one of the reasons it was rejected is cops killing people is too common an occurrence and that's an unreasonable precedent to set

and, honestly, they're not going to have enough fuel in them for it to be a major problem if they were
they're not anywhere near airtight enough
ovens are not going to cause a major backblast from just oxygen
that would help
stop letting cops legally steal
yes
yeah it's usually either some state code thing or Blahblah Act Article 5 Section 2 subsection 5a or something
~~also most laws don't have names~~
I'm not a law student
states would stop throwing people in jail for possession if they had to more directly pay for them  - without anyone getting kickbacks
disbanding private prisons would accomplish a lot
but it was a inevitable march regardless
War on drugs definitely made it worse, with extra reasons to see people of color as "the enemy"
laws shielding individual officers from actions
but after riots, reform bills tend to get passed
granted, rioting causing change is possibly correlation being mistaken for causation
whether or not rioting is 'inefficient' (I have no idea how that's measured) it's been notedly effective in actually causing change
I don't see a path from A to B without a revolution
yeah
and honestly results aren't great
if we're talking disband police force, it's been tried a few times in the last year
a police force is inherently there to suppress the designated lower class
there isn't such thing as enough because there isn't a solution
honestly the argument the defense lawyers should be making is that it's a mistrial because the jurors will feel they have an obligation to find the man guilty or the city they live in will get additional riots
the army lieutenant thing happened like a year ago, it's just public now because of his lawsuit
nonbinary
like
the idea term fights against the idea of a binary every time it's spoken
No
Something can not exist and yet be something you have to fight against
what's important is what your family members that you have to deal with *believes* exists
but you have to abstract it a step
Matt you're thinking in what's *actually existing*
it implies the existence of people who believe in a binary that nonbinary people have to deal with on a daily basis
"nonbinary" does not imply the existence of a binary
People who call themselves nonbinary do not think there is some mystical third option of human existence coded in our genes called "nonbinary", they just reject the social construct of the society they live in because it doesn't fit them
if you go out there, I think you will find a lot of people will have zero problem saying "yes, I'm 100% female" "yes, I'm 100% male" even if the woman plays with legoes or the dude gets manicures
however
nonbinary people do not believe there is a binary
I think you're really hung up on terminology so let me try to focus on terminology
a strict binary is just that - there's an A and a B, there's a 1 or a 0. there's no .5, there's no C
the idea of a strict binary is basically "there are men, and there are women, and there are men things, and there are women things" - even if women sometimes do men things, or vice-versa, that doesn't mean there isn't a gender binary, that just means gender roles are more flexible
there have been times that men wore skirts and women didn't, for example
definitely not clothing preferences
So is the idea that you can mold someone any way you want by raising them right
Some of it seems to be genetic and hormonal rather than nuturing
Probably yes
and, quite honestly, it's a question that probably won't truly matter in your lifetime
that's a difficult question no one has an answer to
this has little to do with gender roles, which are social rules describing what a given gender should and shouldn't be doing
that they just *feel* like a boy or a girl
there seems to be something *innate* to a lot of people
okay so
gender roles are not gender
and also not feel like a boy
someone might love dresses but not feel like a girl
because they've *never* felt like a girl
someone else AFAB might also hate dresses and prefer slacks and be a trans man
A girl can hate dresses and prefer slacks and still go "yeah, I feel like a girl"
so I think you're confusing "traditional gender activities" with "gender"
It means that they acknowledge the socially held position of gender binary and do not identify with either
but it does that by being a gradient
to a degree
spectrum means that things range from one extreme to another, but that everything's basically measured by being relative to one position or another. Like, everything is measured in "more girl/less girl/less boy /more boy"
if you're considering it a spectrum, aren't you still doing exactly that?
I mean
do you think every activity in your life is male or female
it's like saying the colors are "red" "orange" "others"
NB is a pretty broad category
There's also agender/null gender people who feel like they do not experience gender at all and everyone else talking about it sounds alien
generally the simplest way to describe a common experience of being nb though is going "boy? no that doesn't sound right. girl? that's also not right."
there can be feminine elements and masculine elements and other elements
I do not think that gender is necessarily a spectrum
as a point to hopefully expand the way you're thinking about this, some NB people consider themselves (not NB as a whole, but their existence on a personal level) as a third gender
you're not - it sounds like you're asking about one topic but we've actually ran through a bunch in a row
If you want to use pronouns as an understanding stepping stone that's probably okay, but prepare to find exceptions to the rule
they're just completely other options
"super male" or "super female"
I just want to make sure you don't think of numbers other than 0 or 1 as like
You kinda do
"are you 0 or 1?" "no" "oh are you 0.5?" "no" "oh, are you -1 or 2?" "no" 
"what are you?"
"C"
for some people it's like
it's "everything that isn't male or female" yeah
it's not a third gender in itself
yeah!
yet others consider gender to just not really apply to them
others consider themselves to be a third gender
some enbies consider themselves to be between male/female
yeah, 0.5 or 2 would both work
0 and 1 are still binary numbers, even if they're also part of base 10
I think the analogy is breaking down a little but you seem to be getting closer rather than farther
0 and 1 can still be called binary numbers, even as you write 2 next to them.
but you can still count to 2 if you want.
0 and 1 are the numbers of the binary system, right?
I guess the easiest way to put this would be like
I guess
they don't mind if people prefer to consider themselves "one of the two options" as long as they and everyone else who wants to gets to pick other choices
Nonbinary people generally aren't out there to tell other people what to do with their identity, right? It's no skin off their back if people consider themselves boy or girl - *elements of the binary*
But okay so like
No it's complex
also for the record most nonbinary people do not have a problem with people who consider themselves in the binary
or rather, the binary cannot encompass all, yeah
if something is nonbinary, there cannot be a binary
apple is probably afraid of a federal crackdown it sees as inevitable
(I don't know if they do and they probably don't)
the galaxybrain take would be that apple does those things because they have a business interest in pornhub
NSFW *servers* are pretty straightforwardly porn
I think
It's in the same bucket of rights as getting to ban the president from talking
discord NSFW servers are a breeding ground of revenge porn and CP
personally I kinda get apple's point
I mean, it's something you don't like
It won't allow you to view NSFW *servers*
they're basically saying "we are not part of the (imagined) gender binary"
correct
2) if someone's going to abuse this they're going to abuse mute
I mean 1), it doesn't give that power
since muting doesn't actually exist, it's how discord expected you to deal with the problem
it's a mild amount more

eh?
you can be an effective moderator without it but at that point some people use terms like 'janitor'
but yeah, I think kick power is the minimum I'd consider?
mute's not necessarily a bot thing, it's a role permission thing
moderators don't need that toolkit to be a moderator
I find that unlikely
manage role
there's manage channel, manage message, manage nickname
manage what permission though
it's a seperate thing according to the sentence structure
As fenny says
you don't give that access to moderators typically
I would not consider anyone with admin perm to be 'a moderator'
no
there is no moderator perm
there is no magic button to click that designates users as "a moderator", only a sliding scale of permissions
for the record
you can look at porn servers as long as you're an admin or 'a moderator' (what the fuck does this mean in terms of server structure?), very odd
(It is extremely interesting from a technical point of view that level of access bypasses the restriction, by the way)
> Discord server owners must still apply NSFW gates to channels with mature content. Having NSFW channels does not automatically mean, however, that an entire server should be designated NSFW. Servers must be classified as NSFW if the community is organized around NSFW themes or if the majority of the server‚Äôs content is 18+. Discord will mark servers meeting these criteria as NSFW if they are not appropriately designated.
> 
> Additionally, users on the iOS platform (including those aged 18+) will be blocked from joining and accessing NSFW servers. Only NSFW server owners and moderators will be allowed to view and manage these servers on iOS. All other users will still be able to join and access NSFW servers on the desktop and web versions of Discord.

these two paragraphs together are pretty clearly spelling out that ios users won't be blocked from NSFW channel in a SFW community
discord draws a distinction between the two
tumblr was definitely very full of porn fenny lol
I don't agree it's inevitable; it's so close to first amendment rights that whether the(US) government will ever be able to crackdown is rather an open quesiton
if this is getting shoved down discord's throat, they may not care if there's a loophole
anyway they both have security pros and cons but it's definitely true that there's no such thing as a mute privilege in discord that the system could use to test if you're a moderator
the convinience edge bots have is timers, but if you're not using a timer it's definitely less convenient
not fuck up the role order
there are pros and cons to different methods
someone you probably do not know in the slightest
unless you're hosting your own bot, the thing you just gave a ton of special permissions to runs through the account that someone else controls, on someone else's computer
no I'm talking about the possibility of the bot itself being compromised
of course the alternative is frequently giving someone you don't even know much more comprehensive access of your server through a bot
I just, yeah, if you're that incompetent, sure
an empty server's about as gone as a deleted one
no I understand what curry's saying
yes
I'm sure there's going to be economic forces in the labor force 20 years from now that can be traced to how this generation is affected these years
I think the calculus of permanent emotional impact is going to be messier than people will appreciate
I agree but I'd remove "for sure"
They get to miss two summers and the second ones can be blamed purely on the adults
Taking away summer break is pretty harsh on the kids, assuming things *do* start to reopen
And, honestly
I do not think it'll be truly under control for summer break
You're most likely erasing the time
The problem is it's not a pause, because it doesn't really resume
That's a fair point
Correct, but trying to overhaul the entire way schools are run and funded and allocated is probably not best done during a time of transitory crisis?
I don't disagree with you but honestly it sounds like you're grinding your personal bugbear here; test focus is a problem but it's like problem #5 or lower atm
Kids really are learning worse remotely and they're getting permanently scarred by the isolation
I don't think the test issue is that big a deal right now honestly
Catering to a specific crowd
Ok but if just idris elba isn't enough to count as diverse does that mean he can be the next james bond please
I think a better way might be "I'm unclear on what an assault rifle is, can someone explain it?" Or "I don't think assault rifle is a useful category"
It feels like a rude set up so you or someone else can do a "gotcha"
I also am kinda frowning at this attempt at starting a discussion
This is a meaningless exercise;any legislation that deals with "assault weapons" will define it
You'd be better served by examining magazine capacity
I don't hate the energy here but semi-auto covers a *lot*

Legally, the term would probably describe every handgun that's not a single action revolver for example, and I don't think having not having semi-automatic actions really decrease the number of victims you're going to see for areas where no one else is armed
honestly I feel the image isn't a half bad good faith attempt at explaining even if, of course, there's more nuance
that sucks but is also hilarious
if this concept bothers you, you might not be ready for open relationships
if she does, why would she need to go for you first?
also it's possible she also wants an open relationship
if openly sexual conduct bothers you, establish that as a friendship boundary - but if this boundary suddenly goes away when you 'possess' her relationship, the relationship's going to be toxic and fail
If you like spending time with her do that. When you feel that it might be right to confess, do that. And hopefully you still like spending time with her regardless
anyway lectric If you think it's too early to make a move, that's maybe legit and you might not be wrong about that. What you need to grapple with is your like, paranoia and latent entitlement. If you *are* freaking out over this that she's liking your friend more than you, this is probably not going to magically go away once you're in an open relationship.
then give them in another server
Anyway let me put this in a different perspective because I think this one's still iffy
You can be blunt without being rude
Digi, you're expected to be constructive here
jury nullification isn't really a power granted to the jury, it's an emergent system
that's a really complex argument
I don't know if it's fair
hm
it's definitely not flawless in that but jury tends to hedge that way
still, the system's designed with the intention that a failure state means the guilty are acquitted rather than the innocent are convicted
I mean yeah
yeah
Because the founders of this country were really sick of an autocratic dickweed and his minions, basically
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:796600452585881650>
yeah
that's fast for the legal system
if anything
that's
That's not weird
I think the forged evidence bit is really interesting and I wonder how getting caught doing that plays out in practice
Discovery exists and that should be enough and if it's not it's because the powers of discovery aren't broad enough
I have less of a problem with the latter
Then make it a law, I guess
I *do* think it's fucked that this exists purely from judicial review
But I can totally get how prosecutors would be scared of their own evidence and witnesses otherwise
It's a really weird situation
They'd definitely get sued for being responsible for that
"forcing a witness to lie" isn't always clear cut and I can easily see scenarios where prosecutors are pressuring witnesses to present testimony that is not true but the prosecutor is not aware of that
Again, I can kind of see it
I can *kind of* understand the reasoning here
Under 18s do not think for themselves enough yet
90% of the time that's just going to be extra voting power for their parents
I don't think kids should vote
While China has been fucky with stuff before it'd get out if they were having giant peaks
Hasn't china had it mostly beat for like a year?
we basically had a wartime research boost in biomedical fields
https://twitter.com/UniofOxford/status/1385596000937684997
the 10 years of progress into mrna vaccines that got crammed into 9 months paid off in other ways - the mRNA vaccine process has been used for a successful malaria vaccine
interestingly enough, there's some unmitigated good that's come from COVID
there is no reasonable defense on vaccine patents
which is kinda shitty but also arguably understandable policy
for example US has a trade embargo on exporting raw materials used for vaccine production that's expected to last another month
which is the actual issue here since 'vaccine sharing' is a messier issue
yeah I don't think anyone here disagrees that vaccine patents are stupid
Limiting exposure does limit deaths because it's a delaying action for treatments like vaccines, and it'll lower mutation rates
The death rate isn't the most vital part of pandemic control
But that is not the same as "it's a law of nature that the whole population gets it eventually"
Covid is a really bad outbreak
There are ten times that many people
US has 32 million cases
So the whole point of pandemic control is to minimize population exposure until control treatments are developed
Both those diseases come in epidemic waves
I don't think covid will be eradicated but there will certainly be people who never get it
Then point disproven
Have you ever had smallpox or measles
Really
Like, that's the wrong stat to look at to see if a country is doing well
Death rate isn't the problem with covid anyway
Yeah that's more normal
That's a pretty bad number for covid-19 man
"I bet china is doing worse than one of the biggest failures in asia" is a gigantic claim
also I think the opinion of me, lily, and kerrik is pretty open and obvious from the rules but if rainbows scare you, if LGBT 'grosses you out,' if the idea that trans rights are human rights is 'cringe' or something, you're absolutely welcome to leave because this ain't your home

also hell yeah, this fucking rules

I just remembered a part of the twitter rant I found hilarious
https://twitter.com/laurakristia/status/1386244201596268544?s=20 I think this is the best thought to leave with regarding that thread btw
if you can force yourself to give people who just dunked on you a compliment, you're one step closer to dealing with it cleanly
that's a good first step
learn to swallow your pride for 20 seconds, choke out a 'well played,' and leave to sort yourself out
<#371105434771390465> is probably better, I just wanted to get one last dunk in on the moron
unless you're translating like, english to ASL, and sometimes even then, every non machine translation is a localization
like, he 'concedes' the need that 'sometimes' you need a localization
I do think his idea that you can just swap words and get a translation is hilarious
It's arguably a problem because it is *also* an among us reference, but it's not going to be magically 'dated'
sus has been around longer than among us
it's not an among us reference
It's worth conceding that crunchyroll (I'm assuming, this doesn't seem like a MAGES. or other decision) did actually think about the word sus in the context of 2021 and decide to use it and that's open for criticism - legitimate or not, it's likely to take someone out of the flow of the dialogue
If you're going to discuss Maria's nationality please go to <#336310266654490624> , it matters jack shit for the purposes of this discussion
If you don't see it that way, other people certainly might
You're turning someone else's religion into your toy
"my OC is a shrine maiden because I thought touhou was cool and I like the idea" is pushing it, for example
No, there's 'benevolent' cases that definitely apply
cultural appropriation isn't an american thing
you're not creating a mood board
but they are e-famous
just a male model
nobody
in the scheme of things
As Armis says, context generally matters.
but I wouldn't blame someone for being offended that you're doing it
The argument that it's a springboard to learn more might be completely legit
India might be easier to illustrate the point, imagine writing a story about a mystic guru when you barely know anything about the country
also yes japan's a weird example to use here because 'outsider' is a distinct social class
That doesn't actually mean that they *want* it, just that they have set a price that they are happy to take in exchange for the burden
Yeah
They want your money
No, they don't
Again, I think a fundamental difference in viewpoint is that you think there's some sort of right to be 'truly interested' in it and a lot of these people just want you to mind your own business instead of their business
there's a difference between "we run a resort" and "you can pay us to get an Authentic Cultural Experience"
That kind of tourism is frequently an extended element of colonialism where you give natives trinkets to dance for you
If you want to really crack this open
They do care about their cultural identity being viewed as some kind of leisure activity
So people who are invested in cultural appropriation and find it objectionable generally don't give a shit if a westerner becomes interested

Surplus? What are those?
He'd still be just as incompetent and easy to manipulate by advisors
My dad was a professor of historical military strategy, he was interested in it for other reasons

Generally they're *not* open to the public out of an interest to protect kids
Most public schools are public property but that does not mean the public gets to use them as they wish
being an abuser doesn't mean she doesn't experience love
she probably does
and how are you going to prove that because they 'sound' biased in the writeup
Because, when you get down to brass tacks, it doesn't really matter if the operators are biased as long as the science is executed correctly
I'm not sure that's a goal to have
not because you think the methodology is biased, but because you think the authors are
I think that only matters if you're going to throw out the dataset because you think they're biased
Obviously the *rituals* involved in publishing are patently absurd but I think even if scientists wrote more 'naturally' it wouldn't be easily understandable
I think, on a *whole*, that's more of a pro than it is a con
But at least by scrubbing the language, people can examine the data as presented
Even if they're honest about what they publish, the selection of whether they publish at all or with what methodology frequently has to do with what results they're chasing
You're never going to strip biases because STEM is, if you'll excuse my vulgarity, largely a lady of the night that spreads its legs for those with a willing purse
Yes, obviously
jargon is also effective at stripping the preconceptions and biases that the writers have from the work
because you can see the study's biases a little more clearly when the author is trying to "talk down"
Also the people who fund them would rather they not be in plain english
Why would the actual scientists be better at it
You, if anything, just echoed my point
so having a middleman field makes sense
and, honestly, journalism is a field with its own challenges and nothing about becoming a scientist equips you for the task of communicating with non-experts
journals are designed to be precise because everything in them should be reproduceable
that's why we have scientific journalism, to cover that gap
aside from that I'm very proud of you all to navigate those thorny subjects without expressing much more than mild frustration at opposite views
I just want to comment on the science jargon obscurity bit - it sucks, but when you use jargon it tends to hold its meaning unlike english words used day-to-day so it's easier to be precise
I already read through it all

work with friends to sit her down and go
Have an intervention
Again, I would try to work with her first?
but she is not entitled to hurt you
And cutting her loose might be disasterous in some ways
Yes, she does
This is going to sound really rough
Having struggles and problems does not excuse you from being toxic and abusive
If you've brought it up and she's not conceding that she should change or she has a problem, I suggest you cut her loose
maybe it pushed them into becoming cynical and hostile
I cried a lot coming out because I didn't really want this life
this is pretty rough
You basically have to choose between "denying who you are" and "watching dreams and relationships go up in smoke, and be thrust into a world that fucking hates you and is currently aggressively legislating Bad Shit for you"
because life as someone who is cis is so much fucking easier than as someone who is trans
I resisted admitting I was trans for several months after I kind of 'realized it'
I can't give clear insight here but maybe this might help
so
what's up friendo

it sounds she got radicalized at some point

https://twitter.com/DisneyParks/status/1389222435359232003
that's why there's leftist theory that you shouldn't be colorblind, because it's very, very easy to draw up stats suggesting those categories exist along racial divides
if you treat everyone equally, then you give people who need help exactly the same as people who have too much
we're getting a whole generation of breakthroughs in malaria etc
tbf that's turning out to be money *incredibly* well spent
lmao idk about that one
iirc US and other countries also partially bankrolled R&D
ghouls

the companies are just fine; their profit was secured when they developed them in the first place with US committing guaranteed purchases etc

answering the question of "well okay, why do I need yet another messenger?"
that's the point and why signal is advertising
that's pretty cool from a technical standpoint
rather than a document that can be updated
the constitution is frequently treated as sacred
also I'd argue that 2Aers also believe in divine right
regardless of who lived there
The rest of America was *ours* to take
Manifest Destiny
we had our own name for it
if you want a better example of America believing in divine right
but yes, getting them to want to die for you is difficult and valuable
it's easier than you'd think to get people to commit atrocities for you
both current China and current Japan are empires that held together so long they became a single country
It's easier to believe you have a claim to take over the world when you're led by someone who's either descended from gods or has the mandate of heaven
Or, at best, make a bounty board for it
This seems like an ultimately bad idea to outright be able to buy policy
It is but my understanding is that in practice it's more of a way to pithily say "it's not what *I* would have done, look what you missed out on"

Making statements on what you would have done instead doesn't really make you better prepared to take over
The whole concept sounds like something a 7 year old came up with
Shadow government sounds like the dumbest concept and I still can't believe I understand it correctly
you were already throwing 1% cases that are going to take a decade to happen up there
there's also the end-state of Arab states finally declare war on israel, seeing a decline in US-Israeli relations, but I think that's an unlikely one unless someone unstable comes to power
it also makes less sense now because their name isn't matt lol
Netanyahu is a problem but the bigger problem is he's in there because people want him and his methods in there. As long as that mentality is big in Israel, replacing him won't magically change things
No, but they need to be installed close to the launch site
If you're losing, what do you have to lose
And again
You have to already be scrambled
Tech is different from capability
And do what
Most countries are smart enough to recognize that when someone is already losing they don't have much to lose by firing them
Sure, nukes don't allow you to win wars, but their existence can stop you from losing
The big problem is Israel exists for shitty reasons created by an entity known for making terrible decisions that screw over other people
If it becomes relevant
I expect we could end up back on it
I remember that
Meaning you need line of sight to the air above the launch site
No anti nuke doctrine I know of bothers trying to stop ICBMs more than like 60s after launch
So invading becomes an option you stop considering as much
You don't want to gamble on tech that has a 70% success rate when the failure state is millions of deaths
Not a first strike
This is a deterrent to stop people from attacking you
But again
If anyone has this capability they've kept it top secret
ICBMs can't really be effectively shot down outside of a very short window solo;the fact they have travel time doesn't make them easier to stop
They *do* need to be scrambled
Please don't discuss the authenticity of Arthur that's way off topic
So "are you saying we should move" is a straw man here
It's definitely too late for that, but you were replying to someone who said that it should have been elsewhere in the first place carolnein
With due respect, that's not meaningful
I disagree with this, this is anarchoprimitivism and acting like the whole world can be operated with simple levers is the easiest way people get stepped on
But I think so does everyone
I agree
Like, sure, they could join hands if they were completely different people who didn't have hangups
Your semantic games are divorced of considering real people at this junction
South Africa was not established explicitly on ethnic nationalism nor had ethnic nationalism drilled into them every day for 70 years, I don't think it's a fair comparison. I don't see Israel abandoning their identity this generation or the next
Correct, Israel is obviously not going to agree to suddenly being under a majority Palestinian government, I'm very confused where you think the spot that would please anyone would be
You still don't matter
Imagine getting "rights" to have 3 seats in 100 seat parliament for example
There is no proportion of governmental control that would make people happy
People historically do treat America's trail of tears as ethnic cleansing
Kindly don't
<@127848372131463168> I'm viewing this as throwing aspersions at a user in specific, please stop
Is the narrative that Palestinians choose to stay in the buildings then? Because the numbers are pretty bad if there's "warning"
I would prefer the powder keg to not catch on fire
Annette please don't use a sarcastic tone on this subject here
I think the lines between what Israel is doing and what the us did in the 20th century isn't all *that* far apart lankpants
Sure, but if there's a warning, why don't the civilians choose to go? They generally care if they die
Im not playing gotcha here this is an honest question
If it's an empty show of power where do the disturbingly high death counts come from? It's typically like 10x Israeli losses
I've already told armis off for doing that
Correct. Perspective isn't an accepted reason to mistreat others here though.
My apologies for my word choice, then
Yeah if you do choose to just lurk please do that instead of posting about it; it comes off with the intent of "one upping" someone else's choices
You are *definitely* going too far at this point solo, please take a moment to chill
I think I get what you're trying to say lank but I think it's probably best if that point just wasn't made right now
Which, good
It harms future speculation
Elon gets off in inserting himself into major media
Yeah but the technicality of "host" was much later
Especially considering Dan Aykroyd beat him by like a decade, yes
I mean no, I'm still annoyed when he tried to claim he was the first person with Asperger's to host SNL
I just can't wrap my head around the doublethink needed for this
I mean this announcement was last week
What the fuck is Elon doing
SpaceX just announced they'd be taking dogecoin for one of their upcoming launches
?????
Since I'm in the US, probably commit war crimes, honestly
"It's unfortunate but it has to be done to cause the minimal total harm" feels like a very flimsy argument when the civilian deaths are a 10:1 ratio
Here's what that tells me, personally. IDF already knew where those strongholds were. The strikes are retaliatory and for revenge and to send a message. Otherwise, if they were just interested in eliminating targets with minimal civilian deaths, they'd primarily wait for periods where there'd, well, be minimal civilian deaths.
do airstrikes typically occur within a week or so of a Hamas attack?
I'd like to ask again
The problem is the calculus isn't that simple
I don't agree with Matt's rhetoric here, but "this is the least bad solution" is still a justification
Do the airstrikes typically happen within days of a hamas attack?
I want to remind you you claimed the solution was diplomacy, and for both sides to give each other something to equalize things. But now you're pointing out that Hamas benefits from refusing diplomacy; their existence depends on continued radicalization. Why would they ever sit down?
it's basically a trolley problem
"It's you or them, plus 30 unrelated people" is why people find this one so thorny
The argument of "It's you or them" is definitely fairly easy to ethically answer
Of course they are, solo, but there's always weaker times than others
Quite honestly, you need to not be in a democracy to even consider it
Lankpants the entire last 5 minutes of conversation was about exploring what would happen if they stopped military action. Nothing gets solved, though, quite honestly, people would probably be dying slower. They'd just be mostly israelis, which would definitely not do anything to get israel to want to sit down *either*
england was particularly gifted in giving areas the absolute most massive middle finger when they pulled out
It's not something any rational government will do
Perhaps not the best choice of words considering Israel's current tactics but yes
this is not a fast solution
"while you try your best for a few decades*"
but good luck getting people to take it
For the record I think that strategy could actually work
So the actual solution you're proposing is actually 'do nothing and take hamas strikes on the chin while you try your best'
anyway, as Maya said, it's kinda irrelevant
longrange strike craft, but the chassis can also land on a carrier? ok.
yeah, it's the "trying to make an even more multirole plane" that was the problem
it's not as good as it should have been but it works
It's easy to confuse "f35 development project was one of the worst things" and "f35 is a bad plane"
america's having the same splintering problem with its domestic terrorist groups tbh
no it's alright, it's an interesting question I just don't think anyone's questioning the IDF's *narrative* here
I don't see how an IDF statement would change anything unless they suddenly come out as satan and said "we did it because they wrote mean things," matt
I've been scouring, no reports of any journalist fatalities
What do you mean Kat, Nazi Germany sent Japan a bunch of relics to research <:FudouSmile:672848303632678942>
"his armies did not fight in multiple theaters" is my favorite part of that. Germany was on 3 land fronts in various parts of the war to say nothing of the naval conflict
nanobot chip finally fully integrated
The hypothetical objective would be to destroy the press staging area and equipment rather than demoralize the press
and more to make them less capable to do fieldwork, if that *was* their intention
I think it'd be less likely the goal was to terrorize them
They're just obviously going to say "there was hamas material there" every time regardless
I think it's worth considering that some strikes might be based on partial or bad intel, or done for other reasons, tbh
"they wouldn't give 10 minutes" probably telephoned into "they only gave 10 minutes" yeah
Firing a warning shot doesn't automatically make the IDF saints, particularly with the results they get
I mean, if the 'deep basement bunker' thing is true it means that wasn't a consideration because you kinda have to do that at building construction, but that's only based on armchair civil engineering of the chaotic science of demolition
Yeah. Them not noticing doesn't mean there wasn't a hamas bunker, or apartment, or whatever, but I find it dubious to suspect they knew
Seems unlikely
if they knew, why were they still there, knowing IDF tactics
it's not relevant that they didn't report it
Let's spin the question around
journalists are not obligated to be impartial
I don't think that's weird
it's gotta be associated press
The wording of IGN's statement is about as close to condemning Israel/IDF as you can get without really stirring shit up and I am not particularly surprised Israeli media would reply like this to save their audience retention
still, IGN as a company might go "hm maybe we shouldn't do the bundle thing"
apparently the different localities are actually kind of like, franchised out
I'm not 100% sure, though, IGN's Israel site is apparently super upset and is causing an internal ruckus
now without the ability to actually give it all to charity
Huawei might completely be right that there's no risk but this is the cost of being a nationalized company - you represent national interests whether you want to or not
I think calling it 'based' is adjacent to sinophobia but it's probably the intelligent move, and honestly everything I've seen from huawei leads me to agree with Kat on a personal observation level
which, I mean, it's fine in my book, using your position to bring focus to good efforts is like one of the only reasonable uses of power
For pride stuff it's generally virtue signaling but this one's kind of out there to the degree I'm wondering that maybe someone high on staff doesn't have a personal connection to the issue
yeah most of the missing messages are in <#680064266539499535> which I'm pretty sure I've blocked off from public sight because there's nothing interesting in there
Might be some archived channels

I think what Matt is getting at is there is less stressful alternatives than arguing about it that you can take if needed, that's all. You're obviously in a stressful situation regardless.
Yeah, this is bluster and is an interesting contrast to the air of impartiality Al Jazeera has tried to present for the last decade
(when pug checks this channel, to clarify, it's not aimed at pug)

I'll look at it, but it is in the server rules
left/right tend to be ways to organize and run a government, primitivism is like the most extreme form of anarchy where the entire concept's chucked out the window
primitivism isn't really on the scale
Their early response is hard to judge because there was so much information control
a libertarian society does give up advantages
probably saved a few thousand to a few hundred thousand lives with covid
most western countries bombed the test
I think we have enough data at this point to pretty accurately say that at least half of all super populous countries would have let the pandemic be a pandemic through ineptitude
and then in a few minutes admits he's hasn't done it at all since everyone who believes in it has heard that bit already
to his credit he knows this and makes his point in the first 10
I can't really see a large amount of people who would watch a long video except A) to be affirmed they're right or B) to get ready to argue against it
yeah, to me, this is the equivalent of someone asking you to watch a two hour jordan peterson video "because he makes a lot of great points"
like we've seen throughout the pandemic, the fear of a line going down on a chart is enough to enable some really bad health decisions
the rest of the world didn't exactly decide to be careful to keep it from getting *in* outside of cruise ships
and, mind you
ie, the virus getting out
I do not think china should be blamed for something that I think the majority of the world would have failed at as well
but the thing about pandemic-level diseases is they're so easy to transmit and it's almost a matter of time until it gets out if it infects even a handful of people
I think china can be blamed for not being transparent, or even doing a coverup
nobody did shit about it
All health agencies heard about it by early january
it affected me just the same
I wasn't lucky
everyone pretended it was just fine at first
or at least early january
I heard about covid late december
Also that's false
several SEA countries as well
They're not easy to set up due to precision in both equipment and environmental controls like air particulate size
There are more chip manufactories going up but they're not going to be ready until 24, 25
Now with trying to play catch-up the lists are even longer
And then they restarted, skipping everyone on the calendar they didn't get to
When covid happened supply was interrupted and they stopped for several months
The problem is when you want chips made you order like 20 months in advance
It's not, but that's not the problem
They probably expect the shortage to go longer
That's why they're doing a hardware revision
imo the power grid is the single trickiest engineering thing humanity has built to scale

The counter to your point is that executives may look at this and go "it could be better with a man"
Tomb raider's sales post reboot were continuously declining and uncharted's were increasing
Or power fantasy
Sex sells can be true without the sex being in the character designed for self insert
Enslaved has a male MC and you know what did better than tomb raider? Uncharted
As long as I'm not expected to be grateful or buy something I'm fine with it
And also that picking enslaved as an example is pretty off the mark; you play as Monkey, not as Trip.
Anyway, my point was more that while I agree games with women can sell, executives can totally still find reinforcement for their beliefs they can't - there's also the stupid part where fan backlash is worse where girls are involved for no real reason
Which to me is absurd but hey
Apparently initial sales did only half what was expected
I looked into it and apparently as far as the investors were concerned TR has underperformed the whole way post reboot

I do think it's better for everyone to be equally miserable about how shit they are rather than encourage metal straws which will injure some and be too much to clean for others
yes
> This ban will apply to cotton bud sticks, cutlery, plates, straws, stirrers, and sticks for balloons. It will also apply to cups, food and beverage containers made of expanded polystyrene, and on all products made of oxo-degradable plastic.
Bio plastic isn't getting banned, but as I understand, some specific classes of items that tend to get thrown out regardless and end up on beaches will be getting banned if they're single-use, bio or not
I'm not ruling it out but it doesn't seem like a great option
you dent a metal straw, a paper straw goes limp, but a wooden straw would shatter and splinter
and also wood's failure state is very bad for something you're putting in your mouth
unless you used a hardwood which would be bad for manufacturing
paper is stronger than wood
wood is also far more fragile
yeah, they rarely last a single hour before they start doing stuff like collapsing under suction
I've used them, they suck, and several businesses here used them for a few months before swapping back
Maybe, but they have huge user satisfaction problems
> > The 10 most commonly found single-use plastic items on European beaches, alongside fishing gear, represent 70% of all marine litter in the EU.

I like how they sneak in 'alongside' here
it leads to injury
metal straws aren't a suitable alternative to those with motor problems
plastic straws are a big benefit for the disabled
getting rid of plastic straws is a potential issue though
if hungarian treats vowels differently, it's fine. "onii-chan" isn't japanese, it's romanji to put it into a form english speakers are comfortable with
It says in the article they were suspended and some are basically expelled - forced transfer

yeah it's not malicious
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

I do not think we should operate on the assumption that we will be able to decompose plastics but Ive seen opinions on the field that they find it more likely than not
There is a difference of several magnitudes in mammals adapting and bacteria adapting, and quite frankly I remember seeing articles about there already being potential plastic eaters out there that break down limited types of plastic that weren't around before
does anyone have a good resource to read about how myanmar is unfolding
if that's far left, what does the far right want
Better to not force people to pick, just distorts data
Apparently it does affect more than new joins unfortunately but the elevated level will remain for a few days
It should only affect new joins
I've put the level up to needing a phone number for the time being
I don't think anyone's arguing that
yes
I see what you're saying, but there's alternatives where everyone involved actually creates value and labor rather than just absorbs money because they have capital
imagine if instead of rental welfare people could just live in homes
you can tax them regardless
yeah, but that doesn't have a lot to do with permitting hoarding residences as wealth
The rich pay a bit more on property so they can collect a lot more from the people on welfare
where is the communal benefit here
right, so where's the tax
they're effectively paying themselves
to give welfare benefits to people who have to pay the landlords
why should people be rewarded for owning lots of property
I'm talking about renting, not usury
Does this really offset the gain in having and leveraging capital to extort money from people who need a place to live
Yeah
We can discuss whether vacation homes are ethical after people are only homeless by choice
I think the concept of vacation homes is kinda shit
I can't really see a justification for anything other than transient housing (like dorms)
I cannot think of a good defense or reasoning that people should be allowed to own residential property they don't plan to ever live in
(which would reduce the effectiveness of the training because most sane people would forget most of it unless regularly drilled)
killing the training programs really isn't the problem here
and to teach it properly you'd need to run drills and such, giving someone a course on it and then having them never use it is like never teaching them at all
it's a lot of shit to teach for something you don't think you'll ever use
you didn't, but I'm struggling to find "non-economic reasons"
(which is possible and does happen in limited quantity)
I kinda don't like the silent implication that most homeless are homeless due to mental illness? Because I don't really see another reason that doesn't directly involve money? Unless italy really has reached the point where homeless are homeless by rational choice
housing market is not that
there are ways for rich people to invest capital that are not inherently predatory
but insurance exists
you could eat the loss for natural disasters or pest invasions or such
technically yes
being rich comes at a direct price of making others not be
but *especially* for stuff like the housing market
which I don't think people inherently object to
ah the 'rich people deserve to be rich' argument
so I don't see why a single person should get to own multiple residences
they'll rent, but only to get some incidental income out of an investment they're making regardless
plenty of people out there buy houses with no intent to do anything but hold onto them for a half decade
landlords, as shitty inhuman beings as they are, at least let people live in them (at unreasonable rates)
the true evil are investors
landlords aren't even the true evil
and, honestly
because the market's inflated due to people treating residences as capital
do you know why they don't have the money required to buy it
yes, that's generally what most landlords do
there's a difference between using your own space to house others, and owning space you're not using for the sheer purpose of making others pay you to live under a roof
I know you don't
and not go home to live in your own home
I just think you should have to live there
and I'm fine with you owning an apartment and using it that way
there's a difference in terms of contribution to society in incomes derived from producing goods and services for otherse and in incomes derived from taxing others of necessities
to answer the question of "why should people get to own multiple homes" with "well we've tried to make a patchwork fix" rather than give a reason
you just seemed to be arguing in defense of your status quo
it's a weak point in the system you were defending earlier
that's *definitely* economical
oh I see you're saying it's non-economical because they're being refused places to live even if they have the money
if they don't get handed rent welfare that's a failure of the system, not a 'non-economic reason'
if immigrants can't find homes that is an economic thing in my eyes
I'd assume it's not malicious because you don't want to move to that mindset sooner than necessary
For human error in form filling? Yeah
Sounds like it just needs resubmitting
Ah, I see
'thorough' would be as far as their obligation takes them
'vigorous' is not a word that they needed to use
They do have an obligation and I don't begrudge them that, but legal experts have pointed out the wording implies more than the usual obligation
Bureaucracies are stupid

there's a lot of different important issues and as long as a lot of people care about a lot of the issues, hopefully we'll bang forward progress
treating them like they're supposed to be one unified group is a fallacy the two-party system tries to get you to believe
I agree, and it's not so much that the left is 'unfocused' as there is no such thing as a left-right dichotomy, only people who are conservative/regressive, and people who want to make progress in multiple different and sometimes conflicting directions

<a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
Putting a witty comic or meme as a relevant response to an ongoing conversation is fine, though
I'd like to avoid this being a space where people just dump memes about stuff they don't feel like they can get away with in other channels. Exceptions will exist for high intensity stuff that's continually unfolding like the 2020 US election, but overall, this isn't a meme dump channel. If you wanna discuss something that's fine, but "haha look at this" doesn't really meet the threshold of the gravitas I'd prefer this channel to normally have

Look, the crux of the argument is that you're trying to paint the CCP for being evil in... asking a company to censure an actress for doing something pretty blatantly offensive to the whole of the country?
Japan has seperation of church and state
They can't???
Because the governments have far right elements in them, yes
Who the heck are you to declare what the majority of japan supports because you think you 'understand' shintoism?
the arguments for them to move them somewhere else *are internal arguments*
it's not how the japanese see it
No
It's a religious, spiritual, and political place that glorifies war criminals and does work to whitewash what they did
they're openly imperialist
` The museum and website of the Yasukuni Shrine have made statements criticizing the United States for "convincing" the Empire of Japan to launch the Attack on Pearl Harbor just in order to justify war with them, as well as claiming that Japan went to war with the intention of creating a "Co-Prosperity Sphere" for all Asians.[20]`
Yasukuni's problems are not "we can't move them"
and
It's been suggested many times in japan to enshrine them somewhere else

Kayano's career is not meaningfully hurt by this
I wouldn't be surprised if she was blacklisted in china, actually, but the sad state of things is this probably makes her *more* employable in japan
One role she's played is getting cut
don't shed tears for her
she's not
I'd be sympathetic if she was harmed by the arrangement
*she was*
It doesn't *matter* if she meant to be horribly offensive
It's absolutely reasonable that kayano ai didn't really know how bad the shrine was, but since the shrine is so tied to far right nationalist warlovers, is it really a huge deal if a chinese company decides to no longer do business with them?
support unions
and that's the way it goes sometimes?
and someone got upset
Yeah, I think she was probably ignorant of the effects her statement would have
Just that they chose to cut the contract
I didn't mean to imply it was a contract violation

Okay, they haven't made contributions in a while unless they finally resumed a few weeks ago

No I don't think they got banned before
<@!278860841485598720> this isn't the first time
yet show up to drop alt right talking points and stir trouble
it was done because they contributed to no other channel in this server
As a final note this was not done because of their views, exactly
I mean, you're wasting your time because they can't see it anymore
if you're trying to argue with them you're wasting your time armis
Thus, the consequence is I've discussed it with staff and we don't really see you fitting the server
Point in case: You only ever show up to parrot alt right arguments
Your actions do not mean you have no consequences
They thought it was worth the expense of hiring a new voice actor and making a new contract to no longer have to deal with her because she offended them

I have huge problems with people who think A for ally belongs in lgbt+. I appreciate allies but they're not lgbt and I hope to God allies don't think they're fighting for allied rights or acceptance.

I am not that person, for the record, and didn't join this server for another yearish after that event
the person who runs the subreddit wanted a discord server and some people ran it for them for a while, but they very much did not like the way the mods were handling things and issues and the kind of jokes that were not only permitted but that the mods themselves engaged in; this one was started up in response

that's the super abbreviated version, and was like 4 years ago at this point so it's not an overwhelming factor in the differences at this point
The right to not self incriminate

yeah, but dream used to stream like all the time and probably just was like "eh yeah it'll happen"
that is a different promise
I was told he said that all his donations this month would go towards charity
I really don't see the "Fuck LGBT" angle here, just a lack of care about doing more than performative statements which is the world standard for corporate and capitalist actions during june
ok but there's no lie here
I think he just didn't want to stream
If he wanted to he a scummy shit who thought he could get away with it, why not just lie about sending it to a charity rather than sacrificing a large chunk of income for no benefit
Getting 'free' PR that he's now throwing in the toilet by not doing it? Thumbing his nose at lgbt by... Sacrificing a month of donations regardless? This sounds more like just being incompetent and not reflecting on the impact his break has on what he said
I really just don't feel like he's got his shit together enough to put through like a cunning plan to... I actually don't know what it's implied people think he's doing
Depends entirely on why he didn't want to stream
Just an idiot
I'm willing to believe he's not malicious

there's internal research documents leaked talking about how they knew it was possibly a thing in the 80s and discussions about how to pretend it was fake
exxon's been acting against it since before it was widely accepted
veto overturning processes depend on state constitutions, but in this case, that is correct
Anyway, I'm guessing the reason for the veto is you can't vote in florida with a felony conviction

If he gets in power he's going to be so much worse
you'll think Trump was proto-DeSantis
I think next decade looking back
I don't think you'll end up having that view in the long run

Honestly the numbers on foster care are bad enough I wouldn't make the assumption that the mother would be worse
It's one thing to say it, but there'll be a million complications
This is complicated by the fact that the victim will almost always be someone with a close relationship to the assaulter, though
If a sperm donor has less obligations than the victim there is a problem

It's not like anyone here is really of the mind that america did a great job with manifest destiny
I'm not really sure how to read this other than "I'd like to propose that today be america hate day"
Getting bullied sucks and I'm sorry it happened, but if you want people to, for example, not block you in the future, you should look for ways to connect with them without bringing stuff like that up.
You've made your point once and, since this is an LGBT positive space, I really would rather you not bring it up in the future because people here do not have to and should not have to give you sympathy for saying you have a problem with gay content, especially when it comes up *repeatedly*
I'm also going to suggest that you stop bringing that up, because making sure people know that you don't like yaoi isn't going to win you friends. 

Not liking a kind of porn is a private matter and is just your tastes. Making sure everyone knows you don't like gay porn is a public matter and people may find you distasteful for highlighting that specific thing.
Most people online are generally doing something with their time. It can be rewarding trying to make friends, but when you strike up a conversation with someone, you are asking for their valuable time. If they don't enjoy it, they're going to be annoyed
It's not right to call you sick but you also shouldn't dump stuff on people you just met, who quite possibly aren't even sure they want to talk to you yet
So, this sounds a lot like you never really thought about their personal space and vastly overshared and annoyed them
Have you talked before?
And I'm guessing you contacted them and then opened up to them about a bunch of personal stuff?
Is this in response to you contacting them?

We are actually not the only country that has attempted coups!
Not in any critical way
America isn't different from other places aside from having guns
I think it's silly to say you won't be attacked but there are nonlethal self defense options
You would also be able to move to outlawing handgun ammo which would make things worse for criminals
Stop the legal guns, the illicit ones dry up
Illicit guns exist because they're legal guns stolen
No, it hurts them long term
Banning pistols also does a lot to stop murder suicides
You can totally ban pistols because long term it has an effect on all parts
Also you can't use a knife to take out like 4 people

The latitude for judges already existed, just for only vaginal sex, which makes no sense
You could write the same article with "California addresses anti-sodomy law" and be right
This article is a *great* example of headline bias
God I'll say though
Not sure what you mean with that last comment
It doesn't really matter why they're in - they could be a legitimate part of the story, but if they're sexualized, that still contributes to the trend equally - even more powerfully, honestly
You mentioned earlier that they wouldn't put characters in just to be sexualized, but, really, isn't that moving the goalposts?
you're correct that masculinity and capitalism are both contributing factors to make this worse, but don't be under the illusion it wouldn't be around without them
it's just you might get more examples of, say, sweaty post-workout buff ladies
as someone who reads lesbian authors it is not a men only thing
it's just most people in anime are underage, so when you need to flash panties....
I think the overall trend is driven by incidental coincidence, rather than the desire to be salacious and focus on underage

"anita sarkeesian is trying to take away our videogames" is just such an easy train to get hooked on when you're like 16 or whatever, it's understandable why so many kids go into that pipeline
I don't think it's the same fragment
It is, like most people, to make things better
But even if they're misguided, and that's an if, not a fact, their motivation is not to 'ruin' things
Look, maybe you have a different idea of a better world than they do
There is not this massive group out there 'out to ruin everything they touch'
ngl your approach to life sounds less like nihilism and more like hedonism
a wonderfully edgy statement that you can cling to without tough reasoning, because it means you get to be lazy
anyway, if you're concerned about preserving *current* biodiversity, you would be better served to get involved in things right now, because shoving popcorn and watching humanity implode is going to cost more of that than trying to take action
where nothing matters because everything ends anyway
hell yes I am, I'm talking with a nihilist
"earth" is really vague, we are not going to sterilize the earth and therefore biodiversity will exist again as an inevitability
time is inevitable
the biosphere will adapt to anything
earth will adapt to anything
2) if you mean biodiversity, fossil record emphatically suggests mass dieoffs translate into population explosions
1) earth isn't going anywhere

You did mention societal collapse and that's quite possible, but not extinction
I honestly give good odds that a nuclear war wouldn't be an extinction event
It'll slide from one state of being into the next until an extinction level event happens in a few thousand to a million years is the most likely call
there is no point where I think you will declare humanity the victor, as long as you've got the "hoho, I am the edgy observer born of humanity, but not part of it" thing going that probably every nerdy introvert had at some point
My point was since you aren't living forever, you will always be in a state of "well, it hasn't happened *yet,* but..."
considering you can't prove a negative, you'll never be pleasantly surprised
Be more honest in that you want to play more video games and consume more media
The world does not care
I mean, in your world view, the alternative is just wasting time until natural termination
The other conclusion to draw is that self-termination is the only meaningful action, which I assume you've already considered and discarded because it sucks
you sound depressingly like I did at 15, I hope you eventually see the same conclusion I did - nihilistic pessimism doesn't really do anything. If nothing matters and you can't ever fix things, the worst you can do is waste your effort by making it better for some
Humanity evolving into something greater would *necessitate* these kinds of conversations and evaluating on all levels of society how people interact with each other and treat each other unfairly
I think you were more honest about being a misanthrope and nihilist and less honest about caring about the future of your species
The fuck does that have to do with the future of your species?
no offense, but if you feel that way, I feel like you shouldn't participate in those discussions? And you *particularly* shouldn't be upset that they're ruining your 'entertainment'
misanthropic
because that 'counterpoint' has been pretty routinely dealt with for at least 8 years afaik
They certainly have before in some cases, but I think you must be new to these discussions
These exact kind of arguments are exactly why the rest of the stuff is still an uphill battle
Clearly, getting to see this character in a micro bikini or whatever has artistic merit that far outweighs any objection someone could have over objectification of female bodies
this is why people getting outraged at moderate visual censorship confuses me
it's the single strongest way to reinforce stuff like toxic masculinity
the entertainment business is a lot of why these things aren't in place
I was in your shoes for like 2 years, I get the thought processes
that line of argument doesn't work here because the "misunderstood savior" is a underdog-like empowerment story
this is someone who implied it's fine to fight for feminism as long as you don't touch their entertainment and videogames, so I assume sacrificing half the human race for better standard of life isn't an uncommon thought
it's not really morally grey though
but the war existed before that
and the slaughter is, arguably, war - just an unprovoked first strike
I mean context is sylvanas is the survivor of a plague that turns you into an undying zombie with implications it might taint your soul
I guess?
the morally grey part is she's evil but also hot
But no, I think I know the video you're talking about and no
Girl, they came out a few years ago as trans
I think these days most people wouldn't give a shit
they were like, the epitome of people associating autism and asperger fixations with cringe, since CWC had this whole universe where they were a self-insert hybrid of a pikachu and sonic, so 4chan and related parts of the internet basically feasted in glee
when you wanted to make fun of someone with autism or imply they had it or were otherwise a target to make fun of, you may well compare them to chris-chan/CWC
I have no idea how a criminal case would go down because I'm really not sure CWC is particularly capable of consent either
Particularly around the early 2010s, they were, pretty much against anyone's will, a poster-child/punching bag for people with autism
it just came out, this is fresh news
yeah, it's probably bad
honestly?
I don't think much has changed there
CWC was already an example for them of "look how mentally ill you are"
It's a thorny problem and always has been
People who aren't able to consent are still capable of pursuing relationships or attempting things they shouldn't, they still can't consent
I really don't know if I want to call them scum, it's really hard to judge someone that really isn't mentally capable of living independently
Why is this in serious discussion
Been a meme longer than that but yeah
the crime is particularly effective at raising disgust though, so it's going to be brought up and used even when people don't know them
turns out men are terrible at writing laws
This channel isn't really meant to scratch your need for super dark humor
it's not a development or anything, it's a bad joke that turned into an even worse joke with revealed events
I don't actually think this particularly belongs here, honestly
you'll note they aren't playing under the name of taiwan

Yeah, if you can find a hobby group it does a lot
Like it's this weird in between where 4 years of your life are highly different from the next 30
I don't really think of uni or college as adult life unless you're going postgrad
Then that's normal and ok
Adult offline friendships irl tend to be less about friend groups and more keeping up with individuals on a one to one basis
You'll be meeting 1-2 times a month in a healthy, highly active adult friend circle
IRL adult social circles are honestly less involved than HS ones
At worse you're a little worse off at reading facial expressions, I guess? But you will have ample opportunity to gain that skill in other contexts
I do not think online social circles prevent you from having any critical experiences that in-person ones give you
As someone who went through high school with her friend circle almost entirely online, I don't think it's a bad thing, and even less do I think that's an obvious conclusion. I certainly don't think I turned out malformed or anything because of it. Honestly, the reverse would be true; if I didn't form those friend circles, I'd be worse off. It's not like I made those friends *instead* of real friends. The kind of person I was, I would have just not had friends in high school.
I think the chain of jokes is kinda outliving its lifespan in this specific channel
That's the big data point that's very prevalent
You have almost no chance of death if vaccinated though
saw articles on A) a delta plus strain, and B) a lambda strain this morning
more
Online friendships do feel a little more durable when you're independent enough to take road trips or finance flights vs highschool
We need another plan long term, even if it's shots we get once or twice a year
I know someone who can't get vaccinated and they are basically a prisoner
The vaccines are better than nothing but they're not enough
The primary purpose is to prevent you from killing people with weak immune systems
The primary purpose of flu vaccines is not, actually, to keep you from dying to the flu
They're not, though
Covid will probably be similar
It's why you need a new flu shot every year
This is what virology is like, there is nothing special about covid other than it's effectivenss

Has been for a while
this is not the first time they've done something like this
"give us 100 dollars to be a True Patriot and have proof no one will care about"
It's just a fundraising gimmick
It's pretty much the opposite of what china would want out of one
It's worth mentioning that if covid were a bioweapon it'd be an economic weapon rather than a population assault
I'm not painting a comparison between the countries, I'm painting comparison between people who are prejudiced against the countries
There's a lot of good reasons to hate the US, your point doesn't seem relevant other than to defend a possible private stance man
Even if you're not after mass death it doesn't really tick boxes other than transmissibility
Honestly the real nail in the coffin is it really isn't suitable as a bioweapon
I mean, the people who think china started covid are people who want a reason to hate China, the parallel is stronger
"USA snuck in a bioweapon" is baby tier conspiracy theory
"I don't understand how anyone could believe this??" Was how it started, when a sizeable part of the US still believes 5g and magnets have something to do with it
They're both crazy theories man, the fact one is a degree crazier isn't relevant
Both viewpoints make sense assuming you have an axe to grind with ccp/usa
So does the US
Right
And that people just itch to blame
I believe that it originating from a Chinese lab as a bioweapon is pretty damn unlikely
I disagree that it's an emphatic yes
Sure, but is "the US stealthily released a bioweapon to blame on china" really that much more of a stretch
that's fair, since a lot of conspiracy theorists here think china made covid
I don't think american law really covers this very firmly
I expect it will be challenged but I'm not sure on what basis - probably a EU law
Which would be a degenerate, really distorted version of an already bad approach to communism, but there is that
It is a state-owned capitalism which means it may be a form of planned economy
I don't think she's a horrible (as in below average) person or anything, but as a public persona, and *especially* as the kind of 'defacto spokesperson for trans women' deal she was pulling in the mid-late 2010s, I find her very lacking
I never made time to watch her 2-3 hour video on it, but she responded very inelegantly to  every time she screwed up badly enough that it'd echo through the twitterverse enough that it came across my feed
there was insinuation that people being upset with her were alt-right types trying to deplatform her instead of her having a problem
people who make *leftist* video essays
and, well, dance with the devil long enough
yeah, honestly, contra being included in 'breadtuber' is a little... odd? for me? because half their platform is flirting with the alt right to try to 'rehabilitate' or whatever
the nonbinary takes were twitter posts, mostly
contrapoints finally deleted any goodwill I had for them with their nonbinary takes
I do not find that sus
If someone wants to shut down kiwifarms to stop someone from leaking their stuff
I struggle to imagine what really needs public doxxing and harassment
If someone has something to leak, they can give it to the police
Parler has shown us you can do permanent lasting damage that fundamentally changes a platform
it's easier to give up and say you can't do anything because it'll always be there
sure, whatever, but the more you do it, the less established it is
there are no leaks that kiwifarms could provide that would give me reason to want it to operate for even a nanosecond longer
I hope kiwifarms somehow dies forever
oh rad
basically, hot air gets gathered due to reasons, and then it gets kinda stuck under higher pressure colder air and gets 'squeezed' (I've never been 100% clear on the mechanics of that), but when you squeeze a gas it gets hotter, so it just gets worse
I think tools like that are useful for keeping yourself safe, but I think they're much less useful for supplementing critical thinking
You mean, people criticizing a trans personality get marked by an extension that lacks oversight that highlights people who criticize trans people?
these paragraphs in particular are very <:YumiStare:688429724065988721> if russia actually has no influence on wikileaks
> The New York Times also noted that in 2012, as WikiLeaks was running out of money, a television program hosted by Assange began airing on the Kremlin-financed news organization Russia Today.

> Michael Weiss, an editor at the Daily Beast and columnist at Foreign Policy, said WikiLeaks has declined to publish material that might have embarrassed the Russian government.

https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/mar/18/wikileaks-russias-useful-idiot-its-agent-influence/ politifact goes on "well there's no proof, and they've done some stuff that doesn't 100% fit that narrative," but it also ends on 
> "That's one hell of a coincidence," Weiss said, referring to the record of WikiLeaks‚Äô and Russia‚Äôs congruent interests. "If you're a U.S. intelligence officer you don't believe in such coincidences."
the 2016 election kinda blew open the fact that wikileaks is pretty directly paid for by russia
maybe just far-right
actually maybe not even alt-right
wikileaks is kinda only trusted by alt-right now
yeah

You leak something to kiwifarms when you literally want the victim to kill themselves
There's like probably about 10 various places I would try to leak before kiwifarms
they should just give it to the cops
Vyn you've spent like 10 posts saying "well maybe you should be concerned," no shit you had a feeling it wouldn't be about people just enjoying it?
context is critical here
*instead of kiwifarms*
yes
because it's *fun*
just that kiwifarms is about attempting to publically humiliate, bully, and drive people to suicide
No, I wasn't saying police *isn't* bad
Kiwifarms has never, once, been about justice
This isn't about finding justice
For the *alternative* to policing
<@!379337518371307522> do you realize what you're suggesting
No, hold up
they should just give it to the cops
I don't think there's a single thing you can reply to this that can't be answered with "they should just give it to the cops"
Do not expect this article to cause a pivot
If they were one group they might, but when each person is only like 1% of the problem its easy to shrug it off or the rest to solve
I mean, for that matter, ||mentally retarded|| was regular nomenclature at one time
The people are choosing to put their pleasure over a stance on the issue. Even if that's human behavior, I'm not going to say you *shouldn't* judge them over that - that line is difficult to pin down and everyone makes it on a case by case basis
I think even if they aren't "bad people" that doesn't mean they aren't deserving of criticism - I think the "bad people" argument is attempting to oversimplify
I don't think good/bad is a binary thing
definitely a *very* strong argument for piracy there

I'm not going to remove this post but I am going to warn against this being a precedent

Eminemby
what is going on
I have no idea what you two have been discussing for like a week now
most people who use ||trap|| wouldn't label themselves any kind of feminist, in my experience
The overlap between TERFs and weebs is pretty narrow
None of them are going to call you ||trap||, but yes they all hate you
they now claim TERF is a 'slur'
TERFs haven't gone by "TERF" in 5+ years, fwiw
Anyway, I wanted to mention, please think twice before dumping racist or transphobic material in this chat just to 'own' them, considering whether the "haha, gotcha" is worth reminding people that people hate their existence and they live in a hostile world. If there's not an actual discussion to be had, it can be harmful.
but if I had to make a 5 second decision to investigate further, I'd scroll past them unless pressured further
Right
I'd not classify them as TERFs, but I'd also stay away from them for my safety
Meiyi, I'm going to be frank
when you add stuff to the venus symbol it becomes a different symbol
that is not the venus symbol
'gender critical,' their term for TERF
they have already pretty much stolen it
I already associate the venus sign with GC movements
wrinkle in time

He is correct in saying there was never going to be a right time
He did say "the buck stops here" before passing the buck, so that's something I guess
I'm pretty done talking to you about this because I'm currently doing something else and you're cherry picking comments to engage in a discussion that doesn't make sense
the conclusion
Not the war in afghanistan
No
I think you're currently arguing and not sure why you're arguing
Okay but this isn't about why the US invaded
From my point of view trying to say people are more responsible than the Taliban for the fall of the afghan government is like saying the gas is more responsible than the car in getting me to the store
I have no idea what you're trying to get at
"The Taliban, 55% ranked among top three most responsible"
which explains the percentages adding up well over 100
It seems to imply people could pick their top 3
because it seems like a slam dunk that the taliban are the most responsible for the fall of the afghan government, no matter what your personal agenda is
interesting that taliban is only 55%, I'm curious exactly how this survey looked
average american smarter than I thought
On some levels yes but you really do run into slippery slope arguments if you start banning anyone who's sinned outside of your area of responsibility
at least, that's Twitter's take on it
the issue is "are they using twitter to do the bad things"
The issue isn't "do they do bad things"
GOP still has a twitter account after all
There's nothing wrong with being a violent, war-hungry regime that wants to oppress swaths of the population as long as you don't tweet about it
I admit I don't see the hypocrasy here
I think onlyfans is 100% aware they're fucked
But it's better for them than the alternative
I think they know they're going to slowly die
Damned if they do damned if they don't, apparently
Onlyfans is apparently operating in the red and can't get outside investment without changing policy
also I found doctors are pretty good about knowing when you're on slightly-risky medication and will do stuff like ask for blood tests every 6 months or so just to make sure you're holding up fine
Anyway, 'restricted substance' isn't the same as illegal, and if you got a doctor's prescription, I wouldn't worry too much about it
mostly higher production of certain happy chemicals
Atomoxetine isn't a narcotic, it looks like; though it's achieving a few similar endgoals
The fact it's a restricted drug does not make it a problem
What I'm getting at is that even if it was one of the narcotic varieties - (I'd suspect you'd know; there's usually extra paperwork or precautions you have to jump through when picking up those medications legally, I had to deal with it enough times) I don't think you should be concerned excessively about it
They're physically addictive in the way that your body suddenly acts very poorly if you crash off of it rather than slowly lowering dosage (believe me, I did it several times when I was younger), but it's not something that causes you to have a need to take it, like nicotine or whatever
Basically, speed
the comments people make about ADD medication that you're worried about is that many ADD medication is a form of narcotic - generally an amphetamine of some sort, more related to meth than it is cocaine or opioids (which have the opposite effect)
So
you could look for a plugin that blocks websites or limits your time on them
this is specific to california but that's a massive part of their ecosystems

Those kind of comments might be a sign that someone had problematic attitudes towards women or something but it isn't, in itself, anything offensive
I think this goes beyond "sexualization is wrong" though and is arriving into "you should be judged for being attracted to people"
It's a sign Greenland may be thawing which is *pretty bad news*
The reason it's never rained there before is because previously, it has snowed.

It frequently did so by playing around with cultural 'boogeymen' of the time, leading to a lot of crass and bad concepts
The mark of the exploitation film was that it's not meant to make any statements whatsoever but is meant as a momentary thrill ride
If you want modern comparisons to exploitation films I would suggest stuff like Saw, but also marvel films are kind of that, but scaled up
But I think pug was talking more about stuff like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaxploitation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_film
Seeing black men as protagonists is probably the simplest, but it was also instrumental in developing stuff like funk or other African American cultural gems into more mainstream appeal
Blaxploitation was definitely better than this because it left some enduring positive cultural traits
Also most iphones have the ability to ignore settings to not connect to stuff
So "no net connection" is not an issue
I do want to add to this, they're not aiming at people taking new pictures with this, they're looking at people sharing circulating stuff
There's also the question of what are the consequences of false positives
Oh yes it's a terrible idea
That said if you have a phone with no net connection you have a camera, not a phone
I'd assume the cp check would be done locally personally
Not passing the photos themselves, only a flag that something's tripped the algorithm
If it's an algorithm that runs on the phone and doesn't pass any data back other than "some photos were suspicious" that may arguably be remote enough that it is not actually compromising any personal data
I'm not sure about that
I think focusing on that is minimizing talking about actual problems this will introduce
I think A is a little farfetched but there's still enough reasons to say this is a very bad idea
because they have a complex about 4 letter things
It was never explained but from context I think it's the rwby fandom
"you literally first took a glance at this problem I threw at your feet 10 minutes ago and came to a conclusion I don't like, you're biased" is childish as hell
Please don't come swinging to people who are *actually* unconnected to the problem with the accusation of bias when you're *invested* in one side
this is less a discussion and more a vent
you know there is the third option to not put it anywhere
I think I have to repeat, "so what?"
"so what?"
but I do kind of want to ask
Maybe I haven't been getting enough sleep lately
it had huge early 2000s JRPG "we want to pretend we're being progressive" energy
as long as you acknowledge it's your perspective
I think if you share your perspective into the social divide of the fandom/antifandom it would add to the discussion, at this point, vyn
And most people I've talked to thought it was underwhelming, which is the normal response to shows that spend a year, or multiple years, building it up
I remember Doctor Who did the Bad Wolf plotline around the same time as Lost was big

They're *correlated* to gender
they're not tied to gender

If the government does not pick up the needed slack, that is a failure of government, but that does not make it acceptable for a private solution
Businesses should not be allowed to take this step
I don't see this as a rights issue
I mean, there's news reports of anti-maskers 100 years ago
but the rhetoric still has a hole in it, Matt
There are new issues to deal with and new decisions to make
influenza is a precedent
it's not
you are literally asking people to prove they have AIDS, Matt
In some cases
And how are you going to verify this
People who crusade to force the antivaxxers to get shots and throw penalties around for not getting a shot literally never consider people who *can't*
It really doesn't matter
I think this idea of *forcing you to subsidize your healthcare* is a horrible road you do not want to touch
I'm okay with businesses mandating vaccine for employment
This rhetoric always throws immunocompromised people under the bus
A) they're a business, fining people isn't really their place, and has bad implications with private healthcare

more important, B) the wording has nothing to do with refusing to get the vaccine, it has everything to do with not getting the vaccine, thus it is now a *significant* disability tax
This is probably the worst solution to "do we require shots or not"
I half wonder if they were hoping everyone would comment on that and not the fact that we're just letting businesses force employees to subsidize their own health care
I think you might need to take a step away, Matt
Who the fuck are you to accuse us of doing that?
But you seem to be trying to go "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR YOUR COUNTRY" here
But you can in aggregate, Matt
but if you think anyone in this discord server has the power to effect actual change by themselves, you're fucking delusional
I think your assaults on us not doing enough are completely out of line, quite honestly. If you think it's worth corporations deciding who lives and dies rather than the government, that is on you
I can no longer do that if I want to not be homeless
I've spent time in foodbanks before
My options are literally A) do nothing, B) make calls and donate 20 dollars occasionally and C) cry, Matt
get into political activism if you're this driven, Matt
I'm a discord mod, what, exactly, are you suggesting *I* do? My solution is for the government to take steps.
because it led to discriminatory action
Matt that's why health information became private in the first place
Do not be upset at me that you don't see the other path, Matt
**both decisions continue to let people die**
It's like the delusion of cryptocurrency, you're taking a loan out on future resources with no intent of repayment
it's killing different people in the future
It's not, though
It's not. But how does that justify a different unconscionable act?
I'm sorry, it is now my personal responsibility they're dying because people in power aren't doing things correctly despite me taking actions to encourage them to do so?
And I think you vastly underestimate how ***fucking frustrating*** everyone in this chat finds this dilemma Matt, but *that doesn't make the ends justify the means*
Correct
I do not think there is a third ethical solution
It's literally pressure the government or continue watching the tragedy unfold
...Not let companies demand access to medical info and pressure the government to act
that's completely legit as long as *you can't prove that was the reason*
and you don't hire them, or you fire them for that reason
If you find out someone has a medical condition you don't like
Matt you're kind of naive on this
and they will continue using this new power to do that in the future.
It is the government's duty to protect us. It will never be a company's duty to protect us; they are taking these actions to protect themselves.
I do want to point out that that would be the opposite point than you have been advocating for
This isn't a simple "save lives" this is a trolley problem of whose lives you want to save.
People will die, down the line, due to this ideology.
The ends do not justify the means past a point, because the means are going to cause additional suffering down the line.
Everyone's been really nice to you so far with the kind of stuff you're throwing out
I suggest you take that break, Matt
If you're disgusted at this chat instead of the powers that be, you've lost sight of how power works
My solution isn't to do nothing, you're the one who thinks political change is impossible here
Not that this is that exactly but Islamic groups going for each other's throats is very long-standing

Oh, that's true, and I even have warning logs for some people for it
Carol, I'm gonna be real - your problem with 'antis' is that they harass people because they think other people should be uncomfortable about stuff too, right? Nobody here does this that I've seen, but whenever it comes up, you very loudly push back and judge people for being uncomfortable with media. You're basically an anti-anti, overreacting in a similar way.

I don't necessarily want you to go, but if that's what you're going to dedicate your interactions on this server to, I don't see it being particularly productive for anyone, y'know? People have the right to be uncomfortable about something, as has been pointed out.

The study suggested a correlation of about 750 per year per inch
Height disparity is almost never a conscious outcome and so you can't really chase people down for doing it
Because there isn't a clear solution to move forward on it, other than the solutions that work for other inequalities, like unions or not keeping pay differences secret
subconciously humans appear to translate height into confidence
they also get hired more
but it's an unconventional law and there isn't exactly a lot of precedent
Like all laws, it's legal until/unless a judge declares it illegal
they just have to not be illegal
laws don't have to be sane to be valid
But a suit of Person A vs Person B can't really establish that Texas shouldn't be doing this
you have State of Texas vs Planned Parenthood and that can go up to the top
If the government's bringing a clinic to justice
So
but by making it a civil suit damage, they're trying to circumvent it
is because *if the government was punishing them*, it'd be much easier to strike it down for being unconstitutional
but okay the real reason they're doing it this way
(both uber and lyft have come out and said they're covering legal fees for any driver working for them this dumb shit happens to)
So if you found out someone was getting an abortion, you could sue them, everyone who worked at their clinic, and their uber driver for 10k each
there is no maximum
the minimum damages awarded are 10k
for taking the effort to find out and report it : )
you didn't even get to the maybe most horrific part of this from just a law-making standpoint, that anyone who helps essentially has a bounty placed on their head and people can turn them in/sue them for cash money

if they win the suit, the defendant has to pay up to the accuser, *and* pay the accuser's legal fees. On the other hand, if the defendant successfully proves themselves innocent, they're *not entitled* to countersuit for *their* legal fees.
Being killed makes you a martyr
Being punched in the face discredits you as weak
But I think if someone had instead killed him, the symbol would have worked in reverse
It's worth noting that getting punched in the face was probably hugely relevant to Spencer getting his life ruined because it became such a symbol
he was the prime organizer of one of the biggest white nationalist movements
okay but you being a fool about what fame means isn't pertinent
He wasn't a celeb
and by 'formerly' we're talking like 5 years ago, not like, a former life time
Formerly one of the biggest american nazis
In related news, Richard Spencer's life is thoroughly ruined, with no need of attempted assassination
I was bullied pretty regularly in middle school but that turned into just being a loner in HS and literally nothing from those days except my diploma matters

This bullying has shaped and altered you until your ethical beliefs are grounded on the premise that they should be dead and it should be okay to kill people who hurt people the way they do.

That's a pretty huge part of yourself you've kept totally secret from your parents.
That's... Not what I meant
You've let it fester in you until you want them dead. I think if you want them to do their best job in caring and raising you, you should let them worry.
The walled garden may merely have a crack in it, but it's a very expensive crack
Apple vs Epic - they both lost, but Apple lost a lot bigger
https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1436372920285204481?s=19
the second isn't really support for or against being nb but the first one especially is a hint at it yes
at all
Maybe even stop putting them on banners
I'm not sure this stops Tencent from trying to establish market dominance outside of china
I'm not sure this is really going to affect as much as people think it is, though
really curious if they're going to redesign venti
China passed something a week or two ago banning effeminate men in videogames
There is still no good outcome of telling your family you dream about them killing you
Don't tell them and tell your therapist instead
if apple tries to stipulate that those things are needed in contracts, contempt of court
those payment sources are not required to be the same price
They can no longer stop apps from hosting links to external payment sources
oh I forgot to mention, rady's point of "what if apple does the bad thing anyway" will get them slapped with contempt of court
lmao get fucked apple
Shares fell as much as 3.5% following the ruling before paring losses to 2.3% to $150.49 1:24 p.m. in New York.
But Apple could probably request a much smaller amount and Epic would say yes just to get this settled, I'd expect
Actually yeah I didn't think about that
You're right, Apple could refuse to allow Epic on their marketplace at all
Which Apple will probably accept
If apple did that, and someone sued saying "hey this is dumb" I guarantee apple would have to pay all legal fees
I mean, it does imo
that's the contract Epic violated and is why Epic is paying out
Because that's... what they did, rady
I'd say that would only be a valid move if they did not require all apps to be on their marketplace
Judging from the *spirit* of this ruling
Which that is certainly one conclusion you could draw from studying hikkikimori-ism in their neighbors
the youth are wasting their time/passion etc, they must be proper chinese youths and spend their time better
no, this is a cultural purity thing
it'll not have an effect on the market at all, really
Of course, if China's trying to ban videogames pretty much totally
Maaaaaaaaybe? But the list of games that put effeminate characters in is generally aiming at a pretty niche market in the first place
Mihqyo
That'd be my expectation
with no new content internationally ever
definitely no longer obtainable in CN
I couldn't say
If china does get more aggressive though who knows where it'll end
It doesn't really matter because I do not care enough about genshin to try to figure out what you meant
Yeah, okay, I still don't know what you're talking about because that would imply the opposite of what you said
and you do not have to spoiler content in here
I have no idea what any of that means
That avoids having to refund anyone
Venti will never see story content again and probably no longer be obtainable
I think Maya's solution is probably the most likey
it was against effeminate men
The ban wasn't against girly dresses
Or nothing to happen to them.
and I don't know, first time I saw venti I thought they were a girl, so... I don't expect their design to be untouched.
it matters if he 'inspires' people to 'become gay'
It doesn't matter if venti is gay
yeah, they do sometimes gouge and they do sometimes harm efficiency
I'm not sure which one because I don't even think they're anti-capitalist
that unions are evil and gouge and anti-capitalist and harm productivity and efficiency and everyone's wellbeing
there's *so much* money invested in that, it's become one of the core tenets of the Conservative religion
Because of the money invested in the former's opposition
so you need *disproportionate* caring about stuff that doesn't directly affect most people
and is going to get a lot farther
perhaps, but if you throw the same amount of effort into "we should enforce unions" as you do into "it's fucked up that you can't play fortnite on an iphone because apple wants 30%", one's going to find less money being thrown at it from the opposition
I think there is still room for that kind of discussion, but it does smack of avarice that people only care about what affects them - or, more often than not, interrupts their entertainment
but my netflix show was cancelled!!!
I don't think it's morally noble or anything, but it's also not a moral injustice to, say, stop shoplifters
I know people act like Youtube is some neutral archive; it's not. people barely pay enough to keep wikipedia running, a truly free video hosting system is a pipedream unless a government wants to fund it with tax dollars
though I would argue that preventing youtube from monetizing is a perfectly justifiable reason to ban them
there's frequently a premium option
Players, organizations, or venues
That's something I wouldn't exactly want anyone profiting off of
Theres also the point that other fighting game communities aren't going around making "better versions" of products
Politicians who push for conflict and intervention as foreign policy
the hawks are now pretty quiet compared to the late 90s/early 00s

that was later, with iraq
America might be imperialist, but it wasn't 'just an excuse for imperialism'
that is far more visceral and personal in terms of how it hits the psyche than a natural disaster or a pandemic and thus the response was different
the difference between 9/11 and hurricanes is that 9/11 was a wakeup call that someone wants you dead and is trying to accomplish it

But you can be a practitioner without being competitive quality
They don't, and your body just gets older yes
Think of it as boot camp for the next step of your life?
You could always look at getting a full time job for a few years and then finishing your degree
I mean, the full time masters degree isn't very compatible with a part time job no
But not a lot more
I do want to point out a full time job gives you a little more time than a full time school year
It'll be interesting to see how it affects the esports market
but I don't think banning videogames are going to be a factor in it
China's policies are certainly going to do that
Yeah
It's my belief focus should be on minimizing harm, not maximizing vengence
Thinking about who deserves to be punished is almost never productive in sociology
Right, the group who... isn't going to suffer
the government isn't going to suffer
That's a stupid take
yes, I'm sure the chinese people totally deserve to suffer
But sticking to these is giving up too much profit
previously their rules actually caused worldwide adjustments a little
going this far actually will decrease china's influence on worldwide gaming
It's kinda interesting
if your mentality is that gaming glorification is "poisoning society"
banning esports would make sense, mind you
I don't know how "no rewards from pvp content" is supposed to be interpreted
Also did they just completely ban all esports?
in the past skeletons have been banned but ghosts haven't
banned 4 times over lol
actually among us is like
üòî
just realized among us is banned
Even if some of them "deserve" the scorn, a lot of urban liberals paint the entire region with the same brush
They have a horrific covid death rate? "haha, I thought they wanted to win elections"
Something bad happens to the south, democrat voters jump on saying "serves them right"
It's honestly a huge problem in American politics
Yeah I think it's not a hot take to say that kind of joke doesn't really help anything
"how much you weigh?"
"Ah bout 5 stone mate"
English imperial measurement is honestly even worse than the American version
My favorite part about that video is how the dude starts nervously talking about how it still has minor glitches after the incident
I'm sure they want driverless cars eventually but why not test it now? Y'know, ethics aside
Yeah
Only at the point where no one needs to be in the driver's seat
Being told their testing has to be government approved
That's probably the thing they're actually scared of
Tesla is probably trying to shut this down so people don't start asking for more government oversight
So yeah
bet you no one who almost got hit gets compensated, and I'm not even sure Tesla would say they were liable if they *did* get hit
"test out the betas in live cars that are driving on roads with people who aren't consenting"
it shows that tesla's 'test' plan is
I dunno about this
The original post came off a bit passive aggressive to me but I think that was the imprecision of text
I agree with that on the surface, but that doesn't mean you necessarily have the first comment to make
I agree on this one there's not exactly anything to monologue about
I mean it's not really one? I don't think we've made it one unless I've had a stroke
If a pattern of dropping inflammatory articles is established, that will be addressed
I think that's a policy that isn't out of place here, yes, and I think that Vyn would hopefully be *willing* to discuss stuff posted, but hit and runs are only a problem with controversial stuff
I'm going to ask that if users have problems with how other users behave in this channel they bring it to staff rather than being aggressive
I'm going to ask that if users have problems with how other users behave in this channel they bring it to staff rather than being aggressive
it is a ~hot mess~
in that case, let me also bring up the internal docs also talked about how facebook knew 1/3 teens that used instagram had body image problems and said instagram was a direct contributing factor to it
oh
Apple almost pulled them from the store at one point because they refused to do anything about info they had on human trafficking
leaked internal documents came out and it turns out facebook's been doing less than the bare minimum about things they knew about
facebook has a considerable amount of bad press this week
More like the promised land stuff is related to why Taliban exist but is otherwise not much involved in these specific conflicts
Only incredibly distantly
Which is why they fell
It wasn't exactly a healthy relationship because afghan government needed the us forces to remain in power
They had authorization from the recently deposed afghan government
Oh
"authorization" is because the US put the government in power in the first place
US did have "authorization" to conduct operations in Afghanistan from the former government
Unless you're militarily stronger
Because you can't invade another country and detain their citizens
If they say "it was an accident *shrug*" that's where it ends
Right, that's up to the US
Saying "we won't buy from the us" hurts someone else more than the US
The only worldwide non aggressive tool countries can really use to noncompliant countries is economic sanctions
If the US refuses to punish someone for it, what is another country going to do?
What are you proposing people do
I'm sorry
2008 world economy crash happened because the US real estate market ate shit
If china or america suffers, your country suffers
Everyone realized that china and american economies are too large to really do anything to them without hurting yourself
You might have noticed no one is doing anything to china either
Like what
There are plenty of reasons to be terrified of living in the us and this doesn't make the top 1000
I guess I'm saying "gosh if they drone strike people in the middle east you must be scared in the us" just sounds a bit clownish
Yeah
US has been in a "war crimes don't count if they're in the middle east" frenzy for about 30 years
Oh that would absolutely be a crime if done against *American* citizens
Because US does not currently drone strike its own territories
I'd argue that reasoning would be to not live *not* in the US
Altercation, disruption, incident
80% of US drone strike casualties to date have been civilians
But don't hold your breath
It might be enough of a kerfuffle for something to happen

Not as per us law, but internationally there is a case, yes

But I didn't see the slur in there so I didn't read it that close I guess
Not him
The snowflakes thing was people responding to this I thought
Is chicken shit a slur?
Though it depends what they're trying to coerce someone to do
*as long as it's true*
I think a news media can threaten to publish something
I'm not fully sure
Smart traffic lights use the same tech
It should work in conductive materials, especially ones that form loops
Traditional metal detectors try to induce a electric current in their field and then read for generated fields
It's conductive
They should

some libertarians are anarcho-capitalists in disguise
back in 2018, but it's like, yeah, this is what libertarians are like

this is footage from a libertarian party debate
it is not
this is going to seem like a parody
My bet is no
Let's see if they're smart and make an audio-only option
to use an extreme example
sexualization, for example, belongs in porn
but if it's *part of the work,* I think it changes
sneaky sexualization to say "women should just be like this" or "they're here to be eyecandy" is defintely bad
It depends on some elements I think
Could be worse, could be weeklong coverage over one missing white girl and her probably-murderer boyfriend
I'll be honest I have no idea what model is what
Maybe there's some 'but' I'm not aware of or maybe figuring it out was too rough on them ~~or maybe having anything have a manual option was insulting to Elon~~
That works generally yeah
Oh I see
Teslas may have motors in each wheel- if they do, disconnection gets harder and even electrical disconnection won't stop the motors from heating
Fucking stupid design flaw but it's working as intended
Because there's no way to decouple wheels from the power train so it would forcibly generate power and overheat systems
There is no override
Teslas cannot be put in neutral without power
Apparently it's an issue that an inverter can occasionally blow leaving the battery effectively dead
Nah
Employers can ask but schools might not be able
Health privacy laws
but the topic wasn't about anime in the specific but about the phenomenon in the general
Though the most harmful of this all is of course, live action stuff
body image problems aren't all that rare
Solo you really seem intent on that phrase and I don't know if I agree
Sexualization being in a *specific* work may have a point, but there is genuine harm in the fact there's pressure to put it in *all* works, and not show other body types - or reduce them to joke or villain roles
Oh, I don't know it should be brushed aside so easily
(though yoko taro has also admitted he just likes girls and he likes girls in heels)
Right, but for Nier you could argue the sexualization *has an artistic point*
'flaw'
especially since when Nier came out, Kaine was supposed to be a very pretty lady with a uh
Nier is probably not the best medium for this topic since I'd argue that since a lot of the topics are "what is human" "what is more than human" and "What is less than human," portrayals of 'perfection' are probably directly intended to be thematically appropriate
I'm a fan of the OSHA policy update
If you need a key you lock your doors <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Everything I've seen suggests the world economy is doing well aside from the UK
What makes you think that
The two ways members of Congress hold the government hostage is through the debt ceiling and through dragging their feet on funding agreements
Debt limit just means you can't borrow more but I do see your point
Even just having faith shaken would be bad
The Dollar has a much bigger need to be a reliable money supply though
my asking price would now be for 2 of the special objects instead of just 1 after the supply had doubled, in theory
the math on inflation doesn't perfectly fit this analogy but it allows one to kind of understand *how* recklessly printing money means everyone has less 'buying power'
the original 3 are now worth half as much, yes?
someone manages to make 3 more
let's say there's 3 of something in the world and they are worth a lot, but you can't tell the difference between them or any copies
yes that is basically the enormous problem
I also don't think the executive branch has the freedom to do this easily anyway
doing nothing and running out of money for programs and shutting down the government will probably do less harm than printing the money needed to make up the difference
in theory I suppose printing money could solve this problem but it is basically the worst solution possible
tldr it's not about printing more money, it's about congressionally approved budgets requiring the executive branch borrowing more than congress will permit it to
here you go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIbkoop4AYE
ok yep it's the debt ceiling
there's a few ways the government can effectively run out of money, let me read up on what's going on
This is kind of why people are pushing for everyone to wear masks - if they were wearing a mask, them coughing wouldn't be a huge deal
I hope that person manages to figure out addiction kills and ruins lives without first hand experience
That's fucking rough
Kinda like how banks are pretty willing to loan to you after bankruptcy
It's worth noting that, on paper, the loans can be afforded at lower rates and to more credit scores because there's no risk of defaulting
I'm not sure you can be heavily nationalist without an idea of how 'a good [nationality] citizen is supposed to behave/think/act'
Ah
I'm not sure I understand the question
they want to avoid stuff where you can choose the dark side, basically
They *do* care about people being critical but I don't think that's why they're taking out moral choices
Authoritarians are very big on moral panics and people 'not acting like they Should‚Ñ¢Ô∏è'
I think while you might not be wrong entirely, it's not the reason they're consciously using
getting to play as a bad guy encourages moral degredation etc etc
But yes, a china-based gatcha game will definitely fall in step
Most Western games will abandon the market rather than compromise this much - from what I hear, profit is already reduced from extra development requirements and having to sell through Chinese companies
and yeah twitter flickered for a moment from traffic pickup
most of that probably because of the data breach
-4%
because lowering friction in social interactions improves lifestyles
You can be *worth* being nice to even while people are being nice to you because that's the nice thing to do
I do want to ask, what is it about people who *aren't* nice to everyone that makes you want their time and affection?
This does mean you need to trust them with your passwords
There are services that let you use multiple devices
A decent solution as long as your list of passwords remains secure
That's the risk that still remains with 2fa
Do you use that password *anywhere* else?
It won't get them into your twitch, but
Depends matt
Not before
Changing your password would only help after the data leak that involved that password list
Meaning if someone gets a list of scrambled passwords (generally what happens during most "sensitive data" leaks), they'll have a huge headstart on unscrambling it
If you change your password, it will still use the same system to scramble it
Sure
The simpler act would be to change the hash function and then force reset all passwords
The fun thing about this is changing your password won't help at all
If theyre not shit about it though knowing the algorithm shouldn't make the hashes decipherable
As long as the hashing function is public it is *less* secure, potentially
Even if they don't include passwords
You're right though
Mind you this is just a post on Twitter, but...

I think expectations to commute from Scotland to London every day is probably a bit much
It *is* true that housing in government centers is usually pricey
does BBC have any impartiality doctrines
France...
So he's bringing up the thing in Texas Biden polls the worst on

If they can get into your email they can reset most passwords

there's no minimum age to possessing a firearm in texas, though sale is limited to 18+
It just cuts out *most* of it and this is all a numbers game
Particulate *does* escape out the edges of masks if not fitted, which they almost never are
I don't think a face shield is really much worse than single masking
Also I'm thinking about it and like
I personally think if you get in someone's car for an extended car ride you have zero ability to reasonably protect yourself regardless
I think it's correct to be concerned about it, but there's room in between "careless" and "doomsday catastrophe"
Especially if you and your family is vaccinated, the risk is present but minimized
Covid is a threat but it's not ebola
Are you immunocompromised or is your family?
zmand I've noticed this before but you're kinda hyperbolic about your response to covid
I'm not even sure Uber can even ask the status of their drivers, since they're not employees
I feel like that isn't on those companies or even those drivers to a legally liable extent and nor should it be
If you're not comfortable travelling with strangers you do not know the status of, you should not use those services
Does your family have covid
No it's being at pride that gets you into trouble I think
If you show some people having fun at pride and then you air a panel on some small study suggesting hormone therapy is dangerous that's equal coverage right üôÉ
It's basically a paid advisory service
until it got so bad someone got you therapy
previously if you were unhappy you'd just be alone in being unhappy
the only difference regarding people being unhappy now vs before - aside from current stuff like corona - is that now people can find corners of the internet that they can talk with peopl about it and get small amounts of help
It wouldn't be, except your luddism is persistently making you unhappy
it's progressed beyond the point where you like human contact and is now at the point where you detest online in general
I think you have a slight tech phobia of some sort lectric, to be honest
The bible has a pretty famous story about kicking out moneylenders
You can accept a notice that you slipped up without it meaning that you're a failure
learning to accept that you'll fuck up and mistakes are part of life is long-term helpful, I used to care way more about small stuff like that
But I think there's a distinction between "this game mechanic is in itself an immoral act with implications in reality" and "this game mechanic could be harmful if implemented badly"
I mean, sure, and you also shouldn't commit real life crimes as part of an AR game. There are obviously limits.
I agree some things are iffy and some things are outright disrespectful
I refer you to when I asked you to critique it on a case by case basis of implementation rather than wholesale saying they shouldn't be featured
It also depends if you're going to take this opportunity to police genres much older than videogames, because horror has the 'insanity' thing baked into it thanks to Lovecraft etc
Depends how you define fun
Normally I would call stuff like watching people burn alive in detail suffer porn that aren't really tasteful, but a game could do something like Spec Ops The Line and leverage that for a constructive aspect that really defines a narrative
There's room to critique how something is implemented without just saying it shouldn't be used ever, I think
I think "this shouldn't be a game mechanic because it's serious" is like saying "you shouldn't get to put this in any creative work because it's serious"
Hallucinations are also something you can inflict *on the player*; getting shellshocked or other such things is something you only inflict *on their character*
(Fun as in engagement and entertainment rather than just an endorphin rush)
Having your character not be under your control is rarely considered entertaining or engaging and generally the only games that do it to a significant degree are indie games that have some pretentious concept that they value higher than fun
But something like PTSD - unless you go full flashback like I think some call of duties have done - is less viable as a game mechanic because that's the kind of debilitating thing that *removes* player control, rather than gives them something different to react to
Psychosis and such are the kinds of things that are on paper interesting to explore in a video game - reacting to things that aren't really there is gameplay
whether they are enjoyable design is another topic, but unpaid lootboxes aren't any less ethical than getting to play poker with monopoly money
or zelda oracle of season/ages, where they were literally called gacha seeds
lootboxes can be ethical, like in xenoblade 2
yeah I gotta say I feel it's unlikely much responsibility lies on baldwin here
Recklessly reinforcing stereotypes and teaching students that these are okay jokes to make is outright causing harm
I'd hesitate to use that word myself but I believe it would apply to an incident of causing harm
Sure, but if two people got hurt that supports the idea that fragmentation happened

A blank gun could still cause problems if the gun failed in a critical way
I think it's worth mentioning I haven't come across any article confirming it was a live round

I mean the words "Canada, indigenous, school" combine to reference something far worse than the video being discussed
Idk the kid sitting there filming it is probably experiencing a lot of direct harm
Imo anyway
Hey counterpoint: if my friend does something shitty and never acknowledges they did something shitty I think less of them and want to be their friend less. Letting bygones be bygones is the right of the person harmed, not the person who has to make amends.

A lot probably has to do with the fact hurricanes get imbued with a lot of energy from hot water and also get "pushed" by the Coriolis effect
I want to just mention this is not really designed as a venting space but as a discussion space
I assume there was an attachment over a physical item
What would you like to discuss regarding this?
It'd help a lot with the massive drought
Cross your fingers for massive snow buildup
This is overall good news though
I'm excited for rain though I think I'm too south
while I agree with the thrust of this I would actually have a small counterpoint that you *cannot* be an activist about every issue
This sounds like it would be an incredibly unpopular policy
You would also be telling the mom "no, you have too much money and you're not getting x amount"
I don't think a divorce tax would go over well
Damn I'm sorry I missed your funeral, that's brutal
Ah, I understand what you meant now, thank you
Then I disagree that you've pointed out a moderation problem with the way you've explained it, would you like to elaborate?
"you only get to post in here if you are 'approved'"
That sounds like wishing for some kind of purity test or something
I'm more confused what "allow anyone to freely put stuff in this chat" means
Oof
Wasn't that defense "he has autism and so therefore he will commit suicide" or something? I saw some headlines this morning that made me blink but I had to rush to work
I don't listen to the Democratic party but thank you for the personal note
Jailed unjustly is really questionable because he has definitely broken some national laws

Assange is a Problem and WikiLeaks in 2010s is less a beacon of journalism and more a political weapon
Assange can suck it, where were these people for manning or Snowden?
They do have to provide evidence to establish that they were rioting or looting before they would be allowed to use it
They might be able to get away with calling them alleged victims but that sounds like it would make your case weaker by saying it
This is one of those "ugh I guess it makes sense" things
Mistakes happen as a result
Union employees have conditions in their contracts, including higher pay, so the temptation exists to use non-union people.

However, since basically everyone skilled is in the union, this means hiring people without skills or experience.
It's fine, it's just I'm at work lol
Explaining what a union is is going to have to fall to someone else, that's a lot to go over
No, someone(s) had a grudge against using union personnel
you have to find ways to let things just, go at some point, to just accept that past a certain level you can't change it, and if you can't change it, the only thing fretting about it is going to do is hurt you and make you less capable of helping anyone
because it sounds like you're destroying your own mental health over this
I do think you need to learn defense mechanisms for world problems, or even personal problems, that you cannot fix
I don't think you're wrong about this
I mean, I agree people need to do more
You're not reasonably worried about health, you're unreasonably worried
You really need to talk to your therapist about being a hypochondriac
this is why people just accept how the world is now, I think
you can literally get killed and die from a car crash any day you drive to work and the odds aren't significantly different
This is not a venting space
If you get upset because people want to actually poke at the conversation you're bringing, bring it somewhere else
It can be against the rules and yet happen because mods don't stop it
Now you're making assumptions
It would make sense that you brought it up because you were in distress that someone would do this and there was nothing you could do about that space
Apparently the assumption was wrong and I apologize but I'm trying to have a conversation with the details given
Because you came in here to rant about it
But if this is a repeating element...
And if the moderation staff just don't see it or whatever that's life because they're human
And the only recourse is to accept that or leave
It's on the moderation staff to stop it, or else it is in fact a space where that is ok
I think that's more pertinent than whether there's a 16 year olds
The attitude of that space is determined either by the people who inhabit it or by the people who run it and sometimes you just gotta leave if it feels bad to you
"public space" online is not some neutral concept
I think there's some merit to Matt's position but I also think a more relevant thing is if this is their Twitter or whatever, that's their space and it's on you to decide to follow them (or people who retweet them) or not
DM me if you want I can't promise I can reply in a timely fashion right now
You brought up the problem as a problem in the general case and that was what I was discussing
I don't know your specifics and didn't think I was likely to
I can't speak for anyone else but I was talking about the problem in general
they only understand that they'll get zero cut of any profits derived from out-of-market transactions
valve has no such understanding
and assuming proper cares are taken
as long as they're not trophy hunters, hunting doesn't seem any less ethical to me than farming an animal
Sometimes you have to suffer consequences to learn
It's not even close to the end
I was there once for the same reason
She'll probably fail yeah
I usually use the chopstick wrapper to make a hashioki
Just, idk if concerts should be in that group
This isn't a loaded question, there are events in life that risk is just accepted as part of it
Is concert going an event like driving that we're supposed to just shrug and accept that people die
The other side of the coin is: it is ethical to have these events at all if you don't have a solution to the problem
But I do say this as someone who doesn't go to concerts and wouldn't care if they were cancelled due to risk
Honestly I would like to see shared liability for concert deaths for venues and performers
you can copy digital art and there isn't anything special about each copy, they are as interchangeable as anything else
Yeah it's important to remember that "NFT" does not apply to digital art itself
but that felt a bit on the nose
like paintings
The analogy would be even better with something that everything is one-of-a-kind
Fungible is pretty easy to explain - If I trade dollar bills with you, you won't care, they're the same even if they're different physical objects
if I trade pokemon cards with you, you might care a lot
you're talking about IP
You're not talking about ownership there
Only from an ethical perspective
And both are the 'original' as long as neither has been modified
Me owning a copy of data does not in any way affect your data
There's no actual correlation to physical ownership
I agree on NFTs, but if you're talking about digital ownership it's a lot messier
if you buy digital art, the only thing stopping me from using it and looking at it whenever I want - if I get to see it even once - is you filing a court order under a copyright or other claim
Definitions of ownership are a social construct and I'm not even sure I'd say 'its yours' if you buy digital art
you can't copy the token
They apply to the *tokens* that point at the art
It's hype
And the pixel art and lion face and whatever NFTs signify that it's not *quality* that drives NFTs
In other words, a market of suckers
They're aiming at the fact that financial techbros are investing hungrily in NFTs even when it's total speculation and repeatedly flopping
It is a digital card game in every sense of the term
Hearthstone has advanced to a point where a physical version is not possible without excluding several hundred cards
Just a pointer
And yes, the image wasn't on the blockchain at all
"there's no sensible reason to make it like that" is correct
This is how insane and badly baked the nft market was at the start of the year
It referenced a script on a specific address
The token was stored in the blockchain public record
Megan's conception came about because the first big nft repository created NFTs that pointed to a script file on a server that would reference the correct image, meaning it had a point of failure on a specific address

That's been rectified in some other implementations but it's still dumb
United - and air travel in general - has that, yes
You don't get a reputation for wrecking wheelchairs if it's only when lazy employees happen
I don't know if United does these things but I wouldn't doubt they are lacking in at least one category here
if company policy doesn't include training on how to properly handle the chair, or policy enforcing that they need to take the relevant steps - *with* proper time allowances to do that, and no pressure to cut corners - then it is the company's fault, not the employee's
even jobs that can't *fully* pay bills will make those "equilibriums" a lot more achievable
this assumes you *actually* can't get money or work though, which generally involves either disability or a personality conflict with the concept of "work"
long-term, friends do their best to support you and you strain your support network's resources until things start bending and breaking; at some point either an equilibrium is found (which generally comes with the mental health problems of being a 'freeloader') or you end up homeless or in a support program with reduced agency
Portal 2 gave you certain hats if you owned them in tf2
generally I think people use "that's your opinion" as shorthand for "I'd like to draw attention to the fact that many of the listed things are subjective, and I don't believe your criticisms hold on a general basis and refute them as such"
Any event with tens of thousands of people showing up repeatedly is going to have people die at it sometimes, if only from natural causes
You don't want the public overhear you talking about moving corpses
I'm assuming this is standard procedure for them
it doesn't matter if only a small fraction of people want it, if those small fraction of people are investors
I can't think of a time I've ever checked dislikes before watching a video unless I really was expecting to hate it
anyway public can function just fine on number of views and likes
was going to write a different note
didn't mean to tag
oops

percent
There is literally no use to a dislike bar other than to laugh at people with lots of dislikes
it incentivizes stuff like botting or other harassment campaigns
yeah
all the value it arguably has, you don't need the public to see it
yeah I think I agree
*public* dislike has no purpose other than to make a spectacle out of shaming
creators can see them
they're still feedback
that's not changing
but
there's a reason most modern social media exclude it
I don't think a publicly viewed dislike option has a purpose...?
just, the fursuit was on a robot
that's basically what they did with fnaf
I'm teasing a bit I think I can understand that
did you have a bad experience at disneyland once
not for the term about transitioning topics
it's segway for the vehicle
it's pronounced seg-way if you're more familiar with hearing it rather than seeing it
I don't think it's really worth a segue into why furries were picked on initially but it basically boils down to being fairly public about something very unusual and hard to understand
I think that's mostly died out
it's also the birthplace of let's plays
I appreciate that
do the chains in your project run off proof of work
Do what you think you should do, just do not organize a harassment campaign on this server please
honestly if it does become regulated I feel that's one step closer to the hellscape where every megacorporation pays you in a different currency and charges you fees to change that to a different one
Also I'm not entirely sure of the confidence to have in its long-term value at the moment because we're only just beginning to move into the part of its life where it's subject to actual regulation
right, we agree a currency needs short-term stability
for poor people, if the value sharply changes, it means they might starve short-term
I don't disagree with your observation but heavily disagree that it's more important
You pay your employee something that's worth 30% less the next day, you have a problem
That's actually less important
short-term store of value is a highly important function of a currency
I don't think cryptocurrencies will ever truly become a currency as long as they're treated like a volatile stock market
in my experience this... isn't how power grids work?
every time new units are going to debut I see speculation about what ways pokelabo is going to make them meta dominant so you have to buy them

they don't always award lawyer fees for winning

haha, texas.
Without commenting on how I personally feel about crypto or anything, I do think that using hibiki tachibana as a mascot is a bad long-term gameplan for your project
NFTs just got seized on for art because art galleries started marked by the IRS and people wanted a new opportunity for money laundering
I think we've been sufficiently over this point
change.org doesn't really accomplish anything on a scale larger than bringing a discontinued dipping sauce back to mcdonalds
Even if I fundamentally disagree on your assessment with cryptocurrencies, I can see you're at least coming at it from a better direction and with more of a focus in mind than your average coin investor techbro

If you cook dry food long enough in the microwave it does catch fire
Did you smell burned plastic
did the microwave catch on fire because this seems like an overreaction to burned food
"it's making the molecules jiggle" is the same thing as "it's adding heat"
We call it heat
If you put poptarts that say cook for 45 seconds and you cook for 45 minutes it will absolutely burn them to the point of fire
it's hardly the only risky investment method
Under the US I'm pretty sure that willingness to do a crime doesn't make you liable for the crime if it didn't work out, unless that crime *is* intent like conspiracy
also the screenshots would probably count as fraud
in the US I'm pretty sure you could still make a case based on verbal contracts and expectation of role but EU may not have lawsuits that permissable
can they sue or something

So? You can be an entrepreneur with a co-op as long as you're not one of those assholes who are like "well being a visionary is what gets the big bucks"
You do not *need* an investor to run a business
You can pay them out
but it doesn't need added capital to run
Sure
I don't know why this part needs explaining
what, that you don't need investors? you don't need investors.
there is no link or anything lmao

this page is a broken mess missing critical links cypher
they've had hundreds of years to make laws about that
It'd be a lot harder to have tax haven bank accounts if that was true cypher
No, I don't think so
No
Yes, it makes it very difficult to verify tax evasion
Crypto isn't that hard to do it, you just use multiple wallets
Something like that
idk I'm going to be honest I'd be pretty pissy if I smelled cigarettes whenever I needed to open a window
"most qualified" at that point more just means you're more privileged and have gotten more breaks, not that you're more skilled
The job market in question isn't very limited in terms of people in it
Not in the us
As I understand it new evidence doesn't overturn a not guilty
As I understand it you cannot appeal a not guilty verdict
Even if not everything matches that, there's still a lot in favor of the defendant
The US system was designed to have excess false pardons and minimal false convictions
You'd have to provide audio tapes of him agreeing to take cash for slanted judgement or something
But the bar on not guilty verdicts is colossally higher
It would be grounds for an appeal for a guilty verdict
Unless he did something illegal, no
In the us it's a constitutional right and there are almost no exceptions
New evidence is sufficient to overturn a double jeopardy defense in the uk
Ah I see
No, which is why prosecutors only proceed if they've got a case they think will work and won't get stronger

I know everyone thinks this is evil discord begging for your money back but
and what state you're in because concepts like degree of murder would apply
I think that depends a lot on the initial charge
I believe it does
I was a little unsure if it still applied if a previous verdict was guilty
No, I think my understanding of this is correct
Wait I just realized something
well
Yeah in the states double jeopardy would almost certainly apply?
Double jeopardy prohibits different prosecutions for the same offense. This rule can come into play when the government brings a charge against someone for an incident, then prosecutes that person again for the same incident, only with a different charge. In that kind of situation, if each charge doesn't require that the prosecution prove at least one additional fact that the other doesn't, then the charges constitute the same offense under double jeopardy law. Here's an example showing how that rule works:

A man was convicted of joyriding, the elements of which were taking or operating a vehicle without the owner's consent. Later, the government charged him with auto theft, which consisted of joyriding while intending to permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle. To prove joyriding, a prosecutor wouldn't have had to prove anything more than what's required to prove auto theft. (Joyriding was a "lesser included" offense of auto theft.) Joyriding and auto theft therefore represented the same offense, and the auto theft prosecution violated the double jeopardy principle. (Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161 (1977).)
That's not a simple question
but I feel a good lawyer would argue it's not a different crime
It's a different charge so it wouldn't be instantly thrown out
I feel in the states the defense could try to make a double jeopardy argument
interesting

Unfortunately you don't play the investment game unless you think you're a temporarily embarrassed millionaire who *will* end up on top
There's no law saying corporations can't be extra private
And they're not required to allow them
They've likely decided it's not worth the manpower checking for exceptions

Nepotism to the point of ethics abuse may be a different matter, I'm not well versed in that
Some cultures obsess over it more than others but it isn't, to my experience, divided along racial or class lines
I think it's pretty universal honestly
Generally it can only be accomplished by replacing the workforce
Companies are just terrified of raising wages because that's the most notoriously sticky market - it's almost impossible to make it go back down
Alzheimer's or other progressive brain disorders is also a case

Idk I remember plenty of netsplits on rizon iski
A large organization is typically going to be more capable of extended server performance than a small one
I don't actually consider that an asset in most cases

tf2 is a good study in why investing in in-game assets can turn around and bite you
(I've been following that NFT thefts account for a while)
but you actually have to go that far
because they don't want to go through the actual litigation
I believe they do actually respond to DMCAs
as tickets to be invited to the auction to buy an *actual* thing
the really clever part is that they arguably do have actual value
They really are the "name a star" for tech nerds

And then said "look how much it's selling for"
So most NFTs that are worth a ton are worth a ton because someone sold it to themselves
All resells wouldn't give you a cent
You'd probably be the one getting scammed because it usually costs a hundred dollars to mint an nft and you'd only make money off the first purchase
Therefore they are not people they are IP ownable by a holding company
Where the vtubers aren't people on stream but are characters played by actors - more like a public personality
I'm assuming hololive is basically going to set the standard for this
Since vtubers aren't real people it's very doable
there was a sports event where everyone was cheering "fuck joe biden" but the caster said everyone was saying "let's go brandon"
The conservative tab is selected there
technology does not exist for the sake of existing
it just enables you to resell the quality of "the artist said I own this"
It's still boiling down to "the artist said I own this," honestly, with the NFT itself not being an essential part of proving that
I think most artists at this point are aware that Patreon is not actually pay-for-access but pay-for-support
I don't think that's actually a rebuttal
and that's why online artists moved largely to patreon or commission-based profit structures
And as a result with time it became pretty well known that ownership of digital goods is a joke
There's nothing anyone can do to really prevent stuff from being added and it's lowkey becoming a problem with all the stolen art being minted into NFTs
this lets go brandon christmas call discourse is the most inane thing I've seen in fucking ages
Therefore, arguably, without taking into account special circumstances, I can't say you have a right to *any* revision
I don't think you have a right to every revision
they should have to host a selection of every patch they ever put out

I don't think so
because that kind of cuts to the heart of the remaster issue
Do you have a right to download older versions of the game so you can modify it?

there are absolutely proponents of removing all private cars from the road though
well I guess since you can't see gaudy wristwatches on twitter, ugly profile pictures are the opulance flex they've moved to
all of the profile picture nft projects are the absolute most banal implementation of the tech possible, designed purely as an investment scam
the best thing that can be said about it is it functions as a pseudo freemansonry where it acts as like a networking pass to get favors from people who are also suckers
I'm unsure it's entirely better for players to have a system of enforced zero sum scarcity, really, but at least some can profit off of it
This is a feature not in developer interests
Being able to prevent resell would probably more than offset the cost of having an additional database
NFTs are going to be shoved into the next two years of games until game developers realize that traditional dlc methods make way more money
I think there's an interesting field for cross-game items - valve played with this briefly around 2011 - but of course blockchains are an overly complex way to implement it and one that I think it would be intelligent for companies to avoid given that if NFTs do end up having any factor of legal ownership their games are now suddenly a legal minefield every time they do something that affects item worth
I've put some real thought into digital scarcity in games and there's generally not many people this idea enriches, other than those trying to get rich
Who has the authority to do this?
You can undo transactions in crypto? Without consent of the person transferred to?
I care less about then stealing a phone and more about them stealing my phone, and I can turn my phone into just "a phone", but I can agree that s an incomplete solution
I'm less fussed about the physical item I guess
I mean if my phone gets stolen I can nuke it through Google thanks to centralization
The ignorant will always be vulnerable to lies
But I feel you shifted the goalposts a tiny bit there, your objection isn't about communication protocol but about the fact that ownership is a lie maintained by force
Enforcement will always be right of might on some degree yes lank
If that certificate is a legal contract it can, I think is the idea
At the end of the day you are subject on some level to the two generals paradox
RSA has been doing no-trust verification for decades (unless you believe the stuff about nsa having a quantum computer that can crack it)
Not just with cryptocurrencies
It happens all the time
Lank not needing a third party is like the single greatest contribution of cryptography to the modern internet
90s economic destruction never really ended if you're in japan
If fossil fuels are on the grid it's very difficult to argue there's excess energy since fossil fuels are finite

Less corruption and more selfishness and lack of willingness to do what needed to be done - protect the rest of the world in order to protect themselves
Omicron is a variant that popped up because there was an entire unvaccinated continent for it to run wild and mutate in
Blocking vaccines to poor countries is what caused this current outbreak
It's more America and Europe's fault at this point
Why
Vaccines as a social blanket to protect the vulnerable has pretty much full on failed
Existing vaccines have a pretty lousy percentage at preventing omicron infection, that isn't necessarily a sign of lack of vaccination
is wealth ascending or descending

it reduces your chance of death by a factor of about 14
yes
sure, and even them it's not 100% fatal, just 100% going to be an ICU visit
sometimes it goes bad, but it's not like "you're in this demographic, you're definitely dead now"
covid isn't unsurviveable for anyone
yes
if your family is vaccinated you don't need to worry about them dying except for the old or otherwise ill
not that I'm honestly suggesting pursuing hyperloop
it's similar difficulties
it is worth mentioning tech from a functioning hyperloop would also help SpinLaunch
This is cheap sat deployment or material lift, not personnel launch
Hi-g is fine for this
space cannons ain't bad
launch loops have pretty big danger concerns for the operating country
launch loops are great but you shouldn't rule out less efficient methods
I'm interested in hyperloop because the tech has other applications (space launch), but it's certainly a very very expensive solution to a problem that's already been solved elsewhere
Covid tests are generally more often accurate than they're not accurate
Yes
I do not think there is a future for NFT art that isn't some form of investment game
art is such a terrible use for NFTs though, they might be useful for something that has inherent scarcity in application, but digital art does not
there would be ones that would be treated as 'more genuine'
Realistically, if it was still a market, it wouldn't - people would put in a market that offers NFT+s or something that has an extra authentication level because your average joe cares more about making the NFT worth something than they do about really pursuing decentralized commodity markets
Only if you think it has to stay decentralized
I can envision someone coming up with the idea of "NFT+"s or something stupid where the holder rights were sold to the NFT bearer at time of minting and that becomes the new 'norm' for stuff - but, really, right now it's way more about chasing an investment bubble rather than actually 'owning' anything, so that's probably not imminent
my point with that is more that a verbal or text contract could transfer rights ownership to the bearer of the nft - I think this was what some people were hoping would be the norm with the introduction of NFTs but it (thankfully) currently is the exception rather than the rule

the fact that the artist still has to consent is involatile, though depending on how things play out they could feel that the only way to sell it through NFTs at all is to do that, if the market gets toxic enough
that said there's nothing stoping them from suing, so
At this point I think you would have to demonstrate some sort of proof the original copyright holder (the artist) was involved in the minting of the NFT and that there was implicated a sense of ownership of it, and you'd *still* have a very uphill battle to establish that it gives you any rights at all regarding to the IP
they *do* report the statistics you're looking for, you just have to go looking for them

Like, to really hammer home how absurdly powerful the first amendment is here
and I'm more examining the US side here, with its draconian first amendment
in the US, that is
I think you only have to really fall in line with this kind of content if you're actually broadcasting over airwaves, which are regulated more than most content due to their highly finite nature - they are required to act as a public service in at least a small part
We do not restrict the ability to *refuse* to publish things to anyone I am aware of except where it conflicts with discrimination law
You can't exactly post state secrets on twitter - at least, the site will act on it. Same with designated 'harmful content'
And twitter's already been restricted in most of those ways
because they intentionally don't police that speech
That's like saying the government agrees with people who say you should overthrow the government
they're respecting the rights of a company to censor its content, as that's a form of protected speech?
they're not defacto agreeing with twitter?
At least I was
Actually I'm pretty sure we were only talking about if the us government *could*
It would not entitle the government to decree what speech can and can't be published
I don't think that's sufficient
That's halfway to nationalizing them
And the latter might not be possible
You'd either have to repeal the first amendment or you'd have to nationalize all social media
This is my favorite take on this, it shows an absolutely lacking understanding of law
I'm pretty sure that would still be outlawed and countries would label it a potential climate modification weapon
Any power transmission satellite worth making is one that would cause problems when misaligned
Dune shows us that even authorized canon means little if the new stuff sucks

You're right, if the media did say that, it would be fearmongering and irresponsible
I have seen zero incidents of that
even if only 0.5% die that's two 9/11 attacks
Even if only 10% feel bad enough that they need to check into a hospital that's a lot
The united states got a million cases in like 3 days
The media is blowing it up like crazy because *it is* killing people and it is continuing to threaten our hospital capacity
And quite frankly that line of argument leads to really toxic places
I don't think Pfizer is trying to 'keep the pandemic going'
I've always loved the observation that high explosive is almost always far safer than low explosive, it seems so counterintuitive to a layman

I don't think that's necessarily an argument against abolition
I don't think abolition is morally wrong tbh, just impossible to do given alcohol's ease of manufacturing
I see that brought up all the time and like, it's bad, but there's gotta be more right
as I said there's obvious flaws and you all really don't need to ping me with them
I'm just mentioning this because if you try to 'own them' with that line they'll drag you into an actual argument over this stuff

There's also the problem that it's a system that rewards hoarding and saving rather than commerce but it's the lesser evil compared to PoW
ah but that implies carbon credits were invented to solve a problem rather than to further profit
actually idk if that would be enforceable?
for this voice NFT thing I wonder if they're going to be too stupid to put in a terms of service
sadly 'inefficient' tends to be a byproduct of people chasing decentralization
a lot of them are paired with already established blockchains, just smaller ones you haven't heard of
which means the NFT is just a gimmick to sell a standard legal contract with extra steps in such an application
at the end of the day I don't think it's possible to enforce royalties through the token for deeds done with the ownership the token represents
I don't know if there's legal precedence
And what happens when the nft is resold? Would the buyer be bound by the second contract that says they need to pay royalties?
NFTs are definitely not a solution to IP dilemmas
It would have to be paired with a legal contract yes

I mean, when I already mentioned fuel
fuel as in the thing that is oxidized
it just tends to create more energy
but it's not a requirement
high explosives do tend to have the oxidizer and fuel on the same molecule

I don't understand how you can mix something to create different molecular structures
no, gunpowder is never going to be a high explosive, no matter how much you alter the ratios
sorry, deflagration
low explosives cause conflagration instead of detonation iirc
in fact I think it's the single thing that seperates the category of high and low explosive
high explosives do
well
explosives cause shockwaves for example
among other causes
iirc shockwaves require supersonic velocity
ye
~~it's not technically a *shockwave* but I think the colloquialism gets it across~~

this is the shockwave
explosions make shockwaves right?

they later claimed that the post was made by a non native english speaker who did not understand what age of consent means and thought it meant getting to agree to almost anything
It's fine to argue against it, just keep in mind your objections are more than just logical ones
You're quite right that it's bad for breeding, but the part of you that finds it *gross* rather than just a bad idea is cultural and not particularly more logical than, say, people bothered by homosexual or interracial couples
I am curious how that will turn out in years down the line
Yes
Iirc there are studies suggesting hormone levels in utero can affect homosexuality
Especially because the reason parents don't want it isn't because it's hard for the kid
It's complex but overall it seems more a Pandora box that shouldn't be messed with imo
The bigger concern would be stuff like autism would be aggressively filtered out
Like you'd be looking at a 5% more likely to do X kind of return on a massive intrusive endeavor
It's possible yes though not to any degree needed to make it worth it
It goes hand in hand with eugenics
Honestly I feel the most complex part of designer babies is the most basic, gene therapy in utero kind
No one wants their kid to grow up amoral and vicious
All parents want to control to some extent

but it's up to the manufacturer or courts to decide if it's a 'fault' right
what, like a moral right?
barring some post scarcity setting where all work is optional
I'm not sure there's a system that wouldn't require that
Interesting
Though they also go into the inherent failure of crypto as a solution for distributed control of the financial system
I think the 2 hour runtime says otherwise
If NFTs have to be centralized to maintain their value you should have just used a database for that application
it's aesthetic over purpose

Silk road 2 baybeee
they're arterial networks, like rail
idk if you noticed but highways don't connect into warehouses
like even if you have the most polished switching and distribution system ever invented, that's a considerable barrier to trade
that's a considerable additional cost to build a warehouse
I think it is not a good suggestion, personally
and you're suggesting cars not do that
right wynn
there are freight applications they solve that rail can't scale down to solve
then don't move people on them
maiming people isn't going to solve a problem whether you dislike highways or not
and, circling back
anyway the point is overall dumb because highways are not a bad idea in themselves
most of the noise is from the moving air
because it would be true in trains too
no?
I think it's pretty not okay to try to incur lasting health effects to push an environmental agenda
counterpoint is I'm fairly certain you can pretty easily hit a decibel level on freeways that will permanently damage hearing with long exposure
and if that was the main source of transit that sounds bad
the rail lines would be privatized
idk
it's a law that adding lanes makes traffic worse
texas regrets theirs
14 lane highways are universally a mistake
this isn't an argument for "don't switch to rail" or anything but like if we have to subsidize trucks for the system to work I think that is somewhat ok
I don't intrinsically have a problem with subsidizing transit and logistic networks with taxes, honestly
'blow out people's ears' and 'gradual hearing loss' are two different concepts btw - note that there's basically no regulation on headphone volume
if you want to affect an externality you have to actually legislate that, not provide soft incentives
hearing loss would just be accepted as a required externality to use cars which would still be considered vital to having a job etc
I do not think it would force us to be realistic at all
It is, in the same way ecoterrorism is an interesting concept
If you can somehow put laws in *banning comfort* you can put in laws banning X amount of car use
is shit.
I don't really give a shit about 'are highways good just use trains asshole' argument here because I just think "we should force people to be in danger and miserable because somehow we could do this instead of actually putting in meaningful legislature"
if you don't want to deal with replies, don't respond to replies
And warehouses that aren't large?
it's almost like stuff with highly expensive or land-dependant infrastructure needs like utilities and rail is a natural monopoly and shouldn't be private
they don't have competition and the government has inertia
why would they be doing well enough?
that's true, so the bidding war meant any winning company was massively likely to fail anyway
yeah that was basically the UK model
since companies would only run the profitable routes, meaning it's not a reliable service
this would have the outcome of forcing the population into cars
you just abandon all the rules about required runs etc
it's easy to make it more viable than the UK
failed state
see if I'm paying 10 dollars to the road, when the dude who runs the road decides to cut cost to make more money the consequences get much worse
because they were under so many (reasonable) restrictions so as to not disrupt needed service
I remember UK did that and all the lines went out of business lmao
I think you are trying to draw connections here that don't really fit
rather, less dangerous abuse
it leads to slightly less abuse
yeah
and that is a critical difference
but it's not the operator of the road
that is not what privatized means
falling apart private rail lines do sound worse than the current state
no because the premise of this is that highways also do not exist
I know some people here (myself included) are good friends with <@!263534352422404096> I've been contacted by their family - you may know they were hospitalized with pneumonia. Earlier today they stopped breathing and are currently on a ventilator in the ICU. If I hear more I'll let you know, but unfortunately that's all the information I have.
but part of why people might not want to 'share' their labels is because frequently people use 'transfemme' or something to refer to people who have lived experiences in transitioning from AMAB to a femme presentation or something similar and they don't want anyone 'mucking it up'
the short answer is because a sizeable portion of people don't consider stuff like AMAB demiboy (I'm not entirely familiar exactly what that entails but I can make some educated guesses that work well enough for this discussion) as valid or 'serious' - generally the same crowd that yells loudly that he/him lesbians or bisexual lesbians are 'doing it wrong'
Yeah what's the question
All utilities should be nationalized, even most capitalist analysis basically agrees on that point for natural monopolies
Also to add onto this it's pretty normal behavior to invest more when you lose money if you're convinced of long term stability

General public probably a little faster than that
I'd expect corporations will catch onto the fact that NFTs are an investment gamble that can cost more resources than they're worth within 3-5 years
bigger sucker schemes run out of gas at some point
at least, in their current collectible form
luckily NFTs are pretty stoppable
anybody can broadcast, you just need a big piece of metal you can shove a thousand watts into
I don't think you have to apologize for pneumonia
if it's not in a sharp period of change it's in relative equilibrium
yes that is how things work
it just wasn't doing a lot
everyone's lives sucked but what the money was doing was pretty stable
the great depression wasn't very chaotic from an economic standpoint
it does not mean 'prosperity'
Literally all 'balance' means is 'equilibrium'
that is a balance
Yes, it found a balance in the great depression
but it would be a balance
it would suck much more for you
I don't know what you mean, unrestricted capitalism would also find a balance
so I can guess
I don't but most of what you've posted in this channel is anti-china
shoving so much money into the region in order to exploit cheap labor
china's like this because everyone exploited them
Also if you really want to get into china
Break the balance and all you get is a new balance
This is a kind of dumb point because an equilibrium will form no matter what change is made
this one is in fact crazy because then it just means the corporation either moves out of the country or forms in another country and then just toshiba's the industry
> There's also this crazy idea where you enforce that your corporations just pay your minimum wage wherever they operate.
unless you're talking about trade tariffs
this is just a natural result of labor reform law and increasing global logistics networks though
> They create the situation where it's cheaper to exploit elsewhere than locally.
but again, I think the goal is to then *facilitate said exploitation* rather than 'maintain power'
now, I'd accept an argument that certain political actions are taken in order to keep other nations more vulnerable to capitalistic exploitation
It's a byproduct, not a goal - if it was more profitable to exploit local people instead of other nations, they would
Absolutely, but you seem to imply this is done for the sake of colonization rather than for the sake of making number go up
I think there's historical relevance to it but I disagree that the powers that be are using capitalism to control things rather than captalists driving colonialism at this point
I disagree with this take
india is the way it is because bigger numbers
that's generally the major objection I have to anarchist society plans - even if you manage to deal with infrastructure, probably the biggest role of the state is in managing externalities and renormalizing them in the form of restrictions, taxes, and fees
this is what we call 'externalities'
corporations are just slow
no, just the defense industry
grants are still a thing
not that being at state unis stops you from making up shit
investment means they can stop pretending to have done research and do actual research
almost certainly a hoax at this point
That's the one I meant

RTGs for everyone
It is sobering to think that the whole cellphone boom is in no way sustainable - lithium being maybe the biggest nightmare but all the rare metals in general being an issue
I'm not entirely sure how I was supposed to get that from a positively charged word like 'balance'
this just seems like a shit point
I mean your point was, I guess, that if lankpants has the capability and time to write on a discord channel that things aren't in upheaval
That's just relative
I'm assuming you don't mean absolute equilibrium because you claim we're in balance now, even though wealth is still being consolidated
This is perfectly fine in one of the meme channels
Kat it would be a little appreciated if you tried to seperate memes or dumb shitposts from things that are actual topics to discuss - You're not in trouble or nothing but I've noticed a number of things you've dropped lately are the "haha imagine that" variety

Why wouldn't they support something that says it belongs to whoever holds it
society is filled with people who don't use their actual pictures as representations now
I think it's less that they're mainstream and more people stopped caring

they can hold them and if they have a trust, the trust can trade their portfolio
Generally these mean that they can't trade themselves

I can't say I have a ton of sympathy with the "oh boy, I wonder what cool things will happen now" mindset
BTC sounds like a Korean boy band
US leverages a PR stance of being more free and open than Russia or China
It's also worth noting that a lot of the harm the US does inflict is because they're viewed as "not as bad"
most of the bad ones are for the goal of self-benefit with apathy towards harm inflicted as a result
very few policies are enacted with the goal of doing harm
but I'd agree with a statement that says they're doing the most harm in the world at the moment
it's not the ultimate evil, you can do much worse
You can skip the argument, it doesn't serve a point now
anyway the anti-trans push is probably a smokescreen to appeal to the voting base for the upcoming election in order to hide the power scandal
this is just the normal right
it's a pretty ironclad rational deterrent, though the problem is the word 'rational'
*especially* if she broke an NDA with an external company, which generally opens you up to a painful lawsuit, I can see cutting her loose
Reading it again I think the most likely thing is she broke NDA on something
either something crazy went down or something incredibly minor went down and they're looking to ditch baggage
Especially since most of china's plans to reclaim hk and Taiwan are long cons
When your literal neighbor you share borders with starts invading countries, it's not in your interest to go "yeah they should get to do that"
Because Russia's expansion goals may not be entirely west focused
I was wondering if they were going to pull the trigger on frozen assets
A Russia that thinks they can get away with stuff is not in their interets
China *might*

My points were be proud of your progress rather than be angry at what you missed
Strength of character is shown by making difficult choices and changes, not by coasting in righteousness
Imo it means more for someone to realize that they're headed in the wrong direction and turn around than for someone who is "always right"
Their economy is going to suck for a while and buying foreign luxuries, like, games, is going to be basically impossible
I feel super bad for Russian citizens
that said, wouldn't be surprised at all if finland sought membership
russia's pretty unhappy about the ukraine thing
I think there'd be a home security concern as well if the government started trying to make moves on finland
not just economical
it is pretty much a purely defensive agreement
basically a military supergovernment formed to counter USSR in the cold war
north atlantic treaty organization
iirc most of scandanavia is not currently joined?
I wouldn't be surprised if a few countries join nato after this
about a charity? You can share it here
it's fine as long as you accept it's a discussion channel rather than a venting channel, so if someone wants to discuss it, they're not crossing any lines
generally the people the tweet is aimed at would be able to provide zero of those
quite honestly that kind of thing is why I hope I never become famous
(which existed)
(it was used to carry the russian space shuttle)
military and space nerds cry and the rest of the world shrugs
But kat it's also kinda weird to drop  posts without credibility you already believe is false so you can post a debunk
Blockio you are coming on a bit strong
Well I guess that's basically q anon
I don't really know many people who pass around discord chat screen logs and say it's totally believable war analysis, personally
I think what he's trying to say is  he's uncomfortable by the permanent record of pre-transition?
that is something powers just wouldn't agree to, it's too much of a vulnerability to not try
I can't imagine they would have forbidden knocking out communication lol
I like that russia abandoned the peacekeeping narrative
right
oh, I'm so sorry
I thought you were still in work readiness training
And a lot of studios don't pay for frames that get rejected
Most rank and file animators couldn't possibly make a living wage through work unless they do something absurd like a frame a minute
Insufficient wages have been a hot conversation for a while in the anime industry though
Depends on the field
The airspace thing is somewhat *hilarious*, actually, given that Russia has used flyover access as a political tool and weapon more than any other country maybe ever
Basically every form of sanction so far is either performative like removal from actual FIFA or is going to mostly just prevent luxuries to the average consumer in the short term - the airspace restriction is going to be the first one that goes considerably beyond that, but in the case of your question, I'd say it makes it easier to protest when you're stuck inside the country
Like it'd be maybe cute if they disabled the Russia team from the franchise/campaign mode
But removing fucking code from a game already released is just dumb
You don't want major *internal* security concerns when you're in the middle of a war
The more internally unpopular a war is, the more difficult it is to execute and the more the ruling party gives up by doing it, whether it's a democracy or not
There's definitely a use in pressuring the populace if it's deemed worth the cost
Wow that's dumb
Russia made the mistake of invading white people I guess
The news coverage has been unreal
Boiling down to "it's shocking to see *civilized* and *normal* people displaced and becoming refugees"
jesus
this will be the straw that forces russia to act ethically
yes
well it does answer the question of if japan is so good why haven't they made japan 2

You say that like factchecking is something the average consumer can do
"oh no I'll just have to annex the whole country instead of waiting another 10 for the next bit" - putin
Russia hires the evergiven so they can control world shipping better
That's just the nature of international aid
Basically every country is doing it for their perceived gain tbh
and even that's unlikely
russia would have to declare war on the rest of the world for them to last more than a few years
sanctions will be a temporary thing
not giving a cease fire
you know what else would give you that
Yeah, but if you were doing that, your main goal would be civilian casualties
But why break it early then
is russia *trying* to get people to hate them
has anyone figured out the angle on proposing a humanitarian ceasefire and then breaking it
There was definitely an implication of "it's your bad taste that makes these things popular" in the critiques
Impairment of a luxury is different from impairing medicine or critical industry, for example
I do think there's very little that *only* harms the commonfolk, and I think it's also worth considering nature of harm
you jump to the evil conclusions first
I don't think that they're equal, no, and I've noticed that you tend to come into discussions assuming me or someone else here is 'the bad guy' Vyn
er, the extreme at the other end
No, I think it's the other end of the extreme
Also you're bearing a bit of a righteousness torch atm
What people am I considering
can you rephrase your question because the thread gets lost
nuance as always is in the middle somewhere
It's equally easy to just blanketly say that harming is bad and neither nations are our people so why get involved
I'm aware
I'm pretty sure I've already seen a news story about a russian unit not making it to the lines because of apparent self-sabotage
The more unpopular a war, the more often factories break, or sugar *somehow* ends up in gas tanks
Fighting a war when you're in an internal security nightmare is definitely very bad
The things that *are* actually hitting the populace are going to strain the country in arguably important ways
the fact that their families are being sent to war is probably on their mind more than the fact their cat can't participate in a competition this year, located somewhere *they can't fly to anyway*
including hurt
most of the virtue signaling shit doesn't do *anything*
no but you were talking about things that hurt people
all of these are stupid but they also don't matter worth dick
no but you were talking about the measures that hurt random commoners
the bank sanctions etc are designed to hurt *them*
...you mean the people in charge of these corporations and institutions 'that putin doesn't care about'
there is a point where coups happen
putin isn't omnipotent
but most of these sanctions are not that limit
there is obviously a limit
Vyn I consider it right to take some more drastic measures than otherwise might be okay to stop a war yes
not ultimately
there are no corporations and institutions that don't mean shit to putin
squeezing the population does effect change
It definitely does spur them on to apply internal pressure, actually
they didn't support russia, they abstained from implementing sanctions themselves
it's not even fucking up
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>

Some countries are seizing I think? But largely the West has picked options that will minimize problems when things are "back to normal"
I was thinking that earlier, they probably had a new priority
but it's frequently the only levers short of military action that can be pulled
I don't think it's necessarily the only way to resolve things
Companies will slowly take actions *against their own interests* if stockholders deem it short-term desireable, for example
People wield power but generally, on some level, that power comes from the consensus and inertia of the people beneath them
some priorities are needed
There is a finite span of one person's focus and attention and a finite bandwidth you can 'broadcast' to people in and out of your life
That's why I think the shit about cats or other virtue signalling bunk is stupid but I also don't care enough to get mad about it - stuff like diverting vaccines is more worth attention
It is a genuine mark of improved character
And quite frankly you should take pride in getting it reversed because I wouldn't have thought it possible
You were a *pretty* open and shut case for permanent banning at the time
I'm not sure what miscommunication you mean, I'm not sure I can envision a pipeline that has you rejoin here faster
So it's enforceable, probably, but I don't know if it would hold up to a challenge
I think the law is to prosecute people who continue to live in Idaho but get treatment over the border
I'd love to know the constitutionality of the extra state thing
Cheronbyl is now off the grid but there's probably weeks or more before it's a problem
I think it's possible to want and advocate for something you think is unlikely to happen
Of course they probably want it
That always comes across as a "well it's not going to change so why are you saying it's wrong" argument
It's a moderately alarming article but it's obviously also meant to be written that way
There certainly are valid reasons to discount polls and I just wasnt convinced I got a comprehensive look at amnesty's case by skimming the article
I'm not sure I'd use an unreliable source to determine if someone else is reliable
Did you by chance check what article you are reading
Do what American Jews say have actual weight to Israel, actually? Like, does Israel have open citizenship to foreign Jews?
I hope you're prepared to defend your viewpoint because nothing about this is cut and dry
Even astronomers generally use sidereal time
The concept of solar noon is relevant to an incredibly slim slice of americans
Definitely a harder sell, that one
While switching to metric will make a lot of people grumpy for a few decades
And the disruption to life doesn't exist
But definitely cheaper
Not free
Yeah, it's just this is a hell of a lot cheaper
It causes lots of friction without gain
It causes programming errors
Switching the clocks causes mistakes every year that costs money
But there's no real benefit to it now - and it's debatable if there ever was - and it's definitely economically damaging to have it vs not having it
The major obstacle is that it is relatively asinine - that is, a small change that affects a very slim crossection of life
There's nothing shameful or bad about being mistaken if you're wise enough to understand when you are - that's the hard part
To turn this on it's head, "what kind of asinine shit do we do twice a year?"
It's something I've wanted for years I just didn't think it was going to happen
Definitely not necessary to switch clocks and this is a good bill
Hm

a very "let's indulge ourselves with caring about something so quaint" feel
the whole meghan thing was reported with a distinct air of whimsy
like a wrinkled white j lo
no more and no less than your average pop culture celebrity of no real importance for the most part
Especially since land is a limited resource and building more houses 4 miles away sometimes isn't good enough
Stuff like rent control is nice on paper but doesn't solve scarcity of residency in desireable or useful locations, it's a thorny problem
It's not changing by more than an hour or two, not out of concern for kids but in order to placate parents
Again though it's all academic (hahaha get it) because daycare
Kids can't set policy and it takes like 4 years and then they can't remember better times anymore so just trounce their little hopes and dreams
The reason schools will not be shifted wildly later to line up with best studying times is school has become day care for 9 to 5ers
In winter? Yeah.
Which was basically the only benefit I could think of to the old system
To avoid walking to school in freezing dark
I was actually thinking that it'd be good for schools to shift hours
I like the ones that go vrrrrrr
unknown at this time
I don't think we're necessarily headed for a nuclear war but I'd be surprised if putin doesn't start leaning on the arsenal to tell the world to stop bullying him
basically the things that made countries agree to stop making thousands of nukes every year
later replaced with START
iirc the acronym was strategic arms limitation talks/treaty
idk at this point I think it's more realistic that there's no more SALT for russia
I also think the single best advice I can give someone with a newly cracked egg -if that is what this is - is start saving money. Your goal is to get enough liquid funds in savings that you can take a one way trip with critical possessions on short notice, just in case.
Same with confiding in any friends who you arent 100% sure won't let anything slip to more critical social circles like family or work
So don't make them until you're ready, if that happens
I'll be frank and say that any decision to reveal this kind of thing to someone who has the power to severely alter the quality of your life is an unreversable decision and it is possible to make mistakes
As much as I wish I could advise you to lean on your loved ones
Put on emotional music, do your best to sob yourself out, and try to come back to it with a post-sleep head
So if you think a 'sex change' is *super* relevant - as far as I'm aware, most trans women don't get surgery. Trans men get top surgery more frequently, but it's still not decisive.

I'm far from a counselor or anything and you haven't exactly given a lot to go on but I'll say that the decision to transition or publicly acknowledge anything is a seperate decision from resolving who you think you are.

The button test isnt even close to definitive, but if you'd answer the question of "if you could hit a button and relive your life as before except as a girl, would you?" with "I'd slam it so hard it would break" you might need to really dig into if you're really cis or not
there is a, I suppose, non-zero chance that her parents lied about her passing but I think it's not worth putting any hope in
her birds did more for her than her parents, imo
and yes, her family was not exactly an ally to her wellbeing
their family notified a friend through text and basically said 'never contact us again'
or the screencap bot
I hope they'll be taken care of
she loved those birds
Don't blame yourself for that
it's not an issue of "try hard enough and this person will fall for you"
and remember that many people just aren't looking for romance or aren't looking for it from you and that's not a commentary on you
it's really weird, ideally you have to learn to signal that you're willing to give focused love and affection without being even slightly overbearing about it
Just gotta find the right person I guess
It's happened before, yes
<:KirikaSadQuiet:676150820592418856>
yeah. they're one of my best friends. I'll let you know if I hear anything.
She's been down for a month due to costs yes
I do not feel comfortable talking about her situation
yes
I have significant reason to believe it is
I'm deleting the message in announcements
this is not a problem with a clear solution, though
most of the weird deals and representation failures comes from similar things
Most of the corruption in elected positions comes from trying to get elected for the following term
executive orders definitely have a decent check though, we saw that play out with trump
the check on judicial review is something that takes decades to go into action
some of the checks are pretty slow
yes
having a cringe phase that one hates to think about is kind of par for the course, most people go through something of the nature
yeah raids are not how we do things here
Even if that were true, how would you ever become a better friend without observing, listening, and talking when you think it's right

Sometimes the fact we don't have others gets us to stick around longer than we should
I've had a stretch of time where I had no one - if you hang on and explore spaces and don't lash out, opportunities will happen
it ain't a character flaw to be lonely but it also isn't the end of the world
Hey batman if you want to give this a go tomorrow in a less confrontational and self-destructive mood go for it, but I don't think you're currently in a shape to do much other than feel bad, so I'm going to time you out until you sober up
We wouldn't know, you started venting randomly instead of discussing anything with substance
at this point honestly you wait for them to either take advice or for me to time them out
<@!276723234295250964> that isn't called for here
Friend, if you're attempting to make a good first impression here I highly suggest you log off and sleep it off
your thoughts are still appreciated I would just like to stick to the thing
I would *really* prefer if this didn't translate into a "hooray mel" conversation, I really did want to more discuss just the general toxicity of anime fandom
we haven't done a perfect job by any means but thank you for the thought
it takes a lot of dedicated work on a foundational level to make sure anime servers don't end up toxic
kentucky chicken
I'd imagine that it has to do with the fact that an appreciable proportion of YGO players are black
otherwise people are just mad at you and that ain't the fucking same
you're not cancelled until opportunities start closing
I wish jk rowling was cancelled
like maybe not the nitty gritty but knowing about tory vs labour vs etc is probably relative to you
as someone who lives in ireland you should probably try to follow british politics tbh
it is fundamentally the same thing, but apparently anand has added definitions that I don't
Boycotting is convincing other people to not engage with a service or person
like that's the thing that *makes* it cancelling is if people start being mean to others
The only thing I'm getting out of this is you've made cancelling into a boogeyman where it's only cancelling if they do something that you decide has gone too far
It really isn't different
You obviously shouldn't threaten people into abandoning someone
I also think strikes are good, mind you, in the right circumstances
To perform a strike you have to convince others to participate
I think strikes cause a lot of damage and resentment and I think there is a social parallel here
I don't think that's necessarily bad
Okay, cancelling is "hey this person's kinda fucked up, I'm disengaging and you should too"
that's what 'cancelling' is
fantastic beasts 3 yeah
She has a movie coming out in like 4 weeks
When someone's exposure to society is harmful I don't think it's necessarily toxic to wish they stop getting chances
You realize the newest addition to the hogwarts universe is the jewish stand-in goblins abducting all the wizard babies right
I disagree that it is a "culture" though
So yes by definition cancelling is bad?
So the definition of cancelling is when it turns bad
What's the difference between that and a grassroots political movement
A fair trial is an important part of state punishment, but social life falls apart if you take it as a necessity for every social interaction
she's equally eager to make fun of feminists - to the point of parodying them with someone who *is fighting slavery* - as she is having her evil fascist racist villain defeated
she's more anti-change than she is pro-anything, the mighty hero of her setting, the chosen one, is the one who just returns things to the ways things were and decides he wants to be a cop when he grows up

first reason in decades to watch the oscars
that's incredible
Life expectancy has also gone up by about 7 years in that time
A tripling of GDP is difficult to not affect most everyone in a positive way to the point where claiming the economy hasn't improved requires more than lip service saying things aren't better
(it's basically tripled since 98)
To say the economy hasn't improved is going to need some proof to contradict that
It's not the end all be all of economic health but it also means something
GDP per Capita increased tremendously the last two decades, peaking in 2019
russia's performance has made it pretty clear that if they tried a conventional warfare invasion of a nato country they'd lose horribly
also, if it makes you feel better
if world war three happens it's not going to be based on claiming US has russians in it
the US isn't even slightly on the agenda
the law's purpose is to make it feasible to get his own government to agree to committing resources to certain invasions
it doesn't really matter
he isn't magically going to mind control anyone who knows how to speak russian, it's just step one in a process to allow him to claim justification to invade certain countries on the basis of protecting 'russian nationals'
lol
oh I love the little amoguses
antman strikes again
But like, guys? This wasn't kicked off by one
Yeah I was initially thinking just prompts
Even set for 24h that's a lot
Threads get archived long enough after the last post I'm not super concerned about that corrin
Threads are mostly hidden until you join them
Threads you're participating in show up on the main channel list to the left
I think a "good" solution is threads on everything but on a personal level that's a lot of micro channels to click on...
I'm very against two hours, people tend to want to contribute at certain times of the day more than others and there's already a bit of a traffic jam
It's a little rough because this has driven home the point that just giving prompts threads may not be enough - if the community is sensitive about topics shifting on every contribution (and I'm not saying wrongfully sensitive) then the argument would be every contribution deserves a thread?
Previously I was pretty convinced we didn't
As Matt said they do introduce moderation challenges
Staff have been mulling over how to best implement threads but staff have had a rather painful last two months so please forgive our tardiness on a final statement on that issue
I'm currently at work so I can't really address every line said here but I'm a little disappointed by the hostility reached here today
I think a little bit of tomfoolery on today is understandable but I think it's also understandable that people think it is a little too on the nose to joke about cajoling artists on the matter, but I think those stances have all been aired and will be taken forward in a well meaning direction by the actors involved
Are my services needed or are we reaching an accord
<:ChrisPeek:706913632386285588>
Threads can last forever I am pretty sure
I'll be a little spotty in this conversation because I have to get back to work but I will read everything, ping me respectfully if things get a little too warm
But that has a lot of ramifications so it's a real "hmm" thing
Matt that was kind of the plan
Ahiijny's point is interesting and I'm curious if they want to expand on that because it would remove all the black bars for one lol
I'd like to not turn this into laudations considering I keenly feel when we're lacking
The problem isn't old stuff, it's old stuff clashing with new stuff
As a moderator I don't particularly have a problem with necroing old stuff to give praise or constructive feedback
Covid does seem to be going the way of the flu, where the newer, more virulent versions are less lethal

it's star wars
I don't think that actually decouples the research from reality though
oh, I see what you're saying
there's also mention of another older study that had improper debriefing so some of the participants ended up with enduring trauma, yikes
I mean the same article talks about how it's very much not ethical testing but there is a study that ended up with similar results after making adjustments to pass modern ethics checks
> In a book review critical of Gina Perry's findings, Nestar Russell and John Picard take issue with Perry for not mentioning that "there have been well over a score, not just several, replications or slight variations on Milgram‚Äôs basic experimental procedure, and these have been performed in many different countries, several different settings and using different types of victims. And most, although certainly not all of these experiments have tended to lend weight to Milgram's original findings."[26]
I find it's a little disingenuous to not mention the next paragraph in the wikipedia article
That's probably a lot of why they're so willing to accept that it's a lie
But these imply the villains are brothers and family
It's one thing to accuse the war of being unjust - that's the elite's fault
I'd imagine the sanctions have probably partially had an effect of forced solidarity
Interesting
It's extremely optimistic they'll just turn around and leave without keeping any territory; most analysts never really considered that as a possibility
the argument is talking about the 1% there isn't, so I see what lankpants means
the irony of this is that the natural endpoint of this argument is to not label babies a gender, and nobody would be happier to get rid of the term "sex assigned at birth" for lack of applicability than the trans population
But again, he's not being very predictable
I think even Putin is going to take a long think before nukes are on the table, especially since this is a war to occupy
So the future isn't necessarily rational either
There's definitely a wildcard here in that some of this invasion has not followed rational analysis
they might do it *because* of a diagnosis but the doctor will still assign a sex otherwise
X is available on some birth certificates now but only at the request of the parent, never at a diagnosis
the funniest part though is that the argument is just wrong and they get assigned a sex anyway
I'm still thinking through it though
Oh rip
I have less problems with the times I wasn't doing enough and a lot more problems with the times I was doing the wrong thing
the proof of stake transfer, while it slightly affects the validity of some of crypto's original goals (minor problem) would *mostly* solve the environmental argument against it
but it's okay it'll be solved One Day‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
speaking of crypto, etherium's proof of stake transition got delayed considerably again lol
When you start thinking about it try to get outside your head, so to speak, and shrug it off and ask yourself not what you did but what you're going to do tomorrow
I think you've written something in here about it almost every day for a week or two and that might be a fixation
Have you ever thought about how much you think about it?
which is why I've been saying for quite a few months now that people trying to make a difference need to address why stuff like NFTs etc are fundamentally bad for society, not use "this jpg costs 16 jiggawatts" as their centerpiece argument, since that actually *is* solvable and doesn't apply universally to crypto as a technology
it would still be not the most efficient thing ever but it would at least be in a similar ballpark to existing economic services
but like fusion power is always 20 years away, the switchover seems to be always 6 months away
Hey that's kinda cool
this doesn't even put them in the top 5 shareholders
they own 3% of shares in the company
as far as I can tell the disney estate does not have any real influence on the company
it's publically traded
they don't own the company
zero influence?
also I'm pretty sure the Disney estate has like
Yeah, that's how I feel
you're really reaching for things to dunk them on and it's making me and friends of mine feel like a card to play to justify anger
I'm not saying Disney is actually fighting for it
that would be hypocrisy when compared with their pride showings
Hypocrisy is where Disney asks Pixar to remove gay content
Fighting for trans rights does not magically mean you have to be super liberal and nice in every policy ever
that isn't hypocrasy
just
I'm not saying Disney isn't hypocritcial
The two aren't directly related
no

but it's a really interesting insight into the way a corporatist thinks about social media, and how anyone who runs social media is going to think after the process warps them

if anything the 'problem' is that censorship has been shoehorned into a rhetorically charged word
banning child pornography is censorship
censorship has always been the elimination of problematic content, political or otherwise
I don't think it's inflationary
in real life censorship is frequently reflected by the fact you'll get your ass beat if you say it
censorship is both legally required and necessary for the operation of society, if censorship means 'preventing people from performing certain actions of speech'
I mean that's correct
I unironically think that's a borderline necessity for running these platforms for a long period of time even if I think it's foolishness

people want things to be different but believe (sometimes rightly so) that they're too weak to cause it to happen themselves
Stuff related to this is why a lot of trans people go stealth, it's just... easier than fighting those fights every hour of every day
but that doesn't make it easy or something done casually
Ethically they're obliged to, imo
but there is a price for everything, and in this case, you are asking them to pay their price for your benefit and it's difficult
it's not exactly an excuse for their actions
Originally coined to represent how disabled people can't do all the things every day normal people can, like hygiene, work, etc - the idea is that a person has a limited capacity to Do Difficult Things per day and going too far above your daily spoon allotment starts draining mental health, building stress, and can even send you into a breakdown
There's definitely a harsh reality that setting of bombs in your social relationships can sometimes ruin you. Ethically, that's a war worth fighting, but... Well, you can use a modified spoon theory on it
Power over what, seeing things?
if they don't have their own sats, there's private companies like Planet who do
Google maps can get new imagery
I'd say conditions are now mostly 'normal', I predict you will be dealing with COVID around for the rest of your life
the US doing terrible things does not mean all or even most terrible things would not have happened without the US
Generally it comes down to "do we want to be good people or do we want to not lose" in the minds of people who make these calls
And please lay off the personal jabs
I've always been of the opinion that there is no such thing as a just war
Commercial sats exist with 10 so I wouldn't discard it out of hand even if I've heard the same thing about maximum resolution as iski
It's generally accepted us spy sats have 5cm resolution but there's no hard evidence
Honestly this seems more dystopian
> The satellite will be able to point to particular areas of interest and is capable of seeing objects just 25cm (10 inches) across. However, DigitalGlobe can only sell these highest-resolution images to customers in the US government.

Estonia has both a significant reason to help and also a lower GDP

Yes
It is a crime to get some types even if you pay out of pocket
America is not only private healthcare but states are making it illegal to get treatments
It's not something you can escalate nor is it something you can just address with sanctions
I would not want to be the person who has to decide how to respond to Russia using a tactical nuclear device
Man I am glad I am not a world leader right now
Removing tenure and firing teachers for mentioning ideology not state approved, forbidding medical care targeted at saving hated minorities
Recent policies in Florida are absolutely more fascist than anything else
Florida is on its way to some crazy self destruct and it sucks
But that depends a lot on leaders as people rather than as forces
There may be direct armed conflict, *maybe*, but I don't think anyone would do a retaliatory strike
And I'm not sure, and I even doubt, that there would be nuclear retaliation from the west if he used a small yield nuke on ukraine
Both us intelligence and media interviews with people in the Kremlin have come to the conclusion that it's not impossible Putin could use a tactical nuke on Ukraine if things go badly for him
f1 also dumps a lot of money into material science
there is a weak logical argument to be had that stuff like formula 1 advances automotive technology
~~I'm actually personally against making exceptions for environmental policy just because X is a traditional Thing~~
and while ukraine's done a great job, it's more russia's fault they failed than ukraine's success story
the surprising outcome isn't that they invaded, but that ukraine didn't get steamrolled
8% really is 16% here because you also have to take away 8% of votes
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> I hope you're not a math major
that said I did say it was a weak logical argument because there is the question of would the innovation and investment and technological progress really be significantly different if they did have efficiency restrictions and mandated fuel mixes comparable to street legal cars
they didn't invent it but I'm fairly certain they refined production techniques
It was just a pretty huge lie
I mean the reason was that they were hiding WMDs
I can't make fun of it too much as an american because we invaded Iraq based on "I made it the fuck up"

They also wrote the words "signature illegible" instead of signing the fake note in this other thing from last month
https://twitter.com/holodmedia/status/1518603676067282944?t=7HxiDr1BRXXkzvbAz3kMWQ&s=19
2008 was basically people making money by betting on the bets of whether loans would default or not
It's built on a house of cards and that's how we get stuff like 2008
The finance world is really good at making money appear from a vacuum and loans are one tool for that
Because otherwise he... still has a few dozen billion dollars liquid to repay the debts with
Well by the point he declares bankruptcy he's gone through the deal already
Entities on this scale will frequently get loans even if they're valued high enough to "afford" it
Right
Billionaires do not have billions in liquid assets
I don't think that's remarkable
The stockholders are getting bought out, the future performance of the company does not benefit or harm them
So what incentive do they have to decline based on this
I *think* he has to have the money in hand to make the deal and bankruptcy would screw over *his* loans, not the bought stocks
That's above my pay grade
If he declares bankruptcy maybe they don't get paid
Oh I see
I find that unlikely
He'll probably sell

No
But if someone says on your platform "that's so dumb, I'm going to shoot you" and then two months later they do it that's gonna be an out of court settlement
Extreme positions and inflammatory arguments just boost engagement
Most platforms don't censor because they want to
I don't think he meant captcha
Authenticating all humans sounds like the point I'll leave
The key point here is that, at least by your wording, you put entertainment before you attempted to even start on this catchup
I can't say people tend to be very sympathetic when you admit you didn't have enough energy because your work was not high on your priority list and you ran out of energy
That is unfortunate that they misunderstood you in that regard, though I have to say even if they hadn't made that mistake I'm not sure they would have been exactly understanding
I looked into it and I don't think anything will come from that
I wouldn't say necessarily it's wrong to be honest about that kind of stuff, just that their response might be predictable - and if they scold you, perhaps it would be a little deserved
I don't know exactly how it's worded and it's probably best if you don't share too many details but stuff like "Professor, after playing fortnite for a few hours I discovered I didn't have enough time or coffee to complete my assignment, may I have another day?" generally goes over poorly
As long as you get the work done, a lot of people will allow you to work on your own schedule, but if you end up not having the time or energy, well, people generally hold you to blame for using time or energy on things that aren't your work
I don't know the circumstances but that generally upsets people in the adult world
Lucas has been on record that there's good and evil hardcoded into the star wars universe and all depictions of greyness are against his wishes - one should not read into real world applications too closely
Star wars is not a vehicle of nuance lol
you're overthinking things a bit
they're already down like 20%
I agree with you that the price of helping is definitely worth it but like, yeah, it's not an illogical position
but the two points the opponents are perhaps considering is 1) pissing russia off sucks and 2) Ukraine of today is not Ukraine of tomorrow
These are true statements
I don't know why you think that means it isn't a downside
I'm pretty sure ukraine isn't required to return any aid being delivered
there are downsides of giving weapons to your neighbors regardless of who wins, yeah
I don't think there is a moral reaction to a conquering power
This doesn't mean "you shouldn't help"
calls to war should never be celebrated, no matter if the cause is just
the team wasn't banned, it was DQed - still really harsh but at the end of the day it's one tournament
valve might be sending a message that they expect pure to be out of a career and untouchable by other teams
I'd actually not heard about the Z at all until today
I think something you really need to work on is these speeches about how you're so awful for getting caught up in it - particularly if there's a conversation already going on. No one's going to really be annoyed at you for being wrong, but centering the conversation on your error just derails any original conversation.

Every time it happens, you go on a bend about it, which I feel is the opposite of learning how to deal with it
I don't think there's legislature yet but there's a lot of resentment towards conservationism

people were not celebrating his win, they were celebrating trump's defeat
tbf most left leaning people I know had zero faith in biden
his nominal enemies hate him for what he 'stands for', and everyone else is unhappy he hasn't done anything

I think we already passed the point where we're going to see maximum support
yeah dupont is a classic example - 3M is handling it better
you can't invest in the long term at the cost of a few years, or your stocks will drop and you'll have no money to invest with
modern stock market mechanics have driven long-term investment and success from the field yeah
It's what divides SpaceX from most corporations, but the need to make a profit at all is what divides SpaceX from NASA
oh sure I was more remarking on rady's comment about the investment of resources here, with no conflict driving it
it's about as Pure Research as you can get
by anyone, and through any discoveries
JWST is a quite interesting example because there's very little, if any, theoretical profit to be made from this venture
I am exaggerating but still
Your average consumer will pass out on the spot if they're asked to check if their drivers are up to date and Linux users spend about 30% of their time installing drivers
I don't think steam deck will ever be mainstream
Unless the courts get packed quickly I expect the next few years are going to get worse on this front
There is just zero way a law would have survived roe v Wade being overturned
I am seeing lots of retweeted posts on Twitter asking why dems didn't codify though so you're in good company
Otherwise you are limited to rules made in 1790
The major systemic flaw with the ideal form of the us government is that you only get more rights as needed if basically there are no major dissenters
Rather you could make a law on it, but any SCOTUS that would overturn roe would certainly also toss the law
So you'd need an amendment
Pretty sure due to the 10th amendment you can't make a federal law on it
I don't think they have?
Understandable
I don't know what you're expecting from an account that literally tracks the SCOTUS 24/7
Like it's fine to not care if you're focused on the social implications of the decision, which is reasonable, but it's definitely a Big Deal for the courts
The legal world mostly
It's basically a law of political science that the party in the white house will lose seats in Congress during midterms
Progress relying on the SC is *very* slow
Maybe in another 50 years
There frankly isn't much hope, no
This isn't an official opinion, *yet*
The hope is that this isn't the final result
They were the timely ones
It wasn't that this was timely, it was that the other laws were anticipating this
You can pass whatever illegal law you want, it takes time to bring the case to the point where a judge can revoke the law
Most of them would have been destroyed in court within a few years without this happening
Anti-abortion laws have been passed waiting for this moment
Other way around
Justices do not always have the same reasoning behind a decision
Some of them are probably hardline rule of law types
Some of them yes
The constitution was written to support the idea of 13 seperate countries working independently but pooling resources
If it's not outlined explicitly in the constitution, the constitution gives the right to pass laws on it to the states and not the federal government
They are
While I've felt for a long time that it's a protection we need I agree that the constitution does not really have wording that should grant it
Globalization is not necessarily a benefit to every region - I agree in principle but not everyone pays the same fair cost for it
One step closer to truly sealing the great firewall
and, in honesty, it probably is
They probably knew there'd be a major efficiency hit and thought the longterm upside would be worth it for them
They mostly consider themselves Chinese, even
Chinese OS are likely to have a state backdoor anyway
It's not like you type in sentences for anything other than the most flowery languages written mostly to flex
Like a pinyin one?
So xi may be thinking taking a decade or two to become more self-sufficient and *then* go annexing
Also Russia has shown that if you link into globalization and then do a Gamer Move that you get wrecked, China may be aware of that
Content you can only access with one of select NFTs
We'll likely never see the fictional world where you can take a sword nft from one game and use it in 20 others but I could see square enix making nft dlc, more or less
I really do admire how the entire crypto sphere is get rich quicker people undermining get rich quick people undermining anarcho capitalist idealists
it's also possible square enix may be looking at the P2E scene but I don't know if they're that foolhardy
I guess maybe if they could get one of those contracts where every time an NFT is *resold* they get a cut
There are definitely approaches that I think would be more successful but I think companies will find that the more successful approaches limit profit
as much as I dislike NFTs, them failing before does not mean they won't try again and it also does not mean they won't succeed
the consequence of taking a cheap hack to the constitution and calling it progress rather than actually putting in change
the ruling would make it just as illegal for the us government to ban abortion as it would for mandating legal access
married or not
if you live in one of these states and have a womb I feel like it's becoming too risky to agree to have sex with anyone, contraceptive or not
bible also says to perform an abortion and make a woman barren if they're unfaithful
China is also a power yes
You can be a power without being a country
Where you can follow futher
They do link to sources
The wiki article does call the US the sole superpower multiple times though
> Today, scholars debate which countries to include in the list of superpowers, with the leading candidates being the United States, China, the European Union, India, and Russia.[6]
I have no idea what the requirements are but does China not qualify?
So they have enough reason to drill which is basically the entirety of what modern navies have for experience in coordinated naval warfare
Regarding russia
They have naval concerns regarding the eastern coast
It is pretty straight up nutty
Man it's not even talking about labor market needs
they've explicitly said that's why
Manchin is outright a subscriber to several republican viewpoints tbh
though part of the reason it's that high is it's also supposed to cover wear on your vehicle
which I think last time I had to do that was like 7 dollars for 5 miles, so considerably above gas prices for my vehicle
though if you're required to go anywhere after clocking in they do have to pay for mileage, at least here in california
I *think* there's still a distance policy on the non-standard thing
when I go to work my time starts when I get there, but if they send me to a store 30 miles away instead, I can get paid for mileage and *I think* for time
there is no compensation, you're only compensated for where you have to go that's non-standard. If you take a job it is assumed that you agree to it because you can afford the commute, both financially and time-wise
so russia's just refusing to report casualties? I assume the implication isn't that there's a massive amount of deserters

Kind of the inevitable result of a two party system
(just, studies generally show immigration is good for economies)
Adding or removing people from an economy will affect you if you're living in it
As overblown as their fears are, it's not like them coming over happens in a vacuum
The party is definitely hostile to brown skinned immigrants but there's a little more nuance on whether they have feelings about those already here
I think would be the best term
Your stereotypical white republican is generally unsympathetic to them
Though honestly Hispanic Americans generally lean red, especially the men
That Dems push for immigration policies in order to get more votes
the best way to get away with it is just rely on them being too dumb to understand what they're buying
there's definitely 'legal' ways to scam people with crypto but you can definitely still be caught for fraud
but text messages can suffice
yeah

you don't need paperwork, just the exchange
I'm pretty sure if you're buying or selling a service or good in exchange for a benefit it qualifies as a legally recognizable contract
~~like selling NFTs~~
fraud is still a possible crime but many types of 'scams' would be fine
yeah
I don't think it's actually illegal to manipulate crypto markets since they're not really a regulated asset at all
it's basically the crypto/nft version of someone starting a indiegogo and running with the money
I don't think you can really do rugpulls with an active currency
so it could just be spooky bedtime stories they're telling each other
it's possible but it's also noteable that corporate forces are the boogeyman of the cryptonerd, who believes in individual power
No, the rumor is that blackrock and a few other firms shifted assets around to cause things to crash and then bought some of their assets back at a profit
they're a little tinfoil hat but still plausible
with some somewhat believable stories that it was an engineered failure by a few investors
luna had a huge huge crash a few days ago
they're doing this in revenge rather than because it's a good idea
I'm unsure I've seen Disney actively push against trans related stuff
well, disney protesting the don't say gay stuff
If it is difficult to remove judges you sit where we are now - house can impeach the justices right now, if they want
If it is easy to remove judges you have accomplished nothing because then it's just partisan again
If the judicial branch has a viewpoint, it will only pick justices with that viewpoint
I think that if we do accept judicial review as part of the court's purview, which I don't inherently have a problem with, enabling the judicial branch to become its own master is not a path that works out better than today and sometimes works out worse
That's mostly by design
Namely, that their decisions can't affect their numbers
But it has some obvious drawbacks
They are the only ones who don't have to worry about how their decisions affect their numbers
It's a double edged sword
You could make the same argument that the legislature shouldn't be allowed to refuse presidential appointees in the executive branch
That is not a better situation, that is just a different problem
Unless you're saying they should be independent of all branches which has its own flaws
President picks, Senate approves
It takes both
?
Roe v Wade, Planned Parenthood v Casey
In the context of the constitution?
I agree that in the modern world they would have to basically commit premeditated murder on camera to be impeached and even then I wouldn't join a betting pool on it
To ignore your own precedent would be heinous
Half of our legal system is based on the idea of following precedent
And looking bad is honestly more important to the judicial branch than either of the others
There's also basically no way for them to not look bad if they don't shoot it down, based on the draft of this opinion which *explicitly* says the right should be held by the states
I think 7/9 justices are pretty much who they say they are
I think the majority of the court is doing that yes
The supreme court is less Republican and more Conservative and hardline Constitutionalist
(I think a law guaranteeing abortion would fail just as much)
The current supreme court thinks that it's not something the federal government has authority over the states on
I predict an abortion ban would fail for the same reason roe v Wade is being overturned
hooray for monopolies
turns out when the publishers get directly involved in the business, netflix can't compete

and the biggest sucker is left with the bag
the thing about bigger sucker scams is that at some point there stops being a bigger sucker
honestly looking at the timing it might have been kicked off by that article about how NFT market's way down
oh nice the ugly monkey jpgs are in freefall
As you say, it's a permanent reminder of how awful things were

We should arrest all redditors
There are a lot of redditor terrorists
Which is *amazingly* fucking contradictory to this whole 'parents rights' bullshit that sprang up for the don't say gay bill
several states are legislating that providing people under 18 with gender affirming medical care is child abuse and illegal
though of course negative consequences tend to be passed down
generally none of this directly affects the little guy
in practice bear markets involve a lot of people being nervous, panicking, or just being conservative with funds
bulls are good for sellers/holders, bears are good (in theory) for buyers/new investers
a bear market is a falling market
it's just a term for a rising market
no, it's stock market
reactions are disabled in this channel in part to prevent people from doing that
it's such a fucking horrible post
really, it was absolute kindling for the kind of abstractly vicious meming of 2006-7 era 4chan
it's also a terrible post in the "I'm 14 and trying to sound deep" way
the memorial post that set the memes off continually made the 'an hero' grammatical error
kid who allegedly killed himself after someone stole his ipod and someone made a myspace page memorial about him
mitchell henderson
was 4chan slang, I really doubt the newer users know it
become an hero is 4chan slang for committing suicide dating back to 07
holy shit I'm tired and my eyes saw "to become an hero" and I got very alarmed for reasons that are 15 years out of date
maybe wiser to not then
but sometimes, like right now, it might get you to poke deeper
don't base every decision you make on it
it seems to be a harassment campaign towards the fxtwitter's trans developer
yeah ok
I have no context for this but my chrome transphobe tracker plugin has this poster's name show up in red which is generally not a great sign
the deer must do what the deer must do, and apparently that means consuming plant genitals
lol oof
Generally I think the "if it's not offensive to the population in question it's fine" approach makes sense
yeah
but it's a little inconvenient to type ‰∏≠ÂõΩ as an english speaker when you want to talk about china
And I can see a train of logic that says they *should* be represented by the country's intent itself
some of those sounds, and one of those letters, don't exist in english
there's also the question of other alphabets and syllabic systems, which is how we get to stuff like Turkey from T√ºrkiye
I think you have a few too many rules about what's reasonable respect and what isn't, here
I thought the point was about respect
(we do slip into United States when we're trying to seem big, imperialistic, and strong though)
that's not parity
Americans call USA "America" typically, but mexico calls it Estados Unidos
Like, if I wanted to go back to the USA example
I kind of understand where you're going but please do understand that you're saying "It's wrong that we're not going this far. Oh no, that's too far, we don't need to do that."
you gave Turkiye as an example though...?
Estados Unidos is not the name of the USA
your entire point is that we should respect the name that they have, not transliterate it into whatever's convinient to us
the proper name is United States
no phoebe
france is technically the French Republic
both work
the States, America
the UK is, for example, "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"
I think you're understimating how terrible most official names are
likewise I don't think people in england particularly care that japan calls them igirisu
so it's not insulting to me if someone calls it Estados Unidos
I certainly didn't pick America's name
I'm unsure, I feel it's not very critical, it's not like respecting personal autonomy

it's a leading cause of death and we've collectively shrugged and said 'cost of doing business'
anyway if keeping people safe was more important than economy the western world wouldn't sell cars
it's still interesting but not really what they're claiming it to be
those compliancy demands have been waived
it's for a specific model of car that's incredibly old and had trouble being compliant before the shortages
the headline sucks, as predicted
I looked into it
so the alternative is to halt all car production
they probably imported airbags
it's not that

In response to 2020 (and some concerns before that) a bunch of similar chip manufactories started going up
It is, but only for about 2 more years
And of course there's also the fishing rights
Taiwan is also one of the most advanced manufacturing centers of the world, so economically getting to secure it would be a big benefit.
They certainly are, but loudly proclaiming Taiwan exists and we'll fight for it hasn't been done in a while
Interesting, but also poking a wasp nest

the video does bring up the interesting point of the ecological cost of that much concrete, which is interesting to pontificate at least
even if wind just makes it slower as you take longer to be precise, that does a lot to rule it out
The problem with gravity storage is that it has to be somewhat on demand
I can think of some cases where concrete would be better than water but I have to agree that I don't think you can't rule out wind, so they'd have to be protected, which would greatly raise construction cost
"why not just make our trains better" is a pretty good counterpoint
but this is a hyperloop situation
it's good that people are looking at stuff like this
you don't have to worry about water breaking over time and no longer being pumpable
also has a much higher upkeep cost
someone's thoughts on the flaws
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGGOjD_OtAM
but I'm not really on board with Energy Vault yet
gravity storage is a real thing and has been used for decades - there are battery reservoirs
: (
they do at least have turbines which helps
they can be varied but it's generally better to not
so you have to build nuclear for your smallest power reqs, rather than your biggest
it just doesn't really do adjustments
actually I'm crossing off nuclear from the grid stability list though it is good at baseline
almost 100% of baseline power is gas and coal though
oh I guess hydro is pretty good too but that's generally been a part of our grid for a century
especially since basically every form of green power generation other than geothermal or nuclear fucking sucks in terms of grid power stability
But the major point of these is grid stability
higher efficiency is nice, of course
and somewhere we can take power from
It's less important that energy storage hold 100% of what we put into them and more important that we have somewhere to dump power
Bad Things happen if the grid has just a little too much or too little power in it, even over a second
it's being sure you can smoothly flatten the power
It's not just that

No it's a salient point when people are freaking out about the growth of lgbt
Did he bring up left handedness
Absolutely not lol
Sometimes it is
It's a crapshoot with him whether it's educated content or not
Oh no bill maher
I just think it's a grim business
I do believe justice, such as it is, was served here
And if they don't have the evidence their life will not only be ruined - that's already a given - but they'll be directly penalized
I hope future abuse victims aren't silenced using this
It's really the most grim outcome in a way
>>> The use of "the Ukraine" is officially deprecated by the Ukrainian government and many English language media publications.[1][2][3]
The proper name for the country is Ukraine from a quick Google search on the matter
So similar to how the us refers to The Border
Ukraine basically translates to frontier
I believe it's a holdover from how Russia used to call it
what an asshat
"oh no why is ken penders trending on twitter this ti- *oh no*"
I don't know the incident you're refering to in specific but 'ranting liberal boomer' is basically his identity
"you gotta do *something* joe"
this smells strongly of a compromise made with campaign managers
China is probably aiming for financial independence even if it results in bumpy short term performance
Yeah, that's not what this channel is for
If someone's not like you and not like your family and not like "most people" there must be something wrong with them
That... Was not my point
The word sinister is literally directly descended from the Latin word for "left"
Very old association though
5 people just got shot during a funeral in Wisconsin
There's been like 5 news worthy mass shootings in the last 7 days jesus
Perfection is the enemy of greatness
If you make the self discovery that most mistakes are ok, you'll be in a much healthier space
there's a report this morning that he's looking to downside by 10% and this is probably an 'excuse' to let people go
so idk how strong that infighting message is
most news reports mention a large amount of tory turncoats on the vote though
I think it's a problem they're not using that list, because there's enough of it
yes
and they're somewhat correct; the thing that says america has like 400 mass shootings a year is not particularly sanitized data and is of questionable usefulness outside of emotional appeal
they'll imply it's because of people in detroit or something and say the statistic is useless
it's why you see republicans deflect the statistic frequently
honestly two firing at each other would be enough as long as 4 people get tagged
and does qualify
There's usually a few mass shootings a week yeah - the definition is loose enough that 4 gang members with guns firing at each other would qualify
It's also probably why Finn didn't get to date Poe, which a big part of the fandom and both actors were on board with
NFTs didn't die, the market crashed
SEA and the Arabic middle east are both profitable areas with a voice on this
Mind you it's not just china
What do you mean? If you can sell the idea that men who accomplish big things even by some rough methods are 'great men,' does that not perfectly set up the population to adore a current dictator?
wow did the police actually stop a major terrorist attack
The 30th ton added means exponentially more damage than the second ton added
Yeah but the effect weight has is nonlinear so even if most cars were a ton or two heavier it'd still be pretty negligible compared to semis and garbage trucks and heavy equipment
though that's an EV problem in general
they're also less safe to everyone else on the road since they're so heavy
That's generally what "California" plates have in Mexican restaurants around here (southern California)
Tbh I'd assume California street tacos were street tacos with guac cream and fries in them

Yeah a primary reason to do this is to shake political support to enable rivals to undercut or at least threaten to make a move so the political party in power is pressured into moving towards negotiations
Probably true
So Department of Defense is very active in movie making
The DoD is very liberal about loaning out equipment and advisors for basically nothing or actually free but they require oversight authority and the ability to veto content on exchange
Basically every single movie with heavy weaponry or vehicles in it made in America is propaganda
I think it's a mix of that and egotism. If it was truly just no self confidence you'd expect to be wrong. You're upset because you think the mistake means you are less "perfect" than you thought you were.
yet you can
I don't think there is a point where there's enough restrictions where people who would do such a thing can't buy a gun
The argument is "I value my ability to shoot someone in defense more than I value schoolchildren not having to dodge bullets from legal buyers"
but that's you saying "I don't think it's worth trying to solve this" not "it can't be solved"
The US has such a toxic gun problem it would take us decades or a century to get to that point
robberies are frequently done with knives or other things
In countries with guns outlawed it's a lot more difficult to get an illegal gun than you'd think
you're a sheltered idiot who's never been in a fight
if you claim there's no point because they'll just use something else
If you want to claim people should have the right to a gun to fight for freedom or repress tyranny, I disagree but acknowledge your logic
unless you *have a fucking gun*
Just because you have the intent to kill and a means to kill does not mean you have *a practical and effective* means to kill
there is *no other* way all of them end up dead in such a fucking awful piece of shit move
My friend could have fought off anything physical, and even if he couldn't, the rest of the family would have been able to get away
there is no other weapon you could give that father that would end up with that family dead
the rest of my life, I now believe the idea that "if you take the gun away they'll just use another weapon" is *complete fucking trash bullshit*
my second year of highschool I got called and informed he'd been killed, along with the rest of his family, by his father, who then turned the gun on himself.
he was a solid dude, a good dude, and also a big dude for a kid, one of those early growers
but someone I was in the same small afterschool club with and spent a decent amount of time with
not like a best friend
I had a friend in middle school
alright let me get to my computer to share a story
All cops are billionaires
DC executives losing their minds
just don't be an ass man
Yeah, no, none of that really excuses you claiming what I said was irrelevant since your claim is just as irrelevant
don't pull this crap in an argument where you appeal to sentiment first
bullshit it's irrelevant, you brought the argument it's humane up in the first place
I would actually consider it "more bestial"
I don't actually consider this idea that being food or not is some sort of game or competitive activity vs your prey as "more humane," especially when they're going to suffer more
so I think the force multiplier deserves some of the blame for the atrocities
the force multipliers have
the amount of violent people in the world, the amount who want to use force, has not gone up
I think blaming the objects isn't wrong
iirc recently chicken became the most consumed protein in the world
special consideration for housing and counseling may be valuable
a lot of it is pretty nebulous but there's good chance a lot of the directives here will actually produce something of value even if it's not going to be earth shattering
this is pretty big
> bans federal funded programs from advocating conversion therapy,
but all of the things I'm reading here are fairly solid even if a lot of them are "set up a group to find solutions to X"
there's a lot of tiptoing he has to do because he can't strike down state laws
It addresses discrimination in foster care, bans federal funded programs from advocating conversion therapy, is ordering the department of health to look at ways to provide care to LGBT people even in states where it's not permitted, orders new training for juvenile justice systems, orders department of urban development to look for ways to get money to housing LGBT are some of the more concrete things here
I'm skimming it, there's a lot

wizards is probably just figuring it's best to Not
yeah I'm not entirely sure on the legal half here but I'm pretty sure you aren't either and if there's a grey zone, there's expensive litigation to be had
it's market manipulation
yeah
number 3, you don't have to win in order to sue
number 2, just because wizards didn't make a contract doesn't make wizards not responsible for financial damages they cause
number one, verbal contracts are a thing and if it can be established wizards gets something out of the reserved list, it's easy to establish it as a contract
there's a few things
I don't see a way they can do it without getting sued

Have casual sex or have non-sexual romances, generally
If you said you're primarily attracted to enbies it'd still set off my chaser radar something fierce
that sounds like a fetish rather than an orientation
Yeah, but generally the idea is "maybe some of the injured kids were from missed cop shots"
There's a borderline conspiracy theory going around positing that we've been told so many conflicting things to hide something worse
That car boot is so lmao
personally I think sanctions are having an effect on russia's military machine, but the effect on the populace is either a wash in terms of desired effect (unless your desire is for them to suffer) or possibly even counter productive
I'm mostly taking issue here with the emote and 4chan-like engagement, not you saying "it's having an effect I like and making me happy" just to be clear
it's being a snot

How the fuck is saying 'cope' having a discussion

you're definitely a boomer here, poor access to phones is part of why people have trouble climbing out of poverty in the states
it's also worth mentioning that "don't you guys have phones" at this point is like, expecting someone to laugh at "because the chicken wanted to go to the other side" though
GoRider's ted cruz video was pretty off topic in the first place
it'd also have the Ukraine "you wouldn't expect this scene to happen to white people" news coverage but magnified by 5

Rie Kugimiya and Rie Tanaka are way less common sights now than in the 00s
Also there's an issue of popularity and I've noticed female seiyuu wane in popularity faster
I actually think it has more to do with giving up careers when they have kids?
I don't mean to imply I don't find that interesting, because I do, but that wasn't the only meaning behind 'giving up on it' there
Just buy it at a price that you'd be happy to get one year out of it
Yes
Excellent
If people are actually giving up on it we may be at the actual bubble burst

idk
her drama was in early 2011, this is all 2011 and onward credits
this is what her roles were like before 2010
hirano's anime credits are actually really eye opening
idk about hours but certainly dozens of minutes
like the handshake event, it's expected that the guest will be personable and talk with you for a few sentences
conventions where you line up to get signatures are basically the same shit
the west has their versions of this
mind you
this is why idols do shit like handshaking events
the otaku view of idols is that they're expected to be better than human females, because they belong to everyone, not a boyfriend
it's never been confirmed by her and the three people she was implicitly screwing were all fired from the band
no that happened, though people were already mad at her before that because she talked about sex
by the time you're popular enough to get enough main roles to really lean on it as a career you're popular enough to start doing CDs, fan events, etc
'almost every' is maybe hyperbolic but it's incredibly common for boys 15 and under to be voiced by women

(I do agree with FPTP criticisms, they're just a seperate but related issue here)
which is otherwise the best comparison
they're not, but it's more individual than, say, UK MPs
any positions that are bigger than that are already all pooled together and districts don't matter
it's 1 person 1 vote because you can't just pool all the votes for the positions because the positions *represent the districts*
People in different districts are *in different elections*, they are voting for different people
fenny it's because the districts are non-fungible (lol)
<:sadeline:628615321212682270>
minimally impactful when there's only two parties
and also
that's a different issue rady
yes
make a district with 90% blue votes so the surrounding districts have 55% red votes
it's just, gerrymandering is used to 'waste' opposition votes
but it's still 1 person 1 vote even when gerrymandered
gerrymandering still sucks, mind you, and can affect congress and especially the state level
I'm not aware of any state that elects any analogous position by means other than popular vote
but those votes don't have a higher weight
You'll see voting districts *mentioned* during elections because each district counts votes seperately so you'll see stuff like "Creek Lake: 90% reported" because they finished counting faster
the districts don't matter
but even then
you're thinking of the electoral college which is a problem but it used only on voting for the president
it doesn't affect 'state vote' whatever that is
gerrymandering happens mostly to representative elections because the idea is each district elects someone to represent their interests
fenny what are you talking about
as they're somewhat one and the same
I haven't read the opinion yet but it's likely this also tosses out the right to privacy
it's happened
https://twitter.com/ReutersLegal/status/1540340341685030918
amber hasn't been replaced
I kinda see what you're getting at though
Counties are not made with equal population size in mind
you can't just make gerrymandering illegal, it already is
Computers are capable of doing it fairly, but I struggle to see turning over that process to a independent third party in a world where voting machine companies are blamed for your candidate losing
gerrymandering is overall very bad, I'm just unsure how it would be fixed without moving to a district-less system which would never happen because it'd involve rural areas 'giving up their rights'
I mean it's not an unwelcome consequence to them, but I think both parties are too arrogant to think they need to keep the little ones down
I'd argue that's a consequence and not a goal
in the US it's mostly a way to ensure cities don't have power
An actual call to violence is not exactly far from people's minds right now and is the thing being warned against talking about
I think you're misunderstanding the warning
What more do they need for the context of this conversation
They have enough tracking for the cops to subpoena
I have no idea what point you're making
To track down cp and stuff yeah
joe manchin can eat my ass
The entirety of America is held up by this idea that the courts have final say whether laws are valid and also the ideal is that the federal level is powerless
Once in a while there's a decision made due to precedent set in like 1240 ad or something fucking stupid
Well, English
And quite frankly it's inspired by the UK common law system which is worse
It is though
About that, I did ask for a commitment from you, and you backslid pretty heavily on that today. For your own sake, I hope this is the last time this is brought up on the server.
it prevents them from having to really build a party platform
democrats prefer to run on "don't vote for them" over "vote for me"
I think they're comfortably rallying around a point that will get them brownie points but not actually pass or will get struck down, giving them lots of future ways to 'strike at' republicans
braver than the troops
"how can we make amber alerts about *me*" - the police
traditionally, no. This year, it might be
god I hope the supreme court doesn't take up one of these cases
which that last thing is basically going to be impossible
If the supreme court says "that law doesn't work," there is no way to make that law work other than for the supreme court to change their mind or for you to like, amend the constitution
Judicial review is the most overarching power in government
for the simple reason that people at any level of power have zero way to 'deal' with them on anything other than a personal level
I don't think that's the reasoning here
They generally release all their decisions for a period at once, but they're usually not this uh, spicy
and it's a more powerful move than the democrats have pretty much ever done in the last, idk, fucking 20 years
It's a *huge* grey zone in terms of 'politically legal'
one justice died during obama's term and the senate did something I'm not actually sure is constitutional and delayed the pick for like 5-6 months so the new president, whoever that may be, could choose instead
*he shouldn't have gotten the opportunity to do one of them at all*
And really, the crux of the matter is
So he's responsible for 'picking' them, but that means he listened to people who said he should pick them
well, okay, Mitch is arguably not *not* responsible, but it's a bit of a leap to assign primary responsibility
Trump is not honestly all that responsible for the court other than being an electable republican
Mitch isn't responsible for J6
I don't think I ever heard of him before but honestly anyone who leaves people this moved when they pass did something good with their life, so hats off
wow that's a heavy video
they'd rather another candidate
I mean they'd prefer it over biden maybe but
most republicans don't want trump back in office for various reasons
yeah it's amazing that musk was able to just hot-drop his testing systems into live traffic
Banning human genetic engineering is less about idiots making calls and more about being smart enough to know that no one's smart enough to draw an intelligent line
this is sufficiently 'extremely high risk'
trains are much more dense a transit system than cars with an average occupancy of only slightly higher than 1
that's... false
especially if heavy loads aren't symmetrical
it is worth saying trains are significantly less efficient than normal on grades
large plains are like the best use-case for rails
self-driving technology has applications beyond letting drivers take a nap, even in a car-less city
but there's no world with designer children where class issues don't get worse
in a hypothetical world where LGBTQ characteristics or autism characteristics were 'filtered,' you could at least claim a victimless crime had been committed
I'm going to be real, "curing" gay people is probably less of a societal hazard than designer children
that's not a lighter note at all
I think some might disagree because they view their struggle as part of who they are
ouya
er, the original producer
at best the original holder of the NFT would pay them to insert the skin
I think we have to assume that or the math falls apart immediately
and at what point does that cost outstrip the small trickle of money they get from their cut of each resale - which, mind you, means they're only making money if people are *reselling* the skin rather than *using* the skin
who's paying for the development effort
the major problem with this idea of a skin you can use across more than a small family of games is
I don't think it's an inherently different scale; I would expect, realistically speaking, there'd be a dozen or a hundred 'best' things with slight randomizing characteristics
the TF2 golden wrenches come to mind
there's not zero precedent for this
god yeah the cosmetic skin proposals are swallowable but some people somehow believe that people would actually want to play the game where one person could own the best sword
just, the entire gaming landscape
web 3.0 fans unironically want the world of gaming to be like diablo 3 before they removed the auction house
and also to keep track of your currencies so you can pay for the next 30 minutes of fun
yes
the "web 3.0" console has a wallet button on the controller....
so precedent would be low or non-existent
I don't think any other position depends on this - though it's possible some clearance levels in the US do
the rules say "natural born citizen"
I don't think there's enough precedent to declare that
Tony Blair would have had a fair shot on the Republican ballot
Trump was recorded saying women are great because you just grab them by the pussy and they'll fuck you
Even putting scandals aside, realistically speaking someone who has renounced citizenship in the past should be easy to murder at the polls but in 2016 meme man was elected so

there's been a number of people saying they've been visited to ask about their tweets or whatever
yes
I just don't think the ammo is a particularly noteable barrier here considering the gun itself
sure, but plenty of preppers and enthusiasts already make their own ammo
I think it was black powder which isn't that hard
and totally outside any reasonable measure of gun control
it's an interesting case
curious to see what direction this assassination might put gun discourse
is that a good reason
evergreen video for mocking libertarians
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZITP93pqtdQ
the epitome of libertarianism
also "the government shouldn't be able to tell me to be safe" is like
my favorite version of that bar chart is some right-wing one where they had a ratio of gun homicides to the number of guns in a country, putting US at the bottom
it just becomes a question of "how kooky can we go"
also kind of hard to screen out nationalism from people who want to bleed and make others bleed for their country
other than perhaps ireland level "you can't buy fertilizer without an expensive permit and extensive background check"
yeah I can't see any regulations that would have prevented this
that's why they didn't use a manufactured firearm
yes
I'd love to see someone try to make a case that the second amendment gives them the legal right to assassinate
isn't the purpose of the second amendment to put fear into your politicians with the implied threat of lethal resistant force
an interesting side point though
idk if the police are just going to give you an hour you can reload as much as you want
considering you can buy everything needed at a pretty normal stores that's not bad
it killed its target, so I'd say it was made well enough
'not good' is certainly up for debate
I've done a black powder reload in about 30 seconds, I'm sure 20 is doable if you're practiced
I'll unplug you from the grid so you can have an answer
for the between-lanes bit
yeah I want to clarify that it is legal, but it's on the cyclist's duty to make sure it's safe, so if something unsafe happens...
it's legal "as long as you do it safely," so if there's any accident or collision you're automatically liable if you were doing it
there's a similar policy about motorbiking between lanes
like if someone gets hurt and you were there you're probably liable because you weren't there legally
I think technically cycling on the sidewalk is against the rules here but it's something that's only going to come up if you cause harm in doing so
but of course, there's near-zero checks and restrictions on abuse
yeah it's just mostly meant to highlight that in theory a single holder of power does enable the most efficient and effective changes
It also avoids diluting needed actions through compromise which is frequently the consequence of a representative council - and if you have a group of people that can recognize their represented group needs to take the L for the sake of the whole population, you have people good enough to be a dictator
a perfectly benevolent dictator would be perfectly benevolent and takes the best action, period, and acts quicker in times of need than a perfectly representative council - In this magic land where people can come up with the best solutions, speed is going to be more important than representation

this is a pretty old polisci thought experiment
So this is alleged rather than fact
I think this is what's in musk's sec filing about why he's dropping the deal
Oh I see
The best form of government is a perfectly benevolent dictator, but are you really going to count on their kid keeping everything good
probably why the version he ended up using was only two barrelled
(black powder might take a little prep work though)
Most of our higher appeal courts have multiple judges in the US
Judges just cannot have the life experience needed to make the correct humane call on all cases, especially since they're trained to make legal calls, not humane ones
Both the defendant and the state get a good solid chance to weed out people with "unfair" biases in their history or beliefs; you generally do not get a call on what judge you get
They will know the laws involved by the time they deliberate
Juries are always educated on the relevant legal points in a case
When you're throwing someone into prison for life on circumstantial evidence, sometimes common sense is more important than legal doctrine
No we're in the 1940s
Or if they're being applied justly
It's a flaw if laws are always just
Juries not having to follow the rule of law is literally one of the reasons they're a good idea cypher
Judges are very important in ensuring fair trials but demanding they also determine guilt and sentence is a tremendously bad single point of failure
There's a reason that accusing someone of trying to be judge jury and executioner is calling them out as an autocrat
Sure but how do you get from there to "being tried by your peers instead of a law school grad who has personal biases is bad"
Wat
the gun control division of the government. kind of.
This is probably not the way to fix that
Where they basically assault the officer

There's still a reason to look to move away from unity; they're showing a lot of signs of caring more about inserting games-as-a-service technologies into the engine over stability or refinement of the proper engine. To compare, they shut down the internal group of employees in the studio who were making a game with the intention of getting to have a direct pipeline back to the engine developers about the engine's capabilities and flaws in the design process
it does feel a little clickbaity

The focus is "we need to move out of suburbs"
The focus isn't "we need to move back to rail"
This is definitely a bit of a strawman

honestly, this whole article is kind of an interesting look at moderate republicans the last 30 years
of a note, most people interviewed left this movement already or are even outright said to be now democrat
which is an interesting point
looking at this another way, the article is basically republicans saying the modern GOP hates homosexuality more than they did 20, 30 years ago
so it doesn't seem to be an unreasonable position at that time
GOP was not the anti-gay party - both parties were
The movement being discussed started in 89

space debris falling into atmosphere and burning up in large amounts (which is what it does 99.99% of the time rather than hitting the ground) is bad for the environment, for one thing
saying "people could die from this" is different from saying "You're going to die from this" and you have problems differentiating the two zmand
not really, there are other reasons to think china's being irresponsible here
not a single recorded person in the history of history has ever been killed by space debris
you're not going to get hit.
meteorites also hit the entire earth
it doesn't matter

this is like being afraid you'll be killed by lightning if you don't do stupid shit that'll get you killed by lightning

Europe has the whole Jewish and Roma thing, not to mention the more local examples
His messaging shifted after the 67 riots and dropped the urging for nonviolent solutions and condemnation of violence
he absolutely would have been considered a complex figure had he lived a natural lifespan
As I said, it had the effect of martyrdom

I just want to point out a smoothbore gun wouldn't cause tumbling at the range the footage implies this takes place at so the gun is either firing funky ammunition or it's made to be bad for some reason
I don't know why you think 'china is completely incompetent' is a more likely outcome here, I don't feel it's very realistic
several people are agreeing on rubber bullets
most of them involve hurting people
while it isn't something highly desireable, there are a lot of things I'd hate more in practice shooting

That's pretty rough

It's a pretty bad door to open, yeah
Look, you're young, so I don't really think you fully get that statements have implications beyond pure factual content; but saying "well the nazis weren't that bad, they could be worse/others are worse" will basically only ever make the wrong people interested in talking to you
Soviet cruelty is worth talking about; nazi crimes just aren't a yardstick suitable for use
for one
there was the implication nazis were acting civilized
It's crazy how fucked he is

(everything other than abel and cain which is probably a little less known than david and goliath at this point)
everything in genesis
I think there's a few a bit higher
the main point of the parable was that saul was too much of a pussy to take the challenge but david knew that god would 100% have his back; but it's endured as just a general underdog story, especially after goliath became 9 feet tall in some iterations of the story
David is the small loyal follower of god who defeats the champion of the invading army with god's help and is later made king of the israelites
alex jones has apparently been leaning hard on religious text in his diatribe today
it's maybe the most famous small underdog beats big powerful opponent story; it's in the old testament of the bible

You're arguing we should cut all luxuries and industries to "maximize production" - of what, I don't know, but I guess we can make a banger amount of paperclips if we tried
Socioprimitivism isn't progress
And too cruel
Aside from some pharmaceuticals because the government forces them to work that way
but you no longer see companies dump money into something that won't pan out for 10
It's one thing to invest in something that will start turning a profit in 2 years
Iski's point with dupont needs to be highlighted though
technically true and irrelevant to the actual flow of cash
"amazon started making profit" is in the same category of statement as "every movie loses massive amounts of money"

I was more getting at that Aristotle is kind of a general knowledge name

well, greek be greek

Including coming back to ideas of Aristotle to re-examine them
less /j than you think, there was a a lot of effort to recapture some of the ideas of greece and rome in the renaissance
if they represent freedom it's because you have the implicit right to shoot representatives of the government who you think are wronging you
this is the logical end result of pretending the 2nd amendment represents freedom
You either allow the finger to be firmly pointed or your conservatives think you're weak, right off the back of taking the fifth over and over (trump has been on record saying no one innocent would ever take the fifth)
there isn't really a powerful response to that
Declaring that the DOJ will have the warrant publically unsealed absent objection is a pretty clever move
we'll know more tomorrow, if trump doesn't ask to keep it secret

maybe it's me then, but I feel like you'd say the same thing if you were unsure
it's not obvious you didn't think that, please pick your language carefully if you're going to go "well duh" after
because you will probably, some day, be in the position of finding out that a long-time friend of yours doesn't respect you or perhaps others as humans, but you'll remember how *nice* of a friend they are
it's not, and you should read the thread if you think it is
I think I get what you mean Lily
Trump's hard to tell - I think he's 50/50. Believes some of it, will say the rest if he thinks people will like him more
but don't believe most of them are
mind you a few of them really are that dumb - MTG and boeburt drink the party's koolaid
It's a common political move these days to make the other side out to be a drooling idiot but it's dangerous to believe it
but I can definitely see them banning text books because they have anatomy diagrams
lefties are very fond of going "omg they're banning pronouns, how are they going to talk??" pretending the right really is stupid enough to... do... that? and not just say "no you have no right to tell people how they can address you"
you're conflating sensationalism with actual escalation here
being trans isn't a disability
they're like, the opposite of activists
yes
there's a lot of weird fucky elitism from a lot of centrists - a "I didn't take a side so I'm smarter than those who did" mentality
I am less upset at the people who just have beliefs in the middle and more upset at the people who think they have god-granted wisdom because "the truth lies between the two sides" or pretending "balance" is relevant whatsoever to coming up with ethical and effective policy
centrists, the scum of the earth
I doubt they like, hate her
They probably are just done being stressed by her bad decisions
Sounds like you're doing fine
You generally have to do like, a lot to get quasi-disowned

remember that you're actively trying to fight the gender dysmorphia
that's just your quirk
everyone has some quirk about them
the average person does not exist, that is a statistical model
no one is 'a normal person'
everyone is girl*
but that's irrelevant, past a point
yes
and a place of externalized ableism, frankly
and it's part of their everyday life
they have a disability
Do you think girls with glasses are lesser and abnormal
I'm sharing the perspective of people I've talked to
there's nothing to 'agree' with here
so to label it a disability, to them, feels like you're calling a core part of their identity a 'disability'
idk if it's what's messing with lily but I know some people get so invested in their life of fighting against the disability they can't imagine a life where they didn't have it
that would not be covered by insurance
yes this is generally how insurance covers what are otherwise plastic surgery cosmetic procedures
you would prefer to have the body you want rather than be in the body you don't want
it's a thing you'd prefer to not have
I mean
there is some nasty tendency in the trans community to gatekeep over this, to the point 'truscum' is slang for anyone who insists you need a dysmorphia diagnosis to be 'trans'
they want a different gender but their current form does not cause revulsion or distress
some people are trans without having gender dysmorphia
corrective procedures to help you deal with the disability
there you go
those are ways to treat the disability, like glasses treat bad eyesight
you want to be on HRT, maybe get cosmetic surgery, right?
no like, what part of that is you struggling to accept it as a disability
okay?
they're not the same thing
having gender dysphoria is
it's the most common, though some go for needles
it's a lot easier to swallow as a disability if it's the only way you can ever get treatment for it yes
I used to do it to my ex and she was both amused and annoyed
but that's related to the stigma of disabilities matt mentioned earlier
I struggled with something similar and it was because I felt like someone was calling me defective
Practical, without sentiment
if yes, it's probably a disability
but it means action against kiwifarms might be limited
on the whole this is an incredibly good thing
current US laws (the ones republicans keep claiming they want to change) make websites pretty not responsible for what users post on them
I think the framework is still in place, but they're not at the critical mass
they're alphabetical
the *state* supreme court is overturning a recent amendment to the NC constitution because they're saying the legislature would not have had the votes to do it if several districts weren't gerrymandered to the point of being unfair representation
holy shit
it's really one step forward one back I suppose; forgot japan still requires sterilization
two steps forward one step back
and they're probably getting fired for it
you don't work in the VA if you just want to murder veterans
it's laughable to think there was malice in here
I don't think it's particularly hard to read the intent
I'm going to guess that the employee talked with the veteran and thought their life sounded horrible and made the wrong but I feel not completely impossible to understand call of letting them know there was the option

They're not really being punished for their decisions at this time; investors are just backing out for the moment
It's funny but it's important to remember this isn't an actual financial loss
lol
like overall I think the ezra stuff is self-fixing because he's getting in actual legal trouble most of the time
I don't think it's particularly worth caring about
just to stop doing shit
I don't think he particularly has a plan to do anything about what he did
excuse for what
doing illegal shit doesn't mean you did immoral shit, seems like a weird aspect to focus on
Could be a backfire
resist.com memes or fanart of mass shootings is, for example, content I'd like to see removed off of art sites, as a hypothetical example
Some censorship can and should happen and it isn't particularly slippery
I don't think the slope is particularly slippy
There is that I suppose
Well for one they were broke, for another they were basically the ussr
This isn't all that different from slavery reparations discussions in the US

Even if this is posturing bullshit it's hilarious

According to cloudflare they're not doing this due to the anti-kf campaign
Oh shit cloudflare finally saw where the wind was blowing
Okay, then the sex workers can't report it, because they'll be blacklisted
because the sex workers can't report it, because they're committing a crime
In fact, all signs show it increases the amount of harm sex workers endure
it has not stopped sex workers from being abused and killed
That's the current state
Ah, outlaw sexwork
you've never talked about anything of substance in this conversation my dude and refuse to be pulled into actual discussions
you have two options in terms of policy - eliminating sex work isn't one of them
okay fuwafuwa let's assume the goal here is to minimize harm
you should probably legalize it then
that seems disingenuous
Would you seperate those who do porn from exotic dancers? It's not a division, it's a spectrum
this is true for most poverty level jobs
neither is my soul-sucking job; as others have pointed out this is not a condemnation of sex work, it's a condemnation of capitalism
I agree on a level, mind you, it's just, that's your angle
being forced into it because of capitalism is somehow 'wrong,' the implication is pretty strongly ethics/morality
yeah you did, you just didn't use the word
you said the root of the problem was that it was morally wrong
You're having 4 different conversations here and pretending that you can't make progress here because they're all the same thing, when they're not
when there are consequences for being an abusive client that shit falls off fast
so legalize it
With many types of labor you're selling your body just as much as you are in sexwork, there's just not penetration or sexual ogling
same with stuff like warehouse jobs
the latter you're getting paid to destroy your body, after all
I don't see sexwork inherently morally worse than professional sports
Craftsman makes tools as products, so your analogy is just, pointless
No? No, this is fucking dumb
Amazon uses people as a consumeable
Again - I don't think sexwork is fundamentally different from warehouse work
when they do it illegally there cannot be oversight
a worker doing an illegal job has to do it illegally, even if they don't get punished
But you think their work should be
The bottom line is you can't fully eliminate the abuse without unrealistic mass overhaul of the society. So you should be focused on harm reduction on multiple fronts, which criminalizing it isn't going to do
wasn't expecting "the neolibs are getting your children to whore" but ok
lol
assuming your average sexworker can't change our economic system, that sounds like a pretty desireable and reasonable goal to me for them to have
Right now if a pimp hits their girl, their only option is to say they fell down the stairs
Abuse will still happen but it's going to be a lot more manageable if there's actually an authority to report it to
Reaction emotes are disabled here for a reason
That's not acceptable behavior in this channel bubbles
there are options to make the girls safer and none of them are "make their job illegal"
etc
Register clients, so you can track down those who hurt the girls
Regulate clubs and provide them with options
Passive evil is so much more human
I'm not convinced of active evil; I think there's just enough rich 'tech moguls' who want to be in on anything like that
Mind you that's not because they're not making money but they're typically investing more than they make, because outside investors are so thick

<:CatThumbsUp:826138762450829313> wanted to make sure you could stop yourself before you hit that point
it's fine to discuss it, when you need to discuss it
ghostra I just wanted to ask if you were aware how often you bring this up
on second thought my curiosity for that isn't as strong as my desire to be done with this labyrinth
if I wanted clarification why did you open up with a question
also you're now definitely the one who's pushing for this conversation to be dragging on
So you had a problem with me claiming that the culpability isn't particularly notable because similar things were likely to be inevitable, so I stopped talking about that and instead tried to bring up a counterargument of someon who was more culpable, rather than argue about culpability in the first place
It's backing away from the stance you had a problem with?
that is a change of topic
ye
I changed topics with facebook after you indicated you didn't think the conversation was going anywhere
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I was willing to drop it but you brought it back up
I think to be culpable for the deeds of others, it needs to be reasonable that they would not have acted if not for you
I think zuckerberg has a whole lot more blame in damage to the internet than lowtax, frankly
Zuckerberg
you want a different type of argument
Also
To bring back the WWI analogy, historians agree that basically everyone was to blame for it
not when the dominos have free will
He can't take the blame because pushing a domino doesn't imbue you with responsibility
I'm arguing that lowtax can't really take the blame here when it's the community in general that is the problem and it would have perpetuated itself without him
usenet boards, SAOVQ, things in other languages
I mean there were definitely edgy corners of the internet with minimal SA connection
SA2 didn't need to exist because SA1 was created, but I think it was inevitable
but some edgy forum where people got together early internet
not *SA*
I mean
SA would exist without lowtax
the sites popped up regardless.
so it doesn't matter who he did and didn't include
hell, 4chan exists because lowtax *wouldn't* accept weebs
rather than lowtax's policy that created them?
doesn't the fact that 4chan, ED, KF all springing from SA really signify that it's the existence of that kind of group of people existing that's a problem and that they'd inevitably make problem websites with problem communities?
I view the existence of SA as an inevitability
someone would have made a site for estranged white kids if he hadn't
I don't think he can be blamed for that much
It'll be history in a generation, but putting non-celebrities in the crosshair isn't worth that
it's run by historians, remember
out of all the backups they do, kiwifarms is definitely more worth keeping than I'd say at least 90% of all other traffic, the same way it's a shame nazi records were burned
I can't imagine that's a real consideration
the argument is that the ability to pull up personal information of people who aren't particularly historically relevant is a harm that far outweighs the benefit of preserving it for later history
didn't elizabeth take harry out of the line of succession
idk, from my american point of view you should shrug and go "that's nice" but england's a weird cult when it comes to the royal family
looks more like a bunch of clowns than if they were in normal outfits
the theater is amusing
BBC's also in black outfits with black logos being used
I wonder if they're euthanizing the queen so she won't up and die during christmas season
the queen dying is the most interesting thing she's done in like 20 years because it means now england gets to put on fancy parades and pretend they care
The queen dying is less like the president dying and is more like.... madonna dying?
Monarchs just can't do much
Irrelevant
I imagine they tried to hide it, but you can't really hide the fact that all the royals are rushing in by jet
She's been rocky for the past few years - to the point of jokes about weekend at bernies, because she's been so infrequently seen
also I have only now learned that star spangled banner has been the national anthem for less than 100 years
america literally said "this sucks we can do it better" and samuel francis smith did my country tis of thee
it revolves around the "constitutional crisis" of australia in 75, which is a very polite way of saying 'coup'
mix watergate with the whole january 6th thing the US had
except actually crazier because like
it's basically watergate, but england
the queen is so rarely relevant in any decision making that matters
I'm not going to insist that people treat her like an angel
the death of a 96 year old figurehead head of state is not a tragedy, it is life, and she's definitely ruled over some pretty nasty things the empire did
Rules here is that you have to be civil and respectful to each other
it mean it sucks, but
this seems more like state-assisted nepotism rather than a broad reaching power
it's one of those powers that's absolute until they use it too much
lol.

if someone specifically brings up "it's just a few bad apples," it's worth bringing up the original saying is "one bad apple spoils the whole barrel"
I don't think there's a way to put this that isn't going to have a fringe of hyperbolic rhetoric, but that's probably harder to argue against
They do not have *absolute* power
but I don't think it's fully accurate with a dictionary definition of the term
I mean, it's fine if you want to be a bit hyperbolic
I think it's a stretch

Supply chain is a good argument tbh
and while again, I think it would maybe be fine and good for twitch to ban those kinds of games on their platform, I think the problem of that kind of unethical aspect of gaming shouldn't be addressed at the twitch level, but at the developer and regulation level
I agree it's a bad trend all around and twitch could decide to make that call if they want but I think it is not the same conversation as the *gambling industry* actively trying to appeal to youth
it's whataboutism
because it's 3 years old.
but sure, who knows, maybe they'll ban a 3 year old game no one would be streaming on twitch anyway
I'm fairly certain they mean cash gambling here because that's what's been on the line here
but lately bitcoin-related gambling sites have been paying creators to play on stream, give them slushfunds so they don't have to spend their own money, and advertise affiliate links
anyway I assume you haven't been in on this

If he moves to a country that wants to suck up to America, they will extradite him to America to face charges
What exactly do you want him to do
He's stuck living in nations not allied with America for basically the rest of his life
He's not doing anything of the sort
What?
(specifically his allusions that nuclear devices may be in play)
It's a micro aggression towards America because the USA tapped him on the shoulder and let him know they were ready to start a war over his Ukraine threats
peta is a joke yes
I 100% assume I'm having a bad faith conversation with someone when 'woke' gets invoked unless there's a clear tone of irony

where there is LGBT content as a very shallow inclusion in order to get the gay dollar
Pinkwashing is close to what you want, queerbaiting is also adjacent, but generally I use the term rainbow capitalism
'woke' as a criticism doesn't mean fake pandering, the right uses it to mean *real* pandering and concern for others, because they view that as a negative trait because people shouldn't have to be nice or... something

This is the third time this week that I've seen and frankly there might be more that I haven't. I wish you luck in dealing with it but this server may not be the place to deal with your fixation.
"livestock are cared for and fed so it's better to be livestock than feral"
no
Pretty much anything that relies on UGC
but it'll be rocky
I don't know if I'll truly be that upset to see the end of social media
oh dear
it's market cap is several orders of magnitude smaller
you can still trade in eth classic if you want
or other services, I suppose; but it's a very very rocky foundation to claim this can replace fiat currencies
the currency technically moves forward on both forks, the value that one has vs the other is determined by what people are willing to pay other currencies for it
maybe it was only half of etherium that was stolen, but it was a major compromising blow
so it split with the 'modern' branch pretending that didn't happen
All of etherium was effectively stolen at one point
yes
this isn't super related to why Crypto has flopped but it's a feature to note when contrasting it to modern money
it discouraged people from trying to get the ability to control a high enough amount of decision nodes to control the chain
when you spend crypto the blockchain can be messed with. This doesn't happen very often, but honestly, it's the one thing proof of work had over proof of stake
When you spend cash that transaction cannot be reversed
Crypto, *especially* now that we've moved to proof of stake, is fundamentally different
I wonder if the crypto crash will see a downturn in the amount of malware produced
no, but it's no longer sustained by burning real money
hype something up and it's worth more
they can exist, but something is only worth what other people are willing to pay for it
I haven't done enough of a study on people like rockefeller to know the answer to that
He unironically views himself as Tony stark or lex luthor
though I guess we got to publically shame him
I guess this means he thought he was losing the court case

"if someone isn't nice to you, ignore them" is not a terrible way to live your life but it is not exactly good foreign policy
Currently, they can't
No you misunderstand me, America won't pursue any act like trying to kick Russia out because that establishes a precedent that the US *can* be removed
The entire UN is set up to preserve the power of the security council above all other considerations
Because that means they're allowed to kick the US out

You're right, but naive
Municipalities don't have that funding lank
It's feasible and effective, though that's not the same conversation as whether it's a good idea
The idea would be to roll it into regular road maintenance as you adapted the roads over a decade, after laws are implemented outlining new standards
Ok but you're doing that anyway
Given you have to repaint roads every ~5-10 years anyway, it's a negligible cost with a relevant plan
Painting a few new lines on the road isn't comparable
Just, upgrading infrastructure to be smart car friendly isn't inherently expensive
I'm not arguing for this, mind you
Most of their errors have been reading the road wrong rather than  issues with other vehicles
You can do it without segregation
The topic was infrastructure for self driving cars, no idea what you thought was the topic
Roads need to be repainted anyway
You can do most of it with paint
Bad
It's actually not that bsd
Self driving buses
But a bigger issue is not having internet
It is; this isn't what it was designed for
the core concept of libertarianism is "freedom means no one can tell me what I can do"
"you shouldn't have the power to control what I do even if it's bad"
ah, the libertarian approach
let's not get carried away with rhetoric
if that amount goes through

The slur nickname is the most gross thing but all of their post about RT was fucked
This is more "I'm sorry I called you the n word while you were my slave, that's insensitive of me."
"You're not going to apologize for owning me as a slave?"
No, but the exceptions are few
It's the consequence of letting your art be driven by capitalism
The most you can hope for is a change of heart
There aren't innocent people at the top
There is, but it requires RT to be headed by good people
That would be fine but- yeah, that's my understanding
What ultimately matters is trying to prevent future harm
I disagree
I don't have any hostility towards you, I just disagree with people drawing their lines here
Of course you support that, you want the show to continue
Everyone has to make this decision on some level somewhere
It's your blindfold to wear
If you want to let horrible people use good people as a shield to dodge accountability, that's on you
They've got a decent resume, hopefully they can find a better project
Yes
I'm arguing that someone who is still supporting RWBY shouldn't pretend they have clean hands while doing so
Because it is honestly RWBY fans and not really anyone else that have positioned RT at their current prominence
Supporting RWBY is directly saying it doesn't bother you as a consumer that these people are employed because of you
Man I don't usually take a stance and say "you really should be boycotting this" but seeing rwby fans go "well it's crwby making RWBY and not RT's execs, I'll continue to support" is absolute blindfold tying
I think the fact it's higher than government rates is maybe news

where does forgiveness come in
You're never going to talk to her in your life or vice versa
Who the fuck cares if you forgive her for them or not, that doesn't mean you should stop fighting for protecting people like her
what, that people can't change in 15 years?
so I do think you shouldn't actually seperate the issues as that's what they want
there have been enormous letters written "we're sorry for the slurs" yet they haven't apologized for their treatment of her as an employee
I disagree with that; there's been a really nasty trend by RT people to pretend the slurs were the problem
if you were on the internet on 2009 deeper than facebook you were probably using some sort of slur somewhere
iirc
2009
as long as you don't turn WB into the boogeyman to blame for their problems
One of the people fired made it very clear they were let go because RT wanted to get rid of their position, not WB
"sorry for my behavior last year" never comes across as particularly genuine
right, which is why you generally need a decade + of observation time for this kind of thing
I think abhorrence at one's previous behaviors and determination to never repeat them is a form of accountability
I suppose that's fair, though quite honestly I do also believe there is some level of a statue of limitations on these things if behavior since has shown to be different
That was why I asked about suffering because I'm not sure where else a punishment can come from at this point
I just don't know what accountability she has left to give
She's already publically apologized and repudiated her past behavior, both when it came out before and now again
She's already been fired
I'm struggling to try and figure out what sort of accountability you're *looking* for here that hasn't been given
Do you want accountability or do you want suffering?
I'd say that was accomplished years back
even though *this has already been covered before years ago?*
we should take her to task?
So what

and has a legitimate jesus complex
I think he does it because he's arrogant and not very smart
I don't think so
he's also basically building a megachurch type thing with its own private school
no he sold 'flamethrowers' over the internet to fund his The Boring Company endeavor in las vegas
he just took someone else's work
he did not create it
spacex isn't elon's company
the flamethrower was both a lie (it is a giant lighter) and also to fund one of his most terrible ideas
stuff that it'd be absurd for another company to slap down a parallel water line to serve *their* customers
you'll be most familiar with natural monopolies in the form of utilities - gas, water, electricity
in economics they call this kind of service that needs massive infrastructure development and has significant diminishing returns with competitors a "natural monopoly" and generally for most natural monopolies it's a good idea for the state to operate or regulate them
that's the first obstacle
it's not even the brand name, it's literally just the difficulty of serving that many people that much data
to compete with youtube on par you need to have hundreds of millions in infrastructure, probably more
that's likely
eventually, yes
a shame on an otherwise great episode, honestly

correlation isn't causation, and even when it is, sometimes it's not the direction you think it is
and stopping them accomplishes nothing
they're up to the same thing every other company is
it's more
but they don't do just *anything* with it
does google abuse user data? almost certainly
with a few exceptions, but it's very uncommon and self-correcting
well
they have to gain from it
companies do not do evil for selfless reasons
meta is doing so badly they've been removed from the financial 'grouping' that was part of the tech industry stock index
They'd probably have to pull out of one of the two
It's worth pointing out that just because one country orders them to surrender data, that doesn't make them immune to liability in other countries for doing that
there's also the small factor that overthrowing roe v wade might indicate there is no legal right to privacy and there is zero controlling this
no, but you keep talking about how "we should stop them, why aren't you agreeing we should stop them"
I also think the tone of "why aren't you discord users stopping them" is leading you down the wrong path here
That's pretty much what it is
never vote to privatize your prisons
it is *in their interest* to avoid rehab
prisons are for profit in america right now
it happens sometimes but I'll remind you
if you keep them broke they'll keep doing crime
people won't be happy about it here but it's still the right thing to do
they're paying money for rent so a company can be richer
like prisons are being run for profit, there's really no excuse on this atm
yeah
data is easily accidentally biased via implementation
not having this kind of thing is how you get automatic sinks that can't tell when a black person is using it
as a very surface level example
Twitter was a member of Lou's organization, not the other way around
It's literally one of the advertising council members
It's not even a former employee lol
He unironically believes in the idea of rich white dudes saving the world
Elon's image always comes first
Zero way he'd throw his reputation as a smart business man in the trash in order to ruin twitter
I predict Elon is going to sell Twitter for a fraction of what he paid within a year
Which is what the major problems with Twitter tends to be
Oh for sure but he's the one responsible for coming up with the strategy of carefully applied manipulation of the masses via appealing to their fears
Rich evil dude yes
He singlehandedly created the modern media world
Murdoch either owns/set up them or they were inspired by the ones he made
You know those cringey conservative news stations like fox news
I unironically don't think it was Twitter, I think things such as Rupert Murdoch are more relevant there
Making your own communal space with something like forums is just going to be more controllable
It does feel like we're on the verge of downgrading from web 2.0
That's pretty Luddite tbh
Remember that anything set up is going to be set up to make money
Likely
Or a worse one
Getting rid of Twitter isn't going to help the internet be better
Twitter has a decent chance of surviving if Elon sells in the next 12 months
Meta
Just there is a more practical choice you could make
I'm not saying your decision is wrong

probably years, but I think musk is going to sell within a year
it wasn't, but musk made the company take on about 50x as much debt by buying it (capitalism is confusing)
it'll be the next memorial day
we're already at the point where there's an entire demographic you can market to who has no direct emotional ties to it
anyway you'll definitely see 9/11 sales someday
it's the onion one

he's not, he's running an platform where the userbase is the asset and sellable product
a million different critics have already pointed it out but musk assumes he's running a tech service where the platform is the product
I've followed him on twitter for years and he was tweeting like, last week
this is blowing my mind
the question is how punitive do people feel
I'm pretty sure everyone completely believes it was an accident
Maybe loaning a regiment or two
Limited additional military aid to the Ukrainians
NATO military response is the bad outcome here
assuming there's any notable military response at all, which might not happen
there's been a nonzero chance of nuclear action for the past 6 months or so, but I don't think this amplifies it unless NATO decides to push past ukraine

I don't think it's really sustainable to just have a dozen platforms and think they'll all feed business, something's going to be the one people actually check
ah, my mistake then
it feels a tad holier than thou to say "well you should have been making connections elsewhere" - you have to go to where the clients are, not hope they come to you
it's not people's only platform to network and sell things, but does it matter if you're still keeping your 25% other sales going if you lose 75% of your income

there are very very few places in america that you will be living just as good a life with public transportation as you will with car ownership
I don't actually think that's logical, I think that's intuitive (which doesn't mean it's right)
that's the same video
Morally justified is not the same as committing net good
I don't think it matters if it's someone's fault, an action causing 'net good' has to assess *consequences,* not *responsibility*
but I think the reductive analysis is insufficient
I actually don't think Matt's wrong, for the record
Fenny's point was that they considered the training of AI on art without consent was, in her opinion, unethical, and your counter argument was "what you wanna control what we can code?"
it absolutely was the point as far as I could tell?
It does also stress out and may have further consequences to any and all employees that are being held accountable for the increase in store shrink, so slapping a label of net good without further thought is probably incorrect
Did I miss something? That seems pretty inappropriate for this channel
As an extreme example, someone could sit down and decide, "Hey, I could create a chat-bot that tries to drive people to suicide"
there is no human right to code without regard to ethics, I found this part of the argument really disingenuous. I absolutely do want to tell people what they can't code.
It's worth noting one of Kanye's last posts was making fun of Elon
three different presidents neglected to pardon him so I don't think he's got a chance of entering any america allied country
yeah, only logical act from his situation I think
You are not going to stumble into a solution where workers are not held accountable for loss of material assets
I also think it isn't changing
I absolutely think it is a system being carried out by actors
they will get punished for this regardless, because the systemic change isn't coming
questionin why the workers are getting punished for this does not alter the situation
so it's probably much worse now
yes, I used 2018 numbers
only 21% of americans own real estate (I'm not counting the people who think they own property but are just paying mortgage to the banks who actually currently hold their property)
I was more arguing that the simplicity of your original statement left too much out to draw a conclusion of net good at that point
I have a need for Bush to say Kanye doesn't care about black people on national TV
But if you tell someone if they don't mask they'll maybe die in 10 years no one will care

I think it's terrible. If you think it's a useful function, I'm curious to ask how much time you spend on facebook
we've finally managed to move close enough that a bike ride won't starve you to death, in theory
Imagine having to bike to somewhere to eat because you're at risk of starving, but it was so far away that you'd lose more calories going there than you would eating it
fission is massively cheaper to buy fuel for, admittedly, unless we can figure out a way to not use tritium
Theoretically, nuclear fusion is a much more attractive power source than fission - more sustainable, higher yield, virtually no chance of chernobyl like disasters and no notably terrible nuclear waste - but it's just been windmill tilting for the last 4-5 decades.
I'm leaving a lot out on how fusion actually works so accept this as more of a "physics magic" thing right now because stuff like binding energy is not really possible to do ELI5
basically there's invisible energy inside atoms holding the insides together. We love energy, so we want to steal it. There are two ways to steal energy from atoms. 

Conventional nuclear power, also known as nuclear fission, tries to get this power from heavy atoms by breaking them apart. You get two smaller atoms and a lot of extra energy.

What these people are trying to do is nuclear fusion, where you take two smaller atoms and try and glue them together. This *also* makes energy, but you have to get the atoms really hot to want to try to do it. The major problem nuclear fusion has had was that whenever they tried to do it, they would waste more energy making atoms hot than they'd get from the atoms once they combined. This is the first time where that is not the case, meaning they've actually 'made power.' 

It does not mean we can start making fusion power plants yet, but it does mean it's a lot more worth in putting money into research for it.
I can really go ELI5 if you want but if you have a ground base you'll understand more
ok but you know about atoms and nuclei right
do you understand the principle of fusion power? I'm unsure whether to explain everything or just what was achieved here that's notable
still, this is a hump that they couldn't get over for 40 years, so it's a start
just not like, an absurd amount in terms of daily utility
but yes it's a lot of energy to dump into a pinhead
average american home uses about a megajoule a day if my napkin math isn't terrible and I didn't screw up units somewhere
though as iski points out, the cooling issue is a problem, they'll either need better cooling or a better surplus
and up until now it cost more power to energize them than you could harvest
but you have to get the nuclei pretty energetic to want to do this in the first place
the loss in mass is turned in to energy, as according to the e=mc^2 thing
no thermodynamics are being broken, the extra energy comes from the fact that when you fuse nuclei (at least those suitable for fusion), the resulting heavier nucleus is actually a bit less than the total mass of the two lighter nuclei
oh, I understand the question now
the point is to make power, after all
if it wasn't theoretically possible no one would bother trying
which has not been done in fusion until now
it means they got out more energy than they dumped in
fusion hit 150% yield
kinda big news
https://www.llnl.gov/news/national-ignition-facility-achieves-fusion-ignition
this is just the same thing as the gal gadot girlboss stuff from a few years back
nuclear physics just doesn't make intuitive sense with newtonian instincts
this is decidedly not ELI5 which is why I left it overly simple
yes, we can now get a walnut to the moon
but we have not yet figured out how to keep a human from dying in space or keep the rocket from crashing into the moon
we've finally built a rocket that can physically hit the moon
if the goal was to put a human being on the moon
let me put it this way
How big a deal it is is hard to say
a power source that eats more power than it produces isn't much of a source; they've finally been able to say "It is a power source"

how dare *my* life be impacted because *your* life sucks
stuff like affirmative action or taxation to support a welfare state are the most vile concepts to them
the liberty in libertarianism refers to doing basically whatever you want, short of *obviously* negative impacts on someone else's life like murder
and they think this is a positive thing because they think you want this too
that's what it boils down to
they think that no one should have the right to make them be fair to someone else
they don't care about fairness, actually

He just made the news for revealing he lied about basically everything he said when campaigning, tbf
probably iguanas aside from the salmonella problem
Would you agree that a first time offense warrants being asked to leave
I mean personally I kind of wish dogs were banned from being considered 'emotional support animals' because of situations like this (or dog attacks) where they're revealed to be health hazards too late
you have to accept emotional support animals but if it's impossible for a *specific* animal to adhere to it than they're in violation
You're legally forbidden from doing that
I'm not a dog owner but does it matter? Like, if you cannot control it you shouldn't bring it. If it's impossible to control it, it should be forbidden to bring it.
They should take normal animal transportation actions instead
If it's really that hard to stop them they shouldn't be allowed?
It's a euphamism that pretty strictly means "doesn't shit or piss where it's not supposed to"
which is better than an alternative
it's responding to your inability to control it
Fixing it after the fact is not controlling it
they didn't
I'm sympathetic to dumping them out in the cold, that's bullshit, but I'm also minimally tolerant of passing off normal pets as vital 'emotional support animals' due to having to deal with stupid shit nonstop in retail over a decade
it's not, they give out "is not housebroken" as an explicit example.
trump now coming out as pro-abortion? yeah he's dead in the water
It'd be funny if family friendly was a condition heavily enforced because it'd destroy hololive
Please provide context to foreign tweets
It's a sensitive topic and there's a not insignificant amount of LGBT people on this server about magical girl lesbians, and we've watched a progression of laws limiting the rights of LGBT and trans in particular.

Over the past 3-4 years in particular, anti-trans has become a significant attack vector of the republican party as a platform, so that they don't have to address abortion or poverty. The fact that the right wing is hostile to trans life is more fact than it is theory at this point, though saying that every republican dreams of sticking a knife in a trans person is definitely not true.
It is, it's the right wingers who have power and matter
This is showing that they're 'fighting the gays' and makes them more electable
right-wing lawmakers in heavy red areas
also majority of right wingers is a little inaccurate
The majority of right wingers do not care if trans people live, I think would be more accurate
Are you aware of how many right wing people post memes celebrating the fact that trans people tend to kill themselves? They're aware of the high suicide rates and view it as humanity "self-correcting." Denying treatment pushes that percentage up.
it isn't a law yet
well, I should say bill
the law is definitely not a protective law, it is a proscriptive law designed to hurt
they should get to transition
If you think that someone of a given age is in sound enough mind to sign up for the military and decide if people should live or die
You're effectively scarring someone's body
The point was more to highlight how absurd the 26 year limit is - particularly in that the more you allow puberty to finish, the less effective hormonal and physical methods of intervention for transition are
Almost is a lot better than zero
shouldn't your brain be forced to fully mature before you make this choice?
but going through puberty is not
going off of puberty blockers is almost entirely reversible
Also, you should be banned from getting tattoos or any other body modifications before 26
I think that the 26 thing is absolutely abhorrent, personally; if that logic was correct, puberty blockers should be mandatory from 10 to 26
It's not that doctors are accurate, it's that it's a self-selecting process
There's an immense amount of reasons you don't want to transition, so generally people who reach that point are pretty sure, because you're actively accepting you're asking for your life to get worse
No that's pretty right
aw
The difference between an endorsement and reluctant complicity is sleeping with it at night
If you're for strengthening the 2A, you're okay with school shootings - not a supporter, maybe, but you view them as a price worth paying.
for example, I think if you think that libs of tiktok should have a platform, you are okay with nightclub shootings
I don't quite agree with that in a whole scope, but I think some lesser versions of that are true
It is a thorny problem but it's, at best, an evil that many have decided they can live with in the name of "fighting inflation" or something.
the group endorses the harm by continuing to vote for the representatives
It's relevant though - right wing people very rarely publically fight against these policies
I think sapphire's point was more "if no one asks you to leave, you're welcome to stay"
I really can't say if most republicans want to actively hurt trans people or not because I haven't seen a poll on it, but I think it's less of a slam dunk that it's *not* a majority view than you think it is
I could definitely teach a 6 year old how to use one, though not how to use one safely
most guns are very easy to learn to operate
more proof that republicans complaining about the deficit is hypocrisy
Sorry for the bad experience
That's fair
Other people have requested that
I can disable this channel's visibility for you if you like
I understand you're feeling pressured by people and you're absolutely not required to engage in this channel or agree with people in it. I'll explain that stance a little more; Libs of TikTok isn't just a "haha look at these people" account these days (if they ever were). The account isn't just a humor page, it's definitely a political movement spokepiece, incentivizing people to do something about the "liberal groomer threat." The gay nightclub that got shot up a few months back was mentioned by the account a week earlier, and there was a terrorist attack on Florida power stations that ended up cutting power to a town where there was a drag event happening at that moment, once again publicized by Libs of TikTok. The account is being used as a weapon  to get people upset about innocuous events and people are dying.
It's a bad position to take unless the user is otherwise known to post AI art though
AIs struggle with stuff like that but that doesn't mean they can't get it right
But not a foolproof one
why are you defending an ai bot
on doing some digging I definitely do see people talking about it, so it is what it is, but finding out that a trans harassment account harasses trans people is not exactly a shock
I don't argue that they probably deserve it but I'm unsure the community wants this to be the Call-out Channel
I'd kind of like it if we could use this channel for actual discussion instead of just putting random people that maybe 500 people on the internet have heard of on blast
Government funded military research is, on some levels at least, comparable to science grants in terms of measuring progress decoupled from capitalism

if you replace pitballs with cops in that post it's almost funny

it shot up a lot post-covid

google agrees here
I don't see how that's specifically about the people versus the state
that's what I'm refuting
You claimed the yellow peril was long dead
I was confused by this at first but I'm circling back to it
"is the media spurring on a fear of china"
but
The point I was making was not "is it correct to have issues with the chinese"
in a 'democracy' the citizens are nominally responsible for the government's actions
and yeah
I do genuinely think there is a difference in reaction between chinese and chinese-americans here
for one
not all jews are israeli

ok
If you're going to keep playing the "china/chinese" game I'm done talking
I think you're drawing a distinction that doesn't functionally exist between fear of the chinese state and fear of things from china

Yes, it's pretty nakedly partisan and not for any social good
Generally after school programs, at least where I live, are not run directly by the school
Ok but the nft bro getting wrecked is kinda funny
anyway most people do agree that blockers should be used instead of more aggressive medical intervention while a teenager anwyay
I can't comment on the specific news story you read, but I have read news stories similar to it, and some of those did not come from a good place
I understand that it's not directly about transphobia, but "I don't want to help trans people" tends to be an overwhelminly strong motivation for these kinds of decisions and news stories
Doctors aren't immune from having transphobia
There's virtually no medical procedure with a lower regret rate
Regret does happen but it's a 1% or less thing
you can think of puberty as being forced to take HRT, blockers let you opt out until you decide what you want
at least it distracts them from eroding every single social net they can see

the only country doing better than japan that I'd consider on the world stage here is Australia
that said
at 1.3 births per woman
well, tied for 5th with china
by that metric japan is still sixth worse
alright
(singapore is tremendously worse than japan though, at -4.2% growth vs -0.5%)
only singapore and HK are off worse
and if you remove america samoa and marshall islands for being both not countries and somewhat irrelevant on the world stage, it's 3rd worst
just checked 2021 values, japan's around 5th worst for growth rate in east asia
the biggest negative number
You're pretty clearly carrying some resentment around about them even aside from their current behavior, so it might be worth some introspection as to what the friendship means and does for you
<a:headpat:642599312173563907>
If you plan to call them out on it, do it delicately unless you're fine with things falling apart
Yes, it can certainly lead to unhealthy and toxic behaviors
Being insecure is a character flaw but not a moral weakness, just to clarify
It sounds like they're very insecure and you're very important to them and they need to be reassured that they are important to you. You probably need to explain in return that even if they are important to you there are some things in your life you value very highly and it's not an insult to them that you're visiting other people.
you are competing with other hobbies and friends for that time to be spent with you
your friends have limited time in their lives
all close friendships are ones of contention
I'm going to say something a bit cynical and realist here
but I don't think you owe them the trip
that *plus* being left out has them worked up, with probably a good dose of irrationality to boot
from their perspective, at least
they probably view themselves as a contender for being your (or one of your) 'besties' and the fact they never knew about the trip implies an amount of distance between the two of you
Hm, I kinda understand some of the context better then
Sorry, I mean spinning lies about valuing their friendship
No. Let your ex know that you value their friendship and company - if true, don't spin lies until you're stuck in a corner - but explain that this trip is for this important reason to you and that hopefully you and your ex will get to spend time together on a different trip.
however the rest of the pattern suggests they're a bit too clingy for both of your own good overall, so establishing boundaries is good
So I think them feeling stiffed that you're not seeing them in berlin makes sense - they're not entitled to your company but I understand being upset they're being skipped over
I was going to say, "I thought they were your ex?"
It's not a specific friend they have a problem with, but any friend?
they haven't gotten to the part they need advice on yet
I think y'all should let armis finish lol
If you don't say "this is the end" maybe they can reflect about what their priorities were
I mean
it's probably better than just airing every frustration
That's not a bad line to take
No reason for you to use your money (and possibly time off work) to do this
~~unless you're down bad for them~~
Given the choice you should nurture the relationships you have, not the relationships that might be
I could kinda tell you were just bubbling over Aria, sorry for kinda just letting you go off lol
We've known each other for a while now and you're a pretty cool person and I think you can do better than this weird clingy goal-oriented friendship
that's kinda weird

Pretty hard, unless you think you shouldn't be criticized at all for what you consume and broadcast and profit off of
yeah, good piece
> Are there trans people who talk in extremes about this game? Absolutely. But for every example you can hit back with of exactly that happening, we can respond ten-fold with what happens to us. This is not a ‚Äòtwo wrongs make a right‚Äô situation. This is a ‚Äòone wrong makes the news and one much larger and more vitriolic wrong is ignored because it only happens to trans people‚Äô.
wild that it's actually a nuanced piece, I've seen stuff from this outlet before that's been good too

harassment is bad, but if you just say "harassment bad" you're leaving out the other half of the story
"I obey the word of wisdom!!! thankfully god cares more about me drinking coffee than me kicking out my trans kid"
"I do communion, keep the sacrament, and do temple shifts, that's all that's needed to be a good person, right?"
my parents would have to be *pretty* awesome for that name to not change
I just don't know many transwomen that would be fine with classmates going "Hey Ryan what's up"
I'm fine with Sirona but they definitely could have done better than Ryan. Overall I think the name thing is overblown though
I'd love for JK to write about the history of wizards in india
That's really what's causing the Legacy backlash
On paper you're getting mad over a sandwich, but the real feeling is that you're just realizing *you don't matter to them* if it inconveniences their animal desires
"Sorry, but it's a really good sandwich, you know?"
"bro what the fuck"
and you're like
when you see your ally give money to a group that directly funds organizations to eliminate you
It's chik fil a again, really
it's that they're unwilling to refuse making money off the game, or refuse having fun with it, when they're aware of the discussion around harry potter and JK and they're aware how members of their audience view the game
The concern isn't that the streamers are supporting transphobia
It's also worth noting that the "why be mad at streamers? they did nothing wrong" argument misses the point
but that's more baseline HP lore
the antisemitism regarding goblins that steal children is more lol
the antisemitism regarding the horn is just kind of weird and such a deep narrow cut that it feels like it legitimately could be a coincidence
clearly they didn't give a shit about what they were being 'inclusive' over
but it's just
people are treating Sirona Ryan like it's transphobia and that's dumb
yeah
it hints they didn't actually talk with anyone trans about it
it's just really weird that they'd settle on Ryan
when you have the power to choose your name and have already done so, having a name that happens to leave a bad taste in one's mouth (it would leave a bad taste in my mouth) is a direct issue of character choice rather than 'not a big deal'
I mean the entire ideology boils down to "we were first, so we're better/should be in charge" doesn't it
I think they're talking about the black supremacy group
the wage difference is weird though
if you work 40 hours a week you're no longer part-time, this generally means different labor laws are in play, which means you're more expensive to hire
it also doesn't really ethically matter though
yes it is technically sexist to assume that
well this is depressing
It does prevent Biden from looking good
Just learned that Ohio never declared a disaster so FEMA can't really be invoked
thatd be amazing
Depends exactly what they're doing. "Hey I got an ai to make Barak Obama talking to a cheese sandwich" isn't quite the same as "I'm an AI artist, here's my portfolio of stuff I/we have created"
No, you just directly modify the content without permission yourself.
In this context it is a tool directly comparable to photoshop
Maybe that does deserve more of a look, but it's something most people, including probably you, are fine with
But if someone is using it as advanced Photoshop for a meme, unless it's being done for profit, it's not really any more or less unethical than using images for memes without permission
I'm against deep fakes to, say, bring back young mark Hamill without him actually involved in a production
Depends on the use
Google is the nwo or something
"pay up or you have to use *Google* authentication"
Assuming the primary market is right-wing chuds it makes sense
clearly women are in their prime when they are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13...

AAA titles in general
No
For AAA development
Ubisoft has said they think the genre is dead and possibly unsustainable
Regardless of where the border is
"what is an unethical meme" is a whole nother conversation but I think it can be universally agreed they can exist
Probably
Yes, and can be equally unethical or irrelevant
But if I "design" a giant robot and it's just blatantly copying stuff and I pretend it's special and unique
Some works it doesn't matter who made something - if I make a meme venn diagram, who cares
Kind of
Square sold off all their interesting IPs so I'm fine with that
7
There's like
Studios that can reliably hit that are almost non existent
The genre is increasingly a gamble that has to sell 6 million copies or flop
Honestly I think Ubisoft is right regardless
Dead space remake made me realize how much I missed 15-20 hour linear experiences

They're clearly not giving up *quite* yet but news came out that said they cancelled 4 titles recently that never even got publicly revealed
bf-21.5
I'm more upset that discord renders the non-simplified quote marks like that, that's hideous
The US has enough standing forces to engage in multiple theaters at once as is, and you'd see an enlistment surge (and lowered entry requirements, which right now are pretty steep) if we did actually go to war
I don't think we'd see drafting in WWIII, honestly.
it's unlikely the selective service act will ever really be activated, US military doctrine's too focused on trying to produce capable soldiers rather than unlimited soldiers
anyway, I can respect the willpower is magic stuff because it results in the fun shounen moments where the results of a character arc are directly unleashed in a special attack
mostly because it ditches the format halfway through and has some pretty impressive peaks
it's probably the best monster of the week mecha out there
gaogaigar
and that really kind of screws with the previous series if you reflect it backwards when the series wasnt written around that concept
because the sequel OVAs went back and changed the rules from the power reactor just being magic technology energy to power derived through willpower
I've just had long arguments about this one in particular when it came to a specific robot anime
yeah that's fair
sometimes it's an obstacle
sometimes the story can make it work
That loops back to point B where you just have to conclude that the hero isn't heroic enough
limitations and rules help avoid that
That typically either leads to very cliche problem solving of "just power up until you can blow through it" or  it leads to the unheroic thought of "well they just weren't courageous/strong/willfull enough to do this"
a lot of them really like pretending the magic is structured but it's still all adhoc whatever-makes-the-plot-go-forward
make-shift magic systems are probably my least favorite part of LNs
barely any establish hard limits to magic in the first place, except as reasons why it can't be a deus ex machina
I know they're out there but I can't recall many atm
hm
the people who have powers have specific powers that are capped in specific ways
another would probably be the Mistborn series?
and that's all she has to work with
but she can just... control bugs
not like, spiderman
and the protagonist is a teenage girl that has... bug powers
it's about superheroes that have all sorts of wildly different powers
honestly the first one that comes to mind is a web serial called Worm
but I think I prefer the settings where magic is individually capped at different levels and handed out in different specialties, because that's where you get fun underdog stories
I respect your commitment to the neet day cycle
I've got it on my hard drive
is there a way to view just the rabbit chat
because you need time to process
also I *kind* of feel like there should be a break between the series and movie 3
the series replaces them
he can go back and watch them himself later if he wants
movies 1 and 2 are totally skippable
damn a whole 6 hour marathon?
ah, makes sense
thanos shows up and everything
I get it
I have no idea how that happens
I know what time it's at I'm just not sure I'll be here then
yeah if I'm here
but what if I don't want spoilers <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
on a complete whim I decided to download and watch A Certain Magical Index
hm
dang
yeah I don't think there's a way to stream only the chat
anime club always makes me think of the kc green comic
isn't the reason because we don't need a euro or pound sign on the keyboard
Everything that happens is to tell their story
It's worth noting that only two characters matter in madoka
Mami dying was significant because it broke the rules, not because mami was developed
Did you watch Madoka when it aired? It matters a lot for that point
She felt entitled to his relationship
Honestly the business with violin boy is sayaka's character flaw not his
Kyubey goes over that in ep11
All wishes are doomed to end in zetsubou anyway
You can have a complete story and still have more to say, <@174440042289168384>
I'm still split on it but we can discuss it later
Madoka's idea would have been used sooner or later
The thematics of the middle aren't the same as the final theme and I'd like to break it down
I think I need a third watch with a pad of paper next to me
anyway <@256945399338631168> a lot of what shirobako touches on is that most failures are time-related
Girlish Number is made by people with opposite beliefs
Shirobako is made by people who ultimately love the industry, despite its faults
though if you want the *real* cynical look, Girlish Number is the show
Shirobako also gives you partial answers as to why anime turns out shitty sometimes
Well, if you ever find yourself caring about the production side of anime you should watch it
I feel like most anime fans should see it once they get to the level of tracking seiyuus, directors, and studios
I should watch shirobako again
I think that's somewhat important for how they get treated sometimes in the later shows
also the part where the zentradi killed 90% of the human race
I mean more the fact that the zentradi are, in some ways, a subjugated race
nnnnnnno the whole thing with the zentradi was pretty important
I mean macross/kawamori hasn't been good in ages
does jumping into delta without background even work
(movie's amazing though)
GuP TV was really rocky sometimes
it's also arguably not even good if you're not into military stuff
no
it's wonderfully whack in its premise
if you want the latter, AKB0048's great
or do you want symphogear "lmao what"
High Quality Idol
do you want
Only if you get addicted to it
Is that espionage
Rebellion is so pretty I'd almost suggest sync watching private downloads instead of rabbit
(she was also arupin but that is less surprising)
ogasawara
no
speaking of shirobako I just learned kirika's VA is in it and is in the *last role I'd ever guess her in*
The love the studio had for it shines through everywhere
and *probably* my top 5
shirobako is on my top 10 anime of all time list
this also reminds me of when kawamori was fired mid-series from basquash
that's spectacularly bad production failure happening there
a 1-cour anime had 2 recap episodes and had to have the last episodes *delayed by 6 months* when it aired
did you notice the ".5" episodes?
ok
talking about bad production always reminds me of girls und panzer
movies and OVAs are where you get to have cushy margins
and you have limited staff, so if you want to put more people on to work around a problem for episode A, episode B slides a day or two
but there's so many errors that can eat your margins
To a point, yeah, and I'm sure that's somewhat true
I'm sure they wish that was true
hahaha
when you see an episode of anime aired, it was probably finished anywhere from 2 weeks to a few hours earlier
Though I got all the way through vividred
Strike Witches hits fanservice levels I'm not comfortable with
Not that I expect greatness after pocketful of rainbows and AO
Speaking of het romances I need to watch the e7 movies
There is way more filler than that
It's loooong
It's why it looks amazing
Yeah
Mostly Madoka and monogatari
It's fine
It broke me
I don't think I've read a manga after hajime no ippo
I mean, if you want to meme go for it
No
Fyi
Asuka shikinami soryu

The modern tsundere is a bad shadow of her and 2 asuka was a bad parody of that
Asuka was once upon a time a complex character
Asuka is trash in 2
But 2 was very good
I think eva tv was better than 2 in a lot of ways
3 wasted it
2 was extremely good
I can't wait for 4.0 to come out so I can go 'yep it sucked'
I have discussed eva more than I will ever discuss any other anime
Because 'it's a cartoon'
He saw it at 12
A friend of mine was in Japan when EoE was in theater
Less idol anime and more berserk
I pine for a universe where idolmaster doesn't exist
I've seen a chunk of mazinger z
Do we have to have watched the complete thing
Oldest anime hmm
I really want outlaw star because the xgp-15aII is one of my favorite spaceships ever
Outlaw star in srw when
It's so tasteless that if someone made it all the way through I'm not sure I want to watch anime with them
The ultimate in shitty shock value entertainment
Hopefully never, I never want that property to make anyone money ever again
Fuuuuck valvrave
I'd say cross ange is the one with the rape scene but UNFORTUNATELY it's not the only mecha with one
Also srw hasn't been that good in like 10 years I m o
I actually think rebuild is beyond srw fixing, the rewriting is just such a huge difference it's not a fix
I still hate 3 less than the second half of evol
but nothing major
noncritical stuff
especially in part 4 which had a lot of uh
there might be a few fights that got snipped out
not that there's really much at all important that hangs around between parts
I don't think the anime leaves anything important out
like 3 was
especially since some of the parts will probably be multiseason
part 6 is one of the worst ~~along with part 1 and 3~~
also I'm not sure if they'll ever actually do part 6
instead of waiting 7 years for them to get to part 8?
it's probably worth reading?
to be fair it is also trash
10-12 seems to be the shitlord age
8-10
idk 14 year olds are harder than like
kids are fun but I only do kids a few hours a week
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I'll show up to rebellion if I'm free
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313> So disappointed I have to miss it
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
rip
odds are I won't be here for it
I kind of want to rewatch akb0048 but it's way too mediocre to watch by myself
Homura vs Mami is probably the best looking magical girl fight though
But shaft has always been good at that
I respect the movie and series for trying to do anime as an artform
Reality has been broken twice, there's no reason a 4th movie couldn't break it again
The movie is an escalation and I'm still annoyed we never got a movie 4
The movie is about a more fundamental change
They did leave the series there
way2go
I'm not a fan of k on though ive never watched the whole thing
Daily lives of high school boys
Nichijou is excellent and one of the two slice of life shows I don't hate
yeah I wasn't part of k-on either
just send a message with a number 1-3
no command needed
type a number
the pains of having no reliable schedule
yeaaaaaaah retail buddies
we hop on rabbit on a certain day and time
GuP news felt appropriate here
Remember, GuP spoiler discussion is off limits in this channel
It's only part 1 I heard
Not der Film, das Finale
The new movie
A movie came out late last year so numbers should be up
Which boils down to 'whatever I like right now'
I doubt there will be a Streisand effect due to how doujin authors choose their content
Oh the arrest was november
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-06-23/girls-und-panzer-restricts-production-sales-of-unofficial-goods/.133122
There's apparently been an arrest over someone selling school patches
Which is a good reason to not make it
It'll possibly stop them from selling at comiket
They announced it would no longer be
Doujinshi and stuff is usually overlooked
rip
GuP unofficial merch is now forbidden as copyright infringement
I know it got dragged put by a factor of like 5
Did the dub ever come out for that
the director for keijo is the codirector
it was some major group
godrobes and heavenly devas and etc
was it commie that had the stupid translations for kill la kill
actually speaking of weird translations
~~heavenrend~~
really if a goofy name puts you off you're probably taking this show too seriously
yeah that's how it translates
it's inherently silly and a silly name is suitable
noticing they're *playing girls sports with fucking tanks*
if you think it's excessively silly you've stopped uh
I had a tankwondo sub and thought it was perfectly fine
taekwondo > tankwondo
it sounds great
it's such a good fuckin name
??? what's wrong wit hthat
commie is my second most loathed group after gg
*Eotens*
actually I take it back
commie used up their "fun" with jojo
yeah I've never deleted it
force everyone to download das film seperately so they can appreciate the HD bolts and screws
no, I don't know, and however many we do
so we'll see
better paced than gup
but it's uh
we got through madoka in 2 weeks
that's all I know
it has good smut
it does fit though
thanks I hate it
I have a suicidal friend right now
I'll be in if I can make it
if you're not down to meme when watching this show why bother
tankwondo is great fight me
ruri is still one of anime's greatest condenscending loli characters
because surely if they did it would be funny and great
and shame they never made a movie out of it
shame it has no fucking ending
such an interesting show and such clever satire
oh nadesico
Have fun kids
She looks generic and you can find shit just as good everywhere else
This sounds terrible
It was sweet but also
The best scene anywhere is pushing it I feel
it was a very sweet scene
"play until your fingers bleed" isn't just a saying
but for new players that's absolutely true
you can make a sharper impact with a hard plastic thing than a fleshy finger
though a pick can produce a different timbre on the sound I'm pretty sure
as long as you can adjust to metal strings
<#336310266654490624>
*yes*
It's a good song and Chris stops being an introvert for 3 minutes to think fondly of her new friends who never show up again
It feels like "We have 3 minutes, let's plug in the b-side"
cliche, not really developed, and not followed up on
I wasn't overly impressed with the show but the movie made it worth it
it's incredible
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I get tempted to see it every other year
Has anyone seen skygirls
also still pissed that she's so white
why are you doing this to the most kickass girl in the franchise
but she's also fucking Jun
Like, she's pregnant, fine, I get it
yeah the only time she actively did something, it was give someone else the power to fight in her place
I don't remember her doing anything but being pregnant like the whole film
she is useless pregnant frail waifu ~~and also really fucking pale/white~~
movie sucked
yeah I'm doubling down on it
OH MY FUCKING GOD I forgot what they did to Jun
and all controlled by sayaka
except its all networked
it becomes the new nuclear power
Koji as a scientist is pretty neat to see though
I told you it wasn't a great movie
things have been changed by photon power
it's 10 years later
the first third of the movie is spent doing a really clumsy job of worldbuilding
*maybe* 3
2 stages
the plot exists but it's going to be handled by about like
maybe two, actually
there's only one new mechanical design
there's no new attacks
it dominating the mazinger slot in srw is going to mean *nothing*
it felt that long though
maybe it was less than that
to try to convince you to forget you sat through 35-40 minutes of shit
it hits you with its best stuff at the end
Kouji/Sayaka resolution is nice, at least
there were things that I enjoyed but there was fundamental flaws in the directing
dancouga?
...
it's a very good impression of what they would have done in the 1970s if they had access to modern cg
the action is cute though
it just jumps everywhere without pacing
a third of it is some of the worst stitched together film I've seen
thanks zolgnein now you made me sad again that I paid to see infinity in theater
I do not accept that it's possible to write this without being a smug little fuck that may or may not deserve what's coming
I accept that this might intentionally be a shitpost to rile people up
http://commiesubs.com/shingeki-no-kyojin-01/
THAT'S OKAY SAKI-CHAN, I HAVE IT BOOKMARKED
~~its peak is the commiesubs writeup on eotens~~
None of the bug men have ever done it for me

fun fact: the two main characters of kawaiikochans are in the background of a skullgirls level
good choice

it goes for 3 more panels but that one's good enough to standalone, honestly
this one is a gem
but I still live in the age where you could
just bad
their gag is less relevant now that you'll never find fansubs that are *terrible* anymore
"minnabody" is a favorite of mine
they routinely come up with some really good ones
kawaiikochans is a fucking blessing
~~topical shitposting is allowed by the rules~~




haha, well meme'd friend
time to post the newest episode of my favorite webcomic
oh shit speaking of evangelion
so it's ok
but so does the rest of the plot
she shows up out of nowhere with no relevance for anything in the franchise's history
the new waifu they introduced for the movie was okay, I guess

parting the sea of children
the best character in valvrave was moses
the problem of being famous and having a big breakout show like madoka is you get a lot of trash roles that pay you good money
A lot of talent was in valvrave
aoi is in a lot of mediocre things
I run old school
*Kamen Rider Dragon Knight*
Do you mean
I remember people loved double when it aired
haven't watched it in like 7 years
invite me and I'll do my best to be there
big o
<@456226577798135808> thanks for reminding me how good the art direction was
yeah I was going to say, that and big o dates you
unexpected power move
and outlaw star
holy shit checking off zoids
and one is a manga that won't get animated until like 2025
about half I would conditionally recommend
I think probably 4 of these I wouldn't recommend
~~I only consider one line on this chart to be free from shitposting~~
here is my 80% true 20% shitpost bingo chart
F/SN Is still a fantastic VN even if the franchise and setting has devolved into meaningless anime glop
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Eyebrows though
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
it sounds like every other TM Revolution opening they've done since like gundam seed
my problem with the opening is
it's by code geass' scenario writer
it has interesting mechanical designs but no other reason to want to watch it
valvrave
there is no call or reason to be fair to the show over this topic
that sentence should never be started with "to be fair"
You give me a rape scene and then the girl falls for him mid rape and there's not much you can do to get me to keep watching
the designs were okay aside from unit 1 having fucking haken browning's gun and treating it like a military design
I don't think I missed much
I dropped it shortly after episode 8's rape scene
_dives in front and shoves Alice's hand away from the kickban button_
It's no longer about a *thing*, it's now about "Excuse #6 to use heroic spirits"
That's fair, but the media and franchise has gotten *enormously* unfocused
though Nono's ultimate motivations are fantastic
Not so much Nono as everyone around her
but from a character perspective, I think Diebuster easily outdoes gunbuster
it's a tough call
even if the plot gets really excellently dumb later it's not worth the slog to get there
danball senki W is really bad though
amazingly tight for like 60 eps
and the pacing is tight
the plot is more bullshit and I liked the characters more
I think it's a better show if you remove gundam references from being "important"
danball senki I will actually throw down and say I liked it better than gundam build fighters
SD OVA is absolutely a shitpost even though they're pretty good
I hit shuffle and my half-shitposty list kind of just did its thing
I didn't intentionally line it up
I think if I was to actually make a "best" list I'd only include ~~s1~~
4 seasons certainly is
ideon gets a *gigantic* cameo
ESPECIALLY since you've seen ideon
you're deep enough in anime fandom to appreciate it
you should watch shirobako
which is the non-shitpost bingo I mentioned earlier
top right bottom left
two seasons of 13, iirc
26
like wakfu
make a not-anime anime
and I say that as someone whose city *has* a hockey team
hockey isn't exactly a popular sport anywhere but canada
Ngnl is one of the few half decent isekais
just read it twice
I've still never watched it
but I think it's *totally worth watching for the fucking movie*
I think gup is kind of an average show with below average production quality
I mean "this would only happen with anime tanks"
by "the last few episodes have good battles"
and *WOO* the fuckin movie is anime bullshit of the highest caliber
the last few episodes have good battles
~~it's the truth, don't hate me~~
and the girls are just kind of eh
most of it is dull if you're not a tank fanatic
because yeah
I didn't like gup the show that much
also means sky
sora is a name
it's probably a school sport in canada
you live in canada
american football is probably mildly popular because american anything is mildly popular
those are both school sports
it's literal insanity
my favorite re-use footage episode is that one of SDF Macross where the MC has a fever dream after being shot down
have character development or new plot bits in recap episodes
I've seen shows that do that
<:oof:475001968075735062>
unplanned "I GUESS WE'LL BLAB ABOUT TANKS FOR 20 MINUTES WHILE PASTING OLD FOOTAGE ON THE SCREEN" is not
if they know what they're doing with their time+money budgets, that's quality
planning them can be considered good production
yeah planned recaps can be fine or even great
LMAO it was satelight
who did basquash
christ
since their 1-cour anime had to have *two recap* episodes
they ran out of timeslots
from the rest of the series
as a reminder, episodes 11-12 aired like 6 months later
another bandaid on the fucked production
the fight they completely skipped over in the series
italian school
maybe
huh I could actually probably watch today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buL2jy6jW5s
and I think of this
you tell me "tomorrow anime"
they're on the gup movie I thiiiiiiiiink?
nevermind
oh no there they are
exceptional for an isekai
this one gets a point for not having titties in it at all though
aoi yuuki is in a lot of bad shows
go with that
less bad
FMA is uh
please find like, any word besides trap for this server, it's discouraged as some users find it offensive with sufficient reasoning behind it
he doesn't fit the normal formula because *he's written as a human being* and tsunderes aren't humans, they're media creations
quick to anger and sucks shit at showing his feelings to the person he actually likes
I COULD EASILY ARGUE OTHERWISE
the best tsundere rie ever did was alphonse
the age of rie kugimiya in general
<#377148557796442134>
*especially for a show that I'm on episode 2 of*
Especially for a show that might get a group watch soon
This is not the place to chat anime spoilers and shit
Guys
Uh
Symphogear MARS
Nah give us an actual word
I need to watch it at some point
Girls last tour, the post apoc dabbing anime
I hate the genre except when it does something very special and ephemeral like girls last tour
Actually let me amend that
I have so little patience for the cute girls doing cute things genre
It's not a cut and dry thing of "you should always include them" or even usually include them but I think there are cases that excluding them forces the translation to be either really awkward or just miss the detail
They don't matter all the time or even in every show but you are straight up discarding information sometimes by excluding them
They can be a way to signify relationships and more importantly changing relationships
Yorin honorifics matter
God what a hot mess GuP was
~~honestly it's skippable~~
Whether it is or isn't, the art on the box sure was
not an nsfw channel
ok now that we've all seen it
I think we took the spear but decided the beast mode was a poor fit
I remember 2.0 coming out, we had to decide whether to update the fanproject with stuff like beast mode and thunder spear
god I feel old
I think they predate 2.0
wasn't there an asuka one too?
<@456226577798135808> my favorite was the clear silicon onaholes with the tunnel in the shape of one of the girls and it comes filled with LCL like liquid
Yes
I spent 5 years on an eva fan project, there are no rhetorical questions <:AngerDess:448761344104333312>
Rei emits an anti-at field which cancels the barriers between souls and has every one return to a collective consciousness soup of LCL so probably her unless the titan has more bullshit 

Also she's about 100 times taller
And then by August you'll be disappointed <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
if they're not gay, they're so far into heterosexual life partnerness that it's all the same shit anyway
but NanoFate feels pretty solid
Like I am *all for* not just jumping for yuri ships because they're yuri
in As and Strikers it's solidly "friends" level of interaction
Anyway I feel like Nanoha And Yuuno is reasonable enough and is probably what they wanted in s1 but it *really* doesn't feel like it turned out that way
'sok
Lindy Harloawn is the admiral in s1 and As
she took her adoptive mother's name
that's not marriage
and sleeps in nanoha's fucking bed
she just adopts kids
I've seen half of strikers and it never comes up
What, is that a late season plot relevation?
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crunchyroll-html5/ihegfgnkffeibpmnajnoiemkcmlbmhmi?hl=en 
supports such revolutionary features like *being able to move the slider to 00:00*
do you use chrome
you should be using the html5 player if you're not
oh a playback error
they used to have a really crack tl team but as they grew bigger I guess they got lax
crunchy has a lot of errors
because that *sounds* like you're assuming I'm not thinking on your level
to a significant degree
I actually find that insulting
excuse me
in a meaningful fashion
They might be invested for other reasons but they will not be worried that the characters will lose
If you're afraid to pull punches in one area, you'll usually see them pulled elsewhere in media
but lasting negative consequences
It usually extends to not just death
but it usually goes beyond that
Oh, of course
I am generalizing, but I think there's useful lessons to be gained from it
It's fine to tell those stories, but when characters emerge from crazy shit just fine, the audience will assume their plot armor will hold
It goes from a nail biter to a popcorn scene
the audience is going to be less invested in the tension and risk
I think when a series goes on long enough that character death is obviously not on the table
And, as a side note
it's only in what side arcs you're trying to pull off that the difference matters
Note that, narratively, there is no functional difference between killing a character and beating them up until they don't fight again
and in the format of heroic stories, like magical girls or shounens, knocking off the lieutenants is a way to grant victories without actually threatening the plot
character death is a perfectly acceptable plot device, you just have to make sure it's not used cheaply
and thus, there's no easy targets to kill off or seriously harm
Nanoha's usual problem is that it tries to make everyone relateable
and it works in the story's favor
every advantage the protagonists pull off is tiny, incremental, and rarely relevant until later and few if any of them feel like victories
I think looking at FMA's structure is a good example, though I won't go into any spoilers
antagonists should frequently be removed enough from the viewer that their setbacks should not be defining
I disagree
*ehhhhhhhhhhhhh*
*ehhhhhh*
ehhh
or else the antagonists don't get a master plan
The protagonists should get only minor victories until the end of the plot
unless you're going really episodic
it's good structure
yeah the last part of the sentence confused me
<a:explosionfast:393591063660724244>
<a:explosion:393591063308402689>
the most typical isekai start
I think he was even run over by a truck
someone back me up on this
I'm trying to claim that yuyuhakusho is an isekai for a really stupid argument
they're just on record as having created the Tome of the Night Sky
I don't think it's even established that it was belkans who made it dark
I mean hayate kicks ass at long range bombardments but that's because she's using spells from all styles
it's what it's worst at
belkan magic isn't big on lasers though
looks more magical
~~I still think it looks better as Velka~~
I hope it will be as good as such excellent mobige adaptations like granblue
.ass files are what you've probably used for years, buried inside .mkvs
hard to generate new fans
it aged kind of badly
~~yes they are, of the PSP games~~
~~they're cooler than anything else in nanoha~~
I'm glad we get more formula suits
there's some aquatic balls though
not in official canon
get out zeon scum
highly experimental and them trying to mass produce it was a plot point relevant to who ended up winning the war
balls were in the era where beam weaponry was really rare
but they're never perfectly recoilless
though it's a recoilless cannon
(off-center gun)
ball is the most realistic mecha design even if it's still awful

also it gets fans who are inclined to be military otaku to buy your merch
because again, writing
And sometimes you don't want the robot to have every weapon at its disposal at the same time
Also having hand-based weaponry is very good from a writing point of view because it doesn't lock you down to the mech having only what it was last retooled with at the last maintenance
robots are hero avatars and that's really what it boils down to
and if there is, there's no reason to be bipedal
there's no legitimate reason to put legs on them in the first place
there are solutions, but really
or ammunition supplies
Self-contained power supplies
Hot swapping
it is
I still don't get why they don't wear skirts
though the first shot of vividred was the sun rising between a girl's spats-covered crotch
vividred was blatant but strike witches is just really in your face about it
I vaguely care about index III
the show got really fun when they started to ditch it
They stuck to 'realism' too long
but there's some fun stuff at the end
just... kind of not great storytelling and character development
yeah I felt like the show was a borderline waste of time before then tbh
`Episode 11 is where the show gets sexy`
It looks like the concept would get old since it's so episodic
<:chew:297576731194425355>
<:joje:260286061803077656>

which has a very good movie but your mileage on the TV show may vary
girls und panzer
Which is about making an anime movie
Oh my god I forgot there's a shirobako movie in the works
but that's only like 8 episodes
re:zero's first two arcs are great
and they fix that up in the second season
The only one I felt like got a fair shake was Ami from Danball Senki
girl characters in proxy battlers get *shit* on
I thought we were talking about LWA
Oh, for negima
We don't know what you've seen, don't act like I've failed a quiz
what do you mean too late
read it, if anything
don't watch negima
which uh
aside arguably from negima
which is like, the only magical school anime I even know of
do they do that in LWA
makes you feel like you're reconnecting with humanity
WHOLESOME GODDAMN SHOW
SAKURA QUEST
~~shirobako~~
I've never liked the yuyushiki faces in screencaps
Symphogear is similar to other stuff Funi picked up like Aquarion
I could see it
`yeet`
oh god not strike witches
My weekly schedule flexes so much I generally give up on trying to plug into big group things unless it happens by coincidence
I'm employed
Tanks is a good time but today isn't
good luck mein friend
should be fixed
it was 50 and it had not previously gone through
kamimashita
ararararagi-san
The original
Have I mentioned here my co-worker was a senior audio technician on MMPR
But I've only seen clips, not watch the show
I notice it very much and don't agree <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
Yeah both sentai and KR are getting more ridiculous and toylike henshin devices as time goes on and power rangers can't do a ton about it
cyber formula is great yeah
the visor looks sweet as hell
not have Destroy Mode, actually
preferably just
I really like Unicorn's design and wish Destroy Mode was better looking
Unicorn is actually very not colored like most gundams
because
surprised you're commenting on the mobile suit being colored like gundams
Though I'm uh
Don't be mad at Unicorn being traditional when it's explicitly made to revisit a bunch of plotpoints of UC
it's only Gundam that's choked by it
It breaks them all over the place and all the time
I feel that the fictional versions glorifying it helps prevent the real world system from getting better
You're not going to find me very fond of pop artists either
Sometimes a difference of degree is a critical one
Most popular musicians aren't all bound in contracts stipulating what their persona has to be and that they're forbidden to date
And they spin it in goofy ways but it always boils down to that
Being turned into merchandise
The problem I have is more these girls are so passionate about uh
Go for it! My tastes are not law
Like I *might* do Delta one day
I'd be more up for crack idol stuff than playing it straight
Granted AKB0048 dug in the terrifying part a little more sharply than most do but it was eye opening
The way they idealize a really screwed up culture terrifies me
I've only watched one idol anime but it was enough to convince me I didn't want to watch any more
I could care less about fanfare
There's a reason about 70% of all mechas since has stolen aspects of it
Holds up rather well
But the original, or the movie version of it
Most gundams are not great shows
Hell he kills off most of the leadership of *his own side* he's got so much of his own ideals and scheming going on
Char was *very* much more than just someone for Amuro to bounce off of
But to use *the*robot rival character
I agree that rivals can be badly written
In general terms
Just like the robots are avatars of the pilots, the primary protagonist and rival are avatars of the concept behind the primary conflict of the series
They're frequently mouthpieces of clashing ideals
The red baron was notorious for a reason
Also aces do exist that almost never get shot down
Or there is no story to tell
Because people are immune to death until they can tell their story
They're somewhat exclusive when you tell war stories
Do you want realism or do you want good writing
They're standins
And they're not, but red shirts aren't actually human characters
Things that disable an arm or whatever are fine
This is only for killing shots
They can be ordered to shoot and it still feels random, lame, and dull
Or it's *still random faceless fire*
You're going to develop them first to make it interesting
More to the point: if you're going to make someone shoot someone important down
It's a waste of the viewer's time
It's boring
It's garbage
I've seen it happen
Also complain as much as you like about tension, it sucks *hard* when any named character goes down to random fire
~~because there's generally only one robot~~
Supers never have this problem
Also if it bugs you that much stop watching real robot shows
On either side
Nobody else on the battlefield is actually competent
and finally, 3) Maybe they'll flip
2) any appearance after that is fair game, because the rival needs upgrades too
1) you don't know if the thing they were defending or attacking will be successfully defended or attacked
Like they *probably* won't get shot down in their first appearance, *but*
They're not unbeatable and it's usually not a binary win/loss thing when they're in play
so it's a moot point
if they were portrayed realistically they wouldn't be climbing into a robot
it's the pilots that have rivalries
Rival robots don't feel like much of a constant thing to me
and they're usually more monster of the week
Honestly, a 'rival robot' is usually the dark version of the super in that genre
a super robot show...
not without upgrades
not without upgrades
a real robot show shouldn't have more than two fights against the same pilot in the same robot
it depends highly on the genre
evangelion legitimizes it as mecha, get off my dick
Anyway sentais and ultraman and metal heroes are generally all mecha or mecha-adjacent shows that are also toku
literally
Sailor moon is toku
yeah
Yuusha shows are *pretty* in-line with toku on a lot of fronts
but you animeify a toku series and you stick mechanical bits on and you've certainly got a mecha
Not all mecha shows are representative of toku
there isn't a difference
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
Stuff like that happens a lot in focus episodes where they try to develop a specific side character
But secondary characters, yes
Generally not by a mook
If that's all you want it happens a lot
It's also not uncommon
They're just a shot down ace
If they're not, they're not rivals
Rivals are central characters in mecha shows
They just kill off the main villain without warning and a lot of people got pissed
Where they did exactly that
Have you not noticed people's reactions to TLJ
Uh
Because that is disrespecting the viewer and their time
It shouldn't be just a lesson of humility to the viewer
The fact they were in the show should matter
The character's death better matter
If you take the time to develop a character
Not quite
Are you familiar with the concept of chekov's gun
And I do not have unlimited time to watch
Then they wasted my time
If they intended to waste my time
I disagree, because it usually means someone had to throw storyboards in the trash
Aborted arcs are *the worst* offense
But generally they're tied to story arcs
yeah fair
Giant robots are usually just an excuse for a man to become a bigger man
it plays in very heavily with the same aspects giant robot shows do with their fights
It is why I dropped in "mecha-adjacent" though
I mean l, the shows are glorifying an abusive career, being unrealistic is arguably the problem
Anyway akb doesn't intentionally show it but they have this really bizarre subplot how your soul has to resonate with a past member and then you throw away your name and identity to become them while you're in the group and I feel that's surprisingly self introspective about how the girls are merchandise first
It's like revisionist history but in real time
It does for me to not feel ill watching it
AKB48 is the most famous real life idol group and 0048 is the sci fi anime based on them
AKB0048
Granted akb does it by accident
Do any other idol shows properly highlight how fucked up the concept of idol groups are
Though I should rewatch akb
Ew
So if you're in it for tokenism, yay
Also it seemed like this episode is the only time it'll ever come up
I heard it was filled with transphobic stuff but stuck the landing okay
Gainax and Trigger have made some of my favorite animated content and I don't mind being excited about their efforts
Good animation and good budgets aren't the same thing
Good animation and heavy callbacks to people's beloved genres
glopping aside there's just too much author power fantasy and not understanding tension going on
but *they were bad*
maybe they're better now
the problem with SAO is that the writer was bad
just to force kirito into a genderbend
I'm still eternally mad about creating a world where no one chooses what they look like in an mmo
SAO made too many screwups in the first two seasons for me to give a shit what Alicization might try to do
not great protag qualities
also he has no real interesting flaws and he's just amazingly good at everything
not putting him in danger
the problem with kirito as a protagonist is the author keeps
don't you love advertising anime
Please no
It's a huge shame there's no good animated Fate route because UBW especially rode a lot on going off the rails of a normal grail war and you have to see what a normal one is like first
<:papikaPout:241350709021376512>
I am not included in `y'all`
I wasn't there

yeah flip flappers might be a good fit
I only mention it because you listed philosophical

<:15min:453039155975553035>
Honestly you put them together and it becomes obvious that they're pretty different
arguably only the animation was really memorable there
hare hare yukai was an infamous ED which lay down a stain on anime fandom that took a good 7 or 10 years to fade
dancouga had burning love which was a goddamn banger
Nichijou had Zzz which is fantastic
eureka seven had a few solid ones
they're pretty uncommon
never expect good EDs
comparison of x/y dub and sub
https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5rqvpt
that said subbed is a fine choice
it's an attempt to be saturday morning cartoon goofy, instead of just "let's adapt this but take the exciting yelling out" that it later turns into
4kids is probably more enjoyable than the rest of the dub
because they swap the music and destroy the shounen-type tempo
very bad once the anime starts trying hard
dubbed gets
also dub vegeta is more vegeta than the original
sub is never going to be universally better
honestly as long as she's still voicing goku
Considering girls have worshipped him from about 2005 I believe it
*lots* of accusations of predatory behavior at cons
Major English dub va
the elevator conversations is what I find even worse
the forced kissing is nothing
hope he goes to flipping burgers or something
may he never find work again
good
rip
does this mean more creepy gross stuff that ruined the later parts of it
Qualified as art in my book
Devilman probably deserves it tbh
It'll be replaced by some other garbage harem genre though
Every genre booms and then quiets
Audiences will get tired of it someday
They are usually commissioned by the publisher as giant ads
Manga adaptation anime actually cares less about bluray sales
The only isekai I enjoyed was re:zero and it turned crap halfway through
The inflation of moe anime is matched by the inflation of anime as a whole
I think we get around the same amount of stuff with substance every year
I suggest watching plus if you're in it for combat
It was interrogation that was needlessly sexualized
SAO type
Rape scenes
From that perspective alone you have to admit there is a case to be made that "she did something wrong"
Homura removed Madoka's agency
it's basically just, uh
X is boring
anyway yeah, Federation does economic strangulation and suppression of rights, Zeon gasses millions of people and does colony drops
Unicorn is one of the ridiculous retcons that makes them comic book villains
just selfish in a imperialist way
Yeah but they weren't comically evil until later
they were still kind of shitty even in MSG
MSG-era federation was *okay* but have been retconned to shit into being vile
there's pretty much no good guys in gundam yeah
haha
I've sat around on mecha fandom boards enough to know that people who really like celebrating zeon can bleed over into uh, other stuff
and "sieg zeon" was the stand-in for "heil hitler"
don't really like celebrating zeon
with the real world resurgance of neo-nazism as a thing, I just
Okay so you're aware that zeon's basically space nazis right
man she reminds me of fasalina
Dub asuka is the biggest asuka fan in the world
üç°
It remains the most gundam production, I feel
Probably the three movies for the original series
not how good
Interesting fact is that the actual intention of the bright slap was really to depict how bad a commander Bright was since he was so inexperienced
AHMURO, I OHDAH YOU TO LAUNCH GUN-DAMN
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zXQYsYwmxo
original series is a trip
lmao
s2 was uhhhhhhhhh yeah
00 s1 was really good until the end
after that it was probably... MSG, Zeta, CCA, 00, Victory?
but then I watched G on toonami and it was good
(I rewatched it later as an adult, I was right)
I think my first series was Wing which I didn't watch all of because I thought it was stupid as hell
G Gundam is really fun and Domon is my #2 Ace in SRW T
but it's just... not well done in the end
actually early SEED is kind of a cool reboot of the original MSG
but the model sales from it saved the franchise
SEED's pretty shit
X also killed the gundam franchise until Gundam SEED revived it
X was cancelled halfway through, they had to wrap everything up earlier than scheduled
bad as in unsatisfying
making it even worse paced with a bad ending
badly paced and it was cut short
I don't remember actually
Don't set visual expectations too high is all
It's full cg, from the 00s
Hold onto that beautiful thought until you watch it
And short
It's bad imo
I am not looking forward to that
Kind of, but the character arcs and conflicts are pretty unrelated
Crossbone is only tangentially related to f91
War in the pocket is probably the only gundam show I think is a good anime, not just a good mecha anime
I mean gundam and well written women are oxymorons
Especially ZZ
Just read summaries
I mean you can
Zeta is probably the best series in terms of writing but I wouldn't ask someone to watch it casually
apparently
yeah
Happy 40th birthday, gundam üéÜ
and then lawful/chaotic has two, sometimes contradictory, meanings
I have a lot of problems with classic D&D alignment because good and evil are cosmic forces that are not and cannot be subjective
Sometimes they even have good motivations with an end justifies the means ideology
Lawful evil is generally the place the most interesting villains end up
Particularly since humanity isn't likely to see the heat death of the universe
the fact it saves everyone else is secondary to the incubators
For a self-serving purpose, even
His methods are undeniably evil and exploitive of an entire species
it implies you're doing evil acts, and acts are evil or good independent of motivation
Evil doesn't imply malevolence in Gygaxian alignment
Lawful evil
It's a stupid show but that's *kind of the point* of a space spaghetti western with robots
I've rewatched gun x sword and appreciate it a lot more now - I was too new to anime on the first watch to really appreciate how campy it was
it would have been good 10 years ago
Keanu's kind of too old to do spike now
I don't object

ushiyama is one of the only like, actual trans women I've ever seen in anime
I'll never look at Jotaro the same way
WOW
USHIYAMA SENSEI WAS VOICED BY DAISUKE ONO
WAIT
old retired mexican megazord
rewatching gun x sword, I forgot how fun and bizarre some of the early episodes were
some people boycott it
season 2 is uhhh
kemono friends yes

This probably should have been moved to <#336297840529899522> and I'm sorry for not moving my response there <:laugheline:454887887847030814>
Do you believe everyone should get to make their own minds up on how to deal with this with the complete information of what happened?

It's not something that made very big news when it happened unless you were already deep in certain circles or religiously follow anime news sites. It's not something that pops up when you google ruroni kenshin or samurai x. At this point, people are only going to know about it if people bring it up.

I agree that people can be toxic and do stuff that *actually* impacts other people's ability to choose for themselves to enjoy media or not. I don't think that someone saying "hey I don't like this because the dude's a scumlord and I hope he doesn't profit" ruins *anything* for you. 

Because toxicity exists on the other end, too. Behavior that tries to mute people raising awareness about bad people, behavior that tries to kick crimes and harm under the rug because it's *distasteful*? That's toxic, too. That's enabling of abusers, that's what lets people *come back* into fame without ever actually changing.
it's a decision everyone can and should make for themselves, how this kind of thing impacts their enjoyment of media
I've never once said "you shouldn't like it"/"don't like it"
It's tainted for me and I consider child exploitation a big enough deal for me personally that it does make me want it to not do well, yes
you're the one who attacked me for hoping it doesn't do well
Did I say you couldn't like it?
He's also, may I remind you, dead, and the discussions about supporting him and his content are different because he cannot benefit from them
And it caught up with him before and after death
It's not a true divestment
do you think their finances are seperate?
I'm sorry, you just said his wife is, though
*does he get richer by this movie being made*
are they divorced
If he has no ties, tell me
*he got off light*
Especially considering
constant shaming for pedophilia is a cross I'm willing to bear
the news about the mangaka's arrest really bothered me
I hope it doesn't do well
I think I dropped it after 2 or 3 episodes because I just couldn't handle the inconsistent framerate
but the story is interesting
and it's stylistically difficult to swallow
(not only is it the author's style, but it's actually canon in-setting that huge groups of people look like each other)
add into that that there's *massive* cases of sameface
maybe they improved it through BD releases but the full 3dCG is both really jarring and low framerate a lot
it's a little difficult
I tried watching some eps
uhh
I really need to read more of it
I'm relatively astounded that anyone brings up BRS in context of anime

anime about anime

The Funniest Valentine
and a grandkid
Funnier Valentine
funny valentine has a kid
also I was just reminded that in the dumb jorge joestar novel
constraining for everything you write in the future
it's dumb in a way that it's
it's still dumb
yes
Like the ending narratively is fine, but that bit is a bit eyerolling
"his superpower is ||winning|| üôÉ "
It's like a 6 year old designed a superpower
Idk how anyone can think GER is an amazing ending
we're not talking about jorge are we
it's not until next part that you see a real disaster
it ends *okay*
all in all
but
the backhalf of 5 is not something I'm fond of
I don't like GER and I don't really like King Crimson
a lot of 4 I don't find very special but the climax is just the best in the series
which is easily my favorite part
and you get stuff like the finland scene
80% of combat in the movie
and so that's just
and they discovered that it was actually way more fun than actual tactics
The memey shit felt like it only came near the end
right, but k-on wasn't trying to sell itself on being about literal combat
I prefer stuff like High School Fleet over it, where at least there's a moderate layer of intrigue and plot to chain events together rather than almost having a k-on feeling of girls sitting around and doing fuck-all
even if you don't really like GuP it's worth struggling through to get to the movie
that said I have been on record as saying
I don't know if it'll ever get a remake
The recap episodes are so boring they're easily skippable (and even labelled X.5 in most releases), and the off-screen fight got an OVA
and couldn't air the final two episodes for at least 3-4 months, yeah
and because of that they ran out of airtime
there were 2 recap episodes
because it's less animation
and yeah, production issues so bad that they just outright have a fight off-screen so they can spend the rest of the episode talking about upgrades
and nothing but
the series is literally a tournament arc
there wasn't any tangible plot really at all
I think what I struggled with for the GuP series itself was
the movie is one of the best anime films I've ever seen
I kinda liked the series, had problems with it
<:yayakaStare:292520684326748161>
üôÇ
it's in the name
isekai quartet counts as 4
and every season
the protagonist is some super built dude who is kind of known to be a crier
also want to throw in another fotns reference in jojo part 1
PSG's dub is pretty good yeah
there's an english word "evangelical" or "evangelism" which is pronounced similarly
it actually makes sense
evaynjelon
https://twitter.com/RebelTaxi/status/1142652633968250881
but, yes
I like the extra tantalizing bits it had for the pointless conversation of whether it's really a remake or not
3.0 doesn't get that luxury
I think there's something to be said about EoE on an artistic level, somewhere
the series as a whole obviously is wrapped up in baggage, but I'd certainly say there was more than just the op and memes
The Ramiel fight and the Dance Like You Want To Win come to mind
also evangelion had a lot of single episodes that were just kind of really good independantly of everything else?
that movie was fucking rad as hell
I don't know who you are that you can't find 2.22 enjoyable on some level
man
Really enjoying this revival of a bunch of classic evangelion memes
the dub also feels awkward and they didn't bother to buy the rights to fly me to the moon
<:chew:297576731194425355>
I miss duwang
Just it ends up feeling like a waste of time because nothing big happens for 90% of it
3 does look really good
Yeah I wouldn't have made it that long for sure
I think stardust crusaders is close to the worst part
But if we're going on their own I'd rate lwa ova 2 or tv below luluco
I mean you did but also you said on their own which removes franxx
But not now
I think it was fair to call trigger indie back when they released the original lwa ova
~~that easily goes to franxx~~
How could someone say luluco is the worst trigger show wow
did not know how to feel
I ran across someone calling Eureka 7 an "old classic" the other day

oh
14 and 6
https://nyaa.si/?f=0&c=0_0&q=nanoha+vivid&s=seeders&o=desc
and that character development happens more within a chunk than between them?
but anyway it ends up feeling like it's kind of seperated into chunks?
maybe 4-8 eps
and each volume, understandably, has a self-contained arc of some sort
where they cover about a volume every 4 episodes
I don't know, they have this *format* I don't particularly like
also LNs have a more uh
LNs are the worst at it
yeah
The way a show concludes is fairly important to me and while I can still like it if it fumbles it, it's a lot of points docked
I'm really much more hopeful when it comes to original projects, though, by no means does that mean they'll be good
I've grown really kind of distasteful of adaptations at this point because almost all of them suffer from stuff like sequel baiting or incomplete storylines these days
<:MikuLewd:391808764816261122>
I wonder if someone has made a similar channel but without a western (or eastern) bias
I've watched a few of those lately
but I do understand how it's not very conventional
I love the mechanical design - I'm less a fan of the action direction, though, where they prevent anything from being seen clearly
I'm enjoying granbelm so far


actually relevant in movie 3/4
which is
they have the power of money
even though they have basically no relevance to the plot or story
because it assumes you actually care about these other characters who *were actually more important than nanoha*
why Nanoha s1 drags its ass so much
This is, incidentally
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
you forgot the mafia storylines
PA Works doesn't do flashy
they're probably going full blast on the shirobako movie

Changing avatars generally isn't a conversation piece
They're made to be as big as the Zentradi so they can fight them on equal terms
where the planes transform into robots *with the express purpose* of getting to be as large as the enemies they're fighting
in fact, it's even more obvious in SDF Macross
*they are superpowers*
even as purely machine
But my point is
exists
*song magic*
literal
I mean
But mecha as a genre focuses on the fact that the robot is a tool for them to act on a bigger stage
Sometimes the pilots have superpowers independent of the machine, and sometimes they just can use their superpowers better than anyone else
(even if that superpower is just to be 60 feet tall and shoot beam lasers)
(ps, in-setting they can be purely military machines, that doesn't change that it's treated as the main character's superpower machine)
It's still all about the pilot, they just now have superpowers to interact on a larger battlefield
wearing a suit that makes you a superhero
it's like
At the end of the day, they are not purely military machines in *any* anime I am aware of, the hero's unit is always a vehicle for him/her to be a player on a stage he couldn't play on before
The robots are vehicles to expand the character's agency
Here's the single core shared concept
But
Gundam redefined it and then Evangelion gave a whole new subgenre
I've spent a long time wondering what the fuck mecha is a as an anime genre because over time it has *grown*
okay like
HELLO HI MY NAME IS MELUA AND WELCOME TO MY TED TALK ON "THEMES OF MECHA"
```there's a large disconnect in it for me, where the pilot has some "SPECIAL QUALITY" that for some reason makes him innately better in an equally matched mecha, or maybe he's the key to unlocking some ability in it, or something like that, but at the end of the day, its just a dude sitting in a cockpit
its like the dude actually inside is a placeholder
There's a lot of emphasis put on the pilot that just doesn't make sense to me```
the mook of the week
they'd just be
they wouldn't be a rival
then
...?
you can build Char a gundam in Ghiren's Greed if you're Zeon and the Side 3 attack goes differently
I mean
quarter of the show simply because he read more of the manual than anyone else
oh
Amuro piloted the gundam for the first
"this could have been you, you could have fallen into this cockpit"
using a rando gives a connection to the audience
I don't know if it's an asspull or if it's a story framing device to get the audience invested
it does help establish that personal touch
Actually one of my favorite subgenres of mecha is intelligent mecha, where pilots only can pilot if the mecha likes them
yeah, that's fair
I'm just explaining the emphasis on the pilot
it all comes down to taste
I'm not saying you have to like it
I mean
basically gundam/macross are war stories and the fact that the protagonist *isn't* specially attuned to be in the cockpit is part of the appeal - it's a kid who picked up a rifle and is involved in WW2, in the original 0079
I'm really thinking you might like super robots instead as a rule?
Okay, Zana, like
yeah
Gundam's *usually* pretty mediocre
Also, going to level with you
but if you're the most logical person to use it at any time, it's yours
you don't *own* it
I mean
it becomes yours
I disagree, I think if you perfect the use of something
familiarity with the craft
more attuned skillset
The same reason some aircraft pilots are just better than others
that's why
They generally use it best
Sure
It becomes *their* robot, even if they didn't build it
This helps build a personal factor
the protagonist pilots a prototype or unique unit or even just a unique paint scheme
*generally* in mecha anime
You've just discovered why hero robots exist
but it's still the gundam that gives him the superpowers needed to fight on the battlefield
Amuro Ray is a fucking psychic even out of the robot
yeah, but that's not really my point
I don't think he did
Did Thor build his own hammer?
Let's see, uhhh
but *it's not really Iron Man* without Tony Stark, not in the same way
Iron man can do anything with any pilot
Iron Man
I think a good analog would be
Hm
a literal supersize superpower
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWvfvsxYNbg
and that is one of them
for several reasons
Kira Yamato is nicknamed Jesus Yamato
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
guess who gets drafted to pilot it
someone builds a robot that runs partially on emotion
so
because the pilots are all fucking military *rejects* in this war against the aliens that keep getting disciplined for being too aggressive
I think my favorite "military" setting is actually dancouga's
that's fair
yeah no
Also a lot of military research does go into making their stuff easier to use, and a lot of robots have some level of mind/machine interface
flew stunt planes
Hikaru from Macross, for example
Most decent "real" robots try to keep an element of plausibility of why the protag can do it
Hm
and power fantasies aren't inherently bad but that might be why you're not into it
Anyway yeah <@220201140141162496> the whole "protagonist is just better at piloting" is mostly just a power fantasy for the audience
And welcoming and a few other things
Shirabe also has a few moderation tools that are invisible
and midseason upgrades generally come with character growth
Rivals are generally pretty much always a growth tool - they're generally what shoots down the hero unit and forces a mid season upgrade
Oh then I've seen it once or twice yeah
Aquarion Evol
which I have seen happen!
Unless you're talking about defeating them at the halfway mark of the series or so
they'd fail to meet the definition of rival
it'd never be *established*
It's not even that there'd be no point
SEED was a neat idea on how to reboot 0079
Destiny was a disaster
almost okay
SEED was
it's more obvious here
it's Hirai
and it's obvious
look again and compare
It really works in Majestic Prince

Comes with Time to Come
Also
I was ready to let it go to my backline when the time came and I love the design
It only has 3 attacks and gains a fourth so it's not like it doesn't get old
Well, fine
And it's good therr
You will be using it early game
But it works
You're doing a disservice by not using other units
Barely
It's viable
Tyranado isn't the most broken unit (that would probably go to Selena's upgrade in alpha 3) but it's very capable
And the main cast *owns*
And yeah Tyranado could be better but I really like it
Gespenst is borderline trash but it's really pretty
Z1 was good
Also Z series is what started to kill the franchise
T was good and the lesbian main cast made it better
God bless Z for starting us with X Divider
Dreams is okay but I prefer resolution, judging mostly on srw bgm quality
Shirou does very little that's innovative or clever - he has a thing he is good at, so he does it
that's criminal
*holy shit*
it is more hype
I still think that Danball Senki s1 is better than Build Fighters, *if* you don't count gundam fanservice
and is massively underrated
Danball Senki s1 was first
I spent years being pissy at Gunpla Fighters because like
but you also have shows like Rahxephon (this is a remake of Raideen couched in Evangelion aesthetics) or Aquarion
<@238855496797257729> the #1 biggest Eva clone is Fafner

OH
look
CCA is very pretty but is a fucking awful story
I didn't
no
romeo and juliet in the vietnam war
08th is
0083 is *definitely* a bad story wrapped in pretty animation
everything else is some variety of bad story wrapped up in pretty animation
<@173112001684439040> if you wanna dive into it I'm game - Most Gundam's pretty trite and trying to ride the success of older shows - the Gundam shows worth a shit are, pretty much in order, 0080 War in the Pocket, the original series (movie trilogy version), Zeta Gundam, and G - though G's got horrid animation and pacing
anyway yeah FA Girls wasn't bad because of CG
hi my name is jared I'm 19 and I never fucking learned how to read
and it's just absolutely hilarious
*airdropping toys onto a flying missile equipped with thousands of tiny nuclear warheads*
The CG toys actually works out when you have scenes like
anyway point is
5 ways
in like
FA Girls was bad
because they're literally toys
I felt the CG works better
CELLPHONES WITH SPEEDLINES
*those action cellphone shots*
but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlphWIDGPAI anyway this is from the much worse second season
after that, I think it's dubai
granada
I told you
and it's *hilarious*
you see them hammering on their cellphones
is when they cut away in the action to people
any way the absolute best part of danball senki
at least part of it is
this is the main menu of the original game, I think?
I mean
it builds
6 parts

full thing is worth a listen

gimme a sec
damn you want a hype ost
full disclosure I have bought the Soul of Chogokin GGG though
I used to do SD models but eh
I don't bother
It's okay to like robots and to not do gunpla
the point of the whole MSG - Zeta storyline is you're not really supposed to cheer for anyone on a national level because everyone's a bag of dicks
like I don't want to be rude but space nazis are space nazis
yeah, no, fuck off
and it always makes me squirm
It's the point where you start to become aware that some people like Zeon *because* they're fascists?
it's just
Like there's still nuance
really heavy on glorifying zeon
episodes 4-6 kind of go
Igloo is both sad and jingoistic at the same time and it's just ugh
the only GGG to my heart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aYyYq5uGbc
who also liked GGG
I had to cut ties with someone who meant a lot in my life
~~I gave it away~~
IT WAS 300
YEAH NO
I'm sure my message got across
it's fine
If your joke involves making someone feel like shit, it's not acceptable
You're accountable for your jokes as much as you are for your serious statements
Making a "joke" on this server doesn't make you not responsible for respecting other people
going to make an official statement here
but
Okay you've said that before
"you're a shitbag (but still cool)" isn't okay
<@238855496797257729> please apologize for that comment it's way over the line
want to drop one of theirs
Zeon wanted to drop a colony but they didn't uh
Anyway Ayamine:
and that later iterations of UC have made it worse and worse as a retcon
I'm claiming it's just kind of passively bad
I'm not claiming federation is good?
Zeon
the only people who poisoned colonies before was
That was the federation *after* zeon
They were dicks but in a normal, human, and not conspiracy way
It's more like
Unicorn makes up the whole "Zeon had the right to freedom the whole time and Fed kept it a secret"  thing
That's the literal plot of Unicorn
they were *retconned* to be just outright wrong and horrible and manipulative rather than the slow clutch of a mother nation strangling her colonists
Feddies were kind of dicks but it's important to realize that meta-universe, the writers made the Federation *retroactively* worse in order to make Zeon fans feel better
I want to pause on the "federation is terrible" bit and explore that
Though
yes
They are very much meant to be Germany of WW2 in all the best and worst ways
Zeon casually commits atrocities with the belief that they have a righteous fight and the secondary belief that they're the chosen race of humanity with the capacity for Newtypes, making their lives more valuable than people of earth
that sounds almost as bad as GATE
it's basically harem male power fantasy trip, except amplified, generally speaking
Was crossbone ghost ever fully tled
The manga for Astray implies heavily that Lowe's ai helper is based off the rx-78-2 learning computer

I've heard lots of people discuss it's possible relationship to turn a
I don't mind
~~i need to watch it~~
most shows that succeed in the west are either shounen or gritty
part of it is it is a "magical girl show"
oh ok
some of us pay 12 or whatever a month to crunchy and the studio gets like 30 cents
we don't buy merch
we don't buy discs
how would the west contribute to a show's success
but I feel like this is <#337805317276565525>  at this point
did not deserve
it
which
RDR2 did win best music
and they seemed blown away when I told them awards don't mean jack shit compared to, you know, making money
I had some fools tell me the other day that X game *had* to be released earlier than holiday season because otherwise it'd miss the game awards
it works for the game awards
because they went super hard on promotion
did crunchy help produce dr stone or something
I was in it for the fact it was a parody
I ended up dropping it because it was *too* detailed
The manga was *over*animated to my taste
Like
it'd have caught on
the premise of OPM is hilarious enough
honestly yeah
they're seeing it for the first time
aren't comparing it against the source media
Going to blow your mind here that most people who watch adaptations
looks like dogshit
highly successful
Kemono Friends s1
okay
like
Sometimes it's character design, sometimes it's plot, sometimes it's the big twist in episode 4
absolutely nothing
nothing
What single element makes something popular?
It has a correlation but not a causation to popularity
quality of animation is not the factor that decides whether something is beloved or not
I assure you
As someone who watches a lot of older anime
Elitists can have interesting things to say - I still tune into digibro because I find his insight into anime production interesting, but I don't let him decide what's fun
are elitists
too
it's possible that they
I've seen variants of it a lot
rather than basically whining about it
I suggest you work on it
Armados you have a serious struggle with accepting that people like things you find bad
less interested in vinland saga
that shot makes me
I was interested in vinland saga
I mean
<:Smugoi:453038925259210753>
there was only one good anime and it was Neon Genesis Evangelion
also it's not a harem ln
vinland saga's quite a bit below arifureita even
you might have fucked up
when your own goddamn cast under contract threatens to quit
look
and then it moves on
10 pages
source material has endless eight in like
kyoani
~~endless eight~~
permanently
you can still fuck up
I mean even for "autowatch" franchises
you've grasped that art isn't the part of an adaptation that's critical
congrats
yeah
good art wouldn't save it
though arifureita also looks like trash, it's the art and story direction that are really killing it
look at arifureita
the most critical things about an adaptation aren't art related at all imo
Also I'd argue a lower time budget doesn't mean a worse adaptation per se
Higher detail doesn't mean higher artistic value
requires more effort doesn't mean a better result though
one has more lines, therefore it's better
it becomes a normal shounen
and then
OPM starts out as a joke about "what if we just broke power scaling in a shounen"
it has to do with moving away from the reason people started watching
it has nothing to do with *adaptation quality*
I've literally been reading reviews
like
no
because people weren't in it for the animation
yeah, which is why OPM s2 isn't popular
(seriously don't give me a chapter that covers 3 seconds of real time)
I don't think so? especially since cgi is starting to look not trash
from about 2002 to about 2007 is, in my opinion, the worst looking anime since the early 1970s, overall
Digital animation being new and looking like shit
and B)
that was smack dab in the middle of A) KyoAni being deep into a really bad design trend, especially in their Key adaptations
because yeah
we talking haruhi?
4 if they felt like rubbing in how annoying the loop was
it had a point but they could have succinctly in 3
one every week
and they aired in a row
aired what was basically the same episode 8 times - and it was 8/16 of the season 2 episodes
s2 of haruhi
soooo much goodwill was burned
but
Disappearance was able to salvage some of it
it basically destroyed haruhi as a franchise
It was absolutely huge
it's worse than a hiatus because you know they could have been animating *something else*
you're going to have your time wasted
*knowing*
and knowing
than watching the show's airtime roll around every week
a different experience
I think that watching it post-release is
director randomly making them slightly change intonation in vague ways
same script
same lines
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
they got tired of being made to rerecord the episode every time
rather than making an enjoyable product
I'm not saying it had zero value from an auteur perspective but it really seemed like something they did for the benefit of *their* satisfaction as creators
"EXCELLENT, THEY'LL LOVE IT"
"yes"
"okay so they'll be watching the same episode for... [checks notes] 2 months?"
really though it seems like a terrible move from a hype management direction
I hope so
it looked like it *fit*
'wrong' isn't the right word
and that was what, '13?
I think Majestic Prince was the first time I saw CGI used in anime (outside of Evangelion 2.0 which doesn't count because it's a movie with *all* the moneys) that didn't look wrong
interesting
D) Are market trends changing and hinting that they might do better now than when originally aired?
C) Is it the studio's passion project that they're willing to eat a small loss on to make?
B) Does it have secondary merchandise beyond BDs that are doing well?
A) Is it an adaptation, that funding another season would serve to further advertise/promote the source material?
There's a few factors at play here
Depends
just that calling a character by an archetype name isn't an automatic tell
I'm not claiming goblin slayer isn't generic, mind you
but it's definitely not generic
maoyuu uses titles instead of names
incredible show
about making an anime movie
it's going to be an anime movie
it's incredible and the shirobako movie is basically my #2 most anticipated anime project after XV
it is one of the probably 5 best anime made in the last decade but it's only going to resonate with certain kinds of people
you probably should
speaking of which, Ayamine, if you find this stuff interesting, and you haven't watched shirobako
these discussions always make me want to rewatch shirobako
(that'd be this one)

different
that's
this is an amazing thread

This sounds like a mangaka going "oh my God I have a good idea, I wish I had this at the start, better put it in now anyway"
they're very pretty
The problem is that "proper conventional fantasy" has nothing inherently compelling
you weren't paying attention to goblin slayer
if you think "not isekai, but regular fantasy" will somehow make a work good and not full of the same harem boring bullshit
tell me that's not an isekai plot
```In the book, a Yankee engineer from Connecticut named Hank Morgan receives a severe blow to the head and is somehow transported in time and space to England during the reign of King Arthur. After some initial confusion and his capture by one of Arthur's knights, Hank realizes that he is actually in the past, and he uses his knowledge to make people believe that he is a powerful magician. ```
Mark Twain was truly ahead of his time
actually, reviewing yankee in king arthur's court, it really, really feels like a modern isekai minus the harem
People want to read LNs, they scratch itches people have
and LNs just copy other LNs
the problem is that it's LN trash
the problem isn't that it's isekai
and that isekai exists because it *tries to spice it up* - and it isn't a horrible idea, isekais have been media since the Wizard of Oz and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court
at least the first story
SAO is a proper isekai
but it is totally responsible singlehandedly for the boom
it obviously didn't *invent* it
I actually don't think it's totally inappropriate to say it's the father
not specifically japanese nationalism there, though
even stuff like GuP has some lowkey elements
I feel like most military fetish works are pro-nationalist on some level, trying to think of counter examples
Anyway gate's not terrible, the premise is cute, the anime's pretty tame in terms of "JAPANESE MIGHT CAN DEAL WITH ANY THREAT"
context is important and the dude who wrote it is ex jsdf
but it wasn't?
I mean sure, it could have been any army
the girls are nice enough, but you really can't get away from that point
It's nationalistic masturbation
GATE <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
which ones don't? aside from stuff like magical girl raising project
~~pretty sure both of these predate 3~~

JRA please stop
good people fighting for a bad side doesn't make it ambivilent
I'd argue while there's no right side in gundam there's quite a few wrong ones
the mechanical designs make sense too, kawamori probably did them himself
so much makes sense now, including the fumbled end of the second season
it was a fucking kawamori work
oh my god, it wasn't just satelight
with the whole "being a member subsumes your identity beneath that of an original member's" thing
AKB0048 also unintentionally has a really intense window into how fucked idol culture is
but it's still fun and I'd love an XDU crossover if AKB0048 wasn't a dead property
that said gear's the better show in basically every category
it's great.
yes.
and if that sounds dumb
the entire plot of akb0048 is a group of idols perform guerilla concerts on planets where entertainment is banned
in gear, while themes of harmony and understanding tie into songs, they're kind of tied on top
part of the plot
akb0048 does have an edge over gear in that music's actually
though I mean, it's kinda cheating by using one of the most successful idol groups of all time's best sellers
as a final note, AKB0048 is one of the extremely few anime that can maybe claim to outdo symphogear musically
it's a decent "lmao this is dumb as hell" anime
it has elements of it, but every time you get settled in, someone's arm turns into a machine gun or something
It's not your typical idol show
~~I'd also actually like AKB0048 s3 to try to actually pick up some of the dropped plotlines~~
Shirobako
Monster is good not because the anime is good but because the manga was *so good* that any best-effort attempt would have worked

<@!279341087494242304> magic knight rayearth made it into SRW
Wait isn't Pluto getting animated
I mean you say that but I'd kill for Billy Bat or Pluto done similar
dnangel
and also causing a sinkhole as its massive gravitational field pulls your house into the center of the earth
but the graphical swarm is handled differently internally
I mean it plays the same
I remember listening to director's commentary in enter the matrix and they were all talking about how they had to make the Sentinel chase sequence at the end different on the ps2 because it couldn't handle the swarm even though the other two systems could just fine
yeah, that's right
er
480i
made for interlaced video on blurry CRTs
honestly I feel like a lot of it is just ps2 image processing
and attacks are practically ripped frame by frame from the show
SRW's moving to where it's almost *too* close to the show and it's losing a little bit of the charm of seeing how they adapt attacks to fit the game
I like HD sprites less, usually
gonna be real
honestly
I think the pixelated art is part of the charm
but she uses her Nanoha voice for Kouryu
wouldn't have known they were the same person
that's neat
oh, so is Anryu
~~it just hit me Kouryu's voiced by Nanoha~~
she's also with Kouryu's sister Anryu, the dark one with a missile rack attachment
https://youtu.be/PJ39nE0A4cg?t=43
and that's 4/8
I love Goldion Crusher with all my heart but the middle 4 episodes are pretty shit
FINAL sucked even if it had great moments
She could have been really cool in FINAL but she was mostly just thrown in for weird bondage scenes or something
she did appear in attacks
I don't think she ever had her own unit but I could be wrong
Renais Shishioh
OH
no robot, no armor, nothing
and Master Asia is *just a dude*
though usually only for a mission or two
but also both Guy Shishioh and Master Asia have appeared as on-foot units
are you thinking of one of the iczer units in L ayamine
everything
tekkaman blade in W just had it on like
depending on how easily ignore size is to get
small units are either incredibly good or really kind of shit
And *yeah* Tekkaman Blade was broken in W and incredibly good in J
Yeah
like Tekkaman Blade
We've *had* power-armor sized people before
Rayearth opens up other considerations, maybe symphogear...?
We now have Yamato 2199, Harlock, and Bebop
but they've really started branching out
It was formally a little off-genre to SRW
because <:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
could be ok
5 manga adaptations
jesus
also I thought maoyuu ended ages ago
regarding ruroni kenshin
charged with possession of child pornography and paid a 200,000 yen fine for it
like, the movie is one of the best for-fun anime films ever made
but 110% worth watching to get to the movie
I'd argue the TV series is kind of eh
the movie is a must-watch though
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
GuP was so poorly produced it has 2 unplanned recap episodes in a 1 cour anime
skip every anime episode labelled .5
also
if you are, you'll love all of it
but they're totally worth it
because the real anime shit isn't until the end of the TV series/movies
I highly advise you struggle through parts you find slow
If you're not a military fetishist and you want wacky anime hijinks
hm
it's
if you're a military otaku yukari will be your manufactured waifu of choice though
student council president is the best character
the last two eps of TV are probably worth it too
I promise movie is worth it
struggle through TV
Get victory units and make it not out of place
That saved Gundam
And
The 5 suits thing is how seed happened I think
wargame players are toxic
or other wargames
also, you know, girls aren't completely fucked over by other enthusiasts in gunpla like they are in 40k
a dollar a frame
siege of berlin
odessa represents germany getting resource screwed and slowly getting pushed back because of it
even the way the OYW unfolds is ww2
it seems like it can happen again because it happened once
gundam is just ww2 in space
oh well yes
which aren't
aside from robots
igloo is very grim yes
it's okay.
I love guntanks
the guntank episode was the best part of igloo 2
<:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
it's not igloo guntank because igloo 2 *actually has a federation guntank*
no, this is
also that's not igloo guntank
hildorf has gotten a few kits
??
I was first aware of the 1/35 around 2008
the 1/35 or Sentinel as a series
ryu never even knew <:KiriCry:442974585831292928>
rip ALICE
to fit the gatlings, physically
that's why S has a fat head
it's the only time he ever sat down and was like "okay where do the components *go*"
it's Katoki's greatest work
Sentinel is always underloved
the lowest price I ever saw was about 2500 usd
I have stared longingly at this motherfucker for about 13 years now

1/35 ex-s
we talking about large kits?
Odessa is when Zeon lost the war
it would have turned things around, but only if it was before Odessa
don't u talk shit about my baby RB-79 <:cagmurder:580135748788027393>
long-range in gundam isn't really a big deal anyway because minovsky
and the GMs had beam spray guns and it's one of the things that clinched the end of the war
"we'll make a shit version"
"ok"
they were like
as a contrast, when the federation managed to come up with one technology that definitely outclassed zeon but was too expensive/difficult to do right (beam rifle)
all sorts of issues
and they have
Igloo is about a prototype testing unit though
Not shown in series, but that's partly because they're the antagonists and their prototypes are also the monsters of the week
(though by a baoa qu they were also running out of pilots ala Japan)
but zeon needed numbers, not quality
gelgoog was high performance but also difficult to make
partly due to internal competition (gyan), the gelgoog just failed to be ready in time and so they resort to the ridiculous strategy of trying to refit the dom to be spaceworthy
some of zeon's desperation on their prototypes starts catching up late in the series, too
they did also have mermaid gundam, supposedly, but diving too deep into MSVs makes everything ridiculous
better to have 100 shermans than 1 tiger
Zeon's prototypes were one of the the things that lost them the war
again, Zeon's based on the same principle
is they spent too much of their limited resources on prototypes, some of which were highly effective, but of which they couldn't ever mass produce due to complications and the fact they weren't designed for easy production
one reason germany lost ww2
<@87512939107450880> fun fact
eureka 7 op 3
so anyone left was stranded
yeah, odessa marks where Zeon was officially kicked off earth
obviously the war still raged, but it was the biggest turning point
anyway the colonies were running out of resources to run their war machine through a war of attrition and they were dependent on the launch base in odessa to siphon natural resources from earth
odessa was the thing in asia where the feds attacked and Amuro shot down a nuke
jaburo was the aquatic attack on south america's feddie base
pretty sure they're relevant in billy bat because every conspiracy theory has relevance in billy bat
no
unless wiki is lying to me
literally the same day
yes
~~I'm not a fan of sengoku works~~
thought it was post- 2010
oh that was 09
sengoku basara was the apex
yeah
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobunaga_the_Fool
we had that bad project I think by kawamori
there was a boom early 2010s
what's the most underrated show?
and as Tim Curry once said, villains are vastly more fun to play and are usually better written to boot
typecasting is a bitch
He refused every single gundam role offer until they let him play a major villain
it was pretty solid
it was only around in the final fight as fanservice to let Setsuna fight Amuro in the RX-78 aka 0 Gundam
at least, I think it had a condenser
and put a condenser in it
and then they rebuild it as R2
Setsuna uses it like that for a few years until it gets fucked in ep 1 of s2
It gets fucked up in the finale of s1, loses some limbs and half the head
R2 is like "people like exia but we hate actually drawing it so we're going to fix that"
they even made Exia look worse aaaaaa
shame 00s2 looked worse than s1
the lightshows were nice
but yes
00s2 was a weird rehash of Zeta except they transitioned into the lamest baddies ever
00 s1 was, for the most part, legitimately good
kinda like 00s2
but it doesn't really justify itself existing
Like, it doesn't ever murder your child or anything
in being bad
also AGE was kind of up there
It's a ton of mediocre shows and a few bad ones
okay, fine
it churns out a lot of 6-7/10 shows
it gets good occasionally but it's usually bad
gundam's been consistently bad most of the time since Zeta ended
because honestly it could probably be fixed
are they remake movies
it's just told like shit
there's probably a good story in there?
like
one of the worst things tomino's ever made
please note it's possible for a story to be enjoyable to someone who is not an incel, and yet still be custom made to fit their needs exactly
Shield hero is an incel fantasy, yeah
where did attack cards start, as a cultural phenomenon? I'm most familiar with them popping up after fancy sword techniques in mecha etc
symphogear
but goddamn good romances are so damn rare these days because of it
you get to appeal to 4-5 times as many tastes as in a more focused work
I get the financial incentive to do harems
if it didn't also develop into a fairly standard harem I might actually be interested
with the whole huge underscored emphasis on "accusations aren't always right!!"
it kind of glances longingly sideways at the concept of rape victim silencing
shield hero is something I can understand something one might not want to have a friendly debate over
extended conversation about spoilers should probably be <#377148557796442134> , for limited mention of spoilers, just use spoiler tags and note what kind of thing you're spoiling
yeah if you're going to be jumping around in that top you might as well be topless
you probably should anyway, considering most of the seasons have changed bits
6 being what it is
I can also see a lot of hype dying with 6
7's not traditionally highly voted in japan
in the west
That's if they even bother with 7
araki is not under a lot of time pressure
the studio is getting close to part 8 in that part 8 might be started on in 2024
yeah, it'll probably be a few years
jojo might get 24
it's Bad in a lot of ways
not going to disagree with that take
you should watch flip flappers
not because they're that similar but
if you enjoy symphogear watch flip flappers
<#336310266654490624>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
there's some heavier stuff later on but I don't think any is super inappropriate?
other staff are important, of course
directors really matter
generally they've proven themselves by being an ED for a few projects
an anime's only going to be as good as the storyboards
with the EDs being next
they're generally the person that singlehandedly contributes the most to it being good or not
Yeah the adaptation has a terrible director
no one else has tried it to my knowledge
but it worked
I mean unless OPM has drama bombs later on he belongs on there as much as Takaya Noriko
<a:thinkspin:393587517196075009>
goku being team hard work
but part of the parody focus is that he is Normal Man who accidentally went Too Hard
like yeah, that's the outcome of the gag
nnnooo, we read different manga
that
which is a gag anime
at least, what OPM was originally
being lucky/gifted would destroy it
Saitama being a normal dude *is the joke*
but
like, let's ignore what OPM has become for a moment
look at it this way
no matter what genos says
his training regimen is actually insane
irl
I mean
"yeah actually nobody tried training before"
I feel like it'd actually be the whole punchline
Is it?
it's hard work and the rest is because **it was never a serious shounen**
like genos isn't impressed because his cybernetics are theoretically way jacked up over what humans should theoretically be able to do
one of the themes of, at least, early OPM is people dismissing hard work because they're gifted
again, no one else has tried it afaik
mob is a much better rounded comedic work imo
OPM isn't really a premise you can do well for years
but of the work
their universe being logically consistent isn't a function of the character
they all have had *some break somewhere* beyond hard work
then every character on the hard work list does not deserve to be there
I mean, if this is what it means to you to be "lucky"
is that narrative consistency isn't always maintained
and that's the distinction between gag and non-gag
it's a gag anime
because
I think that's just the world's physics being fucked
I don't think that's a breakdown in saitama being lucky though
have you not seen the original?
yes
uh
dragonball had a few serious arcs
yep
Beats the hell out of the Naruto or Pokemon approach though
Also p bad
"their adventures continue" kind of things
Even non-endings
King Gainer is my main pick though for originals
Good anime with bad endings? Like all adaptations
but I felt it worked better as a comedy than shounen
I never really got much hype out of it
first two eps had me on a comedic basis
movie's great though
another show that is alright
I think the last was dc metal?
I don't think any comics have a major event going on right now
you say obviously but
and is as a result, more timeless
DB isn't a shounen
there have been better advancements in the understandings of how to tell a shounen
dbz, even kai, hasn't aged well
there's definitely more hype than dbz
I mean
honestly if they're not an art prude the original gundam movies are some of the best mecha content
yeah
even though it, uh, has problems
also TTGL is kind of a problematic start point because then they'll think TTGL is the greatest thing ever and you'll have to deal with that
the mechanical designs are really really weak
but a good shounen
TTGL is a bad mecha
It runs the gamut of war story to super hero to, well, symphogear
mecha doesn't have a good entry level reccommendation that can be made without considering an individual's specific tastes and nature
not short
it's
As someone who lived through it airing
but you can't claim that Naruto is *short* because you decided to skip most of it
you can argue that you shouldn't watch it
Like
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
because it's part of the show
rakugo has an added difficulty in translation in that the sense of humor just doesn't *exist* in most western cultures
~~eat your hamburgers, apollo~~
obtuse
yeah rakugo is uhhhhh
yes
that's true
yes
I stand by my statement though
fair
so fucking bad
early kyoani
god
I think "MC is the only boy who can pilot these girl only machines" was doomed to be a set-up to a trash show no matter what
Ehh
with bad plots
and we got absolute worst of the worst harem trash in it
There's a huge niche open for wild and crazy mecha powersuit combat
IS angers me so much
nooooo
god I remember when Bleach put that page up that just had AI on it
so
it was a videogame first
but
I liked the ending of Danball Senki (s1)
I haven't watched
it came back for a peek in the early 2010s
it's not
we transitioned into cute moe girls and then into harems and then into isekai harems
yeah
I feel like at this point ecchi needs to be interesting/kinky to be worth the time
rem was factually Good but I agree she got overblown
rem got overrated because she was sympathetic in a show full of people who weren't, I think
actually had decent characters to care about
what if stuff like Re:zero with decent ideas and decent execution
sometimes I wonder like
all gundams have fucking psychic bullshit, but they're all pretty firmly real robot because they're stories about the horrors of war
The themes of the show are more important
actually relevant
magic isn't
like 00
except when it doesn't
but that's a poor division
super robot = powerful, armored tank
where real robot = fast, dodgy, low hp
there's also the SRW definition
seperate universe
it's unrelated
well, I call it s3
they just aired it before s3 started
it's episode 0 of Logos and has nothing to do with it
it's literally the only worthwhile thing to come from Logos' airtime
it's amazing
it exists
Also Ayamine did you see the OVA crossover between s1 and s2
Andy or whatever was good
Mixx was good
but that's the *basic* division
there's some bleedover and grey areas
Real Robot is for machines used for war
yeah, Super Robot is basically a giant superhero
yunoha had the best arc in the show
YES
MY FUCKING HEART
I don't know how you couldn't love GIRL WHO TURNS INVISIBLE WHEN SHY
none of the MCs
just
Both Aquarions (no one gives a shit about Logos) had amazing casts
super robot refers to specific ideas, mostly in how the mecha isn't treated as a realistic gritty machine that can break down/used for profit and warfare
giant robot is catch-all
Evol has *PROBLEMS* but the first half of the season was one of the absolute best mecha shows I've ever watched
but it's good super robot content
I can't say you should
I mean
actually
a lot
I still talk about Aquarion
If you told someone in 2004 traditional superhero movies would be the biggest cultural franchise (short of pokemon) no one would believe you
super robots could too
if marvel can suddenly be relevant again
but I disagree
I mean, super isn't the same as giant
but s1 was fucking ugly
not because it looks particularly beautiful
Zwei must have had triple the budget
HUGE
it's
rewatch them both
yeah
hahaha oh my god
Gravion redone by the people who did Gravion Zwei would have been nice
Godannar's pretty solid, has good drama, has one of the best final episodes I've ever seen
but gender/sexuality was *central* to godannar's theme
I mean, a lot of shows do
it tried
but
I feel like it uses a primitive understanding of gender and queer theory
Godannar hasn't aged perfectly
Rand's route was incredible
Z had you miss out so hard with that
it makes it fucking boring
bunches all the gundam into one route
I hate when srw does that
tbh it was one of the only redeeming series on Setsuko's route
Gravion was one of the reasons SRW Z rocked
I like them ~~though gravion s1 is some ugly ass shit holy cow~~
hell yeah
while a real robot is army vs army
In a super robot show, there's usually only one or two robots on the "good" side
Real robots are giant soldiers fighting a typically very human war
Super robot is a giant, superhero-type avatar for the pilot/pilot crew
and is more a thematic description of the tones and messages of the series
Anyway yeah, real/super is less of what the robot is capable of, honestly
I didn't even know nickelback sung about anything that wasn't photographs
not by choice
just with technology that's theoretically possible
Gunbuster itself? Super robot
Like, the RX-7s are real robot stuff to an extent Gundam never reaches
Gunbuster is a super robot but in a quasi-hard scifi way
does this make sense
Evangelions are a real robot take on super robots
most super robots are actually robots
but to say he has done nothing wrong is signing off on what he did
Griffith's worldview is one you can argue has some merit
it's kind of too spicy for my tastes
so
I mean, "X Did nothing wrong" is literally a meme made famous by nazis/people pretending to be nazis
üò¨
he's off model more than he's on model
watch Eiji's infiltration in the first episode and such
also every moment the mech is on screen they tried harder than usual
much better
the movie is uh
it's not a comedy series but it has some great gags
MJP is really good
if you want comedy in your mecha though
yeah
too bad it doesn't have an ending
Nadesico is really good at being comedy/parody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EHmbrK8KZI also the opening sounds like it was done by a garage band
it's a pretty good comedy mecha
the pilots are also office workers
rips off one of the robot's arms to throw it at the enemy
and
the main pilot bemoans the lack of a rocket punch
Dai-guard is such a piece of shit that it doesn't have much in ranged weaponry and when it needs to attack a flying enemy
anyway
captain earth is very much super robot
super robot
it ends up being the only effective weapon against an invader though
rather than a giant robot
things that have strategic value
tanks
<@279341087494242304> jets
which is a super robot made and run by a corporation and is complete garbage but it is the only robot the earth has because no one bothered to make giant robots because they're dumb
dai-guard exists
oh, one final comment I wanted to make about real robot vs super robot
and they let you miss it if you really like Kyosuke or something
Earth Cradle was like, the single greatest event map in all of OG
Also I have a small quibble with OG2 in that Moon Cradle was even a pickable route
scenerio design was *built around* you buying it
you had to buy it
You were expected to buy it
SP Regen
OG1/2/Gaiden had a severe problem with a little thing called
I call the GBA one OG2
PS3
OGs 2nd was pretty good too
yeah
Alpha 3 is the only reason I hesitate when saying Z1 was the best srw made
the instrumental was good for the final boss though
literally some of JAM's *best ever* work
and then into this
GONG
Skill
Like, SRW OPs had been
but it was such a low point?
hated isn't the right word
well
Honestly I hated crest of Z's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ckstMuIEkM
ever
D's heats is the single best iteration of the song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6gphiAMFEE
it's so good
let me get you the chiptune version
oh my god
~~Ruri is usually slightly better due to her IFS ability~~
you can swap who the main pilot is and have their cutin
yes
not the best warship SRW's ever had but it's probably the 4th best
and take no damage
in some games it can solo maps
The Nadesico itself, on the other hand
the units themselves are usually pretty weak, but they get access to squad attacks that cost a lot of EN but are pretty effective
basically, they have unlimited EN (what you'd usually consider MP) as long as they're within like 5 tiles of the Nadesico
Nadesico units are usually pretty fun in SRW due to how the Gravity Wave Antenna works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAGJWBAFg8c
there's a eurobeat mix of let's go gekiganger featured in a para para game
Getter
he just wants to be a cook ok
hack every enemy on the map
Nadesico-C owns in SRW T though
but it feels like character assassination
the movie isn't horrible in its own right
it's nothing like the series
presumably the events of that day changed his goals and daily routine
he wasn't ripped
you can always be pre-zwei wing gen
oh no
also works with Bad Dragon to promote their new line of products, Knot Punisher
that might have been earlier
also SRX finally gets to combine again freely and fire the HTB Cannon after that I think?
earth is this huge brawl with the machine children, Ouka, execs from the School, and Wodan Ymir's big finale
moon is I think you fight some inspectors and get Weissritter back or something
at one point you split your crew in half to go earth or moon
but it was GBA
I mean, it was
no, this wasn't the PS2 version
Earth Cradle had like 7 bosses in it, the conclusion of like 5 character arcs, and like, *in the middle of this*, Zengar and Wodan's duel has them drop through the fucking ceiling to hash it out
no, I mean following him on route splits
if you decide you cannot bear with the TV series
SDF also has a movie version
it's average but it's nice enough
same way most mecha is good
it's "good"
well
really, really unrelated
it's good it's just
I'd personally suggest skipping II and coming back to it if you decide you really like planes that are also robots
which is (Macross II if you feel like it, it's non-canon because Kawamori was salty he wasn't part of the project) > Plus > 7 > Zero > Frontier > Delta
after that I'd kind of suggest production order
36 eps
you'll see the same 4-6 scenes
a lot of the space fights?
I'm exaggerating a little with "most" but like
the same fight
to the point that most of the mecha fights are uh
a *lot* of canned footage
but it looks like garbage
SDF Macross is actually one of the better mecha shows from a storytelling point of view
How are you with older media?
hm
I usually hear heartcatch thrown around as a good entry point because it does some neat things
including the fact that the different seasons aren't all that related
they're basically the girl version of power rangers
it's designed so that any given crop of newly growing up kids can get into it
you're not wrong but it's also not designed to be consumed like that
saying it's 700 episodes is kinda like saying survivor is hundreds of episodes long
GaoGaiGar spent more than half of its run in monster of the week format, but still exploded from time to time into climax arcs
and it's a lot more character driven in the meantime
they're just, by nature, slower burns that you pick up pieces slowly along the way
a lot of motw anime have perfectly fine stories
Anime industry has changed so much in 10-15 years
Like a third of that list is new seasons of old stuff
o7
this is the best thing to come out of Delta
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3nfweteZck
weird
you gotta save and upload
for gifs you can't right click copy image
that's also basically everything I know about Delta tbh
GIRI GIRI AIIIIIIIIIII
Robotech had to dub the line "I'm going to get on my magic space bicycle" just to figure out how to make the episode useable
it's a character having a fever dream
SDF Macross has the absolute best clip show episode I've ever seen because it's *batshit*
also, for what it's worth
DYRL has been described as the in-universe fictionalization of the SDF Macross events
much prettier, though
and things aren't... exactly the same
but Do You Remember Love has a different director than the series
still ridiculous
it's 15 robots not 25
oh sorry
it's the forgotten part
I mean that Dairugger lasted more in memory than Vehicle Voltron did
there's like a 25 unit combination mecha
but only because *holy shit those combinations*
Dairugger's a little different
yeah Voltron is more successful as Voltron than it was as GoLion
they're literally more remembered in japan for being part of robotech than they are for existing at this point
not a huge loss
so
Southern Cross and Mospeada weren't good
but
Southern Cross and Mospeada got butchered to link up with Macross though
but that's really it
Protoculture got redefined into an energy source and a little bit of the ending was changed
the Macross segment of Robotech made it through almost completely intact
<@468591607332208641> I've always been amused by Macross fans getting so mad at robotech for the plot changes (getting mad at harmony gold for licensing blockading is different)
nanoha didn't even learn anything from her motws half the time
yeah if you've made it through nanoha you'll be fine with motw shows that are actually good
anything
K-On is the defining entry and while they certainly do music, they spend most of their screentime not really doing
one of the defining traits of the subgenre is that they spend most of their time doing nothing in particular
<:chiakiyawn:531257779948748820>
but then you'd have to watch index
misaka pulling giraffe neck there
interesting
that's
like, worse than the ones with straight up boring composition?
worst kamen rider?
okay I can see not liking it but
<:yayakaSmile:284164860428812289>
trueblade with the Good Taste with the flipflap suggestion
I prefer my drama to have slight slice of life rather than my slice of life have drama
sounds like two contenders for Cast's AOTS
<a:thinkspin:393587517196075009>
I mean
*the fuck was that*
10 episodes
then I hit the final like
I was having a good time with J-decker
OH MY GOD J-DECKER
Diebuster is better, ~~but diebuster is the apex of emotional mecha storytelling so that's a given~~
hell
GL's good but there are better
who thought this was good
literally an entire episode about the cast falling asleep
the ending I'm fine with, it's the rest of the package that's... ugh
and the story sucks
but it was not done well
there is good in Final
like
I think most people who have had some time to think about it and aren't just mindless TTGL fanatics do
FINAL is really shitty in a lot of ways but you should still watch it and then decide whether or not to think about it when you think of GGG
Gaogaigar for example
but like
I tend to advocate for watching the whole thing unless a season's just really boring
I've heard s2 went south
I think it's underneath Fafner
it's been on my list for years
it feels like the easy way out of the dilemma *from a writing perspective*
it lacks catharsis
hmm
it feels
Poly's fine and all but as a resolution to a 2 cour love triangle
the poly ending of frontier <:llennDisappointed:432399986630590474>
I know it's not really that good but I really enjoy it
Aquarion s1 is a guilty pleasure
goddamn bad
and then the rest is just
are probably some of the absolute best mecha content I've ever seen
first half (plus maybe a few episodes) of evol
lemme just say though
oh
you got the best experience
to the point I got bored when it was time for main character melodrama
kinda like aquarion it's an okay story hidden behind 3 bad main characters
~~there's a name you hear dropped once every other year at most~~
to the point I was entertained when I heard he got fired from Basquash
and then Kawamori burned more goodwill with Evol
irritated me so goddamn much
Frontier just
I should watch delta but
all the permanent seperations
talking about high school graduation is kind of a freebie to do that
but really
I don't even remember the details of Crescendo, just that it destroyed me
all the non actiony ones were either reaally fetishy or really just kind of vanilla and sweet (Crescendo is underrated)
definitely a bad undertone to that
there is
basically all of the actiony ones had powerful female characters and yet were still rapey
I mean
basically all VNs that featured action back then were rapey
looking back
Tsukihime had some content that isn't really okay
but yeah
I mean, he had the tables turned on him on the far side routes
but some of it is hilarious
maybe
I mean
lmao
her route fucking hurt me
Ciel is actually one of my favorite VN characters ever
;_;
HISUI
such an idea would be absurd and a joke
there wasn't
which
deen/stay night was an *okay* shot at giving it an anime when there's no way it could ever get more than a single anime
if you like absolutely nutty plots in your mecha you should watch danball senki
because unlike the ||AI thing|| there was *nothing* the whole rest of the show to set up for that
||mostly just the universal space cop thing||
but goddamn that was from left fucking field
it was good
So whether it had plot is immaterial <:KirikaDess:535188438547169280>
Aliens went home or something
As I understand it the AL anime is post game plot
Which aren't going to be small
We have a 26k number but that's before canceled preorders
Symphogear's sales aren't knowable at all  <@102691114762371072>
NGNL maybe
oh
what other large isekai's out there
With kancolle's waning limelight I could see it in production limbo
dorothy or whatever was really fun every time she showed up
emilia was okay
rem is best
yeah, the time cycle mechanic was entertaining
stopped being what I consider good
it just
rezero overall was never bad
oh, sure
when you hit the part where he regresses it kinda loses its charm
rezero is worth watching half of
in s1, at least
ferris is nice representation but wasn't actually all that interesting as a character
slowly zoom in on their face while they speak a mile a minute
all inner monologues should be animated and voiced like speed racer
<:papikaSmile:284172971059314688>
and papika
True but people with 30 years of experience have been animating for the last 40 years
<@238855496797257729> animation doesn't really get better over time, tech does
We live in a blessed time
Did you know the greatest anime *of all time* happened to start airing 6 months ago?
PS the actual winner of this bracket is demon slayer
Nah, not shounen enough, the protagonists aren't alphas
And it's a bad mecha
The only time they step outside pure shounen is for seinen or mecha
There's no shoujo at all
even if it's not good
SAO is significant
but not jojo?
like, tokyo ghoul?
but because it's the kind of thing I'd expect to find from this group
not because it belongs there
I'm actually really, really, really surprised jojo isn't on there
maybe even 32
FMAB probably deserves a slot on a 64-entry bracket
they put bleach, naruto, one piece, dbz in on legacy power
in the 70 year history of anime
did you know that the greatest anime ever made was made *this year*
did you know that all the greatest anime ever made were shounens or shounen adjacent
oh the actual chart is garbage

<@238855496797257729> cg animators animate without drawing (mostly)
On paper instead of cel
Painting is wayyyy easier now though
I mean aside from cg, it's still hand drawn
I heard alicization was ok
I hated that ending
https://twitter.com/ikuraunicos/status/1181375088727216129
kyoani works and planetes
the only anime works that are actually better than their source material I can think of immediately are uhh
it's not very big
I mean the list of works that you should watch the anime adaptation instead of read the manga is no more than like 15 long
never knew
4C did flashpoint
huh
they just only covered the giant 20 volume flashback period
but if you wanted an anime adaptation of the manga they were there and sufficient
stellar
and yeah they weren't like
a TV series and a series of films
there were two anime before the ugly cg disaster
2016 or whatever was not the first berserk anime
the original berserk anime was good
?
every season of symphogear has background info/further elaboration on concepts show up on a website after every episode
I think innocent and fun is more apt than derpy
"let's try to sell the series to 6 year old kids using a 20 year old art style" doesn't really hold up
I think the sumo art shift's been nothing but a good move, personally
one of his first fights after winning, even
league champion
8 episodes - 2 hours of screentime - and they get to finally go on their first mission
strikers is almost as bad as s1
strikers though
and whether you think the movie has good momentary pacing or not, the entire thing still ends in 2 hours
it's just not very fast
A's pacing isn't awful
might as well get used to it in As
strikers is paced like shit and doesn't look fantastic
well
s2's more relevant to strikers to movie 2 - both because strikers refers to a plot thread missing from the movie, and because
but if you want to go down the full path
if you just want a nanoha experience I'd just say the 4 movies
S1/M1 are absolutely interchangeable outside of character designs though
with how the book works and the whole plotline of the admiral's not touched on
differences
A's has some
I think it's mostly so they don't *have* to leave Strikers open
(in a seperate universe)
nanoha force <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
yo
https://twitter.com/ShaKing807/status/1184509436058054657
gunpla builders was followed up by beginnner G or whatever
yeah except they made a sequel
the build line was bad before build fighters and it went back to being bad after it
hell yeah
oh hey a key visual for the shirobako movie came out in july and no one told me??
I thought kirito was awful in aincrad, but that was more because the writing was bad and his over-capability sabotaged the tension of the story
why would there be a next gen? don't you all have phones?
~~I didn't bother because I don't care enough to check~~
yeah
then I suggest you start looking for income to fund your anime hobby
https://nyaa.si/?f=0&c=0_0&q=cautious+hero
I generally assume it's the default
hoping you will not cancel
many free trials will automatically start charging at the end of the trial
it was a common aesthetic mid 00s

<@279341087494242304> found something at a store
Giri giri aiiii
but with more overtly sexual fetishes
this sounds like twintails
they show up in the movies at least
Rie Tanaka used to be one of the big name vas
is that like my immortal
you can fit 12 episodes of 480p anime on that
120minute dvd rs are about 4.7 gigs
because there's isekai every season
yes you do
setting it 4 years later is really promising
I am so goddamn excited by the shirobako movie
blade liger's one of my favorite hero units in mecha
blade liger <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Tomino is one of those people who is legitimately very important in the industry for what he did but isn't exactly a visionary
deathsaur's mpc, defeated by some metal rods
the manga isn't *too* popular, but no, the anime's the dark sheep of the go nagai family
must have been dirt cheap
japan hates it
what the fuck
god mazinger?
wasn't a very long forever
nice
:/
I have eyes for nothing but shirobako <:BikkiDetermination:524467728925327370>
which is 1983
the earliest isekai I can think of is Aura Battler Dunbine
not so for the one on the left
the one on the right you can pick out of a lineup without being familiar with characters
the irony of this is
spoiler heavy discussion about currently airing anime would be best off in <#377148557796442134>
but power to you if you do
yeah I don't think they're worth money personally
not great adaptations
they're uh
negima animes are not probably not, I don't know the others you didn't mention
the world has a devastating crisis every 3 months
isekaing into symphogear sounds terrible
but I have to ask why you thought *anyone* would be discussing garzey's wing
I believe there's even a few shared characters
I mean, same setting
it honestly has a description that would fit in a modern isekai
```The series followed Sh≈ç Zama, as he suddenly finds himself pulled to the world of Byston Well during a vehicular incident with one of his rivals. Byston Well is located in another dimension located between the sea and the land, and is populated with dragons, castles, knights, and powerful robots known as Aura Battlers. Once Sh≈ç is discovered to possess a very powerful "aura", he is drafted into the Byston Well conflict as the pilot of the lavender-colored Dunbine.```
but for japanese media, dunbine
unless you accept it's just a dream
though yes, alice in wonderland would probably qualify
that's just a final conclusion
skipping it lowers the quality of the narrative
the Fate route builds a foundation
I feel it's obvious
I don't have the patience to explain that three routes that the game *forces* you to play in a specific order are designed to build a coherent picture that one route doesn't tell sufficiently
look
"ok shirou protects the girl :)"
it loses almost all the narrative focus if it's just
Heaven's Feel works *because you see how Shirou's story goes*
they are not three unconnected stories
you *need the arc*
whether or not fate is "boring" isn't the point
being dropped into UBW is straight up inferior - it's a weak route on the most part, and honestly mostly functions because people are aware of what's changing until the final bits
they need to animate the first route properly to have a shot
fate VN is definitely better than any current animated presentation
or even better than the source material
good adaptatiosn are, in fact, substitutes
but it's not a *substitute*
like it's really good and pretty
it doesn't do the VN justice
and most fate fans I've met say it's not
but "is it the best fate experience"
but the discussion is not "is it enjoyable"
which it is
you can claim "it's fine to like it"
I disagree with "that's all that matters"
it's a major point against it if it doesn't tell what he's thinking that well
F/SN is the story of shirou more than it is of the holy grail war
yeah
I mean
you don't get the monologues
no it doesn't really get it across that well
you're claming the fate route isn't needed
if you're claiming the animated versions of Fate are better
precure is basically the "sell more toys" version of sailor moon
E17 had one of the best VN premises and it had one of the best VN final routes
E17 is very good
I don't typically read manga adaptations
I have not read the reflection manga
that combined with the payoff of the adopted mom plot
levi's scene was probably my favorite part of the two movies
which is what
I still love the formula suits
nice
read the manga and caught a few episodes of the adaptation on toonami - enough to know there's like zero deviance from the manga
it is lupin the third yes
it looks so good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ4xhSBY-UY
the rest of the world being exactly as black and careless as she was is what broke me
yeah Chitose wasn't the part I hated the most
couple that with the main character being an aspiring VA who just wants fame but not to work for it
it's that for the whole show
yeah
I couldn't get that far
I've heard there is character growth and maybe that'll make it pay off
this is "haha our industry is broken and driven by ego and greed"
this isn't "haha people can be shit"
it's obviously trying to talk about the real world
because it's not fantasy, it's not supposed to be fantasy
darker, I'd say
one of those things where everyone is awful
It was too cynical for me
hm.
girlish number is.
fuck s-class though
it is bait of the yuri
I have not watched it but I have heard there is at least gay?
gay bears
girls last tour is a thing
flip flappers is a fucking trip and it will keep you guessing for some time
the 8-way battle royale fight from danball senki was fantastic
though one or two other series did have units capable of performing at that level, arguably
joke units from gunpla builders aside, I would only credit one gundam with being super robot
of apoplexia
I think I'd die seeing gundams being summoned to have firepower on par with super robots
8 episodes until the show actually fucking starts
Held off because I didn't think I'd get a Blu-ray player
On BF I think
My order still hasn't shipped because shirobako 2 was on back order
it's why s1 has so much boring shit that is never important and never comes up again, especially regarding her family
triangle heart
yes
The thing about cheer screenings is *you buy the tickets knowing it's a cheer screening*

You can't just decide to go shout at the screen
Yeaaah
Showings in Japan where audience participation is encouraged
Apparently a bunch of people decided to emulate "cheer screenings" for Promare and ruined the experience for quote a few others
https://twitter.com/LowPolyRobot/status/1204849797678686214
rewatched the first episode of mjp, god*damn* does the action still look good
if it's small enough in filesize to be a discord emote yes
o/
**so much** room for animated emotes
we have
they can be added
if you want to put the ones you'd like used here in <#336299268107403274>
if you made them
ayamine for the animated ones
woman, but yes it is!
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> they arrived
having to worry about reverting back, truly is a curse
ye good content
yeah I'd bite for 15 maybe
execution matters way more than being "special," because firm foundations are so rare
I don't think you have to be super innovative to nail a high score
I'd say FMAB was at least a 9
wait now I do
I know about the little girl but don't remember the death
he had nothing but revenge
yeah but he didn't really count
godannar had basically the best epilogue I've ever seen
everyone got a happy end, even the lesbians, I'm pretty sure
I was thinking about the subteams
everyone's in a 2-part combiner unit
the main protagonists are married to each other; the sub teams have *stuff* going on
godannar focused a lot on relationships
I'd have to rewatch it
that might actually be in Godannar
oh that
star driver
gravion I think has one or two? Might be wrong
wait
yeah I think cross ange has them
the booster unit from MJP is like that
uh
I'm trying to recall some but my mind's blanking on some of the important details
there's a few mecha out there with motorcycle inspired controls
quite a few yeah
there's a few good ones
really?
`I never got on the franxx bandwagon cause mechas piloted in doggy position was an instant nope for a Mecha fan like me.`
steak from jake farm
steak from state farm
do nOT THROW **SOULS!!**
aw, shirobako's going to choose to be a christmas present
it was dead around '12
mecha didn't die with franxx
it's definitely the spiritual successor to inferno cop
the non SD one had extra gameplay mechanics I thought were bad
the non-sd one, it sucks
first one
there's two g generation seed games, one is like, nothing but seed - it's also the only G Gen to not be SD
it's a 2d fighting game
you don't want gp03 in battle assault
aside from beam confuse
zeta movies are okay, imo, mostly
only thing I know
rerise has a hot girl robot
oh antag beat me to it in hiero

<@!279341087494242304> december 28th is the birthday of a character we all know and love
hm
oh that was a 2018 publication
apparently the #1 novel of 2019 is "Where the Crawdads Sing"
elf
it's fading back into "not well known"
card captor sakura
wars is... I'd have to actually finish it first.
instead of the 1v1/3v1/3v3s of most of danball s1
so the show is just 85% mowing down swarms of toys
apparently the game W introduced a lot more swarm fights
and the fights were much less cool
W had an excellently stupid plot, but the execution was slow and plodding
anyway more people need to watch s1 of danball
arguable
metabots were not 15 cm high
nah
danball s1 was fucking fire, best shounen anime I've ever seen
yeah build fighters was a ripoff of danball
made some decisive plays using transports full of dummy balloons and space infantry though
I was in a gundam play by post rpg/strategy game once and being federation was fucking hard
are those salamis class
blue haired maid
rem is in more everything
it's really hard to justify liking ram the best when her sister's being so much cooler and sweeter on screen
so
ram's okay but when she starts being relevant is when rem shines brightest
lucky star's humor's a bit dated at this point, but I guess most english viewers didn't even get most of the jokes when it was airing, so
hathaway's flash is bad
touma's power is cool but the story's running too long for it
his attitude is fun but it's like putting seasoning on top of really bland bread
but he's still fucking boring
touma's honestly one of the better LN protagonists
she's definitely badass as hell
I like her but I totally get how she can be uncomfortable
kuroko is very thirsty
beats Ra Cailum
Archangel is still the coolest white-base type ship imo
retell MSG with modern aesthetics, mecha designs, and storytelling ideas (like a rival team rather than just Char)
but SEED started out as an interesting project
okay but pretty fights aren't narratively accomplishing anything
80% of it is just a giant tournament arc
GBF's story isn't very impressive in scope
GBF had a way higher budget and was, honestly, less ambitious
I would have loved to see MSG retold the whole way
honestly I'm sad SEED deviated
doing the same thing twice will do that
he should stick to super robots
though really something about Okawara's designs for SEED don't really work for me
majestic, furled, like a bird ready to take flight
look how ugly and square the profile is with those wings
yuck
mostly it's Strike Freedom's wings when folded and the gold joints/trim
Strike Freedom is ugly but I love Freedom
yeah
No, but I think "if we made freedom again, but fancier, it would make us money" is a completely legit reason kira might not die
or on the shelves
It existed, just not in the show
What makes you think they design the robot the episode they introduce it
...?
no
makes me suspect
Strike Freedom singlehandedly funding Bandai for the next 5 years
Maybe, but
hm.
what, in SEED? I'm not sure I buy it
they made plenty of new ones, but generally it's believed that the director's wife was the major reason that the Three Ship Alliance became the protagonists, *again*, halfway through
My knowledge isn't exhaustive but sure
manga continues this trend
the story continually gets worse yes
Fun selection, be aware it's heavy on sexuality and sex metaphors
GODANNAR
OH
I don't do much light novel slice of life-type stuff
I know like none of these shows
magireco
between lockon's death and the Ptolemaios
I was about to bring that up
YEAH
also Ali al saachez was great in s1 and a joke in s2
s1 was interesting because of just political gears meshing and turning
the highlight
season 1 functioned because the antagonist wasn't
00 s1 shit with Exia and friends are still some of the best looking non-OVA gundam
the Innoveda designs were just kinda... shit... and everything else got "upgrades" that were designed to be cheaper to draw
the biggest disappointment of s2, by far, was the designs
but I really liked the elevator coup part
s2 had a lot of wasted potential and subpar ideas
I just watched the shirobako ovas and the fact that the credits are the musani staff killed me
E7 was the most honest teen romance anime I've ever watched
give me a story about a kid who grows up
I've seen that anime
If Renton started out as some badass kid who fucking cares
that's.. what makes him great
Renton's great
kamille doesn't beat kids
considering the VA is dead and bright gets done *dirty*
I've been wondering what they'll do with bright in hathaway's flash
oh god
it's why Holland is my favorite character of Eureka 7
I'm a sucker for realistically flawed protagonists
I'm pretty annoyed at this, all in all
so
to me the best part of unicorn was that it would mean hathaway's flash was rendered non-canon
And Hathaway hasn't grown more mature since CCA, just edgier
Everyone in it is an idiot
it's a bad story
it might end up looking pretty but
I've read hathaway's flash
ugh
It's got that late-UC weirdness to it
but that's not animated
Also I *really* like Crossbone
my fucking guilty pleasure
~~danball senki~~
Probably the MSG movies or 0080
My favorite is G, but there's a lot of motw episodes that don't stick out
interesting question
after
*A Wakening of the Trailblazer
yeah okay you missed it
the alien invasion
it is a very pretty movie and I'm not really sure there's anything else to say about it
s1 had *something* s2 didn't
some gundam.
It was just
Another reason s2 was just.
s1 didn't fucking pull punches at the end
It might sound extreme but this is literally what it is like on 4chan
I'm really, really not overstating things here
/pol/ exists because people kept trying to talk about genocide etc on other boards and they wanted somewhere to shove it all so it wouldn't be on other boards
everyone on 4chan knows what pol is and it's not lighthearted political discussion
/m/ is mecha, /new/ is news (destroyed for /pol/), /pol/ is the nationalism and racism containment board that is labelled as "politics"
you... start to notice things.
I spent like 4-5 years on /m/ during the rise of /new/ and /pol/
yeah I understand that some might find it a stretch
(0080 goes a lot harder on making zakus reference Germans)
fascist uniforms
but they achieve that by copying a lot of design elements from, well
they are
yeah!
since they are basically giant uniforms
Mobile suits are equatable to uniforms here
since the entire thing functions on pride
Aesthetics are part of getting fascism to be popular
I think part of it is the uniform/suits
and honestly?
I think it's partly being the OG
but no one gets excited about blue cosmos
I mean yeah
genetic purists, even
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I get that it's easy to forget it's emulation and idolization of space nazis but that's what it is
and that people who still proudly shout that phrase in today's world need to ask themselves when jokes stop being funny
I think that's a demand you can't ask of me
zeon fanboys are a little terrifying
and have been for a while
Part of it is I'm a little freaked out by gundam's fascist fanbase
I mean, yes, that's correct
even MSG laid into them as being questionable
there has never been a gundam saying the feds were right
to establish that yes, zeon was legally and morally in the right ~~atrocities aside~~
which is why it's shitty that unicorn goes out of its way
yeah
and the super unicorn vs neo zeong was fucking stupid
I've been salty about laplace's box since before the OVA started coming out
I can't forgive it for the plot detail for trying to double down on "zeon was right all along"
ugh unicorn
and it's just gotten worse from there
and it used to be kinda cool but it got pretty toxic by about 07
a culture
yeah it's
(yes, /a/ does hate itself)
/a/'s very not lgbt friendly
yes
/c/ is cute
that's /co/
the smaller the better
it's a stretch to call /a/ tame but yes
I wasn't bothered by them initially
even if there's a "haha" after it
because this is the same website with /pol/, and not all of them are going to be jokes
you will be if you stick around long enough
the large ones are meme pits that you don't want to participate in if you're any sort of minority, unless you think it's cool and tough of you to throw racist/sexist jokes around because "they don't bother you"
anyway yeah there was about 30 boards when I left and there's probably more by now and generally the small ones are tolerable
music
full of people who are Very Right About Opinions
/mu/ is a hellhole, /tv/ probably is by now too
fit is exercise yes
/fit/ is the "lets pretend we're gay because we're totally not gay right guys? guys?" board
technolo-*gy*
k is guns
g is technology
no
just think that /d/ stands for dickgirls
non-alternative hentai
Alternative hentai*
They're about the same
It's... not
the rules for the things that makes the FBI call them were added in later, after the FBI called moot too many times
there are no rules there except the things that makes the FBI call them
/b/ is random
(and /v/)
stars are where lesbians draw their power from
I actually did like the design of the Destiny ZAKUs even if putting them in felt really out of place and commerical
in general the downslide of the site was from people who came to see people being ironically funny about something and then the new people weren't ironic about it
kekistan might have arguably started as a parody but it really doesn't matter, becuase most of 4chan users are dumb parrots
that's how there's been a lot of dogwhistle stuff like certain pepe memes and kekistan
Being racist or a shitbag in public but without getting caught is about the favorite thing to do on 4chan
Plenty of people are regulars of more than one subboard
that's the major problem I had with it
Just remember that the cages aren't seperated
~~then the show nosedived~~
and that was vol 2
I remember the rem arc finished around like episode 8 or 9
re:zero was usually batting around 4 wasn't it
two chapters of OPM were about 20,30 seconds of the anime
it depends entirely on the artist's storytelling method
bad
comparing manga chapters to light novels is
4-5 typically is what I'm aware of
5 episodes on vol 1 sounds about average?
<:Stop:453038094061666314>
what a show is about ultimately isn't that important, it's just a way to get hooked
if the direction is good, even a boring premise can produce an interesting show
regardless of premise
if the direction sucks it's not going to be a good show
it's not about whether the show's interesting and needs time to get started, it's about whether you can tell it's intelligently directed and produced
one ep's enough if you've watched enough anime
that said I haven't watched so I'm gonna sit this one out
you can still write intelligently for children
people cry for a a fate route because the fate route never got made
it's not a *good* adaptation of the entire novel, but... it's somewhat serviceable
deen/stay night is... not an awful adaptation of the entire novel, but it's not a replacement for a fate route
<a:BlobVore:587092685425344524>
It's so gay it trash talks a genre of yuri for being insufficiently gay
Flip Flappers is extremely gay yes
not in that it's an ending that forbids further adventures
In that it is an ending with a conclusion, yes
imo
"and life continues" can work, but you need *to tie conclusions on* and have things be permanently different rather than returning to a status quo
all I know of gatari is this video, the toothbrush scene, and the two famous openings
https://youtu.be/XOK2SUzP4ek
but you'll see why later
not good disability rep
yuuki yuuna is sadly
this is the project that the symphogear staff got moved to, yes?
It's 1 cour and none of the episodes feel like filler because they're all so unusual
Flip Flappers also fires out a lot of homages everywhere ||and mecha fans will be particularly pleased||
None of it is about selling toys or costumes
It also does a lot to put the "magic" into "magical girl"
There's even an episode dedicated to mocking older shoujo-ai media for not being gay enough
yeah Flip Flap is probably one of the gayest shows I've seen
also much gayer
I'd say it's much better than FLCL and a lot less intentionally obtuse
which in a lot of settings doesn't make sense
And they have a conversation while they're vulnerable
which typically places a higher value on communication and dialogue
*shoujo*
well
most mahou shoujo are
well
oh I think this is the movie which isn't really fair
sailor moon's kinda similar though a little faster
slow and ponderous
it's just kinda
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_pXZGA-ng
most magical girl sequences I know of are actually fairly low-key lightshows with music that's more character theme than hype buildup
Historical record of magical girl anime kinda disagrees
mmmmmmmmmm
` imo magical girl transformations are supposed to be hypy lead-ins to upcoming fights,`
The point is you're talking with a threat with the gun in your pocket rather than drawn
That's not really the point
After large amounts of fan feedback the author retconned it and they're now canonically trans
cute catboy is actually a cute catgirl
no
you're at the point where they decide it's time to regress subaru's character
but yeah
<:laugheline:454887887847030814>
I wasn't aware, anyway
mm
why would I assume that
no
I don't see how they could cut 4 eps of material out of those arcs though
I have no idea
after that YMMV
re:zero's really great through 8 and a little beyond
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrHn9cOG4BE
Hard to say, but they're both very good
The OVAs are really good btw
yes
my favorite key work is their smallest
most of it is incredibly boring so I don't think I recommend it for a recreational read
though I'm no doctrinal expert
it's stated that the power to judge is reserved for Him
actually the former wouldn't be biblical
<:SerenaOhoho:449358389563359234>
https://twitter.com/tukigatathemoon/status/1223217576240545794
obari pose
I don't know, actually
wait
oh
funimation pulled the show entirely
no, they were probably getting it from funimation's services
but the story structure etc I agree
for the anime visuals, most of that boils down to budget, tbh
huh
further making a joke out of this site
it's still airing on 3 networks
okay wow
maybe put new episode revelations in <#377148557796442134> <:AngerDess:535188304165994506>
oh apparently yeah it came out in january
maybe that's the thing you heard?
the studio did declare bankruptcy
Everything I'm seeing is "it's out in spring 2020"
I think you heard wrong?
didn't hear anything about a movie
Haifuri had the OVAs
shirobako *soon*
GuP did something similar except it was a 6 month wait for the final two eps
man this is actas-level shit
Expect Promare to have a flimsy predictable plot but be worth watching anyway
Rising Gundam ended up being one of my favorite units in SRW J
which... transphobic episode aside, wasn't that bad
he did gargantia
urobuchi doesn't only write absolutely depressing stories
I plan to watch it someday
oh is this spoiler talk for yuyuyu
5 years between them
yeah but there was like
busy
Apologies for the slow follow up I have been
unless you can handle 60s animation
I don't think anything else is really worth it
Mazinkaiser OVA's alright
(I saw it in theaters and regretted the tickets)
MAzinger Z Infinity is a good looking shit movie
Shin Mazinger is definitely the best thing to watch
shin mazinger
very good way to consume it
I went into flip flap knowing absolutely nothing about it other than it was supposed to be good
FLIP FLAP
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
this is where re:z got a lot less good for me
*yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah*
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
very missable if you come into anime for the jojos and the MHAs
and yeah, haruhi's nearing 15 years old
your faith in your favorite anime series eroding into dust
your soul dying a little more each week
of the same episode
2 months
https://twitter.com/soniccitrush/status/1230361159305506818
<:papikaSpooky:284174444803522560>
flip flaps
why match lip flaps when you can match
<:gokigenyo:246346856286650369>
less than 5 anime, then
actually technically half my collection's DVD
flip flap's one of the less than 10 anime I've bought bds for
I've had kakusei stuck in my head for like 6 days after watching promare
technically <#652243263117459458> is a spoiler channel for the untranslated shinais
I feel like basically everyone is in the rem camp because no one else in the show fucking tries worth shit
but it's probably not
like I'd almost guess this was a marketing thing
terrifyingly close to what I'd expect from shirobako
that's
this 6 part film over 5 years thing really makes me not care
to the girls Lily is important to, she's going to be one of the most important
groovin magic
but it's overall very plausible
*slight* fiction about the idea of brainwashing, I guess
Monster uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
yeah sakura quest is incredibly grounded
don't shame little kids for using hair dye
if the hair styling is normal, I think it counts
hair dye exists
action hero superman/woman kinds of thing
I just think that black lagoon gets a little close to
yeah, most sports anime are fine
so no superathletics
I'd argue that superhuman physical acts should count
most sports anime yes
like, a bunch of people collectively envision characters, and we, the audience, can see the characters standing there smiling
there's no actual effect on the world
Shirobako has some light 'magic' but it's really just visual metaphors
basically anything from PA works
looked like it to me
<@!246146781832806401>
https://twitter.com/catsuka/status/1235196034613207040
they've got a similar toy look
if you like medabots designs you might like danball senki LBXs
but yeah they were slow to air UC
I was like "what the fuck are you talking about gundam's older than that"
oh, msg
I do want to add from earlier that yes, "trap" as used to describe people or characters isn't permitted on this server
and G
normally they whimper out hard for the tail end of a show
XV5 selling 11.5k is really good
with BD6
Can't wait to see next month's list
Hathaway's flash is a horrible story and I still can't believe they're adapting it
I remember that announcement
jeez that's good
https://twitter.com/en_yen/status/1242271308152438784
That said, I suppose with an adaptation there's less freedom to do that kind of thing
but I feel like the story would have been radically different if it was 4cour immediately rather than planned to be two seasons of 2cour each
and sure, that was a total of 4cour
Stuff like Gundam 00 exists
except
See, I'd agree with you
> So to me, a 24-26 episode continuous series and a 1 cour show with a planned sequel are more or less the same
also, funding is handled differently, which could be a plus or a minus
you're more likely to get staff changes or the staff themselves has a potential to change in that time
I'd argue a second season is different than being '2cour'
rather than planned second seasons
everything else like SEED or GBF had genuine sequel projects
I think 00's the only gundam production that got season split
Production, too - airing years apart means you're liable to have to replace some staff
~~or get canned all together~~
the second season may have higher or lower budget depending on the performance of the first
both writing and budget are affected
I disagree
the argument was that this results in virtually the same product as just getting aired all at once
It did, Nemissa, but the second season was approved ahead of time
gundam tech's a joke in every setting but AD, frankly
read that as inuyasha
<:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>
he'll always be Holland to me
rip fujikei
saying "oh it's hughes" is really underselling it
Honestly he's one of the biggest VAs in the last 20 years
was in thunderbolt, too
it showed up in unicorn
anyway the GM, at least, is super-canon now
this is a parallel of germany in ww2
arguably part of what lost zeon the war was specialized production lines for everything


canonically they did, they just came out too late
RX-78 derived mobile suit designed for aquatic comat
black box computer that kicks the machine abilities into high gear
I have a feeling it was a little inspired by Gundam Sentinel
it's not bad
3 does as well, it's a mutual take-out
it ends with unit 3 trying to destroy 2 so that all EXAM components are destroyed and she can wake up again
the big thing about blue destiny is they run on the EXAM system which is basically a computer that uses an imprisoned newtype ghost of a powerful newtype in a coma
and I feel "it's a ground gundam that's always piloted by a newtype no matter who's sitting in the seat" *is a pretty big upgrade*
it's already halfway there
they are, but when you soup up a ground gundam I feel it gets to count as a full gundam
> there's the RX-78-4, RX-78-5, RX-78-6, there's the Alex, there's the mermaid gundam, there's thunderbolt's FA, there's the Blue Destiny Units 2 and 3, and then of course there's RX-78-2
> mermaid gundam might be an MSV that was never made but the rest saw action
> 6 even exists in two completely different designs according to two different action video games
> I'd also promote RX-79 Ez8 as a full gundam simply because oooh, special hero unit
stick with 0079-0080
I'm not even counting 0083
oh no
if you do there's like, 80
and that's if you don't count ground gundam
UC lore got overdeveloped
I was just reminded there's 10 gundams walking around during OYW and just after it and I'm mad again
it was a laughing point in mazinger z
abuse is really common in older mecha
I don't think there's a good answer for it except for the sourbread not returning home, which it does
if a single overloaded beam cannon can destroy a fleet, why has this weapon never been replicated
even though it raises questions
04's sacrifice scene is good
they were alright
which a videogame kind of retconned into the starting point for the GP project
the second one I was thinking of was RX-78-7/Gundam 7th
there weren't two versions of RX-78-6
*oh my god* I forgot
00 s1 was one of the best looking digitally animated gundams yeah
I do love them though
Gundam's big buzzword for making them viable is AMBAC, and while clever, you can make internally shifting weights to achieve the same thing
usually cheaper to make and easier to maintain
any advantage they give can be replicated or improved upon by a more intelligently designed weapons platform
military giant robots will never happen because they don't make any form of sense
Gridman is toku more than mecha but does hae mecha references
though I hesitate to call it a compilation movie
I guess Nanoha First, as well
The only compilation movies I think are a most watch are MSG's
Death and Rebirth should pretty much be always skipped
<:teef:656050348967854090>
I really enjoyed the OVA, haven't seen the TV show
Mazinger Zero being busted as hell is a rarity tbh
(what didn't, in Z)
even if it looked at the time better than ever
Getter definitely feels like it's just there to hang out in Z1
but they don't always have to be centerpiece
mazinger, getter, and gundam pretty much always have to be there
I mean that's normal for SRW
it's paced like shit and feels like it's juggling ideas and dropping them everywhere
the movie is not good
and call it a day
my advice is find a fight scene montage on youtube, listen to the remastered theme
I saw it in theaters
do you want advice on this
> and I wanna watch infinity too
It still looks great
I mean it's leiji matsumoto
what line is it
I don't know whether it's a good deal but it's on the lower end for most SRCs
accessories and gimmicks seem low for an SRC but it's also 100-200 bucks less than I've paid for others
SRC's a good line
This is also known as sports anime
Regarding "cute boys doing cute things" genre
regarding idol anime I feel AKB0048 is somewhat worth watching, if only because its very worshipping of the idol industry highlights how freaky and twisted the whole enterprise is
it's the gay in the 'this is definitely meant for male consumption' kind of gay
and there's mechs ye
a slowburn lesbian romance?
it's magical girls crossed with fate/stay night crossed with like
don't watch prillya
s1's goals for half the show are to be spinoff for a visual novel you've never heard of and it spends way too much time on characters you will never see again
you can watch s2 movie or tv after that
if you'd like advice, skip s1 tv and watch the first movie
no
why.
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
I just discovered this exists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiy4WBK0Ong
fight was great though
yeeeeeeeeep
also as much as I enjoyed Rebuild 2.0/2.22, it fucking hurt watching Asuka be replaced with the modern interpretation of a tsundere
which is that Rei ceases to be a character rather than a plot element the moment she shows up
that said Asuka does represent evangelion's biggest failure
both against people who hate it and against people who like it
I've been arguing about eva for 10 years
and more about women who were difficult, thorny prizes that the protagonist could conquer and steal their heart
it became less about girls with complex motivations
as asuka was copied
humanity is the struggle between
being apart is painful
being close to someone is hard
which is, of course, the core theme of eva
Asuka being a tsundere is less about her warming up and more about her being a shattered fucking person whose only self-assigned value is being the best and that's mentality that naturally pushes people away, even if she genuinely wants to be closer to someone
everyone should read pluto before commiting to that
> astro boy is a no
I think something can be heavily flawed and not considered "good," yet be critically and culturally important and worthwhile
There's definitely art to it
but I don't know if I think it's good
Evangelion is an anime that every anime fan should watch
gundam's success is in the merch
I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't
I actually wonder if gundam's sunrise's most successful animation
or being GNC
That kind of hints at a bigger issue than having a hobby
I'm pretty sure she's trans since she talks about how much happier she is now
<@!202444817043685386> I'm giving you a warning, don't use the word trap in that context on this server again, please
GNC = gender non conforming, eg astolfo
but everything after the eruption I enjoyed a lot
promare's first act isn't that great
er
fucking class a shit
nah there's the one that's a metaphor for bad yuri

Less Moe more drama
I'd love for a shirobako style anime about game dev
whatever the nickname is for the old late 80s/early 90s style of yuri was
I think it is
class s
I'd kill for shin great mazinger
It might be one of the newer spinoffs
Strike witches
I don't know if vividred is better or worse
Vividred had like 6 minutes of good content and it was all stock footage
yatteyaruze
judau's VA was shinobu from dancouga
oh shit I forgot
is it all ended up being right
the amazing thing about this preview
sorry for bad quality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoeKRY-AGMc
best thing about 00
anyway
I feel like if you see what kamille goes through and your takeaway is "gosh he's whining a lot" anime may have desensitized you to war
Gundam's a story about throwing a kid into the horrors of war and kamille's overall the best written to be a kid
deal with it
gundam's not a story about being cool
<:catsip:656050349399998464>
kamille's the best gundam protag
it's both parts, "orchis" is the MA component, "stamen" is the suit
you're confusing terms
no
yes.
if you're looking for the orchis, that's never going to be affordable
https://www.1999.co.jp/eng/10015701
on a website
I mean I'm looking at an MG of the stamen right now
yes, dendrobrium stamen
isn't there plenty of stamen models
PGs never get made except to test a new tech
it's a neat iteration on the quin mantha
but yeah kshatriya's good
that's not a mobile armor
what's even the point
humanoid mobile armors are dumb and I do not like them
the neo zeong was awful
also everything in episode 6 or whatever with the mobile armor was new to the anime
Unicorn novel isn't tooo different from the animation, they cut some of the anti-federation stuff and cut the whole sex slave plotline (because why wouldn't you cut it)
they just feel flimsier
this is koto kits in a nutshell
> I did the body of a cheap Frame arms. And stopped cause it felt cheap
7 years ago? 8?
what
but I watched V like
nothing like shown in the video
I could be wrong, I just thought I remember some sort of energy wave attack
both V2 Assault and V2 Buster were kind of rarely used
I think I remember it used once yeah
> weird retro question I need answered as GBGW is about to have V2 Assault Buster Gundam debut as a limited suit: did Victory Gundam ever feature V2 Assault's Mega Beam Shield being used as an offensive weapon?
rather than a piloting one
it's really a pretty direct ultraman parallel
not really, as that'd be a control mechanism
if someone becomes the mecha, it isn't mecha
external, and more importantly *prosthetic*
wow you really missed the important part of my definition
attack on titan isn't mecha, it's ultraman
therefore attack on titan is not mecha because it's an intrinsic magic ability
the best definition I could come up with is that it's a story where the protagonist attempts to enforce their will on the world using a mechanical (or pseudomechanical)external prosthetic that allows them to enact change on a scale they could never achieve without it
a while back I tried to figure out what the fuck mecha meant as a genre, since it gets so wibbly wobbly  and stuff like gundam, evangelion, and tekkaman blade has stretched the genre so wide that it's hard to figure out what unifies it
nanoha's not mecha but it's made by mecha fans
It's used in other situations, that doesn't make what I said wrong cypher
That's not a rebuttal
?????
never goes well
and that
I mean there's a number of reasons, but one major one is people love using it in reply to people bringing up the horrible shit ver was doing or planning on doing
do you really want to push that question
I've been on the fence about removing it for 11 months straight
if the emotion you're feeling is "gleeful destruction" maybe you shouldn't be feeling it
please stop using the ver emote
as much as post-madoka shows are trying to tear it apart
magical girls as a genre involves exploration of femininity
sentai is mecha since they do use a giant robot every episode
though scifi has *really* lost all meaning after the 70s or so
in the general case yes, but not always
I don't know if I agree fully
hm
and trying to figure out what's compelling about mecha as a concept and applying that to the concept of genre definitions
there is actually value in using critical thinking
not according to my definition but sure, person is in metal box, must be mecha
it's like asking if you like anime with blonde protagonists
asking someone if they like mecha is worthless because it's too big now
see that's the thing
The borderline between "tool" and "prosthetic" is a fuzzy one but I trust you have the critical thinking ability to recognize the majority of cases
but no, it's just a superhero's utility belt
that's a better argument than previous, though
no
oh
what the hell is a "3d movement gears"
I have no fucking clue what you're talking about
it's about trying to understand why something's popular and what the story tries to achieve by using it
it's not about "using elements"
the classification is for use to understand it
it's a mechanical thing
a car could be a mecha
yeah
"mecha" as a genre is seperate from "mecha" as a prop
You're also mixing terms
I don't know why you're trying so hard
so I note when stuff happens
but I've been watching this server with a concern for community health for 2 years
it hasn't happened for a while
delete's on my watchlist tbh
so people get really upset when it's posted in reply to them
I think one of the fundamental problems verlaugh has is it has dismissive energy
so "fine" is ehhhh
believe me, I've seen quite a few times where the emote's escalated an argument
my point was that it's not all that far off from an actual bad use case <:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
putting ver's face at the end doesn't make it "haha just kidding"
I mean, saying things to upset users (this is clearly in farce, but I've seen otherwise) is trolling and is against the rules and would be in bad use
it encourages people to be playful jerks, except being a playful jerk is subjective and a lot of time the otherside just sees "jerk"
anyway if you need another reason why I've been on edge about it, it's because having a "troll"/"trolled" emote isn't all that healthy for a community
it hasn't happened in the recent months, because they were kicked like 6 months ago cypher
it was a shot fired at people who have been kicked from the server, yes
oh shut up, you don't get kicked for being frustrating to talk to ~~with some historical exceptions who did it for months on end~~
The response to "please stop using it" was for someone to use it
It became about ver when someone decided the response they wanted to take to a polite request was to double down on it
the damn ver discussion is going to keep happening for as long as symphogear fans exist
which it has
I am *absolutely* going to remove something if a use case involves mocking rape on a repeated basis
Since it's 1 am I'll just finish by saying that if something's harming users here, I do not give a shit if people are having fun with it - the only relevant question is whether it is. I don't have a definite answer on it, because if I did, it'd have been gone months ago. That's my final statement on this. It's not going anywhere, for the moment.
and that's why I've been dithering over it for a year
usually, no
Sometimes, *definitely, very*
does that mean I should allow toxic conversation, words, or images?
I agreed that people are going to be toxic whether the emote's here are not, if they want to be toxic
Language that's used harmfully isn't allowed
you're free to not participate in the conversation that other people keep continuing
it's not the emote
it's not
or with the emote
guys anyone who would make the place a sewer is going to do it without the emote
it's almost like this server's about a show where the message is communicate or something
either positive or negative
it's easier for moderation to occur
if the words are aggressive
if people are actually communicating in text rather than memey emotes, it's more likely the conversation's going to go somewhere
it shocks me that you think this is a supporting point
than people using a server emote
that's way easier to action on
I'm not interested in changing people's heads, I'm interested in managing the tools they have to escalate conversations with
you can tell if a show has promise in the first episode - stop paying attention to the plot and premise, and pay attention to the directing and production
1) the three episode test is crap
2) the first episode teases you enough that you'll want to keep going
yeah
I'm not being sarcastic, I honestly get not remembering it
it's the kind of thing that's easy to dismiss as an anime gag unless it affects you
cypher did you forget the "prostitute"
but it's otherwise good
1-2 eps have *horrific* transphobia
be warned that like
shemmy did you see gargantia
that's true
it was about hope
the reason madoka was good and godzilla was not was because madoka wasn't about suffering
madoka's magical girl but madoka clones frequently aren't
cw rape ||literally a 2 minute rape sequence of the protagonist raping a girl (who falls in love with him the next episode) at the end of an ep for shock value, it's horrible||
*N O*
because the sentence should read
> From the writer of Code Geass and Kabanari of the Iron Fortress and Valvrave the Liberator
oh oof, this is a point against it for me
> From the writer of Code Geass and Kabanari of the Iron Fortress
also it was like 10 bucks when I bought it
3hz just has enough power as a studio to get me to buy it on blind faith
I own the bluray but have yet to watch it
because spoilers are no doubt about to be dropped
anyway this is definitely <#336310266654490624>
nothing in s1 is as bad as watching FIS fuck around in a tomato field or sitting through of an entire episode of maria's mindscapes
people say s1 is the low point and I never understand what they mean
gear slows down
no
s;g has good production
okay
but that's where they peak
like they're okay
are mediocre anime
is the "good gundam" shows
the thing about gundam
turn a is easily the best gundam but also needs you to watch like 100 hours of other gundam to get the best payoff
pilots stripping themselves in order to dodge bullets better a++ kawamori you mad bastard
first cour of evol was legit one of the best mecha rides I've had
only watch evol halfway though because wow the second cour was shit
watch aquarion and then aquarion evol halfway and then watch the crossover OVA
something completely inaccessible
or something
a sega saturn game
the timeskip stuff is actually in like
but you can appreciate them without watching it
also valvrave did have cool mechanical designs
I've never met a nadesico fan who is happy with the movie
the movie will turn a non-ending into a timeskip you don't understand bad ending
nadesico's really fun but be prepared for a complete non-ending
yeah, it's geass, but worse
comes out friday
are you going to get the fairy tail game
I hate shounen's formula because it's just soooooo animal brain addicting without needing to be good
(both of those are great)
big o
outlaw star
gundam wing, dragon ball, sailor moon, g gundam
I started on the old toonami block
yeah it's pretty great
and are controlled by steering wheels
run on gasoline
the giant walking robots in xabungle
like to elaborate
but xabungle is inherently goofy and keeps the goofy soul the whole way
it's probably not
eh
yeah I can see it
ps2 fight with zodd was awesome
the weapon hit sounds were the worst
<a:ShirabeSob:725756411312734228>
I'm being reminded of the initial d movies
that's a good story
old was just berserk up through the eclipse right
old berserk anime was good
why wouldn't they
it still had a giant tournament arc
mostly
naruto wishes it was inuyasha
I'm going to drop the hot truth
I don't get how people can find 80s/90s animation hard to watch and then like the trash made mid 2000s
imo it's the best 100+ ep series
so good
that would be
god
imagine a perfect adaptation of pluto
imagine a world where urasawa got a good adaptation
you'd have to read that far though
2/3s of the time her life sucks because she's a shitty person who wants to abuse others and she never gets better
*she never gets better*
but
like I tried to like it
I absolutely hate watamote
I've seen a decent amount of mazinger and tetsuwan, and a single ep of tetsujin
but 60s is definitely an acquired taste
no
I guess, statistically speaking, you have to exist
wow
evangelion, arguably
90s has a lot of good stuff
gits, bebop, outlaw star
there's been like 5 shows
what, zoids?
I'm stuck
my cat climbed on me
yes
he died recently
famous for a lot of roles like ali al saachez from 00, holland from eureka 7 etc
fujiwara keichi
:(((((
irvine's japanese VA was fujikei
now I remembered
fuck
anyway you can't just drop music from the show and not post this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07cNDoNinww
cool finish
hell yeah
shooting the liger out the cannon
I liked the last fight
Fiona took her coffee with salt
god I just remembered

van and fiona were great
could be good??
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgggHf1JUVc
also oclisto
that was zoids genesis though
the other's a decent ds game
one was a bad microtransaction psp game
zoids showed up in two of them
huh apparently fuzors got cooler later
sword stormer was great
I think I'm confusing it with stuff like the energy liger
oh
though they weren't really meant to be swapped
not 3
6-7 armors
the actual liger zero idea in lore is cooler because there's like
(outside of the games)
and panzer was worthless
kind of ended up being the same armor over and over
it was kind of cool
shield liger is more charming and blade liger is cooler
also I don't like liger zero's design
the other two are just some boring generic tournament setting
zoids lore is ridiculously rich and deep and they pulled from it for the war setting
maybe it'll be easier to power through
but I was watching it air weekly
I couldn't get past like 4 episodes
fuzors is bad
FORGOT
RIGHT
ZOIDS WILD
OH
yes
which
genesis
there was also uhhhhhhhhhh
It is, though mecha rarely uses static character arcs
the most interesting character in the show gets locked up in a sex dungeon for most of it <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I mean the heavy amounts of it are one of many reasons why the second half of the first season is really bad
HibiMiku is directly acknowledged
new game being light and fluffy drove me nuts - I can enjoy the genre, but, honestly, the challenges of game development sound so much more interesting than another fluff show and it's just disappointing that it's not what you're getting with new game
yano-saaaaaaan ;-;
fuck me that's a good statue
https://twitter.com/hj_s_bishoujo/status/1294443715012857856
agreed, though, leviathan isn't that great, but the designs and girls are nice
<:CharlotteSip:709139006939725924>
but it's a show about monster girls, how good could it be
no, it's not
the leviathan girls don't typically show scales but when they undress they do
also that's a good dx
leviathan the last defense
> The dragons there aren't really what I'm looking for.
> Weird horns and tails and not enough scales.
<@!237964037898502144>
dancouga BD set? shit
the anime is a good adaptation but it's a *very direct* adaptation that hits beat for beat
you could just read it
I think the source of these comments is 2ch
you say this like it would be out of character
> there's no way that tweet's accurate
> unless Anno just decided to turn eva 3+1 into a full goddamn TV show behind our back

yeah, and even though neo is a metaphor for jesus that doesn't make the matrix a bible story
once you hit post-apoc you're no longer cyberpunk man
but as long as it's just a metaphor it's not *actually about that*
I mean, yes, the story is an analogy about the transgender struggle in society
when 'the man' is a program it breaks down
this involves more than a dystopia, this involves a fight, on some level, against 'the man'
you need the 'punk' part
as was mentioned earlier
The backstory is
I dunno if I agree? The story out of the VR setting... isn't
see the matrix
you can be VR-based without being cyberpunk
yeah, that's generally true
virtually every cyberpunk setting has some form of 'neurodeck' or whatever
VR cyberlife is one of the cornerstones of cyberpunk
~~no promises that it makes sense at the end~~
with giant robots
Negotiator has to unravel the mystery of a city where nobody has memories past a few decades
Big O
Noir like? from the 90s?
the irony of shirobako having a disaster production is never lost on me
it debuted in *February*
what the fuck, really?
Hey, does anyone know if there are subs for Shirobako Movie out there?
Every time it started to get dull they threw in ridiculous plot shit
my favorite battle shounen is s1 of danball senki <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
6 eps each
Gunbuster, and it's spiritual sequel, diebuster
Oh
Most mecha has the problem of being either really long or badly directed
The mobile suit gundam movies are a decent place to start for real robots
How patient are you
Hm
I will be bitter about the exexbein until I die
I mean the girls are equally into Calvina so
Kyosuke was still better than Ing though
Touma getting to be center is fine??? It's literally his game at center stage??
Meanwhile they still haven't gotten to the alpha 3 plot <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
4 games
His unit is neat but I got so tired of him being forced to be relevant in everything for like
He is og's Gary stu
*fuck* kyosuke
Gonna be honest
https://youtu.be/3aYyYq5uGbc
If seeing this once per episode sounds like a good time the show is probably for you
~~the ova is still bad~~
I rewatched it lately and TV still holds up
Anyway Taq, if you want to try something more traditionally super robot (nothing getter made after 1980 is traditionally super robot), try gaogaigar if you're okay enjoying something like a kid
Yeah
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
And still looks identical
It bothers me that in canon she should be about 17 now
She's eternally 14
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
And I say this as someone with the username latooni
The inspector was just really awful over all
Obari is a good designer and really mediocre director
You won't be missing out that hard by not watching nausicaa or nadia
Anno's catalog isn't worth going through extensively
That's not a joke
Before he got depressed
Yeah
The animation quality is very high
Gunbuster is an ova
most of it was just "where are they now"
really not much going on in infinity tbh
well yeah, because there was all of like 4 missions of plot
I am a longtime fan of mazinger and saw it in theaters and I was still bored out of my mind for half the movie
For infinity I'd just Google mazinger infinity fight scene tbh
Everything in it gets repeated later at a better time
Weird directorial experiment
Also if you watch shin mazinger skip episode 1
Shin mazinger z is standalone but is a fanservice crossover of a lot of smaller go nagai properties
Getter is a mess and is kinda standalone and is kinda not
Ggg is standalone of anything as is gunbuster

Diebuster echoes themes of gunbuster and gunbuster should be watched before it
The last good new GGG content imo was blockaded numbers
The renais novel was also not that good iirc
Also gggfinal shows that the creative minds in charge lost the magic <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Tying it into GGG was just egotism
Betterman is not a great show
Don't think we're missing much there
I uh
Rip baan gaan
Transformers is too much like gundam for me to like - obsessed with it's lineage over new ideas
God now I'm upset at z3 again <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000> 
Why did that series end so bad
I think they're the worst animated originals since z3 <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Tyranado is at least better than the mess of v imo
That and alien space cops
> we'd like the vanilla cool real robot who for some weird reason needs a fucking support system to carry around a wimpy rifle for it pls
<@378750276057694213> 
Srw t bringing it back

Still mad that they took away that idea from blanche niege in 2nd og though
Shadowmaru is only not the coolest brave because volfogg exists
The ending is on acid though
J-decker is fun
do you know how cool it is to attack using suicide attacks that change your unit
V gundam in general
which is actually an interesting point, I'd kinda like to see angel halo brought back for a plot spin
but no one gives a shit because late UC isn't cool
because I think shakti's actually one of the most powerful newtypes in UC history
shakti?
alpha 3 was big boy plot time
a 30km wide stargate warping spacetime and meaning colony fleets from the future actually showed up in the earth sphere now
with uh
alpha 3 did it
with the exception of the big bang at CCA
newtypes at any other point in UC aren't really that pivotal
that means you're stuck with unicorn
don't say that
tekkaman blade and dancouga both come to mind
they're frequently quarantined to just being a threat over here while life is normal over there
It's far from the only series where the earth's supposed to be losing
You'd be surprised
I guess
maybe they only have like, one continent or something
and the best path would be to come up with an excuse that makes the beta just another alien invader in terms of power level
right
unless BETA are really neutered
without each having their own bullshit excuse
out of the *15 other series in the game,* none can be air units
I don't think you get what I'm saying
so you'd have to make the BETA a much more minor threat
like, imagine, out of the cast, you can't have any air units...?
because the broader setting's a little too restrictive on the series
muvluv would have to be one of the lamer spinoff anime
<:NononSmug:651876302412054548>
TSFs are just ugly valks
just do a macross
also yes the thing did sus best because among us is literally based on it
it could go <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
you know
just that
maybe? I'm not going to say srw's dead
idk I think Z3 broke something in me, where I'm just hyper aware they're like, 2 bad games in a row away from being dead
also they keep making mobile srws
> The company was dissolved in February 2019 and combined to Bandai Spirits, with the company getting all the rights and duties of Banpresto.[3]
I have no idea how long srw will continue with banpresto gone and covid striking
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
UX and BX
it was the 3DS ones
it came out after J
nah
which SRW was that
a decade ago
uhh
kaiser nova's way cooler than the OVA sword thing
but that's mostly nostalgia talking
zero's neat but I was happier with X bringing back SRW Mazinkaiser
koji being a shit with sayaka was the best part of the movie tbh
I don't really think it's fair to claim srw fixed infinity, it just didn't have the need to convey 150 minutes of runtime
jesus
and it ended with a recap finale
one of kyoani's first ever anime
fucking incredible
air ended on a recap
I forgot
oh my god
early key anime were bad
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
the art
also I mean
I think it's not that fun a show and the flute scene made me sick
go for it if you want
but good god it manages to be offensive, asspully, hard to follow, and boring all in the same show
shame because the mechanical designs are pretty
maybe they'd put valvrave in the same game so I can skip them both
I refuse to support that show
it's generic as shit
why???
please leave rape out of yuri
I hate that show so much I'd probably skip any SRW they put it in.
god. no.
~~and probably dunbine again because they can't not do dunbine when they do fantasy~~
I'd love to see escaflowne
maybe combine it with fantasy units
I'd be up for a low-tech SRW
it's been like 20 years
we're kinda due for a OYW srw
honestly, with thunderbolt
pretty sure it's the only major (non-mass produced) gundam to not have a beam rifle
I mean I think the GP02's the lamest boss unit in gundam history so we're even
I don't know if it's been featured since A portable
MSG
you know what really needs a turn
it's really hard to justify 0083 tech when Unicorn's center stage
blame Unicorn
yeah
I think the reason wing irritates me is because the units are always so limited
you can still unlock her quebely though
the major exception is Alpha 3, because the canon ending to Alpha 2 has her dead
I mean if Z's in she's usually not only in the game, but unlockable
anyway, it feels so overexposed compared to others, even though I know Z gundam's probably more used
they love to just drop the units and pilots in - well, I can't blame them, the story sucks
~~I'm sick of wing in SRW~~
they go really well together
turn A should be saved for srws with X
https://twitter.com/Kaleb_IA/status/1320061481426190336?s=19
shirobako is still good
so I just skipped that
while it would make me sound like an expert, saying the "daikessen version" would explain it to very very few people without google
yes
though T's wasn't so bad because they got rid of the stupid cylinder body part
I *am* looking forward to SRWs that have HEATS without the ugly ass Shin Getter Dragon <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
HEATS 2021 <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
but
I'm so not interested in Arc
Nobody cared for gt when super didn't exist
it's not only a harem, it's a really bad example of one
skip IS
it's shit from the start and it should just be cut
the protagonist is the only guy, in the *whoooooooooole* world, who can genetically or whatever use these things
so the entire premise is that these weapons of war can only be used by girls
No, no, in this case it is the best solution
they are very much Harem Girls‚Ñ¢Ô∏è instead of fleshed out characters imo
girls need more
I think even getting rid of IS protagonist isn't enough
I recall golden boy having a decent dub but it's kind of an outdated form of comedy
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2020-11-09/why-does-the-crunchyroll-original-series-ex-arm-look-so-awful/
the staff is horrible
the director's a live action director who wanted to "focus on motion capture"
rhyyman it might actually stem from the same source
if it is I was unaware of that
unless visual flight is a dubbing company
the error was in picking the staff and the studio
crunchyroll didn't create, they bankrolled
No one asked crunchyroll to do anything, but it doesn't really matter
?

but an odd choice to go so deep on
which is a fun film class challenge I guess
same scenario, different storyboard
it is really hard to underline the agony people were going through watching their favorite series do this, once a week, for eight weeks
yeah, I think being able to watch it all in a row really makes it seem not as truly awful as it was
people were sooooo sick of it 2 months in that they kinda just quietly stopped caring
People were still talking about it a lot by that point
I think people could have lived with 3 eps
wasn't endless eight like maybe a page and a half in the LN
kyoani really determined to ruin their golden goose
the VAs almost led a strike over it
I know they re-recorded voices every time
but was it full animation?
they changed some stuff
...yeah, endless eight would probably count.
the best example I can think of is SDF Macross' fever dream ep
yeah, as I said, clipshow makes the most sense, especially those episodes that try to make a new story out of it
it's a budget slash measure but you sometimes get really creative writing out of them
a bottle show/bottle episode is one that takes place on a television show, but it keeps to just a handful of sets, usually already built ones, for the entire thing.
The phrase was used earlier, though I think incorrectly
can you even have a bottle show in anime? Doesn't the term lose meaning? I feel like the anime version of a bottle show is a clip show
nichibros is really good yeah
Make it global, you lose appeal
One of the reasons initial d could afford to be realistic was that it was japanese through and through
Anyway, redline exists
Looking back on it it does feel a little like a live action anime though
<:BasaSmug:497598144083787796>
It's called love bug
Rally racing has an anime

oh are we doing seed covers
"I wonder what the most dramatic way we can make characters text is"
haifuri movie
oh shit
its tomorrow
~~technically they're controlling tiny robots but there's not really a huge difference~~

"ah, there we go"


yes the film is set in a parallel world
like I could totally get that some kid on a superpowered soccer team grew up to be an LBX test player
and yeah I figured they're cameos but cameos are also frequently "maybe kinda same universe" things
you can't not know what LBXs are after going through half of W
you can't
well
well, if I do remember correctly and they don't know what LBXs were and they are concurrent
so they're either from before 2044 or whatever, or a different reality
iirc the Raimon kids in the crossover movie had no idea what LBXs were
I mean, many worlds interpretation suggests that alternate universes are born out of different choices, so many universes are going to share elements
inazuma hasn't given me a date yet
it's just the movie implied, but didn't state, they were different realities
I mean, they literally have a crossover movie raiden
2050
I'm less than 10 episodes into the fucking 300 episode inazuma and I've already seen two
one's a coincidence
yeah I mean
the settings are closer than I thought they were
shown here
I mean the movie makes me think that but there's also one dude who's just in both shows
Danball Senki W (someone cosplaying)
inazuma eleven


inazuma and danball are the same setting???
oh my god
it's super dimensional soccer, after all
<:catsip:656050349399998464>
they crossed once
well, the sequel show has had a crossover movie to W
also the shows have had a crossover movie
it's worth noting one is supposed to be a middle schooler and one is supposed to be an adult
Why
why, Level 5
?????????????
Danball Senki W (2013)
Inazuma Eleven (2008)
so I'm starting Inazuma Eleven because I decided I must suffer and
which is why they've closed their western studios
apparently level 5's all in on it, but also recognizes it doesn't sell here
remember when level 5 made stuff that wasn't yokai watch
that said I do believe they're probably just art cameos but it's fun to imagine
they're *both* brought in from the outside
nor is it the world of inazuma
but the world isn't the world of danball
alright it looks like the juddering I had last night is from a shitty encode rather than just my video player, other anime aren't doing it <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I think this is more than just an anime problem
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
...and now my windows 10 search bar won't work
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
ugh suddenly getting lots of judder in my video players
this show has ceased to be even the slightest bit rational
they're definitely not the same universe but the crossover cameos are wack
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Zaizen Sousuke, Prime Minister of Japan of Inazuma Eleven, looks suspiciously like Zaizen Sousuke, Prime Minister of Japan of Danball Senki
the end is insane but it's a fun timewaster
I enjoyed J decker btw
Level 5 please

please I can't take the cameos anymore
the nickname comes more from the second half of seed and more specifically destiny
combined with wing zero's twin buster rifle
Gunbuster+Diebuster did neither show favors
sure, but it's still out there
you... can?
the composer for Gunbuster also did Diebuster (that's decently known) but he also did GaoGaiGar and G Gundam
not well known fact
also Diebuster is probably Tanaka Kouhei's best score
Gunbuster's semi-hard scifi is really cool but Diebuster did the emotional writing better
I just felt Diebuster was overall a better production
Gunbuster is good and I don't really agree with that statement
Even, or maybe even especially, Noriko
Gunbuster's characters are just weaker across the board
~~I'm part of a small heretical group that prefers Diebuster~~
I disagree tbh
Zeta manages to be pretty pure 'real'
tbh I always feel like MSG TV is a super robot show that has the embryo of the real robot franchise in it
gundam:
"gundam is a real robot show"
I forgot it happened until I looked it up tbh
what did denan geis use
maybe there's a better way to get the image but I just googled 'f91 shell casing'
https://twitter.com/MinovskyArticle/status/1099719931359301633
there's a really famous shot where a civilian woman dies because of a falling shell casing
cypher have you ever seen f91
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e8zUqP8yu4
haha yeah sleggar's just an ass
Him slapping amuro was him losing control because Bright is *nineteen* and not really ready for the position <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
at least in MSG
also bright's slaps are him failing as a commander
hahaha no, no slap.
so maybe they'll continue that
The most important scene involving bright *can* be done without any dialogue
they've avoided putting him in projects since
his voice actor died earlier this decade
No, I mean
I'm curious how they're going to handle bright
they're not a compilation.
OVAs came first
MSG is the only movie compilation I can think of that I think is better than the source material, if we're counting Nanoha First as a new project since it's completely reanimated
Nikola's plotline is kind of distasteful but I think it existing makes Lal'cs plotline better
Do they still have the part where he ||tries to "attack" Nono||
that one is pretty important
oh, the one about Nikola?
because Tycho's episode, while good, honestly doesn't matter because she stops existing in any meaningful capacity in the anime starting next episode
I haven't seen the movie cut, which episode
it's not anime, cypher
I hate that joke and yet I succumbed to making it
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
~~you can't talk about ZZ in this channel~~
Mafty isn't very whiny
CCA definitely got me to hate hathaway more than Zeta ever made me dislike Kamille
he's the most interesting gundam protagonist
I liked IJ's leg sabers
Destiny was just an ugly show
what the *fuck* were those designs
fucking Earth Federation mobile armors
and then you had uh
don't just wank UC
give us GINN successors or something
they looked neat but
the ZAKU and GOUF and whatever from Destiny bothered the hell out of me
it's passable in SEED and only gets disgusting in Destiny
But again
"*I'm* right."
but then it goes
it does Gundam's thing of "hm, both sides are wrong"
yeah, honestly, I feel that's where it lets down MSG a lot
tbf it does make sense for ZAFT to make units named that
and it starts to run into flaws pretty quick
that marks the spot where SEED stops being a remake of MSG and starts being its own thing
yeah
Astray puts him in the cockpit during the explosion
this is wrong btw
Kira's not an offensive character in SEED, but I think the jesus name still fits
"I just don't count Destiny" is a fine personal mantra, but it's kind of shitty to tell people you think their nickname is wrong because you're not counting literally half his screentime
And no, you can't go "he's fine in SEED" because the nickname applies to the character, not the show - and I'd argue that the traits start to show up in SEED, just magnified to a ridiculous gary stu level in Destiny
Three he has a *unrealistically godlike* level of skill where he can just disable every suit on the battlefield without killing anyone
Two, he has the *most* pacifistic outlook and saint-like objective out of any gundam protagonist ~~barring AGE~~
One, he survived an impossible to survive explosion and they had to write an entire manga to fix the plothole
Kira earned the nickname because of several factors
you can die on the hill if you want, but I view it as an avoidable execution
(he's not called that because he's skilled, by the way)
Destiny's where Kira really earns the jesus nickname
but yeah, it's passable
both animation and writing
SEED's second half kind of dives in quality
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
oh god I just remembered akatsuki
gaia gundam


wait until you see the upgrade


called Librarian
there was this shadow organization that made clones of characters or something
oh man it got really weird and dumb
it took place on mars, mostly
they were from the destiny-era astray manga
nah


Delta Astray and Turn Delta are some of the ugliest gundams ever
Astray got really stupid really fast
but it's been a long time
I think the Astrays used the powerlink that's supposed to interface with weapons and used it offensively
why would you build a gun that shoots 5 meters
it makes no sense except as a shining finger reference
Destiny was okay except I hate the hand blaster
Impulse was alright, I missed Victory tech
SF is gross
IJ overall was okay with me
because in kyoani's ridiculous pursuit of perfection, they insisted on rerecording it every episode
I dunno if the video touches on it but at one point the VAs threatened to strike, they hated doing the arc so much
holy shit what
you know it's niche when it's from the 70s and it's been in srw exactly once
that's a real niche one
yeah I was amazed by Daltanious
ah, yeah, fmp does
a lot of the 70s stuff hasn't gotten subs last I checked, and some is difficult to find at all
also yeah the only other show I can think of that has a submarine highly featured is arpeggio
kinda wish I did an anilist because it'd look really different
the main leads are very good boys
I'm enjoying inazuma eleven more than I thought I would
oh damn
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1338663428643123200
"we're seeing how sales of s1 and 2 do" basically
best isekai
Watching AO retroactively makes e7 shittier, as a warning
The metastory of how Nadia's production affected anno is the most interesting part about it imo
apparently he's inspired by how the director used to be as a PA lmao
Tarou is the encapsulation of everyone I've hated working with
we'll probably see BD rips in spring
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
and then came out again because it wasn't finished the first time
movie came out
there is
also yes shirobako is my #1 favorite anime series
he hangs around with like 2nd graders and chaperones them and enjoys it
he is like the nicest dude ever
who *wouldn't* guy be friends with
I've never seen anything beyond battle city animated, though I read the full manga, once, a decade ago
I liked the manga arc where they played D&D with bakura
literally the book of mormon except god is a superintelligent AI who can communicate through the genetically receptive
which was...
he really saved most of the mormonism for the homecoming series
vaguely but without politics
all using children's toys naturally
where the plot revelation has been that the war exercises the kids are doing for a school project ||are actually a war simulation that affects how countries are handled irl||
danball senki wars
my brain is melting and pouring out of my ears from this show



It's more mild but all the themes are still there
I cannot seperate the anime from the source material
I despise GATE
horrible flashbacks to GATE
It just kinda... Happens
I'd there were episodes of king gainer to not own it would be the ending
I have that outlaw star dvd set lol
add it manually
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbVFjFZSIFc
nice
and they're not making it up that a published bit of backstory in gunbuster is that japan obtained hawaii
It's pretty hard to argue with the language used on forms in episode 1 and the prominent japanese flag in ep 2
yeah that's just the primer
just mostly hidden in stuff like kanji that doesn't get subbed
It's definitely there in gunbuster
https://animekritik.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/imperialism-translation-gunbuster-introduction/
hold on
though I like Gunbuster despite it being japanese imperialism
Nationalist japanese supremacy cypher
alpha 3 even had the F-type equipment as an unlock
I really enjoyed the Alpha 3 Eva story
that's really cool
still afraid to watch the shirobako movie
but yes, ~~4.0~~ 3.0+1.0 will be a disaster I'm sure
with 3.0 it's moved solidly to "who cares"
and, at least, 1.0 and 2.0 provided dozens of hours of fun conversations about "is this a sequel??"
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
it's not evangelion if it's not slow
I don't really agree that it's boring
2.0 at least gives a real catharsis to shinji's character development that no other piece of evangelion property has
3.0 (I haven't seen 3.33 but they never actually change anything so it doesn't matter) is so unconnected to the franchise and skips so much that I'm pretty uninvested in anything happening, and the key emotional moment of the entire movie makes no sense
I don't really agree
also wow I don't think I've ever heard anyone say 3.0 was better than 2.0 before
wow this looks like one of the worst spinoffs I have ever seen
did not hear about LBX girls.
I.
wow inazuma really hitting me with *two back to back* recap eps
the only times I've ever been unhappy with misaka is when touma was on screen
I wish we got a version of zz that didn't include the first half of the show or judau or moon moon

There's such a good story in the whole haman and glemy and mashimre etc stories but I just cannot recommend it to anyone who isn't scraping the bottom of the barrel of gundam content already
Especially since Lexi's reaction wasn't even slightly aggressive or excessive
My advice is to just acknowledge/quick apology, correct, and move on
You don't get to decide how much being misgendered hurts someone.
but don't tell someone to *chill* because *you* made it.
Making a mistake is one thing
Aya.
and forced on you
way more obvious in Destiny
it's just
Everything that makes Kira jesus is in SEED
you still haven't watched Destiny right
but still realize that the switch in Kira's objective and new machine marks the change of a story to a direction you like a lot less
I think you can admire that moment
Maybe he thought the impulse would block some other way?
It does seem like bad storyboarding
because he knows all and can perfectly disable any machine <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
maybe he knew the blade would only dip into the cockpit but not hit shin
Aya that's a good point, but it's ~kira~
same with freedom, justice, duel, everything else
but in universe it's just the strike
I guess now that build fighters is a thing it's the strike gundam there
they just call it the strike, or GAT-X105, or the X105, or whatever
in-universe
only boxart calls it the strike gundam
so they put out it as is
Hyaku Shiki is Anaheim making the Delta gundam but they didn't finish the transformation mechanism
but I'd also count the Hyaku Shiki
I'd say everything from SEED, Aya
but the barbatos is in a ground where it's *close enough* to a traditional gundam that stuff like the vfin horns and the legs bother me
I love the turn A for the same reason
it's kinda weird
and people did
you could easily argue about it all day
and then there's theseus ship arguments - is the zeta zaku a gundam? is the monstrosity judau/grey stork ends up making out of the zz and junk parts in crossbone and victory sidestories a gundam?
it's the only way of thinking of it that doesn't involve a massive list of exceptions, I feel
I could knock holes in all of them but at the end there's no point because the concept of gundam is fluid and is easily bendable towards whatever sunrise wants to market
yeah, exactly
does it need a vfin, does it need gundam colors, does it need the name gundam
'what is a gundam' was just one of the favorite asinine arguments people had
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but yeah I think the decisive argument that they are gundams is that the boxart calls them gundams
I do think Hyaku Shiki should count though
etc
Hyaku Shiki is a gundam but Strike isn't
there were some fun claims being had
Also the same OS got reused for grunt suits
it is not used for the unit.
it is used for the OS
because the term is never used in-universe
about whether gundams in seed really count as gundams
oh my god I'm getting flashbacks to arguments on /m/
I can't think of any strategic value that putting a beam cannon in the hand that only goes like 15 meters has
a super robot move in a series that otherwise takes itself seriously
like the sillhouette system it feels out of place
I think my only problem with the destiny gundam is the hand blaster
Destiny has probably done more for gundam's success than any other series made after 1987
as shitty as it was, Destiny saved gundam
but I think that decision was made by bandai, because the model kits were actually selling again
instead of just recycling ZAKU and GOUF and DOMs
personally I also wish they had continued developing unique ZAFT suits
yes
instead of being stolen by the favorite character of the director's wife
and Shinn was the protagonist for the whole show
...
I think Destiny might have worked if Kira's beliefs were ever actually challenged
yeah
and that's just not going to go down well with people who grew up on gundam
the metanarrative of Destiny and the intent of the director is clearly saying "This is the right ideology, Kira is right, everyone else is wrong, he is the only ethically good boi (and his friends)"
there's a lot of reasons people react so hard to Kira but I think the biggest is that, unlike most gundam series
really shaky
most gundam is
like, story-wise
~~most gundam is average at best~~
while I wouldn't say I love SEED I'd say it's on par with most gundam
yeah
I burned out on gundam around there and I was irritated that GBF just destroyed any chance of talking about danball senki because everyone assume's it's a worse version, and I just haven't gotten around to catching up since
I actually haven't watched any build fighters content since the first
smug-en
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
what if they renamed the iyashikei genre to ii sekai
I still own all the thunder zords - the expensive ones that actually combine
well shit, of the two, I'm glad to hear that's the one you have a private crusade against
the new breed of magical girl show is trying to sell the girls themselves, and their bodies, as merchandise
Pretty cure is trying to sell pendants and wands
Do you think the cases of merchandising are equal?
then I withdraw the point but I think you're not seeing the problem here
Certainly not something you see other shows trying to move in on
And I'd argue it is, actually, somewhat of a niche market
Yes, again, I feel like you didn't read what I wrote, because I specifically addressed pretty cure
selling *merchandise* to male anime fans gets you more money, too, unless you're going to try to corner a small market
I feel like you didn't read what I said?
because selling to male anime fans gets you more money
aside from pretty cure and other shows trying to milk toy money from girls, magical girls are now more frequently about objectification of girls and turning them into merchandise than they are about stories about actualizing feminine qualities into power
to a degree, I think - the situation encourages what's basically gentrification of a genre as capitalism consumes it and transforms it away from the art form it used to be into something for consumption for the widest or most profitable audience
star wars doesn't really try to comment on humanity's integration with technology which generally most scifi does
average joe might call it scifi, but to a lot of movie/lit critics it would more obviously be a sword and sorcery story with a blaster gun coat of paint
god knows it's existed for stuff like star wars since the 70s
I mean I think there is room for a disconnect between public perception and critical assessment/dialogue between critics
and the decision to market primarily to men
it was nanoha As
imo the true shift in the magical girl genre wasn't madoka
because the majority of the community look at set dressing and consume uncritically
but without the ending madoka is fundamentally opposed to the core of the genre
perhaps you would be able to call it an anti-magical girl show, as it would have tried to portray femininity as a weakness and bad thing
anyway I don't think madoka with a different ending would have really been a magical girl show
please don't use emotes like that here
madoka worked because it upset the table only to put it back and affirm the ground it stood on
I think something's fundamentally lost in the process and the depth of the stories you can tell is limited because you have this extra layer of anime abstraction bullshit that's really only there for aesthetics
I don't think you really have magical girls if you aren't exploring the power of some aspect of femininity
site and asuka are definitely not my cup of tea and they're probably what I'd cite most directly as shows that use magical girl imagery that do not fall in the magical girl genre
Anyway yeah Lexi I'll be curious what you think of the show, and especially your thoughts on the america team plotline
Not all the taboos and kinks it nods at are popular ones, and there's a side story plot that has a message I'm not a fan of spreading
Anna has more hotblood than Noriko so it's worth a watch
Despite that it's still like, 16+ for rating, maybe lower
Basically *everything* in godannar has to do with sex, taboo, or kink
The second season of godannar was partially funded by selling an actual erodoujin made by staff
Its pretty high on the fanservice, we're talking like strike witches level except mostly aimed at twenty-somethings

I love godannar but can't ever recommend it lmao

Also some of the messages in it definitely don't fly well anymore but I can accept it as a piece of it's time
I think even then; I don't think they'd be convinced to watch the show and yet still think it was a flowery, harmless magical girl show
not because the writing is different but because the initial setup is banking on shock value that isn't going to come
sure; the criticism is the writing isn't as good now as it was then
versus those then
and madoka is one degree less relevant to those now
but I think to be a classic without flaw, you have to be just as relevant to those of the future as you are now
I didn't say it didn't hold up great
but it sealed its place in history
I think it holds it back in being a true flawless classic
some decisions only happened because of the state of the genre at that time; it's a show forever intended to be viewed by people in 2011 rather than those of the future
I think if madoka was made now it wouldn't be made the same way
and the stuff about 'it's weak because in retrospect it's obvious' really says to me you weren't around when it first aired
Expelled from Paradise etc
and I mean he's written stuff that's not really that grimdark at all since
he wasn't notorious at the time; sure, he wrote saya no uta, but that doesn't mean everything he wrote had to be misery. I think Zero's the only other thing he was even slightly famous for at the time and it wasn't animated yet
I don't think that's a requisite for the message
also, I think the narrative holds up even if you don't actually like anyone
it's worth watching if only for the enjoyment of the craft, imo
just fyi I do think that madoka from an artistic and overall intricacy standpoint is worth crawling through whether or not you actually like anyone involved
but it was what made it Important.
and for the record I agree that the fact that it was a dark magical girl show wasn't what made it unique - only episodes 10 and 12 truly do that
these days, the fact people tell you to watch madoka is, of itself, a reason to suspect it's a setup
if you were just watching some anime on the seasonal calendar there's no reason to suspect this would be anything other than a better produced than average magical girl show
but yeah honestly I think a prime factor in madoka's surprise back then is that the only reason to suspect it would be better or different than your typical pretty cure clone is the studio and art style, which aren't significant things to go off of
I feel like we're talking past each other at this point
There's a few, like Frame Arms Girls
rebellion should be seperated from the series by time, imo
I think you should wait a week
<@!266379640069685252> while I think you should watch rebellion

but of stuff like the Zssa
I wasn't really thinking of the ZZ itself - though I'm not a fan
it's ZZ that's filled with ugly suits for me
You really think so? I think the curves are pretty elegant
but that's what the main character's got
one of danball senki's strong points is you almost never get to see a show choreographed around spear and shield combat
its used by the protagonist unit of the first danball senki show, so, maybe check it out
and I say this as someone who watched the original series I think 4 times?
"if they hadn't told me these were based on lbx I would never have guessed"
I agree, I haven't watched the first episode yet but when I saw the trailer I thought
(LBX Girls)
I'm going to have to watch this shitty show anyway because I'm in too deep but this review made me chuckle
lol
by mid 90s they had to cancel gundam shows mid-season because they weren't getting watched
I'd say mecha hasn't been mainstream in anime since the 1980s
mecha's niche as hell and the merchandising is even more niche
it's not a probably, it's not even close
at least someone else finally finished it
smh
guess they gotta make ~money~ on moe anime
but
I spent a decade hoping they'd revisit it again someday
I consider fumoffu a gaiden so I don't agree
they also did second raid
they didn't do the first season
man, it's so weird to think that at one time, all kyoani was known for was this and key vn adaptations
bonta-kun...
I cannot step in here and tell you when you're going too far because I haven't watched in years so please police yourselves
for rwby I think I'll say that stuff from 12+ months ago is fine
Monty did good work and s8-10 of rvb were my favorites *because* of his work, but I think if he was still at the helm of RWBY it'd be dead by now
??????????????????
for all that he's good at choreography, I can't ever forget the ending of haloid, when master chief and samus have a lesbian makeout
I do not think he was a particularly good writer
the first two seasons in particular feel like a bad parody of anime, but I think a lot of that is on Monty
but I don't think that's necessarily a negative point
yeah, RWBY's first 3+ seasons feel really amateur, and not just in a "this was done in blender" way
Try is like, the stereotype of a mediocre shounen sequel season
Isn't... the existence of the source material... a stalker reference...?
Second biggest scale bandai does
1/100s are big ye
Exia Rebuild is one of the top 5 gundam designs
Exia is so good
https://youtu.be/xObpGXit0XQ
Too bad we never saw anything but the trailer
Reminds me of the gaiking movie
Looks good

"because it's gundam and all gundams must be the same"
like 00s1 was telling a really unique story and then 00s2 was like "nah we'll just make this zeta gundam again and make it about newtypes and ~understanding~"
I'd put 00s1 but 00s2 exists and brings it back to average
G, though the art hurts it a lot
0079, 0080, zeta, turn a
but then I remember the really standout ones and I'm like "oh yeah okay"
a lot of the shows are pretty mediocre
honestly sometimes I ask myself if I like gundam because of stockholm syndrome
Amuro got laid, he became a dead beat dad
Kira got laid, everyone dumps on him
idk, getting laid in gundam seems to be bad
also IBO enthusiasts tend to... look down on other gundams for not being as edgy?
I mean IBO is solid but there's no question edge is part of its strategy
IBO did everything it could to revitalize the edgy part of gundam so cutting haros makes sense
I think so yeah
Black History is the term for the repeating cycle of war that turn A is built on
I feel like it's been pretty constant since SEED
well it doesn't exist in UC shows much because haro is typically amuro's haro
lmao it's fucking zambot 3, I forgot about that
drifting in space
in Astray, Lowe finds what looks like a core fighter and salvages his AI companion, 8, out of it
remember that brief period of time where SEED was trying to establish itself as being part of the black history and amuro's rx-78 computer was an actual talking character
it's amazing that crossbone still doesn't have an anime because it already has a goddamn soundtrack
yeah
I think Wing Gundam's the most famous cameo but there's so much there
*so fun*
searching for cameos in the final Devil Gundam Colony episodes is
the art does do one great thing though
I think G's emotional writing is superb but its production value is definitely that of a struggling company that's banging out a new gundam every year
yeah, fair
Sazabi was like 21m?
CCA stuff was large
I mean that's pretty accurate to the timeline
I liked the lore reasoning behind shrinking them in F91/V but it's pretty hard to deny that them doing it past that is anything other than using less plastic per mold
~~which is why F91 through X has mobile suits 3/4 the size~~
it was definitely the age of bandai and sunrise doing what they could to save money
it's *extremely* bad quality in spots - rewatch episode 4 sometime - and there's basically no budget for fights - everything's settled in one or two hits, except for some real standout scenes like Domon vs Sai Saichi in the finals
though it did have that weird homoerotic scene while working on the mobile armor, that was pretty different
imo
0083 is not good except visually
I really am
I'm sorry Cypher
that turns people *into* newtypes
telepathic fairy dust
I should
I've actually never watched the recaps
*checks bank account*
oh I see, this actually is a component-based one
you can afford to do a better sculpt when it's just a statue
Maybe not, the chogokin gaogaigar is fully functional with transformations etc

they also have easier access to songs
but AKB0048 is unlike most idol shows that it has this... weird... guerilla fighter overlay
there's only a few episodes that really feel like CGDCT
AKB0048 is maybe the exception

I'm good thanks
3 bath scenes in 2 episodes
I wanted to give prilya a chance but
Layzner is good
Oh I love 'Welcome to the S.N.K.'!
To anything

Masaki isnt
*mainline srws
Its been a major factor of like 5 out of the last 6 srws
They need to lay off parallel world plots
I guess but
This game was whack, pretty sure it was the same one with hatsune miku as a pilot
https://youtu.be/7DuXkmGQJMM
Which has been in before
I think the best bet is a time travel plot or something and then you also include sd musha gundam
Yeah
Its the gundams and valks and space operas
Original units aren't the problem
Masaki isn't the problem
They were a bit more experiemental
If only they still did 3ds titles you'd have a chance to see it there
Nobunaga the fool has an ok chance, the major thing that would prevent it is the setting
Go play the newly translated og psw game instead imo
*ok*
Its
Like
https://youtu.be/i0yXxJHxnDk
Divine wars is kinda shoddy with bad cg, inspector looks like trash with the hand drawn animation
X is the only non-OG appearance in 20 years unless you count the villain version
He's in almost no srws after classic timeline, and in fact his biggest appearance since is as a villain
Broly's kind of a placeholder
Edward has a *Character* with a capital C
but that's kind of my point
sasuke, light, etc
fangirls in the 00s were all over annoying brats
yeah
(also, as good as the broly movies are, broly himself is about a fifth the character Edward is in terms of being memorable, charismatic, and making an impression)
it's worth mentioning that FMA was at its peak popularity in terms of relative market share after the original bones anime rather than brotherhood
I really think to say that Broly was Vic's defining role means you were not involved in the western anime community in the 2000s
not even 'a' main character, *the* main character
(and even more naruto and death note, but...)
I think there was a point where if you went to an anime convention you would see more FMA cosplay than DBZ
FMA at its peak was not that much lesser than DBZ, and being a main character supersedes being a guest character, even a famous one
and then he did it again 8 years later or whatever
but he was also the main character of one of the most popular dubbed shounen anime of its time
Alright
It's such a bad way to conclude the best build up in the show
Gohan post-cell is the biggest reason I just wish it ended at cell
they better, considering they bankrolled it
Maybe, I just think that for cgdct, moe has to be a central selling point
New game is what cgdct looks like in the workplace
Tarou gets more screentime than half the donut 5
I dunno, I don't think that's an easy comparison to make
Especially since it's an ensemble cast and most of them aren't girls
That feels really misrepresentative
Its also one of the best shows of the decade
Neither, it's a workplace drama with cute girls
why did it die so hard
rie's career is so weird
victory to show class
is that the gay haircut one
ash like snow is the best op of 00 though
kills me
which just
because of the line 'my feelings over their airspace'
daybreak's bell is memorable to me
every joke event in this trailer basically happens either in s2 or the movie
this is the best piece of footage gundam has ever produced
yes
if they're still into it after that I'd move to the eyecandy works, 0083 and Unicorn, and then move from there
I'd put 0079 and 0080 on it, and then, and only then, if they come back for more, would I put Zeta and CCA on it
but I wouldn't even put it on a list of "here's the first few gundam shows you should watch"
you wouldn't
it's just not going to be on any "you have to watch this" list I give to people not sure if they're going to like gundam in the first place
(the benefit of being a single movie is that it'd have to be really awful to not be worth 2 hours of your time)
CCA's hardly a terrible entry in UC
most discussion about it acknowledges that it exists more for sunrise to cash in on the char/amuro confrontation everyone wanted to see more than as a story element that really works
anyway even aside from Char's questionable motives, the hathaway and Quess plotlines aren't exactly primo gundam writing and CCA just isn't universally praised by any means outside of the mechanical designs and animation
TV is still good but I'd always recommend movies to people who aren't sure if they're going to like it instead
<@!155340660738621440> general polish, huge step up in animation quality, they remove plotlines that don't really matter, they remove gimmicks that were just there to sell toy-maker executives (like the gundam having tank and jet forms), tighter writing
no? Char's objective in CCA is more or less the opposite of his Dakar speech
people literally have a theory that Char got brain damage after Zeta because otherwise CCA doesn't make sense
UC fans will be the first to tell you CCA's story sucks lmao
I have definitely met people who didn't like zeta!
like, I think they're good but those are the only two I think have something close to universal appeal and impact
the rest of UC is a matter of taste
0080 is good
0079 (movies) is good

s2 it goes out the window and it just feels like regular gundam again
at least for s1
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but OGs got tled so anything is possible someday I guess
no it's not
which is the only way you'll get much use out of monsha because GM Customs do not fucking cut it when you have shit like Shin Getter and GaoGaiGar and Freedom running around
you can do it in alpha 3 too
not you, him
~~horrible taste~~
like, I remember the blonde test dude from igloo better
I feel he is
actually is kou the most forgettable UC protag
Unicorn is a little bit better than 0083, Narrative is way worse
outside of the visuals
because I think it's terrible lmaooo
and if you 'but 0083' me I will cry
no, I mean entry as an animated work
I'm not budging on my stance that 0080 is the single best gundam production though
you need to understand the basics of OYW first
0080 is a great second show to watch but I agree
origin adds pre-v stuff
aside from the weird guntank from igloo which isn't really an MS
Federation did not have *any* MS before project V
...yes
biggest one is origin bullshitting that feds had way more MS development than they did prior to project v
yeah mostly they just didn't want to be pinned down by it, and origin's tech directly contradicts other OYW stuff
including casval's backstory
as long as you remember it's not canon
origin is an okay start
Well, goal at least. Her motivation is eh.
Dark grasper is the best villain and has a better motivation and goal than any other cast member
Guess who didn't hire a sensitivity agent

Nova is gundam 00 s1 but with a super robot
OG is basically a war story with a super robot
Its a different kind of story
It is, as far as fans can tell, unrelated
It will improve it slightly and there's one character voiced by the protagonist of the first show
You do not need to watch the first dancouga for it
Dancouga nova is decent fun but don't expect to really take much away long term other than Obari animation references
this really explains aquarion tbh
my opinion on kannazuki is it's mediocre mecha content and it's toxic lesbian rep
fuck the flute scene
I get it
as someone who's transitioned I've asked family members to get rid of old photographs
there's a video about it... yesterday?
digi's transitioning and has said "save my shit because I no longer want my old stuff on my channel"
fyi.
just
that's getting deleted soon
the cityscape
really? "shiny and round and chrome and glowing holograms" is like, 2010s scifi standard
and generic scifi look
asterisk kinda looked like the epitome of light novel genericness, to me
idk it just feels a lot like even if he doesn't have autism, his writing's done by someone who knew someone who did have it
he doesn't really click with social norms and the only way he can really communicate is with non-standard methods
also am I like the only person who thought it was obvious basara had autism
anything other than planet dance 20 times in a row
I think it would have benefitted a lot by using like
I can definitely say 7 drags on in the start
I am losing my goddamn mind over danball using this acronym
You mean nina isn't the best? <:HibikiCracked:748734166916661348>
Yeah I'm pretty sure there was a lot of that going on
Also, while we're on the topic, don't refer to trans people who have publically announced the pronouns they want to go by with "him/her" please
I didn't watch a ton of their content but overall I'm a little sad they moved away from anime critique
Anyway everything digi did needed to be taken with a grain of salt but their insights were interesting and their studio knowledge was helpful in assessing why some anime were the way they were
Money problems might cause stress factors that cause people to become toxic, but it's rarely the financial struggle itself
In comparison I really haven't heard of too many marriages that dissolve due to money problems?
Transitioning breaks a *lot* of relationships
I think it's far more likely she left because digi came out of the closet
I think the imagawa series is 2004
Wdym they're just friends who sleep together and raise a daughter
Planetes is one of the best adaptations I've ever seen, and it's radically different from the manga, even if it captures the essence
improve it, change it so it works better as 22 minute animation rather than a series of 20 page collections of still images
I feel like one of the strengths of an adaptation is the chance to *iterate* on the source
This still bothers me, it only makes sense if ||he was trying to traumatize shinji/anno is a hack||
Yes, it's pretty, but please don't make mangas literal flip books
I remember getting irritated at one punch man devoting entire chapters to less than 3 seconds of events
Its a sequel to robotech's version of sdf which is 90% the same
Lexi if you like sdf I might suggest trying to find or emulate a copy of robotech battlecry
Max is such a baller

bugbots
*other characters* use mecha as force multipliers to have agency
but
true iski
mechas being flesh puppets is pretty solidly established by Evangelion
most people who bring up attack on titan is mecha refer to the fact that some titans have people pop out of them
maneuver gear would qualify as a really primitive power-armor type device I think
or are powered armor
plenty of mecha are only like 3m tall
*Definitely* not true
they grow and become giants
you would, but it's all internal magic, isn't it
Madoka's closer though
I think both madoka and attack on titan violate my definition, as does most Ultraman
You can kill 3 people instead of 1
A gun does not allow you to act on a scale significantly larger than you can without the gun
the fact that the force multiplier does not belong to them, like magic might, is integral
'characters using an *external* force multiplier to have agency at a scale much larger than they would be otherwise capable of'
I forgot an important aspect
OH
and I think it's 'characters using a force multiplier to have agency at a scale much larger than they would be otherwise capable of'
so I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out the best umbrella definition for mecha
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
no there's also transformers
yeah okay twintail might be the worst thing I enjoyed, even the production was kinda eh and it has no ending
actually initial d might be the worst thing I like, when it's good its good but it's often not and I still absolutely don't understand what the fuck the author was going for in the enjo kosai arc
and bad execution with concepts you like
Decent execution with bad concepts
it can be both
I'm 2 eps from finishing Wars and it's pretty shit
W is not on my favorite list though I still somewhat enjoy it lol
so it's really hard to say anything on my favorite list is 'bad'
production and writing quality is almost always a key factor in whether I like a show or not
The problem is I pretty much never like anime purely on premise/plot
except I think danball senki s1 is legitimately good and just has a young audience and stupid premise so idk
idk, danball senki s1?
trying to think of the worst show I like
yes
tamaki just worked with them so much early on I thought he was
oh, my apologies
also I'm curious what gender the actor behind the vtuber is? I know hololive has a member that looks like a girl but is really a boy except they're voiced by a girl
solo you're like 10 minutes late for that
brain powerd, for all its flaws, is about meat robots
oh right
it's the 'haha gender roles are great' anime
I haven't gotten to it yet (was put off by the large number of people eager to move on from remembering the show existed after it finished) but it's not uncommon
did they actually watch all of yugioh before that because most of the filler arcs in OG were fucking awful
if you pay attention to production, yeah, it's god awful
sidestories that have mild-to-no-impact on the main storyline
some are gaidens but they're all in the same universe
kind of
there are, but they're all one story
it's a really clever and intelligent story but it's also frequently absolutely terrible
gatari is the best series you can't ever recommend to people
(though her motivation is stupid)
she should have won
dark grasper is the most relatable villain
that means you have less episodes to sell to stations for syndication
why would you want to do that
it seems like a mad acid trip
I really need to watch shinkalion
yes it does
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek9nVb1Bw8U
miku fought godzilla
it did
*waves cane*
sexting etc used to be known as ERP/Erotic Role Play
back in ye olde days
I could not stop giggling over this though
Danball Senki Wars is the worst show I've watched in a while that wasn't outright terrible
because ever since the 2000s he's stuck really, really firmly to set proportions, even the degrees the legs are set apart
katoki in particular can be really bad about all of his stuff feeling like the same 'skeleton'
or both
allergy to okawara or allergy to katoki
what you probably dislike is probably either
DS9 was a great series, but it seems to have taught the wrong lesson
~~honestly at this point it seems like a better timeline to work with~~
Its far more likely to have similarities to roddenberry's series than picard or most of discovery
I don't see that it isnt
it's not unwatchable but there's not a lot of s1 in it
unifying the countries and dropkicking aeolia's plan out the window just made s2 feel like Just A Gundam Show
assuming the success of s1 was from glowy robots doing trans am, which I think was probably only about 30% of its draw
I think 00 s2 is just largely a massive mistake
Except there's even less nuance to them
Finding project ako masters is cool
kyoani didn't look particularly good back then
ngl
people had moved to digital animation but didn't really have mastery over it
it didn't start really recovering outside of OVAs until 07
ugly and garbage
animation in mid-2000s was just
it's not just the art style
yeah that'd suck
I think that's the classmate ep
shinji screams a lot
it's only like a maybe 4 hour read?
honestly if you want, just buy the VN
it doesn't have the depth the others do because it's so short but I felt that has its own strength
Planetarian's my favorite and the OVA was actually a super good adaptation
clannad/kanon are the definitive KEY misery pornos
that one fucking scene in shirobako assassinates me everytime
end of eva is deeply disturbing but not emotionally wrecking imo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4CCCGYyn30
I don't think any of them looked particularly good
the Key anime, Full Metal Panic, and haruhi;
it was good *enough* rather than good
I don't think clannad looked exceptional or even particularly good
fairly positive seed+destiny still outdo 00 in gunpla? not sure though
though the last time they did that was a half decade ago
the joke is they announced a SEED movie back in like 2007 and they keep saying they're working on it
excited to see this after the SEED movie
||the initial appearance of exia is fucking great though, I love the first exia repair and its broken ass face||
this is a lot more subtle but you can just see a few bits that are designed to be easier to animate
exia in s2
exia in s1
Virtue and Seravee is another good comparison point of erasing details
they cover up cables and lower details
no, compare Exia and Exia Re:2
compare Exia and 00
even the gundams
The new designs have so many fewer details
which is reflected in the mechanical design
I bring up animation quality because s2 is designed from the start to look more mediocre
it goes from really solid stuff to passable
from plot to character writing to animation quality to mechanical design
I mean doesn't that describe all of 00s2
"what do we do this season? what was the last thing we did?"
"the gay haircut fujoshi bait thing"
"oh right. fuck we can't top that. don't even try. put some flowers on dead gundams and call it a day"
MS-based interplanetary drive system*
the SEED universe has a interplanetary drive system but there's basically no realism in terms of g forces or time it takes
I think the next best UC craft is 10g
but it never does because the predecessor craft that tested the drive system killed the pilot
V2 Gundam can pull 20gs of acceleration
this is one area that some gundams do actually do well
there's basically turning on a dime going on
setsuna would be dead the first time it activated
if we're to actually translate the trans am afterimage movement as real motion
also I dunno if you should actually be taking the gs its pulling to be actual force
and there's minimal tension
(again, gen 3 trans am)
it drains the suit
trans-am definitely wouldn't work though
I don't think I've ever seen a single gundam production that acknowledges actual orbital mechanics outside of setting notes
I think it's pretty safe to say 00 raiser can do whatever 00 raiser wants
I'm only talking about the gen 3 gundams here, mind you, rather than giving a shit what twin drive magic bullshit can do
I think maybe it would be possible but not reasonable to do; like, it might take days
it's not going up that's the hard part
...yes, and they'd have to do the same for orbit
not >1g
that's enough to argue that they have 1g acceleration
maybe it could accelerate in slow stages but idk
I'm not sure that even one with a TD blanket has enough output to get to orbit?
GN drives are always producing particles but those get stored for later use in reservoirs
also I'm not sure gundams have >1g perpetual acceleration
I'm sure you could shove like 12 in something and get to orbit
late 00 stuff has MAs that run off of like 6 tau drives at once
one MS sized tau drive does not no
they're just batteries with special qualities
tau drives aren't actually powerplants, after all
though generally there's no point in doing so
there's no reason you can't link tau drives to a spacecraft
considering not even gundams can get to space under their own power, no, I don't think *Tau Drive MS* can get to space under their own power
seed is the lifeblood of bandai
||I honestly hate innovades aside from ribbons and... anew I guess. I hate their existence as the villains. it's so trite compared to s1.||
but it's also worth noting that bandai has made like 40 variations on the zaku model so they clearly sell well.
I do want to clarify that these are observations of *tendencies* I have noted and that the works, both as a whole and as individuals, should be judged with a lot more nuance rather than taking a picture from this alone
for unicorn, yeah
not on an internal level
but I can't really recall anything else that examines it before that
Unicorn *definitely* revealed/retconned that there was some like illuminati-type shit going on in the federation way back when that wanted to fuck over the colonies and imperialistically enslave them forever to the federation
There were leaders that were dicks, one of the main generals was overall a pretty okay guy, that kind of thing
we never really saw much about internal federation politics in MSG itself, at least, outside of the military
which was the ww2 analogy
Zeta is after MSG
but the secret police force they greenlit has way too much power and eventually stops giving a shit
Zeta's somewhat nuanced about that - eventually it kinda comes out that the federation ruling body is kind of more moderate and reasonable and can be worked with
doesn't stop them from filling Zeon with noble soldiers every spinoff though
but the Zabi family's actions are still bad
they've now completely made the first part a righteous thing the colonies were *owed*
the initial part was always like "well hm federation wasn't treating them right but was mass war with nukes really the answer?" but the latter part was always easy to condemn
the initial independence movement and the ideological hijacking of it by the Zabi family to turn Zeon really evil
there's like two parts to Zeon
also I do want to elaborate slightly
they make it a lot easier for fans to say "Sieg Zeon! :D" to each other
it's just
I mean, Zeon is still Bad
but Zeta had them turn into overprotective autocrats with a fascist police force, and subsequent gundams have blackwashed them to make Zeon seem more noble
it was just a, like, the story would sometimes do a "hm sometimes both sides can be shitty" thing
in MSG
federation wasn't *that* evil
this is the kind of thing I'm talking about
it wasn't in any setting documents prior
this is all completely made up and new for Unicorn
literally the entire driving plot of Unicorn is ||the revelation that the original federation charter promised the colonies independence when they were ready for it and wanted it, and all subsequent copies of the charter somehow had this clause editted it out and no one knew better??? and the major macguffin of the story is one of these original copies with the clause as proof that zeon's cause was just||
to justify the war
they've been retconned to *be* that bad
they're incompetent and they treated the colonies badly but they're not like apartheid bad
that bad
original gundam they're not
as retcons
and... the last 40 years, with Zeon being so popular, saw a lot of additional gundam properties do their best to make the colonies 1) cooler, 2) more noble, 3) more justified
MSG did make a big deal that there were respectable soldiers on both sides though
they did shit like gas one of their own colonies to drop it on australia
not in MSG
that got radicalized by a faction that took control of a better ideology
with the somewhat-badly treated colonies being post-ww1 germany
is basically a expanded retelling of WW2
the one that most gundams reflect
the original MSG
or fighting against space-based terrorists
no I'd argue most gundams are about a war between colonies and earth
Zeta's about a bunch of scrappy ~~terrorists~~ freedom fighters going against the earth government and their autonomous, fascist peacekeeping force
the understanding bit?
it was always planned to be a two season show though
I don't understand why 00 has a season of fantastic intrigue and drama and then just shoves it in the trash and goes "what if we redid zeta"
it was just an excuse to show off the memento mori
man, thinking back, the only part of s2 I really liked was the ||elevator coup|| arc and that never went anywhere
I just remember enjoying it
the fat commander was my favorite part of s2
bring stabbity
the one axed because either sunrise or bandai didn't want amuro to be a deadbeat dad
BC was based on the original script for cca right
his voice actor (also does tuxedo mask) long ago said he got type cast really badly after MSG/other gundams and wouldn't ever take another role in gundam again outside of amuro unless he got to be a villain and work against the type cast
||it's fine to have ribbons be a ham because he's amuro and his existence in the show at all is fanservice||
flip flappers is so good and I love everything about it except for bu
<a:FlipFlapping:817946812509323275>
I think you should back off a tad on this because you're the only one bringing up the harassment
ngl the way it's handled in the source material is definitely uncomfortable
I guarantee you whatever dumb joke you want to crack, valvrave has already proven itself to be several times more dumb
no I think they were german
shame the game was boring
blue reflection anime
huh
man I just realized I haven't heard anything about pluto since 2019
sankaku is the breitbart of otaku 'reporting'
watching Fate drive through a magitech city of rectangular boxes did a lot to kill hype
though, again, a lot of this is the fault of a combination of budget and animation technology
it's 7 episodes of worldbuilding in an honestly not that great world up to that point
like, the first actually important plot beat is *episode 8*
it had neat ideas and cool mecha references but the directing and pacing was much worse
s1 was really scraping the barrel for the first half
it goes down to 7 or maybe even a little lower than that
if I'm including s1 (especially TV) and Strikers, yeah
nanoha also was kinda weak on stuff like theming compared to madoka, at least I thought so
and coupled with not really getting a strong budget, it suffers for it
it had the misfortune of coming out at the worst time in animation history
or not style, but technology
competent, made me feel things at times, but was held back, largely by things like art style
like an 8/10 show for me
the best nanoha gets is As which is
madoka TV seemed infinitely better put together than Nanoha to me
wow I don't think it's really a competition
between madoka and nanoha?
The way the fights/major drama resolution bits were so intentionally stilted and theatrical made it feel like I never got to know them, just the facade the story gave me
I also never really clicked with the cast
Probably majorly because they burned their budget
I think it's a very impressive work that doesn't stick a landing
Kinda mixed on revue
<:Spray:687873181993926744>
Frontier has its pluses even if I don't like the direction mechanical design went
II is really nice and the vf1ss is sexy
I think it stops following parody law real fast when you start selling stand figures and merch
I also think there's probably an issue with aot in particular substituting brutality and shock value for emotional connection in making you think "wow that was powerful"
journey to the west had monsters of the week lmao
like when you come across those things that imply conflict-based writing is a western thing and 'eastern' writers do without it
there is a bit of orientalist idealism sometimes
I didn't get past the first season so I'm not going to say it's bad but the takes that it's the best animation work, or serial work at all, that has ever been written on this green earth are a little hard to choke down
and how to more accurately do a parody of the genre without literally falling into it
mob psycho was a really good way to learn from the mistakes of opm
I always think welcome to the NHK lmao
because, like a fool, I always click on it and am reminded there are people who consume shounen and consider it the pinnacle of all writing
can't wait for snk to end so I stop seeing it trending on twitter
basically everything Caster is a snoozefest
UBW has 3 really good scenes but the rest of the route felt much more dull
I actually think Fate is better than UBW <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
so yeah, you're missing the complexity
if all you do is watch the anime, I'm not really sure you have a good window into this
shirou's definitely got complexity
I just think it's telling that the comments I see about armin or eren or whatever on twitter talking about how complex they are look exactly like comments about bts members
idk
twists = good writing only really works when you end on the twist
I feel like evangelion, because the hype you hear about it is incredibly mixed and both positive and negative, how it's both genius and way overstated and I think that's the most honest introduction you can get to it
is the joke really that good when it's made every time this conversation happens for the last 10 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wos24wJjqWA
have this instead
I will
there was really cute sprite art of sachiel in super robot pinball but I can't find a screenshot of it and I don't have a rom on my machine
also I think most eva angel designs are wonderful and pretty cute
(madoka spoilers) ||Madoka is a fundamentally positive show, where eva is a fundamentally negative show unless you have a *very* positive impression of the final episodes||
had actual magic in it
the original OVA was so good
if being voiced by kaiba is a big deal go watch flipflap
Perfect ZX3
technically they did
though with the drawback that you have to use specific LBXs
pretty sure yeah
remember how big a deal formation attacks were in wars, for all of one episode <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
its use in W (or lack thereof) was pretty garbage but that sums up the anime's use of every gameplay gimmick after s1
I like sigma orbis a lot
Odin was the best design from the show <:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
like compare them to Achilles and they don't look like they belong in the same universe
Wars' weird CGI is partly due to stuff like the dot blastrizer and dot phasor are waaaaaaaaaaay overdesigned?
for s1 it really works because they look like toys
with killer droid etc
though W starts pushing it
I think the CGI for s1 and W look pretty great
I actually disagree
haha look he's overconfident of his skill and bad at literally everything other than (show gimmick) except it turns out he has a super power, how unexpected
but in that really irritating baseline shounen character way that you know could have easily been better
fine
sure, he's
er, Arata, yeah
I don't think Amata ever really hit likeable for me
with a worse cast, too
I thought Wars was really bad, especially in comparison to the others
I mean, if you like it fine
~~don't do wars~~
danball senki + danball senki W, if you're allowed multiple seasons
what about franchises
do sequel seasons count
what counts as a show
legend of galactic heroes
speaking of which I wonder
yeah, you don't get second chances if you fail to deliver the on-air tape
no thank you
but
I respect them for trying to do this when they are clearly not fluent in either language
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
no no I do not
hmmm
do I go with shit subs
<a:chrishake:824435797280686110>
Where the objective was to make people tune in the following week
From the outside (haven't watched it yet) it reminded me of geass r2
is there a good sub out?
if you spoil the movie for me so help me god
<:catknife:656050349278232579>
I have a feeling the game partly sucked due to engine problems
Anime should do fine
It was a really pretty game but really sterile
But I like the idea
Only flaw is they should have used catchier names
Have the true names be something you have to unlock
Give codenames instead of true names
I mean I think there are alternate solutions
You're assuming the VN is eternally a past work, when people are coming into the franchise all the time
She'll always be rider to me
It does a lot to ruin the source material
I'm still mad at fgo for referring to servants by true name
Aaaaaa
there's basically an entire missing movie of content
makes 3 all the more disappointing because it's pretty much completely unrelated to 2
2 is the best yeah
It's alright, I get it was meant light heartedly and this was just a reminder to consider others
You can, of course, talk about stuff that's on topic here, but do consider that you can be "on topic" and still violate server rule 1: "don't be a dick"
People on this server have generally been really tolerant of kamen rider's fans here, considering how overwhelming chatter about the franchise can get, and has gotten, in spaces that are not kamen rider spaces, and drowning out conversations of other users.

I find it a joke in really poor taste that mocks the fact that people have had to put up with it to such an overwhelming degree that the server had to be restructured.
https://youtu.be/MmRzrwOsfYY
Basically every idol and/or gatcha falls under that
For shows/games where you're trying to sell as many girls as merch as possible, yeah
Bananice
It would be more accurate if they quoted rocky horror picture show once an episode though
I was a theater tech so I was like "yeah they were that pretentious"
It did feel like symphogear, but worse though
Revue is highly pretentious but I didn't think it was awful
I've always had this feeling that Imaishi made GL partly to one-up it
I don't think trigger would work on gunbuster even if they had it
aoi trying to sound seductive and adult
I still think shuten douji sounds terrible <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
in this case no one would assume you're about to spoil a completely different show
you do if it's a spoiler and you need to label what you're spoiling if it's not obvious
I'm glad he did it and I'm glad he got fucked for it
but 2.0 is about Shinji killing the world to save a girl
I mean sure
it's good but I'm kinda glad Shinji got punished for doing what he thought was right
I'm mixed on 2.0
he put shots of hate mail written to him into the End of Evangelion movie
he's certainly cared before
this one goes a lot deeper than that and I'm unsure to what extent he's telling the truth

idk if you meant for this to be a gotcha but it's still highly unusual for her
Asuka's way too broken of a person for me
lol
Yes, there was a lot of denial by some posters on /a/ iirc
so we end up with this kinda weird canonical mess that eventually had to be tossed in the trash and laughed nervously off as a fictional retelling
like the whole project felt like to me a spiteful "well this is how *I* would have done it" after he was shut out of Macross II
It's absolutely beautiful but the plot beats aren't quite as good as TV and it has a faint tinge of Kawamori trying to overwrite canon because he wishes he was in charge
I'm mixed on DYRL
also imo build needed a fucking break, jeez
*beam confuse is fucking stupid*
also
also the new footage is kinda jarring
unlike original MSG there's no real way to condense zeta and keep everything important
okay
zeta films are
I'll keep that in mind
but I've also heard literally nothing about them
I suppose I haven't heard anything bad about them
honestly though another amuro/char movie could maybe go to bat against big boi movies
like the ideas were okay but it was directed so badly
kinda sucked
isn't his last work g-reco?
idk
he's just kind of a distant dick to everyone
he's not the worst harem lead but he's maybe more directly irritating
but Alto's just
the two girls are *okay*
honestly Macross F has the problem of literally every character in the cast being really awesome except for those that count as 'main characters'
macross F means putting up with Alto
It's really weak in pairing them together romantically imo
I think a lot of people going "oh mako/ryuko is canon" are people who see them going on a date at the end and not realizing that dates are completely different concepts in japan
regarding KLK I actually don't think it's all that lesbian
Delta's due, I guess
also Macross has been almost a nonshow in SRW for a while
It's doable, but America doesn't have the market for it
and make sure you're kosher with everyone
it's such an absolute bitch to track down who owns the rights outside of japan, who has distribution rights, who has *merchandise* rights
maybe 6 companies, mostly
let's say
In japan the rights to robot anime are held by like
hahaha no, it wasn't harmony gold stopping them
That's probably an agreement with Harmony Gold
it doesn't include SDF Macross or DYRL
WEIRD
I guess it does? 93?
does it include Macross II
the big question
wait
I'm just wondering if we're going to get another downer ending, or if urobuchi has been adequately tamed by capitalism
baiten kaitos 3 never <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I think the nastiest part of the stats in Fate/Stay Night is they only start to make sense when you have access to every servant's stat block
Fuck if I know, but Saber has it
"what does magic resistance A mean"
stupid uses of RPG stats is even used by some of the most high profile VNs of all time <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
to be fair the isekai writers
also
~~again, they're grasping because they're typically amateurs~~
it is not a *visual* genre
RPG stats are used because isekais are a *written* media and the authors are grasping for communicative imagery
This is actually a really relevant point
The isekai boom was hugely thanks to amateurs getting into the LN market, especially after SAO
> I think the problem is that a lot of them is that they reallllllly like to use rpg stats without being fun with them and instead just be powerwank 

the RPG stats thing is a crutch in general, but the decision to write an isekai is generally already because the writer needs a crutch. You write an isekai because you want to make the ultimate reader appeal, and have the ultimate viewpoint character that you can explain everything to
I personally think that isekais are typically bad writing and a shortcut to expressing an idea without bothering to lay groundwork to get the reader invested in
It's not "why are isekais bad" but "why are YA popular? here's why, isekais do the same thing"
The rest is, fine? The points weren't brought up in the discussion as criticism, but as a comparison to YA novels which sell and get popular through similar mechanisms
*especially* in the fancontent channel
I didn't understand what you were going for initially, but if I see you try to grade people's opinions again, we're going to have a talk, Digi
I'm blown away by this
https://youtu.be/l-TJm7HkzkQ
decent stuff
firefly is alright
the plot revolves around being an isekai
that's the key difference
bookworm actually uses the premise
rarely does an isekai's key plot actually revolve around the knowledge and experience of someone coming from another world
almost all of the time
Anyway, I just firmly believe that while of course you can build a good story that includes someone isekai'd, you could have built a better story in the same setting that didn't
~~this is so they can get paid for 12 pages but only work hard enough for 9~~
and stats only come up to the point that the MC is a pansy who doesn't fight and has to be protected
.hack/sign has abilities almost never come up
.hack's a really interesting case
if it's not a videogame, putting it in videogame terms, to me, shows the writer's limitations
yeah
then yes, mechanics work
unless you're talking specifically about videogame based stories
but that it pulls from the same pool of myths and ideas that dragon quest did
"dragon quest like world" doesn't really mean it's based on dragon quest
I don't agree with that
it's why he's never in actual danger ~~more bad writing~~ for half the first 'story'
yeah kirito's stats are relevant
so I don't really draw a distinction between stats and skills
SAO makes it work for the obvious reason that it is a game, but using game mechanics to explain the world is shitty shortcut writing in the general case
I mean, stats and skills are interchangeable here - we're being gated through gamer terms
though I don't think SAO is ever dumb enough to use *numbers*
there's also the fact that the genre-popularizing work revolved around Kirito minmaxing stats, making them story relevant
this idea is why a lot of isekai *sucks*
"I don't know how to explain this idea of a world I have so I'm going to explain it to a character who wasn't born in it that the reader can identify with" - budding author
of *course* the core concept can be used well
of *course* there are good entries
Because the *general* case for isekai is bad
Isekai is a vehicle for new writers to try to land a LN publishing deal, there's a lot about the modern concept that discourages good writing
Lexi, that's exactly my point
because while going "god I love being technically correct" is fun, it's not useful for examining common flaws and trends
it's important to actually consider the obvious modern genre of isekai as a thing that isn't synonymous with "someone goes to a different world"
I think for the purposes of this conversation
So
this is only half the story, though; LNs get so involved with setting up an arc to start, develop, and conclude every volume (or two) that so many times they lose a structure from beginning to end
There's obviously appeal to what it does - but I don't think it's a coincidence that I can't think of any isekais with a complete animated story
Isekai represents ideas and characters that get shot off like firecrackers
to me, generally it's the gimmick genre
People who are competent at scenes but maybe not planning or structure
and again, I think that comes from the genre's roots as being the go-to way to break into the market as an amateur web novelist
yeah, honestly, my experience is most isekais get so involved with introducing side ~~waifus~~ characters that they lose their own plot anyway
most isekais, the plot revolves around the MC's power, which doesn't have to come from being reincarnated from the modern world
'girls are cute, we don't need anything else' was the breakthrough
yeah but that predates even haruhi; 'girls are cute, sell that' goes to 80s at minimum
because the bar to entry on writing them is lower than other genres
There's endless LNs you can adapt for a season
Again though, isekai is particularly tenacious because it's so self-sustaining
~~I could be living in a world where Shirobako created a career drama boom <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000> ~~
who knows what's next
Haruhi created the moe boom, SAO created the isekai boom
We're due in a few years
But, like, *so* many isekai works use the reincarnation idea as an excuse to have a tabula rasa protagonist, sometimes with a gimmick power, rather than have it be the massive cultural shock blast that such a powerful plot move should be, imo - though, again, stuff like Bookworm or Maoyuu does it. (Maoyuu isn't isekai, but it does the same idea of using modern day knowledge to impact a fantasy world)
The motives of these authors isn't something I criticize
yeah, that part I have nothing against?
it'll still be the end of the year before the BD
well, I guess it's this month now
the movie comes out next month, so... october?
lmao
PPB punches are neat but they're all just homages to the OG
definitely pinpoint barrier at its best
I'm just a little sad we lose the daedalus punch move because that's lowkey one of the most brilliant moments in the franchise

<@!782841825069236236> I have discovered the strongest mecha warship
~~not a fan personally~~
Real talk, doing your day-to-day business on a non-admin account is smart, even if a little more tedious
üëµ
I feel so old
God it has an anime?
Negima also has a sequel series I haven't read
It's kind of like haruhi is one of the 25 most important anime ever made in terms of shaping the industry but it rarely gets mentioned now
But yeah, negima used to be a big deal, it's just old
Asuna is a watered down Narusegawa and the way love Hina goes off the rails is pretty comparable to negima
Love Hina was basically the prototype
Yes
Yeah Asuna isn't horrible it's just literally everyone else has something super cool to their personality
Jack rakan is basically genjuro
Basically everyone is a total baller
Negima had fucking amazing characters ~~aside from asuna~~
There's definitely degeneracy but it's not that bad
Negima is like a 4/10 on the degenerate scale
Legit the only complaint I have about negima is Asuna is the most boring cast member yet she has the role she does
I don't think any manga I've read was as much fun as the negima school festival mega arc
Negima is legit my favorite shounen manga
Manga is better, I think, unless the movies I heard about finally did it justice
What did you get? Are you a degenerate? <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I read the manga for a while and eventually dropped it
I mean my favorite key work is planetarian so I'm already holding some hot opinions
It's still key faces but slightly toned down
Even haruhi has bad faces imo
Technique is seperate from art direction here
Yeah kyoani was an exception and I'm going to guess someone inhouse came up with some really nice proprietary tools
You lost the watercolor look old anime had but the digital animation sparkle didn't start showing up until 07 and later, and even then it was gradual
The tools were new and busting out good looking frames involved time and/or extra money
The mid 00s were overall pretty ugly in general in anime
As and Strikers tried to do what they could with what they had
Nanoha TV has never looked particularly good in any season unfortunately
Sure but I'm willing to not be a pedantic ass if at least the basic concept the equation represents is relevant
Yeaaaah
It does, but only when you're dealing with relativity
because everyone knows adaptations never get finished
the anime has the advantage there
||not a fan of the clickbait sensationalism vibe R2 had where it felt like shit was happening just to get you to tune in||
I liked s1
it was absolutely mental how much it was in the TV version
which has *less* pizza hut
honestly you're probably seeing the non-broadcast version
It's been a long time since I've thought about Nina and tables
It's just the gaijins make it ethnic for some reason
All animation is anime
It's not wrong to call it anime
It's weird that it never reached the heights of Voltron or robotech
Kinda curious now
I've never actually seen sb
Robotech/macross kinda thing
They're not exactly synonyms since star blazers has other stuff spliced in
Ah alright
Are you talking Yamato?
But star blazers is uh not going to get much modern traction even if you count it as anime
Or outlaw star
Star blazers is an interesting suggestion
I'd say gundam 00 for star wars
But so is basically every big breasted or little sister character in anime
I think I could argue that most if not all cartoons intended for kid consumption are greenlit with merchandising opportunities in mind
Japanese media isn't magically more prestigious than western, they're just more comfortable doing some of it animated. Pretending otherwise is just kind of a weird form of orientalism that does both sides a disservice - ignoring the capitalistic motivation of the japanese studios while acting like nobody in western animation ever tries to write meaningful content
Turns out having to restructure your studio and have projects fall behind, get cancelled, or otherwise impact release is going to financially affect an industry that doesn't really show a thick profit margin in the first place
but it sucks to be right
that he'd pass before finishing
2009
I've been predicting since like
I mean
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
Neo Zeon showing up, etc
one political 'twist' in them
anyway, most gundam series have like
but it's an interesting one
it's not a good trick
Destiny pulls an interesting trick where this time ZAFT seems like the good guys at first until *really* weird shit happens writing wise
it turns out both sides are shit so the protagonist ship splits off to form its own side in the conflict called the 'three ships alliance' of the Good Guys
yes but not in the way you think
where it turns out the federation has a distinct super racist power broker sub-group inside of it pulling strings
SEED
Typically the most complex series get is like
Wing has factions split and form and vanish repeatedly
I question how many you've watched because most are pretty straight forward, politically
Wing is ridiculous and gets lost in its own politics
yeah setsuna had two-three foils, and Exia/00, the *mech*, had its own human rival in graham lmao
idk what you want out of the show other than a sterile war story
You say you don't like politics in gundam and then you want to remove the human side
the idea of the rival pilot is in order to complete the protagonist's arc by having them put their ideas up against the embodiment of the antithesis to their ideas
anyway idk what to say about your rejection of the concept of rival pilots other than you're not a fan of actual narratives
char's counterattack
ok
CCA was really good at that
a lot of shows dodge the 'realistic' thing by having them do ranged at first but have their ranged equipment be damaged or lost over the fight
this has been your deep lore joke of the day
johnny ridden
and every main gundam has a beam sword because they're all based on samurai
then they will stand still and fire beams
also every super robot show does a lot of melee combat unless they have 0 budget
every show moves to fists or swords at some point
I'm trying and failing to think of a mecha show that doesn't have hand to hand combat
also the need to ruin UC because UC = money
Gundam's need to repeat itself and its stupid injoke ideas over the possibility of actually coming up with new ideas is one of the main reasons I'm not huge on the franchise
kira can survive someone self destructing point blank
multiple times
if heero can survive his mech self destructing
look
The robots do actually aid the environmentalist message of the show though
so you could just have a non-giant robot martial arts tournament instead
G obviously doesn't need the robots because the robots literally copy the moves of their pilots
MSG, Zeta *maybe* (you'd cut a lot out), 0080, G
There are a few shows that would hold up without giant robots but not many, I'd say like 15%
Most shows are low-average that fans enjoy because the robot action is above-average
Wing's predominent design philosophy is 90s cool
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrahCm7UIa4|| wing spoilers I guess
no that's lady une's shit with the shuttle imo
I've heard dirigibles are more energy efficient
efficiency maybe idk
I don't find most gundam protagonists to be really.... great
I typically find them the better half of gundam's writing
Wing farts out a new political wrinkle every 3 episodes
like they're not realistic at all
they're not perfect but there's documentation on how the head's fatter and wider in order to *actually fucking fit* two gatling cannons inside along with the other hardware
things in Sentinel were designed with more of a mind towards real physics and engineering concerns than most gundams
after those it's probably Victory and Shining
S gundam, Ex-S Gundam, Crossbone X-1 are at the top of the list
That's fair, though as you said, Z did have a char
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
my top favorites haven't been animated
probably #5 or 6
shining gundam is actually one of my favorite gundam designs
also shout out to the german ninja from G gundam but he does have a very good reason for that mask
for no real reason
but he just dresses like this

mr bushido maybe but at least graham has scarring
Chronicle Asher is probably the most absurd I can think of
Char was basically a displaced prince who had to hide his identity so it makes sense, but after that they're usually 'just because'
they did it for very sensible reasons in MSG, and then it became a meme they just did it for the callbacks
Gundam has never not given rival characters a mask
Graham also destroyed Exia in a model that was in service since the beginning of the show, with progressively more absurd upgrades ducttaped on
Char used a tuned up Zaku II and then later a gelgoog, which was an elite unit, but still MPed as much as Zeon could at the time
Char?
the need to put the rival in various prototypes to sell models means they have to get blown up
how CD sales made symphogear AXZ worse
but this is kinda parallel to uh
yeah
yeah, he's going to fuck everyone up and nobody in a guncannon's going to touch him
he *really is that good a pilot* and is a strong newtype to boot
MSG's char is really good here
that depends on how they set up the rivals and how they set up the teammates

lemme find it
he has an ace bonus in one of the SRWs
oh my god
he just got btfo by everyone else
I don't think patrick ever fought setsuna after s1e1
yeah they're cool
'flip up'
it's all awful and like
but
It still has it
shout out to the 1/35 garage kit
the sniper cameras in particular make me favor dynames over cherudium
they're cool but I think their predecessors are still cooler
~~all s1 units were better than s2~~

whoever wrote up the wiki wasn't thinking
even though it's rated for 56
Yes, and claiming it's firing at 12mw
from  S-gundam's page
g-cruiser isn't an external source, it's the MA form
for full power shots it has to connect to an external generator
that's not an error
but it's an *awesome* concept
and like that'd never look cool enough to be animated
they emit tiny I-fields to re-adjust their beam's trajectory after leaving the barrel, deviating up to 10 degrees, meaning they have significantly faster target acquisition
basically the giant beam cannons can be like
which is what all the little radomes you see are
I think the only other bit of really cool tech in Sentinel I wish we saw more of is the beam smart gun concept
which are bits but fucking cooler
also the s-gundam and ex-s use incoms
OH
and the pilot goes home to safety never knowing the AI even existed
the system is actually dimly self-aware and in love with the pilot, and at the end of the story it ejects the core fighter and defeats the final boss mobile armor that's trying to do earth re-entry, burning up in the process
the pilot in the story does not know this system exists and thinks the unit's just haywire sometimes, which honestly, is believable in the resource strapped miniconflict
honestly the thing that sold the S gundam to me though was the story - it has something called the ALICE system, which basically cuts in and controls the unit to protect the pilot or unit-critical systems
this is late Zeta era so it's a good 5 years after, and this particular configuration never left the drafting board
it has a battleship's beam cannon, it's faster, and honestly those are the only two things that matter
anyway yeah it's the dendrobium but better in most every way
that's the massive white spike mounted over the chest
has a better I-field
no it's actually better armored

upgrade plan was the 303E 'deep striker'
extreme
S gundam's most uh
anyway the S gundam's head is longer and fatter than most in order to recognize that yeah, it needs room
RX78 had 60mm vulcans

18m isn't *gigantic*
remember that the red panel on the chest is the cockpit hatch and isn't all that much bigger than a person
Not a lot bigger
they're about the size a person is tall
Gundam heads aren't really that huge?
the ammo's stored there too
here's the pure mobility one
the S gundam was designed to be modular - the Ex-S combines some of its mobility modules with defensive and offensive ones
but they make more of an effort
let me elaborate
physics lectures should be on every episode, though after either episode 3 or 4 you're probably better off watching them after the end of the show
just that there's another conflict with an enemy called space monsters
also this synopsis does not actually say anything about being a sequel
the play-pretend of hard physics is tossed entirely out the window
I generally say it's a spiritual sequel
It's in the synopsis they read, maybe, but an accurate synopsis of symphogear could mention kanade's death but that's not something you want a new viewer to know
yeah I think it's just a really shitty way to answer that question
like, come on
this is a spoiler fyi
~~because most adaptations are a scam and aren't as interested in delivering an enjoyable piece of media as they are in advertising the source material~~
yeah it didn't really have an ending at all
doesn't even have to be an *ending*, just something that carried weight
I dunno, I just wished the anime ended on meaningful personal growth or a meaningful climax
the jokes are good but the narrative and characters are just there to enable the jokes
I wish twintail was more than the sum of its parts
the show was 9.9/10
shirobako movie 9.4/10
I'm watching the shirobako movie right now too and yeah, wow, it's brutal
oh my god how did I never realize this

I think you'll enjoy both
no it's fine
is ok
I thought you actually had experience with the series
yeah, I understand
||it could easily have been an AU or something, like how not every gundam with mobile suits is a sequel||
diebuster spoilers ||the space monsters in diebuster are completely different from the ones in gunbuster and the fact they're connected is very not obvious||
they're usually seperate files
but they're not attached
there's one for every episode
Personally the design looks bad to me
is my guess
Eclipse Justice or something equally uncreative
looks like the hero unit is the Eclipse Gundam
https://twitter.com/hobbysite/status/1398242352582389764?s=21
~~why do that when it's almost never portrayed as a positive force~~
For seed, just reuse the TM revolution Nana song from valvrave so it can be on a good show
Too round
Well it looks good but it looks very not CE
man, I wish more robots were also cars
yeah I think that's what they were going for but

this just reminds me of LFOs
I've heard uma musume s1 is a little predictable and standard sports anime but s2 really gives it character
Iris is an antagonist in Symphogear season 5
Tamaki is hibiki
almost certainly, give me a moment
Cecil for your own sake I'd advise you to move on to a different topic, your antipathy for gay content and people who like gay content pushes the bounds of what's acceptable on the server sometimes
(yaoi is generally sexually explicit or heavy on sexual content)
(also, if we're splitting hairs, it's not yaoi, it's BL)
I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience but please be respectful of the show that other people have stated they like. You don't have to like it, but it's not satan or evil just because yuri's a guy's name in russia
takehito koyasu is takehito koyasu to me
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
it hurts me to refer to one of the most successful VAs of all time as some odd role he took 20 years into his career
that'd be like 2-300 dollars, why not just do it in game
yeah I was going to say
3k is probably generous tbh
bushiroad sees this and is like "we'll do the next symphogear box set with XDU codes" and sells 3k
and on a personal note, the way twintail's final arc plays with trans themes without ever admitting trans people exist isn't incompetently handled but never sits right with me
It also has no resolution of any kind, so if you want a complete story or narrative, it's not here
yeah
Both are also lacking a complex emotional core
both shows are extremely sexualized - the entire point of the former is to go through as many fetishes as possible, the entire point of the latter is to feature little girls in spats as much as possible
I'm not sure the comparisons made last weak of twintail and Vividred to gear are very good though
yeah, twintail isn't what you want if you want femboys
again, aoi has range I'm not convinced you'd instantly pick up
Sho Hayami is also pretty easy to pick up but I feel like you'd only do it if you watch older stuff
but he doesn't always do that
Yeah, he's distinctive when he memes out
Sugita can be hard to recognize
nah
(partially because it sounds so fucking amateur)
shuuten douji
I'd miss aoi with uh
idk
and you'll go "oh fuck it's him"
and then he'll shout
where he can be stealthy
shinichiro miki is kinda like Hiyama
he can be tough to pick out
shinichiro miki has some serious range
no matter how many famous good roles he does, he'll always be Amuro
touru furuya?
probably the role people are most likely to encounter him in now is ali al saachez from 00
so people who only watch modern stuff don't really have the exposure
due to illness and death
he hasn't really been involved in anime for 5 or so years
I feel like anyone could recognize fujikei but
I wouldn't recognize his Shapiro voice
wakamoto too, but only if wakamoto's been told to do max wakamoto
instantly recognize
him, fujikei, and hiyama are the three male VAs I can just
yeah
he was Gym
oh right
I mean, they are, but people group them sometimes
are you counting SEED and Destiny as two series
he got to be *two* chars
zechs and mwu
but it was the dub
I'd seen Wing prior to that
tbh that was the first role I heard him in cypher
I'm not actually mad at you lexi, I think it's more that it's *always* the role cited that gets me
lmao
try Yuuki kaji
very soft and passive
His yuuya haibara from danball senki is pretty different
I would not be able to tell you this was Aoi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J62F5LO1Fjw
idk, he's pretty damn known for sherlock
someone's going to have the shit character quirk
such is the curse of an ensemble cast of like 20 high school girls
yeah, I wouldn't assume they were the same person
etc
ali al saachez, holland
yeah,
I think fujikei is the one actor I could always, always, always pick out even with a short sample
like, to the point that a lot of mechanical designs in the TV show aren't canonical and one in the movie is
the definitive version of it is the compilations movies rather than the series
I'm actually surprised MSG is so high
neither do I, but I make the recommendation regardless
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05p646nlYS0
though the OP was one of 00's best
again I very much recommend reading the manga vs the series, as important plot details didn't exist in the manga when they started adapting it
that's not even close to the most fucked up part of the series, honestly, but yeah, the fights are generally relatively short compared to the chapters dedicated to kids coming to terms with the fact that they're next
piloting it means you die immediately after the fight
the major catch is
they take turns being the main pilot
about a group of kids who get kinda tricked into signing a contract to defend the earth using a robot
mid 00s series
the manga is... something else
bokurano anime your emotions get off easy
they basically fucked their version of that up, so it ended up looking like *this\*, because italics in that markup keeps going until you tell it to stop*
you know how in discord you type `*this*` to make *this*
they're the passion projects that everyone's aware is likely to fail
because original anime are rarely successful
original anime is what a studio does with the money they get from fulfilling contracts on adaptations
low
I advise watching the actual OVA sometime
It involves a long look at what's become of the school noriko graduated from and stuff
Taq was probably asking about the format of the episode itself which ||takes place 10 years after ep 5||
that's a post-episode spoiler fwiw
Fafnir is by far the closest you'll ever get without actually rewatching evangelion
If you want a *true* evangelion clone, there are some out there
That's generally my usual scratch test
Paramilitary org using kids with proprietary tech to combat otherworldly forces
Honestly, generally it's not even about thematics
I'd consider symphogear in my 'eva clone' category
even some not
'eva clone' remains a term I use to this day for a bunch of mecha
the 80s were the prime but it had a resurge late 90s-early 00s propelled by eva
I mean that most of the significant entries in it were before the 00s digital animation shift
mecha in general is an old genre , and I don't just mean that it started a long time ago
in terms of gundam or mecha? I don't remember the conversation <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
It's both a pretty pure representation of gundam and also one of the best entries in the franchise
I think the best place to start would probably be the original compilation movies
there's no pressure
just that it's not over
And it doesn't feel like it's *artistically* lacking catharsis
Also a bunch of personal arcs feel unfilled and it's missing catharsis
unless you can count 00 s1 without 00s2 which... doesn't work
but I'm not sure any have been made in the past 20 years
there's a few
Shirobako's #1 though
god I don't actually remember my rankings off the top of my head
like people ask me "is this gundam show good" and I always have to go "it's pretty good *for a gundam*"
becuase most mecha is bad if you're not interested in the mecha part
It's, I think, the only mecha series on my top 5 anime series list
o/
(yes, they actually went harder for the adaptation)
manga is a little softer
anime, at least
planetes isn't true hard sf but it's 90% of the way there
~~I think diebuster's better, personally~~
This is a big part of why not everyone loves diebuster - though it's a spiritual sequel, it's not playing the same notes as its big on 'realism' predecessor
Yeah, the second half of the show really dwells on time dilation to good effect
same guy did GaoGaiGar and G Gundam's music too
Tanaka's works are all incredible
and diebuster's OST is even better, tbh
All of gunbuster sounds amazing
it's just an alien lifeform whose way of life is inherently incompatible with humans living in the galaxy
It's honestly not explored much in lore? Like, there's no mastermind here
https://youtu.be/Ggi_XLFSG7w?t=330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jNzOD3UwDY
gunbuster's BGM is the insert song of ep 5 in SRW because it's so iconic lol
to the point that when SRW uses gunbuster, it doesn't use Active Heart, the OP as the BGM
Episode 5's sequence is legendary
I agree
MSG flopped but it started to build word of mouth excitement after broadcast
It's complex
I mean, somewhat?
Nah
Sometimes they're pointless
sometimes they're divisive, like Zeta gundam's movies with added footage drawn 20 years later
Sometimes the movies redefine the series, like for the original gundam
you're saving like 40 minutes
it's 6 episodes
If it was a 24 episode series there'd be a reason to consider
yeah, never bother with the movie
wow
it doesn't even have new frames
holy shit
> However, in 2006, a theatrical version of Gunbuster was released in Japan featuring a 5.1 soundtrack, containing new sound effects, the original score and re-recorded dialogue by the original Japanese voice actors. The feature-length film is an abridged version of the original OVA, and uses the same animated footage as the original.
It's just what you watched, only less of it
when you hear people say "the movie" in mecha discussions it's going to refer to a compilation movie cut
the movie's definitely not as good
welcome home

Anno was *heavily* inspired by older ultraman shows when making evangelion
or rather, the ultraman franchise in aggregate
The most evangelion show pre-evangelion is ultraman
I accept that it *probably* isn't intentionally racist but it's not a good look
just a race of these
this is the major antagonist force of terraformars lol
It was trapped in a pretty huge loop of introduce gimmick characters and have uncomfortably racist villains kill them
Did that manga ever get unstale
The true hidamari sketch experience
Because everyone is a maid
If you're looking for purple haired maids in mecha there's gotta be some in gravion
if we get another sakura quest I'll be so happy
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Mistborn anime...
Bern the Witch, a story about bernie sanders with featureless backgrounds
I also think sakura quest was basically flawless, just not for everyone
THey also weren't straight
Because, yeah, they weren't gay
Both shirobako and Sakura quest ended up being about concepts much bigger than one on one romantic relationships
It's generally because they have enough moving parts without romance
PA works generally isn't explicitly gay
I've never read it
the show's not done airing is it?
and bad, probably
unusual
that's
though wait it's already announced they're working on onie
new game, yeah
they're working on a game?
maybe
they're... out there
you said imagine having a mech anime with that level of quality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aYyYq5uGbc
gaogaigar?
it has almost nothing in common with s1 other than pixie dust gundams
a different show
00 s2 is just
its when it starts trying to be original that it starts having issues
SEED's actually pretty good when it's just doing its thing as a remake of 0079
both 00 and IBO suffer from the same problem of having a second season that ruins everything
tomino refuses to call it a gundam
I need to actually watch g-reco someday but I've heard it's really bad
We're finally slowly getting there with stuff like IBO (though I think the barbatos is ugly) but yeah idk
see: Zeta's plot being used 3-4 times, Char clones forcibly shoved in, inability to deviate significantly from RX-78's design
gundam as a whole is filled with "well past series did this so people want it in new gundam"
I've heard nothing indicating narrative was popular in japan
"CCA did it and people like CCA so it must be good"
I don't think anyone really enjoys newtype sparkle magic
so it revolves entirely on newtype ghosts and shit
Narrative is basically them going "let's see if we can focus on all the parts of UC people fucking hate"
Narrative is worse though
but that's probably not true
honestly, I'm tempted to even say unicorn is worse
I think I'd also rate wing as worse
~~0083 is worse~~
if anything, making everyone momentarily telepathic made more sense
SEED, Destiny, and AGE also all used it without twin drive magic and it wasn't any better
like there's always this saccharine interpretation of 'well if we could just all get along'
with magical results
every time
had a huge problem with ~\*Understanding*~ in bright sparkly letters being the central theme
00-15
gundam in like
but
movie was some neat ideas and got away from old gundam ideas
wow s2 had so many shit plotlines it's impressive
and then the first quarter of 00s2 is hal screaming MARIE over and over
like they did what they could to give him his own place but it was still fucking stupid
I think the neil/lyle thing was the most egregious of that
the end of CCA involves all sides working together to stop a colony drop
The stop the fall stuff was a subtle CCA callback
writing wise
I actually thought that the elevator coup was the one good part of 00 s2
"actually humanity's fine we just need to get rid of the illuminati and our problems are solved"
Innovedas were just such a shit conclusion to 00's ideals
hm idk
and therefore not good
your average gundam show
yeah, it's a different show that's just
Starting with an experienced protag means that growth will tend to be in more negative ways and it tends to be a more depressing show
not just battle royale, but it's particularly bad in that genre
Maybe you should just avoid battle royales in the future
But really I'd argue almost every battle royale anime works on the basis of someone underprepared joining
I'm struggling to contain my laughter considering your profile pic
the characters exist to enable plot and do some yuribaiting
regarding the earlier convo about revue
yeah I don't think I ever liked any of the characters aside from banana
right? I've had to actually get through to people that she's flawed before, it's so easy to think of her as a perfect angel
Depends on the bad sides
I think akb0048 is good at trying to do the same thing but accidentally slipping and revealing how creepy the industry innately is
Idol anime is really good at making having idol dreams seem noble
Should I skip
I was thinking of checking it out after being disappointed with the ova
The end of the movie feels fucking self-referential
PA works off to the side taking notes for shirobako s2
It's okay, and I recognize the awkwardness of things
Some condensed thought after an episode or important moments is fine, but the current way you're handling things wouldn't really permit discussion - any point someone brought up would be lost 3 minutes later
I probably should have mentioned but if you want to do a live reaction commentary that's really more in the spirit of live-shitposting rather than take 9 pages of chat
making them out of psycoframe is the dumb part
https://twitter.com/LossThief/status/1407211292855840769?s=20
wow.
I just saw footage from the spider isekai fight
If you don't want tragic stuff stay away from the franchise
Also, Madoka's a better show lol
I wouldn't
so they're not automatically detected
people adjust them slightly
this is why a lot of uploads of songs sound slightly wrong
the algorithm detects too many differences so it doesn't automatically flag
but when you, say, record a noise, but bang a pot overtop of it, is it really the same noise?
it depends and I don't have an expert opinion on the algorithm they use
don't upload stuff that belongs to other people and you'll probably be safe in the general case
I'm unsure exactly where performance rights apply and don't
and sometimes the rights holder doesn't even have the rights to take them down
the algorithms look for music that matches their songs, when other people sing them, they sound different
because it's not their song
if you put up music it's a matter of time before it's taken down
if you mean the official one, yeah, king records is really good about takedowns
I'm just not sure I understand because the original isn't a cover
do you mean the official release?
the original cover?
How are you supposed to know to not watch it?
The material in the OVA is not representative of the content in the televised show
If you like it, whatever, but accept that maybe there's ground for criticism
Or if you're just being deliberately dumb about this
I'm not sure we watched the same ova
I can definitely say that putting in triggering content does hurt people
I think "it never matters ever because it's fictional" has limits
People who feel grossed out that the creators of the show wanted to show us this, generally
Settle for almost anything, but ||very underage nonconsent?||
I don't think any age would really have made the OVAs comfortable, just less ugh
Or play the manga more straight and not insert sexuality
Prilya seems to be cool fights and ideas that had the misfortune to be animated by and for lolicons
Three bath scenes of a preteen in 2 episodes
Even without the OVAs that show was too much for me
<:CatGun:681702362485620751>
Flip flap
Madoka has a point, those two are kind of misery theater
Site and asuka are much worse than madoka
it's completed and tolerably short as shounen mangas go
and you get all sorts of interesting variations on the outfit
if you like the bancho style there's a shounen manga called kongou banchou which is basically "everyone is a banchou"
Magia record isn't a wholesome version of madoka
no
it is also ecchi
I believe fire force has a character that wears a bikini under a firefighting jacket or something
yes. you've made that point clear.
so most stories about people deciding to be heroes or whatever take place around that age
traditionally, once you're out of high school in japan, you stop getting to choose what you do in life
the answer to your several questions is that characters kinda sorta have to be in that age range to hit the feelings of agency, and titty sells
especially in shounens
almost every main anime character ever is between 14-17
I'm not really aware of a battle shounen that doesn't have a gimmick - at least, not since like the 80s
you're going to have to elaborate on the phrase "something in particular"
I see a name like mwam and it's so hard for me to not say "oh I love Last Christmas"
you don't need to repeat points you made 20 minutes ago
it's a toy-selling shoujo
it is a shoujo yes
It was serialized in a shounen magazine so I guess on some levels it is, but I don't think a lot of people would categorize it as a shounen genre
I dunno if it's targetted at boys that firmly
It's a romance and slice of life
...is it?
I just don't think there's a shounen that isn't
it doesn't explicitly *have* to be battle heavy
shounen means it is battle heavy and targetted at boys or male teens
Id enjoy hentai shows if they had less sex tbh, the plots are frequently bonkers
You used to be an industry darling
Oh rie
Yeah Japanese sex voice acting is not good
Aw snap I see my #1 on there
Spider isekai word of mouth has gone from an eager bubbling murmur at the beginning to just kind of a quiet cringe the last few weeks
the difference is promare doesn't give a shit about its own plot twist
did we watch different movies
also why are people saying there's no alien plot twist in promare
trigger doesn't have people that worked on eva but it does have people who did shit like panty and stocking's ending
Or shirobako or planetes
Because on first watch you're still getting a hold of the roster
They might be some of the most satisfying to rewatch
Thinking about well executed ensemble cast shows with multiple small plot threads
And then they do shit like 'well actually we were *too* good at making mobiles suits at first so the first one we made was better than all the stuff now"
Stuff like mercurius just don't feel more advanced than the gundams
I think one of the problems I have with After Colony is the tech doesn't feel right
I can't believe it's all setsuna's fault the plan went bad
that's all the reasoning you get
because he's an ex clown
it's called prancing and yeah, horses do it
the original has really shit animation but is by far the best story
Macross music is generally pretty decent but 7's was almost certainly the best
the singer in Plus is basically hatsune miku, 10 years before hatsune miku was invented
EDM?
but 7 is j-rock and Plus is uh
Most Macross is contemporary pop, with whatever pop is current at the time
I mean since the VF-1 is in it...
several of the OG seasons are japan only even
I believe
animation was japanese
I might have seen more 80s anime than 2010s tbh
though if you thought gunbuster was pretty and want to see more animation like it, Gundam 0083 is my next thought
Gunbuster is definitely not representative of anything but late 80s OVAs when it comes to animation
if you absolutely cannot handle SDF macross animation, Do You Remember Love? is a remake movie that has beautiful animation but I think the plot suffers a bit for kawamori's directing
It kind of sets up everything, like why humanity keeps trying to weaponize music, why there's random giant people in the setting, why there's colony fleets
SDF Macross is probably the one to start with
I'm not talking "it's old and not to everyone's tastes," I'm talking "people in the 80s were mocking it"
Jp exclusive directs are what we call the Tokyo game show
~~my guilty pleasure in the genre is Biomeat~~
It was really, really bad about never giving catharsis. For recurring disaster manga, you need victories along the way
mobile game 'commanders' or 'masters' are the worst
man, Diebuster's thematics and message is saved and expanded on so hard by a single episode
Getter Robo OP
https://twitter.com/getterrobot_arc/status/1410781542666760195
so they can devote an *entire episode* to an epilogue
they end the plot before the final episode
it also actually has a good ending due to doing something I wish more anime would do
I believe the second season was funded partly by selling an erobook?
I submit godannar
if you need action ecchi
it's pretty fun
(I actually like klk for the record)
you already have klk on your list which is the far better vaguely-sexist trigger work
and not because of horny or anything
honestly it just felt incredibly uncomfortable in general to watch as a girl
I feel like it would have had to pivot much harder, pretty early, into "maybe gender roles aren't good, actually" to be something that'd be pleasant to recommend to friends
ditf would have aged like milk even if it had done an okay landing
Is it an actual ending or an "their adventure continues" ending
this has the garage band feel that, like, daiguard's OP does, without having vocals that work for a garage band
I haven't watched it yet
I guess GATE does that but, ugh, GATE
the ability to go back to your og world to recover and resupply
Inuyasha's actually got an idea I wish more isekai used
and a very good one
inuyasha is an isekai
Not a good enough point imo but maybe that's the reasoning
Honestly? Maybe to make the point that the villain wants you to be uncomfortable and vulnerable when you're disrobed
Idk if I agree with the themes but they at least have artistic merit past "booby good"
It tries to make points with nudity
KLK fits this
no I've been on vacation
the mid 2000s, the era that "watching anime" meant "buying 20 dollar DVDs with 4-6 episodes on it" if it didn't mean "watch pokemon and yugioh and shaman king on fox or whatever," it was pretty hard to sell anime at all
where international anime wasn't lucrative even for big titles
in an old market
idk, I think it also hurts the show that it entirely revolves around newtype ghost magic, which is like, the weakest part of UC
I think most people I've talked to consider it a 5-7/10, not counting visuals
that's not a common opinion
huh, really
100-120 is full of basically nothing
anyway NT was kind of a mess, but I'm curious about Hathaway - if this film series does well, they might explore the UC deadzone
I do enjoy them though and it's an absolute treat getting english releases
instead of, idk, 40
like, I miss when you could only put 5 or 6 skills on a pilot
The like 9 different systems that make your favorite units absolutely broken just make the game too easy and remove meaningful decision making; the downgrading and removal of sidekick units hurts; the fact so many attacks now have this weird 12fps framerate keeps it from really shining like it used to
imo, at least
I am saying they're not as good as they used to be
I'm not saying they're bad
when Z3 released
I'd say around 2014
Z1 was that year, and the studio honestly remained strong until
all their best stuff was solo
until 2008 actually
banpresto, though this idea was probably largely go nagai's
bandai wasn't involved
this was the 90s
nah
when getter rays caused mazinger z to evolve
the *weird* part was uhhh
getter rays are supposed to cause all of humanity's evolution
is it really that weird?
I think the classic timeline
but saying 'getter rays caused newtypes' has happened before and might happen again
You mean like combo attacks? srw isn't ambitious enough for that
because we'll get to keep it
but maybe the phenex will be the actual final upgrade
the more annoying thing is if the psyco parts end up being the strongest form
I don't think it'll be crazy impactful
I guess
same with the ridiculous psycoframe magic
but that's unicorn's fault
yeah
I just prefer when they slap boosters and guns on and call it a day I guess
but the dendrobium is just, like, to me, "this is the best you could do?"
it's funny because I like all the GP03 mimics and prototypes (like this boy)
I thought the RX-9 was a cool idea until they brought out the ugly 'totally not unicorn' version
but it shows up in games and stuff
sure
it's kind of a huge part of both SEED and Destiny's final fights
wait cypher have you never seen the meteor?
than GP03
A parts feel like more of a reference to this

yeah, I think the only real reason why the beam sword emitters are so big is uh
UC gundam likes having scattering beam cannons and shit in the belly/crotch
it was the size of a mobile suit torso
but the emitter wasn't big at all
yeah
where ship-cutting beam swords are... not that big...?
This is a clear reference to SEED, but it doesn't make much sense in UC
the cannon is in the crotch
so spiky
I think it's the bottom half of that mess I'm not fond of
I think the Deep Striker is a better version of the concept but it's still neat
I kinda like both the A and B
Past UC 100, UC starts being a lot about the decay of Anaheim and the Federation
considerably before, yes
unless they changed it for the film
UC105
unlike movie godzillas you do not want to live on a world with anime godzilla
way more dangerous and evil from humanity's point of view than normal
but like
not explicitly evil
even though anime godzilla is
protagonist helped godzilla win because it would have also destroyed the earth in the process, oops
but yeah it would have won
it would have beaten godzilla, and anime godzilla is *I think* the most bullshit strong godzilla to date?
It's honestly one of the biggest threats in the anime, but not as a kaiju
it never fights and turns into a city
haha it's worse than you think
city on the edge of battle
getter poseidon's still way too fucking 70s though
I used to hate getter dragon but it's grown on me
in which case it works, but the plot's filled with psychic polyamorous body snatching gender swapping love triangles with magical music
unless you're a demented genius like kawamori
the three planes on the bottom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51X4TAnblQs here we go, you can see the three combinations, all made from the same 3 planes without any cheating
the mech design does a lot of heavy lifting though
I'm still, overall, a fan of Sousei no Aquarion I think
3 planes that make 3 robots depending on their combination order
if you want a Getter Robo that's physically possible, Aquarion exists
yeah it doesn't work
Shin Getter Robo's production is a hot mess but there's some quality scenes
oh I found it
I skimmed an attack video and only saw a combo attack with Athrun
yeah
(it used to be a proper upgrade for the Freedom)
it's generally a combo attack with the Eternal these days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YAHgg-lB5Y
no, V for some reason... doesn't have the meteors? weird.
not fight other robots
anyway it's giant because the purpose of the weapon is to cut open carriers and warships
no it's a sword
no
3 is about 80% nonimpactful filler that doesn't even cause character development
Basically everything after ||leaving the prison||
6 has a strong first half but the endgame is ehhhhhhhhh
I think 3 and 6 were the low points for me
The best part about reading 6 is that 7 is next
Jojo pt 8 ending next month
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_Upon_the_Pleiades
yeah sorry that's a different magical girl one
is this the car commercial anime
This is also why 8 is kinda fun
Monster of the week works better when it's done to world build
4 was super good imo
Unlike 3
I don't like part 1 a ton but it's short enough it doesn't wear out the welcome
Eizoken before shirobako is interesting
DM's position should vary depending on if you're including filler arcs
they were one of those people who just kind of rambles and has no sense of personal space and, unprompted, went on how if they were in that timeloop they'd sexually assault various characters and never get caught and it was like ?????????? the fuck dude
whenever someone quotes that I think of someone I banned on IRC like 9 years ago
people who emphatically embrace all of endless eight need to take classes on personal time management because they make bad decisions
except watch like, the first two of endless eight and the last one
broadcast
and you should just not watch any unless you read a lord of the rings length novel
or unless it's fate where there is no order because it still hasn't been adapted properly
release order is almost always superior to other orders, due to the fact that you can always count on works being made after to be made with the knowledge that people will have seen the earlier works
when the fuck do you actually normal summon monsters
battle city rules don't matter anymore
actually I lie
and konami has been torturing people who buy cardboard with those bad rules ever since
battle city actually gave the game, *ugh,* RULES
<@!279341087494242304> I ATTACK THE MOON
because it was complete fucking bullshit
yeah duel kingdom was the best YGO ever was
because the digital world shit and the orichalcos stuff really drag the series down
WHITE HOUSE GA
still can't take that ova seriously though
Gunbuster did it and GekiRyuJin in GGG Final did it
like I can immediately think of two homages to it off the bat
ripping out a reactor from the chest is like one of *the* iconic mecha shots, along with Last Shooting and Obari pose
yeah
it's the will of getter rays
getter emperor isn't the will of humanity
getter rays end up using you
n-no, that's kind of the point
I just never agree that ||humanity is worth wiping out hundreds of other civilizations at least as good as us||
anyway yeah idk, TTGL is like the not-evil version of getter in terms of thematics
It's not super sleek or anything but that's ishikawa for you


armageddon's shin dragon is an anime only thing
it's fine, it doesn't exist
shin getter's storyline is pretty much the only mecha storyline I've seen that I wish the bad guys won lol
Ryoma keeps flopping between wanting to destroy getter and wanting to embrace it
I wonder how ishikawa would have ended it
any plotline involving emperor is kinda 'fuck yeah genocide'
I guess?
ehhhh
humanity is pretty much the villains of the galaxy
He's really good at making you go "fuck yeah getter" until you think about the context of everything
I'm fairly certain ishikawa is drawn towards using murderers and such as the pilots because getter isn't a positive force
it gets katanas instead of tomahawks

I hope they animate the girl getter someday
demonbane, another cosmic horror robot
even if it *were* to scale
it is always fun to bring up that STTGL isn't the biggest robot though
but I think that "bigger is better" is part of what made TTGL's second half not as good as the first
like I get that big is cool
are you okay
comes with making the protagonists wizards
they repeatedly do that since the 90s yes
just, gundam isn't equal to real robot
though I'm more of a super robot fan
real robot's great, just get away from fucking gundam because it is unable to be *not gundam*
anyway canonically ttgl/sttgl are not actually galaxy sized but create a pocket universe where everything is just smaller to fight in because apparently someone at trigger did in fact know relativity and wanted to dodge the question of why the fight looks the way it does
yeah but I can get the brrr with just as much emotional oomf at the planetary scale <:ShemHaPout:771142140029829173>
but the light would look different
sure
spiral is strictly better than getter rays because it's not specist
it's cool when they break laws of physics but it bothers me when they obviously never even considered them
would reach you sooner than your hand
because the light from the motion of your arm closer to you
or that you would observe your limbs moving backwards
diebuster was about my 'max size I'm okay with robots being' because when they scale up from that I can't stop thinking about the fact it would take years or centuries to tell your limbs to move
TTGL kinda put me off with the last push to be the best
There's a manga panel somewhere where it's a third the size of a galaxy
it's infinitely strong but it's usually up against people who can literally cheat and shortcut laws of the universe
In terms of the ultimate high tier power what-ifs
Emperor's strength is generally overrated imo
And it's the intention of getter rays to absorb the universe
you might notice that *everyone who resists them dies*
Getter rays make sure humanity survives
getter rays are the cosmic horror
So stop picking on someone for using the wrong wrong spelling <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
If you want to get pedantic <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
ƒÅ·∏•  for some reason is how to spell it
Also technically it's not arc or ark
But shin canonically happens before
Because shin debuts in go
Yeah shin came out after go
(oh for clarity only 00s2 did it but it was thick with it)
Also 00 and AGE both did like the worst at hammering the communication theme
I'm just eager when it does like anything else at this point
I don't even think those are bad themes
Hahaha
Crying about how people can't communicate and refusing to kill enemy pilots amidst teen drama is *definitely* gundam
It just doesn't do the things about gundam people like
Oh no it definitely does gundam things
and you'll not be totally disappointed
rather than gundam
go into it expecting a level 5 show
not as bad as people make it out to be but very not great
I'm not still bitter about this why do you ask
where the final main character kinda just cries about communication on screen until everyone's machines are disabled
AGE
and then they came out with...
people were mocking the latter after SEED, Destiny, and 00 all kinda went hard on it
really nice to have a gundam that isn't "war is bad" or "we need to CoMmUnIcAtE"
but wow does its themes and characters beat out most gundams
it's a slow ride, the animation at points is about as bad as gundam ever got in terms of low budget, and the robots are not to everyone's tastes
G gundam is one of those "I absolutely love this show but can't suggest it to people who ask" shows
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8ap6zPLqK0
~~and a big part of the reason is the sound track~~
anyway G gundam is on my top 15 mecha list for a reason
a prior activation of it grew so big it popped the universe it was in at the time
I think shin getter is my pick for best too, but I think short and sweet is always the way to go
grimgar is my favorite pokemon
yes that is the joke
someone's gotta be the worst
every main character is a good pilot
aside from Loran
but
she is a good pilot
because it was designed for the best newtype in the entire army
tbf to Christina, she was using a unit designed to be so overtuned that it wasn't humanly possible to use
which is really sad because they are literally the only two protagonists who are fucking test pilots
Loran's probably at the top, and after him are Kou and Christina
anyway; worst main protagonist gundam pilots in terms of skill
it's ridiculously inconsistent
being able to use the mcguffin
Duo's probably a better pilot overall maybe but he's not good enough in the way that counts
Wing's writing is just the worst
anyway he's wrong, heero's actually a pretty decent pilot
like those starwars blueprint books
out-of-universe technical docs
all the technical documents show Leos are quality
Wing's writing and plotarmor is just ass
Leos are actually premium suits
yeah but
after that it's ironically the protagonists that *have test pilot as their job*
the worst, skillwise, is probably loran
skill or personality
he flies defensively
he pretty much never has to line up shots
Basara has an advantage though
so maybe he shouldn't be on the list
though he isn't and won't ever be an ace
maybe Alto's level but it's so *weird*
idk where to put Basara on this list
To Gamlin's credit he did shoot down the same enemy ace like 6 times
but suddenly got really competent at the end
he was pretty mediocre for most of 7
Probably at Hikaru's level
<:thonk:824436307186024488>
oh Gamlin goes in there... somewhere
haven't watched delta
like, Max > Isamu > Fokker = Alto > Hikaru = other frontier aces
Isamu's probably the second best pilot Macross has seen
Yeah, but Macross doesn't have super high standards
perfect amount
Max is absolutely great and I'm so glad he gets to flex for like 3 minutes in M7
I remember being really annoyed when I first saw sdf macross/robotech because how dare this sidekick be a better pilot that's not allowed
remember to avoid spoilers for 0080 considering iski's actively downloading it lol
he's at least a solid third
he's also not even the *second* best pilot in SDF
but
he did tricks with crop dusters I think?
Hikaru didn't really have amazing experience before
shiro is so good he can dodge the heat from his mobile suit melting around him /s
oh, yeah
nah it's just loran is from the moon and has piloted a suit before
I would probably be able to drive it because I have driven other vehicles
it'd be like me getting dropped into a racecar
he's just not... y'know, good
though ironically loran is more prepared than most gundam protagonists to pilot
he's a protagonist
of course he did well
because nothing makes sense
it's really really hard to assess anything on-screen in wing
literally doesn't get a scratch
the ZZ gundam doesn't get hit until the final battle, so being a glass cannon is fine
he's just the strongest newtype
Judau is probably on the lower half of the skill list even at the end though
amuro included
A bunch of pilots were pretty crap at first
hm
I *think* they actually kept the film of 0080
how do you get 17gb out of 6 episodes
oh damn really
very very effective at going "war fuckin sucks"
maybe 00 could have competed if it ended at s1
imo it's the best gundam production that is only rivaled by the original
you should watch 0080
I think garma would have been a problem in addition to kycillia
Zeon is also terrible with resource management and has massive infighting that was waiting to happen, as the oyw showed
It's interesting because I'm not convinced zeon could have been a functional government for more than 10-15 years
Zeon was definitely the more atrocious of the two in 0079, but the conflict radicalized the already bad parts of the federation because they almost lost
I think the original intent of UC was less that there were no bad guys and more that there are no saints in war
but that really clearly wasn't the way MSG was written
the past, idk, 25 years of gundam sidestories have been trying to drag the federation down to zeon's level in the OYW to push this idea that gundam's this really cool series where everything is gray and nothing is right and the only right side to be on is as a third party
Don't mistake the fact that there were justified causes for things to get escalated with the fact that zeon was committing atrocities with every sign of setting up a government that would be far worse than the federation
You can still be worse than a broken system
corrupt doesn't mean zeon wasn't the bad guys
yeah
I don't agree that's ultrascummy
And the Federation's radicalization was a direct consequence of Zeon's remnant forces
it was not *worse to begin with*
Federation *becomes worse*
no it doesn't
just because the government was flawed does not mean "both sides are equally at fault"
there *is* a greater evil
the first 10 years or so it's pretty clear that zeon were the bad guys
also that's the modern interpretation of gundam
but I'm not sure it's a commentary on zeon fans, specifically
0080 is definitely a commentary on gundam fans
haven't heard that rumor
he does fly a VF-4 or whatever in dynamite
no, wait, wait
I wouldn't because I'm not convinced he could fly without it
(though I don't think he's ever shown to miss a speakerpod)
Anime I care about I do like 1-2 a day
Prior to zeon, anyway
Generally it wasn't civil rights infractions but more denial of autonomy and getting shafted in trade and stuff afaik
Anyway yeah while zeon was Nazi Germany, federation was like British empire lite
daimos, the frosty nipple boy
SAC is good but nothing is as good as the movie
Its still there though
Yeah, offensively so in the LN, but it's less jingoistic in the manga and less even more in the anime
if people are not answering the question it is because they do not know, not because they didn't see something 10 lines earlier
also cecil please stop asking the same question 3 times in 10 minutes
I can't think of a worse combination
please don't suggest goblin slayer to cecil lol
they don't look anime-inspired at all
brought up and then abandoned the Ultimate Coordinator idea
they kinda just
honestly? I wouldn't mind a kira clone plot
~~pretty sure gainax has more lawyers than nonlawyers at this point tbh~~
Quite honestly 90% of the fandom merchandise market and such is illegal, it's amazing they allow any of it at all
"what is cel animation I've never seen it" - ash
~~as a side note, the argument that initial d is a mecha anime is stronger than attack on titan~~
"mecha design" means everything from robots to trains to cars, even if they're from the 1940s
Loan words in this case is complex
Mecha is short for mechanical but the genre is more than the word
They don't have to be giant robots but the robots need to expand one's agency
Mecha isn't synonymous with scifi
Strength's bit was the good part, basically
Story was muddled but there were a few good moments
TV was okaaaaay
https://animeschedule.net/
OE
L and OE
I mean klk is seifuku tokusatsu, and tokusatsu is generally mecha
Is yowamushi pedal mecha
Oh if you want a fun question
Movie aside
~~And squad tactics honestly never actually matter~~
Because I'm looking for things to compare it to and there's not much like it
There really isn't much of a strategic warfare anime genre
Major characters in logh have more to do with Gendo or Misato than Shinji
Logh I'm not actually sure the actual navigators are ever important characters
Multiple pilot mecha have characters directly piloting it
It's a lot more obvious when there's a hero ship
I don't really know
Slash fleet
And that extends to commanding a ship
*commanders* rely on subordinates for that
Characters quite honestly don't rely on mecha for force multiplying
I'd have to think a long time about that
It's the fact they rely on planes to be characters of relevancy
If macross was macross except the planes couldn't transform it would still be mecha
Not mecha as a genre
There is some wiggle room where magic creates a construct but if it's the person's private spell, it's just a summon
It's the fact it's the magic solving things instead of an external device
It's not
But then they have the magic
Ok so they have magic circuits implanted
I'd argue this is true for cyber formula and initial D
It's not something they're using, it's something they are
Titans are closer to Ultraman/using magic powers to grow bigger
Don't know how good it was
OE was a weird episodic experiment though
Or "please help me I can't stop world building until I have a novel about every area of this randomly created map"
"I can't stop adding girls to the harem"
They go one of two ways
I mean that's the fate of Isekai
I dunno, the first arc isn't that dissimilar
There were some being written before that but it made the prospect financially successful and a ton of amateurs hopped into writing LNs and WNs and 3-4 years later the isekai explosion happened
It's obviously not the standard formula but it set off the Isekai craze
Yes
So you could argue older is better in the genre
Honestly if it's an 'isekai' from before sword art online, odds are good it's got some original ideas
The third Isekai is because the protagonist also finds himself 20 years into the future of that new world
It's about a dimensional bomb that goes off and twists three worlds into one
Anyway, super dimensional century orguss
Sorry phone decided to crash
If you want a double (triple, arguably) Isekai though
No, but the rest of Earth bitches that they're not handling it right
Whether it's *intentionally* propaganda is kinda irrelevant
It puts it in context but doesn't make it not "jsdf vs two worlds and being the pinnacle of humanity"
I don't think anyone has ever claimed that like, every sentence of the ln is devoted to it
It's there in the anime but it's very blatant in manga or ln
They don't hide it very hard, it's just jsdf soldiers are the most Noble and brave and cunning and strong and the rest of the world shits on them but oh what's this, Rory Mercury getting an entire scene to talk about how amazing they are to the world press
Nah it was episode 2
Ver had 0 "obvious villain" vibes imo, especially considering section 2 was down a scientist

His design was very benign and sane until his heel reveal
In media res that gives away the biggest catharsis moments or plot elements
Shin mazinger did that too and it's like, the shittiest experimental director thing
The ED was overrated
Also God knows was the best part of haruhi
The way it manages to link everything was inspired
It's honestly one of the best medley mixes of all time imo
Kumikyoku was basically the 00s anime fan anthem
You know the song was both good and mid 00s if it made it into kumikyoku
just bought tickets to see shirobako in theaters
Kyon is the viewpoint character but not the protagonist
Kyon's middle name is inoffensive
Haruhi
Anyway haruhi is pretty good but it's really taken down a few pegs by the main character being terminally unlikeable
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Broadcast and ignore s2
||That wasn't the real madoka unless I really need to rewatch it||
||It's not a story beat I particularly hate but I think it would always bother me if it was eternally going to be the end of the franchise. Also, it's homura's point of view that decided Madoka wasn't happy as a goddess, and decides to undo the one action Madoka's felt the most sure and confident in in her entire life to do it, because she thought Madoka wasn't capable of making her own choices. As a trans woman, the niggling, nasty feeling of people who love me trying to change my life against what I want because "you're not happy" is too familiar, so I guess I have a personal vibe with the theming. Even if Madoka isn't happy right now, it is *what she wants.*||
||I mean, it's a fairly toxic love - she's basically saying "I know madoka better than she does and I'm going to make this decision for her"||
madoka franchise spoilers ||Rebellion takes the story - and homura's love - in a direction I wish it hadn't, but I don't by any means dislike it? It's a good piece of art and its own story is compelling, but it's not a story I would have written||
haha swiss cheese
I must be a third then <:Thinkki:514552069563088896>
I don't think your objection lessens the merit of my suggestion
Fine; I still think the TV show is served well by a small break so you can digest it without having to think about everything going on in rebellion, because there's a lot
I expect securing funding for it would be difficult
Man now I'm really curious about what an anime about the *actual* idol industry would be like - Girlish Number, but for idols
Madoka spoilers ||she's wrong, of course, Madoka TV is inherently about the power of hope||
watch it and find out
*shrug*
They are one setting but they honestly tell two different stories
tv ends on a pretty powerful note and the movie doesn't have the same themes - you shouldn't think of Madoka as this one story that's "TV+Rebellion" but you should consider the experiences of TV and Rebellion with some small disconnect
||To be fair(?) to Homura, she does think she has consent from the conversation on the flower field. But since Madoka is stripped of all of her memories, and such, she's not exactly at full faculties. She certainly didn't seem to consent during the act itself.||
||Anyway for me it's mostly down to consent - yeah, it sucks that Homura didn't come with in any capacity, but Homura, out of 'love', violated Madoka's consent. And that's why the two 'selfish' acts aren't equal. Homura's consent wasn't violated because you don't have consent over what someone else does with their own life.||
||Maybe you're not the only person in the conversation.||
||look I think there's nuance etc here, but it's really fucked to say the hero(ine) should have had the girl *because they saved the world*||
||yes, she's okay with it, the point heart was making is that she 'deserved' madoka||
||madoka, clearly, because she didn't take her with her - not that I think this is the only logic possible here but this is what heart's discussion was based on||
||only madoka gets to decide that||
||I think she deserves to be happy, but that doesn't mean she deserves madoka||
||yeah, but I also think she can be happy without it - if your only possible path of existence to any happiness ever is to be with a specific person, you're either a fictional character, or you need therapy||
Yes. ||Literally, saving the world doesn't entitle you to get the hand of the girl. This is really toxic shit. If the only way for homura to be happy was to be with madoka, and madoka didn't want it, yeah, no, she shouldn't get to be happy. The fact that madoka, with free will, chose a path of non-happiness should be respected. She wanted it. Sometimes life is about things other than being happy, dude. ||
||this is honestly "the prince is owed the princess' hand for saving her" logic - Homura isn't entitled to be by madoka's side, not ever||
||It's not really clear how much power she had to change stuff like that||
You mean, ||after the wish?||
||The fact Homura did it to someone she loves is why it's a negative ending compared to a positive one, Carol. That's the difference you were asking about.||
This is the last thing I'll say but you're free to move to the other channel to talk more freely - ||In TV, Madoka has basically no reason to feel anything significant about Homura, other than some gratitude. I'm sure she picked up feelings over time as a goddess, but she doesn't owe Homura anything at all. Homura's stalker obsession was unrequited.||
||I mean, my interpretation that she didn't take Homura with her is because she doesn't love homura like that?||
||I recall it being a construction of what madoka would have been like||
but standalone it's a decent concept
Not really fond of it in the context of all the kids that watch/read it
I defer to like anyone else ever when it comes to flower arrangement meanings
it certainly wasn't by checking a commonly known website
I'm not really sure if it was possible to definitively answer that question back then by just going to a library
in 1999 kids argued nonstop about whether digimon or pokemon came first, which had an anime first, etc
ursaring, generic baby digimon, and nihilego
digisonas
movies almost never are
I mean it's following a manga...
imagine a world where fate zero looks like ex arm and fgo never happened
I've been interested in it since they announced it last year
Megaton musashi isn't lbx
Not *bad* but far from brilliant
Something gundam
It goes from something good to uh
Yeah
Tbf I feel 00s2 is better when you're wondering what it *might* be like with excitement
lmao out of all the problems to have with franxx
the characters, even the girls, are secondary in marketing
the charm point of gridman is the tokusatsu references
This is symphogear - crossovers go beyond hanging out with people
why would they wear street outfit gears
I mean, it's because the character's street outfits make for terrible combat uniforms
if you're lucky it won't just be characters in a classroom!
I'm sure there'll be a soulless adaptation someday
I mean you can probably guess that from the way he murdered angelg's design
Sometimes I think about how one of the biggest names in mecha/robot design directed angel blade
And then that led into more of those but also a more tempered kind, but also one that just defaulted to aggression, rather than the original interpretation of being a grumpy puss that slowly worked her way towards self-awareness
So you had this second generation of kind of like, hyper bitch tsundere
Who used gag violence
Probably because in the formative years, not only did you have your asukas, you also had your narusegawas
The concept of tsunderes has been flanderized well past anything reasonable really
Disdain or apathy, for example, is a kuudere
Technically they need to cover their emotions with frustration or anger or it's another archetype
Man I don't think I'll ever get over the gay haircut ed
My feelings over your airspace
Stargazer was the best part of destiny
Lmao Jojo 6 is Netflix
I honestly can't remember specifics but it adds another automatic loss condition like godmars does, except also with time limits
Aka the worst show to have in srw
Yeah might pick up machine robo
they retconned a fifth later
oh wait no
yeah
and then a bunch developed later
There's 3 retconned into 4 original astray frames
gina is the big bad of the initial astray story
lmao
yeah, the protagonists
hello
but yeah hers is the one that they add claws and a beamshield to
I mean they're basically identical
gina's just insane
mina's okay though
it's just a bigger picture
There's no detail to find
no, but it'll never look good
unlike film, you can't find the masters and get a better upscale
digital animation designed for 480
another reason mid 00s anime look terrible
the color changing one
variable phase shift
though the point is partially for disguise
for example, unit 5 has VPS
but everything from that point of astray is fucking stupid
unit 5 became mirage
at least the robots look cool I guess <:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
idk how Eureka 7 can be so good yet *every fucking subsequent thing is dogshit*
https://twitter.com/EUREKA_HI_EVO/status/1424928491909394451
time to be absolutely fucking gutpunched for 30 minutes again
going to watch the movie in theater tomorrow <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
speaking of which
like it's made to shine a light on how anime production is absolutely insane
if you want proof that an anime can have a good plot, good character arcs, decent visuals, *and also answer your question*, Shirobako seems... incredibly apt?
also
it's an anime original
the manga came out a week before the anime
<:NononSmug:651876302412054548>
have an ending
Also, standalone efforts have to do something that adaptations don't have to do
When an anime episode airs, they're usually *in the middle* of making 5-6 episodes simultaneously, in different levels of production - one person *can't* be in control of everything
the others are 90% in someone else's court, doing what they want to do, somewhat the way they want to do it
and, this is big: A given director generally only hands-on directs one out of every 3-4 episodes, usually
Episodes have to be a specific length - I don't know if you've ever tried writing a speech, but polishing something that lasts exactly, say, 15 minutes and not 14 or 16 is *insanely* demanding - yet also hold the audience's attention adequately and not burn them out. And yet, with those little 24 minute loops, you need to build *multiple* overarching arcs that communicate like 5 different things
you need a perfect team
And I think a lot of why that's so hard to nail is because an anime has to care about attention wrapped in layers, delegated in ways that one person can't control
The director is the one who decides where and when to make time for the character development
being able to make a pretty frame doesn't make you a great director - a director impacts the story as much as the writer does
if they were the best directors, they'd hit the character development
It kinda ruined the legal dilemma climax
I was disappointed with the theater subs though
The movie knew it was an encore and it decided to focus on a "failure is a new beginning" message and I think that was correct
If you did that it would be doing the TV show over again; shirobako is a very good ensemble show and going through character moments for the cast was the way to go I think
I don't think the creative process really needed a highlight
The musical number criticism yeah but the "hurts to watch" was about the first 30 minutes of the film which are intended to inflict pain
I don't really agree with this
God shirobako movie is still rough to watch
Wait is this seacats or celeste
The deep sky ship fight would be the most dramatic shit
So like, humans don't have robots, or...?
Oh it was 95 my bad
End of Eva was 97 though
Eva was 94
Toonami basically bankrolled s2
Late 90s were pretty amazing in anime
Bebop, outlaw star, and big o all happened around the same time
Just looked it up, 98
99ish
That's a sure sign it sucked
Wow it was only 2 cour in the mid 80s
A few ideas were taken to make z-hen
I got the impression it's just derivative schlock with a mazinger made of stone by an ancient civilization
I have no idea but go nagai has done everything he can to bury it lmao
It just sucks
It's not a disaster
That's the real shame
It goes in the pile of "mech anime we try to forget" along with stuff like god mazinger
Iirc even masaki's themes don't show up
But yes cybuster anime is bad and there is no real reason to watch it other than sick curiosity
They all have issues and one is impossible to find
Three, even
Gundam 00 was one of the first shows I remember going "oh wow" with post 2000
Kyoani nailed it around haruhish, everyone else took until mid 07
Late 00s
Early 90s Gundam honestly looks pretty bad outside of moneyshots
Prince of darkness had nice mechanical design and that's about where the compliments end
Imagine if nadesico got a movie to tie things up, that'd be nice
Honestly the show would have managed to be fine - not great, but fine - if the last 3 episodes didnt happen
Zessica is like one of the best female leads ever but we had to kick her aside for Yamato nadeshiko doormat mikono
Zessica got fucked so hard and I'm eternally upset over it
But everyone else rules
Kagura, amata, and mikono were pretty eh
Anyway like sousei, the best characters are "everyone who isn't the main 3"
Sousei's core 3 were kinda shit
That is a weird reason considering anyone is a better mc than apollo
???
Like it was literally the best thing
*that gave a finale to the jin/yunoha romance*
The sousei/evol crossover
Was the ova they aired as episode 0
The best thing about logos
It's nothing but kanji jokes and had no relation to the first two shows
Terrible
Maybe lankpants just doesn't do ensembles
The first half was perhaps the best super robot show ever and then it had like 2, maybe 3 good episodes after that
I feel that
> half of evol
*cherry blossom cherry blossom*
Well the final episode was perfect, just the two prior to tie up Dewey were shit
E7 is the only time they did it right and I'd still argue they fucked up the last 3 episodes
Flashy start that kinda dissolves into a pretentious dumb mess
Typical bones
S1 was definitely the better season
"oh yeah it's completely a good and healthy thing for your careers to depend on people associating you with long dead idols and if you're not enough like them you can't be a star"
*by accident*
Akb0048 is the best idol show though because it reveals how creepy and fucked idol culture is
The actual ending was fine, but they resolved the evil corporation plot ||by assassinating the CEO dad and just dropping that plot point, with no further explanation||
Akb s2 sucked butt too for that
Maybe kawamori is just allergic to good endings
That joke doesnt even make sense
Because mikono's element power is Hibiki's armed gear
From the same studio
And superpower of donuts was kinda neat and, honestly, hilarious in context of it airing at the same time as symphogear
She has a character it's just dull
Mikono wasn't *that* bad; I feel she should have been above background characters
Some of the best female characters in mecha, period
Zessica and Yunoha deserve to be on top though
*bag girl who has no lines* had 200 more votes than the main female mc
not because it's 90s, but because they're cutting corners in a lot of places
my point was early 90s gundam looks bad
animation it's a lot better imo
wing is wing
I mean I was talking about animation but yeah outlaw star is a really fun romp with great atmosphere and characters
Yeah
Actually zero is where it starts being too much kawamori
Maybe frontier but that's where the series starts suffering from too much kawamori
SDF, plus, 7
Definitely try the older macrosses
Oh, yeah
It's basically Eva 2
If you really like Eva, give Fafnir a try
Hm
It's very not serious but it's short enough that all flaws are forgivable
I do highly recommend promare
(note: "average" Gundam is not what a lot of people watch)
Is, like, your average Gundam level of quality which I don't think is super high
Cross Ange is ok, has flaws
Majestic Prince
Aquarion and the first half of Aquarion Evol are a guilty pleasure
Large soft spot for the original eureka 7
Gunbuster/Diebuster, probably
Hm favorite
Make them start coming when they're not cookie cutter
No
Yeah, when it was a story element more than it was a self-insertion mechanic
It's funny because some of the best ever Isekai anime are older mecha shows
I think promare is the most recent popular "oh huh I guess thats mecha" entry
I know the more 'realistic' take in s1 is pretty popular but that gets dropkicked out the window later
At least, past s1
Geass definitely is one but I do think it being mecha is unrelated to why people like it
I'll have to think on it
Idk my genre definition is a little weak when it comes to yuusha/transformers
It's alien superheroes with planes and cars
Most transformers I don't really think is mecha
It's dumb
Yeah, but there's mecha in it so the genre gets slapped on
Yeah, true
Doesnt make it not shit considering it's one of like <10 mecha entries with a female primary mc
Oh, it's easily explainable
Though ||Dingo being infinitely more competent than Angela for most of the movie was *my* main complaint|| (exiled spoilers)
I find most people click away because of 3dcg rather than boob
The major reason is because anime has gone from mass appeal with toy sales to targeting high profit whales with figurines etc
I don't think that's true at all
Again very not perfect, but it's only a movie and the final action sequences are fantastic
Exiled from Paradise
Speaking of mecha anime movies
Like"gigguk doesn't like it" shouldn't really sway you too much imo
Idk how much I'd put faith even in anime rating sites
Fly me to the moon is a seperate license
Though most choose to butcher it instead of dealing with it
Yeah but you technically have that problem with the tv show
I'd rather less extras but including the khara films
But it's still a little rich for my blood
At least it has eoe
oh lmao he was the protagonist of the muslim toku show
yeah, rip
okay I was worried I was out of line to go "who??" but they really don't have anything really to do with anime
because the stuff they pirate has to deal with this
it still affects pirates though
They package them together and don't offer them singly
You can only buy a library of rights, paying for *all* of the songs in it
Because you can't buy the rights to it, or most other songs
As the tweet goes into, the song almost doesn't matter anymore
But not a big big deal
The directors cut of Eva has 12 different covers of the song for EDs so it's kinda a big deal

The worst poll meme is still boaty mcboatface ~~if we're not counting trump~~
I guess it's a historical curiosity but it was literally just "please give us a little more money to finish the real movie"
Please stop printing that movie
I love that they keep putting in death and rebirth
a pretty good one, leaf's best imo
i-it was a game first
> Love the anime whose game
It does make sense that they would continue to focus on DVD production over streaming
anyway I do want to point out you're looking for ways to spend zero dollars on anime and yet complaining that they're not catering enough to you
also with streamsites because they're garbage
I do with subscription services
I don't have an innate problem with piracy
~~which is still peanuts~~
CR splits up the royalty part of your payment based on the ratio of seconds watched that month; if you watch a really good 13 episode show and then drag yourself through a terrible 50 episode mess, the latter's going to make 4 times the money
it gets especially bad when you watch longrunning shounens and such
the more shows you watch the less you support
also, interesting point
And you actually get to keep them, rather than watch them vanish when there's a rights squabble
try 20 for 13 episodes
sentai filmworks is amazingly priced
Yeah, as I've said
streaming services are the absolute worst way to support anime studios and arguably harm them
and pirate it and then buy the DVDs of the shows you want to support
I mean you could do what I do
pick your poison
It's reasonable on their end and they're one of the better sub companies out there
<:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
entire cours for like 20 bucks
I quite honestly would prefer they cut those corners because their BD/DVD releases are *incredibly* affordable
I guess they didn't think it was worth paying someone else to do another passover for streaming when the DVD sub scripts work fine
that's their market
sentai filmworks puts everything out on disc
I know I've got some ADV evangelion discs from about 03 that do the same thing
so you needed the karaoke subs but also if you didn't actually translate the opening you weren't doing your job
Honestly a lot of it is a relic of a time when being an anime fan was less of a idle hobby and more of a raging subculture that you would do shit like memorize OPs and stuff
Not having any is an option but the switch back and forth is something that anime releases have been doing for about 3 decades now
I mean, they're limited by what can be used in DVD encoding
so if that's what you're invested in it's not for you
Love hina, however, is not part shounen like negima is
she's an actual fleshed out character that belongs in reality
Narusegawa is one of the better harem main girls out there imo
The love interest is about 50 times better than Asuna
I thought Love Hina was pretty decent
It's written by the godfather of the harem anime, after all
it was well known a decade ago
negima's not niche, just old
It's good but it's pretty obvious when they ran out of money
Best sith
His sister is insanely hot

I think the presentation of GLT is very good but I guess that's fair
Basically the stuff before RX-78 2.0
They were alright, but some modern HGs are about as good as old MGs in quality
HGs have skyrocketed in quality while getting cheaper
I've been watching this market for about 15 years, it's definitely getting cheaper
I'm more curious if they're going to do anything with the SRW 30th exhibition
imo they're gundam at its best, if you aren't uh, used to old goofy super robots
nice
She clearly realizes she has feelings for Miku in XV but it's unclear when exactly she realizes she's romantically invested in Miku
she might also just not realize she's gay yet
it's certainly no longer in 'yuribait' territory
the subtext pushes beyond reasonable deniability
I'd consider symphogear to be explicitly yuri by japanese standards
isn't he in like maybe 3 movies a year
Kayano ai is the next most prolific but she normally doesn't sound anything like kirika
I forgot who you were talking about until just now
Especially for like 2013 or whatever
Yeah there's pretty legit trans rep there
The bedroom scenes are very swooning but not how people actually confess...?
I actually felt the way gear ended up doing it was better than some aggressive scene in the bedroom, honestly

Felt more grounded to reality
They're still marketable because it's not a relationship unless it's two way
I'm pretty sure theres a subsection of purity that deals with love being fine as long as it's unrequited
They still have their idol purity
They're just very serious friends you see
But if that's the full scene its still in the "deniability" zone
It definitely pushes things further than normal especially with the foot shot
(x) doubt
No not really but what idol show is
nah, f-zero is a more recent one than fire emblem
madoka is a very good story but it kind of happens *around* madoka
madoka doesn't require much of a range in acting
it's ironic that I think that madoka is one of her least impressive roles
it doesn't look like a face she has a reason to be making and it doesn't seem to match Serena's character design
Probably because it feels very forced
that doesn't give you horror, I don't think, it just makes you uncomfortable
That does nothing though
oh, and the shock of seeing Hibiki fuckin die
the audience is already set up with a feeling of distant horror
with watching innocent people in the crowd get killed somewhat graphically
Kanade's death happens after the audience was hit with a bit of a jarring shock
It's also a question of presentation
I am not going to read extra LNs for it to make sense <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I've heard that's flawed but that's the fault of the media
If I ever consume yuuyuu I'm going to watch the anime in release order I think
Millaarc could definitely be doable if the anime was devoted to it
Yeah
It's not the only way to do it but it's a visceral demonstration that the dark idealist will in fact go too far
And, honestly, I think it's fine to use it to establish that the bad guy is evil
If it represents a failure or an imperfect victory it's worth exploring
yes
in gear
GX-AXZ convinced me that no one would ever die again
but saving people means more if it's a world where people die
I mean obviously there's gorefests where it's done for shock value
I think killing civilians for show is fine
probably because it's about rakugo which is about as impenetrable a cultural divide thing as you can get
I just realized "dying before the thing happens" is why Planetarian fucked me up
Oh, interesting
for the purposes of the manga, if you're forced into retirement, it's a mini-death
it does have the benefit of being able to "kill" people without them actually dying
I know Hajime no Ippo did this a few times
We're a lot more fine with people dying after they accomplish their thing than before. After it just feels like a send-off, but before, oooh, that's frustrating
It's very possible for this to not hit right though so it's important that other people can pick up the slack and provide some catharsis later
People don't die cleanly, and having someone die before they can actually accomplish the finale of their big character arc can improve the 'unfairness' and make it feel more bitter and rough
Also really strong way to improve death in anime is to make it imperfect
Shounen Best Friend 3 jumping in front of the bosses' attack to die in their place doesn't feel unfair, and it tends to only have a real punch to it if you just really liked that character
They're not fair and you can see them coming and you have ages to understand that everyone's going to lose someone special
Uncurable diseases are a huge one here
It also helps it feel big if it doesn't feel fair
I think one way to make a death feel "big" is if it's been set up that you can immediately *get* the impact it's going to have on other cast members
a fair point but I think you can see that it's going to go from a general discussion on anime death to a very focused one if we move onto that topic
I will say that from a directorial point of view the nameless character death felt like it had impact, unlike Serena
if you want to discuss the difference between winglet and kanade this isn't the forum, and, quite honestly, I feel like you'd just be repeating yourself
this is not symphogear discussion
This is not winglet o'clock
instead of "holy shit what's going on is so fucked up"
"the show is trying to gross me out"
so it feels like
is sao about pet death now
> rainbow bridge
progpog
on the other hand a world of holden caulfields might be a bit much
Probably because some try for redemption when they should be trying for atonement
Macross itasha was never as on point as akb
There's a few girls that had really good timbres though
I'm pretty sure I mentally stoped checking for that stuff the moment they uttered the word "micsaber"
Was that the one where they gave all the idols assault rifles and said "here's your audition"
<:YayakaSmile:709137283508469760>
that's the primo shit for me
üëå
Yayaka in Flip Flappers
and fuckin
we were talking about redemption arcs done right
oh man it suddenly hit me
yeah you'd have more stuff to do
I agree with this but this means you should just focus on anime original projects and avoid adaptations
08th or 0080
they're standalone continuations but they really don't work without the prior season
narrative, for example, or zz
gundam blurs that line a lot
(and f91 I guess)
except victory, oddly
yeah but that describes all of UC
as starting choices
destiny, 00 movie, zz
there are worse choices
Redo cares, it tries to remove it wherever possible
it's actually a legit commentary on sexuality
ishuzoku reviewers actually has things going for it other than shock value or controversy
RoH definitely pushed the limits of televised broadcast
not on tv
it's not just "the show's got titties"
Every post you make about the show needs a CW: rape tag, for example
The nsfw isn't the problem
You could bring it up in <#336297840529899522> I think but the scope of the anime is just not really a good fit for this channel considering the show is kind of designed to be as upsetting as possible
I wouldn't exactly allow discussion of a snuff film to show up in <#803824240494903338>
I'm trying to decide if this is even an approriate channel to discuss RoH in
there's a reason people wanted Vic to voice the character in the dub
also if you don't think Shield Hero wasn't under controversy for the themes idk if you were actually paying attention back then
it does, and redo is the same themes, with more emphasis on "it's okay if it's revenge"
except uh make sure you find an all ages version
the order for Fate is read the VN and then you can watch in pretty much any order
I mean if you *watched* FSN the payoffs going to be worse regardless
while knowing how Zero is supposed to end doesn't detract from it *at all* since you still don't know almost anything about the players
Zero just spoils so many incidental twists of FSN
who wins isn't the whole plot
> You're basically spoiling yourself the whole Zero plot
If it can't be hacked, you're not getting a tl
It can be emulated but whether it can be easily hacked is not something I've heard answers on
But yeah fgo mostly killed the "ah I wonder who [class] is" vibe that fsn, zero, and extra had
It's not; it's just around then that anyone getting into fate already knew who saber was
like what's up with Shirou
there's a few others
Saber's identity
honestly, pre-Extra times
ah the pre FGO times where that was something that was a spoiler
exactly
Zero's made to keep you in suspense even with that knowledge
You're honestly *supposed* to walk into Zero knowing how it ends
as opposed to spoiling major revelations or plot beats of FSN
especially since the spoilers you get about zero are relatively limited (who wins, *some of* who lives)
'spoiling zero' is much less of a big deal than spoiling FSN
Assassin vs Saber in Fate was one of my favorite servant fights
honestly maybe I'm weird but
it has like three really fucking good scenes but most of stuff with caster etc was just not as cool
UBW was my least favorite route
the thing that kept me engaged was "oh shit, why is *this* different?"
I found the route the most boring of the 3, honestly
To me most of the value of UBW as a route wasn't the route
I still think that Zero into FSN is a worse pipeline but I respect your opinion
Especially since it's Shirou at his peak as a magus
~~Missing out on double Avalon is missing out on one of the best climaxes of the setting~~
the reason it's a stumbling block is because it's not animated
all 3 routes are point 1
neither of those is why it's a stumbling block
I don't know why people shit on the Fate route, it's the best possible introduction to the setting
It's not
*granted,* its status as a mystery story doesn't work unless they actually adapt the fate route
I think FSN holds up better as a mystery story than as an action piece, which knowing about the twists undoes
Man this just highlights the fact there is no good adaptation of FSN
*from an unbiased narrator*
Particularly if you come from the FSN novel, because we never get told what happened in the previous war
I mean, same, but in reverse
They leaned a little more on the suspense on the animated production
At least the written novel form
it's "what carnage is it going to take to get there"
But the questions Zero poses isn't really "who's going to win"
Any production where Gilgamesh shows up is a spoiler
And, yes
UBW is FSN
~~Worm~~
Most WNs are written by amateurs
Unfortunately the idea of ending LNs before sales start dropping just isn't done
Once you've gotten to stability the shows lose the main gimmick and ride on characters
Slime and spider and bofuri show that the west, at least, doesn't care about the part where they've come into power; it's all about clever ways to deal with weaknesses
After total eclipse I was kinda just resigned to the franchise probably sucking forever
Telling jokes cuts into screaming time
Everything gag related must be buried
Launch is from the gag days
And afterimages yeah
Mostly because that's a level of tech magic Gundam stayed away from previously
Honestly I think I choked more on quantization than "ok it makes them psychic sure"
Yeah it was inoffensive as far as Gundam magic goes
it's always, like, "but loads of girls do important things!" "but everyone dies, not just women!"
man trying to tell gundam fans why gundam treats women like shit is so hard
its ok to be wrong
I remember having the same kind of suspense with Sakura Quest

I actually like the FAZZ, the testbed unit for the Full Armor set
It's just so <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097> that one of the strongest female villains has "was dumped by char" as their major core life altering event
Some of it's so strong, some of it is UC at its dumbest, the ZZ itself is such a weird chunky robot that manages to never get hit the entire show until the last fight, and Haman is both an awesome female character and one of gundam's worst
Anyway I'm always confused how I feel about ZZ
<a:MariaBlush:796618928587145217>
most of this list is nice though!
oh there's SEED
also I don't see SEED or Wing on here, only their sequels
like 0080 would be several tiers above ZZ
I respect your tastes but my list would be wildly different
Unless you're rating this purely on visual art competency in which case UC and 0083 should be at the top and Turn A should be like B
UC being S+ is really uh, yeah I disagree personally
Getter arc worth bothering with?
CCA implied they basically managed to nanofabricate psycommus
A federation that fell from grace I think has more value than a federation that's sucked shit since the start, from a moralistic storytelling point of view
"it was always corrupt from the start, zeon was right" is just like... you're taking the muddled gray nature of the OYW and just making it black and white again? Like it's removing the whole moral dilemma of wars not being about good and evil, and making it so that it's just been evil vs evil the whole time
I honestly think the concept from the start is kinda tiring and uninspired
~~the manga is good but getter robo go is both ugly and has never had a good animated adaptation~~
I did not forget getter robo go
It's getter, but it actually works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51X4TAnblQs
from a mechanical design standpoint
Aquarion is basically "Getter but better"
Obari recognized how stupid ZZ was and just went all in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twJTHpZnTSI
the best legacy of ZZ
Anyway
Sure, but a capacitor big enough to fire a cannon bigger than most warships had...
which doesn't make sense when it runs off a reactor but okay!!!!
it basically depletes ZZ's energy
Yeah
it just looks bad on the zz
I didn't mind the high mega cannon as a narrative device
which means ZZ has one of the worst head designs
yeah no it's a forehead cannon
but I'm just saying this is what the 8 year old would have put on paper
it is
"AND ITS SWORD IS LIKE TWICE AS BIG AS ANYONE ELSE'S"
"AND AND AND ITS FACE OPENS UP TO BE THE STRONGEST LASER EVER"
"YEAH SO OKAY SO IT TURNS INTO THREE PLANES THAT COMBINE INTO A SUPER ROBOT"
Actually most of ZZ feels like it was designed by an 8 year old
it's a super special transformer combiner etc etc
it embraces the "gundam is a toy" philosophy that the MSG movies ran away from
It's weird in a lot of ways
but partly because it doesn't look like it's designed to do much but long-range barrage
I've noticed the latin american anime community has incredible chaotic energy
https://twitter.com/DomRomArt/status/1435308984622329856
do remember that if you're trying to get people to watch the show, you're doing it with what I think is a spoiler?
as in the monogatari series or what
preferrably in an anime that treats disabilities better
just because it has one doesn't mean they can find it <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
especially girl knight heroes
I think a lot of that mistake was because there aren't exactly a lot of girl knights
You can definitely see the improvement from Tsukihime to F/SN and the higher amount of both fidelity in the expressions, and more expressions total, meaning they didn't have to be as ambiguous
Like I don't think I need to even find similar sprites? You can just go "oh yeah that's rin"
she's just so much the Akiha expy
Tohsaka was the real "original character do not steal" though
but Saber's expressions were far closer to Ciel's
Honestly iirc they both lead some expressions to Saber
well I guess ufotable does
and neither of the animes use the original character designer iirc


there's a few others but you could really see the design evolution


Rin was Akiha and Saber was Ciel
It stuck out at me like a sore thumb in 2006
It's not really obvious from most renders you get but they have like, the same expressions between Tsukihime and FSN
Ciel is saberface
saberface *started* there
??
I counted this as character moments, I think it's meant as a mystery novel first but that's the next biggest thing
It's been bothering me for a year or two because I couldn't place it
Definitely yes lmao
1) Mystery
2) Character moments
3) action scenes
and priority
in order of plot elements
F/SN is like
That's why a lot of people who have read the novel gnash their teeth at zero first, but people who just watch anime don't have a problem with it or even prefer it
And yeah
Except for Gil, I guess
but most of the others in the OG were well kept secrets until FGO got big
I feel Saber was impossible to dodge
Jean of Arc was honestly a thought I had when playing Fate back when it was a mystery
at least, before Fate genderbent 80% of all historical figures
I recall tenchi mostly being one of the late night toonami crew
If it was on toonami, man, it wasn't *that* niche
But like
3-4 timelines and continuities
Because of its like
Just, less fans because it was really hard to get to a point where you understood the series
Tenchi was on par with big o or outlaw star imo
And then you had weeb anime like Inuyasha and tenchi muyo
It was like, "normie" anime was Gundam wing and DBZ and sailor moon
Just with less total anime merch
As someone who was there it was about as merchandised as like, demon slayer
You're joking
In the 90s???
But didn't tenchi muyo create them just as much?
Dude busted his ass to get into toudai, that's pretty rad
Keitaro wasn't a 'beta'?
the final fight of SEED was two militaries under the control of *ridiculously* racist people having at each other with weapons of mass slaughter
coordinators were genetically engineered ubermensches
three ship alliance
without Kira I don't think the TSA could have really stuck
But the idea of "two shit sides fighting" didn't truly come out until Zeta, and Zeta also came up with the rather obvious fact that you need a third faction that wasn't fucking awful if you wanted the story to be enjoyable
y'know, ~~what modern UC fans wish the OYW was~~
and so you'd just be left with a story of two awful factions fighting each other
that's *why* he chased Kira down to give him that conviction
Athrun doesn't really have the conviction to do anything
more seriously though as mediocre as a character as he is, the show would fall apart and dissolve without Kira's idealism
worse
üòî
programmers and encoders are unfortunately lazy bums
"drives are bigger, why bother compressing/optimizing" has been a rather nasty trend in the last 30 years of computer science
and not just in terms of anime
it's definitely an annoying trend
Superman/Justice League media has gone over like 30 times that Lex Luthor could have elevated humanity if he didn't have a fixation on superman
But really this is pretty classic rich comic book villain stuff
I'll take your word for it since I'm never going to watch it
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
was this a filler arc because I only read the manga ~~because the anime kinda sucks~~
It still starts to get ridiculous in Battle City etc where he has zepplins built for this shit, but at the start, at least, it makes sense
not sure he could really leverage a cure for cancer with that
also iirc in the manga kaibacorp was specifically a *toy* company wasn't it
Destiny didn't use it either; it's wasted screentime
you don't drop in a massive character-defining plot point only for it to be completely pointless
astray doesn't matter in the context of writing the season
it's one of the most poinltess plot beats of all gundam, it's never built on anywhere and it could have effortlessly been cut
it doesn't even matter at the end of SEED
it's fine though because it never matters ever again üôÉ
https://twitter.com/ichiroao/status/1437483033288790017?s=19
I hope it's not but suspect it is
I have seen no trailer so ok
it's where zeon went after losing 300 times
Mars has been used in F90
am curious about it
mercury is open grounds in UC, so it could be UC
don't ruin the legacy
come on
I want a movie of really bad animation
6 is more than normal but anime is made in a larger volume now
No real reason for them to be popular then either
There was a lot coming out 2011-2014ish
Like most random events they tend to come on bunches
This honestly seems normal
Kukuruz Doans island is so bad its usually left off of rereleases fyi
Infamous as the worst-animated episode in Gundam history
<@152896851660505088>
It's real
https://twitter.com/project_brsDF/status/1438337379564097538?s=19
Isn't "they focused too much on the midseason cure" a complaint that happens every season
Yeah
(events are a little compressed and they cut out the admiral plotline, which isn't a huge deal but eh)
A's movie is worth watching too but there is a reason to watch TV for that
But I'm glad you enjoyed it
Imo movie is basically a straight up upgrade for s1
The first movie is s1 without basically any of the painful padding
My condolences
Oh
Did you watch s1 or movie
Yes
Did you watch s1 or movie
Ah yeah fair
For visual design, my vote has to be Formula Nanoha
daily motion is the site I keep being surprised isn't shut down yet
It's a little awkward to say they can't cast spells normally anymore, but being able to pivot to "running out of shells" for a tension device and casting spells with a *kachunk kachunk* is <a:aOkSpin:716004762461667329>
The cartridge system is the dumbest but best shit
Also I'll give As one thing
And I remember being frustrated by the final fight animation in TV, so the movie delivered there
It's just it works completely ok if it gets cut down
Oh no I think A's is good
||that was just drama for drama||
||either way, her using the book willingly was never really the point||
||I mean, iirc the movie solves that by having her watch nanofate *actually* defeat her friends||
The series kinda cut a corner there
The major benefits the movie got was it had the muscle to make the final fight look good
Yeah it was fine, just, it makes sense to cut
It was mostly there to give Chrono something to do
After watching it I realized the plotline actually had zero relevancy to the actual story lol
Oh did they? Didn't know
That this gets an anime before atelier
This feels fucking bad
Cagalli was fucked up though
I'm pretty sure durandal was always planned to flip
*stares at actual mythology*
4 movies and 3 series
it's easy to think of haruhi or k-on as their biggest franchises, but I guess it's really probably Free
jesus they did 4 free movies?
I was going to bring up phantom world lol
though I guess 'underrated' implies it has to actually be good
I think chuuni was a bigger deal than some of the other stuff in the last 10 years
so I think it's just Old
it was a decently big deal back in the day
idk if kanon's underrated or just forgotten
~~you can tell because it's good~~
<:chi_dab:388832384558170112>  <:yuu_dab:388832383350341632>
the anime bubble is kind of obscene yeah
even with some of them being compilations that's a lot
sorry, 5 movies
Sure
As per the <#739277869124943964> that language isn't okay
Pour all the money into the first half so you can sell merch before the show is over and you run out of money
Shaft strikes again
Magireco bombed? Sad
it's just units on a map basically
it's pretty old though
yeah
"well kawamori has a lock on the cool way to make a plane into a robot, what if we just gave them a fat plane ass"
I like them more than TSFs anyway
I'm a fan of how they'll absolutely fucking destroy you in the muvluv strategy game
alpha AoT fans vs BETA muvluv fans
Grimdark universes get the worst fans
Oh not a fan of the edgy image captions on the page but I guess I can't be surprised that muvluv fans who write a wiki are edgy
https://muvluv.fandom.com/wiki/Muv-Luv_Alternative:_Faraway_Dawn
what universe isn't that true in
also her time with Fine
literally only let sakura cook for him so she could feel good about herself
If not, it gets worse
Are you in zwei yet?
Mhm
Sakura Wars being the exception
That's fine because there's nothing to talk about there
I'm annoyed Sakura trick exists because I keep biting my tongue in confusion when trying to talk about Sakura Quest
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
the source material doesn't tend to really end very often either
yeah, I was going to say
endings can be one of the best parts of a story and honestly the lack of them is why anime trends to be so unsatisfying these days
Just kidding there's no good way to do it
Ever 17 anime when
Pork chop hands
Frontier was more direct with it, just literally handing the dude most likely to die an actual pineapple salad
And then nah he's fine
Where it *totally* feels like they're going to pineapple salad Rey
I still remember that episode of macross 7
except I guess bandai's stealing them
koto remake srw mech challenge
<a:dumbbitchjuice:656050352839196672>
by a lot
most of it
actually model kit sales are like
if pokemon was just game sales it would not be #1, so model kits are fair game
yes
it is bigger than the simpsons
should have said 17th largest media franchise in the world
the 'sameface' is still there somewhat, but everyone's unique
also Hirai's redemption as a character designer
one of the best uses of 3dcg in TV anime and very fun watch
Underrated show
Honestly this is why 00 is frustrating because even though s1 is really good and introspective of world politics, s2 basically undoes all of that in terms of giving you something to take home and think about
(80% of gundam right there)
like at most you might get a limp "war is bad" message
but they fail to grow beyond that category meaningfully
I think a lot of mecha shows make a decent mecha show - like, they explore the themes of mecha okay
it's worth noting that this is even true for the majority of gundam shows - the list of good mecha that I think *are good literary works* outside of having a cool robot is probably about 5 titles or so
by a lot a lot
Are they burning merch yet
The level 5 anime? Not yet
It gives you time to play the superior World's End Club
https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2021/10/07-1/worlds-end-harem-anime-delayed-to-january-2022
tbf brs is the best so
I really appreciate the muvluv anime's dedication to preserving the fanbase to only be people who put up with enormous amounts of shit to get to the good stuff
Using isekai to make an unconventional hero is one thing, but if it's just a self-insert vehicle, yuck
It literally only weakens the writing quality if you're not using that
Isekai is a crutch and a curse if they don't leverage advantages from their own experience to their new adventure - and not something weak like "this is like dragon quest"
Isekai for the sake of getting people like Ash to watch
Oh that is weird yeah
Meaning writing in the exposition is braindead in comparison to more nuanced world building
What I'm saying is that when you isekai you have a person who conviniently has the same world experience as the viewer that you have to explain everything to
Isekai as a lazy writing shortcut to exposition at the viewer without having to use braincells?
I don't think a love triangle is equal to a harem
"yeah a bunch of girls idolize this class rep or whatever" which honestly isn't new
Rather than just
So it would be rather difficult to really nail *Yuri* harem
Rather than just "oh isn't it nice people like me"
I feel like most shows that try to legitimately chase Yuri as a genre recognize they're in a shoujo space and relationships are more appealing in that realm when they have depth and exploration
Villainess
they've had like one hit
is there any other studio that's that good yet sucks that much at making original projects
oh bones
studio taitanic strikes again
Something something hopes and dreams
Miku is clearly the og
Miku is like 2007, Sharon is like 2040
Miku Hatsune concerts
Time to get an information high
evil steampunk victorian ~~british~~ empire and all the classics
it's basically pure fantastical adventure with sky pirates and floating islands and magical colored moons and all that fun jazz
would kill for a decent adaptation of skies of arcadia
I recall it being unexpectedly difficult
I played it too
Honestly I feel "idol anime" is mature enough as a genre it's due for an edgy deconstruction any year now
With some character growth from an absolute bitch of a main character
That's basically the whole show
If you remember the episode of shirobako where it's about choosing the voice actors and is really cynical about the industry and people's motives
Girlish number was an anime about anime production and being a voice actor in *specific*
Oh *girlish number, sorry for stroke
I bet whatever studio tried would be paid a large amount to *not* do it
I really want a childish number anime about idols
I'm assuming you want a style with some detail rather than something cartoony
Yeah I'd guess 1-2k
oh you were talking about yoh
pardon the rudeness I just don't understand why you'd say what you did if you knew
<a:questionspin:475525016994447369>
literally a lovecraftian horror
she's from another dimension
the short answer is saya isn't human
did you not play the game
Did it even get broadcast?
Isn't spice a Crunchyroll original?
Rotoscoping is where you draw over an actual video
I want an idol show that's all rotoscoped except the models couldn't dance
It could be marketing
Hyper accurate stills
The uzumaki trailer looks like more of that
Ito does not have a good track record with anime
Though if I had to pick a hero unit, Getter G
I would probably lean towards stuff like monster of the weeks and stuff
There's plenty that aren't very good but worst is a high bar
Honestly if you pick anything in the Gundam franchise as the worst mecha design ever that's a mark of limited exposure imo
No I mean did it get *broadcast* rather than just released on cr
Emiya's generally playing during a trace/projection scene, all about artificially forcing something into the world
Thematically too, now that I think about it
synths are pretty important
it won't but I feel it doesn't really work in piano
reading is more immersive if it's well written and you're an experienced reader
either option's fine with me as long as it has an ending (unless it's episodic by nature)
||as long as you don't mind disabled people being thrown under the bus||
isn't there jojo crossover memes for any anime in that period of the 2010s
~~read worm~~
I mean fair but blame evol on kawamori
like I wouldn't trust ACTAS series either
when your screwups are the hottest topics of discussion that year, things change
Idk I think a studio's original projects speak the loudest
My reaction to seeing cloverworks
https://tenor.com/view/worried-kermit-kermit-the-frog-muppets-stressed-gif-7121337
I think the closest thing I've watched to this is Sakura Quest and it's not all that close
Yes
How did the writing feel gross
A, R, D, J, and W stood for things but after that I think they were just winging it
I forgot which
Either k or l
Another example is the "punch Bruno with it to accelerate his soul out of his body" or whatever
Gold experience definitely changed over time in part 5 and not because it was evolving
Though I have heard Japan is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è on SBR
7 is pretty universally loved in the west
I don't hate it but it's weak spots are very much there
~~part 3 has a lot of fair critiques~~
Once they actually got to Cairo part 3 is good yeah
As would having undeflectable emerald splash, mystery solved!
Just clearly a staff passion thing
It's so dumb and badly fitting lmao
like I dimly remember a just like, 90 second boobs and butts sequence that did nothing for the movie
also there is fanservice of the worst kind
but the action sequences in the last, idk, quarter of the movie were sick
in addition the final fight is stupid and just kind of out of the blue
Infinity spends a lot of time doing basically nothing just to give long-time fans a chance to say "oh, this is what X character is doing now"
when mazinger has a theme at *all* (it's usually generic hero time) it's "mazin can make you into a god or a devil"
mazinger and devilman are also pretty close
yeah I'd even say that devilman and getter are two sides of the same theme
who just doesn't survive that
Maybe they were an alien or something
Considering what happened to Pizza and Penchinon, I have never actually figured out what was going on there
~~especially since getting zonderfied is a net positive, post-purification~~
one's significantly more fucked up
I dunno, I feel zonder metal and algernon aren't really all that comparable
there's certainly body horror but betterman runs on themes of existential horror and humanity just kinda suckin shit and needing to be saved by others
Like, idk, I just don't think "gaogaigar" and "people commit suicide to help the world preserve itself" are benefitted by being in the same setting as each other
I think they would have been good or better as an original work
But I don't think the good parts of it have benefitted from the nature of a crossover
yes
Right, but that's what the sequel manga did
is humor enough of a reason to diminish the writing of both works by combining them though
it's basically like putting Elfen Lied in power rangers
I would have preferred if they were just different settings
I dunno, it feels like their themes are a little conflicting
Like if we want to talk stiff animation, the trend of making anime look like they're just slightly animated manga panels is on the rise
All of these things are in anime, with maybe an exception for voice acting
What they're potentially missing out on is merchandising opportunities, which it makes sense to dodge backlash for
The same amount of money
Like
Ah, but CR makes money whether they release HGS or not <@331908049822547978>
You can believe in your product and still be marketing wise lol
They're not always worse but it's generally a neutral wash
The older I've gotten the more I've noticed that delays don't mean things get better
it's such a good design, one of like the only times I've ever seen heterochromia add to a character design
why are they just leaving money on the counter
twin turbo isn't in the mobile game???
Ocean cats
It's a mystery novel
Well, when you've born and bred so that rich people can make money off of you...
the irony is that the increased carpentry activity would lead to a higher demand for glue
because ernie is like
I need to actually watch knights and magic but it seems like it pretty easily hits a degree of cringe?
but it doesn't stop them from being an audience stand-in for exposition purposes
I've noticed a lot of isekais actually avoid trying to go for self-insert - the character usually has some ridiculous flaw
but it also gives an easy "mysterious stranger" kind of thing for them to hook all the waifus on
but not only is an isekai'd protagonist dirt easy to write for, because you can just talk at them like they're the audience
and affecting the setting
and abilities
with a native character finding their own goals
the story could have been done better without being an isekai
almost always
and here's what really gets me
no I'm mostly teasing there
ok good talk
and, honestly, the major failing point of them seems to be the pivot point where the protagonist starts transitioning from "disadvantaged" to "has found a effective lever to use to start pushing on the setting"
I think the problem is that even the better entries fall prey to the same problems
the isekai boom is literally only a single decade
90% of the whole category is the current industry
you can kind of tell a lot of times that the author actually doesn't know where the fuck the story's going to go longterm
this is kind of a problem with LNs in general though
it can be, and authors frequently get carried away with their cool fictional fantasy world instead of actually putting a good narrative with themes in their story
in a generic fantasy setting that's just non-standard enough that it's not even comfortably familiar
I think it's almost worse when isekais try to worldbuild a little because it's almost always bland politics
samurai jack
you want a good isekai
And as a result the world generally feels generically fantasy, which is definitely a problem people have with the genre
because basically all isekais right now are authors being inspired by other modern isekai works and going "I can do this better/I have a cool gimmick"
It is, but you generally have to go back to find stuff that isn't in the formula to some degree
no, not really
is it in the isekai genre?
Is inuyasha an isekai? Yes, in the most technical sense of the word
but like
well, I guess one general formula
isekai's come to really be one specific formula
isekai isn't just "there is another world involved"
that's core to the isekai genre
but the problem is
isn't asterisk the most like A-1 show to ever exist
then the shows should be ending *way* earlier
if the interesting part is the character learning to adapt to the world
and like
this is true for most isekais
but the main plot could be hooked into without too much effort
There would be some changes especially to the early bits about why subaru makes some gaffes etc
Writing fantasy people like they have modern problems is a fucking goldmine of interesting ideas that just get skipped over for isekai
a fantasy hikki would fundamentally be more interesting from the get-go
in fact
It's not like fantasy people don't have hopeless lives
it does not have to be a *local* native if you really want to push that
It would be pretty similar with a world native
as an example
from what I know of re:zero, 99% of it does not need isekai to work
Knights and Magic is actually one of the bare handful of isekai shows that fundamentally doesn't work in any other way but isekai
mary sue qualified for everything
~~I actually didn't like the fights too much personally since they're choreographed to look less like a fight and more like a performance. I know it's kinda the point, but I always felt like it was missing something~~
I mean there are a few things I can think of as semi-negative but it's still far above average
it's about girls in leotards dance fighting on stage, it seems like your thing
kinda shocked you never watched it
yeah true
WOAH
Every damn time man
https://youtu.be/koS3I_gbeo0
I actually liked this simply because ||they were really playing with motifs of destruction vs creation, and the idea that the good guys were the forces of destruction and the bad guys were the forces of creation was really neat. also how do you counter infinite regeneration? infinite destruction||
||the idea that even copies of the brave AIs are too heroic to be villains is so good||
man gaogaigar final is full of so many bad plot threads, but
Maybe "admirable" was the word she meant
Yooo that's sick
yeah it's the japanese title
from what I've heard they've got that weird edgy vibe pocket full of rainbows has
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
more alt universe stuff
they're not good
yeah
oh they're just syncing with the original vas
yeah I'm unhappy about that still
I don't know anyone who liked the movie no
Totsugeki love heaaaaart
<a:thinkspin:393587517196075009>

https://twitter.com/Usssshi/status/1449006412340760577?t=WgLYYM2VDampUxmbYqwhFw&s=19
Lmao that sounds pretty good
It absolutely is but there's a gigantic "but," attached to it
I always laugh really nervously when someone says yuyuyu is disabled rep
wow look at iski bragging about reading porn
proof that only the unicorn mode is good
<@87512939107450880>
pretty good aside from the bad Leaf habit of putting every girl's route as the main route
I played the original underwater ray romano
hahaha
better visually on the whole, but the storytelling of the original is still masterclass
the second half it felt like Gainax was whispering to me, "hey, is this cool yet?" over and over
but the first half is definitely some of the best super robot content out there
mixed feelings about GL
I have
I'm eternally sad the SRW OG anime adaptations are shit
~~it's thanksgiving in the states~~
has it been a straight shot since futari wa or did they only do a season every year after a while
Ernie is as magically bullshit a programmer as kira Yamato so don't feel bad about not matching up
there's also a lot of signature Trigger budget cuts used artistically
yet make conversation more human
I really enjoy gridman's intentionally awkward cuts to make everything slightly less real
The exposition dump at the end of the movie is as much a joke as it is exposition
Plot heavy is questionable
Promare is an action movie also full disclosure it is gay in the other direction
Promare
Ironically they're rarely incentivized to ever animate the final ending volumes of an ln
Anime adaptations only exist to advertise new volumes of the ln
<:coconaWHEW:252677693877911552>
https://twitter.com/SENTINELcoltd/status/1465153544244375558?t=_SAJDwTZcjC2VovhHPGohw&s=19
Does that even exist
So you want explicit gay yet not sad trauma
the "power rangers" version of Gridman
Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad
I forgot about that.
the main villain of SSSS was tim curry
oh my god
SSSS is in the title for a reason
the neon genesis highschool students are named after the *american* version of gridman assist weapons
also fun fact
The robots are from gridman too
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gridman_the_Hyper_Agent_characters#Assist_Weapons
uhhh
I guess it's technically shows since they're both based on *both* hyper agent gridman and SSSS
aren't they based off the same show
Gridman is definitely kinda yuri
when do they explain in gridman about when inferno cop got spiral power
genesis was basically spirits but with unicorn so that makes sense
Loran was definitely worse though what he is is up to you
judau maybe
shiro was definitely better than some newtype pilots
being a newtype doesn't actually make you a premium pilot
too far, honestly, but I think the reasoning behind that is mostly game design rather than narrative
30 made narrative's story and presentation a lot better than the movie actually was imo
at least by gundam MC standards
and canonically jona's kind of a shit pilot
that's completely accurate to narrative being a really mediocre gundam entry
no
||Drill missiles or a melee combo or something||
A little sad they didn't give ||Full Power Gridman|| just one more attack
I don't think so
it's very 90s
I don't think SSSS actually had a real conclusion
kilokhan, though I only am able to answer this because I'm staring at the wiki page
it's where the SSSS in the trigger shows comes from
it was brought up when it first came up but there's really no similarities in shot composition or anything, and symphogear hardly invented "big sword"
no
||that's Akane||
Oh
Or the girl at the end?
The girl in a hoodie?
Who
Yes
||f||
|| all of gridman exists in some wild existential questions||
||does it excuse her if Yuta isn't real?||
I have a feeling actually watching hyper agent Gridman and ssss both might give some hints about the metaphysics but <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
||that said the world still exists and continues on without her involvement so...||
||the whole world was basically her dream/imagination, more or less. So she just woke up and moved on now that her heart was healed by Gridman||
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQz4JqAyH9M
wait to find out how shining gundam shows up to the new york fight
Tbf it's full of *national* stereotypes
I will be curious if this was by intent and the crossover season ties it up
I think gridman ended up being a better show, but I think Dynazenon is more ambitious and really did some ambitious things with themes that I don't feel it got to *finish*
Every time I get slightly tempted to watch it I get sidetracked into rewatching Sakura Quest
Gay, good, explicit, happy - pick two

- the anime industry
it's more a shame just because SBR's really good
skipping SBR isn't really a huge deal for jojolion's plot
I am curious if they'd go straight to jojolion
just have johnny ride on some JK's shoulders
replace them with umamusus
horses just suck and they're everywhere in SBR
Part 5's AD said that, it's possible David could still do it without him
well that's not correct
David Production's said they refuse to animate the horses in 3d and therefore it's probably never getting done
but if it's going to get animated, it's probably not going to be david production
it is
much less likely to see part 7 ever get animated
are much
We also
Part 7 wasn't even marketted as Jojo for several years into its run
the manga is 'far ahead' but *especially* after this part there's very little relation
yeah
so the response is more staggered
but "oh I've gotta binge 12, gotta make time for that"
it's easier to get everyone to watch one ep
the hype is also probably lower because like when it's weekly
I think that's partly because netflix releases aren't as exciting as weekly
If it's not the end game, getting together is going to mean they're either thrown into drama or sidelined and given no screentime
The problem is I feel all realistic romance anime are kind of by definition slow burns
The downside of only caring if things are gay
I will always recommend shirobako to anyone who knows the name of an anime studio that isn't ghibli
I don't think inheritance works that way
film makes sense
yes please don't make a game of sexual assault in anime
it was basically a whole episode
anyway trailer seems ok
honestly the uh, 'trans' representation in it alone makes it pretty hard for me to recommend but the rest was a solidly average-good show
sure, some, but it's definitely fairly overlooked
how many people remember gargantia
idk
(franxx lol)
feeling that it's going to be a disaster when an industry just shoves big names onto something
I always have this
hopefully its good
I mean if you're going to use 3d for your action setpieces you might as well lean on the good half of that
SD Gundam Force
I forgot a gundam TV series
also
I don't think sunrise existed yet
anyway that's like
god I forgot Turn A, shoot me
right, but you also have OVAs and movies
Nue
MSG, Z, ZZ, V, Wing, G, X, Turn A, SEED, Destiny,00, 002 AGE (lol), like 4 gunpla anime (I've legitimately lost count), IBO, IBO2, Gundam Unicorn Even Worse Version
I'll start with the series
alright lemme list off the major ones
I never realized gundam was the studio's third project though
but doing compilation movies etc would definitely send it that high
I'm not sure there is
not exactly because there's that many gundam animated series
that's pretty reasonable I think
s2 is digital animation
sorry, s1 backgrounds are done with that style
I just figured it was purely an homage rather than "yeah we worked on this"
the backgrounds are all done with a similar watercolor style and gothic architecture as batman TAS
I mean it's pretty open about it being batman inspired
this makes things make a lot of sense
I didn't realize that big O staff were literally on batman TAS lmao
regarding sunrise: Studio 6 was created in 1983. Notable works include The Big O, Sgt. Frog, and Tiger & Bunny. they also provided animation to Batman: The Animated Series. Some members left to form Bridge in 2007.
not dead
definitely not the studio they used to be but
Sunrise is definitely big but Dynamic Pro, Studio Nue, and Ashi are all very prominent
also the braves in the 90s
they've done stuff like votoms and layzner and l-gaim and such
anyway uh
man I forgot nippon sunrise is sunrise <:verytired:739234579994640424>
there's quite a few studios that were big mecha producers from the 70s to 90s
Studio Nue, Ashi Productions
and I think you're over representing sunrise
Many sunrise projects had pretty unrelated talent working on them
personally? yeah, I think it does
Both having psychic kids with laser swords
Past the 80s though it becomes hard to see where mecha's inspired by star wars and where it's ripping off gundam
likely, yeah

<:CharlotteSip:709139006939725924>
Zeta's more inspired than MSG was I think
that said
about a year after the japanese release
the release of star wars was one of the biggest pop culture events of the 20th century, no exaggeration
basically every fictional scifi property for the next 20 years after 1977 that had a laser sword is inspired by star wars
yes
Wild flowers is a mediocre op but it's so good as an instrumental
It feels more like cubix or something
I don't think sd Gundam force is bad but it's definitely a kids show in the way no other Gundam is
G reco, age, and SD Gundam are the ones eternally forgotten
Imo not really
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
because they were made like 20 years after Zeta
I *Did* forget to put the Zeta movies because I wanted to put them near the end
OH
oh I did mention hathaway god there's too much
Hathaway's Flash etc
yeah I definitely forgot stuff
you can ignore literally half this list and you'll still be more educated on gundam than most gundam fans
There's also G-Saviour but that's live action so it's not sunrise
Gundam Evolve (released sporadically over 10 years), and probably something else I've forgotten
movies and OVAs: Gundam (1, 2, 3), CCA, F91, 0080, 0083, 08th MS Team, 08th MS team movie version, Turn A (1+2), Endless Waltz (Movie), Endless Waltz (OVA), MS Igloo 1, MS Igloo 1.5, MS Igloo 2, Origin, like 3 fucking more gunpla anime, Unicorn, Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt 2, NT, hathaway, G Reco movies (2 and counting), Astray ONA, Astray Stargazer, SD Gundam shorts (released sporatically over about 15 years), SD Gundam Sangokuden Brave Battle Warriors, SD Gundam World Sangoku Soketsuden, SD Gundam World Heroes
you know what? no, I'll include it as part of the OVA list because even if they're full length shows they had a web only release
that no one ever mentions because it's incredibly fucking niche
oh, another show I forgot
tomino went total auteur and storyboards and cuts are incredibly hard to follow
G Reco is really hard to watch
also forgot G Reco but uh
they have a lot of visual gags like Elmeth mice
yes, but it's actually pretty fun if you know a lot of gundam
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I shouted in disbelief when I saw she did Borr in gridman
there's some you'd never realize aoi is in unless you were told
Island culture values blue as a color
I heard fuzors get less awful after the midpoint but I couldn't make it
Century zero is okay, fuzors is dogshit, I think genesis is okay, know nothing of wild
not really strongly related
all this time, ash and pikachu are anchors to connect everything
but it didn't
digimon supertechnovolves or whatever the gimmick of the season is do not
small cat evolving into big tiger makes sense
far, far less sense for newcomers
also digimon made
I think probably what killed it for good in the west was when future digimon seasons stopped using the OG cast
isn't this most anime originals
similar but not identical voices for this one

she is my favorite pokegirl so I follow developments closely
that's how you know the new Lusamine unit in pokemon master sex is on the good side
I would have enjoyed if Todd was the brock replacement for Orange Islands
anyone but tracey
(which is why it's fucked they still didn't let Ash win the league)
I know XY was where it really picked up into long plot arcs
whether it's a shitty season or not
though pokemon's highly episodic nature (up until black/white? I think?) probably did it a lot of favors in terms of being a good saturday morning cartoon
this doesn't stop pokemon from doing numbers as an anime
game's also getting free dlc
k-on basically invented/popularized the indulgent genre of just watching girls eat cake and calling it entertainment
cute girls doing cute things
on the plus side does that mean I don't have to watch the side materials
I was more referring to the fact that many adaptations get produced as web novel > light novel > manga > anime
Don't you love the modern anime pipeline where the same story gets sold 4 times
But it's definitely a comedic loveletter
Less a parody, exactly; they didn't expect any viewers to understand references
She doesn't pop while a lot of characters do
Frontier uses *very* vibrant stages and backgrounds and she's always colored in low saturation pastels
I think part of it might be that she usually looks so desaturated?
I don't think the design is ugly but it never made me go "aw yeah that's it"
Something about the way frontier did shading and eyes always made Sheryl look not as hot as she's supposed to be to me
This is actually probably a gundam reference, just like symphogear's was

lio fotia still A+ character design
update: promare still good movie
they'd fit together interestingly
||Ancient Shem-Ha||
you know who noriko's VA is right
with the TOTALLY NOT CHARIOTS OF FIRE bgm
Aim for the Top!/Top wo Nerae! is even named after a tennis anime named Aim for the Ace/Ace wo Nerae
that's because the first episode (and partially the second) is a sports anime parody
really good stuff
ohta's probably like the 3rd or 4th best commander in mecha
Aw
Is it a good show besides yuri
you didn't, but like
so why ride someone's ass about this
you did say you liked it though
I don't think bleach was any better solo
(honestly, 2006 homunculi are conceptually more interesting)
so the creative staff at bones wrote their own stuff
like what homunculi were, or the existence of Father
when FMA 2006 aired there was a lot of details not clear in the manga
brotherhood is the manga-accurate adaptation bones did after the manga was complete
there are two FMA anime
brotherhood is not the 2006 anime being referenced by that image
fma got a sequel of itself
yeah...
(it was actually kinda neat and being a healer who can cast photon made me very happy)
like "I played Tales of Eternia Online" fan
I say this as a *long* time fan of the franchise
has there ever been a tales adaptation worth watching
(relatively speaking; the ending's such a small part of it)
sure, they never end satisfactorily, the old shounens never ended either
it doesn't match up well against the LN pieces where there's exciting developments fairly often
it came across very "works shouldn't hope to be like one piece"
if you like a work that does similar stuff, why shred it
I mean, it's just not worth it
since we never get to the end in anime
this is already how isekai work though
cute girls doing cute things with a self insert boy
yeah zestiria is pretty dull
the TV series is just full of off-model frames
it's just the worst animated one
no I hope I didn't give the impression this was the only badly animated episode
and is *extremely* episodic, so it has little impact on the rest of the series and vice versa
It's got a mildly interesting plot about a defected Zeon general who just wants to sit out the war iirc
it was bad
even for MSG


*Sunrise* releases omitted it
"oh it didn't make it to the west"
And we're not talking like
from the original 0079 TV
Actually it's an episode so infamous for bad animation and an oddball plot it's legit removed from a lot of VHS and DVD releases
I still can't believe they're making shit about kukuruz doan
f
basically every anime just sells worse in subsequent seasons and the main reason to make the anime in the first place is to advertise upcoming volumes
but it is a different world
it may not be a different planet
a different time period is a different world
you need to be ridiculously prestige like jojo to get that
I think it's completely fair because not being formulaic audience inserts is part of what makes them stand out
How can you hate a Isekai protagonist who is like "hold on let me go back to my world to get some stuff for the trip"
I would also advance kagome as an option

Could be worse
I'll just leave it at that
Madoka was not the source of the first chomp memes
As a warning though it gets pretty dark and like
And then they get to the vns and get disgusted that it has different voice actors
Imagine someone struggling through the anime and actually getting hooked on muvluv
with spaceships and everything
but in the TV series we rapidly tech up and just become a galactic power on our own
the first stargate movie is more like GATE
It's as much about leaving your own environment and being in one you have less control in
Yeah I do but I hope you see my counterpoint
since they've expanded their world to include the galaxy
If only because I'd argue they have not truly left their own world
Hm I think there is a serious discrepancy there
and that was the whole story
the first movie had them go an alien planet and then were stuck there all movie
Stargate movie is an isekai, Stargate TV isn't
as long as the setting is alien and strongly clashing with the protagonist's experiences
yeah
Twain's definitely has a story that feels much more at home in modern isekai stories though lmao
I did yeah, which is about 20 years earlier than Twain, good point
but that's about 20 years later
John Carter of Mars is the next closest I can think of
unless someone's got something from earlier
tell me this doesn't sound like an isekai anime
> After some initial confusion and his capture by one of Arthur's knights, Hank realizes that he is actually in the past, and he uses his knowledge to make people believe that he is a powerful magician. He attempts to modernize the past in order to make people's lives better, but in the end he is unable to prevent the death of Arthur and an interdict against him by the Catholic Church of the time, which grows fearful of his power.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%27s_Court
and time travel isekai is *the oldest* form of isekai
There's genuine merit in examining stories about a character thrust into a new world
I feel that's overly limiting
Only if you're set in isekai only meaning the lukewarm trash that all follows the exact same structure
Including apollo
Worst casualty of it
Really I just feel that what the ova+Evol did to fudo suuuucks
Because it's a compilation movie type deal where they're retelling the story
It's where the beast form in the crossover episode comes from
She also betrays them again in the ova and then gets better
It sucks
And that's why she's cursed
Yeah they retcon that with the ova and say that the third person was a traitor who betrayed the other two and reincarnated in reika/lihua
Remember that really cool point near the end of sousei where they drop a strong hint that fudo was the third original element
There is but the part I'm thinking of may have been the ova
The aquarion movie already was doing stupid retcons
It's alright
I think mikono could have done alright if the love triangle wasn't there and her desires weren't always front and center of things that could derail everything
All the more annoying parts of apollo
So not likeable
Kagura was just
Mikono was definitely not great but the amata split self thing was just always the worst part of the show before we hit the end and suddenly everything was worse than that
Don't know how they could make such an interesting idea so boring
Fuck that show
Arata is the goober from danball senki wars
Amata whoops
Just a love triangle that wasn't really enjoyable whatsoever
Arata/what's his name was going to be awkward and shit no matter what I think
Idk
I think every other bad twist was already preset
Maybe if he stayed on zessica (best girl) would have been saved but
The ideas were still his
It would have been bad if he didn't leave
See also the poly ending of frontier
Neither, kawamori just can't resist bad ideas
The whole moral of most of the show  is "gender roles are good, actually"
Franxx was bad from the start though
Like sure the mecha designs aren't as good as sousei but everything else is on point
The first cour of Evol was super strong
Logos was dull unless you really like Japanese puns
The crossover episode, not logos
If you haven't watched it you need to
At least the crossover episode they aired before aquarion logos was good
But everything at the end is a stupid mess
The strip fight was like, peak aquarion
Yunoha's arc was fucking powerful
Aquarion Evol was the best super robot anime ever made until it was suddenly awful
Woof
Did the truth ever come out about why he was fired from basquash?
He can't not meddle
Kawamori could be in charge of muvluv anime
But then it falls off a cliff
See it sucks because Evol at its best is *way better* than sousei
Evol is worth watching but *you will* dislike parts of it
Then come here and complain
Then aquarion Evol
Sousei no aquarion
All the side characters are better than the main three
Macross frontier
Sousei is a good time but it's kinda like uh
I do prefer subs but I've heard it's not awful
Rena is great and I'm really happy she's a playable pilot in srw z
I liked the maybe-reincarnated-vampire better than zen
Zen fudo is a lot worse and mostly his good point is he's voiced by fujikei (rip)
Gen fudo is one of my favorite mecha supporting characters
And it was a warm fuzzy reveal at the end of sousei and makes sense why he's so invested in everything
Yes
I mean fucking everyone else had ||their soul broken into pieces,|| why not
It also changes him from an old friend lining up domino's to a coward who backed out of his responsibilities
girlish number
I'm sure there's plenty of bait in whatever idol anime will be dropping
cute girl assassination squad
there are many kinds of ugly
I want cute girls doing ugly things
no but it's not like I want the old ways back
their passing will not be missed by me
It should be better than it is with that concept but it's still fun
Yes akb is about guerilla concerts
Nah the only modern idol macross is like the worst one
Or akb
I've been told I have a lot of domination points
<a:angerawoo:824436671037964328>
Loris it's 6 episodes
Is finale as good as the 10 year wait would suggest
Just finish it
6 episodes
It's like
Live action yes but less so with anime
Hm maybe, though both the winter song uniforms and the gears were miles better than the axz forms
Millaarc had the best design in xv
people don't call it a last chapter if it's not the end
Astro Boy Omega Factor
reminds me of uh
I love celebrations of an author's work
Shin Mazinger Z Hen is probably the best mazinger work though
I still need to read that
the only other good thing about the movie is the ashura z is kind of a neat design
I can see it
though I do prefer kaiser nova to kaiser blades
imo the best animated mazinkaiser content
mazinkaiser ova was pretty fun
koji kabuto dies in lava
a lot of shows in the 90s were trying to hit that vibe with EDs but they frequently sucked ass
the GGG ED isn't like my favorite because it's not flashy but honestly it's like one of the best 'comfort' EDs I've ever heard
actually circling back to eds for a moment
so I can cry for about 300 years straight
I want the rest of the manga to get a movie
man now that I'm thinking of Girls Last Tour again
do ro shii lainlaito just hurts
holy shit it's bad to hear that all the time in japanese
when one of the main characters is named Dorothy Wainright
something similar is honestly why I think Big O's dub really hits better for me, on the opposite side of that
stuff that the dub is honestly quite possibly better than the sub
maybe Outlaw Star
I think like, Big O's the only one that's up there with that for me
yeah
if it came out today I think it'd be jojo big
man yuyu hakusho was so fucking good
even though I don't think there's a song out there that sounds *more* early 00s anime than this lmao
SEED's ed 1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqsoiun3pnY
ah, wait, I think I have my final candidate of favorite ED
but if they did Beyond the Time is pretty legendary
There's a few movie EDs I'd pick but I don't *really* think they count
you just can't compete with that bassline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afXl2o82mmA
it's incredibly overshadowed by the OP
though I mean
I also have a pretty soft spot for Diebuster's ED
even though it legit sounds like it's a track that escaped from a Sonic Adventure game
I'm also going to say Fly Away from Eureka 7 I think
another minase banger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUX45e4Iecc
also Girls Last Tour
I was about to say Flip Flappers
Hm favorite eds
I've heard it sucks ass to have 867 5309
Because sometimes ichi has to go
idk kannazuki just does a loooot to be edgy so keep that in mind if you want to watch it
you see the post-scene but no actual proof of how far it went
wait I think the anime leaves it vague whether it actually happened, but it definitely happens in the manga
iirc
the event still happens, with a flute
not fully

Still, ACTAS has always excelled at one half of being an "animation production studio" and been fucking awful at the other half
well when you take 2 years to draw 40 minutes...
Also, while the major reason it was dropped was that I was tuning in weekly, I do remember not liking, like, any of the songs
The budget drop was very noticeable
I'll get to eventually probably
I thought it was neat but running out of steam when I dropped it, but I was highly impacted by knowing too many theater girls in high school
I dropped the series near the end I should rewatch it
Because she kind of is but they call her(except not her?) takamina in the show anyway
Does Minami Takahashi count as an anime character
"kiss or nothing" is such a western take
I think the closest we get to an identity crisis is he's frustrated he's taken less seriously as a girl
can't wait for another wave of people who think scott is a role model
personally I prefer characters to be well done
then they're not your audience anymore
"but what about when they do grow up"
when you have an audience that never grows up you can sell toys to them forever
it's like pokemon
cure top, cure bottom, cure vers
hm I read that as Cure Bottom
I've been curious about yuyuyu but everything about it sounds like I don't want to get into it because I'll just be told later I watched it wrong
simps?
aw why would you do that
yep seems to be the case
I've never given an adaptation a 10/10
I should really watch it
just animate pokemon ranger
I don't particularly like it but it definitely made waves when it came out
it becomes a LN staple to do so though
huh I think they don't actually use punctuation
or whatever ridiculous punctuation they use
My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute?!
yeah
I think oreimo is the most to blame for it really taking off?
I mean you're the one who mentioned spending too much time on things that don't matter at all
I definitely don't hate strikers but I think it's the weakest of the three. Maybe. s1's first quarter or so is absolutely dreadful imo so it's hard to assess
like they can do anything and they just recreate america, but with some magic
My biggest problem with strikers is it devotes an absolute absurd amount of time to worldbuilding... to create a pretty uninteresting world
it's just the "look" of modern animation really puts an emphasis on high saturation colors most of the time
though I feel like digital animation has reached a point where they can compete if the art director wishes
watercolors are really great
(honestly my biggest complaint about Strikers' worldbuilding is the backgrounds are *ass*)
really stale cookiecutter stuff
and they tend to have really geometric backgrounds
And like so much of it could have been cut down
There's "not rushing the plot" and then there's "dragging your feet"
especially when it's what you *start* with
8 episodes of training arc is just terrible
there are entire quality anime you could watch in the time before strikers gets going
when it gets good it's fun but god
I agree a lot with strikers
~~also the first three monsters of the week are the single worst looking magical girl monsters I've ever seen~~
she takes 20 minutes instead of 80 minutes to learn how to use her magic staff and you don't really get to know her family that basically stop showing up in the anime after episode 6 anyway
As definitely has to get a little ambitious with the movie and I don't think it's 'better', but I don't think the s1 movie is even particularly fast paced
~~hello diebuster how are you~~
Imagine an episode exploring a character that you never see again
like
There's a difference between not core to the plot and not useful to the story
I feel similarly about the As movie - people object that it cuts the admiral graham plotline. I, quite honestly, really don't think it's all that worth keeping - if it means you gotta spend like 30 minutes on it - unless I guess you're a big Chrono fan
3 and a half then
I wouldn't completely hate it but I'm absolutely willing to toss it if it means skipping the first four episodes
s1 is about Nanoha and Fate's relationship; the show didn't really start until Fate showed up. Might as well cut to the chase.
Cutting out her family is a net positive and I feel the only thing really lost at *all* is her relationship with her friends
you mean where it skips the first 3 episodes in 20 minutes? I felt that was the single best strength of the movie, honestly
The beginning of digital animation was just a dark time
Older than that and anime looks better, newer than that and anime looks better
I don't hold it against the creators for looking bad
Yeah, it was made at the worst time to make anime for cheap
That coupled with being one of the worst looking anime I know of is just a bad combo
Not all characterization is valuable
that fits everything involving nanoha's family to a T
last episode:
first episode:
lmao I flipped through a blog that reviewed the OVA

though I don't think the planetarian OVA had that issue
probably
no please the old kyoani was so bad
Granbelm was neat and I hope it makes srw someday
But nothing I'm gonna pick up I think
Good shit
I saw
post-konosuba world where everything has to be some degree of parody
Then I'll keep it for now
Some tracks are the same though
I'm trying updated but unsure if that's the right move
I had to close the game after the first time hitting the menu music
Which is a fucking nostalgia bomb
I'm busy playing the remake of 1
Underwater ray romano?
memes aside, I'm absolutely frustrated we'll never see a panty and stocking sequel - the thematics of angels as forces of chaos vs demons of order was so unique
I was good at not caring
Let's do the time warp again was sung at some point every day
No idea if zoomer girls care as much
Yes
In quotes of rhps
The need for counterculture in general yeah
Whether it's garish or goth
And they typically wear really, really off-fashion choices
They tend to be extroverts or at least highly energetic (good fucking luck doing theatre without lots of personal energy)
They think Tim curry and rocky horror picture show is the peak of human artistic creation
Granted this is like 12 years out of date but
The term drama queen exists for a reason
That was less an indictment against theatre in revue and more just me being terminally exhausted by my memories of working with theatre girls
I spent 3 years as a backstage hand and theater tech
People don't get into theatre to be a bit part so they tend to have a need to be unique
In my experience theatre is pretty gay but less in the "I'm gay" way and more in a "look how different and special I am" way
She just likes her friend
yeah, revue is more terminally shojo than outright homosexual
endings are good!
Wrestling is also very homoerotic yet the WWE has very little gay
I would agree that revue has more homoeroticism than gear but that may not equal more gay to everyone
Look at rwby
Also number of fan pairings if anything has an inverse relationship to how gay a show actually is
And of course the whole Miku thing
Idk there's that whole bit in G where Kirika and Shirabe are singing about how much they love each other while going hard
Demon lord reverse isekais himself and gets a part time job
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Is_a_Part-Timer!
This is basically hataraku maou-sama
fwiw I googled her name and got 4 different ways to spell it in 5 results
but there is a difference between 'best practice' and 'wrong'
which is generally why there's a diacritical mark there
translating is just a bonkers field that gets more complex the more you look into it
examples of actors that do would be GACKT or  M„ÉªA„ÉªO
really, unless an actor makes their stage name stylized in english there isn't a 'right way' to do it in english
"I know more about japanese culture than whoever wrote this" to say they're somehow smearing her name by writing it like this
it just comes off kind of like
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese#Modern_systems
If anything, Y≈´ki is generally considered "more right" than Yuuki
none are inherently wrong as long as they're applied consistently
**there's several ways to do romanization**
okay I'm going to repeat this again
it's correctly spelled ÊÇ†Êú® Á¢ß and there's several ways to do romanization
it's neither
they did
It was awful
they did an okay job with kirby though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55iX64NmUDA
you can't stop someone else from screwing up, you just have to learn how to either deal with disappointment or problem solve on the spot
yeah
I feel if you use some sort of middleman aggregate app you are compounding the chances that something goes wrong
rather than the theater
I've always bought directly from the event hoster - Fathom Events, etc
there is zero way to protect yourself in your life from other people screwing up
But in general
so afaik the way to avoid it is just read the page you're buying from closely
I've never heard of this happening to anime showings
funny to look back on, but what does the 1997 american kid know about japanese cuisine
like 4kids deserves a lot of shit but I think jelly donuts was not a bad localization move
I can definitely say as a kid I wouldn't have a fucking clue how a triangle with a black strip could be a "rice ball" or why you would eat one
jelly donuts wasn't censorship though
In the 00s it was rie kugimiya for example
I don't know them but probably because there's always a rising star
why not, paper is cheap
oh this is a manga whoops
it's not really a question of "will this make us money" so there's nothing to really greenlight
well generally the manga/novel publisher is footing most of the bill
born out of a laboratory where they attempted to condense moe into a single character package

they already did that
I mean shirobako is 90% (by episode)2 episode chunks of setting up a cliffhanger and then resolving it and there's nothing wrong with that format
(to be fair to konosuba it's one of the few that really commits to the bit)
the desire to write milquetoast isekais and pretending they are parodies of milquetoast isekais
konosuba disease strikes again
the characters aren't as good but the action is better
you could watch dynazenon
what do you want
at least hathaway's flash will probably be competent even if I don't like that story
yeah....
anime movies are less popular on pirate streaming sites than shows
I wouldn't watch it with someone else in the room so you don't have to have those conversations
just yknow
It's definitely not sexualized
~~as long as you're okay with little girl nips in transformation sequence~~
nanoha s1 is not a pretty anime, but you could watch the movie instead yeah
not everyone's gonna like it and it isn't perfect
granbelm is a pretty decent 7.5/10
you could give gaogaigar a shot
and there are two returning characters from gridman
Definitely the one thing that was begging for the biggest facelift
TV A's final fight is both boring and the monster looks like melting glue
This was probably the biggest step up
the movies take ideas from the PSP games and a few other things but are not an adaptation of any of them
they are not
movie continuity splits off here with the moderate differences between As TV and As Movie
nah
so 'watch order' is a little complicated
past this point there are two different canons
~~including "stop here because it's a great ending point"~~
lots of options
after that there are
yes
just because TV's animation or lack thereof really catches up to it at the very end
TV is probably the way to go for As but honestly might be worth doing both
again though this is totally the kind of thing I'm willing to accept people *do* consider major, especially since it has relevance for like 2 minutes in StrikerS
It has relevance but the narrative doesn't even *blink* for missing it
it's pretty much the definition of a side plot
I don't consider that major
yeah
though they are nice to include
I don't think I consider anything the movie cut as particularly major
if that makes sense
so they're both As
they're both the same story
it depends on your definition of major
are there though
there isn't a single plotline you missed in s1 that will ever matter again
I don't think As is a more holy experience or anything
I don't understand what properly means
in TV
isn't
unlike the first movie you do arguably miss out on some decent content with the movie - though I wouldn't argue it's essential - but the animation quality is still sky high in the movie while it
either the second movie or As
the words 'episode 70' alone are a sign god has abandoned you
and technically movie 2 is sequel to movie 1, it's just movie 1 and s1 are so interchangeable because everything cut in s1 was low-to-zero impact in terms of narrative consistency
you've got it
exactly
but StrikerS is insanely different and nanoha is arguably no longer the main character
yeah, the third season, StrikerS
but in the context of 30's final ending split, yeah
I feel that's a bad example because 99% of route splits in SRW are more like the gang splitting up in scooby doo
*probably* the As TV show - then if you feel like it, the As movie and finish off the movie quadrilogy
If it helps you can think of it as a timeline split
they are just two different canons
They are both canon
neither, they're both fiction
that's more or less true but what's critical here is Reflection and Detonation are a sequel to the As movie, not the As TV show, and you can't just drop them in between As and StrikerS as part of a single continuity
those would be a third canon and a fourth canon, tbh
maybe they're trying to really open up the veins of otaku with the high price merchandise that isn't very sustainable in the west
yes, I think it's probably a japanese project
you could argue the MCU is *another* reboot
Ultimate was a reboot that ran concurrently with the mainline comics
Marvel did it
It's possible
you'll definitely like episode... I think 4?
I think you'll like gun x sword lexi
in mai's case they flip that and she's the blankfaced friend who silently pulls all the best pranks
see Mai, from Nichijou
Super unflappable characters can be *incredible* in the right circumstance
it's probably male villains who chew scenery
but I think in the context of anime
In real life there are definitely personality profiles that feel like sandpaper to me
ü™ù
I guess it's not that crazy, just, hm
have you really never watched anything before like 2007
4:3 480p the only way to go
<@!173112001684439040> I know you don't like people telling you what to do so I'm not going to tell you to watch it, just that I genuinely think it might be up your alley
"it's good, for an *american* show" might be an expected reaction
not invented here
it also has the benefit of probably being a better hit with japan because it wouldn't have NIH syndrome
what a horrific baby of capitalism
I could see it
a japanese rwby with vtuber VAs
swapping from Comedy Goku to Intellectual Goku had promise
don't forget them shitting on gohan
also gotenks wasn't - yeah, wasn't that likeable
there's also the whole puru 12 thing
the entire point of unicorn, besides being a bit edgy, is that Zeon was Right and the EFF is Worse
it's beyond that
and why Unicorn is one of my more disliked works of recent times
this is the major reason why I don't engage with the gundam fandom despite being able to rattle off serial numbers of grunts
<:NononSmug:651876302412054548>
Nanoha is already a cop in the third movie despite being like 6 months later
The sequel movies take place within a year of As
The biggest thing about As TV is it has an epilogue and the movie doesnt
The biggest thing is the book of darkness is slightly less autonomous in the tv show and hayate was set up to be a victim by someone
Pigtails are for little girls
They're adults now
Yes they're different
You gave me no context for this
Oh wait you're in strikers?
Nanoha now uses black ties and fate white hairties
It just looks shittier
The hair I think is the same?
Nanoha "befriending" people is a meme referring to her beating them up
Huge fandom jokes over it
It's canon that nanoha typically resorts to force and violence to solve everything
As in design or character or what
Maybe do all the original endings and then move to automata
Also drakengard got a manga
Imo replicant remake is designed to be played after automata
I think the best is Aquarion
One of the better uses of that I've seen
I certainly enjoyed it but your mileage may vary

as a result they get somewhat batshit, just so you're aware
movies 3 and 4 use a lot of plot elements from a certain series of nanoha PSP games that had their stories written by a certain akifumi kaneko
Reflection is 3 and Detonation is 4
1234
pretty simple
for the movies?
Does MMO junkie really stick the landing? I dropped it after it moved to too much real world drama
Oreimo does cancel that out a bit <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
it ended over 5 years ago
flip flappers isn't something I would classify as recent anime
it's good
iski you should watch nichijou
so they were a perfect adaptation because they shuffled some stuff around
I was going to say Nichijou was pretty 1:1 but A) nano's arc and B) helvetica standard stand out
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
I don't necessarily disagree but when you're talking about trends in the industry, you're looking at the last 5 years first and foremost
It was pretty cool except for the part where you're sitting in the same room with strangers when there's little girl nipples on screen
I saw reflection and detonation in theaters when they came out respectively
det
||detonation almost snapped my neck with the back and forth twists||
Reflection is p cool
God help us, the industry belongs to the worst sort: *manga publishers*
The anime adds a bunch of extra realism research and extra plotlines that weave together very cleverly
Planetes is my favorite example of that
The best adaptations truly elevate the source material
Even though this is a dumb bad idea for obvious reasons
A lot of 1:1s even try to copy shot composition
Nyaruko and popura are her biggest I think
She's done a lot of popular (or popura hahaha so funny) roles but nothing recent that I expect you to have watched
corpse husband is apparently some musical artist or something idk
'bigger = more hype" felt like a crutch towards the end
It really felt like imaishi took diebuster as a challenge
TTGL is a good show but I feel the second part let out some of the magic in it's attempt to be record breaking
Which is why a s2 isn't on the table
I'd actually suggest the LWA singleshot ova was their best work
They had a few earlier works
<:headpat:656050350016692276>
Being allergic to water would explain the thirst
<:Spray:687873181993926744>
the tex fight was probably the best fusion of comedy and action though
like the car chase? great shit
it's really good but I honestly felt like most of the flashback fights in the next two seasons were at least as good
it's a pretty direct examination of how we deal with death, consequences, and social obligation
to me, though, I think if you need a cheery ending you haven't really understood the work
but yes, he didn't like it
I think a more apt reason why they missed that was the anime stopped airing 2 years before that chapter was written
yeah it's not as good
the main thing to care about from the anime is the OP, which is one of the absolute best of the 2000s
it just, y'know, wasn't written at the time
but the juicy part of the manga happens after
it follows the manga and then diverts for a modestly happy ending
eh
it's basically a series of more and more complex trolley problems, honestly
but the story and the character examinations are fascinating
it's incredibly depressing and is either really edgy or depressingly honest depending on your view of people
I heavily advise reading it
yes
because then Zearth comes to play
though I feel like this is where I mention that if you measure mecha power level by killcount the winner is probably none of the above
all of a prior alien human-like civilization though
not humanity
well
ideon and ultraman were, more than anything else, what was responsible for evangelion
and build a robot with it
no ideon is more accurately what happens if you take LCL from third impact and turn it into ingots
because they can, in theory, alter fate, past and future
afaik the *actual* upper limit of mecha power tripping is either cybuster or dis astranagant
and then the demonbane people go "yeah but demonbane is reality bending so its better"
sam really when people wank about TTGL as a power level argument they eliminate the human part of it and just go "yeah it's infinitely big and strong"
in terms of "lmao fuck u"
Ideon's always been the most interesting to me because it's the most narratively interesting
this is about the robot
sam this isn't about simon
but then, I'm on Team Ideon, if anything
if I have to hear ttgl vs demonbane one more fucking time
intellectual masturbation is probably how I'd call it
ever
not for me
I've watched a few death battles, they are just
Which is a weakness of basically the entire genre post nanoha and especially madoka, barring maybe precure
They're not trying to sell to men at all
Honestly if the older magical girl shows have anything in particular going for them
There are older magical girls but nothing more important
The foundation
Those two shows are what I'd consider the classics of the magical girl genre
Yu-Gi-Oh almost certainly was inspired a bit by the concept
A elementary school girl hunts down monsters and seals them in cards
There isn't a huge difference between 2000s and 90s except the former looks worse
Ultra old is like, 70s
No it's 90s
You could give sailor moon or card captor Sakura a shot
rip advertising
ooh tiger and bunny 2
Eternally unanswered plot thread
The random assassination out of nowhere still sticks out to me
AKB had it's moments but some of the end plots dropped it down a score point for me
Gaogaigar is the only 10/10 mecha anime in my book, but TTGL is also good
It's not anything you mentioned but it's the greatest anime of all time
You could watch inferno cop
So deciding not to is a conscious choice
*any* studio can nail moe now
If an anime is spending time and effort to not look 'cute' and 'sellable', they probably have something artistic in mind
The longer you watch anime the more you realize that unconventional art styles mean they're more likely to be special
Sure
Shirobako is about adults and career work, it's not nsfw or anything but you might relate better when you're older
Eizouken is very quality
Eh idk if Stella is old enough for shirobako tbh
~~shirobako~~
I'd love to see something as honest about the idol industry
Except the VA is a massive bitch and she's only finding success because the anime is basically a pump and dump piece to try to cash in on easy trend money
An anime about a VA trying to make it big
That would be *so spicy*
Still waiting for girlish number but for idols
That explains some of it?
If it helps the OP is a banger
The actual name is High School Fleet
Haifuri?
Yuri wants a cast of cute girls doing cute action things?
Hm
The girls are ok but literally every supporting character is cooler
Alto is the worst
Frontier had flaws (main characters) but I heard it was better than delta
Though on that note I need to finish billy bat
Is Asadora any good
Well I was expecting it to suck anyway
Did they release the Pluto anime without me noticing or is it still "in progress"
The 00s remake was pretty good actually
Dragon quest releases mainline games more often than nep
When they mean anime of the year all years they mean it for one piece
The awards wouldn't lie
Shounen/action seinen is the peak of art and is where 100% of industry talent is
I think we've learned something from this poll
But yeah the list is 95% jjk, kny, aot
Odd taxi got a decent amount huh
They can't
The *main* girl even
Has any other manga had the kind of "btw one of the girls has been a low key bitch for 10 years" reveal that amg did
Put more raspy girls in anime they're so good
Her dub voice might be good but her sub is the best voice in the show
00 s2 sucked because they wanted to redo zeta for some reason
Number one reason why I expect every Gundam to be bad is it's a slave to its own conventions
No
He makes a good meme but his motivations feel pretty iffy
Almost makes up for them throwing his character in the trash for s2
Organization does not mean intelligence, and els isn't exactly working on the same scale
Like a bear mauling you? Or a colony of fire ants?
Therefore not a mindless aggressor
Its implied ELS finally understands that we're sentient and capable of having a dialogue with
I'm also not sure it would work given that els seem to basically *be* grey goo
That's genocide
The opposite fucking message of the 00 movie
Anyway I feel like using moonlight butterfly to fight els is like
I haven't seen it but I don't like the story
I don't expect any Gundam to be good
No but I hope so
Not a fan of the setting
~~I miss those days~~
Rights holders generally don't allow their stuff to be modifird
it's neat and it's a damn shame the protagonist is a blank piece of paper
there are good gundams, I just don't expect new ones to be good
Peacock is NBC's service
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt
Not a fan of those eyes combined with the palette
Same thing with Gundam upgrades

I really want to like it but I just expect it to be like, some t-shirts
I think this is now 7 times I've seen this announcement of an announcement
this is probably one of the most "who?" obituaries I've seen on ann
there's no promise of crossover media
IGN is overselling what the announcement said
incredible
wow they managed to make strike witches even more pointless
netflix still isn't on btw
it took youtube several years
it's surprising because switch has *very* few media apps
huh
https://twitter.com/NinEverything/status/1494358393271640070
this interview came out before 6 did
it's also less popular in japan, so
guy who was in charge of art direction in part 5 (and I think 6) says he doesn't think 7 will ever get done because he refuses to use CG for the horses and it's too expensive to draw
Kai is basically a compilation movie of DBZ except DBZ is so big the compilation "movie" is still 80 episodes long
English version may be redubbed but I don't think the Japanese one is really rewritten
Like, 80% or more
It *is* the original
There's a lot of things that I think are better than dbz Kai but it's still authentically DBZ in a way that nothing other than the original run is
It's just a different show
They can argue it's better but it's not dbz
Rather than a parody
It's an *actual* abridged series
Kai was a recut
yeah, ardania hit my reasoning
for the record I think you can be more gay than making a show with lots of girls into each other
penguindrum
it's basically the most gay anime made
generally if you want to look for an actor's best work you slice out all the action films
https://twitter.com/222pancake/status/1495873198575042567
shirabe looking sharp
I mean, same director
I dropped it when the quality began tanking around episode 9-10
I need to finish revue
like there's gay philosophy
Utena's pretty high up there because it deals with more queer stuff than just girls who like girls
idk I feel like putting love live on this list makes me believe none of it
Especially when you have directors like Nagano and take 10 years to make their movie
imo they have a higher ceiling for excellence but that doesn't mean the execution is good
Passion project doesn't mean it's good lol
They can only afford to do passion projects once in a while
Most are adaptations because those are the ones that build a studio's bank
Generally no, if you're doing an adaptation you generally don't have creative control
On these sales are much more important to end up in the green but at the same time then getting made at all is somewhat of a miracle
And passion projects, which are the originals they take huge risks on, using the money the studio built up with other projects to do something they really want to do
Profit projects, which are normally adaptations that they're getting paid to make and there's a committee helping fund it - they are very likely to see a good return on these because most of the costs were paid up front
Anime studios generally operate in one of two modes
Outside of Netflix deals
Is streaming even profitable for anime
Or figures or concert tickets
The only anime that don't need to be successful to get a s2, though, are adaptations that exist to sell the source
Most anime expect the profit margin to not be in the bd sales
Replace the letters VHS with DVD then
Sorry I can't continue this conversation I've been informed I'm too old and have to be made into Soylent green
It's like trying to claim VHS is a genre of movie or has certain plot qualities
I mean yes
There are entire franchises that have lived purely as OVAs (and maybe compilation movies)
It's literally just a different way to release anime
OVAs dont have anything to do with continuing or not continuing plot
Being broadcast is now basically irrelevant to success
"ova" doesn't really mean anything anymore
The world has changed
Well, they were
They're great if you're super broke and you want to sell a single episode at a time to fund the next one
OVAs are just a way to distribute
kizuna has been aggressively commercialized for a while
It's the literal save icon
???
Both technologies are from the 70s
Commercial floppies are only 3 years older
Very melon
Don't forget
https://twitter.com/sngsn353/status/1497522189104410631
we all knew it was coming
that's got a lot to do with zz
if the rumor about them thinking about adapting moon gundam is true
but uh
the movies are the ones that imply zz doesn't happen
With such high production values
It's so bad
I think that's my most hated mecha maybe ever
Glad we're mostly past that
The early 10s sensationalism mecha fad
God
(high school antics fade away with time)
...forced to pretend to be a high schooler
And the mc is an actual special ops soldier
Some of the robots before the setting really gets rolling run on internal combustion engines for example
It definitely has elements of absurdity but it might appeal to you
You should look into full metal panic
Realistic warfare does not entertainment make
Man, if you want to go that grounded it pretty much doesn't exist
Oh
I used to be like that until I realized the stories those can tell are honestly pretty limited
I don't think that's off from standard
Either Gundam seed destiny or TTGL is the lynchpin of the 00s
Even though it's not my favorite I'd say it's the definitive mecha show of the 00s, the way evangelion was the definitive mecha show of the 90s
It's basically the show TTGL felt like it had to try to prove it was better than
Diebuster
I think it'll make it come full circle
It's only another 6 episodes
<@228659769404030976> highly suggest you watch the spiritual sequel
Assuming accuracy is a goal
I feel like that's basically every 50 episode anime
This is the anime he broke it on
Yes
Most famous for the main voice actor breaking the microphone with a hot blooded scream for one of the final episodes
Decent anime, first 20 episodes are maybe a bit too slow
Get the expansion to put lacus clyne in god gundam
G gen spirits is still my favorite but genesis was nice though I'm not a huge fan of the 2010s Unicorn masturbation fest
It's the cat girl hologram/||haro||, yes
Crossrays was such a mess
Hanayo low-key best character of AD
00v and p were good
Gotta have one or the other
I feel like you can't both complain about sidestories getting involved in events all the time and also sidestories inventing a new corner of the setting
Oh yeah everything else about delta sucks but "btw Mars is colonized" was fine
In UC mars is actually ~~neo-nazis~~ ex-zabi Zeon remnants
Mars people btw I'm fine with
If you wish
But part of the point of turn a is you can assume just about any Gundam series is after UC
I don't know if it's related to the pitch
Afaik seed doesn't claim to be part of the turn a metaverse but seed astray does
And it survived like 6 black historys
Amuro's learning computer from the Rx-78
The story heavily hints it's actually
But the thing is
Lowe's AI
I feel 8 is actually singlehandedly dumber than anything in X
Also idk
X is enjoyable
I love that you are so mad about astray x because it's ridiculous but the series gets soooo much worse
Not hard enough to stop them from having two more plotholes in destiny related to cockpits
Though another manga implies the strike had a blast shield on the cockpit
Lowe dragged kira out before the explosion
The astrays were kind of shit yes, and also in a different hangar zaft didn't know about
Lowe was the bandaid they slapped on the plothole that the original story had
I mean no
Which is the point of sidestories
Lowe isn't central to anything, he just keeps being *there*
I don't have a huge issue with astray
It actively degrades several characters in a way that implies they've always been shit
Cagalli
Yeah I hope witch of mercury is good
The introduction of raid squads seems to point to me that they're looking to copy srw's homework for real
Personally I wouldn't mind the series quietly dying
The ship mechanics *are* g gen to me
I don't think range is useful if you have a good front line
I prefer ship squads but the insane ability to attack a unit 20 tiles away makes up for the awful sustain
Especially if you exploit raid squads
Chance step really means range doesn't matter
The berserk attack was 5 tiles and you don't need more
That's why Nobel wins out for me
God was shorter?
Nobel was a better unit than god
Honestly
Though
attack on tokens
Post 2021 you should just assume that something that advertises "digital collectibles" that isn't already buried inside a game or something is NFTs
Because it's based on syllables
It only shares one letter with nanoha in japanese
Seeing huge eyes closed is cursed somehow
Is maybe the second most badass pilot of UC in terms of piloting at a disadvantage
He's the deuteragonist of crossbone
Seabook gets to retire and that's the important part
It's fine
What an insane final episode
Panty and stocking....
They still live a little under the shadow of the term 'gainax ending'
Having a sequel doesn't mean you didn't have an ending
Crossbone has had several very good endings
Because mecha doesn't do well in paper form outside of power armor stories or, like, weird shit like heavy object
Because theyre all anime originals
Stories aren't stories without an end <a:angerawoo:824436671037964328>
Fucking bane of modern anime

penelope
~~klk is a 26 episode comedy anime~~
it's not exactly *wrong* but it also isn't a perfect label
it's like labelling symphogear an idol show
I mean it is but it's a gag anime first
(you literally can't have a title more slice of life)
nichijou is only barely SoL
despite having the most SoL title literally possible
mio's voice <:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
nichijou is art
while that is a recurring character type it's hardly even the primary form of waifu that shows up, which is why people fixate when it shows up
I'm not sure I understand
I legitimately fucking wonder if they added the finale to the movie with the delay
millhi to this day
less pastel?
I'm glad people like it for what it is but I'd love something more... stressful?
I'm eternally mad new game isn't shirobako but with games
I still need to finish girlish number but god that is so much acid
yes
well, with less cynicism than they could have gone with
shirobako is "here's the actual industry"
it's a decent substitute for doing research into how the industry works
shirobako is also a good vantage into why anime sucks when it sucks
GGG is my fault but anyone with taste would get you to watch shirobako eventually
does the job of extra ova well
it doesn't affect the quality of the work, it just gives you more to consume
Like, it's more nichijou
Eh, I'd have trouble rating it
it's not great, it's not shit, it's *fine*
episode zero is fine but definitely don't watch it before the series
I have no idea how long it is I just count shows in cours
but overall I think it looks better
I do think the movie one would have benefitted from the ribbon though
really like the improvement to her without the jacket
I'm actually pretty sure they added more blue into the movie design partially due to the gundam jokes
it's her regular school uniform with like, a bow
I don't like the anime one because it's not an outfit
was cooler to me than the magical devices, though maybe it's because I'd had a literal decade to get used to them
I actually really like the formula suits overall
yes
the important thing is they gave nanoha tron lines
the characters are nice and all but they're rarely saying anything I haven't seen in anime before
I liked the movies a lot because I think nanoha does best when it's action foremost tbh
they came from the game kaneko did
Because gup tv is a gelatinous mess without bones
Like it's worlds better than gup
I do think the fact it actually has a structured plot and mystery is what saves haifuri from being as mediocre as other similar titles for me
Nothing it does is exceptional but it hits just right
Haifuri is one of my top guilty pleasure anime
they made a canonical zaku variant to represent how ridiculously off model it was
https://twitter.com/arakichi1969/status/1501330840197820418
the one that's getting turned into a movie?
the one episode of mobile suit gundam that was *so* fucking badly animated it got more or less declared non-canon and was cut from most rereleases?
so
I mean that's true and you are free to discuss the show but play by plays aren't a discussion, exactly
Liveposting should be done in <#407060923078017026> for the most part
especially since there are others that speak to self-interest rather than altruism
but none of this really dethrones the idea that the environmental angle is the wrong one
you're not wrong
the 'its bad for the environment' has always been the worst anti-nft argument because it's by far the most solvable
they're just inherently stupid and anti-consumer
nfts aren't inherently anti-environmental - well, not more than your average consumer endeavour
"for some reason dropping summon skull turn 1 wasn't ok"
"they invented this new card mechanic, called tributing"
Still absolutely hilarious to read battle city
So he needed to stall a few months
I think it actually can be called filler because they were working on the real rules of the card game for battle city instead of just making shit up nonstop like in duelist kingdom
But dungeon dice monsters was so stupid it was pretty fun
Even the manga had "filler" between duelist kingdom and battle city
It was 00s filler
None of them are good
There's several yugioh arcs that can be called virtual world tbh
Fair counterpoint
Long running shows can have high highs but always have lows
Was just a dilemma that occurred to me
Also no disrespect on picking it
But that is fair
I feel like if you're saying episodes are bad enough to skip it's status as a goat is questionable
Virtual world part of being god tier
Or is like
If you rate a show god tier are you allowed to say "skip these eps"
why are they getting zero likes
BWOM
The footsteps are the best footstep noise in anime
because there's not many shows out there that better show the difficulty of transitioning to digital animation
It's an easy piece to love as like, a teenager, but as an adult I actually find the slight quality drop in animation in s2 to be a very interesting facet of it
I own so few anime in physical form, but I bothered to track down a steelbook for big o
It gets really weird but really I can't love it enough
(though I'd already played with Big O in D)
I was *super* jazzed to have both it and E7 in the same SRW back when Z came out lol
It's one of the few mecha shows I actually watched before I played a SRW with it in it
It's Steve Blum at some of his best and it's a little awkward to hear Japanese speakers stumble over "Dorothy Wainwright" so it's a good candidate for one of those shows that might be better dubbed
Dubbed or subbed?
Also Dorothy is one of the coolest rei clones in anime
Easy to love, hard to recommend is how I feel about it
One of my favorites even if it got very.... Esoteric
Yes
https://youtu.be/x-u-ISaOfS4
Potty jokes and all sometimes
Old ones are basically like, og Dragonball level humor shows
The new ones are based on the SD Gundam musou model line and are about sengoku era history and aesthetics
The old ones were gag cartoons based on other shows
Yeah but those are fundamentally different
They used to, with the SD Gundam OVAs back in the 80s and 90s
I could see sunrise do it
üçÖ
This is more like if amuro spent 15 episodes in a core fighter
Like I know what you mean but the protagonist ends up in the protagonist mecha in EP 1
I disagree it happens in Gundam
Out of like 50 so it's not a mid season upgrade or anything
There's a mecha show where the title robot doesn't get formed until like the 14th episode
lmao
which astro boy- I'll just find the twitter thread
I am 110% ready for it to be one of those big mega projects that pops up every few years and then just is very average when it releases
That is a fascinating animation error
Oh it's a bts series
Is it the same idea as the old evolve shorts
What is chronicle
same basic pipeline as prozd
she's done increasingly relevant voicework for things
I did kind of have the same association of "I guess she's technically a vtuber but it's weird to label it as her profession" lol
lol
You skipped CCA?
Whether or not it's the point doesn't make it pleasant for me
I really detest the general aesthetic of "a teenager designed this"
I just can't get into build designs
It felt less oppressively corporate
I like fighters, it's neat, but I did like danball Senki quite a bit more
That's pretty standard for proxy battler sequels
Like, compare and contrast with danball senk
Fighters was nice but the story really wasn't a lot more than "tournament to show off models"
~~unless it's got build in the name~~
*forgot* a colony
That people just
Because it is the dumbest plot point in UC
It's one of the primary reasons ZZ gets kicked under the rug
Yeah and I think the fact that bandai is thinking about acknowledging moon moon exists is absolutely hilarious
Especially with how edgy and zeonist the source material is
I've just been frustrated at it a long time
Modern late UC is *way* style over substance
My point is really
That's not a good counter
The arm replacement device isn't symmetrical
Do something else slightly less ridiculous
Like just give the silver bullet an arm twice as beefy as the other arm
Especially since the whole amazing thing about the magnum is it's self contained
Though I'd argue "it's actually a Super Special Protagonist Rifle only one robot can use" is pretty cringey?
Like you are buying way too hard into this "engineering makes no sense" paradigm Gundam has going
Yeah, so?
*more* expensive
I'd think building a rapid arm replacement device would be
Uh
It does not make any sense that it is easier to build an arm replacer than it is to just make an arm strong enough to fire *a beam rifle*
Yes
Very much a none of this tech makes any sense thing
Silver bullet suppressor highlights a lot wrong with unicorn era design for example
Honestly modern Gundam is filled with some really fucking stupid shit
Sat cannon is really cool and it's really unfortunate modern Gundam has the need for ridiculous ms mounted superweapons
It's kinda an "o...Kay?" Finish to the big mystery of the show
They also don't really explain dome anywhere near enough
Happens and then everyone is too dead to fight
It's understandable but it just kind of
X's ending doesn't really resolve important things in the series
Wing was bad but it was also exactly what late 90s kids thought represented cool
X is pretty rough and it has a pretty bad ending even by Gundam standards
Then msg
They followed it up with G
No
And turn a was a failure
Gundam was *fucked* before seed and it was destiny that truly saved it
Or, well, shut down departments
Because bandai saw the opportunity to not go bankrupt
It's all angles but it's doing something productive with them
The first seed has a decent design philosophy
Just because the character is set to be over 20 doesn't make it not a chuuni design
You don't think "I gave my Gundam two different eye colors" doesn't have that vibe?
I mean it'll be just as easily skipped
Difficult to like him after cca
Its
Skipping CCA might actually help with Hathaway
Over time there's kind of a black washing of the federation in order to make Zeon more noble - maybe not the zabis, but to make it more reasonable for Japanese fans to be rooting for the space Nazi faction, because they were already doing that
Classic msg federation failed because of classist apathy, not because they were actively plotting to make the colonies suck it
Not plodding apathy or nationalistic disdain
Cartoon evil
Like, again
I could believe they were a rational political entity who did bad things rather than "we are going to lie about things that everyone knew about and it'll be a secret"
I'm probably overreacting tonight but it's been a rough week
I think it was unicorn completing the pivot into "it was never gray, the federation was always cartoonishly evil" that made me realize I disliked the beast Gundam had become back in 2008 or so
Yeah I hope
If you can only iterate rather than invent, celebrate the process of iteration
And for that I suppose the build series is a good fit
I guess all that can be done now is to appreciate what it is instead of what it should he
It ruined 00s2 for example
It is more important to be Gundam than it is to tell a story
I mean really it's representative of all post turn a Gundam
"I really don't care what you do, but you have to create 30 gundams"
We're back to the G Gundam days
It's so clearly a bandai-pushed franchise
I have trouble seeing stuff like the build series and seeing sunrise ambition
And somehow in 50 years they turn into savages
pretty sure 'super fanservicey' was a selling point
and it's really a huge shame that despite this absolutely amazingly fucking stupid premise, the show still ended up boring trash
apparently the earth resource project involves making students use little rc toys to wage proxy wars representing real countries on a 10km large scale map
but they kept calling it ERP
no it was something really stupid like Earth Resource Project
reminds me of the time I watched danball senki wars (don't do this, stop at the second season) and they kept talking about ERP
h m m
are they just a digital service?
if they actually print
I'll probably buy gushing over magical girls
that's gone
there used to actually be a market for tactical games with gundam marketting
probabilities weren't friendly in spirits unless you were way overlevelled
also having a free hit was very powerful in that game
at the end of the video they show it off
it basically dissolves in beam fire
yeah
oh my god I forgot the ABC cloak was the coolest thing ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIMH-VnVCL4 even like 17 years ago when they were still using pure sprites they were already trying to *look* like 3dcg
G Gen has always had a different aesthetic and it hasn't really changed
I'd be disappointed but it might honestly be better than alternatives
that just isn't OG
They've really leaned into this 12fps framerate hand drawn thing
any animation at all that would do OG justice in the last 5 years of SRW
we haven't seen really
I'm interested but also worried
Terada did say OG was probably next before 30 released
30th is definitely good news but they need to prove it's not a fluke
no I think what's left of banpresto studios is held together by chewing gum and tape and they barely have enough ambition to finish OG
definitely one of the best dynamic kills of all time
timestamped attack might be the best DS animated attack ever
https://youtu.be/ta5qDOo0eOo?t=165
though I felt they did it justice in Z1
Z series is the only time they've ever used aquarion
attack uploaders stop using emulator filters challenge [impossible]
the last DS srw
L's probably the best animation for it though
it's one of the only ever cross-series combo attacks SRW's ever had
I think Z2-2 brought in OG dancouga too
no it was both Z2 and Z3
it's also in a few of the DS games
or maybe just Z3
Z2 and Z3
yes
man I miss wakamoto being in things
the villain is wakamoto
It's an okay 12-13 episode ride
Dancouga Nova
*animated in wireframe*
Dancouga was such a hot mess that the transformation sequences of the first...4? episodes?
oh my god that poor man

I don't think he was involved in the nadesico movie
also did charcter design on nadesico which is interesting
break blade could have been directed a little cleaner but fafner was good
checked habara's record and yeah, solid stuff
Irm was one of the protagonist options for SRW 4/F but they bring him back for a rival role
Huckebein EX vs Grungust Kai
Irm's unit will also depend on your route
but your mech choice does
your protagonist choice doesn't affect what missions you get other than dialogue
Super gets Grungust Nishiki/Type 2 and upgrades to RyuKoOh/KoRyuOh
Real gets the huckies
was getting confused with 4/F
Okay no I was right
One moment
no
wait
real starts in huck mk II and gets mk III
no you pick between real and super
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I like z1 more than alpha 3, slightly, but alpha 3 is more of an epic
Translation wishlist in order is:
1) OG Gaiden
2) Alpha 3
3)Z1
4) Alpha 1
yeah
I don't think she was playable
I only know the weiss wasn't in 1
I've never actually played it, I'll admit
and was a supporting character
but did not have a unit
She might have been in part 1
it still slaps
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmdhnJbXzfc
ok but
and the order would affect what units you had when
but you had to do every option, you just chose the order
there'd be route splits
Compact 2 was actually arguably a prototype for SRW 30
shorter than average but it still results in Impact being the longest SRW until 30
they later released it all as one upscaled PS2 game, similar to what they'd do later with OG, called Impact
Compact 2 was a three part game
kind of
(the sequel to Compact 2 is 2-2, not Compact 3, that's Ialdaboth)
and then they both appeared in part 3
Excellen was in the sequel
Kyosuke's game was Compact 2
they've never really done anything similar since
but it's not who you select at the start of the game
SRX team is basically secondary protagonists of Alpha 1
I think he was the protagonist of Shin but it's kind of confusing
which makes sense
basically all of the alpha MCs except bullet and kusuha got sidelined after OG1 and 2
carla and yuuki being the most "wait, they have telekinesis?" of the bunch
they're all the alpha protags
that's why OG1 and OG2 have so many random psychodrivers
stuff like kusuha/bullet wasn't truly canon until alpha 2
you choose your protagonist and then you choose someone from the other gender as your love interest
yes
OG1 then had him in his mentor form and 6 months later he was a main protagonist in Alpha 2
alpha gaiden
well, 'final' boss
final boss
Funny because he's introduced as a pure antagonist
kusuha, arado, zengar
really butt for the first half
so she's just
and so her stats *literally double* halfway through the game when she gets past it
Story-wise she's trapped in PTSD for being responsible for a training accident
she still gets hit on stage 2 when you fully upgrade her unit
if you do alpha 2 don't do ibis on first run
SRW's gone the same way
now it is just fanservice
no it's fine it's just
the fact that the series goes past the ending doesn't change that
madoka has a positive ending
fair, but I don't consider gore suffering
not all stories do
madoka has a positive ending
elfen lied is definitely more suffering than madoka
normally she looks about 17-19
this is part of a flashback
part of being not human
she also had a genetic compulsion to murder
oh it's coming back to me now
Lucy herself kind of does a lot of killing so not much chance to be kind there
Most of elfen lied revolves around the fact that Lucy's basically been damaged so badly she has a new amnesiac persona and that gives someone a chance to be kind to her
in the 2000s she got brought up a lot in power level discussions
just, momentum and force applied to areas of space omnipotently
without touching
she has the ability to say "no, it's moving in this direction now"
so you know how when you move your hand, that section of 'space' is basically moving in that direction
she gets 'force vectors'
they keep it scientific
they never phrase it as 'demon powers'
they're horns
those aren't hair ornaments
she's not human and never was, iirc
she's pretty high up there on power level scales tbh
I never watched the anime but the manga was certainly... a thing
the story is about humanity abusing an innocent until they become an apocalyptic monster, so
it isn't the worst gundam series but it might be bottom 5
that's a pretty neat thing
I do admire them for having negative character growth on main characters
like I think the concept is alright and I think AGE was the appropriate level of toy-ness - most of the build series pushes it too far for me
it is but it has some okay ideas to admire them for trying badly
it could basically be sprites of prerendered 3d video but at that point the difference is basically non-existent except performance
I could be wrong I guess
I'm... *pretty* sure they're using 3d now?
a new story, telling different themes
madoka is a case of an actual sequel
they're *continuations*
Not a lot of works are genuine *sequels* these days
obari isn't limited to one pose but he does have some design trademarks
I'll grant you he tends towards certain facets but
okawara *definitely* has range
*he designed the fucking suits*
"Victory Ver Ka" "Crossbone Ver Ka"
Also I just want to say some of the branding drives me insane
they all have the same stance and same limbs
people make a big deal out of it but really the thing that makes a katoki design katoki is the limb proportions and the leg angle
because katoki can only do specific proportions
just every UC and CE design jammed into the same body proportions
If you ever look up the old GFF line they look absolutely soulless
katoki's problem is that he got burned out in the mid 2000s churning out identical designs
there are no popular mecha without them
gimmicks are fine
I'm sure it's on his twitter somewhere, I saw him post it in 2019 or something
he's drawn it more recently

yes
Gravion is also fucking great looking after it was fixed up for animation
He's so good at super robots
I also wanted to defend my boy okawara one more time - he's not my favorite, but how can you argue with the results man
it's a shame since stuff like the schpeltor is some of the all time greatest 'magic robot' design
and yes, the newest ones really do look like skeletons
In rough terms, the further down on this image you go the older the design

all of nagano's designs are like this since about 05
if you think ippei is high heels you haven't looked at enough nagano works
It's not just additional accents, it also got an obari face lol
the original looks clean
what sucks is this is an 'upgrade'

he has a tendency to overdesign when left alone to his own devices
most of obari's iconic mechs were designed by someone else
kawamori on top, obari's animation guide below
He'd never design the macross 7 grunts these days
I forgot how different his style was in the 90s
huh I didn't know kawamori did the first design pass on dangaioh
and it's possible ugly aquatic designs were intentional
yeah I think I'll agree with that
Basically everything that's a gundam from the first SEED has good design
he learned how to do modern design for that
I think okawara's cosmic era designs are largely good and some of his best tbh
the fact his art sucks doesn't really impact that
I personally think okawara is one of the better mecha designers
it's almost all adaptation...?
if you take out pretty cure and symphogear
I'm thinking through the last decade
you say that but
a lot of them like MGRP or Site or most Yuyuyu content after the first season aren't original either
and, honestly
a lot of them sold merchandise but mostly it was echoing madoka
things that are designed to sell toys (mecha included) are more likely to be original though
I'm fairly certain that the amount of originals made every year has stayed steady or dropped over the last 3 decades
so you know how the anime industry has been booming and growing the last decade, with more shows than ever being made
yeah being original doesn't make you immune
of the two the former is definitely more pressing
Almost certain to not have a good ending and more likely to have pacing issues
if it was original I'd definitely check it out
shame
and it's a very major dividing line between SRW and G Gen
are still 3d graphics
that's fair, but I'd still argue prerendered 3d graphics
and I think it's terrible
it pains me to see how proud of the shuroga sin he is
might have been another but at this point my mind might be muddled
I think that's it yeah
oh hey it's the villain from ssss gridman
but I think that was obvious from the OG series he ~~ruined~~ directed
he *really* likes the alteisen lmao
but his stuff is kinda fun to look through anyway
I recall a bust shot
he did some art for that though
was part of the KOF new game release
I mean yeah, but it's recent
Some of the effects like missiles or beams might be client-side to better interact with stuff like the warships
<:MariaSip:731709620065927240>
it does not really have an excuse for not having an ending
akb0048 is an original
I don't think that's a good thing
for the kits it boils down largely to the fact that only bandai is big enough to operate lines at scale
which they also have been gouging on lately with pbandai
yeah I kinda figured you were talking about one specific product
idk those rider belts are pretty much a ripoff
amazing how publishers, the people who decide whether something gets made or not, might actually have influence
adaptation
so
it's a sequel to a game
but
Normally I'd say it's an original, because multiproject works like that are fair
it's really pretty cure single handedly carrying the original half of magical girls this decade and that's just because that way they can sell new toys every year
adaptation
which, again
we also had sailor moon crystal
oh right
most madoka inspired works that became anime started as LNs or manga
same with yuyuyu
Half of all madoka content produced at this point is adaptation
zero two was one of them
there's one every few years that's this obnoxious
no reason he can't focus on both
90% of his work happens 6-8 months before the show airs
he's a character designer
that is what I meant by "also brs" yes
not only this but also BRS
also wow huke's getting a lot of work lately
what the hell job is 'animation concept'
They were trying to be Just Like My Japanese Animes
The jokes weren't unsalvageable they just were oversold and had terrible timing
Nothing important happens during it afair
Just with comedy delivery that doesn't suck complete ass
It'd be hilarious if it was just a remake of s1 and we got something incredibly generic because that's what s1 was designed to be
Pretty sure everyone who made it through those was doing it on sheer faith in the trailers
The RWBY animation would not pass a 3 episode test lol
animators don't have a fucking clue how animals work
but it's an animator's nightmare
SBR is very good
it either won't be david or it'll be people who don't like the product they're making
if it happens you'll end up hating it
jojo, aya
5's animation did a lot for its standing
5, now
3
it polls a lot lower in japan
7 is a fan favorite in the west
no
the animation director of 4-6 said the only way 7 would be doable is with CG horses and he refuses to compromise the visuals like that
but it's really the horses thing that kills it
and 7 isn't as popular
horses are too expensive
not with the staff of 4-6, anyway
7 isn't happening
it is related to netflix having bad subbers
The fact that netflix has bad subs is not related to the way it is produced
ideally, anyway
better subs
production wise it means everything is jammed up together
the netflix paradigm also results in worse episodes
japan isn't getting jojo any faster
what do you mean kotoko
this is such a bad fucking way to produce anime
isn't this basically a full year after the first half
did it have a resolution
I'm interested to read it but the anime PVs were a little too reaction face for me
We should ban all trains and cars and put all that money into vacuum people tubes
You weren't worthy anyway
"sorry it's over"
They should just cancel anime
I don't think they care
It seems smart
I am actually confused that they're not leaving the first two-three eps free continually
Funiwhat
Love people trying to dunk on a subscription service saying you need a subscription
This animation looks like it came from like 2007 era Naruto but with more bad cg cars
Same
CD's plot was both basic and random
but they'll use amy and metal sonic
they probably won't, CD's plot sucks
but if heat management is part of the gimmick - and the transparent parts make me think it might be - the excessive vents make sense
it's got some of ibo's bad habits
not sold on aerial yet
it feels like a 10 year old's writing idea
"gonna replace him with the identical twin"
the writing in general
also just
lyle really struggled to be likeable
that almost certainly would have been better
I don't hate it, but the problem with all of setsuna's suits that aren't exia is they're not exia
I forget the 00 movie exists
at least the final episode was decently fun
a lot of going through the motions of older gundam series
but it felt like pretty mediocre mecha action
I suppose that's mostly true
I disagree it was fun to watch
I thought the innovedas had boring suit designs, no motivation, and was the first half of the season was them just running while Al shouted Marie
chen also had blue hair
it just sucks to be female when you're written into gundam
I think it's not haircolor
lunamaria was also as fine as anyone in destiny was
yeah none of them turn out well
you could have just written "women"

they had to change the design language of 00 for the second season because the details were too expensive
wonder if it's going to be mostly cg
the number of panel lines is a good point
"Revive Revival" might be the most gundam name
https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Bring_Stabity
his name is actually Bring Stabbity
I think they *wanted* to do Bring Stability
oh no
https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/CB-001_1_Gundam
I'm not sure that's based on the reborns

you would be a fool
you'd think the head is the head
kyrios' gen 2 prototype
the best 00 gundam
aside from the 0 raiser plane
GN Archer best 00s2 design
I liked the GN Archer and thought that qualified
slight upgrades are almost exactly what you'd expect from what's basically a jet fighter
I think I like arios more than harute
quanta is also not great the more I look at it
Probably raphael
I'm pretty sure the original intention was c'est la vie gundam
seravee is still such a hilarious name to write like that
also I like soma peries, she was basically better than any protagonist in s2 who wasn't named tieria
*the only* plot for like 4 episodes
I'm mostly fine with that I think because he was like
Unless you want pseudoscience it's not worth asking aya
The solar furnaces are strategically a *massive* improvement over gn tau drives but their tactical benefits are a lot more limited
It's not only damaged it's a whole generation behind the gn-xiiis that bodied it, which weren't even cutting edge
Do shit normally but have other universes randomly pop in
I think world's system was the best compromise
srw is their competition and does it better
It's in their interest not to
I thought that was neat but I kind of agree there was basically zero thought put into crossrays other than "what non-uc series sell well?"
There isn't a huge difference other than someone had the amazing idea to make the world's most expensive removable magazines
All 00 units are cracked early game in g gen
she had clark kent's glasses in her pocket
Absolute most shameless kitbash molds in production
All of the librarian units suuuuck
<:mystery:708009673458188422>
The only person who had a perfect run in destiny was Alex Dino, because he mysteriously disappeared before the show got weird
Better to die a hero than become the villain
I think he would have gotten worse
Touya I'm not going to lie your need to show off how much you know is sometimes grating
Right
They do make a single one more before the movie
Most everyone at Jupiter who made the original td blankets died iirc
It's a magic macguffin you can only make at Jupiter
When victory had cool fights they were insane
Beam shields were the best melee weapon
Oh sorry wrong thread
They dismember gundams every season
No
Hey remember when kira got hit point blank with Genesis and was fine : )
Kinda like a Gundam is going to be fine but if it's the last episode parts are going to fly off
I think the answer is it's more dramatic so it works better
By destiny people used coated shields
It is fucking sick though
I don't remember
Kira took aegis pretty far damn apart
He wasn't winning even if he didn't make the Scylla play
But came up with a good stalemate
He definitely lost the duel
I mean it sucks but there's plenty of accepted canon stuff that sucks more
G savior is probably the most underrated Gundam thing
https://youtu.be/xiVHnUjRJyg
With them having a badass fight with stubby little limbs
Yeah
G gen seed was pretty good tbh
I love the g gen seed animation of the strike aegis fight
When you only show up like twice anything you do is a signature
Does the little spin
Love it's attack in z
Savior is a sweet design
The fact sunrise is almost never allowed to use the song really does a lot to stop it from being iconic
Tobe Gundam is famous because it's Gundam, zeta's op might have been iconic if it had been original
Yeah
Not on the level of Aquarion or Eva
It's a good op but in general I don't think Gundam has any truly legendary ops
They were dumb in 08 and they're dumb now üòî
I'll never take "my feelings over your airspace" seriously
I'm still mixed on daybreak's bell
The version of the song used in the final episode is even better
https://youtu.be/K8aQ_1gwURg
Yoko kanno at her best
There are very few mecha scenes as iconic as that first Mugen punch
When it's good it's *the best*
I will defend Aquarion s1 as an unpolished gem
Like it's up there with Aquarion and seed for best 00s mecha op
Also goat opening
Really cool adventure until you're slammed into a bad non ending
King gainer is pretty comparable to modern Isekais
And I'm not even touching garzey's wing
G reco was one of the worst directed gundams period, brain powerd really flounders, and King gainer is strong until it suddenly has a stroke 4 episodes from the end
Winning the battle did not help his directing
Because fuala goes from being really nice to homicidally insane as a result of taking the fall for league militaire
Fuala was the better tragic character
I think victory is decent but it actually performs better when you treat it as a late 80s real robot show rather than something specifically gundam
possibly diebuster idk
I generally sell gunbuster on the basis of it handling time dilation
you're kidding, right blockio
idk sometimes character quality is better
Dang
You have to see the frames forward and back in your head
The problem is animation work requires a different skillset
For illustrators, at least
That's not an uncommon path now
And you don't get that dollar if they need you to redo it
Imagine drawing a whole ass picture that gets used in an animation and making 1 dollar for it
Yeah
A girl well over 2 years into her skilled labor career
Is Ema calls her parents telling them "I think I can live without help now" only after she gets promoted to do AD work
I think the only other thing shirobako does to nod to how bad things are
But since aoi makes her stop I don't know if it's really commentary
Arguably it does make some small comment that she's working even under a fever
It makes no attempt to say it was overwork that did it, and, in fact, I'd say segawa is generally shown as one of the most competent and reliable ADs on the show
It has an animator who gets sick yes
Even if they manage a comeback someone still had to destroy their career to keep the studio going
But yes it does at least knock the idea of a golden ending down with the movie
And of course the audition episode is also highly critical of the financial support behind the industry
The closest shirobako ever comes to calling that kind of industry problem out is the fact that Ema is usually shown eating cheap meals
rather than something with the same energy as a k-on tea party
I agree shirobako doesn't address it either but it's easier to swallow in a drama where everything is always a battle
"haha look how funny it is that the girl sleeps in the office"
It's what firefly wishes it was
Outlaw star has some of my favorite ever sci-fi anime aesthetic
The seasonal plot is a little hard to follow but you won't care super much
It's so fun
Diebuster just felt correct at its scale because there was a very important emotional reason it had to be at that scale
Like you were already at the "holy wow" stage
They were going way beyond what they needed to in order to make the maximum impression
(mind you the scale isn't my biggest complaint with the second half but I think it is representation that gainax was being reckless in it's need to top itself)
I just couldn't turn my brain off
I knew what redshifting was when I was like 8
It just loses most of the intuitive impact at that scale for me
I'll check them out someday
I saw there was a bigger form and was like "this is the opposite of what I want"
I honestly never watched the movies
But still good
Until the second half where the track gets a little wobbly
It definitely rides it's own hype train well
So the toys have much better implementation out of a fighting arena
Danball is just a better base setup for it because instead of magic particle fields they use tiny motors etc
Little kids fight the Illuminati with gunpla
Go watch danball Senki s1
Yeah you can
But at the end of the day, it's just basically a tournament arc and not much more
It is very good though
It relies a lot on Gundam fan service
I feel what it does has been done better
Joking - mostly
~~the only truly perfect mecha show is gaogaigar tv~~
It's in the upper echelon of mecha but thinking it can't be topped is a trap
Yeah that's a fair statement
<:Elf9Delete:679828318782095389>
Haruhi is probably one of the worst anime waifus - as in a bad person- that hasn't straight up murdered someone
It's not a good portrayal unless they're abusive and financially demanding of all their followers
<:HibikiSick:777009882346946570>
There's also the ball scene but in a just world balls would be able to take a little bit of punishment
Perfectly fine
But the big one is the ez8 literally melting from the apsalas beam and he's just
He dodges an MS bullet point blank for one, even though the air concussion would have ripped his organs apart even if the bullet missed
Like Shirou being the second most plot armored character in all of Gundam history
08th is grounded but has points of sudden absurdity
But igloo is probably the biggest point (other than 0083) where they started really pivoting to the Zeon fanbase
The most grounded of the series is probably igloo 1
Space Romeo and juliet
It's biggest problem is probably that it's just
I have a few quibbles with it but it is a nice interpretation of the grunginess people pretend Gundam is
08th is nice
Go touch grocer
Boku no my hero
Especially zessica who was like, one of the most charismatic female mecha characters ever
Mixy and zessica are way worse
She's like the least bad bad thing that happens
Mikono isn't really that bad until the show starts being awful in general
I'm not trying to start fights but I think they could have done a lot better than Sheryl, and I'd almost prefer leads with negative character traits than those with almost none
Frontier just needed a different main cast to be a top tier mecha show
Yugioh basically does everything worse than it's main competitors
It can't be understated how massive it was
It was the thing that dethroned touhou in pixiv
Honestly it was the og big gacha girls game
Cosplay of the soul is still one of the funniest anime episodes I've seen
And some episodes are 10/10
It's not wow but some shit is really cool and some sequences are iconic
Aquarion is solid
She spends most of the show being deadpan
25 was made for a rebroadcast that happened before the release of the film
Because I watched it when it aired in 2013
I think so but it's worth noting I've never seen episode 25 or the movie
The studio went on to do houseki no Kuni
Yes
MJP just built different
Jin's death where he makes a giant dimension sealing cannon is one of the best Mecha moments ever
Yes
Especially with the crossover episode
The yunoha storyline is too precious to not keep
Idk
And then it just kawamoris itself to death
Aquarion Evol is so weird because when it's firing on all cylinders it's legit one of the best super robot anime of all time
He definitely gets quite a bit
In a getter robo you have to have three mains
Sirius
Not because they were awful but because everyone else was fucking amazing
The worst characters in the show
But for sousei all three main characters were like
They regress her suddenly at one point so that they can keep the weird love triangle around for a bit longer
Silvia is okay but is definitely a bit flawed
Mikono is like, Silvia bad
catherine was baaaaad
atlus has been pretty anti-lgbt lately idk
social links is dating as far as "dating game" goes
I'm also tempted to call out the atelier games as an otome game not quite about romance
the whole concept of persona actually is "what if we took a dating sim and gave you reason to multitask different people" tbh
basically, the part of persona games nobody likes is what is the core of a lot of classic dating and otome games
which is like, as classic a dating sim as you can get, where the gameplay is all about time management
stuff like tokimeki memorial girls side has been around for aaaaaaages
but also!

it's generally about getting a guy to open up while their archetype is fierce/sweet/dangerous/whatever
erotic tension over sex or nudity
I know some stuff about otome but I'm not watching that anime so examples would be helpful
what kind of what
(it's not quite eurobeat but parapara is very adjacent)
for when you need more eurobeat in your super robot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyi-f9LTQb8
sure, but again, sailor moon is just a straight up better version of "hunt the crystal shards"
it's possible to watch and enjoy early s1 - I don't, particularly - but there's just about 10 anime that do the same thing better
oh yeah if Fate and the bureau hadn't shown up you would have never heard of Nanoha
I'm really uncertain if they were aiming for yuri with s1 or just wanted to commit to the card captor sakura style of cute besties forever
but just like nanoha it was intended to be a cutesy spinoff - until the anime studio decided to make it a fanservice spinoff
Prilya is definitely a more dramatically different universe than its base when compared to nanoha, but that kinda makes sense because TH isn't very supernatural at its base where Fate is nothing but magic fights
it's one of those "that's a weird twist but okay" moments that kinda keeps TH from ever being worth mentioning outside of the fact it's related to nanoha
alicia is a ghost in triangle heart
yeah
Prisma Ilya's a spinoff in a *similar* (though much more questionable) way
It's not the best example but it's relevant
I've been trying to come up with a good example
if you want to see the roots there's no harm, it's just everything I've read up on suggests TH wasn't a particularly good visual novel in the first place
She's in it but I'd argue it's not even truly the same character
It's not nanoha content at all really
skip triangle heart
but a lot of that rests on the shoulders of the lack of effort of the background artists
strikers worldbuilding was kinda neat but I do felt it ended up really generic
I'd definitely say that As is the best executed out of all of them though the climax is *really* held back by Nanoha's (lack of) creature design
but it delivers
A's is alright? I feel you can shake the script and get the same thing but more polished and emotional if you tried
I mean personally I feel that nanoha's never been stellarly written, it's mostly been carried by interesting ideas rather than sterling execution
because this kind of echoes for a lot of characters, including the knights
which I felt he deserved better but maybe it's just that nanoha writers struggle with keeping anyone relevant who isn't the New Characters
I think the fact nanofate sells is actually a big part of why they sidelined yuuno so hard
Considering they're like 8 I'm not really fussed at it one way or the other in the first two seasons, honestly
and yeah s1 feels like the intended puppy love idea is yuuno and nanoha
probably a descendant of stuff like class s yuri
"girls can be special close best friends" was something pretty unironically believed in at the time
it was really a different time
as someone who was consuming anime back then I'm really pressing X to doubt on s1, personally
yeah - her being a dark magical girl wasn't too wild, but her relationship to her mother and getting chased by *time cops* really gave the series a unique standing
Then it's top tier I guess
Unless you like spats
I was hopeful when vividred aired the first EP but it is very mid
Still waiting for the perfect technologic magical girl show, gear came closest for me
Detonation is not a perfect movie but it is a fun ride
Overall I think I like movies 3 and 4 the most because they're great popcorn spectacles and while I like nanoha I've never gotten truly emotionally invested in the characters
Reflection also had that really good fate Lindy payoff
Not the best Mecha cg but yeah it was good
I might prefer reflection if only for the giant robot fights
Densha otoko and maoyuu are probably the OG web post success stories
I remember the plotline I ended up really liking that I wasn't expecting to was Mylene leading the mass produced sound force
The show is nichijou and it's one of the best abstract humor gag shows ever
Words that should not be used as verbs
everything else was Nifty
the main pieces of macross 7 extra content I didn't really bite into were Dynamite and that one Plus episode that was just part of a live concert
it has 'generic vtuber reaction' on it without context imo
if you say so
or movies
the only torrents you're going to be dinged for are nintendo games and western tv shows
and I'm good on that
it sounds fun enough but it looks like a reactionface show
I'm skipping spy x family for now
I think persona has reached as 'mainstream' as it will ever get
but I don't think it's going to get a magnitude bigger like it did for 5
I mean, yeah
I feel like it's been a while since we've had a reaction face anime take off a bit
Never not worth rewatching
https://youtu.be/jLx9WKf5mhs
switching just sells it less to me
always like that
I think it'd be solid if she was just
we seem to be caught in a spot where interest in assertive girls is mostly manifesting in a bullying/teasing fetish
Maybe in a few years
they should just do a shikimori type show but the girl's just always topping non-stop
but I get what you mean
that's how I feel about every isekai lol
doesn't feel like a real person
agree on not being sold on shikimori, it feels really pandering that she switches between cool and cute
~~yes I just invented the term sue me~~
from everything I've heard spy x family has a lot more broad appeal than nisedere like shikimori
Why is black rock shooter in nanoha
<:blobcatthinking:575405441018888364>
Oh no
The volume of images is a little too high, if you're going to continue please do it in <#407060923078017026>
I'd argue he's the 'protagonist' for quite a few arcs
you should play super robot wars, he's a very major character in the OG series <:catsip:656050349399998464>
Animators can do harder if you've got the money to budget the time
Because sunrise wanted to go cheaper
It's fine
S2 doesnt hold up visually
right, True
true
the second you can get the good ending
no, first run would be true ending
that's why she gets memed so much
satsuki has no route
Akiha, Hisui, and Kohaku all have routes
no aya
Arc and Ciel are the same story
I'd say Tsukihime also basically has 3 routes
ehhh
you can do them both, for the most part, in an adaptation
You don't really have to choose between arceuid and ciel
Far Side isn't really that relevant to the core plot
Near side
very good
Planetarian
both kt and ha basically don't happen
higurashi would have to understand the idea of 'conclusion'
but it was the first
tsukihime just did it badly
FGO destroyed any idea of cohesion
because everything is just Perfect
Tsukihime's true endings are so bittersweet and hard fought that I actually hated Kohaku's ending when I got it
right
she isn't ||mentally disabled,|| she's ||completely bestial and doesn't act human anymore||
wait no
in one ||she dies,|| in the other ||she becomes mentally disabled||
I don't remember which is which Aya
akiha's normal ending is by far the most depressing non-true ending
ciel is immortal why would you not go "yeah, duh, she's stronger"
Kohaku only has one ending - it's the Golden Ending of the game - and Akiha has a True End and a Normal End, because there is only suffering in her route
Every girl other than Akiha and Kohaku has both a True End and a Good End
Tsukihime's way more fucking depressing than fate in terms of how things get resolved
and when I saw the force planet episode I honestly thought it was the stupidest star wars content since lightsaber knees
it does antagonists well and everything else is eh - but I never really saw the appeal of Clone Wars outside "it's okay" myself
I expect they'll continue to do them
but write her as a human being, not several of your fantasy women mashed together
there is a definite niche for a top girlfriend being a badass bitch without being an outright delinquent
like
still if it interested you don't let my feelings for it dissuade you from trying it
I can understand why people love it
I think the base idea is something but it's just too pandering
yeah.
you know when you're watching an anime and you get that vibe that "this character was designed to be Cool, nobody in real life would ever act like this"
I don't agree
yeah
what are you even looking for in mech designs
it's basically the mecha version of fate/stay night but with adaptations that work even less well without having read the original visual novel
there is no good anime way to consume muvluv
TE is a sidestory to a conflict that spans 3 visual novels
conflict definitely isn't resolved lmao
it's more a resistance cell
but if you're in it for military thriller it's probably not really your thing anyway
I didn't even know it had one, honestly
weird
and it's
though Zeta's movies are what you get when you redo an 80s animation with 00s touchups
I mean it's still early 80s animation
(because the source material was so rough)
they're like half reanimated
I personally feel like the MSG movies are kind of an idea above what people normally accept as compilation movies
this is mobile suit gundam
not that the movies are light on them
the benefit of the TV show is you get more humanizing moments but dumber action
then you definitely should have done the movies instead
MSG doesn't really do the "man weapons of war are so cool" thing
0080 is the only one that really doubles down on "liking war is bad actually"
most of gundam side materials are "war is bad, but it's actually fucking sick"
aside from 0080 maybe
I legitimately think it's better than the side materials though
fair I guess
as compilation movies go it's one of the most thorough projects imo
the movies get rid of a lot of the monster of the week mobile armors and redo the technology to be less toy-like
warning about gundam fans: a lot of them have dumb opinions
if you want to watch the TV show after sure
compilation movies are the way to watch MSG
I have yet to meet anyone who was happy with s2
really dumb
but it gets
aldnoah zero is a show about a small military force with mechs using big brain tactics to outmaneuver superweapons etc
but in a way that's good advice for anyone
I'd suggest aldnoah zero for END but he'd have to stop watching at the end of s1 lmao
and then smirk at your fans
just do muvluv HS and refuse to adapt anything after the isekai jump
and nobody pays for even 50 episode shows anymore outside of bandai/konami toy factories
if paced sanely
the VN is the better way to consume the main storyline because it'd be like a 70 episode anime
I wouldn't get fussed about side materials
it's a design from something considerably after the BETA war with a big leap in tech
I don't think they're related
I've never seen this one before
also

lmao.
TSFs make me think the designer really loved armored core
prominent characters die a lot
the dating game isn't light on action lol
uh
oh
it is a spinoff of a dating game
thunderbolt was neat but it tries too hard to be gritty and 'grounded' and came off as a little absurd to me as a result
I do think you'll enjoy 0080, you might also enjoy 0083 if you can put up with mediocre characters
08th just tried really hard to pretend it is
even OYW isn't all that grounded
yeah I was going to say votoms
again, Flay is the best written character in SEED
Yeah, that's fair
I actually have a small Zessica statue ~~because they're dirt cheap~~
that was so fucking stupid
mix deserved better
god
oh yeah and you can also break dimensions with depression
anyway if your reaction to hearing that someone in aquarion punches the moon isn't "tell me more" it's probably not for you
that said yeah Evol gets amazingly shit and proceeds to say "hey check out this kickflip" and then breaks the skateboard it borrowed from tony hawk
there is much worse than bland
you really need to get out more if you think mikono's the worst man
it is both the best super robot show I've ever watched and also one of the worst
Aquarion EVOL is the sequel series to Aquarion
they'd never make it to EVOL
Flay is probably the best written character in SEED and she's a horrible person
that's one
that's not two people btw
"like moses I will part the sea"
he could have been unsatisfied but alive
'war is bad so you shouldn't try'
the worst form of 'war is bad'
it's like
there are generally other decisions that could have been made that could have been also well written but also more interesting
yeah you keep going on about how great X decision was but like
s2 really wanted to be edgy
just because people lose dicerolls doesn't make it not a boring ass result when it happens
I'm not sure that made it a story necessary to tell
IBO s2 was "hey, suffering and edginess is mature writing, right?"
and yeah, reairing removed it
the original TV broadcast of SEED had mwu's helmet floating around in the strike wreckage
: )
no its possible, they edited out his bloody helmet
blockio there are *so many* bad things in destiny that are likely the fault of a single person
but also the one I care least about
it's honestly the dumbest
yeah same
Aya was not referring to Kira getting fried by genesis
not what Aya meant.
that is
~~this is true for destiny though~~
I don't really care about not having beams but that doesn't mean you need misshappen lumps for melee weapons
THIS AINT YOUR DADDYS GUNDAM WITH NO LIGHTSABERS
they seem part of the whole edginess package
they're.... so egh
I'm fine with the designs but I have a strong distaste for the melee weapons of IBO
||zeta fucking killed char off and that stopped nobody||
like
again
you cannot stop something like CCA if there's success on the board
will have some animation tied to it
as part of the mobile game yeah
wait, they're doing one anyway
yeah wow good thing they killed him off to keep them from doing another IBO spinoff
they had lots of other things that would have been meaningful yet also had some catharsis
this really isn't a binary thing, that the only possible way to write the events was what happened
maybe 2 years earlier
yes
like this video creator is *the reason* "over 9000" is a meme
he also did over 9000
the man was gifted at that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e8zUqP8yu4
you have a special place in my heart for being central in an old internet meme video
rip ryu
eureka seven
it's one of the most memorable arcs in mecha and it's been repeated a few times but I feel only improved upon once
I've been thinking about checking it out
there's a very ugly transgender prostitute who chases and pushes themselves on the protagonist largely for comedic effect
but it was pretty decent outside of that
I can't ever recommend it because on a scale of 1-10 of gay panic it registers about a 14
I think the only mecha show he was fairly involved with was gargantia?
which, honestly, doesn't make much sense that shields can deflect positrons but it was an emotionally validating scene so I'll let it slide
no
White base needs salt
Yeah iirc basically all of that was cut from the films lmao
People "forgot" about a colony and 50 years of no contact have somehow made them revert to tribal primitivism
Like stone age people in one of the colonies
Gundam has some really really dumb filler in some series
Neat
I blame australia
I was reminded that Dancouga Nova did 00's plot 6 months before 00 aired
Shinkalion, the most elaborate advertisment for public transportation ever made
it's so wild that we're actually putting stuff like this in children's anime
sure why not
when we re-opened trades it wasn't worth it
we stopped that with covid
not anymore for the 360
yes
not a lot of them - most are worthless
we still take in and sell games
?
at least once yes
360s in particular just aren't worth the effort due to the training difficulties
and they kind of did that with the final ribbons fight but that was mostly just a VA fanservice thing
case in point
and then they make it ugly
it's usually a sequel series of some sort and the bad guy digs up the original
though it's generally not in the same season
that's happened in a few super robot shows but it generally involves doing something really weird
sure, it makes *sense* to use the old stuff but the emotional connection is all weird and more to the point the old protagonist suit will inevitably end up jobbing because the side character narratively isn't allowed to pull serious weight
you know reflecting on it I think I generally prefer the cliche of a mecha getting destroyed during the upgrade arc rather than the old machine still getting used by a supporting character
gamestop no longer accepts ps3 and 360 consoles because they're too vintage fyi
Those are Pixar specific aside from the last one
Utah teapot, 1138, 0451
There's a few Easter eggs that are famous
Pizza planet truck? No wait it's the old car of one of the creative leads isn't it
"Fin Fannaru" is too cute
Though I routinely put puru in the nu in srw
No one else can tell me the nu Gundam is not for show
I think so yeah
I prefer the cartoon network one but it's incomplete
There's two dubs
Eureka 7 is msg except on weed
I never actually put it together until now that this was another thing of the original msg that eureka 7 redid
The cg action in that show is comparable to modern movies
Still boggles me that majestic prince was 10 years ago
for example there's like 4-5 models of 360 and basically all have their own weird power setup
for gamestop it's just not worth the training
there are a few smaller mom and pop stores that will take them as well as pawn shops but
with more cameras
it gets an upgrade later
beauty.
look at that sexy face

or an eyeslit or whatever
there's several ways to do a visor but yes like GM
visors are the one true head design
they're right
that said this is a lovely boy, praise this boy
the fixation on monoeyes is a bit tedious sometimes
It just feels too crisp and sharp for the workhorse design the og zaku really had
The zaku doesn't work as well when it's *shiny*
Even standalone I find it easy to criticize
The prior grunts had a clear progression and lineage that this throws in the trash in order to shamelessly pander to fans to sell model kits
It doesn't feel like it belongs in the setting at all END
Then in the sequel season they use this garbage
CE grunts actually looked cool at first
Man
Jim does sound like people who have to say it 800 times a day would do it
Jii Em
Counterpoint: Jeep
Jean and Denim
Don't forget the first two Zeon soldiers
gunevo, Gunevo, or GunEvo all would make me die less inside
I cannot take any sentence stylizing it as GUNEVO seriously
Uh-huh
It has better performance than basically any suit in the oyw and even better than some zeta suits
It technically *is* the best suit based on paper stats though 0080's technical manual brings some questions
GM sniper II

Ugh
It also has the best suit of the oyw
But it's my favorite UC gundam
Never heard the dub
I think Zeta is great but kamille pisses a lot of people off
How do you deal with whiny kids
Yeah
it's been a steady downhill run since the lifesize rx-78
haha I forgot how much the FF sucks
G04 ended up overcharging the mega beam rifle it had so it could wipe out an entire fleet in the final days of the war and blew itself up after the fleet was wiped
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj5lURhNVQU

G04 and G05 are the coolest because one blew itself up in the most badass way and the other had a chaingun
for some reason they gave the ground GM luna titanium armor but not the RX-79
the fucking ground GM
you know what was a better suit than the RX-79
though ironically
yeah
because the RX-79 is 50% RX-78
at this point I think there's like 90 RX-78s running around the OYW
that doesn't even count the G3, G-04, G-05, Mudrock, or any of the other questionably canon suits that they keep inventing
an engineering support squad is a really interesting vantage point
I still think you'd like igloo if you can tolerate the CG people long enough
they cannot all be canon
origin directly conflicts with other animations
except origin
origin's kinda neat but it's really important to remember that basically nothing in it is canon even if it feels like it should be
Unicorn is the best animated thing I've ever seen that I think maybe I hate
please don't elaborate you'll depress END at how magical UC gets
(Unicorn is maybe the fucking dumbest expression of this idea - "what if we give it a gundam face but it only sometimes has it and it has to turn its head inside out to show it")
nobody else has this really fucking fundamental idea
for some reason the protagonist faction is always the only ones who go "what if we make it have a gundam face for psychological impact"
I mean it's incredibly arbitrary why they make stuff gundams and why they don't
the protagonist uses a mass produced suit
again, something never really seen in gundam
Yeah, it possessed better sensors and comms than the mass produced Victory
here's V Dash Hexa
Dash refers to the extra backpack with the cannons
no, V Hexa
The Hexa is maybe the one time I can think of in gundam history where a supporting character gets a straight up better gundam than the protagonist
\
the opening of the vents for super mode was a very clever way to really go all out on the samurai helmet without making the design of the normal mode overbearing
the best go at "gundam as samurai" was Shining
to look like a samurai
the Gespenst line is unironically a fucking amazing line of units
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW4MpbTUc94
They debut it in OG 2nd but I'm pretty sure it's also in Moon Dwellers
lots more cameras
Basically a windam but like, .5% cooler
and I mean it's okay
See: Compatikaiser being a gigantic self-homage to Gravion
and obari tends to be really proud of his work
I don't have anything to base this off of other than they sure pushed the Exbein hard
I *think* Obari came up with the initial idea
actually I'm not sure if it was Obari - Katoki definitely did the final pass though
so Obari created a new design
I think the best idea I have for what happened to the huckebeins is Sunrise made a fit when they wanted to *animate* the Huckebein (again) for the second SRW OG anime
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
This is the Exbein Ashe, debuting in the game where they destroyed all the huckebeins and decided to move away from them for a few years
it's much more relevant to
there's another design
I don't see it but
They've definitely buried whatever hatchet they had - back in 2017 they put the Huckebein in SRW V, and last year the main original unit was the Huckebein 30/Huckebein 30th




It's a gundam but cooler, generally
I mean it *is* beyond just a gundam head
Huckbeins existed for fucking 15 years before that
I've just never bought the suit argument
Like they were all still family even if there wasn't a formal holding company
That doesn't really matter, it was still the same zaibutsu or whatever
It was already under the same umbrella
the point where OG started trashing the huckebeins was well after Banpresto was absorbed by Bandai Namco Games
the argument never made much sense to me
I have never heard that they got sued, just lots of speculation
meanwhile we have definitely hit the "we're in the middle of the season and it's time for random themes for monsters" segment of this show
it's 1/35 scale
garage kit from the 00s, I tried to get one when I was in highschool but they were like 2500

s gundam has always had huge kits
S gundam had some really fun equipment packages
<:catsip:656050349399998464>

the S gundam was probably the best machine in UC until psycoframe
that's where the ammo drums are
That's why it has those fat 'ears' behind the head
like gatling cannons
the S Gundam's head was designed 'realistically' - Katoki actually wanted to see what it would look like if he actually made one that could fit all the shit that's inside it
ALICE was the best UC berserker system
yes
shout out to the best UC waifu
hey while I'm on the subject of sentient chicks stuck inside UC machines
HADES is very much a "can I copy your homework" moment
her soul was stuck in the EXAM system
I did not get it flipped
blocked
they both amplify the machine for oldtypes to newtype levels
pale rider's tortures the pilot, the blue destiny tortures some innocent little girl instead
yeah so was the old one
though the BD's was kinda metal
including bullshit newtype system secretly installed that makes it berserk
I wish I liked the pale rider but it's just such a shameless copy of the blue destiny
even has resting bitch face
frankly she's kind of a bitch
and she's definitely more of a character here
it is her first animated appearance
no it sounds fine, it'd just be impossible with vocaloid software
yeah.....
it's a little too good to be just composed with vocaloid software
I'm 95% actual voice of the woman who recorded hatsune miku's samples in the first place, and then they run it through a modulator to make it sound artificial
this is the last frame I'm going to post but, what the fuck
she even has a voice modulator




<@213645184125239317> oh my god no it's much more
what the fuck is this train anime

oh my fucking god
the random civilians
I've reached the episode
oh no
idols ruining things for everyone once again üòî
he's done official art of barbatos
I mean it's just stuff he did designs or posters for
I'm pretty sure one would never be designed so light but sure
counterpoint
lol
too far
the land battleship was kinda neat but there's a canon design that pushes it a little uh

I absolutely love the absolute random fucking designs of 0079's non-mecha craft tbh
it's pretty cute
shame it basically never gets used as a plane and is instead the enabler of the most nonsense bullshit but hey a good design is a good design

gundam has one above all imo
for not core fighters and just 'fighter craft'
Crossbone as a unit is designed to operate in jupiter gravity well
idk it's just super cool
my favorite core fighters are the V2's and the Crossbone's
all that ridiculous shit gets replaced with this
they also retconned how stupid the core fighter combinations were
they didn't only retcon how stupid the death was
its me
(holy shit laura please stop singing that awful song)
but I find it has a lot of strengths
Dancouga is slow and has a few flaws
I was surprised that ||Alan dies, because Black Wing combines with Dancouga to form Final Dancouga in most modern SRW||
It's fine, I don't want to make a big deal out of it
And then omitted that while making sure you made it seem like I was silly for getting things mixed up
You knew there was a remix album and you acted like there wasn't why
So
Wait ok
https://promare.fandom.com/wiki/Promare_Original_Soundtrack_Remix_%26_Rearrange_CD
Iirc there were several tracks
You just linked something from it
With cover art only slightly less good than the first
Circling back, they actually made a remix album for panty and stocking as well
I didn't like the remix album as much but it's neat
Have you heard the track based on Inferno but with the drop?
He scored Promare, too
As a reminder this is not the only trigger anime with a sawano score
People started paying attention to the sawano drop after my body is dry
One of the definitive sawano scores even
Teddyloid did almost the entire OST and it still stands out as one of the best anime soundtracks of all time
If you want more teddyloid trigger goodness, panty and stocking is one of the best original works of the last 20 years
extra decks are for chumps
if no one wants to talk about higurashi after the like 9th hint dropped, it's possible you should just move on
There is a canon visual design for ryu roots thanks to g gen though
But your point remaina
The photonovel actually has a few suits not in the original iirc
There's an actual novel
After all, she barely 'exists', her whole point is an AI love story tragedy
I don't think there's any official visual representation of her
Oh interesting
Now if the Gundam was built *for this* I'd be gobsmacked but I imagine using what's there wasn't tooooo bad
It's impressive but I've seen plywood sets that impressed me as much
As long as the maintenance work was checked out beforehand the actual execution of stage mechanics is generally straightforward
I used to be a stage tech
I mean I've heard Yokohama is windy and capturing album quality music outdoors is just brutal
Probably a sound engineer's nightmare but cute
That's cute
I have significant problems with unicorn but the music wasn't one of them
I've heard the anime is good if you like that kind of thing before it veers into being a complete production trainwreck
Movie wasn't flawless but that OST was on point
Still says something that as good as inferno was it wasn't even the best vocal track in promare
acknowledging japanese atrocities was a huge no-no back then and honestly still gets pretty huge pushback in japan from nationalists
many modern gundam are like "look at the special kid fight war, it would be nice if everyone could ~communicate~"
this stuff is why I think the original MSG really does still hold up - whether or not this is spot on or not, there's enough stuff here to chew on and analyze pretty thoroughly
It might be Tomino reflecting on aspects like that
but the writers, and the viewers, clearly aren't bad people, right?
Japan committed quite a few atrocities
not only that, but that might bring a few other things into perspective taken this way
but ww2 is a deeply personal conflict for them
Japan doesn't care about ww1 stories
I also think I kind of understand your point but I think the deciding factor is
I don't think newtypes inherently are what's awful about UC when I complain about them especially in late UC, fyi - it's the way gundam writes protagonists and treats newtype as a superpower for them first and foremost that drags things down
the battle between 'are they actually better' and 'yeah kinda actually' forms a lot of UC subtext
I do think the existence of newtypes, an actual 'superior race,' gives it an interesting flavor
Overall I think it kind of pairs well with the vague feel of "I hope the Federation wins because they don't deserve to be conquered even if they were kinda asking for it"
It's hard to not like Dozle's devotion to his men and Garma was barely not a kid, doing his best
in lockstep with the rest of MSG's narrative, the rest of the Zabis are pretty decent people
that's my theory as to why Tomino wrote Kycillia, Degwin, and especially Gihren to be dickbags
the Zabis basically parasitize the big cause of the OG charismatic Zeon leader they basically took over from
so you have to pair that with 'war bad because even when war good you can't trust people who would war'
again, giving them actual justification impairs 'war bad'
and denying them meaningful representation
subsequent retcons have made it *really* explicit they had justification but even with MSG materials, the earth was basically maneuvering them into horrible resource pinches to exploit them and shit
so tomino made their actual desires of war more murky
probably because zeon actually has justification to declare war
the ww2 comparisons are not subtle
she indeed could have been a mother
coupled with superhuman awareness of multiple things on the battlefield, which good pilots theoretically already have
they mostly just use psychic brainwaves as an alternative wireless communication that isn't affected by minovsky particles
newtype weapons are generally 'reasonable' I think
and even that's tame compared to unicorn/nt but eh, I feel by then you know what you're in for
still doesn't get truly whack until the end of zeta
Though you can tell obari's picked up new tricks and habits in the 20 years since
I've seen a weird take where someone claims it feels more gravion than dancouga and I don't think I agree
Which is a bit of an odd bird at the end but I think it has enough of the dancouga spirit in that the entire piloting cast are fucking certified
The only other thing to tackle would be Nova
Odd
It was
I watched it before subs were available
Strange definitely sums it up

did you try FMP
it doesn't try to be human
Just to check, you have seen 86 right
00 has some really interesting design ideas and concepts of warfare but I'll warn you ahead of time it gets thrown in the trash for the second season and you get some pretty fukkin generic gundam
They look super different because the first two are chinese/india (they're all one superpower now) and the last is USA



yes
Gundam 00's first season has a lot of appealing designs
oh hm

I feel like you'd like the initial units of Code Geass but really hate where it goes
guy who did mellowlink/votoms
it came to mind because it's one of the other Ryosuke Takahashi works
(this is the hero unit so it's more human than others)

There's dougram but I've yet to actually watch that one so I don't know if it's.... actually interesting
Do you specifically want tank inspiration because I find most of the military-adjacent mecha tend to be plane based like Orguss
> I think SDF macross actually is an answer to your question but is not one you would find satisfying
the concept of "walking tank" as western mecha understands it is mostly battletech derived
I don't really know what to say exactly
I think SDF macross actually is an answer to your question but is not one you would find satisfying

this, for example?
those designs are now locked away and given nicknames like the Unseeables but the design lineage for newer designs is still there
but when battletech started it had to get its designs from *somewhere* and so many designs were pretty much directly taken from anime
Starship Troopers, which is the source of stuff like warhammer and starcraft, and Battletech
So there are basically two formative works for western mecha
and a few others, but
and the answer is SDF macross lol
Because I realized where most of them come from
oh man can I talk about 'western scifi' robots
I feel as a work Ideon isn't as interesting as gundam, but if you ever become fascinated with MSG's writer/director, it's insightful
with aliens, this time, but it was much more back and forth than most fight-off-alien super robot shows of the time
Ideon was also a war story
`super gm`

the design may seem familiar to you
though
ideon does make for a pretty dope toy design
it's probably worth mentioning that zambot 3 probably scarred some kids for life with episode 17 lmao
so I think it's more about super robots being giant shining heroes who are literal proxies for barely flawed heroes that got him thinking  about trying to tell a real war story with one
Ideon, the show he did right after gundam, is the one of the top 5 most powerful super robots ever put in anime and it's something the people who use it are scared of because they don't fully control it
Zambot 3 has the child protagonist and his family be scorned and hated for trying to save the world from aliens
I think he had a pushback to superheroes
I dunno if he really had a pushback to super robots
Things to say
both the mecha show he did before MSG, a kids show called Zambot 3, and the show he did after, have
honestly tomino's pretty hung up on atrocities in general
https://twitter.com/UmJammerRammy/status/1520517034462695424

yeah no I think they explicitly intended to reference SEED-type designs here, and it looks great
this shinkalion is just a fucking astray gundam
I mostly liked Nova but everything regarding moon will made no sense, but hey, at least it's wakamoto
The reference is likely intentional but who knows if it's the right character
but least FS is there
yeah that was eh
I could not fucking make this up if I tried
she hadn't been in the last like 5 episodes but she gets a fucking shining knight moment
this show is eroding my sanity
with Hatsune Miku popping in unannounced to suddenly rush in and block a sword blow
fucking deal
I cannot
Shinkalion, which is filled with shit like this
I kind of unironically love the way this show is passionate about something so niche in a wholesome way
oh my god this show brought up Doctor Yellow
congrats to ms eve for finding a generic anime guy to marry
Did you ever hear the ranka/Sheryl totsugeki planet explosion
It's hard to pick
All the songs are bangers though
Try Again *is* a strong buff but morale is a challenge and it's just better to be able to use more moves sooner than it is to have stats 40 higher usually
Oh music also works on the final boss
Using music offensively is almost never worth it aside from protodeviln
It is catchy but it's + morale instead of + stats
Though totsugeki love heart is definitely the best most of the time
And they give each attack it's own bgm
Basara is one of the most powerful units in alpha 3
Absolutely love that alpha 3 has information high as a bgm
Sure beats the shit out of zero
But I don't have many bad things to say about it
I enjoy plus though it's kind of a downer overall
OVA or movie
All four of them are fucking lunatics
Nova is a mess but the mech is great and I love the cast so
though the one where nova brofists OG dancouga is good too
the other thing dancouga nova did was give us the single best dynamic kill in SRW
I think of very melon or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlLhw1mtCFA
Macross plus and shinkalion are diametrically opposed because Hatsune Miku is a teammate in shinkalion but is the main villain in plus
Yeah basara is better but it makes dynamite slam way harder mixed like this
I feel the mix elevates everything tbh
https://youtu.be/Tf-hD_DFeyU this fanmix where someone mixed in the original fire bomber tracks
Ok well it's okay but you know what's better
Zeta's strings are nice
in general I don't think it's remarkable at all tbh
forgot Outlaw Star was sunrise
huh
ok.
this train anime getting weird
I think as long as the plot flows *through* that world, and isn't being dualloaded both inside and outside of it at the same time, it works
I don't actually think being in another world against your will is needed for an isekai story
yeah that's literally the only smash hit part of SAO cypher
now SAO *stops* being an isekai, but the part that exploded was isekai
and that's the bit the audience cares about
either way, you're living in a different world
narratively there is not a huge difference between being reincarnated and being stuck
I would definitely consider sao an isekai
describes most of thunderbolt
honestly
which
it's showy and slightly pretentious
it's decent but not super good jazz
oh man
emphatically yes
yes
where SAO ends up *going* has almost nothing on the initial impact of SAO
the rest of SAO is almost nothing in comparison
those 4 episodes are some of the most important episodes of the entire 2010s in terms of cultural relevance
Cypher I don't know how to tell you this
yes
the few episodes that *made the genre explode*
The few episodes *everyone watched*
No they were a central part to the first story arc
in what
that's why those writers decided to make an isekai story in the first place
but
It's uncreative and exists so that writers can flesh out ideas without actually inventing a new thought
still a good show imo, because the anime adaptation layers in a new focus on overcoming hikkikimoriness that the source material did not have
04's rozen maiden
I remember explicitly the first 1 cour show I watched and was so confused that an anime could be so short
TV shows in *general* were less about telling a single plot thread and more about exploring a space
also yeah
honestly I think the biggest damage SAO ended up doing to the isekai genre was help lay the idea that writers should symbolize stuff with MMO stats
but the MC is stuck
you see other people logging in and out of the world all the time
though .hack/sign is an interesting thing to consider
yes cypher congrats that is the question I was trying to get at this whole time
.hack/sign is kinda close to this
if the *reasons* to go into the virtual world come from outside of it, that doesn't matter as long as your entire adventure is in the virtual world
but like, you're doing two things at once is the key thing here
I made it up, deal with it
if a matrix story was about someone going into the matrix to do a thing and the story didn't revolve around characters not in the matrix doing a thing at the same time it would have isekai elements
"cyberpunk, not isekai" isn't a thing, you can be both.
but they might have a *point*
like I don't want to say they're *right*
I just saw someone call Outlaw Star "anime guardians of the galaxy" and I'm a bit....
it's like watching someone with a personality that's been hand assembled
shikimori has been giving me fucking creepy vibes whenever I see clips
speaking of female characters carefully structured to appeal to audiences without being human
like setting up the auto on another gacha
all that time could be spent on doing more productive things like playing terrible gacha
nice
oh he gets ice fang now
it's not a special attacker but yes
yes
also lance is just considering his type matchups
researcher I think
didn't gary retire to do something wholesome
<:papikaGun:304122221868220426>
what is this table placement
FSS is basically l-gaim 2: l-gaim harder
Sure is a shame Nagano fucking lost it
I think symphogear deserves to be high but it's important to recognize that statistical bias is definitely in play
people who drop it on season 1 or 2 are not going to rate season 4 or 5 except out of spite
symphogear is overrated on MAL tbf, it suffers very hard from sequel effect
yeah I'd put it at an 8
really good action but the plot kinda flubbed
I feel 7 is pretty fitting for dynazenon though
I feel like it is probably the best broad appeal anime this season maybe but the ratings results is hugely recency bias
god gravion is also one of my favorite units in SRW Z and is one of the main reasons for me to pick the Setsuko route <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
Zwei is basically a step up in every single category but in some ways I think Gravion's monster of the week plot simplicity worked for the kind of show it was
anyway I'm honestly mixed on Gravion vs Gravion Zwei
you can make out the OG mech underneath the new armor
it actually took me a while to notice Ultimate Dancouga isn't a 'new dancouga'
Ultimate Dancouga really is "what if I glued Gravion's armor onto Dancouga"
it's the character animation that sucks
I do think Gravion itself is one of the best post-00s super robot designs and it looks great in the show
I can kinda see it
yeah he's like a cross between him and gen fudou or something
üëå
also sho hayami sandman
it's such a mixed bag but I can't hate it - the animation sucks and the story is lackluster, but shit like *mechanic maids* is just so endearing and funny
it is p dumb
how else are you going to have a pretty boy x pretty boy romance manga and still be straight
yeah
yeah ok
ok there it is
I can't find anything confirming that crunchyroll distrubted it
was it
tv shows also have a better revenue output for the license-givers, since they get paid based on time watched
why buy a license for something for 90-180 minutes long when you can keep buying packages of shows that every season has like 260 minutes, divided up better for inserting ads
and it's cynical as hell
damn I just realized why they don't care about movies
oh
ok but will they start actually streaming movies
still, the world needs more girl top protagonists
like it's worse than KLK for "let's make a checklist of fetishes we're touching on"
it is very explicitly gay but also very explicitly kink yes
I was really confused because I saw "how do people think mob looks good" and I was like "??? did you not *watch* mob psycho" but then I understood
there's just a huge bank of fog that rolls in 6 times an episode
rays of light may not be enough
the MC wears pasties - that get damaged - the majority of the time she's doing anything
I mean yeah that's true, with shit like that and redo I guess just making porn is mainstream now
how far would they push it, how would they distribute it
it's more daring than KLK
oh you can definitely do LUTMG as an anime but like.
how would they do that
god
see also: slime
generally most gimmick isekais start flopping around the point the protagonist comes up with a fairly permanent workaround for their drawback, so all they've got are the benefits
it feels like a "I think yuri stories are the best but I'm too straight to connect with them" thing
a yuri paradise and you're gonna focus on the one straight relationship left
<:yayakaStare:292520684326748161>
https://twitter.com/gomanga/status/1524465272429678594

wait it's not complete without the dumb weapon
It's great, I hate it

the 500 also has this fantastically hideous combination with the protagonist

which is also in this show.
liner gao is actually the 500
yeah that's fucking real too
I just learned that the stupid combination shit they do in the show
*man*
this anime has been insanely consistent on accurate visuals



the lab-coat look is because that's... well, that's what shinkansens look like, color wise
so in context the 'normal anime girl' is visiting a meet and greet with costumed people, the 'pokemon' is probably a generic toku villain
shinkansen sentai.... shinkansentai?
generally if I manage to finish it it's going to be at least 6 by that metric, for anime
I think to me 5 is if I managed to get through something and not really feel positive or negative about it
I still have like a year of content to get through before this

How do you all feel about people rating shows they dropped before, let's say the halfway point of a 1-2 cour show
It is definitely a fancy music video but it reaches beyond to 'auteur piece '
But it does have soul
I mean 5555 isn't the most compelling thing
https://youtu.be/3Qxe-QOp_-s
If you inspire him to make a space opera I think thats more extra credit than cheating
Point, but I feel Matsumoto legitimizes it
Made by the supreme god of Japanese space operas
Yes
I would submit daft punk as the ultimate challenger to sawano
And of course, technically, if we're comparing anime space operas
Gaogaigar as well
Gunbuster and diebuster are examples
I think Tanaka kouhei still has him beat
I don't think I've seen a more evil super robot enemy
Butcher the killer should be a 100 on deserved not 95
5/10
The best part of that image is hidamari sketch
Those are the three UC problem children
Same with Katz
Maybe 70
I think Hathaway gets like a 65
Idk I'd personally put kamille at 40 for deserves it
I don't think he's the reference point
Probably the fact they didn't want to put him higher or lower
I think that's pretty appropriate
I like how katejina and Rau are like, the same spot
Sanity will just give out at some point
At some point he won't, cypher is correct
If both lead the the same place the one with less pain is less bad
Boredom is probably better
One is pain the other is boredom
No
Is my only counter statement
Light had more justification than most people who are high on this scale
It was an insanely fucked up kids show
Among other things he kidnaps humans, turns them into human bombs, and releases them back into the public to explode at a random interval later
Main antagonist of zambot 3
Happy families in anime are generally there because you're a side character or because they're going to die
We find out her family situation sucks but like
Basa doesn't really suffer at all in gx
if you haven't seen nichibros you really should

the G stands for guys
can't believe they'd do my cinnamon roll tohru like that
<:YayakaSmile:709137283508469760>
there's like, one anime I've seen that has a better payoff arc
yayaka's arc is fucking blessed
same
considering she's madoka's primary asset, I assume so
I didn't mean to sound rude btw, I was wondering if there was a BD update with something new I didn't know about lol
Frankly, I don't think Rebellion's plot occurred to urobuchi while they were writing madoka TV
I don't think that was teasing anything
I don't know what you're talking about
also I can't understand the unsatisfying ending comment, I thought madoka TV wrapped up pretty neat
things in a soap opera can only go wrong so many times before you catch on
in terms of media that does this kind of thing
there's definitely points where it gets boring, even if you're dumb to the distress
Though, naturally, there's a point where it's no longer palatable to a viewer
Suffering for suffering's sake is somewhat true, but the unique nature of the ending actually means the more miserable the show was the more meaningful the ending
I don't agree with this review
so many people insisting there's orders and you'll miss X if you don't Y
the lore is what's prevented me from watching it
the magical girls were *intentionally* designed to be on the generic side to make the shock hit better
like it's fine but it's not something to hang a giant franchise on
madoka's world isn't particularly great, is my problem with it
free mission with everyone right
so by shinkalion mission you don't mean the shinkalion intro, you mean the uh
wait what
the game is like half dlc missions now lol
more to the point, you're basically in the 'get the band together' part of the road trip story
hm I guess akurasu breaks the chapters up slightly differently than me - by that metric, you're probably chapters 2-3 out of 9, with a secret 10 and 11 being formed by added content
you're still basically in chapter 2
oh lol
e5 is a really weird unit mechanically though
I wasn't 100% sure if the new content was post-game only
okay neat
did you already beat the main plot
wait, iski, how far were you
hoping you get to have the e5 for longer on a fresh playthrough
the E5 Mk II unironically looks better than what you get later from that plotline
he is using this revelation to decide to try to talk to the antagonists
because the shinkansens need to work with both
the main character just referenced the fact that west/east japan uses two different soy sauces for sushi by comparing it to the 50/60hz national grid divide
oh my god shinkalion is a fucking trip
but you don't get a cute girl looking disappointed and disgusted at you
I'm pretty sure there's a maid cafe that insults its visitors
rather than being about feminine traits empowering them to be heroes, it's about feminine traits causing them to destroy and ruin
also, madoka TV is a true magical girl show with magical girl themes, but rebellion is exactly the 'dark' false version people accuse madoka and madoka clones of being imo
the movie was very good, I just thought the series was saying something more interesting
But the late 00s was the era of the disaffected ikemen
I just feel like there's a dozen character ideas that would have been better for frontier than alto
(the answer is because when sdf did it they landed one of the most satisfying love triangles in anime)
The main reason you should watch sdf before frontier is to understand why they're forcing in a love triangle with a boring protagonist
It's a 6.5/10 movie with 9/10 moments
Man I'm annoyed expelled from paradise wasn't just a little bit better
I'm not sure I agree, it's like saying Sancho Panza is the protagonist of don quixote
And are romantically linked
Her and Bernie are kind of deuteragonists
Doesn't Christina disrupt that
There's nothing particularly compelling about him
Kou is the biggest nothing in Gundam imo
It's better to be bad than boring
0083 has some of the worst characters in UC yeah
Dreisstrager goes from being kind of a slow unuseable pos to by far the most busted command unit I've ever seen in a srw
Mitsuba will probably have her megabuff aura which won't stack with that
but by the time you get that
I'd also suggest putting a command terminal on her to give her Commander Level 4 when you finally get one of those rarities
yeah
purple 2's CUB, if you want to spoil what it is to decide for yourself
> ||+20% final Accuracy and Evasion to all allies within 5 spaces.||
and go "try this one"
Purple 2 is the only one I might really point at
but it's something to somewhat shoot for
I feel you probably know this
if you bump a unit up to 50% unit stats (weapons not needed) they get a custom bonus
It's worth noting
they do explicitly suggest to only do Super Expert Hard Plus or whatever on NG+ yeah
a lot of SRW's ex-hards are "can't upgrade weapons" though
it just has a "upgrades are dramatically more expensive and you can barely afford any" difficulty
30 doesn't have a can't upgrade weapons difficulty afaik
because he's not a damage machine but grunts are reaching 30-50k hp levels
like, super late post-game
*amuro* ends up falling off super late game
though they'll probably all work fine where you are
I feel like they worked hard to keep the OG units slightly underpowered, SRX was one of the few I really got good mileage out of
well, Az stuff post-game, SRX might be elsewhere
it also includes extra SRX and Az stuff post-game
oh, and getter devolution
dancouga/shinkalion/votoms/MJP movie
yeah
there are reasons it's not particularly remembered
3 OVAs
yeah
I told you no one remembered it lol
https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Model_Suit_Gunpla_Builders_Beginning_G
I wasn't talking about fighters
I don't think they really made anything significant outside of that until G-Reco
they basically hyperfocused on unicorn for about 5 years with a few side projects like 00 movie, a few gunpla builders OVAs no one remembers, and the level-5 led AGE
Arguable
because we had people tling the books in fandom circles and everyone was like "ehhhhhhhh man that's kinda fucked but damn I love" [unicorn/delta plus/kshatriya/sinanju]
though I don't think anyone actually cared about the story
you kinda had to be there but Unicorn was probably the most hyped non-animated gundam thing of all time due to how popular the first MG was
I accept it doesn't but idk why people leapt to that
I mean, it can be released in bulk as it *starts* to trickle weekly episodes
For a product that's going to have lower merchandise opportunity
So a studio has to work all in the red until Netflix accepts it
Wow
There's no investment?
Ah
Because if they have firm due dates it's just worse than broadcasting
Or do they have flex
Does Netflix give the studios due dates
Netflix is where anime get made to die
I will accept I'm probably wrong then
I guess I could be misinformed <:ChrisThink:724037732539695154>
I heard Netflix Japan does that?
And it still got weekly releases in Japan but not simulcast in the west
the idea of exploring the edges of what SD gundam *can* be seem really cool
the three main cast members of SD were Captain Gundam, who was basically a juiced-up classic RX-78 design, Zero, who is a wing zero custom but gone through the Knight Gundam machine, and bakunetsumaru, a shining gundam from sengoku SD gundam design land
just, maybe not aimed at 8 year olds
where they bring in SD gundam ideas from several of the 'lines'
I actually kind of want a revisit to Superior Defender type ideas
I will never get over them making the token 90s wheelchair kid into the guntank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8um1N78AhY
lets not forget the most important SD gundam
oh
less those, but those have steadily bloomed to consume all and now that's the only animated SD content that gets made
I prefer it to the full on musou gundam shit they've tied SD up with with no escape
because it actually aired in america
there are elmeth mice on the komusai and I giggle every time I spot them
okay
yeah the sangoku stuff is
oh
it's definitely not great but the gundam jokes might carry you
Superior Defender is okay
it is about human sized robots
SD gundam is not about tiny robots
I guess I'd prefer a story about tiny robots more than I'd prefer a story about building models
it's not the tech, it's that something more primitive would have more storytelling opportunities
danball senki is the obvious comparison point here, where they actually put motors into the robots
it's not that
when your gundams don't actually move, you're stuck only getting to use them in the video game
above all I felt the plavsky particle field was a serious limitation on what they could actually do with the story
it hinges on ISNT GUNDAM AND GUNPLA COOL so much the show's left with weaknesses
actually that's pretty much my major criticism with the show
autofellating
it feels very
I don't like the underlying theme all that much
yeah
and I didn't like the lack of design cohesion in the show
I never watched past Fighters, I liked it but was unimpressed with the lack of ambition
I expect in the future they had to submit designs for approval months in advance
it's basically that
have you watched stargazer?
oh
please don't use triggered as a synonym for upset
I mean, V2...
that explains some of why later build fighters/divers designs look so divorced from gundam
and it had the personality of a drill instructor
yes
I want another one
man this show was stupid
oh right, the other best character
yeah I'm familiar with the second v
actually a brainwashed GP04
the evil doctor Professor Gerbera
superior defender had so many fun things
I'm not super in love with rotk nor do I remember enough of it to really get the deep jokes so yeah I just wish they'd branch out
the man, the myth, the **legend**, Chief Haro

the best character design in all of gundam
Superior defender does have
knight SD designs, samurai SD designs, 'modern' ones, and then they can go further with like, mermaid designs or cyber designs or all sorts of stuff
I mean, stuff like
if only captain didn't have a fucking mouth
The independent thought thing
This is literally the plot of the bad batch
||I think it would have been more impressive for them to be friends and still follow their conditioning, but this way it's not "their fault"||
Both things highlight how little moral ambiguity star wars is allowed to have though
The force planet is fantastically dumb though
I do think the ||brain chips|| were a bad idea, but I get why they were written in
It has some really dumb additions to sw canon
I don't have a huge opinion on the new guy, I'm just looking forward to (HF novel/part 2 spoilers) ||the scene with him signing Mafty's death certificate||
The car physics are why you should watch this though
There's nothing like every building being always full bright flat colored
Ugliness can be nostalgic
It's like I'm really watching cromartie
Oh nooo
Quality van is legendary
It is worth your time
If you have never seen this before and you want to know how bad things were
https://youtu.be/LUlhkgffLtQ
No, symphogear s1 had decent animation if we're comparing with early 00s
the E is somehow drilling into my brain
there is something horribly wrong and cursed with this serif font they used
ah, the three genders
I'm sure it will connect this with trains somehow within a few episodes
it's really more circling back and talking about how humanity is inherently a social species who evolved co-operation in order to protect the fact that women have difficult births for mammals, and The Power of Friendship is the way to further our evolution in that regard
shinkalion is surprisingly philosophical about the power of friendship
That's fine but it sounds like it's one of those works where they just repeat the story gimmick rather than progress
Oh so it just repeats the "nooo I don't want to be gay I want friends" arc?
But I don't really want to invest too much judgement in a synopsis probably not even written by the tl team
I feel it can be heteronormative without guys in it
"oh that annoying gaylord is trying to distract me from important things again"
The synopsis sounds so hetero
I'm struggling to think if there's a nerdier sentence you could have said there
aya why
2 times too many <:Elf9Delete:679828318782095389>
but honestly this is the same question of "why does Thanos speak english"
if yuuno did do that it could explain raising heart
I'm a little shaky on this
I thought yuuno made her understand him
she meets yuuno before using raising heart right
oh, I did recognize little wish but the others just did not stick in my brain
very Generic 00s sound
I did not recognize a single one lmao
I flipped through the OPs EDs
I feel like yunoha did something to make her compatible but idk, her pure heart of maidenness did it or something
There are very very few flawless anime ~~coughgaogaigarcough~~, so it's better to reach farther while stumbling
I think it could have tied a few things up slightly better, but generally it does so well while being so much more ambitious than most everything else
like, I can pinpoint what decade they're making fun of
I've never heard mid 90s mecha themes parodied so accurately
the middle half of the anime was just like "man yeah this idea sounds dope lets do it"
also yes, one of the strongest anime payoffs I've seen period
<@87512939107450880> look what they did to italian food
it's also half a gn-x
they got past the rough bit
yeah but kotoko's at the part that didn't suck as a show
sorry, Z has 41 episodes
plus a movie plus another 26 or something for Shinkalion Z
it is not a particularly special show but it has managed to retain energy for 40 episodes
I'm actually surprised I have not dropped shinkalion yet
but ugh, that's a commitment
I do still need to watch gatari
~~they also made the one decent sao anime~~
the fight in the middle of all their memories was so good

things are okay though and hopefully there will be a Better Answer soon
yeah, the thing you mentioned, and I just can't really be super upset at other people when you're like "oh look forward to all the future times nanoha "befriends" people and understanding the memes" and then other users want to...  talk about the memes
<a:headpat:642599312173563907>
I'm working with staff on a solution for the whole mass posting dilemma though it may take a few days if we decide to go through with that
idk
other than cast members exist
none of these screenshots are actually spoilers
(it also isn't much of a spoiler given the title of several nanoha seasons)
but maybe we should all be careful hyping up future things to someone barely into a show going forward
I'm not going to bonk anyone for spoilers or anything because vyn explicitly moved the conversation to what was going to happen in future seasons
yugioh does the proxy battler thing where girls are only allowed to look cool when it's not important right
I don't know, a climax where he wins doesn't really fit the quest for blind dumb revenge
boy do I think the strike freedom is dumb
it doesn't, because he deflects beams with the gold joints
Yes
It's the sensationalism that was lurking around geass r2 come full blown
Yes
The mc does not suffer any penalty from this; rather, the girl ends up falling for him
Action was okay but yeah, forced drama; theres something every episode but the most notorious is
CW: nonconsent ||there's a like 2 minute sequence where the mc rapes a girl on screen at the end of an episode||
Anyway valvrave abandons the idea of good writing for the concept of "what will make the audience gasp the most every episode"
I don't think I've seen worse
I've watched more boring shows
Beautiful mechanical designs, worst Mecha show I've ever watched
Valvrave
(the writer, not Yasuda)
And then he took it to the next level with his next work which was a hot trashfire
Felt like reading cheap paperbacks
I'm not going to say it was bad at all but gaudy and trashy are titles I think r2 deserved
Super heavy on cliffhangers and sensationalism
The second season was trashy even not counting fanservice
I'd also describe Geass as a revenge story
It can be toxic especially if it becomes full on revenge porn, but a revenge centerplot can be done well
(revenge fantasy is not fantasy genre, there seems to be some confusion here)
Gun x sword is a fun revenge fantasy adventure
<a:aHibikiDisgust:777598224625303593>
it had an 8 partially because of incels tbf
I'm glad it sucks so people never have to talk about it again
I love how the author deals with the fact he has really bad sameface by just making everyone clones
Arpeggio and Knights of Sidonia are the first two I remember seeing
No, I'm talking full cg anime
I really liked arpeggio, I just wish it wasn't made at the worst point of cg anime
This is like 4 different anime
Her piloting the Arhan without a body and the pedals moving was fucking cool though
Then she gets turned into a cube
Yes, for some reason
At least she is not a highschooler
A teenager who's actually like 26 is still a step forward, begrudgingly
So she cut her maturation time short
She wanted to drop before the other agents
But the story didn't have to do it
And the reason makes sense enough
She chose that herself
Still kills me the story found a reason to make her 16
Was one of my best units once she got the upgraded Arhan
She's in srw T
Angela
The last fight scene is the sickest shit
The cg isn't great but it's a movie so you can get through it
Another trashy but solid mecha that plays with high concept sci-fi is Expelled from Paradise
But that's like, episode 10 or 11
It's enjoyable, just it really found it's footing when it started abandoning attempts to be "realistic" and leaned into the Anime
But it really pops off with the movie
If you're not a tank nerd gup is a kind of mid cgdct anime that is somewhat novel but wastes a lot of that novelty on a really straightforward tournament arc
I would probably have died if I was into anime while Diebuster was trickling out
I mean that's how OVAs be
At least when it happened to gup they made two banger eps as a finale
*points to two unplanned recap episodes for a 1 cour show*
And actas is prone to fucking up production
I lost all interest in the girls und panzer project for the same reason, though if it's a serious question it's easier to budget and produce like this
I remember a few episodes really vividly; I don't think I've ever seen mecha do a "this isn't a fucking game kid" better than rewarding Renton looking like a badass with ||that shot of someone's arm dripping out of the cockpit||
The little kids saying papa <a:ShirabeSob:725756411312734228><a:KirikaSob:725756440463147048>
You've already watched the best e7 content
I do not like the spinoff film
God that arc hurts
SRW Z lets you save Charles and Rey though so it's a worthy version
AO is the kind of sequel that ruins it's predecessor by revealing everything went wrong
Holland and Gekkostate end up being basically the villains of pocketful of rainbows
They can look good and AO was interesting for a bit but they all have to make changes and ruin characters you love
Pretty much a different story
It's substantially different
The manga did that better
But that's fine
Mostly I think Dewey's plan at the end doesn't really hold together
Regarding e7
I feel one or two plot threads fall apart at the end but overall it's an experience, and it's one of the beat teenage romance stories I've seen
You can watch it for the three episodes they're around
(the movie was honestly a 85/100 but still)

I havent seen das finale but the tv show is exclusively ww2 and earlier and der film only adds on a few years to that
f

it fits.
my life is better whenever I'm not reminded it exists, but yes
best manga about robots, especially if you ever watched anything astro boy
it's worth reading
might be OP licensing issue

this halloween episode...
More like count dooky amirite
Ok but why is he hung
this is such a dumb concept for a character but I'm honestly surprised I haven't seen it more often
I kinda miss the stupid arenas from before duel discs
they made an HG based on this iirc
It's just fucking weird
But the content is wholesome
Everyone is just in spats and there's nonstop thigh shots
Same with vividred
This is the flashback of her young, too
yeah, end of march
it's pretty new, the second season only just wrapped up a few months ago
17-19
I think shinkalion was 17
Generally analogues have been based on niconico because as iski said youtube wasn't really a platform of choice in the past
she definitely says youtube, not niconico or anything
this isn't sub shenanigans either
from the very first episode one of the secondary cast members is an elementary school youtuber
it is shinkalion
Shout out to king gainer for having the entire cast plus the robots do the monkey in the op
I think about the immense homoerotic energy that the 00 ending with the haircut on the beach had sometimes
I once saw a site label zeta gundam with female protagonist and I www'd
it's solid
oh yeah that's true
I can't think of any with unique parts
they're just recolors with decals
this is true of every special edition gunpla ever



oh my fucking god youtuber girl wears *kitty stockings* I'm going to die
which is, of course, what trains do
it's exactly that, since I think the theme of the show is probably going to end up being connecting people together
main character ||killed a villain accidentally that they were coming to terms with understanding each other||
shinkalion
jesus fuck this kids show got dark
Shu is one of the best villains
I think I default to thinking of him in initial d
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
And not just "Dio's VA"
Takehito koyasu is the best and I miss when he was respected

it's in that small category of EDs better than OPs
rage your dream is one of my favorite anime EDs of all time, I actually had no idea how good I had it as one of my first anime lmao
like, it just lined up in my head
oh yeah I can hear it
I think the only other anime I know of that has such a weirdly star-studded cast is gravitation
shinichiro miki obviously
oh and
first stage had goddamn hiyama, fujikei, and koyasu
HOLY SHIT
HE WAS
also wasn't shingo fujikei
but you *can't do that*
but
the music isn't even bad
not the worst thing that has happened to ID (hello tokyopop) but it's... such a miss
respectfully, fuck the legend films
I probably will
I haven't seen it, mostly because I never finished fifth stage - fell off while airing due to how hard it was to track down
I like the rest but god that first season hits
First Stage was so goddamn good
Ryosuke Takahashi was, I think, my first experience with him in anime
they don't even change the OP or anything but you suddenly get an escalation or new scope
I will say for shinkalion you can still spot when you hit a new cour
that can be a little more complex in anime
for live action stuff it can be a lot easier to spot production 'blocks' that you can divide into seasons - episodes purchased in X year vs Y year due to cast changes and stuff
they still do that
just get into kids shows
that's why the western idea of 'season' doesn't *really* fit how anime used to be produced
but yeah, it just ran continuously for like 3 years
they'll skip a week here and there for various schedule reasons
but it's hard to really say there's a new season at any point because *they don't take broadcasting breaks*
but it can be clearly divided into like 4 different major plotlines because there's *literally 4 games* they cover
it's technically one single running production
Inazuma Eleven's a really strong example here
again, people don't really use seasons to refer to long-running anime for basically exactly this reason
*more or less*
the way the japanese anime industry has come to define a season is when they stop and restart production on a project, more or less
everything before it switches to shippuden can be considered a season
it's why anime fans of older shounens typically talk about cours or arcs rather than seasons
Naruto has like 400 episodes in season 1
'season' is generally a western idea
it is still season 1.
season 1 is 72 episodes long
It's not really weirder than Disney picking up power rangers if you think about it
yeah I can think of a few anime that do (planetes), but no other shounens
Asterisks for everyone
Just pry them off the nearest keyboards
Pretty dumb they have a war over asterisks
project mirai?
Is the special edition a re-air like they did for seed
lol hibike
8 was the only part of 'rx-78' visible
The idea was that the core fighter survived black history yeah
It's recovered and the Jupiter empire remnants use it to make a brain clone of amuro to pilot the amakusa
Except this is extra stupid outside of obvious reasons because UC already has a record of what happens to the learning computer
Yes
Where the MC finds an AI from a wreckage of a craft that is wink wink nudge nudge the rx-78-2's core fighter
Yeah astray pulled a pretty dumb plot point
It is kind of self wanky
We could have had this
Borjanons fighting moonrace daitarn 3
It would have fit really well outside of having to admit there's aliens
It's even got the "people dig up robots from a past civilization" vibe
Which is ironically the same basic story as ideon - that the universe can't stop killing itself
The final scene of the movie is everyone's souls soaring through the galaxy making amends and awaiting rebirth
And the entire alien faction population
It's implied before the final battle that everyone alive *not* a cast member is already dead
Yes
She starts out as an antagonist
Yeah definitely not innocent
Literally the only character deemed innocent by the end of the show was an unborn child
The point of the show was people who engage in war aren't blameless no matter what they fight for
Ran out of money on the tv show
Every single cast member, antagonist and protagonist, ended up dead
It is the single biggest reason tomino has the nickname "kill em all tomino"
Which they ran short on budget and time on
The ideon movie they made to replace the final few episodes
I will say the slaughter in ideon felt more pointed than IBO's though
70-80s tomino was something else
IBO was hilariously edgy but at least I don't recall them decapitating kids
Speaking of mass murder I rewatched be invoked recently
He's not but Id say especially post unicorn katoki is the definition of uc
Gaia gear also said "fuck katoki" and I respect that
It was written before cca, much less victory
This novel isn't canon though
150ish was victory
> Gaia Gear is a story set in the future of the Universal Century timeline, specifically in U.C. 0203. Once more, the governments of Earth and its space colonies are at odds and resolve their differences with Man-Machines. The resistance group Metatron fights against the Man Hunting Attachment police force of the corrupt Earth Federation. To have better chances Metatron creates a memory clone of the legendary Char Aznable called Afranche Char, who commands the troops of Metatron and pilots the Gaia Gear Alpha
A tomino novel about the far future of UC
But unicorn might have soured people on char clones because full frontal was incredibly lame
I'd also like them to take a crack at Gaia gear
Cypher you don't even know the fucking story
CDA seems like an easy goat to milk
They're desperate enough they're doing mediocre stuff like hf
I'm extremely surprised that sunrise hasn't done it yet
Honestly I feel the way to do more k-on is a movie or something about everyone slowly drifting away as they get older and then have a single reunion
Because authors know that ending a publication means they have to find a new paycheck
But I heard the source technically goes to college
It should be
Wonder if they're going to do k-on!!! next
Cima is terrible but amusing
We might as well insist we always include the rx-78
Like if we're going to be picky
Would you really go on rants when someone called the stamen the GP03?
This isn't really about what's canon, it's about how people would actually refer to something realistically where they don't want people to be confused
You don't use simpler numbers to describe more complex machines
Are you really this obtuse
And just gp03 can easily refer to the stamen
It's asinine as hell to insist you have to spell out dendrobium
I don't think there's anything wrong with calling it the gp03d
I just hope they really crank the angst
Visually
Zeorymer does what it does better
I like xi okay but like
Katoki designs now all look like they were on the same assembly block
He's a great designer but he's grown super self-referential
It's just contrary to literal 0079 lore baked in since day 1
I'm aware of the gp02'a justification
Zaku IIs could just use it as optional equipment
But it wasn't a special unit
Well not all
All of them
*if zakus were running around with nuclear bazookas in the battle of loum*
Why do you need this heavy ass Gundam with huge cooling racks
But let's get to the *real* dumb contradiction here
Which is reason number two it's dumb
The nuke launcher isn't a combat weapon
It is, I believe, the only major Gundam ever to not have a beam rifle
For one thing it's only armed with beam sabers and vulcans
It's probably the dumbest UC Gundam design
The 02 stresses me out so much
Aka it doesn't
Though it exists as much as delta Gundam exists
Yeah
But that's definitely asinine and unneeded
It's not the gp03, it's the rx-78gp03
No I mean the gp03
Which is better than most 0083 characters who are terrible and I want them to leave my screen
It's really sad when fucking seed has a better man-directed nuke delivery system than 0083
The gp02 in general
But it's easily one of the silliest designs in UC
Tbh I do prefer the mlrs over the a
The gp02 is big because that makes it a scary antagonist
Because with the horse you can give it better spin
The gp02 was so big so they could fit the horse inside
I understand now
Oh shit like in jojo
It caused way too much damage for being detonated out of atmosphere
0083 also has the problem of the nuke being impossibly strong but eh
Most were ex fighter pilots
So 4 years after loum, the federation's r&d division full of ex zekes couldn't match literally one of the first suits deployed into combat
Movable frame
Aya I have a model kit lore sheet that talks about the Gundam mk 2's morbavul flame
Engrish
*nuclear mobile suits aren't fucking hard*
https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/MS-06C_Zaku_II_Early_Production_Type
shorter than 13 episodes?
Are you gonna do delta
Again, the zeorymer does what xi does better to me
It's just too much white
I do wish it still has the blue chest
Yeah that's p bad
I can't find it but there was a gff a decade ago that just was *wrong*
Katoki zeta Gundam redesigns are cursed
but the plot is much less well constructed
the original FMA run had a better idea for homunculi than the manga
anime original ending is generally the best path to go unless you're mega successful and can guarantee future seasons
orichalcos? that's filler.
I don't think any quite lasted a year but like
yugioh had some similar stretches
There are three approaches for adapting unfinished content
except one piece which just keeps going
they just break them into seasons to avoid the problem these days
yes, like every shounen anime
even if it doesn't tie into a plot
episodic content isn't pointless
original shows can't have filler
like there's so much garbage out there that the only plot episodes are the first two and last two that I just don't understand this complaint applied to angel beats
I think you've just been broken by modern anime/tv shows where every episode has to be part of a huge arc
Yeah it was cut down from 24
mato is just as impossible to dislike as I remember though
it's simultaneously very good and lacking
it's definitely got some depth and there's a lot to think about, but it feels like the show itself can't quite grasp the ideas it's poking
still a difficult show to fully contain my thoughts on it
I rewatched Black rock shooter TV
the goofy robot sidekick hasn't shown up for two episodes - probably VA scheduling issues or something - and the robot is now mad about it
this is why spaghetti is different. i guess.
noodles are like shinkansens

kimono miku.....
The show is well made but she's a bitch
Haruhi was one of my most hated anime characters for like a decade
U are the old
Loris you recognize it so
Endless eight

The worst berserk article
I've found it
Ah
after all, the show is called Shinkalion the Animation
it just made too much sense
I was pretty sure that was the case, yeah
it's in that grey zone between genres
they move like them but things are always solved by a flashy super attack
I'd hesitate to call shinkalion real
I can't confirm this though
I do think Shinkalion designs might have existed before the show though, as JR promotional things
can't find anything else they worked on
Hattori Keita, apparently

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcU8JHV6Aow
GLT also has the grandslam of having a season-best OP *and* season-best ED
<:chi_dab:388832384558170112> <:yuu_dab:388832383350341632>
it is very good
<:NotLikePapika:284132078054932480>
...
Only manga series I own
Did uzumaki come out
Oh he was the dumbass
Oh?
the second one is 8.
so shinkalion s1's first arc/saga is like 64 episodes
I have no idea but they want to be deep sea fishermen
you walked into this one
because he'd be a bad identical twin if he didn't have the same features as his brother
because he'd be a bad identical twin if he didn't have the same features as his brother

kids shows be wildin
this is heavy fucking shit to drop on 8 year olds
They're just going to panty and stocking everyone

jesus fucking christ shinkalion just referenced rooftop suicides what the fuck
MJP movie 2
which is where the characters spend most of their time because it's the location of the secret train robot base
it's a railroad museum
this isn't a school
it was not

I was convinced it was a misunderstanding
nope one season to sell the books that's what you get
that's a joke on fenny I have no investment in any part of the LN industry
damn I really need to finish billy bat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWcyu1Mds0g
wait there's a better one
I never had a deep emotional connection to it so I never gave it much thought
Huh
I'm sometimes out of touch with what other people think and this might be one of those times
Like I like bugs life more
Is toy story 2 highly rated? I generally thought it was average as Pixar movies go
This movie exists because of money and not passion
I've seen that concept mentioned in 3 different reviews
They all boil down to some variation of "I didn't feel the need to leave the theater but it was empty calories I'm going to forget existed in 4 weeks"
Man critics are super not impressed with lightyear
I preferred SDF's relative hardness or 7's super robot song energy bs, they both felt more emotionally appealing
I just couldn't get into delta, between the idol group focus and the really weird science-magic shit
while I love eurobeat I do not feel this elevates the mashup
I'd say 'imagine if pluto comes out first' but that would be me making a joke
must be hoping to merchandise the shit out of it
damn four cours?
I mean maybe he watched it eventually but they got far enough into it to start blocking out combat when someone asked him why doan wasn't using the zaku's bare hands and yasuhiko was like "that's dumb zakus can't fight like that" and that's when they found out
he never saw kukuruz doan's island
what the fuck
...yasuhiko *never actually watched the fucking episode* he turned into a feature length film
so this is a good choice
I was going to recommend shirobako but there's actually a significant reason to watch eva before that
it all comes tumbling down
it's pretty good too, though they couldn't afford to do the back half of the show
gaogaigar got a dub when it was 20 years old
but I have also skipped basically all of the gunpla spinoff anime
I'm honestly not very up to date on the new generation of designers, the newest I recognize is like, Yanase
Hi I used to read 50s and 60s trashy pulp sf novels and yeah they had beam swords and laser wire swords and all sorts of nonsense
There's better - you can't beat fudou from Aquarion - but he's solid
I also think the base commander izumi is above average in terms of this kind of thing
lmao
though I think you're right in that the Nevada-tan incident was that same year
The week they were going to air the episode where the anime girl kills people, a student in japan killed her dad or something with an axe
man the context of nice boat is so wild

no but there's horrible soot coming out of it
iirc
yeah they don't fully fix the flight drive for a dozen or so eps
turn a started out as a broken piece of shit
zz is probably the worst offender
zz literally doesn't get fucking touched until the final fight
strike ran out of power a lot, idk if that counts
barbatos is pretty up there
though the only difference is stuff like sensors
Meaning the MC did not actually have the best machine on the hero's side of the field for a while
Actually the cannon fodder had the V-fins, the Hexa was Oliver only as a commander unit
they work their way through a fair amount of top and leg flyers
anyway the most damaged protagonist gundam is probably victory
and not IBO 2
I'm hoping it's light hearted
kiiiiiingu kiiiiiiiingu kingu gainaaaaaaa
so I'm betting there's a s2 written but they're struggling to get it bankrolled
like he had it planned but he didn't realize he was on a 2 cour show instead of a 4 cour until episode 20
it's solid but the end plot feels a bit random
not a lot of death though, this is in the phase of happy tomino
that's overman king gainer
he actually wrote this one
> like a road trip with people dying than actually fighting a war
Jaburo, Odessa, and Solomon all have specific objectives to cripple the relevant side
OYW definitely has strategy moments
~~and never finished the show~~
I haven't seen the movies though
the major problem is you have to rewind episodes a few times to understand them
oh that's not the major problem with it
The bad editing and composition? I don't really agree
HF just doesn't actually have anything important happen in it
it's the only thing with any poignancy in the damn story lol
I want the scene in the movies too
||The wiki claims otherwise?||
||Yes he signs the order for Mafty, not knowing who he is||
making the serial number of RX-93ŒΩ2 really fucking weird
....did beltorchika's children ever talk about what happened to the original nu design? I think the nu just doesn't exist in that timeline
he's so locked into the katoki proportions
definitely something he could never make today
V1 is one of katoki's better hero designs though
I liked it enough but don't see myself rewatching it
ah, right, Marbet swaps her hexa's head back to the original to honor Oliver because he spent a good chunk of the show in a Victory
I swear Oliver even mentions the differences of the hexa in show at one point but I've only gone through Victory once and that was like ten years ago so I'm not going to insist on that
I've been reading the same blurb about the hexa since the early 2000s
what unit the shrike commander decides to use does not reflect on the design of the unit
It's designed as the commander unit - the wiki is *not* the only place I've seen this
it's the commander unit
> The Victory Gundam Hexa is the Victory Gundam with a new model of Core Fighter that features a modified mobile suit head for use by squadron leaders,

I'm pretty sure he was in a hexa for a bit but it has been a while
Red 1, purple 4, wing 0
This is kinda cool
I guess v2 was in okay condition
God Gundam is like the only protagonist unit I can think of that doesn't
I don't think the G-bull conveyed that it was a military weapon lol
Also one of those few few shows that has a banger for both op and ed
GLT is so good and I kinda hope someday they'll give us a finale movie so I can dehydrate via tears
<:chi_dab:388832384558170112> <:yuu_dab:388832383350341632>
Blue with gold canopy also pops super sexy
It's okaaaay
Century zero in general just doesn't do it for me
Blue
Not blade liger because they're pussies with lame taste
Yeah
it has its OWN gn drive
The handheld GN Bazooka is an improved version of the one used by the GN-005 Gundam Virtue, and has its own onboard GN Drive Tau.
wait wait wait it's even cooler
it's the ground combat version because they were like "HM THE RAPHAEL KEEPS FUCKING FALLING OVER ON EARTH"
wow I like this version of the raphael a lot more
the shirabe school of weapon placement
"we want to make the nu but we can't so let's do something dumb"
naked it's fine but the weapon layout was like
I really don't like the qant in general
didn't qant have one drive in the back and the other on the shield
I thought one of 00's drives was destroyed with ribbons
they had to have similar outputs or some shit
00's twin drive wouldn't work with any two GN drives iirc
two year round trip to jupiter that might not even work
it's way too bespoke
It wasn't a true twin drive system but you can't mass produce the 00's synchronized twin drive system
armor, or electronics, or even just a fucking chair to sit in
like, there's always something left out because they know they're not getting deployed
they shouldn't really be combat ready like this generally
even so
that's why the gundams are always so much more powerful than the GMs or Strike Daggers or what have you
it almost never does
this is not a prototype for a car, this is a prototype for a one-off racing vehicle
yeah, and if that technology ends up being effective, it goes on the main car
I really can't comment more on this though because I don't know shit about racing so I have no real knowledge and not a lot of interest what you're implying about them being 'pretty friggin powerful'
the biggest is that there is no real 'production' version
that's different for a lot of reasons
stuff like the RX-78 is already kinda dumb but the tallgeese is just ridiculous
"oops we accidentally made a high performance unit, we'll make it shittier next time"
and the robot is just *too strong*
I just don't believe engineers could ever sit down and make the first space robot ever and then be surprised the g forces are too much
maybe I'm just mad about the fact gundam doesn't understand what the fuck a prototype is
I don't think anything else is quite as bad as the tallgeese
though
I just realized wing used that stupid fucking cliche of "the first one we made was *too powerful*" twice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGqOWtWByq4
yeah
actually more entertainment in these than watching destiny
anyway I accidentally stumbled on the seed character theaters again
she finds weddings distasteful and that's an adorable character quirk c:
SEED was full of melodrama and really washy pathos and pacifism
neither
at least, from what I can see
it felt like a pretty direct followup to SEED honestly
I can't believe AGE *wasn't* light hearted
I guess the last generation was the edgelord generation
but I'm still holding out hope it's light hearted
I think that's pretty likely if this is IBO 2, which I hope it isn't but think there's good chances it is
sapphire's likely worried they'll be treated like garbage because that's what happens to girls
lmao. the armor is actually a seravee-type drone
Another time diver is a song they invented for cobray in alpha 3
Do you mean time diver
Viletta is woman the cool spy
That's cobray
Oh well
I was so hoping for r-gun powered for the final 30 dlc
It's either a flimsy super or a shitty real
Yes
The firepower of supers are really useful in early og1
Like masaki who never gets a rank lol
And sometimes they just work with you
There's still super robots but they're deployed into your divisions or whatever
Not attached to anime
There's also the OG games that let you just be ground pounders
I don't think so but it could be possible
So that seems like not the whole story
Other than the most recent
And the game wasn't released in the west
It's not really clear why
Macross hasn't been in srw for a decade though
I really do think Quanta is supposed to be the 00 version of the nu
because the ultimate goal of most gundam series is to mimic older ones and cca is a gold standard
though the ZAKU is close I guess
strike freedom might be the ugliest non aquatic CE suit for me
PA works doesn't usually do dark do they
That's heated drama
Damn
I'm not really all that certain of my reasoning but I do think the counterargument doesn't ring true
Yeah but they don't want "more profit than someone else" they want "as much profit as possible"
They probably don't want to lose traffic to rt
Older models were not good folded
Oh some of these more recent ones angle them to be less bad ok
They get worse
I find the wings actually get squarer in real plamo blockio
Also ew wings
Idk he's in the sloped part and the cannon is like, *right there* below
Unless it's somehow squished into the waist behind the barrel of the battleship class cannon
Not having room for the goddamn reactor
And of course strike freedom has the design problem of
A fairly irritating reward for giving him the protagonist hat after shinn outplays him
In destiny he just mostly has a better machine than others
He's ~~not a newtype~~ doesn't have "enhanced spatial awareness"
No he can't use dragoons
Giant rectangular block
Also the strike freedom's wings are ugly as fuck when folded
Super dragoon system is just a mistake
I agree somewhat but I feel computer controlled bits that can disable everyone for him takes a lot of the hero out of the hero unit
It's possible they invented something for the movie but I don't think it originally did
I don't remember xi having defensive tech
I mean you're not wrong, the only gundams I think are better defensively are V2 assault and S Gundam Plan 303E
F91 is actually one of the strongest UC Gundams defensively purely out of virtue of having a beam shield
Armor stopped being relevant in zeta
Even in f91
There is no actual lore behind why smaller suits are better other than "eh just trust us"
Bandai needed to save like 30% on plastic to keep the models profitable
It's smaller for the same reason f91 was smaller
That giant repair ship in 0083 appears in victory under new owners
Anaheim gets it's shit punched in by the fact the tiny SNRI suits are way better yeah
And be around under a new shell
In reality they would have rebranded
Because it's fiction
For most of the unicorn book they were trying to paint him as an oldtype
Coincidence
Why are there not oldtype funnel suits
If a computer with psycoframe can manipulate funnels why are we only using this tech to rip them away
NT-D has never really made sense
X astray is the last story that's kinda ok
The dragoons had phase shit
Later known as the x astray
No it's the dreadnought
I think maybe even two
There's a seed suit with anti-anti funnel tech
Destiny already has ciws
Replace the palm gun with a palm blade emitter
Idk what's worse, the fact they thought a beam gun that had like 10m range was a good idea, or the fact they didn't just put in a fucking saber
But üôç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
And I will refrain from tearing into the shining finger attack
Like it's a more modern perfect strike
The color coding just makes it look so toyish
I remember being surprised that destiny Gundam itself was the final form
Like most of destiny suits
Sf's giant vanes of light are just flashy and showy and make little sense
Also I really miss the little red particles coming from the wings
Still the freedom did the vane folding about ten thousand times better
Or they fry from minovsky fields
Like, they have to be
It is worth mentioning every single unit in the Gundam UC setting is hardened against em fields
Especially since UC apparently believes nukes are anti-fleet weapons

It was the testbed before it got put on the v2
F99 looks like a crossbone with less pirate and with wings of light
I have no idea what the first formula suit is
But they got renamed to hide the fact that SNRI was helping
The crossbones are actually f97s
They exist
Well two if you count the f99
If UC switches to liquid cockpits things might get insane, there's, iirc, 3 suits that can do 10g and one that can do 20
Even if they were very much magic
I rather liked the neutron jammers as a plot element
Though honestly
CE intentionally left it on the table so they could have the nuke scene late in seed
How else are you going to have dramatic naval battles
UC wanted it off the table in both strategic and tactical matters
Same combat idea
Sure whatever
Knocking cruise missiles out of combat
Interference was invented for UC for one reason
The major limitation is that the UC universe is built on 70s tech brought 150 years forward
Cameras are also the primary sensor on the battlefield
They do use laser comms but apparently fields can ablate
Certainly better than plavsky particles
But at least they're mostly consistent
They are *extremely* scientifically convinient when you look at the setting under a microscope
That and being a fusion catalyst
The fact they mimic super strong magnetic fields is what makes UC's cold fusion work in the first place
As a result you get a similar effect of a very hypercharged field with far less energy
These lattices are somewhat naturally forming, to the point they're what causes the radio problems in a particle blasted field
Theyre built around minovsky particles making magic lattices with the right charge
I Fields are not magnetic
Once again
It's not
https://youtu.be/QQgOzDTwgYY
The beams would eat the weapons from the inside out otherwise
As does every beam saber
Every gun produces internal I fields btw
It is just a generator though
Not magnetic but it's complicated
That's pretty dumb!
And he played the piano
But he was only 15
Too easy to assassinate key people and begs the question of "why didn't you just stealth"
I'm convinced Nicol got killed first because the blitz Gundam had too many problematic story implications
Really saps a lot of good storytelling out
If it works it's too good
I think the third class of combat would be stealth mines
That's why Macross uses not-nukes
Yeah they're still useful on direct impact
It'd probably fuck with sensors
They're all hardened to deal with minovsky conditions
Not a Gundam fleet
The X-rays are maybe the most useful thing at range but the fleet is going to be radiation sealed anyway
we call it the interplanetary and interstellar medium because it's not empty
I mean there is a shockwave it's just shit
The shockwave dissipates far too quickly to be useful in anti-fleet so all you have is the fireball and x-rays
In space?
(another anti-missile setting quirk)
Why interact with people when there are unwatched cartoons
30 is only 8.5 thousand minutes with my rough napkin math

Are these 57 completed shows
57....
amazing
the ending already happened
the point of the story is
well
but overall GLT is one of the few times I'm okay with the ending being weak because
GLT does really need a final movie to cap the story off
which I *do* think highly of
It's just absolutely terrible pacing to really dive into it for a lot of stuff - that's a big flaw FSN adaptations have, for example, trying to explore Shirou's thoughts mixed in with these big fight scenes - unless the work has a really unique pacing in the first place, like Girls Last Tour
I'm not ruling out the potential of a good adaptation but I am more interested from the outset for something designed by animation studio veterans rather than an adaptation
This is exactly the inverse for animation
Novels really excel at exploring stuff like character headspace and suckass at stuff like action
I mean, that's another point
considering the low cost of entry for content like WNs and LNs, there's a lot of stuff that gets generated that can be considered low on the creativity scale
though
for the record, my problem is entirely the latter
these are not the same claim
I think y'all are misunderstanding "I assume adaptations are going to be a waste of my time" to mean "I assume all originals are worth watching"
aren't they going to fucking mars or something next
I mean
To me I'll generally weight about half of a story's grade on whether it sticks a landing on the ending or not
no problem to people who like them, just, not for me
Lack of endings are why I generally don't bother with adaptations, yeah
meaning by very nature of getting adapted, they *don't* have an ending
most of the time they're only bankrolled by the book publisher in order to sell future copies of the manga/LN
that's fair though it's also the very rare case of adapting a concluded project
save ilya
different direction targets the groups differently
the current viewers or the viewers of the future
but I guess it's always a question of who are you making anime for
this may be better than trying to engineer a mid climax
if you know you're absolutely going to get another season
honestly
~~why adapt it, there's no more manga to sell~~
that bad?
it can't decide whether it's an ||epilogue or a comeback story||
ippo was really good until the last few years where I really don't know what the fuck is the narrative direction of this arc
<:NononSmug:651876302412054548>
other than this is now one of the least interesting serenas
I don't see why that makes a difference
she took too much energy from all other serenas
playing tennis
overload would definitely be by far the more common use
elevate the work.
again
fans can't yell at you that it sucks if it's exactly the same, they'll just quietly not be sure why it was disappointing
but shounen fans are used to sucking up roughly chopped up garbage at this point so they cope
It can be particularly rough for stuff like shounens where the pacing format is dictated by weekly/monthly chapter releases
who will just make his fanfiction an anime if it takes him 8 years to do it ~~and make it worse~~
small exception if you're in the exclusive category of being 'batshit insane' like mamoru nagano
and it doesn't change the fact that the adaptation *should* try to elevate it.
that doesn't stop the anime from being better than the source
Going to be blunt here
They may have influence, but it's not something 'the author' can make
The author is never the one making the anime
The author isn't the one making the anime
If you're going to adapt something you should look to elevate it.
It *should* be better than the original or it's just advertising
you *can't* 1:1 adapt something that focuses on someone's thoughts
For another example, Fate novel routes
they're both quite good but the embellishments the anime takes are quite inspired
If you want to do a case study, read planetes and watch the anime, or vice versa
There's always room for tweaking
I don't even agree that the story 'should be' 1:1
I feel 1:1 will actively interfere with "well animated" if direction and storyboarding is part of animation
it's not just following plotbeats, it's trying to mimic pacing and even manga panels, yeah
No, but I think there's some misunderstanding what a 1:1 is
<:Thinkki2:514552069550637066>
oh wait, better than original
if it's 1:1
1:1 adaptation can't be better
1:1 adaptations...
WEP's memorable at least
I dunno
is that their madoka number font
which means raidou may be indirectly breathing my air (just kidding, the air never leaves the LA valley, that's why it fucking sucks there)
I think so and more importantly they said LA
<:NononSmug:651876302412054548>
https://twitter.com/AnimeExpo/status/1534641438465613826
I know why
biggest anime convention in the US
AX
just the future direction of macross
but I guess the marketing is probably out of kawamori's hands
macross II is kinda wild
those are just normal ones with subtitles
neat
after seeing those scenes from the anime I don't want to think about them with each other
ok but its better than everyone wanting the 11 year old girls
no panty and stocking is such a meme because it's *ridiculously* unfinished where it leaves off
link pls
unholy demon

It would be the best animated srw content if latooni didn't get captured
OG OVA
WOAH
this is the trigger show right
they just stole this from his dark materials
man
the anime cut the familiars because it realized the important part of the arrangement was catering to furry enthusiasts
how do they lose their magic? growing up?
[anime ends]
"no"
~~finally, a srw without mazinger~~
try to find series that don't involve earth so you can actually just make earth fucked
well after pride month comes shame month
like SRW will do it anyway, I'll just be annoyed I can't bench whatever protagonist they use
also TSFs have all these "reasons" for being designed the way they are and yet there'll be tons of other robots that break every rule kicking even more ass than them
if earth's not absolutely screwed you've lost most of the feeling
I think it makes less
muvluv doesn't really fit in crossovers
I'd rather muvluv never get added but I suppose something like TE is a matter of time
sidonia cg ran at like 12 fps I hated it
It's a little crazy for trigger to be going off but there's some announcements generally
or 10 or 15
aren't we still at like 5 isekais per season
how is that possible
they try to keep the 'fanfiction' quotient down and keep it to background details while they try to mimic anime events
because SRW is uncreative like that
you have to still do the series plots
do that
the problem is you can't just
it's such a lazy trick
they've overused it in the 15 years since Z
no plot of SRW should involve crossing dimensions anymore unless that is part of the original anime, like orguss
in the context of the time it's serviceable though
I don't recall s1 aging particularly well
negima!! and negima?! are two different AUs iirc
negima is a property that varies which entry and universe it is based on the number and order of punctuation marks
the N700A is better because it has a rocket fist
I hope I have dispelled the sleepless night y'all were going to have over this
I know everyone here was super invested on whether they were N700s or N700As but it's almost certainly the N700A subtype, especially on the nozomi service
ok I did some research and by 2019 the entire N700 fleet was converted to the N700A mod
I think either the N700 or the N700A
that's one of the 700s
it is in fact one of the trains
unrealistic character gimmicks in romcoms don't tend to work
shikimori just kinda screamed bad unrealistic gimmick
I'd say Destiny Impulse but honestly that's... already a suit...
some of those are sidestories
uhhh I'm pretty sure I'd count the 30 billion gunpla spinoffs
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
oh you mention that at the end
well, ONA
aside from stargazer
there's an astray OVA
already
regarding non-UC gundam movies, SEED also had theatrical releases
well, it was designed to be a new UC
hatsune miku has a recurring role as one of the teammates in shinkalion and I always feel like I'm not living in reality when everyone talks with her and she replies with her synthesized voice and no one ever comments on it
"the standard villainess story"
Yuta and friends along with Akane were just so much better a cast, even if dynazenon stepped up the wacky bullshit
aside from what feels to me to be the obvious exception
just, none of them stuck with me
like they're fine
I wish I liked the cast of dynazenon
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
Aya got onioned
Tings is a dumb idol name and I refuse to root for them
At least max becomes more of an ace by reusing that
Max blows up the same 3 grunts like 15 times
4 fight scenes, period
Not only are there a few clipshows but you may have also noticed that there's like
"oh no! I better get on my magic space bicycle!"
Its just as good in the robotech dub
The dream sequence was 10/10 though
Macross is notoriously low budget even for the time
The like 1200 anime fans out there aren't enough of a market to splurge on
It's cheaper to just hold auditions
Why try to track down actors with commitments and try to negotiate
That's what the early 00s were like
good news you don't even have to be reincarnated
please don't be like this
not there
the movie was just
also the soundtrack is 50% of what made initial d so good
I doubt it'll be like initial d but maybe it'll be like cyberformula
I don't think the episode has been out for 24 hours can you use the spoiler channel for spoilers
: )
There's also waifus
Rather than anime
I think it's likely the studio will mostly do game cutscenes, ads, and stuff like scenes for the theme park
oh no new game my interest has been lost
but shinkalion is some good fun
GGG is still better
ngl the core 4 antagonists from shinkalion are the best part of the show
fucking genbu man
there's some real fanfic-level treat for characters that are impossible to not like
the movie is probably insane even without the series but
I wouldn't skip the series to watch the movie
I will say
actually the series showed the transformations more than it should have
man the movie was so rushed they actually skipped almost every transformation
and it's absolutely amazing
the pacing is absolutely ridiculously hyperpaced and the plot doesn't make any sense
in 7 minutes there was a hatsune miku concert, godzilla, and shinji ikari
it is so absolutely fucking insane
the shinkalion movie is the worst anime movie I've seen and I'm rating it 10/10
there wasn't much more than that in love hina
there is zero question who the protagonist is into and who he wants
no one thinks love hina isn't a harem
plenty of harem anime have the result predecided
I wish shin mazinger's god scrander looked better
yeah I'll get to that soonish
Idk I'm sure it would have shined if it had the time it needed
The protagonist crew is fine, it's mostly everyone else that kinda doesn't do the setting justice
I wish the characters were up to it
It's a good setting
https://youtu.be/qcNhg05c4fQ
You forgot one
Frontier's music wasn't bad but it was for the most part just more late 00s jpop
Macross 7 easily has the best soundtrack imo
The knife fight is pretty bad even for the time
Man I have spent a long time watching 70s and 80s anime
The knife fight is infamous
OG
I knew them a few decades longer
Not that the plot sucks its just
I was more invested in max and Miria in 7 than in the main plot tbh
Probably why they brought Gundam x back for srw z
Demand does not mean people posting online "I wish this existed"
it's just an idiom
and that's completely unnecessary unless the next line is a pun about breakfast
simulcast just means it's being uploaded to streaming sites at the same time it's airing on TV
oh
what?
"Now that's what I call easy" works just fucking fine
everything that had TL notes is generally re-done for crunchyroll at this point
and yes lily you are small child
FUCKING tv nihon, absolute worst
it's not TV Nihon shit
needed
SZS it's
SZS, or "we're going to sub in 300 TL notes you still don't have enough grounding in japanese culture to understand"
studio that did madoka
no it's called shaft
yeah like a lot of shaft works it's surprisingly high intellect even while being.... I don't really have a word for it
not really, toothbrush aside
yeah it's artsy trash
as much as I miss the era of fansubbers I can't really say I miss gg or commie
I definitely think misaka is pretty cool but her setting is just dumb
it's code geass

but that subtitle was intended as a shitpost
this may surprise you
I like her, but she's unquestionably a tsundere designed to be well liked
misaka is definitely the waifu of that franchise
gg was very 4chan humor
it actually was pretty rude yeah
There's a release where they called the viewer a bunch of bad names, but only if you watched it on VLC
it's gg
because that's what I think of when I think of hatsune miku
no she does kendo
guess what hatsune miku's hobby is in shinkalion
shinkalion H5 is a good robot too
it's a good clip
what's a dashie
why would you do this to my boy
he's basically a social antagonist
because you're not supposed to like him
was the character you found frustrating kaifun
Thinking about the shinkalion movie
(I think JAM Project is significantly less relevant than him doing basically all of Go Nagai's stuff)
like, some of the first ever anime
jam project aside, he sang a bunch of really important anime OPs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbHilpaHkbs He's really good at songs that just kind of explode into a main melody (Also another example of using that OP melody as a leitmotif)
and of course OPs are different (though I feel like tanaka kouhei may have composed yuusha-oh tanjou? he certainly leaned hard enough into the leitmotif for show pieces)
I'm sure he's not the only guy but he has quite a few recurring credits for one piece
so maybe there's a chance
ok but one piece's music is same dude as gaogaigar
basically every twitter accounts that "are raw" sucks imo
It would hurt less if I was wrong
learn to draw anime/manga books
absolutely could see it coming on immediately after jackie chan adventures
early 00s fox kids cartoon
I was trying to figure out what vibe that plot blurb was giving me
I miss when Gundam was niche enough I only engaged with the fan base when I was properly fortified
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_armour
Phase shift is a real technology
It is weirder than phase shift
Granted nanolaminate armor is plot magic bullshit in the first place to be "not your *grandpa's* Gundam" but you can't just go "but beam Magnum"
If nanolaminate armor didn't hold up against decent beam weapons, IBO's setting would have had those weapons
The "UC Gundams would destroy nanolaminate" stuff is so fucking funny
It's a volatile mix between facism-is-cool, edgy-means-mature, faux-milsim, weird territorial issues over subfranchises, and a sprinkling of toxic positivity where you should feel bad for not liking all of them
Yes

I mean they did do that
It's not *not* a Gundam except when bandai wants to sue themselves to stop using it
I love that the more modern redraw of it is by katoki and really sells the gundamness of it
My favorite gundam
I would like gundams more if they had visors
~~which I also don't like but I don't have to~~
I'm honestly really not a fan of barbatos myself but it serves IBO's purpose
You are a self parody my friend
Damn dude I didn't think you were talking about yourself
This has been a concept in Gundam since zeta
I've long since learned Gundam is a soap opera with toy soldiers rather than something to take analytically
Weak points in armor are a writing mechanism in gundam, not a mechanical one
As much as anywhere else
Anyway e7 isn't perfect but it's really good and is probably my favorite teen romance story in anime
The most famous thing about xam'd is it first aired on the ps3
"what's xam'd?" *Exactly*
They also did like, xam'd
Noteably, e7
Bones make a Mecha that lands the ending challenge (only succeeded once)
Oh captain earth
Knight of gold is a little overkill
I really like it
Schpeltor is a clean design
Gothic made is ü§¢
FSS is ok
Ikaruga is in the same game, amusingly enough
I can see it
The th in 30th stands for technical highflier
(huckebein always has this cannon, just normally it's fired from a battleship instead of carried)
The back cannon is not fired from the back but detaches to be handheld
This is the 30th
Thats the og
30th is the upgrade
Yeah
Lovagex said 30th which does not have them
Probably OG or 008 for me
I feel it's slightly better in GBA but it's quite good
Wildraubtier
Very close
A lot of contenders but I'll throw out my oldest srw love
Its a windam
Exbein Ashe fucks though
And the EX exbein is maybe the worst looking OG unit of all time
I think the exbein is bland and kinda ugly even if I like the visor
They're clearly comfortable with it at this point
For all of these events the acquisition of banpresto by bandai namco had already happened years ago
So lawsuits are unclear but it's fact that the anime adaptation of og2 that obari directed replaced the huckebein mk 3 with the "exbein" with the huckebein never being directly mentioned. The next OG game on ps3 had an event early on where the hangar with every huckebein unit in it was blown to scrap and the pieces were used to build the huckebein ashe. The huckebein would be completely absent from srw as a franchise until 2017 where it showed up as a guest unit in srw v
Yeah
And if you want weird trivia it's sung by an american mormon
God tier op
Sousei no Aquarion (the op) is one of the absolute best of the 00s and is a certified yoko kanno banger
Also someone mentioned the op once
10/10 super robot attack
Anyway Aquarion is worth watching if only for the first episode they break out Mugen punch
They simulate reality being false by having everything drawn like they were badly corrected tween frames
Aquarion also has maybe the greatest budget dive episode ever
Aquarion is evangelion inspired but is mostly just kawamori unbottling the absolute nonsense he can't fit in macross
And a considerable amount of armored core, including white glint
No, same person who did 95% of macross
The first series has lower highs but higher lows
Like Evol goes from an 11/10 at the halfway point to 6 at the end
Aquarion was fun and Aquarion Evol is one of if not the best super robot shows of all time... Attached to an absolute disaster of a second half
It is the best getter robo don't @ me
Aquarion's designs go harder than they should
Kawamori made Aquarion fucking gerwalk
I was trying to find my favorite 6 legged Mecha (it's a form of Aquarion that shows up for 20 seconds) and I forgot
Yeah
I vibe with it
My favorite spider mech is that dumb thing from the climax of wild wild west
I'll be real though
They're fucking adorable
I would date a tachikoma
Because it looks like this
You do not want to pick granteed in J
No because bellzelute is cuter
Meanwhile mazinkaiser is going to kill the entire enemy fleet and take 10 damage each time
If they do not attack you you are like 1/8th as powerful as you should be
You get up to n counter attacks a turn, where n is enemy units
You get one attack a turn
It is terrible at killing grunts
Except it means if a unit is good at dodging
The enemy AI is smart enough to not attack if they have 0% chance to hit, even if it means passing the turn without attacking
J
But 100% blows
99% evasion is fine
There is one srw where having 100% evasion fucking sucks and tanking hits is vastly superior
So evasion decay is the dodge version of chip damage that tanks take
In super robot wars some stuff like big o is supposed to take it on the chin
In Gundam, every unit is supposed to dodge
This is mostly a good thing
Evasion decay has been part of the franchise for about 20 years now, where the more you're attacked in a single turn, the bigger the penalty you're fighting
Evasion is powerful in srw but there's complicating factors
And it's too much reward for a snowball unit
I'm not a fan of the tension mechanic, it's a sloppy way to do it
So it's ok if they outrange you for a turn
SRW doesn't super penalize you for getting hit like g gen does
G gen overvalues not getting hit and one-hit killing
In newer ones you end up with a unit that can cross the whole map and shoot 9 tiles away
Attack range is relevant but there are ways to get around that
<:sobeline:949855729119023144>
Eldora soul
If that
Modern games in a nutshell
"is a unit good?" "Idk is it a protagonist?" "Yes" "then it's good"
We need this kind of shit in modern srw
They weren't particularly good against air
But also xabungle units just aren't very good and *I miss that*
Walker Gallia is fine and has a decent ALL when upgraded
Yeah
They do fucking coyote time when they miss an air attack
(xabungle animations in z1 may be the franchise's best, they're all incredibly hilarious, especially the enemy units)
And xabungle as a series got gutted
And z2 was the start of "uh you don't get your friends but here have a summon attack"
And I think some attacks don't look as good
The mechanics are worse
Z really was the apex
Yeah it was good for all 3 attacks it had
Gaogaigar in T is everything wrong with the new semi-accurate style
God I miss when srw was actually SD
Yeah looks fine
Nu looks fine?
With the wings
They made it worse in z2
I thought it was good
There are no bad animations in z1
But it probably wasn't possible with the game engine
The z1 version of Aquarion in general was one mechanic away from being absolute perfection
I love godmars even if I refuse to deploy him in D because he will lose you the game every time
its called beam confuse because it is confusing why they put it in ANT
BEAM CONFUSE
it looked so much better when everything looked like videogame sprites
moving to HD was a mistake for srw
but why does the background jerk?????
I'm okay with the animation
z3 was animated in fucking adobe flash
every time???
skips??
where the background just
at least it's not the 30's beam saber attack
that said
I like roche saber but I know what you mean
he used to be rounder
but it might have been katoki too
the OG huckebein may have been someone else though
I can't imagine there being a problem
The Huckebein as used in OGs was a katoki design
30's eye flick sold the nu to me tbh
I do not want 8-12 fps animations in my videogame
fancier, but worse
yeah arios animator gets a lot of hype but I feel he's mostly making the game look worse
I like how a portable only exists to reuse MX and OGs sprites
Not that it's bad but this doesn't feel like it's trying too hard
This remix is better than ogmd
A has like 4 bangers, J has like 8
J might outdo A actually - J has quantity over A's quality
J is only matched by A for music
https://youtu.be/Px6dmEmfRJs
Every other unit looks clean
It's just a hot mess on gba
other than cross omega because fuck phones
literally 15 years and 5 months since SEED has been in a srw
it has been uhhh
~~but that is like, all of hathaway's flash~~
holy fuck
animating the gaia's vulcans slowly pushing the unit back in space
fucking Z1
speaking of space animations
that shit gets me moist
eureka popping nirvash's clutch
you know what the best cut-in in the history of srw is
I heard it's pretty "eh" though
I'll watch arc someday
<:ChrisSunglasses:654428105590439939>
for the premium sound pack
should have paid up
no getter change attack or anything
they didn't really do the legwork needed to make G2 and G3 worth it
that they didn't put getter 2 or 3 in
I just wish, and this sounds kinda funny
devolution getter-1 made up for ryoma having a boring unit
they're known as arios guy because of what they did with the arios cut-in in Z2
the units new to z2 feel out of place when mixed with all the z1
rather
the 00 units feel pretty out of place in z2
I feel Z2 made some improvements in things but overall the animation felt more consistent (and looked better when not on the PSP) in z1
shinkalion does it better though
idk kira's... alright
3, but it's basically playing second fiddle to astray in W
but I think they used samples from the show for it
I'd have to dig out my PS2 and Generation of CE to verify though
I don't think that's correct
from what I heard the voice actor at least, for a time, refused to voice the character in supplemental materials
what can be verified is that someone who worked on destiny fucking hated cagalli
he steals the gundam
not only does he win
anyway crossbone rules because they hand an assault rifle to a 14 year old and shove him in the arena on foot to fight a gundam and the 14 year old wins
despite one being a physical cannon and one being a beam rifle
I don't think they ever explain it, the guns just magically make a super shotgun and a sniper rifle when combined
and everything crossbone does is good
crossbone
especially since you know what other unit does that
at least I can understand beam rifle + beam rifle = beam cannon
I love buster but the combining guns make no sense
makes no sense
which also
it can shoot the shotgun through the beam rifle for a bigger beam rifle
SF MAKES WAY MORE SENSE THAN SHOOTING A BEAM RIFLE THROUGH A SHOTGUN FOR BEAM SHOTGUNS
NO OKAY NO
I'd agree but Buster Gundam makes it reasonable
the only thing cool about the strike freedom is that its guns can peg each other
if you count DD you need to raise your standards
funnel missiles are the dumbest thing in UC other than possibly things relating to the RX-0
I like how they never ever acknowledge the E6 and E7 pilots in episode 1 exist ever again
Hyper competent bishounen dweeb with no friends
I have never, in my life, seen the character archetype of the supreme commander in anime before
also can I just say that
and akita is just like "hold on let me speak Autism to him"
that episode with the mist
but only because ideon and ultraman are deep
I mean it is kinda deep
insanity
my favorite thing about shinkalion is it has a fucking 5 cour story and then it has a 1 cour 'season 2' for the fucking hell of it
FUCK
THE OTHER GIRLS ARE NAMED AFTER BOATS
GOD WHAT IF ANNO DID NAME HIKARI AFTER THE FUCKING TRAIN
the theatrical releases are 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
the DVD/BD releases are called that
Technically
*is named after the hikari rail star shinkansen*
a character that has been named for 30 years
Hikari
class rep
the fucking
azure you're forgetting
3.33 was way before shinkalion though
I... think that's why the shinkansen was painted, yeah
irl
because they painted a type 500 shinkansen eva colors
yes
and it's 10/10
nothing in this movie makes sense
They punch the final boss so hard a portal opens and shinji ikari jumps out to stab the final boss
it is the most awful anime movie I have ever seen and it's godlike
that movie cannot be real
I still can't believe I watched that fucking movie
They heard they could see tits at otakon
Yes
Her name, officially, is lihua
She has a Chinese name and that's how you write it, reika is the Japanese reading
Lihua
You are never going to guess how reika's name is written in the English alphabet
Nothing beats the cg ramen block
Silvia is one of the main three and is a bit odd yes
The main cast is mid but the side characters are great
cool
It's less a plothole and more the entire set-up for the early parts of G is on very shaky ground lol
G is the other way around
Unexplained elements of s1 sometimes make more sense the longer you think about them
I just wish G's structure was stronger; the building blocks are good but the house they make is falling apart
I feel it's related to how long you've been an anime fan and how much you've watched
<:smug:656050349752451100>
Flay was the best written character of seed, though not one I like
I sleep
The filthy older sister of action taimanin
That's taimanin rpgx right
The only one I thought had interesting things to say was digi due to their fixation on the production end of things and there's a lot of sifting through their opinions you have to do
I'm not sure I watch any youtuber who's not involved in science or education <:thonk:824436307186024488>
The article might overstate the case but I don't think it really goes above and beyond
very obviously pulling roots from fukushima
the entire movie is less about godzilla and more about japan's government reacting to a disaster
someone who had too much pride in their country and had to accept the truth isn't beautiful
I don't think shin godzilla could have been made by anyone else
I absolutely believe he's an ex-nationalist though
the anime tones it down further
the manga tones it down
at that
GATE the web novel is *really* bad
I don't really think so, it's not really different from hollywood habitually making the "downhome white country girl" or whatever peak desireability for several decades
like, what the fuck
gloval
captain nemo
no he was a rip-off of captain gloval from macross
the nautilus has aesthetics that beg you to think of space battleship yamato
I assume you're talking about all of one sentence here
ignore that and push forward

Âú∞ÁêÉÂ∏ùÂõΩÂÆáÂÆôËªçËªçËâ¶
the official classification for the Exelion is
but most of the imperialism is cooked into the technical terms
Jung's in this pose while trying to apologize for starting shit with Kazumi
oh right
This is less a comment on imperialism and more on japanese superiority
there's also all the japanese ladies in the bath being properly demure while Jung is A) large breasted, B) out in the open and vulnerable, and C) in front of an image of the american moon lander
this is the 'international' space station where they're assembling the global candidates

though it's more obvious when you actually read side material - Japan bought Hawaii off of America in like 2001 after America tried to start a war and lost or something
there's a few real key moments
https://animekritik.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/imperialism-translation-gunbuster-introduction/
but all the language for organizations and stuff basically makes sense as expanded japanese government agencies
you miss it with most subs that don't really touch on background details
I think the collapse of the economic bubble changed some things
My favorite gunbuster essay is still the one about how it's actually about japanese imperialism and it shows Anno was a huge nationalist at the end of the 80s
article did not age well
but also yes
for everyone's sake lets try to be careful with emotes
<:StaresAtYou:622844417518206986>
scroll up, it's at position 0 because it's made one narbillion dollars
To be a threat you have to be badass, is kind of what it boils down to
compare with all the american conservatives who hate the government but love the troops
but I still hold that it's dickriding about how amazing the JSDF is
Flamethrowers is an interesting counterpoint and this is perhaps a symbol of Anno losing faith in his government
it takes literally the end of the world to stop them
JSSDF uh, is successful in EoE
I'd argue the opposite
they have america's hand-me-downs which honestly, is enough to not be a joke
but I think it shows that the showcreators thought overly highly of them
Anyway it's kind of a smaller thing and I don't think it's meant as propaganda the way GATE is
I'm not actually sure the JSDF is constitutionally allowed to do weapons development
and *it is weird*
that they'd have such cutting edge tech
weird?
when I first watched it I thought that was
this isn't just blank symbolism, this is "Misato has to go crawling to the JSSDF and requisition their prototype positron cannon because NERV doesn't have anything in their arsenal that can hurt Ramiel"
It's less about 'what has meaning' and more about how the show creators see the JSDF
they have tech on the level of or better than NERV sometimes, and they end up winning in the end
They're a borderline antagonist force that gets in NERV's way, but
honestly evangelion kinda rides the JS(S)DF's dick a lot too
my favorite part is where they get the lolibaba waifu onto TV in court to tell everyone about how the JSDF is the most brave and powerful soldiers
He's the guy who did diebuster
Okada is credited as a screenplay writer for 1-6 (along with others) and as the original creator
who's basically anno's protege
the only thing I can see is that Tsurumaki has directing credits for the new science lessons
If he directed all 6 I think it doesn't
all 6 episodes are directed by anno, though he only has writing credits for 5 and 6
I'm looking at the credits here
also what?
you say that like he was uninvolved with the project
not necessarily
but I think it's something to admit
I do not really have a *problem* with this, after 30 years of consuming hollywood
I think "Humanity persevered against impossible odds with hardwork, guts, and scientific advancement" that's at the core of Gunbuster is inseperable from "The japanese spirit preservered against impossible odds with hardwork, guts, and scientific advancement"
*this is gunbuster canon*
Japan *bought Hawaii off of the US after the US lost a war to them*
again
it's somewhat unavoidable with simulcast
rushing translators I feel like isn't a huge deal, though the pay is
the show you want to support gets 2 dollars, the other show gets 8
but you also struggle your way through a 60 episode mess because everyone's talking about it
you find a show you absolutely fall in love with, it's 13 episodes
let's say you pay 15 for a month and crunchy splits up 10 of that for royalties
especially because paying for crunchyroll doesn't work out the way you want it to
I just hate crunchyroll because it's a terrible way to support anime I care about
f
does cut out the last 3 episodes (4 if you want to include 12, which a lot of fans don't)
I was thinking of miller's report yeah
you could even really shorten it with the 08th movie
0080 is probably the best shortform dose of gundam unless you've got 9 hours or whatever to just chug the OG movies
Novel or photonovel
and maybe never will be
there's a few grognard works not in OYW but they're not animated yet
OYW tends to be a lot more grognard because they know they have a lot of ww2 milsim nerds there while the rest of UC is a lot more transparently teenagers in magic robots - aside from Victory which is just. different.
One of the like, 5 most famous touhou characters can be described as a barrier master
the show gets 10 times better if you keep repeating "children's toys" after every plot escalation
I forgot how good this was
god there's choral singing going on and siren's blazing and the villains are panicking
10/10, please inject more of this dumb kids bullshit into my eyes
THE PHONES GO SUPER MODE WHEN THE ROBOTS DO
PARTLY BECAUSE OH MY GOD THE PHONES
it got way lamer when they moved to smartphones
fucking love this stupid anime

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/672257315805593600/780247341017071636/danballTextingHiro.gif
if you're watching build fighters without the injokes you should just legitimately be watching danball senki instead
this is the universal experience for gundam movies aside from MSG, 00, and I'm not going to pass judgement on the g-reco movies yet
yes
what a god
huh, no shit, kohei tanaka did 08th's music
He still gets the blame for not paying someone who excels in what he doesn't
There's a reason people hire a team
Thank God they're drawn by others
It's the melting pot of authors who have half to a third of enough ideas to make a story
Nah when it came out it was one of the first really "huh, really?" inanimate object ones
Because they're frequently WNs first, as they're often written by amateurs who latch onto Isekai to prop up the areas of writing they're weak on
oh I don't want spoilers
but it sounds very bad
whats a revue of annihilation I have not watched the movie
longform content is a turnoff
people these days expect everything to be the length of a netflix show
and you never know if a new work's going to be successful
the more expansive the story arc, the longer it takes, so the more money you get - or at least, the longer before you have to make a new manga/LN and come up with a completely new idea which is more work
I feel like "but money!!" is the major flaw of most serialized works
but money!!
I'd say demon slayer and MHA is the current weeb pipeline, with MHA starting to fall out of fashion
they would if they were 20 years older
I don't think new weebs watch naruto
oh
what is konoha
miku is a dad??
They've been a disaster for us, don't know about the company
I'll tell you when I went to SDCC in... oh, 06, I think? 05? you could stare in one direction and see 80 naruto headbands
millennials who grew up on it I guess
it just seems like you have a fixation on naruto
naruto is mediocre as hell but so is basically every super popular anime
are you ok
Ed is competent and has some pretty potent abilities but he's pretty far from being able to take on most shounen characters in a fair fight
power scaling is like, the least relevant part of FMAB
I'd imagine the fact the author is a woman is a part of that
it feels different from most shounens
FMAB is unironically solid
nice ass, alex
the "is this incest?" vibes were already kinda strong
why are they on the same day that's kinda creepy
rather than actually make a legends arceus anime
I'm saying they bent over backwards to rewrite ideas from arceus so that they could use the main cast
I know
yes
because the story is set 200 years ago and they're bending over backwards to make it not?
still weirds me out that they manage to cram ash into this
sounds like a real conjob
anitube is terrible
Yeah the sequels were decent actually
how do you all read so many of these
A bit slow but what back then wasn't
Yeah I liked it
Yuyu hakusho
Lose it
Did you
that sometimes happens yes
they probably had to skip some weeks due to events or whatever
12-13 yeah
several of the OVAs are almost a cour long
it feels like way more than the 4th but I guess it is
man it's weird to see "fourth television series"
generally 2
I mean, it does take years to make a movie
the fact they were still making so much money from the concerts and stuff is partially *why* they don't make a new anime show
if a new show comes out they move away from the old ones except for anniversary concerts
Delta's been milked
You're also missing all the roadshows and concerts
they're the same thing
gundam 2.0
I feel like macross is going to lose creativity and just keep going with what works
yeah
move the fuck on with the franchise please
yay
And he presumably recruited her
Adam didn't really hijack shit, st Germain was just stupid for trusting him
If you're referring to axz
Feels like a stretch tbh
final episode broadcast was a recap
no
11 and one recap
it had 12
that does not count the recaps
most things I see claim 86 has 23 episodes
I don't know what you mean by that
same thing
but really, if you ever open a torrent of an anime and see "episode 4.5"
I'm going to cite GuP once again
and honestly I don't think it's really 'better'
this is nothing new really
I am not reading LNs
I have about 30 sanderson novels to get through
and that's why I'm not sure the anime is worth watching
I am absolutely not going to read the books
or did it pause well
did it
of course not, better use some of our precious paid airtime to cover the last 4 episodes
??? and decided to open it up with a recap
they had to do the "lmao we'll give you the finale next year" shit
oh technically cour 2 isn't even a cour
but no, they had to do an emergency recap two eps later
that might be but you'd think they'd be able to use this as cushioning just like they would for a planned recap
cour 2 had 3 recaps
*really* shitting the bed
2 recaps in 3 episodes is

was 86's production this bad?
what the fuck
holy shit
awful
a recap episode
apparently 86's first cour ended with
hahaha oh my god
Girls und Panzer had a '10 episode cour' because they had to put in two awful recap episodes - since they only had 12 episode slots, this means the final two episodes had to air like 6 months later
which is why the movie is way better than the tv show unless, possibly, if you're the kind of person who thinks Yukari is the best waifu of all time
that OVA was after the part where they decided "you know we don't actually *have* to mimic historic tactics if it'd be more fun to do crazy anime shit"
it happens off-screen in the show proper during the upgrade episode where they're exploring the school-ship
the anzio battle was what I was talking about yeah lol
that weird episode where an entire match takes place off-screen while they dig around for tank upgrades
GuP is actually a good example of a show that you can see how it's suffering even if you don't watch the recaps
I've talked to several GuP fans who weren't aware there were any recaps because they're either not included in torrents or tucked in seperate folders
not be aware a recap episode exists
I don't know what you watch but it's really easy these days to just
Are you sure about that lol
because to get that point, *everything else* has to be crashing into brick walls
even if you skip the recaps
and all else being equal, a show with planned recaps is going to be better than one with unplanned ones
I think I understand what you're getting at now but it's just kinda been normal for a while
planned ones still try to tie into the story
at least for unplanned recaps
Assuming you're not good enough to notice production dips, this has been the major pattern for the 2010s
from where I'm sitting it's a completely neutral thing not really worth commenting on
there is no positive quality to them only labelling 12 eps here
this is them not realizing how bad they're going to fuck up
yes this isn't them being courteous or nice
and had to schedule the rest *the following year*
and aired only 10 non-recap eps
and when they *fucked up horribly* they ran out of air time
because they planned 12 eps
Right
^
instead of a meme joke
people make this joke a lot but I'm way more interested in hearing about actual good recaps
so I'm really confused what point you're making here
that's what happened with cour 2
and yet
ah
you can't claim "they didn't subtract the recaps" and then subtract the recaps
that is *part of the season*
it was the next week
ever since japan moved to this splitcour thing they've completely lost sense of what to call a season and what not to
because I'm leaning on saying the evangelion rebuild movies in terms of visuals
what counts as a CGI movie
exia was pretty popular, but...
I don't know, probably not
they were instructed to come up with designs with less detail
budgeting is why the 00 s2 mechs look different
and as a matter of fact
if they made half the show, sold the kits, got the profits, used that on s2 - they could fund the whole show more smoothly
I'm guessing it was budgeting
like, the first show to really lean into the split cour idea
00 tho
I kind of never liked the clone wars aesthetic personally (too play-dough), but the cg was quite competent
houseki no kuni is better looking imo, but it's completely possible you'll prefer the style of clone wars
I'd definitely count the eva movies over hathaway
rolling my eyes a bit
which they were probably intentionally going for
yeah the madoka op is like an 8/10 for me, the chorus is great but doesn't pull the rest of the song up over the 'truly excellent' hump - and it's got a strong flavor of "generic anime op" sound in it
it's been bleached after all
I'd hope it was clean
yeah it was pretty decent
are we powerscaling people who abuse teens or are we powerscaling how well they abuse teens
like if I said gundam 00 s1 came out 4 years ago, or Eva Rebuild 2.0, I feel those would be believable statements
it's just really hard to determine age past that
but I feel like anime's had basically the same digital animation effects for a good decade
I generally think of everything past the 2010 digital shooting revolution as modern, really - not everything post 2010 qualifies, as different studios caught up at different points (and some managed before '10)
yeah it's not old
...idk Takumi balancing the 86 so its wheel hovered over the gutter was pretty fucking good
but First Stage had like, all the best race moments
I literally only remember like 3 moments from it
<:elfnein_excite:530171812802330624>
but who the fuck cares takumi's got another race next ep
it's like, the B plot to a soap opera
the plot is pretty weak tbf
get the three worst names
I love how the three most important characters
Ry, KT, and Tak. I can't think of three better names ~~for the next season of the digimon dub~~
they're incredibly bad
(I had to look this one up)
: )
you mean Natalie
but I'm sure tokyopop must have censored something
I never got far enough to reach the enjo kosai arc
Izzy
but the music is a deathblow
I'm sure someone could enjoy those
like, the other parts - the stupid names, the ricer automobile slang, the terrible opening
and replaced it with absolute audio trash
but the biggest, most criminal sin they did is they completely tore out and replaced the eurobeat soundtrack
I wish I could say it's so bad it's good
4kids included
the tokyopop dub is probably the worst english adaptation to date
initial D maybe? because the dub is so absolutely bad? but I feel like there might have been others before
god I wonder what it was for me
I used dummy balloons to steal a gwazine class in a OYW play by post
CCA
okay the twitter post makes it sound like more of a personal slight than the article does
wait, do they not pay out the royalties accrued?
kind of a weird point to bring up
yeah it's gross
I forgot his fucking time stop power
god
the most hype thing in game 2's plot is when Aphrodi (the captain of the final team in the first season) joined
I never made it to Go
too long
inazuma eleven 1 was great, but the seasons based on games 2 and 3 were just
inazuma eleven has the goalies doing the wackiest shit
Like it's a weird fetishy joke but I can see your point, it's arguably the most recognizable thing about strike witches
Lmao getting rid of no pants
wow no wonder mushoku tensei looked so good, the production firm literally made a new studio just for it
Yes that's called marketing
You viewing a show on a service does not really help a studio
Same, but I'd do that even if one company had all the anime
As long as you can pay someone to agree to not put their material on other services you're stuck in this situation
And those strategies aren't exclusive
Or you let one company become so powerful they can keep competitors out of business (this is the worst timeline)
Or you remove capitalism from it
This will never happen unless streaming becomes undesirable
There was like 6 people in the theater for nanoha
looking at just the screenshot it looks more fujoshi than ally
Homoeroticism
yeah but generally that's like half damage on an evasion save
evasion saves still work <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Poor stone ocean
it's definitely more overdesigned than that
he was pumping out a billion designs that looked the same in the mid/late 00s
I know okawara's vibe isn't for everyone but at least it feels like there's more of a cohesive unit here
but katoki's version looks like soulless ass
not necessarily
I hate them
katoki's GFF designs were so bad
god
it's just a red rx-78 with a gun on its shoulder
did a lot to cement the gunpla subculture and the idea of mobile suit kitbashes
plamo kyoshiro is probably the most important publication in gundam history
the story gunpla builders wishes it was
oh wait no it was plamo kyoshiro
I have no idea aya, I think the perfect gundam 3 was invented by GBF franchise rather than the original source of the perfect gundam
legitimate question: why would you default to an abbreviation you have to explain to english speakers
NERD
because the perfect gundam 2 is based on the RX-178 mk II
absolutely embarrassing they didn't rewrite that bit entirely when they adapted it to OVA
god
everything regarding puru twelve's history in unicorn is cringe
yes
and considering her name doesn't actually come from any culture, that's fucking dumb to have happen
First and foremost it's a sick joke about sexualizing her, but beyond that, it's phonetically got nothing to do with how you actually say her damn name
There's a number of reasons I think the real mistake is sticking with Ple
'messed it up'
there were like 2-3 dozen MP quebs during the glemy rebellion
I'm pretty sure there were 20+
it was Puru in dynasty warriors I remember that
none of it is written with english letters, after all
but puru and ple are the same thing.
the official sunrise romanization has been Ple ever since Unicorn
anyway Lemon people - L people, as it's better known, the namesake of Elpeo ple - is a lolicon publication dating back to the 80s or earlier
the OVA pretty heavily rewrites the base premises
if something looks *fucking off* to you here, that might tell you what's wrong with the manga
> Once he agrees, Himuro and his daughter head to an operating room without Masato's knowledge, and he installs a sphere called a "Dimensional Joint" - a flawed duplicate of the original - into his daughter's womb, and she is teleported to within Zeorymer's "eye". This is necessary to utilise Zeorymer's true abilities - without them, it is simply an outdated G-Class robot.
from wikipedia
I will give you a small snippet of the plot
okay look
the publication puru is named after.
because it was published in Lemon People
also never read the manga for zeorymer
not quite that bad
because zeorymer is not a series that ends well for anyone
the blue helps

I mean there's the not-really-canon super ultimate upgrade form of zeo

look how swag this shit is

he did do this though
other than penelope
The artist who did the xi has done basically no other gundam designs
okawara I guess
The problem with xi is everytime I see it I just wish it was zeorymer instead
gihren would have had him killed
no
the 50 years since that is just, mmmmm
I think the Federation as depicted in 0079 was already at the perfect level of "kind of scummy but reasonable to fight for"
"Sure, the Zabis committed some atrocities, but they only had to do it because the federation denied them their rights" is the logic Unicorn sets up
it's blackwashing of the federation and whitewashing of zeon
I mean, that's the punchline of Unicorn
Federation hiding the *real* charter for 90 fuckin years because it's harder to oppress people if they know the truth!!! is like, the dumbest shit
Unicorn is stupid cartoon evil a lot
Really it's just
I feel like you can still do this character concept with less edge
Some entire fights don't happen
But other stuff in the novels got changed?
iirc the novel devotes like a page and a half to how Marida's now unable to have children because she had too many induced abortions?
they at least toned it down and abbreviated it in the OVA though
that has nothing do with the decision to keep the whole bit about turning puru 12 into a rape slave in the story when Marida Cruz definitely doesn't need that to work as a character
anyway
it's 100% only anime because the MG sold like candy
that's different from the bigwigs having plans to adapt it
every author wishes their story could be animated
well duh
oh
Sunrise doesn't adapt written works, that's not their MO
it would have been an anime.
If it was always supposed to be anime
I absolutely call bullshit
there's no way that's true lmao
It's too different a story
No the remake does not
I know with fsn there was the mediocre realta nua
Did they even do an all ages cut of the og tsukihime
without memes the anime isn't the worst thing on the market but it's also not worth watching
make sure to also watch the tsukihime anime for the full nasuverse
<:sadeline:628615321212682270>
Zero first just hurts the FSN experience later
neither of those are good answers
"Which thing do I *watch* first" has no good answer
as for "where to get into Fate" the only option that people don't really contest is that investing some 70 hours into reading the original VN is a very good starting point
it's just not really worth the time
as to the question, I don't know if you really need to partake in other Fate stuff to get more out of it, but that's largely because I'm not sure there's much to enjoy in Apocrypha even with the context
the worst fate property right
you're aware Apocrypha is like
https://youtu.be/0wn4HjLBvps?t=155 timestamped
they're exes
well, technically three episodes, given that Ramiel is two
this and the Ramiel fight are probably the two most iconic episodes in eva TV for me
The alpha series is where srw really started to push mesh-based sprite work into art
Commentary on the younger generation maybe
Tomino just really likes kids who make you roll your eyes
I'm only tagging them because someone in this conversation said they were halfway through zeta
Anyway ||he's just weirdly obsessed with Sarah and then he dies by flying into a rock||
The spoilers are there for a reason
Do you wanna try that one again aya
Like, him in cca and ||Katz|| in zeta are the two "Jesus Christ really" bits in Gundam for me
Yeah....
I really hate him in cca
Hathaway..... <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
It's one of the few Gundam shows I think is "a good anime" rather than "a good robot anime" ~~or even a bad robot anime for some~~
Same
(the reference is a little more obvious when you learn that the crew's hacker is named Woz)
From a character design perspective I liked Jobs from e7
The milf from mjp who keeps getting the commander drunk was pretty fun
Astonaige is fine yeah
The maid with a giant wrench from gravion is pretty up there
I wonder what my favorite anime mechanic is
Like I'm not saying you have to livepost or anything, but if you've got more than maybe two screenshots for an episode it's probably a little dense for the anime channel
Please use a live posting channel
Electronics fail and burn out when they go through the loose I fields of high density areas unless heavily shielded
Yes
yiff 19
VF1 is more like 12
VF-25 is 15 and a half and it's like one of the tallest
If no, that's why X flopped
Are you excited about the next marvel movie
Valks are about 2/3 the height of most non-90s MS
it's consistent enough
<:yayakaShrug:286284426541924352>
its fictional, not america
yes, it had an AT field
they basically had a monster design that was every angel from TV and movies glued together
the crossover episode itself was pretty surreal
they laid it on thick, too
it does, like 15ish episodes later
the segment ends with this
I lost my goddamn mind when Decisive Battle started playing in the middle of a normal fucking episode


shinkalion had a crossover episode with eva twice, even; one wasn't even about the actual show, just the train
||He figures out it's a different universe when he tries to get home and sees on the train map that the train routes are all fucked up around Tokyo (original)||
||it's explicitly a different universe that the protagonist somehow worldjumped to for a bit. they take advantage of this in the movie by punching the final boss to release some of the dimensional energy in its body to form a portal for shinji to jump out of to stab him with a train version of the lance of longinus. I am not making any of this up and the movie is 17/10. and also terrible.||
there is more character development for Hikari, the class rep, in Shinkalion than there is in any animated Evangelion content
the main character of shinkalion goes to tokyo 3
.hack//sign didn't age super hot but it's alright
and then go "that was a good anime I'm glad it's over"
I still need to watch s1
it's all just a funnel of Content and continuity doesn't really matter
love live seems to do it well, because none of it really matters
but it was also really light on multimedia
symphogear was ok
this is fucking cracked
> A second anime season was released in 2017 and consists of two parts; The Washio Sumi Chapter (È∑≤Â∞æÈ†àÁæé„ÅÆÁ´†, Washio Sumi no Sh≈ç), an adaptation of the Washio Sumi is a Hero light novels, and Hero Chapter (ÂãáËÄÖ„ÅÆÁ´†, Y≈´sha no Sh≈ç), which takes place after the first season. The Washio Sumi Chapter was first released as three theatrical films between March 18 and July 8, 2017 before airing as six television episodes between October 7 and November 11, 2017, followed by a recap of the first season which aired on November 18, 2017.[21] Hero Chapter, which consists of six television episodes, aired between November 25, 2017 and January 6, 2018.[22] Both parts were simulcast in North America by Anime Strike.[23] Three short films produced by W-Toon Studio, based on the spin-off manga, Y≈´ki Y≈´na wa Y≈´sha-bu Shozoku, were screened alongside each The Washio Sumi Chapter film.[24]
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
this is not a good sign

it became a multimedia mess after that
s1 was anime original
and the other anime are partial adaptations of the LNs
I've heard they're both messy because they made the mistake of writing them out as LNs rather than writing them as anime screenplays

because it's short
I vote planetarian
oo e17
https://twitter.com/catsuka/status/1567272111269445634
sounds like it's not worth going past the prequel movies
if there was a struggle I'd say it has queer themes
I don't recall tsukasa particularly struggling with it
yeah it's not a queer story
there's like less than 5 franchises in history where air date is not a right answer
air date
ok
so watch yuyuyu and then the movies and then I'm done
I actually remember fucking nothing about sign other than tsukasa
I can name like 4 shows that have a similar vibe to sign without being so slow
it is definitely slow
extremely early 00s
sign is fine it's just
I hope the producer of this project eats bad sushi
lol
this still looks like the most generic pixar idea possible
Only manga I own
take the voice actors and then modulate them
though mind you they can always do what the animes do
Yeah I meant for the singing
I don't think they even use the Vocaloid software for project diva
I'm pretty sure Miku's voiced by her original voice sample artist, same as Shinkalion
where is aoi yuuki in this clip
never bothered
could be wrong
I don't think geass did that?
updated character designs, etc
no reused footage at all
when I say re-animated I mean *completely*
*technically* the movies are a separate universe, but this really only comes into meaningful effect for movies 3 and 4 to explain why things aren't like the As epilogue
1 and 2 are condensed and completely re-animated versions of their seasons (I view 1 as pretty much a strict upgrade, 2 does cut out a plotline some people care about), 3 and 4 are two parts to an entirely new story
bump of chicken, there's a name I haven't heard in a while
I feel so out of the loop whenever this comes up
I have no idea what the premise of either show is lmao
is there a difference
You could argue ufotable is done with fate without ever starting it
~~or 2 for that matter~~
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN9GiMFWKPE I'd say 2.0 spoilers but there is zero fucking ability to understand what's going on from this clip (it does not make a lot of sense even with full context)
yes, but also no
Like, grasping loosely here, it'd be like saying Hans Christian Andersen was the creator of Frozen
sure, just that I think it's arguable about who the true 'creator' of ghost in the shell is
One of those cases of an adaptation being far superior to the source
Tbf he's not the one responsible for ghost being good
It's because she has the best haircut
The movie version of that scene is a Lot
This is roughly where the show gets weird
their parents took them to a cartoon : )
I know someone who watched it when they were 8, in theaters in japan
evangelion is definitely the seminal work when it comes to "figure it out yourself fucker" anime
the fact that some of the characters are lying and you're not told they're lying makes it fucking harder
evangelion is definitely difficult to get
it is a very strong scene
of note, there is a scene that is a 90 second still image
evangelion is a study in how limiting resources can really force creativity
those are the ones it's interesting to hear reactions to
oh wait it's 25 and 26 I'm thinking about nvm
I don't think the director's cut definitively makes it better but most people prefer it
gainax has no money, lol
I'm more fascinated by what the response to 23 and 24 will be
Boku no pico
And then when I finally decided to get watching anime again I downloaded cyberpunk first
More of a procrastination thing
Not intentionally but it kinda worked out that way
I'm excited to start watching it soon
This is pretty irrelevant imo
after eva, with the obvious production problems, might also be a good point to do shirobako
the choom is the worst but there's other annoying shit
and the slang fucking sucks
is they use the cyberpunk tabletop game slang
my major problem with the dub
I can't think of any other scenario in any SRW that's a 3 map mission
3 part mission?
I think it's a fucking
even if it's a lot
the EoE stage of srw alpha 3 is always one of my favorites though
||the hard pivot into forgetting Rei is a character does so much damage to the structure imo||
I've long ago decided it's one of the anime absolutely worth watching, but Good is a different question
I quite honestly haven't ever decided if Evangelion is Good‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
*a lot* of reasons you may not like it lmao
EoE is a strong film but there are
Yeah I don't think it's a sure slam
Again I like her design, it's just always mind games when you're trying to figure out why someone's posting her on twitter
But correct in that at least she doesn't look like, 6
~~its really more of a body type than an age thing~~
I still haven't finished it but while it's flash over substance so far, it's still one of the best cyberpunk genre visual pieces since ghost in the shell (with the possible exception of the blade runner film a few years ago I never saw)
And honestly David is spot on
Lucy and the other netrunner's design were fucking great too
Really brings it down
She's cool enough but I think it's shit that people are using her as either a lolicon pride badge or "lmao Japan so based for sexy lolis instead of vagina bones censorship West" poster girl after that cdpr interview
It's about Japan at the very end of ww2
It's possibly the most depressing anime movie made
iirc penpen's basically out of the show at this point lol
dicks censored
If CP2077 existed in a vacuum sure, but it's like 40 years of source material the anime is pulling from
A few moments have great scores, but honestly it makes you realise how much of KLK and Promare sawano was carrying on his back
~~the soundtrack needed work is honestly my biggest complaint~~
the rest didn't have the impact I thought it needed
episode 10 holds up the show though
even though he got credited as series director?
I don't agree with the last part, but that's because I don't think Imaishi exactly shines strongest in 'mature'
I can feel the KLK and Promare in it but it's way more mature and not just in conventional ways
it feels like Imaishi aged 30 years and had three kids since his other works, but that's probably because he didn't have full creative control
it's interesting
finished edgerunners
I don't think ER was particularly 'deep' but it was a satisfying experience
and has lore running back to CP2020 iirc
||Adam Smasher|| is also one of the final bosses of the game
lily is not asking about boys
so far
I've been told it's above bait but below gay
Disney mascot
I haven't seen the newest season but there's some major asterisks there
Not insane
Yes but it doesn't make her
And hungry for abusive relationships
Given that she's unquestionably insane
Harley isn't exactly prime LGBT rep
I'm still kinda stunned that Space Runaway Ideon got major coverage in an episode (though they called it Idepon)
Shirobako is about the anime industry and some titles get homaged or referenced
There are reasons that watching it after evangelion makes it better tbh
1.11 in particular is borderline a glorified recap movie so it's not exactly pleasant to go directly into it from TV
Honestly you can put off the rebuilds as long as you want
EoE is marked as episodes 25' and 26'
Death and rebirth is half a compilation film of the series and half the first 30 minutes of EoE yeah
Skip death and rebirth
But it might be good to put a week between the series and eoe
I guess after that it's 25, 26, 25', and 26'
"you should watch a 2 hour movie full of footage you've already seen to listen to a song" is not exactly a good endorsement
if ever
it should probably be the last animated eva media you bother consuming
eh
I like that they put a naruto on the naruto headband
Geass R2 makes G look like a bedtime story when it comes to cliffhangers
Not as bad as his next work though
Yes
Sensationalism is the name of the game
S2 is more concerned with forcing you to tune in next week than it is with telling a good story
A lot of people like it and it has a good ending but I would not label it "good"
Season 2 is uh
Season 1 is pretty good
Foul
They don't always make good stuff (when's the last time you saw someone talk about BNA?) but it was definitely solid here
She trips and breaks her ankle and then screams and blames all the [ethnic slur]s for ruining the Olympics
Maybe you're thinking of WAP
I still love how five star stories is Nagano trying to do lgaim better than tomino
E7 is basically if you put a kid who was shinji ikari levels of normal in amuro's place and then wrapped everything in counterculture
My main complaint is it fumbles the final plot a bit but the emotional note holds strong
It does a lot of Gundam better than gundam
No it's definitely good
There are two mecha on here
People not having heard of e7 <:sobeline:949855729119023144>
Like the rest of the cast is killing little girls because their lover won't sleep with them anymore
In the context of the story I can't really blame shinji for not being better
He's there because he's being used and he's more or less there against his will
I think "actively creates deaths and suffering because of their foolishness" doesn't apply to shinji
It's that, among other things, asking someone to be a hero is fucked
Evangelion isn't about being a hero
I think saying someone's a shit tier character because they don't give you the heroic fix you need is either trolling or foolish, personally
Amuro's arc ends with him becoming "manly"
Cypher needs everyone to be manly
Anyway now that you're through that all that's left are the final two episodes where they explain everything
That's the point yes
But I'm not convinced it was budget
It's the longest still sequence in anime that I'm aware of
He already got a good taste during Arael
Though many of the most *iconic* episodes are in the "fun" part of the show
As it is feels like most of the critical episodes occur in the last third
Evangelion would have been a very different show if they were serious the whole run
Introducing Kaworu earlier would definitely have been... Interesting
<:catsip:656050349399998464>
Though imo the names are not particularly symbolic
Which I think means Judgement of God
Armisael
Ah
I remember in my tabletop game the PCs were given pagers and cellphones didn't exist
I like how this is the technology objection you have and not the fact that shinji's media player is an SDAT magnetic tape player
There is also another actual recap movie (technically two movies) called death and rebirth
Reanimated
But 95% of the movie is just episodes 1-6
And there's also things in it that are a *very big* "wait, huh?"
1.0 is a recap movie but it's also the first movie of the series which isn't a recap series
Confusing
Its
For series you haven't finished
Also you have a bad habit of looking stuff up lol
I wasn't kidding about 2 decades
Most of us waited like 2-3 decades to finish rebuild I think he can wait a few weeks
||this is part of why everyone treats him like shit||
||3.0 reveals that the "near" 3rd impact still killed fucktons of people globally||
Rebuild spoilers ||He improves in 2.22 and he's punished for it by causing most of the world to die||
**they fucked up**
It would have been
it is probably one of the 5 most important episodes in the show
Zeruel in particular would have been bookmarked for a high budget episode
That's not really how it works
It didn't
3 weeks
or you've mismanaged to the point your episode development time is like
the only time money isn't directly equal to time is when animators in the industry refuse to work with you
It doesn't mean they wouldn't, but I'm not arguing either way, I'm arguing you don't have the point you think you have
does not mean they'd do that if they had more money!
Just because the DC doubles down on the things they established *under* the production issues
Okay but part of the weird and artsy part of evangelion was the creative restrictions put on by production issues
DC is an expanded look at what they ended up making
DC is not the "original vision" - I've *seen* the preproduction notes of evangelion and the original vision is *massively* different
That's a terrible argument
I do not think you understand how fucking embarassing that is
There's zero way they'd make the final two episodes ||a fucking clip show|| otherwise
yes I think that's correct
no one here has claimed that 25 and 26 was going to be EoE
instead of discussing things with us
I think you're arguing against strawmen that aren't here
I think your point is bupkis man
Again
You can *still draw that*
Regardless of the *content* of the episodes, I think they definitely show production issues.
It's ||a pair of clip show episodes for a finale.||
I think you're missing a piece here
why does death and rebirth exist.
if money wasn't a problem
outside of 25 and 26
production issues *heavily* affect the later episodes, but I don't think they went in a radically different way than planned
I agree in that I think the shift was planned
||I rewatched the final episode the other day, I'm like 70% convinced Lucy cracks her helmet and kills herself on the moon shortly after the anime ends||
One of those things where you zone out for a while after finishing it
<:yayakaStare:292520684326748161>
he definitely already did that
I want to be hopeful but Diebuster was actually gainax's best work and I think it's impossible to add to it without knocking the jenga tower down
I'm unconvinced on that one
you could argue it's actually 13 years late
by the way, the original planned schedule for the movies had movie 4 planned to be released in 08 simultaneously with 3
anime films generally take 2 and a half when you take your time
iski even the first film was 5 years
massive delay on all of them
lmao
because it's not reused cels
yes that's one of the better sequences
he would not finish with this as-is if he had to choose
Anno definitely has pride in his work
You can be relevant and still abstract
for one
They could have animated actually relevant imagery
I don't think you're understanding
I'm willing to buy the argument that *maybe* that part was halfplanned
you don't announce you're remaking the episodes if they're not completely scuffed
20 March 1996 ‚Äì Airing of Episode #25.
27 March 1996 ‚Äì Airing of Episode #26.

And furthermore:
April 1996 ‚Äì Announcement that #25 and #26 would be remade for the home release as a form of OVA, followed by an announcement of a completely new, original, unrelated, standalone Evangelion film. (Is there an announcement?)
check the timeline you just posted
if you want proof that 25 and 26 are disasters
I think 25 and 26 were marked for a lower budget so they could focus the resources on the episodes earlier, but I do not think they planned whatsoever for the final episodes to end up looking like *that*
they're not related to StrikerS at all; in fact they can't exist in the same setting as StrikerS
movies 3 and 4 are completely seperate from the TV series
I ended up watching both versions of As and didn't really feel I wasted my time in doing so
if you plan to consume the entire franchise I would probably say the second season (As) TV series, just because one of the cut plot threads does get followed up on by StrikerS in a small way
the second movie does actually cut out a few small plotthreads of value but the production quality, particularly for the final fight, is massively higher
after that it's a little more vague whether you should watch the second TV season or the second movie
the s1 tv show isn't completely unwatchable but you're really not missing much by doing the movie instead and you're gaining a lot in exchange
Unless you feel like being an anime archeologist I'd probably recommend the "Nanoha Movie First" or whatever the first movie's called
||Also you can do a quest in 2077 where you talk to Falco and he gives you David's jacket and he insinuates Lucy passed apparently||
||Not like she has anything back on earth, and she was only on a moon tour||
honestly could easily be the first dominican-american anime *character*
first dominican-american anime protag afaik
A1 is completely capable of making two anime at once
I can't believe cypher hates fun
keeps the idea but elevates the design

I also like her movie redesign because it's more than just "school uniform with a red bow on it"
but nanoha's an exception for several reasons; the first season was flawed and badly/very cheaply animated and it was easy to improve
and generally I prefer the TV broadcast over a movie recap
I can see the appeal
just the family member of people who *do* have erotic scenes
she's not a character with erotic scenes, just to clear that up
so watching the movie instead is nice.
the first TV series is also possibly the ugliest anime I've ever watched to completion
the movie basically entirely cuts all that and it's one of the reasons it's a cleaner cut than the second movie, which actually had to pick what *interesting* stuff it had to cut
but those family members literally have nothing to do with anything in the remainder of all of nanoha
it spends a lot of time focusing on her family members, because they're characters in the eroge
This is one of the reasons the first season kind of sucks
because the original source for Nanoha is as a character in an eroge. They made an OVA that has no porn in it focusing on her to play with the idea that she's a magical girl while all the ridiculous assassin shit in the main eroge is going on
you're after the shock value
I think if Misato's scar isn't enough for you
I think it's enough to show someone has a disfiguring scar without drawing gore or an anatomically accurate disfigurement
I'm grouping them all together because I think they're the same weird sickness to upset people
ok no offense but "there needs to be more gore/upsetting content/heroes losing in media" takes are pretty much universally bad
hell, evangelion did that with a changing scene
shows have done that
the one of the FIS girls showering together was absolutely gratuitous
one shower scene made sense to be a shower scene
also I think only like
"it's a trope" doesn't make it not kinda fucked, it just means you're used to it
you can do a shower scene without having the character much in frame (or at all, honestly)
it's the major runtime of them being skimpy, so they make sure to emphasize their frame during the shower scenes
I think even when the characters are sad on screen the naked girls are still supposed to be suggestive and attractive
is kinda fucked that most of the nudity scenes are sad shower scenes
but the supporting cast is pretty great
I have a lot lower opinion of frontier than most I think because I just do not like the main cast
Bobby is the helmsman of the macross quarter in frontier
sho hayami is max's voice actor
also sho hayami is just a beast
max and bobby are the best macross characters
I think it's a bad take, is all
char existing makes it incredibly better and Victory gave it an actual point
yeah guess not
maybe I'm tripping
didn't they already do a TV cut of that one
TV cuts of movies might be my least favorite way to squeeze money out of projects
üôÑ
dick balang
call it a life lesson, that's normally how these things work
is it the standard affair where you have to register a payment method to use the trial and they start billing the instant it's over unless you cancel
how did they trick you
They've basically got a monopoly on the seasonal anime industry aside from the few titles the other streaming services commissioned
everything?
the only reason it was an interesting game was because it was a prototype of yakuza
I'd say "what a shame the story will never be finished" but the story was never good
yoko hikasa making pink the new blonde
average maria moment, really
he's got a special bumper that collects their soul so they can be sent off to the client's world
has a fairy partner to act as a gobetween
I'm rather sad they never adapted that webcomic about the truckdriver who fills all these requests for heroes from other dimensions
but LNs get it worse because of the volume structure
yeah it's definitely also a manga problem
with 3 more to be written
Especially the shows that don't have a climax because the end of the season is just the end of volume 3 out of 7
The fact that most isekais are serial LNs with the only planned end point being "when it stops being massively profitable" is also a major flaw in the genre
I've heard people aren't enthused with later volumes
anyway Executioner strikes me as the type of show/novel that runs out of steam as the author realizes they're starting to play out the gimmick aspect
||church is evil, gasp||
but again, I'm only halfway through
feels a lot like the author went "ha, that's a clever premise to switch things up, time to turn my brain off and write easy gay plots to flesh it out"
it's good but not a fan of how braindead cliche the major end-of-vol-(2?) twist is
I'm halfway through Executioner
but the other bits are good
I think Mushouku Tensei is probably higher on my list than Re: Zero, that fucking personality regression Subaru has fucking sucks
Most of the core isekai trend setters have had good moments
who needs to thread in clever worldbuilding exposition when you can just have a cute girl sit the protag down and yammer on about how magic works
it exists because it's the most braindead way to write a non-earth setting and so you have a million amateurs writing LNs and WNs that studios are harvesting for easy bucks
wondering if it's a copyright strike or something
does gundam.info use the youtube player
hmm weird
read the ascendance of deez nuts
if they wake up in another world they're not dead
EoE answers more questions than it sets up
Especially because a few times characters, and by proxy the audience, either make mistakes or are actively lied to during "reveals"
Eva is definitely dense and difficult to wrap your head around
Yes the series started with Rei 2
Oh
Luckily you're at the end, so that'll get taken care of
He picked it because it exists in Ultraman and he thought it was cool
None of the judeo Christian imagery is relevant to any real degree in Eva
Xenosaga definitely cares more about Christianity
||The show holds up pretty well as a Cyberpunk tabletop campaign||
||Adam Smasher is mentioned in like half of the rulebooks and is the final boss of 2077||
That was my initial takeaway but I think it's grown on me since
I feel like they'd be able to reliably resolve that in under 36 hours
ambient noises
could even be those companies that register like
||now he finds out I lied and 25 and 26 don't answer a single question||
It's an anime
<:sobeline:949855729119023144>
hughes was voiced by fujikei
<:adamspotted:580124885268037656>
I forgot roy was voiced by shinichiro miki
that is longer than 50
I can think of a 50 ep show
I wonder what the longest run of unique eyecatches is
"people loved overgrown gundams in 00 let's do it again"
After 1.0 came out people spent 10 years trying to figure out whether Anno was trolling or if something is very very off with the films
Hate how Rei stops existing as a character and pivots to almost entirely being a plot device the instant asuka shows up
Now that das is done with Eva I can air my biggest complaint
But it's rough
Not that awful
It's
Same
It's niche
lol
Add it to the bottom
Rahxephon gets brought up a lot in eva clone talks but honestly it's more raideen with an Eva paint job
It still does its own thing but the inspiration is thick
Out of all the Eva clones (and they're a bigger group than I can count on one hand) that's the most eva-like
It's a show called fafner
Anyway das if you ever want to watch evangelion part two
"let's make erotic content in the sequel to a kids tv show" is still one of the worst ideas
Not to mention the whole idea about courage being a canonical superpower wasn't in gaogaigar and was only brought up as an idea in the (flawed in many ways) sequel ova
The 6th? 7th? Brave anime?
It's completely bullshit, especially considering it's like
The people who blab on about Eva being a deconstruction aren't right but imo they're more right than wrong; it's the clowns who say stuff like gaogaigar was made in response who are just wholesale making stuff up
It kinda was
But at the same time
Just like how madoka wasn't the first edgy magical girl show
Just because other Mecha anime touched some ideas Eva did didn't mean the show wasn't flipping things on its head
You can quibble all you want about the definition of deconstruction but that's pretty immaterial into what it was doing and the impact it had
It is actually just one of the like, 25 most relevant anime ever made
I think you're somewhat right but also underselling the impact it actually had
But I've had to get deep into it the way few people (outside of the nolifers on evageeks) have
I think it's a must watch but not necessarily good
The show will *eventually* explains everything, either explicitly or by clear examples
Just as a warning the first episode is almost disorienting in how much terminology and shit they throw at you and that's somewhat intentional
Shirobako is generally divided into two episode chunks so that works out well I think
Neither cast was particularly compelling to me
It's just one with more character quirks/traits
I see people say a lot that dynazenon has a more fun cast but I can't agree
Rei exists more as a character for asuka to be mad at than she does as an independent actor
It is, imo, the biggest writing fuckup of Eva tv

Half of them aren't human
Well I mean
Not much of a surprise yuri when everyone is eager to spoil it at every corner hours after airing

if millhi's right it's going to be a rocky show though

nut
Destiny isn't just a bad starting point, it's a bad continuing point
Well
Kira is so set up as a villain that the shift to protagonist makes zero sense without context
Destiny is definitely a bad starting point
No
It was kinda weird but frontier did it like 5 years earlier so eh
Less gay and more polyam (in the makeshift harem way)
Very excited for a whole new generation to watch Gundam's habit of the show pivoting into a direction nobody wanted in the third cour
I think your opinion sucks
Respectfully
Anyway
It never ends
Thunderbolt and encounters in space and blue destiny
Lmao there's like 15 man
The exact kind of fetishism he stands against in his works
Basically all of oyw side stories, and the desire for more, are rooted in war fetishism
Ok but bear with me
I bet he hates them
I wonder what tomino's opinion on the never ending oyw side stories are
You know
That's definitely not the consensus of political science courses
It does pretty strongly say federation was the wrong side from day 1
I mean
Unicorn is explicitly "zeon was right actually"
That's all of modern uc
OYW in particular appeases an itch that the magical beam laser franchise rarely does
And yeah, you can tell a story about a soldier's struggles without inserting "look how cool his gun is"
There's others, war survivors, etc
Not mine
But that's your problem to deal with
I'd say it's probably an unethical hobby
Turn A was pretty blatant about it
And of course that's the same impulse tomino calls out as screwing humanity in basically every gundam work
People hunger for the same gritty boots on the ground stories
The one year war lends itself really strongly to the same war fetishism of ww2
A pretty good post that got me thinking
https://www.tumblr.com/sundanceritz/696745260738576384/the-one-year-war-to-me-is-the-setup-and?source=share
It's visited but like, the whole tale is at the end of the war for a reason
It's 0079's backstory
Actually it's not
Again, it's more war fetishism
The latter. He was once asked his opinion on gunpla and he basically said "people would be very unhappy if I answered this question"
America snapped into being a spying police state invading countries super fast
Hell, compare 1998 america to 2005 america
The UK has had insane shifts over 7 year periods
What about 2550 days
Zeta is not saying the federation was always bad, what Zeta *is* saying is extremely explicit in the dahar speech
Zeta is 7 years later and there's a dozen ways to get from A to B
0083 is one of the side stories up for discussion cypher
Unicorn redefines an armed rebellion from an understandable action to an ethically and legally correct one
Nobody is truly a nobody
That's a bad thing to build a story around
Kamille can be annoying but he balances it with being interesting to try to understand
4 cours like always
Because other stories like 0083 do blackwashing
You know, tomino's actual point
Wars enabling bad actors to abuse societies
The story of Zeta is unironically more interesting if you accept it as partially the consequences of zeon's rebellion rather than the milquetoast take of "federation was always bad and was going to oppress people anyway"
The only magic in singing is that of culture shock
But SDF has nothing of the sort
Song Energy was a lot better because it didn't pretend to be anything other than magic
I absolutely detest the magic bacteria angle
I'd say sdf was a lot less cavelier about magic than the kawamori works
Idk
While frontier and Delta have ok songs they're uh, more idol music
7 is also noteable in having a unique soundtrack
Other macrosses aren't totally different but they feel pretty representative of the decade they're made in
Frontier and Delta are distinctly post 00s anime
You'd be wrong blockio lol
I'd only start at Delta if you just really like idol groups
Satelight's done far more insane stuff if that's what you want
It's fine
DYRL is a very pretty work that manages to be not as good as the TV show
Kind of a prick move but eh
Kawamori wasn't involved so he never uses it
Not Invented Here
2 is basically noncanon thanks to NIH syndrome
4 TV anime, 2 OVA that really matters, and a few OVAs and movie versions that kind of matter
that might be why interpretations keep making her gay
honestly while it was definitely 70s fashion, by modern fashion context she's definitely sticking to outfits that aren't really aimed at attracting guys
It's probably for the best, being tied to interpretations limits what you can do
why would she be bi is how I'd flip that
It makes sense with 2077 backstory, it's just funny
absolutely love that it's just straight up dick
A-1 pictures doesn't magically get credit for gundam
You could make an argument that TTGL is trigger (it isn't), but it's definitely not right to just assume that a studio inherits all previous work
Inferno Cop too but I'm willing to accept someone saying "that's not really an anime"
yeah, I distinctly remember LWA was free to watch for a bit
it wasn't
Chris Matoi
no
no, it's not a legal move, no, they don't care
of course, there's also a fighter who just straight up assassinates the competition before they ever make it to the ring
iirc there's a few fighters who have been shamed in previous years by that happening
When you accidentally kill a fighter there's a lot of investigations and stuff
also the finals take place in very close quarters combat so idk if you want to devote the mech's performance to nuclear attacks
Not all that much, really
Well, their gundams are still moderately restricted in what weapons they can use
Humanity turned it to shit before that
G Gundam is the most straight up environmentalist out of all of them

I know someone who can tell you more
just have a hamburger after you watch and all the feelings turn into sunshine
its fineeeeeeeee
the OVAs are the only real exception (0080 is good)
G is so close to having one, but Ultimate/Devil nixes it
Wing has a definition but also violates it repeatedly
The supreme weapon of the super racist faction uses Gundam, it's clearly not that
which uses GUNDAM with a completely new acronym
that theory's blown the fuck out of the water by Destroy
anyway
I don't think it ever gets spoken a single time outside of people reading out loud the bootup screen
I could see that, if the word Gundam had any... use at all in the universe
as they all work off of the same OS, more or less
Quite honestly in SEED basically every federation MS ever made should theoretically be a gundam
it really comes down to "It's a gundam if they print the word gundam on the boxart"
Is the Zeta Plus a gundam? If not, why not? etc.
there really isn't a huge consistency
even internally with like, UC
*the marketing team
still more interested than normal
I'm not holding expectations super high, but to be quite honest my expectations for gundam is generally lower than mid, so
anyway mercury is just danball senki wars but with less ERP and more yuri thanks for coming to my TED talk
it codifies the thing SEED was too lazy to really do and really double down on "yeah it has nothing to do with how they look"
suits
I am free from the Is This A Gundam Discorse
finally
Flushing the definition of Gundam down the toilet
My favorite thing about witch of mercury so far:
fucking laser bastards
the *actual* game can suck my ass
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:796600452585881650>
Bofurees nuts
(the Japanese nationalist pride is funny though)
So far it's a 7/10, not hating it, interested in where it's going
I'm almost done with executioner
"I forgot what good was like" - average Isekai consumer
(but when has super-prototype Gundam ever done that)
It's just very much not how one would approach development in the real world
Which I thought was the point, they're demonstrably up their own ass
Making exactly 72 in order to fit to a modern day mythological reference feels more whimsical to me, honestly
They were slapping ww2 fighting vehicle engines in everything after the war lol
It's got world building pizzaz
"yeah they were going to make a gundam out of these reactors but the war ended so they made a spaceship/gun/colony out of frames 70+ instead"
Imagine
Aw but flip that around
like having a fleet for every sign of the zodiac or something
It's the kind of thing that I'd expect in fiction but not in real life
it's iffy
as I said
I'm glad their military production strategy was guided by the fact they needed to make sure they ended on 72, and not make more or less depending on circumstances
difficult to do when you don't know how many there's going to be
I just wanted a Solomon System or something
yet they're all named after demons and there's exactly 72
considering not every frame was made simultaneously iirc
iffy
it's still a little
what a good set-up, wasted
I'm eternally disappointed IBO never leaned into the demon summoning motif
B Gundam was explicitly "maybe they'll shit their pants and run without realizing it's a Ball" though
sure
which is possibly non-canon and is just an old dude making up a story
I mean that was the idea of the B Gundam
*Ultimate* Gundam even
"we're making a non-combat machine to rejuvinate the earth"
"oh what are you naming it" "oh, Gundam, after the strictly combat machines that have been wrecking the earth"
I appreciate the effort lol
You just have a lineup of like, an anniversary every day
It's almost sad all of these shows drop in the fall lol
That makes more sense
Ok so only 13 episodes before an upgrade
How many cours of mercury are planned?
https://sxtwitter.com/nocontectgitcy/status/1190746266583621636
basically every gundam in the last 20 years has had a major thematic shift for the second half
I saw more people complaining about that than him being black
shaggy being cleaned up isn't shaggy
glad twitter is bravely covering the controversy
HE LOOKS LIKE THOSE DRAWINGS I SEE ON TWITTER OF DREAM AND HIS MINECRAFT FRIENDS
I REALIZED WHAT FRED LOOKS LIKE
GOD
token white dude
oh good LORD
https://twitter.com/FilmUpdates/status/1578101458762928130
no I don't think I've done that in like 2 years
what a good op
the opening owns, honestly
it won't be a wasted 22 minutes, imo
It's probably better to experience it
I haven't had a first episode leave this much of an impression on me since symphogear s1, I think
akiba maid war is in fact something special
I actually thought that one was okay
my condolences
I don't think the evolves are particularly worth people's time, even the one where Amuro fights together with Johnny Ridden in Zeta Pluses
you probably haven't watched it
evolve is an OVA
yes
my favorite zeta thing is that letter he writes in gundam evolve 2
I've always thought part 6 had one of the worst finales of the franchise
no that's definitely part of the whimper
well, they might settle for making it look shit
Considering it's going to be stupid expensive...
a good excuse to never make part 7, I guess
crazy for jojo to go out with a whimper
I'm pretty sure the watermelons were nge
love that song
she was only like 10 when eoe came out lmao
ayahi is the manager
no, maid war
everyone in this anime is a criminal
I like how you picked up on this but not that ayahi has a central role
absolute toptier content to drag a 'normie' into
I think it's more "ew, westerners" coupled with the fact it's just kinda average
(and that has licensing issues)
sadly I don't think it's so much a quality thing - AGE still gets nods
I mean, okay by gundam standards, which are very low

yeah you just described everything in anima
it's still better than anima
what shinji's girlfriend drives

there's very little firmly spelled out
it's not safe to assume it but it's a reasonable assumption
that would be in line with anno's tastes
I assume the movie theaters are footage from screening the compilation movies
it all returns to nothing
child soldiers were probably the true edgelord option though
especially when they were also taking the Angel Hybrid background
yes, exactly
bleeding into each other
So an incredibly common idea would be that not only is the Evangelion particularly close to the character, but they're kind of
you also see this in D&D with barbarians and bards and a few other classes a lot
When your design is focused around pillars of vertical progression you have to choose between, people who don't have a good idea will take it and go "ah, yes, I'll make my character's personality based on this"
like seeing it as an option in the book seemed to make people go "oh, I'll use this and roll with it" and we got a lot of very similar characters over many people's campaigns
you saw a lot of people really tie their character development to the class
so the thing is, for Berserker in particular
yeah, one player could play a Misato character
anyway
(there was also Operations Director, which was probably the most ambitious part of the system)
on paper I feel this sounds reasonable
and Berserker, which is about having Unit 01 or something similar that has a strong bond with you and is more likely to A) berserk and B) berserk effectively
can't remember the name but I remember the role was definitely tanking
yeah, it was
A third one I can't quite remember but I think it was focused on tanking
AT Technician which is using fancy AT Field magic, which is another decision we generally considered a mistake later
they are the best at using melee weapons or guns (generally had to specialize in one or the other)
Skirmisher, which is... bread and butter weapon use
let's see if I can remember them
ah, well, version 2/2.5 of the system relied on 4 pilot 'classes' (and one misato class)
the cannibal berserker was somewhat our fault and it taught me a huge lesson about tabletop design and the limitations of class-based design in a crunch-oriented system
kids being crack troops on the ground is not eva
we did it initially because it makes some sense but
also, using a gun was no longer running off the same stat that using a gun in the eva did
and it's easy enough for a GM to not let you have assault rifles and body armor
Unless you had access to assault rifles and body armor getting into a fight was a really fucking bad idea with death chances measured in the 10%ish range
to heavily discourage
It was initially pretty well implemented but we made it *super* lethal in later versions
of course a skilled GM can make it work but you run into exponential problems the more agency you give the kids
perhaps the biggest is that the pilots can't have agency outside of the robot
but insanely limiting in others
Evangelion is a very fertile ground for roleplay in some areas
the gun created unexpected problems though
there's a lot of that, though the system did enforce flaws and trauma systems to an extent
I also remember Child Soldier with Gun and Cannibal Berserker being other incarnations
the need to not play evangelion when playing evangelion
anyway Trident symbolized one of probably about 3 or 4 really common That Guy incarnations we'd see in games
I sure did learn a lot about tabletop design from it
I still talk to BMJ like every day lmao
hi I was one of the core writers
adeva
it has more to do with the fan project than the design itself though
the mechanical design is fine but I have disdain for them after so many years
I personally don't like tridents that much
the points could be spent on rerolls or fueling power abilities
when you roleplayed to that nature, you got a point (limited by X a scene or something)
in v3 we kind of replaced that with natures and shit where you'd plan some stuff out about your character ahead of time
in v2.5
there definitely was some rollplay concerns but you're also forced to buy a minimum of 15 points of flaws and a maximum, iirc, of 25
buuuut not every game has one
they're the one adult in the room, have a decent keycard, and sometimes even a gun
The other thing that helped with agency was the Operations Director
if you're just there to rollplay, why did you pick adeva
but honestly
to an extent
that's the main drawback to this approach
It does take a little training to get people to learn to decouple the two, though
The *player* does
the PC doesn't need agency
the lesson learned was
We eventually enacted systems in v3 where you could spend metacurrency in order to make some events happen or engineer coincidences
that was probably the #1 concern out of the robot
I could probably write essays about agency in tabletop rpgs
let me think about other interesting lessons learned
(players do not, in the moment, generally want a bad thing to happen, but they do in the abstract, this helps get past that)
giving the GM a ticket to 'fuck me up fam' in exchange for a power boost accomplishes both
both the players and the GM want bad things to happen to the PCs
Both the player and the GM want the players to be cool
I'm a big fan of faustian power bargains in tabletop design
*do you see the conflict*
in other words, their job and skillset was to prevent people from taking damage, and when damage was to be taken, they would try to take it as they had ways to lesson the impact a bit
I mentioned that one of the 4 classes was basically the party tank, focusing on parrying (blocking with shields was the same thing under the rules, generally)
Oh right let me bring up another issue with the Berserker class
During the development of v3, the more grognard players wanted more crunch and the developers were realizing they were already at a threshold of too much crunch so there was drama and it split into two versions, v3 and vBorderline, which was basically v2.5 Mk II
less than you'd think, the Trident is usually the sexier option and by v3 we had evangelion frame options that included on-board nuclear reactors anyway
but I maintain it's better than a super form
It upset a lot of people because they viewed berserk more as a power fantasy rather than Bad Shit
more or less that's how the new berserk went, a faustian bargain
"If the players are losing and they consent to this, one of them can go Berserk and roll on this table. You automatically win the fight, but the collateral damage is determined by this table and the GM also gets to fuck you all in the ass with an unseen consequence later depending on how nasty the situation was, including killing beloved NPCs"
We stripped that out and replaced it with basically a sidebar
It used to be, with the right talents, basically a superform you could sometimes enter if your Sync ratio was high and you were taking critical damage etc etc *etc*
probably the most controversial thing we did was change the Berserk mechanic in v3
by v3 the angel gets to move after every player
by 2.5 most angels designed to be actual threats were going 2-3 times in a row
action economy was basically 90% of balance consideration tbh
> I imagine that there was some sort of limit of how many attacks an angel could make per turn
it affects the whole-ass theming
and not just because it affects how the dice fall
I learned very strongly that the rules you print in the book influence the games that get played
not because the rules were bad but because the GM would have to account for this in more games than not
It was a little bit of a design headache but the bigger one was that publishing rules for them in the main book literally made the average game worse
so generally the players who are picking these units are coming with other problems anyway
the main reason you're picking the unit is to be a fuckin hipster
and at the end of the day
but it's not a good thing to *design*
and there is *room* in the system for someone to rely on other units to do all the nullifying
right
players will just use 6000 tanks
because otherwise...
In the system basically all angels have enough of an AT Field to invalidate conventional weapons
AT Fields are the major problem here
this more or less fixed the Berserker issue especially since we also stuck *most* of that in Evangelion frame traits rather than pilot traits
this encouraged you to kinda build your own role, but also encouraged you to not overly generalize (generalized roles are basically always bad tabletop design)
you had to buy into a branch, and then you could buy upgrades from the branch
anyway with version 3 we kept some ideas but split up the 'classes' into packages we called 'branches'
but they weren't as homogenous as the berserker kid who would eat someone's arm in a scene at some point in the game
it's always fun revisiting it as a jrpg bossfight
the desert arc isn't really that important if we're not counting its impact on kira
and honestly
most strategy game depictions of SEED reduce it to about 12 important fights and I feel that's about right
yep
uninteresting
it definitely makes the anniversary posts
they pretty much all do
yeah they'll probably do one for Great
so 2 at a time is fine
it means the cour climaxes definitely occur at a good spot
it's probably fine to continue as you were planning
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
in fact, going odd complicates things later so
but either way it'll probably be fine, honestly
it should work out if you watch an odd number of episodes one day
that's why I'm bringing it up so you could... change that... if you wanted?
hm just to warn you I think the two episode blocks are off-set to what you're watching, so you're more or less always going to end on a cliffhanger for the first cour
all I can see is nono from diebuster
I could see it but it's not even a good shit post style
Obari is great as long as you never let him draw humans
Yep
https://twitter.com/G1_BARI/status/1578794631914848256?t=iF9YNg55qiIJUmycWzW4PQ&s=19
*checks Twitter*
Oh god did they bring obari back for more
Gravion looked so goddamn good in Z
Them replacing Renton with movie Renton....
Man and tri formation system was so good too
Maybe they could have done alpha/z1 maps but eh
Z3 was also portable
Z2 didn't either
Z1 was the height of the franchise and Z2 was a very respectable handheld followup
That's the whole sentence, really
Also it's a shame that Z3
Man it's such a shame Setusko's upgrade is nowhere near as cool
<:blobcatthumbsup:575405440452526091>
Wooo yeah
DarkShad, pretty please?
V was
True, I would have sworn no ps2 srw would get tled, but we got one
Do you mind putting <> around the link
Probably never will be
Hm bad thumbnail, there's someone here I've been streaming srw z to and we haven't hit the event yet...
Not tonfas, khatars
Er
It also has chainsaw tonfas on the shoulders and nunchuck spanners

Generic pretty boy with green hair
It looks nothing like him

Speaking of obari massacring character designs
It has his weird melty eyes
It's him
This feels like blasphemy
Angelg is a great design
It irritated basically everyone
Melted wax
Anime version
Game version (this came first by about 9 years)
He put nipples on a robot that didn't have them in game for srw
Which has absolutely atrocious character design
You wouldn't necessarily; he's done non hentai anime like srw OG Inspectors
20% of it is thick particle physics kanji that you have to be a graduate student to know
It's very I'm 14 and this is deep
It also tickles the cyberpunk itch like most cyberpunk works don't
It's a non-shit anime with an actual complete story and good animation, it doesn't happen often
But anima is just really expensive fanfiction
I mean you do you
I do not recommend caring about evangelion noncanonical side content
You're getting too deep
ended up with a silly starting premise and a startling decent backbone at the end
I think it was something apocalypse
nah angelic days was the boring highschool one
It's weird how the manga that is "what if shinji was a high schooler with a Glock" ends up being one of the best side material
That's in design notes for the show and even showed up in srw once
The only bit of anima that's even semicanon is the existence of type f equipment for unit 01
I forgot about this bit
||This setting feels a lot more japanese inspired than most gundams; a zaibatsu more or less ruling space||
||It could also be using the east asian age system which would mean she's actually 16||
||17 was probably a partial necessity to have a sufficient time gap between prologue and events||
||wow, an entire episode without combat||
it'll be resolved in 13 episodes and bleach will be gone forever
anime is different now
haha, all of you are old
They should have stopped having combat with the same reasoning
it was overused
Same goes for the combat, really
well they only had 3
yeah all the songs in SDF were just minmei being a normal idol
if you haven't designed your world around the science of your magic (sandersonian, I guess you could say) from the ground up, introducing science into your magic later is almost never going to go well
it also brings up questions of why they don't try to 'enrich' jedi and make jedi and the more you explain them the worse the implications get
It's a handicap of the series but if you're going to have space wizards, the biggest crime you can make is to make them boring
into something bacteria has
especially since it removes the Force from something *you* have
they don't need to be explained and it's a mistake to do so
but the thing is
They didn't really bother me on first viewing too much as a kid
supremely hard, mind you - you still have space warps and brainscanning to make AIs and shit like that
which still isn't like
Plus is probably as hard as macross ever gets
no I mean from Plus
That would be the opposite direction
It doesn't
I liked both 7 and plus a lot and they went exact opposite directions with realistic science
frontier and especially delta really crossed the 'midichlorian' threshold of "don't overexplain magic, especially if it's a dumb explaination"
also, gear never asks that you take its science seriously
so it doesn't stick out quite as much
I think the difference is that gear didn't start out trying to play nice with science
delta is definitely a cry for help from kawamori that people should stop letting him write science fiction
I could just talk to my sister instead
I meant the store
Forgot that's destined to suck now
Oh right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1XaPTByDmk
and I didn't even have good songs on my first viewing
I definitely remember the animation making me roll my eyes more lol
There were like 4 cuts they stuck in any time there was a fight and called it a day
||reminder that okouchi did not write utena, they wrote the novelization||
||I expect it to be more dramatic bullshit twists rather than endless suffering||
||No matter how much yuri they've done, the thing okouchi is most successful with is doing horrible things to characters for the sake of drama||
||that said I will probably be on Aerial's side no matter how many bodies of allies she racks up||
||possibly Suletta instead though; there's no way the p-met drawback never comes into play ever again with Aerial||
||Expecting Miorine to get permanently disfigured by an Aeriel datastorm at some point||
We'll see
(though chest weaponry is cooler)
If they unfold they're great
Ngl I think my biggest complaint with belly cannons is they're boring because they don't move
It's the thing mounted over the cockpit
Ex-s did it and it makes sense
If you can power a battleship cannon you can power a field that covers the torso
Anyway something that makes more sense than belly cannons since I'm being asked directly: small i-field generators
Except when the unit has to half transform and unfold to use it
I just don't think belly cannons are that cool normally on "realistic" units
Gone, usually
And half the time they're this diffuse beam shit which really doesn't make sense as a space weapon
I mean they never look good
They're always so tacky, abdomen cannons
it should be an OVA or TV series
yeah, but it shouldn't
Eugh
stuff like steel seven and ghost are like saying Zeta and CCA are part of MSG
Crossbone itself is a much smaller story
no it's fine
tobia isn't even the only blind gundam pilot
man
at least seabook got to keep one of his eyes
worked out less great for tobia though
X also went well, though Tifa got kidnapped a lot
Turn A as well
There's been several relationships that have worked out well
Especially since touya is wrong
It's fine
||I'm pretty sure it's ~~elon~~ elan, considering he actually has a Gundam according to materials||
||as beyond the time starts playing||
||I don't think the school will be the setting for cour 2||
||I'm expecting Guel, and most of the rest of the school, to be protagonist ally candidates by the end of this cour||
||some sort of p-met 5||
||I mostly expect a data storm disfigurement because I think that's going to be part of whatever super form we get||
||Aerial not getting shredded would probably be the biggest shock tbh, there's been like.... A maximum of 4 or 5 Gundam series where the protag suit has been fine after the end||
||I expect the two girls to live, at least one to be disfigured by datastorm, and aerial to be destroyed||
The last highly successful Gundam show killed most of the main cast, but I don't see this going that way
||I'd expect someone to make a severe sacrifice but still live at some point||
||okouchi did, however, write code Geass and valvrave||
tokyopop releases would make a very big deal that "You're reading this book the wrong way!"
the early 00s manga scenes *relished* in how Japanese they were
yeah, but anime dubbing and manga sales are trying to hit two different audiences
it's fine
tokyopop released them for a few years

and girls generally have existed just to be tortured
I don't think we've ever had a girl char for example
G Witch is probably going to break a lot of rules
crossbone isn't the deepest story
as long as they animate the ABC mantle properly they can't actually fuck it up
it was never a good story
I don't know nor do I care
well, it's two films
probably either the final assault on earth, or the crossbone raid on Io
You'd have to cut out something to make it a good film
stuff where collateral damage isn't really a concern
they basically *only* respond to stuff like cyberpsychosis incidents
tbf MaxTac isn't spec ops exactly
TT is awesome and it exists because Pondsmith needed a revive system for characters
but you're still held accountable for all actions
it's not
Not that being a cyberpsycho is a crime
It's basically rot in prison or work in maxtac
most of them are 'reformed' cyberpsychos
Edgerunners never actually clued into the one big lore detail of Maxtac
When Maxtac *pulls out*, you're in deeper
it was great
It was a single missable line in Edgerunners
I still love the detail that Maxtac has "code AS" as an emergency code for whenever Arasaka gives Adam a contract
||Adam Smasher is notorious as the final boss of many cyberpunk campaigns||
honestly it's deeper than that
yeah, they patched it into ||The Afterlife bar selection||
the boy ||has a drink named after him, he's a Somebody||
I was counting her lmao
I guess 3 if you count delamain
and one never even gets named
2 characters from 2077 in it
edgerunners is absolutely one of the best videogame adaptations of all time, and there's all of like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs 2077 even has a trailer about a psycho becoming maxtac (of hilarity, please note both when this was uploaded and also the marked release date in the video)
I'm not lying, that's the canonical answer
Therapy
And another one of them was done by a netrunner to be executed by a non-netrunner
and one of them was by a non-netrunner
3 times total
I think they use cyberdecks like
they invented "Quickhacks" as a system
that's due to 2077's videogame nature
oh
Edgerunners is set in 2077 where they no longer use shit like external decks most of the time
what do you mean
though apparently my life is a lie and it's fujita
but Katoki and Nagano's styles have never really meshed
I think it looks bad
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
idk if the anime will get to it
well
the death has a reason
there's more going on under the hood than they're revealing
if this is your first time with muvluv
the girls don't really have the range to do basara's screams
totsugeki planet explosion is maybe the best song I've heard from macross though; shame there isn't a version with just fire bomber
Transformations
It's fine to use stock footage every episode if it fuckin owns
Symphogear xv is probably the only show where I was as hyped to see stock footage as I was for ggg
I've never examined GGG in this way
I'll have to give this some thought because J-decker was definitely heavy on some religious ideas and moral philosophy in spots
about 1% of japan identifies as christian so they're generally not the first choice for religious nods in anime anyway
There might be religion in GGG, but I don't think it's christianity
||Their desire to wipe the universe clean of them just has such a strong parallel to jesus forgiving all sin that putting that as the villain motivation doesn't match up with Mamoru making everyone have a spiritual moment and bring guy back from the dead||
If anything, the ||fight against the Z-Master is a rejection of conventional Christianity; Minus Thoughts make us human and are part of us and shouldn't be wiped away||
But I don't *think* this is it, because it's so spotty throughout the work
and there's an argument to be made that he's ||delivered from the realm of man to the realm of spirituality, since he's no longer machine and is now organic||
the ||rebirth|| still does
well, the ascension part doesn't
that doesn't hold water
because I doubt FINAL existed as a story idea
If we're treating TV as its own thing
hmmm
I think the biggest counterargument is that the rest of the cast doesn't reflect that kind of story at all
But it's nothing like CS Lewis or anything
Hm, I don't know, there's definitely a little bit of religious handling of Mamoru, I'll have to ponder that
(Zonder metal absorbing your stresses and taking them away from you)
Viewed in the context of christianity, the bad guys have more to do with jesus than anything
I generally chewed on this for a bit but I think it's probably too loose and is probably inspired by something else instead
the power of za powa
anyway if you're at the verge of dropping the series I'll just give you context for later in the story ||Time travel/resets become involved||
||three, except the other one is still a clone lmao||
||Kira does have a new type flash when using strike freedom, which is weird considering super dragoons don't need spacial awareness||
like the mobius zero
but it's never labelled beyond that and never leaned into aside from some weaponry being made for enhanced spacial awareness
you'll see the newtype flash once in a while and you'll see references to people having "enhanced spacial awareness"
I actually find it really interesting newtypes exist in SEED, are never really labelled, and just kind of do their thing ignored by the giant racist feud
I suppose
Mwu is a newtype, Kira's SEED factor is... something else
SEED isn't newtype fwiw
There's like, a moment in Destiny that technically he didn't even need to be a newtype to do
no, especially since kira doesn't do much newtyping at all
kira flay moments
not great not terrible
the way the show is just straight up find/replacing the words "yakuza" for "maid" is pretty great
maid ptsd
ok time for maid
Fuck mirage colloid though
I felt the kitbash nature was cool
Idk
One of those "I'm kind of a selfish self-serving bitch but threats to the world undermine my personal business" kind of deals
Done ok
Mina has a slow redemption arc
Yeah
It's a little too on the nose
I've never really read it but Mina passes it to the protagonist
A literal whitewashing of the family
And also the metaphor is a little too vomit inducing for me
But the black looks better
Like I don't hate it
White and yellow don't mix well imo
Gold frame mina was basically perfect
That's still less dumb than destiny having shining finger, I'll give it a pass
I'm on mobile I'm not watching this shit
Oh it's a gif
This is a bad screenshot
Mars and onwards it gets atrocious
Up through x astray at least
Astray's plot isn't significantly worse than most gundam
You can be wrong
Everything in vs astray is scraped out of a litterbox
Er I thought that was the name of the series, it's vs astray, whatever
Absolutely fucking terrible
We don't talk about mirage
Actually two more if you include the dude from the MSVs who shows up, Morgan or whatever
Though Astray has one more of note
||The stage restarts twice from scratch||
I'm fine with resurrection because it gave me one of the most amusing srw stages in years
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
CG completely fucks a central character motivation though so
Because they're not technically compilation films, they're completely reanimated
But that's not really fair
Nanoha
There's that too
Ore wa gundamu da
just play dynasty warriors and ask taro to make more fucked up characters for whatever his next game is
I'm not sure why you'd want one
Idk they both are packed full of feminine men
Speaking of CG, witch of mercury is good so far <:NononSmug:651876302412054548>
Anyway fran is good
Unless we're really supposed to marvel at how cool it is they're combining these two boring powers into another boring power
It feels like someone was writing one of those 4chan quests and turned it into a story
Definitely one of those Isekai where the video gamification isn't helping more than it's hurting
I guess I'll see, I'm sure I'll be dragged through more later
I think making the sword the protagonist overall is a miscalculation
*be better* if it was just a random sentient sword instead of isekai
The story would just
So I was shown the first two episodes of reincarnated as a sword and like, I don't get it
I mean she wouldn't be the first Gundam pilot lol
Also Tobia Arronax has a lot of that Gundam name energy without being a shit name
Tobia is one of my favorite protagonists
Hell, gundam with random kids falling into the cockpit works better
It has relevance in the narrative and it's a *specific* kind of power fantasy you cannot serve by making him a hereditary pilot
I think the main thing it was missing is buying parody rights to mention various shows
"I love Mecha so much I wish I woke up and they were real" is a niche I think k&m serves
No, I don't think I buy it for this
There is now more sword and less reincarnation
Which is... Removing the isekai if anything
Literally the only time I've seen them reference the fact it's isekai is when the sword is surprised it doesn't mind murder anymore
Not even really how video games work
Sword has used basically no knowledge from home
Anyway this category *can* be written without isekai, generally involving amnesia or time travel (I guess that's basically isekai though)
Ehhhhhhhhhhh
There are other ways to do it, but it's not all egregious power fantasy
Re:zero does enough with the rewinding I think the isekai aspect makes sense from a writing point of view
"my robot should fly because it's cool when they fly in my robot shows" is why it flies
It's the central idea
Like
Beyond that, it matters that he's watched robot anime
Oh my god I just realized when they remade og Gundam, Sayla became Cagalli, who is again victim of off screen drama
Lots of hints suggesting she was probably going to be a lot more involved in UC
Only due to drama
Chen is important to my heart
but also I don't think any games labelled SD Gundam have tried to have a real story that isn't just mashing shit together since, what, monoeye?
I get having an irrational bugbear
~~what story~~
the franchise *is* like SDGF
when
but like, you apparently get annoyed that people assume the franchise is like SDGF
I mean that's fine
I mean, yeah, stripped down SD Gundam is just putting them in super deformed, and SRW (up through maybe Z) is an SD Gundam work too, but
SDGF frankly comes closer
I don't really think *either* G Gen or GBA are particularly representative of the SD Gundam 'identity'
and three kingdoms adaptations
SDGF
shitpost 4koma-style 80s OVAs
SD Gundam falls in 3 categories
to do with *any* SD gundam animated content
fuckall
G Gen and GBA have
to be fair
oh, I've never seen crossrays abbreviated like that
what games
my only real objection to SDGF is I fucking hate Captain's normal mode mouth flap
there's less sex jokes than the old SD gundam OVAs but you do still get three kingdoms content
imo it's a good introduction to SD Gundam though
just, not that low
I think it's still below the waterline, mind you
for something that aired on syndicated american television
SDGF is definitely too low
so don't be intimidated by this list
gundam for the sake of more gundam rather than trying to tell good stories
Also most of this is like
and no one talks about them
95% of things listed on this graph are kinda shit
you go from "baby's first gundams" to "spinoffs" immediately
this whole chart is just a bit weird
doozybots is not above the waterline
I mean, if we're to consider the modern anime viewer, I doubt most people have heard of Leiji Matsumodo
The way to do them is either to make them stocky like the Tieren or mix in skinny bits like the S Gundam to imply that the parts with mass are big because they have big components inside them
I like chunky robots - big o and various supers are right up my alley - but the Gundam units that are just awkwardly large for the sake of having big plating just look bad and awkward
<:NononSmug:651876302412054548>
Nah
Exia nails the lean look the best but I'm pretty happy with Aerial
Zoids
at the end of the day, the things seed did well can be found elsewhere
at the end of the day a 4 cour series in this day and age needs to be better than 'okay', imo
At the end of the day SEED isn't awful but I also don't think it's worth the 24 hours of your life it's going to consume by watching it
special edition helps... a little...? but the added footage just replaces things without making pacing better
there's a few things that really drag down SEED, stock footage and flashbacks are probably one of the biggest
way more relevant to pop team epic
the fact that it's the obari pose is just
also
(because the common factor here is Obari)
between dancouga and machine robo
Ashi Productions is at least as relevant here
I mean, even besides that
'sunrise stance' in particular bugs me a bit
Obari pose*
you might also be thinking of tom scott's
it was more the statement that Fukuda should get the credit that I was replying to there

this is from machine robo in 86
idk whether Akiba will be worth your time as a series, but imo episode 1 is worth it standalone
absolute blast
akiba maid war 3 was great
it might be a gundam ref
SWN was made well after unicorn, I'll point out
Bring Stabity is still my favorite because I'm convinced it's an error and was supposed to be Bring Stability
Anew Returner, Regene Regetta, Revive Revival
00s2 is probably the most "please just stop" of them all but it also feels like they were trying too hard
though Banagher is a pretty top-class gundam name because it's complete nonsense
if there's anything unicorn definitely did right, it's coming up with the stupid fucking name of Full Frontal
quattro is normally localized "bajeena" instead of vagina but you can translate the katakana either way
and of course there's the 'what are you serious' trio of quattro vagina, jamitov hymen, and elpeo puru
also shoutout to Fatman Big
I feel like it's L-Gaim but it's from somewhere
a questionable approach to discussions but sure why not
by that logic, Revue Starlight the anime is also a gacha
well sure they're going to make money
It is overwhelmingly Theater Kid
and that people slap that label onto it because their terminally weeb brains just assume that everything singing in anime has to be related
I honestly feel there's very little idol in Revue
if there's a fluent russian girl in an anime in the last 10 years it's likely to be her
it's Jenya
her VA's backstory
her backstory is just
the russian chick from the newest ep of maid war
oh my god
maid war 3 spoilers ||though after 3 we might possibly have hints of yuri???||
they are definitely completely different genres lol
passion for the chance to yell at people that bullets are cooler than beams etc etc etc
passion for edgy stories
L-gaim and dunbine blend together for me
that's right, it was dunbine
I think most of the internet was just watching it for anya and yor though
have a better plot etc
with PA works it could be better on some fronts, tbh
I mean this feels like someone read spy x family and went "I can do that"
but, well, I think you see the problem
animators spend their whole working lives studying human anatomy
and joints
You animate movement partially by understanding muscles
nobody important anyway
0080 had pretty normal names
yeah pretty much
they wouldn't notice
people have been making fun of shit like Fatman Big for ages
people definitely question it out of universe
in another one he named someone Killer The Butcher
in a non-gundam anime he did there's a character named Amandra Kamandra
this is tomino's fault
it took you 5 hours but you hit the predictable response eventually
Symphogear
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basquash!
no sex is on screen but they're lovers
Moar Pharaoh
and then he fucks fucking what was her name
don't forget he's *dating* a girl named *Lyla Mira Lyla*
G-Witch and Maid War ||This is really just the week of girls punching each other for my entertainment isn't it||
G-witch || GIRLS üëè PUNCHING üëè GIRLS||
Good
Hm the flag was fukuchi
Is this the same mechanical designer as the overflag
||possibly. It just also feels Okouchi.||
||What was important about that scene was it's impact on guel, not Suletta, and that's the thing they immediately yanked back||
||I was never talking about the rejection||
||"I humiliated myself and my family out there but I didn't mean it" is just the dumbest thing to hit on 5 minutes later||
||I don't think it would be that odd. I legitimately am losing faith in the narrative if they're immediately going "you know I was jk right???" with a straight face. Only time will tell if guel's jk or going to be a male tsundere potential love interest, though||
I didn't think about this until now
||we're getting okouchi'd where cliffhangers don't actually fucking matter, this is not promising||
Oh god
But I'm guessing bleach people
I do not know these people
Hasn't basically every pokemon title besides black and white been hot vs cold color
That's the silverion hammer and goldion Magnum etc shit
They have the blockaded numbers content!
Oh fuck!
Though the enthusiasm is appreciated
Kyle I'm not sure you need to post every tweet in the tweet chain
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
The actual anime is trash
It'd be worthless if it didn't
I think she's going to be one of the final bosses
Ice and fire will happen within the next 10 years
it's a treehouse of horror episode, so...
pop team epic is the only thing keeping akiba from being the shitpost show of the season
remember, they're doing split cour for gwitch
that wouldn't explain why they're delaying birdie wing to run at the same time as cour 2
I forgot how good this scene was
purposely tell writing conventions to fuck off
these episodes are so insane because they just like
god
I don't think she has to be your type to be your favorite
also credit to PA Works for making the 'best girl' of the show 35 years old
every other episode
crunchy does
knives as glowsticks
fucking
it might be the best first episode of anything I've ever seen
yes
more OPs should do that, honestly
that's the assumption everyone made yeah
I'm really tempted to put akiba as the best OP/ED of the season, if we're including visuals
enjoy
you're not even at the best part of the episode
god
it's so good
yes
||You could easily have a season 2, it would just need to be about a different group of edgerunners||
so bocchi is just komi-san but good right
this explains nothing.
yeah
it was almost a shitpost, on the level of "draw the circle, now draw the rest of the image"
suletta         ü§ù      bocchi 
        being total goobs
probably, but only if you don't count mio marrying suletta as a meme
chuchu drops the hard n for spacian
next 6 cuts
they're very careful to draw her passed out in the same position in the like
oh weird
I can spot the gags but some of it seems to flow a little too well to be rips of 4komas
a little? a lot?
bocci is a 4koma, right? How much is the anime creating to flesh it out?
they tried their best to match the style but digital animation just doesn't hit the same as cel
Imagine a compilation movie of a 1980s TV show, but half the footage is made new in 2006
Zeta's movies are... more controversial
but it's... interesting
the original TV series does not hold up to such a glowing standard
the original movies are unironically still one of the absolute best gundam productions
The best part about the movie is ||having to do the srw 30 stage three times||
Ye millhi beat me to it but I feel most studios are kinda obvious most of the time (with the possible exception of The Born, which is a mostly clean anagram for Bones in Japanese)
I can't quite see the right but it's probably the same
Love
That's ai in the left
Idol Master xenoglossia basically flopped and it was the same idol + robot combo as Macross
"there was a popular if a bit niche idol show" does not translate to "idol shows are popular"
I'd still say idol shows weren't popular
Obviously there's a lot of time for the series to go south but this cast is promising to be the most likeable cast since, idk, G Gundam
||boy tsundere in g-witch, who knew||
"Does it say Gundam on the model kit box"
there is only one true rule on what's a gundam
it just makes a new internal rule
no, IBO breaks rules on what a gundam is
but every rule has been broken
I could give you a list of things that make something a gundam
There *is* a series where gundams outnumber non-gundams, but bandai told the director "give us as many gundams as possible because our studies show they sell better"
(they did not sell more by making them all gundams, it was, shockingly, the fact that gundams are generally protagonist units that caused the correlation)
the term for mechs in gundamverses is generally "Mobile Suits"
never has been
~~they'd be broke~~
rick dias is 100% a gundam they just don't call a gundam
rick dias though
(this is not a view I agree with but it's a point you shouldn't make carelessly)
(you can actually argue that the gerbera tetra and hyaku shiki et all aren't actually gundams because the blueprints have been modified past the concept)
because the marketing is the only true real aspect of gundam
except the model kit box
right
this is a non point
so's the rick dias
it's not generally considered a gundam as a result
exactly
like seed
~~except when it doesn't~~
the death army does complicate things but they're both mooks and also part of a gundam anyway
G
no that's the political drama
it's bizarre and an adventure
solo have you heard of this great shounen series
"I'm smart so I'm entitled to change the world" is definitely a theme though
yeah reasonable
you'd have to foot the bill because it's unlikely to make any individual studio money
Kaiju, space opera, mecha, magical girl?
Isn't this just genres?
I don't think the intent matters for the conversation *I* was having, which was fan-centric, not author-centric
I think y'all are having a different conversation
I don't think anyone here ever called them on the same level
It might be
the intent of the content is less relevant than the people it attracts for this comparison
again, this is kind of in the "so what" category I think
unless you're denying that code geass is a "I have a 200 IQ" power fantasy
I don't think that's really as relevant as you think though
also shows like bofuri
I think that's also comparable to a degree
power fantasy that being smarter than other people magically solves problems
is code geass rick and morty for anime fans
they wouldn't do this if everything was fine, and if there are problems in the macro sense, there are problems in the micro sense
so episode 7's fucked huh
I haven't seen all the vivid stuff but the stuff I've seen didn't impress me, personally
Shout out to Gravion
considering this is probably sunrise's most important project over a 5 year period (looking both backward and foward) that's not great!
we have a recap episode for the 7th episode
idk, maybe I just missed alice in wonderland hype
sweeny todd is probably the most recent
average IBO enjoyer
lmao
gravion is a pureblood super robot where all conventional forces are useless and only the technology of the singular super robot has any effect
episode 1
Same VA
Oh my god amuro is tuxedo mask
<@191380322754101249> stop bein a weirdo count this as a warning
very cool and shiny bricks used to build a boring wall that's on the verge of collapsing
I don't even hate the ending, but the plot is pretty terrible, the sexual nature is borderline repulsive coming off of GGG, there's a lot of stuff that feels a bit out of character, and the retconning of how G-stones works actively makes the TV show worse
yeah, the individual action shots are great and episode 1 is a perfectly fine epilogue to the TV show
gaogaigar is one of those shows that did everything perfect to the point that the OVA followup ends up lessening it
~~I could live without final~~
anime got good with sun and moon is what I heard
I'd compare it to the Carpenter version of The Thing
yeah
yes, but actually no
it always amuses me when people talk about masamune shirow being the creator of gits because like
it was an excuse to draw women with tits in catsuits
I can't remember if he fought amuro in steel 7 or skullheart
even while the show is trash
what kills me is the songs are pretty good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtGL5yKdSCk
the epitome of 90s pop

this is not a shitpost
this is what the tv show was like

oh god
||I expect they'll have to pay a penance but we'll see||
the anime industry really prefers shorter shows these days, wouldn't be surprised if gundam goes shorter
The birthday episode of akiba was so good
God
You could probably draw some comparisons to the R Daneel Olivaw novels, but the similarities aren't overwhelming
The setting isn't much like other gundams outside of the fact that Earth and space hate each other
Gwitch has nothing so far to do with old Gundam shows outside of play with recurring tropes (masked character, artificially enhanced humans, probably psychic powers eventually idk)
Not knowing that amuro fought mquve in the gyan is not going to change your life
There's some things that happen in the TV series that are canon that aren't in the movies but you do not have to care
Crunchyroll doesn't do movies, like almost ever
TV series that got made into compilation movies, and remain as perhaps the best compilation movie project in anime history
G-witch episode 6 spoilers
||Or sync isn't needed because Aeriel doesn't need to increase P-met score on itself, because Suletta isn't strictly piloting it||
||the Eri-L theory is at least nonsense, I don't think they would put the extra "a" syllable in the Gundam if they were going with that||
||Did she say she didn't have a dad or that her dad died young||
Preserved roses was ok but also was just every other tm revolution song
I think it does
Surefire way to get a crap plot
"cours 3 and 4 if it sells well" terrifies me btw
A few days ago in this channel
There is definitely a level of "that is a twist and the story is worse off for it"
The author's prior works involve a giant robot that piloting it makes you into a space vampire who rapes people btw
A twist that doesn't develop themes or complexity in a meaningful way that brings emotional depth to the story is very surface level
||Reminder that Okouchi is completely capable of writing sensationalist trash||
||that would be a valvrave level twist of "woah, but this doesn't make the story better"||
||reeks of "only humans can be special"||
||I think there's definitely something deeper but I kinda hope it's not "eri got stuck in the machine," that's lame and boring compared to "aerial is just a chad AI little sister"||
||Just because aerial has an astral form doesn't mean it belongs to a human||
Assuming everyone involved lives, which isn't a given
Excited for this all to be massive bait and we get some shit platonic friend ending
nah there's worse
||https://twitter.com/vertellerbarach/status/1589377501868216320||


Toki wo koete isn't really bandai's to use anymore
Might be op rights
Like Naruto?
(I'm also sick of it in srw)
I just think it's still pretty eh, especially the non ishikawa stuff
You're right in that it's the best of the lot
In fact, in the strictest sense, that's what the term means
Just because they make shit up doesn't mean they're not adapted from the source
I'd still count them as adaptations
We just had one last year
Eh there's like 5 now?
Imo Armageddon gets over hyped in particular because the second half of the show kinda sucks
I'm not a fan of getter adaptations
Other than that yeah
Shin Mazinger Z has fairly modern anime pacing, though skip the first episode if you do as it's a really weird avant garde experiment of playing almost the entire final episode as episode 1
I feel like there's a joke there of an ibo fan only liking skl
Might have liked it more if mazinkaiser skl never happened
I like it but don't like zero's design itself too much
So did I
that final fight imagery is seared into my skull
I remember bokurano's art the most
I do recall a lot of toes being posted when it first aired
but *it isn't the character*
I can see how he got there
like

let me get what she's looked like in game for 10 years before that
now
another of her from the show
key visual from the show
there are other flaws too but it has its heart in the right place
couldn't he have gotten *someone* other than him to do charadesign?
it's clearly a passion project for Obari but like
The Inspector is something I have a loooooooot of mixed feelings on
oh, and the other anime appearance, they just went ahead and used CG for the full anime in like 2006 so it's not pretty
fair
lol
Obari's crack at it for the SRW anime 10 years later
the source material
the anime
also imo I think the mechanical design super suffered
but that's literally the plot of the ramiel fight
in a non dynamic pose even
they will have a static image of a mech just slide to the right with afterimages to represent dodging an attack
the mechs can do dragonball z style instant transmission moves because the animation budget is so bad they can't animate the mechs actually moving
even if you're *not* familiar with the source material so you're unaware of how badly it's been murdered, it's not a great show
who do you *talk* to
akiba maid war..............
was terada's plan
should be
srw next year hopefully
some of the time
wait no masaki is the pilot
off model 100% of the time
the inspector is just
Masaki is a side character that barely shows up and is not the pilot of cybuster in the show
'best boy' isn't in *his own damn show*
tbf
why would you hire luke skywalker to play *the joker*
I mean
troy baker probably did the best not-hamill hamill
he's appearing as thomas wayne in an upcoming batman tv series but I do not know if he will be using his batman voice
what a terrible legacy
kevin conroy died??????
what the fuck??????
honestly from what I've seen the pikachu fight was one of the Most Shounen things
ash ketchum putting the champ in pogchamp
Bane in particular was pretty shit
some parts were really good, but a lot of their villain interpretations kinda sucked
The Batman was alright
https://tenor.com/view/savingprivateryan-ww2-old-soldier-matt-damon-gif-4203998
Sakura Quest's ending bumped it up a point for me iirc
Wep
Diebuster spends most of it's run not listening to its own themes when episode 6 suddenly comes in and reaffirms the core themes out of nowhere
Also diebuster, for final episodes affecting total score
I mean it's plain text but it's unrequited
21st, apparently
wouldn't that be like, 12th place
Better keep it away from jamitov hymen
'interesting'
ah, everyone's a psychic
"oh my god the enemy actually has a spotter!" is as crazy as the show generally got
There was nothing crazy about the plays being made for basically the whole show
It was "normal tank combat" for most of the show
Not until the final two episodes
Yeah but GuP tv didn't have bonkers tank action
While neither are amazing anime, haifuri at least aimed to do something with screentime
I contrast GuP with haifuri
nothing in gup matters either
tbf
the pros are if it goes well the company gets to make more money and you get to see more side content; the cons are that you have to engage a lot harder to get the full picture. Yusha decided to spread its story into a bunch of light novels after its first anime season, and then when they tried to put the canon light novels into another season, the production fell apart because the LNs just weren't written with the pacing or length of an anime season in mind
the poster child of the failures of a multimedia project
did anyone actually like blend s or was it just the op
~~the show feels like it could take a heterosexual right turn at any moment~~
thats why you have to give the robots heart
miorine's dad is the president of the zaibatsu yeah
but it's still the norm to not be east asian
so there's a handful
yeah
that's kind of a big one
oh, kira yamato
he's just a side 7 spacenoid
canadian by descent
well
only ones I can think of are mikazaki and shiro amada
canadian
well, east asian
gundam protags have almost never been asian
yes
this is true for me a little bit, but honestly that's mostly because ||AI in a gundam is exciting and new. Dead/comatose person trapped in a gundam is an idea they've played out before and one I'm less interested in seeing. ||
it's okay, instead we have people not even aware part 6 came out
I've heard a netflix release schedule isn't any nicer - some things are easier, but other things run into crunch all at the same time
if you wanted hype you'd release weekly
you can't hype us netflix
Witch spoilers: ||While I'm unsure we'll see actual psychics in Gwitch, Elan's already basically filled the role. Most of the psychic love interests are also medical experiments to artificially create a psychic/someone who can handle the special bullshit, so we've already seen the trope play out to a degree||
generally one a season
yes
I mean it still would have been shit but at least mobile dolls would be a political statement
wing would have hit harder if it was released during the second gulf war
well, less evil and more "ooo dangers of technologyyyy"

At least one of those is only isekai as a result of a spoiler lol
Please skip mazinger zero for another like 4 years so they can actually do something new like grendizer ver infinitism
I could see an entire cour of red herrings from him
Yeah this writer is known for sensationalism
I'm actually not sure that ||the attack is public knowledge at all, just the declaration that all production of gundams is banned||
no the prologue was pretty up front about it

||I feel this is another utena reference/idea theft, the unexpectedly dangerous pretty boy||
There's a lot of yuri flavor but not really any actual romantic character development
I'm reflecting on something and I don't feel like gwitch is actually going to be yuri, at least not in this cour
they're all only on the list due to rampant fanboism
why replaced
I'm like 2 episodes behind due to work going insane after half the staff got covid
I don't think even bocchi needs a thread
I'm still very against user-made threads as I do consider that impossible to moderate, but disposable channels have some purpose
<@527865934380138509> please label spoilers with the show they're from, especially if they're not related to a current discussion in the channel
are you going to subject yourself to gundam nt
I did not like unicorn on basically any level other than surface presentation
depends if you like 70s camp
there's less content then you'd think because about 30% of seed is flashbacks or stock footage
~~if you actually care about animator wellbeing you should probably drop every non-kyoani anime~~
someone please tell them that having a hype cycle like 3 months long of trickle content doesn't work
particularly if you're going to be talking about plot revelations
Please use the thread in this channel or <#377148557796442134> to discuss the most recently released episode of witch from mercury
Pretty fitting as alpha 3 was probably the endpoint of the games dominated by 70s and 80s shows
Yeah, as Keisar Ephes
Most of his combat lines are reworked quotes from various OPs
He was also the final boss of one of the most critically acclaimed super robot wars games of all time
He is the single person most responsible for what anime ops sound like on average

His direct quote on gunpla was pretty simple - "No one would be happy to hear my opinion on this," and then he shut up and wouldn't be drawn out
I think you can like the stuff but still find it disgusting that your anti-war messages are monetized in a way that promotes militaristic sentiments and actively profits off of glorifying the war you wrote
I don't think these are contrary things
make a message about suffering in war and people fetishize the weapons
Tomino hates model kits for the same reason, I heard
"we'll slap a surface level of misery over hot jazz and overdesigned robots using very pretty visual effects to fight each other with"
unless you watch OYW stuff, which outside of 0080 and MSG is generally "war is cool, actually"
STILL MAD THIS WASN'T A FUCKING ANIME
and like
upon going down an ichiro mizuki nostalgia trip, I was reminded this exists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kh7uBEJbnE
so what, it's a cut-down version of the show for theater airing?
I thought it was too old for him lol
oh okay, my mistake
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2017_TV_series) this one I think
static shock was legit tho
I'm *guessing* flash was killed off in large to give it more of a tie-in with the Justice Lords
devourthedecadant
they are, that's what the poster was trying to bring up while they were being an asshole and I kicked them from the server
it's a shame injustice got mangled
though on the note of snyder-esque content
marvel's been beating DC's ass in film but DC has had the animation game on point for decades
it's something comic book fans have been talking about for a while
with maybe the partial exception of what if
but none have been quality, or particularly interesting
yeah they've done a few things
if they wanted to start a discussion about spiderverse this ain't the fuckin way to do it
no, I'm done
marvel animation has pretty much always sucked tbf
I'm really glad yuri lowenthal is the defacto voice of spider-man now
üëÄ
see all those people earlier who were praising the teenage tony stark cartoon
there is no such thing as accuracy to fictional characters who have had 600 different universes of them so far
there isn't
the concept is just dumb
I'm fine with stylistic differences
I didn't know this was a thing
https://twitter.com/THR/status/1603457856770039811
but that isn't a valid reason to say "this is bad"
sure
rather, it's not the designs in a vaccuum, it's that the designs remind me of RWBY, which isn't and wasn't ever good
the problem isn't the designs
Or they were just never adults
like, these are not 30-40 year old men
...they're obviously de-aged?
ash is the lebron james of the pokemon world, I see, I see
but it still wouldn't be in the original visual
it was an intentional tease
yes
thank you, it's more than a year after it started
that's a year after the show started?
initial visuals are designed at the start of a production run, not the end
you have a lot more options for strife and conflict when you have deuteragonists vs 1
I wouldn't blame them for doing that because ruby/sapphire was the best arc of the manga
and struggling happens at the intersection
They might be going off of the PokeSpe ruby/sapphire dynamic, where one protagonist is super good at battling and the other is super good at [other game gimmick]
if this is the original visual why is togepi there
Ash Ketchum is like a d-tier shounen protagonist
Being compared to ash isn't a hard barrier, he wasn't a great protagonist for most of his runtime
I mean I guess it's better than "I can't believe asumi chan is interested in brothels" but still
It still has that naming style for the full title
https://youtu.be/v9-WhSbTUKw
Raijin-oh is a kids show where elementary schoolers turn their school building into a combiner
that's nice
I'm going to delete the ones that probably have story significance, they're reposted with spoiler tags in the gundam thread anyway
you just don't follow accounts who tweet nothing but gundam
no?
this is probably your first gundam as it's airing but there are fans who avoid the model kit spoilers
G witch is probably my anime of the season but akiba has been a blast (I'm several episodes behind though)
Not my kind of "humor"
I agree that it's really uncomfortable though
Both of their goals were to be popular but yes, bocchi believes that self improvement is the secret unlike what's her name
It's watamote but the protagonist isn't a piece of shit who deserves the shit she gets
Oh chise was the singular dynazenon character I liked
also is peter in midnight suns, he's clearly set up to be the new face of the character
Maybe because attack on Titan is a bad engrish title
VNs on twitch sounds like a really weird and unsettling experience
and it's less popular but Sakura Quest was a clever piece as well
I mean, you can't make something like Shirobako as a fluke
one of the best original show runs I've seen in ages
gonna delete
actually considering there's a thread
then maybe don't post it?
I'd say we stan a short king but heero is honestly kind of a shit character
Scrolling up in this channel
I forgot what a manlet heero yuy was
don glees nuts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RbtscV9QwE fujoshis eat your heart out
maybe, but I think the 00 ED is still more homoerotically charged
idk maybe the haircut ED from 00 is gayer
that scene was probably the gayest scene in gundam until gwitch
you can't just deny homoerotic energy when it hits you
yeah 0083 leans in pretty hard with this. To a degree it makes sense, to set up for Zeta, but that doesn't explain the weird "zeon nobility" thing they get going
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74fxNHPBnv8 shout out to the time anno put evangelion music in a godzilla movie
it's based on a being's natural isolation from others
tbh bocchi's AT field would be hella strong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u6V6UisBz8
my eyes just saw "AT Bocchi" and decisive battle started playing in my head
Matilda saaaaaaaaaan
0079 had people like Matilda in addition to revil
As end says at least it's eye candy, even with stupid plot and characters and nuclear lasers
Nah 0083 holds together better than wing
üòî
popularity contests generally overlook the gems
best supporting female character is ranko mannen
because JJK is a thing?
I don't know what definition of 'value' we're going with here
if someone abbreviates my hero as BNHA what does that say about their personality
probably something from edgerunners
best scene hm
Because Stargate sg1 normalizes space travel.
I'd argue Stargate the movie is isekai - maybe Stargate Atlantis - but not Stargate SG1.
Inuyasha is an Isekai, turn a Gundam is not
There needs to be a break in regular contact and association
To my knowledge there is no attack happening on a location named Titan
I mean it's not English but yeah
second half had issues and felt like the director was trying to prove they were cooler than diebuster
first half was pretty much pitch perfect
I liked it
it was really cool to see one that mechanically worked
I do not hate (all) getter robos or anything but the "idk how the planes make the robots, they just do" is so dull and boring
some of which also didn't suck
and then he made like 3 more
dude made a Getter Robo that didn't suck
Aquarion (s1) is probably my favorite mechanical works of his tbh
the first 6 episodes really suck lmao
I don't think s1 is tbh
I mean it's not unenjoyable
nanoha's background art is not very good
worldbuilding doesn't work well when your world is populated with squares of flat color
strikers is like... 3 and a half hours of real time viewing before anything interesting happens?
so good job symphogear
managed to not be boring tho
Glad they reused some of those elements for the movies
It is not a coincidence that Nanoha picks up a nickname of White Devil
the creators of the work were clearly fans of toku and mecha
but you're on the right track I think
it turns out giant sword blade perspective is just cool
I mean, even Utena used stuff like the obari pose
Exactly, it's less specifically a mecha feel and more the kind of "toys for boys" supergenre
that, I think, is what makes even early nanoha stand out from other contemporary magical girls
I think the difference in feel is less *specifically* mecha, though some parallels exist, and more... it's meant for men, it borrows elements from shows meant for men, and it's devoid of things meant for girls
who is lankpants all I know is this desudesudesu person
their idea of pacing sucked
just, I want to grab the writer by the shoulders and shake them
there's some shared characters and ideas
Reflection and Detonation aren't even close to 1:1 adaptations of them but
also another mecha reference, this time to SRW
but the buster sword was an As upgrade
Was a way cooler vibe than wolkenritter  or whatever
also the formula suits are dope
also I saw it and detonation in theaters
I just like that it's doing its own thing
I think reflection was my favorite of the movies
I'd consume more yuri media but too busy doing the yuri to make time üòî
~~playing super robot wars~~
https://twitter.com/meatgirI/status/1611758643074011137
MapleStory
Girlish Number was too cynical for me but maybe you'll like it
It's very cynical
That one episode is the entire show of girlish number
You know that one episode with the VA selection and how everyone is just trying to make money by pushing their own interest?
The show you're actually talking about here is Girlish Number
Shirobako was a very optimistic one
A career drama about video games sounds fuckin great
new game was a missed opportunity
Really? The title is why you want to slap the creators?
yeah he just looks like A Dude
ok if you want to continue this conversation please use the thread
So that you can sleep better at night I'll leave it there then lol
typically class rep is the preppy kid who takes things too seriously
I'm guessing 'attendence girl' is class rep?
I guess spoilers were inevitable
Hm that's around the time I paused watching the show
ff sucks
Or second, if I'm harshly honest
There is no reason to watch it first though
There's technically gunpla builders
No
this sounds stupid enough for gundam
so the nuclear generator is technically not part of the suit
honestly there's probably a like, milimeter gap inside the suit that uses the deuterion beam tech or something
~~I think Ryusei predates Gravion by like 4 years~~
it's a pretty good time if you like super robots
nah it's not *that* dumb
I mean ||The girl who died woke up in her second robot body - btw she's a robot - on the moon|| is pretty up there
Zwei also has one of the funniest asspulls plotwise in mecha history afaik
and sho hayami is great in any role
big fan of literally everything being a maid though
it's preeeeeeeeetty rough, characters are offmodel a lot of the time
though obari did good in keeping the mecha action looking decent
animation for s1 was dogshit though lmao
gravion was alright
I wouldn't urge anyone to go hunt it down unless they're deep down a rabbit hole
It's fine, it is about what you think when you hear the phrase 80s yuri action schlock
someone tossed their bra off and it got caught
https://twitter.com/Stupacabra/status/1613556384817184768?t=l0uIzchxMMUeUPVNyRJRiA&s=19 wow this show is dogshit
Because the first, what was it, 3 weeks? Of putting it online they don't have to share profits on
They make seasons super bingeable in order to not pay actors and crew
No it means the discovery CEO has a hatred for animated content. It's not that no one has good shows to sell, he's refusing to buy
Probably not
The Astraea F with the mask is sick as hell
it's sad, while 00's mechanical designs are fire I think 00 itself might be one of my least favorite titular designs? I guess ZZ is still below it
yeah, same
I think they're fine but I don't like the quanta
I think seravee is cool, but in a "look at this dope toy robot" way instead of "this is definitely practical military hardware"
goofy as fuck
the gundam face open thing on the back
like
to me virtue is a wonderful fat boy, seravee has so much shit that doesn't make sense and feels like someone's model kit
that's why all panel details disappear and stuff like ribbon cables go away
they were literally and explicitly designed to be cheaper to animate
I don't mean that exactly in a derogatory way
it hurts me how much cheaper the designs got
I heavily prefer s1 designs to s2
but s1 actually has writing
which, granted, is the primary reason gundam is consumed
I genuinely don't think s2 has much of anything going for it other than "robots are cool"
I think you're projecting your experience into something more universal than it is
you keep talking about "people love s1 or hate it" but I'm gonna be honest, you're literally the only person I have ever encountered who didn't like s1 but liked s2
it's a good blend of quality and pacing while being something worth understanding from a critic's point of view for the rest of gundam
the OG movies are an easy suggestion for me
your life is finite and then you die
spend your time elsewhere
I disagree
strongest does not imply strong
the middle arc is the strongest but that does not mean it is worth watching
I cannot recommend age
the best thing is an AI girl
all I need from a sidestory
00F is fine because hanayo is great
ok.
I also love that this was enough for it to not be identified as a gundam
love the mask
I guess Exia has broad shoulders too but it doesn't feel as bulky
eh, it just looks too much like a football player or something to me. Really don't like the massive chest, and it makes little sense as an Exia successor
Considering I stopped hearing people talk about it after like 4 episodes I'm guessing it didn't make a big splash
but no, shinn's just Wrong
Shinn could have been a great chance to do a cross-section of Kira and ask if Kira's path in the first show was really the best idea
god why did you remind me marida exists
I've run into a lot of people who hate the CE designs actually
*together we will fight the fight*
Not a rock?
but the obscurity and complexity of the world was definitely a reason for Eva's popularity
It's certainly irrelevant to shinji, yes
From Anno's point of view, the viewer never needs to know how the Angels came into being in the first place
it is absolutely *absurd* how much critical lore gets shoved into a pamphlet they handed out for theatrical release of EoE and never publshed again
which btw
I don't think the show ever covers it, that was all red cross book stuff
which is why the geofront is such a surprise that it exists, until you get deeper into the lore and find out nerv didn't make it lol
I know somewhere it's pretty directly stated that UN's slashed aid for fighting poverty and starvation in other countries to pay for the giant robot
I feel like evangelion touches on costs once or twice, but that might just be me neck deep in extra lore
who? I only know alex dino
oof
wasn't kancolle a fall 2022 anime
and probably got greenlit as an anime because of sxf tbh
HnK was like, later that year or something
I think it was one of their first shows?
modern SRW is held together by duct tape and you can see every cost-cutting measure
I do not think SRW will ever get a custom OST album recorded for it - not anymore, anyway, the days of alpha are long gone - but it's a neat thought
> 1. Zettai Muteki Raijin-oh / Raijin'oh
> 2. Honoo no Sadame / Votoms

yeah, they were character song albums from xenoglossia
pretty sure it was released in conjunction with xenoglossia
just a bunch of 80s mecha OPs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PSOQMQu_qQ
idolmaster once did an album like that
it doesn't have to be for SRW, technically
Wracking my brain for things I thought looked better, old or new, and they're pretty much all OVAs or movies
MJP is also just some of the best mecha fight choreography you'll ever get in a TV show
it's not banned, but yeah, if you drop a bait opinion and vanish it ain't a good look, but it's fine as long as you can support your opinion
It's only a weak act 1
Honestly the movie is perfect from the start of the kakusei sequence straight until the end
The whole scientist sister going "yeah fuck you" was pretty worth the development
Some story beats were good tbh
Promare was fun
and ain't doing well
this is definitely a sign that RT's starting to buckle
you say it's about time
if they're just doing 1-2 episodes
They could do gundam.info release
üôÉ
hell, the Guel stuff felt like some plotlines might already be getting cut down
I would not be surprise if the ending is going to be compromised in order to make it happen
it was not a healthy run lol
like "yep, you got me, it could be anything"
they're too wide to bother discussing
I don't see the point of these
That's been true since like season 2
so what you're saying is the youtube uploads *are* a thing
yes
yes but the word premiere suggets it will be available elsewhere
oh wow, double glad I dropped the series
It's also possible they're worried about the youtube uploads being demonetized
because they're pushing it to crunchyroll
R&M's merch footprint must be huge
I do not think I've seen a show fire both voice actors of its deuteragonists and its creative lead before and still keep going
https://twitter.com/RickandMorty/status/1618009508420386817
I mean like, maybe an episode here or there?
even aside from fire gasoline floats on water
I never watched spongebob but I think as a kid I'd be too stuck by the whole problem that they're underwater and none of this works...
It's very odd considering I do *actually* consider Imagawa to be the auteur of super robot media lol
I don't think it pays off at all
it's a weird auteur director's experiment where they show you basically the final episode first
just skip episode 1 if you ever do try it
I recommend trying shin mazinger at some point, it pretty much fixes ashura
cow and chicken was definitely the spiritual successor to rocko
yeah they brought it back later
disney doug was trash though
filled the void left by doug
yeah hey arnold was great
but from what I understand ben 10 actually had a longrunning narrative so credit for that, that's pretty rare back then
6 rebrandings they did
It never clicked the one episode I saw - again, I was probably a little old, MMPR would be my equal of ben 10, I suppose - and by the time I saw ben 10 again it had gone through one of the like
aah real monsters was pretty good and I'm about 80% sure monsters inc ripped some ideas off wholesale

if you want to know the nick cartoon I actually watched as a kid
but in a good way
it's fucked up
time to listen to the dango deadmau5 mashup again
yeah, tartakovsky is a genius
ed edd and eddy was a good show but it has the flaw of not having particularly likeable protagonists, which is something I think kids need more than adults
though both shows would fall apart in their 3rd or 4th season when the animation style and directorial control changed
I think courage was probably the most creative of the bunch but PPG and Dexter were my comfort go-tos
though I still don't know how I feel about cow and chicken
cartoon cartoon fridays was an extremely strong lineup
also given the choice I was generally watching cartoon network over nick, at least past the slime era
old enough that I could read by the time the original run of power rangers happened
it happened before spongebob did
yeah
Though it's notable that the crew of the ship take advantage of the fact ideon wants to protect babies
It only starts really murdering everyone after it's clear this war just isn't ending
Ideon protects it's pilots for a while
The first adventure in the future was about helping a dog version of the mayor from Powerpuff girls
Shout out to ideon for having the best srw UI element of all time though
The only other commentary I have on ideon is it's always really interesting when they put it in SRW, the mech itself is pretty cool and I like the gattai, and finally I think the OP is one of the best Mecha OPs of all time lol
The show itself is glacially slow though
It and Ultraman are definitely the two most relevant pieces of media for the creation of Evangelion, so if you really get involved in being a scholar of Mecha history it's worth a watch on that grounds
It's much more direct than MSG in saying there are no innocent or righteous soldiers in war
So it's like all the getter robo shit about Emperor if the media had the balls to actually say "this outcome is bad actually and should be stopped at all costs, even if humanity doesn't make it"
The infinite power exists to protect innocents from bad guys, but if your struggles to protect yourself cause extended warfare...

"Innocence" is relative.
It's a more self aware getter robo.
That thematically
I think, though
It's an enormously influential piece but not something I casually recommend to an average modern anime viewer.
It's solidly 70s super robot with some really interesting philosophical musings on innocence that it doesn't spend enough time exploring. The end movie is legendary and is the only time I've seen a 6 year old get shot by a beam rifle.
He's a good kid but I can only take so many episodes about how amazing someone is
I'm eternally unsure whether I like Ernie or find him intolerable
It's fine
after MSG you can skip around however you feel like though
I guess 08th also works alright sans context
everything prior to f91 is very very strongly tied to MSG one way or another
I agree
Yes
Which means let him be beat on for a while while destroying as few enemies as possible
And have the ide gauge raised
The blue tiles are what will be hit by a map attack

Anyway have one more look at how ridiculous ideon is in srw
Gridman üëå
It should have either been more recklessly indulgent about Mecha references or less
Kira yamato motherfucker
They didn't even include maid Shirabe lol
Dark grasper is right and should have won
do not question her power
I guarantee you the animejapan organizers are not in on the secret announcement of s2
I prefer the S gundam way of "yeah no other mobile suit bothers to carry a big enough reactor to run the stupid thing"
but then it's not a super special only-my-suit-can-hold-it gun
~~bolting a particle accelerator onto a sniper was one of the coolest things victory did. aside from the rad as fuck motorcycle battleships.~~
the beam magnum makes zero sense, especially given that we don't really see anything like it in late UC
I unironically view this as bad lore to support more bad lore, which, considering the beam magnum in the first place, is three layers deep of shitty lore
because psychoframe is so cheap
also a second sinanju
that thing wouldn't last 30 seconds on an active battlefield if it was untested and unhardened
so would an arm replacement device
whatever, the silver bullet repressor or whatever is the dumbest thing, I didn't think I had to specify
because for some reason finding extra arms and a complex device to replace the arm on the fly is an easier solution just making a hacked in reinforced arm with the gun bolted on
the replacement limbs is to deal with the beam magnum
also the silver bullet is one of the dumbest ideas in gundam and that's a pretty high bar
some people like the A-packs, I think the B-packs is a cute reference to the NT-X, but Jona's not particularly likeable, the antagonist isn't particularly good, the psychoframe bullshit is too much, and phenex is generally overkill designwise for most people
I don't know anyone who really disagrees
unicorn is mostly the author's fetish of what he thinks UC should be
he's very known for using flashy CGI and lens flares and not very strong scripts
he also did the star trek reboots
yes
sorry it's past midnight
oh it's fukui duh
though I need to go check if they're the same
no, narrative
bruh
https://twitter.com/MichaelToole/status/1308156257057091585
og lineart is great

that's had all the style katoki'd out
I don't like that version
it's like an angry zeta
I like the mk 3
yeah it has the same ugliness as the GP series
neither are canon
there's another mk iv design not from g gen
also as a fun tidbit I'm pretty sure there is no canonical design for mk iv to date, though G Gen games do have a consistent design they use

mk v and s both have amazing head designs
I completely forgot!
GOD THEY EVEN CALLED HIYAMA'S CHARACTER TETSUYA KOUJI
L reused the K sprites
yeah, the DS ones
I think they do that twice even
he does but the show has everyone say "damn can't believe he died" before he angrily corrects them
(rip hiyama)
(it gets wrecked episode 1 and you basically never see it)
it's just inside it
in the core gunner's case, it's this thing
basically every robot in godannar connects to another robot
she has a pretty cool robot too
shizuru's ass is canonically so fat she has trouble getting in her robot
I mean it's also pretty sexual (which is different from horny) but I think that's not surprising given the key art
godannar is unironically pretty good if you can get around some age sketchiness
"gurren lagann!!" "getter emperor!!" "mazinger zero!!" "demonbane!!" [group collectively drowns in their own drool]
also who doesn't fucking love people arguing about fucking robot power scaling
it doesn't *completely* wipe out on its face but it's missing something
chasing spectacle to the point of weakening thematics
second half is kinda symphogear tbh
and an okay first hour
good 1 hour
yeah
I'd just knock promare out tbh
I definitely disagree with that take but it's more of a genre piece, but you absolutely can't skip it for diebuster
diebuster is gay, if that helps
I do suggest gunbuster + diebuster
gundam 0080 is probably the only gundam making it onto my top 10
there's *way too many* gundam shows that go in a direction you don't want them to go in the second half
not yet
I wouldn't count g-witch as good
god help me I think danball senki probably sneaks onto my top 10 list somewhere
2-3: Gunbuster+Diebuster
maybe not even top 10 mecha list?
but, again, this isn't a show that's on my top 10 list
it's a good ride and godannar's ending is one of the better anime endings I've seen
mid 00s be like that
there's also a BDSM couple, an incest couple, an improper social stations (and also size difference) couple, and a lesbian couple, which does feel kinda squicky to be grouped in with the others, especially given that the butch girl gets semi-counted as a man for plot purposes
every major robot team in the show is in a taboo relationship, one way or another
like
it's fun but also weird
The launch sequence is great and was probably the best part of the show
But they're both refreshes of 70s or 80s robots
Yes, the 00s examples I'd give are dancouga nova and shin mazinger
*stares at captain earth*
Sometimes the show would be better if it was just about the robot
Shin mazinger
But seeing z shred a bunch of kikaiju made up for some of it
2/3s of it were pretty bad and most of the nostalgia wank was boring aside from the thoughts on sayaka and koji's relationship
Rocky horror picture show, the one and only theater girl movie
I have a fight or flight instinct with songs from the RHPS
I also spent years of my life as a theater tech and do not think "theater girl" is a positive quality
I privately think the show is a little overrated but it's better than most
They are actually fighting to win, yes
Even though it is a real fight
They come across as stage play interpretations of a real fight
Also it's hard to swallow that the fights are serious half the time because they're excessively choreographed
It's just not exactly clear what the tournament is for
But every episode has stakes, because the entire show is about a tournament
Please bear in mind it is enormously pretentious
Kind of?
yes
cool is not the word I'd use for it but people will definitely call it cool
like come on, there is no mobile suit more teenage boy than this
it's the most 14 year old thing created since kingdom hearts
they really should animate it though
it is *dogshit* in terms of message
pacifist who spends the entire series talking about nonviolence shuts up the antagonist by slapping her while her boyfriend uses the most powerful mobile suit out there to pound them into submission
THE METAPHOR IS SO FUCKING BAD
I JUST REMEMBERED THAT MARIEMAIA ONLY STOPS WHEN RELENA SLAPS HER
GOD
she's 7, by the way
wing is really dumb politics but EW is literally someone managing to create a superpower and then try to take over the world because her daddy told her to
hmmm
endless waltz is

I almost wrote okay

it's not complete dogshit but I find the mecha action disappointing which is all it really has going for it because the politics *completely* sucks
you will waste less of your life but it will still be a nonzero amount
Idk you might end up liking shinkalion, it has some ygo absurdity to it
I'll agree with the condition that the dom remake shouldn't exist
"what if we gave it a palm blaster but it only shot 10m"
It's actually just from the stress of the internalized shame of having such a stupid weapon like the shining finger blaster
Destroy Gundam and those fucking mobile armors are just ugh
Even mechanical design is rough in destiny
Destiny is just a mess
it's flawless
The only character that gets referenced that mattered in the shows but wasn't in the movies was Admiral Graham and that's such a small detail in strikers that it doesn't really affect anything
Not in the shows either afair
Loran is also not a particularly skilled pilot
creature design is not one of them
for all that Nanoha does pretty cool
like the abysmal final fight
it polished up some stuff that As really needed fixing
tbh all of nanoha is copaganda
they feel like filler
and it's not even like the previous 7 were full of monster of the week
and yeah, I'd argue strikers takes about 8 episodes to *actually start* the A plot of the show
it's not outright awful but it also doesn't do a lot right
strikers is really a very shaky show
I'm honestly thinking more "feminist learns her ideals are trash" angle
that novel will probably happen someday and be awful
It's also narratively less appealing to go from a position of less social power to a position of more social power unless it's the dominant thing being examined in the story
Was literally fighting a world war
You get denied at schools
Suddenly you can't get loans
Imagine the world government telling you you should be doing x and you don't want to
I swear it was mandatory but even if it wasn't, I'd fight against it
There's also the fact that people's goals and dreams aren't related to their genetics very much at all
If durandal was a car salesman you'd come home with the worst one on the lot
I feel like you're taking this at surface value and not performing any critical examination
"don't worry lesser humans, we'll find a place in our world for you"
Especially coming from the leader of a genetically enhanced nation?
You're not seeing how this is racism with an extra step?
It's bad
But being genetically profiled in order to determine that you'd be happiest as a garbageman is uh
This is around when durandal went mask off about the plan
Where durandal has a death star window installed to be properly evil
Yeah the one on this thing
There are multiple death stars in this show
Requiem is a different super weapon
There's a new genesis in destiny
No
That was a zaft weapon and a refinement of an older zaft weapon
Neogenesis?
I don't think you build genocide superweapons as a trump card to force your optional plan through bro
Like it was basically a planned economy in terms of zero freedom to move positions economically
Wasn't the careers assigned by the destiny plan non optional
I actually don't even know if it had great ideas
Destiny was fine up through break the world but A) that's like 12% of the show and b) they had no idea where to go after that
Hell, destiny as is is more memorable than the story destiny probably would have told
Like even if it was firing on all cylinders I don't think I'd find it memorable for being much more than a toy commercial
To be completely honest I don't think Destiny would have been anything better than "good for a Gundam show I guess" even *if* it didn't have all the flaws it had
I liked the central political conflict of seed better when it was called gattaca
Anyway
Lacus as a character is fine but the pull lacus has in both shows is irrational
Lacus is some weird combination of Paris Hilton, JFK, and bill gates, it's super weird
Everything regarding lacus in both seed shows is stupid
No, the other side thinks that you should be made to work on a farm
Both sides think that your fate should be determined by your genes
Durandal isnt a whole lot better than the racists he fights is the thematics you're supposed to get from the whole thing
Yes
"I'm here for everyone but in case we lose I made sure I can make the earth uninhabitable"
I legit cannot take durandal seriously when neo Genesis exists
How was durandal going to incentivize people to take it
Not everyone can afford to change their life man
Your logic is the same as "then move to Canada"
It really doesn't matter
big ol transphobia in it though
sapph should probably know though
uh
gargantia is okay
I never made it to the second season but I recall every plot point happening pretty much purely for shock value
look shes doing the pose c:
and in fact, there's an entire game about the gravity shockwave absolutely fucking up earth and ruining it (the heroes go back in time and link up their robot reactors to power a shield at the end)
it's funny in retrospect because alpha 1 ends on gunbuster episode 5
shout out to srw alpha 3 for doing a truly perfect rendition of the final episode
though as END pointed out, the fact we only get flashes of the epic battle is definitely because it would be too expensive
but yeah the "episode 6 was black and white to save money" is a complete myth
it's great
as spiritual successors go
anyway definitely check out diebuster when you have time
it's actually more expensive to animate in greyscale lol
yeah it's such a shame because it's just a worthless episodic thing
iirc there's an entire episode of a large unattractive transgender prostitute chasing around the MC
Got that "I'm 10 and I'm going to design the most powerful mazinger" energy
Infinity itself is cool but dorky
Nah, I was using infinity as a shorthand for Z ver Infinitism
Plider is a giant forehead
Head... Not a fan
I love the limbs though
I like elements of it but infinity's heat sinks are so much better in the way they're modern but still classic
Interesting design for z
Haha
Second image
wdym, he's what makes the anime actually queer media instead of queerbait
that coupled with relatively pointless villains made it a show that was carried by action in spite of writing
I didn't particularly feel Dynazenon's character arcs landed particularly well, honestly
üòî
did not get changed until alola
was gen 4 acc
80%
ez as long as you land those sleep coinflips
I'm listening to OP 2 I forgot this existed, I don't think there's a single bit of CE media that uses this anywhere
and one time they didn't even use it for seed lol
this is like, never, since SEED's only been used 3 times
granted
becomes a true banger when used in srw
catchy melody
I really like realize though
ironically I did actually watch a few episodes of SSSS back as a kid but remember next to none of it so it was a weird experience
that's certainly fair
the goldburn stuff was great though. same with knight.
I prefer sentai over ultraman but I just felt like one show was trying to say something worth listening to and the other was going through the motions of making cool shit
I guess I disprove this theory then
gridman's central idea persists well and is interesting to think about while I'm going to be honest, I've completely forgotten the central conflicts of dynazenon's particulars
ended up being a "it was fine/10" while gridman was a "hey this was interesting/10"
It's like Zeta was a look at seeing how the federation *could* be as awful as zeon, and then the franchise, with the large zeon fandom, collectively decided, "yeah actually we're retconning it so they were always that bad and always will be."
and make them as bad or, in the case of stuff like Unicorn, worse than the zeeks
but once the 90s hit there was almost this attempt to 'catch up'
they were just kinda shit, a case of passive, stagnant apathy rather than a second source of malice
imo the federation (sans titans) wasn't really painted as 'the bad guys' per se until the 90s
well maybe hotblooded isn't the right word but
because he's one of the best hotblooded VAs of anime history?
generic angry girl
I'm guessing she's Crystal makoto
...yeah
I mostly just detest it because it's just repeating BD, but edgier
...to go "aren't their uniforms and code cool"
yeah igloo really leaned on the nazi/zeon connection
2014
Blue Destiny is an example though
Missing Link is more aggressive about it but it's also really recent lol
0083 and igloo are probably the prime examples
once
which is fine, but they actually do a sick fight like
It's frequently carried by the ideas of the fights more than the on screen content
for a martial arts show the fights are really... straightforward.
My main regret for G Gundam, besides the pacing, is that it rarely gets the animation budget it really wants to have
kinda
I'm not even sure Sam has seen a normal gundam
Honestly my advice for this would be to do like, 1-2 episodes of G Gundam each day while you power through one of the other shows as your main squeeze
G gundam is honestly kind of a grind and I think the others would be an easier snack to digest
Shin Mazinger if you want a weird 70s/00s fusion
Gun x Sword or MJP if you want comedy
hm
*apparently its not*
well
that's a weird definition of need
you do?
it's worth your time if you finished gate and went "I need more barely veiled nationalism in my anime"
it's more or less banned in china
obari
It could have been more, maybe should have been more, but what it is is fine
7-8 feels right for it
My guess is blackface or something
araki shot me in the kneecaps
jodio is the fucking worst name araki why do you hate me
oh jeez yanase retweeted something on this show, I guess he's doing designs for it
Sorry, it's rather late and I really made this more serious than I intended, I don't think it's required to treat the work with such a critical view if it's not a particularly resonant theme to you
It's a very martial arts/wuxia theme, so I think it really fits the show; I'm just kind of bothered I rather idolized the theme when I was like 15.
He's found a case where he needs words, but there's been too many episodes where he achieves a moment through the "men talk with their fists" solution that aren't really refuted by the ending - developing a bond with allenby, the shuffle alliance, and Master Asia. I dunno, I personally think I can still like a work and acknowledge that the message isn't perfect. It's certainly not the only message in the show.
Absolutely, but I don't view that as a refutation of the theme
I was more thinking of the maxim they keep bringing up that it's fine if men can't talk through things if they can achieve mutual understanding and respect through violence
That is one element of it
also as an adult I kind of have to admit one of the central themes of the show is kinda distilled toxic masculinity
yeah I really love it but there's a few that have nailed the journey better
and it makes me hungry for a show where that was the norm
(||Finals fight of Domon vs Sai Saichi||)
no problem in skipping part 8 if you also skip 9
manga doesn't do the weird renaming shit that the anime does
have there been any non-western bands or do I have to worry about „ÄéÔºßÔº°Ôº£Ôº´Ôº¥„Äè showing up
After that it's mostly pink green and red sparkles
It has interesting things to say until it doesn't
pa works, you have what, akiba, shirobako, buddy daddies on your list?
that other studio be putting out fire
Araki has really grown to love his puzzle boxes
I haven't read the chapter yet but it's almost guaranteed to give the MC a direct combat stand at some point, it's just too difficult to write a half decade long saga without one
~~that's every stage~~
might boot up T and solo a stage with the arcadia
pillar of anime history
but this is *big*
the old voice actors etc passing away have sucked, of course
I'm upsetti spaghetti
man
especially considering there's no dialogue
it's a decent story
which, they are a movie lol
Leiji Matsumoto did the movie

rip
oh no
https://youtu.be/8e8zUqP8yu4
The 0079 cartoon network dub was great
definitely well animated
it's alright
fuzors was garbage and genesis wasn't great
interesting, but
hm.
Give him a grave
never knew it had a storyline
never owned one
yeah I remember them
probably a sound-a-like thing
then you haven't heard her before I don't think
probably her biggest non-anime appearances
or aschen
she's lamia in srw
you're doomed to be mid unless the player invests
the downside of not being the main character in modern SRW
~~she's still not great in SRW~~
but that's probably somewhat the fault of stock footage - they really liked that one shot of her using the gunner and missing
also the discussion about Destiny made me think that Lunamaria might be the worst 'ace' we ever see in gundam, only beaten by punching bags like Patrick
it's fine if you don't take it too seriously, but even that stops being true post-X. Overall it gives a slightly more supertech/super robot feel to the CE setting. The original Astray frames themselves look pretty good, though maybe too much greebling on the legs.
honestly the only judgement I've gained of some of y'all from these tier lists is some of you have a suspicious amount of free time
mildly surprised solo never tried edgerunners
Next time on dragon ball z
but I'd have to remove any and all social life for 3 months
Like that's the kind of thing that could theoretically be possible for me
that's 'only' an average of 10 hours a week isn't it
And if you want sparkle spectacle 00 and most everything post destiny is better
It has ok designs but honestly the designs are just SEED but worse
It has ok ideas, not good enough to justify watching it
Destiny is pretty crap and not worth the time it takes to watch it
Jeeg zion
The rest isn't much better. G-Unit's claim to fame is that it's not garbage.
Gundam wing lore isn't real and can't hurt me
You could not pay me to care about 80% of the real robot wave of mediocrity that came out in the 80s
Like
But I try to have a working knowledge of even the stuff I haven't seen
Many
I was really rolling l-gaim around in my head tbh
I think the next classic I'll try to track down is orguss
And some really good mc units
It's just a southern cross-quality show that has the word Gundam stapled on it
I felt victory was a really average frequently boring Mecha show, on par with most gundams of the era to me
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
They forgot the word newtype this time around so it doesn't get the free pass I guess
None of this really bothered me because I feel like most of UC has super dumb stuff
Its ambac on crack
Like
Rotating elements are actually insanely useful in space btw
Ok they make sense insomuch as I'm expected to believe it's reasonable to put legs on your space robots
Because they were intended for earth
The wheels in space made sense
Beam rotors etc
All the victories and the tire robots are pretty neat
The designs are probably the highlight of the show tbh
I'm just realizing how much victory sounds like one of tomino's 80s shows
I mostly like victory for having the best tv choreography before, idk, turn a
the art direction's some of the best in anime of the last 10 years
madoka definitely has good scenes
skip madoka movies 1 and 2 they're basically recaps
and then watch madoka movie 3
and then give it a week or two
I second watching madoka
it's v good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vxW1DjP63s
the music of GGG is dear to me though since the OST was done by tanaka kouhei, who's done some other really great stuff like G Gundam, Gunbuster, and Diebuster's soundscapes
If you're super into robots there's a huge world of difference, but it's all relative, really
nearsightedness; I'm a pretty huge mecha fan
I'm actually a huge fan of GGG's OST
Myopic vision on the genre I guess
Sorry
...Hm, yeah
GGG is really good but that's a *really* weird description of it
the stringed box she plays
how often do you get to see a legit zither in anime
lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCm2PtSgzkA

I wasn't completely thrilled with GuP TV

or you could go with the finland one
british grenadiers
I don't think I've ever seen a game before or since use that trick
with the secret ending
the original nier fucked me up
drakengard 3 was really good in everything besides the actual game
Agricola

just... for context
in this scene they are killing a zombie cat with vibrators
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mixzbaXx208
though hearing "fatherfucker" in an engrish accent is amazing
*in japanese*
"fuck" is one of the most commonly used words in the show
It revelled in being crass and vile
having content you'd never see in it
It was also a loveletter to western animation, despite uh
yeah
Panty and Stocking was one of those extremely rare anime that gets made because the studio wants to do what they want to do and has the money to do it
well, if you can call demons magical girls
This was actually the theme to a magical girl transformation sequence and the following battle
their core staff is now what makes up Trigger
Gainax is the now-defunct (mostly) studio who did Evangelion, Gunbuster, FLCL, Gurren Lagann, and an assortment of other stuff
~~this is the best anime gainax ever worked on~~
do you have any limits on memeyness or inappropriateness on this queue
it's a shame Chris never got to sing more than like 15% of this song
"we're having a sale on bullets just for you" is probably my favorite single lyric in all of symphogear
~~it's still good~~
wow discord codec doesn't like eurobeat
of course she'd get techno
from before the curse
but I guess it makes sense, since I think the implication you're supposed to draw from those is that they're part of some True Original Music or something
also the little bits of the zesshou and activation chants they like to throw in
and I like the track a lot more now that I notice that
I think it took until my third or fourth viewing of the show to realize that the sad theme s1 opens up with is a (p)reprisal of first love song
I need to dl the GX OST and find the reprisal of chris' s1 b-side
10 is Chris "I happened to be in the area" Yukine
but yeah
I was implying the synchrogazer part not the x-drive
11 is fine fight, 12 is hibiki berserk, 13 is SYMPHOGEAAAAAAAAAH
I think it's 10
honestly the entire s1 was carried by Chris and Kanade in terms of giving the story meat
Kanade had to have screentime, or else her death would be cheap as far as the viewers cared
I guess they couldn't yet afford songs they didn't plan to use in the anime
poor kanade never got a b-side
I've listened to very few of the character songs/non-featured b-sides
it's just there for me
I mean I don't hate it
not a fan
not a serious vote for flight feathers btw

this is one of the absolute best youtube comments on a klk vid though
```One of the central characters of Sonic Adventure 2 is the amnesiac Shadow the Hedgehog. He is identified by his black hair and distinctive red streak.

Created by an intelligent doctor and the game‚Äôs main villain, Shadow was born from alien DNA with the intent to be the ultimate lifeform. Realising the evil that was intended to be done with Shadow, the scientist behind him (who was ordered to be killed shortly after) took Shadow to try and use him to defeat the alien menace.

Unfortunately, it was not until the big bad is up in full swing and the world is screwed that anyone found any of this out, including Shadow realizing the artificiality of his life.
Shadow owns a bike, and is often accompanied by an alien who assists him in battle.
He has an intense rivalry with the blue blur Sonic, who likes to keep the world in order‚Ä¶ but, there‚Äôs more to them than just looking like each other.

Sonic Adventure 2 culminates with the heroes and villains fighting in deep space over the ultimate weapon, a satellite with the power to obliterate Earth.

After Shadow transforms into his golden super form in order to defeat his villainous creator and save the planet, he is sent hurtling back to Earth, and almost dies.

"This is who I am!"Ôªø```

it's still the 21st night of september
happy anniversary I guess
heyyyyyyy
that's like, every funk song to me
word
the 21st night of september
<@284390402210136064> Do you not remember
just sing "do you remember the 21st night of september" for every line
along with iji it's my vote for best truly free game on the internet
because I'm tired of giving nicalis money for pixel's work
I had to resist buying it on switch again
and then you go from this to the main cave story theme in the plantation
Coupled with the fact that it plays when you decide to turn away from freedom in order to try to save things, it's wonderfully emotional

people seem more in sync then
and then speed up the footage
twice as slow
I don't think they use it for every shot here but a common music video technique is to actually have them act it out like
I thought the persona series started at 5

Okay I know you've been talked to about this before but as a contributor to this community your habit of trying to one up everyone in near every discussion doesn't really fit in; particularly in a music channel I would suggest not being so eager to shit on people, dude. Really do some soul searching on why you respond like this.

oh my god I went to look up King Gainer's OP

it even made it into srw lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIH_AJJRKLw
storywriter is so iconic though
It goes super well with the counterculture vibe of the show
Several characters are named after electronica artists
Every single episode title is based off a relatively noteable electronica piece
Every robot in the show is named after a synth
E7 is actually super, super, *super* deep rooted in electronica
instead I'll pick this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTPhcKs_CYU
it has also been pretty much scoured from youtube apparently
My favorite ost piece doesn't play until the final episode lol
You can read the manga if you want, it's good
I *strongly* recommend that you never watch any other e7 material in your life
If you do fall in love with the show though
The second op of e7 is one of my favorite anime ops of all time
E7's OST is legendarily good
Sad guitar/piano version of the main theme
This is such a visual novel thing to do
thats some good jizz
üëå
e7's OP game was so strong, and honestly most of those EDs slapped too
though it's still better than most anime OPs on reflection
that's the one OP I didn't really like lol

for these clips, I mean
the giganscundo is my favorite along with the grungust
yeah it's pretty great
the higher res sprites really helped
visually, that is
it was a little too over the top and cluttered sometimes on PS2
yeah SRWOG made an excellent transition to PS3
I grew up on the series and it's all been the same shit
just like every generation's been to the one before it
we're going to get yet another mundane progression and have basically the same game as sumo but slightly different and debateably better
it doesn't matter, gamefreak doesn't know how to innovate

if you have bought bayo 2 on the eshop, you'll get 1 at a discount
it's not a game I can play just anywhere
I still need to finish bayo 1
big mood
they just change out the bells and whistles each time
like competitively, sure some have sucked more than others, but from a casual "I'm gonna play pokemon!" experience it's all the same shit
tbh I'd rather have another symphogear SRW spinoff
even if I'm bad at it
I'm probably going to get the nicalis fighter purely for the castlist
even with autocombo systems
I'm not good enough to even get enjoyment out of them, really

gacha gaming is a form of self harm

late game
unexpectedly good
it was
the best part of monster girl quest was the combat
imo
not a good house rule
that's
CoC is pretty heavy on player death
they'll probably just die
I mean you said it's CoC right?
you count the successes
7 or more on the d10 is a success
and multiplying it REALLY wouldn't work there because it's a success system lol
I played a system for years where 20+ d10 throws were the norm
if you roll 1 and multiply it a bunch you're going to get a 1/3 chance of hitting the very edge cases
when you roll a large dice pool you're going to get something kind of in the middle
everything sounds unnatural and clashing but at least you can understand what's going on I guess
maybe X's is better but I don't know why it would be
it's very much never been proofread by a native speaker
no, but it's only a single step above sometimes
it's not the best

those are 4 stats

I think?
for 5?
6/3 blank text
I'm ready for a fucking break
I've been playing against it since beta
I'm fine with combo decks but freeze mage was just
as soon as they can reliably live long enough it'll come back
mage just no longer has a "I can't die" card
exodia's still in standard
some pack filler is fine but absolutely on the reprints
rip
it's not going to be the same anymore without brode to blame
they should have sliced it in half and shuffled most of the good cards into the wild bin when they did the initial split
blame classic for most of that
there's limited design space, so when you fill it, the only way to go is up
because otherwise you either get expansions that no one uses or power creep
most tcgs and ccgs have rotations, yes
only two long-term options
I'll admit that, but I believe card games really do have to change or die
they get reinvented because playing against the same cards for 6 years is hell
we still have control warrior, we still have midrange hunter
"freeze mage except the fireball is blue this time" sounds like hell
idk
and that means the game sucks
that means those decks are strong forever
do they want the same decks to be relevant forever?
people complain about that but that always confuses me
assuming you have a good enough deck and you're not complete garbage, hitting legend is just a time investment
but because I don't care enough to invest that much time in a month
not because I can't
I've never hit legend
which was hilarious bullshit
the orignial nerf was to stop giants warrior
but it was also really hard to play right
sure it was too good
honestly I miss patron warrior
but I see your point
yeah that's also a key difference
how much is shaw, 4?
with the deck restriction
legendary is a big difference
nah
who knows
with brode out we might see changes in philosophy
haha icehowl
I mean I guess it was almost in the game 3 years ago
it should have been in the game 3 years ago
5, but it doesn't activate till the next turn
and probably more silenceable as they experiment with cutting dark pact
that's a huge deal
cubelock's an entire turn slower
hunter's quite possibly back in it
everything's fucked
nerfs hit today
besides
hunter's been continually alive to some degree since that really bad spot around msog
nah
anyway the fact that they had to design around alex every fucking adventure really should have clued them into something
there it is, the sza
*alexstrasza
I was too focused on the fact there was a stupid consonant mashup somewhere in there
yes
alexszandra
no wait, it has goblins too
think of what they could do with mage if it was no longer just mtg red without goblins
in the hands of a good player, miracle rogue around that point of time was probably one of the better decks the game's seen
if auctioneer had come down you were probably losing, honestly
yeah, yeti was still in for azure drake
it was usually played on 6 or so
yeah I'll give you that
*not back then*
miracle rogue was really common for a bit
actually during certain months the most played 5 drop was probably gadgetzan auctioneer
azure drake, the 4/4 with card draw and spell power
we're talking classic here
healbot was gvg
yeti was played because it was a 4 drop that traded with the most played 5 drop and lived
but that was mostly because azure drake was a busted card
I remember when yeti was king
actually punishing evolves without outright "haha it's a 1/1" is almost justification enough for me
XM8
Does fishgun have a girl
Maybe if I got into them as a kid I'd be more fit to play them but they were just never my brand of fun
I satisfy any similar itches with character action games instead
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
They're typically too fast for me to really get what's going on
I'm not very good at them, I don't have the reflexes to get good at them, and they'll never be that fun for me
I'm allowed to not like fighting games, thank you
a symphogear fighting game is probably the one symphogear game I'd never play
I'm still hoping for a new pretty heroine wars title
(I mean these days they might be, x-men's fallen far)
unless you think that RWBY and X-Men are on the same level of sellability
I don't think that's a fair comparison
also it's not like the blazblue brand name is sacred or anything
"steam card games" generally means they're all garbage and mostly worth getting to resell cards or something
I only played 3 but it was pretty rad
hence the kamen rider page you're probably thinking of
because that's really an idiom
is... that really a reference
It's pretty cool how enemies are automatically defeated in earthbound if you're strong enough
the 999 series also mixes it up decently and the first game is basically a slightly worse version of my favorite VN (which happens to be from the same author)
TF2 crates were, I think, the first
they're not about to be the ones to remove them
valve invented loot boxes
yeah 'VN' isn't always the opposite of gameplay
I don't celebrate his death but I know a lot of people that are relieved he can't hurt people anymore
and on a platform like he had, going out on twitter and calling someone names is also sicking the worst of your fans and followers on that person
He certainly did a lot to change the field of video game reviewing... for what that's worth, but he also spent a lot of time and effort very much not respecting anyone he didn't like
That's what I have mixed feelings on, actually
I'm pretty overall mixed on it as well
https://twitter.com/GennaBain/status/999785407087808512
he passed
rip
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
like yeah it sucks but if it's the pricing model they pick
I don't understand the mentality of "if it's done you should have given it to us for free"
but it was a surprise to me
well idk if it was a surprise to kickstarters
surprise release yesterday
did anyone get bloodstained or whatever
You can pay with earned currency and it's not that absurd
It's okay
You pay to rent guns and shit
It's a weird model
I guess the cleanest way I can cut it is that I'm sad he didn't get the chance to continue to try to improve as a person
As I said, my feelings are complex
It wasn't an isolated incident of aggression
He calmed down in the past year or so but he frequently told people to get cancer and die or other worse things
fighting games seem like a madden-level scam to me half the time anyway
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
what's the functional difference between on-disc and normal day-one DLC
why does on-disc DLC bother you more than having to download them
oh, arksys metric
standard by what metric
the cinematic universe has really pulled it away from them in the past 10 years
idk, x-men's n longer an A-lister for marvel imo
the DLCs would have to be increasingly powerful if they wanted to make the majority of their money in them
I sit on a nintendo server and the debate is ever-reoccurring
I'm sorry, I'm slipping into bad habits
: )
being a party game
brawl was great at its job
but nintendo trying at all is why we have two smashes being relevant at once
except nintendo doesn't try hard
why would you play SFIV
for SFV
right, but if capcom's going to sponsor big pools
being a pro player means chasing the money
the game tournaments for what money, alice?
(except nintendo lmao)
the companies would fight them on this
because unlike the trashtalk
online matchmaking's part of it
but yes I'm interested ~~if it's not D&D or an identical d20 derivative~~
it might actually be what I've been looking for for years to run a 1 on 1 game for someone so thanks whoever said that
I'm actually still going through OVA after someone recommended it
before they got screwed by Onyx Path
I knew him best when from Exalted threads on /tg/ since he was one of the lead writers for 3e
but I think it's his actual name
you'd have to ask him
god it's so weird to encounter holden
marvel back then was all about the xmen - you didn't have a clue what the avengers were (as a group) unless you actually read the comics
it's so weird comparing marvel of the 90s with marvel today
dess_roll 35d10
nice
I'm not especially surprised
but player dynamics matter more than ever
yeah there's nothing wrong with an ERP group if that's what you're signing on for
Alice the Unfucked
because the premise is that this kind of stuff is what your characters should be capable of naturally
god this just makes me sad Exalted's a bad system
aside from loading like shit
it doesn't have everything, but it's pretty good
https://rpg.rem.uz/ by the way, this is a good resource
I do think it's fair that if you're going to DM you should do so with the system of your choice, which may be the one you're most familiar with
but that's the board game part of it
and the combat can be fun for what it is
that's the core of it
I'm trying to think of how to really put this
well
there are things in it that get in the way of the role you want to be and the systems encourage munchkining like nothing else
I'm not really slamming D&D here but I feel it's more board game than *role playing*
have you ever played anything more conducive to actually telling stories
only low chances
I think I'd probably have to be drop-in/drop-out because my retail schedule has no 0% work days
also removed random generation
maidrpg could be adapted to symphogear if you didn't mind a comedic bent/renamed some of the traits
I was actually thinking
do you need to be chained down
I am mostly but *unreliably* around
I'll wait to hear about the system and setting before pinning down a class etc
fucking everything is not limited to a high charisma score
4 atm by my count
I was actually thinking of being a robot because then the character could just be broken for a while if I miss a game
because moth-people are cool
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I may or may not reference other OCs of mine
in theory it's good, in practice it can turn toxic when used as a power move
irl it's by holding up or tapping a card with an X drawn on it
basically any player has the ability to veto anything that makes them uncomfortable
a tool used by groups, usually irl
I don't think the X-card is necessarily healthy but I do think it's good to discuss what the players are comfortable with and what's a no-no zone
we'll establish boundries as a group once we have a group
a lot of modern systems get rid of a grid because online roleplaying's common
well again, the conversation's predicated on it being D&D
we could set up another server or a private channel
but not all systems are
roll20's useful if it's a grid-based system
ugh

The maid rpg rulebook is fantastic
just as a warning
it is also large
https://rpg.rem.uz/_Collections/Cartoon%20Games/OVA%20System/
but that's it
you do need an NPC in a commanding role and PCs to be operatives of theirs
It's worth noting that "Master" and "maid" can be metaphorical
most of the maid rulebook is optional rules
Maid is really simple to understand how it works but you kind of have to learn how to bullshit
It takes "board game" and runs with it
4e is the best D&D combat wise, ironically
con: it's more complex, character building takes time, and I can't vouch for how well combat works because I've never tried it
pro: more customization, it's easier to *see* what a character is by their stat sheet, and you can fall back on your character sheet as guidance on what you can do
okay let me lay out the pro-con of OVA that I've seen so far
https://rpg.rem.uz/Maid%20RPG/
in a stat
and the difference between a 1 and a 3 is *huge*
the drawback is no long-term progression
maid's benefits is it's simple, goofy, and highly encourages creativity from players
I've seen worse
I've been reading through it lately
yeah it's d6
of course the next question would be *what* anime bullshit
neat
okay excellent because I have a terrible idea
how non-canon bullshit can we get
or subtract them
the traits let you add extra d6
or, if they come up the same, add them together
the core mechanic is you roll 2d6 and keep the highest
you don't have core stats, you have a list of traits that have +1-5 or -1-5 attached to them
OVA is a trait system
...for the player book
I've grown to admire simplicity after being involved with an evangelion rpg homebrew project that grew into 225 pages
and compact
that's really good
wow maid's only like 30 pages of core crunch
again, your average stat is going to be between 0 and 3
the stats don't give you a lot to work with
it's a little tricky
maid is basically "maids fight until one gives up and cries"
that's fair and that's something maid doesn't do well - detailed, drawn out combat
but if you can justify a 3, you don't need anything else
only one stat
or whatever
so you're not justifying luck, you're justifying... phonic gain
of course, we can rename stats
because you get hilarious shit when Luck is involved
the "whatever stat you can justify" is the best part
roll d6, multiply it by whatever stat you can justify, compare to someone else doing the same thing/target number
that's probably my favorite thing about it, though simplicity has its own drawbacks
maid's conflict resolution is *wonderfully* simple
should be top result
it'd be faster if you googled it tbh
magical fury is the same thing except someone else made it and it was slightly different
if you don't know what pbta is don't sweat it
magical burst is basically a Powered by the Apocalypse engine game based around magical girls
to at least *some* degree
it's fine but it's predicated on magical girls being suffering
my pdf reader is full of my personal shame
now I kind of hope they have a shield gear in XV
nice
I'm really thinking rickety robot using Aegis
I say anything goes
this is the goofy b-team right
I was thinking of a shitty robot running vocaloid
but maybe you can take specific elements from xdu
I'm going to guess it'll simplify saki's life to say no
I'm thinking of an... experimental (mostly failed) attempt at making a non-human gear user
it's not absurd to think that another relic could be more direct about it
gungnir 'infected' hibiki
I mean
the trait lists in these are usually not meant to be comprehensive
ps in trait-based systems like OVA don't be afraid to ask the GM if you can just invent a trait if it's suitable
brutal
-2 to every dice pool
because GMs are mean
having a relationship to an NPC is always a weakness
so I'm set
I've got a wonderfully stupid idea
wholesome
what power rules would you set down
hit me up if you ever come across it
I ran evangelion games, I am highly used to bullshitting technical things
where were you going with this if it was on his left
but I guess the card art would be definitive
because I bet they do
do they use mirrored sprites
does it depend what side of the screen he's on
maybe it has a phonic gain capacitor or something
invent your own technobabble?
if you feel constrained by not finding the perfect relic in history you could probs just invent one
or has-totally-always-been-historical-despite-inventing-it-for-this-game
or newly named
well, previously nameless
some nameless sacrificial knife?
inventing attack cards
it'd be neat to have one that did
do any of the show's gears have a non-weapon element to them?
also poseidon's trident sounds neat
and that might make aegis make sense, in hopes that the relic made the autoscorer more durable
I was thinking frail and naive
autoscorer is a good idea, I like the idea of elfnein trying and making a kind of bad one and having to borrow earth technology to make it work at all
I'm def going with shield
saki what's our power limitations
I love playing thief characters but I don't think this is the fit for it
but am not sure
I *think* she used them at one other point in s1
well she has those shotgun punches
because every girl has one except maybe hibiki
ranged option
it's too big to directly upload to discord
a channel would probably be good even if we do use roll20
I think so
but offensively isn't what I'm going to stat it to be good at
since it was supposed to belong to minerva/zeus
it might be lightning based
beyond just smacking someone with a shield
I have to come up with some mildly effective attack for aegis
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I tried searching 'mythical cestus' but nothing solid
hm
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
dodge offset's so hard to master
I need to play more bayonetta
oh wrong channel gg me
I like working the opposite way
It's funny that the system wants you come up with abilities first and weaknesses second
lol
if rightclick>save file is more your thing

I imagine we all get transformation+X for free
always gives room for upgrades though
whew, keepin us low
bethesda can't QA a game to save their lives
the general response is "I'm glad to hear it's a genuine port"
I remember when skyrim came out on the switch there were a bunch of complaints of bugs on reddit
2018 mainline Pokemon after all
She should wear a thicker shirt
and everyone else telling them "no it's fine, it's a faithful port"
my favorite thing about skyrim switch was the reddit threads complaining about bugs
but this seems to be a little excessive for that
two hours ago I was thinking switch was likely
I've seen theories that it's fallout 0, that it's fallout 3/4 on switch, and that it's fallout Newer Vegas (obsidian said it's not them)
I'll probably bite
thought nintendo was phasing that out
huh
megaman 11's going to have an amiibo edition
lel
Smash
Depended on game
Sometimes
Except for battle frontier which did involve ev/iv bullshit
The single players always been more about the adventure than the battle system anyway
Hot take: it looks more fun than another game of ev/iv bullshit
It's for fun
They're called voxels
Obsidian already said they weren't involved
It's a joke
The other one will sell even more
It looks fun and it'll sell
I heard cubelock's down to a 17% winrate against baku hunter
the effect is stronger, usually
baku is probably a safer bet
remember when EA shut down the star wars game because it was single player
what the hell
I tried that pokemon switch/mobile game and the third pokemon I got was a fucking shiny
it's not fun because it never accomplishes anything
I tried freeze shaman
he even had the ice pick card
that's adorable
oh my god I found a freeze shaman in hearthstone
I'll always know him for big o
since I'll never get a new arcadia game
put üëè vyse üëè back üëè in üëè it
"Persona 6" is kind of a different deal than, say, "Persona Golf," dragon
they've been trying to make it do just that with poorer and poorer results
the persona name isn't going to sell by itself
the original 2ds is the stupid tablet thing
a new 2ds
Essentially
I may be on my way to getting out of hs at the rate I've been playing the last few months
Not sure I'm in for hsreplay though
I do and I meant to get your igns (though my eu account is probably so old I have welcome back quests on it)
hadronox druid has a few flaws, the biggest of which being that it's *hadronox* druid
fair
I could
I mean I have the cards
what shall it be
time to make a new druid deck
Might be translator washed
bad planning
that's why you kill them after they get to the destination
it won me a game I'd been deathwing'd out of
ok maybe the wisp card isn't a meme
I guess there's cataclysm
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
so
all the solid discard synergy rotated out this year
get a imp portal
discard cards
rip
I have a golden warlock quest that will never be good
I was thinking of reviving "Balls in your Malf" but now I'm using Lunara
Now I have to figure out what to name it
that's pretty memey
oh I could put the wisps in
I'm thinking about token druid
maybe
GuP as a series isn't my favorite but the movie was worth watching the series
Nah it still has a huge library even if there'll probably only be 3-4 more big releases
enjoying it a lot
actually yes
HAHA MEMES GET IT
I have no idea about sniper
hitman go and lara croft go were actually good games
it'd be so rad if it got delayed another 2 years
just like pretty much every long-running franchise that isn't an arcade game
it's solidly overrated
I'm pretty fine with 7 remake never coming out
Drakengard was basically the worst dynasty warriors game ever made, gameplay wise
He can never escape that sin
I fucking played drakengard
Except when he doesnt
Yoko Taro: yeah lmao
I forgot how good this article was
S: I don't know any ex-yakuza running orphanages.
K: There was one a few years ago. A good guy. 
M: You sure it wasn't just a tax shelter?
K: Sure it was a tax shelter but he ran it like a legitimate thing. You know.
her poor spine
amazing how I see the word "nodoka" and think of a manga I haven't read in 10 years
*titanium mahjong pieces*
and end up with a blank
saki: so you can't rub out the 1-stick I assume
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
are we talking about how much we enjoy Saki
I tried the demo
Oh shit free golden classic pack next week in hearthstone
Yeah they invented a decent amount
I love all the moves they had to invent for her
I have no idea
I think so?
god she's adorable in this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWf-EOcqffA
it has the full s1 castlist
you forgot super heroine chronicle
you got good numbers
alice I'll play you
oh god this hearthstone brawl
I respect them for playing it
yeah someone scheduled a tweet wrong
ü§î ü§î ü§î
https://twitter.com/E3/status/1004551015893352448
mahjong is like poker but even more nonsensical from an outside point of view
possibly odd??
quest druid
odd mage
I'm also okay at platformers
board games, I guess
I am bad at shootems
the 7 minion limit gets in the way very fast
1 mana is single
2 mana is all
<@!127644949884698624> 3 automatons on the board is 24 damage if you've got baku
a way to not lose games
is it even DOA anymore?
Not that I think the sentiment is totally misplaced, but...
the DOA5 western ban must have really got to them
wow
they put an rpg maker on 3ds so idk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp4fxe75810
yeah that might have been it
there's supposed to be a splatoon announcement today
and adorable
counterpoint: the metroid amiibo is squishy
~~it's even dumber that I bought the amiibo for it~~
It's really dumb that fusion mode is amiibo locked
**VR PEGGLE**
let's bring in
last time we had kinect support
"impressed by EA's bold decision to continue to make games" was a tweet I saw that summed up my feelings
it's a bit stale
it's fifa and lootboxes
maybe they'll announce *minecraft 2*
~soon‚Ñ¢~
https://twitter.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1005683145990025216
it never ends
hahahaha
KH3 has a 2019 release date
I mean
yes
time to play fallout on the switch

god hand's a bit more cautious
hibiki is about going balls deep
the more I think about it the more those two don't fit
I feel like something really stylized and fluid would fit hibiki more than a million combos
hibiki as viewtiful joe 3
hibiki as god hand feels wrong to me
that's pretty thin
only... let's give them the benefit of the doubt and say 16 characters
they'd need to crossover though
it could be okay
hm
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
that's the mobile game
that's not TE6
it's a joke
I expect the price will fluctuate
or a new one
is it a port of the original chaos
it's oblivion 2
you're not getting more than a promo shot
yeah I don't think they even have an engine for TES6 finished yet
I'm not sold on 76
yes
and closed by announcing they were actually putting elder scrolls on a phone
they opened up with joking about putting skyrim on alexa
looks to be microtransaction as fuck tbh
Elder Scrolls Blades
but essentially yes
no
dess_roll 5d999
dess_roll 1d999
what vault number should I pick<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
did you ever watch upotte

AW YEAH
these inanimate-objects-as-girls gatcha games really love that panty design

<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
I remember how brutal it was waiting for Heaven's Feel to drop from mirror moon
I'm no longer on ADD medication and there are more things to do online
VNs are harder now
I'm aware
I never have and I need to fix that someday
Insani's, actually, if you remember them from the ~golden age~
because it was a fan project once long ago
it has multiple translations
a long time
it's been free for
young people in a hospice
it's a series about uh
narcissu 2 probably
god can you imagine a studio being brave enough to do narcissu
well I guess most KEY things got decent adaptations
*meme incoming*
or Tsukihime
like Fate
including big ones
most VNs aren't
it was actually really well done
did you see the anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA6qbpGBeug
F/SN had some gooood bgms assuming you didn't play rualta nua
this is fairly pretty
like Wind
I remember getting inordinately attached to some that were honestly kind of trash
it's weird to think that mirrormoon changed that almost singlehandedly
bible black or generic eroge
inhospitable for anything that wasnt like...
The market back then was just
I'm really sad that the company who adapted it went out of business
it's almost like you're pavlovian trained to cry
it's emotional enough as is and they hammer it in really well during certain scenes
haven't played the game in a complete decade but *the feels*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LczqkQAm_kw this still fucks me up tbh
also I think it felt like there was a secret ending I didn't get but there wasn't?
r11's pretty great but I think I either spotted a plothole or didn't understand something properly
never7's kind of shit honestly
despite its flaws thats probably my favorite VN
fuckin e17 man
yeah it was alright
because it was the same twist as ever17 (same author) but not done as well
999 annoyed me
this is easily sony's worst designed conference so far
anti-hype
this is like
what kind of system is this
this is awful
Lesbius 2
l e s b i a n s
maybe
days gone
beyond good and evil still has no release date l o l
what
ubisoft is doing a star fox game
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
>BG&E2 still doesn't have a release date
shirabe wouldn't lie to us
it exists?!
it's never too late for trademark fights
because it'll be funny
I hope KH3 has a catastrophic problem late in development and has to be pushed to 2020
wow
sony managed to lose e3
as I said, pretentious
sony has gone full pretentious
(ZS suiting up for her final smash feels like it defeats the point, by the way)
Samus and ZS Samus are different fighters
third
*waaaaaaaay*
yeah FE's waaaaaaaaaay overdone
Metroid doesn't need that much representation
??? big bads don't have to be in though
actually
I'm hoping Dark Samus is an echo fighter
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
it's nice that he's in but
I'm a huge metroid fan but I never understood the *need* to have him in smash
"every fighter returns, let's take 10 fucking minutes to talk about a tiny cosmetic change we made to each individual's fucking final smash"
kind of a boring announcement tbh
yeah but they'll just come back
I remember the john cena dating sim
but as a mobige
brave little toaster
also because it's less bad about punishing you for not being perfect
I prefer isaac because it's easier
64 character trailers
dang
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1lIms2gwaB6ytzNm2IVd0JvnDXbLKTh
they needed to roll this out two or three years ago
it'll never work
https://steamcommunity.com/updates/chatupdate steam's trying to catch up to discord
I can't read "reject my humanity" without following it with JOJO!! in my head anymore

*mario party's ditching the fucking car*
bigger even than smash
also let's not forget the *actual* important news
The trailer seemed to imply co-op
Kawamori on mechanical design would have sold me alone
https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1006597069895819265
the staff list on the project is good
I'm also excited about Not-Armored Core
I was guessing smash would release then to encourage people to buy it
the paid online service releases in september
...Wait, what are they going to release in september then? What else has the power to force people to buy the online service?
It's coming out a lot later than I expected
I'm curious how they swung that with konami
the roster is everyone
smash's roster got revealed
I really like most of the QoL changes
haha
like the tourian escape
stuff
it needed more gimmicky stuf
like, they bothered to tell us about the obvious fact we're getting the "I hate fun" final destination stage variants again
I feel like we would have gotten an announcement of that
sure, but they're not anymore
mwahaha
it's my microwave
it's me
*depraved*
you're all depraved
crafting waifus
it's not on NA till tomorrow but EU's had it a while
golden pack
it might be too late for EU idk
<@284390402210136064> you should probably log onto hearthstone asap
lewd
'kawaii drones' is a redundant statement
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
you
don't do this
this hearthstone brawl is awesome but so slow
it's a report card
pretty sure it was actual hype that was meant to be put down there
oh
did we watch the same joke of a conference
sony was hype?
Same organism as metroid prime
Dark Samus is a different life form and dead now
I really hope so
but we had even less footage of that
the ninja fight one
there was another game that might be okay
isaac was probably the most expensive double dip
I've double dipped a few times
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I have probably too many switch games
and uses hd rumble well
golf story is pretty funny
I play online boardgames a lot
during the summer sale
I think I'm mostly going to get boardgame DLC
female, I'd imagine

DMjii is the only ship needed

I was kind of hoping for a Nintendo Labo kit #3 at e3 tbh
~~look at the excitement for smash~~
I mean it's fine to rebuy the same game over and over with different titles
I mean from what I've heard buying 5 neptunia games isn't all that different from buying the same one 5 times
twice
I have it
gunvolt wasn't cheap either
Nice Boat
Yeah zolgnein I feel it's not worth the diplomacy hit and the cleanup, because by then my war machine is revved up hard anyway
If Phoenix wright can be in mvc3 light could have been in this
I pretty much never actually use nukes
they mishandled the gunbuster pachinko and that caused Anno's war on gainax
yeah
considering pachinko killed gainax
I wonder if trigger will go anywhere near pachinko
it can still be a pachinko machine

I think hair color matters a lot
though to be fair people actually *looked like that* in the part of the world she was from
I'm really into seafoam green hair on brown skin ~~because that was an old tabletop character of mine~~
Exotic is frequently hot
it looks like you can see blue pubes but I think it's just a lighting effect
I've had more diplo and econ, and tech wins than total subjugation
I rarely go for military conquest
It'll be made in flash
graphically
it looked fantastic
neat
oh shining resonance has a demo on switch
ü§î
Arcane magick

you got a month

if you mean a hardcore run of SRW I think I lose maybe like
he also turns their eyes blue
I like how mario not only gives things mustaches
I liked primrose when I played her back in the first demo
probably
oh
what button am I pushing
ok
yes
I have no idea what I'm doing on this menu
...not all though
I mean I can read some of this
ugh but I have to learn interface and make account
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105> would be more accurate
god dammit I'm still mad I didn't go for greed and try to get the winds

it takes
goddammit died in hollow knight again
or needed
he needs to do something about those honor tiles though
yes
that's what you were dealt?
well then
rekt
I feel like this is more convergent evolution than anything else
=3=
Or the one who uttered `rather racist remarks` at least
That would be the racist
when isn't it
out of their hate for nintendo
they decided to give everyone who doesn't have a switch an extra copy
something
it's not a good game, exactly, but it's
yes
I always think of shirobako with mahjong because some pivotal scenes happen around a table
if only that was actual money
yuck
Wow that's pretty hetero

It depends what you're trying to do

I was like why is everyone a weird race and then remembered that 3.5 d&d is all about mechanics first
I like how the robe gives her a butterfly look

4 was kind of big
did people really not know about armored core
+++++++++++++
It's very good but I wish you didn't have to actually do gameplay
I've played a few hours
Yay it's a square

let me get a screenshot I took of the game
oh man
but I'm not going to stop using Jehuty Bomber
as one of the 6 people in the world to own the game I'm pleased

Oh *shit*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XopQBfMnyBI
aw sten is such a princess
moist nuggets
she sure likes leather
as you can see it's the same shape as her crystal
it's a *gigantic* plot element in xenosaga
it was the save point in xenogears and was kind of background relevant
it's in all of them
great "HEY THIS IS A XENO GAME" callout right away
I like how pyra's crystal is a zohar
I just got poppi and am ~~grinding tiger tiger~~ about to move on
chapter two
and not in a positive way
it's like their primary objective was to make her the perfect waifu
it's such a flashy character design to go with a yamato nadeshiko attitude on
Pyra/houmura's japanese voice annoys me
I may or may not play with english voices on another playthrough
I'm using japanese voices
I thought Hana sounded familiar
look at this angel
but she ~~is stronger than pyra~~ protects me
I want to protect her
Poppi/Hana alpha is so adorable
she is quickly becoming powerful
I might have to play through this game a second time one day just so I'm aware what the english voices sound like
poppi/hana is adorable though
ok
easy mode makes it
despite complaining about it I've played it like 10 times in a row
xenoblade 2
why do jrpgs wish to injure the player
oh boy a bad minigame that's mandatory to power up a character
she is more or less fully upgraded
I played it for like an hour trying to get the damn tank cpu III for the sidequest
right now it doesn't matter because poppi is 150% going to carry me for a while
most of the abilities ain't great though
ok yeah the ability to just not use charge on your driver arts is good
I might actually stick with a 1 crown blade over this lmao
not compelling
a forgetful bird thing with a hammer
I mean she's a tank which I guess I needed on Rex but
it sucks and I hate it
oh hey I got the aoi yuki blade
BK1 and 2 honestly have my favorite jrpg plot twists ever
BK2/0/whatever you want to call it had a similar "FUCK" moment that only truly works if you played the first
~~baten kaitos 3 **when**~~
this isn't my first monosoft game
yeah fair
it's usually something something something humanity's connection to god
and the camera control was not good
3ds version was uggo
I actually don't know if I saw it anywhere in XC1 but I didn't get that far in it
tasbot run's coming up
celeste speedrun has been done
Celeste is possibly going to be the best game released in 2018 so you all should play and beat it
TASBot's doing Celeste coming up
I'm a little tempted to get blade strangers
like all the other gundam breakers, I'd imagine
eyy got amuro in xenoblade
I played the demo and decided I wouldnt buy it when I *could not* activate special shot despite the tutorial telling me 'how'
I really have to wonder how many actual wedding dresses these character designers have seen sometimes
those shoulders are lewd
```complete immediately```
complete immediately
does the AI ever cancel attacks
so I'm switching to the HAMMER OF JUSTICE amuro ray
despite looking nothing like one
who is a tank for some reason
wind hammer bird
time to switch hibiki out for amuro ray
ugh I'm up to 3 wind users
I like the Rex/Nia/Poppi formation
oh no they're making me change formation
I thought the inn idea was really cool but it kind of makes me wish you could have them 'take it away'
I cashed some of it in at the inn to take down a unique
how much of a danger is being overlevelled in xenoblade 2
yeah they did
he's an old acquaintance of mine and I still find it annoying
these are amazing though
PUHAHAHA
PWUHUHUHUHA
but it's coming up next
there was a race a few days ago
blushy-crushy doesn't get anywhere close so
adorable would probably suffice
xenoblade translated 'moe' as 'blushy-crushy' and I'm upset
ha
the demo's pretty short
how am I supposed to tell if it's chris without visible cleavage
KH plot is... lol
you'll still need 2.8 for the 'full' stupid experience
and 2.8 for the 3ds one
that covers most of the games doesn't it
you could get HD 1.5 and 2.5
xenobleido
is there a mechanic that lets me jump wide gaps without a skill check node because I have no idea how I'm meant to get to this quest point
all about hitting that 30% hp mark
powerset is interesting though
her uh
~~the funny part is I'm thinking xenogears and not sympho~~
blades, whatever
'gears'
because you won't *need* to
like don't put too many gears on Rex
because I have been *told* some *things*
80% of my gears are on Nia
but to be fair
she's on nia, I'm not sure if I want her to be on nia
how nice
oh it works in embed

she's uhhhh
I just got Azami
you've made her too strong
it's kirichan's encouragement
shirabe firing off like her variable's set at 10% today
but I'd argue it's *not inherently bad*
because that's what it is
Here we're running smack into censorship
it ended too soon
it's exactly the right blend of adorable and uncomfortable
this skit is excellent
*Poppi*
my heart
oh no elfnein is teaching pyra how to be meido-like
~~and then in the next game they released a case that revolved around rakugo comedy and the difference between soba and udon noodles~~
because it was just too thick with context
I remember they ended up completely canning one of the ace attorney DLCs
a lot of times it isn't
sometimes the source material is sacred
not everything that ends up in the final product is always good
I consider it as another editing pass
that said I am 100% down for this skit where pyra/houmura seeks tora's advice to become more meido-like
the "See Also" category should give you a good hint
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_nadeshiko
ideal japanese woman - the kind who's a docile wallflower who's eager to gracefully please
the further they can move her the better
she's way too much the ideal yamato nadeshiko in the original script
I will say that the translation improves pyra as a character
that's because you're already neck deep in the culture it's pulling from
I agree with the sentiment that localizers have a liberty to rewrite the script somewhat to cater to markets
I don't object to it too much
and possibly nopons in general
also I love how much clearer the japanese makes it that Tora is a trashpile
her design makes a lot more sense to me when I think how she's earth-aspected
that explains some of it
ah
>designed by baten kaitos character designer
I just got her and I have no idea what to make of her character design
because I was like "how the fuck do I break these fucking orbs"
which I was happy to
yes
I'm on 3
chapter 8
I've heard the tutorial 'ends' in like
I am 26 hours in and I still have a ??? on my pause menu
but it's hard to grip it all at first
it makes for a deep game, because there's usually about 4-5 things you need to be keeping track of at once in any given non-trivial fight
of game mechanics
a lot
xenoblade 2 has
if you're talking to me I'm referring to game mechanics
26 hours into xenoblade and I'm only just figuring out what some of the things they told me ages ago mean
also she ends almost every line with "„Åß„Åô„ÇÇ" which is going to give me a heart attack
in any incarnation
elfnein cannot be lewded
her shield turns into a drill
she is ultimate
I can't get over how powerful elfnein is 

just visually

look at my precious child

CBT was so good they made CBT2
yeah but what about mine
I feel pain
why are you using it
I hate the abbreviation CBT
I want you to know
Alice
~~maybe I'll roll Knight and make Aegis~~
Also zero makes up for a lot
3 had severe issues but I can see someone still having fun
Haha drakengard 1 and 2
And in fact some of his games have been really bad
Well, yoko taro has never been for everyone
Wow
Is this a mechanical complaint or a thematic complaint
Nier 1 made me cry and it's a game full of flaws

Automata will be great when I get to play it
busted
like, I left after they released the first section of the first new island
granted I played before most of the content dropped
it was bad
but you can't ever convince me to log in
I have the beta hat in MS1
ü§î
it looks like maplestory but 3d
it's maplestory but 3d

Kancolle had gameplay
these aren't that bad
oh wait I got the names confused
"Kill this level 90 mob"
a bunch of them are like

oh my god

I'm the only one who has to work

I should go do that right now be- oh

Fans who pre-order Shining Resonance Refrain on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, will receive the game in a collectible metal slipcase, featuring character artwork of Excella, Sonia, and Kirika.
is it coming out physical
but I probably will
I shouldn't buy it
AMAZING
SHE HAS LOCKPICKING

I'm all in on this
lightning punch girl
got a rare
oh my god
your playthrough's going to be different from everyone else's
it's not too bad, honestly, because if nothing else
but have other uses in a subsystem
the way you get your weapons/allies(same shit) is you open core crystals and most of them are commons that you'll never actually use in combat past chapter 2
I *need* kosmos
why did they put gatcha in xenoblade
and I'm thankful
that's a direction collectathons have moved away from
I also dislike their need for *every* gem
I feel like the old ones don't hold up as well
gonna be honest
they're basically push notifications
I mean the popups don't interrupt you
Shining dessonance is now on preorder
(xenoblade)
there's so many random weapon/trait combinations I'd really like to have that common blades no longer annoy me
merc missions have made me hate gatcha a lot less
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
are you ready for a disconnect
is itaba from symphogear
lightning punch girl
oh fuck me
kinky
I am 45 hours into this game and just discovered the X button opens up the quick travel menu directly
what if you don't get an invite
I'm *moving it*
wrong channel
maybe it's all just under her skintight jumpsuit
when like everyone else of her island does
why does Nia not have fur
melee is generally really good
aside from the shard
exotic weapons are really fun but not worth the investment
I generally go navy with light psi
the broken part of psi is more jacking your hacking stat through the roof
it's really bad at attacking
psi is really good at making you good at anything for a little while
psi is really good at very specific things
too many times
*yes*
yes
yes
there is no way I'm finishing xeno before the 10th
that reminds me I need to play more bayo
And hard
It's goofy
I got to the xenoblade crossover event shit
I wish it was another week or two away tbh
I want to chew through more of xeno
I preorder if it's a game I *know* I will buy even if it's bad or if it has a good pedigree and physical goodies
It gets me a better display case for free and the game comes out in like 5 days
the music in this part of the game is extremely good
she also has gigantic hips
but not too much
yeah she has the slight tinge of bitch
Nia is like my perfect sweet spot between perky and annoying
~~second writing pass~~
xenoblade 2
thanks, mandatory jrpg onsen scene
ok so nia does not have fur under her jumpsuit
alice is becoming a mobige queen
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
and it's amazing
fucking zone music
this is just

xenoblade 2
I'd recognize those eyes and noodle arms anywhere
yeah she was
... she has to be designed by the code geass person
that sounds guro as hell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-B0r4ujm-c
I can't keep a straight face through her summoning animation
I got a new rare blade
oh my god xenoblade why
>warframe on switch
that was amazing
I think if the game ended right here I would be fine with that
this plotline and chapter completely justified xenoblade 2's purchase all by themselves
for me
so
but *dem physics*
her design is cool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-B0r4ujm-c
her summon animation is *uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*
saki did you see the blade I pulled
Hana is best character
this artificial blade plotline is everything I could have wanted
I've been looking for this skill for about 30 hours
OH THANK GOD I have fortitude now
this plotline has had like 8 mecha anime references
pc too shit
I've never played
whaaaaaaaaaaaat
just like real life <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
bethesda is so bad at understanding the first two games
if you're not ready for them you're going to probably fail them
in terms of timing
they're also relatively tight
QTEs that ruin your platinum medal in the middle of a cutscene are horseshit
which tanks your score
they are instant death
bayo 2 did all that but slightly mucked up the combat system with umbran climax
oh, and the removal of the QTEs
bayonetta is a few lines of camera code and palette shifts away from being absolute art
EVERY GAME IS NOW MARIO KART
EXTREME RUBBER BANDING
'one of'
I think almost every fanhack assumes that you find grinding fun and exciting and love to do it and would do it even if they didn't ask
so maybe I'll live shitpost switch games in the future
anyway this made me set up a second twitter account just to upload switch screens to
humidity
a beer pool
why is there a pool and bar in your room
again, this is just sidequest stuff
DOUBLE POPPI
well I'll do one more
ü§î
if you don't I'll feel less bad spoiling this sidequest
do you have the DLC
I think that'll be the last poppi image though
**:3**
poppi comes in all shapes and sizes to be loved by all
it is also poppi
~~behind her is the new blade~~
my precious child
I am 100% behind the fact that the DLC quest that gets you a DLC blade is 80% about Poppi

why
xenoblade just implied that the nopons who worked on artificial blades drew smut of them
oh my god
and getting a no death run wasn't *incredibly important* for scoring
if failure wasn't death
I'd be fine with the QTEs
mmm torn leggings
someone's gotta have pissed in the beer pool
that's a good point
no

as opposed to hyrule warriors which has something like 38
7 actual movesets
because there's like
or rather, a shittier roster
I heard FE has more interesting maps but shittier heroes
I have hyrule
how is FE warriors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4CNimXZ-Lc I still love this spritework
mugen no frontier is not technically noncanon
unless you count everything kos-mos found her way into
gears, saga, and blade are the only real xeno games
it's a dbz game
verse is unrelated
but 1 and 3 are good
episode 2 is a shitfest
I have to warn you
oh *lord* xenosaga
oh lord xenosaga
not menu-based
it's realtime combat
there's a demo out
shining resonance refrain is a port of a game that is apparently an A- quality JRPG that has a lot of the same themes and voice actors as symphogear
this steel jacket is really nice
I'm actually glad I preordered
I have scouts
üëÄ
especially since I suspect I might be the one behind
*fair*
Steel jacket physical edition get
slurp
if I did that I'd just replay the games I know are good
and I don't really want to play the same system every game
I mean that, without adding seconary systems like grid-based movement or something, which turns it into more than just a turn based RPG, we're running into... if not a wall, then a fence, of difficulty to find new ideas that aren't just clutter
I feel turn based has some hard limits in terms of ability to innovate on
you can also forcefully override them to cast important spells (like healing or something) on demand
or enemies hit certain health %s
you can command them to focus on healing or attacking or to switch tactics when they hit certain health %s
I mean, tales has ways to control that
most of the time you could count on your AI buddies to take care of themselves
symphonia wasn't all that busy though
~~I haven't played since Symphonia~~
that just got announced
the new hearthstone expansion
it's very engaging but I can see it being overwhelming
you have to be thinking about like 6 things at the same time
avoid xenoblade 2 at all costs lmao
too much to focus on?
but it's a similar concept
from what I played in the demo it's not as fast and chainy as tales combat
a worse version of the tales series, yeah
it's like
time to play xenoblade <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
gotta love a heavy armor design that manages to still have a boob window and exposed thighs
~~how do I get Nia and Poppi into this game~~
*voices*
but consider
ok
...nah
do I port the demo save over?
got it down to an hour
gonna move it closer to the router
2 hour download time dang
big
seems uh
I didn't see
now downloading the SRR japanese voice pack
I think the winged monster is supposed to be hibiki there
yeah they both have piano circles
I can't see those damn symphogear subtitles without thinking of `a determination to fist`
but I see what you mean
I mean I think it's more copying the final fantasy thing
Celeste is still goty 2018 for me and I haven't seen a game to contend that yet
It urges you to try again
Celeste isn't controller throw inducing
Music is also incredible
Celeste
Basa is a trash girl trying to be cool
Tsubasa is slightly towards cheering but is close to home
Google it it was common a few months ago
I did miss out on the -10% preorder bonus on the eshop
But it's the small things
I mean it's just a steel jacket around the plastic case, and a transparent label package around that
very pleased with the launch edition case tbh
she jiggles too much for that to be true
it's always been so core to gameplay for me, huh
why play mario kart if you can't drift

<@!127644949884698624> you know about mecha jaraxxas right
golf had some weirdo rpg story
I am thinking of golf
wait
I thought mario tennis was on gbc

this is their idea of heavy armor
outside
awkward
made a early game cutscene
it uh
which I did and which I probably should not have done
where you can, if you save up way too much money, buy a swimsuit armor in the first town
this reminds me of xenoblade 1
oh my god
it's not tiny
the japanese voice DLC took an hour to download over a decent connection
keeps the filesize down I guess
a lot of games seem to be going that way these days
it's free dlc
you actually have to jump through a hoop to get japanese
yes
shining dessonance refrain
I still haven't gotten past the demo part
that would be amazing
does such a thing exist

there's a non-zero chance I'll like yuma later but
you can be a boy and not a fucking bland wallpaper boy

it'd also be closer to fine if Yuma didn't suck
headpat
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>  how did it take you so long
yuma is the shittiest part of the game so far
it changes the plot so antagonist team joins you
lol
I'm not playing refrain mode
but she's so borderline nsfw
I'd post the main character of code of princess
I'm aware of the back
they're not, of course, but an attempt has been made
most non-nero saber armor variants are almost reasonable
I got 2.3k retweets with that image

I'd argue crash is less of a loss
but I'll never sit at my PC and play
I value it because there's loads of games that are fun
ups the chance of a cool special edition
but delaying works in your favor
I didn't think there'd be a switch pokemon at all in 2018 tbh
main title is 2019
you can still be excited
also random T next to it
where does the SS Anne go
It's less fun when the person who should be holding the key is uh, not there
or at least a lifestyle one
it's a [fucking] [collar]
one has a visible lock on it
I am still in the opening cutscene because everything not involving excella is boring as shit
so many fucking collars

Didn't you post your beer pool boat club
it's called fortnite because you have to wait two weeks when you're the first one killed
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Apparently it's a "good" enough battle royale to bring people adrenaline rushes that they get addicted to
I'd argue that Fortnite's success is a metric of its quality even if you and I find things to not like about it
~~including me~~
everyone would have bought it
If that was an actual feature of the game

What about oppai loli guns
this isn't azur lane, why does dragon have so many flat-top carriers
>meme arrows
alice we are already friends
nghhhhhhhhhhhh
alice talk me out of buying the hearthstone bundle
it was sweet
and assassin ended up winning because she was an uploaded consciousness of a member of the race that built the grail because she hacked into it to try to get immortality and had the ability to steal other noble phantasms
and it was the future
only the servants were giant robots
this is reminding me of the game I played in where it was a holy grail war
 è·¥á·¥á  ú·¥Ä·¥°
in arena
omega mechanic's going to be so toxic
Why do they need to be there?
if it was anything more than a temp slap I'd be mad
it's a reasonable wordfilter I feel like
the game about shooting people
rainbow six siege
it's just called nightmare amalgam now
I mean we still have spider tank
the first of which we do not want in standard and the second of which is less good than it used to be
the only ones worth anything are mechwarper and shredder
Most of the wild mechs are out-powercreeped now
There will obviously be a bunch of mechs in this expansion
but it's shit
It has most of the problems charge does
It's charge but shit
Magnetic's really fucking weird and I think I hate it
a simpler explaination
this is

though I once spent 300 dollars on a board/cardgame kickstarter
hard in on boardgames
a friend of mine is like
I also know some good games
it's like a million free games
why what's the game

yes and yes for like 40 minutes max
I thought portal was an 09 release for some reason
my bad, 07
and it's had like 3 people on the dev team for about 5 years now
It's worth noting TF2 came out in 2009 where gaming toxicity was not as much of a recognized problem
*the fact this is a competitive deck hurts my soul*
`Azalina Togwaggle Druid`
tempo mage please no
that's not even the toxic card
honestly
I'm unsure how to take these sentences
every character in TF2 is supposed to be a horrible person that you're not supposed to empathize with
this is a "everyone should be entitled to play without having to *tolerate* nastiness" thing
This isn't a "get out if you can't take the heat" thing
the recent anime craze glosses over the fact that they're not permitted to have any kind of life and they have stalkers and shit
idol culture is really fucking shit and fucked up
the bottom of it too
does she know the top of her dress seems to have fallen off
it's a really good fit on the Switch
that said I'd say Celeste
the only major single player game that hasn't been mentioned is xenoblade I think
anyway gimme a sec to look at my collection wfc
it does somethings better than xcom and xcom's lead dev said he's going to steal some ideas for his next iteration
Mario vs Rabbids is fairly excellent
I think the most fucked up part about me buying that kickstarter is *the digital version of the game is better* because it tracks numbers
so
and emulators suuuuuuuuuuuck
the problem is I can't use amazon coins because I don't have a device that can run hurfstone
kinky
alice convince me not to buy
like hearthstone season cardbacks
what if they're minor
mew is under the truck
rip
unless you went to your other mom who is like "yeah whatever let's do it dess"
she'd be one of those moms who never let you get away with anything
shirabe had a baby?
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
qube
but which is cuter
hearthstone isn't worth it
don't do it alice
they will be useful during their 2 year run
yeah
I'm predicting an upgrade
ü§î  Yuma's weapon only has 3 aspect slots, everyone else has 4
she wants the dragon d
kirika's shrine maiden fangirling is good
yeah and they stopped doing that
I ran cho seriously for a while though
he was meme viable
he was never viable
use him
he's still there
I miss mechmage
g&g was really good
I still don't have malygos orz
I'm not rich, I've just been playing since 2013
the best 35 legendary deck is paladin imo
it's nicer that it cuts everyone else's MP costs
it's nice to control a dragon I guess
a tutorial on Yuma's super mode
but apparently the first boss is uh

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I finally made it to actual combat in shining dessonance
if there ever is a control hunter emeriss might make it in
it's not competitive even slightly but if you want to dick around and make it work you can win a game with it
emeriss is a meme card
oh
recruit hunter runs shaw
that's actually not true
because people stop playing to ladder
hearthstone is not exceptionally skill testing
no
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
10 gigs wtf alice why is ms2 so big
and now it's like "a 2/4 for 3? meh, needs some kickass text"
because almost every 2 drop ran was a 3/2
dalaran mage used to be a 2/4 and it was nerfed because 2/4 was a busted statline
man I miss antique hearthstone
you were going to get 0-2 cards from him and your opponent wasn't the factor in determining how many
or even coined him
if you played him on turn 2
a lot
people complained
games were decided on coinflips a lot
it used to trigger at the end of your turn
no
nat pagle will probably be the only 0/4 to ever get a nerf
with yogg
and one I've only ever seen one other time
nat pagle was the hot debate
anyway tinkmaster deserved a nerf but oh boy
though we had mulch for a while
naturalize didn't start worth being even possible to play until maybe 2 years ago
they had no other removal worth running, besides swipe
it would never have left druid's list
though it was a 2/2
yeah
nat pagle was nerfed too
what a weird thing to think about
it was in every deck at one point
It's been nerfed
tinkmaster isn't bad either
one you dont need
yeah
you're going to pull it soon from classic packs anyway
no dont
same
this reference is really old
what was the screensaver with the flying toasters called
aside from maybe the final dungeon
but it makes up by having no real padding
it's a really snappy and short jrpg
oh I see they rank up
it looks cracked and shit
also, I mean
you get some little shit micro unit with shroud or something and then pile a massive amount of enchantments and equipment on it
yes this is how voltron works in mtg
```I think for a magnetic kind of thing to work
you need a magnetic mech with 'cant target with spells or hero-powers' that is reasonably cheap```
if they release a card that says "when a magnetic card attaches, gain mega windfury" or something stupid, the assesment changes
mind you, this is an assessment based on magnetic for what it is
I'd more likely believe magnetic would end up in a combo deck rather than an aggro one
like zapomatic
not worth filling your deck with mechs unless the mechs are, by themselves, really good
the flexibility is nice, but again
there are many more solutions to dealing with a single big target than lots of medium ones
that's not how you win
aggro never wants to make a single giant body
if you could attach it to any minion it might almost be good
it's like charge but worse in 3 different ways
magnetic is not a good ability
and no
the 1/5 mech will probably be in every ~~quest paladin~~
but that'd just be Curator Mk II
if it had taunt and was a 5/5 it'd be great
ashmore's on the threshold of being good
firebat uses ashmore once in a while
but I don't think it'll be in many
it'll make at least one list, I think
it's solidly okay
it's okay
silence or hard removal is as good an answer as ever
but
it's a nice buff package and if you actually land it on a mech that's serious lifegain
so less relevant
but without windfury
way better
well
Zilliax seems okay but I don't think it's good enough you'd run a tutor to draw it

I think you're overestimating how good zilliax is but ok
wow what a shitty interface
"Simply place your Magnetic Mech to the left of any Mech you‚Äôve already got on the board and they‚Äôll fuse ALL their stats and card text together into a bigger, more powerful minion! Need them to stay independent? No problem. Just place your Mech down to the right of an existing Mech (or next to any non-Mech minions), and they‚Äôll stay un-plugged to handle smaller tasks (and avoid getting blown up by powerful single-target effects or removal)."
we never need tools that powerful again
counterpoint
the 2 mana 2/2 will at least end up in even elemental
this might be the best card revealed so far in the expansion though
*and yes I know the source*
it's an mtg term
yes but that wasnt a voltron deck
this one is actually a card though
you can now make (bad) voltron decks in hearthstone
we've finally arrived
***Ouya***
I thought that was the one and only
You've been abusing her?!
>don't hit me
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I will force them to fawn over the spineless boy as is their preprogrammed fate
Ok so I don't have to pick
<@102691114762371072> saki-chan are the campfires reusable for more character scenes

Also my phone autosuggests saki-chan
also inner fire shenanigans
a 3/8 on turn 3 is kind of gross
priest has the best 3 mana buff in the game
I wonder if priest would run this in wild
hm
if your expected statline is so wildly uncontrollable, there are better options
because you pick a minion based on its expected statline, generally, if you're not picking based on ability
also just about every single "flip" worgen minion is really bad in constructed
or kings
it might even survive two turns so you can double bells
but it has an extra stat
sure, the 1/5 is also mediocre
except for warrior's
also they're all mediocre
1/4s die to a minion and hero power
ü§î
rewop peerc
or, in this case
*the powercreep is real*
3
we've never seen a 2 mana 1/5
it's purely for a really buffable body that won't get removed the next turn if played on curve
I wouldn't ever put magnetic minions in quest paladin
no
what?
but that's never more than a high t3
quest paladin will absolutely run it
it's a "maybe'
paladin, as a class, seems to get a lot of field buffs
and I'm not sure paladin aggro won't run the 1/5
it's usually not amazing in mtg but it's still far too reliable and reasonable a strategy for hearthstone to ever properly enable
Do we need to have a hoarding intervention
actually there are a few others that work too
I *need that green hair*
alice if I'm going to play this game seriously I'm going to need a level 50 heavy gunner
argh
sometimes
boys can be cool
I mean
oh you get to pick a boy they just don't feature in any keyart
the voices are all good though
they don't even let you pick boys in this game
oh my god
<@!127644949884698624> MECHA CTHUN
hearthstone what are you doing
oh my god
skill testing gameplay
like, the shadow of ptsd
thinking about flappy bird in arena feels vaguely traumatic
t minus 3 hours until I get to see whether my computer can handle a potential life ruining experience
I don't think preorders are the devil everyone else seems to but there's no reason to do it that far out
Reasonable
those are awful low on the hips

I know pubg had a problem with their events being fucking boring because of camping and hiding and other ways to win the game
Did they try to do an espurt thing
That is definitely not the same as kawaii desu ne

Maybe one day I'll go for the 200 strawberry file but I doubt it
I want to replay it to see badeline's grumpy ass
If all you care about is pure platforming I say celeste
Did you like banjo kazooie enough to be satisfied with a lesser version of it
There was a kickstarter a month ago or so for win10 compatible and futureproof versions 

A notable inclusion was myst 3, which did not have a legal digital version available for purchase in the last like 5 years
Yes
I'm excited to get my myst game keys soon
the deck recipies are so bad
worse than malchezzar by a long shot
whizbang is complete trash though
it's a good card, it's just meta dependant
it's still fine
it's randomly attack the left or right, obviously
playing around it isn't easy and you can counter-play around it by killing minions before you attack
it's not an automatic include but it's a solid deck building consideration
It's fine and you're underselling it
You clearly haven't played warrior in a while if you think you're dead to aggro by 5
this is very very solid
they're pricing magnetic too highly
Probably hearthpwn
I think card packs and stuff are fine but should be regulated
this game is satan
it'd take like 2 seconds after I hit F to interact
I exited because I was getting weird lag
someone was playing despacito in maplestory 2
is 2 armor worth running witchwood apple
the only good treant card is call of the forest and that's hella situational
the problem is poison seeds isn't a good card
poison seeds is pretty slick to lower the cost
the 10 8/8 might end up in wild
I'm not convinced
"you can play any card in your deck for 4 mana" is broken as hell and it highlights the peak power cards
they'd nerf malygos because it's why they have to be careful creating this kind of mechanic
unless there's a specific target
but generally not worth running a 2 or 3 drop that doesn't do anything
it's nice
it's not, really
if you destroy it early, you kill the maly combo
that's why ooze is currently in the meta
it would be with floop
it's a weak card on its own, so if it's for redundancy it's questionable
weak to ooze, long set up
twig is a much worse version of the combo though
I'd consider replacing twig
which means the final malygos druid deck in this expansion might not run it
you can't run oaken summons with floop
that said
because at this rate it's going to be hall of famed
<@!127644949884698624> I'd say there's a 70% chance you'll get a dust refund for malygos next year
???
it's a double edged sword
yes thank you
sounded great
someone was playing some rse pokemon beachtown theme on xylophone
but it sounds fine on piano
the champion music is not best on sax
saki can be on guitar
piano is okay too
anyway if you have some good sax 1 pieces I'd be interested
to afford instruments and shit
this is almost enough to get me to opt into the founder's package
we need more trio pieces
Symphogear concert in MS2 (sorry about the giant UI and potato graphics settings)
right
a card that came out in 2014 or something, didn't see much play then, and rotated out of standard 2 years ago
*wow*
They're nerfing shadowboxer
dominant kriisa
I need lavender town music for this game
I'm kidding but please behave <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>

<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
Only played it once though
Dead of winter is the zombie game? It was okay
A decent entry game but if you chew on it too long it gets stale
It's like... settlers of catan
Pandemic, pandemic is the big one
And it's okay
I remembered the big one
But I'll compile a list of coop boardgames when I'm not at work
Spirit Island is the new big coop hotness afaik
I prefer co-op board games anyway
Me 2
I'm logging on now
maybe 11 years
here I am again
dropped the game for 12 fucking years
I was a beta tester for MS1's western release
it's really weird
along with ragnarok online and shit
maplestory 1, honestly, was one of the things that invented the idea
I think premium club member ship is boosted xp gain and some other stuff along with a stipend of premium currency
because they give us 1000 premium currency every day and a lot of costs are either 0'd or reduced by up to 95% to aid in testing
I can't get a really good handle on the premium model in the cbt
monetization is driven entirely through selling cosmetics and conviniences
it's a free to play mmo
the beret is a good look
kinda sad R switched away from the beret *to steal my headphones*
probably, I don't know it though
Upon official release it might be quite worth it if we get a sustainable guild going
for a west release, anyway
Right now it's in closed beta
it's on a 3d plane now and you can actually fucking dodge, but it's not the best combat mmo
which was made in like 2003
the actual game is...not tremendously evolved from maplestory 1
You can create clothing, houses, housing interiors, posters, music
It's an interesting social experience because player creation is valued
ü§î
when you buy music sheets the game hands you a literal primer on music theory and how to code their music files
that's me on sax and R on drums

in maplestory
we're in a band
composing music
congrats on your house being #5 on the leaderboard last I checked
eyy it's imutone
Monolith finally getting to work with Nintendo again with xenoblade though
Tri-Ace and Monolith are companies that don't get to do what they want very often
no
the plot was actually decent, the setting was sweet, and the combat was really awesome
It has two titles, both on gamecube
Baten Kaitos
that was fucking great card-based combat
and reminded how I'll never see another entry in the series
dammit I got reminded of one of my top jrpgs
but he's cutting out the "was 1 was 1 is 1" cards
that's short, if anything
Trump Reviews Trump Reviews Trump Reviews
oh it's time for the best hearthstone card review
yay I'm visible
I long for the world where all servers remove all pepes
that's why it has the biggest number
I guess you can climb down a ladder
'climb'
nothing like MS1 was, so far
it's not too bad
right now it's closed beta
as a warning right now I have bad action latency
do you want me to buy any more instruments
ok
ü§î
I am unfairly bitter about not being there
wow there's lots of lag
still want decisive battle sax solo
go work for a day, get kicked out of the band
I've been replaced for so many of these songs
BK3 is what I always secretly hope for in nintendo news though
so it'd be like another star ocean!
and ***Tri-Ace***
I mentioned that the game was made by Monolith...
Kerrik
I think all getting the silky shiny hair does is unlock soundtest or something
no punishment for deciding "I'm done now"
it's a gamecube game
there's no achievements
1 and 2 have 2 of my top 3 jrpg twists in them, too
idk
maybe shampoo is further into the game than I thought
as long as you do it faster than 336 hours
and it doesn't matter how fast you do everything else
but that's only 100%
and then you have a literal two weeks to do everything else
which is really early in the game
the speedrun is a joke because you just have to rush to get that card
there's a card that requires 2 weeks of runtime to transform
yeah
you basically had to work your deck until you had the equivilent of a royal flush
but that was *hard*
If you set things up, you could do attacks that would knock off what was basically a third of the final boss's HP
One really excellent part about the series was that it was a combination of skill and luck revolved rather than stats that really determined how the battles went
~~because most of them were by the same dude, sakuraba~~
though it sounds a lot like other jrpgs of the era
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtMDOIEyu0E music was ace
I don't even know what happened to Tri-Ace
is it good enough to bring tempo warrior back?
it's a good card but idk
it's a kit of tools but you'll never have the one you want when you need it





you cant count on any of them
they're all good, but
randomized
his hero power is 1 out of 5 different ones every turn
it's ok
dont get glued to the hero power
odd mech pally isnt a great idea
there's not always a tribal-type element to use them
gimmicky keywords are introduced into hearthstone all time time just to be gimmicks
dragon you have too much faith in them
it's anti-combo
OH MY GOD THAT'S STRONG
this was revealed today
no
here's something insane to make it worth it
so I've been saying Magnetic is kind of a stupid gimmick that's going to need something insane to make it worth it
once again, annoyed maple drums do not have a highhat
probably not
I wonder if it'll be viable to make mesos by selling weeb music
alice has dragged me into her hell
well done
~~I've logged in like 5 times since he left~~
why live
why tune in
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A BRODE LAUGH DURING THE REVEAL STREAM
OH THIS IS HORRIBLE
OH NO
yay
hearthpwn, they were streamed earlier today
maybe egg
I have no idea if there's a viable cube combo there
cube priest here we come
it's much better in tournaments
and bad people play it
because it's a skilltesting deck
on ladder, yes
oh, sorry
it just summons bigger dudes
no
hahahaha that condition
there are lots of cards better than shudderwock
due to natural aggro advantages
aggro is usually better than control in hearthstone
there's like 12 combo and control decks out there right now
rush is irrelevant
we're in the heaviest control meta hearthstone's ever had right now
someday
druid was a class that needed a panic button fairly often and yogg is exactly that
not because it was actually great
yogg was good because druid had nothing better
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
so splitting souls... I have no idea
warlock is the souls class this expansion
probably thematics
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
the 3/4 omega priest is the only true standout in omega cards so far, though the 12/6 taunt was alright
but no I don't think it's a good card
it's an okay 10 drop because you have 5 other mana to work with
"more" isn't really relevant
both of them are going to be answered or win you the game
it's nothing we haven't seen
it's the same dream as doppel
it's really not much better than doppel
that's not really that much better than doppel
I mean
it's warlock, warlock has no handbuff besides keleseth
it's powerful but doesn't do anything to stop you from dying and a control deck can maybe deal with it
two more
the best card here is demonic project
but no
random legendaries aren't that great

oh woops
priest gets their 3rd really great 3 mana 3/4
so congrats
that and league of explorers
it's one of the best heroic cardbacks
I'm really glad priest got that omega 3 mana 3/4 because everything else they're getting seems shit
because if they undersell it it'll be a nightmare
it's really good for a neutral though and I hope it's a high-level bucket in arena
also this would only get you a 9/9
a 3 mana 15/15 is less relevant on turn 8 but yes
without deck thinning
basically call to arms
this is
it feels a little bit like sludge belcher, just a little weaker to super AoEs
also this probably a really solid card
we are now up to 4 annoy-o-tron cards in hearthstone's history
Same word
Draw a card when you play the rightmost card in your hand
We already know the minion
Also mage has dragons breath and blizzard for midgsme clear
Which is ok but not crazy
This would be a 6 mana two card play to get 2 4mana minions and a 2/1
There's also that 4 mana card revealed yesterday
I wonder if that card makes arcane explosion worth running in an aggro meta
it'd be insane in rogue
but maybe it's not?
this one is probably just bad
Elemental mage, maybe?
counting gohan and bardock and stuff as a half goku
I think we're up to like 7.5 gokus or something
and not cheat with goku black
you can now run a team of goku vs a team of vegeta
I will
okay
if there's another source for Mythra I don't know it
mithril is an entirely fictitious word that is derived from an entirely fictitious language's words for grey and glitter
if it's derived from mithril, it's a stretch
unless it does and I am *uneducated*
mythra doesn't have a very close relationship to light
~~Houmura and Hikari are better names than Pyra and Mythra, fight me~~
oh here's a better look
the gem on the chest of one of the most important characters is a Zohar
also, as a bonus xeno- reference
which means they stand behind you as you use their weapons
as cameo weapons
kosmos and telos are both in xenoblade 2
in her xenoblade 2 form
yes
*Her redesign is so good though*
but yes it's a meme deck
near-minionless priest is fairly possible
including benedictus
you'd have to wait until the other deck was fatigued and any minion that you're running that's not malygos or velen makes this strategy worse
though this seems like a poor gameplan
they can also psychic scream and then copy the deck
there are neutral cards that can do it
yeah
and then holy smite to the face
The only actual use I can see is to try to shuffle a bunch of velens or malygos to your deck
you're essentially skipping your turn
you're spending 9 mana spawning a bunch of 1/1s doing *nothing else*
remember though
woo
most deathrattles quest priest runs aren't that strong
quest priest gives you a bunch of mediocre 1/1s that draw you a card or some other tiny benefit
I don't know
because it's too clunky for anything else
and it needs to be an otk card
it's intentionally too expensive to make otks possible
but nothing worth working your deck
I mean, yeah, there are other cool uses
the only real use of it would be malygos type combos
9 mana
it's a cute card, but
priest seems pretty dead this expansion
like every steam press release it flies under the radar unless you actually follow them closely
that's their beta chat model they talked about a few months back
yeah
2 years too late, but hey
they're trying to compete with discord
did the changes finally move out of beta?
human head size is actually fairly consistant and isn't really scaled with height
you're just used to unrealistically giant anime heads
ü§î
and what a sexy ocarina it was
alice and I have moved onto musical shitposting in maple
I had the game installed on a flash drive and would play in the college library
I'm pretty sure at least one f on my report card is the fault of ss13
Oh my god
after that
would have 3 turns
I would guess that the first player, if they were... somehow still alive
I had no idea and this is one of the stupid little interactions the game gives you no real way to guess correctly
From the Hearthstone Wiki;

If a player plays a second Temporus during the first turn after playing a Temporus, the player will have their second turn from the first Temporus before the second Temporus's turns start.
it's like evangelion except they're also plot relevant
xenosaga fuckin loves obscure religious references
no they totally were
since Xenogear and *especially* saga were like a thousand percent hung up on zoroastrianism
300% buy that
or is that too much
can we add that to kirika's quote database saki

there's a report button
<@!102691114762371072> as you requested, sorry for the awkward framing, there are *more important* things to get in the shot
lot of 11/10s "he is my perfect boyfriend"
not that I'm playing it
you can leave reviews on mothman and for that I think it's the superior mobige
getting 1,000,000 xp per song
xp gain is great though
<@!102691114762371072> remind me to grab one later, I'm in the middle of a music marathon and a screenshot of me at the piano isn't that interesting
it was a real <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436> moment
someone said my maplestory character was adorable and asked permission to draw it
this is a thing I didn't know I needed
oh my god neon garters
successful tribal decks work because the minions are okay enough on their own but compound, not because you need all the puzzle pieces in place to make them workable
if you're charging mana for a tribal tag, you're going to end up with a bad tribe
also tribes shouldn't cost mana
that does damage
it's basically another egg
the 2/2 is buffable and it's great AoE resilience
zoo decks ran it for a while
it's honestly not that shitty a requirement
also maybe mech deathrattle hunter
anyway I like the 6 mana 2/2
but it'll probably be worse than shudderwock to achieve the same purpose
also malygos shaman is back
and then you do not want boomship
I think it'd be a midrange deck
which I'm not convinced you do
if you even put lots of high cost mechs in a dr boom deck
when your hand has a lot of high cost mechs you don't need another high cost card that only does something turn 9
I don't think you'd put it in a dr boom deck
almost enough to be holding 5 cards
that with activated grom is
I have seen people say put charged devilsaurs in and go face
the rush is a bonus but not the point of playing it
honestly boomship is probably okay but belongs in more the the recruit warrior style of play
yeah that's alright
also it's probably bad
there's also this but it doesn't give the 7/7 rush
don't overlook the battlecry because of the fancy hero powers

that's really good!
summons a 7/7 with rush
it dies
you get a 2/2 with rush
anyway it seems really okay in warrior
yeah, good point
oh wait, yes
no
that card does not automatically gain rush
however
and that is not a great card outside of specific metas
it is worth considering we already have a 5 mana 2/2 with a deathrattle that brings an 8/8
anyway I could see it in priest, warrior, or hunter
it's good at both but *not good enough*
it's not tempo enough and it's not value enough
anything else that tries to do the same thing
it will not work better than like
it'll work
like
cube priest seems bad
and I'm not talking about magnetic
this is a bad card as considered in intrinsic value standards like for arena, but there's some sweet synergies in this set for it
oh
ü§î
I own very little because the cost/ reward is so far off for me
Anime merch sits on a shelf
Some of the best hd rumble use
Also golf story was low key amazing
Celeste

Yooo
*Yooooo*
***YOOOOOOO***
and go face with possibly like 24ish damage
no, the best idea I've heard for it was having charged devilsaurs and grom in hand
now you'll just get 1 mana backstabs and preps
no, coin's rotated out
no matter how many you played
the joke is the quest would make them 4/4s

KOSMOS QUESSSST
KOSMOS QUEST
KOSMOS QUEST
‚Äì Final quest pack includes 5 new quests, 3 of them involve a number of Rare Blades, the last one involves KOS-MOS and Shiki (Adenine)
deleting that though since saki's not that far yet
yeah
I just missed having my damn combos
and yeah it's not hard
though I imagine that is mitigated by NG+
there's at least one point in the story where you don't have that chance
except when you don't and it fucks *all your planned blade combos*
though obviously there's a mild reason for it
I feel like the game is light on fire blades
could be fire with the fireworks theme
looks earth elemental but who knows
she's bitball so therefore healer
https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1022320158377832448
no idea what it'll localize to
hibana
(new rare xenoblade 2 blade because they're STILL PUSHING OUT MORE DLC)
the conditional more than balances that out
even with 1 more attack
it needs to come back twice for me to consider it better than cairne
probably not though
they just put in a patch that makes it *really fucking confusing* to understand the rules on what sticks and what doesn't
I honestly have no idea
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it'll resummon because you played a card on it
play this and play 0 mana silence
6 mana wombo combo
I've got it
oh
besides pw:s and maybe divine spirit/inner fire
doesn't run buff cards right now though
priest uh
it's ok
this feels like a dead expansion for priest
what?
this is dumb
it's a good statline for a 2 mana card but a bad statline for a 2drop
it varies strongly by meta
impossible to tell
the importance of healing is always just
yes
ü§î
well, drakengard
to make it feel less like
maybe more assets
yeah
yoko taro has trouble actually executing 'fun' I guess
what an almost-fun game that was
did someone really want to replay that so badly they ported it
isnt this the rhythm game section
...
so it's not like it helps there
control paladin both has enough answers and has no decent way to win the game
it's a bad card but odd paladin might run it
don't think about it too hard
it's a tool and they need tools
maybe
I guess it's good for odd paladin
don't run this, run equality
SUPER EQUALITY
this is not an exaggeration
where you'd play a card and wait 8 seconds for it to resolve
was the release
the thing I remember most about naxx, though
while you developed unremovable minions
5/6 on turn 3
1 mana card that was like
undertaker was insane
2 months of undertaker hunter
naxx was a shitshow
not vanilla
reincarnate shaman was naxx
it was nerfed before pretty much anyone was playing the game
did adrenaline even make it out of alpha
like burst shaman
there was quirky shit in beta and release
zoolock, freeze mage, control warrior, and miracle rogue
it was like
vanilla wasn't that great
I EMOTE AND END MY TURN
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9QD6sxoJxk
ever
it's time to repost the best hearthstone meme that has ever existed
however
purify actually ended up being a good card
but that doesn't count
they printed purify
well
they've moved to a philosophy of silence is bad and nerfed like 3 cards that had it and stopped printing new ones
summon a 4/4 and return the 4/2 to your hand
the dream is anubarak
...but not good enough for wild
playing this into aya isn't the worst though
class cards have a bonus to show up in discover
which means you'll get them a lot
two different class jade cards
but you also get jades
you get sylvanas and shit
I'm trying to decide how viable it'd be in wild
well, rogue/neutral
which mean you're limited to rogue only
there's also the problem that it's discover
I really don't agree
a lot of the time
draw a card
your best deathrattle's going to be like
plan for the worst with this
n'zoth isn't bringing it back
it doesn't have deathrattle
idk, I have no idea what rogue would run it
5 mana 4/2 gain a bad deathrattle and draw a card might not be good enough
it also means you have to run toxic arrow in your deck
*maybe*? the problem is, you have very little tempo, and all the enemy needs to do is deal 2 damage and then they'll have board initiative
you can't ever have more than that 4/2
it kills your own board every turn
control hunter doesn't want it
no
ohhh this is a really good effect but that statline's a little painful
(not actually a good hunter combo)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k7H871NIxo
but it also had a love that crushes like a mace
oh no 1 was absolutely horrid in that
though
yeah, probably
bare and empty stages are kind of a hallmark of the series
though I wish they'd make a new layton that was more like the classics
It's nice to see Level 5 really push themselves
I like the one per expansion idea
they're still printing solid hero cards
pretty sure it's frozen throne
UI is too good
I still think it won't get played until UI rotates though
I take it back, it could have very specific tutor uses
huh
this won't get played until UI rotates out and maybe not then
no but as you level up music you get cooler animations
I think I'm only in one of alice's videos but my character's a passionate bass guitar and sax player
ü§î
duh
run off the edge and wall-kick up
But it's like 20 for x1-4
I'm going in all the way though
If you're on switch you can just get the first half and avoid the bad x games
I got the whole megaman x collection so you get to witness my slow succumb to madness later during the ps2 era
And to think I used to s rank megaman zero levels <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Another game over but I got a heart tank so it wasn't a waste
Lemme try that
Oh I have the spark
X1
The anglerfish submarine that blows and sucks you around over a spike pit
This megaman x subboss is destroying me
good shit
and it requires a board
there's so many more things to do with 5 mana
but it's 5 mana
yes, I'm aware
I could easily see you choosing to never play it
you have to actually play it before tess will use it
getting to play mediocre spells excites you?
really?
getting really tired of the overdone cloning theme
but the kickstarter is uhhhhhhhhhh
and "sort of on or off" is actually useful
qbits are real though
it's because she's nonbinary <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I know why alice is having trouble with this

pretty sure it's like 2 days now
going from 30-40 took like a fucking month
in maplestory when I played
the longer the game runs, the more early xp gain is accelerated
that's natural mmo aging though
there's a lot
Do you know how many unfunny hearthstone meme videos there are
weasel tunneller saw competitive play
I'm not getting the joke here
you have a minion that gains +1/+1 and has a mini baron geddon effect
...?
not sure what deck needs that
turn 8 frost nova
that's *way* too slow
I take it you've never played wild
it's not good
I've only seen one and it's a legendary
I'm waiting for the good magnetics
if that's what it is
it'll be unplayable probably
I mean, that's my guess
so you have to stick it onto something big to make it tronger
magnetic, deal this minion's attack damage as arcane missiles
MECHA CTHUN REVEAL TODAY
~~unless it turn out to not be good~~
we can wait till then
it's going to be a month of salt after release
I'm ready to be done talking about it
are we done talking about it
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
And Token Shaman might run this.
okay enough to be good in arena, not okay enough to be run in constructed... well. *maybe*. Token Shaman's going to be scary.
but you won't need the upside much
you'll run it because it has little downside
but I think it's more fine than good
eh, I guess it's fine
not convinced it's good
ibu is a feeder
you're just jealous of my genius
I'm doubling down on kingdom farts
kingdom farts 2
I read that as

<@!127644949884698624>
I can't remember, is the warcraft tcg discontinued
"HACHIROKU?!"
if they wanted to go next level they'd use voicelines
maybe I should rewatch that show
been a while since I've seen this
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I kind of want to drop megaman X to play more of Elfnein the Robot and Other JRPG Things but I feel that's too mercurial of me
weasel priest was the greatest deck
I think I'm good
whew 12 minutes
~~it's so bad~~
I legit ran a time warp voltron mage
that's pansy shit
fucking doge
because some of them I shoot on sight
this is a false statement
Kriisa covered in gloop <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Kriisa-chan you're perversely attracted to dying memes
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
get floop's goop all over my malf, please
I think this analysis misses some things but I'm not in a frame of mind to dissect it
ü§î
but unlike dirty rat it's not a neutral answer
for 2 mana
due to transforming maly or floop into a random demon
warlock will still hardcounter druid
yeah
"oh, hey, one little thing, malygos is going to hall of fame effective immediately"
during the final reveal stream
what if
*wipes Alice's drool off my screen*
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
it's still hearthstone
thank god, they're still making bad cards
I don't think anyone's winning though
draws do exist
maybe they'd code it as a draw, I don't know
but it's hard to say
I'm guessing it's actually a loss
it says the opponent dies
it doesn't say "you win"
mutual loss
wiping me is about being good
and it still isnt good enough
that doesn't involve them being in fatigue
they already have an instant win combo
it's not even that funny
it's not even a good meme
please let mecha cthun go
but a point
not a good point
yeah that's a point
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
it's enough to keep it from being a t1 strategy
yes
at least magnetic mechs
ok guess mechs will never be a t1 deck
odd rogue (the deck she's playing) revolves around the fact you have upgraded daggers for your hero power
dess_. Shirabe My memes are the true
the eternal void, I guess, I've got nothing
ü§î ü§î ü§î
ü§î
4 mana have your hero portrait teabag the opponent while 7 malygos fill your board
I have the power to delete and I'm not afraid to use it <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
did they fix that
does Blizzard know it's almost fucking 2020?
what a crap system
or you can connect bnet entirely to a different region yeah
if you add from in-game after using the dropdown list you can do it just fine
this might be fucking you up
scrmz are you adding from in-game
I haven't launched in like a month
alice we'll have to wait for this download shenanigans

no
you have 100 friends?
are you dnd
and start from scratch
even so, you'll need to redo the tutorial
just switch the dropdown tab to americas
you don't even need to make an account
ok I'll log on
scrmz has to go through tutorial
that's the part that's shittiest
purchases only affect 1
different collections on each server
yeah
isn't he?
scrmz is EU
uh
*They hold you closer to their heart*
Flatchested girls are beautiful too, shirabe
`I'm not be a melon target`
the dilemma is you're erasing the text but also the text has already *done its job*
I don't know, it *should* work
And it might be an invisible enchantment
the problem is devilsaur's battlecry
it *should* count as an enchantment
90% likely
I think
wait
yes
I feel so bad when I play it <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
the deadgame, or the sequel, which is even more dead? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We're a duet
new player experience is both better and worse than when they launched
just going to warn you
hearthstone sucks ass to get into
Are you in the crafting menu or the normal collections menu
I think so
it's a rare
don't craft sludge belcher
no, it should let you craft a wild card
and select wild
you need to hit the bottom left button
no
get 100 dust
disenchant one card
no, you need to be able to play wild
oh wow, interesting that scrmz can't borrow a wild deck, yeah I guess you're just locked out
though
to gain access to wild
you have to craft a wild card
I don't know, what happens when you reincarnate weasel tunneller or something
I think so, but the fact it doesn't die might disrupt it
I don't know about that, it's the kind of thing that's probably just barely strong enough to get into a control-type deck but isn't strong enough to make giant waves
neat
huh
I'm not going to answer either of those questions
yeah I guess that'd do it
is he back in
I thought arugal got cut
though if you're running specters you're probably not running antonidas
book of specters too
it does fail to hit your hand
antonidas in aggro mage
you know what this means
<@!127644949884698624>
have unlimited mana always
trunk of the world tree
it's a weapon
more tree synergy
what if the final minion is just
*It was a good idea*
tundra rhino's a class card
right
just fill your deck with ultrasaurs, charging devilsaurs, and *oh*
so
yeah
cloning vats or whatever
the new legendary one
but you'll also have a 1/1 tundra rhino
well, without charge
do you think silencing the 1/1s will restore them to 7/7s with charge
the 9 mana priest spell
Alice
....
Lock
Then I realized it affects the board
I was about to say it's shit
There's a usb c port at the bottom of the tablet part you can totally charge it through in handheld
Says in the comments
Oh it was the dock
Unless they mean the usb a ports on the front of the dock?
This is what I do every day
??
It's less scary to balance
They never will
No mech has charge except voltron afaik
A combo to merely set up a strong board state isn't enough
We've had pretty much no direct damage mechs which is what you need to be viable
I haven't seen a mech combo to make that worth it
Worse mechwarper
By the time you're playing buildabeast you don't want to mass draw and you've probably drawn most of them anyway
It's fine if they're not powerful as long as they're durable
Honestly you mostly just need the board to stick until you draw your bloodlusts
If it's only the board it might not get run
Aggro hunters run rexxar because it singlehandedly lets them have a chance at winning a control matchup
Assuming this hits the cards in your hand and deck, anyway
Think of it as a plan b, the same way rexxar is for hunter
It's good for token shaman though
That's like saying "this is green in the same way the sky is"
Not a finisher
Golden monkey is fuel
Which it's not at all and never has been
It's a transition into midlate push
You're probably overestimating this card if you're calling it a finisher
Double bloodlust on 8 is the real finisher
So this is for token shaman
We already got lock's spell anyway
That's blue
No I'm wrong
Card's purple
and don't have charge anymore
yeah the really awesome one that does 2 damage
if only paladin had damaging spells below 4
it got drawn into my hand
especially since that card didn't cost me card advantage
yeah I'd be fine with a card I never played for the entire game if it meant the most insane tempo swing
~~still no win condition~~
insane in control paladin
no that's still good
oh
this card does not provide balanced results
if you don't have a balanced curve in your deck
0 mana malygos and 10 mana moonfire sounds like a good fukken trade to me
it's stronger this way than as draw 2
generally speaking though, any deck faster than you is a threat
eh, I guess it's 50/50
zoolock is also not a good matchup for token shaman
people don't play tryhard decks in legend though
it's not at legend
oh
all that life gain and taunt summoning
and spreading plague isn't the only problem card
honestly I think druid, right now, has enough representation to make it a problem
(X) Doubt
you don't want turns past 5
but if you intend to run that deck
I take it back, token shaman might be okay even with spreading plague
Token shaman is garbage as long as druid has spreading plague though
It's a halfmeasure for when you don't draw bloodlust
but work is its own reward sometimes
it's a lot of work for a door
sometimes they try too hard
OH MY GOD IT'S ADORABLE
OH MY GOD THE TANK

unlike most puzzle games there isn't actually uh

spacechem has a free demo
if you like puzzle games you need to try zachtronics at some point
Have you ever played spacechem or infinifactory

that's correct
yes
that's the chance of both not happening

there was a video edit of this with girls being lewd and that was the source

nintendogs
yeah probably
you mean the franchise as a whole
oh
no they specifically said rathalos was the first
like dracula
stages have bosses
but it could be story
they look nothing alike
it's not in response to something they did, it's an eternal state
If you don't think boos everywhere you go isn't harassing...?
if she's allowed and broken that's the game and tournament's fault
The real problem is booing the players
missed the /s
oh
So?
the bayo players got publically booed and harassed the whole way
no
the fans clearly aren't mature enough to be there
ban smash from evo
~~they're all the same~~
I found it interesting they used her original outfit
ugh k rool
800 tracks
jesus
they're going to reveal simon belmont
firebat playing fuckken wallet warrior like it's 2013
That was added well beyond where I stopped if it's true
It'll move the single block it touches
Unless shit has been added which is possible, pistons are the way in unmodded minecraft
Just slightly space intensive
This doesn't seem hard to solve
Then you delay everything below the repeater with an extra tick or whatever
Or is there tick delay
Can't you just use 2 not gates with torches to make an instant repeater
Use a repeater
What's limiting it
I feel the entire thing that made smash a good idea in the first place was the lack of healthbars
this is straight up HP
that's different
you haven't played it yet
playing a platform fighter just to.... not use platforms
I also think stamina mode is bizarre
is fucking little bitch mode
Turning Stage Hazards, off, on the other hand
should be good for parties
I like the smash gauge thing
I'm still waiting for interesting decks to try
https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-world-on-pc-wont-boot-for-users-with-cpus-that-lack-the-fma3-instructions.60963/
There have been

Problems
Hope it works on your pc
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Idk, boar might be okay
Firebat was successfully memeing with it high legend
It's actually reasonably good
8.8k
That a about how much dust i have right now without dusting extras
100% on board with kibler here
They should axe the set entirely
And, honestly, why would you
You probably don't open classic packs much
Because you dusted it after the nerf
Try mechathun warlock
If control warrior doesn't end up high t2 it'll be solely mechathun's fault
It's nuts
Armor gain, weapon removal, a weapon, can combo it for card draw
Weapons project is bonkers
I think the best card of the set is a warrior card though
So much healing in hs now
Hunter is going to struggle for a while
Assuming you mean using bombs
Mech hunter is solidly jank
Jank
Yeah
Healzoo was barely viable at top levels
Aggro was bad last expansion
Same with every expansion
Right now aggro is really good because everyone's fucking around
Mechathun doesn't qualify, it's the most simple and straightforward combo deck out there
Isn't the amount of legendaries the same in almost every expansion
There were still pity legendaries in gvg but you had to go like 40 deep
Woah cool deck R, I hadn't thought of that synergy
That's how you play hearthstone
Maybe I'll mess with a zerek deck
I feel like there's just no fun ideas this expanation that don't involve mechthun
I'm... okay, in theory about it
it's wish fulfillment the game
4 in-game divorces
I remember grandpoobear being concerned that his wife has gotten like
Especially since you probably are not in an actual hurry to get to 10
It's okay but not great and the deck is actually at the point where it has too much ramp
Honestly I think biology project is also on the chopping block
*only* if you have the auctioneer combo
It just doesn't give you anything useful for playing it
And sure it's playable
The last thing a combo deck needs is more unplayable combo pieces
I don't think the spell is good for a combo deck
Because stallag feugen
Adventures stayed the same with the exception of naxx
There are just fewer neutrals and more class ones now
incremental
oh and graphics upgrades
or is it just roster changes and "manager mode is slightly different"
does the gameplay of madden ever change in a meaningful way
OH I WONDER IF OKAMI FINISHED DOWNLOADING
that's what I go with now
yeah
rip
I no longer self-identify as a 'gamer' due to a desire to not be associated with a lot of other people who do
which is shocking, because gamers do a pretty good job of doing that to themselves
this is... hard
I've never done the third level of Celeste in this order
huh
they let you see psychelocks
mario party but harder to understand
it's like
bad extremes
I wish I could be more excited but I always found risk of rain too slow paced for me except when it was too much happening at once

"I wonder if firebat's started playing meme decks yet"
the best part of the test subject deck is all these videos of people failing the combo
hell yeah
I'm suspecting a 1 mana rotface
was there a rotface
the fact that arugal is glowing means he had to have gotten it in a previous turn
shadowstep is a card
you don't know this is the only turn he played face collector
and Arugal, the mage legendary
random legendary

Parents buy it for kids
You'd be surprised
Yeah
There's literally a bigger market this way
Less people had internet access than you thought
Well shit if it's 5 years ago here's a bigger objection
And it's the wrong economic system to have genuine concern for the consumer
It might be more expensive to print, but they probably get an overall return because a new game is more visible than a dlc patch
Sports games get big ad space and pushed by game stop etc
Efficiency isn't the end goal of capitalism
Being *that dude* who jumps into someone else's conversations to throw an argument down

```The outlook wasn‚Äôt brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:
The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.

A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
They thought, ‚ÄúIf only Casey could but get a whack at that‚Äî
We‚Äôd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.‚Äù```
same reason Hyrule Warriors Deluxe  turned into Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition and Super Smash Brothers SPECIAL turned into Super Smash Brothers Ultimate

it's not like gameplay is the point
just watch it online

the process of cutting a master is something that happens a month or two before release *and there's time to make more shit after that*
I actually don't have a problem with that when it's not on-disc

that's unneeded anyway

the smaller boards used to be alright, but if you're still using 4chan at this point it means you're okay with chumming around with /pol/ users so at this point it's all fucked
/b/ is a beast of its own, but /a/ and /v/ are shitfests
that one is less so
technology
most of 4chan's boards are kind of obvious
4chan's videogames board
otherwise please move on
if someone really wants to have this argument, which I hope they don't, move it to serious discussion
can we not go there
but that's /v/ for you
it's shit, for the record
alright
oh is there a lyric list
I'm off to a bad start because I'm annoyed that I have to watch this to know whether cast should have posted it or not
and it is not a 40 dollar game
I never liked it because the ending pissed me off and they sold it for *40 bucks*
not great
spectrobes was

There's lots of good shit on 3ds
