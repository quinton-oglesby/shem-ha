Again
What matters is I’m here now
Who knows
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
Idk why but I was kicked? Or...I left and didn’t realize?
Hey
*shirabe Kirika lawn mower*
Because it sounds similar
I remember her name a Malarkey
So basically Mallark is Cag but even less likable

<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I expected Maria to die in tsubasa’s arms
Nobody:
Literally noone 
Not a living soul
Symphogear writers: We need a season 1 episode 1 callback

*hey Shirabe wanna go to drug store?*

Fudo, more like Fudoofus!
Oh heck
I have yet to see that so I don’t see an issue
It’s tracing media that isn’t their own that is a problem tho
Ehh, not that big of a deal
In a recent example
Does this mean that Carol will be in XDU?
Fudoofus
Why do I know that
Bikki is left handed
Nah, she couldn’t save herself. She needed a nap
Convenient
Somehow this gauntlet relic looks exactly like senshoujig
In Season one neither miku or Bikki slept on the bottom bunk
Miku is totally a bottom
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
Oh no, Bikki is gonna have to fist miku
Fudo: Ending humanity as the gears can barely hold back
Bikki: 🏡 <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
Big oof
Bikki is under house arrest now
-every custodian in XV
“I can’t die it’s impossible, even if you destroy my body I’ll still come back”
-cell
Bikki is op, literally every catodian is just cell from DBZ without her
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
we already have the title of ep 12 leaked?
~~don’t think yami and yugi kissed but ok~~
Elfnein after: What’s a carol? Is it Christmas? <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
I think
Yep

I’m just waiting for my favorite Maria move to get represented in the anime
Fisting! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Bikki: *activates amalgam* “Germain-Sama?”
St.Germain: 📺 <:Germain:421434126856486912>
Where did St.Germain go
*then....Amalgam X drives*
Imao did season one hint at episode 12?

<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
An AXZ drive?
Ok
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Either that was a sub goof or that’s what Amalgam + X drives are gonna be called
The sub I was watching said EX drive
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Yea
I want to see Genjuro win a fight . Genjuro is stronger than Finè without a gear, why is he treated like fodder
*whoops*
*unlike the ogawa fight*
He was holding back and the gears weren’t tryin to kill him
No
**HE** is the Final Commander
Can we have Genjuro actually win a fight
I just wanna see an OVA where ogawa teaches Tsubasa how to shadowweave
Imao thought that woulda only stayed in XDU
Ogawa’s gang actually being mentioned.
Which one
Or better yet. Genjuro Solos Shenma
*final commander*
I am gonna predict finale. 
1: Free miku 
2.Shenma final battle
3. Xdrive finisher with Miku and Bikki
Maybe
Shirabe was the end of the bloodline tho...Kiri thought she was Finè’s reincarnation from a convenient accident but if she was at one point that would kinda ruin the character arc she had in G
Finè is gone
No one is perfect
She just a little late
She sang her song as she was running.
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
I remember when she did that in G and almost killed herself
It looks so cool
My bias aside
Am I the only one who thinks Kiri’s new Xdrive looks the coolest of the 6...give or take we don’t see a full body shot of bikkis
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
I don’t want to think bout that

Is Fudo dead?
