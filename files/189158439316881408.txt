at least a few days later; i need time to digest G
thanks!  but i will probably watch GX on my own pace
_switches to symphogear-discussion_
oh i did have another reason for coming here
but turns out i really like maria for how expessive she is
seeing the character art i thought i'd end up liking shirabe because she's the cutest
before i watched G my favorite character was tsubasa, fwiw~~, though chris can be surprisingly adorable at times~~ (shh don't tell her this)
meanwhile though... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYvyh3IIdDk
I actually watched the first season a few years back, but finally got around to watching G this past week.  Mainly because it was in the way before I could enjoy the season for which EXTERMINATE serves as a theme tune.
I joined this discord on a whim because ever since finishing watching G for the first time a couple days ago i've been finding myself thinking of Maria too often lol
hello
also, (finally?) watching SAO II while GGO is airing, again unknowingly
things i do: join the symphogear discord unknowingly right before xv comes out, because i finished watching g

yeah i just named the cards whatever i thought of when i looked at them
oh, bang dream

of all the things it could be
the card that i had named "Miku (elegant and horny)" because she looked elegant and had horns on her head turns out to be the one that has the electronic keyboard when it's fully awakened

so why is it 72 kiricoins now rather than 75?

since when did he turn from a pirate shark into an opinion spouter
Jonathan Jones?
oh gosh it's late o'clock and i should not be here
unfortunately, once we got to this state where it was less about the merits of the opinions themselves and more about which opinions could be fought for the hardest, some people figured out they could hijack this to fight for completely obnoxious opinions
and that's why i say the this left-vs-right thinking contributes to it -- it makes it out to be a zero sum game, where if you aren't sufficiently defensive against/aggressive toward the enemy, then you are ceding ground to them which is bad
well, ideological turf war is what the so-called culture war is, basically
i think a number of people feel that the internet is a medium for self-expression, but in the process kinda forget that people who (don't) see that self-expression aren't necessarily the people who they (don't) want to see it
instead, the internet is the land of snippy statements then walking away
unfortunately, the internet is basically a very poor place for this sort of patient engagement to occur
ideally i think that if A person says something that makes B uncomfortable, B should have the right to say that it makes them feel uncomfortable, but B should also have the responsibility to make a reasonable case to A explaining their perspective, and while A should not be presumed guilty of harmful intent when all they did was say something innocently, A also should be open-minded enough to talk to B, with the hopes that both fo them come to an understanding.
obviously, if someone is introducing a topic in such a way that it's meant as flamebait, then no one should be asked to engage with that.
i think the question is where the line should be drawn between not saying something for courtesy and demanding that others be able to approach a topic level-headedly
because if i'm only enforcing "gender doesn't matter" on others, then i'm just being selfish.
then i came to the second realization that if gender doesn't matter, then it shouldn't matter for me to call someone by the gender they identify by even though i don't think they look like/come off as/etc. that gender, either
i'll admit i used to think like that ^
but some opinions are morally bankrupt
no opinions will make you spontaneously combust
pfft
which can be useful, but not always
also to be fair, i will say that people who are "centrists" do tend to pride themselves on dealbrokering
the person saying it could still be a good person
i simply mean that it implies something good while that quality has no actual inherent goodness to it
and by deceptive i don't mean some evil person is trying to pull a fast one on you
though to be fair it is a lot wordier to say "i don't fit your negative stereotype of a politician"
also lol @ anyone running for office saying "i am not a politician"
"i am a centrist", "i am not a politician", "i am an independent" -- all are similarly deceptive
many parliamentary systems have smaller parties which are more ideologically rigid and which group together to form governing coalitions
with multiple subgroups that don't necessarily agree with each other
besides, the US major parties are more like coalitions
[12:05 AM] FizzyFusion: I don't like associating with political parties, but if I had to, I would probably go with Radical Centrist, I just go with whatever works well, whether it's left or right.

The left/right dichotomy is a big load of crap because it pigeonholes people into thinking (1) in terms of a zero-sum tug-of-war between two sides, (2) associates certain positions on issues that have very little to do with each other, and (3) makes it sound like the "center" is somehow magically better
aside from politics, that is
what's wrong?
https://www.mariowiki.com/Jonathan_Jones
i prefer this one
but this is a Very Bad thing.
hmm, i haven't found a source that confirms a motive yet
iirc they have other offices elsewhere that have been unaffected?
re KyoAni
i mean i knew about the first two but that last one is quite a thing
wow @ ^
well you have stuff like rape kits that are designed to collect actual evidence with regards to such events.
Very often, it's not even possible for a lot of people to know the full story.
[8:31 PM] SymphoPOOOOOOOIIIIIII!!!!!!!: That's why looking at the full story is important

And this is why I think everyone on the internet should be more circumspect and hesitant about drawing conclusions about stuff.
even people who are leaving the field, such as for retirement, generally don't have an economic interest in causing drama
because they have an interest in holding down jobs that pay the bills
though i will point out that, people who have careers in a certain field generally have an interest in *not* causing major drama in that field
at least, no one who doesn't have some sort of personal connection to it
the vic thing is actually a great example of this: no one on the internet should be talking about it
so you get a lot of people commenting on sex scandals and other scandals as well, who really don't have any good reason to comment
one problem with a number of these scandals is that there's a bunch of people who feel the need, for a variety of reasons, to react to and form an opinion of a thing ASAP
<@!102691114762371072> i'd consider that to be on the personal level so it's "whatever you feel like with it"
instead you get personal disputes getting subsumed into larger things like cultural tugs-of-war
the problem with using the court of public opinion is that public opinion does not go through a rigorous and systematic process of examining all the evidence and then forming a judgement based on that
though that's different from going on social media and advertising it, i guess
yeah
(excepting cases where only one person is involved of course, e.g. being a fan of someone)
as long as that choice is mutually consensual <@!99695384296701952>
i'm not sure i agree there should be a "social court of judgement"
by which i mean that people take these things really damn seriously
it would be nice if people actually treated these things the way criminal cases are treated in a court of law
<@189146272865845248> basically, civil cases can be decided based on "y'know what, i think it looks about right, reasonably speaking", while criminal cases have to be decided on "are you absolutely holy fracking sure of this"
i think this is a good observation
[8:40 PM] Melua: For what it's worth, the way I or you would be engaging with someone would be a civil idea
while "beyond a shadow of a doubt" is the standard for criminal cases
fwiw i think preponderance of evidence is the standard for civil cases
it should be possible to answer the question "what would I have done had I known nothing about this?"
> [8:36 PM] Melua: C) I would like to decide who ends up with my money
and for that matter, having proof does not equate to "true" either.
I think it's reasonable to ask for proof, but it should also be noted that lack of proof does NOT equate to "false".
that's nothing; i have a high school acquaintance who bragged about burning his holographic charizard
I have taken no position of supporting or "kicking" Vic Mignogna, and i foresee that i will probably continue to take no position, on any practical basis of my spending
frankly speaking, humans are not one-dimensional people; some people can be asswipes in one respect and greats in another
<@!102691114762371072> well, some people might, but i don't think anyone *has* to
[8:51 PM] SymphoPOOOOOOOIIIIIII!!!!!!!: We shouldn't go around assuming every man is a rapist because he's a man and someone said so

we shouldn't, but if Alice Jones says Bob Smith is a rapist, then I'd say it's fair to log that mentally as "According to Alice Jones, Bob Smith is a rapist"

[10:01 PM] solopy567: the effects are varied between person to person
^ this
Far as I know so far, this is a "I can see Russia from my house" line.  Not one that the politician actually said, but one that summarizes the ridiculousness.
(if he did then that's fair game.)
yeah, i don't like how that one twitter user put quotation marks around the line, assuming mccarthy didn't actually say it.
^^ well yeah, but the point being, McCarthy's position of blaming video games for gun violence is wrong, and can be easily refuted by an easy comparison.
if video games cause gun violence, then how come japan doesn't have gun violence?
but it does point out the obvious comparison
i think it comes from a tweet where someone is satirizing the guy's position
though, as i noted, Kevin McCarthy (and Candice Keller and others) are still plenty stupid to blame this on video games
yeah that's what i figured
*holy crap* the NE GOP is salty
August 5th: Nebraska Republican Party responds with this: https://twitter.com/NEGOP/status/1158511017351155713
August 4th: Republican member of Nebraska state legislature posts this: https://twitter.com/SenMcCollister/status/1158178237899522048
oh wow
just that i'm trying to verify whether he is extra stupid
for the record, kevin mccarthy is plenty stupid to try to blame video games
the quote seems to come from this tweet? https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1158021233541287936
it just seems to be a static image
because if he did i'm gonna have a field day with it
i'm trying to figure out whether he actually said exactly this
can someone find me a video clip of Kevin McCarthy saying "There are no mass shootings in Japan because there are no video games there."?
also lol centrism.  centrism is a political ideology formed from declaring that both sides are bad, which necessitates thinking that these two "sides" are actually on some sort of meaningful one-dimensional axis (which they actually aren't, and groups of people actually switch sides over time)
[2:32 PM] (⚧♀) 🎀💖🌸Rakhi09: Im picturing someone unironically using both of these as genuine arguments as debate against socialism and capitalism

if someone does this they should be called out for their ridiculous oversimplifications
that analogy is a ridiculous simplification and can be altered to make fun of any economic system, so therefore it is essentially meaningless
FYI my point was what Melua said
i go away for lunch and people talk about what i said lol
so now you can change your joke on the fly to insult either socialism or capitalism, as you like!
you can adjust the dollar amounts to your liking, and then put the one that's the punchline at the end
oh, best of all?
[12:47 PM] ninryu: I remember that tweet of someone teaching their child about "socialism" by paying 10$ for cleaning the bathroom and giving a big percentage of it to the brother who didn't clean.

the next time someone tries using something this as an example of socialism, point out the following:

"socialism": Mom gives Timmy $10 for cleaning the bathroom then takes $5 of that and gives it to Bobby.
"capitalism": Bobby tells Mom he cleaned the bathroom and gets $10 when all Bobby did was to offer $5 to Timmy and pester Timmy into doing the cleaning.
> I hate hotels

that_creepy_bowsers_laugh.wav
which is why i don't like the idea of "centrism", because it makes it sound like there's something sacred about being somewhere in the "middle" or having some sort of "balance" between the so-called left and right sides.
[3:58 PM] FizzyFusion: Personally I think this whole left and right bullcrap is stupid
[3:58 PM] FizzyFusion: Politics are too complex to be accurately represented on some stupid chart.

I agree with this completely.

The Church of Scientology is as evil as the meme suggests it is.

Just a lot less funny.

TL;DR the Scientologists are basically in a massive conspiracy to buy out everything in Clearwater, FL, gradually pushing out anyone who isn't one of them, until they basically run the entire place.  And they are entirely willing to ruin the city in order to do this, by doing stuff like leaving vacant properties everywhere.

well unless you live in a country that handles its tax filing more effectively than US
of course it's boring
it's tax season mk. 2
i don't know of an automatic filling thing aside from those tax prep software
For those of you in the US: If any of y'all are doing your own taxes, and are still working on it (since the deadline *is* coming up), here's a reminder that if you don't make that much money you can probably file your taxes for free.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xQQkzWhMOc
If you don't want to bother with the youtube video (which is mostly talking about how scammy tax prep software companies are), https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free
That said, knowing how scammy those companies are is still pretty useful info.

FYI: https://www.anime-planet.com/forum/threads/large-new-batch-of-character-tags-non-binary-gender-elemental-powers-waiters-and-more.334512/
Good to know they do; thank you for helping me out.
I could get that info on the fan wiki, but I was submitting character tag information to Anime Planet and they tend to prefer a more authoritative source.  I know they have these powers since I've seen the show, but I was hoping that their official character bios mention these.
Thanks!

i wonder if it might have been related to me taking a trip to las vegas around the same time haha
nor, for that matter, bunny girls lol
well, for me it's because neither the "contrived games" nor the "isekai" parts of the premise are things i'm known to particularly like
i don't know why i enjoyed it
i didn't expect to like Problem Children
mondaiji-tachi ekusutorimuri rongu neimu
yes
whereas Mondaiji is specifically about that, or at least the anime is
Dog Days isn't *about* games per se, it's just that they use nonlethal gladiatorial combat as a sport and a tool of foreign policy the way the Europeans used to use actualy-lethal war
but they seem rather different
between the games and the isekai premise
I can see how someone might relate Dog Days to Mondaiji
ah
what is the purpose of this channel?
