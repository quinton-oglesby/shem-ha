I need to tag
Ok
Someone running green Carol?
Sanic, can you add me as well? I need xd mats
My ign is takafuji
Ok I called out a green Carol
Called another green Carol
Sanic, did you add me?
Thanks for helping me out
<@259169633389510656>
Removed 13 people
Sure
Thanks a lot
I need 14 more big miracles
9 more to go
I got 5 big miracles from the last run
Me too lol
Tossing out a Carol
Chris isn't that bad
If you got cp please hit my green Carol sanic
Nice
I need 7 more Giga miracle
Too bad it wasn't 16000 large crystals lol

Got some large crystals
Thanks
XD Chris is good for stacking def down on hard hexa
I might
XD Chris is quite tempting I throw 1 roll at it
Sorry I was checking out of a hotel, I should change my name
I'm f2p and I'm rolling
They do seem to be releasing a bunch of XD gears at once
Alright followed
You have slots open?
Yeah
Got some small crystals
If 2ppl hit it together the damage will stack after they both finish
Oh didn't know
Thanks
Need to level up more to get more friend slots
Opened 2
Ok lemme open up some
That was at pork, not hdk, hdk is full
the first UL is the most difficult
Then farming for them should be easier
1 a day would put that at 6 days later
Need 6 more XD Giga
No need to rush though
I need to prefarm extras
Nice
Once the first UL is done at least it gets easier
Lol
Need some sanic
I'm hurting on the blue Giga

I think it'll take me about a week
At least it's a giga

Dead
Tapped it for participation

This guy is trying hard
Looking for blue
Ignite biki is a good PvE unit
Long CDs, low heal
XD Serena was also a pitiful unit at launch
I think only topped by XD Serena
I think it was the devs way to apologize to the people that rolled for her
She was originally the most pitiful XD v1 unit
After multiple buffs and fixes
XD biki definitely one of the best v1 XD units
10 more runs to go
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
How many Giga are you missing mousy
Now for blue hell
Yes done with Carol

And one around 500k
I see a pub green Carol around 1 mil
Anyone still running green carols Coordinating to kill?
I dunno
Requesting Small red carol
Ok I'm unpausing
Any ignite carol
Ok
Your the best sanic
Thanks
I need some blue
Thanks sanic I'm out
Red small Carol
Then get on around that time
Search his name
Sanic does like daily runs for the ppl that need help
Means they trying to make money
Not for this anyways
They haven't in JP for 3 years
I'll believe ban when I see it
Friendly neighborhood sanic
Ok I'm out thanks
I'm out after Carols
Almost a Full train
Joining
Perfect
Actually I got to go to bed
Yup would've taken 2 weeks without sanic
Sanic trains would count as most damage
If you do most damage lots you tend to get more higher tier
If you do crap damage you tend to get the lower tier
I'll just join for green carols and yellow
Melua don't you have MLB XD jii
Ah you first
I can always use more Giga miracle
Me too
This isn't hacking though
Yeah
I'd like yellow sometime though
Sure
Ok 7
React when you press pause
We at 5
Press pause when you get in until 7 reacts
Should be friends only
Good start
Add ahegao

nice
i'm throwing another 10 cp at it
449 819 247
also anyone else that wants to hit
thanks
<@!251037892221075456>

it's È∑πÂØåÂ£´ËåÑÂ≠ê
i'm going to start a yellow

thanks i followed
ignite jii is gonna be a beast this cc
now i gotta grind more p carol mats in prep for ignite basa as well as d carol mats for xd chris and jii but i can take my time
i finished my ignite jii
thanks
dead
thanks a lot
gonna finish it off
if it's still alive in 7 mins i'll throw a hit
or actually i only got 9 cp you can go ahead and finish though thanks a lot
i'll also throw a hit in since i got 10 cp
ok
but i just can't whittle down micha, need a good pink
the blindness i can kinda ignore so once micha is gone i can do some damage like 200k-300k per 10cp
pretty pitiful, called it ou if anyone wants to hit it, i can't do anything to it until micha dissaspears


time for promised land streak
oh what's going on
as if on cue

<@!263392442345193472> you got any spots?
you should get a lot of those in the hard raids
no gigas
but why would you want normal though
oh really?
that definitely has a micha
i can only hit carols with no micha in them
that was really close
p carol
i think if i got ignite basa i would be able to 10cp it
pretty good
]
guess i'll help him out
poor guy
>.>
halp

i'm gonna 10 cp it now
called another one, this time at green life so you guys can do more damage to it

finisehd it off
maybe i need to hit it again then üòê
but it was already linked yesterday
oh yeah i came on to link that article
i like fantasy/isekai stuff, the progression in goblin slayer isn't really enough for me
never watched the anime
goblin slayer kinda started out interesting in the manga but i kinda got bored of it
oh so that's what happened to wfc, i watch shows just to enjoy the story if i'm too lazy to read the ln/manga
but i should be talking about anime here
what's ur current xdu team
oh yeah boule iw as gonna ask you
for older90's era shows i like escaflowne, nadesico, cowboy bebop
anyways slayers wasn't that great
so hey boule is here
sao season 1 was nice to watch
where as after season 1 it's not longer about sword art online
throughout the whoel series
to aru is still about a magical index
>.>
but that game is gone
when ti's clearly not sword art online anymore
i don't get why they are still calling it sword art online
I don't like asuna much either
i also didn't like SAO after they destroyed asuna's character in the 2nd part of SAO where they went to the fairy land game
and gun gale was just something else entirely
so that elf game part of SAO was not very good
once they left SAO it wasn't interesting anymore
until they left SAO
SAO was interesting actually to me
trying to think of an example.. but i think i haven't seen most shows in the last 1-2 years
i dunno many recent anime that i think are good
i'm thinking of picking up youjo senki
LNs i like overlord
>.>
<a:worryStick:468927619048669184>
unless you like characters from it
no
>.>
yeah but least the game still has a presence in s1
>.>
it's about the AI
but it's not even about a game anymore ruby
all that is mentioned is kirito or new AI being brought up so they can use them as soldiers in the real world or whatever it is they are doing
sword art online is no longer mentioned at all
at least are still mentioned and stuff every so often
you guys are going to the extreme about to aru and one piece
(even fans of 2d idols)
because only idol fans can relate to it
i don't think everyone would like oshibudo tho
oshibudo
that was good
that was newer
i watched budokan
oh wait yes
oh hanabi?
they're not that old >.>
last thing i watched that i liked was either hunter x hunter or saiki kusuo
it's been a while since i ihaven't seent much recent stuff
me? i need to think
just something you think is good
either
what was the last good anime you've seen hanabi
>.>
mulan budget was 200million and brought in 30 million <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
>.>
it was profitable
hey.. dragonball evolution budget was apparently 30 million and they brought in 50 million
i thought that was the best live action
what about dragonball evolution
>.>
these other channels are too strict
time to head back to xdu >.>
>.>
trump wants to hurt china
doesn't matter if something sells or not
>.>
watch trump ban it from north america and blame it on biden
and also fortnite
>.>
i thought league is being banned
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
>.>
i think the best thing about oshibudo is the lack of lewding unless my memory is playing tricks on me
>.>
i wouldn't say good but it wasn't as bad as mulan or dragon ball evolution
main arc, achiga arc, movie, and i think there was this and nationals arc i think
there were 4 saki live actions
yeah there was
>.>
i like how cocoa pinged ruby
>.> bbl
anyways i gotta go before grocery store closes
felt different compared to the first half of the first season when they were stuck in the game
i'm assuming they put them in there so it sells better >.>
4. isi find lewding/sexual scenes in SAO unnecessary and distracting, i don't recall that being in other game related anime that are not comedy based such as overlord, .hack, log horizon, death march (this wasn't a very good show but yeah)
ah i see, I don't follow his works very closely >.>
Accelworld actually is much more interesting than SAO in this regard
I find it interesting when they show new mechanics and what not of the non SAO related ones than the SAO related ones
as a game concept the different world yggdrasil from overlord, or elder tales from log horizon, or the world and the actual real world in .hack was much more interesting as a world than SAO, then the real world, then fairy then GGO, then human sim 2000
3. the world the author creates isn't interesting, usually when character aimiability or connection fails, world creation would save the show, SAO's game initially was ok, wasn't extremely interesting but it was interesting enough. once they left that game I wasn't very interested in the fairy world creation they created, then the FPS world they created, then the human though simulator 2000 world they created
2. similar to 1 I don't like any of the characters (currently) I used to like asuna in the arc while they're still in the game but after they all left the game and went to the second fairy elf game i didn't like her anymore because they completely changed her character, i forgot what it was that i liked about her
i don't know if it's a writing thing or a directing thing or a script thing, just can connect with any of them
1. I can't connect with any of the characters
then i came to the conclusion there's a few things that make me not like the series
and on the drive home i was thinking about it
ok so someone was asking exactly why i disliked sao
I mostly like old anime cuz I'm an ojisan
Waiting for dinner
Back
i also like escaflowne and martian successor nadesico
>.>
yeah not everyone gets to be clever in that show
yeah
>.>
and no that's not log horizon
>.>
no i like logh
all i said was i didn't like sao >.>
>.>
in general i like older anime
i only "egg" on sao cuz some ppl seem to think it's the greatest show in the world >.>
the first half of s1 was the only decent part of it
not a fan of sao
<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
pretty sure key worked on charlotte dunno if it was with others
dunno
key stuff seems depressing
>.>
no i watched charlotte
>.>
and apparently the key series i watched was the worst one
kanon is key right?
oh interestingly i've watched only 1 key series
rahxephon >.>
ff unlimited.. noir >.>
maybe guu
i think like initial D >.>
2002 i dun even remember what was airing
i'm not a boomer i'm a millenial >.>
>.>
agape
but it had a good song
UFO princess wasn't very good
<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
it's probably my favorite comedy anime >.>
wouldn't take you long to finish
3 seasons of 12 eps
go check out gag manga biyori, their eps are like 5 mins long iirc
but not the same series
well same word
no
talking about genre we like
oh if you like comedy you should watch gag manga biyori
it's a classic
>.>
did you watch azumanga ?
drama
comedy/scifi/fantasy
what do you normally watch anyways?
>.>
or most of you anyways
since you guys are all much younger than me i'm not sure which shows you've seen >.>
>.>
there are smart ppl on both sides in logh but they are few in comparison to the dumb
>.>
>.>
i might actually read clannad
key got good songs tho >.>
>.>
and i think only 1 got translated
and they're both bishoujo games
in my life
i've only read through 2 vns >.>
I avoid key >.>
<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
i didn't finish it
>.>
and little busters started off with a sad little guy that was narcoleptic or something
the anime end was not happy for charlotte
>.>
it's millhi
played a lot of korean games though
i read a korean manhwa before that's about it
and their stuff is depressing
>.>
yeah they do the story
>.>
all i know is their stuff seems depressing
question
cocoa what was that quest you had
i've never actually played ace attourney is that what you do?
>.>
basically becoming rngod
google it cocoa >.>
>.>
i can't savescum my arena battles into better rng
well XDU is iron man mode all the time
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
then i don't buy the game to play it
i save scum in civilization >.>
lets see how i do >.>
i'm only gonna play through once
dun spoil i haven't played the vn yet >.>
<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
>.>
is it like creamy mami?
i still need to finish railgun t
oh good hope the families are coping
Ah so the insurance want enough to restart the studio
But donations don't bring back dead staff
They got no fire insurance?
Why donations
I don't watch subs
my favorite is escaflowne
I feel old >.>
what's everyone's favorite isekai serieshere?
>.>
i had the same issue with GX for biki and Basa for XV
i like to see progress >.>
pun not intended with subaru's coming back to life looping powers
it's like i'm watching the same thing over and over
I don't like shows where the character development goes in circles >.>
i dun think i can stomach another 13 eps of it >.> gonna stop watching...
and there's gonna be a second cour to finish what i assume is the arc
seems like it ended suggesting it's 2 cour
just finished watching re zero season 2 >.> man that was the worst series i've seen in a long time
>.>
and at night time
the race is like maybe 6 mins right? how can they overheat so quick
>.>
i don't remember it very well but didn't he blame his brakes?
and he lost
still big advantage >.>
r32 1430kg 276 hp 260 lb of torque, ok so he had an advantage on power , dunno how the tires are like on the r32 but it still had awd
oh the 1st season wasn't r34?
and trueno didn't get an engine swap until takumi blew it up
when they were battling
i thought they were both driving stock cars >.>
power to weight ratio is about twice of trueno, plus it's AWD, fatter tires, better brakes >.>
lets see... trueno is about 1000 kg, 112 hp, 97 lb/ft torque  vs R34 which is 1560kg , 316hp, 289 lb/ft torque and awd
maybe the other ppl just really didn't know how to drive
I just assumed it was >.>
i like my driving shows unrealistic like initial D
i think i got 5 or so in
>.>
i got bored of capeta in a few episodes
i think i rather have that than vegetable kirito >.>
i mean if it doesn't get better not much of a point for me >.>
alright thanks
so i've seen sao 1 2 3 alicization1, alicization2, if i didn't enjoy any of these except the first half of sao 1, is alicization 3 worth watching or should i just leave this series unfinished?
i dunno when peak anime was/is there are good older series and well there seems to be less good ones lately
last game had way too many gundam songs in it >.>
then we can run the room on the list and it will be more fair
then my wife is going to put shows she watched
<:worryhehelollmao:512615990199320577>
i bet i won't remember any of the songs
still updating it
i spent like 2 hrs yesterday
>.>
i've been trying to update my anime list thing for the anime music quiz
>.>
part 2
it's as bad as sword art online alicization
waste of time
>.>
dun bother
>.>
too bad rezero wasn't as good
steins gate looped well
no matter how op it was during release
>.>
won't give 1 cent to them
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
which is why i didn't roll the gacha
i dislike snk for other reasons tho
>.>
so it didn't loop there
i only watched the first half of season 1
shingeki no kyojin
ah
what's snk
>.>
looping shows are generally poorly done >.>
https://myanimelist.net/anime/33341/Time_Travel_Shoujo__Mari_Waka_to_8-nin_no_Kagakusha-tachi this show didn't loop hanabi
there are time travel shows that don't loop
nah, just stuff that loops
i think it all went downhill after almight fought that one guy
>.>
then dropped the manga
mha i think i watched 8 eps went to read the manga
cocoa my trusty spellcheck
>.>
harem
i spelled it wrong
i wouldn't say it's very well hidden that it's a harlem show >.>
the director had to apologize for endless 8
the concept of rezero is flawed to me to begin with though, it's like endless 8 the anime. >.>
i only watched it cuz i saw ppl say it was good
i couldn't stand it
oh man rezero s2 part 1 was really bad
ok
cuz i dropped the other one first ep
>.>
dun even know what that is, is that like a sequel for id:0?
dun even knokw if they are or not
if they are from the last year
i didn't watch any of those
raihousha was a decent arc in ln
>.>
though i'm going to watch the new season for mahouka and expecting it to be decent
that was produced in the last year
i don't recall watching a single good show in the last year >.>
only things i have watched have been kinda bad lately
tho i haven't watched much in the last few seasons
yeah ls are rs in japanese cuz they dont' have ls
>.>
R = red, noble
>.>
oh the pizza box
she's a pizza?
too bad gx sucked as a season
>.>
carol is much more interesting than her counterpart tho
isn't rem carol >.>
didn't even know it existed
i think i watched 1 ep of cross ange
jumpin around a lot too >.>
or the way he talks...
canops' voice sounds really jarring to me >.>
just starting watching mahouka 2
anyways it's a lot less fun than before
now they put a big ass delay
also autos were spammable multi screen back then
then capped
then hrt didn't like that and nerfed multiplier
well everyone was sidewinder at one point in time back then
more debuff more damage
the sidewinder skill
well the first strong nuke they killed was kill streak
i don't remember her nuke before was she strong?
nukes are really meh nowadays even with their buffs
when do they bring back ability damage
yeah it was
i like ability damage and really don't like that
now it looks like it's moving to ougi
at first it was auto attack ta and chasers
i don't like how the kmr and hrt before is guiding the damage in this game
well it was fun to use him
ah  didn't know it wasn't capped
the hp atk move?
old sarasa? no
i think you can maybe max out at 40m per hit depending on buffs debuffs etc
i mean that's his point
they should've just kept him uncapped
yeah
i would imagine so
so i get 100% cap increase
so yeah that means i need 2 staves with abil cap up
ah
when i saw 15 on the site
because i asked about ougi damage and someone told me it went to 30
ah
the abil cap up is 50% does it double to 100%?
yeah
yeah so I was  gonna get the abil cap up to play with dsaru
ah
what's her cap on ougi?
wow, but it's probalby a pain to set up
oh she does more than silva?
i rolled one and  left her at lv 1
ah too bad
is she worth using?
her normal ver
hey how is ismir or whatever her name was now with the ougi buff update
like that wind hair stab potato
those poor characters with only atk skills
it's been like 3 years of  auto  and now it's auto/ougi
yeah it'd be nice but i think i won't be playing by then
unless the meta has changed drastically
plus the auto attackers need buffs first anyways
i should record and compare but i've never done it, it does feel a lot faster tho
which is like 1 person TAing
but the skills you can kinda press afer about 1 second ish
the autos' have longer lag tho like you need to wait for the 3rd person to finish taing then ou can auto again
compared to ougi and auto
which is all short
so the animation won't matter as much as the cd between skill use
well for the racing, they'd do multi window
i thought the skills are usually boring and fast animations
to lower the cooldowns
well no since you still have to auto attack and that factors into the equation
and skill delay is lower than auto or ougi delays
considering each skill is 1 button
i don't think they need to hit like 10m on each skill
i think they just need to make everyone uncapped
1 shotting is fun, and efficient for grinding
i'm probably gonna go full casual really soon in gb
they use it cuz it looks funny
i mean look at everyone that uses fierce maiden in pvp
yeah but 1 shotting thigns is fun
it did but i'm upset  how they don't let skill damage be a viable dps racing strategy
yeah it was in the first year of release
though the ougi is a step up from the multiattack stuff
through mobage
i just play on chrome
but ppl complaining about that now and there are rules and requirements and a point system
i liked it before where you can just do whatever
at least i have a earth team and pool unlike last gw..
2.5 day 1
3.5 day 4-5
3 day 2-3
i need 2.5 day
hope it doesn't take too long
dang gotta grind today..
does round 1 start today?
since i lvled her to 100 already i don't need to keep her in the lineup, everyone in the line up needs lvling
cuz i haven't even leveled them to 80
i gotta keep them on my team though
oh that's pretty good
i should try her but i'm busy with halle lvling and yugu leveling
or mahira
oh i don't have earth DLF
from the update?
is she not garbage anymore?
for this gw i'm using people i've been meaning to lvl
rip ismir
that's not too much more
poor zeph
the other primal pools are pretty good too except wind
i think it's just magna water is not very good rather than primal water being really good
easier to maintain
well i like more hp for double varuna cuz for the frontwater
i run double varuna
but probably don't need the 3rd durandal
maybe 1 more durandal
i wanna get 1 more finbul and 1 more murgleis
i'm still working on water slowly but thsi is my pool http://puu.sh/xfh0w/b7f4e3aa5d.jpg
oh yeah
oh
i'm gonna 5* him first but not because of what he does
was he that good?
yea
cuz of murgleis
well water is pretty TA heavy already from pool
too bad can't be extended
ah
so is end game water like uno diantha sochie and wrestler?
how long are her buffs?
oh nice
dang
does she do TA and chaser too?
lol
all iknokw is she does tension adn that's all i need to know i think
ismir the forgotten
i think i might use sochie cuz chaser
http://puu.sh/xfgur/b0db8f29fb.jpg
i actually dunno what diantha skill set is other than tension
4
he's next to go if anything
altairs pretty iffy on my team frontline
default water http://puu.sh/xfgfV/003ca47cc6.jpg
i have to fit her into my team somehow
nice
starlegend
i got the idols!
https://puu.sh/xeXfV/060159c4a4.png <@182564626620350464>
well christmas will have one for sure
gonna take a while...
should have 2 sup tickets before new years i think
anyways 4 more mlb means i'm missing at least 2 gisla itself,  after that 12 bars/gislas
probably get a free bar during christmas
depends on how frequent we will be getting the surprise tickets
i was saving bars for murgleis but i might just start spending them on gisla
yeah looks like a double elemental summon grid, really balanced
hades/kirin
this is gonna be the meme dsaru team http://puu.sh/xfpIQ/9b8caedd31.jpg
and 1 ultima rod with abi dam cap up
i need 4 more mlb gisla
and ran some numbers
i rethought it out
or grab 1 cerb gun
might have to rethink this
oh whoops i need hound dog
http://puu.sh/xfiFj/b918bc3da0.jpg
hey extika this is my plan for my dsaru team
ah
oh i thoguht agents of mayhem was the new one
ah so the new saints row was more of 4?
was kinda really really weird
i didn't like 4 that much
but i liked the older saints row more than the newer stuff
i like saints row
alright done for the minimum for today
good luck
yeah earth magna was really easy and i don't wanna work on earth any more so i hope i never roll titan
so lazy with earth
though i dun think i  wanna grind more than these 5 ygg swrods lol
i'll ask around more
i think some sort of ougi meme team
and i think octo
they were using lyria as one of the characters
i saw 1 person do 16m in turn 1 on training robot
i wonder what that pool is
must've been my guild then
maybe you were the one that told me
ah i heard there was a double ygg meme pool
thankfully
haven't rolled one yet since they doubled the rates but i think they'll appear more frequently
well not so much now since they double the rates
which is the hardest part
well you gotta get teh primal first
now i gotta start over
my dark pool was pretty much done
in that free 10 rolls for 7 day campaign i roleld a hades
maybe rosetta and lecia weaps will fix it
yea
ah
wow even at 150?
i didn't take a look yet
is it? how so? stats?
<@182564626620350464>  xeno sag spear, was thinking it'd be funny if it was a gun
based on what my guild is saying i don't think i'll need to check it
i'm just gonna stumble my way through until i die
ah
i  haven't tried xeno sag yet but i heard it doesn't attack lol
think so you can do a lot more now
ah
i dunno what skorwa does so skill damage only i'd go gaiwan  lecia diantha swap szoi
though if i go heneru i should just go korwa since it's gonna be a long battle
to potentially max it
no i can double cast tension w/ kirin
actually diantha swap zoi probably
i'd run lecia heneru/gawain zoi swapdiantha
8.64m
1.8 x 2 x 2 x 1.2
a lot less with only 100 tho
well even if 2nd skill doesn't stack lecia and kirin brings it to 100%
i thought it was 50 on the wiki
still not good enough for dps but nice to play around with
it'd be 1.8m x 2.55 x 2 = 9m
so if 2nd skill stacks if it's the same it'd be great for me
first skill is just nice to have
that 's the skill  i need
regardless of proficiency
but 2nd skill applies to whole team
i mean for jeeta
then ionly need 1 maybe
dang
ah so you need 2 different first skills and 2 different 2nd ones
oh the 2nd skill?
hound dog is roughly 600k x 3-4
so 155% cap up on skill damage
then lecia is 30% and if i use kirin  friend that's 25%
2 ultima weapon is 100% up
i was calculating
and chaffrelease is 2x damage to everything already
i mean if i get heracles then i'd be running hound dog
yeah
you just need to have both weap proficiencies
i'd imagine first skill stacks too
it would hurt normal damage tho
the skill multipliers are really high already i think
but having 2 would be 100% cap up
i don't have it yet so i can't confirm
i think it does the 2nd passive
trying to pick between fire, wind and dark for  heracles
yeah i was thinking 6 guns seraph, 2 ultima and  possibly 1 whale weap
i guess it can be placeholder
not even sure about 1 cuz i was thinking of using 2 ultimat weaps
i wouldn't be able to fit it probably
i'm going for backwater
so i'm closer to completion in agnis
no agnis requires less fingers
actually i think i'mat the same lvl of completion hades and agnis pool
if i got agnis
i can ramp up the fire pool in a short amount of time too
but desire sensor has been functioning for over 2 yrs
i really want agnis
my fire pool is pretty turd though
pinya^
only 5% more than unknown axe
didn't feel worth getting another one
i've only gotten 1 xeno per element so far
i hate grinding lol this  is the best xeno event yet
just poking at it when i have downtime and i got one already
or very rng
wow this spear is dropping like candy
nice
grani is memeable now?
ah
as much damage as you can do?
what's the cap for chain burst now?
nice it's high
wind gw next i better finish up my seraph weap
ah
what's the ougi cap now? 2m?
nice
no
man my fire pool sure sucks..
maybe both
though could be nuking
cuz lyria doesn't attack
i'm guessing ougi team
for team
i  see ppl in my guild use lyria gandalf and sarasa
earth does a lot of damage now
i used water against ubaha and just stumbled my way to 5% and got wiped
oh
ah so water and light
i haven't tried hl yet but i heard its hard
normal one
the normal one or HL?
just a wall of hp
oh i tried a ubaha yesterday it didn't do much until 5%
what's the sword do?
that's about it tho
maybe the harp
the weaps aren't that good imo
then stone it
just do a train
kirin's not hard
lemme know if you get a varuna/kirin and need another varuna/kirin friend
you double titan?
no need to refresh for stuff
you should build a good friend list
i needmore varuna friends for double varuna
changed it to kirin, varuna, tezcat, kirin, angelbaby, hades, grani/bunny
my helper summons are: nezha, varuna, tezcat, nezha, angelbaby, hades, kirin/bunny
i got 5 friend slots left
hey do you have kirin or varuna?
4 more 120 to go
yeah i got a drop on first maniac so that make it really easy
just need 15 more horseshoes
but i'm almost done
i did a very little bit
<@182564626620350464>  you finished your spear?
you play cinderella girls?
<@184465748431863812>
what is pinya from anyways? I only know it from cinderella girls
i didn't notice it
hm maybe i skipped it
ah
which trigger was that?
pretty funny
just tried hell 100 and sag attacked 2 times, the triggers make it not attack
yeah lol
ah
and it depends on the skill used
i never saw numbers tho
but flat out it's lower
except when summer lunar buffs her success rate w/ skill 2
i thought the normal one is higher
low success rate?
but still  gonna make backwater for my fireteam
oh too bad
2 resets right?
oh dang really?
then kirin and send him back to the front and heal and do another 4-5 cannons
do my other nukes
then send him to the back
i think i can just shoot it off 4-5 times
then i can play around with barowa cannon lol
max^
Have hades
Dark I would've been done but now I hades
Then the host realized it's not dead yet and potted
Anyways I had to take it down from 40 to 10 by myself
Now only 50
And 25 percent
I thought there used to be a 10 percent
Only 50 trigger
Thankfully seemed like they nerfed nezha
Everyone died at 40 percent ish
I had to carry with my turd fire pool
So many leechers
I was actually in a nezha a fewhrs back
Since Shiva friends are so good
Oh well the pool gets me through gw
Been like this for over 2 years lol
I determined to do finger but I'm not gonna proceed further until I get agni
So I'll work on water and dark
My Fire not worth fixing without agni
Once I finish seraph bow I'll pretty much be done with my wind pool
Yeah and I'm not gonna do the dark guild wars
im gonna be a rebel and not make a light pool lol
and by now i don't feel like working on it anymore lol
i didn't get a ton of light char until recently
yea me too
chars too
so i didn't have much light stuff
didn't roll a lucifer back then anyways
light
i think i avoided like cuz i think they dont' do much damage
i dunno why but i just dun like light very much
light is the element i never worked on lol
ah yea if you got nothing else to skill
my fire pool is messed up so i didn't bother lvling it
the 10% normal may add a lot or not much depending on your pool
yeah but 20% is there regardless of skill lvl
i guess if you finished your pool/grid and got no other way of improving it
well
no real pt lvling it up unless u using primal imo
yea
no i'm missing earth as well but we just had earth gw so i don't really need it
i need to do my seraph bow
http://puu.sh/xjNz8/3adfdbd4ae.jpg
where as kirin can be used everywhere
and the harp has niche use i think so it's not absolutely necessary
the cap increase is not modifiable by summon
i dun think bow is worth it imo
is sword an unknown multiplier?
ah
what game
Ah
Quick grind
Prometheus is easy to kill to
Yup
Yup
Yeah but there are lots of heals in fire
Lol
Though I still will
So you don't need to run enmity
Agni got Prometheus now
So you're good
Titan grid I think is all grindable
Lol
And 1 finbul
After that need another murg
Water need xeno cocu
So water and dark
the goal is to merchandise as much as possible
there's a lot of bad shows nowadays
it was so bad it was funnyh
you know which terrible anime i liked? qualidea code
Seems like the event boss is trying to hurt my daughteru
Damni didn't wanna lv her...
Rena is 5 star now?
Quezelcotl anubis murg and yuel
I roll 88 times
Also got murg as a bonus
88 rolls
Even if it sets me back from a spark
Gotta roll for my daughter's seiyuu
