What is america if not relentless hatred of minorities and foreigners
It's because we got to hate brown people, duh
Y'ain't allowed to stay home for any reason
That's just the American standard
Where I live to change your gender legally all you need is a doctor's note
What's gender self ID
Wait hold on UK and UK adjacent isn't much better covid wise
Thanks Kenneth Copeland
This place fuckin sucks
I'm also American, lol
Also this is literally hilarious to me omg
Also what happens when you have privatized healthcare
Especially since we have no mask mandates right now <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
I mean, there's still a chance it could happen <:kae_thinking:316782471309950987>
It was honestly kinda amazing how poorly it was handled and all of America didn't die
Out of anyone
Like, the least
They did
Super to blame
Yeah, America is like
The Antifa BLM critical Race socialists
Have readopted cold war rhetoric
Not really, the conservatives, at least on America
A lot of counties did take the aesthetics of socialism to trick leftists and liberals into voting for more authoritarian policies
That's fair
That's a weird way to spell US intervention
What's a Roosh
Did Vaush not encourage their viewers the canvas the previous two elections <:kae_thinking:316782471309950987>
It's too late, I'm already a vaushite
two people
yooooooooooo
im people
trueing
sometimes ya just don't be likin the sex
also it's not really any phobic to be uncomfortable with sex to begin with
Political Sociology Streamer
Respect all good faith identities
I take the vaushian approach
(tromies)
Feel bad for the trans homies
You literally get a note that says "they identify as girl" and now you're legally a woman
Gamergate is really what spawned anti-sjw culture that still exists on the right to some degree today
They removed her vagina bones !!!!
As someone who is a part of gamer game yeah it was really fucking bad
Yes
I was more so making the point that the ideas were trying to appeal to male gamers
^
Gamer gate was a right-wing that targeted straight white male gamers, in the groom them into believing reactionary views typically based around how women were inferior complaining sjws that shouldn't be in the games industry. There are many channels that basically peddled messages saying not all women do is complain and they're trying to ruin your hobby and get rid of video games entirely. The spark of this was two women who criticized the video games industry for some problematic tropes and also some misogynistic work behavior in this sent Gamers into a fucking frenzy.
Anyway tldr we need to take the gamer vote back from the right
Oh yeah also I went to a conservative white school, where they absolutely taught you stuff like black people were inferior, and every kid were saying slurs all the time, good ol American education system.
Oh yeah, I was absolutely radicalized by gamergate in the past when I was a child, and then I was brought into the alt right by the various grooming tactics (My experience is pretty much identical to innuendo studios how to radicalize a normie video).

I spent years being horrible in many aspects but obviously, my positions have changed radically seeing as I'm now as physically left as you can be.

You could absolutely look at my texts from 4 or 5 years ago and see some bad stuff, but to say I'm an identical person to the things I believe 5 years ago when I am literally on the opposite end of the spectrum is wild. I'd like to believe that people can improve and I think people should be encouraged to move over, we shouldn't be excluding people from having problematic views we should be doing our best to educate them on the correct views.
I mean, yeah
I mean obviously but the point was more so that, painting someone as some form of transphobe for one thing they said that maybe was bad, is extremely disingenuous, especially when they're a trans advocate
also Twitter people seem to be unable to understand the difference between someone saying a transphobic thing one time to being an active member of the KKK or something like that
> twitter was a mistake

Linsey Ellis was Right
I mean just as like a brief example, looking at the by lesbian discourse for example you have people disavowing others as being reactionaries for not hating people of certain sexualities and it's really weird that there's a bizarre amount of animosity when it comes to agreeing/disagreeing on progressive issues
I do think there's a bit unfortunate amount of morally lucky people who happen to be raised in an area where good views were taught, and instead want to treat being progressive is a social club and kick out anyone who doesn't hold their exact viewpoints
Because for the most part you were groomed into reactionary views as a child and they want to hold you culpable for things that happened when you were 16 when you're 29
Like people who say once the right winger always a right winger really rub me the wrong way
Yeah I hate it fake lefties who believe that no one can change and improve from previous reactionary views
As if like 80% of trans people don't start out transphobic
Like I don't care if someone was transphobic 5 years ago if they're cool now
Omg this so bad
At that point it feels really bad faith,

Because the critique is never "they had a bad take this time" but "they're a reactionary chaser that is going to have sex with my dad"
Like, I feel like saying, for example, "Blank is a transphobe" and then you see 75 videos of them defending trans people relentlessly
Idk, I just feel like a lot of Vaushtroversy is generally overblown and out of context, and after being a regular viewer for well over a year now I really don't see all the transphobia or grifting people accuse of
~~And then they followed me in Twitter, which is the importantest part~~
Oh yeah, there was even a moment I went through a "playing VR chat to get into political debates phase" and I successfully made some friends and got to educate them on stuff like transphobia and economic policy :)
I can't imagine they wouldn't <:kae_thinking:316782471309950987>
To be fair, sometimes you absolutely need to bloodsport on a TER or Alty
I mean I personally find the videos educational to some degree and has helped me bring my family leftward
I simply have not seen a destiny debate because I know destiny is evil
??
There's multiple rooshes
Dang, this Roosh sounds like a pretty bad person
Icey
I meant more so in what context
Wait, you got called a tanky for what?
I can link the video they talk about it if you want
That master post
OH
Or maybe it's the anti vaushites to take satire seriously
The funniest part about enough flash spam is I think it actually became a Vaush meme subreddit when it got overrun by  vaushites
Yeah, the creepy DMs is the one thing I won't defend
If you want to be serious I can always say some controversial extreme topic
Hm?
Vaush Good Vaush Good
Whenever I'm feeling ugly I post a selfie and then like five people be like oh my God you're so cute ||let me breed you||
Twitter is basically the only method I used to feel good about myself,
Huh????
That was meant to be a smile not a wink
My account is 9 years old ;)
I like Twitter people call me cute on there
I'm the coolest
It all comes full circle
Yeah I left those spaces because of Vaush <:saladSunglasses:603090752267878410>
So literally the only political idea I inherited for my parents, was that trans sex workers are icky and gross
Lowkey fuck my parents though, but they never discussed politics with me other than the fact that they were registered Independence, and the fact that my dad was a chaser and constantly told me stories about his interactions with trans women
Yeah basically, you tell men to hate women, then it makes it easier to tell them to hate black people and that's how you form the alt right pipeline
I'm pretty sure innuendo studios has a good video series on gamergate
I have a lot of experience with radicalizing gamers
Gamers are prime to be radicalized, so many shit games are coming out now we can tell them it's a product of capitalism
This is why we need to take the gamer vote back from the right
I want to say one thing that really informed my opinion on the issue is that are doing this a lot of the accounts criticizing them were marked as red by shinigami eyes
I mean sometimes they are also just trans Nazis
But that's literally true though
Is Contrapoints like Shaun, then?
Sometimes I feel like we watched different videos
Then again also just defend anything contour points does because they're a MILF icon
God it's been years hasn't it
Like I disagree with some things contrapoints did in, what was the one with the debate between Tabby and not Tabby
Actually I think I'm more important skill, is that sometimes people will say things you disagree with politically but that doesn't immediately invalidate them as a political actor
I don't know I haven't watched envy yet
Personally I still think counterpoints drama is hyperinflated
Yeah, I'm BGLTA+

I'm the L, for loser <:saladSunglasses:541828152398184458>
It's it's true, I'm parasocially attractedv
Bwitish wit uwu
Bwit
Like I said I have a low iq
Oh, sorry
There is no way destiny is a liberal I have seen some of their opinions
And a Rittenhouse defender
Other than that they're massively transphobic
I still don't know who destiny is
Or John Doyle
If you want to know how platforming works go watch Jesse Lee Peterson or Joe Rogan
That's not how platforming works
Is not a big deal, I do not care what anyone says, voicing a line is not platforming someone's ideas
I do not think contrapoints is problematic or has done wrong
Yeah but I'm an idiot with a low IQ so I need people to tell me what to think
Felt, it took a lot till like finally stopped paying attention to Sean because they ended up being fucking
They debated start on like 3 years ago I think
I thought Sargon was like not
Sargon Tank?
Because tankies do absolutely hate Bosch
It's very sad
The Chris Chan thing is a whole travesty really, getting stalked for years and years, being lied to for the sake of content and nothing else
Yeah but I can't critical think
Which really makes the situation a lot more complicated and honestly I think there's no correct answer, at least not an answer my tiny brain can handle
Yeah
Just wish they would utilize outrage like the right does
Yet for the most part, democrats won't even talk about things that are real
And get votes
Right wingers will just literally make things up and lie
I was mires thinkimg about how
Also, I did not imply that progressives shouldn't run on these platforms
And healing the divide
I hear about bipartisanship mostly :/
Literally never seen anyone of note use it as a talking point
It sucks the democrats are too civil to ever call out republicans for anything, even literal election interference with a foreign country
~~Just kidding I'm extremely enbyphobic but only because they're better than me at video games~~
I was  CW ||attempted sually assaulted by a non binary person|| but I'm not out here hating enbies
Pretty lame excuse
Not to be hyper woke scoldy but please remember to put a space between trans and woman
Wait I have 3 IQ that's what you were saying
To be fair Ann Rand books have bad philosy in them as.
I'm pretty sure the books contradict her race at some point
Crazy how family guy played a big part in normalizing a slur
I mean, sometimes outdated language could be considered a slur because of the language
Personally if someone called me an invert I would punch them, so like there's your answer
Idk about a slur, but the blurb looks like it's extremely heteronormative and binary, and also does reference another slur so like
Lame
Fairly outdated and
Reading the history it does seem like
I've never heard this term before <:kae_thinking:316782471309950987>
Allegedly Asperger's is autism
Going to be a woke scold again, there's a space between trans and woman
But you can find evil people
Not necessarily Rowling
I feel like sometimes there are just evil people tho
<:flusheddd:549321541612208128>
I don't have the emotional capacity to hate
I don't have pronouns
Tbf
Have TERs ever shown to be logical
Oh yeah I should clarify, this is because TERs use the tactic of removing the space to say that trans women are separate than cis women because of why else would there not be a space
I don't have autism and I don't have a brain anyway, this is unfair
Source?  ||/J||
It's all wrong
Movies and TV are how most people learn about disabilities, and unfortunately
Sha?
Which 99% of people don't
Because in order to have a slur for DID, you would have to know what it's called and any basic information
Just an attitude
There's not really a term
I guess it's a matter of luck
||sperg is still really common. People still say "sperging out" for freak outs||
Of course I don't understand, I'm a brainlet <:smoothbrain:632021019930001408>
Autism *
Convert your Asperger's to Austin
But I do know a lot places will just
I think that's just because no one has heard of it
Most kids don't even get puberty blockers until like 12 or 13 anyway
If you're lucky 😔
<:saladSunglasses:541828152398184458>
What if I said 4
Entire thing is an extremely dishonest campaign by a vindictive father who's upset they got cut our for abusing a child
A lot of right-wing information websites will say that the mother brainwashed the child when really she was completely ignorant and had to talk with a doctor to try and learn anything about trans people
The mother was not liberal and knew nothing of the child being trans, it was more so she had to learn what trans people were after the child had basically expressed wanting to be a girl at school instead
Oh yeah social workers at the school basically interviewed the child individually without either the parents knowing or having the chance to coach and their interviews were extremely consistent with wanting to transition and their gender identity when their dad wasn't coaching them immediately beforehand
Trueing ng
Right wing media acts like they got SRS at 4 years old
This
However their dad did abusive stuff like forcibly give them a haircut, throw away all their clothes that they chose, and Coached them on what to say to a social worker
Basically from what I remember, the child expressed wanting to socially transition at school and go by a different name, as well as doing things like where girls clothes and use the name Luna
A lot of kids tend to internalize their gender around three or four at the very least to start to feel inkling about it
Also I apologize, I'm trying to find the recap video that explains this situation better but I don't remember who made it and I can only find a socialism.done left video I haven't seen
Because the lack of spacing is a right-wing disinformation tactic
Than the spacing
That's a little different
I missed a g in judge
They weren't on puberty blockers
It's a typo, you don't have to make a big deal about it
That's not Grammar
To try and get the case overturned
The dad literally abused them and appealed to right wing media after a Jude determined them to be abusive
Weren't even on puberty blockers yet
First of all, they're 8, not 3
That's crazy
Wait, y'all doing a transphobia in chat
Oh, I was referring to my not hrt meds
It doesn't actively block you from proceeding
Door won't work

There are like, extremely rare cases of people getting like hormones and SRS at like 15 but that's like a rich people thing

Routines...
Hahahahahahhahaha
I got them post surgery and asthma medsn
I feel the struggle
I was just expressing
It can always get worse
That's not true
Idk, framing coming out with suicide tends to set the tone for the piece
<:upvote:400120813111738378>
Platforming generally means it has wider support though
^
I'm not sure I agree with that, as there's definitely a broader TER culture there, and a lot more prominent GC groups, as opposed to just vanilla anti trans group
Incidentally. I live in one of them trans safe heavens so my real life exposure is going to disproportionately small to others
I do think it's increased a lot since the time of my story, especially now that the right wing runs daily trans hit pieces
Idk, I'd have to ask a friend about it. They're trying to become a TER researcher
Although as with everything it is slowly trickling into the US
Just thought the specific rhetoric TERs use is kind of exclusive to the UK
This isn't to say that transphobia doesn't exist a fuck tone in other places
Which means that TER radicalization is waaay more likely to happen in the UK, because they're platformed constantly
From my understanding, a lot of major news outlets just blatantly allow anti-trans rhetoric to be posted with no filter
TER ideology is like, mostly a UK thing
It's not, but
So probably one of them online TERs before GC got banned
Oh yeah, the crazy thing is they weren't even Bri'ish
A big part was pointing out what you did from the textbook, and how you felt your writings were
Basically you were graded on how much you improved over the course of the class, and how much you engage with the lessons
If I remembered more about the class I could tell you
Uhhhhh
That it was to spite me and my wife
So it was fairly obvious
This was also after I wrote a poem about being in a relationship with a trans person
And then wrote a whole bunch of a stuff that was just about reproduction with TER rhetoric
"ADULT HUMAN FEMALE"
They even did a whole poem about what it means to be a woman, and the first line was
They were a TER
No no no
I no longer identify as NB tho
I was identifying at NB at the time, and introduced myself with my pronouns as "she, and they if I'm feeling spicy"
Only on Tuesdays
Incidentally, in my creative writing class I had a TER who literally wrote TER poetry at me 🥰
Trans Exclusionary Reactionary
Although TERs have successfully stolen a dictionary definition to the point it had to be changed, so who knows
I'm not sure to what degrees TERs can claim the Venus symbol because the usage is generally broad across the world and TER groups really only infest one country
This is no longer the relevant article but I'm sorry for the confusion with my only on Tuesdays comment @ Matt it was automatic
The general population being more in favor of trans rights doesn't negate that TER rhetoric is largely UK in origin,

You could also use the same argument for the US
^
in public housing?
plus parking lots are a giant waste of land and resources, that could be going towards other resources
which ultimately causes tons of issue, one of them being public transport and also the pollution of cars
Suburbs are a drain on the economy and the largest factor behind car culture
ideally yes
Which is why we need to abolish the suburb
I'm part of the 60% of the nation that lives in poverty
No idea what Disney world is

Never heard of a train before
which was costing me like 300 dollars a month
the only way to get to work was uber
I was forced to buy a car because
yeah, like
9000 this year on my own, so I tainted the well
I've already spent like

2000 in the wrong direction
ooops. I was off by uh
United States
it was 9 or 7
iirc a car costs the average person ~9000 a year to maintain
Cars are also a big ecomic burden on workers in this country
so I cross them when walking my cat sometimes
I live on train tracks
I mean
and they just get to like, mark things up because it's the only one
not affordable
except it was like
there was _one_ store where I lived
Well, like I said
like a normal person
and not length
you can tell how bad america is because we measure distances in time
oh yeah
There coulda been, but they all got shut down cuz big capitalism
where I live, in the city, it's still like 20 minutes because there's no more stores here 😔
my childhood house*
is like, 20 monites
that isn't bougie
The nearest place to get groceries from my house
American Culture is being racist, hating the poors, and guzzlin hot dogs yee yee
oh well
mmmm, don't know what that is either
I have no idea what the reference is
and sell them to rich white folks
just to build those exact neighborhoods
They've torn down a whole lot of it
and now that I'm like 23
our area had a lot of woods and forest
When I was like a 5
like the general vibe
no no
THATS LITERALLY WHERE I GREW UP
LMAO
Crazy that Russia is just larger than the moon
Public transport would never work on the moon /j
after all, good policy goes in stages
immediately demonilish eveything instantly
Also you don't have to like
Also this is just talking economic and living wise, I haven't even mentioned how suburbs lead to the death of culture and alienation of the use]
A big problem with suburbs is that as the suburbs grow, things become less walkable, buisiness and cities have to accomodate more cars, causing things to spread even further and getting even worse
I mean, I think we have the same point
Wait hold on I still don't know what a train is ||j||
Eh
Can't motorcycle in the snow
I live in new york
SO THERE WOULD BE NO WAY HOME
BUSES STOP AT 6 PM
AND
Which is absurd
2 hours to get a 10 minute drive
And public transport wasn't an option because it woulda taken
buying a car literally saved me money
It's because covid killed all the people who sided with bush, if the war didn't already
Clarification: not talking about only politicians here
I mean, yeah, it just sucks that twitter openly prefers being a right wing platform and only does a very mild amount of bans despite the heinous acts some people do and say
Wish it was the former, tbh
MTG for basically the same reasons
Actively encouraging violence, the big lie, massive misinformation campaign, covid denialism, all of which violates the rules
Trueing @ Melu
Finally
It's okay, you're not a mini brain

That joke is like, 15 years old tho

The writers just really like the number 4
Except CRWBY which is 5
Ruby likes to abbreviate things into four letters
Fandom
Sorry I have mobile fingers
It's impossible to be neutral on something unless you're uninformed or willfully ignorant
Also, being a part of "both sides" isn't really valid, there's always going to be some lean or bias
This is perhaps too complicated for me to understand <:sweetsigh:662058167881957406>
Icey icey
What was the decision?
I simply only look at r/FNKI
I thought the point was that it was cringy to create a character just so you can self insert date them
Especially from someone who wasn't participating otherwise
Yeah I find it kind of weird that two people immediately dismiss that video is bad without even explaining why
That does seem extremely consistent
But also the quality of writing of RWBY doesn't have much baring on the original point of discussion
I mean, yeah
I mean. The hbomber video goes really in depth with it
Plus Monty wasn't involved with seasons 3 through 5 being not alive and all
They basically only wrote the action scenes
~~RWBY is just evidence we need to take the gamer vote back from the right~~
Yeah, faunus sucks because it was for the most part written by two white guys with no sociological background
Is cuddling a small hint
Not to say you can't have lefty criticism of queer characters, like, I definitely have a criticism of may
I mean, there is still some anti sjw notions with the inclusion of more queer characters and what not <:sweetsigh:662058167881957406>
I mean, I'm moreso speaking from my own experience and previous community I teractions since I was a part of it years ago
Especially after a celebrity called their fandom out for racism
With the introduction of RWBY and other shows, the company has gradually tried to move away from gamer bros
Also, yeah, I guess I should mention that a lot of RWBY critics are sometimes the terminally online anti sjw types, because the original website RWBY comes from originally had those type of membersb
RWBY is at least okay-
Das one senty x-x
.
Was that not explicit in 6
I thought we did
I'm thankful to have a low IQ I just watched it cuz cute girls
I don't know what that means
I also I don't think copying someone's style is really a criticism you can levee when that's literally how social media is designed
Trueing, if blake and yang don't kiss next season it's a failed show
Trueing
That's the problematic aspect
I'm just saying dismissing a video without watching it
I watched a double speed to be fair
As a ruby fan I was able to watch the 4-Hour video and not get angry
I'm a big Ruby Super Fan but I still levee me some criticisms of it myself
I mean you can be a fan of something and criticize that at the time
But it may not change your identity
Sometimes funny words feel better than others
Pronouns don't always correlate to gender and vice versa
Not really
This was my Senior year of college, I basically hopped on campus computers as much as possible just to suffer slightly less of boredom
It's like feminism but not optically murdered
Not necessarily gender itself
Gender Abolition is more of the destruction of gender roles and rules
As you know. I'm fucking stupgv
At all smart enough to actually explain what it is
I'm not like
That's not what gender aboliiob is
That's not at all what I mean
I mean, Gender Abolition
And whatnut
Beyond they and I
I prefer abolitionism and really hate using pronouns
The objective sense but like actually
I meant in the uh
Nah, I don't use pronouns
Personally I feel like the best option is to play have one pronouns
I wish I could be Binary but like just Binary and nothing else
Trueing
They have a thing against human rights, usually
And language tends to reinforce the emotions and things you can experience
English doesn't have gendered nouns as much, but it's still full of gender culture
But at some point lately I just started really fucking up and I don't know why
Where I would just only use they
And that kinda lasted I to most of my life
So I didn't know how/when you use she/he
I didn't understand what gender was
When I was a child
I try to avoid gender pronouns unless specifically told they hate they
Felt this
Yeah. Only I have a monopoly on being that dumb
lol owned
Once someone is in Q territory that's just kinda it
QAnon is the final conspiracy theory, and absorbs everything into
As an adult who doesn't remember 9/11 I can only see the statement as trueing, the US invited terrorism as an excuse to launch a military campaign

It's very good
Anyway, yeah, Medaka Box good
Ohhhh
