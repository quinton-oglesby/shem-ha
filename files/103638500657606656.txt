<@!291510486837624832> can you make some space for me?
i just hit that
oh sweet
filter?
<:KirikaCry:671948299179130885>
f
i need just one more 4* blue shirabe and 4 more green shirabes to have all mlb shirabes(i think)
i solo'd tech before the maint
Hitting every red carol in sight is paying off
rip
oh
it's dead i think
that's accelerate's right?
rip that dude
ha
it just paralyzed me to death
Oh wait
found gridlock's raid at 3.8k hp left
nice
i guess at that point, raids will be soloable again in under 5 mins
Amaranthea
üëè
what mats does dr jii need for 70?
you mean 3.0
that requires someone to update it
for like 5 turns
<@!157710301779722240> you don't have any space for followers
M I R A C L E S
don't forget the movie
positive feedback loops
having a 5* UL goes a long way for top 3

i just need 20k gold
oh i'm close
yeah

wrong tag
whoops
<@!180486147821142017>  <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Ack
rip
i had 20 extra 3* shirabes(not counting 6 per element)
i fed my extra copies to ignite and dr jii
That makes three out of five UL shirabes
<@!226853436979806208> you're full <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
the answer is always save
that's because there isn't a good burn healer for the raid
although gold may require some units of your own
my tech jii can do tactics 2, and both gold/exp
i have space now if you need a follow
the only things going away are the limited-time missions and presents in the mail
i don't see anything about the MA1 increase ever ending
just the limited-time missions?
what's going away exactly?
that's for the presents in the mail, no?
ignite jii doesn't do much damage since she's aoe
and tech units don't exist
Poor guy
5cp is double damage modifier and 10cp is triple
the first option(either 1 for normal or 3 for hard) is 1x damage multiplier
and genocide
because genocide
like pvp matching
because raid matching is busted
at 70
can burnbasa live?
still no burn clear/healer that can tank body
click the difficulty button top right
people will clear space when they raid, if you ask
yeah, channel is inactive around this time
otherwise, just have to ask for help here
only if you can kill it in a reasonable amount of cp
ahhh, can't wait until i hit 15k
oh
z2?
