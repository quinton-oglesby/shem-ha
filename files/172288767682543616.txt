Yeah that one, and Arael
looks sorta like the space and bomb angels, i can never remember any of their names except Ramiel, Lilith, Adam and the last one who escaped me now
reminds me of one of the angels from EVA

Thanks all
I need some for reasons
anyone here got some good HibiMiku gifs?
<:MikuPeeku:448276741308547115> so you can enjoy them enjoying each other?
<:BikkiPeeki:448276816164159489> i cannot describe how adorable these two are
Thanks!
Awesome! Do you happen to also have any of them in attack poses?
alright, ill try and remember kerrik, thanks
Thats fine i think. No gaurantees how good it will be just a bit of fun
Does anyone have any good pixel arts of the girls in their gears? I have a project i was going to work on. Just a simple beat em up game
<a:ReinaPat:422037686753427460>
I would classify it as harem easily
easily outnumbered by the named characters who are though
about 3-5 named characters not throwing themselves at him
yes
like at least 3 girls and maybe 1 guy wanna get in the mc's pants
it is a harem anime
most of the time
a little cliche but in a good way
its pretty good
<:MikuPeeku:448276741308547115>
<:SaikawaHappy:293997481266511872>
fair enough
the only one i have on hand

<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
yay! thank you!
<@284390402210136064> oh my gosh that is so adorable, is there more or was that it?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
But the map woth the base jump is pretty hard to top imho
Agree
I miss BF3 assault maps. Especially damavand peak
You and me both
Tbh I think Chris may be the most likely to be straight of all the girls
young bikki? <:BikkiSalute:449139465781510144>
oh my goodness, i need that ssj in my life wow
its definitely worth a watch/read

rip
animelab was better üò¶
not that crunchy is much better
but yeah, it sucks that its only available on hidive where I am, as much as I am all for breaking crunchryoll's stranglehold on anime here, hidive's app is kinda trash
https://tenor.com/view/tensei-shitara-ken-deshita-reincarnated-as-a-sword-cat-bob-cat-girl-gif-27175846
yeah, not to mention some of the enemies she fights aren't pulling their punches
Fran is super cute and adorable, and Teacher is like a parent in it, its absolutely adorable but also brutal in its depiction of violence
https://tenor.com/view/tensei-shitara-ken-deshita-reincarnated-as-a-sword-cat-bob-cat-girl-gif-27175846
has anyone managed to make a gif of the shooting star scene yet where they change colors?
thanks!
