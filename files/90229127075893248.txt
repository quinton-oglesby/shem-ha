whens bot
I rolled XD miku first roll on the event for edgebikki
not that anything I'd add would be more than speculation
I think I should update my words from symphogear paste
credit people and shiet
drawings*
err
for art anyway
meaning, anyone making content should post it there but not other people's content
this includes things like fanart, doujin works, fanfic, etc
mostly creation of
I meant fan content in general
especially if it is also about creating fan content
fan content discussion channel would be good either way
I would suggest keeping it separate from other discussion at the very least
suicide hotline for symphogi
and wholesome
I recommend cuddling because it is comfy
thank
I suggest giving me a hug

thanks for resetting my expectations meta mahn
my hope for this season is slightly higher
I didnt think kaneko would actually foreshadow using such a small parody cameo
interesting catch about that book regarding XV
Jesus is a custodian plant that was in charge of guiding humanity into domestication as well as tricking them into a false afterlife, hosted on the moon's technology that then recycles their soul for energy to keep the moon's systems running and having the excess energy sent back to their star system.
good to see some serious speculation here
good idea
yes destroy the moon and ruin the earth's habitats and kill many people and things in the process
remember when cag's VA shifted octaves?
not even JUST the main cast
I'm just assuming he was in his late 20s to early 30s
I dont even know how old he was when WWII happened
or 120s
he's at least in his 130s
thats because Fudou has lots of pull with the Japanese Gov't
10/10 returns to 10/10
GX I mean
she's referring to a line she spoke last season
not the robe
about her
that was just a thing carol said
no
uhhh
ok
"It's not what I want it to be because of japanese fans"
but ok
that isnt the reason at all
she just doesnt have enough power to give herself an adult form
I have no idea what you're referring to
sup
as much as crack-kun would have you beleive
I am not a head-system
that's an entire group of people
also please dont call me sgg
or MGR:R
I would call their style specific to them though
I never understood this
why do you want warriors instead of a platinum game
or maybe less
or year
her body is a couple years old
5 billion years old
valk's spoilers channel is a bit of a mess right now, thank you for being cool fellas
every time
and then there they are
I never thought I'd say this but whenever I come into the reddit discord I never expect high quality discussion and observations like this.
oh that
post it
yes
thank
sad
yes this episode was very shitty with the CR tl
he does
the amount of time is irrelevant to the phrase itself
long gone means they're fucking dead
ðŸ¤”
>it's f/sn in chibi bots
reminder that shemha also gets the collective faith power of humanity that believes in the abrahamic god
sucks that pure innocent creatures and tsubasa fans get most of the KARMA
mhmm
yep
vampy is holding a pure and innocent creature in her arms that gets CHEST'd
I find the scenario ironic though
after a few frames of her falling/flying elsewhere
theres just lots of gore
watch the frames
she didnt explode
in some stories wolfmen have higher regen than vampires
or later anyway
how much you wanna bet they regen instantly
shemha just lazers the pure puppy to death and the vampire
but everything is present to figure out what it is
or in any keywords
phonic gain was never really explained in the show
and allows the relics to activate and the symphogear to work
phonic gain isnt really magic on its own, it's the feelings being conveyed through their will that breaks the curse down
it is my understanding that phonic gain is actually a measurement for how much of the curse you're reaching through while singing, which is to say a measure of the power stored within the individual to cause a change with their feelings.
such as the tower of stone that could reach the heavens
though not just that was feared by the gods, the mutual beliefs when unifying also gave things supernatural qualities
unification of goals is still a problem even without a language barrier
the tower of babel story is more a story of the gods fearing man's ability to unify
and keep in mind
it would cause quite a lot of chaos especially in major cities
so imagine if everyone suddenly could hear eachother thinking aloud
most people think out loud
you know in mind reading and telepathy related practices there is something called the private and public mind
if the curse gets turned off chaos would occur first and foremost
not at all
I wouldnt say that's what would happen from turning off the curse
yeah
though it would be strange at the same time
I think they may go for that
yes I see that
which is why he apologizes to Fine
even if it was of detriment to humanity
but after enki activated the curses of the moon I now think it was to seal shemha there specifically
initially I had thought the custodians designated many of their named higher ups as God to be worshipped to gather faith energy from humanity to be transferred directly to them at their home system, and the moon used the souls of the dead, lured by a false set of afterlives designed after each religion of the world to power the moon's systems
become shakey
my theories for the custodian system for why earth is the way it is have been sorta
as for shemha and enki
the idea of the being
or rather
it still refers to the same being
mmm true
yes
no
so
all the names of god are considered as belonging to one being
so christian god as well
so she is abrahamic
shemha is a hidden name of god in judaism
it goes in order from that, to who she is, and then to who shemha is in the body of
but the fact she was also cleared of original sin
and not just because of who bikki is
and I'm not just saying that because of who's body they're using
the only person in the entire setting that CAN reason with her is hibiki
quite the opposite in fact
not at all
I wouldnt say that
ohohoho
such as with carol's song making everyone go xdrive
that being said, others songs will also affect your phonic gain
of course, if your song reaches/moves others it may benefit you despite the people listening not singing
<@!99695384296701952> yes it would considering an individual human's power only reaches so far
CR must be stopped
at any part of the season
not only that but they never had a choice in anything they did
are you retarded
they died sarificing themselves for the future of all of earth
they died lmao
not the FE one
I meant in actual usage by ullr
yes
just play wild arms 1 and 2 to understand what airgetlam is in the context of symphogear
as for its power, I don't know what it did
the name isnt real but the bow is
Ullr's bow was never named so he just yoinked it from FE
it isnt a mistake
yes
it's a meme
oh nvm
I JUST HEARD MISTAKE AND SYMPHOGEAR IN THE SAME SENTENENCE
I JUST HEAR SOMEONE SAY SOME DUMB SHIT?
well I'm outta here
sad!
>inb4 I'm blocked by KA and he cant read my posts
also
unless it happened way differently, since I havent read it
I think kanade's XDU event covers that
as for basa dying
I don't think she knew kanade would sacrifice herself and end up destroying gungnir
that too
though it was just 10sec to one episode
I feel like they got enough mobagebucks to add some seconds like they did to one of the other seasons (GX I think?)
the only thing that needed a few minutes was the ending
I mean it was pretty much not rushed at all
the converter worked at least
so it should be ok, probably
their clothes came back
anyways gnight
yeah...
n-not like I wanted to discuss geah or anything
d-did anyone tell KA to check my messages
whomst cudd
/x/ is the best shitposting board
why would I read that
but the only sources I know are shitty forums
and then take everything else with a grain of salt if I do read it
I just study from my own experiences
this is why I dont read anything
this^
you can wake yourself up if you spook yourself enough, though it's much harder to do if you're coming out of being unconscious
everyone gets sleep paralysis but only usually when they go unconscious first
but kept falling asleep or getting interrupted
I have been attempting to enter sleep paralysis lately to experiment with those types of 'dreams'
helps confirm what I think may be traits shared among people when they dream
thanks for sharing your experience though
yeah that happens
dunno what part of psychology that covers but it's something I find interesting
if you wanna talk about the unconscious mind with me I'm free when I'm not sleeping or working, since I've kept a dream journal for 11 years and have done some experimenting.
they can be pretty bad
sleep paralysis hallucinations, sometimes lasting many minutes
and wake yourself up
thats because you get excited
Pretty much what I did was, if I became even slightly lucid in a dream, I would take the opportunity to look at something related to a fear I held, and induce a feeling of paranoia while staring at it intently. This would trigger a nightmare since the things I got scared of were related to the things I had nightmares of
but it depends what kind of dreams you get
worked for me
eventually they become nonsense
it's how I did it
anyway R if you wanna get over your bad dreams, just induce them yourself
but a meaningless simulation of repetetive content is boring
this will bring enjoyment
you can have a boring yet meaningful dream
to the person
I'm talking about the content of the dream being boring and meaningless
because in order to get boring dreams with nothing in them, you have to lead an empty life with no meaning
you actually dont
with almost nothing to it
the only dream I consider bad is a boring one.
but no not yet
I think you mentioned it to me before
especially after I induced nightmares on purpose to get over the recurring one I was having at the time
takes a lot to scare me into being awake anymore
I think it warped it that way to wake me up more easily
the meaning of this type of pain usually translates to a real physical stimulus yeah
yeah I figure thats how it works
for instance I've never felt as much agony as I have in dreams
I think it's pretty interesting how the brain can just make shit up for the sake of simulation
especially compared to the feeling of needing to go to the bathroom when I woke up, it's nowhere near as urgent
tbh the agony in the dreams themselves were quite fucking awful
into that agony
I guess my brain decided it shouldnt do that anymore after I woke up slowly
not after that
I mean it's much better than it randomly happening, but it's kind of extreme to just orchestrate an entire dream plot for that shit
speaking of that though, it's kinda fucked up how an entire dream seemingly just leads up to that moment where I got shot or stabbed as if it were planned from the start that it would happen specifically to wake me up to go to the bathroom.
the one where I woke up induced an extreme agony because I used to dream of myself getting stabbed or shot in the gut if I had to make a bowel movement, the dream would take the feeling of needing to release, and turn it into pain in the dream to wake me up. I once woke up VERY slowly out of one of those and the pain hallucination just amplified and amplified until I fully woke up and it returned to just feeling like I had to pee really bad
one was a hallucination of some fucked up ghoul monster staring at me as I went to sleep, the others were me waking up.
most were pretty awful but nothing I would avoid it for
just a few
I dont have too much experiences with sleep paralysis based hallucinations yet though
I know a lot of how dreams can function and since they're just unconscious hallucinations, I think maybe sleep paralysis hallucinations can also be changed in the same ways
I want to experiment with sleep paralysis to see if there is a way to fix that
most are
I just figured I'd say that
well yeah I know
though walls can actually 'bleed' I forget why though
nice
;^)
I've read all about tulpas after all
I don't avoid things because they may be wrong
and laid on the couch til I couldnt move
and I just happened to rush shoveling snow off my driveway that day
I've discovered it's easier to enter sleep paralysis when your body is more exhausted than your mind is
I haven't actually WILDed since
but that was only for that one instance
correction: I was perfectly conscious and the time if not 1:1 was pretty much only off by a minute at worst
ok sorry
and I hate that feeling
because it just felt like I was waiting for something to happen
so my nap didnt last so long
though being in that dream was awful because I could actually still feel time passing as normal
the flow of time is consistent in dreams actually depending upon lucidity, for instance I once WILDed and the time that passed in the dream was the same as it had been in real life, since I was still mostly conscious
this may not cause physical discrepancies but it may cause entities in the dream to pop into existence randomly
dream modification, such as tonal shift, can sometimes be directly linked to emotional shift.
at different times
which is why I say modifying a dream is more effective for different mechanisms
I was about to say that every single dream any given person has follows a different set of logical rules that are only and mostly consistent for that specific dream.
I don't think that's entirely true
might have to do with scenery adjustment
like, light switches making light sources turn on
but early on in keeping dream journals people seem to be unable to produce a result such as  thing-does-thing
I am not entirely sure why
well
or forces other than gravity
at least I noticed this once I was starting to feel physical forces like momentum in my dreams
over the years my dreams have definitely improved in simulating different physical rulesets
well
physical simulation maybe?
I've never really talked about this with other people so I don't know best how to explain my experiences with it so please excuse me if I say anything roughly.
I'm just saying but, in my experience dreams can be altered by various different mechanisms, the effectiveness of each method changes depending on how the dream is dictated from the beginning.
in other words I triggered it using referential information
I merely triggered the usual recurring dreams by emphasizing my focus on aspects of them in the current dream I was already having
I didn't /will/ anything
going back to 
```
you are not the representative of how dreams work. you dont just /will/ dreams to the content you want. ive tried, and failed. the general architecture of a dream is generally dictate to the content you consume, since dreams function by looping back information of things you already know in one big mish-mash that swirls around with the general feelings at the time
```
so it's just an entry level hallucination due to the unfamilliarity of it or something I guess
makes sense
I see
the latter is just generic and can happen because of how the experience feels
I'm more interested in the former
the common or shared hallucination involves a shadow man wearing a fedora. or something sitting on your chest since it feels heavier than usual
sleep paralysis is more commonly known so I would like to know if the "common hallucination" is memetic or not.
That's very interesting
Ok thank you
so you're saying you had the dragonfly hallucination BEFORE reading about it right?
the dragonflies are memetic
you misunderstand
no
much like shadow people wearing fedoras when experiencing sleep paralysis
it's just memetic
I think that the idea you will see that in a particular situation will cause you to if you are told you might because other people have
seeing similar hallucinations that is
I question those types of traits
ok
so the opposite
ah
I dont know enough about it to describe it any other way
I hope we can talk about this more some time
you too friend
we can continue this later if you want
goodnight
aaaaaaaaand it is 3AM time to sleep
instead of saying how interesting it was
otherwise I'd be talking about how fucked up all the shit I saw was
with my eyes closed of course
the few times I've actually experienced controlled sleep paralysis, I've induced it on pure accident

"So why did he talk shit about having underage nudes and lose his shit about the cops getting on his ass for pictures he didn't have"
Bwen is an incredibly dumb drunk, the point is, he used to have them, which either way is just as bad as having them at all.
I don't really believe he only used to have them though instead of having them at the time and deleting them before telling us.
and he kept just talking in circles
I argued with him for 3 hours about the mind break thing
"and his actual defense of distributing underage nudes and blackmailing someone was "I was drunk, it doesn't count""
Actually he only blackmailed about pictures he didnt have anymore and the former never happened. I don't think he excused himself due to drunkeness but blamed the alchohol itself. Not defending him but I like to make sure the story stays consistent with what actually ocurred
whom NJ here
but it's looking good
There's some good news, to keep it short we got a time extension.
but we still need to get a tenant and new jobs
but yeah
still a lot
Well we just need 3K now
Though the room for one is ready now.
The only reason we havent gotten the money together is because we didnt have the time to get tenants in
We'd be capable of paying off the loan within the next year, and we also have a lawsuit on someone that could potentially get it sooner than that once it gets started
Basically my mother's BF walked out on us after not paying the mortgage for two months and sleeping with 7 other women, here we are a few months later and basically we foreclose tomorrow if we dont get enough to get reinstated.
Would anyone be capable of a 3.4K loan? We can realistically pay it off before the year is out.
:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
whomst wants to buy some charcoal pastels so that I can pay my mortgage
now then
