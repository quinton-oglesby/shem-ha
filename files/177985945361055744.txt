the ed should have been a 1 hour special
a bit rushed but i'm quite satisfied
do it
gonna fix that in the bd
WAIT FOR WHAT
BECAUSE SYMPHOGEAR
even her hair is a sword
nice
praise nana
i love sheryl and ranka
but macross yes
i'd recommend nanoha if you haven't watched it
i loved the macross frontier movies
idols singing while pilots in mecha fight
needs to be until season 7
because 7 is the answer
hope they fix that in the bds
that one
the scorpion in is the first eps, like stuck inside ice from antartica
or 2nd ep
the scorpion is in the 1st ep?
because of the songs
i'd prefer symphogear StrikerS
symphogear sunshine lol
there was the love live movie in between
watch it
XDU
Lol
They focused on the boobs
Nice XDU carol

i just remind myself of the lyrics of Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari
i'm rewatching the concert scenes lol
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I want to see tsubasa singing one of her songs in a karaoke then having a low score on it
nice
Tsubasa will be the lead
Symphogear DDR, they are going to dance instead of singing
Symphogear Reflection and Symphogear Detonation then
XD
Symphogear StrikerS, Symphogear ViVid, Symphogear Force
but i liked the movie
^
manga prillya is <:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
manga is way better
read prillya instead
just the perfect gift after XV
I love it
that the gramps in the temple is her real life gramps?

new protagonist is going to watch a Tsubasa x Maria concert, then she suddenly bumps to an energetic orange haired girl
when nana is 60 yrs old and still flying while singing in concerts lol
i'll still attend a tsubasa concert even if i know the risks <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>

look forward to the future

*LOVE*
lol
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
i'm still happy with the piano version
I was really expecting kimi dake ni to be sung in the anime like all of the other 2nd track songs of hibiki
but i love all of them
i agree
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I remember the u's 3rd anniversary Love Live
nanjolno really cries so easily XD
so what is the point of the chernobyl reference and gas masks in the op song again?
i hope they put a part of chris birthday in the zesshoushinai
still can't decide how to rank them though
adam, carol, and fine
