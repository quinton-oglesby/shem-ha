Iirc the reasoning for this outfit was that vincent was supposed to appear but they cut him and randomly gave cloud his scarf and claw
I amused he just shoved it under his advent children(?) Coat
Im sad that we didnt get this in kh2

~~am i the only who really liked cloud's kh1 outfit~~
If they where to do a garo crossover which garo would it be?
Og? Ryugaverse? Or anime?

I guess she can also be wing zero custom since she sang all the wing openings
The king basically made the kivats and kivat the 1st went to his son
Both the sagarcs and kivats where made by the fangires
Mhm, apparently it was the first fangire king's armor
Oh yeah apparently toei updated their official kr wiki and apparently the saga armor predates the kiva armor
F
So yeah its pretty much scrapped now
They showed a prototype years ago
I still want a saga figuarts
*you can see tini mario and lugi piloting the mech in their chest, thats adorable*
Rom and ram?

If the rumors are true, possibly 2022
G1 shrapnel, animated prowl, titans return doublecross, sixshot and arcee
