hello, i'm very gay
hello

thanks
i also have way too many amiibos...
i would really love to get this sometime

my cat wife
my only figures of note are a chibi y'shtola figure and a cheap kongou sitting in a chair holding a teacup fig
new york pizza too thin
what if i want good pizza tho
same
cags is horny, and i support her
i was hesitant about them choosing a boy for the va
they aren't defined in a category like that
gah that wasn't backspace
they are not anyth
well it shifted to me personally when I said that, but yes
I don't know how many trans girls would want to be told they look madculine
it's an option
you could not say it at all
I mean
that seems to be saying those are the only choices, which they aren't
I personally would not want to be told I look masculine
male/female are bad words to use when talking about people, in general
(sorry, dl - i hope this isn't coming off negatively for you. i love your art and involvement, it wasn't really meant to be negative commentary, since I didn't read kanade or maria as boys, just that you have the genderswap versions and it was plausible enough that they might be included for pride stuff)
yeah that was the main thing that helped me figure it out
it took me a bit longer than a glance for the pride pics to realize that it wasn't dl's boy kiri or bikki's, tbh
trans exclusionary radical feminists
terfs are anti-trans feminists
i wouldn't exactly call muscles masc
in the heat of the moment of being specifically harassed, i would say that yeah it's not that bad
there's a disconnect between online and offline for me, almost out of necessity
I don't even call myself hazel in my head a lot of the time
believe me, we're a mess even if we look confident
it's complicated.
I say all this when i do traditionally masc stuff that many girls aren't in to, of course. like I'm sitting here grilling and wondering if there's any baseball on.
but also for trans women that's a very bad thing to say that can send them spiralling as it stands
I mean yeah that's an ideal
i would hope you're both living and breathing
flab on the mind? try gay on the mind
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
yikes
i hope you're not saying wfc has to gouge out both his eyes
i would ask about getting an invite but i don't know how well invested i'd be
I'm really glad everyone feels safe coming out here
like
you are literally defending the law keeping it very hard to enter the country?
then why defend it
do not fuck with this
a bad situation
to escape
every channel is legitimate channel
fuckin' aces
i'm glad that people aren't allowed to seek asylum unless you can wait for citizenship to go through
got it.
okay so 'the law is all that matters'
what the fuck does it matter to you my dude
why do you complain about illegal immigrants
EVER means it in a non racist way
who complains about illegal immigrants
NO ONE
and no one
he doesn't need you to defend him
his character and his history is that he's a racist prick, dude
no???????
that's not what the statement means, at all
??????????
time to buy a second fridge
ganbare zio-kun
all insurance is a racket
it's a fact
that's not even an opinion
there are very few places with good public transit
it definitely is
having a car is a big necessity in america
believe it or not, insurance is a racket, so not just people who are illegal immigrants won't have insurance
not 'they're an illegal'
also if people get into car accidents and run they probably don't have insurance
there are people dying right now that are deterred by the immigration policies
lol
the republicans?
okay, but who is going to pass this reform
so just "fuck you" to anyone trying to immigrate now that can't wait?
or drug cartels, depending
i think failing to pay taxes causes liens
not you saki
don't charge anyone with tax evasion until we deal with the 1% in our country imo
i don't think it's straight to arresting
alternately: they become president
they probably wouldn't?
and be treated like actual humans
to get into our country
when you say that people have to obey the law
that means nothing
we're fighting it and attempting to disregard it completely, by not fucking putting PEOPLE IN FUCKING CAGES
yes
would you say that disregarding the law entirely is still not the answer
slavery was the law
it's fucking disgusting
this is the kind of argument you would probably hear about slavery
yes it is
you're right, countries have a right to keep people locked in cages for daring to try and escape their poorer situation
unless you're trying to be Indifferent Observer which is also pretty shitty, there's no reason to talk about the law the way you are
lol
ancap?
abolish guns
there's pieces on the news about 'all the good cops do for your community!' all the goddamn time
lmao
yes you do
do you know how many cops get away with shooting unarmed brown people
yes it does
muslims do not
cops have power
it is.
i don't even know where to begin with grox's bad statement lmao
thinking
doubtful
acab is all cops are bastards
lol
ACAB.
so is being told to 'not stereotype cops'
i'm sorry for being racist against cops uwu
thonking
do you think the cops are good t oo
grm
that's 'free space'
lol
do they want to restrict access to trans healthcare
are they against abortion
yeah but do they care about gay rights and women's rights
i don't know any good republicans
it has to be about party lines unless there's an obviously real good candidate
soon
it's midterms
get your local republicans out of office
that's what i said
yeah
it's still stereotyping, even if you didn't mean it that way, though
if you don't know who was in the car, there's no point blaming 'the illegals'
then don't stereotype about it
that sounds awful
it's a thinking noise
hrm
i don't find any value in continuing this convo since i don't think anyone's gonna convince wien of anything, but others may continue
sure you get a bad king every now and again, but hey, that's politics!
those worked out okay
let's go back to pure monarchy
guess democracy can't work!
very democratic
you have some interesting opinions my guy
because greedy fucks get into power
nowhere, because it's never been utilized properly
damn
communism is good, capital C communism is bad
in which case, lol
unless your view of communism is "haha stalin and mao"
communism is good tho
ancom is good
well, okay, let me rephrase: america vastly outweighs the combined instances of this happening in every other country
this doesn't happen in other countries
that's all. don't normalize 'gun' as first response.
is stop giving cops weaponry
all we need to do
this is true
who wants anarcho capitalism
i let xdu play itself
godspeed
xdu?
which waifus are you tapping
yeah i feel like any shit would be more likely to happen in discords dedicated to speedrunning the game
quoting a paper isn't an answer
no, i'm still asking why it's invalid
it's the paper's
i should clarify: that's not _his_ point
and is also, well, perhaps, not the best
it's something in a paper
that's not his point, though
solopy you still haven't said why it being uncommon makes it invalid
don't engage
lmao
yes i'm sure i've hurt many alt-right people's feelings by calling them pieces of shit
the implication that getting angry in an argument is bad is, well, also bad
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgZkSPzWsAAr4UI.jpg:large
reminds me of boogie
that's some interesting tone policing
yes, i'm obviously trying to rile them up
why does frequency matter my dude
like, am i just supposed to shut up when i don't have the mental spoons to go fucking google basic intersex information for this person
Glitch Infel - Today at 6:35 PM
tbf "do intersex people not count for you" is a fair and valid response to "but those conditions arent common enough to be counted"
i mean
and provide exhibits
why do i have to act like i'm a lawyer
instead of responding to the thing before that
because he was asking me for evidence lol
yeah
i shouldn't have to have a PHD to talk about things
i mean i think pushing back against people who are being dumb about things that are categorically untrue, even if you're 'angry', is valuable, but whatever
'disagree with'
golly i'm sorry that i'm not smart enough to know the specifics to be able to participate in this
i don't know what he's expecting of me, a picture of a bunch of intersex people?
i hope this helps you
okay here's the evidence: intersex is a thing
you're claiming that there are only two sexes 🤔
does intersex just not exist to you, or
so they have to occur commonly to be counted
ah
too late for what
thank you
sounds like you should just do it tbh
I mean
lol
what does that mean chris
considering the vast population of trans people on this server
there shouldn't be any ice tbh
at all
no, jokes like that aren't fine
I dunno why that's not an instant ban
I mean he made an 'I identify as an attack helicopter' joke
they're denying trans people
I dunno what you expected from that person, saki
can we ban them
oh boy
there's no threshold required for something to be recognized
hoo boy
'sharing highly offensive memes' is already a huge red flag for me imo
idk how it works
is that actually enough to keep responsibility off server owners?
because, well, there's nsfw channels
that makes me wonder though: does this server have stuff set up to deal with underage users
boogie's tweet about people waiting 5 more years for gay marriage instead of fighting for it fiercely is well, bad
lol
yeah
is definitely, well
'but A Human male cannot become something other as a female '
there's no room for 'a male cannot be a woman' shit
honestly the terf rhetoric shit should've been the instant ban
well alice, we just banned a transphobe
not how dangerous the internet is
you should be talking about depression
my main issue with the sentiment is
yeah, they bring that up in the article
jesus christ
It was such a big deal that the head of the Hetton Primary School posted this on the school’s Facebook page: “I wanted to warn parents, especially those who might have older children, about this game. The internet is a great thing, but it is also a minefield.”
really glad to hear you didn't lose your switch
and got kind of screamered in 2kki that put me off
i played nikki and 2kki
i got screamered as a young child and i made sure to avoid things from then on
yeah the normal end of undertale is super out of nowhere
interesting take from him
i think i experienced enough glitchiness and enjoy glitch stuff enough beforehand that it didn't really create a negative association, which i'm glad for
like i enjoy ddlc and i really loved monika but that doesn't really mean i necessarily agree with the creator on his views
it's not meta per se in that it doesn't talk about being in a vn but the way it addresses the concept of 'seeing everything' is similar
hell hollow ataraxia probably says something even better with what it does, since the whole plot is about 4 days looping and the person who causes the time loop in the first place eventually seeking new things even though it will cause the 4 days and his existence to end
you're just going to a different chapter
it's still a piece of media
i still need to go get all the events cleared out for hollow ataraxia so i can read the epilogue
i was immersed as fuck when i read through both fate vns
they're there to be experienced
as different stories
especially when different routes are designed with that in mind
it's a bit weird to make a huge point about people seeking out multiple endings
i only watched some youtube guy play it and it really fucked me up
yeah that's more what i mean
the existential horror of the ending of ddlc got me a lot
good luck, saki. i hope you can be in a safe place
lol
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
👀
that you think that's the outcome
lol
Israel is the aggressor to a minority
it is not complicated
he definitely is lol
no he is
^
to act as if war and conquering in the current era is correct and good is fucking insane
it is evil
it is unjust
I do every day bitch, try again
you're insane
as if winning a war puts you in the right at fucking all
not on the contrary at all lmao
jesus christ you are dense
the war for the right to fucking exist
Israel has taken over almost the entirety of the space Palestine used to occupy
no they aren't lmao
the extremists, aka the people that Israel stomped on for years as they slowly took all the land
eager to place the blame on the palestinians
instead of a normal peaceful protest
politically biased to say that a riot broke out
🤔
that's the UN
that's not news
it does
acting as if the news doesn't suck off Israel every time this comes up is pretty lmao too
you're drinking the kool-aid
you're blaming terrorists for the fact that civilians die when they're not the ones fucking shooting
it's not lmao
have a nice day
i'm gonna deny israel's existence i think, just as much as they are denying palestine a right to exist on a daily basis
thinking
shut down what?
I'm giving a big thinky right now
keep it up
well you're doing a fine job of keeping it escalating
to make things worse?
what is your purpose here
got it in one
yeah that's what I said
Also, I'm a woman.
I will do as I please. You do not have the moral high ground.
????????
oh yes swearing such a terrible thing
fuck off kanade anon
tell me how good the average Palestinian's quality of life is compared to israel's
lol
he has control over the way he thinks
then why bother saying anything
^^^^^
that's an interesting generalization
because of what pop wobbles said
I am going to disregard a first hand comment from a member of the aggressor
damn you're right guess I have to entertain any viewpoint ever
you can shrug all you want dude lol
which is fucking disgusting.
he has defended the actions taken as "because Hamas uses civilians as cover"
he is
they are wrong to try and act high and mighty about Hamas when the military jumps at ghosts and murders anyone they please
🤔
I live in america
oh wait
yes I need the first hand experience to know what gunning civilians down is like
lmao kanade anon
you know that having snipers gun down a bunch of civilians because of supposed terrorists is what the outcome is
sure
you can make fun of me some more after I leave and call me a bitch or slut or w/e you want
truly an ally
I'm glad kanade anon thinks siding with the sexist is the right choice
lol
much to be gained
yeah kanade anon what if I bothered to listen to this opinion too
uh huh.
uh huh
he made a blanket statement about women, not just me
no, there's nothing to 'clarify'
you have fucked up
you can't back out of this one
no dude
but I'm not tolerating this sexist idiot
yes
no, we're done here.
what the fuck us wrong with you
get fucked you stupid moron
hold the fuck on
jesus fucking cheist
and not israel
you blamed hamas
you act that way dude
my position is that he agrees with and supports his government for the most part so I'm not inclined to listen to his opinion
I mean you're both attempting to argue from some weird position of mine that doesn't exist so I'm just baffled
hmm
yeah...point
it's mostly just kind of funny
I dunno why you're intent on keeping this weird charade going
you're right
you're too slow
I already used that earlier mate
which may have been helped by getting on progesterone tbh
yeah, even like two years out i'm getting more changes which is nice
what i really need to do is get around to bras
i have a skirt that i don't really wear just out of both forgetting i have it and awkwardness
so sometimes one of my meds will just run out and i'll just go :x and not refill it until i feel stupid enough
another problem i have is that since i'm completely dependent on my parents i feel guilty about refilling them
i'm incredibly forgetful is the problem
instead of all at once
maybe i should be uh, taking them three times a day
it's 2mg tablet
or maybe i'm thinking too hard about it
i take 6mg daily
i wonder if i don't have enough
instead of feelings
i thought it was based solely on results
i didn't know there was a correct dose
hell yeah!
hell yeah
zio will have to yell SHIKI with less enthusiasm for a bit
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
even after looking at the Wikipedia page at some point
I still don't know what a hernia actually is
my last relationships left me fucked up and wondering what I want
kiri nooo
dess_time london
oh no
lol
dess_time 20 minutes
so i'm not inclined to really buy any of them
cd projekt also has some notoriously bad treatment of workers
it's like the 'i identify as an attack helicopter' 'joak'
fyi 'did you just assume their gender!?' is just as offensive as 'let's kill all babies'
'I mean it's not like they said "Let's kill all babies." Or anything. Someone made a poorly thought out joke and they apologised for it.'
i wonder how this goes with hrt
well, sometimes i enjoy bud light after a burger
the only booze i enjoy is a nice cider
it just makes you look like an ass
it's like picking on furries, what's the point
people like ocasio give me a small hope for the democratic party
Canada will be a nice 100 degrees in winter don't worry
haha...too real alice
i mean the Republican party actively makes me fear for my future as a minority
Trump is probably about as bad as reagan, and just as senile at this point
i would've said pence first probably
who is measurably worse than one of the highest profile republican party members
celebrate their death*
telling people they can't celebrate a high profile politician who actively makes lives worse isn't like, some party line
i think that anyone being disingenuous would be easy to call out about that
lord knows i will when trump keels over from stress
i think it's absolutely fine to celebrate the deaths of shitty people
https://twitter.com/spacetwinks/status/1033516263643983872
word of warning is that the clip at the top is super unnerving because you hear gunfire and people screaming
also the only real thing is that crunchyroll's backend and working environment kind of suck, but there's not much of a reason to be mad that people are getting a chance to create
mombot sucks
yeah..
i think this is the first time ive had anxiety to the point where i have trouble breathing
haha
yeah and how do you tell if someone's a women if they're not visibly trans
you know that's the exact argument people use to keep trans people out of bathrooms or locker rooms
i am entirely sure this stunt was in bad faith
it's not so much 'excluding an entire group' such as 'willfully misunderstanding the outrage and going "SEE WE TRIED"'
can't believe lol and dota are BOTH bad
but being afraid of people 'faking' to get in is incredibly detrimental as a thought process
it's not good!
yeah
wha
because that's what love is
do you want a giant spear in you
the only love i have is brynhild romantia
:c
i think it's a wrestling joke...?

<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
there's a lot of issues with being told you're smart since grade school that can cause a lot of anxiety and stress in higher-level education
thanks for the advice though :p
it's back on <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
yeah, plus I had brought home food to eat so I had to take stuff out. everything important is put away at least
yeah, just kind of annoying navigating putting groceries away at 7:30 <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
ugh my power is out
<:DMJii:458047433067200512>
yeah
affect sales of official goods negatively
doujins don't really like
yeah
because i know LL has had similar things in the past
i think it's mostly just a thing the company has to say
they're doing anime for fgo, holy shit
(wish the anime would use gudako tho)
and I mean fgo has some stellar storytelling itself
I would say it's focused on exploring concepts in respective series
and like, I absolutely adore fsn, I read it in february. but it's definitely like. to use 'anime' in the lame ass pejorative way...anime
it's pretty weird to call everything after fsn meaningless anime glop when everything that's come after usually has far more going for it...barring zero and anything that isn't the animator showcase that is the back few bits of the apocrypha anime
🤔
'F/SN Is still a fantastic VN even if the franchise and setting has devolved into meaningless anime glop'
karasuno is definitely going to win nationals i think
also i mean
wanna see how hinata breaks through for sure
i think the current haikyuu match is interesting since the plot was kind of leading up to it forever
so every match is telegraphed
unless they plan on contuining the manga past the current school year
i don't know why it exists
i would like the anime design more without the snout
well that's what the manga is
the pupilless eyes are better, too
https://i.gyazo.com/4d4b23638d47dc8a712c2409426a8ff8.png
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
this looks fine to me
https://s3.mangadex.org/data/0135b7bf9dde4a81bc652a043c23f7dc/5.png
and makes no sense
the snout looks ugly as fuck
i hate that design for the spider
the manga looks better
the band probably fits at least one bang dream character
oh interesting they just announced april
I thought one punch man s2 wasn't gonna happen til 2020 or w/e

i don't know why i'm required to be nice to people who are defending illegal immigrant rhetoric
not really
you're dumb
we've achieved galaxy brain
🤔
not even kinda
don't try to say it isn't
if the quote is 'illegal immigrants are gonna ruin our country' that's fucking racist
that's still racist my dude
whoops
oh wait you're not the other guy with the red name
is racist
'"them immigrants gonna ruin our country" shit.'
i mean.
despite being born to immigrant parents he's just become an ultra fuckwad that loves conservative talking points
yes
they're both on my emulator so i can basically just treat them as idle games i check on

face melter is really good
and i can potentially buy the badge from curserella
jesus, face melter, lichy trigger finger, and ancient hero's bandana all on floor 1
huntress' crossbow is just such good value
well i wasn't ready to fight two beholsters so that was foolish
also lmao, glitch chest
but well, bullet...
typically i would play huntress before i unlocked bullet
damnit here i go
and the rat...
well, that and defeating bullet hell
and i have everything but robot's done now
i only beat the hunter's past before AD&D
that's probably true too
it kind of sucks when you first start out and is really hard but once you unlock a lot of the stupid guns it's so good
i really appreciate that gungeon only gets better and more fun as you go on
...gungeon?
and that's more for taiga and shirou than anything

kerry
oh

lol
but i really wanted that excaliber synergy
i shouldn't have picked up the knife shield
the reaper that shows up if you have too much curse is really dangerous lol
yeah
i rolled way too hard on the curse and ended up paying for it
THE POLICEMAN DIED
hmmm
uhhhh i think i got too much curse
speaking of remote bullets...
also mega hand from the boss
er, secret room
also i just got excaliber from a locked room with a dead guy and a note
especially if you have the remote bullets
let's not put arcsys on the same level as ea....
