<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
can there be too much Chris?
time is meaningless dw
🤔
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
Doesn't seem important enough to make an announcement
I guess in general?
if it gives that information
depends on the discord API
(although heads up: I'm not planning on renewing my nitro so my boost will only last till the 28th)
It would be nice to know
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864> army unite
was getting confused with KirikaCry
it doesn't <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
oh wait
\:kirikasad: already exists
heh
<a:KirikaAniSad:802207428242047018>
kinda agree
what did you have for dinner, rady?
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
that is a very good emote.
<:KirikaTired:688429723726250054> oh no
only happy Chris allowed.
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Kerrik, you were looking for features to add to the bot :P
<:blobkek:714875048556757082>
so 3 days ago?
solid plan
sounds solid
I think it's fine enough imo
eh
I'd put western content in a future TV/movies channel though
and VNs in Games
I think manga and LNs fall under anime in general
makes sense.
I agree with the suggestion
not just for tokatsu(?) but western TV and movies too
I think a general live action channel would be quite useful.
just a heads up that my boost is going to run out in 5 days or so.

<:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642> <a:KirikaPlead:802213360334012416>
<:thonking:769919575957045278>
like usual <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
we made the same mistake
chaos my man <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I guess it would be a little off topic
Python goat
ayy
What language do you use to write stuff, Gwen?
that would be possible
details, details
just refuse to help him in dark souls until he accepts Gwen's idea <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
he's now pro-fun!
I should learn more about these types of things <:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>
Personally, I think it would be interesting
Probably a useful feature <:blobkek:714875048556757082>
🤔
What would it do? A simmilar thing to shemmy?
🤔 interesting
so the bot reads all the messages people send and then generates messages based on that
randomly generates messages based on user's messages
(more often it already does <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>)
and spew garbage most of the time
yes
<:ver:796600580101373952>
that would bring chaos
what on earth
the bot would produce a lot of junk lol
0.22: you can (now) have fun
nice
I thought you didn't do fun, Kerrik
🤔
Nitro <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
I have the clean OP, but it still wouldn't make a good emote :P
yeah it wouldn't make a good emote :P
mm Kerrik already has a gif in his collection but it has captions
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
do you want me to trim it? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
:P
the gif
yeah it's 6MB
I got it to fit in the profile picture limit <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
XV EP13 as an emote?
animated emotes take up different slots than non-animated emotes
yeah, that's probably the case
that might work.
apparently fancontent gets drowned out in <#336297808221044736>
true
Although having the bot take messages from the XDU channels mean there will be a lot of XDU related content
guess so
crop <:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
<:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>
<:saitothink:608785048539365376>
wouldn't that create multiple unrelated sentences compared to one larger answer?
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
Rady just make your own shemmy
🤔
I personally think the current rate for <#336297387863703552> is fine
I think they mean if it gets increased
interesting 🤔
Discord has a 2000 character limit
🤨
Then start writing essays in general, it learns from you <:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
I think the rate adds to the messages when they actually send
make a 2 frame gif and each frame is the same image <:blobkek:714875048556757082>
I think there is a premium for static emote space
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> has my vote <:tutturu:464457018921713665>
also that
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
adding backgrounds to emotes is kinda bad
doesn't look that great tbh
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
<:HibikiThonk:805183257280512000>
is a legendary emoji
<:HibikiThonk:805183257280512000>
<@340979591864909834>
that
:Wheeze:
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
It doesn't really look like she's thinking
🤔
I am in support
it's in <#739277869124943964>
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<a:ChrisHappyCry:744335804482060349>
no the background <:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
oh it's American English <:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
what is Squee <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
or stealing ideas <:blobkek:714875048556757082> <:blobkek:714875048556757082> <:blobkek:714875048556757082>
<:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
missed opportunity for me seven <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
tbh it's not important enough <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
With a sample size of 5 <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
RIP Chaos' muscle memory for reacting to messages
it does look more like miku laughing than being excited imo
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> doesn't really have any uses though <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
550
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> has been used 308 times, <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556> 374 🤔
looks kinda plain
replace the background with the army of robot kirikas <:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
Background makes it too cluttered
I think the crop with the cake is better <:tutturu:464457018921713665>
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
just erase miku <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
imo this is the best crop <:tutturu:464457018921713665>
Birthday!
just have it summon with a command
<:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
Miku isn't being squeezed lol
but...
🤔
I think Laugh is probably the best one lol
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>

hi star
although I don't mind the liveposting because most of the time I ignore it, but occasionally I've seen spoilers I'd have rather not have seen.
I do find the liveposting in the channel a bit much to be honest - threads may work better for this feature? So that people who are interested in seeing stuff can opt-in while those that don't want to see everything don't have to. Could just be enabled for <#977744682035605514> or something.

🤨 those tabs

awesome!
That's cool
nice work

top right lol
you must have a lot of patience to build something like that haha
nice work

... Why would you draw that...
How long did it take you to get that far <@263534352422404096>?

developing for android isn't <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
can vouch, fuck android java
the solution is simple, don't use linux <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
applications > web <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
they even run adverts on TV for AWS, Kerrik, you should know <:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
amazon web services
compared to just passing a url through
it'll still use a lot more bandwidth if it has to download and upload every single image
it would use a lot more storage if it downloaded every image
that makes sense
ah
but if it's a rare problem it doesn't really matter
it would certainly be easier to just make the bot make the file extension lowercase
my condolences
what language is it coded in?
javascript makes no sense though <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

<@!161155855524298752>
like, if the result is longer than the longest pixiv/ascii2d link to just spit out an error?
<@!263983345669505025> wouldn't it be useful if the bot checked to make sure how long a message was before it sent it so this doesn't happen?
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
and a disc has to be authored which costs a lot of money
well it's not really economical to just print one of a disc <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
BDs as in Blu-Rays?
as it technically breaks copyright
maybe

let's not

<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
ascii2d.net has a 5MB limit.. so.. even if we didn't have boosts we could break it :P
https://tenor.com/view/taps-if-you-say-so-gif-9803186
we can just remove the server boosts to fix the problem
ah
kerrik that's lazy
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
so you can filter out the HTML soup
check the length of them
before the bot sends messages in this channel
<:portdoll:796600541874487326>

it should be fine
low, unless you're using it in unintended ways
context?
why would they do that
bruh
Your dad sounds awful. My condolences.
Kerrik was making a joke
once would have been enough
I wouldn't have kept going on about it though

a lot of rural land?

I know
Here in the UK, the public really came together when the government didn't. (Because our government is pretty shit)
eh it depends on where you are from
If there's anything I want to continue from this year is the sense of community and responsibility that was displayed this year
Yeah, that's really shone through in the pandemic
Too bad governments can't listen to predictions
(they said) it's server currency
no
because they aren't really wanting to be inclusive
ah that makes sense
but for other services so that the hospitals could focus on covid patients
I don't think they were for covid
the Nightingale hospitals were used
So was it closed due to a lack of staff?
It sure does in my city, and it's made it an awful place
hoo boy
Problem with rules, people are always going to break them 😕
People have been testing the rules for 9 months now.
half price meal if you sit down and eat it
50% too
Until shit hit the fan in December
our city went into a lockdown for the month of eat out to help out, and because of that, we didn't have much of a 2nd wave
eat out to help out was one of the worst ideas possible
and learning Norwegian
Norway is pretty cold though
I could tell
But I'm not a US politics expert
but it's democracy, person who gets the most votes wins
But it's not fair that the person with the most votes doesn't win
I can see why there's support for it in rural communities
FPTP with difficulties
If you're going to have a 2 party country at least make it FPTP
mmhm
now sheep per km^2, we win 😛
yes haha we have the same problem
Eh it's probably unlikely to pass
That sucks :(
Good luck!

My favourite quote about trump playing golf: in Scotland
First Minister of Scotland - `"I have no idea what Donald Trump's travel plans are, you'll be glad to know.  I hope and expect that – as everybody expects, not everybody necessarily will hope – that the travel plan immediately that he has is to exit the White House. But beyond that I don't know."`
yes
all for a cheeky round of golf
ye
he can land at Barra airport, with the sand runway
knowing trump though, he'll still try
i bloody hope not
and then he runs away to scotland <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

yeah <:pikawoah:763160949410365440>
Childline is anonymous
just please contact someone like childline if you don't want to go to the police
Because you're not 16, your parents still have to take care of you
yes, it's child abuse
uh
is that a joke
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
police officer?
You'd be wanting to speak to the Irish police
yeah, but I'm not sure what a lawyer would do
Hello
cool
anytime 🫂
it is definitely not normal
🤨
true, but less
hating difference
yeah, probably
sounds like they're transphobic assholes
the teachers shouldn't be talking to your parents in that circumstance..
pls
Do not share them here though
that
They might be able to point you in the right direction, or at least talk to you
Yes
childline is anonymous, please
Do you have any way of contacting your teacher?
...
even though email?
There's only so much we can do
Stella, can you speak to a teacher at school?
^^
https://www.childline.ie/ please
I somehow doubt it
Sorry to hear that
oh
I don't know if it's too personal, but do you have any other members of your immediate family?
🤔
yes
<:shibapat:801474647845371905>
Not an excuse by any means
She has serious mental problems it seems
yes
with mental problems of her own (no excuse for being an asshole though)
she seems like a control freak
Covid is dangerous, but not allowing you to touch a fridge for 8 months is pretty ridiculous
indeed
Childline is an amazing service
Just please contact a professional
incase your mum happened to look through the ISP logs
Enable 2FA too
for contacting services like childline
you can use that
Firefox focus clears data after you leave the app
?
or go through someone here
Even on a browser you uninstall after you're done
use incognito
But that's besides the point
Not particularly I think
then use a VPN
Just please use services like childline
Then incognito might be fine
ah
for contacting child services
if her mum checks the internet logs I guess?
And you can use a VPN I guess
if you do it at night when she's asleep, I don't think she'll find out
yes
No problems, just we aren't trained professionals
Apart from please speak to someone about this
Hmm, I don't think there's anything else I can say
Kieran probably
^^

I think you're getting a bit worked up over a tweet from 4 years ago lol
good to hear <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
also, the clocks go forward from their usual time, not backwards
I don't think you're making sense
well, it would get dark very quickly in the winter if it didn't
yeah
???
just time zones are thanks to train companies wanting to co-ordinate schedules
it's not entirely accurate, time itself was always around
time is a lie created by train companies to sell journeys <a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
<:KirikaTired:688429723726250054>
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344> that is how years work
no

Lesson of the day, don't ~~mindlessly regurgitate Wikipedia articles quoting~~ Twitter
<:shibapat:801474647845371905>
^ that
they do go back, but from their adjusted time
a school from ages 12-18
so, quite a lot
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I'm still in secondary school..
I don't really understand what you mean? You learn stuff that allows you to reach a further destination
...
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
to at least try to keep the learning consistent
but like, is there any regulator or something?
I guess yeah, it depends on city/state levels 🤔
I don't agree here
but like, what on earth is a gpa
I guess it's a pretty big generalisation to make
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
it's a miracle people from the US even learn stuff in school with the horrors I hear about their education system
*gestures at everything*
they are a good programme.
the US education system seems like a far cry from like, the rest of the developed world
no, not really
I don't know if there is anything else to say that hasn't already been said
I know
which I think is the same in England
after S3 you can choose subjects to study for your exams
after S4 it becomes a free choice
from P1-S3, yes
I guess... but at least here, schools themsleves can decide which subjects they offer to students for their exams
I can't speak for every school, but at least in my school, there was an entire department dedicated to this
what benefits would decentralisation of education bring? I personally can't see them
I guess here in Scotland we have education devolved
ah
what do you mean by that, Armis?
due to the nature of SEN
also, I didn't specifically mean you
I mean the average person at a regular school
it's quite likely that it takes a longer time to teach you stuff at iscoil than at a regular school
I'll try to explain it
SEN by nature can not be large scale
they're very small because that's the way they're designed
even though it is not a great way to learn
most people do learn stuff the way it currently is
I know, but looking at the general picture
the thing is though, school works academically for most people
with limited funding at that
the problem is they have to cater for a wide bunch of people while also offering lots of subjects for a large age range
hmm I agree
yes, that's a problem with the school specifically then
but the people at the school should help you to understand
I see what you mean
yeah
that's what college etc is for
Well yes, because it's a different learning enviroment that is more suitable for you
Maybe not growing, but they're definitely full
I can assure you they are, at least here.
Still too much though imo
Yeah I think total is a bit unfair
well they can, they just have to face the consequences
I have computing work to do lol <:Dededess:796618952502542356>
ye
I'm going to end up going to uni without sitting an exam in school <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
although currently, exams? what's that
it's certainly a good thing, as it reduces pressure on your written exam
here most subjects have a practical assessment as well as a written exam to decide your final grade (which is what I think you mean)
🤨

you really should be getting balanced meals, 2 chicken burgers isn't balanced or particularly nutritious
🤔
that makes zero sense
🤔
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
oh no
cold war probably
<:shibapat:801474647845371905>
especially, but it's still inappropriate <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
🤔 that's a completely inappropriate thing to say to your kid
🤔
But then again, the chances of a conviction are slim
Yeah
The major one is that it bars him from running again iirc
and that too
It's probably the best word to use to describe it
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I was just thinking that too, lol
Absolutely.. if only they could put aside party alignment for votes like this
Yeah..
Given as only 6 republicans voted to acknowledge it as valid
I don't see much chance of the impeachment happening though
I remember that now
<:pikawoah:763160949410365440>

Luckily the MSP has now been removed from the front line of the party
This I think
I think some member of parliament here held that meme up in court because people were sending it to her on twitter <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
it's a quote from some MP

at least the fish are British and happy now
<:KirikaTired:688429723726250054>
but I didn't really buy *directly* from the EU
ye
but food I guess <:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
apart from the odd Blu-Ray here and there
I didn't really import from the EU that much personally
I do not <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
well the media pushes cisnormativity <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>

oh
the runaway what
yes
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
yeah, it happens really easily
do you not have hard shoulders?
yes

very easily if there is low visability
they've just put double decker busses running on hydrogen in service here
hydrogen is a good source <:tutturu:464457018921713665>
what's wrong?
well that isn't really the usual traffic <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I just know it's legal in the UK
I don't have a list

the internet will make anything a challenge
Not enough for someone that's still growing, let alone the right stuff <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Yes
But, uh, I don't really have anything to to add that hasn't been said, but do contact people like childline if you feel the need
You definitely need more food than that..
what's happened now?
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

is it a chicken burger again <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
<:TsubasaWave:796610567463895070>
yes
also, backreading, I can contact the folk in Ireland if you need (even though I'm not strictly in Ireland but <:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>)
she is most certainly lying or delusional (or both probably, in this case)
🤔 is she the living in the 30s or something
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I'd hate so see the what the people she knows eat
🤔
doubt
<:thonking:769919575957045278>
what's happened now? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av-embeds/56037475/vpid/p096rgpq quite amazing footage
yeah they're probably not allowed to click on links sent by people
Did you speak to childline or someone about the food?
don't worry about it
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
2 tins of tuna and chicken is not enough food for a day, let alone balanced
are you sure there's no-one at your school that you can contact about the food situation <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
maybe you should tell your mum that it isn't healthy
DMs always open <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

would that be a bad thing
🤔

<:thonking:769919575957045278>
Although don't resort to violence
I think that's the entire statement, the Beeb article was a bit weird <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
```Trump's office released a statement just moments after he was acquitted.

"This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country, It is a sad commentary on our times that one political party in America is given a free pass to denigrate the rule of law, defame law enforcement, cheer mobs, excuse rioters...
Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun. In the months ahead I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people."```
also that ^
he still has a lot of influence in the republican party
I'm sure I read it somewhere they can't but 🤷
I don't think so <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
2/3rds
yeah
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>

The bank is specifically a British bank so that wouldn't help <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I didn't have to go anywhere to open my account, but it's a British bank <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Some banks let you open accounts without leaving the house
It's really easy to open a bank account these days
Which is what happens here in the UK with my money
But there may be a chance it goes into her account before you turn 18
I'm not sure how the Irish benefits system works
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
She is legally not entitled to it
Well yes, it's your money
So you have savings for when you move out
Also I recommend not spending any of the PiP/whatever it's called in Ireland if you can help it
but the first paragraph is good advice
uh maybe don't commit crimes <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
But that's.. er... Concerning
Definitely too low.
The NHS calculator thing said it was in the 1th percentile <:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
Yes
Yes.

<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Still, physical violence isn't everything
oh
Didn't you say she hit you?
Maybe she should stop doing illegal things if she doesn't want to end up in prison 🤔
She's not feeding you correctly, at all <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
It is very odd <:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
...
did.. she stop you trying?
I know you may dislike it, but please try to stay hydrated, even if it means drinking water
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Yeah
Eating only one thing all the time is bad for you
So is only eating popcorn chicken
🫂
she definitely sounds like she has mental problems
an anonymous tip to the police? 🤔
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432> it might be worth it to try again?
Problem is that most of them require you to go to a bank to open an account
yeah
I opened an account when I was 13 and didn't need a parental signature 🤔
I don't think it was needed <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
You can make a bank account from like, 12y/o here
given that I don't pay anything for domestic calls <:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
2.07SEK
18 pence a minute <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
Hopefully lol
If I can find some way if calling into Ireland without it costing a fortune, yeah.

potentially try putting sugar in it?

it would eventually <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
you need to tell your mum to get differnet drinks then
that's not.. good
uh
yes.
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>

oh
yeah
that's better than nothing.
Not that I can remember
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
The court won't help you if it's not a law <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Yeah that's 18 then
and what you're referring to
It depends on your definition of adult
https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/reference/checklists/checklist_at_what_age_can_i.html#
<:portdoll:796600541874487326>
More concerning, you can't leave home without parental consent before you're 18 in Ireland
Actually, I think it depends
I believe so
Well at 16 you're legally an adult
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
depending on bit-depth and sample rate
a 128kbps mono MP3 would be around 50mb/hour approx
depends on the quality
it might use a lot of space on a phone/computer though
it wouldn't be difficult <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I don't think this is the case
and not much else is happening lol
it's an absolute technological achievement that it was able to be done this quickly
yeah, but people are still worried
yeah, I think the first one is definitely a major reason
source: <https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/articles-reports/2021/01/15/international-study-how-many-people-will-take-covi>
very few people consider themselves "anti-vaxxers", more rather people that don't want to specifically take the coronavirus vaccine <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I think this is more it.
it isn't
the full data is available from the link I posted below the image
but it might be because of different companies or methodologies
Thailand has dipped to 69% since the graph was made <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>

(for reference YouGov is the largest polling company in the UK)
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
I just think (and hope) that 20% of the population isn't anti vaccine
It's a completely understandable take to have
Yeah, I have to agree
<https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/children_s_rights_and_policy/children_and_rights_in_ireland.html> <:tutturu:464457018921713665>

Uh it depends on the laws of your country
🤔
if she doesn't want to wash her hands why doesn't she just let you do it <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
indeed
she should put some action behind them if she means it
well it's just words..
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
...
even to your garden?
why though
...
yeah.. I still remember the UK government's "herd immunity" approach that lasted like 10 days
yeah
and above the 80% or so needed for herd immunity
yep
after two doses
It's 95% for Pfizer/BioNTech and 82% for Oxford/AZ
but it is ***much*** cheaper and ***much*** easier to transprot
although it is ever so slightly less effective iirc
Yeah
Noi claims that the Oxford/AstraZenica one is unpopular compared to the Pfizer/BioNTech one
popularity polls on the Oxford/AstraZenica and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines
that too
especially if it keeps mutating because governments keep lifting lockdown restrictions too early
yeah, that's a sensible idea
yep
the Scottish public feel nearly the exact same.
it was in December, just as the UK was starting the rollout.

<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604> only for my local computer

<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
🇮🇹
we just have a border force that deals with customs and immigration
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
not even a border force?
yes
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432> some people can't afford to just quit their jobs though
life 🤷
r/pyongyang is wild.
what
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
poland why
Yeah, it's a complete circlejerk
It would have been heavy
Indeed
because it's not every day that half an engine comes off an aeroplane midflight
well the NTSB are going to want it for investigation
https://twitter.com/I_am_katertott/status/1363244471954063360?s=19
Imagine if the engine had come off and taken the leading edge with it
Commercial planes are designed to fly with only one engine (or 2 in case of 4 engine planes) operational, but that is an incredibly dangerous thing to happen
that video is terrifying.
225W
it was ***very*** cold in texas
both probably
I think it means the price the company paid for the electricity
🤷
yeah but it's capped at a price per kwh
free market for pricing
emphasis on "*for me*"
Definitely worth it to get a new piece rather than juryrigging something together out of stuff that fell from 10km up in the sky
JAL123 is what not to do when repairing an aircraft
They'll definitely need a new engine housing lol
yeah makes sense
yeah, that is pretty impressive it held together so well
or US1549?
This as in the UA777-200?
... Wait
because they're damaged
Most aircraft involved in serious crashes are written off though
It was restored to be put on display
not according to Wikipedia
<:pikawoah:763160949410365440>
I thought it went to a museum?
!
well yes
oh fuck we've moved on
I thought it was only the 787/A350?
Also, does the 777-200 have any carbon fibre?
although they'll want to investigate it for cracks and stuff
yeah
although is that legal :P
<:Hibikiundercover:810717865228501002>
well boat crews should be qualified too lol
and an absolute trainwreck onboard too
tbf that was right at shore
uh
Just most of the time it isn't for good reasons..
you can send planes up to other planes!
yeah there's not many options if you have a mid air emergency
the public are scared of aeroplanes, that's why there's so many safety regulations
they might want to save fuel by using only one engine <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Lol
fly long enough to find an airport
But yeah two on one side when trying to climb would be difficult
1 engine powering a 747 doesn't seem very safe 🤔
It's very likely I can't see
Wait no
Looks like it missed
https://twitter.com/BroomfieldPD/status/1363229479141785606?s=19
At least no-one was injured

they should integrate dealing with climate change into starting the economy after covid

nice
<:tutturu:464457018921713665>
daily mail is one of the worst ones though
it is also the daily mail so 🤷
Interesting discussion here overnight, not something I really thought of before <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
also a lot of school qualifications afaik
shit pay for tough work
and the jobs paid well
wdym by "seize their workplace"?
I was more referring to police. I agree that the military should not be as big as it is.
ah
are you talking about the army or police?
I don't know enough about policing in the US to comment on that.
I don't think we share the same experience with policing.
but crime wouldn't dissappear
but that's not really a discussion I want to have at midnight
I'd argue we do still need (a reduced number of) police officers
by that logic if teachers don't like it they should retire from teaching <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
always has been
yeah it's a shit time to be in the UK currently <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
but this is besides the point
maybe something will happen about Scottish Independence 🤷
the UK desperately needs saving
lol
absoloute clowns <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
if only there was a number governments could increase so people get paid more so they wouldn't have to resort to crime <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
indeed
that's fair
yeah
source, then?
but police and teachers are both important
soldiers yes, police no I'd argue
🤷
then raise their wages too
without governments stepping in, large scale change is difficult
and people hate change
problem is that not everyone would be.
I can see your point
you don't have to. I have decade old smartphones that still work. The problem is they aren't compatible with software people actually want to use, therefore are obsolete.
well yes, but I don't see your point?
why should they pay for being in jail
but modern technology moves so fast that a decade old hardware is obsolete
yeah, right to repair is an important movement
🤔
problem is, life would be shit without this "stuff people didn't need"
but like hell are they gonna do anything
now's the best time, with the recovery from covid
you don't need to make profit off of everything <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
it's awful though
yeaaaaaaaaah I think the US prison system is so far out there compared to everything else in the western world
yeah
yeah the US prison system is a whole other tangent <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
that is a worldwide problem, sadly
because police are needed for some tasks, but some are just inappropriate for the police to handle
I think there needs to be some sort of middle ground found
uh huh
like, I could say that the police here would help me if I needed help.
uh huh
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I think the difference is greater in the US.
I see.
hmm
renewables are definitely the way forward though, nuclear is just a short term solution
oh
<:harold:796610426225164299>
which is why the public don't like it
nuclear ***is*** safe, it doesn't stop it being unpopular due to the premise
Piper Alpha, Deepwater Horizon etc
It's weird that oil accidents don't have the same effect
high profile accidents
public in general have a distrust for nuclear
unpopular though
given we already need extreme economic restructuring after covid
I think now would be the best time for that.
but ye, some action from the UN/EU/US would be nice.
sorry
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
indeed, but it's going to require some actual government intervention, and with the current state of the world? not gonna happen..
Ebola
worst case would be that it kills everyone
it's an unpopular decision though
Still didn't get as much coverage as Chernobyl
problem is there hasn't been a single oil/coal accident that has got as much media attention as stuff like Chernobyl
just Italy things™
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168> the windmill outside my house still operates in -15°C

Yeah but then they reopened too quickly
they're still doing better than most of the rest of the world
yeah it really shouldn't be a competition
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>

yeah, we deal with them by voting them into power! (/s)
wouldn't be surprised
where college is more like what they described, a tradespeople/slightly lower level place of education
whereas outside of the us "college" means a different type of school to "university"
"college" and "university" mean the same thing in the US
not the US
yeah, in most places it is
whereas here in the UK what you are saying is true
yes
not in the US iirc
college in American english just means university
yes
trades
you can train to become a plumber, electrician etc
there will always be a demand for tradespeople
eh, it's not untrue

polls suggest an increasing support for an united ireland
depends on what the people want
there is a lot of history between northern ireland and the republic of ireland.
because newsmax is stupid <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
it's really up to the individual uni to decide
those would be things that would help you when you're in a job
which makes sense
yikes..
🇺🇸
yes, of course
but to me, a scottish person, I think that learning general education in university, which is meant to be super specialised, seems kinda weird
yeah, I can't speak for the American system
I don't disagree, but I personally feel that a secondary school level of understanding is enough to acknowledge this
I studied 3 years of social sciences and humanities at secondary school already, I'm not sure how useful that'd be if I were to go to uni and study a completely different field
but that's just my opinion
the way I think, is that, you learn these skills at secondary school to a satisfactory level to use them going forward, you don't particularly need to relearn them if you're going into a different field
I learnt that at Secondary School.. and I assume you learn while on a course
hmm...
isn't that what secondary education is for?
this is confusing to me as well <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:portdoll:796600541874487326>
sixth form has always been confusing to me lol
here in Scotland, you can continue with secondary school until you're 18
what happens after depends on which country you're in
you can leave school at 16 in the UK
here you can leave school at 16 (but most people leave at 18) to go onto college/apprenticeship
yeah
dealing with paedophiles in general is probably a pretty big deal if I'd say so myself, especially famous ones
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
he was in solitary confinement iirc
<:portdoll:796600541874487326>
it could well be
"committed suicide"
paedophile
the pizza express woking guy
ah that nonce
🤦
I get what they're trying to say, but it comes off the wrong way out of context
🤨
https://nypost.com/2021/02/23/coca-cola-diversity-training-urged-workers-to-be-less-white

yeah, paying someone less than minimum wage for a forced job is a great way to make them feel subhuman <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
me neither <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

how does forcing people to work for no money help them <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
?
that doesn't make it right..
But don't be afraid to reach out to these
Idk where you live so I can't recommend any
Can you reach out to any support service?
it's a difficult question to answer really
uh huh
I think I know..

til you get microwavable pizzas
how do you cook pizzas with a broken oven 🤔
that doesn't seem very balanced <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
she is like, very underweight
uh huh
Given the fact that you're still growing though <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>

Yeah. I don't mean to be rude but there's a really good chance the dog isn't getting taken care of well if it is sick this frequently.
🤔
because sex and gender are different things
<:portdoll:796600541874487326>
there's not really a defined limit of genders
> Seriously, how do we continue to function as a society much longer with so many lunatics among us?
ikr
I guess without a doctor there's not much you can tell her that you haven't already <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
hmm
<:thonking:769919575957045278>
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
uh huh

Have you told your mum that you are severely underweight?
<:pikawoah:763160949410365440>
yeah <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
huh
This may be a stupid question, but why do cis people need puberty blockers?
we did, quite a bit
<:pikawoah:763160949410365440>
because that's really important
there was a big emphasis on learning about consent when it was taught to me, which makes sense
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
there was also a big topic on discrimination here as part of the wider PSE curriculum
Personally, I thought it was taught it quite well.
i see
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> What teachers did you have that didn't discuss sex?
personally, I got taught about it well enough
fwiw she has been taken off the front benches of the SNP in Westminster, but they haven't sacked her yet

that's disgusting
<:HibikiThonk:805183257280512000>
no
Well that's not good
you can open one yourself as young as 13 here in the UK
I can't offer much other support other than I believe in you and that the long term benefits to your health will be massive
you're allowed to be as naked as you want here unless you're causing people fear or alarm, but this is getting a bit off topic lol
<:serenaworried:796600580130078750>
Uh huh
well
but as someone is brought up they should be taught stuff
truetrue
facebook groups
I'd like to think the dos and don'ts are basic human decency.. but <:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392>
It seems weird to have different parts of the country teach different things, here there's a set curriculum that schools need to teach for different subjects
that's not really how the law works afaik
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

yeah I think that them being a police officer is not particularly relevant to the story here
it was said by a member of the house of lords from a minor party
yes
that's exactly what happened
the person who said that is an unelected member of the house of lords
https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/green-party-peer-6pm-curfew-men-disappearance-of-sarah-everard-b923587.html
don't use the daily mail as a source.
The Guardian did the maths, and concluded that it wasn't a higher number of blood clots than at any other time
oh I see
There's no link yet though
Some European countries haulted the rollout due to 38 people having blood clots after receiving the vaccine
?
🤔
I understand, I'm just pointing it out <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
mi is the abbreviation of miles fwiw
and they only have 35 deaths
Yes, it's true
it's the Catholic Church, so I'm not sure what you were expecting
Government forced. Also, news sites comment sections are harmful to health, so I recommend staying away.
Eh.. People continuing to follow precautions, lockdowns in hotspots etc while having a strong rollout would be better
well, an amazing vaccine rollout isn't everything lol
what?
Because they're not using it in the US
Also England is a Protestant country
<:clownoftheyear:796610301734420530>
statistically speaking, is it false though?
because of supply issues
all countries will be vaccinating tho
> most
it's still higher than most of the developing world
proof?
the European Union said it was safe, it's on the individual countries
maybe to do with logistics? idk
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
yes, but probably not after it had been removed from storage
it's probably 1 dose per 100
<:stonks:778543898666467348>
tbf, very few countries have nationalised airlines any more
<:thonking:769919575957045278>

it's not universal if not everyone gets it
<:thonking:769919575957045278>
<:clownoftheyear:796610301734420530>
Because I don't know what that sentence means lol
I still don't get what they mean but ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
I understand the first part, but not the second part
I know that
I'm not even sure what it means lol
...what?
Probably, I don't have experience with Éire CPS though
@\everyone
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:Harold1:730699878098796607>
Good luck.
yeah I figured
🤔  i see
how.. do they test you for that? <:thonking:769919575957045278>
just DM people with the link if they offer help
I'd recommend against posting a link like that in such a large discord
Well it's hard to prove people guilty without evidence
If we're still talking about Stella/Constellation System, they've already mentioned they don't have biometrics on
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
okay
I don't think there's a simple way to set up 2FA like that on android though
oh yeah
I thought biometrics are weaker than a long, complex password?
and remove biometrics (if applicable)
Your best bet is a strong password, not a pin
✨ 2 factor authentication ✨
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
But I can see why they Gardaí would say that to your mum, lower her defenses
they probably should have explained that to you first
yeah
I'd contact them if you have a good relationship with them
but it could well be
🤷 I'm not an expert on Éire law
I just think that a few hours is a bit too soon for Tusla to already have investigated and decided no further action will be taken
Because if she was doing illegal stuff you could tell the gardaí
I guess it depends on the harassment laws
because I don't think your mum is doing anything *illegal*
but otherwise I'm not sure what other options there are
I wouldn't be surprised if they say that to everyone.
idk why they'd visit though
to be fair, I think it is too soon for the gardaí to know if Tulsa will do anything
aside from tulsa I'm really not sure what other options there are
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Goodnight, and remember you can contact us if you need help
That would be best
I don't think any of us have enough experience with Tusla to say, but I'd be surprised if they didn't take action
But we can't really decide
It's still not a particularly good spot imo
It's not really a question we can answer - as we don't know anything about your accomodation
true true
so you'd end up with a broken phone lol
under the mattress would be the bed frame
Somewhere she wouldn't look
uh, back of a drawer with loads of stuff in it?
But try to get as much sleep as possible
Before you head to bed ensure that everything has a secure password
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
because it most likely won't be easy
I'd recommend you sleep anyway to prepare yourself for when you wake up
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
please try
especially as it's now 11 past midnight
may I suggest that you go to bed for the night
Ye
You're just trying to do what's right for you
Don't worry, you're not
it doesn't sound like the dog is particularly well considering the amount of times it has been sick
yes but it would lead to rehoming
If that's the case, I recommend interacting with as many people as you can face to face if you get the population
And it'll likely depend on the circumstances if the time comes
But do ask your contact
I mean you're probably going to be allowed a bag
okay that's not weird
Because there is just not the logistics or space to keep a lot of stuff
Chances are you'll only be able to take a few things, at least into temporary accommodation
I mean the person you're talking to over discord
the best thing to do is ask
Depends on the law of the country
Yeah
????
I don't really see it but oh well
I don't see the correlation
Ye that's not a thing that the health service will recognise
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
If they dislike you, your life will not be great..
What's your reasoning behind it being minor?
not really?
Idk what the temporary accommodation is like, not sure what the Irish system is
Because you're not legally old enough to live alone
If Tusla decide that's the best course of action
A fostering home I guess
But that's not an excuse
Ye your mum definitely needs help herself
from what I can tell
I mean, you've not done anything illegal
there's nothing you can do but wait and see
You don't need a license to buy a knife though lol
you make no sense
<:whatthe:784318400117342238>

The Scottish Labour leader himself, Anas Sarwar is quite popular here too and has high approval ratings.
They also did quite well in Scotland compared to usual, but the full results haven't come out yet
Yes lol <:ultrakek:596401788454961185>
fwiw Labour did well in Wales - but that was probably because of Mark Drakeford
.
they have 8? or so? out of 60 seats in the senedd
yeah

<:hmmm:822375693094092800>

re 10 mins, this was probably the confusion:
```Jawad Mehdi, the owner of the Jala Tower, said an Israeli intelligence officer warned him he had just one hour to ensure the evacuation of the building, the AFP news agency reports.

In a phone call with the officer, AFP heard him beg for an extra 10 minutes to allow journalists to retrieve their equipment before leaving. "Give us 10 extra minutes," he urged, but the officer on the other end of the line refused.```

Also it is optional, lethal injection is offered in both of those states too

then I wish you the best <:crythumbsup:822375692251168769>
It could be that they genuinely think that you don't need the money... It's often ludicrously difficult to get stuff like this, speaking from experience (<:NotLikeThis:816486027853824010>).
But yeah, it sounds like you do need the money and you can prove it, so I'd definitely appeal.
did a professional fill out the form?
dk how the Irish system works
aye in the UK
?
I don't think this would affect anything - at least here in the UK, it wouldn't fit into any categories
You'd also normally have to see a professional here - but I didn't because of Covid. I'd probably wouldn't have got the highest level had I done the application in person
I don't think there's much consistency on how it works
I really don't know
idk
£152.15 a week iirc
it can't be very good because I got highest for everything despite being quite able <:behe:716343526702448720>
pip has different levels and they decide which level to put you in based on professional judgement
oh wait nvm I was receiving other stuff when I applied
I didn't <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
It'll be different in Ireland

a laptop is cheaper than £600 a month, so they give it to more people

idk
So >16 they will share information, 16-18 they might and 18+ they can't 🥴
<:whytho:641024557548961802>
oh they can't guarantee it until you are 18
So in theory a doctor can't tell your guardians stuff without consent
It's 16 in Ireland
Right to confidentiality
in the UK it is weird because you can choose to do it yourself at 16 or have your guardian do it for you until you are 18. <a:thonksun:605301430366240778>
it's probably 18 though
once you reach a certain age I don't think your guardian is meant to have any say in stuff like this

absolutely
💯
yes
Patema Inverted, you have good taste.
it's the only one they didn't add to Netflix 🤔
oh
Princess Mononokue was better anyway
Spirited Away?
Same
About 40 or so mins
It's only a short though, really
It's Makoto Shinkai's previous film
That had a nice ending song
Oh that
That film was hype
I still preferred Promare to Weathering with You for films that came out last year
Yes
It's Makoto Shinkai's next film
It's good
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
🏃
Weathering with You was better
Your Name is like 8/10 **at best**
more people need to see it!
:(
yeah but patema Inverted is *really really* good
imho it's better than your name
Sawano did the Promare soundtrack and ajaiebeiwowjs it's amazing
Sawano appreciation 🙏
Maybe because I like big robots
Eh, I thought it was okay before that.
||when they went to space|| it all went to shit
Franxx was pretty decent until the end
yes
Promare has the best ending for anything trigger imo
Yes
it's made by trigger
I liked the over the top-ness of it, I thought that was what made it great.
🙈
I can't remember
or next
That ended this week?
Theres a new one
but not 40 lol
maybe more than 3
no
40!
are there even like 3 good shows a season?
And my first one was Symphogear XV lol
I think I've watched 1 seasonal at the same time.
Need to watch both of them soon
ah I've just bought escaflowne and hyouka on Blu-ray 🙈
I've heard terror in resonance is very good
i started watching in 2018 and I've seen it 🤔

so it will at least look nice :P
Hopefully I'll be able to see it in a cinema sometime
lol
true, true
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
tbf I don't think the rebuilds are meant to be that connected
that's fair
3.33 was at least interesting
2.22 was boring af
Funimation 😔
3.33 had the best piano scene in anime
It will have robots
I wish you the best of luck 😅
If they come with the collector's edition, I'll read them, but if they don't, I won't feel like I'm missing out on much
I like art books but I don't go out of my way to collect them
and it came with the Blu-rays which is always a plus lol
it's really nice
That's good value
Like I bought Eureka seven on Blu-ray recently and it came with a 170 page artbook for £35
eh to each their own
Blu-rays aren't for everyone but I love having stuff on my shelf
Yeah aniplex sets are poor value
Here you can normally get a complete series for maybe £50 for a CE and £30 for a Standard
Yeah but bloody expensive for everywhere else
that's just aniplex charging £150 for 12 episodes
Subs are burned into the image
although most collectors do prefer Blu-rays
DRM free downloads are hard to offer

***children's channel***
Jan 7th
damn that looks so bad
I wasn't too hot on it on my first watch but enjoyed it more on the second
madoka is certainly interesting
I have the collector's edition of the first two movies and I'm not even a fan of madoka <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Ye the first two movies are recaps
the only idiot catto
<:blobkek:714875048556757082>
might want to spoiler tag those lol
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
do it :P
||episode 10 probably||
cat.
I should watch the recap movies lol
Madoka is like one of the only anime I've rewatched lol
but it was September...
it seems like just yesterday they announced it
although I am not an expert
I think it was around the late 90s/early 00s that it stopped being mainstream
tbf moe probably sells better than mecha
the third season :P
ah
I thought they only did Fumoffu
and: broadcasting in 2021
yeah the 2 just means "Season 2"
the what
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
yeah?
yeah professional reviews
This is why you take MAL scores with a mountain of salt 😛
like news sites, not YouTube
0/10 needs more Italian
Secret society BLANKET!
Laid Back Camp S2 baby
<:ShirabeShock:744441685324595231>
although the bang dream anime didn't start till 2017
bang dream is 2015ish
proudly sits at the bottom of my MAL list
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
It didn't take 3 episodes for me to decide eromanga sensei was not worth watching <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
three episodes is too generous for some shows <:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
https://twitter.com/CatVibeToAnime/status/1349489459432218628
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
S1 art style reminds me of pokemon <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
like, that's 100% my thoughts
agreed
it's been a long day <:KirikaTired:688429723726250054>
<:thonking:769919575957045278>
8, 9, 6, 6, 9
that's pretty much how I scored them too lol
Hi-Evolution: Eureka Seven 1 was the worst by far
I've seen 60 anime movies <:pit:739483496581431336>
I have a lot of movies on my list lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
💯
XV is just that gay
Summer Wars is a really fun film
I still need to watch Mirai though
A slient voice and summer wars <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
GOAT
nice
oh
someone put an int(0.5) instead of round(0.5) <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
my only 10s
lol
> Promare
> 5
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it had penguins which bumped the score up though
I just didn't enjoy it >_<
my lowest ratings <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
🚨
> boku no pico
like a solid 7
I thought it was pretty good, just not a masterpiece
fair
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
> cowboy bebop
> 6
It at least looks nice though
lol
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
They look worse than the streams
The discs are awful though
Funimation I think
I even bought the CE bluray for rezero <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
The OP was better than the show imo
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
I don't like rezero and also don't respect the fact it doesn't have an OP <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:blobkek:714875048556757082>
tbf the first season had good endings, so what's the point of openings!
<:blobkek:714875048556757082>
oh no
is that the one with the toothbrush scene
I only lasted a couple of episodes
Bakemonogatari is weird
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
<:comfychat:771887988368080897>
comfy
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>

that's five euros I could spend on other stuff though
I haven't either 😅
My computer has a Windows 7 COA and I don't feel like buying a Windows 10 license
That's correct.
shhhhhh

Laid Back Camp S2 is very comfy. <:comfychat:771887988368080897>
do share if you enjoy it, maybe that'll be the motivation I need to watch it <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Eizouken got most of my votes
inb4 My Hero Academia wins everything
<:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
I really do need to do that soon
must resist clicking on these spoiler tags <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I liked what I've seen of it
I should finish S1 of IBO.. 🤔
<:chika:747916834782707884>

https://www.animemaru.com/average-millennial-spider-cannot-afford-own-web/
I own the stupid CE and everything
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>

ye
because cinemas are shut in japan right now
it is a spider 😐
Need to check out more seasonal stuff
<:RinPray:799666514877480960>
This show is such a trainwreck
It was because they couldn't be arsed
I don't think they intentionally did it?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
at least it isn't all MHA...
Few things are worse than Rent-a-girlfriend
There were parts of it I couldn't watch because it was so cringeworthy
is that a good thing though?

ah okay
what's the difference between the '79 movies and TV show?
Finished the first episode of 00, it was okay <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
🤔
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
0079 is the original?

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
tbf they had to broadcast it on TV to a wide a demographic as possible
But I also like being able to read
I like being able to hear and understand
I'd watch so many more dubs if they had captions
I've heard oh so wonderful things about it
<:15min:796607937291878431>
But in general it is a really good dub
fair
🤔
Yep
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
It's probably my favourite shounen anime
that abbreviation..
bear in mind JJK is currently airing
why don't you watch the first episode of each and decide from there <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
It was a completely different market to what it is now

groovin' magic is a certified banger
👌
ok but the diebuster op
that works too
I'm pretty sure it's on youtube lol
no, Gunbuster was Anno's directorial debut
or was that the mayonnaise film
iirc Anno's directorial debut?
```In the very near future, a race of huge, insect like aliens is discovered traveling the galaxy. These aliens seem dedicated to the eradication of the human species as it takes its first steps away from the solar system, and they are getting closer and closer to Earth. Humanity has responded by developing spacegoing battleships and giant fighting robots. These robots are piloted by the best and brightest of Earth`s youth, picked from training schools around the world.```
robot
i see
ah
I thought the general consensus was that gunbuster was the better one <:HibikiThonk:805183257280512000>
that's what I've heard
Diebuster is on amazon prime 🤔
6 episode OVAs
uh huh

the OVA got released on DVD here in the early 2000s iirc
part 1 is oos <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
next time the UK BD comes into stock at CeX i'm gonna buy it
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

it got a BD release in the UK
does anyone hold the US licence?
I was going to buy it but they sold out of the CE <:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
it was originally a game iirc
Makes sense
Yeah
robots mainly
<:15min:796607937291878431>

so good luck
Manga Entertainment apparently hold the license
I've heard it's ok
Yes
Entertaining though
Twintail was weird.
I've heard that one's pretty controversial lol
does the OP count as filler? <:blobkek:714875048556757082>

the movie is my second favourite anime movie of all time lol

the movie is so good
the movie is where it's at imo

subjective <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
<:thonking:769919575957045278>
there's plenty of reasons to dislike k-on, but I don't think the animation is one of them lol

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
the art is super cool, got an artbook that came with the Bluray
Kill la Kill is very good
if you have a free 3 years :P
I think I've heard the opening before..
yes
heard good things about that <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
she already said she wanted to watch that because of <a:ShirabeBonk:801207951645605958>
every slice of life anime when it ends <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
well Gundam has lots of death and she doesn't want to watch that <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
something comfy or something more action oreintated?
what do you want to watch?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Symphogear
it is not
no
it's an absolutely beautiful show
a group of high school girls make anime
awesome show
oh yeah never going to not recommend Eizouken
🤔
<:HibikiThonk:805183257280512000>

<:15min:796607937291878431>
ok but <#371105434771390465>
oh it's that one
(even tho comfy camping anime best anime)
I think we are missing the genre she wants to watch :P
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
watch laid back camp
anyway
how r u not dead
🤔
how does one smell gay
I was planning to watching it soon too <:15min:796607937291878431>
it's alright <:tutturu:464457018921713665>
oh okay

K-On <:15min:796607937291878431>
what's the point of an OP if it's not fucky <:15min:796607937291878431>
I've heard good things about ID:Invaded but my order of the blu-ray got canceled <a:angerawoo:801474520070225980>
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
<:15min:796607937291878431>
why are you commenting on it
then..
no
<:15min:796607937291878431>
tbf saying stuff is trash without backing it up is not very convincing
<:15min:796607937291878431>
ID Invaded? What's that? <:troll:256442023760887809>
and the characters are great
they follow the same structure, but I found that they changed up enough that I still enjoyed it
well
yes
I disagree but I can see where you're coming from
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
the show is very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-91y7BJ8QA
lol ye
it's wholesome

or just skip the robots and watch laid back camp
or just watch 00 and skip the 3 hours <:15min:796607937291878431>
<:clownoftheyear:796610301734420530>

wtf happens in ID:Invaded Episode 9

<:15min:796607937291878431>
that's Yuri on Ice
no wait
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
<:HiCHelp:793493771920736266>
will try and watch the last 5 episodes later today
the ending gets me every time <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
at least the ||gundam vs gundam|| battle at the end was cool
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
kiss x sis <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
maquia was pretty good
<:15min:796607937291878431>
when it gets an English blu-ray then maybe
<:15min:796607937291878431>
my favourite is that too, I just think A Silent Voice is a better film
that ||hotel|| product placement lmao
oh pancreas
a silent voice is probably the best one too imo
which is fair
huh, I gave Pancreas an 8
I can't say I remember Pancreas' OST, but I can remember Weathering with You, Your Name and A Silent Voices OSTs fondly
🤔
I think it's an okay movie with a couple good scenes and a couple awful scenes
no
just like the movie then <:15min:819144144098295818>
it doesn't fit, but it's a good song imo
<:honk:641038061148307456>
good song
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
true
looks cool though <:tutturu:464457018921713665> (00 EP22)
wtf ||the robot has just got a power up||
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
also, ||the old man has been sleeping for like 200 years wtf||
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>

haven't heard of it <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
oh
what's the english title?
my favourite film is probably the K-On movie or Promare <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
<:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
ok then don't
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
I need to go back and finish IBO

<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
<:pikawoah:763160949410365440>
gotta cash in on that mobile game gacha codes they hand out with blu-rays <:tutturu:464457018921713665>
<:clownoftheyear:796610301734420530>
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
do I watch the last 3 episodes now or do I save them for the evening <:thonking:769919575957045278>
<:15min:796607937291878431>
Probably the original
I'll have to see what gundam to watch next though
Can't take more gundam right now <:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
I want to start S2 but I've got other anime to watch first
<:CryChat:753702930091343902>
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
00 ||the scene of the death of the other bridge crew members was so sad, they had just discovered they loved each other|| 😔
yeah
Crunchyroll only had the sub and my Bluray player broke <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Also because I watched half the show dubbed lol
oh yeah
who did she voice again?
Gundam 00 had cute girls ||pity most of them didn't make it to the end||
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
they already got cute boys, could definitely do with cute girls <:tutturu:464457018921713665>
who needs robots when you have IDOLS
I thought they sent the same meme twice..
Yes
<:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
I've got a couple of friends that are really into it
I've watched the first episode
it is
I have the CE <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
<:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
Revue Starlight and Uma Musume next for me probably though
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
I don't trust mecha shows and being light-hearted
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
After a few more light-hearted shows lol
I'll do that then
<:pikawoah:763160949410365440>
it's almost like it's based off of shibuya
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Japan wtf
That's an awesome model
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
I never noticed the cables in the first one <:harold:796610426225164299>
15th anniversary of 00 is Oct 2022.. <:harold:796610426225164299>
🤔
oh I see
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
I thought it already had films..
oh
Where do they fall in the watch order?
oh yeah, 00 has movies
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
wdym?
<a:worryogawa:702380436923482143>
<:15min:819144144098295818>
they should just simulcast it worldwide <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it's never a bad thing to have a wider audience
Netflix jail sure sucks for anime when it's airing, but it allows much more people to watch it once it is uploaded
Here it still says the discs are ETA: TBC <:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
While the US release is just getting new discs
It delayed the UK release though <:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
Sunrise gave Nozomi the wrong masters for the Blu-ray iirc <:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
<:pikawoah:763160949410365440>
Did it ever come out lol
What happened with that SEED Blu-ray release in the US?
<:HibikiThonk:805183257280512000>
aw darn I can't click on these
<a:kanadedontfeelgood:706544690635472939>
if you want high school fights, Kill la Kill 👌
What part of Revue Starlight?
🤔
same with Laid Back Camp
but it is very comfy
there's not really much action in k-on lol <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
they take place in a school and have singing <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Maria's VA voices Mio in K-On
that too
wholesome
cute
good music
tbf
K-On is great
the bigger problem is that it's mecha and you don't like that <:15min:819144144098295818>
Macross Delta <:15min:819144144098295818>
Kill la Kill will always get a recommendation from me though
if you want high school singing, idk, k-on lol
it streams on All4
it's cheaper than Amazon and you don't get hit with delivery fees lol
so like 8000JPY in total
https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Nendoroid-spider-Pre-painted-Action-Figure/dp/B08VNW69L1 <@!237964037898502144>
£13.50 handling fee though <:uhmeow:630817733310677022>
yeah
well you do, just not the handling fee
Amazon Japan is useful for europeans as you don't get hit with import fees
it is
try amazon japan
<@!237964037898502144> if you want it get it straight from japan
ParcelFarse is just notoriously shit
RM is fine and is the normal post service
I just stick to Amazon for importing as they deal with fees <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
yeah
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432> It's not meant to be lol
SAL/Air Packet is Royal Mail
EMS is always ParcelForce
ah yeah it's ems so £13.50 + 20%
and through goodsmile you don't have to pay RM/ParcelForce's handling fee
yeah
I think they do but it's pretty dear
<:tutturu:464457018921713665>
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
<:pikawoah:763160949410365440>
do you not have a debit card?
because PayPal is shit <:15min:796607937291878431>
ah ic
Can you not just use a u?
ah, Amazon use DHL which is faster than UK prime for me <a:chubbun:691026016331628645>
what shipping do they use?
<:pikawoah:763160949410365440>
yes
idk how goodsmile take it
on Amazon JP you don't get charged until the item ships
use Amazon <:15min:796607937291878431>
<:catbrain:810506390723756073>
lmao wth
(which is now £0 👁️👄👁️)
Because I've only bought like 1 thing over the limit
I've managed to doge import tax thus far lol
<:clownoftheyear:796610301734420530>
<:15min:819144144098295818>
I don't mind paying fees, I just mind paying the extortionate handling fee lol
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
1p item gets £8.002 import fees <a:chubbun:691026016331628645>
But none for actual sales
we still have a £39 gift limit
<:15min:819144144098295818>
the best way is to just buy knockoffs on aliexpress that are marked as 1¢ gifts according to customs <:tutturu:464457018921713665>
yeah I can believe that
this means the item is kept in an amazon warehouse afaik
<:15min:796607937291878431>
amazon are selling stuff themselves though
but it's expensive to do for the company
I'd totally move away from using amazon if other companies pre-paid import fees
> place order with pre-order
> get charged less for shipping for item that gets immediately dispatched
> cancel preorder
> pay less for shipping
<:CatBrain:819135062662447135>
ye
but it's not a flat fee
shipping does get cheaper on Amazon if you bulk buy too <:portdoll:796600541874487326>
but then you hit £135 and new funky tax laws come into force <a:parrot:413739441392320534>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
£13.50 handling fees though
sounds like parcelfarse
<:CatBrain:819135062662447135>
my condolences
last week's broadcast was delayed
3 i think

https://twitter.com/FUNimation/status/1371479060925317127
CR just announced they have the license today
yes
https://twitter.com/DemonSlayerUSA/status/1371838848276254724
Have you tried the starlight gacha game? <a:chubbun:691026016331628645>
and most of the series that were dubbed by them have been relicensed
4kids went bankrupt years ago
yeah
damn I was the opposite
no it comes out in june
<:YeahTrue:817929819156906014>
Yui was the vocalist
and MVM have lost the UK license recently
yeye
I think NIS America's Love Live license has ended
ye it'll be licenses expiring
<:Harold1:730699878098796607>
I've got friends that'll be watching it, so I'm really only watching it to discuss with them
<:Harold2:730700348850700350>
I'll probably watch TWEWY and MHA S5, will have to take out a funimation subscription tho
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
can't you read it for free on the Shounen Jump app lol
(a few of) the Symphogear girls appeared in the Revue mobile game a month or so ago
yeah
~~but revue is very average imo <a:chubbun:691026016331628645> ~~
but like, they both sing
technically
it's theatre, not idol
Yes
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
https://twitter.com/AnimeMaru/status/1373786510999314433?s=19
It's probably a risk the licensors don't want to take
yeah
ye totally
ye it's probably a copyright thing then
oh
Not a JoJo fan so wasn't aware names were changed
Perhaps
but same with Blu-rays and the like, French, Germans and Italians get a lot
Germany gets a lot too
ye the French market is huge for manga and anime
It's still more expensive than ROW tbf
Ye
Like 14$ for a volume
US manga is kinda expensive
not everything needs a specific reason to get popular
because people enjoyed it <:oh:784318399945769010>
ok then don't <:whatthe:784318400117342238>
it's like a week or something
but it's worth it
Also it has quite a slow start
It's more science fiction though lol
<:tutturu:464457018921713665>
it's pretty good
isn't that mecha <:hyperharold:730701588884357182>
https://anilist.co/anime/20623
that's.. action
Parasyte?
There is a second one <a:KirikaTwirl:752996271702147162>
either that or Noragami
Probably my favourite shounen..
It's pretty good
Assasination Classroom?
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
if you're looking for action then not K-On
but k-on 👁️👄👁️
what genre?
dude it's just a joke lmao
although, will Funimation's service work when I want to watch it? <:xdd:815041848896520222>
The World Ends With You Hype <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>

fine, discord <:Chrisgun:797735324213444619>
> I watched the first episode of Revue Starlight
My condolences :KEKW:
so I'd probably prefer it to go to them for cinemas <:dogekek:784318399634341929>
at least here in the UK, Funimation have much wider theatrical windows than Crunchyroll
tbf Covid
<:patpat:810926458096713799>
but then again, sony currently wants to buy Crunchyroll <:dogekek:784318399634341929>
Funimation have the home video rights though, so I think they'd probably get the theatrical for the film
the Black Clover film?
in cinemas \<:15min:819144144098295818>
it's just a delay between the studio and funimation/their translators
the episode is done and broadcasted afaik

<:PaimonThink:826016328150155325>
I didn't notice any problems with the official subs <:xdd:815041848896520222>
all I remember about HF2 was that the credits song was good
<:saitothink:608785048539365376>
Oh
It has official subs
<:Harold1:730699878098796607>
but then they don't pre pay import fees <:uhmeow:630817733310677022>

I was going to watch it on wakanim
fwiw I will tomorrow <:dogekek:784318399634341929>

ah <:Harold1:730699878098796607>
is that HF2?
<:Harold1:730699878098796607>
just go now and if they're bad just stop watching
<:Harold1:730699878098796607>
although it's £1.50 cheaper than Crunchyroll, who's servers run off Pentium 4s instead of Pentium 3s
🤖
Pentium 3 machines
probably more storage than funimations servers <:KEKW:778543891372703754>

they have Wakanim for the rest of Europe

well yeah, they're focused on the US, CA, UK and Ireland
the CR site is orders of magnitude better

they should just replace the Funimation website with the CR one if they do buy CR
🤷 We'll just have to wait and see
plus they're trying to buy Crunchyroll 🥴
true
<:chrizz22WhyChat:768084074715545610> goodbye
Sony now owns you, and will re-brand you to FunimationZero.
Inter-Sony Licensing is weird
Funimation own Wakanim, Madman Entertainment and Funimation UK (Manga Entertainment) 🥴
<:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
wait, Funimation are owned by Sony Music, who also own Aniplex
it's weird
yeah
aniplex own funimation
yes
oh wait same with Samurai Flamenco and Silver Spoon lol
Durarara!! is also good but that's still on Funimation so not much rush
Samurai Flamenco and Silver Spoon are both decent.

The real question is do I go a third time <:thonking:769919575957045278>
Fair, I was just bored
(I say, after going twice in 48 hours <:KEKW:637792566485581824>)
it's a good cinema experience <:worryShrug:830525678130692127>
<:KEKW:637792566485581824>
Everything other than Demon Slayer would be Ghibli
Ah fair

<:thonking:769919575957045278>

I mean, I don't think any 12 year olds are lining up to buy the Fate whatever Blu-ray lol
yeah true
but have since allowed it to be released uncut
they gave Paranoia Agent an 18 and requested the ||child suicide|| scene to be removed in like 2005
BBFC don't like violence that much though 🤔
not like, actual scenes
i mean references
but on the whole sexual content isn't marked that high here
idk i haven't seen the series/ova myself
no
🤷
BBFC said Prilya  has moderate fantasy violence, sex references and nudity and gave it a 12

Crunchyroll and Adult Swim funded it, that's probably why it exists
🧢
I cannot think of anything of note that can came out last year <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
doubt it, it's been nearly 2 months
Belle and Sing a Bit of Harmony
😛
theres 2
<https://www.funimationfilms.com/movie/sing-a-bit-of-harmony/#about>
if you're looking for another anime film to see Sing a Bit of Harmony is also in cinemas in the US right now, it's very good 🤌
I can't actually look at the website as it redirects me to the UK one as soon as I load it 😔
both i think
wdym?
https://www.bellefilm.com/ just aggrigates all the tickets from the platforms and cinemas
however I have seen that the dub is very good so i'll probably see both lol
ah i'm going to see that in 2 weeks when it comes out in the UK
(what film btw?)
worst that can happen is that you can ask someone to restart it in the correct format
no
fwiw most platforms make it easy to see
6 and 2 3s really
when I went to see Demon Slayer: Mugen Train (the first time) they accidentally played the dub instead of the sub so someone went and told someone who worked at the cinema and they restarted it in the sub
very little if they're paying attention
the dub sounds v good imo
i saw it subbed in october and am going on friday to see it subbed again but i'll probably go see the dub on the monday or tuesday
ah i see
did you see it dubbed or subbed?
yeah they were all decent
who was best character fig
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
goodness knows what
it's also just in US not AU or UK so
but it's better than nothing
innit
although demon slayer on the biggest screen in the cinema was nice
i have to travel far for either, lol
no, funimation <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
guess it's because it's not a francise film or one from a big director
but then again Sony are kinda big
GKIDS are well known for being a good theatrical distributor
eleven arts are a lot smaller tbf
they're not restricting it to that here
idk why Funimation are doing only a 3 day release in the states
F, it's apparently the better film <:FujitakaSalute:688199574917087256>
sure i guess
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> the urge to travel 5 hours to the nearest IMAX screen to see Belle

bcs compressed trees are for nerds
the real w is to only watch anime original shows <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
they probably sell more merch than nationalist millitary shows

yes
can't say i know who corpse husband is but glad it's getting a dub xd
i think i watched the first episode of that and it was ok
absoloutley
it wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as the rest
yeah
yeah, i'd tend to agree
but ||muchiro deserved better||
my favourite fight in the final arc was the one against ||upper rank 1, or maybe azaka||
yeah
||doma good looking too 🛐||
that was a good fight
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it'll probably be 26 episodes like S1, which adapted 60 or so chapters
heck even the entertainment district arc is only like 30 chapters long
it's like 70 chapters whereas mugen train was like 20
😬 as much as i liked mugen train, that would be too short
mm yeah
gosh that'll be beautiful to see animated
yeah
||the hashira training arc doesn't warrant it's own series imo||
that'd make sense
hope it doesn't take them 6 years to adapt it though
next arc is cool, i like the hashira
alas 11 v good ones
yeah it was only 11 episodes
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
next week's episode is 45 minutes long

eizouken good
have you heard of symphogear
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I didn't read that
it was 2000
Cardcaptor Sakura good
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it's ok
idk what I watched it was much worse
500 days watched 🥴
damn more anime to avoid
a place further than the universe in English
cute cats doing cute things
I'm not joking
star made me
all anime is bad
so unfunny? 😌
let me finish <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
which has an anime
mobile game
I guess
it's fun
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
watch Uma musume
I heard it was great when it screened at the anime festival in Edinburgh
let's not
You tell me you don't take baths with your clothes on? 🤨
anime directors justifying why the 14 year old needs to be naked
https://c.tenor.com/cnpZYdQA_pYAAAAM/explaining.gif
also 5x the price
It's still anime
why wouldn't that be eligible though
it was also a vote
to nobody's surprise
it was AoT
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
not liking a show = hater
the content in it might have made them not
pretty much a popularity contest anyway innit
they're popular so it makes sense
it actually won something
oddtaxi tho <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
tbh
not surprising
the real W is the dub performance - it was the guy that said "bitches, bros and non-binary hoes" <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
"most overworked staff"
aoty 1999
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I voted for *Belle* in that list, but Mugen Train was much more enjoyable than Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0
Mugen Train was better though <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
don't want to give bezos traffic
they maybe limited it to what you can stream on their website
politics is when women 😠
<:MikuShock:690470896154050620>

it's good fun
lol
Nah some got announced
Gacha? BDs?

figure probably
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it's anime therefore a mistake

You can also apparently download videos on the crunchyroll app on switch which is neat I guess
It's had Funimation for a year or so now
~~you could already watch twintail on the Funimation app too~~
but why would you want to <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
surprised it's been this long
10/10
Yes can confirm it plays anime
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
One redeeming factor
It plays anime so I wouldn’t call it a good app 😛
It’s like..fine
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Instead I spend too much on stupid discs I never watch
I do as well, I just don't read manga
yeah
?
much cheaper than Japan lmao
eh, the prices are ok for a collectors item really
They don't really do them anymore
Some people prefer combo packs
that's not bad practice
but not enough
it is arguably better than nothing
people point at 4kids dubs and go like "damn dubs are bad"
most dubs these days are fine tbh
this season there was a lot of stuff on both platforms as well, but that may just be coincidence
over time i'd be surprisied if that doesn't happen
let people enjoy anime unless it's symphogear <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>

same with Promare, that looked nice I guess
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Belle's virtual world was made with CGI and that looked stunning
yeah CGI can be alright

Yes
LiSA 🛐
I voted for it <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

It was probably my favourite
ah
What ED even won? The mugen train arc one?
I don't like either 😌

Licensing is strange
It’s weird to region lock dubs that you own like that lol but companies gonna company
It’s mainly because of Canada and more specifically Quebec
It probably doesn't exist, a lot of these older VHS tapes were dub only
it's just a warning
no it is

Wonder if it will be better than the first. I don’t hold much hope.
also maybe because sentai got bought recently and don't want their titles on a different platform anymore
If you can, watch them. All of them are fantastic.
sk8, eizouken and I can't name a third I watched that wasn't a sequel
um
<:TomosatoStare:688429724233629772>

you do get weekly sometimes
No

or if I had been say, in a cinema
I feel like if they were dubbed I'd have had an easier time watching them but I found them difficult to sit through
but they're all 2.5 hours long
better than watching the series no doubt

I could not care less
it is all subjective
there is no objectively better period of cartoon
no
it's a sin after all
pay you to take anime
or
they should just send everything for free
could send it USPS for like a tenner 😔
they only use fedex though
innit

There is a female protagonist who is not transgender

Just watch the anime

<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
if they had taste they wouldnt be collecting dead tree
use book depository (amazon), free intl shipping
it did anyway

yeah
It's shinkai, it'll be the same movie as the last two ones <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>

<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
why
simulcast = currently airing shows
most simulcast subs are just straight rips of the CR stuff so you get the same subtitles
I've seen worse
eh it's just okay
But I love all of Yuasa's other works
I've never actually seen past the start of the Tatami Galaxy lol
They probably will
I'll have to check that out
yay!
they're split up there too, it's just different companies that get different stuff
Mainly SE Asia if I remember correctly
It's on Netflix in some regions
https://c.tenor.com/cnQVg5ECAG4AAAAM/supa-hot-fire-end-this-mans-whole-career.gif
I tried and can't keep up with the subtitles
woe
Yeah it doesn't look like it
😔
Does it have a dub?
Actually
I've been meaning to
😔

no but it's very decent
I love gay people
they didn't kiss so it wasn't wrapped up <:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
no doubt it'll be forgotten about the second autumn shows start <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
it's currently airing so it's something to speak about
other than that it was excellent though

I've often been in a cinema by myself
there's really not always, it only tends to be the popular stuff
stuff like Jujutsu Kaisen 0 did sell out, but that's only once in a blue moon
mm the rebuild of eva
🤨
I'm seeing it in cinemas  October so will report if it is more or less confusing than at home
https://gkids.com/EVANGELION/ Eva 3.0+1.01 coming to cinemas in the US in December
robot/10, they fought
it has the hot wolf
I frequently talk about BNA 😤
🤨🤨
to impress another man??
why are you piloting a robot
robots r gay anyway
I actually cannot remember that
story
like they're all connected I think but not in a way that affects storu
not anything important
and yes but not really
it wasn't 00
no
gundam 00 looks like code Geass, has a good story and has robots <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
the bad is trying to understand the ending and the movies
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
ash have you read it
money
not to be confused with 1.01 <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
omg symphogear eva watch party
need to watch them sometime as I'm seeing 3.0+1.01 in the cinema in a few weeks 👺

Like old people bowling or 10 pin?
bocchi is decent but i wouldn't say it's aoty
<:15min:819144144098295818>

by itself on Amazon Japan with shipping it'd be a hair under £30, or you can buy it from a UK seller on Amazon UK for £35
you can also buy imported CDs on most storefronts like amazon/ebay which may be a better value if you're only getting the one
shipping may be a lot for one CD
there's stores like cdjapan and amazon japan that are pretty good

It's a brilliant game
I beat FE3H like two days after I got it
I wasn't going any further
ok <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
It's just music
It's not a spoiler?
From the final map in the blue lions route in FE3H
