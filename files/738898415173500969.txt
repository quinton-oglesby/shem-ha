Speaking from someone of that age with a crippling hentai addiction to another, I‚Äôm currently trying the following:
Picking up hobbies to not constantly resort to hentai in my spare time
Slowly whittling down my hentai collection, not outright going cold turkey
And setting limits as to how many times I can, *you know* in a week/month, etc.
It‚Äôs tough, but it will be a worthwile habit to break.

I guess that is true. Thanks, I needed that lately.
I know, I've been meaning to do it, I just become overcome by stress relatively easily.
I guess that helps on second thought.
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Fuck. I have never felt more scared.
I start Grade 12 (senior year for the Muricans in the audience) next week, and I feel genuinely afraid. This is going to be the year that decides my future. I feel full of thoughts, and can't get a single solid thought at the moment. I don't want to do this, but I have to do my best.
I want to cry, but I can't feel anything. I want to just scream, shout, anything. I can't stop thinking about this, and my parents aren't helping, having extremely high expectations for my grades.
I honestly feel like I already can't take it, and the year hasn't even started yet.
**FUCK**

I think I have legitimate impostor syndrome. 
I‚Äôve always agonized and beaten myself up over the smallest of mistakes, and have always been incredibly sensitive to even the smallest pieces of constructive criticism.
And honestly, this became apparent when I started writing. As much as I love the craft, I always end up comparing myself to others and feeling downtrodden for a myriad of factors: why don‚Äôt I get as much attention? why don‚Äôt I write as well? Why don‚Äôt I have storytelling that good? Etc. 
It‚Äôs mentally destroyed me in recent, part of the reason why I‚Äôve just kind of stopped writing in recent. I‚Äôve always been jealous of others‚Äô successes, and I‚Äôve been recognizing it, but I just can‚Äôt move past it.
Homes are currently being threatened there.

Sounds like a drug
I think it might be because YT is managed by Google while Facebook is independent
Good to know
I just feel fucking worried as hell about my future again
It‚Äôs only been a month and I still feel like a fraud, like I shouldn‚Äôt be here. I am still freaking out over my post-secondary and work opportunities, and the thoughts are only getting more and more invasive with time.

So more like the Cold War?
Plus
NK is in China‚Äôs back pocket
That doesn‚Äôt help
I feel like if Taiwan ever falls, it‚Äôs gonna be a catalyst for WW3

And only 8 countries have a 15%+ fully vaxxed rate:
Seychelles (72%)
Mauritius (62%)
Morocco (48%)
Tunisia (28%)
Cape Verde (23%)
Comoros (20%)
Eswatini (18%)
Lesotho (15%)
Out of the pledged 1B+ vaccines on behalf of the EU (and the G7), less than 15% have been delivered
https://www.bbc.com/news/56100076
Where are the donated vaccines?
where are they, Justin?
I remember Trudeau saying that he would donate some vaccines to Africans at the start of 'rona

Should have mentioned earlier haha
this is how bad schools are here
https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/covid-cases-in-children-hit-record-high-as-more-schools-see-outbreaks
despite having 20k active cases
we're at 75% fully vaxxed
mainly because a good chunk of it runs through my province
threw a hissy fit when Biden shut down the Keystone XL
but this the same premier who loves to bail out oil barons
My sister was already told of 2 self-reported cases in her class, and none for me yet, but that's just out of the actually reported cases
there are calls for school closures because contact tracing doesn't exist anymore, so parents don't have to report their kids having covid
my province's premier is a piece of shit
He forced the province to open back up for summer so this festival could happen where he made an appearance
now our hospitals are at 180% capacity
I feel for you honestly
ah i see
exactly
what does protesting in NY accomplish when it's about a country across the world

Very well said, Matt.
I agree.
I personally agree with Matt. People writing characters that are ‚Äúlike them‚Äù per se is nice, but educating others on people ‚Äúlike yourself‚Äù to have them get a better idea of what represents your culture seems like a better idea to spread your message.
At least for me, it‚Äôs just an ingrained need to satisfy people, make them appreciate you
I feel like it‚Äôs a problem of trying to make yourself like you‚Äôre worthy of their praise, even though you don‚Äôt know what it takes to make them appreciate you

I'd say that what she is doing is more crazy insensitive than outright causing harm, but those are just my two cents.
iirc she was teaching SOHCAHTOA, an acronym regarding the calculation of values in angles using the Pythagorean theorem, but this was a purely horribly way to go about doing it.
this teacher really thought that doing this was a good idea
Eeeyupppp
It sucks, but stupid people will continue to invest in this shit

Oh ffs

First of all, you fell for clickbait. 
There are no quotes from the director in the article, just the author giving out his two cents on the show‚Äôs underlying concept. Not even that, it‚Äôs him viewing communism through the lens of how the USSR tackled it, rather than the concept in theory. 
This sort of clickbait was only a matter of time, tbh.
Yeah honestly
Airsoft would be a far safer approach to this
Oh christ
could not agree more. Very well said.
ikr
very stupid way to go about it.
anyways I feel I've contributed as much as I can to this discussion while staying relevant to the topic at hand, so I'm gonna be leavin now, cya guys
i guess the closest thing I've had to that was my junior high (named after a former mayor of my city) had to get its name changed last year because mayor in question had alleged ties to the KKK during his time in office (1960s)
true ig
Schools here tend to be quite diverse, although there is usually a given majority in a given school
I don't remember such a thing happening in my area, even though I live in a p right wing province (Canadian)
That, I see as being more likely. She isn't directly causing it, but it portrays said stereotypes in a positive light.
fair. I respect your opinion.

In prisons, white torture is when someone is locked in a room, without windows, with white walls, white doors, white everything. The prisoner is put into all white clothing, and they eat with white utensils and mainly only eat rice out of white bowls.
The process will often drive people insane

I don‚Äôt really know where I lie politically, ig I‚Äôve been questioning where I lie a lot in recent
I honestly can't find a single political Twitch streamer I can stand.
that's why I've been trying to distance myself but it's a fkn addiction
I hate internet politics
Twitch politics is somehow even more of a cesspool than YT politics

and iirc that was on H3H3?

YouTube politics is another level of stupid
Shit‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been trying to drop out of politics
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I feel that. I remember when my grandfather tried to enlighten me with the words of Dennis Prager
I think for me, I can‚Äôt take him seriously because I burst into laughter when I hear his voice and get reminded of the myriad of memes about him
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QA6GAdkN09s
YT drama died out with Leafy and iDubbbz in 2016
Honestly, this was only a matter of time
I would support that, honestly.
I had no comeback
That guy fucking wrecked me
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
back when I used to be active on political servers, the KR pfp argument happened when they claimed my opinion was moot cuz I had a pfp of "a knockoff Fortnite skin" (PS: I had Build as my pfp then)
I feel that, someone pulled that card on me because I had a Kamen Rider pfp
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
It's like the Twitter practice of shutting down someone's argument solely because they have an anime pfp
^
ig that's true
I think, imho, it‚Äôs a moderation issue. There‚Äôs only 1-2 mods on at a time, max. I‚Äôm not sure if Melua or Lily can peacekeep and moderate efficiently when there‚Äôs 2 of them and 3000 users.
I leave for one hour
What happened here
https://www.ifj.org
Has had representative journalists at the UN since 1953
Officially affiliated with UNESCO

They were founded in 1926
Same here, but here‚Äôs what I found:
The International Federation of Journalists, a group representing 600K journalists worldwide, took a space in today‚Äôs edition of The Times with this ad

It‚Äôs not much, and it‚Äôs not all that great, but thanks
I get that
I‚Äôve felt that as well recently. My parents have put tremendous academic pressure on me for this year.
<@!551256807041925148> 
Ig the main reason I started writing is because I have autism, and because of that, it‚Äôs hard for me to have motivation and creativity. My teachers growing up always said I‚Äôd struggle with writing, and I wanted to challenge that notion.
I‚Äôm currently trying, but it‚Äôs quite hard.
here we go.

<@!278860841485598720> No dice. The photos were only on my phone, my family didn't see the value in getting more than 5GB of iCloud storage, and now the phone is reset and back in the hands of my ISP.
I have never frustratedly cried before. Until today, that is. I got a new phone, and was supposed to transfer my data from my old phone. I misheard the ISP service guy and accidentally erased all my data from my old phone.
That was 6 fucking years of my life gone, all because I made a dumb fucking mistake when I could have just asked for help. Some of the data included last photos of dead relatives and pets, and hell, my final text conversations with my grandfather. I feel like an utter idiot, for having thrown my life down the toilet in just one fell swoop.

I did not know Gwyn well, nor did i talk with her often, but I find it hard to believe that she is gone. My sincerest condolences.

imma honestly vent real quick
I feel like I've just had a fucking realization in life
i want to entertain. I want to make people smile. I want to make people laugh, cry, get hyped. I want to serve as an impact on people's lives, even if most entertainers wind up as nothing more than fads, products of their time. My parents want me to work for the government because I can somewhat speak French, but I can't. I can barely hold up a conversation and even then, I have a horribly pronounced stutter. On top of that, I don't want to work a job like that. I feel like doing a government job (i.e. a page, someone who basically serves as an assistant to the politicians in Ottawa, I'm Canadian btw) would be genuinely soul sucking, it would have me leave no sort of legacy in life. I would just blend into the background, an extra in someone else's movie, an NPC in someone else's game. I will die a forgotten man who just does nothing. My routine has largely been the same thing since I started senior year (high school). Get up, go through school, sulk my way back home, have a panic attack over school, watch TV/anime/play video games to fill the depressive void, go to sleep, wash, rinse, motherfucking repeat. I want to become an actor, an entertainer, ANYONE of that sort honestly, I want to serve a role where I can impact on others' lives, but I'm too afraid of failure to do it. I'm afraid of just falling back on the gov't job because it's cushy and it's a union job with good pay. I'm going to die as a middle-class man who never contributed much to society in the grand scheme of things, I will become the Average Joe I've always feared of becoming. I almost feel like this is more coming from a need for (positive) attention I had in my childhood (and teenage years), but I just want to be remembered as someone who made an impact. I hate living, but I'm too scared to die over the fact that I'll leave nothing of note behind whatsoever. I'll always live in my family's shadows.
Unironically yes.
Context: Quebec just passed a very controversial bill (dubbed ‚ÄúBill 96‚Äù) that aims to ‚Äúprotect the French language‚Äù
This involves heavily restricting the use of English in federal settings (for the non-Canadians here, English and French are our two official languages), but the biggest change is in billingual colleges, putting a hard cap on the number of non-Francophone students (students who don‚Äôt have French as their first language), and dramatically increasing the number of French-only courses that students **must** take in order to get a degree.
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-96-vote-law-1.6463965
There's something heavy I just need to get off my chest. (TW: Self-harm)
||I found out today while I was hanging out with my younger sister (she's 16 btw), she just casually brought up out of the blue that she's been cutting herself. I feel just distressed and that I have nowhere else to turn, really. The reason why, I won't explain much here, as I don't want to breach into venting territory outside of DMs, so if you want to know more, I guess just shoot me a DM. My sister and I have an emotionally abusive mother, who's always had supremely high expectations of us as her kids. My dad wants to help, but can't as he's afraid that sticking up to her will endanger his marriage. I always saw her as a chilled out person who got out her frustrations in drawing, and watching anime. I never thought I would see her doing things like this. I just love her too much, and I don't want to see her do things like this. I'm afraid she's going to wind up hospitalized over this soon, and I just don't know what to do.||
I don't really know where else to put this, but a good friend of mine is struggling financially and could really use the help.

I‚Äôve watched City Hunter recently, Sunrise made killer shit during the 70s and 80s
From what I‚Äôve seen, it looks alright. The early Sunrise style actually isn‚Äôt bad, I kind of like it
Either that or Iron Blooded Orphans
<@!213645184125239317> <@87512939107450880> planning on ‚Äò79
Anything I should know before actually starting?
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Finally gonna start Gundam tonight
Yessirrrr
And funny enough, I was introduced to it through Jump Force of all things
I always found it hard for me to get into Tensei Slime honestly
I get the hype, but power fantasy isekai stuff just isn‚Äôt my forte
I can‚Äôt get invested if them and their cronies keep getting more and more OP
I think for me, is that Rimuru was OP from square one, having full resistance to fire and ice, and having the Predator ability.
But tbf
I haven‚Äôt seen Precure in a long time
StarTwi‚Äôs an anniversary season???
I thought it was Hugtto cuz All Star Memories
I‚Äôve heard a lot of controversy abt it
<@457268466429329429>
Hugtto‚Äôs biggest problem is that it‚Äôs meant to be an anniversary season, but only really brings the anniversary aspect in 2 episodes of the entire series
Apparently the ending was also very shoddy
And lastly, there is an infamous episode where one of the characters performs a C-Section on a woman, of which C-Sections are highly frowned upon in Japan.
Smile I get the dislike for. However, I personally like it
For me, Fresh was hampered hard by the mascots.
Setsuna was the only really redeeming part of the show
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608> understood
~~I guess that‚Äôs true~~
Yes, it‚Äôs like clockwork
Toku (esp) Sentai also has that complaint
Honestly I do agree
I personally dislike Max Heart more than Y5GG because it‚Äôs so boring
I burned through it in 3 days just so I could be done
Green Cures are always great
Sadge
But for me
I‚Äôm like one of the few people who unironically likes KiraKira
I‚Äôve also heard mixed opinions
Mainly about Lala as a character
Which would be the worst Precure season period?
I think for me I‚Äôm not a huge fan of baby mascots
I guess I‚Äôll go in to watching it with an open mind then lol
Toei‚Äôs often weird on classification
Hugtto is first
Yeah
But canonically?
Technically yes
There‚Äôs a prior season with a debatable male Cure
> suicide
*huh*
I‚Äôd also say Precure in general
I remember Smile dealing with some issues in that sort (my personal fav season)
And Tropical Rouge hasn‚Äôt really gripped me at this time
I didn‚Äôt watch Healin‚Äô Good cuz it simply didn‚Äôt interest me
Despite Aoi Yuki playing Nodoka being the reason I first got into Precure
those last 3 minutes fucking wrecked me
srsly
the end of episode 10
gonna rewatch Violet Evergarden soon cuz the movie is finally coming out
time to cry like a baby again
I heard the ending is really fucking depressing (no spoilers, it‚Äôs still on my watchlist)
I still need to watch Clannad
For me, my first show was Violet Evergarden. As much as I love Chuunibyou, Violet holds a special place in my heart.
Actually fantastic series. The first season is a masterpiece. The second slightly less so, but still a solid A-S tier
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It‚Äôs Funi
What do you expect
goddamn everytime I watch that show it makes me unconsolable
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
listened to the Violet Evergarden ED and promptly burst into tears
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
probably gonna rewatch some Precure soon
I guess I haven‚Äôt seen much dark magical girl stuff so I‚Äôm not sure
Looks interesting atm
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Oh yeah and I‚Äôm considering watching Yuuki Yuna
For me, my personal favorite season is Smile. It‚Äôs not really action packed, but it‚Äôs a hella comfy season
hands down
Violet Evergarden.
for actual series?
yeah
For me, that title belongs to Weathering With You/Tenki no Ko
how do we know they will get challenged
like
tried watching Tensei Slime, just didn't like it because Rimuru had such a broken ability from episode 1
not really my thing
I tried getting into Isekai
and of course I am a massive JoJo shill
Fairy Tail holds a special place in my heart (first series I watched) and HxH is a masterpiece in my eyes
Though I'm not gonna lie, I am a Shonen fan
I just tend to like "comfier" series (mainly SoL)
I get the hype, but it just wasn't for me
Madoka was "alright" for me honestly
That's why I'd say I'd LOVE YuYuYu if it was just an SoL series
The whole puppet show at the beginning is so cute
For me, at least. It feels like the characters bond well with each other. It gives a sense of companionship that Madoka never gave us, at least on episode 1
which is what you need to do well in the ratings
And while yeah, it's a melting pot of idol, mecha and toku tropes, it's ***unique***
Symphogear, as wild as it is and as many problems and nitpicks I have, is better because it's a completely unique series that sets itself apart.
Not really a huge fan. 
Characters are alright and the SoL elements are cute as all hell, but the fight scenes and villains just feel like something ripped out of Madoka. 
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a solid 6/10. Fine concept, hampered by its similarities to Madoka, it feels like the show can‚Äôt really get a way across to make it unique and stand out.
First YuYuYu ep down
Though I see myself watching the Komi-san anime
the last anime I legit remember finishing that wasn't a rewatch would be Senko-san (Summer 2020)
I started like 3 times and dropped every time
both 2001 and 2019
I could never get into Fruits Basket
the ED still makes me cry whenever I hear it
That‚Äôs why i feel like Shounen anime get a bit more leeway as at least they try to challenge the MC
^
Yeah, it‚Äôs mainly power scaling. It especially sucks when a character is already broken from square one: Like in Tensei Slime, the MC already has complete elemental resistance and (technically) a way to exponentially increase their power IN THE FIRST EPISODE ALONE
Got an anime adaptation in 2007 by kyoani
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clannad_(video_game)#Anime_series
1 was aired, and then got delayed. You got it spot on
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
||And it seems like a red herring at first when she's told to just forget about him, which only reinforces her arc.||
And of course, ||Gilbert||
the character of ||Yuris|| was amazing well put together
definitely
and yeah it's slow at first
the last hour hit me like a truck
but seriously
this movie is gut wrenching
its plotline comes in for a reference, but not much else
cuz you need the context
uh
have you seen the whole series, including the OVAs?
||I knew as soon as it was revealed that the girl at the beginning is the granddaughter of the little girl from ep 10 that this was gonna be great||
just watched the Violet Evergarden Movie.
I do not exaggerate when I say that this film is nothing short of a masterpiece.
Fansubs it is
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
I‚Äôm interested, but it feels intimidating
I honestly tried to get into mecha multiple times, and I just couldn‚Äôt get into it. Even though I‚Äôm a huge toku and Geah nut, mecha shows I‚Äôve heard of just seem to be way too complicated and convoluted for my liking.
They made AoT and Vinland Saga, so already one hell of a resume
Honestly, I see Wit carrying this show
~~That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm always iffy about Satelight~~
lemme hunt down my old MAL
blocked
> Jojo at 5.5
you watched all 3 Overlord seasons and all of them you rated lower than JoJo, finish the series dumdum <@!278860841485598720>
ah
ight
what's your MAL
Or when Heaven's Door only worked when someone looked at Pink Dark Boy's pages
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
an arc
that was
oh yeah, the monkey
oh yeah that lol
and how Jotaro could breathe underwater by talking through Star Platinum?
or in Part 3, with Star Finger?
remember Diver Down?
Araki always kind of had those issues tbf
oh nice
you're the one who brought it up
read the manga and watched the anime
never did
Gold Experience can't reflect damage
There is no main Stand in Part 5 that can do that ability
ah
not by me yet
why didnt you like it?
sry
ohhh
WATCH PART 5
yet
yeah its honestly more a 6 in my book

Part 1/2: 8
Part 3: 7
Part 4: 9
Part 5: 10 <@!136957645008404480>
He made ||a LEGO White House|| badass. (Part 8 spoilers)
Mine would be Sticky Fingers. Such a cool ability.
<:Mumei_Cry:902549978231242782>
I'm thinking abt the crazy depressing scene from the Part 3 OVA where right after N'Doul dies, and Jotaro buries his corpse, he reminisces, believing that they could have been comrades in another life.
remember when even the sun could deflect it?
oh yeah
Who‚Äôs saying this?
The Weathering soundtrack always makes me cry
WAIT THAT CAME OUT WRONG
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
why couldn't rich people breed us to be profitable humans rather than just breed us
The plot always has to be fucking incomprehensible
This is a Shinkai movie
<:Mumei_Cry:902549978231242782>
So what got leaked today is the December-February schedule
iirc it‚Äôs releasing it in batches of 3-4 eps every month
Same can be said for any anime. I‚Äôve read the manga as well, but I love DP‚Äôs work on the anime
The kid refused to leak the actual eps in fear for his dad‚Äôs job
So I‚Äôll take what i can get
Not yet, but details have been hella secretive
https://youtu.be/YXHLLftNvxg
And he gave some details to JoJo youtuber Shuckmeister
He revealed the episode titles and thumbnails
A kid whose dad works at Netflix has access to the first 12 episodes
So uh
The JoJo Part 6 anime got leaked
and voiced the Mobilates in Gokaiger
fun fact: He also played Kenji in Persona 4
Been considering. Seeing Jorge Gutierrez as director has me interested so far.
Wake Up!
Share The World
We Are
I decided to listen to all the One Piece OPs just for kicks
top 3 in no particular order are:
I finally got down to starting One Piece
Christine (when she was Chris) directly labeled a thing she would do irl to people a lot after the anime, named the ‚ÄúCurse-yehameha‚Äù, or ‚ÄúShin-yehameha‚Äù, as the Excel Saga version was named the ‚ÄúNabe-hameha‚Äù both names come from the anime‚Äôs director **Shin**ichi Wata**nabe**
Chris Chan has ruined Excel Saga for me honestly
Wait, who‚Äôs the 2nd? Ik we got Miku for one
MF Ghost, a sequel to Initial D, is getting an anime adaptation in 2023.
https://youtu.be/n6w-vwAdqIg
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Vivzie really forgot about this huh
we got the pilot then just radio silence
Truth be told, I tried to watch RWBY, didn‚Äôt like it. There‚Äôs also not a good chance of me gjving it another chance as a former friend who i found out later treated me like shit the whole time was a huge fan of the show
I wonder if GX will happen.
The issue with marketing Gear in the West is that Gear is an EXTREMELY niche fanbase. It's not going to help out with sales a whole lot considering how niche it is genre-wise.
go watch Violet Evergarden now
> Urobuchi
oh no
I‚Äôm actually rewatching Fairy Tail rn
It seems like it would be right up my alley
Idk why
I tried to watch it
It can‚Äôt really continuously hold my interest
~~insert that one panel of Iggy from part 3~~
SBR is amazing
THEY RELEASED KOMI-SAN WEEKLY
ITS POSSIBLE
AAAAAAA
netflix istg
???
7 was an absolute fan favorite, if anything, 6 isn‚Äôt exactly loved by the fanbase.
GOD
JUST RELEASE WEEKLY
But i will say this
Naruto‚Äôs filler is great
Honestly
filler quality vastly differs depending on the show
Edens Zero just doesnt interest me
It has problems
But the characters do kind of tie the show together very well
Saaammmeeee
I mean, I'm a fan of Sentai, I don't think I'm going to be expecting way too much depth going into this lol
Considering checking out the Shinkalion anime, the mechs look pretty interesting.
poge
starting Gintama soon
Honestly, a pretty funny show.
Started Gintama.
Stuff that‚Äôs too kid-friendly for Toonami
and only then
i found out about the movie from a Discord friend a couple weeks ago
> 5 times
jeez
it only opened here for 1 weekend
i also forgot to mention that like half the movie is in CGI
that has to be an achievement
and it's like the first movie to make a realistic-looking human in CGI not look creepy
||A Million Miles Away|| made me cry like hell especially
I‚Äôm gonna shill Belle (2021)
Holy shit
This movie is criminally underrated, not enough people talk about it.
Very few things made me cry, but this movie made me cry like a fucking baby.
The songs in the film, to say the least, are utterly beautiful, close to flawless.
I won‚Äôt say much about the actual plot as I will recommend you watch this blind. Just take my word, this film is amazing and you will cry like hell.
I‚Äôm personally excited to see how the Uzumaki remake turns out.
Anime/game
it was real sad leading up to his death. 
Just this April, he got diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer.
Naofumi in the Shield Hero dub and Maruki in the Persona 5 Royal dub are his most well known roles alongside Josuke
Izumi seems interesting so far. I‚Äôm assuming i‚Äôll learn more as the show goes on.
~~Hayato‚Äôs dad is a fucking mood~~
Watched the first episode of Shinkalion. 
Honestly a pretty solid show so far. The CGI is actually pretty good
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I‚Äôve watched <100
I don‚Äôt watch new shows often
I might give the LN a try.
After considering for a long time, I decided "why not" today and decided to give High School DxD a try. (watched the first ~3 eps)
The fanservice made me feel really uncomfortable a lot of the time, it felt hella unnecessary. As for the action scenes, the spectacle fighting is really cool, but everyone just feels OP as hell, protag included.
Funny enough, the protag is one of the few things I liked about this. When it comes to action-fantasy shows like this, the MC is capital B bland, having just basic motivations like a shonen protag. As for the MC in DxD, he's actually very morally grey, as his **sole** motivation for fighting is just to get laid.
The main other positive I can give this show is the voice acting (I watched it in dub, as in the past I heard the dub was especially good), you can tell the VAs had loads of fun recording this.
That aside, High School DxD is a show I'm going to drop, as even though the premise seems interesting, as the MCs are all morally grey by default, but the fanservice and writing just feels like a turn-off for me.
i'm thinking a lot about how Sheldon from My Life as a Teenage Robot shares a VA with Raiden from Metal Gear
> SAO above G
i'm sorry what
> Fairy Tail above Soul Eater
nawwwwwwwww
Yep
He also plays Iruka in the Naruto dub, which I find interesting.
Then he has a hell of a voice range

Both MGR Raiden and MGS Raiden are played by Quinton Flynn
Both
i just saw after i posted <:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
We talking FT? <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
I saw and I am **HYPED**
I also irrationally love how Manatsu is a competent fighter right out of the gate
breaks the trend of Cures stumbling around until the mascot tells them to do x y z
i love Laura
such a great character, you can tell the writers had fun with her
ep 1 down
really fun, also feels reallly comfy
Gonna finally watch Tropical Rouge Precure, meant to watch it for the longest time.
she holding blahaj
latter imho
I absolutely love her seiyuu (Konomi Kohara) and she was absolutely perfect to play Shamiko

GOD that show is cute as hell

I think I‚Äôll start another anime I know I won‚Äôt finish
It should have just happened at a later time. 
It would have been game over had it not happened in the heat of the Disney Renaissance.
He spearheaded Euro Disneyland, a park that nearly single-handedly bankrupted the company because of how much of a failure it was.
Michael Eisner and his consequences have been a disaster for the Walt Disney Company
Toy Story 2 actually established some lore for Woody that didn‚Äôt end up getting steamrolled because a Michael Eisner-era Disney project was unsuccessful
Woody deserved that spinoff more imho
I guess Pixar‚Äôs trying to be like Marvel in how everyone gets a spinoff movie?
Bit weird, considering that Allen played Buzz in the Star Command movie.
Huh

He‚Äôs been a longtime conservative, from what I‚Äôve seen. Didn‚Äôt stop him from being in Toy Story 4.
I still don‚Äôt get Chris Evans voicing Buzz. I‚Äôm pretty sure Tim Allen could very well still do the role.
Disney moment
Watching Lightyear.
I still don‚Äôt get how this movie was necessary when Buzz Lightyear of Star Command existed.
Newer one. ||Bakugo just fucking dies.||
Read the latest MHA chapter
||Horikoshi wrote himself into one hell of a corner here huh||
and Hikaru
and Haruka
>Grace
>best pink Cure in recent years
Manatsu literally exists
As well, ||Flaccid Pancake isn‚Äôt canon. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúLimp Viscuit‚Äù in the dub/translations||
||god bless DP, they made the fucking Maximum Security arc exciting||
Watched it all at once and it was great
New JoJo P6 eps
The anime industry has absolutely sky-high demand in just about everything, so employees are forced to basically work crunch all the time just to sate the market demand.

Another week, another great Fuuto PI ep
https://tenor.com/view/badass-onepice-thetruth-omgfu-gif-26594461
the one piece is real

Fuuto PI ||god that ending was great. I was actually placing bets on Kuya being the Alcohol Dopant, but the reveal was still done really well. Xtreme also debuted earlier than I expected, I'm assuming we're getting an anime-exclusive form at the end. Still, an awesome fight scene. Speaking of awesome fight scenes, Accel Trial VS Scream Dopant. Holy shit I can not get enough of that. We also got our first look at the Brachiosaurus Dopant (outside of the ending shorts), which looks cool. Didn't think we'd see the whole of our villain group this early on.
I wonder what arc we're getting for 10-12, because it doesn't look like the Puzzle Dopant arc, I'm guessing we're getting something anime exclusive.||
Define mainstream, that‚Äôs a hella broad umbrella
Just finished watching Jujutsu Kaisen 0. God, what a great movie.
~~finally, we have a Gundam taking place in the Midwest~~
At least there‚Äôs the Uzumaki remake to look forward to.

WHY DOES NORVILLE LOOK LIKE A FAMILY GUY CHARACTER
^
I think for me, satire can be done well, but I think there's better ways to joke about that wordplay than just mindless violence.
Read a synopsis and... yeah.
this feels like edge for the sake of edge.
>MLAATR
IM NOT READY
>the Ukraine gov‚Äôt posts CSM fanart and now this
Also shoutout to the OP. Kenshi Yonezu is a godly singer.
Watched the Chainsaw Man premiere.
It‚Äôs pretty solid, the CG was janky, but everything else was solid.
I also started reading the manga, and it‚Äôs actually really good
oh

I need to watch more stuff this season, the only shows this season I'm watching are CSM (gave into the hype) and the Urusei Yatsuura remake (David Production animating it and Sumire Uesaka voicing Lum made me want to check it out)
actually really high up there for me. Heard the song, liked it, but never got around to watching S3 yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFlDRhvM4L0
CSM OP
Eh, I disagree, personally. I personally feel that Kick Back has stronger visuals, OP-wise. But to each their own.
David Production i kinda have to respect solely for how well it does its styling on its shows
Bleach just got added to Disney+ here <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
yeah Demon Slayer
I gave it a shot
I‚Äôve never been a fan of CG honestly
also ^
I agree with this as a jojo fan
That anime was so good,

Not really
She ||got badly injured a couple eps back and just woke up this ep||
She‚Äôs second to Ichigo, the main character, so she has a lot of popularity just from her role as a character. Second, Bleach still has a huge fanbase, the Thousand Year Blood War anime is actually able to go toe-to-toe with Chainsaw Man in terms of popularity, which should speak volumes in terms of how Bleach‚Äôs popularity has stood since the original show ended in 2012.
Rukia‚Äôs on the charts <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
