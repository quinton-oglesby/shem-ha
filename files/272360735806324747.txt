I have a critical weakness to anime involving the power of music, basically
hey there
I have a rough idea how this works, but can you explain it again so I don't screw things up?
just need Giga T for my Ignite Jii after those alchemy raids
T please
go on 7 now?
I feel that way about giga Int crystals, getting nothing but reds from Carol
Sanic, could you do some more T raids after as well?
nice, ready for more
yes, thank you
looks like I need 6 more Giga T crystals for Ignite Jii, so I'll be launching those raids all day
thanks Sanic
gotta spend refreshes to beat down the boss enough to attract whales to your raids
starting again in an hour'll be a lil rough, but I'll see what I can do
I clicked the icon and everything
yeah, i'm in
ahegao, willing to beat down the T bosses after you're done with Carols?
one sec, I'm joining now
can you do Tech next?
thanks for the help! I'm heading out
w00, there's the LU on my Ignite Jii
