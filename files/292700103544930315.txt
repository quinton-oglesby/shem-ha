Yeah well but so many people got to limit up 5* characters and what about the rest now
But like everytime i just see like 99% hp runs
Eh i need mats for my mlb xd hibiki do i guess i have to try to snipe some hard miracle raids...
Wuut
Eh
Yeah hard to find low hp alchemista tho
Cause im in dire need of help with those gigas
I just need to start a raid and ask for help?
So how does it work?
Cause getting gigas is like imppssible on my own
Yo can someone explain hwo does this leeching work?
cause im european and its getting late here ;d
what time does he usually show up?
i hope so
i mean other then 99% hp ones
welp i havent seen a single miracle one in last few hours üòÑ
that would probably solve a lot of my problems ;d
ehh i need a way to get those giga miracles to limit up my hibiki
i mean i need them for raids and pvp right?
guys if i have mlb xd hibiki should i go for healer banner now?
i have one
at least that ;d
k
for 75%?
do they stack?
thats broken af
dafuq
LOOL
?
its not like 15% from 45%
you sure?
crazy
especially on aoe ones
yeah lol
i see
heals*
its not multiplying heales if you put it on healer?
btw it increases heals on character that wears it right?
yeah its awesome
this 15% one?
i wish they added some tickets to choose 3-4* characters
lucky you
only 1x 4* tsuba
but on this mlb xd hibike one im hella unlucky with healers
on my other account i have mlb ignte tsuba and this 3* shiro
yeah same
or open wallet lel
then
gotta go fast
oh really wtf
3-4*
hopefully ill get few 3-4 aoe healers too
k time to farm song stones and bump some into this healer banner
yeah its all luck
i usualy got them after like 20 fights or so
you get 30 points per win and its crazy fast to climb
as long as you get lucky on streak
its so easy
for top5-10 spot
yeah i used like maybe 100 s tones
and not*
and top against top 3000 guys as a top7
usually you are matched against people from you "elo"
not really
pvp is so lame, you can pretty much buy high places
just from spending few gems on refreshing
im like top5-10 on my another account
i mean i know that
‚ù§Ô∏è
oh ok
o damn im opening it then
you guys can clear miracle hard?
^_^
hopefully someone will be helping in 2-3 hours
ill need some help with miracles today
upsies
yeah  i just realised ;d
compared*
well its like +5 comparet to +50 xd
and what is that?
would be nice to have at least 1  for every event tho ;d
greedy bastards
jesus
always new characters added at the same time as event?
and every event have different "event" characters that boost drop rate?
or its 1 ending another starting?
does events have breaks?
did you guys play on jp?
got you ‚ù§Ô∏è
so i started fresh
but i got bored and rolled mlb xd hibiki on this one ;d
im like 53 on my main
with this account ;p
i started today
id love to add you both
yo could you guys find a spot on friend list?
now i stopped fighting and i dropped to like 12 in last 10 hours
i used like 100 to hit top7
gems ftw ;d
i need their help with miracles too ;d
only megas
damnit
sounds like i awesome lineup
hmm double healers with mlb hibiki
y
so +1 ;d
and luckily i got her dupe
yeah i did exactly same
eh i need to quickly farm another 160 gems for last pull in shiro banner
;/
is it possible to burn them?
793335291
i have 3* red one but i have no guns to lb her ;d
<3

‚ù§Ô∏è
my first 2 gigas
woah
only 44 lvl so far eh
i need to make my burnbasa tankier
im unlucky af with dropes
yea
i dont see myself getting 15 giga miracle stones any time soon
and now...
i could solo it in like 35 min on x10
red power was just afk for first 5 days
made it possible
more like 5 days with bugged bosses
i dont fckin get why do these bosses fire their skills like every other turn...
ups w/w
guys xd hibiki best banner when rerolling?
yeah thats like nothing ;s
well playerbase is really low too
eh is like unless you guys are doing mirales noone else is doing them...
Same
So many*
I had do mamy 10-2p lvls wth
I did like 30 spots
Yey
Do we got someone to help US with raids? :d
Although i dont know what's going on
I made room
we killed it already a while ago
point's dex carol open, no more adds üôÇ
second add is almost dead
we should finish point's raid
That's what i wanna see :D

almost noon here ;d
at least for me
nah 1 add still up
Is up
My grren carol
he even leaves them at 1 hp
i mean sanic is the god almight
honestly if i knew how to do it i would just go and clear raids for everyone ;d
hopefully he will clear my raid too ;d
wth some dude just whooped in and did 800k dmg in 1 go
adds down on dex carol raid bois
last one is almost dead
carol dex or dex dex?
basicly yea
Last chance

If anyone is interested

;/
dang, cai's raid has 20 min left but he still have 1 add up ;;
i need blue crystals so badly for my hibiki and yet i dont have a single strong character to farm them ;s
im pretty sure its lowered
not really
well im going with full blue team, fck it ;d
Its gonna end soon, go bump it guys

trying to lu my xd hibiki...
im at exactly same spot
i love this counter and additional attack thingy
but its good to know
well all depend on cooldowns ;p
and it doesnt work on singing
yeah but carol often silences
so its better to rotate it?
oh rly
character that is singing is doing more dmg right?
those will take a while
eh i need soo many int gigas tho
yea same
dafuuuq
i need to LU my red shiro tho
i wish i had second tree memoria
whats her lvl?
if only my hibiki was LU too
234193134*
34193134
scroll up
its higher
20 turns and im still full hp
wow im actually getting a little bit stronger
we can hop into angela's after your
yup they are
i assume
point killed taunt add
angela's has pretty much same situation ;d
k
angela's?
which raid?
2x H kirika
4x dex jii
its like i have so lame 5* its crazy
yeah
and you can choose only from 12 basic characters
apparently is quite hard limited
y
and i too dont know who should i pick...
i still have my ticket to use
thats my question now
how to get a good B character
yea
like 5x 4* T-tsubasa...
but i got so unlucky on this baneer
ehh i wans mlb burnbasa so badly
cheat engine i guess
crazy
wow some dude is selling acc with double mlb aot
usually when i wake up i have 1-2 raids cleared by them ;d
thank god for teemos tho
like 60% hp left i think
there is one goign right now
that scares me
and that
eh at some point ill have to swap for int raid
10x are too much ;d
im using 5cp ones
the adds are dying quite fast
hmm actually its not that bad now
k
does it work the same way?
you have me
o wait
check if you can make some space üôÇ
euden full follower
to farm int raid eh
i wish i had good body unit
just this taunt add is too much for me ;s
im up for any number of green carols
grats
i often see my heals 0 or lowered
carol i mean
she does some heal blocking too right?
where?
come to mine, its less then hour left i think
you mean mine green carol? üòÑ
yeah so its double aoe
i only have chris for aoe in my first lineup
u must use more aoe characters
so all regular attacks goes to her
top one has a taunt
its always like this
like wth
which does less dmg to less enemies and without debuff
always using second spell first...
this AI on cris tho
i cleared a bunch a while ago
yea
thanks
Vredd
it has 1 hour left
can we do mine now?
no gigas...
dang it
without her this would be so much harder
thanks god we have this free cris
or its same for lvl 1 and lvl 50?
does it increases if character have higher lvl?
+2 was like 4% ;o
like first try it was around 20% per character
btw i was kinda surprised when i first tried upgrading my chris spell
i guess ill Lu her for hp and def anywayh
its already 60 at 60 lvl
does anybody now?
LU 3* P shirabe increases cooldown on her heal?
this crit one?
i wish this rev jii was a tad more usefull
?
isnt she like hella underwhelming
why?
so useless eh
well i iam
ikr
right now i die around round 30-35
if i could LU my hibiki and shirabe i think i could sit there easy 40+ rounds
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
too long
im on yours
xd
ugh
emulator or phone?
i need to save some for int raids tho i think
around 25
no gigas
geeez
ill focus on upgrading what i have
im not rolling anything unless i get like 3-4k gems
for gigas

shes one crazy bitch
yeah and poisoned
i wish you could queue abilities when silenced etc
ill focus un LUing my P jii
fck that then
i see
although i have revive jii only at 4lb

+ i dont have solid blue healer yet
nah i gotta save ill just tag it
dang but P raid huh
nvm found him
is it someone from here?
MAGIC
there we go
im talking about TRUE MAGIC
thats not the magic im looking for üòÑ
guys tag me here if some magic start to happen in raids
since its soo many missions to finish..
im doin thi maria/tsuba mission in the same time
to lvl up a bit
might as well use some of them
welp i have some refillers ;p
4 more int gigas and i can help ;d
yeaah thats unlikely ;d
üòõ
which are int
cause of adds
dang it i cant seem to get those last few int gigas...
sup
the heck i have like 260 of them
i need just 2 of them ;d
im mad af
from like last 10-15 i got fires only
int raid is so stupid...
i need 2 fckin giga ints and i cant get them for life...
we should try to finish it imo
and ~500k hp
yeah few minutes left on this raid
There should be a way to convert middle Stones into gigas...
Fckin hell i cant get last 5 int gigas for my hibiki...
like in danmachi, you needed to finish like 3 events to get dupe
and like 2-3 months to get one
just some sort of ultimate dupe would be enough
so many good units from daily pulls
thats what i loved in e7
and daily single free pull from song gacha
yeah there should be some conversion
not a single int from like last 10+ raids
i only get magic and physical stones
he's my only hope right now
i see :d
woah you removed me from following list <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
its Int and P Carol
sanic would you mind finishing my 2 raids?... im trying to get last 2 int stones for 2 days and im hella unlucky ;ss
which you can farm easilyt thanks to lu'd hibiki ;d
its so much easier to farm it with first 5* LU
well if i remember correctly you got first one before fix right?
crying in gacha addiction
yuup
how would i know :d
im at like 9th minute of first episode ;ld
dude
holy moly
waaait they srsly sing all the time while fighting? <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
i mean it say this much when i wanna hop in
if you talkin about poiints one
940k
staring at my phone and tapping refresh
yeah thats what im doing
eh im waiting for big brother Sanic like for salvation
we all know its you who need it more then him xD
since we can do something about it
hopefully the latter
Tyty
Yas!

*
Sanic
I need 1 more int stone and they are do hard to get :/
Samica would you mind giving me a helping hand? :P
Finally done with her

hunt is so op
Deserved*
Reserved ngl

and dem burns
i went with x3
shit i fcked up too
i managed ;d
wow 16k
gimme sec
dang it
then just wait for us to clear them
and some magic might happen
well start all raids whenever you go to sleep
Lets go

this bitch i love
oh yea
ill start watching ine 1-2 hours ;p
not much, like 4 episodes i think
yeah i didint noticed it, for some reason i can hardly see it cuase of the collor
guess not ;p
nep like  from wombles videos? :d
but i guess with burnbasa its pretty easy too
eh miracle is so much easier..
xDDDDDD
got like 5 T and 1 P...
i pulled 3 times
if only i had mlb burnbasa...
and run double healer +hibiki i think
i need to lvl up my int jii for it
with all these burns
i hate this raid
ENTERTAINED
is what i call them
magicians
tap and hope for the best
where do i go to find you
yo yo im up
yaaaap
3 runs and no stamina ;s
eh later stages are such a pain
yeah i guess
neither do i
so far so good, 20 streak
yea
yeah i do that too
porkmaister's most likely ;d
can you clear second tactic quest?
i dont have gold for future upgrades rn
lvl 18 so far
but this defensive one
a bit
like damn she is doing like 5-6k hits to P units xd
yeah with my hibiki i can hope for some streaks
246 place so far
yeah i started playing on this account after like a week from the start
looooooong way to go
sitting at 2k points only...
im catching up on arena
üôÇ
burnbasa + serena will probably do the magic
^_^
1.20 am already wtf
ill start another in and P carol and im going to sleep
i hopped in at like 3k hp i think ;d
i just noticed thanks ;d
yeah lol
and it was enough
for gold i used 2x free chris
or in 2 days
tommorow i believe?
he has great tech jii that can pretty much solo second tactic quest
and for tacticts ask <@!103638500657606656>
yeah same with gold
you can farm 1-1 for easy enchant cards
+ farming story
daily exp quest
yeah
with adds up
let you do way more dmg to carols
just the fck that she has 2 aoe
she is awesome for raids
yes you should
which is not existant yet i think
you need body special dmg character
its pain in the ass
yuuup
try now
ye
its a bit easier then int
you might wanna hit magic raid then
yeah i had same problems
<@!145234510684880896>  ill make room in a minute
yeah ints are pain
thats the dream xd
yeah im going untill i lose ;d
Bad*
Not nad, from 1600 in one go

üê≥
and just hop in for last hits
so i can chill
yeah i have like 3-4 months before next 5* lu
+5 giga miracle tho
Huh barely

i need to work on my 3* int shirabe
+2 LU healers help too
yeah
or ahegao
while int and P carol are pain
dex carol we can farm easily
for me int stones were much harder then gigas
and you are +10
2 lucky hunts
lul
yup hoppin in
i should be able to do that much at x5
hmm i might go at around 300k
thats some dedication right there ;d
dayum 27 attempts
but dayum ignite hibiki sure has low def
but im pretty much missing only few 4* hp boosts ;/
i need to work on her hp a bit
o wow my hibiki doesnt look half bad
<@!256214824109867009> u gotta ask him when hes online
<@!107164200433885184> yeah shes godlike, i luv her üòÑ
his biki is crazy
for this protos
all you need is <@!123525331343769600> in your friends list
Not too shabby

at least i think thats the case
and in next few rounds heals are lowered
but not in the first round after she casted that debuff
they can be healed
i started D carol and killed top add if anybody wants to hit it
btw no top add in mouse raid
nvm i jinxed it ;d
im at like turn 7 and not a single silence so fasr
wait did they do something with carol raid?
;p
why doesnt it show me your raid lul
nah i have you
hmm i think you deleted me
thats good to know
i see
idk if it was a bug or something else
i mean once i got contribution reward even tho raid wasnt finished
but 1/2/3 place grants best rewards
if you only want the contribution then yes
id say burnbasa + serena + dps
Damn

so 9 i guess?
same as miracle
They do :)

whos missing
soo
9 i guess ;p
k got ya
sec*
gimme sewc
im grinding stones rn for 5h pull
so shes awesome for carols
yeah she is full aoe
unless you wanna pull in half a year
there is no saving
yeah which will probably be in a week
fck kanade, her banner is scam
worsc case scenario ill be 4/6
last guaranteed
im farming story to do just that
so it should be easier now üôÇ
i killed top add
ill hit it too
ill clear some space in a minute
with that i can help
its miracles
red one is too much cancer
welp with green i could help
üò≠
oki time to farm event again
so :p
well i already have 4 LU characters
thanks a lot :_)
oki im out, no more rice
wrong chanel ;p
P and I
3* shirabe
but having 2 lvl 70 aoe healers helps a lot
well i do everything with my blue/reds cause thats all i have
I wonder if Serena removes this heal debuff
