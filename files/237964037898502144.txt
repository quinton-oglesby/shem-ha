maria tehepero?
tehepero emote?
ok
xv-spoiler channel
so that people can talk about stuff already leaked for the upcoming season and others who don't want to find out until it's released won't see it
maybe something gray
someone made the emote
ahh
?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/586430197184725003.png?v=1 :kiriheart:
I asked the person who made it and they said sure :3
:bikkidead: new emote
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336297387863703552/585836458955505667/hibiki_defeated.png
ohh
or the shitpost?
eiyu koji?
we can get back miku singing <:GWseremePeepoHappy:402867832175460363>
though that's probably one of the only things she knows
Kiri knows really good jokes
I maybe can try some stuff with it later, looks interesting, but first shower
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
I have it on a small size on pc, so yea, it could look worse there
looks ok on my phonw
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
only fanart as emote when artist agrees
no "yandere" moments in symph really
maybe focus more on the face cause like this the hair looks a bit weird
yea, in emote size the arms will barely be noticeable
won't look good
uff
<a:MikuBear:605209676224921630>
<a:annytfPatsu:612893363284344833> gj cast
yea
looks better
<:miku_fear_smaller:642795087767797789>
<:miku_fear_smaller2:642798863870197771>
hmm
<:miku_fear_smaller:642795087767797789>
the red looks so much more intense than the other colors
maybe?
<:mikufear:642793269134098533>
<:MikuPanic:640289659452129310>
<:miku_fear_left_smaller:642791156199063603>
<:miku_fear_left_smaller:642791156199063603>  lowered it a bit
not that good with editing, tried changing a bit
how is that?
<:miku_fear_left_smaller:642790587455635487>
yea ok, trick the system
test
ohh ok
Just wanna have a white name rn
yea
Could you maybe nickname change available even if I don't have a character role?
Can't change it, only when I have one of the roles.
and he just knows how to upscale
I don't have time rn, fighting for hours with this one laptop already
which picture should be upscale? the last one?
could ask a friend, he has some other program to upscale
maybe some waifu2x or gigapixel ai
dunno how to work it differently
the hand isn't as noticable, if you know what I mean, bikki's face takes the spotlight
looks better but it doesn't make for a good emote
yea
<:bikkigrab2:644197015965925386>
the hand is a bit not so much on focus
<:Bikkigrab:644196123501920266>
also looks ok on my phone
Maybe make a post where you can react with every emote and the emote with most reactions gets axed

this is 320p, still looks god I think
<:HibikiGae:670351165078241286>
that too, the eyes are way too small, to see on some devices when in emote form
and then see we can see how it looks in 1:1 ratio
crop it
emote craze
looks good on mobile
<:emoji_19:672438050068103179>
which resident artist currently accepts commissions?
would work
something like that as Elsa
hmm I would need to see an example
but probably
whiskey, if it's art by someone, the server only takes it with permission from the artist
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
12
:mikusing: was also an emote once iirc
20min maybe
currently ingame so can't help
I don't have original
the cry one doesn't fit really, would be too small It hink
yum
yes
<:MiLULarc:643988488924168200> <:MillaarcHeart:639311534429831178>
<:basaping:645933526130098196>
no including gifs
wow
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
that adam face has too much detail I think
cut out the hand, move it a bit up, and then crop more so that the face is bigger and the file smaller
BOOTS
pile of ash
And also, this is a symphogear fan server, providing channels for other unrelated things is not necessary
Yea, hype has this effect
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
It didn't really matter

The army is marching
<a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236><a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236><a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236><a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236><a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236><a:BikkiSteppy:681651853053788236>

New Rany emote <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
loooong necc
201 new msgs, and kerrik is still at work
rany said emote
looks like she is cooking and messages up a bit because of the quivering lip xD
adorable
I. AM. ALIVE
and the name is a reference to the <:NotLikeThis:435217089117028362> emote, so just funny
<:ElsaSeeU:672845806415511553>
:woof:
1 on the elsawhat
<:tsubasaFish:649775054376140830>
noise
<:tsubasaFish:649775054376140830>
lul
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328> yes excellent
I.. just found something that I need
<:ChrisBang:702166093065748500>
And now just wait for the big guys to approve your suggestion
Yea it looks ok
Because otherwise the emote can look squished down
So it's better to fill all the space with the emote so it's a bit bigger
If that makes sense
The ratio isn't really important, just better
The file size limitation is by discord
?
Is the emote in a 1:1 ratio and under 256kb?
Maybe disabled
Thank you Mel
Ahh ok
I hadn't heard that
ohh
Would Saki allow others to host them?
I have not experienced much lag in discord vc streaming, even with people living quite far away
Could you allow streaming your screen in the voice chat
Reasons for that could be to play jackbox or similar things together
Venting/Ranting channel and more serious,m civilized discussion?
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
I think the suggestion is like for a few people talking
Not for 10 xD
Yea
Could be
Right now it's okay, earlier someone was robotic
Very cool!
Thank you!
We have been playing it a lot lately and it would be easy to ping all people who are interested at once
Could we get an AMQ role?
Could you turn it a bit down? like a quarter of music
Ok great!
Will let you know next time!
can the bitrate in vc be higher? when it gets maybe very full again and a lot of people speak it can get very distorted
I think r/animemes is too normy for Symphogear
Come on, not liking her the most doesn't mean I hate her
And I think out of all gears I like Jii the least
Too pink
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Prelati already has a bright pink <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970> 
White?
<:elsa_woof:689196405251768384>
Can I suggest an Elsa role?
shitposting seems to have been working for now
The weird sentences Jii made
lol
lol
Not just for art
You can talk nsfw in there
I think that's also the purpose of the nsfw channel
suggestion for what? discord?
nah
let's move out of here again, as this is no suggestion stuff
spoiler a link on mobile will word
only with links
No way to spoiler images on mobile at the moment afaik
It can't be disabled, meme
Yes
yea
The line is too thin
And the smile is way to small to see in an emote
<:ElsaChef:689035502673985622>
<:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
but Elsa emotes are beschte
millarc
great emote
At worst they might just ignore it because they don't know themselves.
Not everyone knows everything.
Just ask in general chat.
I don't think anyone here will maul you for asking.
the pins

Look in <#407060923078017026> for some yandere xD
who has the miku knife image?=
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
lsp
from ||axz ep1||
more of a funny screenshot just
it is?
Don't see a use
ehh
derp bikki
you had a candidate?
lol
is on the other server https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/687451696527704148.png?v=1
Yea, I thought it was an emote too
look similar
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889> <:ChrisBored:672575526346424351> <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
You edited the fish so I'd say yes to the fish
is ok
It's a disease
we don't need more fish
this
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
And what kind of expression would that be
The lips are very thin
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
The only more specialized roles that I know are the AMQ role and the Rewatch role which hasn't seen much action since a year ago.
Random thought: A Community Event Announcement channel
Where everyone could write an announcement for an event they might be planning for other people of the server.
Hmm makes sense.
ok
You are very optimistic xD
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>

gonna make transparent

cute
I think it was meant as a joke
bayonet emotes?
> obviously to fix this imbalance we need a hibimiku duo emoji <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
<@!106866895076003840> <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
you can search for emotes in the search bar
Maybe there could be a function in the new bot, that counts how often emotes are used.
just leave the gif slots for gifs
But if you don't have nitro then you can't use these
> wait, do gifs count as emojis? Because if no. Their might be a way to bypass the system
<@!481518367845646346> Different slots for those
Global channel won't be around for long I think soo
Do we need <:SongStone:688213224012644370> 
I never see it being used
Or is it highly used in xdu channels?
> We can delete Serena emote ? 🥞 is enough for her <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
<@!114081181611458563> 🔫
suggestion box is rustling and bustling today
69 new messages
> "color me Akira"...
<@!222517038042710017> HAHAHAHHAHAHA
ohh lol
I think that was brought up once.
<:HibikiKiss:738240567049191505><@!106866895076003840><:MikuKiss:738240587014340649> or this for appreciation
cool
Can we make the 9_8ball command just 9_ball?
lol
don't think nana would pog
that looks like ayahi
ohh yes
👏

https://twitter.com/BelladonnaToxin/status/1290694448414896129?s=20 someone actually did it
idc
Unlocked new Skill: **[Sleep Coding]**
lol
Rady is happy to delete a Kirika emote?
One of them might be another candidate for emote pruning when necessary.
Very similar
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
ah
Can someone make a SerenaZesshou emote? Or does someone have one?
it doesn't look like that much
those are 250? looks so few
ahh ok, didn't know
how did we end up with already 250 normal emotes???
they don't?
How about all gif emotes onto an extra server as only nitro users can use them anyway, then we have space for 250 normal emotes
or do we have that here?
<:BikkiFacepalm:398808522952933377>
Because it's funny
The server banner needs to be updated every day and each time one Maria gets replaced by a Jigglypuff.

That would definitely be more confusing
Only when you know about plural people though
Otherwise it gets a bit confusing


Hellos
I just read "Speed Wagon" instead of "welcome wagon"
upps this is introductions and not general xD
hmmk
is there a song that bikki and miku sing where the lyrics are just about sun and sunshine?
👍
you can watch it all over again in the rewatch :3

<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
you can talk about s1-s4 without restraints though
be careful when talking about xv, only in the dedicated channels, some people wait to binge all or just don't watch currently
so in xv now?

This is by far not the most degenerate place.
I speak from experience
When logging in via the browser it creates a new account which you immediatly join with.
This can happen when your discord login credentials aren't stored in the browser, so discord thinks it is your first time using it and makes an account for you.
Nah can happen, happened to me once too
ahh yea, looking at the account, only one got a pfp and all new

I'd suggest using waifu2x to upscale some of the things that look very unsharp
wtf
didn't get a line stolen
kaiy
wtf
Why does the second one look like when in anime someone died
which is very annoying but the truth
even if you want to make a masterpiece right of the bat you won't be able to
everything takes time
interesting
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Maybe make the edge darker
Good luck
I thought the earlier blockier design was nice
But this is also ok
ah hnice
I think it looks good.
Maybe stretch it out on the whole handle
Another level made in Unity.
(assets from the unity store)
I couldn't sculpt hands so I had to do it this way -.-


from one of the Irregular at Magic Highschool ops
because I posted a screenshot of these subtitles where it said "Lautes Hupen"

Ahh god I just saw this

this looks really good!
<:ElsaSeeU:672845806415511553>

Ahh it looked oinda 3d with the shading and all and the chris too
your models?
lul
that's my reference
still the back part missing

yea, retro alien shooter/horror
There are tools to make 3d drawings, thsoe would have sketch marks too xD
Next time it's faster
ohh, yea now I can see it
Sometimes light sources can appear on really reflective stuff which is annoying
ahh
Are those rectangles the light sources?
Dunno too much about pre 2.8
It's open source
You can make your own! xD
way too much work I think
only if you wanna make a game engine from scratch like the new physics based game
Which would be way too complicated
Or you make the game in blender lel
If the nodes are supported in a game engine or at least export into fbx correctly, then you could use it
noice
Ohh it seems like the addon also exists for 2.9, nice
thx 👍
Ohh what's the addon called?
Right now though, I'm just trying to get better at making characters
I need to get better at weight painting and doing good shape keys for facials
Ahh interesting
MiHoYo doesn't have many games
Gunz Girls is another one of their games, which is another universe in the honkai verse, as it has the same characters
some stuff that looks similar and some images from one game in the other
First thought when I saw that it had Impact in the name, it was another addition to the universe, but nope
Only some fan theories try to tie them together
I know
Wait, do you switch between 2.79 and 2.90?
Love the shader
More like Honkai maybe, but their art styles are kinda the same xD
Nice!
https://twitter.com/mzch3y?s=09 https://twitter.com/ArcaneCompany?s=09 https://twitter.com/minuhana_?s=09
See it as getting better at seeing flaws 
That also helps.
practice is a part of getting good
doing things over and over again
uhh

**cube**
take that censor bar away <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Very cool!
fun
ohh wings
xD
3 good examples
I don't think anyone but feet people will look that closely xD
I have to use Maya rn, which I came to really hate because I just had a stupid bias against it from the beginning even though it's just some tool, but also some of the stuff in it really is stupid.
But my teacher in college doesn't know blender -.-
the interface of blender 2.9 and higher has changed quite a bit
so transitioning might take a bit
ahh an older one
Ohh which one?
Good luck <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Interested in what the project will produce in the future
ohh nice
So you got a whole story thought up already?
Or just bits and pieces?
Making different outfits for characters can also be fun I think haha
I saw you had some chars in mmd once
Btw, what are you gonna do with your models at the end?
It looks very complicated right now.
Several small details compared to the rest.
Yea, reference models are good
Help a lot
Currently no skills to make them .-.
What kind of reference do you use for clothing or just from imagination?
Wanna see it come together as one soon!
Why does every interface look intimidating.
Like, the mmd interface is so weird
When I first started maya the interface was soo confusing
The ZBrush interface is ....
nice
*sigh* yes, yes, a gaynado
but also a rainbow tornade
heh
she is a sun
no shadows
looking great!
nice!
the wings also bend, cool
I thought they were just straight planes
lol I thought there were 4 legs xD
centaur or sth haha
NOOOO
WHAT IS THIS EVIL
Those looks very well made from a distance
heh
Those boots look good!
physics are great
when it works out it's amazing
when it goes wrong
it's frustrating and sometimes cursed xD
https://tenor.com/view/cute-thor-kawaii-dragon-thumbs-up-gif-12372639
Noice
Ohh!
discipline is important with such things
haha nice!
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
lol
<@!457268466429329429> 🔫
All looks good except that line there is kinda weird.
On the right one it was an empty space.
nice
Good job!
noice
:3
I need to look into trim sheets at some point.
Only heard of them like last week or something.
lel
not everything cool has to be complicated
haha
*chewing* is pretty hard
do you?
nice effect with the braclet
https://tenor.com/view/gun-gangster-ready-turn-around-gif-14489666
noice
:3
idk, if you know right
Ah, a small indent, looks kinda weird that it's not more of a straight line, or just one slight curve.
The neck is ok, I would say.
maybe?
lel
Also, looking at it again, the irises on the right are better I think.
On the left, the outer ring of the iris is much thinner and not as noticeable from a bit further away.
Trying out different methods to see what works best for me
Just put the bones in place
*rigify*

yikes
nice
nothing a drill can't solve
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
the lyrics are
"Sie sind das Essen, wir sind die Jäger"
ugh that German
noice
btw, did you just put them in the air, or are they flying?
particles when?
interesting
nice
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
got into it again thx to a friend starting to play
do I spy a honkai tab there
maybe similar to that
isn't miku floating with ssj too and has legs

Fun stuff you can do with good rigs.
Ahh ok
Then, how do you make it seem like that? xD
How do people make straight lines -.-

Looking nice!
I really need to catch up
wow
wait there are 124 chapters now?
> Demon General "M"
I LOVE IT

I need to read that again!
gender bend
nice
> blonde dork
nice
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
who needs a orderly timeline anyway
heh
uff
looking fun
when I can play her in the game? xD
nice ones star and dio!
Ahh ok, I think part of why I think she's a tank is the hair I'd say, with short hair, she would seem more wild.
Looking at her, she feels a bit like a tank.
But can definitely hit hard too.
So there are those kind of weapons.
Any guns in the unniverse?
Or other forms of long range weaponery?
And the Freyja are the strategizing geniuses
So Drengr are the youngest and they then become Thegn, and a bit later on some Thegn are sorted into Barricade, Berserker and Iron Fists and rarely Bahamut
And Titan is just given out when they have a specific height
Ranks, sure.
That feels like more just a bunch of women who like to beat shit up.
Is there some higher-ups planned who keep everything in control?
So all of them are training junkies and like to drink, that's the feel I get.
Or are those just the ones who travel outwards?
Btw, would there at least have been a chance for them to realize the truth?
Like, one of the characters actually did not kill anyone and got what was promised?
Otherwise it just seems as if you wanted them all to just kill in the first place and not thinking about giving them a chance.

Also, do they just kill others who have the same condition as them or each other?
Is the Doppelgänger the antagonist of the story or is there also some other force, that they are against?
It's always so weird reading "could of [verb]" and not "could have"
Pretty fucked up
Interesting
lmao
Vergrößere den Inhalt!
Wasn't there an episode where squidward was bandaged in a wheelchair and patrick and spongebob took him out to jellyfishing?
ahh ok
That one
The ||toenail|| one? I remember seeing the animation and hearing the scream to it
thinking back to some spongebob scenes
they were pretty ugly
like that ||scene where squidward's toenail was ripped out or something along the lines||
don't click if you're eating
urg
ahh ok
SI?
- Being with limitless physical form
- has glock
xD
Thanks
ehh substance painter doesn't have very nice leather materials
need to work on it on my own
but that's tomorrow
So smol
ahh still scuffed AO
need to manually unwrap -.-
nice
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Ack automatic unwrapping makes it scuffed
Ambient Occlusion map föcked
Nearly forgot to unwrap the model
lel
Gonna try some substance painter with it now.
A pouch to put on a belt
Hey, looking pretty good actually
hoh nice
haha
This thing's UV was also a pain
This things tormented me rn
Fuck upped UV
Maya UV unwrapping is NOT good.
Only the unfold tool is good, but not really
It looks like a thruster is coming out of her ass xD
Ok
btw, do you keyframe the wings manually or use some addon?
noice
all the animation
YIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
heh
don't misplace em :3
Noice
How about the UI?
Can you move everything easily or stuck with whatever the default is?
How is the engine?
Easy to work in?
Like, changing appearance, which is mentioned?
Ok, wouldn't "they" be easier or is it just preference?
is intentional that it switched between she/he?
it reads really confusing, at least for me
reminds me of jii
looks fun
Noise
You're bringing it up to a new level
glow glow
cute
I read "mama" xD
snecc
make snekroom for snek
snek doesn't fit in the room
many snekments
just because of the to Cs I read that as thicc
nice
hmm a or b
small
It's weird that all the space around the face is taken up by so much hair
As if there is nothing but hair beyond it
ohhh she cute
👍 keep at it
Tran-Xodia
uff
lul
Started the face part.
Also did it all the way down to the chin.
But the mouth was so horrendous that I couldn't keep it.
not my feet though
that's my feet reference
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
ahh lul
but yeah
ouch
It's back
:3
Why did you delete that, Gwen?
Definitely need to do more feet
Those toes are....
Need to set myself time limits
Hand finished
If I take more time I'll either just ruin it or will never be done


Very nice
is there gonna be thigh squish from the stockings?
xD
looking good
hooo
Hoo
Writing shader sounds way too complicated xD
noice
fuun
**what**
*Akumo no ronpa*
Any specific reason?
lol
Head is coming along.
Some sketchy stuff but small details, so it shouldn't be too much trouble.
eyyyy playable video!
yep, lego studs
can't play avi
ack
WUU PROBLEM SOLVED

Why the fuck is this happening -.-
can see that
some tips
the nose bridge would need some more work
currently looks off
the nose also looks a bit crooked, try having the tip a bit higher
and the lips are currently just looking like a few brush strokes, for a first attempt looking really good, but definitely something that you'd might want to improve

overall I really like how it looks for your first time

how many polys did you have in the end? I think it says that somewhere in the settings
Nice
What app is that?
Nomad?
Ohh nice sculpt
Probably gonna make some sort of simple shoes
And then I need to get to the hair
I really like how the skirt worked out
lol
butts or buds?
GREAT
haha
for example into blender
then edit some stuff on the model to actually be able to animate it and everything
which can be really cool
dunno
but with the full version btw
you can even export your models into other software
there is a free version with limited features xD
maybe just android?
ohh ok
then this is the full version
ohh you alerady did
not an extra app
is an in app purchase
in the settings you should be able to see it
15 bucks I believe
yea
if you actually buy the full version there is also multiresolution
a bit hard to explain for me though
yea, nomad has some smoothing
there is autodesk cad I think
no clue
Never used cad, cadd
how is it spelled?
some people do close to one by one
I didn't do it one by one
But for example
started with a loop at the eye lid
then extruded out from there and modelled further
had to reload
being fucky
ahh discord
wait wtf
I have been taking screenshots and ctrl v them in here
but none appeared
here some flat shading
without
with modifiers
or smoothing it a lot
modifier is for example giving something thickness
wanna see how my model looks without any modifiers?
xD
hahaha
if you have a reference for side view
that will also help a lot
but both references should have same proportions
Yea, references are op
Hahaha
Nice <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
don't start making small details when there are big parts unfinishe
and then some small details
to medium details
work down from biggest details
don't try to overdo it with vertices
ohh reference
Need hair and then textures

ik

shoes

lol
you first need to retopoligize sculpts
that means remaking the model faces by faces over the existing model
there are some tools but often you still do it by hand
sculpts are not ideal for games
Or shorter lines
Looks more like rain
Finished that one
If you don't know that maple story character then seeing just Tsukine alone is pretty ok, just a cute oc
The design seems mostly inspired with a copied color palette
So maybe a change of color might make it look better
Or changing the clothes completely would make it less same-ish

As long as Tsukine doesn't feel like the same character with her personality, fighting style, backstory then I'd say it's completely fine
Ohh, so the left one is not your oc?
And you think Tsukine is too close design-wise, to her?
what makes your unsure about them?
lol
The whole color palette is nearly the same and also design is the same in some places
Funny that both have blue kinda energy rings on their head xd
https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/abandoned-building-96e7c6cd3529498aa0d7199e7115e5c0 finished this scene finally!
If anyone has some ideas, especially towards the lighting, then please tell : )

That looks horrible xD
huu
https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1366881750358573063?s=20
?
Ahh ok
Those UV maps seem to be very helpful when you don't want any pixels to show up on the edges of the UVs for example.
Like this
https://twitter.com/TheRoyalSkies/status/1375369353298907136?s=20
Have you ever done square UV maps?
Most detail there, so makes sense
Blade is just long without much intricate parts
How is topology
there is a minisword on the sword xD
:3
ohhh
üff
smol gam

any way to make it bigger? xD
the gmae?
Ohh nice
Horror zombie game?
I think yamete tomete was also translating events, right?
gacha is pain
Maybe, would depend on the style of the ui and all that
Ohh just a cutout
Yea that looks really cool!
But it looks really great!
Probably too detailed for a small icon
Handle maybe kinda slim?
Would easily slip, I feel xD
https://tenor.com/view/noice-nice-click-gif-8843762
Damn NICE
on the left sword
on the edges
The light blue is a bit weird
right
Haven't heard of that one
I use Clip Studio Paint myself, when I need some 2d stuff
I've heard of medibang
Ahh ok
How is your texture workflow?
Do you make them in blender and paint on the model or a 2d drawing program?
those boots are big xD
big sword
If you have high resolution textures that is
they do follow some artists who often pump out art
and like those artworks
on birthdays they probably get so much art, much of it goes unseen
be better
practice
do more
In the last minute the song has a totally different feeling.
It feels like a falloff in the whole song, from harsh sounds to more nearly relaxing parts at the end.
Easing, that's the word!
You're welcome!
Maru goss boom
compressed
Not a controller player, so idk if it would be detrimental if it wasn't there.
Is there any falloff(?) when you only move the thumbstick a little bit?
It looked really fast
today's achievement is gamer particles
hi kiana
lol
The level is a bit weird as it also has its own rounded square background and they overlap weirdly.
But yea, HI3 lol
Looks nice
Is the ``100% [5000/5000HP]`` a bit higher than the ``health:`` in front of it?
With the Mana it looks ok
But thanks
You could do it too
Just like, watch 2 videos on yt xD

The harder part is still to come
https://youtu.be/DqVPjF84Q4g
<@!84811738653929472> this I made today
I wanna make something else too, but gotta try out a lot for that
yea
Though I have no clue about musical terms, I think I understand.
https://youtu.be/nbRlNQ1oZVY?t=119
Similar to the thing from Kiana's Neko Charm ability
Any feedback on how the animation feels is appreciated.
next step is getting a good model to do this with
https://youtu.be/AixGqZHxIt8 wuu got it to work!
ahh damn
made the color gradient wrong
Symphogear aet and fanmade symphogear things are meant to go in the channel <#357682999300718592> 
This one here is for non sympho related content
: )
https://youtu.be/9AHPXOBXOLM fuck it
Through the Fire and Flames
WUU
I understand how to make this and how it works!
rainbows win?
brs vs?
the girl from tales of berseria?
Yes, that's this channel's purpose.
noice!
Noice
ahh cool
One thing that I also noticed now, nothing major
But if you think about it, you don't know who is actually the crazy one
The person whose POV we read could very well be a yandere and the evil puppeteer could actually be a good person
Just something funny I noticed
So, you changed it to "that very night" instead of "that fortnight"
I think the flow of the text is better like that
lul
Hmm, ok, it might be able to work together, depending on how it's delivered.

And I just noticed, you wrote "that fortnight".
Doesn't a fortnight mean a period of 14 days and not a specific amount of time, e.g. since that night.
To the first one:
``You are no tool here I can prove it here``
Two times ``here`` feels kinda off

~~The themes in the text also don't seem very coherent. The first verse seems like a cavalry group fighting together and either 2 or the whole group trusting each other. But then there is also a motive of a puppeteer and scissor, which I think are there to symbolize cutting strings that are controlling someone, though I'm unsure.~~
The more I read it again and again it seems to be a story, where the person whose view is presented is saving someone important to them from an evil force (puppeteer).

But also, there is something odd about the text. If I had to try and guess, I would say some of the words don't fit together.
For example ``fortnight``, ``zen`` and ``puppeteer`` being the main ones that stand out to me.
This, with maybe some more tweaks.
Currently thinking of adding some sound effects or just letting it be.
Today's animation space is a bit crowded xD
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Yea, it's great when you can look at your art and don't see 100 mistakes but actually feel proud.
Sounds fun
damn nice
Idk about boss baby so <:LucinaShrug:400744933218058260>
Do babies start walking upright when they are born?
It's basically the same thing.
Now we are just conscious of it.
Doing more an taking feedback will make you better
First times are rarely anything good
Ready for take off?
hoo interesting
I would post an image but I can't find any that are *sfw* enough and still show it well
have you seen that one fate character with the green horns?
at least not giant horns half as big as a person
these are still reasonable haha
interesting
hoo
Now it looks shady
badumtsh
She's done with your shit.
Looks cute
<:HyuvanThumbsUp:704550019445030932>
Like the hair!
she is kinda cute
what's that on her neck, tattoos?
ahh it's too late to make hot choccy milk -.-
microwave too loud : (
thiccy dumm
lol
2 no frills
jumpy jump
I could put some simple boxes under it
Currently I have it like that, as I wanna stay in the mid poly area still and not have too many polys
That should work?
Any opinions on it?
ye
I forgot to model those things
To adjust the tension
<:BikkiFacepalm:398808522952933377>
Hey. Now it looks good
UVs nearly done
Much better
I just checked the normal directions
lmao how did I mess that up so much xDDD
!!!!
Now onto making the UV maps
Maybe also changing the how many blocks wide it is with the difficulty setting?
Dunno how it would feel, but it would be interesting.
Feedback when hitting something would be great, imo.
Yea, sometimes I am between two blocks and wanna go to a side after passing the block. But somehow in passing I still hit the block.
I think because there is a bounce it looks weird in that scenario.
Does the cube bounce off of walls when it hits them?
There is also Tayasui Sketches
Ibis Paint seems to also be free and over good features
Autodesk Sketch maybe
I only know it works, haven't used it a lot though
And can't compare it really
It's always good to tell when something feels off about art, when the artist is interested in feedback
Sometimes minor comments can help someone see things that they haven't thought about before
So, I don't think you have to hold back a comment
Did a small update to it
https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1414642413008740355?s=20
**FUBUKI LIKE THE TWEET**
Thank you : )
https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/f4eda326e94f4614b3e7f5aec57816a2
Also on Sketchfab now
https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1414234998777991168?s=20
so I think it's intentional
The screenshot of the start menu was also like that
I think the pixelated look is nice
noice
ahh because the needles is covered by a hull
the needles of the watson concoction are also blue?
<a:KumoClap:820244183029121025>
is the oc pounding your mom?
a detective
ahh, having the layout diagonal
?
*italics*
Ahh ok, gotcha
Then maybe you could give the character a simple animation of floating up and down, like he is not being effected by gravity.
Though the text with just the purple does look nice
I think the purple doesn't fit with character's colours very well.
A background would be good.
<a:CocoGun:727974380482723861>
WIP
tail animation finished
need several more animations still
That seems very white
More like make up
Probably best to not show the eyelids then
Or, you could make the upper eyelid a little bit brighter than the face.
That would be normal.
Yea, I think that's better
right
ohh
What is MLP?
It does look like vectors
Also, you do vector art?
They eyelid cover on the bottom right one is weird
*An audio wall :3*
The bus won't stop?
What if it crashes into a wall?
Bus stops too?

https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1416492630997938178?s=20
How about making the mouth wider on the crazy expression?
Looks a bit small right now -> You'd think it's not meant to be crazy but more happy
top right looks crazy


huh
Not the white/light blue highlight
The dark blue border of the circle
top bottom left right
they go very far out, which make it seem less like a circle and more like a diamond shape

Make it more diamond shaped
The left right top bottom of the blue buttons/sliders
Ohh I see what you mean
I also set up a pixiv now https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/91408596
Well done
Fun to watch
fbk tweeted that she woke up, so maybe 🤔
~~reuploaded it because there was something scuffed that I quickly fixed~~
She seems to go through her art # periodically, so she might see it
it's like 5am in japan now, so I will see later or tomorrow
lol
On the digital one you can see the brush strokes, which makes it kinda weird, bluring it might help
Square pupil when everything else is round(-ed) doesn't fit well
The thing between upper eyelid and eyebrow in both versions looks weird
Like the Pencil one
Yes, it's a bar
Ohh, please tell me more.
Is it the sharp edges?
The flat sitting surface?
I wanna know how I can make them better
https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1425366545556025352?s=20
haha
I thought it looked like something that would fit into a Honkai dorm
haha
ohh this is nice
why the German....
wait
did one of the characters there say "In the name of the *Prinzessin*" ?=??? it sounded an awful lot like it
https://youtu.be/B186kSYglEA this also seems to be a good approach though
And it requires less manual work
Though I haven't tried either yet, so I can't really say
Royal Skies on youtube currently has done some videos about it
They are quick to watch
Would be a good starting point
Like, normal editing, or just standard
Btw, what kind of shading are you using?
Yea, with textures, a lot of the surface details become nice
Love how horrifying meshes look
damn that's a lot of vertices
Ahh ok
Yea, seems like a good area to improve
What are you changing?
ass
looks cool!
za matt made art!
Look at that nice UV Map!
ohh for the band ok
I know egoist, they make music, more I do not know
Inori
She looks really similar to the one girl in Guilty Crown
Should I teach you?
Takes 5 minutes
lol
Comic Sans?
Ohh nice
oh what is this going to be?
https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1432379035938697218?s=19
👍
No.
https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1431396378681430018?s=20 I blame you

shite#
gimme 5 minutes
f u
because that guy has way too small limbs
and it will look horrible
now I'm thinking of making the sukonbu do that
-__-
It's supposed to be stylized rather than realistic dirt.
Does the texture look weird?
Anything about this that you see as off?
(Besides of course the perfectly sharp 90° edges)

Saturation on the left one is very strong.
Melua suggested to have only half of the saturation value you have there (if you edited the image with filters)
You can just create a text mesh in blender, can use any font installed on the pc
Or make your own text, which takes a bit time though

Yes
Let me check real quick
If it's just letters
Hey, I edited this video (and the whole podcast it was cut out from)
Would be cool if you could check it out :3
https://youtu.be/DYwzH3Acfgg
This looks good enough for a pixelated game
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Looks good
Maybe make the main green a bit less saturated

i just... i just noticed.... there is still something important missing.......
~~maybe I could even animate the eye glow somehow, god that's way too much work~~
I only now noticed how well the eyes work with the particles below damn
colour blind?
How do you know the sign is trying to stop you?
Mostly green signs aren't warning signs.
No

How much of Control is destructible?
Does it always break the same or is there something dynamic to it.

CONQUERING
I'm also awful at depth
That's why I do 3d xd
ah
Faces are easy to practice? lul
doing something every day will be good practice 👍
https://youtu.be/H2Oiz6h2gro made a stream transition for stream on stream
just for next time
For symphogear fanart you can use <#357682999300718592> : )
Nice
The transition is a bit abrupt right now
Maybe there could be a tile that goes from grass to maybe stone or sand over to water.
Looks good. Nice colours. The brown hair got quite a lot darker with the scanned version.
The nose in the image is too far left I'd say, putting it between the eyes would be better, or her right eye would need to be angled differently.
Similar thing with the lips
The eyebrows also got different colours because you used filters.
Is the right eye looking to the left? looks a bit like it, good perspective
nice
dirty paper
but besides that good I would say
those colours a great imo
And the skin colour on the shoulders for example is very dark
you wouldn't normally use pink like that on skin
for example on the neck and such
The artwork itself, linework and colour choice is good
Though there is the over-saturation again
Way too over-saturated colour
Or did you use pink when drawing it?
Colours are good
Nice 👍
mirror modifier > symmetrize
mirror modifier?
because the interpolation between curve points is calculated it's always round
doing it by hand would take too long or result in weird shapes
curves are used when wanting to create more organic shapes
ye
ctrl a
then you have mesh
under that you have curves
bezier
Could use curves to make a better one imo
that banana lul
zzz
the apple is sleeping
👍
You two ok?
Look at the pumpkins in both
It just doesn't look very good
Maybe mask them out when increasing the saturation or other sliders
why not draw with red when you change it later anyways?
you saturated the colour so much again
the clothes are now red instead of orange
idk about poses
I just didn't remember them
not like I think you're lying
guilty crown had mechas?
Thank you : )
https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1459343079027228681?s=20
I definitely had a hoot making this
it was somehow really really enjoyable to make, more than I thought so
probably because I used reference and that gave me some really great (relatively seen) results
What does that mean?
https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1459158676586049539?s=20
To me it looks like they were just asking 🤷‍♂️
I think at some point the cost for the models will definitely be higher than a 3d printer
3d print it
Regular practice :3
Ahh ok
in february?
The human you did some time ago?
Btw, <@!84811738653929472> , would you share any of your recent sculpts?
I'm interested in seeing them :3
you want the pureref file with the references too?

give me a bit
Ohh sure
https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1459537831194509312?s=20
looks inspired from Noire
https://tenor.com/view/sonic-trailer-jim-carrey-egg-man-gif-14045451
<@!189292234678468609> this one
But I don't have the skills and sometimes just don't get myself to do it
I want to make so many things
Same haha
Though you probably won't be making any *great* characters soon.
Because that takes practice.
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U
There is this playlist which is pretty good at teaching Blender fundamentals for many things.
It covers a lot of things to get you started with making a nice scene. And then from there you can branch out into other fields.
I personally like blender more, as I can use the interface more effectively
But there are also people who like using Maya and 3dsmax
I think before doing anything big like this, learning the basics is definitely important
Do you know much about a 3d software? Blender, Maya, 3dsMax?
And there are many other communities too
I wouldn't spend multiple hours each day, but like 30 minutes a day can be fine
Hey, I like to help out
You could learn English along the way

One important thing when learning, is to always communicate with other people: Feedback, asking when having a problem, etc

That is also a good way to learn
You can definitely learn simple character creation/design in a year or so if you effectively learn
Though the keyword there is "effective"
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
The longer you spend time with your own work, the more you hate it for all the flaws
8888
It's a very high quality model, textured, rigged and even has some animations for devs that just want to make a game without having to animate stuff
https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/g12zm/guilty-gear-anime-style-character-neutrophil
The model is by Royal Skies
the angle does it
Thanks
Animation took me two hours, but the practice was nice
fuck you
don't call me out
I finished work shortly after noon and had no fucking motivation to do anything
ahh ok
just different outfit this time
isn't it the same lul
that one

didn't your other pink haired oc also have twintails?
nice
May the rigging gods be on your side
Good luck
Ahh ok
There might be an addon too that let's you apply modifiers when shape keys are present
Ahh ok
Why do you not use shape keys for mouth movements?
heh
Looking mighty fine
I saw that xD
Don't worry
Nice art!

Just a friendly reminder. This channel is mostly for non-symphogear stuff.
The <#357682999300718592> channel is specifically for all symphogear related things created by people : )
inverted hull best for it
outline's always nice for this kind of style
cute haha
uhh looking nice!
Why le and not la?
Star, I have a question about Adobe Animate:
Is there stuff like bone rigging, weight painting and IKs in the program?
: D
it looks nice
totally
be proud of it
The solid colour of the orbs is weird, because the rest of the image has gradients and shading
and then solid colour blobs, makes it weird

The hair behind the glasses looks like cracks in the glasses
didn't someone say they wanted new innovative controller schemes?
forgot who it was
can always try picking up the skill again, just a time investment, as long as paper and pens wouldn't break your wallet
as long as it's not theft and you are 100% transparent that it's traced
see, tracing can be good
You *can* trace things
Just be truthful about the source image
If people say it's "cheating"
Then just know: There is no cheating when it comes to creating art, just different ways of doing it, some better suited than others
I would say refusing to use reference will make it worse
thank you for this great meme
ohh nice
ohh
: )
Pinterest, for how shit it is, can be a good way to collect reference
Or just google images
Reference will always make a piece of art better
YES
The hair looks nice
I'd say try to improve the eyes
The shape and the eyelashes
A nice practice can be to try and copy a few eyes that you use as reference
And then turn the paper around and draw it from memory
It's a good way to memorize things for drawing
noice
sometimes you censor sometimes not xD
cool
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I heard it haha
I like it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9VysWRHPdI
wtf
I don't like subscriptions
because like, what if you don't do well for a few months?
you can't cancel it, because maybe there will be another contract coming soon, and if you didn't have it, you'd make less quality content or it takes more time
uff that price
*nice*
though if you make money with it I'd say it's a good price
yep
~~though the more interesting tools are in the pro version which is quite annoying~~
probably
the software has a trial version
and then there is an essential and pro version
1 time buy which is the best
I saw a presentation of it at a developer conference for art and animation
That's another 2d animation program which those features and seems really powerful
I was just wondering how similar it is to Spine
knight moonbeam
looks like Kiana's mjolnir(?)
language is overrated
talk in grunts
just cut out -astas- and you get Ania, so Anya is totally ok imo
*where is the tail*
ohh
first nephilim had a hand fetish
2nd has a foot fetish heh
nephilim 2.0?
LMAO
so performance and better visual clarity
I once played no man's sky and it was still on
game ran horribly
turned off
perfectly fine
it looks bad
No motion blur option, as it should be
maybe sleep about it and then you'll have your answer
ohh sorry
it seemed like you showed them as options
4 or 5
like in forza horizon 4

that's a feature
*oh wait, the baked frames don't get packed into the .blend file*
that's good, so it means I can still upload it to sheepit xD
just 40-45% cpu utilization on baking

Mumei drew this once

<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>

ahh ok
wait, are you gonna stop painting?
lmao
belly button
niiice
can they cosplay mami tomoe??
uhh nice
uhh

Already a few months back it seems
Just looked through all the images you posted, and to half a year ago this is much better
Ohh damn your art is quite a bit better since I last looked at it

5.832.000 vertices
8.748.000 triangles (when triangulated)
👏
cube.8100
lul
cube.003 cube.004 cube.005 cube.006

ok
ayo
which software are you using btw
nice!
Gonna animate it?
looks like a camera that can beat you up haha
cute
ahh
who is that?
lol

faces are fucking hard
you seem to like it a lot then haha
looks great for a first time
Yoo! really cool
END
Sure, come and get some
the cookies taste great btw
it's a normal size oven, but it's possible to just use the upper/lower half
more efficient that way
an oven usually doesn't have a magnetron to create microwaves
they won't win a beauty contest, but damn the dough tastes good
That's a flower

ye

naisu
ohh the right one looks interesting
I just don't like pages like any other launches
been using it for like 4 years
it's a nice launcher
no niagara launcher
Grandmother approved cookies
D
honestly, you do not need a lot of sculpting tools
rarely you use more than 10
>90%of the time you use 5 tools
yea nomad is nice for tablets
I only saw them used briefly some years ago and they were really simple in comparison to blender/zbrush
Maya has really limited ones
Doesn't ir
Ohh, there seem to be tool
3ds max doesn't have sculpting afaik
nice!
it tastes so much better than pretty good
Very fluffy and soft
they taste... awesome
with cocoa powder
Cookie dough

Uhh nice
Neat
Yea, I know nomad, you used it some time ago to sculpt a head

Didn't know you could texture in nomad
uhh nice
what software are you using?
cuuute

yo this is pretty neat!

Rigging can be quite painful if you don't like it a lot
Stay strong
I'm making one of my models into a vrchat capable model rn
Gonna have to stuff more bones into it xD
no problem
hehe
*Have fun rigging*
YOOOOOO
🧱

yo, that seems really cool

also have a bedroom
that "doorway" just has no door because it's way too big for a door, they are 2 separate room
both in that directiojn
this is what it looks like irl
lmao

That's some nice material on those rocks 👍
hehe
pog!
yes
and it's like 16-17 years old
but that one only goes to like 74cm
yea

that thing...
sorting...
yes
still have 40GB storage left on my phone xD
already downloading on the other sympogear discord daily, good that I have 5gb mobile data xD
goddamnit now there is a second server where I have to download art from... xD

Kanade best underappreciated character
xD
lol
never heard of this opinion until now xD
lmfao
enemies wouldn't stand a chance?
why did she have to be so amazing and then had to die...
wtf that kanade looks epic
lol
why was there so much KirikaShirabe stuff
hmmk
yea, considered asking but don't want to make him work so much for just one picture
I asked them but they said they also don't know anymore where the original one is
yea, that's the pfp of someone else but I really wanted the full picture...
hmmk

is shirabe taking some time to find it or is it instantly?
I tried to find the original of that image for some time now, google got me nothing and most websites just redirect to google and another website that said it searched 34 billion images also found nothing but that website also didn't find a lot of other stuff

rigging a 3d model rn, need more experience with blender so I can make some symphogear stuff, so currently investing time in other stuff so I can then make symphogear stuff
despite me just sitting around at home and doing nothing currently Symphogear isn't 100% of the time on my mind, only maybe 90-95%
ok
maybe will do that tomorrow

wtf is with that art of Tsubasa's grandfather whose name I can't remember and don't want to remember
the Gungnir looked different than in the anime
üff
and aspect ratio was around 9:20
no, she was in mid-air and maybe wanted to drop on something with a kick, similar to the one I send
ok that's epic
she had like red claws on her boots
I know the one I'm looking fir exists because I had it as a bg once but can't find it, maybe have to go with another then...
want to use it as a wallpaper cause I got a new phone and it would fit pretty good cause it has a bigger screen than my older .-.
Hi, I need some help finding a piece of fanart. It's Bikki in a non-standard gear. The pose is similar to the one seen below. The picture  is quite long maybe 9:20 ratio. Her whole body is visible. Have been looking through several folders and thousands of pictures now... Thanks in advance :3
that face..
her eyes look kinda derpy
also haven't downloaded anything really for some time
haven't touched for quite a while cause I've been doing other stuff and stuff...
uff
no more sorting?
yea
I think I got it mixed up with another piece
memory failed me
sry
phone still needs to be longer to fit all .-.
uff

I found it
lol

all kinds of things combined make me question all the time why I'm still friends with him, but he is actually very innocent and sometimes a bit naive
ok, I'll try to name a bit, everything here is what he told me
as a child he saw demons when going to bed and heard them
he witnessed one of his brothers using sorcery on another
he is in college, no job, and spends several hundreds of dollar every month and tells me all the time how he wants to save money
hi aunt does sorcery
nah, my friend is  more messed up
oK
ok
ok
ok?
a what?
I think that's an understatement

the perspective and how the blanket is laid down makes it look like that
also because you can't see the bed they are laying on
if they are doing that, and not just sitting on it
it looks like they are upright and not laying down
they are somewhere in the nearly 5gb hibimiku folder in the pinned message with the mega link
there are several artworks of Miku, Shehma possesing Miku and Shemmy together

better to not spread rumours, and only facts that you know are correct
or obsessive fans
You could try and search for it
But it's mostly considered a bad thing to do
As exposing their irl identities can also bring them harm
from extremem haters and such
the social media account doesn't belong to the person behind it but the company though
as they are only characters and should stay like that
she wasn't allowed to say what is gonna do after this
as the company doesn't want to reveal the people behind the characters
maybe taking a small break or starting her next ambitious project
who knows
she is gone now
and that's very sad

the character kiryu coco is sadly gone
though some people have continued to support the streamer in her other endeavours
best ending?
I just don't know how to connect it right now
i watched it
?
so forgetting everything about her would be a loss
there are more happy memories than sad memories
but I'm also happy I have those memories and never want to forget them
yes it's sad
remembering her is nice

```
Vanessa

The woman leading the remnants of the Bavarian Illuminati.
Her promotion to this role was not due to any particular combat or leadership skills, but simply due to being the most senior member of the organization.
Although it may be considered unfortunate, her soft demeanor conceals a shrewdness that allows her to accomplish her goals.
During her time in the Bavarian Illuminati, she was involved in developing the Faust Robes. Unfortunately, due to an accident, she sustained heavy injuries.
The Faust Robe technology was used to help recover her lost faculties, making her into a form of alchemical cyborg.```
```
Millaarc

A former member of the Bavarian Illuminati.
She is the product of a failed experiment to recreate monsters of myth and legend that was undertaken in the organization's pursuit of eternal life.
She is gifted with not only the ability to fly and enough strength to be able to fight unarmed, but also the power of mind flaying that is hidden behind her stained-glass eyes, making her more than capable of both direct and subversive attacks.
She intentionally acts with malice in order to protect her comrades from getting their hands dirty.
However, for those she recognizes as a foe, she has no trouble discarding compassion and standing to face them.```
```
Elsa


A former member of the Bavarian Illuminati.
Just like Vanessa and Millaarc, she was once a test subject held in contempt as a worthless failure, but she resents that label and desperately wants to change.
Despite being the most junior of the remnants, she is considered to be a notable genius and reliable organizer.
The bestial features she was implanted with allow her to strengthen her nervous system as an element of her fighting style.
In addition, she is able to attach various tails and similar devices into a socket at her hip, which she uses as her primary form of attack.```
ok
was just posted in symphogear discussion but sure
but idk if that's intentional
I told him that I somewhere heard that the name also means something backwards, as in: Ainotame

bikki casually grabbing onto chris' chest
bikki carrying chris was also good
xD
yea xD
gonna go for now, see ya
and I was sad because of it
I wanted them to be happy, it was just the same like in AXZ
I hate that Noble Red sacrificed themselves like the Alchemist Trio
we saw Kanade again
sadly
uff yea
soon the depression will kick in
finally unmuting this and xv art again
sure, I edited it yesterday, courtesy by paint
I need to drink water. now. lots
at the end, the end scene after that my legs were numb, my forearms and hands felt numb and my face because it was so exhilarating xD
when TsubaMari sang their first song together ohhh wtf I loved that
but HibiMiku scene was better
the last song that everyone was singing somehow sounded so weird at first and then it felt like an idol song and I just wanted all of them to form an idol group at the end of the anime xD
xD
I had 1 whole hour to watch 3 episodes, that hype just kept on coming
It was epic
yes
fucking beautiful
I loved the flaming hair
This last scene got me so much, I was shaking
That scene got me the most
I LOVE IT
GAY

I got into Symphogear because Baka Oppai made an AMV where they used like a 1 second clip of s1 concert and I really needed to know which anime it was and then I found it on kissanime
what did she write?
I'll be crying by tomorrow maybe
ytt ❤
: D
just looked at the lyrics... ok.....
I never heard that
I really need to go now or idk what will happen, good night and happy/sad crying all you fucking weebs ❤
Curse of Balal -> no undestanding between people -> conflicts
that caused conflicts
but it was the Curse of Balal's fault for not understanding each other
yea
and then I forgot what happened
Finé was in Shirabe
huh
why?
yea
ywa
xea
yea
ahh
what
wow you can THE FUTURE?!!?

only know 3.5 a bit
idk 3.5 so yea
yea I noticed too and I rarely do, at the end when miku was talking about the bird and coughing blood thing
yesterday yt subs for 12 weren't even out, millhi said their translater is being murdered by uni
lol
I need to sleep soon, doctor appointment in the morning -.-
Muscle or Gay
Gen or Miku, who would win
definitely
the concert will kill you further
lol
I never noticed
hold up
"Get it back, out future, our *tomorrow*"
I had kiri instead of shem ha
just watched 13 again
>told by the doctor not to be to close to the screen cause my eye sight gets worse
>watch ep 13
>glued to the screen
LmAO that picture xDD
WUU
wait wtf that mal rating!n
I didn't see any relic fragments laying around at the end scene, looked carefully
Bikki would just come back even after she died
like I always see the same 15 anime in their lists
nah they only do popular anime
Bikki is
it's funny imo
we all knew it would be bullshit, it's symphogear, there is no such thing as common sense or logic
BRILLIANT
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
reeeeeeeeeeeee
it was so annoying
like he mentioned symphogear once ina video I think
I don't watch him anymore, somehow the anime he didn't like were always the ones I liked and it wasn't enjoyable because of that, good video quality but meh taste for me
WTF
I just take this one as number one, didn't watch any of the other stuff xD
ahh ok then edited
bs that it is on the list?
?
like here

yea
haha
and half of it is older stuff too iirc
yea
BIKKI
I kinda want milaarc plushies
reviews are sometimes a dumbster set on fire
xtreme good vibes, discussion end
?
sounds good
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
it's in the credits of ep13
that's a song name
nothing on nyaasi
not all
yes!
I think it's good
downloaded all the currently available songs
I just listened to it and then noticed it's the one from ep1 xD
np
the long version is 5:48
Rikka Ryouran
not everything should be continued
because they think it won't be good
probably not
precious
doesn't it
but then detaching it just reverts the shit
seems too much of a stretch
the fools stone helped them that their ignite didn't get cancelled by the lapis
they just never mentioned it
and when
and how
I just noticed they never actually explained what amalgam really is
yea
~~wife~~
manager
I feel like Shirabe would have to watch her constantly so Kiri doesn't do too much dumb shit
latter I think
but if it contains spoilers?
yea, ik the site
ahh
ao3?
probably
hmm
all ears
I never saw any destroyed converter units, Illindus
so the symphogears would be needed all the time
would S.O.N.G. continue to exist?
yea
trust me, in 4 years I saw enough
League is more toxic
yea

saki had a scythe in mc
I Honkai Impact 3 they have Scythes :3 ~~or modded minecraft~~
yea that's why I try to avoid talking about her outside of here
uff carol in normal symphogear discussion
wait are you the viliml you uploaded the two songs on nyaasi?
already did
and idk what that means
but also different file type
wiki file is like 2mb smaller
rikka ryouran was on wiki before it was on nyaasi
angelic remnant is also on the wiki now
Rikka Ryouran is on the wiki
ok...
already out for 1.5 hours wo
both have no description
angelic remnant it says is from bd
and rikka ryouran
yea
15k of axz with tickets
26k was an estimate
and GENOCIDE
uff
the same in Danmachi s2 description
it has so much less members on mal but the best score

https://twitter.com/AngelPhoenix919/status/1179886330169450496?s=20

what?

how about this?
it has "blade" in the tweet
https://twitter.com/ChuuniOniika/status/1131952963273076742?s=20
```sword```


tuna sword
hmm ok ⚔
was my message deleted because it had no sword?

it's relaxing music, I first tried XDU music, I don't think that's the best one to study
ok thx, I'll try that, also got myself some different music, maybe that will help me too
does anyone know how to motivate oneself to study when the brain outright refuses it, like I wanna study but at the same time I want to do sth else that's not annoying and I just can't get myself straight, and I have no clue where this is coming from, I have a fucking final exam but that doesn't seem to be enough stress to convince me to study...
currently also using this thing to keep my hands busy while studying, also helps, me at least
https://youtu.be/sms1GfHuTWs
anyone knows what that pewdiepie adl thing is about? just saw that video from jt because it was recommended, does any *know* something more?
I don't visit this channel so was confused about the ping
ahh
<@132019566497890304>
What do I know?
and now bye to serious chat again
I have my plans for the future and what I want to do xD
Lol I didn't mean to go that much into it
It wasn't meant that serious
No worries
It's just like, sudden mood swings out of nowhere unexplainable and I just want a goddamn explanation but I can't find on
anyone has experience with just randomly getting annoyed by your parents or maybe other people and no clue why it happens`?
when you're working on something take a short break, go to the kitchen, but then a parent talks to you, you get annoyed, forget what you wanted to do in the first place and then go back to your room and lost all motivation to do actual work for your classes
it's not just pso2
it's a whole fucking chain of events that makes me feel stressed out and idk what to do
I already did goddamnit
I need some advice
I feel like I just get more stressed out and stressed day by day
Maybe it started since my mother started working from home and I haven't really had any break from my parents since
It feels like recent events that just keep screwing me over and everything just keeps getting worse
Like last week I genuinely had fun in League of Legends again but also got invested into it again -> most games that week were shit and not a lot of fun but then I had one game which was amazing but just at the end of the game, it just fucking up and crashes, I have to restart the fucking pc and we lose while I'm still loading and it just feels shit that I can't enjoy it
or now since wednesday, I'm trying to get pso2 to work, at least 12 hours actively working to get it to start or not crash
but nope just nothing works
and all that adding up currently really stresses me out and I feel like I'm having a mental breakdown or just short before one
Does anyone know how I could deal with that situation because I'm just at a loss right now and don't know what to do anymore
My mother just loses her temper with the smallest stupidest fucking things
While in the garden I sit down at the table I accidentally hit my father's arm, who is currently pouring coffee, and some spills. And she just straight and up loses it.

But when she does a mistake and then talk to her in the next few hours she also loses her temper.
You just can never make it right for her.

Then she asks me if I want to go inside again and I just said yes.
She is just way too annoying at times and complains about the most minute shit
Und dass ich jetzt am heulen bin, confirms it for me that it's just not a small problem but I have no clue how to solve any of that shit
Just to need vent a bit

Einfach mit meiner Mutter zu reden bringt mich manchmal fast zur Weißglut, nur ein paar Sätze und ich bin schon angepisst. It just feels completely illogical why I have those fucking mood swings, just earlier I was feeling all ok and it was a nice slow day und dann einfach nur 5 Sätze mit meiner Mutter über was total irrelevantes machen mich ein wütend und ich fühl mich als ob ich was zerschlagen will.
Es fühlt sich so an, als ob das jetzt immer häufiger auftritt. I feel like I need a break but I just can't take one as there are no fucking possibilites to do so right now.
Just every day I wake up and hear my mother complaining in the room next to me about her fucking colleagues doing some shit and that's just how the day starts. Gestern war's auch nur scheiße und ich hab einfach niemanden mit dem ich mich damit grad ordentlich unterhalten kann.
Then even more that adds to it, my parents just argue so much at times about stuff, where they should just calmly sit together for once and talk like adults instead of always just half listening to the other and accepting it.
Und all die Scheiße häuft sich einfach an und ich hab keine Ahnung wie ich das alles rauslassen soll.
```Just talking to my mother makes me nearly go crazy, just a few sentences and I'm already pissed. It just feels completely illogical why I have those fucking mood swings, just earlier I was feeling all ok and it was a nice slow day und then just 5 sentences about something completely irrelevant make me angry and want to punch something.
It feels like it's happening more and more. I feel like I need a break but I just can't take one as there are no fucking possibilities to do so right now.
Just every day I wake up and hear my mother complaining in the room next to me about her fucking colleagues doing some shit and that's just how the day starts. Yesterday was shitty too and I feel like I have no one to really talk about this.
Then even more that adds to it, my parents just argue so much at times about stuff, where they should just calmly sit together for once and talk like adults instead of always just half listening to the other and accepting it.
Und all the shit just piles up and I have no idea how to let those feelings out to feel better.
Und that I'm now crying after this, confirms it for me that it's just not a small problem but I have no clue how to solve any of that shit```

basically it in complete english now
I just went with the English I was currently thinking in´
Or where I knew the word faster
my brain, when writing it, was not able to process everything in English
We did back and forth anm bit, so it seems like I'm no saying anything dumb, but I just don't know how to handle it myself.
A friend's dog just died, another died not too long ago, and I wanna try and at least emotionally support her but I feel like I'm not helping in any way.
Gott verdammte Scheiße
ahhhh and today won't be any better
I have to work with another guy at work and explain him the whole script that we are using and how to use it effectively while having to figure out how to use it effectively
this is GREAT
Ok.
The 3rd party company assigned some new guy to us.
But that person will only arrive on **FUCKING MONDAY** 
So I'll see what happens then, if they are still dodgy about what the fuck is going on, then I'm definitely gonna get their asses.
Ohh yea definitely, I think
But I have no clue how I'd do that
I'm just filled with rage right now
I was told to sign by october 11th to get paid
signed october 10th, I have proof of that
 and then they have the audacity to say I didn't
so they will at least, hopefully, pressure them legally so this shit gets resolved
my employer is paying them
it's over some shitty 3rd party company because my employer doesn't have a subsidiary in germany, so employment gets fucky wucky otherwise
rant:
MY FUCKING GOD I WANT TO RIP SOMEONE HEADS OFF
I HAVEN'T BEEN PAID IN **2 FUCKING MONTHS** BECAUSE OF **ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT** AND WHEN THE ONLY ANSWER I GET IS THAT THE PAYROLL DATE WAS MISSED SO THAT I GET FUCKING PAID NEXT MONTH
**BUT** THEY ARE SO FUCKING GENEROUS AND GIVE ME SOME MONEY THIS MONTH BUT THE MONEY I'M STILL OWED IS DELAYED **ANOTHER FUCKING MONTH**
AND I DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE ANYMORE SINCE MOTHERFUCKING SEPTEMBER
THIS IS JUST SO BRAIN NUMBINGLY STUPID
I CAN'T COMPREHEND IT
they want a copy of the letter I got from the health insurance company and tell me to send it
I send it
**AFTER THAT THEY GIVE ME INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SEND IT PROPERLY**
why couldn't they just give those the moment they tell me to send it
god this is awful
hmm ok
ohh ok
incel?
ik rakhi, that was the start of the conversation
have to go, brb
I just really hope they don't fuck up Kumo desu ga, nani ka? cause that would be such a shame
didn't read that
they are fucking stupid, like he saved them and they still think he is a useless pos but actually they are
yea good summary
I read the manga and stopped cause it was just stupid how everyone kept getting into his way
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
yuck
did shield hero really get a new season announced?
the boobs are at fault
if you watch shield hero you already are rick rolled https://preview.redd.it/y3lpjmgx16l31.jpg?width=640&height=443&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=73987547a17947f4c9182216d8343f5736b8d185
what are you reading/watching?
what?
read the manga, I remember it so it wasn't bad
that shit sells itself
anime by the same studio that made hellsing ultimate
love it
that one
japan
idk how that played out just read the summary
ohh truck-kun
also one about a guy obsessed with vending machines, when a truck was about to run over a vending machine he jumped in front of it
did you hear about being reincarnated as a hot spring, partially ok manga, dunno about ln/wn
ok
what?
wtf
yepp
wholesome!
killing slimes for 300 years?
https://www.novelupdates.com/nauthor/funa/ this author makes some nice isekai
bit weird but not bad
yea not bad
ohh that one
could I get a link to the ln?
there are so many like that
which one?
I forgot the name though
there was one where a girl and a guy got reincarnated and both of them were fucking powerful and could level countries, of course the guy was stronger and looked generic, and suddenly they have weakpoints which the enemies exploit...
iirc cheat magician wasn't the worst
yea kumo looked so weird and the dragon was such bad cg
ok
wanna see it?
I really wanna believe in the Kumo desu ga, nani ka? adaptation but idk because I saw the pv for that and it was weird...
I gave up on all isekai anime adaptations 😄
arifureta manga is quite good but the whole story changes into more comedy later on and doesn't keep the dark tone of the cave chapters
Ookami Shounen wa Kyou mo Uso o Kasaneru
wholesome love story about a guy who has a crush on a girl, gets forced to cross dress and helps the girl get over her fear of men
mind fuckery is good!
rewatching Death Note, it's just good
|| ~~boku no pico watch party~~ ||
urgs
even if people already watched something, some gladly rewatch
just ask people on this server
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227> that
some episodes of psycho pass which I really wanna continue
and there is more of it
not really watching a lot of anime anymore, reading manga or ln or wn is kinda more enjoyable
heh?
I just want a full page at once
*shrugs* hmm then that's that but I don't really like VNs in general, too less text at once
idk if I wanna use my switch for reading
I have one
yea but big
switch*
ehmm reading on a siwtch
huh ok
I read manga on phone too
I just bought a new phone not too long ago
good enough of an excuse?
*sigh* and I also don't like reading on pc
i don't really do visual novels
I came to hate these generic asses
ok, probably gonna read if there is something to read cause that mc looks awful
this one https://myanimelist.net/anime/34620/Kono_Yo_no_Hate_de_Koi_wo_Utau_Shoujo_YU-NO?q=yu%20no ?
on the hentai
5.04
ok
old?
I found a hentai by that name
I wanna know
hehehe
it has Kumo art style of the LN and not the manga
has subs
https://youtu.be/Nqu4D8P_oLQ
for it *
gonna look fie jt
wait a moment
there was some unique art style in there which was interesting but then that dragon
that dragon makes me shiver
but I saw the pv for the anime <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Aoi Yuuki as VA of mc
it's going to have an anime adaptation soon
already caught up to it last year I think

since November 25 last year there hasn't been another Kumo desu ga, nani ka? chapter
big <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
there are good isekai wn, ln, some less manga and when anime comes around a lot gets lost often..
when adaptations would at least be decent
some sources 9 chapters other 22
seems like translation for Release the Spyce manga came to a halt
fucking funny and amazing, I can assure you 1000000000%
it gets really good I tell you
then I won't tell where I am cause spoiler
ahh ok
have stopped reading around 9X
manga is amazing
kinda anti climactic what happened
because a tense fight shouldn't be interrupted by silly only if that's the theme
twice, ok then it's kinda stupid, once may be ok, but twice is more like milking it
forgot who he was xD
ahh that guy
last thing I watched besides Symphogear was Isekai Quartet which was actually pretty enjoyable
I like the manga
already since the start of the year I think
I not really into watching anime for some time now, dunno why
hmm ok
that was another I wanted to watch -.- friend of mine also really liked it and it seems really funny, and now I barely watch anything expect Symphogear... 

does it have a manga?
ohhh wow Hakai Me No Yuuri ended 1 year ago. I have to read that one again, damniz
so much isekai trash <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I love Black Bullet
...cool dad
ohh it's longer than usual
the girl
that hair, who is that?
sinon friend, who was the ||rape guy|| was saying he wasn't so good and was only able to make so much money to pay the monthly fee iirc
that was explained in s2
yea, that one was monthly
what's weird is, that when she got the gear she played numerous titles but didn't they all cost money or is everything f2p <:GWllentThinkPika:405460903182598164>
the nervegear that they're developing irl will use microwaves
maybe the microwaves of the gear did something to her brain
xDD

good that it wasn't a gun spirit like it Hellsing xD
ggoa was really cool
mollusks?
where is dr ver
louise type is blargh
she isn't a right out ||bitch||
the opening is great and it's a lot of fun and a tsundere I enjoy
hehe
ok, GJ-Bu is amazing, finally an anime again that I want to watch : D
: )
*no nitro*
haha
nice
AMVs are responsible for a lot of anime I watched
watching some AMVs, posted the GJ-Bu one in <#447132690349555712> and it looks good
How is GJ-Bu, thinking about watching it
uff
it was one day earlier
missed thw subbed one
even had a good german dub, watched in cinema with friends
fucking amazing
ik that it is canon
watched the movie several timea already
ahh ok
both just watched a lot and rewatched
I also need to read ngnl
huh ok
i need to read that shiz
SEQUEL
?!?!!?!!!!!?
WHATTTTTTT
the one 12 minutes ago
cypher, where is that cover from??m
that one good
Jahy onsen chapter was great

love Tanya's eyes
I just haven't found a hook rn, so maybe first movie would that faster
once started but stopped after a few episodes
I think ik how to get myself to watch the show
ok
wtf nanoha recommended watch order, can't see through it xD
I don't like that really, I want everything in the show.
VNs meh for me, watching someone play it ye but alone meh
ahh, yea I felt that kinda
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
wack in what sense?
I like nanoha from what I saw and heard and because of the art and wanna get hooked on it quick, kinda
so I watched already a few episodes of nanoha s1 a a few months? back and wanna watch again but not sure if s1 or m1, what would you recommend? idk at which ep I stopped
nyaasi maybe too
^LmAO
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690> tiddies are good
and the start of season two with that trial or what it was, was also something I hated
aqua is just too annoying for me
konosuba comedy is not my thing..
ok, let's dig in, will write about it maybe later in spoilers channel because some still didn't watch and want to
first need to take out the dog and then it's time
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I'm gonna go with m1 for now as first one because I wanna get hooked
interesting
ohh
uff
CUTTING OUT FLUFFEH!!??!?!?
but if it's missing plot I would like to have all the plot first and then maybe something similar to a recap movie with kinda the best moments again or sth
m1 then maybe s1, s2 then m2
gonna go with that for now and then see from there
s1 what I watched so far looked fine to me so I don't think s2 art would push me away
movie tonight and then probably bed xD
thx
hmm ok
üff
link?
thought dled
ahh ok
windirstd I think it's called is a program to see what takes up how much space
this is what I downloaded
wtf
also has soundtrack
I downloaded a batch file of off nyaasi
I think it's because I didn't delete the zip files but idk xD
the folder where my nanoha stuff is in is over 100GB
ouch
time to rewatch "NANOHA The MOVIE 1st" ~~that is a name, idk why~~ and try to find some emote worthy stuff
I read a manga called One Room or similar once, a girl wanted to get kidnapped by her stalker because she wanted to get away from family, was also quite good
Devil is a Part-Timer, heard great things about it , tried watching anime, manga could be better, is often the case for me
RE:Zero, watched, didn't finish s1, better than konosuba but also not great, Overlord LN is better
np
not that one xD
nope
or also more drama
a good romance with a bit of drama I like
LN mostly isekai (a lot), but open to other stuff
before nanoha, which manga/LN would you recommend buying? got some gift cards from recent bday
can't wait but will wait a bit
haha
kk
?
new character`
huh?
s2 nanoha soon
^good one#
like he watches anime when he cooks and so he always has to look at the screen when watching with subs
because he can't do anything else than
my father doesn't like sub
my father is listening to bunny girl senpai in german, it's not good
the 40GB one

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is supposed to be very wholesome, friend told me that
I really need to catch up with that one+
ahh ok
Hone ga Kusaru Made
group of friends meet every year in a cave and look at a skeleton, one day that skeleton gets stolen, good story
ahh ok
ohh
ohh what
or earlier?
Kaguya-sama around chapter 90 changes I think it was, some time ago, changes quite a bit, less 4koma ish and more in-depth
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
0.o
have you heard of the manga called Senki Zesshou Symphogear, that one is amazing and I heard it even has a very popular anime, which some praise as the greatest of all time
btw a nice romance manga which I love a lot is called Ookami Shounen wa Kyou mo Uso o Kasaneru
that one is one of my favorites
ok, I found the fantl
ahh
ohh nice
uff
and then shipping time
june and august
ohh wait, release 2020
volume 1 and 2 of LN are on the site where I got the gift cards to :3
xD
wholesome yuri, I think I can get behind this
easily
hmm
https://myanimelist.net/anime/39790/Adachi_to_Shimamura wait, it's going to have an anime soon? listed
I typed that in and it is suggesting "Scholarly articles for **adachi and shimamura**"
ok
adashima, what is the full name?
monogatari is cool, only watched anime in a bit of a weird order and not all though
haha
I could probably try reading a but online and if I like it buy it
I didn't know Eternal Blaze was A's's opening, love this song
ekushibu
kk thx
is A's actually meant to spell Ace??
legal?
time for A's

main girl looks so cute
wtf it looks so good and opening got me
and nothing shall get in my way
ok, one episode of Katanagatari, then some stuff and then finally Nanoha
Kekkon Yubiwa Monogatari/Tales of Wedding Rings seems interesting, can anyone tell me more about that one if you know it?
oh oh oh Higanbana no Saku Yoru ni
horror manga with different arcs, not a lot of chapters sadly but totally worth it when you're into horror
ever heard of Helck, that was one great story and I want more
gonna, give it a try later this night
please
does anyone have any info on whether Accel World Dural Magisa Garden is ever gonna be fully translated?
wtf the german cover for slime is so bad
last volume is available on a website where I sometimes buy manga from
fan tl stopped but official is even available in german I just found out so maybe fan tlers were told to stop or sth
the actual series is finished but translation has halted completely
the spin off is very interesting
and that year was its whole runtime
last chapters from 2017
anyone knows where I can get the Macross delta sub files, .ass or what it is
only really interested in Freyja Wion, she is so cute
hmm ok thank you for the info
and will probably start watching Macross Delta at some point, seems like it's optional where to start that one cause different casts each season
and Nanoha 9 and 10, maybe 11 later, gonna be finished with A's tomorrow
more Nanoha today
uhh gold saw
the hand tries to pick something
nah don't you see the dvds in the shelves?
lol
[hwat] Musashi Gundoh
https://nyaa.si/?f=0&c=1_2&q=Musashi subs
Strikers soon
hype is rising
wuu
end fight
watching last 3 episodes of nanoha A's in a few minutes
nvm
so still alicization?
huh ok
wait it has a new season?
*silenced*
uff
wait, StrikerS is 10!!! years after A's
haha
I lost some brains cells reading both their messages
what?
The manga also always has deep psychological analysises(?) of IT's mind and his action, that part is very interesting to me aswell
reading ch 1 already has mr at the feels again
IT always takes om other forms and is also immortal
At first it's an orb, IT can take any form, first IT was a rock, then moss, at some point an exhausted wolf came by and died IT took on the wolf's shape. IT later found a human, when that human died IT took on the human's shape and IT started to gain more of a conscience.
Time to start reading "To you, the Immortal" again, haven't touched it in a while, should get through 100 chapters before sleeping
Finished that Mahou Shoujo manga, everything that's currently out, really good, nice story progression
maybe you can ask lily
idk how self promotion is handled here
good timed comedy with epix battles
this manga is fucking great
thanks
hmm then probably not, but the mahou shoujo one seems like a good fit
ohh yea Mahou Shoujo too
Is parallel paradise just about ecchi or also some action?
Kekkon Yubiwa Monogatari is already in my list
horror comedy sol doesn't mix well for me
someone recommended me that yesterday already xD
wasn't really my type
need a good manga recommandation
either a good isekai, something with horror but not necessarily with gore (similar to Tenkuu Shinpan or Sekai Oni), or some dumb action, not shounen, but just like dumb
does anyone have any suggestions?
lol why that
you'll only know when you already read a bit
the synopsis of the story is so good xD
Ok, gonna re read Hakai Me No Yuuri
One of the best isekai webnovels I ever reasadly finished but I did not leave disappointed
waiting all days for new chapters to arrive, that feeling of having to wait and be annoyed by the cliff hangers but then getting satisfaction, it is good
Ohh wait wtf they also did Apotheosis of a Demon, that bunny girl isekai

how am I noticing only now
same author
ok, same universe
First in Demon Noble Girl and now Demon Maid
how the fuck did it appear here too
There was already enough in that other story
OH MY GOD
Please not seaweed again
it's just soo weird
this mc is one of the weirdest I have encountered so far. but not bad(I think)
This cooking paragraph in an isekai webnovel:
``Next, I slice off a few pieces from a hunk of salted pig carcass and drop them onto a heated frying pan. As the fat begins to ooze out of the slices of dead meat, I crack open the shell of some unborn creature to drop a viscous glob full of protein into the pan. To finish, I take a lump of kneaded-and-baked carbohydrate and lightly toast it in the oven, then place everything onto white tableware while I wait for the brown rotten leaves to release their color into the hot water.``
Just found "Ni## Meccha" in a web novel I'm reading, anyone knows that reference?
Context: 
``The absolute evolving defence
Based on Ni## Meccha``
all isekai are trash; some less, some more
and I enjoy them<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-strongest-hokage/ <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
pripri
flipflap
girls last tour
made in abyss
land of the lustrous
good choices
others idk much about
I still have to start that one
ahh
thx
ahh ok
quick question, is this "tto" some kind of speach tick like desu or does it mean something?
I wanna watch it kinda, but not really cinema, cinema is nice and all but it's outside...
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
I read No Guns Life as No Game No Life
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
ISEKAI
?
I still need to watch that one
gooday
and even that was probably damaged at some point, ||so bai bai memories||
yikes
how much does of the original Phos remain rn? it's like nearly nothing anymore...
Phos' whole character changed too much, I liked the carefree one it was at the beginning much more
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
......
.....
ahh right
but the clothes that Phos had that one time....
I don't remember how it looked anymore
uff
ohh yea that too cypher
the moon aesthetics are meh
I just don't like how it looks in general anymore
and it's also weird that their looks change so much
||moon|| is just "Why??" in my mind
yea...
wanna go to <#377148557796442134> no need to spoiler tag there
Just started watching K and ep2 with the naked catgirl was just "WTF!?!?!?!"
lol
gonna read now, bye
ik what you mean, I just used it as a loose example
yea, I understand that
yt channel about mostly isekai and fate
and some major stuff wasn't shown, especially in season 3 from what AniNews said
but they fucked with the timeline a bit
1 season 13 episodes
2-3 volumes to 1 season of Overlord, that was it for season 1 to 3
if it's 95% then it's pretty good in comparison to other isekai, for example Assassin's Pride where like 20 manga chapters are 2-3 episodes, I heard from a friend
I already have Acsendance of a Bookworm in my backlog actually, once searched some new stuff to read on NU, maybe gonna read that when I'm finished with Chongfei Manual
btw, heard you talking about Bookworm a lot here, what is the full title?
is 5 episodes good or bad to contain everything?
lol
?
Parts of the trailer are nice, others I don't wanna talk about and then there is Shun, who I hate with a passion
yea is old
thx a lot <:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
Ahh ok
where is this from haha
will go through the other stuff too, gonna bookmark it : D
14-sai no kou seems like it will be really good <:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
huh, gonna read some chapters
arigatou
or just novels
ehhh thx for the effort but not really into fanfics
not really into watching anime rn
I know about that one but didn't really strike me as something I'd wanna watch atm
hi, does anyone know any really good romance stories to read
just finished Chongfei Manual and am now craving for some nice and heart warming romance
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
food <:yummy:235243310086750208>
if they would have grouped up and taken on big armies or big evil guys then I think it would have been better
ehh
and?
yes
tanks*
then you need tnaks
like if you don't have enough dmg
if you have infinite dmg
^
but then that would have needed explanation I think
but they at least need a tank person, just charging in without anyone aggroing or stuff is more stupid and risky
yea, and the stuff with "shields are bad" WHY? tanks are essential
I endured the manga for a while and then they were on an island and the other heroes should have finally learned a bit but NO, they too stupid and that just was it for me
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
fuck shield hero
shield girl is cool!
lul, was so confused that she was just called Myne. in wn translation it was Maine
and also I just read Cut & Paste where the male MC is called Myne xD
The story doesn't go mich anywhere and doesn't seem to have much I enjoy

Leaving it on a reading list for now, gonna continue Cut & Paste which I left for some time
ok, gonna read now, see ya
yea
like in Kumo it is
MC suddenly has ||a scythe|| which seems to even be somewhat important in the story and I was so confused that I never heard of it even though it came up in vol 7 ln which was already covered in wn
it made me feel so annoyed that I bought the next 2 volumes that I still didn't had

but then afterwards I cancelled the order again

idk why or what was gping through my head <:BikkiFacepalm:398808522952933377>
But sometimes you wanna get both because stuff changes, like I recently found out in Kumo....
heh
wn it is then
ok
aiii
finding lincensed LNs online can be not so straightforward sometimes, because of the English publisher doesn't want it or it's just not allowed or it's just copied and not translated
online, no app for the files rn
:3
could you send me a link to the ln, it's not on NU
but also her really obsessed was kinda weird in the first chapter where she would love to die from books falling on her
I heard it's good so I wanted to try it
hmm, ok will try to get there and see how she changes
was ch3 of wn
how long do I have to go for it to get better?
Currently 3 chapters into Bookworm webnovel
don't really like the mc
does it get aby different and I just have to wait a bit or does she always have these weird expectations?
not the best
then s2 should be good
just watch it without expectations
ahh
how does it disappoint
?
ahh ok
but good
lol
also a manga it seems
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-small-sage-will-try-her-best-in-the-different-world-from-lv-1/ that the one I'm talking about
ahh my internet is being annoying, 3G network too overloaded
sadly don't know much more -.-
sadly don't know much more -.-
it's a really cute one from the 9 chapters that are translated
Anyone here has read Little Sage?
iirc the full name is The Little Sage will try her best in her New Life
so I can't watch it
There is a TV station here that shows K-On!
But mostly my mother is in the living room and she hates anime
because the more you experience, the more it changes your view on things and makes you understand them better
ahh ok
ahh ok
they had ovas?
in the main series
I didn't even know there was one
I only heard some stuff about alicization from gigguk before I stopped watching his vids
I haven't watched that
I can only watch anime with friends rn otherwise not really into it
I'd say it is an isekai if you take isekai as more than just the literal meaning "another world"
I like sao, but people just loved hating on it because it got thems views on yt
yea
2013
ohh log horizon was earlier than overlord
overlord
2015
when did Overlord air?
yes
I once heard the reason there isn't more is because the characters(designs) aren't original properties by the author of ngnl but another person and that person doesn't allow another season
I only know it's great
lol
already posteed
"mematic as headtilt"
never thought I'd hear that
I just read "Nanoha Shippuden" that would be a show
still have Nanoha downlaoded too
I have it downloaded but haven't come around
yes
"no idea"
that's just the humor between the two
Loli Witch c11 part 2 just got released, really cool web novel about an immortal selfproclaimed witch
She has "Creation Magic" with which she can create anything but still needs a lot of mana to create big ass things and stuff, so she has to level up to create more complex and stronger things
noice
YuYuYu is nice
nice
lol
fanservice isn't necessarily lewd
btw
lol
all fanservice is necessary
lel
now I watch a lot Nux just
he talked about Just Because! once and said it was just very uneventful but I absolutely loved the show for having amazing characters with nice love stories
I just don't liked watching it anymore, hearing stuff that I just disagree with
the ones he always said were uninteresting, were the ones I loved and it annoyed me hearing all the time
and I just increasingly disagreed with his opinions on animes
No, then he mentioned Symphogear XV and then cockblocked with FUCKING MOMSEKAI WHICH IS A SHIT SHOW
I used to like him
gigguk...
Nux jsut takes the piss on everyone
it's for real
...
smoking is bad
maybe in his latest video he said something
haven't watched it yet
nux?
I only read the manga
NANACHI
good anime
yes
the scar on her forehead just looks so stupid that it's annoying me <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
maybe lucky enough to use my father's laptop
ok, nope won't have my pc back on Saturday
they only have open for 4 hours
might be able to watch on phone, or lucky enough that they can figure out my pc problem before they close
will see
tomorrow will bring my pc away to let people find out whats wrong with it
hmm looks interesting
really good
Higanbana no Saku Yoru Ni
I know a toilet ghost
but that a manga
idk that one
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
but otherwise it can also be older stuff
probably shield girl first
<:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>
but 1pm -> 7pm works for me
Sundays I mostly chill and don't use the pc
you also work on saturdaays?
and I go to bed then most of the time
because it will be midnight for me
uff
so it's currently 12pm for you?
yikes
currently playing some LoL with a couple of friends
sure micha, if you have time later
lol
or does anyone want to watch together?
In the past I binged 1 to 2 seasons of something in a day, but now I'd rather read
idk why
watching anime alone at the moment, I don't really like it
I have so much other stuff to read too and the webnovel has really bad grammar rn so I don't wanna read that further because I hate it so much <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I read more of the manga and webnovel
of the anime, 1 episode
I didn't know this
wait what they have a guild now?
so weird
I watched some haruhi and when I came to the repeating thing I at first didn't even notice it but after some time I thougth, wait am I actually just rewatching the same episode over and over and then I found out it's a intentional
lol

Rail guntz
add a Z
yea, really cool
ohh I haven't seen that before
https://youtu.be/aht9ZSwpMCk reminds me of this
yea some stuff looks weird, but mostly just with thin fast moving lines
my friend has a program where he can upscale videos
it uses AI to upscale and not just simpler algorithms
uhh
the possibility to torrent is also always there
I avoid most sites with ads because some ads can look really disgusting and make me feel unwell

17
wow
still an amazing site
so sad they had to shut down
no ads
use funimation and crunchy subs
is what I use
https://twist.moe
masterani.me -.- 
was a very good site
``Itai no wa Iya nano de Bougyoryoku ni Kyokufuri Shitai to Omoimasu.`` look where the bofuri is in that
just call it shield girl, so much less weird
but why bofuri, that is so far into the name and seems so random
or konosuba
sounds good
kazuma is an ok char, I don't like konosuba in general, meh show for me
what
only watched a few eps of jojo 1
I know 1 is accel but don't really know a lot about him
1 5 6 I have no clue about, the rest I approve of
post cypher
doit
Trinity Seven is something that I actually still like to watch besides not liking ecchi at all anymore
<:ChrisYUM:681697737603022865>
yea
lol
1 6 10 are good
what does genki girl mean, like generally just feeling good?
ahh k
careful, the spoiler zone is over there -> <#377148557796442134> :3
**FireZero** was typing
> i meant electrocute derp
the people insulting trans people can't come up with more
some people use it as an insult against trans people
some people here don't take the word ||trap|| too kindly
I think so
could only maybe do a low poly dog
I will probably do a dog at some point but not rn
currently wanna finish my Kumoko project
but making that is more ehh
would first need a model of the dog
and dog n eeds to go out
I already have 1/3 of the animation
Ohh fuck new Mahou Tsukai no Yome chapter is out, have to read but also need to go out with dog!!
noice
there
ahh
huh what?
lmao
I now know
am I missing something?
Ass
Never finished April
I'm crying now even though I finished the show years ago
I cried a lot I think
hmm yea
I like Kaede
Kaede
ass class!!!
ahh
drug?
Should I watch "Weathering with you" ?
I think I'm gonna get back to reading Tower of God
still have to catch up there, always just stopped reading
Started reading Solo Leveling yesterday
Caught up to chapter 110
It's really amazing, lot of action
k
how many eps does it have?
I have to rewatch it
uhh that one was so cool
YES
MAI HIME
against ainz she did no dmg in s1
What news
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
hey you're notaya, not aya
who are you?
oh hi Aya
ohh
amq again at some point?
vignette
Spice and Wolf was also interesting
Lotta econimics xD
xD
ohh
?
But there is also that part of things faling on Naotsugu all the time
it's great
4 atm
I'MN SORRY
I AM
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
I just found out I never watched s2 of Log Horizon, what have I done <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
how the fuck am I still tyoing masterani.me out of muscle memory <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
cross ange right that was the name
watching log horizon
what
why did they do this
yea very weird


could be because I only watch s2 rn and haven't watched s1 in some time
didn't really notice
ohh
yikes
?
Natsu's and Shiro's equipment doesn't really look that much different than before even though they said it's new
Akatsuki is a bit different
And I think that's it
Looks all good as s1
currently stopped at ep 16 for today
Date a vase! Date a vase! Just shitting in the data base!
Log Horizon?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
same with NGNL
yea
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
I think I might not even have finished season 1 because I can't remember when at all the whole ||Lenessia + Crusty|| happened
what about her
Lenessia is ok, isn't that overwhelming imo
I just mean both versions on the same page, stick with one version
very nice
ohh I also saw just now that they changed William's hair
the same way as Marielle but this was a good change
like how is serara older than 12
!
In Log Horizon, one problem I have with some armor designs is for example this head piece
if it's protecting from attacks to the head, it doesn't look like it would do a good job
Like and attack from the top would maybe get caught but also push the armor down and still hit the head
Or how does it work??
Yea
gut
they missed an E when thinking of the title
ahh seeing that german kinda hurts
*Das Final*
outside and wfc will be happy I think
what about bottom gundam
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MLuwuzQd_I
I just remembered the best gundam song
wait
haven't watched any gundam
wanted to watch iron blooded orphans at some point
haha
This too https://youtu.be/SXItubV9_k8
yes
THAT
https://youtu.be/ob7pebouMmk
RAISE YOUR FLAG
cross ange was really fun to watcg
evangelion movies are cool, never watched the tv series
I watched it
I know
WTF
> the problem with the anime was that it went too ham with the fanservice
same with "How not to summon a Demon Lord"
too much in the anime
manga is great
:p
not me, I need to go with the dog, bye
I liked it because it was stupid and  they yuri probably
Fate/Zero then Fate/Kaleid for me
lol same
have it all downloaded but need to watch
nanoha first season and second moive
fate kaleid watched all
manga was better as the story at the end of the anime was meh
seems like they didn't plan for more seasons so they just make a quick ending
Mahou Shoujo Site I enjoyed the manga and anime a lto
Madoka tv series (still need to watch the movies)
later on it went to Yuki Yuuna was Yuusha de Aru
also watched a bit of Phantom Thief Jeane
both of these were before I knew what an anime really was
> What's the first Magical Girl show you've watched as a child
Sailor Moon, watched together with my mother, was pretty fun
ahh

cypher don't worry about that log hoirzon 0/25
I am at 16
ehmm


lemme try to find the tweet that he send after the conversation
over 1 hour discussion in twitter dms
someone tried really hard to convince me watching at some point and it was kinda funny
idk the number but it was after ||they make their new kingdom/country whatever that thing was and then went over 1million people, I didn't continue because Kamina was dead and all the characters just seemed like total idiots and it was more cringy than fun to watch||
I once had a very funny conversation with someone telling me to continue watching it after I stopped at a certain point
have fun
yea
didn't like it
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
gurren lagan.......
I just always call her Kuro
some website was just stupid

angel beats anime
what
wait

I don't remember that from the manga
last update 17th of december
ohh wtf only 8 chapters of the one posted are translated .-.-
goddamnit my read list is already full enough
sounds interesting
I liked it way more in "Kumo desu ga, nani ka?"
The split personality council is an interesting thing but didn't really catch me
ehh
The scar, when she was small, was the most annoying thing ever
lul
hf
uff
And it wasn't covered by warranty
Or at least the company said they couldn't do anythign
You'd need to get the platters into another housing
€€€
but
yes
you'd need to read the platters directly to get the data
a collegue of my mother looked into the drive and he said it might be the controller that moves the reader, that's broken
it doesn't work
even if you try to reformat the drive
thing is
yikes
At home we had a 1TB HDD that just stopped working one day
with a lot of family photos on it that were on another HDD before and of course my mother deleted the photos from the old one
yikes
low amount of storage...
Mine is 2/3 full xD
nice
I'm hyped for when I have to pay no money to server providers anymore and just use my pc as a server
but rn that wouldn't be too good of an idea
xD
wotr
lol pretzell
urghhh with the sounds that is so bad
I think I'll stick to magna
lol
dunno what sarazanmai is
gleipnir is interesting
you mean that demon lord in him? when they were trapped in a small pocket
wot
is the kid
Alchemist Girl
that is that one
what's the other
"The Eternal Library and the Alchemist Girl" is one of them
Alchemist girl
wait both
did you watch the movie?
ohh yea Trinity Seven is fucking amazing
a really cool battleschool anime
it's very interesting
Irregular at magic highschool is also cool
xD
fuck I also need to watch that still
still the mc is always there and can make it annoying
reminds me, I need to watch Asterisk
maybe that's why I stopped watching most harems
and she is really dense
she is just a bit too stupid for my taste
the scar is most of the part
but for example how she instantly comes to the conclusion "I must learn farming!"
still
that X mark is just way to annoying when I see it
I hate the scar
When she is small
That scar is way to annoying
> What's your biggest anime unpopular opinion?
I can't understand the love for Bakarina
Hulu hates aya
lol
LOL
https://mangadex.org/title/48577/my-father-became-a-cute-vtuber-girl/comments/

Shiroyasha is a great pervert that makes Kurousagi wear nice clothes
+++++++
huh

wait, since when do you have Kurousagi as a pfp?
lol
also something I heard great things about

It is really fun and I'm not even past the stuff from ep1

anyway
urgs
it's fun
stopped watching gigguk until he mentioned symphogear in a video and cucked on it
nux is cool

https://myanimelist.net/anime/274/Kiddy_Grade anyone knows this show?
this aired on German tv at some point and I loved to watch it xD
lol
lol
they call each other sun and sunshine
love Yuuki Yuuna
||I would have liked it to have had some consequences too... at the end she completely recovered from the wheelchair, that was kinda ehh, same as in symphogear kinda, they don't follow through with it||
yep, definitely feels
wot
Does it matter how someone else thinks about the show
NO!
It doesn't, why would it matter. It's irrational.
WHY does it MATTER???
If Zero thinks it's het then the anime is het for him
And that#s ok
No one has to care how someone else enjoys something
I once got very strongly told by a Gurren Laggan fan that Simon is the protag of the anime because I think that Kamina is the main focus of the anime
I didn't change my opinion about it because that's how I want to see it
Nuker
^looks weird
never heard of
will see
silver haired isekai
there a lot of those
Kenja²
Kenja no Deshi wo Nanoru Kenja
yea kenja is a word used a lot
Simoun?
idk if the adaptation will be weird or if there is enough english novel of it
yea
https://myanimelist.net/anime/42071/Yuuki_Yuuna_wa_Yuusha_de_Aru_Churutto dafack is that synopsis
anyway, gotta shower, bye
not very good when you wanna play amq xD
both are good
Idk where I should start with a top 30
I think I could never do a top openings list
would need to be in a tournament bracket style and still then it would be hard to decide
The ass class op I never remember
Voracity?
Not Clattanoia?
Carlos, Database is #1 rest is after that
~~I need food~~
and manga is a very good adaptation already
english novel translation is only very slightly in front of the manga
seems like it wi adapt the novel
manga is pretty funny of this one
0.0
Kenja no Deshi wo Nanoru Kenja
https://anilist.co/anime/119056
who is a mega top and who is just top for fun
and then insert memes
who could kick each others ass harder
that one is really fucked up
interesting that Mnemosyne falls inside their "standards"
can't find them anywhere else?
Rin Daughter of Mnemosyne???
interesting
huh
never heard of a "save" edition for anything
weird
seems like it
hWat
translation I'm reading is very clean
dunno
reading over tachiyomi app
no pages indicating who translated it
I think it was the one from mangasee if I didn't change sites
anime is also good
haven't finished it though -_-
Love it
Yes!
ayahi takagaki ops
not very lucky in russian roulette I see
Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya, dess?

Have you heard of Symphogear?
Yuuki Yuuna
don't remember it being that strong in the manga
wow it's portrayed very gay in the anime
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
in the anime
ohh that
lol what

Prisma Illya

Assassin Illya was pretty cute
ehh which one was that
that episode was a trip
they converted 1 character to writing yaoi
definitely
that could also be friendship kinda, idk
that's also a memoria
remember the maid scene
maybe a bit
ohh
in what context?
no fucking clue
Rak best waifu
one's a lizard
the other looks human and has a horn
How the fuck did they mix up Androssi and Anaak

plutia is cute
> Jojo vs Eisidisi
ACDC?

ohh
which show are you talking about, shemmy, so I don't accidentally watch it
<@!453836798796234762>
I just don't like subs in German anymore, or also manga in German
feels weird
Sounds correct
sasageyo is still a banger
first season was nice but s2 came way to late for me to still care
not really care about aot
ehh
isn't that format normally with the guy on 3rd
same same
Shiro
I need to rewatch this
KAGUTSUCHI
lmao that maihime sub
urg Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear anime
her costume is beh
when reading the webnovel I thought it was way different, then read some of the manga and the costume is really beh
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097> bookworm
the icelandic dracula translation
the original translator, didn't just translate it
but rewrote the story in his own fanfiction
it was way more erotic, but still very good it seems
over a century or more no one noticed
like that icelandic dracula fanfic?
lol
the same can't be said about her face though
that looks very weird
not so much into that
after watching some episodes, I can say, twin tails have some allure to them
but only if they are done right and on good cute girls
haha
I haven't finished it
lol
but fun
it's stupid
yea
I don't think that's worth watching now smh
really?
yikes
lol
lol
cute²
she looks really cute
i need to watch this
wat
what is that
big ptw
lol
lol
and a lot of pokemon where I have no clue which season

nice
Eromanga sensei is ok, but the current arc is shit so I dropped it
Umaru I fucking hate
> How could it not?
also it was a rethorical question
I just said earlier that New Game is great xD
Same with Place further than the Universe

GuP seems too weird
K-On is cute
New Game was very funny

CGDCT???

there are over 100 chaoters
lol
definitely
Mahou Shoujo Site
from what group are you reading haha
nice extra panel
LmAO
Want a really really weird mahou shoujo manga?
Look up "Machigatta Ko WO Mahou Shoujo Ni Shite Shimatta"
Or "Oops! I made the wrong girl into a magical girl!"
blood and other things, while in a cute outfit
but she has to rescue the world
lol
Tenkuu Shinpan has some subtext yuri
The one girl would definitely jump into it
But the mc is just way too focused on something else
I mean, only one of them at a time
Hibiki or Miku
hehe
lol
nice
Oh which episode of Mnemosyne? Or all 6?
> Oh. I do like me some gay kisses
it is gay
but also VERY fucked up
I hate her personality
I wanted to see more Aya
when I came to the part where it cut to the girls from Sept I was kinda annoyed too
poor Aya
right
ohh yea
?
anime ending was annoying
still a good anime but from that ending you can definitely see that they don't play more seasons
the whole thing was fucked up and I loved it
yea, I did
gonna read it, then I know it again
which chapter was that
can't remember that character
Oreimo seems fun
https://youtu.be/rv6BsPOkBfA this is really great xD
she is very selfish
didn't perceive it as that fucked up
ohh that part
yikes
which stuff
ehh idk
brain farts
consuming sutff before watching anime maybe?
ohh
missed an a
dafack

LMAO
Madoka edge?? Like how?
Doesn't seem near enough to be
that's no edge fest LmAO
lol
it at least stays true to the edge all the way through
and the voices too
I prefer manga more because the motions and stuff are then in my imagination
I can see that
ye
what niko said
it's ok but not true to the manga
anime ending ehhhh
not a music focused anime
but I don't go with deicmals so 8
bit more that a 7.5 not quite an 8

so he is very occupied
but that one guy I often watch stuff with got soooo much school work because that pandemic
with friends it's amazing
nice
idk
haven't actively watched a lot of anime since 2018
only a few
watching anime rn is kinda hard
idk
need to watch
NO SPOILERS
Log Horizon is nice
waiting for s3 :3
Haven't finished s2 because the last part of it where they shift the focus is annoying
> Not a fan of Hibiki & Kanade constantly arguing with eachother.
so confused
KONEKO
NANA MUSIC BLESSES MY EARS
baout fucking time
time for StrikerS
Fuck it
I was just taking the name of the anime as an example
ahh ok
you know Schwarzes Marken
name of an anime and grammatically incorrect
AND fucking annoying to read xD
at least that german is grammatically correct
not like in some other animes
incorrect grammar just triggers me really hard
when you can still understand part of the video even though you can't read the subs or understand moon language xD
WHY
WHY MAKE A WISH KYUBEI
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>

<@!115744398997716995> WHAT
?
lol
hmm finally read Not Lives
it's a bit weird but I think when you get past the first 5 chapters it becomes a really good action manga with nice angles on some female characters
The plot is quite interesting and can some good suspension at other points it feels like enemies are just way too stupid and powerful
But it was a fun read nevertheless
dafack was that vid
sry for ping
I thought this was a joke
.
.
.
wait
sounds like I'd watch it
hahaha
Kirika
and Megumin va

genre?
need recommendations?
LmAO
only a few chapters though
I read an sao a ggo manga once
> its because TOEI actively blocked precure in the west before
<@!152896851660505088> why????
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432> <:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
wtf so read a new manga chapter of 80000 gold coins and wanted to look at how the webnovel stands
150 more chapters translated since I last looked
this one is a "cute girl does cute things in another world" anime
but it's gonna be a good one
when I looked into the manga
her bear costume was way too different than I imagined and I didn't like it
I like the webnovel of that one
https://twitter.com/kumoko_anime/status/1276349536823214080 HYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPEHYPE
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO THIS POINT PLEASE
?
my brain already failing me at 2129
I read "What about anime? She's too hot"
some stuff changed
when I visited the Wiki once there was suddenly an item with high importance listed which I never saw
I heard that the LN is still good
heard in the LNs Shiraori's ||is more tame than in the wn which would be kinda annoying because it seems like she will not rip the arms off of little vampire girl anymore||
on a really annoying cliff hanger too
sadly it stopped releasing 18th of November 2018
Webnovel is amazing
read all of it
yes haha
awesome spider

To render a 1.5h movie like this . . .
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
IT LOOKS FANTASTIC
everything except the black and white shits is all CG
OHH MY FUCKING GOD THIS IS AMAZING
why do production companies always need numbers though
ah
µ's is already really weird
these idol group names *sigh*
the show also has a Hibiki
the one you posted and the Hibiki are my favorites in that cast

But Strike the Blood makes FIGHT 4 REAL great
Burst the Gravity is great too
FIGHT 4 REAL
ALITMA
Yea, the movie was great

I like the slime manga a lot

https://youtu.be/1UuXjOAKcxU the song is the best part
and the one guy loses his gacha currency
fighting with a fucking tuna
ok, it's not Cooking with Valkyries, but one of these irl cg shorts, still kinda fun
The new Cooking with Valkyries season with amazing titles
a week ago a japanese release of s1 also started
the first season in on youtube
they always put a recipe the end of every ep
Every episode usually uses a different cast and the stuff they cook can actually be done irl too
wholesome
no ecchi lol
**Nevis** is typing...
**Nevis** and **Novanity** are typing...
it's a spinoff anime from the mobile game Honkai Impact
they did barbecue at the beach in one ep
Season 1 was good

https://youtu.be/YRdKM_a0d-Y I love that short Rozalya and Lilya song <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
but dunno where
Miso, the first season is currently airing with Japanese vooices
They also have Japanese voices in the game which I default to
it stretched over a long amount of time, yes : )
WAIT
when you think about it
Houseki No Kuni

https://www.scribblehub.com/series/143098/reincarnated-as-a-rock/ it was only a matter of time

ahh I wanna read Demon Noble Girl but also binge Kiddy Grade right now!!!!!
lol
still enjoyable
manga also only very short -.-
which I'd have loved
There seems to be more in the plot but the story sadly didn't go very deep
Cute girl doing fortune telling
Urara Meirocho is great
interesting how much flows out there without the glass emptying

> ||more or less extreme than reviewers||
<@213645184125239317> ||no tits to be seen but definitely quite lewd|| sadly I forgot the name
||they were doing it but nothing much was shown||
was yuri too
I remember I once watched a softcore hentai that I found through an anime crack video
since yesterday, when saki came back
and another MILI song, when it aired
yea
ahh ok
ohh finally subbed
careful xD
this is not the spoiler channel
ok just more of the usual suffering
fuck
wait there is a new houseki no kuni chapter
lol
lol
lul
looks nice
haha
lul
I actually never really got into im, I just base who I like of the characters off of how they look
I can see that
never heard of Makoto
Miki is nice
inqisition?
why does her hair have such a strong blue
just can't guess it in amq
Red Swan is weird
2 cute girls
KIDDY GRADE
you should change your name again
way too fucking confusing
ohh carlos
what does amq have to do with that
lol
new gen love live
> Its almost like anime has run out of unique character designs.
<@!238855496797257729> how many red hair twintail tsundere are there
already run out a long time ago
someone said amq?
koro sensei? rimuru?
ohh
that character seems familiar
wait what anime is this
a friend of mine downloaded over 1tb of hentai
at least once
who else has 55gb of manga on their phone that they will definitely read at some point and not just let it rot there for eternity
Yui is just Yukino without kno

fuuuck I need finally finish that

I just finished the first episode of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and I am deeply confused

hey! I'm not terrible!
I wanted to ping you, ash, but you already replied xD
Updated on Re:Monster are also so slow.. .
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Dammit
I caught up to all chapters of Exploding Girl
-.-
I really like stories that do something with gender bend or also cross dressing sometimes
often fun stuff ensues
twintail is fun
yea
that's the mc

nah pummeling with fists
also no BL in that one
lol no
"The Exploding Girl" is fun to read
Webtoon where guy becomes a magical girl
Really cool outfits in that one!
Could have gotten a big fucking harem.
It's a bit sad to read.
But their interactions together are great.
He is misunderstanding stuff, yea
lol, yea it's a bit creepy
but it's genuine in that context
aadly he couldn't find love
just a happy man
happy to play his favorite game



actually, isekai ojisan is really heartwarming
both only have 1 season <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
both are good
ye
mondaiji tachi
look at this amazing description
will try
hmm
Anyone knows an at least mediocre isekai manga that you'd recommend?
gonna have to watch it soon
nice
<@!360889486760214540>
it was such a coincidence that I even found that manga
ahh shit I caught up with fantady bishoujo
at least that seems to get updates every week <:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
interesting that the weird part always appears at midnight lol
ahh great another character was introduced and at first I thought he is annoying but now it's getting even more hilarious
I'm really enjoying it, their dynamic as a duo is genius
The guy is annoyed that his friend got turned into a girl.
Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan To
I just found a manga where two guys get isekaid and one gets turned into a girl.
These two are childhood friends and both 32 when isekaid.
One of the two is always trying to find a girlfriend and the other seems to be gay and doesn't want the first one to get a girlfriend.
It's really interesting.
uff

"Yakuza Princess" badass princess beating up street thugs and getting her town in order.
Damnit another manga I caught up with
Can't I just please find a manga with like 100 chapters that I really enjoy
~~(not like I already have 10 or 20 of these that I just stopped reading and would definitely enjoy reading if I just started again)~~
And the ending theme is really nice
Just watched ep1 of Mushishi
Really interesting
Guy who solves "ghost" problems
hmm, gonna check it out after dinner
You have to hit your keyboard 24 times instead of 4 times
Sure I can type it but I'd would take more time
> I never seen you type in Senki Zesshou Symphogear when referring to Gear
<@!676272618839605249> what
I don't wanna play a gacha tower defense game.
Most mobile games I stop playing after a few weeks.
And I'd be more interested in the arknight story than the gameplay.
not really this
what I want is something like this
> Likes dragongirls but don't like Kobayashi-san
<@!676272618839605249> Kobayashi is a human
The dragons there aren't really what I'm looking for.
Weird horns and tails and not enough scales.
<:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>

And since when did the "fantasy" tag become literally EVERYTHING

WHERE CAN I FIND MANGAS WITH BEAUTIFUL CUTE LOLI DRAGON GIRLS
If this is the description of an isekai then why the fuck author, did you write an isekai

Just write a story with a farmer, who's pretty smart and invents new farming ideas. That's basically the same.
Ah no you'd have to think of a character personality besides average Joe, who is average and lives an average averegy live in average ville while being average.
lol
btw that message was to something else
nt ngnl
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I watched that movie in theaters
whx didn't I get anything
you will never guess what is meant by "timelimit"
NGNL
yes
Why have I only found this now
wtf


yes

"Fight 4 Real" FUCKING GREAT
got to op2 of Striek the Blood
already 0212 somehow
Or at east like some other day as I think I should go to bed now lol
I'm questioning rn if I ever watched further hmm
Will do that now xD
half way through season 1 now again
and one girl is really thirsty but also totally tsun
why is that princess also so thirsty for him
wtf why is ep 5 of Strike the Blood IV supposed to release on 29th of SEPTEMBER
when 4 episodes are already out
hmm ok
?
Finally watching Strike the Blood again and good Asagi is thirsty
I don't even remember her like that
Thanks for that recommandation Degurechaf, will read it now
Been looking for stuff like that too
SOOOO RARE
SO MUCH SHIT TO WATCH
hmm also have to watch granbelm xD
Maybe it was just the first impressions
Hmm actually thinking of giving toradora another try
||the blonde haired girl actually died but in the anime at the end was revived, in the manga though her body was possessed by something else and I don't even know if she came back||
They changed the ending of the anime
It drifted away from the manga a bit
ye
it's cool
Still nice ending though
Sadly the anime ended in a way that won't make a second season possible -.-
Loved the anime and manga
Mahou Shoujo Site is great!
THIS IS AMAZING
new Slime chapter
new Frieren chapter
and new Exploding Girl chapter!!!
a chapter just got released
la fucking mao
every few days a new chapter
at least the update cycle isn't half bad
ahh shit I already finished all 500 chapters of Tales of Demons and Gods
but then I hear lines like "Damn it smells like ass in here"
and I'm not so sure anymore really
my father watched it and I caught some pretty romantic snippets
it just seems like, the first few episodes are a barrier of stupidity
"So you'd obey me just like a dog?"
and that's the fucking reason I can't watch Toradora
fucking weird stuff they are saying
like Taiga, is just so stupid
lul
I first thought you meant the mc with teacher and not the succubus lul
lul
anime was interesting
mostly SoL
also weird buns
fly off of a car and hit someone
> Why am I so dumb
<@!98541382393688064> humans tend to just click it
watched 1 or 2 eps of it
it's interesting
everything is Fate
definitely Fate
This one shot was great.

Hero party defeated the demon lord and is on their way back.
It has a dark twist and a wholesome ending.
and then there was that one scene in Mekakucity Actors which had such weird animation
Shaft can do good stuff
I don't see a best girl
read the big order manga to like vol 6 or 7
is fun
gonna catch up for now
but I can already tell that this whole chicken thing is stupid

||there is no fucking magic
they are just thinking it||
||they make the connection between the chicken making sounds when the sun goes and for some dumbfuck reason they think it's interdimensional magic||
ehh wasn't much of a spoiler
ok, there is a holy cock

really? wtf
just a few chapters in
the what?

I Became a Legend a Decade Later After Telling My Comrades to Leave Everything to Me and Retreat First
aaahhhhh she so cuuuuuuteee!!!!!
cute girl
"University graduate Mu Siyun sent his resume to the star fleet on a whim and somehow became the Fleet Admiral! Ths is the story about an admiral with a harem of 3000 female soldiers conquering the universe…"
that synopsis yo
for some reason the thumbnail reminded me of Rachel from Tower of God
the title would make sense xD
there was also another one some hundred chapters ago

but also noticed it in some other series

I noticed this a lot in translated stuff already
but why is "have" sometimes an "of"
like, the "of" makes no sense, and "have" seems to be the correct word
had NGNL Zero here
subbed and german dub
only caught the dub though

but it was GOOD
the voices they got sound really really good
only difference I heard was Jibril, but still fitting
would be funny if it was the same salle for both of you
lol
xD
is that a pudding you're patting or why is it so wobbly
need to watch the movie
a bunny girl
dunno hanabi, stopped after ch5 lol
bgs?
I like the stuff by Funa-sensei
Potion danomi
80000 gold coins
And "Didn't I say to make my abilities average in the next life"
all of them are pretty fun and light hearted most of the time
and then mc is pretty funny
over a lot of chapters more and more secrets are revealed and over 300 chapters of wn in it's still not everything known
because it has amazing world building
that one I love to death
next year it's finally time
I'm still waiting for the anime of Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka since august 2018
I don't really know myself.
Some reincarnation stuff is just pretty fun.
Other stuff though . .
Something mediocre and not trash lol
Isekai Cheat Magician is an example that that also doesn't always work.
MC described as badass who can flatten entire nations.
Few chapters into the manga there is something that can defeat him.
Then he has a stupid training arc 5 chapters in.
most of the things I read always have comedy aspects in them
there is rarely anything that I can find which is totally serious
but even saitama worked for it
op mcs can be fun, e.g. OPM
but yea, struggling MCs that don't just get powers from somewhere but work for it are great
ohh
<:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>
At some point all these novels and manga and whatever that always have "talent" as their main focus because someone is strong is SOO ANNOYING
fucking talent is worth shit
always when someone else then says the mc has "such great talent" you never see them trying to do something or surpass them
no one trying to practice, besides an antagonist maybe who is an arrogant shitty noble who thinks they should be the best

talent is so lazy it's fucking annoying me now
brain go padoru?
as that's the tags that matter in amq
yea, but the anime is what I mean
cute girls doing cute things
lol
and so is kancolle
trinity seven is apparently cgdct
<@!247701824335904770>
kein zurück
opening of princess connect re dive has a point where it can PERFECTLY transition over into jojo op1
I just love the joke in Mnemosyne where Mimi always brings vodka instead of actual water lol
anyone knows some good fantasy stuff that I can binge read?
not necessarily isekai

maybe something like Frieren
but just more of it
<@!360889486760214540>
also a webtoon with 14 chapters
not bad art
"The Blood Princess and the Knight"
world setting is kinda weird as it seems modern but they fight with swords
also found something stupid while going through NU again

holy knight gets captured by vampire queen and made into her daughter

somehow escapes and now tries to live as a human again
hmm maybe gonna try maoyu

that apothecary one looks interesting
> ~~perhaps it would have been a good idea to ask what you liked about Frieren before making suggestions.~~
<@!504069701911969803> just a pure fantasy story without any fucking rpg mechanics
> Bookworm light novel is awesome.
<@!114081181611458563> I tried reading it
but I just don't like that mc
finished ep 1
always listening to *maybe* imaginary voices
anime, why are you like this
starting wixoss finally
if it's good it's gonna be great cause so many seasons already!
seems interesting
FUCK YES
thicc ones
but I bought two volumes of Shaman King
same as another book for animation
5th one for over a month in the UK
I bought like 4 books of  the omnibus collection already
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK I REALLY WANT TO BUY THIS
but it's 90€
How she adopts her parents behaviour is great
she crazy
definitely
one of the few things that can make me actually laugh instead of midly chuckle
that latest ep of saoa was great
https://youtu.be/2wkvg_uWOc4 how did I miss this
it took the good parts of arifureta, not the shitty if anyone is worried
a bit of arifureta, the villains need to safe the world, monster musume and a fuck ton of other inspirations made into something decent
> "Living as I please, as a loli Demon King"
<@237964037898502144>
"Living as I please, as a loli Demon King"
someone even got it
LA FUCKING MAO

THIS IS GREAT
a
fucking
jojo
reference
really?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH FINALLLY A NEE CHAPTAAAAAAAAA
right, there was some shared universe stuff too
I thinn I read some of that but forgot about it lol
if you want a really lewd gay one then I recommend "The villains need to save the world"
there is one with a princess and her father- the king - wants to marry her off and she flat out says "I like girls"
a few gay ones
you know what makes the ratings even more complicated sometimes?
double or triple letter such as AA or SSS or - and + OR BOTH, like, such a great idea, not gonna confuse anyone
ohohoh and then make it so that monster levels and human levels aren't even the same so that you need 10 c rank human to kill a c rank monster
that will make it very helpful
huh
god, it's annoying every time they use it
Because which reason would all these worlds have to put s better than a if g is closer to s than a and g is worse
Ohh wow Rose Princess has one really amazing thing
No d c b a s ranking for adventurers
but actual names like guard and adept rank
Like, how long did it take people to figure out that that fucking letter system is stupid when actually thinking about it
It has its own charm
Also, waiting for new chapters of Yuuri to come out was always nice
Every week im class I'd just update the page every time and see if a new one released
In Kumo there is also some more stuff that doesn't just happen on the one planet the story mainly plays on
80000 gold coins is using it well
Girl travels between worlds
Sadly finished
One of my all time favorites is Hakai Me no Yuuri
great story with awesome action, really good comedy and quite satisfying overall
not all is gender bent
there is another list for that
That's where I pulled most of the stuff I've recently read
Ash, I have the list for you
https://www.novelupdates.com/viewlist/14471/
without the isekai plot it would be close to stories like "The Girl who ate a Death God" or "The girl raised by a drath god"
I'm probably gonna continue it
Because that stuff will just be forgotten about later by the author so it might turn out mediocre or a bit better
Rose Princess of Hellrage
so everything in those 10 years qas completely uninfluenced
also, amnesia of past life until dead
Started reading another wn
MC here is a girl and seems to be already living 10 years and then gets killed
And for some reason after she was killed the author decided to say it's an isekai and genderbent
Like, if you want to make a gender bent isekai, then at least put effort in you fucking idiot 🤦‍♂️
the whole isekai and genderbent stuff doesn't even affect the plot in ANY meaningful way
and the description of the story was just the complete first chapter just with more words inbetween showing us "yes those guys, who killed the mc are definitely the bad guys, 100%"
it just makes me angry
yep
last few weeks I had the horny turned down and now it resurfaces
Urara Meiroucho nice
||flip her skirt||
I play video games for 6 hours
I can watch a movie for 6 hours
why not 6 hours -.-
"can the bladder endure" xD
Maybe at some point she will observe "love" and there will be a gay arc xD
> "She Was Both Called God, as Well as Satan" has a neat premise, noting it down even if it's not gay
so many characters that you follow around and you learn about all kinds of things and the mc is just there and does nothing but observing
Another wn got picked up after quite some time by a new translator and that person writes all the names different
they admitted not having read a lot of the other translation but it's so annoying seeing the names different or sometimes the translator even got story parts wrong as they just assumend stuff
or another one, where in the middle of the chapter the translator stopped making good sentence structures
"at the northern fort" was that

bofuri wn also had an issue like that which made it annoying to read
but most of them are good
I often encounter some errors but now a lot of them are jusz being corrected while I'm thinking about them and not noticing them
Iski, read one, that thing, it was just straight taken from the machine translator
no editing whatsoever
my brain melted after 1 chapter
Re:Monster and "She Was Both Called God, as Well as Satan" have a pot of narration as well and it works pretty pretty good
was 7 chapters in an it seems ok rn

there is a lot of narrating which I'm not opposed to really
> I think I've read that one, unless that kinda thing happens in numerous stories
Dragon's Bloodline
lol
wow this one is making me hate people sooo much and I'm not even 5 chapters in!
Started a new wn
MC has some childhood drama because of parents making poor decisions
Like fight between kids over a toy, mc is always made out as the trouble maker, even if untrue and stuff like that
That can really mess with you
Let's see what the author makes of it
(The White Cat That Swore Vengeance Was Just Lazing on the Dragon King’s Lap)
magical girl using super-powered weapons
ahh
didn't even see someone was talking about adachi
I meant the isekai one lol
WAIT THAT IS GETTING AN ANIME
:3
all girls amirite
heh
or maybe it should just be a tag
big fucking girl?
my genius is unparalleled
wut
can't find on nya
action/adventure/title?
what is it about?
just what the title says?
oh
there also seems to be yuri in there
tags say bi
Description is weird
Started another webnovel
End of the chapter:
``Cause of death : Seeing his warm smile.``

The protagonist is in a dating sim and not allowed to fall in love or she'll die.
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/ill-die-if-i-fall-in-love-its-too-hard/
yepyep
in 2020
less whaling
xD
uff
they did a good job at first but then it suddenly was bad
> WN TL was broken machine TL
yep, made me stop read it
but of course it ends on a cliffhanger and I have to wait for more chapters!
and now it wants to tear jerk me!
What I've been writing about earlier
"Saikyou No Kurokishi, Sentou Maid Ni Tenshoku Shimashita"
great gender bend fantasy comedy
no isekai
just some reincarnation in the same world
mc is now a maid
meeting old comrades after 16 years
hilarity insues
lmao
https://tenor.com/view/umm-confused-blinking-okay-white-guy-blinking-gif-7513882
Anyone has a good recommendation for a manga with cute girls, not just doing cute things but also other things?
chapter 11 has a very funny surprise!
The character also look very cute.
And the mc actually now has some feelings for one of the male friends.
They went on a date and it seems like there is some more there.
With a name like "When I woke up, I was a Girl" I didn't expect at all really, but it seems to be a somehow cute romcom.
Chapters are very short and some stuff is just kinda weird and being glossed over, but the characters are fun and their interactions are too.
Seeing some Frieren up there
nice
Gonna give the 10 chapters available a try
"When I Was Reincarnated In Another World, I Was A Heroine And He Was A Hero"
Time foe weird shit again.
So, this author didn't just write any good 'ol isekai, they wrote an *isekai*.
Wordbuilding: Huh?
Character development: I don't know
Backstory: Hmm ok
Story progression: *zoom*

Getting tired of always having kings and what not greet heroes in some pompose manner?
Wanna get straight into the meat and potatoes?
Don't worry, these two people jump straight ahead without any second thoughts, probably not even first thoughts.

But for real, this one seems kinda fun
got recommended the wn of that some time ago
powers hidden in the shadows
ohh wait it's that one!
nice
> fucking lol
flol?
share sauce!
||I am Atomic||
Ok, read a few manga chapters of Power in the Shadows and I'm definitely reading the wn after that!

Great protag
Love his personality
Spidergirls have a charm
just don't make them supadom
Waiting for "Iron Ladies" chapters is so annoying
takes long
not many pages
not much information per page
That parody was fun
> They must be cousins
4kids
sounds like friendship
trailer looking nice!
danmachi has nice yukachi ops
I think so
I like it
another pokemon I think
gesundheit
the hood she has reminds me of a pokemon
who even is that second girl
Ghost Stories
https://youtu.be/7UlY6nucI6E  **DRAGON GIRL** AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
whose name I forgot
Ah the little girl
was a good turning point for the story to take off for real now
first few chapters just seemed SoL which was also nice
and I'm not talking about tits
I just read ch 17 and it got **HEAVY**
ohh shit
Musuko ga Kawaikute Shikataganai Mazoku no Hahaoya


WHOLESOME OVERLOOOOOAAAAAAAAAD
And I'm not sure if I even want to know
I still don't know what that emote is supposed to be
Yes, I meant Millh[something]
Gesundheit
baldie?
wot
instead of yubiyubi it's not yuriyuri
Liked it a lot
> oh hey comments mention the guy who plays as him in the live action version is gonna voice him in the anime too 👀 ?
ohhh something like that is definitely really cool
wtf is that pic
she does that to everyone it seems
it's true
||found it in an backalley||
hmm
can't Kumo Desu Ga Nano Ka release first before all those other one are getting them
I have been waiting for 2 years already since the announcement
wait that thing is getting an isekai??
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/potatoes-are-the-only-thing-thats-needed-in-this-world/ wtf xD
Ahh ok, thx
xD
uff
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-have-reincarnated-into%e3%80%8cwelcome-to-the-%e2%97%8b%e2%97%8b-town%e3%80%8dtownsperson-a-but-the-last-dungeon-was-right-around-the-corner/
or did I find the wrong thing
wait, last dungeon jas just one chapter on NU
wtf
so easy to spot the fucking mc
> don't have too much expectation of the upper one
I know, I saw the mc
the last one though seems interesting
hmm those last two posted I haven't heard about
||rape||
yea, someone posted that yesterday
and I really wanna read more of the wn because I heard that in ln, mc is a bit tamer
also some plot points are different
and there is way too much focus on "Shun" the most annoying bastard ever
at least it ended and is not on indefinite hiatus
the wn ended in the middle of a fucking battle which was such a fucking cliffhanger
OHH WAIT NOT 2019
IT WAS 2018
I'm just annoyed because since 18th of Novemeber 2019 there hasn't been a single update to the webnovel and nothing for me to read
where do you fit the yuri then?
I only get as far that the second op played once
and then I stopped
damn I need to continue StrikerS
ohh
that's how many members the server has
my father is now at the second season of Rosario Vampire
he watches so much romance, ecchi, harem stuff
oh
the op has maybe come up less than 5 times in amq
only read to like colume 6
I need to continue it
manga is great
in the anime mc has amnesia for some fucking reason and it's weird
like two different stories with same premise and maybe some overarcing plot points
> Dance in the vampire bund
manga > anime
Shinmei Mao no Testament is on netflix so I can probably get him to watch it lol
lol
idk if he has, could have
He has also read like 5 volumes of Dance in the Vampire Band
which also has some quite nice stuff xD
Toradora
Probably all of High School DxD
To love ru
Demon King Daimao
Rosario Vampire
Undefeated Bahamut Chronicles
and definitely several more lol
quite interesting
cause she has boobs?
huh?
Juni Kokuki/12 Kingdoms
I quite liked that one
https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/11/03-1/kyoto-animation-is-honored-with-2020-diversity-award-from-women-in-animation
how much horror?
or what kind?
gory or more psychological horror?
I think some people talked about this here once
huh
looks interesting
what is it about?
https://youtu.be/DQSk0le2REw
Ohh my god
What the fuck happened
This story is getting crazy
ahh ok
Btw, do you have a list of stuff that I could check out?
You can just keep clicking it
If you look at the latest chapter's comments xD
Btw, on a totally unrelated note, did you know that upvotes and downvotes on the website are totally borked?
xD
ok
no boys for you in your stories xD
ahh ok
ye
Ash, have you read a bit from the one I posted yesterday?
A thirst that can't be quenched
What is it Aya?
pure comedy
no bullshit
"As I thought, maybe it’s not something you attain, but something you’re born with—

—no! I mustn’t lose hope!"
FUCK YES, NO TALENT BULLSHIT

WUHH

https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-am-a-duchess-who-has-rewound-nine-times-but-my-tenth-life-seems-to-be-a-reward-mode/?pg=5 this is a really fun read!
just looked up, no clue anymore
who that again?
Gonna start over again because I have no clue where I left this novel last year and gonna refresh my memory of everything
xD
"Kuma Kuma Kums Bear" wn ch1 title
``The Bears Bear a Bare Kuma``
symphogear never felt like mahou shoujo until someone said it
video games are fun :3
yea
say movie right in the title xD
still at the beginning of alfheim though, so gonna take some time
asuna just having no clue how the game works xD
really wanna know if SomethingWitty is gonna do an abridged of that xD
that could be really fun
would be interesting to find out what asuna did before that all happened
we did only see enviroment and monsters from floor 1 in the movie, so maybe
häh?
but it's a movie, how they gonna fit 70+ boss fights in there
huh
what
is this like a remake of the og or something?`
or what do the visuals mean
eyyy
haha nice
Ohh, I thought they did all the thinking while drinking, heard that from somewhere
by voice acting under the influence of alcohol
ahh
?
also "female principals always look like lesbians"
lol
ngnl also has a good dub, at least German
?
ghost stories
> The article's down
<@457268466429329429> https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2020-11-09/why-does-the-crunchyroll-original-series-ex-arm-look-so-awful/.166117 there seems to be a new one
looks like SoulWorker kinda
How did they get funds??
Maybe typos or wrong information
BAA Last Order!
Love it
Which chapter are you at?
Only took 20 episodes lol
Finally reached a point a Juni Kokuki where I don't remember what's going on
Stuff that I haven't watched
If you want a really fun comedy of some bros
wait, it was sooo different? (the video)
how did I not notice this for like 4-5 episodes xDD
Didn't even notice the animation was different
is it recap or continuation?
haven't watched movie
yikes
ohh right, that was two months when airing . . .
that's just crazy
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
yikes
I only noticed they changed numbers
That was the only way I noticed I wasn't rewatching one episode
wut
the ||time loop||
When you think about it, Haruhi <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Having the same animations though would be really annoying, I saw that in a game once, when you went through dialogue, the characters always had the same animations and it just wasn't good in any way.
Bottle anime would be reusing the same background art or animations, maybe?
Ahh ok
Bottle show?
Genre/s?
sauce reading
like tea leaf reading?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
lol
cool
what is that list btw
inventory?
lol wat
watch 1/week
Or Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya
I'd definitely recommend that with a straight face, great show.
?
ohh
that's what those always was with those cards
ah
> that's how she sees herself, not how people see her
?
easier to draw, yea
I started with the manga, how I found kumo
then went to wn and a bit ln
both are good
like really really hate
I know some people who hate the manga design
also this kumo version just looks really cute for some reason
which is kinda weird
Where it stopped in the middle of ||A FIGHT BETWEEN GODS THAT MAJORLY IMPACTS THE FUTURE||
so yea nothing big
I only read the wn fully
Ahh nice to hear
have the first 4
only got a but into the 2nd? I think
ahh I need to start reading the LN
*sure*
||though some do die in unfortunate circumstances|| spoiler ik from wn
yea
and wait, just 11 students???
wasn't it way more
FUCK
I CAN ONLY HEAR HIBIKI
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO

Air Date: January 8th, 2021
Full cast reveal (It's stacked)

New PV
Major website update
https://kumo-anime.com/
https://youtu.be/UZE4ZZiXBQY
I found the mc really annoying

I also didn't like steins;gate where it was again, the mc, that I couldn't stand

different reasons for both, but still
why is bookworm liked so much???
that sounds so much fun to watch
should put on ptw
ahh ok
only ever saw the names in amq lul
wait
s3?
isn't there s1, repeat and vacation?
https://youtu.be/iK_a-kd5oxk
you won't have the same glasses for very long
after that I haven't really interacted with it anymore
I liked pokemon quite a bit
Stopped watching in black and white
pokemon and sailor moon are one of my first
I watched sailor moon with my mother
lmao
it's not his first time watching
my father is watching To Love Ru Darkness
**again**
First episode of Adachi watched
But why do they always feel like blushing around each other when they just barely became friends and know each other?
Not even a month or so from what I think
That part just feels kinda put in there to show "yep this is gonna be a gay show and not just cgdct"
gonna show a friend Arpeggio tomorrow!
Her outfit was great!
Kongou in Cadenza was just amazing!
yea
He likes Kongou
haifuri is nothing but an imagination in your mind
best boat anime
tomorrow we gonna finish the thing!
Aiii watched arpeggio to ep 7 with a friend!
Fate/Zero and then just watch all of Illya
Apocrypha is also nice
uck
https://youtu.be/AT8JRe0uIiE
NUMBER 49!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"hey you, you're finally awake"
"Why Kongo, you are such an independent woman, I like you"
"Fuck you Ikxi, you made me like this"
"Come on Kongo, I was gonna be your simp!"
"I'm not fantasizing anything about ships" he says
My friend: Are there any endings where they are wearing bikinis?
context: Arpeggio ending
?
they just wanna play soccer while protecting the PM
https://youtu.be/WkLxaIkIQuw misty is cultured, those 2 number 9 entries are THE SHIT
AHHHHHH
s1
2wei
2wei Herz
3rei
I think it was ok, some of the animation in later episodes, the fighting scenes, looked a bit weird, as if it was by trigger of something idk, but overall I liked it
ahh
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
there are a few more chapters out
I need to continue
ohh sousou no frieren video!

KUMO
KUMO
KUMO
KUMO
KUMO
that seems pretty ok
Just read part of the manga
dafack
zombieland saga 2018
I thought that was last year
kakegurui also 2017
how did 3 years pass
it's doesn't feel that long
inuyashiki was 2017?????????????
wait
ah
they made several good ones
hmm?
how did they come up with those?
Friend sees Yamato: "I like her"
||yamato gets fucking rekt||
Takao and Hyuga get off screen "Thank god, I was about to beat my-"
"I think I'm horny for ships"
Friend sees Takao in bikini
"they are ships they are ships they they are ships theyareshiptheyareship *whispering* theyareshipstheyaresships"
I like both

huh?
that one too?
xD
a mammal?
that one?
that one too?
huh
wut
it's a long ride, if they adapt a lot
I love it
You're in for a ride
yep

ahh looking at it now
I hate it
this is a kinda recreation of a scene in the first PV
but really slow
uff
yea
But this one was easier to model for me xD
I have watched quite a bit of Eureka 7 like 10 years ago already
I had some major plotpoints, but forgot most context to the images I still have in my head
AO?
I need to watch eureka 7 again
and then what else there is
shit I need those plushies
wait
spider x slime collab?

hmm something weird
there are 2 ways in that app to see how big a folder is
one says 69gb , other says 74gb
maybe of them actually means gibi? no clue
though the data is a bit muddied by webtoons, manhuas and manwas, those don't amount to a lot
so still fairly accurate
but also not big probably
at least from scanlators
dunno how big the file sizes of crunchy, etc would be
1 page is ~337kb
subtract around 250 folders then the folder number is the number of chapters downlaoded and the file number is very close to the actual page number I have downlaoded, maybe subtract 1000-2000 for pages from the scanlators
so 220000 divided by 9600 is ~23
and that's the average amount of pages a manga has
you know how I said 69?
yea no, downloaded Helck and it went to 74 lmao
it's very easy in the app I have
probably some missing, but that's most of what I read
ohh
105 different series
ok, solo levelling has 3-4mb pages
but a few haves pages that are over 1mb
like 100kb - 300kb
for manga it's quite a lot I would say
as most pages are heavily compressed
only rarely some of them have big files sizes
those are chapters from 105 different mangas
yesn't
I'm gonna get around to read it
*atsomepoint*
hn?
I have 128gb internal and 128gb sd card
uff
I got 69gb of manga on my phone
uff
IT HAS BEEN OVER TWO YEARS SINCE THE LAST CHAPTER
I AM SO FUCKING HYPED
FUCK YEA
NEW KUMO DESU GA NANI KA WEBNOVEL CHAPTER
The world will not suddenly get better just because a new year start
Okina Baba:
it's about best best friends
there are so many mangas I have read with "tensei" in the title that I just forget them
I think I have read this?
maybe?
if it's the one I read, it's gonna be a nice story
all the bad went to ex-arm so Kumo wouldn't suck
I hope that
no!
instead of just 1 arm regrowing, she grew 7
spider cute
nah
?
kumo ending hype
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/465894707008897024/796087588217421894/videoplayback.mp4
14 hours till kumo ep 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
https://twitter.com/kumoko_anime/status/1347035964724547584?s=20
what game is that?
yea, and PV1 had Araba
so that also tells how far it will kinda go
that would be SHIT
ehh
only have vol 1-4 and haven't touched them much
12-13 eps would be way to less to get the story even rolling
das a lot
ln vol 5
so the anime will at least go that far!
ok, amazing°
ohh my god
SHE MENTIONS D IN THE ENDING!!?!?!?!?
waitwaitwaitwaitwait
Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka?
the price of the bluray
is that really over 100 bucks?
for 6 episodes? it does say ep 1-6 and there are 4 different blurays
and each has that price
Kumo desu has a yandere brother obsessed sister
but that character is already from there from ther beginning, not just the anime
lul
ohh also just found this
Okina Baba is the original author, but someone else is also working on the writing in the anime
recycling
oxygen is a big simp for helping aoi that much

heh
Can't wait for there are ||multiple Kumos and Aoi Yuuki talking to herself just intensifies even more xDD||
Kumo spoilers
if they actually adapted the spin-off manga, oh my god
that would be amazing xD
but the German dub
weird voices
aiii my father is watching trinity seven now xD
both have a r and e  in there name
total ripoff
ah
who
and?
Read some more chapters of Isekai Ojiisan
Those stories are so much fun xD
Rascal does not dream of Dreaming Girl
nope wait, it's the movie
after my father finished Demon King Daimao for the 2nd or 3rd time he is now watching Rascal does not dream of Bunny Girl Senpai
so it will be on the list next season!
Where is my Kumo <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
that seems fun
ahh another round of people just going to go apeshit crazy because of this show
wait what
||from what I remember in the manga, wasn't it just a normal affair while he had a wife, and not, you know, that||

that guy speaks way too fast
just something really weird
but not cringe
any show that I could watch while feeling wasted?

wtf

FINALLY
FUCK YES
lul
better than asterisk war!
FUCK YEA
what's the context?
yet
Haven't read the ln much
I love the wn
dunno
the webnovel is still being continued besides the ln
and manga
and anime
IT HAS TO BE THE BEST
wait
I just noticed
*web*novel
webnovel
thing is
rn not sure if it's twintails
or just weird ribbon shit
and ponytail
mc collects girls
shitsurakuen
from the cover it looked like the mc is a short haired redhead
but it seems to be some twintail girl
ahh most twintail girls in anime/manga are annoying
and this one is a dunce too
maybe should continue the manga
huh
ohh that one
the thumbnail reminds me of magi
if you like Tanya somewhat
manga is also good
xD
should be good
dunno
funa sensei's chapters are usually a few minutes long
not longer than 10 minutes reading, I think
just found out that "didn't i say to make my abilities average in the next life?!" has over 450 wn chapter o.0
aiiii
some good stuff in there
because it's a really fun story
hope they don't fuck up the anime
it is straight
if you wanna watch trash
demon king daimao
god, that one is bad imo
my father is already on episode 12 of testament of sister new devil
wtf
vacuum ass
xD
sure
but huh
I would have said Kaede
yea, it's not bad at all
most have their little spot in the lime light at some point
great cast of character
I loved it
no sarcasm
good anime
**assass**i**nation classroom**
cute wholesome sol or just pure comedy?
or mix?
harem slice of life?
just comedy or also some action?
idk
I love s1 and 2
just the movie threw me off
but then getting into situations where English is needed and creating ton of misunderstanding
I did not like the movie
the premise: "let's go to England even though we have only the most basic knowledge of English possible" was so weird
ahh ok
stg?
my father is watching testament of sister new devil s2 rn
and I walk into the room and the scene that's playing is them in a "sports class" doing "stretching"
if you know what I mean
dunno how often I have started reading tower of god again because I had no clue anymore what was even going on
hahaha
same
started reading a bit
there is so much stuff to read though -.-
yea
it feels like there haven't been many new chapters -.-
yea, same on my source
came out 25th feb?
you know anything if new manga chapters are out at some point or is my source broken?
twist.moe is also good from my experience
yikes that's nevee fun
o.0
lol
most often they appear when there is 1 week delay
why are those two together so common?
for youjo senki, iirc, they had a 1 week delay once and then next episode was a recap
and that recap counted into the full amount of episodes
lmao
I read "I'm fucking Kazuma and Hibiki" xD
||kuro and shiro and kinda like nicknames||
Much better than nothing for over 2 years
We got a bit over 30 chapters this year which is already huge
Yea, but he also said at the beginning of the year that he'll try to put out a chapter of the wn every week
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Kumo is again not getting any WN updates
a lot
I'm trying to suppress that and not saying too much that could be bad
Ahh, I get what you mean
it's fun seeing people talk about it
I haven't seen any theories really
But also not looking for them
Who would throw a perfectly functioning city on another city???
lol
when do they cry?
that looks sooo weird ooc
lol
in that movie where they fly in a plane around the planet?
that's where that granny is ffrom?
ah

gonna try and ask my parents
if it's really only billing when it gets shipped, I should be able to do it
just gotta do *a few* chores, so they are in a good mood when talking to them
nope
at least it's easy
why can't amazon just accept paypal <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

O.O
ahh
I just bought new headphones
but this is really hard to resist!
clicking on "agree to tos and create account"
nothing happenign
hahaha
```It's not like the wonderful readers of ANN would purposefully vote for a show they thought was universally horrendous just to make somebody suffer through it for comedy, right? Only sad, weird losers would do that. No, the only explanation is that some of you indeed sense the grand potential lying beneath this show's surface, and understood that I was the only mind sharp and observant enough to catch on to what EX-ARM is so EX-pertly delivering.```
that cover picture too xD
lmao
in Mahou Shoujo Site the administrators never gave a guy willingly a "stick" and would want to take them away from male cahracters
ohh there was?
afaik, Mahou Shoujo Site also has a trans character
she became a mahou shoujo because she felt like a girl
(though that anime was just pure suffering ~~but also girls kissing in the manga~~)
lol
crazy shit
left kid/s for pieces of paper?
only ever watched yugioh with yugi and kayba and stuff

he did watch on a site called bs.to at some point
I only knew the site because I saw him go there xD
that's when I started watching anime lol
very confused when there was in the anime
there was no amnesia for the mc in the manga
the anime has some plot point changes to the manga
mainly just read the manga
lol great gif

lol
||that headshot was brutal though||
I don't like Sue one bit
||wait wtf, she killed the elves before they were even in the manor; she should have had no clue what was going on, as she still doesn't understand the language, so why did she kill the elves???||
I don't think I have to spoiler tag this one
ye
lmao
ok
lol interesting to see ||Sophia cry||
||interesting that you see some dialogue in the carriage though||
||when she was an infant, yea||

lel
not much seemed to have happened in this ep -.-
so many bikki vibes in the 2nd ed
after watching the new op of kumo a few times
it's not as good as the first
but at least both EDs are good
damn all those different spider voices are great
imma watch now
HAHAHAHAHAHA

small excerpt

<@!171395487247630336> the thing I posted is cute gods doing kingdom building and also being gay
I think you'll enjoy it
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/being-recognized-as-an-evil-god-i-changed-my-job-to-guardian-diety-of-the-beastmen-country/
just found out about this one a few hours ago
really fun at the moment (10 chapters in)
it's really weird that I missed that though, that it aired
a bit
but I love it
Tenkuu Shinpan is in a sense an isekai

People get teleported into a world oh skyscrapers and then can't get to the ground

Get attacked by mask wearing people that are super strong
lol
ohh waot
THIS IS GETTING AN ANIME
FUCK YEA
NETFLIX DON'T FUCK THIS UP
PLEEEEAAAASE
ik yuyuyu, just didn't watch that season, where that weird clip was from it seems xD
YUUUUSHA PUUUNCH
WHAT THE FUCK AM I WATCHING
>  if they just talked like humans
every romance/love issue in anime ever
more scuffed than Gamers ?
you wanted jesus in it?
doesn't include jesus
||the hentais are good||
I think the same thing happened in Just Because! xD
instantly reminded me of ina for some reason
where

really need to watch it
lol
lol
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
BIG PUNCHY GIRL
Honkai series
Guilty Crown
*soon*

one good thing is how many collections for references and other things there are
but if you don't know guilty crown, then it doesn't
only slightly readable though
lol
ik
hm?
maybe
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
das a girl spooder though
you know what I mean by admin
just shit ass normal admin account
ik that there are things still restricted even then
me be admin
>right click on µtorrent
>uninstall
>not admin
>go to file location
>delete folder
>success
only since today though
last week all was fine
I hate when you select one language in an installer but the program after install still starts in another language
ahhhh I'm getting annoyed again
what does µtorrent do that makes it bad?
I tried downloading bittorrent, but of course, that was blocked too
for some fucking reason
I already had restarted 2 times before that
now it seems to work
let's see if a 3rd restart fixes it
even though I turned off realtime protection in the settings
ok, windows is just really fucking with me now
I cannot open µtorrent anymore
it blocks even that
the magnet symbols
I clicked on those, or were those not the magnet links
it does show the blocked stuff in the list at the end

*those it blocks too*
the .torrent
at least I know I'm not missing much
I can't even watch the episode as windows is being a bitch with torrents rn
not just one, all torrents on cat site are blocked by windows ahhhhhh
it's cool that animes often still get a better version
Nijigasaki seems interesting, will continue it tomorrow
I actually really really like those imaginary stages
Feels better
some of the cgi looks a bit iffy
but overall it's always good yea
but the textures on the model look better than what I remember from previous seasons
wow that actually looks really good
yea, just saw the post today though xD
you can read mangadex chapters through the api
for example on tachiyomi
again!
I need to continue the uq holder manga ahhh
ohh
nice
Arata
both were fun
great that you're watching it!
then there is a movie if you wanna continue but idk how good it is
xD
click the link
lol
yatta yatta yatta i
kumoko ascends in this one
https://youtu.be/X5pQ_sGcNg4 extended version
even more crazy
https://houkai3rd.fandom.com/wiki/Kallen_Kaslana
Fu Hua by Minami Takayama
And  Rita is voiced by Aoi
HONKAI
and I pretty much know all the plot already lol
yea, I haven't read it
ohhwait 18 lol
I clicked on that and then realized it's the ep I haven't watched yet xD
yes
from the manga
turn and your brain and go!
wasn't the first arc just ||mc getting qualified for the tournament?||
what
lol
dragon girl!
that's what I was counting on
~~or should I watch and post about it tomorrow, so that ash thinks tomorrow is Friday~~
ohh right
spooder
yea that was really good
that was great
...... what
did you see the title for next week's
and the after credit scene?
uq holders is fun
though I haven't read negima, so I might be missing out on some of it in uq
ah
iftv?
Tuesday
yea, the title of this week's ep was shown in last week's, giving that part away
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
https://twitter.com/hololiveALT/status/1400755156669538305?s=20
no kumoko
there was spider
but not spooder
I was confused by the "if the show>"
ahh ok
that the name?
what
what's that?
lol
I'm surprised it isn't Friday yet
this?
https://youtu.be/wX-X8V1hlxE
just some leaks today
downloading rn
I don't keep up with seasonals anymore
ohh wait "To your Eternity" is airing?
ohh my
lol
ohh
he is kinda save against maou
haha
"menacingly"
young yuusha was not 3d
was ariel also not 3d there?
Ariel's animation is kinda ok, but could also be quite better
some of that 3d shun just didn't look good at all
that's a yikes from me dawg
I did not get it at first
and after watching that magecu thing, my brain was opccupied with other things so more confusion
yea, but why is it a reference to that or?
<:notlikethis:478972743274987522>
brain no comprehend
what
what
?
COME ON
they zoomed in on her eye but...
why do their faces look so dumb
||the battle's gonna end lamer than anything else, so why||
they really put a cliffhanger on *that* battle?
They rendered it 2 times then?
Or could have just rendered dragon, Ariel, and background seems to be also separate. then it kinda makes sense
Would make more sense yea
As the whole is very very round
When your natural predator is a demon lord xD
||the dragon doesn't offer itself and its soul up to the system? or is that not part of the ln||
They made this using the worst method

Like, it wouldn't have been hard to just boolean a whole in there and put the flesh texture inside
but this seems like they flipped the normals for some reason to make it look like that, what the fuck
getting that Kumo overdose after last ep is great
what the fuck was that opener
I want my ||SpooderxSpooderMama|| fanart
only just now
I did not
JAHY SAMA IS GETTING AN ANIME???
https://twitter.com/hololivetv/status/1404031226474766336?s=19
https://twitter.com/UnstPhoenix/status/1404033430963200001?s=19
wut
lol
don't like the voices much
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
but the anime overtook it
reading the manga
I still have questions
a what
lmao
I just needed to scroll down on nya xD
yea
12 seems to be the lasdt
are there more than 8 episodes?
on nyaa it seems to go up to 9 right now
I thought the anime already aired a while ago
will see
WEP is just making me feel weird
finished ep6 now
dling 7 and 8
I just started
currently just weirded out by it
<:poipirate:675756984305188875>
WEP = weird
yea, that's gonna be tough
wep is not finished
not even some special could finish that
or how long is the special
context is important
||their pets dying and being fed to them, like wtf||
now it's getting fucked up
in Ai's first dream it was just because she was slightly tackled
but later on they get flung around a lot and nothing really seems to happen much
also what happened to the whole going to the hospital thing when being hurt in the dream
finished ep10
feeling neutral about it
still a weird show
what?
why do they need to put in a guy with needles
I hate needles ahhhh
trains
wtf

2D animated Sophia is so much sexier than that 3d version from last ep
mommy please pick me up
bad cgi is screaming at me
wtf
did they manage that in neverland somehow????
ahhhhhh
||SHIRAORI ACTION?!?!?!?!?!?||
ahhh
wait
there is like 10-15 years of instory time missing lol
||Hugo is probably gonna die yea, but the robots are not gonna be unleashed yet||
lol
I take some padding over a recap
hey, at least no recap
but like, the aftermath of the elven war is soooo much???
they can't finish this
need another season and then maybe not even
seems like they are resolving the whole elf trouble for now or something
yea
Seems like the manga and anime will diverge a lot now
As those future parts aren't even in the manga and in the latest chapter ||she became an arachne||
this is getting an adaptation huh
not sure though
Shiraori speaks rarely
ohh, yea I think so
like, where would I have heard her besides in the after credit scene
I know the story
but I'm just confused what you're currently talking about
which part
?
can you tell me what you mean
I'm currently a bit confused
ohh after credit scene
they should really give us more spider
but having the spider having fun on one side and the fate of the world on another is weird
no Shiraori this episode -.-
only a short glimpse of her next to Ariel
KYOUYA IS AMAZING
damn love his character here
so sad we are only getting to see him now
this looks 2d and the animation was also not really feeling like 3d
is that after the movie?
s2?
o.o
yea
aren't you guys idols, or want to be?
idols are over
no idols anymore
<a:cocoGun:730009154378530878>
no more concerts
she is fucking dead
Nozomi best
Nozomi
a what
that was my alarm for over a year
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
seems like soon they will be reacing 177013
ann also using 6 digit numbers
yea
elves are pretty good at hiding the forest and using it to their advantage
they were standing on branches last episode
but because the forest is so well camouflaged it looked like they were floating
teleporting? just appearing behind trees
horse ears
you could copy the image link into saucenao.com or ascii2d.net
Ahh good that you mention him, tell him to make me a coffee
fuck kumo delayed
and hololive girls doing the ending song
yea
can't tell
1 character always ends up naked
it has fanservice
There is no Friday
in this case, you could click on the # in twitter
and it will actually show you her twitter as the first result
Also, Cecil, you can often just use ascii2d.net or saucenao.com or even post the image (as a .png/.jpg) in <#336297674707828747>/<#336297808221044736> to get the sources of the art
Most of the time, you will get a result
Is faster that way
Has covered several Nana Mizuki songs and symphogear songs
That would be Cocoa from Riot Music
damn MAPPA and chainsawman trending
did it catch that much attention???
no lol
or Pokemon movie
that was full of cgi
wat
depression rocks?
Dia is nice
There is gonna be an awesome scene with her
Not much happening, but it will look AMAZING
Google image searching does the trick
Seton Academy

idk
<:LucinaShrug:400744933218058260>

?
next kumo ep 3rd of July???
lol
||in the manga and I think wn too, Kumo just used thought acceleration and parallel minds to get a primitive understanding of the language and then got better at it||
||Seems like she just knew it, the other characters also never mentioned having to learn it||
late late wn spoiler ||rip kyouya, can't even say him to rest in peace, dude obliterated his own soul for the greater good||
he is great
Oni guy
I like Kyouya a lot
so definitely a good ep
shun getting his ass kicked
1/2
<@!171395487247630336> how is your Friday going?
new kumo ep out
rgb eyes
lmao
the face of the spider is weird
ehh doesn't look that good imo
if only Shiraori then maybe
||yep yep, manga just doesn't cover human side at all, but even story elements are rearranged for some reason||
||then it was offscreen and I would count that as the same as already knowing it; they did some weird stuff in the anime ||
the future timeline wasn't ended that well imo
how is it
right, I also still have to watch that anime
<@!161155855524298752> I also have this *thing* rated a 10/10
you were tempted and fell for the temptation
ohh lol I thought s3
hahaha
pea shooters? lol
I only heard a story of some woman doing it
I didn't know many people did it
yea
<a:KoroneBonk:735048208266297356>
so there were several people doing that
ahh
also, was their E key broken? xD
?
they got a good style going
I like the cgi
damn ok this looks good
Träumerei???
that looks quite okay to me
with its production
aniplex is what I meant, that's one of the issues I know of
were there other issues, besides the that?
the people with the license
idk
or was it aniplex
what were all the issues with WEP, besides funi
<@!262326868366065664> seems like ufotable also can't be written without tax evasion
o.0
yuutousei?
need more manga chapters of that
I thought for a moment you were talking about reincarnated as a sword
was confused because I didn't hear that one getting an adaptation
and the sword seems more masculine
remove the lines and it looks younger
that anime came out **5** years ago?
https://tenor.com/view/more-star-wars-kylo-ren-gif-15168091
I have read one
you'd have think that was machine translated 3 times
totally unreadable, it was horrible
that webnovel had a rating of 2.5
but ratings don't really mean much most of the time
especially on NU
there probably are
that's a title and a half

https://twitter.com/Merryweatherey/status/1413043501324029952?s=20
Merryweather Comics nearly did a collab/sponsor with them
What is this about?
the author won a ps5 in a raffle
abruptly put the manga on hiatus xD
lol
anime
only have 1, 3 and 4 sadly
haha
I watched it and got nothing
it was good
but like, nothing understood
like, this scene
I haven't seen it?
I am so confused
???????
I didn't skip any episodes though
I never saw that
the whole Taro thing
waaaaiiiit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QmygteRYVo
1 hour total
there seems to be a part 2 too
skapbadoa?
but wasn't there another god of the wired before Lain and above that guy was someone else?
Is Lain's dad god now or what??
needed the sata for another drive lol
the optical drive is currently not connected to the motherboard
don't remember if it's on the dvds
it's been so long since I watched it last time that I forgot that it should have one
yea, I remember the song
huh now there is an op
wait, I'm currently watching it and an op and ed never appeared
it has op and ed?
mood
ehh I think I'll stay clueless
otherwise I might be even more confused or also have an unsatisfying answer
I still have no clue what's happening
onto Lain ep13
I don't think so?
https://youtu.be/QWi5dIh-KPA why did it suddenly recommend me a 2018 kyoani commercial
lol
ok what the fuck
this guy seems to have totally fucked up
chapters in a wrong order
and then they format it as a webtoon for some reason and make long pages
and words are missing that make the text not understandable
some shitty translator picked up Iron Ladirs
and the way they write....
also seems like they don't proof read or just skim it
they shorten words like are  to just r for some reason
https://youtu.be/w2RnDrzg4uU this is a good video about it
For example Google's trademark of the word "Google"
They will not allow dictionary companies to describe the verb "to google" as "using a search engine", only as "using the google search engine"
Ball Heroes
hero
but just a few movements
yea, it's really good cgi I'd say
No pe

<#336297808221044736>

>   It is being sent in regard to your order of one or more of the following products.
manga and anime of that is good
they need to be together (the characters)
haha
and it was somehow part of the reason why I wanted to do 3d art xD
New Game! is great
nice
lol kids channel
ahh
who's akemi again?
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
Being Meguca is suffering
ahh
just talking from experience in the manga
idk where the anime is
when thinking about it, the story really seems to be lacking that
there seem to be no satisfying fight scenes in slime kinda
hahaha
lol
motherfucking handholding
makina nakajima
that I found out
is a macross character
definitelz not super sonico
weird but ok
Windows Explorer exists in the afterlife
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
<@!171395487247630336> https://www.novelupdates.com/series/i-reincarnated-so-i-became-a-vtuber/ has humanity gone too far?
that looks nice
that one is okay
this shit is getting an adaptation?
lmao
that song is great
Never heard of Joshiraki
damn
> scratches that itch of being dark humor
it has literal ||suicide|| jokes (trigger word)
definitely watch samurai champloo
fun action
and philosophical
Girls' Last Tour is weird but wholesome
Zetsubou Sensei is quite fucked up
huh
ohh washio between s1 and hero ch?
anyone got the order of it all real quick?
think I have some yuuki yuuna that I haven't watched yet hmm
sorry, who was that? I don't remember their names really
oh shit that scene
lol
funi installed spyware on your pc and blocks it
https://twitter.com/CoffeeCultist/status/1424829850540560387?s=20 :3
heh
wtf

WUHU
nice one
https://twitter.com/Ikxi__/status/1426504955679199235?s=20 mine is a pen holder
congrats
your screen displays it on a 2d surface

now she accidentally made something like a love potion or something
oops
(of course it stayed wholesome and she was instantly knocked out cold)
and now her teacher is trying to destroy all ingredients and recipes lol


||Zyska (mc) takes in small abandoned rabbit pet with very advanced cancer, but of course cancer does what is does best||
3rd chapter already hitting in the feels
damn this manga is great
it's really wholesome but also serious
about a little girl who can heal mystical creatures with magic and her teacher
need more Koneko
and watch what I haven't watched
maybe I should also do that at some point
nice
ahh
which season is that
It won't work.
Konosuba wasn't that fun to me really, more annoying, so if it's similar in humour then I know I won't really like it
so, don't watch it
gotcha
o.0
wait madoke and shaft?
it is
lmao
ohh wait I have read part of that once
love how it has 2 descriptions lol
Soße?
her Clementine voice in Overlord is crazy good
NOOOOOOOOOOO
remake of what?
his sis in this new world
dunno, the anime was not that good
read all manga chapters of dragon no tamago
now maybe sleep
yes
I would say she is more demon than dragon
That one's good yuri, though not craving that rn, I have read a lot of chapters of it, even before it got officialy published by webtoons
ohh ok
don't mind slow stuff, if it's at least interesting in some ways
what's the name?
dragon no tamago seemed interesting but couldn't keep my attention
life with a tail was promising but 50 chapters in it got really meeeh
anything with dragons mayhaps?
I think I tried otherside at one point
idk though, can't remember if I opened the first chapter or just did something else lol
some people said tower of god takes a bit to get good too
but I liked it from the beginning so I understand
I still have so many manga in the shelf next to me too....
I don't like skipping stuff and if something takes several books to *maybe* catch me then I'll be better off finding something that will catch my interest earlier
didn't like the start and mc's personality
nope nope nope
I tried that one
ahhhhh noooot bookworm
too many wn and ln chapters
over 1000 manga chapters
like, there must be at least 200-300 new webtoon chapters to read
a TON of unread webtoon chapters
several wn in my reading list
I have over 70gb of manga and dunno what to read
What more could I need?
More AinCiel
ahhh idk what to read! someone recommend me some good isekai or fantasy shit
(no villainous stuff)
the manga is nice
I know where my 2nd paycheck is going
I WANT NOW

mahou shoujo site has magical girls
there is an idol too
fate/kaleid liner prisma illya
has magical girls
kaleid
btw, fate/stay night: unlimited blade works
not fate/stay night (og isn't as good)
didn't like stay night, but that's just my taste
if you want some basic explanation stay night or zero
start with the one that's most appealing
bing
you don't have to follow it tbh
the love lives aren't really connected
each their own story with references to the other
it's connected if the word after "fate/" is the same
besides the heaven's feel movies
you can watch each just alone
fate/kaleid illya <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ohh the manga has finished?
gonna try the manga then
was the manga good, ash?

I am *always* forgetting what seirei gensouki is
I always see it in my library again but can never remember the synopsis
10 chapters read
is an ok story
some fun stuff
have to see how the author builds the world though and what kind of character development is going to happen, probably no character development though and just increasingly absurd things to expand the world
gonna read it in a bit
seems pain
10 chapters only


did I get into <#336297808221044736> lol
what was it about?
o.0
sing for us too
||the audition <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> ||
||what's gonna happen to all the fish||
has 299 chapters
several of them ch999


sounds weird
saber caster?
sooo
what
wait
what if fgo just had illya as every class lol
also no illya saber listed there...
that's not king arthur
ahh that time
why a penis?
red saber is the umu one?
hahahaha
which
we had cute girls using spices already
o.o
"Since then I’ve made several daily videos. I became the world’s first alien yutuber."

it's kinda weird
hahaha
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/ive-been-reincarnated-so-im-going-to-try-trading-with-earth-by-myself-ts-magical-girl-and-game-loving-adventure-story/
At least my brain autocorrects most of it when reading so it's not as bad
found new wn to read
grammar is.... definitely non native English speaker
also the tler releases like every 3 days, quality suffers a lot uff
haha
she is currently releasing super mario on the switch for aliens
this is fucking sad
rip masterani.me
twist.moe is nice because no ads
but basically just HorribleSubs
saw some cute stuff of it
that op is great
lol
that one is nice
"Didn't I say to make my abilities average!?"
manga and wn there are a lot
anime hmm
don't like the design of the bearsuit much
I imagined it much puffier and not this thin
I only read wn to 130 something
haha
you've consumed too incest
the younger one likes the older ones boobs but nothing romantic being even hinted at
the two are just sisters

nothing more
no
it's supposed to be something like an ingame helper npc
but it's just annoying
it's so weird
for some reason after the web novel they introduced a really annoying side character in this story

**YES**
pain
It was how I discovered Kiddy Grade and then rediscovered 10 years later
YES
they are still being used in schools here
even Aoi Yuuki?
wait what
hahaha
I might just need to watch it for luls
**RIGHT THIS EXISTS HAHAHAHAHAHAAHA**
this one this one this one this ones this one

I watched that like EVERY WEEKEND
I loved it so much
no clue about English names
don't even know the German names
yepp
I never understood plot of power rangers but it was really cool to watch
this was also just stupid hahaha
this was on jetix????
that show was really cool by what I remember
this one too
yea could have been another channelk
but also non anime
Galactic Football was great
Eureka Seven maybe too or could have been another channel
shaman king at 4am
yep yep
yes!
god that mc looks bad
really fun noble lady that loves to punch people
"May I Please Ask You Just One Last Thing?"
lol
this mamga just looks so nice
seems like this one is going to be fun


uhhh
manga is ok to good
ahhh that one
is it with demons nominating people as their whatever?
realist hero?
I think I read a manga like that once
lol
Aoi Yuuki
yes
quite calm in contrast to the last few chapters of high octane cuteness
just read latest AinCiel and it was cute
now waiting 2 years for the anime to release
***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA***
ohh **my GOD**
wot
I haven't watched it either
at least that's what I think
but has to do with the plot
nothing to do with taste
he meant that if Ash would be in the story, he wouldn't be real

WHAT
YOU DONT LIKE WHAT I LIKE?!§"!=?(%  !§%§)=TU§
this is cool, but Gravity Wall
ahh yes ane naru mono

``I also played with torrent files and generated a 2.6GB single .torrent file, but decided against releasing that one.``
``We obviously had to use h264-8bit@420fps Hi444 with crf51 to encode black frames on the 1080p version.``

lol
https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1444155192577040386?s=20
character is called Yueji Ming Ke
tight
...lmao
wanted to reread a wn and the page is just 1/3 I think it's a retired vtuber from nijisanji if I'm not wrong
LmAO
interesting
huh
wait, I somehow only noticed now that it said "Irina" in the subs there
how did I not notice that earlier lol
I think you should stop maybe for a month with higurashi and yuyuyu then
You seem to be discovering some abyss lol
lol
what
??
?
lol

or like at least it's not like they are just drones
there are people in the drones, right?
same with kabaneri or bna
ohh 86 is *that* kind of anime
ehhh nah not gonna watch it

I don't really like those animes where it's just 1 group that's just universally hated or discriminated against
you know what, fuck sleep, time for anime
ahh
what is this one?
üff
what attitudes are the interesting chars?
then why the fuck does it need to open with these 3 bitches
I probably just phrased it wrong in the first message
same with bullies in highschool animes kinda
I just **hate** the characters that always act like they are so much better than anyone or better than that specific group they are laughing at
obnoxious pieces of garbage
btw, is the anime actually with russians or was it just translated weird?
@/irina
I meant those things could probably also appear in other programs
100%
nah put in blender, rendered each frame
then screenshot it
yea lol
I usually see pixelation like that when I rendered an image and haven't saved it yet
*I like that one*
onii-sama?
executed well?
or even side characters
like the million other anime mc
ahh misfit of demon king academy
ahh ok
who is that
anos?
Ariel doesn't care about the humans destruction or whatever happens
She just wants ||to save the goddess from being used up by the system||
Shun, Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka

To Love-Ru
Highschool DxD
He has watched a number of ecchi harem shows
<@279341087494242304>
my father is watching Kämpfer
same
or every 5 pages
When reading I will notice all the grammar mistakes
Anime has but less text, just subs, so I can notice less mistakes
ohhh you'd be surprised by the kumo discord
kumo desu *manga*
this is also a spicy one
sooo many people seem to hate it xD
hahaha
And not to forget 7/10 and dropped for Violet Evergarden lol



https://anilist.co/user/Ikxi/animelist just look at all those 10/10s on my list
MANY people would disagree with me lol
tl;dr
everything has a subjective rating
or both
or tragedy
I know nothing about aquatope
and I haven't clicked on the spoiler
but I'm just gonna assume it's something about characters being very gay
idk

I would say
azur lane was also not "recently"

azur lane and kancolle have gotten animes years ago

bd is worse on sophia?
wait
~~it's the 3rd here, it counts~~

my father's now watching rosario vampire s2

just found out my father also watched ore wa twintail

hahaha
what this?
this is a fucking weird one
also like
2nd link in the video description
its from an anime
rip
pain peko
maybe
pain peko
I will try!


o.o
the recruiting page is only in jp
probably only jp speaking
lol
they are recruiting
conditions of the job are not ideal
and I really don't want to work that much if i don't have to
would be possible I think, but like, really difficult I imagine
so the position at orange would be even more under minimum wage
and it's gonna increase in January and then July again
that's 10.87 usd
per hour
9.60€
also
at 10:00 to 19:00 job for 220k yen a month
if I'm reading that correctly
~1700€/month
that is under German minimum also
yostar? is there a golf gacha game?
symphogear invented ninjas
this is kinda the most gay it gets afaik

1 girl, they are together
other girl is a childhood friend, plot does not really go there much
Two of the mcs might actually be into each other, but it's not explained
not really gay, but slight yuri moments, kinda
accel world dural magisa garden has 4 female MCs in an only girls school
og accel world is straight
is cute
spin off from accel world
Accel/World Dural Magisa Garden
ahh I missed this manga, it's fun and cute :3
**I LOVE THIS ONE**
look at the thumbnail, ash
No one will be spared
those were two separate thoughts
I just listed anime I recommend
I didn't say those are ecchi
lol
ghost stories dub is top
Happy Sugar Life is fun
ik it has a lot of ecchi stuff cause my father watches there all the time
aren't most anime on prime video ecchi stuff?
at least in Germany
ah
Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha
**SAKEBEEEEEEEE**
Haven't watched that one
Maybe at dome point
Mahou Shoujo Site
Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya
Yuki Yuna was Yuusha de aru
Puella Magi Madoka Magica

Trinity Seven
code geass
no game no life
mondaiji tachi
death note
lol
you can say ecchi
just spoiler tag it
what genres?
*symphogear*
good one
also ehm
trigger word -> ||rape|| should not be included in the image or censored
top left to bottom right is just madoka
after work
yea
I just noticed I haven't read since 79.5 lol
the chapters update so sloooow
new chapter?????
waaaaiiiit
and they thing for SOME FUCKING REASON THAT **TANKS IN MMOS ARE WEAK**
like bitches come on, the tanks keep the boss off your ass so you can be on top of dmg meters, stfu
yea, and that makes everyone else do stupid things like thinking he has a brainwashing shield, leaving a rotting dragon carcass somewhere and making the land bad for crops or something
still hating him AFTER HE SAVED THEIR FUCKING LIVES
but not like cool or anything
ehh he is ok
they are fucking idiots
shield hero
it's really really annoying
so often other summoned heroes are crap
(my standards for manga are quite a lot higher than for anime lol)
6.5/10 I'd say
was ok
didn't like it too much
is that the one where the protag can't speak the common language and has to learn other ones?
no male protags for him it seems xD
lul
ash is out
and the relationship with the bird and raccoon was mostly meh
in contrast to that I like arifureta's couple relationship more and even that went downhill later on when it became a harem
use all the deleted words to make a new story
haha
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
did someone say miracle?
yea, but they do not participate in the tournament and aren't related to the player
I could just do it without telling my friend
so I can go up to my friend and give him exodia?
wat
ohh my god this seems cool
Ookami Shounen Wa Kyou Mo Uso O Kasaneru: Vol.1 Chapter 1, page 5

time to read this again
get all the light novels, there is more story there
that scene was so disappointing -.-
the animations were just so bad, at least if the animations were good the bad models could have been excused something
yea if they don't even bother with the letters, the cgi won't get any better either
I love overlord but wtf kadokawa, why still the bad cgi
lol
she looks cute
There are probably also several people who don't know that Einstein is German
many of those stuck around
that name is from when people had their occupation as their last name
wtf dutch
beautiful head
wtf Japan
it's also German
......
Japanese are coming up with really weird names
church ice
cool
xDD
new slime chapter starts of great xD
that's how they also draw animal buttholes
can there be gaseous and plasma definitions too?
https://news.qoo-app.com/en/post/78923
lol what
WUUUU POLITICS!
aniplex things
I also need more chs of this ahhhhh
I need to find out what's happening
||is vampire girl safe? wtf are shiro and gyurigyuri doing? how long will that go on for? is the maou safe?||
pain peko
Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka wn will soon be 1 year hiatus again
I love both of them
Both have fun MCs, fun side characters, amazing mindgames, ecchi
Problem children also has violence which is cool
I hope they never make another cgdct anime and ainciel goes on hiatus
*I hope someone gifts you an NFT for Christmas*
Ash
not scared of vampires now?
and it's like mega awesome ultra hype and I have been waiting so long for more
the wn is probablly really close to ending
now he said some new chapters again
last new year the author said he'll release some new chapters, but that stopped in February
web novel
Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka
***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA***
new kumo desu wn chapters
https://ncode.syosetu.com/n7975cr/589/
***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA***
that looked weird
when the isekai didn't need to be an isekai to begin with
ok that one seems pretty fun!
just type part of the name
https://mangadex.org/title/fd41659a-e4ce-458f-b087-8032b7a5fab9/neta-chara-tensei-toka-anmarida
it is
sauce
the synopsis already read like yaoi, so I just glossed over that part
found out lol
ahh ok
what does abo mean?
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/all-round-mid-laner/
like wtf
esports isekai
what
who even has an idea like that
I just found an esports isekai lol
though that translation seemd to have stopped in october, sadly
<@!171395487247630336>
https://www.novelupdates.com/series/neta-chara-tensei-toka-anmari-da/ there is a web novel
24 chapters tl'ed
so not that much to translate
the raws are up to ch12, ash said
yea
<@!189292234678468609> it's this manga
xD
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
all chapters read -.-
I love scenes like this sooooo much
ahhhh the bad guys fucked up and mc is gonna go to town with them
hahaha
the art style is growing on me
first the faces seemed kinda weird
yea
the others have 20-30 kinda
that was only ch1

haha
https://c.tenor.com/Ru4zPgZR9JYAAAAM/drew-scanlon-blonde-guy.gif
Dumbalf?
https://youtu.be/prIMdFSDIfg
looked okay-ish until the 3d monster
also Mira's outfits look kinda weird
light blue dress but red cloak
her outfits in the manga are great
so just staying with the manga/ln for that one?
they didn't know that was possible?
what
hahahaha
after ch 20 kinda
a dragon wants too
yes
......
that
S-Rank Monster no Behemoth Dakedo, Neko to Machigawarete Erufu Musume no Kishi (Pet) Toshite Kurashitemasu
what
no
wait
ye
that chapter had a bath scene
yea the fanservice doesn't let up
ohh uff
I like it, but I understand where you're coming from
ahh
ye
that cat is the mc
also has a manga and ln
https://youtu.be/NA4DTggH9GM
some parts I like less though I still like them enough to not straight up drop it
ahh ok
why would that be? because the stories feel all over the place?
lul

FUNA-sensei's storys are great
they are always about the mc making some new crazy plans and then outwitting the opposition in funny ways
from waging war to running a potion selling store to managing a territory as viscount
Ajin
I should continue reading that
heh
was wondering since when you spoke French
Cure <:Ver:704169051391524875>
cure top
huh
*can honkai please already get an anime?*
caught up to latest, 52, chapter
right, <@171395487247630336> ?
Fran is cute, even when splitting people in half
not just the spin-off cooking show
what the s stand for?
even says gear
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAVF3Fhk6WN4eF1Uuymd1w/ there's also a yt channel it seems
oooooooohhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
anime about god
should continue reading ut
that one's interesting
that one!
OHHHH
what's the second one?
o.o
abother one?
what happened
wut
as long as it's not weird offbrand figures than that's probably a really good way to support it
https://tenor.com/view/umm-confused-wtf-blinking-okay-gif-7513882
?
I'll probably just skil those then and keep to the manga
üff
and this is chapter "Final Battle 19" out of 21 
there are no more chapters after 21 because Okina is being...... Okina
this is gonna end with a huge motherfucking cliffhanger
ahhh feck already done with the chapter
horimiya?
```shiro: Yep, that’s right, most living things would die if you blew away half their body wouldn’t they……```
ohh right new kumo chapter was translated
time to read suffering
haha
even if she can do that well enough herself xD
protecc
fran is a cutie
or "While Killing Slimes for 300 Years, I Became the MAX Level Unknowingly"
you know it will be an OP character story that's gonna be a bit dumb/clumsy (because of the "Unknowingly" part)
or also "I Was a Sword When I Reincarnated"
same format but a very interesting thing, reincarnated as an object, I know I'll want to check this out
mondaijitachi and snafu are other early examples of that
as far as I know syosetsu( and novelupdates for that matter, if you want an English site) have wn with very loong and descriptive titles
I think it's basically an easy way to make a name for a story without having to come up with something difficult
https://youtu.be/9gIXoaB-Jik
***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH***
and Shiro can't even enter cities lol
why did the demon king start calling her shiro-chan though
||D has yet to give Kumo a name||
I also wonder how Sophia will start calling her Goshojin-sama when there's ||no card game made by an old god that let's every bet come true||

yea, somehow anime adaptations just never know what pacing is
I read some of the later arifureta ln chapters
basically meh harem
nothing of that edgy cool story that it was at the beginning
it's still painful to watch though
ik that
yes
totally
it's cringey rp
yea but
this ep of saoa hurts
they are rp-ing
ahhh
lol
it will be time again
to binge all of saoa
üff
no
https://youtu.be/9gIXoaB-Jik premiering now
and humanity didn't try backstabbing itself while still fighting evil
when was the last time the demon king actually evil?
I don't think yumi here is Japanese
and Yumi was Japanese
yes
nah it isn't. because 1 name is different it's now the worst of all time, it's so bad

actually being the mecha

not like knights & magic
anyone interested in mecha isekai?
I have also found plant isekai
yes
these Chinese wns are so weird
or maybe it's just the font
i think
this art looks familiar o.o
artist from kumo ln
webnovels be weird
"When Shillong found that his mother is a 200 years old silver dragon, but had the appearance of a beautiful elf, he vowed to bring the age of entertainment and nuclear peace to the entire universe!
War is a bad habit! Any country that still has this habit will face my nuclear peace breath!"

what
whaaaaaaaaat
you read the differently
from left to right
and a lot of them are in "webtoon" format
pages are made in a way that you scroll down while reading
because they are a different style
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Kanade would just stare at the truck and it would stop

it's on scribble hub
this getting a manga has low chances

idol isekai
https://www.scribblehub.com/series/244100/idol-is-the-strongest-job-in-this-world--reincarnated-as-an-idol/
ohh god

ik
1 or 2 minor mistakes in each chapter, but the chapters are so goddamn long
binging it right now and loving it
Tree of Aeons is surprisingly great
lol

those chapters are loooong
damn the tree isekai is actually fun
dunno
reminds me, I should see if reincarnated as an onsen has any new chapters
yikes
I still need to read that one
hahahaha

I just kinda wanna watch it because the visual are just fucking crazy/weird
decent/mediocre
eeehhhh
if you like a guy who constantly makes his harem bigger, can defeat anything, albeit with some difficulty
the story is nothing like the edgy stuff when he's in the cave at the beginning
wasn't there also a 4chan attempt at this?
but there are still ones more powerful than her

huh
and having a magical creature companion
and fighting monsters
and having beautiful women around him
and being a guy
and being isekaied
though this guy isn't anything close to ainz besides a skeleton and being op
like ainz has his inner thoughts voice and his overlord voice

no direct way, though the one you'll drive on in Germany for most of the time is A2
there are many roads to Berlin, A13 for example
I'm wondering, how the fuck does flying work with something like *that*
sooo idol strike witches?

https://youtu.be/L3ymBk6Vb04
and a pretty important one at that
I think the message has a lot more weight because so many more people are behind this and worked on this, yea I'll probably won't listen to the song again either but I don't think that was the effect he wanted to get
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvuN_WvF1to

lmao it seems she has @music <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> now remembered fully
give her some time
ahh ok
lol jii
the main thing next to the drums between 1:30 and 1:40 was it
ahh ok
it was something very minor, that changed with the mp3 and I think most of it is just that the part in general is to me kinda weird
sounded a bit smoother, probably as you guessed, soundcloud did a bit
ahh ok, could you send an mp3 file or something?
Doesn't sound like something I'd actively listen to, more like a background song, probably in a fight scene or similar in a game; Probably a game with only text dialogue and no voice actors kinda, some 2d plat former, somehow Touhou Luna Night came to mind, maybe because I just saw a vid
Sounded kinda weird with the distorted(?) sounds at around 1:35

Overall sounded good

But I don't see it on soundcloud
ahhh
gotta wait a *few* months for that xD
A remix?
***Padoru***
k
ahh ok, because it has the same cover art
Yea, that's cool
What was the song "Nightmares" for, for a nightmare scene or just a horror scene?
ahh cool
just for devs, or community?
> *VERY*
xD
name? :3
ahh very cool
Going for a walk through a lush, green forest
Or just adventuring on the over world
Maybe a random encounter could happen, but probably not
Just collecting things for a fetch quest
Or walking through a town, talking to some npcs

Very chill
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Listening to "Zoe"
songs from 8 years ago
<:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>
Sounds very cool
Maybe something that would fit in a 2d action game, like Metroid or Castlevania come to mind, when you explore and fight against some mobs.
The song doesn't get you on edge as if you were about to fight a big boss.

https://youtu.be/NCMJnTBZfeE I unironically love this song and video
https://youtu.be/UiKOf4jNbm8

until I finally found it
and typed any anime that it could have been into google
I just looked through this list
I also finished watching love live at around that time I think and wanted more idol shows.
But instead I got a fucking banger.
if I hadn't watched this like 20 times, I wouldn't really have cared
this was the reason I got into symphogear

any guitar players can check that?
