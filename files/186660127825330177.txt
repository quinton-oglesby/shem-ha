I'm not trying to be unwelcoming? But if that's the impression given it's not my intention.
Admittedly, I never use <#377148557796442134> channel normally <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222> I just figured people didn't have a place to talk about it given how often its brought up in unrelated channels and the like. I just figured people would like to have a place to talk about their interests given how much passion there is for it.
Since there has been a lot of talk of sentai stuff and Kamen Rider especially lately, would it be possible to make an appropriate channel in hobbies and interests? I feel like it would be something a lot of people would use
I'm sorry for your loss, but I did not suggest that getting help has an age requirement and I resent the implication as such. If you want to bring in personal tragedies to justify your point you're more than welcome to do so, but I am not going to debate something I didn't even say in the first place.

I brought up that minors seeing some content that can come up in what should be a 18+ server could result in the server getting terminated and wanted to bring caution to that. Which would, incidentally, ALSO remove this place as somewhere someone at risk could reach out for help on. A discord server with 1000 people in it should not be your go to place for something, but the people you meet in it can be those you reach out too and definitely encourage people to do so if feeling at risk.  You don't need access to serious discussions for that.
I mean to be brutally honest a discord server with over 1000 people in it should not be your goto place for your problems on way or the other, but I was more thinking about TOS stuff and discord having nuked a lot of servers as of late
Is it? Minors post it it quite often
have we put thought into making <#336297840529899522>  an 18+ only channel? Given the severity of some of the content in that channel at times, and with discords ever changing TOS, it might be better safe than sorry.
Where would we be without our thankless alchemists? ❤️
Your work is very appreciated~
seemed very automatic to me, it cleared ir right away when i figured it out
I am so proudo f Chris, and how much she has grown. I love all my children, but my little fluff  is precious

if you vomit, thats pretty normal
its okay to relax about things
also, in general, like shit that seems like it matters in highschool, dosnt
best thing to do though? in regards to your friends, commuincate with them. Let them know your concerns, that you are worried about having a bad trip, about losing control, etc. Your anxieties regarding it, are not things that are unique to you, many of your friends probably very similar concerns.
especially in highschool
and that paranoia, SUCKS
Having read the context, and speaking from my own personal experience of having been in similar situations of growing up in a very anti drug part of ohio and being paralyzed by fear of being possibly incriminated, i can definitely tell you this. Your concern is reasonable, but not certain. Don't let people pressure you into things thaat make you uncomfortable, and if being around weed makes you uncomfortable, don't be afraid to set that boundry, but as someone who spent so much of highschool being PARALYZED by paranoia, fear of losing control, and of the second I look at a joint the cops break down my door, I look back now and just giggle at how I was worried about nothing.  our brains can be silly things sometimes.
it depends. Some things in life can only be taken seriously, other things, it's better to just relax, let things go.

Politics, interpersonal relationships, worth taking seriously.

someones opinion on a movie? live and let live~ (just examples)
exactly!
Especially for a first time user who has anxiety over losing control
Edibles can be very strong, would not recommend
i wish i could go through my life for one day without having to account for my fibro
I know nothing about indian politics, so i won't comment. I can only reference as to how much america loves to pimp out poor kids to the military while people in power vote to fuck states that need economic help, making a never ending cycle of poorly funded schools, poorly educated communities, being continuinally exploited.
it's more of overlooking the underlying problems that comes with smart, education = good person
thats not even in the top 100 worst biden gafs
pete is worthless, biden is somehow worse than useless
A dangerous aspect of self diagnosis is the fact that a lot of people, especially younger people, do not know how much physical and mental health are linked, and can cause the others. And relying on self diagnosis for (as an arbitrary example) depression and not seeking medical help for it, can result in you not realizing you have a potentially life threatening illness.

The catch 22 of course being, healthcare fucking sucks in large parts of the world, especially america, where self diagnosis is often the only option to find answers into shit. It's a fucking travesty
jesus
oh?
between trump and brexit, its fucking pitiful how bad people are at organizing against osmething
i wish i that problem was exclusive to  india
complicated
gives me a heacache just tinking about
christ
but economic and capitalist factors have it situated in such a way that it strictly benefits people to get rich bankrolling one party or the other and most often both
Our desperate attempts to do so is a big reason the party lines are so fractured
neither can american politics
i mean
fuck em
Centrists are cowards with people buying their loyalty
railroads would be so stupidly universally beneficial to so many people here, and we absolutely refuse to do anything with it for a variety of complicated exploitive reasons
look no further then the lack of proper railway is here
if you want a good idea as to how boneheadedly fucking stupid america is
Ellen is *also* guilty of giving huge platforms to transphobic crap
highly visual queer person who only cares about things that personally affects them and is right of center about most other things because $$$
shes very Ellen
but in reality is just socially left only in regards to things relevant to her
she tries to market herself as being super far left
the face of trans youtube and all that
she definitely markets herself as it
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
in addition to constantly giving platforms to terf rhetoric, trying to set herself up as this big victim of "cancel culture" like thats a thing that exists, and throwing NB people under the buss at any and all possible oppurtunities
more of the "im sorry you were offended" kind of apology, not actually being sorry
^
he's a south park republican, a lib in name only, and a chicken shit centrist (but I repeat myself)
but while Obama ran on the platform of being "not George Bush", Mayor Pete isn't even gutsy enough to be not donald trump
Mayor Pete is trying to be 08 Obama, but with about 90% less charisma
especially in recent memory
America is very guilty of falling into cults of personality in terms of electing officials
its astonishing how far things have come in 20 years
and not wish they wern't gay
I don't know how ANYONE could grow up in America, especially during the 90s and bush administration
so if he wants to tell some sob story about how hard it was when he was a kid, he can cry into his money and how completely unaffected his day to day life will be if the policies he wants to implement, get implemented.
The difference between him and me, is that he is an official looking to directly block access that determines if people who he is trying to get votes from live or die or not, all the while amongst his other terrible terrible policies
HE wanted to take a magic pill to not be gay when he was a kid? Great, me too. I can relate, that dosn't make him special
I'm not attacking him on his sexuality, I'm attacking him on his attempts to *use* his sexuality as a platform, while undermining LGBT+ healthcare
I think the indictment comes from the fact that Pete's perfectly okay with throwing queer healthcare under the bus, while at a townhall trying to relate to midwest america by quipping about erasing his own sexuality
most of whih is either soft ball dog shit, centrist crap, or empty promises
i care about the dudes policies
who cares about the clip?
Mayor Pete is a fucking loser
lol
possible
not
thats
the person who made this test definitely thinks owning a copy of v for vendetta is the same thing as being a member of a political party
yeah no the test is a total joke
Jokes on this test, my views are far more radical then the results would suggest lol
Was just taking the same one that the others took
this is south park politics levels of over simplification
"A group of states without a strong national government is merely an alliance, not a nation"

This is the best case I can find of this test being made by some dipshit who probably voted for Gary Johnson. The implication is that one or the other is inherantly surperior
"Local governments can understand their citizens better than the national government could"

Could this be more american centric?
in highschool
ive read better political allignment tests back when I took a government class
These questions are a crock of shit
The problems with anything like this, and party government in general, is that politics often involve things that are far too complicated to simplify down into list form. Especially in two party governments
god that'd have to be well over 1K videos
idek what that would total up too
that was how I first watched every episode of Sailor moon subbed from start to finish
*shakes cane* baack in my day youtube only had AMV's to linkin park! we didnt have your kissanime or crunchyroll, we watched out anime in 1 of 3 parts at 240p and we LIKED IT
and YT let's em make money off em, even while flagging LGBTQA+ content creators for no reason whatsoever
the rabbit hole of MRA/Nazi/Redstate shit birds is Very easy to find, no place more so then youtube
and RIP your recommended video feed
watch one sargon of akkad video
but i tell you what
youtube likes to think it's not a platform for nazis
its a lot of dumb shit
it's fucking stupid
i think he tried to backpeddle and say that landis would have ruined his YT career if he wasnt friends with him?
and hbomberguy quietly disassociated himself from him
shortly thereafter the stuff about Weinstein broke out, and Landis had all the accusations made about him over the years come to light, and left twitter
somehow eve weirder
Landis responded by writing a hypothetical screenplay of a scene of himself walking away from an oncoming storm with hbomberguy's voicei n the distance
and bomberguy FREAKED out on twitter and wrote like a 15 chain tweeted thing to Landis apologizing.
*something* happened when star wars TFA came out and Landis wrote about rey being a mary sue, and hbomberguy also released a video making fun of MRA's who hated star wars and a lot of people did what people do and linked bombberguy and Landis together on it
He's the son of John Landis, the same director who famously killed children on the Twilight Zone movie, and who is thought to have helped sweep a lot of Landis's "incidents" under the rug
And he also has been an open secret as a serial sexual assaulter in the LA scene
Who was/is? a big fan and friend of bomberguy
he's a hollywood screenwriter and producer
Max Landis isn't a youtuber
Max Landis as well
he's mostly fine, but he associates himself with a lot of folks he shouldnt
most flat earthers arent lol
hbomberguy actually tried to do a video on "reasonable" flat earthers and the like and found the biggest problem with it is that well
i try to avoid it if i can
that a dude who was pretending to be a flat earther died in a stunt to prove the earth was flat
i will offer up
while true
but is also probably just scamming MRA's
the dude is just nine kinds of drinking his own koolaid
look up sargon of akood
embarrasing shit
if you ever want to do a deep dive of just
but just been parroting the shit because idiots will give them money to pretend to scream at feminists
There's been tons of instances of like right wing youtubers revealing they are super leftist
hey it's a viable strategy
Enable capitalism
they are jokes
because well
back in the college days we'd take them as jokes
oh yeah
this is what happens when people think watching south park is the same thing as taking politics class
"I AM FIRMLY COMMITTED TO HAVING NO STRONG FEELINGS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER"
❤️
get rest
same
its actually sickening
The NRA get so much money in donations eeverytime a shooting happens
Every school shooting is free PR for them
best thing to happen to them
The NRA LOVES dead kids
Oh god no
They are radicalized by the like of Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and the various politicians on NRA payroll
But the people opposing it are not sensible
You're right.
Unfortunately
'Murrica
The myth of the gun has informed so much of American culture as a result of the revolutionary war. It's informed so much of it that it has made another revolutionary war all but fucking impossible to win.
It's ironic
Policy, is the only relevant place that real change can happen, but doing so infringes on the inherant limited protections against said police state, while also being fruitless, as the NRA has bankrolled a good portion of people in charge of making those decisions
so we are stuck in a situation where we live amongst a police state that we are naturally inclined to arm ourselves against, but said police state is the most powerful military force in the entire world and dedicates more than half of it's entire national budget to improving said military, which is becoming increasingly autonomous
but that's a conversation most people aint ready to have.
you'd think that the past four decades of the US destabalzing the middle east would paint a clear picture to people that shit will happen here too if push came to shove
Got drones for that
Don't even need soldiers to do it anymore
There' nothing that literally hundreds of thousands of gun owner can do that can't be undone by the Us military
Outside of full blown civil war
Not that any of it matters, in regards of using firearms to oppose the police state that we live in
Guns are as inherant to our national heritage, far more so then the flag. It is not an instrument of self preservation, it is an absolute religous institution. Regardless of the statistics, tragedies, or policy changes, the myth of the gun = freedom is as universal as the cross being associated with christ
The gun debate is one that is unfortunately, at a stoploss in America
Gattaca is a fantastic movie, well worth watching just to see what kind of hellscape we are likely headed for
While spouting talking points used by people in positions of power to defund welfare programs
But you completely fail at articulating those points
You complain about people taking your points out of context
What, "whole" system
So why bring it up?
regardless of if people are "lazy" or not
but understand the shit you're spouting off is language deliberately designed by policy makers to defund welfare programs
idk how to tell you that you should probably care about other people
idk anything about mexico's welfare policies, but i do know the anti welfare shit when i see it
What country do you live in?
that shit kills people
and attempts to establish scrutinize individuals who are forced to rely on welfare by seeing if they are too "lazy" or whatever
You cannot live on welfare in anyway comfortably, especially in the states
full stop, the whole "Stop lazy people from living on welfare" crap, is just that, crap
^
You are actively choosing to not let this argument die
Your context sucks
People would die under the points you try to advocate for
No shit they're not
when you are literall saying "People deserve to be poor
Nothing to back up your argument beyond whining that you're points are being taken out of context
No data
You come up in here, with no statistics
Cry abouti t
So are we
Bold arguments, expect it to return in kind
Because Carlos here, thinks people human rights being infringed upon, is a better alternative then them being "lazy"
I know the answer solo
Oh bull fucking shit
You are literally saying people deserve to be poor
you don't need my help for that
If people spent half as much energy trying to help people out of poverty instead of hating them for being poor, there might be less poor people in the world
Jesus fucking christ
Bold argument to advocate for children starving
Thank you for understanding our frustration on it enough to want to educate yourself more on the subject.
Educating yourself on any subject is always a good thing to do.
Reading up on things, is the best thing you can do. Inform yourself, about the ways that people talk in regards to people in the situations you are assuming are being exploited. Welfare is one of the most universally contested things in the world, the amount of stuff you can find by looking it up is quite literally endless. Inform yourself, and understand why so many of us get so angry when you say some of the things you say. There are those of us who have lost loved ones, or who have come close, or have actively experienced homelessness and worse as a result of welfare benefits being taken away. Information and education on the matter, is the best thing you can do for yourself in regards to this matter.
No one wants to hear it
Take your gaslighting  shit out of here
Don't apologize for things you're not sorry for
You are hopelessly ignorant if you don't think that people have died because of poverty
> this all sparked because someone said that no one deserved to be poor, to which I disagree (and still do)
<@!453836798796234762>
You don't like it, cry about it. Other people are dying in poverty, be glad that worse thing happening to you is people are yelling at you iin a discord server because you say people deserve to be poor
Funny how that works
So are we
You're participation in this conversation is something entirely of your own volition
Saying "Certain people deserve to be poor" is legit, terrifying
^
You spout shit that everyone who has ever ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED being on welfare has heard be screamed at them
Yeah, those conclusions people try to draw from are trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, it just aint gonna fit. Relationships are too complicated for numbers, people cheat and stay together all the time, people stay married for their kids and money purposes but live seperately and have different partners, etc etc
I mean, when it comes down to it, statistics and interpersonal relationships will always have a hard line disconnect. Simply because, well, relationships are far too complicated to be represented by numbers
trying to crowbar relationships into something that works for another person but not for you is what ruins so many good relationships
exactly!
That's where me and my SO's unconventional relationship kind of conflict with it. We love each other deeply but are incredibly free spirited and independent. We have no desire to get married, have kids, or even live together, not because we don't think we could stand each other, but it's jsut something thats not necesarry for our relationship. What we have for us works, and both encourage the other to pursue additional romantic partners as well, so long as simple things like communicating honestly os maintained. It's definitely not a type of relationship that can work for everyone, but me and SO have been together for several years now, and while unconventional, it works for us.
Ultimately, it's a personal decision. I never see myself getting married, but I have not ruled it out
No relationship works without trying really, really hard at it. Friends, family, partners. People disagree, they get angry, get hurt, lash out, ,close themselves off, put on a fake smile or forget how to smile entirely. They take work, and if you're really, really lucky, you can find people in your lfie willing t put in just as much effort as you. Be it friends, parents, partners, whatever it may be.
it's a personal decision, for some people it has a lot of meaning, for others it dosnt
stay safe everyone
Earth quake in utah
This isn't a "oh my check engine light is on, I can ride it out for a while" kind of situation
As opposed to undereacting, and dying.
Overreacting and being able to look back at it and be like, "Man, I was way more careful then I needed to be."
You know what's awesome
its not a flat rule
Also the whole three week thing is greatly dependent on age, health, body, etc
It's gonna get real bad
And if the US does "reopen" on easter like that stupid orange cunt wants it too
It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better
Worthless bunch of cunts
Funny how all these impossible social systems suddenly become super viable once rich people are at risk
And who basically told the UK to sacrifice its oldp eople for the sake of capitalism
Yup
British PM
Boris Johnson has Corvid19
Man there's a lot to unpack on that marshall report. shocking what happens when cops lose their preferred targets
It's a "gotcha" prank. It's a shitty style of video, popularized by morons on 4chan
Oof
stay away from people raised by the internet
yeah by and large
Count yourself blessed
cause that's not edgy, it's *snuff*
And those people are the kind I'd like to stay the fuck away from me
I am well aware of those people cocoa
The morons who think screaming freeze peach protects them from screaming slurs at people at twitter and think watchign south park counts as an education
I would avoid it. sounds like the kind that fosters the worst part of the internet
You walk into a friends home and be like "Hey guys! Check out my beheading video!" and then you put it on the TV and everyone is freaking out and then you are like "guys relax, it's a joke!" what do you think is gonna happen?
Fuck that shit
"Aw come on! It's not that bad! that's just how he is!"
if thats the style of behavior common on that server, my advice would be to get away from that server
it dosnt matter if there's no fire
This is why you can't scream Fire in a movie theater
you have more time then you think you do
It might not feel like it, but trust me
I'm almost 30, and have hit the reset on my life more than once
I know this might seem like the most condescending advice ever, but honestly, legitamately, belive me when I tell you. The world does not end when you turn 19, or 20, and you don't have like a "path" set up
Boom iirc you are quite young yes? Just finishing highschool?
DM's are there for a reason

And they are not likely to be hiring people to sit at home when they are already operating at a loss
As they have filmed up to next month
They are not turning a profit, and unlike WWE, they don't have a many contracts, nor do they have positions to fill, or places to use them
AEW is not likely to be doing a lot of hirings
despite the fact that WWE has guranteed income through contracts and Vince just sold a shitload of stocks and has half a billion in cash
to celebrate this, WWE released like 20 members  of their roster today

As far as the UK goes, the whole country has spent the last four years lighting g itself on fire in regards to Brexit, with Refugees being a huge talking point. They do in fact care if you are there just to eat Cornish pastries
Moving to another country is complicated snd in a lot of places sll it takes is one phone call to make your life hell.
I live in America, we deport legal citizens by the hundreds every single day. We're not unique in that regard
The reason you did it is because it could be seen as "EWW an SJW post." Don't let it get to you.

For everyone else involved in this conversation, please keep that in mind.
That's what I thought
Lec, how old are you?
I have a genuine question.
that is a more reasonable statement
capitalism, actively *rewards* you for being the most horrible piece of shit dick of a person there is. it's not a matter of it in it's extreame state, it's a core part of it
Communism relies too much on people not being dicks. I don't disagree with that in the slightest, history, both ancient and modern, has shown this to be true.
compassion, kindness, and empathy, are roadblocks to captialism.
im not even sure what you are actually arguing
personal greed and self interest are in the DNA of captalism, which controls bodies of government as much as religeon does
i mean you're not wrong but you just described basically every form of government ever
it can be a good resource to help keep yourself off stuff you shouldnt be on, and even has a redirect function and enables a password and the like.

I'm not your therapist. But sounds like you should talk to one about it.
you have to understand lec, that th alt right *directly* goes after depressed young people who need a place to understanding. It's how they get people, it's not just a place of hatred and bigotry, its a place of hatred and bigotry that they disguise as acceptance of a person the world has rejected.
no offense but you are their target audience
a mistake
with the left eating itself to death through infighting which leads to inaction, while the right get's shit done with no cause or care about the ramfications it has on fiuture generations
america has the issue of havingg at least 6 different political parties all trying to be 2
the difference here in america, is liberals and dems try to be peaceful and noconfrontations, while Republicans have normalized modern eugenics in america right now and its not even newsworthy
as opposed to america, who elect them to be president
as a good portion of the world actually hates the nazis
its a largly very american term from what i understand
they are fucking nazis
but make no mistake
the alt right is how americans get away with bringing back neo nazis
Cypher, in the US at least
Someone being supportive of expressing gender identiity, and people who want to kill nonwhite in mass, are not comparable
this is an important thing to factor
^
this is why you should be seeking profesional help if its availble to you. It's not just a matter of you stopping this kind of behavior, but understanding why you are doing it
❤️ I hope things go as smoothly as possible.
Cutting people out of your life sucks, but you know what sucks more? Keepping that person in your life for longer and longer, becoming more miserable, and the memory of that person you once became friends with becoming a memory that you can't even think of fondly anymore. Sometimes its friends, sometimes it's family, but the thing is, you have to make yourself your own first priority. Your mental health is important, and if someone is doing shit to negatively effect it, you gotta keep em out. It sucks, but its the best thing to do, and it while it can  seem like a terrible thing at the time, give it a week, and see how much stress isn't in your life after it
if you were a racist asshole, why wouldnt you be a cop.
its a sick joke
Simply providing background context for the murderer
the officer in question has over a decade in hate crime involvment and police brutality charges
That is their mistake to make.
No matter how much it felt like they defined me between then and where im at now
And I can tell you right now. They don't define me.
I have had some bad days
Very well put
that includes things like guilt you feel over things in the past you've done
if you tear it, it takes time to heal
it's like a muscle
For lack of a better analogy
Which is normal. Things take time
There is a saying the best apology is changed behavior. But the words I'm sorry carry a lot of weight. Combining the two, and acknowleding the harm done is a big step that most do not take.
christ what take do you have to be on for that kinda shit
but sure. its *real* great that i can say that i have family who served in world war 2
and i have family who served in world war 2. and the korean war. and vietnam war, and the gulf war, and the iraq war. every single one of them abandoned by the government that told em to go die for em
I propose that it's on the government to serve their constituaties and their civilians, not jjust when its beneficial for them to use the kids as canon fodder for whatever country they wanna destablizie
wonder what kind of career those literal child soldiers are being groomed for hmmm
still a volunteer force
but yeah
Even taking into account the Draft still being osmething they can do, they still role out the red fucking carpet to all the poor and rural districts in the country to sell kids who don't know any better about how awesome it is to die for your country, when it is often the only career path possible for a lot of those disinfranchised children
for now
and the army would happily take em as young as they could get them
in the US you are straight up told to pimp your kids out to the military
oh for sure
the people that form militias like this would give ar15s to preteens in a heartbeat
Atlanta specifically
USA Georgia
literal child soldiers armed to the teeth are being deployed
people in georgia stay safe
Clearly.
Ooof
So are soldiers.

they are declaring antifa a terrorist organization for the exact reason that antifa isn't an organization.

that a few extra rainbows is enough to bother you
Such a charmed fucking life you must lead

my existance being an annoyance is an insult to who I am as a fucking person.

yeah. evangelical christians managed to use Reagan's influence to basically seed themsevles into every part of government
libertarians are still an absolute joke, and green party is well the green party
Dems are useless and republicans are about as literal nazis as you can get
America desperateely needs more political parties of significant power
We do too, but we still break them up into republicans and democrats
See in the states, if you're not 70+ crustacian who wants the nuke the fuck out of some part of the world you are considered "soft"
Ugh
I wish americans could experience shame
a reality that too many people who don't remember the bush years have repeatedly forgotten
so is US sadly
even if not ideal
which is better than alt right
stay safe bud. I've heard of the alt right nutjobs trying to set up power cells there. Idk enough about italian politics as to how succesful they are.
You're in italy right cypher?
it's a fucking enormous shit show
It's been four years almost, don't rely on the united states government to hold trump accountable for anything
But I don't think you are
hope you are right
from the bottom of the heart
Rad, i honestly
Do you really think trumps gonna entertain the thought of giving this power up?
Also I will be genuinely shocked if the elections even happen
can't imagine why
strangely they don't like to bring that up as much
He was an american citizen, murdered by his own government.
that the government assasinated MLK
Especially when government officials use MLK as a way to tell protestors to be more like him
It's important to remember
Shit now just feels like a countdown to another 228 incident
Captalism is a system that promotes competition, while also being a system wherein it is impossible to win
aside from being a haven for pedohphiles and nazis
that's all 4chan has ever been
Captialism is not alt right, but it is a weapon of fascists.
which of course, is not fully correct as you can't delete how much people have hatred in their hearts
delete 4chan and south park from the world and you could make an argument the alt right would neverh ave existed
It's not an indicative of the community as a whole, but sadly the community is who gets the blame.
or fucking gamergate
like how mass effect fans thought that it was okay to hunt down PR people because they didnt like a ending
Sadly, videogames have a BAD reputation for very small communities being very loud, very organized, and very violent
Oh for certain
sadly, videogames have been a breeding ground for the alt right
america is one of the biggest countries in the goddamn world, and we try to govern it the same way we did back when it was just 13 and barely accounted for the landmass it has now
The american system of goverment is fundamentally broken
That's good at least
Beware of the cult of personality
Christ
I strongly believe that kindness, empathy, and compassion are the true corner stones of humanity.
People have empathy, people have compassion, and people need to know that there is more in this world then what the worthless $ means
I refuse to accept that I must sacrifice my time on this earth for the human race to realize not to be shitty to eachother
Fuck that
Which is why people are so protective of it.
people don't like hearing that money is fucking fake
There's still a shitload of people who need a shitload of things and a shitload of people who have to make a living providing those things
and despite the US governments best attempts at capitalizing on COVID for population control
Unfortunately they feed into eachother
An important distinction
State sponsored and approved murder
But captalism did make insulin unaffordable for many people in the US
Capitalism did not invent insulin
everyone else just loses
You don't win monopoly
To simplify things
Is the best fucking example of this
I say again
Tesla vs edison
It's a false narrative populated by capitalists
because you want to have more money then other people
you do it because of *greed*
or to better humanity
you don't become a captalist to become a good person
Nichola Tesla vs. Edison.
Those are made by scientists, by doctors, who are only limited by their funding, which is RESTRICTED by the instiutions the captalism backs up
Capitalistts do not make those innovations
Yup
This is why the panama papers were a *problem* for so many rich fucks
The people who benefit the *most* from captialism, are the ones who exploit it the most, and then leave
Also hella yesh costa rica
Putting your health first is always important
don't think for a moment that pigs don't love the idea of getting to replicate the white terror
There's also the notion of loss of indentity to the military, (Cloud) themes about life,Aerith) death, Sephiroth) loss of national identity (Yuffie, and Wutai), the death of the space race (Cid)
FF7 is a dense game, it's more than just about one thing and the like. There's LOTS that it's about, the enviormental stuff is just one aspect
*nothing* in Call of Duty, Battlefield, or any movie is not  made without express approval from the US military
It's important to note, that in America at least, you are not permitted to make things about the military without the military's approval of everything you make
While other games, like Final Fantasy 7, are widely considered to be one of the most important, influential, and beloved games ever. And it is unabashedly political. That games FIRST LEVEL sees you commiting acts of grand terrorism against an uber powerful fascists mega corporation that is so evil it is literally turning peoples souls into fuel for your car
Case in point, Call of Duty. An entire franchise dedicated t oconvince kids how awesome it is to die in the military, yet those games never get brought up as"political" for some reason
In addition, that argument is only ever applied to games whom political messages people agree with
People who make those arguments are using it to suggest that that the *LIBERAL MEDIA* is trying to destroy *WESTERN VALUE* and putting politics into games where they don't belong
whether or not pong is political is a strawman argument if I ever heard onee
Hell, they just remade one of the important and beloved videogames of all time, which is also one of the most political games ever made as well
people who think videogames arent political are morons
Detention is a game about the White Terror of Taiwan, and that game is amazing.
Thing is, lots of games are political, on a helluva lot of sides
i have no idea what roblox is
about aerith
damn near always have been
Point is, videogames are political
That's....a take lol, but we are drifting away.

Nice gesture
US politics has not been about representation of it's constituates since the Reaganomic rollbacks and it shows. The US is on a collison course to destroy the idea of american exceptionalim at a breakneck pace, and while it's long over do, it's a damn shame at how many people are being murdered over it
The more important votes often happen in the Senate, House and Congress. Mitch McConnel has been far more dangerous than Trump and he's been in power for far longer. Thankfully the trend of people only caring about the president is changing. Sanders is decent, but he's a free pass for soft ball libs to give themselves an Obama shapped pat on the back of a job well done so they can go back to the "normal" politics. Biden is a blue Mitt Romney, the best thing you can say about him is no one on the right are going to be radilcalized by him being elected like they would a woman or a jewish guy.
Win or lose, November will be ugly
Take the time prepare now for the fact that nothing short of him being physically thrown off property will make him give up the power he has
There could not be a single vote cast for Trump across the entire United States and he will still not coceed the election
It's been about 12 year since I was on mine, and that was the only time I felt like i was remotely functional
in addition, any and all talks about vaccines in relation to how it effects america is absolutely irrelevant given our healthcare system
change is always possible, especially in light of the current events, the issue is that substantial change is incredibly difficult, actively worked against, and we are operating in a country willing to murder it's citizens before the virus even showed up
Never trust any buisness, ever. Especially if you live in America
and most states have "at will" firing policies, where they don't need to give you a reason
as it stands, while it is definitely illegal, do not expect your buisness to operate inside the realms of the law
brain anurism apparently
this one hurts

Gwen lives here in the states cypher, and our first wave of COVID outbreak has not really stopped. So the government is forcing schools to reopen, regardless of the danger
that bizzare moment when trump hates chinese people so much he accidentally kills microtransactions
Well Trump just signed an exec order that forbids transactions with tencent. For those of you who play gams with a lot of microtranstions, this means you
could be your gums are bleedin
I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to say?
Someone asking in regards to it to get a good understanding on if its a bad thing to use is hardly a bad thing imo
Trap is a word that makes it really, realy, really, really hard to engage online with people about anime
Trans people like anime too
you'd think it would be easy enough for people to not use a term when you tell them it's something that is harmful to others.
""banning the use of the word is worse than the word itself!" no it's not, learn empathy you failure of a fucking human being
and don't you fucking dare challenge some fuckhole on the internet who's parents failed to raise them on the idea that that which they have to say is inherantly without value.
if there is one thing that the idiocy of american exceptionalism has done to infect the entire course of the internet like a fucking cancer its that convincing a scourge of morons that their ability to express themselves has inherant value.
if you're not a thousand percent accomodating and forthcoming regarding anything and everything to help these piss babies march their way towards something resembling emotional maturity than you are "MAKING IT AWFULLY HARD TO SUPPORT YOU"
because its expected of them
the issue is that we live in an idividualistic society where personal convienence and a lack of empathy are considered the same thing as personal liberties
it *is* that simple
your mom could tell what it would do
and if parker and stone had been abortions the world would be a better place
the show is an abortion to good taste
its never been funny, its been offensive
not that they'd even bother touching trump because parker and stone are massive fucking cowards
how the hell can cartman making nazi jokes be considered satirical when trump is in the white house?
including parker and stone
something which its legions of dipshit fans fail to internalize
now it is just culture
it was for the longest time counter culture
genuinely an irredemable show
south park made the world worse
as i said
and that shit came out when *I* was in highschool a decade ago
shit that i still hear horror stories about from highschoolers today
And then of course you have south park with Mrs Garrison
It's also still surreal to think about given that episode came out a fuck ton before trans issues became something that was no longer ignorable
the biggest issue is the casting.
it helps they had people beat tthe shit out of mac all over philly for trying to get out of it
Its not perfect
And they are shown to be outliers, not the rule
When they do, its squarely at themselves as a result of the consequences of their actions
and they rarely resort to punching down
And also it helps that ASiP, the gang are always thee ones who suffer the most
"haha! gosh! there really is no difference between george bush and john kerry! especially for us very relatable independently wealthy white stoner dudes from california"
As opposed to south park which is just a glorification and normalization of things they find funny
Even the most "likeable" one in charlie (Due by and large to Day's natural chemistry) is still a stalker, plausible rapist, who engages in assault, battery, on purely trivial reasons
and the ASiP creators have gone out of their way to create the most hateable people ever
They are karmic pinata's
The gang never succeed, or really grow as people, and get objectively worse as time goes on
the audience is the straight man to play off of their horrible actions and watch them be punished
Mostly because, in sunny the MC's are the main antagonists in their own life stories
Its always sunny and south park are not really comparable
From the making white surpremacy cool and antisemitism into a goal, to far too many people seeing cartman as someone to aspire to be, the impact south park had on the dawn of the internet and its subculture cannot be understated
mhmm
but the south park creators genuinely made the world a worse place
i mean libertarians are by and large just dipshits
god I wish the people who made south park never existed
And south park is a huge part in commodifying "offensive" withfunny and cool, and while a large bit of that can also be laid on the simpsons and 90s shit counter culture in general, but you cannot discuss 90s culture without south park. it is impossible/dishonest
I grew up during the bush era and you could rarely go a month without him making an apperance. Obama was talked about constantly
Genuinely, they are two wretched human beings
on more things than they don't
They agree with him
Again, how can they satirize it, when trump just says what cartman does
Yup.
You say you don't want resources to given out on a matter of race? Okay. I understand that mindset. However, what do you have to say about the centuries and centuries and centuries of systems have made it so that specific races typically are those who are poor and socially in need?
Here's some free education for you buddy
I don't think you know the meaning of either of those words
Equality is a uttopian ideal that is impossible to acheive
cultural marxism
get outta here with this nazi sympathizer shit
ORLY
out here speaking Nazi shit
holy fucking SHIT
this motherfucker holy shit
quick quick! Quote MLK next!
I know all the words!
I love this song
Here we go
But you are speaking from incredible privledge
Sincerely, I am happy that such a system exists to benefit those people.
Unless you got dragon balls to make a wish of undoing the THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF RACISM AND FASCISIM and how capitalism and the like has crippled the world and remove all institutional biases, identities and by extension rewriting the entire history of the human fucking race, you might as well be talking about pixie dust right now
Where are you from?
the basis of your conversation is informed of a significant degree of ignorance of very complicated situations
Why is it a competition?
HA
HA
You can wax on and wax off about diversity quotas and about how white people are the real oppressed people and im gonna laugh my ass off at you till the day i die
Free speech is the right to speak. It is not the right to be Heard.
which we're not in
Yeah that's real easy to say in a utopia
Don't feel sorry for me. I'm not fishing for sympathy, I'm trying to show you that you sound like my parents and thats a *bad thing*
Tamamo, I am going to speak to you directly. Because you genuinely seem to be wanting to do good, but are SEVERELY misguided. I grew up in the ku klux klan. My family are proud members of them. Your speaking points, are their speaking points. Masked. disguised, and made socially acceptable by language. You really need to look into the foundations of that which you are talking about if you are going to talk about it. Because what you are saying, is not what I  think you *want* to be saying. I could be wrong, I hope I'm not.
Nazi bastard
they told it shitloads of times
they love that joke
tell it to the french revolution
tell it again
good joke
You think the rich are gonna take that lying down?
OH IS THAT SO
Because your argument is so weak you might as well be standing on clouds
I'm just curious as to how your little utopian ass belief is gonna work out
So should we give the Nazis a helping hand in the restructuring? Or just give them the same equal benefits? Or should we instead give them an equal footing as the jews they wanna kill?
And Nazis are also very common especially in america, in enviorments where they are poor and socially in need
because nazis are predominantly white.
You see I am glad you bring that up
A small minority you say?
Nazis think that equality means spreading the bullets equally among the queers and the jews!
What now!
and they disagree!
Nazis are among the people!
guess what!
wel lhey!
BY THE PEOPLE
By the people!
Shenron? Kyuubey? Cosmo and Wanda?
Whom is going to restructure the systems to benefit all?
by whom?
They must be resttructured?
Oh? Is that so?
You seem to be intentionally attempting to dilute and move the point.
Screen capping it all for the mods when they wake up.
By all means keep talking.
What a countryman you are!
And here you are supporting their views!
Naziism is not region locked.
Sure buddy, drop a link that dosn't address your inherantly predatory nature at all!
As a side note, if you want to push yourself as being "definitely not a nazi" try not to call the people you are arguing with "radicalized leftists". Dead give away <:bruh:702323883956764736>
Worst case scenario, you know exactly what you are doing.
Best case scenario you are a dangerously ignorant and sheltered Nazi sympathizer.
No twisting needed. I'm just literate on this sort of bullshit.
You can try to have the last word on it buddy, but you're transparant as a cloud
Nazism is not dead.
I'm not sure where you get your education from, but it is clearly not enough. You spout right wing talking points, attempt to discredit those who speak out against sexual abuse they suffered, and try to but actually! about racism while having either an aggresive lack of understanding about the underlying issues at hand, or you are intentionally softening your own more toxic and radical viewpoints so that they are more digestable and acceptable. A common tactic amongst the right wing base to attract those whom are struggeling mentally into a sense of welcomng. This is tactic popularized and perfected many times over, wiith some of your points coming across like a bingo card.

Your attempts to make Hibiki seem like a friend to all Nazis is a childish oversimplification of a very complex issue. Hibiki isn't real. But the millions and millions of jews killed by the Nazis whom you say need empathy and love were, and they are dead. Your feeble offerings to moderate your language so that your right wing coded messages are more subtle is very much noted and I want you to know that I will personally call out Nazi shit every second of every day of every month of every year. 

I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt, but this right wing manifesto you have disguised as an appeal to empathy is *sickening* to behold and is incredibly unwelcome in this sphere. You are either dangerously ignorant, or insidiously hateful. I'd like to think that people like yourself can learn the error of their ways and unlearn the hate they hold so dear. However, this is a discord server for a magical girl series. Not an alt right redemption center. And you don't even want to unlearn your hateful language, you just wanna disguise it better. I see right through you.
So, I am not exactly of the opinion that rapists are in danger of being punished.
The president of the united states of america is a rapist.
I have no words
https://www.axios.com/global-metoo-movement-convictions-charges-382ff226-7ad3-4b26-ac89-451788192578.html
HEre is what the metoo movement accomplished
OF those DASTARDLY! and horrible false accusations.
Oh by the way!
Makes it easy to shift the point.
They like to do that.
You are why rape survivors don't come forward.
You are not the one who decides what cases are real or not.
thing yo uare saying
fucking
Because of every
And people like you, Tamamo, are why rape victims don't come forward
22 million isn't less than 1% of 300 million.
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-neo-nazi-support-american-public-charlottesville-white-supremacists-kkk-far-right-poll-a7907091.html
It is not a fringe ideaology. Rape victims do not need a magical number of witnessses for their crimes to have merit. JEsus fucking christ
You need to stop.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e3T3VHmEkg here's some right wingers supporting naziism openly, at public speaking events, and on youtube
I'm sorry are you insane?
Fair, Lanky
Then your genuine beliefs are shared by nazis
Be it cultural marxism, racism agaisnt white people, and denying rape survivors.
No one would have called you a Nazi if you didn't keep on bringing up Nazi talking points.
I'm tapping out. I can only entertain this shit for so long. And I am not of the opinion that this channel should be used to give this guy a platform to spout right wing ideology, and deny rape victims their agency.
It's a common right wing tactic to overload with information and talking points.
KNEW IT!
KNMEW IT!
WOW
Jesus CHRIST
HA!
And nobody in their right mind would go to you for support if they were assaulted
You're not batman
You're standing on clouds and your heads so far up your ass you don't even know your falling yet
Your idealism is bankrupt.
Proudly taking the stance of protecting rapists
Rape apologist
My rapist wasn't punished. Most rapists arent punished. And its because like *you* that they are not.
Sub I would request if you have issue with me to either contact me directly, rather than when you believe I am no longer here. Unless you truly think the mod team do incapable of handling a conversation I personally made them aware was happeming.

Tamano your forgiveness was not asked for, nor is wanted. You have a lot of viewpoints that I can only hope are born from ignorance and not hate. I only hope you are using this conversation as a learning tool on how to better yourself as a person and the way you conduct with others. I hope you are not using this experience to learn how to better disguise your rhetoric as is so often the case. I have nothing more to say
I did.
05 actually, but took a hiatus before going back

Haz makes a good point. Your physical is directly tied to your mental health. That bullshit slogan "You're not you when you're hungry" is real. Check your blood sugar. Feeling like shit for no reason? How hydrated are you? When was the last time you ate something? Did you get a lot of sleep the night prior? These three things are *huge* factors to your mental health. Sometimes its a good idea to just grab a water, eat something and take a fucking nap.
It depends on how much you prioritize things like sex and dependency
Nor does it being in person
You will
You might not think you will
You will find things your parnet does annoying
It's why I said relationships take work.
very common, and often commented upon
incredibly well documented
it sure is
but because its familiar to the point of irrationally annoying
you'll fucking hate every single thing they do. Not because of anything they are doing *wrong*
Spend enough time around someone
It's also innevitable
Till you get sick of em
Sure.
You can blame a computer all you want but the fact of the matter is the reason a relationship fails is because the people involved in it wern't willing to put in enough effort to try and save it, or it was actually a bad thing to have to begin with
they find someone who makes them feel good and realize too late its not gonna work out
They get trapped in relationships
People lie
don't believe me ask any divorce lawyer in the history of forever
nor does being in person
they take effort
they take time
they take work
romance, friendships, all of it
even when they're not
relationships are hard
and herer's the real goddamn fact of the matter of the situation
I have, both online and irl
That's just false pal
they'll tell you what you wanna hear
people lie in relationships
fact of the matter is
Relationship being in person is not better simply because it is in person.
False equivalance
A lot of people aren't willing to put in effort
It's just a matter of how much you care about someone, and how much you are willing to give in a relationship.
this goes beyond romance as well
People who can't have successful online relationships can't have succesful in person relationships
Hard disagree at that
Solo got's it right. There's no universal thing in relationships. Not even caring enough about the other. its damn straight possible to *care too much* and make the other feel like they are suffocating
it ruins relationships so badly.
It's horrible
Some think it's better to do it face to face
Some people find having those conversations online much easier
Some people can handle the difficult conversations. Some can't.
and online it can make leaving people on read feel like the reason your relationship is gonna fail
irl, this can really hurt someones feelings and make your home feel claustorphobic
Some people can just not handle being told "I don't have social interaction in me right now, I'm sorry."
And then people get divorced because they do just that lol
And people do
Or certainly
Talk to people on your terms, when you wantt, how you want
Online? Thats a piece of cake thats what that invisible button is made for
because nothing sucks more than *having* to hang out with someone you live with, who you really don't want too, but don't wanna hurt their feelings in telling them as such
That performative art any and all person who work in retail is a great showcase in just how dishonest a irl physical relationship can be
Case in point, working in retail
a good portion of irl relationships are also incredibly performative.
but god does it suck when you just can't get away from a person
now maybe this is just me speaking out of my massively independent ass
Again, I'm gonna hard disagree on that.
like I said before, there's aspects from both that have benefits the other one does not grant. For some, those are deal breakers, and I absolutely get that.
In my general experience, people who aren't willing to put in an effort to make an online relationship work also aren't' gonna find a lot of success having a relationship irl
Some people don't want to put the effort into a relationship that is online
Now a preference, I understand that completely. Relationships online can *fucking suck* sometimes
Declarative statements will create that
Not defensive, simply a disagreement
But a relationship online or physical will faill the same way everytime. The people involved wern't willing or able to save it.
There are aspects of online and physical relationships that are amazing and are incredible and so important for all involved. Some of which cannot be duplicated by the other.
Other people's relationships are not yours to worry about unless someones welfare's involved
I would advise you to not be as insecure.
you don't have to be a therapist to see how that is a recipe for disaster
well
but the idea that they are inherantly surperior, because they are simply physical interactions
I'm not arguing against the merits of physical interaction
If you're in an online relationship, you are definitely online more often then you're not outside of very specific circumstances
try again
everyones online
It's 2020
Try harder
online and off
All of which are easy to accomplish
Those are all very good things
its how a lot of women get gas lit into unhealthy relationships based solely on the fact that the guy they dating isnt hitting them
most people are not aware of how unheathily codependent they are in the relationships they form
even when they're not
Relationships are tough.
But for what it's worth I think there was quite a lot of merit in the discussion had
Declarative statements~ They'll get you every time lol
grandma on my moms side lived right next door to us too
I saw my grandparents just as much as my parents most days
I don't have first hand experience it myself with it, but I do have friends who's parents split in their lae 20s/early 30s and their entire world was rock
Yeah. the depends is a big thing. No universal things and the like
I don't think there's an age where its easy to deal with tbh
being in and out divorce court gives you a very firm perspective on relationships lol
I get you~
im long over it, but it's too dark to go into here lol
I'm pretty private about my private life, but don't worry. It was almost 15 years ago lol
lets put it that way lol
*not well*
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it was the best thing for them
my parents got divorced when I was in middle school, to say that they incompatible is an understatement
<:743979450063912972:747645772308152430>
Closer than you think, but farther than they want
I don't know y'all's circumstances enough to be able to offer specific advice (And discord server for anime is not a good place to seek it) but I can say that working at a job you don't hate, making enough to live off of it, and pursuing friendships and relationships and interests that are stimulating and fulfilling, and doing what you can to help out those less fortunate when/if you can is not a bad way to live.
That's not what I meant exactly
you're allowed to just chill
but you're allowed to do nothing
I know that's not exactly *helpful*
You don't have to know now
I'll tell you this right now
and if it does? probably good that door shut
very rarely will any scenario you find yourself in permanantly close off another door in life
you don't have to chose as much as you think you do
it will never not shock me that the hero of internet athiests is a guy who died for the catholics
what
preferbly a less catholic version
probably some qanon shit
the key words ot take away there is 72 hours
hes the guy who tells you he is a MAN with capslock on. Weaknesses like that are considered something worth mocking (And in the political world, often a deathnail).
his election is arguably just as important as trumps
Mitch McConnel is one of the most vile human beings on the planet
as if this hasnt been Mitch McConnels MO for his entire fucking career
And people are surprised
i see people say its faked and it just reminds me of what alan moore said of how desperate people are for there to be conspiracies
its not a good thing, but it is a thing
He is comfortably evil to people
Pence is a fucking devil, but he's the devil you know
If Bernie got elected some of his biggest supporters would have hated him by year 2, but he would have kept kicking the hornets nest at least.
Returning to normal, is also why Biden is a picture perfect candidate, because he comes from the section of democrats who think that Trump just sprung out of nowhere and shit
Case in point, Mitch McConnel. IF not for the Surpreme Court, his election would be far more important than Trumps
Pence dosnt go that route, and because of that, the messes he can make, can take a lot longer to clean up because of how many backdoors they go through
Not to mention, Trump is a bullhammer pointed by whoever is currently his favorite to forcibly lobby something through
and because of that, it will allow him to well, fly under the radar for a lot of shit
A Pence presidency is a "return to normal" its a "the way things used to be!"
The problem with Pence is he is a comfortable evil
Democrats are a lot of things
Because the Republican party is ruthless
Trump is able to do the things he can do
Yeah and that's the issue
And we don't elect presidents by popular vote.
It makes you a fucking asshole who no one likes
You know what it makes you to *everyone else* in the political landscape that is filled with nazis, rapists, greedy fucks, and lame duck idiots?
And it means jack fucking shit
Sanders being a life long trouble maker on both sides is his biggest claim to fame. Him being willing to put his constiguetes before political loyalty is a great representation of his character.
Thats a good thing for him optically, not a good thing for him politically.
Republicans can/will/and do, place their feet firmly on the ground, cross their arms and say "NO"
Republicans do not.
Sanders cares about his constiguetes
Fact of the matter is
People thought the same thing about Obama
History will be far kinder to Bernie for losing the election than they would be to him if he won it.
And while people wanna believe that rock star is Bernie, it's really not. And even if he did win, without a Senate, Congress and House on his side (most of which, even if they were blue, would not be) you'd just get a lot of his base falling out of favor with him like they did Obama
The left, lacks a cult of personality and/or rock star like Trump was to rile up the base and really everyone behind.
Mitch McConnel is an evil evil motherfucker
Lying, on top of political apathy towards elections governing the senate, house and congress amongst voters is also a large part to blame in Obama being a lame duck
Now we are here, and we have Biden trying the John McCain offense of Not Being Trump, and while four traumatizing years have whipped people up into a frenzy, the parties lack of leadership and splintering amongst neo liberals and leftists has made them hard to get shit done, despite getting quite a lot of shit done
Fast forward two years and Republicans finally have an answer to Obama with Trump grafting the farthest of the far right and neo convservatives. Obliterating basically everybody based on outrage reporting and nobody taking him seriously. The Democrats meanwhile, basically did what Republicans did in 2008 and 2012 and cannibalized themselves in the debates, and were a complete disorganized mess and had nothing ready to properly go against Trump because they really thought that he wouldn't be elected. Clinton was a representation of old guard democrats and tried to coast on her Being A Woman, but had neither the media coverage or charisma to carry it.
Republicans tried to find their identity in the 2012 election, but cannibalized themselves in the debates, eventually settling on Mitt Romney, basically because he was the last guy standing. But he was too center to appeal to even most mainstream republicans, and could never shake his blue state heritage or corporate image. But growing disastisfaction towards Obama's empty promises and unwillingness to go farther left basically set up the Democratic party with hubris.
Both parties went with Risky candidates, Obama coasting on Not Being George Bush, while also Being Black, while John McCain was basically Not George Bush, but had a lot of pent up illwill within his party due to how outspoken he was, and him being a false representation of the emerging far right in American politics in the shadow of 9/11
And how the election of Obama was seen as democrats having "beaten the boss"
It's not exactly hard to see the parralels of Trump, with Bush.
There's a reason the phrase "do nothing liberals" is such a common turn of phrase amongst American political commentary
I was trying to go with the simplest explanation lol
Leftists don't want to elect Joe Biden, but will against the alternative so thhey can work towards undoing a lot of the things that have led to where we are now
The simplest way of explaining it, is that liberals want to elect Joe Biden, so they can stop caring about politics
Completely ignoring the decades long issues that have come from the institutions and infrustracture that bred nightmares like Reagan, Bush and Trump.
The difference is essentially that the traditional democrat (IE the Clinton Democrat which is Center towards vaguely left), are operating the party on a "lets get back to normal" buisness platform
Yes and no.
https://twitter.com/matthewamiller/status/1312936187057893377 this is the difference between leftists and liberals
I'm not denying he's shit, but saying Dems don't have a foot in southern states is disengenious at best. I do agree with your points on New York and Cali, but that does not change my stance that improving local communities is something that should only be saved for swing and blue states
> But most of the time the Democrats aren't winning in Alabama
are we forgetting Doug Jones? The *current* democratic senator in Alabama, who took the seat from Jeff Sessions, who got his seat from a democrat?
Bernie Sanders
https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/28/us/politics/00sanders-aldermen-01/00sanders-aldermen-01-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale
Let me present to you a Mayor
Case in point
Mayors, Judges, and so forth have an indredible influence on those communities, and improving them is a core part of what makes a good candidate for elections. I'm not sure how you can advocate for a Unionist presidency, and undermine community outreach's importance
The people within those communities are gonna disagree with you that electing who decides how much funding their schools get don't matter, but I digress. Most people don't just *become* senators or congressman or president out of the blue. They start working with their actual communities into making them better. 

I don't even by and large agree with the model as I think local organizing and establishing mutual aid networks matters a helluva lot more, but this is America
Especially since politically the US has been behind the rest of the world by decades for a long ass time
is really really hard
Hence why I am saying that doing all these things
Undoing voter surpression locally, is incredibly important
most especially in the deep south in predominatenly black communities
This has been an ongoing instance of voter surpression all over the US
Local elections can effect what voting booths get put where
Which is why local elections and elections in the house senate and congress is so fuckin important
Easy to say, hard to do.
As long as said Unionist president can convince millions of americans living below the poverty line to put their jobs on the line to unionize and then most likely lose their jobs because ofi t
Sure
The most important part of that sentence is the last five words in it
Also Americans really hate jews
But it's not easy.
It's far from impossible.
and more ability to drown out all of your money, people and coverage
more coverage
more people
and they have more money
You can attack buisnesses all you want but they will attack back
The issue is that the concept of Unions, has had its imaged severaly destroyed thanks in part to a lot of complicated things but to simplify it capitalism.
Again, far from a bad starting point.
Not just Republicans, not just democrats, not just voters, *everybody*
The issue though is that with that mindset you are fighitng *everybody*
Far from a bad starting point, Americans love to make mythologies around presidents.
I'm talking about right now.
Ruthless is not one of them.
https://twitter.com/RoosterTeeth/status/1313972165935599625
Stupidity dosnt even begin to cover it
Imagine having so little problems in life that you think people jerking off to anime characters and pedophilia are the same thing.
So I don't fucking care if Biden got his kid a job. Not while a Nazi is in charge of the most powerful military ever
It's put out there to elect Trump
This isn't being put out into the open out of some rallying cry again nepotism
Perspective
I don't know why anybody would fucking care unless they lack so much perspective that they would have to be blind
I don't fucking care if Biden used being Biden to get his kid a job
I'll give a shit about how garbage of s human being Biden is day 1 of his preciidency and not a second before. Joe being a cunt is no secret
the government wants to impose safer regulations, but isnt willing to provide the financial support needed to do so. I am shocked
testosterone makes you insanely horny
testosterone lol
Are you taking T? Also hypersexuality is a thing
Congrat!
Thats so wonderful!
A lot of people just don't realize the long standing ramifications of just how horrible and awful Ronald Reagan truly was.
I was stupid enough to think Texas would really go blue
Course it might not end up mattering because it'll be a cold day in hell before Trump concedes, but it is what it is
Most of the uncounted votes are absentee ballotts and the like
because america is a bad place with bad people in it and there are more people proud of that then there arent
in addtion to *gestures at 2020*
Wisdom tooth pains have made me not very communicative
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
Thank you, but I did not leave?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Arguably more important than the president is Mitch McConnels election, which he won
yep
At least, in terms of how the continental america sees it
Hawaii isnt so much a state as it is a trophy in colonialisms honor
Same with Alaska
its not ours
Spoiler alert
Civil War, but only one side has a military
I don't think people really grasp just *how* bad it could get
and even if it didnt, it dosnt have much electoral value
Alaska will almost certainly go to Trump
Depending on what happens, this will probably be the time frame where most Americans realize that the military isnt there to protect them
I wish riots were the only thing I had to worry about
Trump gives Americans an excuse to stop lying about how xenophobic they are
People love to hate
Hate is powerful
Literally every single electoral vote could go to Biden and Trump would still kill every motherfucker on the planet before he gives up power
And this will be the platform trump uses to discredit a loss
But not the case for Trump
There is very much a high liklihood of a surge of Biden votes to come in via mail in ballots
is the GOP have been spending MONTHS discrediting them
and why they are so important
Regarding the mail in ballots
Its worth noting
I fully expected Trump to be fully in the lead
I'm surprised at how close it is
god ifi this ends up being like bush gore again
If you are debating on staying up or not to see, I'd advise going to bed. We likely won't know even tomorrow
as the deep south was all red for Obama
What do you mean by rustbelt?
they are the *enemy*
The democrats are not people with different political positions to those folk
the rust belt dosnt *care*
A false hope
They need 2 out of three to win
Basically its down to WI, PA, and MI
NC and GA will likely go to trump
Not quite
which Biden looks poised to snatch
He also won AZ last time
Trump did win WI Penn and MI last time
wiscounsin, michigan and penn are where its going to be fought the thickest
im buying into biden getting M2, AZ and NV, and trump getting GA and NC
Voter surpression has been huge there
Why do you think I moved herei n the first place? lol
This shit is why I moved to vermont
I think its a 4 hour gap between it and cali?
intimidating voters
right now
Not to mention the fact that there are several *hundred* armed militias who are
Hes been doing that for the entirety of his time in the public eye
I really do
I hope I'm wrong
you are quite optimistic
Put simply, depending on how things go Trump is gonna do harm to a helluva lot of people
A civil war is pretty inaccurate, as only one side has an active army
all year
The literal thousands of riots that have been going on in the US
Are you aware of like
Thats a take
Bernie pretty accurately accounts for what is going on
https://twitter.com/ppredictors/status/1323862826495168513?s=20
ah fuck it one second
The absentee ballots are counted day of in PA, WI, and MI, as a way for Trump to be able to discredit the results
Deliberately so.
Quite realistically too
Trump can very easily win this
Trump
He seems at one, but the situation is far less advantagous then it appears
You are also dramatically over simplifying very complicated political situation
Basically its a turn of phrase to mean "This would normally be an outstandingly unusual situation in another context, but given the context we are in, it's just another day of the week."
In 2020? Tuesday
Despite having died from it two weeks prior to the post
Herman Cain spoke on twitter about how COVID is not as deadly as people say it is
that tracks
Corret on both counts
trump wins
MI was red an hour ago
but its a very narrow lead
its good news
Dems are expected to take the House
In voting news not related to the presidency
the bigger the lead joe has, the harder it is to deny the win, both optically, and logistically
I want you to imagine every single american stereotype
for my international friends
Reasons why its taking long

Nevada won't be announcing anything until midday tomorrow
The service industry is a whole nother kettle of worms to deal with
Remove the barriers in place for those who have difficulty getting to the polls
Its not a holiday here rady
I've no interest in magical fixes or anything like that. I am interested in tangible, realistic solutions. Making election day a federal holiday and removing the barriers in place to vote are realistic goals that is doable on a state and federal level.
People should vote. They have the right too. I hope they vote from an educated viewpoint and are socially aware.
I don't even have to fucking think about what the better alternative is.
I mean shit
But between *that* problem, and the problems we face now with the current voting issues?
There is no denying that
Making voting a national holiday and having it be mandatory for individuals is something that poses a shit load of problems
Because for longer than I, or anyone else here have been alive, the GOP has been reinforcing systematic barriers to disenfranchised individuals to make it harder for them to vote.
And while I certainlly would love it if people I agreed with went out and voted in such numbers, that's regardless of my point.
Fact of the matter is Republicans turn out to vote. Always. Always. Always.
Do I think the average person is socially minded and educated? Not exactly. But I am not interested in talking erroneous hypothetical situations so I can claim some kind of intelectual surperiority or anything like that.
People should vote. Regardless of how beneficial it is to you or I personally.
Non voting got us Bush and Trump
It's called cult of personality for a reason
Biden is a fucking creepy asshole piece of shit
American exceptionalism is dying before the worlds very eyes and there are people who will Kill before they let that happen
It's America
It's not Trumps America
*This* is America
see the violence that the protest is being met with on a local, state, and federal level
Google literally any BLM protest that has gone on this year
They are byproducts and weapons to be used well
Neither does the military
The police in America do not serve the american people
Who have *campaigned* on this
Who *want* slavery back
There are people here
This is not a country that experiences shame
is an *understatement*
the worst version of that stereotype you are imagining?
I want you to know
of the gun trotting, tobacco chewing, racist, hateful motherfucker
I still don't know why fines are still a part of the conversation, given that I didn't bring it up and fines are just ways to punish poor people anyway so if anything it would just make the problems that are already present, present themselvs in a different way. As I said before, I am interested in tangible, realistic solutions. Centered around making election day a paid federal holiday for all citizens and removing the systematic barriers in place that is currently the backbone behind the GOP's stranglehold on the south.

Kanyes a fucking moron
I think its more likely he just loses them
still very possible
*Absolutely*
which is
atm, trump can only win if he wins every single state still available
"Well even if Pennsylvania did go to Trump, it would not have stopped biden from winning"
hence why the bigger margin that biden wins by, the better
I'm sorry you are dealing with all that shit I hope your mother does not have the virus. I must say I am confused by what you mean though, because Obama won the popular vote in 2012?
Put simply, if it were not for the electoral college, there never would have been a president george w bush or president donald trump. Like a lot of our laws in america, we still operate on outdated crap
Gore vs Bush was decided by 5 electoral college votes. IF not for the bullshit with florida, the world would have never had a second bush presidency
Google is yoru friend
Whoever wins the most of those electoral college votes wins the lections
Electoral college awards certain number of votes, to states
He needs every single state (except alaska) to win
Trump currently has 214
The most trump can get now, is 274
Biden currently has 264
You need 270 to win
It is still absolutely possible for trump to win
I don't think a draw is possible
The onyl way trump can win is if he wins all five states still available
For those of you don't know, Kuugen here is an alt right conspiracy theorist who backpedels hard when called out on their nazi crap. Do not bother engaging with them as they frequently only seek to promote alt right conspiracy theories
Oh my god are you doing your alt right conspiracy theory crap again?
Neo Nazis aren't worth debating. And thank you for the compliment! I don't know why your neo nazi crap is allowed here, but I will call you out every single time I see you speak your bullshit
Don't try to talk sense into them
They are an alt right conspiracy theorist who tries to normalize neo nazi talking points
Unions in american is incredibly complicated, because a lot of 20th century mythmaking made unions indescernable from organized crime and the magia. Thankfully in recent years that has come to change in perception and I honeslty think that COVID has made people a lot more interested in it, but its going to be a process in a half.
It was an incredibly eye opening experience
Oh then they busted out everything. Paid actors, very recently shot, huge musical score, with a big animated presentation and everything.
Yet when it got to a video talking about the stores relationships with Unioins?
I remember when I first started working at a grocery store, the virtual tutorials for the cash register was like, something out of a 1998 PS1 cutscene. Terrible graphics, unintuitive interphace, and completely out dated in all aspects to what was relevant. The training videos could not have been more unhelpful at teaching you how to do the job you were hired for.
Trump is very appealing because he also does as well
Republicans, and Republican voters have a massive persecution complex
Big difference
they *think* they do.
Trump voters don't really care about "establishment" or any of that crap
A lot of voters put off by Trumps Trumpness will find Pence perfectly acceptable to vote for
Pence is a very acceptable evil. And is a very powerful member of the republican party
Which is why Pence is so scary.
because a lot of powerful republicans want that office.
Best case scenario is that the Reppublicans will cannibalize themselves trying to find an identity beyond Not Trump
I don't disagree, but that will never pass
assuming he's not in jail
Honestly the most terrifying thing on my mind is Pence running in 2024. That would be a fucking problem
the only thing I found was something written in 2019, nothing to put stock in
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/12/23/president-trump-lashes-out-an-old-enemy-windmills/
Also, as for the windmill quote Solo, its actually worse
Source on this?
huh?
god Tulsi Gabbard ran this year too. What a waste of time
Harris would not be my first pick to succeed Biden. She wouldnt even be my tenth, and I don't think the party would be behind her
It'll depend. Both parties are at a very interesting point right now, in which they basically are at the crossroads of choosing whether or not to embrace the more extreame aspects of their respective sides. For the right, it means going full hog into fascism, and for the left, it just means catching up with the rest of the world
It also just depends on if she decides to run. shes not required too
god bloomberg spent over 900 million dollars on his fucking campaign. all the good that money could have gone to and he tried to run as if he even had a chance of standing against warren sanders or biden
Turner's pretty great, but she has a uphill battle to fight. Not helped by the fact that shes got a shithole as a base
what a sack of shit
he was such a forgetable candidate i forgot his name lol
thats who it was
bloomberg!
no for the presidential nomination
For the nomination this year
Dems only really had three viable candidates anyway. Her, Yang, Pete, that one rich guy and all the others were just names
its by and large widely discouraged, as incumbent presidents rarely lose
Franklin Pierce, was not renominated by his party (His policies as a democrat were so shit, that it basically invented the republican party)
Well over a century ago
I think it only happened once
It *is* possible for the incumbent not to get the party nomination for relection, but it is very rare.
Same way as always
Biden has already said he won't be seeking a second term I believe
which could very well bernie sander the rights vote, and have them fighting for an identity again like in 08 and 12.
He either runs as republican or tries to run independent
He could very well tank the republicans chance of taking the white house in 2024
assuming trump is not eaten alive by the hundreds of lawsuits headed his way.
which is more possible then id like, but requires a *lot* of shit to happen
assuming there isnt some sort of coup
the next four years will be interesting
he will likely hold rallies across america, prouly saying he intends to run for the office he never lost
thats a pretty good prediction honestly
I legit wonder if we are actually gonna see Trump being physically carried out of the white house
He acknowledged Bidens win for the first time, and then immediately tried to walk it back
Trump conceded
IE, COVID, and Trumps complete lack of response to it
I think this is ignoring a huge aspect of the 2020 election
Reaganomics being a platform of neoliberalism is one of the biggest failing of he democratic party of the last forty years and the fact that it is still a huge thing in both parties just showcases how much progres we have not made
You don't know that
You are *so* close to getting the point I am trying to make
These are not mutually exclusve. I don't know why you are so unwilling to acknoweldge Trumps white supremacist base, besides how convienent it is for your argument
You *are* aware that people can be utterly fucked by the government in regards to their labor and have legitmate complains about that and *also* be white supremacists right?
You cannot talk about how about how dems are failing labor and ignore reaganomics
You oversimplifying things and ignoring the points that counter your own are not good looks for your argument
A lot of the fucking over of labor in america has been at the hands of republcian lawmakers and the like. Lest we forget Reaganomics
we just call it different things
hell it *still is*
and recently
cause race *was* labor in america
I don't know where you live but you can't really divorce race and labour in america
You should continue to read on a lot of these things
You are well read on a lot of things.
Like I said before
In 2016, Trump got 62 mill to romneys 60 mil
And they did
I don't know why you are so unwilling to acknowledge the white surpremacy appeal of Trump.
2020 is also a little hard to call rn, because it still is being counted but Trump and Biden both got the most votes for any party ever
while Bush and Gore both only got 50 mill, but Gore did win the popular vote
Bush and Kerry got 62 mil and 59 mill respectively
McCain, only got 59 mil, for comparsion
Romney only  got 60,933,504 in 2012, but Obama  got 65,915,795
I think this election had the highest voter turnout ever
And that's not even all of them counted yet
Oh yeah
Obama got 69,498,516 in 2008 to Trumps 62,984,828 in 2016
Lots of things are possible when people can *Actually* vote
And I would not swear of Alabama. Georgia turned blue, and Texas came damn close
Obama won in those states for a lot of complicated reasons. Hostility towards the Republican party and George Bush in particular. McCain and Palin not being the hot ticket they wanted it to be, and oh yeah the fact that there are more Americans than just white people, and minorities and POC turned out in record numbers for Obama in a lot of those states. Hence why in a *lot* of those states voter supression has been *Rampant*
Teddy rosevelt i believe is the reason it got the name explicitely, but it's more about its emphatic image. White=power
That's not the "Gotcha!" you think it is
And for full context, this comes from someone who grew up in the rustbelt of America and who fled to Vermont to escape the violence Trump voters presented.

Racism and bigotry are built into the DNA of America. They are foundational blocks. They are inseperable, from the identity of being American. White superiority is so fetishized, so normalized, and so commonplace, that people legitmately have no idea just how much it is a factor of every aspect of American culture. We call it the fucking White House for fucks sakes. Trump presents himself as the prototypical subject of American Exceptionalism. He is better than others *because* he is american, he is telling you that *you* are better than others because *you* are american, and in america, and specifically in the parts of america that trump gets along with very well, *american* does not mean you were born in the continental united states

American means white.
And there's no easy way to say this, but I can tell you the simple fact of the matter is.
You are well informed and well read on a lot of things
I had a feeling but I didn't want to make a bold assumption.
Ahhh thats very telling.
?
Lank are you from America
Its also worth noting that if we voted by the popular vote, the words president trump would not exist
its not the reason they voted for him in mass.
is Trump being anti establishment a plus to a lot of his voters? yes.
Lank I'm sorry but your argument requires ignoring so many additional factors that are far more paramount than I think you realize
The type of person that is going to be "win" them over, isn't any kind of person I would wanna vote for. And while the "left" wing of the US is embarrasingly center until very recently, I don't think that they'd intentionally nominate someone like that. They might do it accidentally though because dems really are that fucking incompitent at the best of times
The fact that trump wanting to kill mexicans and muslims isn't a deal breaker for them
and you know how I know that?
lank I promise they find the fact that Trump wants to kill mexicans and muslims a lot more appealing than the fact that the billionaire buisnes mogel from new york is somehow "anti establishment"
Any threat to their power is considered "persecution" and infringing on their rights
but if you'd believe the way republicans frame it you'd think they are the most persecuted people in the damn world, despite holding the white house, congress and senate during trumps presidency
People taking Trump seriously this election is another huge difference between 2020 and 2016
Yeah
Detroit kind of plays by different rules to the rest of michigan
Detroit automotive industry is very complicated in ways im not familiar with, but from what I have heard, there is a lot of really complicated stuff going on with that.
Its a core aspect of the *culture* there
Coal is part of the rust belt (as far as ohio, pa and WV are concerned) identity
You have no fucking idea how much I wish you were right.
I really do
I wish you were right lank
my uncle once relayed a story about how they almost made another Centralia because someone smoked in the wrong part of the mine
also all these jobs theoretically being created would require convincing the companies that are providing the stuff to be built to be okay paying for people to do things they can have machines do more effeciently. Good luck with that.
> I'm in PA and you would not believe the absurd lengths a lot of rural people go to do defend coal and demonize literally every form of renewable or sustainable energy.
I grew up in south eastern ohio and went to school in WV. My uncles would regulurly brag about how the horrible conditions they worked in the mines in
And Morgantown is the bluest part of WV
I went to school at West Virginia University. the student body tried *so* hard to get greener shit there
Also,  green reindustrilization will be *laughed off* in a lot of these areas. People have *pride* from how horrible coal mining conditions are
electric cars are driven by sissies and pussies and words that are banned in this server
lank im sorry but in red states
People legit think there is a "War on christmas" and other such shit
Hence why I mentioned the persecution complex earlier
When it should make them wonder why they are being compared to Nazi's
This is what I mean by saying that white surpremacy is baked into our culture
I agree its not useful, but I am interested in how you mean in this context
You cannot examine Trumps appeal without acknolwedging how huge white surprmeacy is a part of it. You can try to see the best in Nazi's all you want, but sometimes it just ain't that deep in regards to a lot of these rural states. Now amongst the richer upper class who are friends with biden and trump? Certainly. But you can't ignore white supremacy just because you are trying to find an alternative to the worst in people
This is what I was saying before
I won't argue that.
they *should* be doing better
And getting hammered in congress is an interesting way of saying holding the house and being in deadlock for the senate
You sure are willing to play devils advocate for voters who don't think Nazi policy is a turn off
But burning them in an election with the biggest voter turn out with over five million more popular vote and almost a hundred difference in electoral vote is certainly a take
Dems playing politics with COVId is horseshit a stain on all their careers.
Is it a contest to you?
Those are just the numbers, from five states. Out of 50
"Not moving the needle."
35, 505 of those cases? Died.
"not moving the needle"
Or in your words
1,544,000 that is how many covid cases were reported from Wiscounsin, pennsylvania, arizona, georgia and michigan.
I never thought the take "COVID didn't impact the election" would be something I hear, but here we are.
god how much I would love for a dem to just take trump or pence or McConnell for being how much of a shitty human being they were
Thats just a fucking absurd thing to say
that I agree with you on 1000%
Now you see lank
Dean was so ahead of the curve on so much shit
He could have legit prevented another four years of Bush
I cannot overstate just how much the media KILLED dean for this gaff
Funnily enough.  Howard Dean would later reform how people focus on states in elections, with what is now called the 50 state stratedgy, and is thought to be a big influence in how Obama ran his campaign
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0
The media fucking *killed* him
I wish I could say it was more, but really that was it
shouting rather loudly in excitment during a rally
of
and indefensible action
And he *pissed it away* by doing the unforgivable
Like the kind of momentum that makes you basically a superstar election like Obama
Famously had a huge lead in 04
former governor of VT
Ever hear of Howard Dean?
Even if they were just as poorly received
Booker and Beto at least had some momentum
Why she decided to run I will have no idea
did Harris even make it to the primaries?
His campaign was a joke and its funny to laugh at, but the guy got UBI into the national conversation so he was useful for something
Half of what he says is fuck stupid, and half of what he says is dead on
Yang is weird in which he is 50/50
And trying to "force" them to do it the way that benefits the workers, is *really* fucking hard
This is why I bring up Reagaonmics. Because of reagans deregulations is why companies are able to get away with this shit
Hence why I brought up how are you gonna convince companies who don't give a fuck about their workers to run a more ineffecient factory
basically gives you license to just do open season on anyone you find vaguely threatening
look up stand your ground laws

YOu are more likely to get shot in a classroom than attacked by a grizzly bear in America
guns are just far to baked into the DNA of american culture for people to care about gun violence enough.
governments wage war, people die in themm
and any war between the two would be apocalyptic
its an inherant part of american culture
America is a country founded in xenophobia, and thrives in it
IE, large parts of america don't see the "problems" that other countries have solved as problems
yeah you gotta understand that a big part of american identity is rooted in exceptionalism
that i agree with

they just want there to be less trans people
They don't care about trans kids
people need to learn to leave people the fuck  alone and just live their lives
its horseshit
fuck em
its out of *concern*
Its like how people will ship their kids off to gay conversion therapy camps
but its not
They might *think* it's concern
It's not concern
The thing is
Policies like what they are doingi n the UK, where they are making it harder for trans teens to transition is jusst a complete violation of a persons bodily independence
its their decision
Its their life
who gives a fucking shit if someone choses to detransition
Trust me
They will

It's important to understand the difference between fantasy and reality. Consuming large portions of a fantasy without questioning, reflection, and processing can often lead to very bad behaviors.
More extreame versions of the left and right more or less
I'd not be surprised if legitimate third parties end up coming up
Thank you Ardania
And for those who are not aware, before we start getting into areas of personal insults and the like to note that this is a conversation that one, Lectric is, iirc, still a child in highschool. And that if the only thing people have to contriubte to the conversation is getting personal, it might be best to let the conversation end here
Secession has been a topic on a lot of peoples minds.
and a lot of those people are more than happy to get pimped out to the military
the problem is, all the other militia groups who have been training for a civil war since the last one
Which is something that is very difficult with the military being what it is
I'd *love* to be wrong. But well the US is dumb
I'll be honest, I don't see the US abandoning capitalism, outside of situations involving a world war, a civil war, or the country splitting into multiple ones. There are far too many systems involved that are built to combat trying to change it, and socialism and communism are treated as what can best be called boogeyman for the better part of at least a century. It'd take a lot.
You have a lot of names in your username lol
Everything Kaiyo and BG are saying is super on point

And if the dem states did lose their rights then we'd basically have the econmoy fall out
Oh I agree Nuker, but I see it happening
Unions have been increasingly brutalized by the government in recent years, except for police unions, which are just a bunch of bastards
Yes
its also worth noting that the revolutionary war is still recent history
russia, france, and china are just laundry lists of examples of how and why revolutions can fail even when they succeed and vice versa
to be one country
the US is just too big
Right. And you kind of prove my point on why succesful revolution is difficult because we have a military that we putmore than half our budget into
financial math is by and large not a required subject for graduating most highschools. it wasn't in mine.

peolple forget how shit Mccain was because most of his republicans hated him, but hes still shit
there's also a lot more to it that is a lot more complciated than just that that is in the way of going it that smarter people than me know about, but that's one of the hurdles at the very least
republicans have been pretty opposed to it, because they have been passing laws for years now that have fucked over a lot of those territories, and those territories REALLY want to see themselves represented that is constantly voting on the laws that govern them. republicans are not exactly happy about the prospect of putting in two or more states that will almost certainly be lifetime blues
the keystone pipeline was a massive oil pipeline that violated a lot of treaties with the native american tribes that it would directly affect, causing a shitload of ecological damage.

thisi s what happens when you make medicine a buisness
There is almost nothing in Goblin Slayers first episode that is even remotely to what that show is about
A first episode is meant to introduce the show and ask the audience if they are wanting to like more
The scene itself is a lie
you're kinda missing the point
some of which will never be seen by a lot of people because they made a rape scene into porn
its a really fun show that mimicks DND adventures greatly and has lots of great characters
it'd be one thing if the show was a shitty berserk wannabe, but its not
and when you film rape like porn and try to justify it by call it shocking, it sucks
It's also terrible at showing the stakes and the actual appeal of the show. the goblins aren't super dangerous, they're nothing monsters that are so inconsiquential the jobs to kill them are considered demeaning to even slightly above average heroes
and the first episode of Goblin Slayer sucks
It dosnt stop it from sucking though
yeah. Its just a fun show about a bunch of friends helping their weird buddy get over some bad stuff, but the first episode makes the show seem like a berserk clone thats trying way too hard to be GOT and its just pointless. You can skip it and miss nothing
goblin slayer is one of the most baffeling examples. the show is actualyl really good but its blocked by this stupidly violent and dishonest first episode that is utterly pointless to the plot and a complete misrepresentation of the show. Its like they did it just for attention
Are you going to elaborate on that or what?
from all i hear the LN is the best version of the story
this is a really good piece ardania
i don't think even think the heroes suffer a single casualty, i'm not sure if any of them even got hurt
but even then, a literal army of them is still very easily put down by just a couple dozen heroes
the reasons priestesses gang gets got like they do is because they go in over their head and ignore the advice of those around them. Only priestess appears past that episode and to be honest the trauma they inflict on her in that scene is never really justified, or even made unique compared to all the other shit they go through
its why in adaptations of les mis, the 50 page scene of jean valjean crawling through sewers tunnels of shit is normally about a 30 second scene
it's why the word *adaptation* exists
yeah because there were *thousands* of them
To the point that most adventurers turn down goblin jobs just because they don't pay alot, and they're not even interesting to fight
they are little more than rats with spears
the thing is fenny goblins aren't dangerous
*yup*
unfortunately its stupid PR stunti s all the show is known for, not helped by the edgelord crowd waving the rape scene around like its a badge of honor and some shit and saying idiotic crap like "oh you think this is bad you kids should look up berserk" like good god this is the exact reason people find anime so alienating
and if you're into DND it's even better
its such a good show! its so fun and so charming in a lot of respects with a lot of great characters and action and set pieces and a fantastic soundtrack
goblin slayers rape scene feels like a PR stunt, and that being a deal breaker for as many people as it was is far from surprising. im glad the show is succesful cause its a fun show, but goddamn is it infuriating as hell in the ways it creates problems for itself that didnt exist before
you *can* have extreame sexual violence in a show in a graphic manner and it not be embarrasing and actually be portrayed in a manner in which it is, I don't want to say "fitting" but at least exists for reason other than getting people off or being outrageous
the first chapter of the manga is a straight up rape doujinn. you can look up those kind of doujins and find identical panneling to how they do the scene in the manga, and its the exact same way they do it in the show
its even worse in the manga
Not an entire sequence that features the girl face down ass up and fully on display
The rape scene in the LN, is iirc about two lines long
adaptation are there to adapt, and they did adapt
it's just a terrible first episode that is a reason why a lot of people never touched a show they would have otherwise liked
It'd be one thing if there was something in the episode itself, but nothing exists in it that is needed
and a completely disingenious representation of what the show is, which is *really fun and good* and a huge reason is that level of sexual violence is absent in all but, two scenes
and it introduces itself like what every edgelord thinks berserk is actually about, is a horrible first impression
goblins are pests in GS's world
because you are describing foundational beliefs of white surpremacy
I'm not talking about mosquitos and you know that
i don't know why "this race is inherantly evil and must purged" being a bad thing is so hard to grasp
it almost feels like you are intentionally missing the point
And a lot of the time a lot of the people making these things today don't do it with that intent in mind, its just a byproduct of the popular cultures conception of things like goblins and orcs and so on that people associate it with that without even thinking
this stuff dosnt just happen by accident
I mean if there wasnt literal centuries of history showcasing that fictional species were deliberately created to be characatures of race I'd agree but unfortunately, reality exists
Just a general question, do you know anything about Tolkein and the way he contructs his races or are you just swinging at whatever you can hit?
Races aren't evil just to be evil because WOTC realized, yeah that's actually really fucked and gives off a really bad impression
5e abandoned that concept like.....7 years ago
except DND dosnt do that anymore
Idk how to tell you this, but the goblins in goblin slayer are just one part of the worlds bigger threats. its why the show cuts back to three Main Characters looking girls fighting satan at the tower of doom while our protagonists fight the puddy patrol to help their buddy work through some repressed trauma
that's a take
goblin slayer if you can believe it
which is why a good DM would remove the stat penalties and let people create the character they want without feeling like they are being punished by the rule book for being creative
stat debuffs are terrifying to new players
that's exactly my point
you wanna punish a new player by forcing their orc wizard to take a -2 to int by all means but be ready to not have that player for very long
in addition to discouraging new players from going outside of their wheelbox
a good point to bring up, but not expliciltly relevant as we are discussing numbers that are relevant as all aspects of play. The type of penalties you are describing are the good kind.
only the monster races like goblins and full orcs
There's a reason half elves are the meme that they are
you know what you get when you have races that have negative stat bonuses? races that don't get played much
Different strokes for different folks, if you wanna punish your players for no good reason be my guest, but that's not what I'm about.
Because it sucks
The thing is, the rules in the source books are not codes of law, and are only there to be interperted and honestly I think any self respecting DM should remove penalty to races unless the player specifically requests it to be a thing
so you can see how applying phrenology to DND races is a bad thing then?
you should really look up phrenology if you are gonna be making statements like that
like the rona
not now cause Rona, but I've DM'd for about three years straight now.
this is my go to. I use a custom world for my game and have cultures and the like for every race and work with my players who are interested in playing such race to develop what is best suited for what they want to play
in my experience, most of the time when people are given the freedom to play monster races and such without the pointless stat penalty you in general get the more creative and fun characters that there can be
or to put it more simply, don't play your goblin like JK rowling would
the solution is try not to be racist when playing the race is my general go to for this kind of thing
at the same time, none of those races were made to demonize me, so I don't begruge people for taking more issue with them
I'm white as mayo but personally I don't think there's anything wrong with playing goblins, orcs, and such, as long as you're being mindful to not play into the racial stereotypes that inspired them.
We are simply discussing how a lot of fantasy races have been negatively impacted by wide range of hisotircally harmful stereotypes and the negative ways it impacts TTRPG's and such from both mechanical and roleplay levels.

Should nobody listen to music owned by warner media or UMC?
should activists not wear the face masks tencent provides at the height of a pandemic?
Trying to make arbitrary victories by "not supporting them" will only limit our resources to effectively effect real change
It's because the rich and the empowered in capitalist are the ones who are in control of what we eat, what we drink, and where we got our power from
There's a reason why the saying No ethical consumption under capitalism exists
That being said, the tencent issue is still an issue
I get what you mean. Genshin as Gacha are an incredible perception already, but waifus are gonna waifu.
well i don't play genshin so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
its just common sense
Not playing genshin, isn't activism
Those people are doing activism
Xu Xiaodong, who has had his fucking life ruined by standing up to the CCP on a national stage by putting himself into physical fights with the best martial artists in the country
People like Blitzchung, who got his career and way of living nuked because he called out the oppresive regime of the CCP, they are doing something
I'm saying not playing genshin and bragging about it as if your defunding the CCP is doing worse than nothing
I'm not saying *nothing* can be done
I don't play genshin because it funds the CCP, i don't play genshin because I have self respect
I'm not interested in arm chair activism or stroke my own ego because i don't play genshin
comparing myself to them cause "genshin funds CCP" is incredibly egocentric
There are people in Hong Kong, taiwan and mainland china who are actively getting dissapeared and worse for putting their asses on the line and daring to defy a government run by a crazy person
Am I supporting the CCP if I get surgery and its performed by something going under AIMIS?
to probably half of the equipment powering our computers to have this convversation
from providing complex AI for machines to do complex medical procedures
tencent is involved with fucking everything
I'm gonna be honest I am not narcistic enough to think that me playing or not playing genshin counts as activism
especially since tencent is apparently completely willing to do a hostile takeover of EA and activision blizzard
That's gonna be a position that will become increasingly hard to stay to with the way tencent is going
all good
honestly has a lot of eugenics programs, we just call them different things like "immigration control" and healthcare, but that's neither here nor there
the fact that the way disabled are treated in the US is not considered a form of eugenics is just a showcase of how terribly cowardly the world can be to providing actual critique to american government
That's not something I am comfortable stating as somebody who is only moderately disabled and know other people for whom things that are called QOL are a matter of life and death
and giving up a lot of comforts that we take for granted
i thought it sounded familiar
very well put.
I disagree with this personally and politically because no matter what the people who shouldnt be in charge are gona be in charge, and while it can be an effective tool to limit harm, represensativie democracy will never sit well with me
But I know a lot of the bigger activist groups have donations set up and the like to help them since so many of them get their credit anniliated
Obviously in times like this people are limited in what they can do due to public safety and unemployment
Ways that are? Supporting those like Xu Xiaodong and blitzzchungs and other activists
if anyone gets into activism to pat their own back, their not in activism. they are just stroking their egos
I am all for boycotting microtransactions but for far different, but still adjacently relevant circumstances
i cannot honestly say I am doing my part to not support the CCP by not playing a videogame when people like Xu Xiaodong goes through what hes going through
And honestly to this i disagree. it just reeks of arm chair activism. its doing nothing and saying youre doing something
If no, not worth bringing up
Can alternative mask sources support 7 billion people?
but *I* will live or die based on if I buy that mask
it might make me feel better inside to not buy products that make my activism easier, but the CCP isn't living or dying on whether I not I buy the masks tencent makes
I wish ACORN was the worst of it
god the way that unions have been just, turned into this devil concept in america is just so fucking depressing
when people speak the things that people wanna hear, soon everything that person says is what they wanna hear
its why so many political movements are influenced by cults of personality
Trump did the same thing, and tbh, so did Bernie
You just described cults
Thats absolutely the reason they do
which is just bullshit and nonsense but people buy into it because they think they can be elon musk as if their daddy owns his own conflict diamond mine
capitalism tells you you can get rich if you can put in enough elbow grease!
another problem of leftism, bad marketing
it might be a place you can learn about something from because leftist theory is heavily censored in a lot of traditional learning courses
Reddit is not a place I would advise anyone form their politics from
A good portion of people who hate "leftism" would actually be fully supportive of it, if they could fucking understand it
Most likely. It's a huge problem with leftist theory in principal
using deliberately obtuse language and phrases that most people whom are not well versed in leftist theory are gonna be a bit lost in trying to decipher
Its a quiz that reeks of gate keeping
oh and just to prove a point on what i saying earlier, but another company that tencent has its fingers in? Discord
Mine, i got quite a few problems with the way those questions were worded, but i also got 90s in left communism, anarcho communism and eco anarchism
Third parties take power, third parties will become corrupt
it means that shit can actually get done
this is why lower elections matter
Hardlly
https://twitter.com/briantylercohen/status/1356712940150296576 and this is why lower elections matter
and the prosecuter who refused to prosecute cosby
Take the victories where you can. Mobilize, organize, and work with people within your political parties and and its off shoots and don't throw up your hands and walk away from it just because your favorite candidate didn't get in. To take 2018 and 2020 as an example, its easy to say, "Oh people weren't voting for Biden, they were voting against Trump" as if that is not a very legitimate strategy, especially in the height of a pandemic. Because its not just trump on the ticket. People over the last four years did exactly what I'm talking about, getting organized, getting educated, and finding out who needed to be voted out of office, and by and large doing that.
Yeah, you'll find no group of people who so eagerly cannibalize themselves than leftists. the right saves so much money in political ads when we just kill each other as often as we do
Good point
but in general they are not welcome in most anarchist circles as they are seeking something far different and typically fall into extreamists groups like Qanon
There are idiots who just want pure anarchy
anarchisim is a pretty complex political ideology with a lot of branches and variants
I'll remember to appreciate the tories functionality when they gut the benefits of my disabeled girlfriend who can't work, great job Boris!
dependiing on who you talk to it already has
things are real easy to get done if you dissapear the people who disagree with you!
that dosnt mean what it gets done is good <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Like not being as bad as the US is not a compliment
I guess the US is the most full of bullshit and inaction if you ignore china, russia, the UK, cananda, the middle east and half of south america
Also worth noting, is that yeah, US corruption in politics is pretty rampant, it's also a bigger country than some entire continents
have you heard of the united kingdom
That's not compliment to Biden's its an inditment on the failure of the US political system
Republcians were in power and close to half a million people died in less than a year (We will never know the true number). If the above law gets passed on shit then biden will have done more in less than two weeks of taking office then Trump did at all.
I don't know how you be considered middle class and own two homes
Be glad it dosnt impact you directly then
And I'm much more willing to work a liberal dipshit like Biden to go even the littlest bit left of where he is now, as opposed to dems becoming complacent and getting their asses kicked like they did in 2010
But he's what we got right now, and we got four years to get something better, while the right works on something much worse
And he *should* be criticized for it
There is no shortage of shit to criticize him for.
Biden fucking sucks.
Let me be clear
I agree entirely.
Nobodys pretending Biden is the second coming of Lenin, (and anyone who does shouldn't be taken seriously), but I'm not gonna pretend he is no different than Trump, and those who suggest as such are also not worth taking seriously
>  The main thing I'm saying is pretty much that the left needs to continue to push Biden on issues
I'm glad you said what I already did four messages ago, because I agree.
like idk what to tell you man, but you should probably work on not sounding like this https://i.redd.it/whnuvoh4od031.jpg
Because as a disabled, chronically ill trans adult I know very much how much healthcare costs in the US. I'm not sure why you're sneering like that's some big gotcha, but by all means, take a bow.
That being said, the US is in theory, a representative democracy. Those whom are elected are meant to represent the needs of thoose they serve, not just the ones that vote for them. This involves pushing, shoving and brow beating said representatives into a position of supporting policies that the individual elected person might oppose, but is what serves the needs of those they represent
That's what I thought, I had a feeling you were boo hooing the policies of something that dosnt effect you directly but does effect whether or not people you're talking about this with can afford to work, rent, or you know live and all that
You live in Australia yes?
Trump and McConnel, not being in power is so impossible to overstate how important that is.
Nobody is pretending Biden is Bernie, (And bernie is far from perfect), that's hardly relevant. The US has not had a reliable relief plan for COVID for an entire *year* people are dying, either of COVID, because their homeless and freezing to death in the streets, or not being able to get to the hospital over nonCOVID related medical issues.
So unless you have a magic wand handy that can make the poltical system meant to govern over 300 million people bend to your whim, I suggest proposing actual solutions instead of shitting on the ones that are saving peoples lives
The 1.9 trillion relief bill includes but is not limited too,
Direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans, bringing the total relief to $2,000, including December’s $600 payments
Increasing the federal, per-week unemployment benefit to $400 and extending it through the end of September
Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour
Extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of September
$350 billion in state and local government aid
$170 billion for K-12 schools and institutions of higher education
$50 billion toward Covid-19 testing
$20 billion toward a national vaccine program in partnership with states, localities and tribes
Making the Child Tax Credit fully refundable for the year and increasing the credit to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for a child under age 6)

So to be honest i don't give a shit if wasn't a left wing victory, there's just more important things at stake than that
It is. and also people who tend to spend their time sneering and getting into cannibalistic frenzies over minor differences in political ideology aren't the ones who go out and get organized and effect meaningful change
a fact that Mitch prides himself on.
*nothing* would be able to get done if Mitch was senate majority leader still
make no mistake, trump losing was huge, but there is no person more important to take power from than Mitch McConnel
"Here's the simple version that I've dumbed down for you to understand" is not the slogan to unite the masses
And condescending
alright sure. let's take your ludacris trivilization and over simplification of complex living situations around the world accomodating for almost 8 billion people. Capital is exploiting labour. Groundbreaking deduction, whats your solution for it?
Just because they are not Jeff Bezos, you might as well be comparing them to Zeus
you cannot point at these and say "These are the same."
a mom on welfare worries about if she can justify buying herself a cup of coffee
Doctors worry about paying off their student loan debts, about securing their 401K's, and not getting sued for malpractice.
If you compare the living wages of a doctor, to somebody on welfare you're gonna be laughed at, because its a fucking dumb comparison divorced from any kind of reality
dude just say eat the rich like the rest of us
Like yes I am poor compared to Jeff Bezos, but so is more than 7 billion other people on the planet
Capital class, not only greatly distorts the disparity between the working class and the rich, but it also severely undermines the unique circumstances the working class suffer in
Yeah and we have a word for people who do, they're rich, they're wealthy, they're one percenters
There various different levels and situations that cannot be pidgeon holded into just one generic umbrella term
It's not just upper class, middle class, lower class
Your putting a single mother who has to work 3 jobs to support two kids, a disabled person who is forbidden from having more than a set amount of income each month, and a farmer who has to hire hands to work the fields, and a kid who is taking a part time job after highschool to save up for college and saying "All of these are the same."
I think your definition is simutaniously poorly defined and way to broad provide any type of meaningful socioeconomic commentary
who can't work
disabled people
and also you know
I think that's a bit of over simplification of very complex different levels of living standards
Yeah, well, boo hoo. Biden is getting a $15 minimum wage in, amongst a helluva lot other things that are far farther left then US politics have been my entire life. I'll take a Biden forced to compromise on policies Bernie introduces to the public sphere over the right wind holding the country hostage at the height of a fucking pandemic.  there are more important things then if something was a "left wing victory" or not.
I just wish I understood why you insist on strictly defining what leftism is and isn't amongst those who by and large, agree with you on most things, rather than discuss on how to best combat the right
"whats the left got itself in this century?"

"Left wing policies fundamentally worked from the 30s to the 70s!"

"you can believe what you want about the old messaging but its clear the new messaging isn't working!"

like come on
lank you gotta make up your mind man

Its impossiby sad and I wish things were different. I'm just trying to do whatever I can to help them out
https://www.rotruck-lobb.com/obituary/Haley-Rohr In late December of last year, a close friend of mine passed away very suddenly at the young age of 23. She had a lot of things in her life going against her, but despite this was an intensely creative spirit and fun person to be around. Be it final fantasy 14 or .hack or anything and everything in between, she loved sharing her passions for other people. Her family has been incredibly devastated by her loss, and is asking for help from anyone who has anything to spare. Her sister and my best friend has given me permission to post this, and if you can't spare anything, then I ask if you could share it in communities you know, but please don't feel obligated. Thank you.
https://twitter.com/japantimes/status/1360594740069203975 be safe friends
When it comes to this kind of stuff, document everything. Everything. Time you eat, times you don't. Records of weight loss, records of when she yelled at you, put her hands on you. anything. anything. Everything. I apologize if I am reiterating things that have already been said, or advice you have already heard. 

Does your household have a steady income and does your mom regulurly use cash? If not, credit cards can be pretty easy to scam if you take them out in her name if you can and feed yourself that way. These typpe of things can be hand waved off as scammers and can also be used as evidence of your mom being unable to secure her finances and be unfit to take care of you which she most certainly is.
Are they someone who could/would call CPS on her?
Is your other parent an option that is safe for you?
Do you know how she is getting her welfare? Is it just from the pandemic?
It's terrifying I know. But there are multiple ways to attack the situation, such as having your mother being declared unable to take care of you because of her disabilities and illness
I have no doubt. The CPS in the US is not much better.
Stellar I am not certain on all the details of your situation, but I want you to know that you have far more power than your mom wants you to realize. This is not permanant, and this is not something any human being should be going through. Your mother does not sound like someone fit to take care of herself, let alone a child. She does not have as much control over you as she wants you to think she does.
in ireland?
Does your mom have to submit to welfare checks?
Yes or no
Does it work?
Who fucking cares?
individual vaccines? what do you mean?
also dosnt help that at least in the US that we went almost an entire year without a response plan to the pandemic
or not putting them in place at all
and its not gonna be going away anytime soon
This is the new normal
Like I said, gonna be wearing a mask for years.
I will be wearing a mask for years beyond this, just because of how stupid people get about it
I trust the vaccine, I don't trust people to take it
finally some good news to wake up too
add in 9/11 more or less legalizing hate crimes and a military budget that takes up more than half of our countries entire budget and you get what we got
I mean yeah this is a big reason why the US is so behind the rest of the world on so many things. Especially since the right got a *lot* more radiclized a lot quicker then the left did. The reasons for this are varied and complicated, but a hot combination of cold war paranoia, nationalistic propaganda, reaganomics, and socialism and communism being heavily censored and taught to be the devil are just some of the very special ingredients to help make america the shithole it is today
i wish politics were as simple as you think they are
So unless you got a magic wand to give democrats to make all the impossible things you think are possible happen with an entire political party that champions itself on not working with democrats, I suggest you come back to reality because I get no satisfaction out of defending lameduck fucks like biden and obama
during which obama had to unfuck 8 straight years of bush
the mythical super majority you are talking about did in fact exist yes. for the 111th sector of congress, which went from january 09, to january 2011
or you know, *remember*
like this is modern political history dude this shit is not hard to google
and that the 112th, 113th, 114th sections of congress existed right
Lank you do know what a filibuster is right
you cannot say things like this without acknowleding Mitch McConnel and the actual political reality of the united states during Obamas first and second terms
COVID is very much as devastating to the US as Chernobyl was to the USSR, and I honestly think the results are going to be very similar (minus the radiation)
Biden is exactly what he is. A status quo restored. For some, Trump being gone has the same magic appeal of electing a black president. for others, they simply see it as succesfully getting somebody who is dying into a hospital
please don't have your points be so outside the realm of rational thought and serious political theory that i have to defend joe cunting biden of all people
"my legacy for the job I have saught after for 3 decades will be nothing!"
Joe Biden spent hundreds if not millions of dollars with the idea of
You nailed it
and private schools and the elite class are the ones who end up getting into the positions of writing and enforcing laws dictating who pays for what
this is a pointless argument to make. "He might not do anything" is pointless to say.
I guess for me, my argument would be that while universal blind forgivness may not improve education, it will improve peoples quality of life.
yeah. like I can read between the lines on it and such and know what you're trying to say, but that;s just because am very familiar with these talking points and theories in regards to education and societal reform.
And while I do agree that this here in inherantly a bad thing, lank you really gotta work on your phrasing when you also say things like this https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/336297840529899522/811894362871037952
I'm just staying on topic of the subject of education
Don't misunderstand my words. I am not saying "don't go into debt." I'm saying "you should not have too."
And that's *fucked*
The thing is, its all about one thing: Money. The various universities and colleges around the US do not want to lose out on the money they take from students, and lobby accordingly. The only reason for education to have cost, is because there is money to be made in it
I wish I had that problem.
Simple fact of the matter is you should not have to put yourself into debt to get an education
I get what you mean lank, but your wording on that is terrible
George W Bush went to Harvard
Well the bigger issues is also the oil and coal industry not exactly being in a hurry to let that shit happen and take away their blood money
think of it like this, at least it wasnt harry potter
and they have the appeal for the same reasons
they are harem anime in cosplay
isekais are plots with the most potential and the least utilized
of all the things in HP, thats what tripped you up
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
1: I am the wrong person to ask as I do not ever intend to get married, nor do my partners lol.

2. Correct. And while some might split hairs at the *strict* defintion of poly and the like, it is also possible for one person in the polyrelationship to be dating multiple people, and another person to not be. This is not cuckholdery, or cheating, provided that all those involved are in the know and consenting too it
Ask away~
For me personally, and I stress that, it's a simple matter of feelings for your partner. if your feelings are being respected, your boundaries honored, and your trust maintained, and that is mutual? Then you are doing right in a relationship. Be it with a friend, a lover, or multiple ones
older people generally have more money than teenagers
I also think basically anyone under the age of 23 is a kid <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Personally speaking, I don't know your life experience or anything like that
to me at least
yes
Honestly?
just because they are *legally* an adult, dosnt mean they actually are
Id agree, but someone who is 18 is still aa kid
Speaking for myself, I don't fuck around with basically anyone who is more than like, five years younger than I am
I don't understand it myself, but it is what it is.
Like, I have an old highschool friend who is like 26, dating a guy who is in his 60s. And by all accounts, including her brother who would kill this guy in a half, they are in a happy, healthy, relationship.
It depends?
It's unfortunate, but pedos, groomers, and other creeps lurk in queer and poly circles just as often as they do in the in monogomous and straight communities.
Just don't fuck kids or animals and you're basically golden
There's not one thats superior to the others, and those that are overtly judgemental on the quality of other relationships are almost universally a case of someone being secretly insecure regarding their own
for others its just fine to sit in your underwear eating pizza and watching godzilla movies
for some, they really want the big multithousand dollar wedding, the big ceremony, the white flowing dress and crisp tuxedo, two kids and white picket fence in a nice neighborhood
People change, people fall out of love, and the needs and wants of people vary wildly.
Including the two people who are start the relationship
No two people are the same
Yeah basically
what I can say is that I can personally never see myself being in a monogomous relationship again
Poly *generally* refers to people whom are dating more than one person at a time
Open relationship, *Generally* refers to people whom are dating who are fine with their partners sleeping with other people
this is why I said before that some people might split hairs on the strict definition of these things
and honestly a good deal of the time people aren't
Simply put, relationships are complex and require work, honesty and communication and two (or more!) people being willing to put in that effort
and then you have nutcases like the tiger guy and places like the church of god which are not poly relationships but just horrible shit
Common tropes are, stoner bro and his hipster girlfriend looking for another. Douchebag guys who tell their girl that they are into poly when really they jjust wanna have a reliable mommy figure while they sleep around, to more parasitic like people who groom and manipulate other people into being their partners out of a desperate need for attention and validation, without any consideration for their partners feelings.
At the same time, there are certain stereotypes about polyships that exist for a reason. And I know and am aware of just as many unhealthy poly invidivuals as I do healthy ones
I know friends who were in a monogomous relationship and quite happily so, but one of the involved developed feelings for another person, while not losing the feelings she had for her husband. They talked about it, talked with the third party, and the three of them have a happy and healthy relationship
Again, just being open and communicative is the thing to do
to use me and my girlfriend for example, when we both finally agreed to quit fucking around and start dating we entered it with a mutual understanding on a lot of things, one of those being that neither of us were interested in a monogomous relationship
But also, a lot of the time, people are fairly open and direct about their interests
Most of the time, its super situational
far from universal, personal experience talking here
Most people who are in the poly sphere that  I know are only interested in marriage for the benefits it provides
death of american exceptionalism is a helluva thing to witness in real time
its like in the 80s when everything that happenedi n 08 was fucking telegraphed by anyone worth paying attention too and no one bought into it and we still have not fucking recovered from it
i like the thought process that climate change is something that will just wait around for america to pay attention too eventually
he's a piece of fucking shit and all his fans are idiots who thought andrew ryan was the good guy in bioshock
elon musk is a chode
I rarely often find that there are people whom are yonger than 23 who are emotionally mature enough for me to bother consider dating.
its just mostly a matter of emotional maturity
23 is just my hard limit
i don't disagree with that
But by all means if you have questions on it just ask
But yeah, uhh as a rule you should definitely not trust the opinions of a neo nazi on anything
Definitely did not see the end of that sentence coming
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
all relationships are different.  trying to pidgeon hold one relationship into a specific format is how you end up with the divorce rate in america
But again, as long as you ain't fucking kids and animals, you're golden
It wildly varies and and is incredibly complex, depending on life experince, emotional maturity, and a helluva lot of other things
than anyone on this server has been alive
for longer
and have been
Man, ccan you imagine if we put resources into nuclear? a power soruce that if things went wrong could make the planet uninhabitable for humans? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Nuclear is and has been the direction we should have been going into for the past 50 fucking years
Both.
I don't think there is gonna be an after COVID
you know there was almost another explosion right
I think you should look into all the thing that were done to prevent Chernobyl from becoming worse
climate change is free af. it will kill plenty of people free of charge
There's a very big reason for that you know <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Okay, but you do know how radiation and wind work right
that indirectly caused the collapse of the USSR and the fall of Russias status as a major super power
also Chernobyl was almost an apocalypse
i think you need to look up the BP oil spill
meanwhile last week they poured thousands of gallons in the california coast and that shits so common its not even news this week
Three Mile Island was in 1979, chernobyl was in 86, and fukishima was in 2011. And yet somehow, it is more unsafe than oil and coal
we *still* don't have one
we went *a year* without a proper COVID response
And while no president was going to be able to handle the pandemic well
the term comically avoidable comes to mind
You can blame Cruz, the american electrical power infrastructure, abbot, and sooooo many other things, without running out of blame
Case in point Texas rn
as i said, there is no shortage of blame to go around
a girl falls in a well its a tragedy. forty thousand people+ die in your state its a statistic
personally? I think he deemed it an acceptable loss
Americans take pride in inconveincing others
also just a general difference in culture
but NY also had more deaths than the entire country of japan x 7
Cuomo is a fuckwad
and yet Japan
also being better than america is like getting fourth place in mario kart
There's no shortage of blame to help out
and that final is still due when its due, and its not gonna change and or get any easier
But allison gas is really good tho
give it enough time you won't have to picture it
what demand are you expecting that nuclear cannot handle
I joke but in all seriousness we are so fucked on climate change
can't come quick enough
do you think the air is going to go away. do you think the sun is
this is how i know we are fucked on climate change
the failure of the processs, the failure of the media, no accountability
its a little insane how this more or less predicts the entirety of the 2016 and 2020 elections

The situations in the middle east are very complicated, and I do not know enough about em to make a lot of statements in any kind of confidence but I do know that america acting as world police is not a thing that should keep happening as often as it does
1. That's an absurd suggestion
2. Not being as bad as the USA is not a selling point
prolonged withdrawal was the phrasing I was looking for.
But just given how much america fucked up the middle east and the like, we're helping ourselves more than the countries we're occupying in that region
Should clarify that I think it should be done in a way that does not make the bottom fall out in the respective areas instead of what the USA normally does
I honestly think that we need to work towards pulling out of the middle east entirely
politics, the quickest way to lose faith in humanity
an 18 yo dating a 17yo dosnt say anything in regards to a show or fandom or anything, thats called just two people being seniors in highschool
seperate fans and the show completely. you'll never find something worth merit beyond confirmation of your bias regarding things.
There's a universe of difference between an 18yo and 17yo dating and a 17yo and 21yo dating
Don't put much thought into it.

Hitlers a scary evil. He did so many evil things that are borderline impossible to comprehend and appreciate the magnitude of. To that end, people tend to go overboard in upscaling the villianous nature of who he is. Fact of the matter is the guy was very human, and just as capable as being multifasceted and intellegent and charismatic....while also being a meth addicted genocidal bastard who ran his military into the ground
hitler was like a raving meth addict, that fact that he was in charge as long as he was in testament to the smart people he surrounded himself with. Iirc, he stopped surrounding himself with smart people and replaced them with yes men which was a huge factor to him losing key victories in WW2

slippery slope that
good lord youtuber drama is stupid
good to know my baseless assumptions about what type of circles he runs in were *completely* correct
of course he is
oh god hes friends with sargo-why am i surprised
i didnt even think about the joker movie 11 hours after I watched it
it's all youtube drama stuff so not worth wasting brain cells on, but he has still not gotten over jenny nicholson having blocked him after he made an eleven hour long video bitching about her not liking the joker movie
That dude is legit terrifying
but Mauler is like. a special case all his own
it also got hit by a massive sandstorm as well which threw it off course
I never said they made sense lol
america has a time honored and valued traditions of legalizing hate crimes. the "trans panic defense" "stand your ground laws" among others are very common and some version of them exist in almost every state

look at the joe the plumber effect
It's us vs them rhetoric
granted, the people who shout that, if you asked them, would describe the difference between a socialist and communist as "ones european, the other is chinese"
hell yeah it is!
Leftism in america is not as big as people want to think it is. And people can pray and hope all they want that Bernie can have the same magic wand that Obama didn't have and make all the problems go away but it just ain't how that works. Fact of the matter is, career liberal democrats don't want large substantial change because a lot of them genuinely don't think it's needed. They think the "system works" it just needs the right people in charge
You're not off base entirely.
Which is not gonna be going away anytime soon
Its interesting in how the divides tend to be between the moderate right to the far right. and liberals and the far left.

at least in terms of american politics, the far right and the moderate right are while often times at odds with each other, frequently will side together on just about anything. Regardless of how fanatical or well, terrifying and morally abhorrant the far right is, they will accept them as a necesarry evil.

Liberalism and the far left meanwhile, will happily kill each other while forgetting the "moderates" on the other side are openly saying "yeah the nazi policies aren't so bad." and its not hard to see why as liberalism in america is generally people within the system trying to use the system to fix the system, which is like throwing dynamite to kill a spider. Leftists generally want to break down the entire system and work and replace it with another, but are by and large completely unwilling to work within that system to do so.

Bit of an oversimplification, but its a showcase of how american policy has not progressed at all in the better part of forty fucking years
And yet people think its the liberals we need to waste time doing useless infighting with  <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
and then the "left" of the Us political party began useless infighting for a decade plus while a fractured republican party began to captalize on the backlash racists had against Obama and 2016 rolls around and everyones like "HOW COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED?"
And then people ignore the house and the senate and congress because WHOO! racism over! we beat the final boss and elected a black pres!
He was well spoken, intellegent sounding, confident, black, charismatic. As opposed to the perceptions that dominated Bush's second term. Gone was the dumb sounding, dumb acting, insecure, white as wheat bread, and weird old man that had gotten us stuck in an endless war. Here was Obama! He's got *swag*
Obama was for a time, everyones favorrite politician
Everyone thinks their favorite politician will be different
its hard to even explain the way people looked at Obama. The guy might as well have been a fucking rock star
People really thought Obama had a magic wand that would just undo all of Bush's evil
of course it is heavily western skewed and has a long standing history of being, well, kind of shit and arbitrary
It's neither criticism or praise, its just a statement of how influential that individual person was to the broader international landscape

it's not my fault! its the fuckin "insert group here"
its easier
its why the right is so popular
If you want to pass the buck to the kids coming up don't be surprised that nothing changes
waiting for this shit to die out is just a way to give us an excuse to not fight the current problems
Kaitlin Bennet is 25
Ben Shapiro is 37
That's wishful thinking
Nah
It's accumulative
I would not say it's generational
Younger
its to assume that the generation coming up ahead of me know way more than I do
if growing up with gen x parents taught me anything
Generational myth making is by and large, hot garbage
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Are you 35?
we just don't fuckin learn
Nah
now that I do agree with
Revolutions against countries tend to be a lot harder when said country is the second largest military force in the entire world
I disagree.
It's a brutal farce, but one that is incoporated into the fabric of basically every single aspect of american society. We don't just think we are the greatest country on earth, we are *proud* to think that. Not proud that we are the greatest country on earth, but proud to *think* we are.
It's why the simple fact of the matter is, in regards to american politics. And the last four years have done nothing but make me certain of this fact, is that the only real substantial change that can come towards the government by and large is on the backbone of a revolutionary or civil war
We just call it patriotism now
Nationalism is alive and well
In my dreams
but popular
American exceptionalism is built on the idea that "our way is not only the right way, it is the superior way. Our way is the correct way, *regardless* of any other way presented, because it is the american way"
It's the inherant reality of american exceptionalism as the core political ideal that is so rooted into so many of the problems of American society
And if you *do*get the chance to read about it? its about how socialists and communists wanted to infringe upon american values
This shit is just not stuff you are given access to read about in school
Both by design, and also as a matter of pride
Americans understanding of other political ideologies is profoundly limited
and how that still to this day gets brought up with Obama
I hope you're right.
Now you sound like a liberal lol
generational divides are exactly that, tools of division
Then don't make the same mistake as boomers did and think that your generation is important
It's not on the younger generation to save the future that we failed too.
matt gaertz is 38 years old
Mitch McConnell has been part of the united states government for over fourty years
Youu can wait all you want for the "older less progressive" generation to die out and lose power but heres the facts. The people who have power, do anything they can to keep it
Honestly I think you are just seeing the results you want to see
this ain't new lol
the youngest people are always the most progressive lank
there's like less than ten people worth a shit and one of them is Greta Thunberg
looking over the time list is fucking hysterical
in 1969, Middle america was named time person of the year, and in 1982 they gave it to the fucking home computer lol
then called "the inheritors" <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
in 1966, baby boomers were the time person of the year
speaking of
cause people in the 60s can go on and on about sticking it to the man till they realize "oh wait being the Man is fucking awesome"
revolution stops being so appealing when you keep on making a shitload of money
yeah cause leftist waste all their time fighting each other over trivial differences <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
also reagan was elected in 1980 btw lol
who the fuck suggested they were

and this lets apple avoid the tumblr problem
but honestly, i think it has a matter of discord being pretty hard to regulate
Microsoft is buying discord afterall
No one is stopping the president from talking. He violated the terms of server aggrement of twitter and was punished accordingly
there are...SO many permissions
permissions to set roles? permissions to add colors to certain peoples names?
yup
Apple was made by steve jobs, they are not in the buisness of accepting blame lol
I think this is apples way of saving face more or less. Because discords getting to be as bad as tumblr was, and now apple can be like "hey its not happening on our devices! we don't let those kinda servers exist, blame discord"
tumblr was basically doomed once yahoo got a hold of it and became a glass cliff
to the point that tumblr got delisted from the app stores because the CP on it was that prolific and widespread
tumblr pre 2017 was a haven for pedophiles
at least we can count on microsoft to make it more user friendly <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it also depends on server size, how many mods there are, so on and so forth. ALLL of this could be made so much easier by discord but well

its just comical at this point
any and all discussion you'll turn it into leftist infighting
lol you never fail lank
I was able to reason voting for Joe Biden despite having major issues with both him as a president, his policies and the state of the democratic party. At the same time other people reasoned voting for trump because they think Hilary Clinton is gonna become immortal by drinking the blood of children. These two things are not the same, even if they both, to the eye of the beholder, come from a place of reason
but for as much as a lot of modern internet discourse goes on and on about the merits of "Debate!" and "just listen to reason!" its a matter of reason according to whom?
not a universal rule, nothing is
they just don't care about *your* reason, by and large
People *do* care about reason
the issue with reason is that people don't care about it

Just because you "don't see color" dosnt mean the people you are saying it too dont. And depending on who you say it too you cam have some ugly reactions
Why confront the issues when you can make a weak empty statement like I don't see race?
It's easy
It's why it is so appealing
Yup
ill be honest, im white as fuck. and i live in vermont, where the only black people around make nervous jokes about everyone living here are the family from Get Out.  im no expert on racism, nor do I experience it. but i do know for a fact we aint getting rid of it by ignoring it. that shit dosnt work for bullying, somethings tells me its not going to work on a country founded on genocide.

you gotta live a charmed ass life or have your head buried up your ass to not see the problem in not seeing race
its a pretty uselessly utopian ideal. its really easy and takes very little work to say "i don't see color" and all that shit. but thats incorrect. people do see color, and unless someone has a magic wand handy, you can't just say erase thousands upon thousands of years of opression based off of skin color and other such things. saying you don't see color is like a 13 year old saying "im not racist I hate everyone equally"

that area of the world has been western theater for a while now
from just about everything I have seen on the conflict, citizens in isreal and palestine are just exhausted of this conflict and just want peace, while Hammas and Netanyahu and his followers are more than willing to keep it going. (And theother powers in the world including iran, china, the US and russia aren't stepping in because of how much they are making off of the conflict). I just feel bad for the people who just want to live in peace.

you can tell a lot about a persons character based on how they talk about things that do not affect them personally
so far removed from the consequences of what happens, it might as well be
they talk about current events like speculative history
its easy for people to just point and callously discus things without any rhyme, consideration or empathy
the amount of ignorance and privledge this statement speaks is gobsmacking
And outsider influences, most especially the US, Russia, Iran and others have financial incentive for the conflict to be ungoing. war without end is financially lucrative, and that income is something they are not going to want to discontinue
im not as well read on this, but if i remember correctly hammas came to power partially on the back of them promoting undiplolamtic solutions compared to fatah
the british empire getting to more or less escape being the worlds leading super villian without charge or fowl and leaving the rest of the world to pick up the pieces of the cultures they shattered is one of the greatest crimes of the 20th century
palestine and isreal are stuck cleaning up the shit dumped on them left by the british empire and nazi germany, and most sympathetic foreign powers are too lost on how to help. while a lot of what is going on stems from things that centuries+ and even longer old, a lot of it is also modern history, of people climbing back from the brink of colonization, genocide, and war, and the people in charge of both areas are far too committed to their cause to give an inch while their civilians just want peace.
willing to bet cash money that a good portion of the people pretending to give a shit about palestine don't even know about the conflict between fatah and hamas. hell this channels been ripe with discussions about this conflict from people not involved and its been nary mentioned at all. just a fucked lose/lose situation between both sides, that are forced to be meat puppet theater to their criminal politicians and the spectators of the western world who didnt give a rats ass about this last week
its fun to pretend to care

Things like this are tough. But, in my own personal experience, I have found that people who act in similar behaviors to their brother are their own worst enemy. Sometimes, you can only warn somebody of the consequences of their actions so much, before just letting them happen without warning. If he is not putting in the effort towards bettering himself, then you should not either.

Don't offer him help, even when requested. Have conversations end abrupty and shortly. Treat him not with hostility or comfort, but apathy. He seems determined to test how far his behavior will let him go unpunished, show him the fruit of his labor. don't react, don't get worked up, don't engage with him about conversations you normally would. it can be cold and cruel, but sometimes the best wake up call is the possible reality that the actions he is doing can lead too
how old is he? jsut for sake of reference

david cage has always been a sack of shit
Tomboy is generally considered a personality trait or descriptor
and the reasons I remained homeless, *became* economical
but that shit isn't static
I say this, because I *have* been homeless. And I have been homeless for reasons that were not economical
I take it you speak from experience, having been homeless then?
that's horseshit.
its really easy to ignore homeless people when you have all this money to count
which most people have in some level
it's a fundamental failure of basic human empathy
course not
your reward is based off exploitation to be brutally honest
but human beings, 99% of which, *have* to live in a shelter
you don't just accidentally become one
you *chose* to be a landlord
Here's the thing though cypher
which makes it inherantly malicious and destructive
it's inherantly exploitive service with very little financial incentive behind it
fact of the matter is, most of the time for landlords, renting isnt the primary source of income
still raised rent during pandemic
My landlord is a pretty cool lady
plenty of landlords are shit tho
my landlord raised our rent in the midst of the pandemic
yup
By sources of income, do you mean rent?
its crazy how fast something gets done when there is money to be made from it
and realize how wrong you are
only that I hope beyond hope that you don't have to experience homlessness
I dunno what to tell you man
Dudes rich already, and owns six apartments he can't rent out in the middle of homless crisis, I wonder why that reason is? <:yayakahmmmmmmm:725404958052057138>
if your buddy can't rent out six apartment buildings during the middle of a homeless crisis in your country why the fuck should i feel sympathy for him?
It's really easy to ignore homeless people when you have all this money to count. And when push comes to shove, time and time again, people in those kind of positions will always chose to get more money, than to make less homeless people.
By going back to what I said before
I'll simplify it then
I'm losing the thread on the basis of your argument tbh
That artcile I linked was writtenless than 3 months ago
but if that was the case we also wouldn't have landlords to begin with, so we come full circle
You would think that, basic human decency would triumph over financial incentive
There's not a rush to make the system work because there is not an financial incentive to do it
I'm not exactly in the position of having sympathy for the failurs of a system, over the plight of people fleeing a warzone
Boo hoo
we've been doing it for the history of forever
immigration isn't some radical new concept
That's still a failure of the system
and that reason normally is "landlords are charging outrageous shit"
50K homeless people, and several million living in extreame poverty is not something to be proud of

I mean not for nothing but googling homeless and italy brings up this as the top reseult
In addition
I also work at a hotel. And during the pandemic, we housed people who lost their homes who were here as part of the government benefits. but those benefits have lessened, and while some of those people were able ot use the chance at having a stable place of home as a way to get back on their feet, others wernt.
and then it becomes a shooting gallery of idealogies
okay, good start, now what else?
"Not Trump!"
left and establishment being both broad enough that people can basically project whatever it is they don't like onto them, making it all the easier for right wing politicians to pander to them and acting as  "one of the people"
The right has pretty succesfully branded itself as its own form of counter culture, with the "left" as the establishment
yup.
and nobody loves to fight leftists more than other leftists
since the left is so split between so many different variations of itself, and the right is more than willing to embrace its more extreame variables, we're kind of stuck in a rut of republicans willing to do anything to win, and democrats eating themselves.
its honestly things like this that makes practicality important. its not just fighting a battle you can win, its fighting a battle you can't lose. 

the left and right in american politics is a world wind example of trying to fit square pegs into round holes kind of deal, and a binary political party system is why its often difficult to see a difference in certain candiates on opposite sides of the isle. a good portion of the left in american politics (from your clintons to sanders) is not so much unified under an idealogy, outside of really not wanting trump and his ilk to be in power, and even then that took grassroots organizers to get people behind onstuff. It's not exactly a bad short term strategy (trump used it to get elected against obama after all) but its not viable long term wise.
<:jaltergun:641787549676863498>
I've lived in five states, including three touching eachother, and the things each needed differ so radically they might as well be different ecosystems
this something also radically made more complicated by the fact that we have a two party system for a country the size of a continent
Republican idealogy is just simply put, more accessible
or if the guy with the R is say, actively involved in a sex trafficking scandal involving teenage girls
As the saying goes, perception is reality
you can project al lyou want as to what american values mean to you, and the guy with the R next to his name stands for it. he's your guy
the right just has to say it stands for american values. which is just as broad enough term as "liberal media" and "the establishment" and the "left"
which therein falls into the trappings of things like states rights, american exceptionalism, so on and so forth
its not an uncommon saying used to attack liberal idealogy in the US, because it's so often seen as trying to do too much
yeah. its an old saying that ye who stands for anything stands for nothing
no hes just directly contributing his considerable wealth to those who have the pwoer to strip away human rights

not helped by the age of tumblr and how much fandom has changed in the last decade
people just forget about the barrier between content creator and themselves
that's what i meant before about parasocial relationships
and I think that theres a lot of accuracy in that. people are very quick to take away their own agency in terms of how they have come along in their own recovery by giving undo praise onto something that had been adjacent to them at the time
and they even called this out saying that, "by syaing that you're taking power away from yourself. Watching us is not going to help you get better, we can be a distraction, but not much more"
I used to be pretty big into achivment hunter, andd they get told all the time about how their videos have helped others through hard times
its far from a bad thing to be attached to something like Celeste, the issue is when something that becomes a momenet of escapist fantasy becomes a sole source of coping mechanism

You're *better* than them just by the sheer nature of being you. And now you get to to go away to this amazing place and never have to worry about their input"
people develop unhealthy coping mechanisms by focusing on media that makes them feel less isolated
young queer folks often don't have support networks and such
FNAF has an exceptionally large young queer community, whom are getting Rowling'd for the first time and it's not an easy thing to cope with so they are embracing the fictionalized ideal of him in their heads rather than the shit person he is
parasocial relationships
Yang got UBI into the national conversation and thats about it and hes been riding that for his entire career essentially. the guys just a load of dumb shit
advocating stripping the mentally ill of human rights as a PR stunt is certainly a tactic i guess
I'm very interested in the correct way to say we need to lock up the crazy people
https://twitter.com/CaseyHo/status/1405341866183196675 also holy fucking shit Yang sucks in new and exciting ways everyday
guy who made FNAF
so apparently Scott Cawthorn retired. What a fucking loser
deplatforming works
what a hack fuck
ha
the patron saint of accidental queer stories
oh butch hartman
i legit didnt even know they were on youtube i thought it was a twitch thing
you'd be amazed how easy it is when you just don't log onto twitter
idk much about the whole dream smp  thing, but minecraft youtubers and their stans are barn full of roosters that i just am not about to fuck with in anyway whatsoever
so scott decided to take that as contructive criticism and use it to make games so he can give money to politicians who wanna electrocute gay people to death
and yeah cawthorn made some beaver bibile games back in the day and the beavers were animated so jarringly one critic famously said that they looked like animatronics that were going to kill him
i would never know what the fuck a dream smp if not for twitter trending so thats another thing to blame COVID for
just in general about how parasocial relationships are never a good thing and how difficult they are to navigate
which is why you should read animorphs because KA applegate fucking rules
which is why Rowling and Cawthorn is so painful I think for a lot of people, because divorcing the people who you have conivnced yourself helped you from dark times, when said people are in fact pieces of shit. well its not easy
and there is definitely an argument about death of the author when said author is still alive and enjoying their content can directly benefit them to support a cause
its not uncommon. diivorce rates are exceptionally high and all that
wtf is f force
It's a matter of reading the room all things considered. lots of people think that because they are LGBTQIA+ think that because they are that that certain boundaries do not apply to them.
Unfornately, for most companies they just see it as free PR
People quite rightfully cry out for better representation in media
It's the unfortunate by product of modern fandom
as the saying goes, the good ones quit

and they call it bipartisanship
meanwhile republicans have their dicks out, are pissing on said hands and all over the dems and human rights and so forth, refusing to budge even an inch
Democrats will very openly discuss about priding themselves in reaching across the aislee
Republican and Democrat negotiations for the past forty odd years

Top pop star in the world gets insta flagged
he's so fucking smug about it. he thinks hes so goddamn clever
Some next level bullshit right here
AMAZING
is fucking
That meme
this pleases the pineapple
Good! It gay?
if so, is it good?
has anyone watched an anime called Flip Flappers?
I'm gonna give it a try, can't be worse than Jojo's lol
which isnt asking for a lot but this is shonen
I like battle anime just fine, i just need good characters, a reason to care and solid story
Hey, if I hate shitty shounnen anime, will i like MHA?
doing a better job then they are elsewhere in that regard
It's just like a random disney channel show? and its like, "what thell did this come from?" like holy crap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkZEpNsw6zA Not anime  so much, but ive never heard of this show before, but this whole sequence is ridiculously impressive
i will play fate/stay night eventually
oh sweet that makes it super easy
Oh it does?
I suffered through 40 episodes of Jojo's, I can handle whatever Fate can throw at me
Yeah I've noticed that netflix hulu and cR only have unlimited blade works
I'm a bold kind of gal.
starting with the original
I wanna watch it all.
Where's a good place to stream fate/stay night? The original one from 2006?
I watched up till the episdoe where they spent 20 minutes kicking a dog to death
it can't be worse than that
I suffered through jojos
looks neat so far
original in 06
time to start fate
why?
you generally hsould not start with prequels
thats what solo recommended
i think i will follow Solo's watch guide lol
so this is why when i type in fate stay night on youtube theres hundred of videos about how to watch the series lol
it had the distinction of not even being good enough for seocnd place
yeah
especially since nintendo can just port basically any N64 game to the 3DS and jsut print money
like idk why you would enter the hand held game without a killer app
which already had an uphil battle ahead because it didnt possess pokemon
going back to memory cards killed that thing
also not helpful
vita woulda been fine if they gave people a reason to buy it outside of persona
im not doing that
i have a vita
anime it is
but as i currently lack a computer to do so
god I have never rooted for villians harder then the pillar men
the most fucking cringeworthy self insert character I have ever seen
better than joseph
Roided out highschoolers was a hot trend
just roided up highschoolers
there is no normal looking people in jojo
I mean yes, those are actual terms to describe how somebody looks.
shocking
oh my god
LMFAO
is this 2003, did you just use gay as an insult in regards to someones apperance am i in middle school again
i wish araki would show his love for writing by learning how to do it
the only thing it murdered is my patience for shitty shounnen anime
and wasnt just a garish artstyle to hide it's shallow writing and boring characters
I watched over 40 episodes, only one I liked was part 1, because it hhad actual characters stories and themes
it came shortly after the wacky adventures of the pedophile deaging the cast.
> Fate is better anyways
<@!471416654346321930> 

low bar lol
my gay ass is gonna go back to watching fate
i have devoted far too much attention to jojos as is.
kinda proves my point about jojos writing being *embarrasing*
the fact that the fate of one of the main villians is questionable not because of the ambiguousness of his departure but because they forgot to ever bring it up again
who knows!
tell me why they didnt just *kill* santana instead of going out their way to point out that he was still alive and would be a problem they would deal with later.
to watch a video explaining how the plot holes in the show arent actually plot holes
I don't care enough about murder dog simulator the anime
no
in say, idk, ten years time?
how are the nazis gonna keep shining a uv light on him
also
the sun goes down
being dead is one of the benefits
hes a fucking vampire
https://tenor.com/view/doubt-intensifies-gif-14242619
also they just fucking forgot about one of the pillar men
no denying that
it was a sad attempt at trying to make us empathize with a character we barely knew
finally giving a character *Character* during their death scene does not a sad scene make
i remember fallin asleep during his death scene
was he the headband guy
who the fuck was caeser
garbage
friend to nazi's everywhere!
joseph joestar
Joseph is the height of araki's failure as a writer
I also just love how much the show dosnt care about how blatantly it refrences stuff
i need to finish it
*FUCK THAT*
shit
that fucking fifth episode though
I was so happy
so much
made me smile
Flip flap
If you need animal cruelty to prove your villian is a villian you are a bad writer
Oh wait
Like Dio?
I don't fucking care
So funny!
Or Vanilla Ice! Who tortures a dog to death for an entire episode
Naming gimmick in Jojo is they are named after shit bands
See the HILARIOUS
Oh yes
Anf Joseph is the most cringe self insert sherlock Holmes wannabe ever
Two characters standing opposite eachother monologing is not a fight
What fights
Iggy
They feed a baby to its mother
JUST SO YOU KNOW THEY EVIL
Just has then torture animals
Who instead of developing villians
It's written by a hack
Jojos
Also when I have more fingers on my hand then Jojos has female characters, I'm not gonna bother
I watched 40 episode and hated every thing but the music
Also watching a dog get tortured for twenty minutes nmght be your idea of a good show but not mine
I got to the wacky fun adventures of the pedophile and gave up.
time line falling apart? reboot it!
need to establish a villian? barb e cue a dog!
who cares!
so fuck it
as a producer or consumer
jojo's basically is a medium that basically requires you to not be emotionally invested
he can basically do whatever he wants
Dude has it made
In a way, I almost envy araki
I'm not dissing it's fans either. I hate the show but it's just a show.
Except pet murder. I think it has the top belt on that
There is NOTHING in Jojo that has not been done better elsewhere, countless tines
It's a typical shounen. The only thing outstanding about it is its fuck ugly art style tgat is only as garish as it is to distract from the show's nonexistent themes, lack of tension, and meandering story
Easier then making it interesting
Except becoming a story worth investing in
Also when your main writer can't even be bothered to remember his own characters are in the plot why should I?
Berserk is a harsh horrible place that's nothing but cruel. It's the entire point of the series
The point is the cruelty in Jojos, is pointless
Hey you know what would have been great is seeing deal and Jonathan start out as friends and do manipulate Jonathan and ruin his life over the  progress of all of phantom blood but nope barbecues his dog in like episode 3 waste of time
Symphogear made me realize oh hey there's anime out there that isn't awful
and it almost made me quit anime again for another 15 years
Jojos was the first one I dedicated to watching
but I wil lsay that I stopped watching anime 15 years ago
I love plenty of terrible anime
Like what you like

but that's not a story worth investing in to me
which i get is fine
so they can't be disapointed
its not like people expect anything from jojos
time zones are fun
that's what this all boiled out of
next time when someones askes you to stop doing something just stop lol
I feel like the point is being lost here lol
i think the thing to take away from it is that if someone asks you to please stop doing something to just be polite and refrain from doing so~
Ver discourse almost happened like two days ago, but the person doing it chilled out once they realized how terrible past ver memers have taken it before. once we brought it up they was chill~
It depends for me
this does not sound like a show that would pass the three episode test lol
of course it does
Blergh
I have not, but i am liking what i am seeing froom googling it
And it kept introducing concepts and failing to deliver on any of them
Like it was just badly written, boring as hell
His godzilla trilogy also just sucked lol
On the one hand you have Madoka Magica, one of the best animes ever, on the other hand you have his Godzilla trilogy, which is fucking dog ass
Urobutchi is one of the most wildly inconsistant writers ever
Oh ffs
LMFAO
I only put down what I knew he worked on
Would  you recommend liberator?
Best ED
PriPri is a show that I watched last month and my immediate thought was, "God why didnt I watch this sooner"
From the writer of Code Geass and Kabanari of the Iron Fortress, by the studio tat did Flip Flappers, and the music peeps from Madoka~
Excellently well written spy thriller, with amazing music and animation
Very good.
give me my gay spies and their black lizard friends.
Princess Principal movies though, now that I am excited about
true!
S1's slower pace and dedicating time to develop the girls does them so much long term good
First three episodes, has all the stuff with KAnade in episode 1, a bit more background exploration on the world, and episode 3 ends with the introduction of Chris, leading to intrigue in the future
But say Digimon Tamers? It absolutely does not pass the three episode test
So does Princess Principal
Symphogear does GREAT by the Three episode test
its a good rule of thumb, but it's not universally applicable
"HMMMMMMMMMM
and im just like
but looking back on it now since i got back into anime
I loved gundam back in the day
never got into one piece
and has been around longer than almost anyone in this server has been *alive*
gundam also has like 90 fucking shows
I've not seen Aldnoah but my friend has told me that S2 does not happen lol
the best mecha is beyblade obviously
sega saturn
I mean even Death Note has a good OP lol
I have Sweet Blue Flowers on mmy radar, is it worth?
that's a hard pass from me then
I have never talked to a modern naruto fan who has not had a dead look in their eye, and told me "loook it used to be good"
shounnen is just worthlesss to get into
yeah most of shounen is garbage
toonami, fox kids, kids wb
you can go nowhere but up lol
WOW
because i was a fucking loser
and then when I was like 13 I became too cool for anime lol
I got into anime when I was like 3
hey I like wrestling, I can't comment on taste lol
❤️
I am well aware lol
my pall
my buddy
my friend
Cypher
fucking RWBY has better CGI
that dosnt make it good!
when the bar is set lower than *hell* it can only improve
NOT REALLY
an abortion of an anime
Fucking
Berserk 2016 is like
Like no ones opinion is wrong. But this one is
Why are you like this
Cypher
It's good! great visually, and musically, and shit, compared to the modern movies?
the old berserk anime is pretty good tho?
DBZ is probably the most depressing thing ever
I liked Yu Yu Hakusho, and its nice to know that series actually ended without going into Shounnen hell
my point exactly lol
I have a great one to recommend then
oh you like sweet romance?
the most wholesome anime there is
Angel Beats!
or at least in the first few episodes i saw
sakura trick was really boring
Sisters of Wellber is set in Defnitely Not Westeros
Sisters of Wellber is just a baffeling show lol
But GOD
Sakura Trick is barely animated lol
its fucking *weird*
that anime is fucking *weird*
thats it
Sisters of Wellber
AH!
its so fucking bizzarre
called Sisters of Westeria? i think
anime
wild ass
a fucking
Me and Solo have been watching
You *do* have taste Cypher ❤️
Trigun
as oppossed to well, mid 2000s onward
80s/90s anime, a lot of people have shared experience just because there's just not nearly as much
there is also a significant difference in quantity
go watch Fate/stay night by deen~
slep is banned
Serial Experiments Lain, that's my boomer anime recomend of the night
Watamote shounnen confirmed
https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note
If you want sweet romance, I recommend this
ZOIDS
when did the oG astro boy come out? was that 70s? or 60s?
> am i the only one who watched 60s anime
the spiderman cartoon dosnt count
I think the most time I ever commited to an anime that I disliked was jojos
Samurai Champloo is a good
ive never met someone who disliked bebop and now I know like four people who have lol this is wild
https://tenor.com/view/group-text-who-are-you-people-gif-5620388
CYPHER NO YOU WERE DOING SO GOOD
Cardcaptor Sakura!
gdi
why would they give it to DEEN
Hopefully
just so it wasnt so boring
I wish the Ito collection was worse
So fucking dissapointing
junji ito collection?
Bleach will just dissapoint you
you don't want bleach
oh she cute

Ayyy then i watched 60s anime
isnt that just GEN:lock? <:15mins:641787510082764800>
Sephiroth vs. Virgil was the most hilarious. People were so fucking whiney about that one.
The Hiei vs Sasuke one was hilarious because fuck naruto
well the thing is. DB do examine every situation. And determine the winner not on who would win, but who would win the most times because of varying circumstances and variables, and then they animate it in the way that would be the most cinematically exciting.
Berserk wins on account of it not being fucking SAO
people don't really undeerstand how they produce death battles most of the time. i remember people losing their shit over virgil vs sephiroth
so that is definitely gonna influence it
I don't think so. Magia Record was a huge success though and it is getting a season 2
oh god damnit
though god i want that fourth madoka movie to come out
id be less pissed if he was doing nothing!
no hes sitting on his ass playing world of warcraft <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
berserk will join that
are there sword lesbians
AKA the best Death Battle ever
hercule vs dan hibiki
not true!
even if Godzilla was too skinny
The godzilla vs gamera one was pretty cool
complicated lol
its
he gets better
he starts the game technically decapitated
not if you're sephiroth
mommy issues vs daddy issues
It's really not even a contest. Sephiroth being unbetably OP is his *entire* character
https://youtu.be/8sdzSDKquiY
Virgil got his ass kicked
oh god no
Much appreciated!
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Has anyone here seen Made in Abyss? Me and the gf are looking to watch but was wondering if there was any kind of pet death in it, in particular to cats?
I shall add this to the book list
you can't spell necromancy without romance after all~
oooooo~
fuck
over a decade ago
this was a meme
god. every fucking time
didnt a wow expansion get delayed too?
you not even wrong
as if 2020 couldn't get any more unpredictable, Berserk has gone off hiatus
Wonder Egg Priority. This one is gonna be tough to top this year. holy crap its good
give it time
i mean it also just came out in theaters like a week ago lol
Princess Principal is also a fantastic show, that while pretty far removed from being a magical girl show, has some elements. It's not a MG show by any means, but is a great show by itself
Yuyuyu is also a really neat show thats very much in the post madoka world but dosnt feel derivitive
it didn't pass the three episode test for me, but i know people who swear by it so its worth checking out
<@!208724042025402369> moving the nanoha talk here, I will say if you want more nontypical magical girl anime there's Granblem, which I was not a huge fan of, but is definitely different to your typical MG show
🏴‍☠️
great fucking show
people should be watching wonder egg priority
also very nontypical MG show
Mars red. not a bad first impression
god I can't wait for gen to just make the final part to this and just completely botch it
miracles do come true! eat shit carol!
alright gen. gonna need you to not fuck this up
time to play russian roulette on if gen is gonna be involved in this or not

the kind of person who watches things like The Mummy where they translate ancient egyptian into modern english and thinks "yup thats how it works"
said person has no idea how translations work
i was more meaning on the first potential witch
unless they answered that in the waifu game
makes me wonder if we are going to find out who walpurgis is?
its a tragedy that for all the influence that berserk had on the industry people learned all the worst lessons
just don't watch those netflix abortions
it was always fundamentally about hope, and trying to clinge to the idea that you deserved better than what the world dealt you
for all the fucking cringe worthy comically embarassing grimdark shit it inspired
that's the thing about berserk
there is just no way to imagine what pop culture would look like without berserk
There'd be no Sephiroth without griffith. no buster sword without the dragon slayer. without berserk we might not even have JRPG's in the west in a widespread fashion. good god what a fucking loss to pop culture.
dude got his shit published when he was 10
berserk is why it's *called* the berserk state
a genuine fucking tragedy
fromsoft as a company would not be what it is without it
Gear has enormous influences from berserk
fate, final fantasy, yu yu hakusho, SAO, AOT, Madoka magica, any and all stories with a character wielding a giant sword
you can't even remotely discuss gaming and anime scene of the last 30 years without tracing it back to berserk
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/berserk/images/2/25/Manga_E0F_God_Hand.png/revision/latest?cb=20190402003143

http://techanimate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/berserk-manga-dragon.jpg
literally every frame a painting
not even remotely close
no one even came close to berserk
and despite all the countless shitty imitators that constantly missed the point of berserk
also soulsborne, monster hunter, literally any dark fantasy anime of the last 30 years
berserk basically invented "brooding man with big sword"
you're talking about one of the most influential manga in the history of forever
itis fucking impossible to understate how influential his shit is
this fucking sucks so much
i genuinely cannot comprehened how different pop culture would be without berserk
gotta represent my girl
berserk is far from perfect, and full of just as many low points as highs, but goddamn the thing is a canvas of human emotion and all the pain and joy that entails
https://readberserk.com/
for those who want to seek it out
*anyways*
not to mention cloud and sephiroth
especially after the last year, berserks story feels more relevant than ever
Miura not being able to finish his magnum opus feels like the burning of the library of alexandria, for all that will be unresolved, but that cannot take away the tremendous impact and influence it has had across all pop culture. particularly in the manga and gaming industry.
if yo ucan stomach it, you really can experience what is genuinely what one of the most important works of the 20th century
there are more than enough guides out there on what to expect to see in berserk, and i hihgly recommend seeking them out
some of it extreamly early on in the series
it really cannot be overstateed that these people go through some of the worst shit imaginiable
and for all that it has been memed to death and shamelessly imitated
berserk is infamous for its brutal violence and content
to those who are interested, do go in with precaution
which the movies, simply by the nature of lacking the time needed, can't do justice
its real heart and soul is in the quieter moments
for as much as berserk is a violent and intense story
the movies are okay, but you'll be losing a lot.
which is all there is thats been adapted really
the biggest reason being, you're gonna get more than like 10% of the story
but the manga is really the best way to experience berserk
the 90s anime is definitely very 90s, but it is the closest they ever got to replicating his art style
comparatively it's better, but when it cannot be worse, it does not make it good
honestly the modern adaptations of berserk are insulting
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589841630555668503/811384915044073482/unknown.png
higu is the best thing to quote out of context
from shojo manga, to disney, to a journey to the west
hell Miura has never been one to shy about the various things that influenced his work
oh for sure
you might as well try to imagine a world without batman or marvel comics
good for casual fans or more for diehard fans of Goji and such?
Anyone checkout Godzilla: Singular point? Shit? Not shit?
sooon
ooooo~
one of my favorite animes of all time
Lain is astonishingly fucking good
madoka's great. no better time to be a madoka fan then right now
granblem i only watched 3 eps of and and thats an hour of my life i'll never get back
off topic, but do people know where to best find the sephirotic subs for Evangelion, or is the adv dub enough to suffice?
also been planning on checking out Jujutsu Kaisen since ive heard good things
ive been enjoying Digimon Ghost game and meiruko chan a lot
despite that show being impossible to enjoy now while the author is still alive
there's also the ruroni kenshin dub which I remember being good
I have heard that Hellsings dub holds up well?
and good lord if Hiei was around when tumblr was at its peak?
black lagoon comes *close* but theres something that revy's engrish adds that is lost in the dub a bit
https://tenor.com/view/hiei-ghost-fighter-gif-11237199
and of coruse
not to mention one of, if not the, all time greatest dubs ever done
still one of the only shounen anime from the childhood thats survived a rewatch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc7kbzn5C9I
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI_el2XhI8s this one will always hit the nostalgic bits
oh this is a bopper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNhuXQyyBr8
also
still need ot watch that one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGKjPD_BNAE
flip flappers is up there too
~~in between its bouts of existential nihilism about the nature of good and evil and the dehumanizing nature of captalism~~
and the answer is "my life would be AWESOME"
"What if my girlfriend was a fucking insane person obsessed with guns? What would my life be like?"
anime that asks the hard question
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZh3tK6zkw still one of my favorite ED's in an anime
> he might as well be MST3King his own work and saying "What you guys are getting emotionally invested? the fuck for? I'm not!"
Hercule is unironically the best part about the buu saga. videl is fantastic as well, and she even tricks you into thinking that toriyama is going to start giving a shit about his human characters again
why don't they try making goku into a dad
when the hulk hogan parody character and his hot daughter is the best character of the final arc of your magnum opus, you are a fucking failure as a writer
and im not here for Toriyama being like "NO THIS FOR SURE!"
you only get to waste so much of my time
i never watched super and im quite proud of that
continuing toriyamas proud new legacy of pissing away and destroying his old one
he might as well be MST3King his own work and saying "What you guys are getting emotionally invested? the fuck for? I'm not!"
its toriyama shitting on the storytelling techniques that he himself perfected
its insulting
in buu saga SS3 is used as a "hey look over here!" moment
his arc being that of "I am going to surpass goku one of these days, either because of my natural training or because he is going to die and his reponsibilities will fall onto me, and my pacifism isnt gonna cut it." by the time of SS2 in the cell games, this all comes to a head
Gohan going into super saiyan 2 is a direct part of his arc
insulting comparison
Not even remotely close
Goku going super saiyan 1 and fully embracing the rage of his decimated ancestors against their direct oppresor
DBZ is a henshen anime. transformations matter, its the author making a direct signifier to the audience that this is a permanent change in the characters inherant character
it flies in the way of how transformations were used before
i mean it's not just that its stupidly implimented
"also I still hate my children thank you for asking"
"could I have used it to stop vegeta? or save my son from being horribly murdered? yes. did I? No. its much more important i use it as a glorified road flare because shit trunks is being an idiot"
and then midway through the buu arc goku is just like "lol btw i can go ss3"
and how the entirety of the show from episode 1 to the episode it happened built towards gohan going super saiyan 2
the entire freiza arc built towards goku going super saiyan
lest we forget how like
"one day"
its fucking horrible, with shit characters, shit pacing, shit action, shit transformations
the buu fucking sucks
of 291
thats episode 237
the buu saga peaks with majins vegeta's sacrifice
status quo restored
gokus back
Gohan's entire arc for the first like....200 episodes? of dbz were pissed away
we know how this ends
and shit all over what they built towards in cell saga
because the second goku came back
we know only goku will
we know gotenks won't win
and gotenks is  a shit gimmick for shit characters
and it was shit because kid trunks and goten are shit characters
also it was shit
he's a movie villian
gotta love how in the buu saga bulma, the second longest tenured character in the entire history of the franchise is killed and is treated with less gravitas and emotional weight then fucking YAMCHA
speaking of dragon ball
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcPylVFbmPA
It also hurts that everything after Yayaka's pay off has to be compared to Yayaka's payoff
Flip flappers is a weird case where the "Filler" so to speak is significantly better than the main plot

I yearn for a magical girl anime whose main characters arc is as strong as Yayaka's arc in flip flappers

Nanohas first season is definitely better as a movie imo
Yayakas magia girl design might aslo be my favorite magical girl design ever
they are getting the point where I want to see them make a bad anime just so I know they can
especially with princess principal
3hz is making one hell of a track record
