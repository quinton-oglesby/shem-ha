hello
it took me a good half a minute for that HRT/trans meme to click in, for a moment I was thinking about the previous producer of Granblue Fantasy
he tends to draw a lot of art like that
pretty sure the artist is BB

the most obvious is Kirari in that lol
this is 100% an edit of an im@s CG pic lol
why are gungnirs so great

cute
well, Miku knows well about Hibiki being happy

that's the Wing

that was a Index reference, isn't it?
her voice makes me HNNNGGG
Rom > Ram tbh

you don't want to see the gunpla I have not built yet
(also, if any of you want to see a closeup of any of them, feel free to ask)
the only poses from there that I don't like are the Sinanju and the Strelizia, but the build didn't allow for more

in case you ever need inspiration for poses, you are free to take any of these
I have a lock screen but I never see it because the music app always takes it lol
(it's easy to see if you look at any of my gundams)
in terms of poses, I always prefer to have characters doing "something" than just standing there
plus, background
also, pose-wise, the frontal one is sorta... boring while the Christmas one is more dynamic
not a fan of frontal shots
art-wise, I prefer the christmas one

certainly not safe for the hands
without the Memoria borders
maybe it was phrased wrong, what I mean is that adding foreign substance to the body will have an effect on it, even the best medicament has side effects that may appear (not on everyone)
that would be way better, taking in meds is never good, but it's still necessary sometimes
if they give you something for it, make sure to continue taking it even if you think you're fine, because what they give are made to make you feel fine
Yeah, looking professional help would be good
I don't know what is it about, but seeking professional help is always a good idea
packing lunch is also cheaper than eating out
unless it's at 21 in your country
being legally adult makes things easier for you to be independent I guess
I hope it ends up well
I guess it all just came wrong, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend anyone
if you need them (and all mental illnesses are more than enough of a reason for that) then there's no going around
needing being the keyword
of course, it was more on the "it's better if you don't *need* to take meds" rather than "you shouldn't"
I'm a bit more towards the south, like 2 countries south lol
That's good to hear, I hope it all goes well and you can move out safely
well, the wrong answer is telling lies
there is also no right or wrong answers
at this point I never get nervous on job interviews, they're all the same
I had an interview this morning, it was short but you never know
I keep looking
and chemistry
gz = gratz = congrats
I'm still looking for a job
gz
for these few days, you can try to be with headphones 24/7 to evade whatever is said
I'm guessing he hasn't resorted to physical violence since you haven't mentioned it
depression is one those things I'm sorta afraid of commenting about because it's easy to be insensitive due to not really understanding it
when the pain attacks started happening like twice a week I went for surgery
it wasn't permanent pain tho, but it could last half an hour easily
the pain felt like having a red hot iron going through your torso
all I can say is that gallstones ain't fun
it's hard to relate to stuff like that, but pain is always easy to understand
but I can still do a lot of the stuff I shouldn't be able to
well, I lost most of my felixibility as I grew up
I'm hyperlaxo, but nowhere near that stuff
had stones and had to get it removed, now the moment I eat more than I should I need to go empty myself
the most I have is a fucked up digestive system due to not having gallbladder
the name does indeed sound painful
If someone wants to do damage they'll find a way, sadly
(also, technically the term faggot would be wrong since it's used to refer to men)
One thing that always baffles me is the need people have to throw shit to people they don't like. It's fine if you don't like or hate someone, you don't have to like everyone, but if you have nothing nice to say about someone, better say nothing
Sounds like someone worthy of a ban
The fuck is wrong with people
then think that all of this is going to end soon
today it's the last day, right?
Dr Ver is amazing
I am not qualified to determine if it can affect the mind
at least, physical problems
even if you "hoard" them, since they're virtual it wouldn't cause any real problems
the act of downloading jpg in itself is not bad
the reason could also be because they're pretty
there's no reason for it to be unhealthy
saving anime girls?
tbh, it hit me harder when I turned 30 than now that I'm turning 31
I'm a grandpa
I'm turning 31 this saturday
I can call you kiddo then c:
an acquiantance sort of suddenly revealed "to the world" that she was a girl, bi and poly (though, in spanish it sounds funny to say that you're poly without the complementary word because it sounds like you're revealing that you're police)
ah ok
the "Nor my gfâ€™s gf", your girlfriend's girlfriend?
btw, there was something you said rakhi that confused me
it's nice that your dad still wants to help you despite that tho
damn
I am, I didn't know about the whole Vali thing until very recently for example
(in her case, she's lesbian tho)
I have not had to deal with that stuff, but it would terrify me (just like it terrified my sister to tell my parents)
you trusted them and they responded
but it wasn't like that
well, yeah, but what if you told them and then they left you? that would have been utter shit
which in turn makes you more comfortable about having told them who you are
well, I'm pretty sure that stuff like this just reassures that the people you care about are with you
I dislike Gilgamesh in Fate Stay Night, but I agree that he's a great character
yeah
I'm sure that vali is not voiced by Sugita
also, voiced by Sugita
Dr Ver is an amazing character tho
I am completely aware that my sense of humor is offensive as fuck, so I keep it to people I know share that same awful humor
tbh, I keep my sense of humor out of most servers
as I said, just acquiantance, so not close enough to discuss
I don't even know her enough to even guess what the depression is generated from
I know, we didn't say anything about it because I'm aware it could case more harm than good
that acquiantance I mentioned earlier, most of the people around her are afraid that it was all too sudden, like, noone could guess it AT ALL and suddenly in like the span of 2 weeks she went from just bi, to trans, to poly and already starting hrt and having a second gf, and before revealing anything she had a lot of problems with depression and stuff, so we're sorta afraid she's going too fast
g'night
anyway, I'll be going to sleep, it's past 1 and I have slept 4 hours last night because I had to be up "early"
is the hormone treatment covered in any way by healthcare?
aah, that makes sense
oh, didn't know that (the gp thing I mean)
(I don't know many terms related to all that)
gp?
or something like that
you need 1 and a half day of uninterrumped rest per week, plus you can't start the next work day less than I think it's 8h or something from the previous end of work
100h a week is literally illegal
I honestly never understood why people would not vote
I've voted every time I could except the one time I was literally living in a different country and didn't have enough time to vote through mail
more than 50% of the people didn't vote
and the worst part is that the people who voted left wing just didn't go to vote
hell, I'd rather be part of the UK than part of this
but that doesn't matter to those who don't live there
yep
This Sunday, in a region that is usually considered a preliminary analisis of the results in the general elections for Spain, a party that is against lgbt rights, against any kind of protection for victims of gender violence (including rape), against helping refugees, against euthanasia and abortion, who outright said that the francoist regime we had wasn't a dictatorship, that party, went from 20k votes to 320k votes and got 12 representants on their parliament out of 109, more than 10% of the representation.

And this makes me afraid of what can happen in the general elections if this party gets the same kind of increase. They also want to straight up abolish autonomy of each region and would pretty much kill any language other than Spanish (currently, there's 3 other languages considered official in Spain besides Spanish). Oh right, and also put a bigger wall in Ceuta and Melilla to block immigrants and retake Gibraltar (who is part of the UK).
it'll be a bit of a wall of text btw
can I rant a bit about politics here?
there's was even a party here whose entire program was to not be at the parliament ever unless it was to change the electoral laws
and it would be more useful than not voting
and with a system that pretty much allows literally any political party like the one we have, I'm sure you could vote for something stupid
not voting means that you are fine with whatever result, but most people what they think is "I don't like any of them"
if a person who has no contacts, and doesn't even speak the language
one of the arguments I love the most from racists is the "they take our jobs"
specially considering a lot of north-african countries were former french colonies
or just move into france
they either stay in the south
but they'd rather cross the sea than trying to cross the wall
well, technically are in africa, since Ceuta and Melilla are there
(Spain)
being like 15km away from africa
we get a good chunk of illegal immigration tho
because if you gonna move somewhere, it's better if it has the same language
we're also one of those countries that colonized a good chunk of the world and now most of the (legal) migrants come from those places
like the UK didn't colonize half the world and their people mixed, right?
a good chunk of them have their work permit anyway
I'm sure the ones who seriously voted yes think that brexit will kick all the migrants out
any place that gets migrants will have a ton of xenophobia
xenophobia is insane everywhere tbh
and then get fucked
it's the usual thing, one side thinks they're gonna win with no effort, so they don't vote or jokevote for the other option
the only reason they're not stopping it is because they don't want to go back onto their word since it was what the brit voted
they're just very vocal
as long as it's an honest mistake, I don't see why aonyone would get genuinely mad
(obviously, doing it on purpose is a different thing)
so unless we're told beforehand, we could make a mistake unknowingly
spanish has all adjectives gendered
I can understand why they would get pissed at people assuming their gender, but they also need to understand that (specially in some languages) we *need* to assume the gender of the other person if it has not been specified prior
"mezclar el tocino con la velocidad" (mixing the pig with the speed)
there is an expression that I fucking love from here that works really well for people doing those arguments of gender vs age
but gender and sex aren't the same thing
bam, you're exempt from prison
say you're legally 17
can make it worse
but age DOES have changes legal-wise
leaving aside the whole part where the gender problems affect the mind and so on, changing the gender doesn't (or shouldn't) have any legal implications since (supposedly) we're all equal before the law regardless of gender, ethnicity or religion
migrants also tend to contribute more on welfare than they get from it
(this is obviously, on regulated jobs with actual contracts, not jobs paid outside of the legality)
or maybe you don't want to do that job anyway
maybe you're missing something
gets the job
btw, I got a job interview tomorrow morning
>mfw I have a NIN in UK
I can understand not wanting ero stuff in a game that shouldn't have it tho
the only solution would be to get you away from him, it would not heal the damage, but it would avoid further damage
I might not say anything regarding your situation because I don't know what to say and I'd rather avoid saying something insensitive, but know for sure that I'm reading it all
at least*
maybe we can't help, but we can already lend an ear (or eye)
this is exactly the place for this, Sketch
if you gonna do it when they work, I'd say do it when if it fails, you're going to leave anyway so that it doesn't become awkward for both of you
I feel the same but towards everyone, or rather, that if I talk to them I'll bother them so if they want to talk to me they'll come
I don't have any confidence at all in myself, so I wouldn't do it
no matter what, it wil be awkward as fuck
gather courage and do it
tbh, there is only one step
at least that's what happened every single time with me
with awkwardness
people can't understand the power of words
aren't you half of that word?
I wanted to be friends with him because he was literally the only other person that liked a lot of stuff that I liked too
my best friend had to deal with that kind of rumours as well when I first met him, he didn't trust me at all because he thought I was in with the people spreading rumors (when I didn't even know about said rumors and didn't even talk with any of that people)
breakups can fuck up your head and heart a lot
there's also the mentality that children should outdo their parents in a lot of cases
(for their child I mean)
parents wanting to compete with other people through their children are the worst
but they never mentioned what either of them do or accomplish
I still feel inadequate and sub par compared to my brother (completed college in the amount of years it was supposed to, got job after job nonstop and now living in germany) or my sister (in college and passing everything in her career)
in my case, I went through the complete oposite case, I *thought* my parents wanted me to go to college and get a good job, so I went to college despite me never having liked to study in itself, ended up spending like 9 years there only to drop it
and then my parents proposed me to go for actual practical studies instead of something as study focused as college, and I realized they weren't expecting me to get into any specific direction but rather doing what I wanted to
I understand her thought process, as in, she wasn't doing to piss you off or anything but rather thinking that working an office job (which is a stable source of income) would be better because stability is good, but sometimes they should stop for a moment and ask the person in question what they actually want to do
and having family involved in corruption cases
and continue to maintain a monarchy whose only use is diplomacy with other monarchies
this is a country that despite being supposedly a secular state, we still give a % of taxes to the Church
Spain, specially towards the south, has a whole lot of racism due to immigrants from northern Africa
the more you travel and more people you meet, the more you understand and accept differences
you know, racism is healed by traveling
and from cousins, all the ones who went to study to big cities ended up opening their minds
I've heard quite a lot of racist commentaries from family (uncles and such, not my household) to the point where I've blocked any kind of politics that comes from them because I'd rather avoid discussing it than having confrontations
and that changed their view on things
my parents moved from countryside to big city
not sure about rest of the family tho
but for my sister
not for me
I'm happy my parents are so understanding
(that still has sleeves)
but wfc, not you, nor me, nor anyone else is above or below the rest
I missed oportunities because I was so fucking dense
if she, or you, thought that she was above the rest, then she (or you) was wrong, because noone is above the rest
you were **NOT** at fault for asking her out
because you can say "I'm sorry I'm not interested in you" and leave it at that
refusing is ok, being disrespectful is not
(just like the other person is also not at fault for just refusing someone)
noone is EVER at fault for asking someone out
didn't last too long and it ended badly
my first successful was when I was 18
I've only confessed when I was like REALLY FUCKING SURE it was a yes and even still I feared a no
anyway, going back to wfc, try to be truer to yourself when it's not job related
I'm genuinely afraid of telling my friends my troubles out of fear of them dismissing my problems as something minor despite my head telling me that they wouldn't
(at the same time, I'm terrified as fuck about what my close friends think about me)
at one point I just stopped giving a fuck about what random people thought about me
I'd rather show other people how passionate I am about the things I care about even if they don't give a fuck about them, than show interest in things I don't care
I do feel lonely, and the kind of loneliness that friends can't fill, but I won't let it bring me down more than it should
I don't think anyone has been interested in me in ages, and I don't even know if I'd have anything to offer to them
Listen, kid, here I am in my 31, haven't had a girlfriend in like 7 or 8 years, and currently I don't even have opportunities to *meet* other people besides my current group of friends. If I don't change this, I will end up alone, but I sure as hell won't think that I'm below the rest for this reason. I'm envious of my friends and acquaintances and my family even for how happy they all look with their couples, but even if I think I won't ever find someone for me, I'm not gonna put myself down for this.
how old are you?
which is pretty much like saying EN, or CN or ES or whatever country you want to refer
I usually say JP for japanese
I have a question, more aimed at the admins but I'd rather have everyone's input... what is your opinion on the usage of terms that could be considered slurs by some people like "chink" (to shorten the word chinese) or "jap" (instead of japanese)? Are they considered offensive and thus should be avoided? or if used for the ONLY purpose of shortening words without any extra intention is ok?
good luck!
because I'm unemployed and I can't even *think* about moving out until I have some stability
I'm 31 and living with my parents
I'm living with my parents
I'm lucky I don't have to pay rent or anything
using up my savings currently
I've been 5 months unemployed
probably better there than here lol
maybe if you use some tangible reason he might
try telling him to swallow his pride for EVO
I can only help those who want to be helped
yes, better work than do nothing
I just hope I'm right
because the last we all need is me panicking
I will trust in him
that I know of, but it's the first time I see him this way too
I'm worried
it's been more than half an hour since he viewed the whatsapp messages (and he denies phonecalls)
at the very least I want him to go home
all I can do is tell him that I'm there for him and that I don't want for him to die
I honestly don't know what to do
and he's saying he wants to kill himself
and I can't go there physically because I don't even know where is he
my best friend broke up with his gf (or rather, she broke up with him) and now he's deep into shit
fffffffffffffffffff-
Nephilim?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Noise?
how did it go?
ah, then these should be OK to use then
at the very very least, I have never seen it identified as offensive
well, CN is the equivalent to JP, EN and such, it's what I see in every wiki and stuff
but the chinese one is used a lot in some servers without the context of slur, so I wanted to know people's opinion on it, better make sure before making a mistake
if he doesn't listen, he'll see that he won't be able to do what he wanted
sounds like the only way he'll learn is by encountering difficulties, like "not going to EVO" could be
I'm from 1987
grandpa here
also avoiding saying it in the way of "it would hurt me if you did it"
that's pretty much all I've been saying
I'm afraid of saying the wrong thing
I honestly don't know how to deal with someone who is suicidal
going back to what I said last night, it seems that my friend did try to kill himself
I love how the media over here say that "the demography in Spain is getting older and it's the young people's fault for not having kids" and here we are not having financial stability, SO OF FUCKING COURSE WE ARE NOT HAVING KIDS
can't move out because >unemployed
in my case, I was "under their rules" until I got a job, but they paid for my gas and whenever I went out and everything, now I'm still living there, but I pay for all my spending, which includes gas, going out and all that
yeah
it's not the same going to a different city in the same country than going to an entire different continent lol
well, if I was the parents, I wouldn't let him go in a VERY expensive vacation if he doesn't have a job that can pay for it
would be amusing if the reason is because he has no job tho
everyone deserves to be happy
I'm pretty sure alcohol is something one would easily give up for this reason
thank you all for the answers
that's one hell of a good side effect for you
considering how humans work (nothing is ever absolute in biology) it's not *that* unexpected that it can happen
I do know that there are more than just XX and XY even genetically (be it the lack of one of them or the duplicity of one), but didn't know that that did happen
oh, didn't know that
thanks for the explanation (and also telling me what was the proper term)
if I say something that is wrong or insensitive, forgive me (and please tell me why it is wrong)
hormones
I'm *not* knowledgable and all the stuff that goes on
transitioning
this is a question (out of curiosity) to those of you who understand about all the issues related to trans people...

does the treatment have any effect on the chances of having health issues that are specific to the genetical sex from before transitioning (not sure what's the proper term you use for it), like prostate cancer?
and I also feel bad because I realize that I don't want to handle them
I feel bad because I want to help them but I can't, but I also don't want to *have* to handle the problems, I don't know how to explain it
and I honestly don't want to lose anyone
I feel that if I don't at least try, it can go bad, very bad
and I definetely can't tell them this
and I also feel like I shouldn't rant about this because they are in a worse situation than me
I don't want to have to deal with the problems my friends have, it makes me feel terrible because I can't do shit and it just goes on and on, specially problems that aren't easy to relate like the ones related to the psyche. I don't want to, but I have to because it's my friends I'm talking about and that's what friends are for, but I can't handle it and either I feel bad because I try to talk to them and can't help or I feel bad because I don't talk to them (bc I know they are not well and can't help)
just a rant about my personal situation
can I say something very selfish and insensitive (it's not discriminatory or offensive I think)?
which is essentially the same
so it's called Cava
"champagne" is pretty common over here, though it's not called champagne due to not being from the region of champagne
and the last time I suggested seeking professional help, he didn't take it positively
I can't magically cure his depression
and I don't know what else to do anymore
but he keeps going on about feeling dead
I've told him that I'm there, that I'll be his walking stick if he wants, that I believe in him and that he can get out of it, that I want him to live
I have no clue how to help a friend with a severe depression
but honestly, I don't see anything wrong on Kirito as a character (I see some things wrong on how stuff happens around him in some arcs tho)
Alicization is SAO without skipping how Kirito got so strong, and every "powerup" he gets has an explanation that has been going on from the very start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKYmpq-V3Rs
and the anime even skipped the only interesting part
ALO is just plain awful
that sort of changed in Alicization
Ordinal Scale does a good job in putting in the union between GGO and Alicization
(based on the LN) my favorite arcs are: Alicization > SAO > MR > GGO >>>>>>>>> ALO
Kirito does work his way up
it does
~~that was the joke~~
but it not good comfy tbh, MiA is good comfy
not as much as MiA
just look how cute it is https://puu.sh/Cg1Ke/0533014689.png
*that* part with Mitty still made me cry despite knowing exactly what was going to happen
I already watched the MiA anime, but haven't read the manga yet, so I started from the whole part with Nanachi
Made in Abyss is comfy, look how cute and comfy the art looks
you know, magical girls, what could go wrong?
YuYuYu is comfy too
that pic hurts me
the contrast between the SoL comedy and the actual plot is just too big
tbh, I'd make an anime of only the serious part
you'll find top dad
https://twitter.com/712_boy/status/1078913463173304321
nendoroids for cute and confy manga/anime are up for preorder
