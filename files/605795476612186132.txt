she's who made me get into Symphogear in the first place!
she's my friend, I sent her the invite
Hiiiiiii Summer :^)
And that's why I say it's often cringey
that entertainment tends to get... a little too far-
Let's just say, Mediaset channels focus more on entertainment than information
Most Mediaset programs aren't really like that, there's tons of oversexualization
The reason why the message is positive is mainly because the hosts are smart people
> it still sucks ofc
<@!87512939107450880> it really does lmao, it's just stupid as hell
are you Italian like me, by any chance?
> to let the host speak against racism.
<@!87512939107450880> oh yeah I remember that thing happening, I just saw it on FB tho
I never watched it bc it's cringey
Oh it's fine, I didn't even see the message before being edited, it's perfectly fine!
