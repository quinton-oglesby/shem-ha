erhm, did you intended to include an address and such?
Germans were never shy about sticking random prototypes into the field lol
Odd ducks occasionally used different things
Germans, generally, used 20, 37, 50(2 lengths), 75(3 lengths), 88(2 lengths), and 128mm guns on their tanks
Or was it the 105mm from the Wespe? I can't remember
75mm was what they based it off
yeah basically
They tried to scale up German HEAT ammunition for it, which theoretically had decent pen, but they never fused properly
it wasn't an anti-tank gun
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

It's a stolen BT-5/BT-7 hull with a British 4.5in field gun stuck in a box as a turret

Guess the gun calibre on that
I mean that does seem hilarious
Gungnir datto?
but there's no reason to assume that *necessarily* you *are* skimping on protection, if you're genre-savvy
Obviously, you don't seem to be going for that
so it can be as skimpy as it wants and it doesn't matter
A lot of magical armour simply provides all-round protection regardless of physical appearance, ala the barrier jacket
Well on the flipside
Though, that in itself is a joke, because her original Magical Girl Costume from Nanoha prototype ended up being used as her school uniform in the proper series

That one Joe linked and a Vivid school uniform one w/ Chris IIRC
~~Ignore that it's item C because it's missing the instruction booklet, the figure itself is B, and it only has a tiny scratch in the paint on the bottom of the foot~~
Hell, my Fate is *item: C* and it's nearly perfect
But if you like Nanoha, it does have cheap pre-owneds
Buy it and hope the yen drops by the time it arrives? That's what I did with my Hayate
Ah, a shame
Eh, I was never too much of a fan of that Vita figure
*Because there's an item B/ box B version of that vivio for ¬£15.99*

COME,I SHALL GIVE YOU BREADS FAMOUS "2:33 AM SLIGHTLY INSANE HASN'T DATED IN 2 YEARS DATING ADVICE"
Course, they can't date you if they don't know you exist, so some level of out thereness is required
That's fine lat, not everyone's looking for someone who'll steal the show every time
Every time, without fail
Not that that means I don't have the social skills to make it work; in fact, I'd say I'm fairly easy going and affable, charming even, if I want to be; but I get burnt out after interacting with people for like, ooooh, 3 hours? And simply want to be left alone.
I've tried dating, and I'm far to much of an introvert for it

Still don't own Witcher 3
But that's because I generally don't buy AAA games anyway
I mean I was never likely to buy it tbh
Seems like a decent apology to me
Like at all
I honestly don't see it
Eh, people make mistakes
Can't assume everyone is perfectly aware of how everyone takes information
Better to apologise than say nothing
I mean it's not like they said "Let's kill all babies." Or anything. Someone made a poorly thought out joke and they apologised for it.
Though I will admit Alice's wording is superior, that given and hers have the same meaning to me.
I mean, what's wrong with that apology? It's not like they went "Sorry if you were offended lol"
They literally said "Sorry to anyone who was offended, it really wasn't our intention"
It's about as good as you could possibly do with an 140 character limit
I mean, an apology is all you can really ask for, isn't it?
I mean, I was being semi-serious
If the the joke was clearly intended to be humourous not malicious, then I don't see why they should be stuck on a never gonna buy anything from them again blacklist
But then again I'm super relaxed about jokes in general and don't see the point in being offended by one so my opinion is clearly biased
Dunno, was the joke funny?
I mean, totally valid to care about those things, I just... don't.
But that's different. I won't give EA money because I know they don't care about the games they make. They take your money, take some more for good measure, then the game dies from lack of support / the same fucking bugs the last three instalments had and they shut down the servers a year and a half after release
And that's just because their business practices are shitty
The only companies I basically definitely won't give my money to are EA and Ubisoft
Never played it myself but have literally heard nothing but great things about it
tbh gameplay trailers and reviews are more my kind of thing for finding out how much I want to play a game
^this
It just doesn't matter as much as the gameplay to some people
And some people care about what the company behind the game does and some people only care about the game itself
Indeed
...Because the game is fun?

The future is now old man
I did basically CS
Hear
You wanna do CS, did I here?
What a twat
If it still existed I would suggest my course :(
It's just worth remembering that just because CS looks daunting, the uni may offer a similar course which less people know about
But other Unis might do then
Birmingham discontinued theirs the year after I started
Extremely similar to CS but much looser requirements and you get a BEng not aBSc
I did one at Birmingham
It's also worth checking out if any are offering a "Computer Systems Engineering" or similar course
But they all basically required AAA to get on them and were extremely competitive
When I was looking a few years ago, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Bath, Imperial College London, and Cambridge were all "top" CS unis
I know the good CS unis, but I don't really know if that'll be useful
I know, I remember from the other server <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

nani sore
don't fall into the trap of thinking the only solution is to find a relationship. More often then not that'll simply lead to a dependant or co-dependency relationship, which are by their very nature unstable. 1 person cannot provide all the happiness in a relationship, it just doesn't work.
I'm gonna take a second to second everything just said here
Man I haven't thought about relationships for about 2 years.
that's what everyone thinks
Miku
Hey Miku, just do it. Distract yourself with it
Tbh I can't relate. I've had it pretty good overall, and I'm a massive introvert who barely requires human interaction to function. But don't tear yourself apart
I've never heard of a successful long-term polyamorous relationship
It's admirable that you think that way, and in an ideal world that would work, but people are ugly jealous creatures.
Damn I ended up rambling a bit
Personally I can't relate. I've been out of a relationship for 2 years now, and the only thing I miss is the sexual activities. Not because the relationship was bad or anything, I'm just not wired like that. I don't need those close bonds. But honestly, Miku, I know I don't know your whole story or anything, but you come across as really, really, desperate, and not in a good way, if such a thing can exist. You admitted yourself, you have a bunch of underlying issues, and rushing into a relationship won't fix them, and could potentially mess up your relationship. Even if you spell it out to your partner before hand, even if they think they're ready for it, they most likely aren't. It's fine to want to be loved Miku, but you really don't need to rush it. You don't need to. You have so much of your life ahead of you, you're young, so don't get caught up in a trap of thinking you need to immediately jump into a relationship that will last you forever. Hell, there's nothing wrong even with trying to get into a relationship soon, but you're too desperate. You'll pour all your love into a girl and then some issue will come up and you'll hate yourself even more. Don't get caught in that cycle. Don't *rush*.
Bit like an Arachne IIRC
Anyway, continue

Then I talk to non-technical people and apparently stuff I take for granted is incomprehensible to them

This sounds like a waste of air, not a feminist
Then she's a shitty feminist
In that case I'm also inherently part of the problem. Which it's not true. I'm a problem because I'm a lazy, selfish Fuck.
I don't think I am ü§î
You could hide in that hair
Sweet
But honestly, good benefits?
*laughs in NHS*
No visiting the wobbles for me. At least not any time soon
That's almost as far away as you can get from where I am now <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Need to know if it's close enough to visit <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Where was it again?
JOB GET
YUS
Strongly doubt != know, after all
I've never gone to a support group for anything, but surely if they continue to exist they must offer something useful. Just don't expect a magical solution.
Ah
When did Corbyn become literally Hitler?
Dunno, but the Nai was are perfect
Now the only thing on my To Be Adapted list is Shinozaki
I'm just happy it's getting an adaptation
other than the snout I like the anime design too
I do like the manga's design too
tbh I read the novel before the manga so I always imagine little Kumo as a white Joltik
She's a metre long spider, what about it has to make sense
I've read all of this, it's actually great and I'm really looking forward to seeing if they can capture the charm properly in the anime
Web Novel Kumo best Kumo
Lolitech priest for best girl
Chise was great
~~They just make me jealous is all~~
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
ew music people stay away! /s
Yuru camp is comfier tho
K-On is very comfy
Initially he wants her to just call him Momon, but she can't agree to that level of familiarity, as she is essentially his sworn vassal, so they compromise with Momon-san, which she still has trouble with initially just because of reflex
In that particular case, I think it's important, because Narberal is resisting the urge to call him Momon-sama and is calling him Momon-san
I approve of both of these
^
Shall I link them here or DM?
So Naberal became a fucking cow for some reason?
They translated the "Momon-saaaaa-n" joke as "Mr Momoooooo-n"
I've heard bad things about the official TLs though
If you don't that's cool
I can hit you up with unofficial ones if you want
I haven't read the official TLs myself
Neia is best girl
It's fantastic
I've read all the volumes
Watch all the GuP
Watch Das Finale pt1
Watch Der Film
Watch Anzio
Ew, kissanime
It's comfy enough
Eh, if you have a nice enough chair you don't need to recline much
Only saving the HDDs
I'm basically gonna rebuild my PC completely once I start getting paid
I wasn't planning on it Wolf
I can use uBlock origin on everything on my computer lol
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
For example, I prefer to watch things on my PC
well not entirely, I still can't really see a reason to buy a PS4, but I wasn't seriously questioning it. You do you
If it wasn't obvious, that was a joke
~~why own a PS4~~
y though
~~Yeah but fuck crunchyroll too~~
look at me I'm crying
You make me cry wolf
pls
pleas
Just please don't use amazon subs
Season 1 and A's definitely have a good balance between sides winning
It's just he good guys are a in the dark a lot throughout the series, so it may seem skewed in favour of the antagonists
I mean one of the (I've forgotten the names but you know the meme minis that come with the sympho blurays) *totally canonically* ascribes Chris's fighting style to Equilibrium so
And the last part of that was just Britishisms
Dw scrmz told me
*actual question what's the T-word when it's at home*
They died 65 million years ago
You don't need to be afraid of T-rexes guys
....t-word?
It has like ~440 entries on ff.net, and it's been around since 2004
Nanoha ff in general is sparse, wolf
Vivid manga is like 1 chapter from translation completion <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
It is possible to watch it first but you get so much more if you know who the fuck Einhart is
Mainly about side characters tbf
I mean if you do you'll be very confused
I have used nyaa on occasion, such as when I am without internet
I mostly stream off masterani tbh
I should too tbh
nightu
Fuck off bitch you do nothing
plus it blocks adblock users
awful layout and shitty practices
Yeah but fuck kiss
Ah, thought so]
SB?
Uh... this the Dark Materials Trilogy you're talking about r Reflection/Detonation? Because the latter aren't adaptations
Not impossibly they were referencing that, given the Team Dark Materials only turns up as a name in a card game spinoff
My body is fucking ready for more Team Dark Materials
By vivid? ~25 IIRC
It was me telling him to stop being a penis which did it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
thank god we didn't add tress on the end. that would be awkward
Get a hold of yourself lady
Sleep is for the weak indeed
but then I read the really shit ones and anger blinds me
I wish I wasn't so harsh on fanfic sometimes
KonoSuBA!
hahaha having a crush on fictional characters
~~conveniently forgets Velma from Scooby Doo~~
Arguably, pivot points, but then again there are simpler solutions
And Vivid 4 years after that
StrikerS takes place 10 years after S1 & A's
Ah no, mb, 23
Really, the only problem with this is lack of ZENBUs
Remember Remember, the... 21st of September?
Pretty Fly is legitimately the best
I mean must of them are actually mediocre

cost me nothing
I got access to botes yesterday
Are you still jealous of my title?
ah, hello there Chris
Anyway, Wolf, you can add me on War Thunder, my IGN is just Breads_Labyrinth (And my squadron is -Rou-, if you need that to determine anything)
Stop that, I'm the one who makes dad jokes.

~~Besides, that would be Hi awake now~~

A NICE ROUND NUMBER
YES
This is the third arena run trying to fix this gold issue
fugg
Ibu help, I just want the 5 gold but I keep winning
... ain't that pop's?
lewd
Shirabe
Unsurprisingly, I won that game
fucking hate it, but I hate that 5 gold more
<@284390402210136064> hmmmmm
*Looks at T6 British, T5 American, Russian and French, and T4 German and Japanese tanks*
Yeah I get bored too
Eh, only took me like 3 weeks to get to t4 French, and that wasn't no-lifeing it and before the T1 French buff
seriously the Lorr 40t is a goddamn murder machine
French tanks are best once you reach t4
boar and Malygoose probably next HoF
so shit yet so memey
Ah, Emeriss hunter
because it enables so much shit that breaks the game
It's been described as the most annoying card by everyone at Team 5
It's always boar's fault
lul
It's trash unless you're very good at the game
It has a ~27.7% global WR
in which case dat APM
It's awful unless you're korean
but I'm not going to, I want to keep my golden Deck of Wonders even though I'll never use deck of wonders
I have several extras I could dust
Yeah I have janky mech hunter anyway
I only have 5.4k
but still that's 7000 Dust
Infact I have
if I wanted to craft every deck currently in my My Decks list, I would need 8800 dust, though that is including a Flark Hunter which I'll probably ignore
hmmm
Only cards I'm missing from Even Mecha'thun Warlock are 1x bloodboom and Mecha'thun
I mean I have played since preNaxx (though with huge gaps, missed blackrock thru ungoro
Had to craft Savannah Highmanes and Wild Pyros IIRC
It's weird, I actually don't have a ton of the good classic rares
Nope, never had Auctioneers
Was looking for a decklsit
How the fuck am I still missing Gadgetzan Auctioneers?
I'm also missing 1 copy of Branching Paths, and two Gadgetzan Auctioneers
huh, I lie
I don't think Mecha'thun is gonna be that good in the end, but he is hilarious
Only one I need is Mecha'thun
not crafting anything for a couple weeks at least
same
I have Floop
If Maly Druid is really strong later on, I may craft maly
If I throw together my own mech/dr aggro hunter, is it considered playing a jank deck or preying on jank decks? ü§î
Early expansion aggro is always good
it was odd hunter in Witchwood
happens every expansion
Odd Pally and Healzoo are just preying on jank decks right now
Mecha'thun looks really fun
Just fling something together with what you have, it's what I've done
eh fook it, it's supposed to be a *game*, right?
Classic still has the largest amount of legendaries of any set
pity timer but no guaranteed in 10 plus free on logins like we get now
oh wait that's like 75% of the decks I was looking at lol
that looks fun
except maybe Mecha'thun
let's not
hmmmm
I could craft everything if I dust some spare goldens
could throw it in instead of Arcane Tyrant to save some dust
yeah I do
I think I have 1 copy
some don't
Some decks include it
and therefore always standard
so most of them were classic
(no guaranteed's back then)
and I never got any legendaries in GVG
but most of my legendaries weren't wild because I only started playing again in KOFT
I mean I've done it in the past
If you ever feel like playing wild I wouldn't
That one I put a pic of is basically identical but swaps Glorious Goop and Giggling inventor with two Biology projects
(Previous pic cut off UIs

wait that's Mecha'thun one moment
Can't copy the code if it's incomplete
hang on the one I saw earlier was cheaper than either
really? It had a lot less legends in it, didn't it?
Mecha'tun is so tempting tho
Nice job R
At first I thought there was a bit of anti-synergy going on there, but actually it's not nearly as bad as theorycrafting would imply
maybe I did <:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
Basically
kek
Disguised toasts website, metabomb, etc
just google them
both are apparently #1 Legend on consecutive days
this second one looks cheaper
AAECAZICCPX8ArQDxQTCzgKZ0wLi+AKb6ALF/QILh84CoM0CX9vTAkCe0gK/ 8gLkCOkBmNIC0wMA
Or
AAECAZICCPX8Aoz7Ap3iApnTAsLOAsUEtAP+AQvk+wLb0wKe0gKY0gKHzgKg zQLkCNMD6QFfQAA=
One moment
they don't Jade Golem
yup
Infinity bik elephants
Dire Frenzy Elekk Hunter
Elekk decks
Egg Paladin
So tempting
By mecha'thun, equality, hammer of wrath
You Prismatic lense so Mecha'thun costs one, geist everything, play the other lens, then you OTK
YES Paladin shall live again
Do I
That card is so good
Might take them out and stick in Spreading Plague
other than that it's kind of useless
but the spell is only useful for auctioneer turns
It has floop too
tbh I'm tempted to swap it for another swipe
took me a couple of tries against lucky aggro decks unfortunately
yeah I packed it
should have coined out the piper in hand to draw the piper in deck, but I coined out the lens instead and got a 1 mana piper
I had two
I nearly had it on the first time but I forgot if I had 1 or 2 Witchwood pipers
Still haven't gotten the Paladin version to work yet
I pity this fool
ah yeah stalagg fuegen
adventures had like 5 total
Adventures don't
Classic has a larger number, but every expansion has the same number
MFW I have Nozdormu
I'll borrow ibus deck
wait I have an idea
it's on my discord profile
Fuck how many legendaries do I have
I'm your friend, right?
hey ibu
Living Roots is TGT IIRC
true
*rants angrily*
Fuck Freeze mage, un interactive bullshit
ouch
They use them to test the games#
Dev station is the dev machines IIRC
Birthday party!
You poor soul
Rip
Pls donate gold
Oh is it brawlaseum this week?
