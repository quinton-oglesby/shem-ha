Call it Zabasob instead of Kirika sob
Hum, it seems that you are right
<:ShemHaEvil:642229421062750208> <:ShemHaSmile:688429721758990545> were already a bit too close. I think we can swap one

One episode a week would be a long rewatch. I like r/anime format : 1 episode a day and at the end of the season one day pause/overall season discussion.

Yeah, more bot spam/scam and more work for the mods !
And when you are talking about an anime adaptation sometimes you can start talking about the source material. Should you move the to the book chan until you start talking about the anime again ?
just like manga

Most LN are discussed about in anime too

But it's spread everywhere
There are several events translated by different people on YouTube, someone recorded every global translated events. Ytt has an online player some events too
MODEROID Dynazenon
I got it from goodsmile online shop
314 parts latter they are done. Now which combination should I try...
4 dynazenon BD box + Dyna moderoid was plenty already 😄
I don't have them
Carol without Micha avalaible
she's been killed already !
yeah
I open invit to everyone
Leiur dead, Phara less then half HP if you want to get some damage.

<@!368681228741640193> raid are WAY TOO LONG with 5cp
5points, here i go
It's open
Soon available, the slap fight take a while. I really feel like I have better result on this raid using 10 points instead 2*5, autoscorer die faster which means less cc and less damage taken which means more damage on carol
i'm letting you kill it.
ok
Pretty sure I could kill it if you want
the last one is almost dead I think
So much poison and cc... Come get some damage
Looks like auto skill with only 5cp could kill autoscorer but not much sorry
Nice random screen shot of Tsubasa
Your autoscorer still have a lot of life :( see you in 15min
OK, kill the auto scorer and I can kill  your Carol with only 5 points if needed
Using 10 points before going to work help too
Last units is lvl70 ignite jii
Used 10 points before shower. Have fun if you want to deal some damage
XD jii + heal memoria heal more than 4K damage at once it's great
great PVP stun
5stars
burnbasa died "fast" and most damage were done with my 3 5*
last units is welfare Kanaded

First time trying this boss, almost killed her with 5cp. I'll open the kill in around 10min if there are people interested.
And other rare materials that you can't have too much of.
Red Carol also provides some giga power crystals.
Magic Carol avaliable. Garie is still alive
2 * 5CP feel harder than 1 * 10 on her.
just after my lucky raid in XDU I got my second thunderfury link in wow classic. Today is a great day
I'm farming some materials before i realy need them
time to farm some magic raid 😄
holly shit ❤️
mean that we have to do a genocide ?
do you
just farm carol !
use all the differents stamina on CD !
or did all of this came from carol ?
I know power raid is fun and easy but you don't have to farm it that much
holy shit
Who really need small one? I have way too many of them
more grind
please no
so many useless rainbow
now I just need 5 more magog
11giga rage cristal !
it goes down fast
10 attacks
First hard raid cleaned with only 5 cp!
yeah that's whale 😄
at which point do you leave the 🐬 club to become a full fledged 🐳 ?
nice
or just stun XD jii and watch the poison slowly kill your units 😢
don't bully carol !
Raid rage open for the kill
I didn't know that she was so great when I rolled her. Biki is just the best girls and deserved to get my first LU to 70
snipe it 😄
use a rice !
but i'll need to farm bony and thech now. they are not fun 😦
keep farming and luck will be yours !
❤️
just killed her sorry 😄
working on him
burn => Tsubasa heal => burn => tsubasa dead 😦

currently in a body, it'll take while it seems 😦
die soon, get your hit
several people can get it if they started at the same time
hunt is seeing the boss die on your screen
if you see one, do it !
sometimes you can get a hunt
There are five categories of rewards for each boss:
Discovery Reward - reward given for starting the fight (only given for your own bosses).
Participation Reward - reward given for damaging the boss at all.
Killing Blow Reward - reward given for reducing the boss’ HP to 0 on your screen.
Big Damage Reward - reward given for being one of the top 3 damage-dealers to the boss.
Contribution Reward - Tiered reward given for dealing 3%, 5%, or 10% of the boss’ total HP.
The best chance for high-tier rewards come from a, c, and d. It is still possible to receive high-tier rewards from b and e, however.
yes, try to snipe low HP boss
Nobody like yellow boss
you can also spam rice to lower your own boss HP so people will join and kill it
It's what I did for my first units
It will go down soon.
nooooooooooo
Spent 10 CP, come poke him !
only 1 body giga cristal for me 😦
<@!368681228741640193> are you joining all my raids ? 😄

I hate it when Carol spam burn my lvl70 XD bikki who end up dying before my lvl54 Eren/bikki 😦
softened carol avalaible. garie is mid lif but I don't think she will live long in this state.
yeah, but she is with 2 blue autoscorer who destroye burnbasa
Kill him, I'm sure he will loot more useless rainbow cristal instead of body.
people must have been realy slow to kill her then 😄
There was 1 guy who did damage
I paused the fight after going inside for 5min but it looks like someone didn't wait 😄
Raid is open, come get the hunt bonus
Changed my team a bit and I can solo it with 5 CP. I'll open the hunt bonus to any one in around 20min
I'm opening it, both autoscorer are dead. You should be able to deal nice damage or even kill her.
if you want some mat to LU your Miku
i'll be going to bed soon
don't have stamina anymore sorry 😄
Micha is dead, she will die soon.
can't find it and you have maxed followers
I'm think he will go down soon
when a Body boss start to lose some health EVERYONE join
I just used my CP to push my own pink raid sorry
only damage to carol are important for reward. And garie will still love some life thanks to stupid targeting and aoe
Garie is often alive at the end of red carol.

someone sniped it.
I know, and they are all active
i'll wait 10min and check info
did someone already killed it ?
I opened it yeah
paused
Let's go everyone
I just reach 3CP. I can open it if you are ready
I don't have H units
even with 10CP I can't dore more than 500K damage on this one...
Green Carol is useless without autoscorer so it's fine
She will kill autoscorer fast but won't do much to Carol
happy
It's my first time killing her with 5CP. I'm pretty happu
all my followers are
I don't want to delete people who are stil active.
I don't have follower but I open to everyone
or a bit more if you need to wait for stamina
Opening it in ~15/20min
I'm preparing a new miracle. how much HP should I left her so you can kill it ?

rage raid is "easy" and loot some.
rage boss is so easy that he doesn't realy matter 😄
you have to run some pink and yellow too sadly
this way you will be future proof
just spam both carol untill you have 45+ giga of each
I was just telling people it's avalaible if they need one.
don(t worry i'll kill it and I don't realy need mat.
i'll be slowly chipping it tonight if you need some tech mat.
I'm opening it, first autoscorer is dead and she will go down.

Garie is still alive
I'm opening it.
It was open to anyone I think

You are not suppose to solo them unless you don't event need the mat anymore
who need free roll ?
Shouldn't you keep this discussion on this channel ? <#673253184885489696>
And nobody had lvl70 when I first farmed mine 😦
We all had to do this

Basa banner

XD need miracle, Ignite need magic
you will need them sooner or later
And we are all whaling !
Nobody use emu either
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
IF you want some B it should die soon.
From Pokelabo
I'm preparing a miracle raid (Big Carol). does anyone need it or I just kill her ?
what are you talking about, it's 13h30
song are always on
but first max Hajimari no babel
golden onigiri is the answer to all your problem
Or will I have to wait for him to die slowly ?
U4m trying the D boss for fun with 5CP but I didn't check first that he takes less damage from Physical. Does his damage increase over time ?
so better
Green carol may be a little harder but I can still kill her with 5CP if i'm lucky and she gives more than green mat
I neverd did the green boss, I farmed all my green mat on carol
but I can leave her with 10k hp if people need mat on her
I always need more mat
I'm preparing a Miracle raid (big green Carol) Should I kill her or any one need the kill?

Yeah, only 5* get a real boost when reaching lvl70
5* or 4* ?
No death in both case
same team is killing Green Carol is 35 turns.
I'll screen my team stats at the end of my other raid
physcal attack on him sucks. But I don't have red special attack other than XD Jii
way too long
87 turns to kill a full life green boss with only 5CP.
someone need a kill on it ?
My green boss i'll die soon
Good thing that pvp streak last 1 hour
I'm doing fine right now.
And you will soon have too much of them
Too bad Giga rainbow are worthless since every boss loot them
rainbow garbage
And there is no such thing as too many giga mat
You can farm normal raid if you want normal mat 😄
this game is stupid
I did a better score this time with only 5 CP
10 CP. I can actualy deal damage to yellow boss now !
So he is dead it seems.
I didn't kill him in my raid but other people hit it.
EZ
red team vs yellow boss ftw
using boss weakness is overated.
If you want tech mat it will die soon.
a lot of grind
How many rainbow ? To much to ever use them all
i'll open some place after the raid

There are 3 anime I had problem with VLC : Zoku owarimonogatari with mirrored sub (fixed bug), Yuki Yunna is a hero where they were rewritting the whole phone interface when they text each other and Madoka Fancut who mix TV/BD/movie in the file with a .bat scrit to chose your version
I molsty use VLC but I had to open a bug for Zoku Owarimonogatari with mirrored sub, same for the fan edit of Madoka Magica
VLC is not the best with sub heavy files.

In a famous (and cursed) Girls und Panzer doujin they used this weapon
In the picture with the tank, Yukari (the girl) is holding a Panzerfaust, the German first version of the RPG.
This GuP images. They used Panzerfaust against the German school, not versus Pravda according to the DJ
It's red, live in water and has claw
Close enough
Your hamster stand no chance versus this crab https://i.redd.it/jofzx3fg6s251.png
I think a crab should win when fighting a hamster
I won't use it I said but it still feel wrong. and i'm stopping the debate
It would be like calling every people south of the USA/mexican border mexican while there are tons of different cultures/contries
In France we have 3 differents kind of romani people Gitan/manouches/rom with differents culture and language (close language but still different). Using the same word to group them would be wrong (Again in France)
> and the UK according to wiki
I learned that in the USA it may be a slur but in France (and the UK according to wiki)  it's still use by everyone even the people designated by this word
but banning this word feel realy weird to me
I won't use it on this server don't worry
This is why I didn't delete it from my quote
Even in the UK it's not realy considered as a slur according to wikipedia english ...
> French gitan, English gypsy, gipsy /ˈdʒɪpsiː/, Irish giofóg, Spanish/Catalan/Italian/Portuguese gitano, Basque ijito, Turkish çingene, all from Greek Αἰγύπτιος Aigýptios "Egyptian" (corrupted form: Γύφτος Gýftos), and Hungarian fáraónépe from Greek φαραώ pharaó "pharaoh" – referring to their allegedly Egyptian provenance.[77] Usage of "gypsy" and similarly derived words differs between groups as some Roma groups use this word as a self-identifier, especially in the United Kingdom,[83][84][85] while others, especially in the United States, consider this word a racial slur.[68]
not all romani are gipsy
gipsy = gitan, a sub culture from within the rom/tzigane group
then I won't have translation in english for a french word
It may be used as a slur in the USA but in France/Spain it's not
Lily, sorry but Gipsy is the direct translation of Gitan and it's a distinct sub groups from the romani people (at least according to the french wikipedia page). There are racism against them yes but this word is not a slur

Before Covid how many months have you been without one ?
And even without gouvernement for months the country still work somehow
Ask Belgium
I'm not from the UK this is why I followed wikipedia source to UK association of romani people defining themself as gipsy
Did you read what I linked ? 😦 People in the UK (so speaking english) are also using the word Gispy to define themself ... This word may be a slur in the **USA** but even in the rest of the english speaking worlds it's not always the case.
In Symphogear XDU context there are some units who have been called Gipsy because of the event where they gained this gear and how this gear looks. I don't speak japanese and didn't play this event but it looked liked it was called like this in this server for quite some times, before I even played XDU. Google TL of the source tweet say : 
> Arabian type gear, Chris Yukine 
Which I think is better terms since she looks like a princess/dancer from One Thousand and One Nights.

On a more global scale, what word could I use in english to differentiate those Romani people culture ?

Ok, rant is over I'm realy going to sleep and I'll check the answer tomorrow morning.
I should learn to let go arguments on the internet instead of sleeping <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>  But I tried to find some english sources/exemple

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gipsy_Kings A French band of gitanos (Spanish Romani peoples) calling themself Gipsy

UK groups trying to protect their differents cultures Gypsies, Travellers and Roma :
https://travellermovement.org.uk/about/gypsy-roma-traveller-history-and-culture
https://www.gypsy-traveller.org/our-vision-for-change/our-history/
http://www.londongypsiesandtravellers.org.uk/why-were-needed/

I don't deny the fact that racism exist against those peoples. Romani people are facing a lot of racism in every european countries where they live.
But using only the word Romani is masking all the differents subcultures, differents languages (close but different), traditions and struggles. Some are nomadic, some are sedentary for exemple. A gitan/gispy from Spain is not the same as a rom from Hungary or a roma from the UK.
Using only the word Romani would be like only using the word hispanic/latino for people from Central/South America while some of them have been USA citizens for generation, Mexican from Mexico, from Guatemala, Honduras... All those people may have different cultures and deserved to not be treated as the same big group just because they are speaking Spanish. Some even consider Brazilian as hispanic while not speaking spanish and Latino isn't a good term either to me because it would means that French and Italian would be latino too since our languages come from Latin. 
Not everyone (even if they have the same ancestry) has the same culture/struggles/history and we shouldn't put people in convenient box making them easier to classifyn we should acknowledge those difference.

It was a character designer
It was not nana
Want more Nana Singing, yuri, mecha fun story ? https://myanimelist.net/anime/25731/Cross_Ange__Tenshi_to_Ryuu_no_Rondo Just read the only review on MAL that mater (the first one)

Remember : Fuck Kadokawa
But It was the first time my town was cited in an anime
I dropped S3 quite early because it was a mess

And she will soon learn that she is one of them
she says "norma"
It's not so bad as long as you don't watch the OAV
Can't guess either. But looks at those fight from Kaleid : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etazxSo1TzQ
Fate Kaleid is unironicaly one of the best fate anime
You still need to watch Nanoha and Fate Kaleid then
Didn't watch Magica girls anime as a child (I didn't watch a lot of TV show). My first real magica girl was Kill la Kill
Torrent FTW !
It's closer to Tokusatsu

You missed the annual r/anime rewatch which ended today with Rebellion
watch the 12 episodes serie or the fan cut which use some animation from the movie in the normal episode

Don't forget to seed !
Best option is still torrent
Moar thunderbolt fantasy ❤️

mission accomplished I guess 😄
Well, the show was good enough for me to buy the BD
Objectively better
Touma with a possible yuri ending
Gup, chihayafuru, Keijo!!!!!!!...
Sport anime can also have cute girls.
The best site to follow who does what is https://anidb.net/creator/59 I think
MAL database is not the best for those kind of things

yeah

I'm trying to find an edit of HF second movie sex scene where they switched Sakura with Assassin.

Naming is way funnier in Gate, the Romans side are named after cocktails.
2 most succesfull ? Wikipedia Disagree 😄 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_manga
Symphogear is over the top but the writter are not forgeting character. Index/railgun defines the abilities early and find new way to use them better
even if now Berserk is just loli saying Kyaa
There are nice DJ between crab and monkey
Yeah, watching shinobu speak to koyomi during nise when kizu was not avaliable felt strange. You had no idea what they were talking about
Her morning jog is a marathon and she sprint all the way
And they practice martial art meant to kill
She is the strongest disciple at her dojo
https://i.imgur.com/XD9rxlu.jpg
Just shaft being shaft
Kizu was released way too late because of production issues
And I hope you didn't forget to watch bake episodes 13 to 15. Some sites don't have them
Watch kizu before nise!

all according to keikaku
Since I torrent everything
Well, when I buy Blue ray it's only for collection sake/support the authors
Soon the PS2 will be too
The first playstation is already retro.

it's Shiro**U**
Shiro = best little sister
different studio so we don't know if it will be the same as the previous seasons
pre animated so visual may not reflect the actual anime
what is there to talk about ?
manga and anime are on a hiatus
Kirino as Waifu ? Kuroneko as B+ ? <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
open in browser and zoom
Discount Senjougahara as Waifu and the real Senjougahara as A+ ? <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
It looks like Overlord artstyle
Maybe

Papi ?!
Jibril and Ilya ?!
Yeah, and it stil rage on
Nezuko isnot a character and Maybe he doesn't like tsundere
tame fetish compared to monster musume
I liked the ED, the mother was a great supportive mom.
It was realy fun, but the ending is the standard "Fuck you buy the book"
We know they || hold hand || already, is a kiss realy necessary ?
Jii is a great girl, but there are better girls in this show
It has some yuri but it's far from being the main focus
Sailor moon even before I've heard
New Game!
I prefer reading it too. Otherwise i'll start doing something else
it's just a SoL
Blend S is not CGDCT, too many men
CGDCT is just way too large of a genre. It could be relaxing camping like Yuru Camp, going to antartica like Sora yori or Girls und Panzer 😄
|| And teens may not fully accept the killing of their child if they don't have cantus since they still don't know about their world. They don't have human right untill they are adult||
||During their teens they are forced to be homosexual, not when they are childrend or adult. There are regular virginity check on the girls to prevent pregnancy. (I can"t remember if it's as clear in the anime as in the book). Pregnancy could had too much stress on teens whose power are still not fully matured ||
|| They are encouraged to practice homosexual sex during highschool to prevent pregnancy while still releasing sexual stress this is why Mari and Saki were together in their teens ||
|| Maria love Saki but Saki only love Shun ||
|| Squealer did nothing wrong ||
yes
|| And only one of the girl is in love with the other one ||
MHA anime peaked during the tournament arch.
but you don't realy read it for the story
I still like the manga
OPM S1 animation was awesome
mostly seinen I would say
just like kaguya love is war is a seinen
it's a shonen
published i na shonen magazine
It's a CGDCT shonen 😄
Did you watch Aria ?
There are not enough DJ of Ekaterina from Qwaser 😦
If we had more female heroine and less bland self insert it would already be a huge step in the right direction
but latest Overlord volume are as big as regular novel but still considered ln
plan to watch
Saw it in theater. For once there was an anime film in my cities.
And it's awesome
you have to be able to stay focussed during a 40 min episode of 2 characters speaking in a classroom about a math test
Monogatari is not for everybody yeah
never heard of this Oo
you mean 480p ? I remember watching bleach like that when I was younger
streaming with a bad connection means that you are watching 240p ? 😄
that's what I do when i'm going on holiday to my grandparents house.
torrent during your sleep, watch during the day
> imagine not torrenting your anime
I need money to spend on anime
XDU alone is not a probleme. It's having to work while farming on XDU
Cross Ange
animated hentai are trash
read DJ
denial
read more hentai with the tag || Public use and/or body writting || to see how they use it
Each time you had a stroke
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A3#/media/File:%E6%AD%A3-order.gif
they draw this character
we draw 4 stick and and 5th crossing over
This is how they count to 5
正 found the right character
I know how it works thanks to DJ but it's fun to see so much effort for something so small
to whatever in japan
~~IIII~~ in the west
from japanese to western
they changed the notation
They changed the score on the board

This typesetting.
but 40 45-55min doesn't realy count has a movie for me
Das final was shown in theater
OVA are supposed to be realased has VHS/dvd/BD first
https://www.reddit.com/r/GIRLSundPANZER/comments/fb5oci/spoiler_a_worthy_montage_to_rival_the_one_in_der/ Das final part 2 was awesome (this link doesn't realy spoil anything)
I was wrong only the first time !
> Original video animation (Japanese: オリジナル・ビデオ・アニメーション, Hepburn: Orijinaru bideo animēshon), abbreviated as OVA (オーブイエー / オーヴィーエー / オヴァ, ōbuiē, ōvīē or ova) and sometimes as OAV
yeah 😄
OAV
2 years between each AOV now <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
what kind of fucked up not standard is it
Yeah, not suspicious at all
hey, that's how I learned about it !
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/608/351/c93.gif It has always been the case.
thatsthejoke.jpg
Crazy what pixelation on bread do
she doesn't care about what's right
Ange is not a good guy
|| And the total institutionnalized racism and everyone was fine with it ||
|| Well, the littl sister was healed for years so yeah it was her fault for keeping the wheelchair ||
Episode 1 had || Annal cavity search || so yeah there were some fucked up shit
I stopped the conversation there
Someone even told me that madoka was an anime for pedo because the girls were 14 years old ...
don"t ask me, that's some comment i've read
Some people call madoka or Fate Zero edge fest but I like it 😄
for exemple Magical Girl Raising Project tried way to hard to be edgy and the result was meh
edge for the sake of being edgy is bad yes
good edge no
Cross Ange also had the best cross over episode
There are some good track in the ost too. Like : Villkiss ~Kakusei~
And we got more good nana song
I loved it
I did too, that's just the start of the review
> Cross Ange is a travesty. It's a horrible, stupid, illogical trainwreck of a show with shoddy production values that relies almost entirely on pandering to the lowest forms of human life and waving shallow moments of shock value all over the screen. The series has a narcissistic sense of self-awareness, and in each episode you can nearly hear a subtle narration by the director and other Sunrise execs laughing at how much of a moron you are for watching this garbage that they've put in front of you.
> 
> "Ha, I bet those glass-eyed imbeciles are getting bored, let's put in another lesbian threesome."
> 
> "No, not yet. Only after we show the loli whipping someone again."
Don't forget that ||Ealier the little sister planned to have her executed and called for her help to trap her. Then wipped her in front of a crowd ||
This one is the only one in MAL that I accept as a real review.
|| Well, racism was so normal and part of their society that she even started to hate her own daughter ||
The only good MAL anime review is the first Cross Ange Review. And it's a perfect decripsion of the show
then S3 happened
I liked it
jitsu wa watashi wa  is way above all the other 😦
I'm sad that the best harem/romcom manga didn't get a good anime adaptation
Looks like you didn't watch Madoka rebelion
why would it feel wrong  ? You liked it so rate it high
yes
way easier
just rate your enjoyment or don't rate it at all
Ever heard of https://themes.moe ?
I like every Symphogear Season fight me
than the classic shonen FMAB ending
FMA 2003 ending is better
and yuri
Biggest issue with FMA is the lack of cute girls
nothing is
It's a good anime, way above average but i's not perfect.
When they don't want your money just pirate
I check my BD, it's a French edition. There should be an english edition somewhere
https://because.moe/?q=madoka try netflix
this is why I hate legal streaming
Strange, last years it was on amazon prime in France but not anymore
I have the BD yeah
or buy the BD 😄
🏴‍☠️
Most of them were working for Gainax (TTGL) before they left to create Trigger
But I prefer KLK yeah
Gridman was great
dess
fist!
with bullshit quantum physic explanation
the scientist
then there is the clever girl with big boobs who know everything
they looked like each other a bit and fill the role of the tsundere girl firend
Violet is a beautifull but boring show
Mother was the least boring Violet episode
YOur opinion is wrong
> Bunny girl senpai is bakemonogatari but much better
but Trigger only workd on the first half
And when A1 and trigger worked together we had DitF
GJM is late on translating Bookworm 😦
|| Eren Using the jaw titan to crush the cristal to eat the juice ||
|| The death of the hammer titan ||
Or just a confirmation that they didn't forget the anime
I want a date for Kumo desu ga 😦
not me
We talked of taiwainese pupet show here so we can talked cartoons yeah
in this office building, they have at least one other building in Kyoto I think
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ceu2ns/kyoto_animation_fire_megathread/
But they lost some key personnel and some ressources that will be hard to replace
They were back to work pretty fast on the other building.
like in Weathering with you credit I linked there were a lot of vietnamese name.
And they often subcontract to southest asia too
https://anidb.net/anime/14534  Software assitance : Google earth lol
"only" 1/3 of it burned down
you need to find a studio not already overworked
I saw trigger getting credit in theater after watching made in abyss movie. Every one works/help everyone in the industry.
r/berserklejerk/ is the best version of Berserk fanbase
This is Japan, why would they stop a series instead of milking it as much as possible ?
you should watch Kizumonogatari instead
Didn't watch it
Princess Principal movie is not avalaible yet I am wrong ?
it's awesome
It's TTGL/KLK with awesome movie animation
I dropped the show after 24 episodes
there are tons of them on r/anime
way better than the normal sub
Don't limit yourself to gay shit ? 😄
And to make her cry a little more after the serie : ||https://i.imgur.com/SeQLGq8.jpg ||
Contract ?
Which is why Fate Kaleid is one of the best fate
That's Kaleid Spin off
even if her "love" is a bit twisted
And Iliya in all route too right ?
That count in my book
He has Saber, Rin, Sakura, Iliya
Shirou has the skill Harem Protagonist SS. She didn't have chance
And now they are a gettin 1B$ a year
Hinata father had planned everything for his daughter to marry Naruto
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/860/819/9e5.png
didn't watch/read it
being a married man is expensive
She deserved it. They went on their honeymoon after he finished Naruto, years after their wedding.
he just listened to his wife
I think it was his wife ship
<:meguJoy:358116714468212736>
They translated a side story already
Looks like you are right
I stopped when || they were in front of the demonlord castle and Kazuma offered an enourmous amount of mana gems for Megumin to spam explosion ||
They released an other one ?
I liked Darker than black, but I watched years ago so I don't remember much of it.
Konosuba last volume spoiler || Kazuma class is adventurer, the weakest but the fastest to level up. In the previous volume he had his level reset to 1 and found out that he can just keep leveling and reseting his level to farm skill point easily. So Vanir and Wiz bring him to the highest level dongeon to power level him ||
|| Kuroneko deserved to win! And fuck you editor that didn't let the author go full incest so the ending is even more stupid ||
When I see shit like this I pity the poor animators that had to deliver something like this with a shitty deadline/pay 😦
The author wanted the incest ending. The editor told him no way
And how best girl was shafted
Talking shit of the ending
His art is awesome but the content is <:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
Like this :
with some extrem works.
A hentai artist
Too bad the associated anime was pure trash
even if it didn't looked like the real town
Index 3 only redeeming factor is that they came to where I live 😄
<@!160142617940590594> https://symphogear.fandom.com/wiki/Itsuka_no_Niji%2C_Hana_no_Omoide#English never heard this one ?
and OAV ending
B side songs
What are you talking about, they are just good friend...
Does Bakemonogatari OP count ?  Hitagi End Spoiler || https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SwCnmUI8QI ||
Hum, maybe ? It has all the fan service possible
So much suffering
Well, Phos || Is almost human now and became a bloodthirsty warlord || She's still mostly a rock.
they count as rock
a great list
The legendary Yamada Tae
it's not the main focus
a little bit
|| Diebuster ending is gunbuster ending ||
Same universe, some thousands of years in the future
Diebuster is Darling in the Frank done right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFppdq6vEPg Buster Machine Nanaho best girl
robot and android can be waifu.
being anything in this manga is suffering
Being a Lunarian is suffering too
This show is one big buddhist allegory about hell and reincarnation
This could happen in the show
it's jsut an average show who got popular
Even the author said that his use of rape was bad
it's just an average show
people hate sao because it's popular and some anime youtuber hate it.
If we start analyzing every shonen power fantasy self insert you won't sleep anymore 😄
at times
Precure too
One piece style
It's a long running show for little girls. There are some good fight but most of the time it's not supposed to be that good.
the JSDF propaganda didn't feel as bad as the US army propaganda in most hollywood movie as an european
They are from Gainax after all
Third impact version LWA

Instead of having 1 novel for all aincrad he is doing the whole story
https://medakabox.fandom.com/wiki/Najimi_Ajimu
Saitama is a joke Character written to be OP. Goku is like Superman, he is weak or strong for random reason depending on what the plot needs
Anime power ranking : That one OP character in Medaka box > Homura > Madoka > Everyone else.
This is wrong. Worst ending was Oreimo
https://streamable.com/i5ft6 Found it.
If you want true degeneracy you can watch the first 2 minutes of Imouto sae Ireba Ii
Didn't watch it.
Looks like I dropped it after ep10
Not-Madoka was awesome, the rest of the cast was meh
Most of the show was boring. Too bad I liked the premise.
just 3-4 ?
once not-madoka ||Died|| It was a snore fest
50% of the show is just meteora explaining what happen
Boring useless MC that could have fixed everything if he were to just open his mouth
I disagree
I dropped Re:Creator before we learned what she realy was
Original Run
May 2009 – May 2013
"old"
An old Manga written by the same author as Bakemonogatari
Typesetting this must have been hell
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXniX0zWkAMdkUp?format=jpg&name=medium
I linked her wikipage above
You can't beat her.
Bunny girl is just normie monogatari
Bunny girls as nothing like Buffy/X files Oo
Who doesn't?
I like them both too but I feel like KLK did everything better
KLK > TTGL fight me
I cried more watching girls last tour than violet Evergarden
Girls last tour maybe. The only downside the anime has it's that they will never adapt the last 2 volumes
It's awesome but I know it's not for everyone
S1 is ranked Higher than bakemonogatari and movie is ranked 46 on MAL ...
I just checked BGS ranking on MAL and while I know that MAL ranking are stupid it still made me sad <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
worse humor, less intersting cinematography, stupid explanation of the different problem ...
Watching bunny girl when you have been watching Bakemonogatari for years feel just like watching a downgraded version
|| We still don't know who is her children father right ? ||
so they named the studio ufotable
Ufotable is named this way because they couldn't think of a name but the CEO had a table in his living room looking like a UFO
Well, studio name are can be stupid
and one of the flcl remake.
kirito is a vegetable but still get all the girls
didn't check other show
Railgun should be back
SAO and re zero shouldn't be delayed anymore
now time to read mange from anime without real ending
Worse for me, I finished anime from last season too 😦
why bother designing 2 different side characters when you can design one ?
and it's anime logic
It was dark
same father
Still waiting for good sub for the last 4 episodes 😦
scroll up a bit
yes
next season now please
|| she know that it's the confession line but doesn't understand that it's real ||
Hamefura ❤️

https://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu
wrong order
legend of the galactic hero
then there is LOGTH who is supposed to be awesome but I didn't realy like it.
There is a sequel : diebuster
Gunbuster
this is why american genetation thinks are stupid 😄
that's a millenial show 😄
DBZ is from the 90's
boomer show would be 80's
pre 2010 is not boomer 😄
https://i.imgur.com/Npz7hR1.png
same author as Grand Blue
One of the best comedy show is Bakka to test
And that's enough to be better than most seasonals anime
I always say that SAO is an average story but great animation soundtrack.

ultimate boomer would be astroboy
Black lagoon was great
Narutaru anime ended before the end and Bokurano director didn't like the manga ending
Bokurano/narutaru are from the same author, better read the manga
that's how I would rate my show if i wanted to
too much wasted space
I don't like Anilist ui
I just use MAL to track them
I don't bother ranking my show.
p-chan was great
look at GRR Martin
he has money, of course he got lazier 😄
ok
There is a novel for Weathering with you ?
and A-1 have more good show than just SAO https://anidb.net/creator/1303

yeah
sasuga Kirito
childhood friend but he only speak with her for ~5 hours ?
Harem protagonist A+

New Youjo Senki LN avaliable! But I'll have to get the digital version <:Tanya_Annoyed:365769370590511107>
During S3 I watched some real match on YouTube and they are just as fast as the anime it's amazing
When I don't have to spam "Watch Symphogear" I switch to other show :D

https://youtu.be/zj7VMd8z8XA
Shojo with 3 24 episodes are rare enough to tell you how great it is
It's the best sport anime ever and it's about a kid card game working like memories
Watch Chihayafuru next
still a lot of people
Japanese studio and mismanaging licence is a classique
Like most adaptation the original version is better
|| Rachel is a scum but her whole story/motivation is overcoming fate and doing every thing she can to have a chance to shine/be the protagonist even without talent. Without the whole treason thing she could be a shonen main character ||
Time to re read Tower of God. anime ended and the webtoon is on a hiatus 😦
https://myanimelist.net/news/60083603 at long last a date for best spider anime!

A lot of things.

Houseki no Kuni : I miss old Phos 😦
I didn't read the WN but the LN is great
Until you burn her Web. Then it's a murderous spider
It's a cute spider
The manga is skipping half the story and is WAY behind
The novel is awesome.
Bitch, they created the archetype
> Asuka is a cliche tsundere and rei is a boring quiet girl
I'm not thinking this, this is the shit i've read
God, I hate writting this
Evangelion is now supposed to be an old elistist show full of cliché
> TTGL/Code Geass fan, I don't like mecha. I only love TTGL/Code Geass because it's not just about the mecha
the only eîsode that i realy liked was || The dying mother writting letter for her daughter after her death ||
Violet is a beautifull anime but it's so boring 😦

Muh second amendement !
Chainsaw man || Of course the USA is controlling the Gun Devil ||
I don't think there are official release in english
at least it's translated in France 😄
Volume 15 : 16 october <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I should check when the next volume will be avalaible
every side character in this show are awesome, even the one that you will only see 3 episodes
and great soundtack
and some shogi
you know what to do this weekend
I have 3 shaft anime in my top 5 : Madoka, Bakemonogatari, San gatsu no lion
Are you telling me that some people didn't watch every anime made by shaft in the last 10 years? <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
To me the best rom com manga is still Jitsu wa watashi wa
I don't know why but I stopped reading kaguya even before S1 was announced.
I'm on the side of : It's a great show that I liked. It had a lot of influence on the medium. It the result of Anno depression. I had to read tons of shit to understand most of the symbolism and this picture is still the best explanation : https://i.imgur.com/jagHqr2.jpg
American trying to put everyone in a little box feels so stupid to me
first stage : denial cocoa
it is
millenial is early 80's to late 90's if i understand this stupid term right
In index the teacher is a loli AND a chrismass cake
In anime terminology chrismass cake are unmaried women over 25
|| A rare chritmass cake getting married in manga ||
but hella fun with some nice feels along the way
cocoa ?
isn't cross ange their greatest anime ?

<a:cooldoge:681256202398728196>

To help you chose
Spin.moe
That's all. Over 10 years
The author did a break after S1 to do his military service, a 2 weeks break after s2, and now a health related break
And it's not the same kind of hiatus as berserk or hxh
It's on a hiatus but you have 400+ chapters to read
It was released years after S1, a few months before 0 so I don't think so
The movie/oav is not really needed and  happen after the rest
Steins hate, then S1 ep23 alternative version then Steins gate 0
You can now read it from the first chapter :D
https://youtu.be/SrX5kYg1Pwo after they burned a city to the ground
I loved Youjo Senki second ED for this
LN has an irregular schedule, the author is not a fast writer. I don't think it's worth much to finance an other anime to promote the source
because there is no S2
Great manga
<@226789636989517824>  I'm reading it
Great soundtrack and awesome animation/fight but the story was meh at best yeah
I may have missed most of the symbolism but still liked it
I liked this show
and a narator because they were not able to "show, don't tell"
it's filmed like a late 80's early 90's OAV
so it's not a " historical documentory" just like you said above right ?
the LN even more
it has way more historical reference than LOGH
want some war history watch Youjo Senki
it's not
People sold me a perfect hard SF politic show with great war strategy so I went in expecting this. I didn't get it. If people had sold me anything else I may have appreciate it.
10min out of 24 episodes
once refugee and the neutral planet
there was nothing showing that there may be a secondary plot at this point
even republic
protag are not that clever, their ennemies are just plain retard
like, are you all retarded ?
this arc made no sense || Let's listen this ex inconpetent general who was a POW last week to start a civil war. Then let's resolve this civil war in 2 weeks ||
the first movie was good, but the serie bored me. EP24 was the end of an arc so i dropped it there
a bit above 100
Yeah I don't watch 70+ episode hoping for something good to happen
It was the same level as game of throne season 5 for me
yeah
time makes no sense, everything happens at once
like REALY stupid
I got stupid antagonist
people sold me great story/politic/Strategy
Dropped it at ep24
Anime is good but stop early. We still don't know what's the last dragon power
I loved the manga ending. || mc-kun end up marrying tentacles girl ||

I can only find S1 and G
IF you find it for me I can try
Still cheaper than a non existent western alternativ
I bought Symphogear S1 and G box from Amazon Japan and the base price + delivery fee are above that
every side character are fucking stupid just so the MC can look clever
nice backstory
I dropped || After they came back from the dark wolrd, it feels like the story was going nowhere. || Could someone spoil me what happens next ?
2018 had zombie land saga, non non biyori movie, planet with, hisone to maso tan, hinamatsuri, Fate Kaleid movie ...
Imagine saying that Bunny is aoty when there was Zoku Owarimonogatari the same year 😄
> 2018 was bunny girl senpai. I can stop looking. That's anime of the year
That's some hot take 😄
Playstation 2 level of CGI
we got pure trash CGI
S3 fight was awesome/epic/great in LN, be it goblin fight near the village or Ainz versus the kingdom.
in the novel
I liked it too
and OPM S1 is hardly madhouse
they didn't drop it
not the anime badly adapted
not the  WN with rushed trash ending
Overlord real canon is the LN
Most of the time WN are draft and LN are huge improvement since they can redo early part and have an editor with them
they are draft
WN are not original source
in his not in the end the autor says that it's almost a real novel
close enough
Did you realy read the LN to say that ?
what ?
SOra Yori
magic high school battle genre is back ?
what is your favorite ice cream favor ?
It's easier for CR to be part of the production comitee for Koreann webtoon than existing japanese franchise I guess

https://youtu.be/mOPsIiE5ICw?t=55 look at this
just a better author who can create loophole
something that Oreimo couldn't achieve
True incest, related by blood but still ok to marry
It's OK || Their genomes has been modified so much that they can marry without a problem ! ||
<a:MiyukiBlush2:553804053444952065>
It's been so long since I've seen the anime and read the LN that I didn't think about it
she was in the movie too
Don't know who is it
sasuga oni-sama
He stopped a chinese invasion when he was around 10 years old.
He is even allowed to marry his sister. No other harem MC has this power
you can't top that

non, I like SSJ
Shénshòujìng 3 ?
Anyway, Fate Kaleid is the best fate. Next to carnival fantasm
Isn't the fan edit the recommended watch?
She was more interesting in zero
After ubw I read the vn first route since everyone is shitting on the 2006 adaptation and I still doesn't understand the love for saber
I've never watched fate 2006. I started with zero and it felt fine
Tiger dojo
then Taiga everytime
unless you do all the bad end !
taiga yeah
Rin, Shirou, Sakura, Shinji, 2 of their teacher ...
battle royal with high schooler fighting for a supposed super OP artifact
Kaleid is fun magica girls who become serious in the end
I prefer Zero. It feels more serious and less a Highschool magical battle anime
Once you accept the fact that BD are luxury item the price seems right.
> jokes are the deepest lore
just from different universe
And EVERY spin off is canon
the author has no idea how to handle power creep
solo leveling story gets REALY bad
seems easy
> I saved your life, love me now
at least Kirito waited more than a year to start dating his future wife
he was nice to them 2 weeks and they are madly in love with him
but the current 2 I don't understand either
the loli thief will 100% be part of his harem in the future
I still don't understand why Subaru get a pass on his harem and not Kirito
yes
maybe half the cast will stop being brain dead
Re Zero S2 is avalaible, it's supposed to get better let's see if it's true.
now I have a projector plugged to my PC and everything is easier
last time I tried to watch something on a smart TV it was during SAO S1 and it couldn't read soft sub
If you don't have 200$ chromebook/notebook you should be fine
yes
like half of the "smart" TV
but you need to have a better CPU/GPU and some player don't support it
with the right encode quality is the same with smaller files
get µtorrent v2.2.1 and it works fine without malware
<:GarieCute:255583678757863425>
Still not as bad as Jojo reference
I don't think so
Is character suffering enough to have a good story ?
https://rezero.fandom.com/wiki/Reinhard_van_Astrea
He is a poor man Okabe
that one guy with all blessing
literaly
While re:0 has a character who is perfect
to me they are the same level, jsut above average
I just don't understand why Re;Zero get pass and not SAO.
But I should stop trying to analyze novel aimed at 15 years old 😦
she sees  1 fight and thats enough to dispell all her doubt and fall in love. Perfect writting.
because he keeps on reseting the timeline and they only see the last one
they don't know he does all of that
they don"t know he keeps on dying
they have no idea, so why would they fall for him ?
re zero girls don't know what he did for them
He just humiliated the girl he love in front of the court
Being anime only on Re:Zero I don't feel like Subaru did more.
they are both just as bad
yeah, but people trash him for that
kiritos did the exact same thing with half of his harem I think 😄
I was saying that Emilia was jealous of the loli (and it looks she's named petra yeah)
it's the same
last scene of director cut
like realy not in love ?
First scene of today episode she is jealous of the little gril who want to be with subaru
but anime focussed on the boring quiet girl who love the self insert no mater what
Ram and Beatrice looked way more fun.
perfect otaku fantasy
Emilia is the perfect quit girl who love the first nice guy she mets
Kiriro irl was just as much as a loser
Well, most polls on the Internet are full of mainstream/shonen. It doesn't really bother me
Shiny pokemon card were stronger when I was a kid! (we never learned the rules)
Like if you have problem in your relationship with your girlfriend paying an other girl to date you feel like the redest flag ever
Can't remember the exact name. After reading this I just dropped it so hard ...
maybe not as bad as though
oh ok
And his girlfriend is ok with it ?
I think I started to read the manga and dropped it after 2 or 3 chapter. Is it the manga where the MC ask his girl friend if he can pay an other girl to date her?
New member of kirito harem meeting his old friend <:LUL:662399439406759947>
Nisekoi ... I dropped it after an other  Ondera confession was dodged because of stupid reason
https://myanimelist.net/anime/season around 60 with contuniation and kid show 😄
I put them at the same level
If Re:Zero is considered a masterpiece by some people, then SAO is far from being pur trash
There are around 60 animes this season. And I still think that SAO without being a masterpiece is still better than 80% of them
but still better than 80% of the rest of seasonnal anime.
still meh
And there are a lot of black magic transfert. same technique as Fate mana transfert
yeah, total fantasy in japan
I don't think I've found something longer yet

I had caught up to real translation and next was trash machine translation
I should look check if the translation have improved since last time i checked
like they did to ToG 😦
they can still do a bad adaptation
healing good precure isn't anime ?
becauser Sazae-san isn't anime ?
https://mangadex.org/title/31488/isekai-ojisan one of the best isekai
An other isekai, which twist does this one have ?
it's written on it
it's a skeleton knight in another world

battle shools are so 00's
Still waiting for GJM do fix their laptop so they can finish the translation 😦

She was awesome.

Damn I can't believe I was baited to watch a noodle advertisement while watching an ONA ...

|| Let's wait and see. Looks like we will be following one rogue AI trying to fight the system to help a human. And said human will have to learn the truth about her world and her mentor ||
And I loved it
There is still a lot we don't know. And Fate Zero first episode was an exposition dump
yeah
sometime you get Madoka, sometimes you get Darling in the Franxx 😄
Same, but that's what I like about original anime. Nobody knows what will happens next
|| Human are still real, and Space alien playing the game are still collecting ressources they need too live on the monster ||
but I didn't know Pierrot was doing it too
I knew Gainax and UFOtable did that
I think Toie or pierrot has union and good working condition
They always had production/planning issues
Shaft never had good working conditions
They should have stayed at Shaft to work on the next Monogatari or 3-gatsu 😦
animation was awesome but the rest was average shonnen
same
3.0 is controversial
1.0 and 2.0 are awesome
after years of trial
I think anno finnaly has 100% of Eva right now
yeah, but they are a groupe of compagny hoarding IP/licence right mostly

Kemono friend ?
Which part? External?
It's just as pseudo mechanical as Evangelion
Or close enough
That's my definition
Attack on titan is a mecha anime
https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png it's been a long time since I felt this way
A show can use elements from differents genre without issue
Magica girls with mecha elements
Like you are allowed to like or dislike everything independently within a single genre
It's like mecha...
> it hate mecha but code geass and Evangelion get a pass because they are not just about mecha
<:LUL:662399439406759947>
>It's a dark drama
People are so insecure about liking magica girls...
God, r/anime thread about KLK being a magica girl show... Someone told me Madoka isn't a magica girl show because it's not a cute show for young girls...
Most of cgdct and sol are seinen
It's a seinen yes
Does twintails explore feminity?
They are mecha magica boys with some magica girls mixed in
It's not hard SF
Yeah. Star wars is just fantasy in space
Is grandbelm mecha? It's not sf
It is yeah
Car are mecha <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Initial D is a sport/mecha/drama anime
Anime can use several genre/sub genre and that's OK. What matter is do you like it?
Yeah, aot being mecha is some kind meme I use to tell people that they can like mecha too
External mechanic and used to have a bigger impact on the world
Then is 3d movement gears mecha?
To me genre don't need to check all the box. Any show can use elements from any genre without isdue
Then the titan walking on his 4 with gun on his back is the only mecha in aot? <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Keijo!!!!!!! Is awesome!
Same. It's Symphogear troll face
If someone act as an asshole then kick the guy. Don't delete the emote

Yed
He only wrote the first episode of gargantia
Thunderbolt fantasy gimmick was fun, but the story was bad
I liked his fate zero too
Imagine using your blueray. I buy some but I don't even have anything to read them :D
Most of us started as shonen fan trash the you evolve into cgdct fan trash
Read the manga and pray that they won't release more idolmaster game so the author keeps writing
The PlayStation 2 game had better cgi
The fight in front of the witch tree...
2017 was just as bad
Someone liked berserk 2017 <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Lotgh isn't even that good
Worst DJ out there are GuP
Watamote cringe hit too close to home. But kuro gets better in the manga (way past the anime)
With a yuri harem
Watamote has cute wholesome girls now
I watched old Disney movies. Does it count?
I liked Trigun, I liked Samurai Champloo. But bepop was boring
I don't like bepop either. Dropped it after 5ep
Like me with Clannad
Don't force people to watch anime they don't like. That's how you create haters
It is
Even the author acknowledge that there are too much of it and that he was inexperienced at the time and didn't really know how to make a bad guy hate able without it
not S2
You are allowed to like S1
btw I also have shit taste

The civil war was dragged for too long in the manga. Pacing was fixed in the anime
They can also join the ninja art club
At least the club advertisement was good https://streamable.com/f7wxi
My "they" was about the school/club not miho
If KLK is a magica girls show then gup is a sport anime
A new girl/guy join a school/club, they are bad but need to win the tournament to save their school/club. They train and thanks to the power of friendship and hype they win
S1 follows all the sport anime trope
Girls Und Panzer and Keijo are 2 other good sports anime
Chihayafuru is so great
cute fang are ok, flesh fang are stupid
I'm with you on this
Whatever, it's just a drawning so who cares ...
I'm not an expert but doesn't lolicon prefer small breast ? Huge boobs like this seems kinda the opposite

That's not a lot of sleep
100+ episodes and 3 movies?
no, Nanoha sentient demon ferrets is a cool guy
when in doubt, blame physic and Newton
If only Shaft stopped being a shitty studio for their animator and keep producing more Madoka/Bakemonogatari/3-gatsu no lion 😦
but i'm not a fan of it.
there is a theory || She told everything to Kyubei to help her trap/met Madoka ||
the last movie credit with the making of is great
Well, she wasn't at her best mentaly. She didn't even trust her memories anymore and needed to talk
Now that Urobuchi stopped playing with his taiwainese dolls maybe he can start working again on Madoka ? 😄
oh yeah, MAdoka and Sayaka. I misread it as if she || Separated Sakaya and Kyouko ||
|| There are no magica girls anymore. She is handling all the dark shit with kyubei ||
I don't think she did ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbzoJ98LeiA
tetris will never be the same
better than || Mami learning it and trying to kill everyone ||
And it helped Madoka to do an informed decision
At least they learned something new that day
this is why i've been waiting for the sequel since the concept movie 5 years ago
yeah
Well, did you click the link ?
I'm a proud member of https://www.reddit.com/r/thingshomuradidwrong/ She could have done some things better but being || A 14 years old girls seeing your friend die again and again for 10 years may have affected her sanity ||

|| MAdoka was not happy, she was souldering all magica girls suffering as a godess, Homura freed the human side of the godess to let her be happy. Even if it means becoming a demons. She was also OK with dying instead of letting Kyubei get his hands on Madoka ||
The concept movie realy is great to explain even more why Homura did this
If you read french 😄
we get to see so many great timeline
Homura Tamura is the best Madoka spin off
<:kyubeyidkmaybe:633803689278046237>

I like it <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:kek:691826979519070208>
right after the next Madoka movie !
When shaft get their shit together
<a:aworryHype:426063923553501194>
It's HAPPENING !
3-gatsu no lion manga spoiler
almost as good as Kill La Kill recap
great recap episode
yeah
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/i818uv/remember_good_sound_effects_are_important_saoa/
it's awesome
and Madoka recap movies allowed the creation of a fancut to increase S1 animation/art quality
Like Nanoha A
Some of those movies are good.
It's glorious
In nisemonogatari English LN Araragi and tsukuhi have a 30 pages long debate on underwear colour and if it means anything about hanekawa personality.
Could be worse
https://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Strip-S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9-Admin-password-finalenglish-3.jpg
like writting it on a paper under your keyboard
that's the password I think
At least 3-gatsu no lion is avalaible in France
and since S3 was pure shit i'll have to read
I should start reading the novel one day. I liked S1 and S2, I like all 3 seasons of railgun
tons of books + popular series. Why wouldn't it sells a lot ?
but I can assure you that my taste are trash
I know
did Japan learn got taste at least ?
Youjo Senki is higher than I though it would
peoples don't understand true culture
I have a Tail red figure.

Trying to do it for you
The mother is awesome
I love this anime
Twintails
that's true for a lot of adaptation
He is still Jesus
Because he is Tatsuya but his amensy made him forgot about it.
I prefer to buy physical release but the don't exist <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I hate doing it but I want to read what's next
Damn you Ascendance of a bookworm. You made me spend money on a digital subscription...
Masochist loli are good but sadistic loli are way better
No, darkness isn't a loli who grow up up when transforming and use boob missile. She is objectively better than darkness
This is why I love Aoi Yuki, she can voice sweet/nice/genki girl but she is also great at voicing psycho like Tany from Youjo Senki or Clementine from Overlord
Madoka ep1 isn't that confusing. But the first 5min from Bakemonogatari ep1 left me wondering wtf was that
Because on a rewatch you understand some scenes/characters differently
Watch order : Madoka S1 => Madoka S1 a second time => Rebelion movie => Madoka S1 + Rebelion again!
centorea 😦
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Monster musume next arc will be about worse girl
just like everyone in Symphogear need therapy, eveyrone in madoka needs one too
They are not sending my Spider Isekai LN. I have to pirate the epub 😦
but then Shaft magic happen
there isn't much shogi in 3gatsu
most likely
I still have 0 interest in Shogi or Kurata 😄
I had 0 interest in Shogi or Kurata before watch 3-gatsu no lion and Chihayafuru but I loved them
no monogatari. plebs taste
as you wish.
That's the best episode
hey, spoiler tag 😄
The manga is still going strong
It's already a miracle they did 3 season of a josei about competive poetry
https://www.reddit.com/r/bayeuxtapestry
Then there is the recap movie version



one of those I would say 😄
And I like Deca-dence
This season is kinda weak to be fair
People told me that S2 was going to be amazing but naw
still didn't get better
Dropped at S2 ep5
Madoka is my favorite anime. I dropped Magia record after 10episodes <:YrrowShrug:578883021407518730>
but I think a second S1 watch is good before rebelion
S1 => rebelion
<:kyubeyidkmaybe:633803689278046237>
people overhype this episode
ep3 is good, but it's not the best twist/episode of the serie
read all the DJ/official manga
sad mom
Concept movie trailer posted years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRq01091Fl4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrgxHDoe8gA derpy quality frame are great
the best of both world : https://nyaa.si/view/1106971
the studio, they love to experiment with different style
that's shaft for you
And fyi during the fight at the begining of the episode || Sayaka kept hitting the witch with her arm broken ||
it gets better
Madoka has so many good meme
Madoka Spoiler
yes
Twoearl and the mother are so fun
sorry
darker than black exist
Madoka S1 ending is hopeful too
so I can't speak about it
didn't watch tutu
little girl tortured on screen isn't dark ?
and it was a success
Nanoha did dark magica girl way before madoka
Symphogear was in production before Madoka aired
Amazon sent me Ajin vol. 15 today ! But it was the german edition <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Sadly no
|| opai loli dragon growing kobayashi a dick right? ||
It could have been good, but I didn't like it either
yeah
tights
Chihayafuru Manga || Chihaya first win against Shinobu thanks to a Taichi card ! 1-2 she can still be queen and ChihayaXTaichi can still happen ! ||
Just the basic which came with the bd
<:KazuCulture:622600017378803714>
I have the BD
But she wasn't in every episode sadly
Sensei was best girl
inb4 Amazon don't sell them because of illustration
|| they didn't defeat the demon lord || in your manga if I remember correctly
I loved last Sousou no Frieren chapter || the title could be translated Frieren the slayer too. || time to rip and tear
I've read it. It was great yeah
> They fixed that up on the Bluray at least
Shaft in a nutshell
She did her best with a shitty hand and her broken 14 years old girl mind.
Madoka Pachinko has been a thing for years
An album you didn't linked showing that Homura really tried to make Madoka happy with her actions : https://imgur.com/a/aVdNi
I missed Madoka Rebelion discussion <:HomuScared_MM:605927951900475425>
not the studio/producer
The problem is Kadokawa
why couldn't Index adaptation be has great as railgun <:worrySadCry:704044518726696960>
Dunno, I'll be seeing in in theater in 1 week
|| And a big part of her self-loathing came from her tainted soulgems and the fact that she couldn't protect Madoka from QB ||
|| The universe had to be rewritten and QB controlled to prevent that ||
Or QB now knowing her existence would have find a way to control her
And she knows it won't last forever and is willing to accept her future punishement
https://www.reddit.com/r/thingshomuradidwrong/
don't worry, i'm doing more mistake writting my mother thongue than english 😄
they're/their
just like your/you're
That's the kind of mistake i'm seeing more from native english speaker than non-native
Never watched a video from any of them <:LUL:662399439406759947>
And spider isekai in January. I hope they will do a good adaptation
SAO progressiv anime would be nice. Maybe people would stop shitting on SAO for skipping the climbing.
Hacker robot girl from Deca-dence should be there
first season ? they need to add all that too <:Ver:704169051391524875>
then 1 years to have it avalaible subbed <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Ngnl s2 first. So much good stuff left to enjoy
looks like you had some fun
662 messages in xdu while I was in theater
and I didn't like Bepop
Slayers anime was fun
I can finally understand why some people like shiro now and fight were incredible
Well, that was awesome
We also had Promare and made in Abyss
Un deuxième toulousain sur le serveur ? Belle coïncidence
Tonight
Every 200 chapters of enigma, catching bandit you get 2 chapters of plot
or BGS
like To Aru
Because they keep the name of the first LN as the serie title
so yeah Railgun got a good show
A guy with too much money in his hand has Misaka as his waifu
so you can watch Railgun
watch Index
It was about character facing chalenge in those game
SAO never was about the game
and SAO original game is still kinda relevant since characters have to overcome trauma from it and all the others games use the same core
like every anime in the last 15 years
This time Rider vs Saber had real animation and not just fancy effects
but you can't watch it yet <:LUL:662399439406759947>
Fate Heaven Fell 3 has better animation
> Land of the Lustrous
Being Phos is suffering
good think I watched it last week before HF 3
Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan was great
<:GUNdako:587004103511769088>
This season : Railgun/Deca-Dence are fun.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpsgc3m__zg best live action
3-gatsu no lion and Chihayafuru had live action adaptation I think too
Gantz
FMA
beautifull and melodrama to the max but only EP10 was good
This show was just trying too hard to make me cry
back to <#336298054724485131> <a:Run:708324291371991061>
Now that your XDU is playing without you you could watch anime again
I prefer my fate with a female lead. More yuri possibilities
There is a Madoka MAgia record stage play too it seems.
We have concert
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEuwDdLIQXA
No idea
like One Piece
Then some show get live action musical
We all know why transformer was successfull
Does the MC get better after S1 ?
AW ?
Poor Ruby, more SAO but no Sinon
never change
no available in your country
S2 <:puke:284834462452285441>
S1 was fun
Shaft and good production schedule, name a more unlikely duo
It was a good end
Yes, LN ended
with twitch chat on the video
EP10 was good, the rest was meh
beautifull show without substance using all the tropes to make you cry
Not VE I think
LWA and BNA was released in 2 batchs
with a shitty release schedule
they just buy the right to stream every Trigger show in the west 😄
At least they funded S1
Kemono friend S2
meanwhile i'm even adding 1-5min ONA when I find them
long running shonnen is cheating indeed
great magica girl show
Cross Ange. Ange gets the bland guy, the red head girl, the maid and most likely the dragon girl
Urara Meirochou was great
<:LUL:662399439406759947>
so it's a shonen yeah
published in a shonen magazine
https://myanimelist.net/anime/477/Aria_the_Animation

it's a Shonen
Watch Aria
and the fat otaku didn't like girls above 12
It teached me "twinkle little star" in english
It's usagi drop but less wholesome with more loli fan service
Oh yeah, this untranslated event 😄

> The film drew controversy, and was banned or excluded from distribution in several countries.[6][7] Toei even refused to sell the film to any United States distributor for a long time due to concerns about potential controversy and lawsuits (until Anchor Bay Entertainment eventually acquired the film in 2010 for direct-to-video release).[8]
Damn, you had to wait until 2010 to get the movie in the USA ?
Watch it now
it was awesome
movie was popular !
fortnite and pubg didn't invent anything 😄
BAttle royale movie is from 2000 and the novel is older
ennemy side characters are all stupid
people sold me this anime saying that every character were clever. But only the main characters are not stupid
I've read it
tried S2 because WN keep telling it was going to be better it was not
I binged S1 but it was not worth it
Tons of mystery hinted but never any explanation
And know that even if it looks like things are going to get better next episode there will be an other edge fest destroying everything
SAO is able to at least entertain me a little (with the help of nostalgia)
or just don't hate ? I think that re:zero is boring so I dropped it
so no you are not the only one
I dropped it after S2 ep5
Just don't read the real horse Wikipedia page or you will get spoiled
Un ironically a great sport anime.

Great manga yes
And I also love monogatari
I love this copy pasta
> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Monogatari series. The wordplay is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of advanced Japanese most of the writing will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Araragi's imperfect memory, a quality which is deftly woven into the style in which the story is presented. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the multifaceted nature of the dialogue, to realise that they're not spewing puns- they say something deep about the intricacies of the language. As a consequence people who dislike the Monogatari series truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Hanekawa's observant catchphrase "I only know what I know," which itself is a cryptic reference to Plato's account of the Socratic paradox. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as NISIOISIN's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.

> And yes, by the way, I DO have a Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothing personnel kid.

Rebelion ending isn't even 100% gen. He was fine with the movie ending with Madoka and Homura being reunited
and several movies
she isn't the main character anymore
oups, right
Otoyomegatari is a great manga
<:MikuCry:498999251939098625>
Meanwhile in Otoyomegatari (nothing to do with Bakemonogatari)

In the front how she thinks she looks, in the back what she realy looks like.
to humans she is an horrible monster
she think she is a cute little spider
but overall I prefer the LN design
I think the manga design works fine for comedy purpose and must be easier to draw/animate
That's how she sees herself, not how people see her
It's closer to manga design than to LN design
LN 8 and 9 should have been one book but 10 was great

Just found a nice trailer for the manga Sousou no Frieren : https://youtu.be/O4-uUKlC0BE
I didn't watch the first movie so I can't comment, but the second movie was better than the second season in my opinion
I still love those eyes
Nice

It fall in the crybait anime category
S2 is supposed to be sad but S1 is boring
2011 was peak anime anyway
SNK doesn't use loops, it uses PATHS !
unlike re:zero
and there are time travel show with well done loop
Re:zero is a harem anime but well hiden
re:Zero S2 is just as bad as S1 in my opinion 😄
It's an anime original

The LN is great!
Last season there was someone on r/anime explaining how close the anime was from the real race and it was fun to read. The real goldship video were great and Silence Suzuka last race was hard to watch.
way too fun doing strange things in the background
Special week is a great girl but the best is goldship
I missed this show
the OP has so many spoiler in it if you know what too looks for
yes
wich is 40% the of the first 5 volumes
13 episode they would have to follow the manga and only adapt kumoko story and skip the human side
> Ahahah, go buy the LN now
with a huge fucking cliffhanger
that would be the perfect stop point
24 episodes, they should adapt until the end of vl5
yeah
A bit too short

https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/kv7a8c/uma_musume_pretty_derby_season_2_episode_2/giwker8/ Someone did the same kind of post during S1. It's fun to see that the anime is just a remake of old race.

They have a reason : shitty production schedule thanks to the production committee.
That's my opinion too but people are spamming this "controversy" everywhere.
IG background animation is something else than anime animation
Cross Ange is great
really ?
re zero in best animation category
problem is public nomination, jury was fine for me
r/anime public nomination are just as bad
Best fight scene, no FGO Babylonia
no shit
> It was delayed
Yeah this is wrong
Beastars opening was great too
Vote for En !
Jury could only nominate show that wasn't already nominated by the public
Isn't minerva the one trying to save children from the demons ? I think Miso was thinking about the lone survivor in the bunker

I need more wholesomeness like this
This weak Yuru camp was so great
it was expected but it's still sad
Sadly Kumo anime doesn't do the LN justice
But yeah gatari is the best harem
With the mother trying hard to help her son lose his virginity
Twintails is a fun harem
Yamada kun manga first part was good. Then they added more witch from out of nowhere
Fun manga, the mc chose a girl early, good ending
An other good romcom/harem anime is Jitsu wa watashi wa
Wrong. But that's OK
A lot of people like toradora. I found it just  average

Well, people think that FMAB is the best anime ever. peoples have different opinion and that's fine
12 kingdom is an old isekai but it's just fantasy
SAO is several isekai in different world
just say that Touma is a bad protag and he will come
yeah
Bofuri could be described as an isekai too
trapped in a game is still isekai
Alice in wonderland was an isekai
too many salty fanboy

colossal titan ?
yes
Legend of the galactic hero. Too bad it's boring
the LN ended with some plot progression
if you want a red head heroine
Akatsuki no yona
I know
There was one good arc with the starfish girl then once it was over it didn't mater at all
nothing happens during S1 and I don't think that S2 will be worth it
it's not a dumpster fire, but still boring.
meanwhile akatsuki no yona is still going strong

Madoka || They are soul gems piloting bio mech (their bodies) || Attack on Titan || They are piloting titan ||
So the president of the USA is living the Mecha dream since he can send nuke ?
As long as Madoka and Attack on titan are still mecha following your definition i'm fine with it
IS s1 was still fun, but S2 had no redeeming quality
Cross Ange
He is never serious with the other girls and his girlfriend know this.
That's just some reasons that can push people away from the animes
a lot of fanservice, long dialogue, strange direction ...
yeah. I love it but I understand why it isn't for most people

Kill la Kill recap was awesome !
I should re read it
that's where the money come from
The author is working on the LN/anime/Manga
and yeah Being X allowed the orb to work just to fuck with her and to create relic to help spread religion
This orbs allow to use more mana at conce but you get exhausted faster
She was selected to test her special orbs because she is skilled enough to do it and the previous tester died while using it.
Serebryakov power is stronger.
<@!140986112326762496>  Tanya magic power isn't that great, but since she has some magic she knew that the army would have recruited her anyway so she volunteered.
It didn't have an english release yet ?
Wholesome yeah. To me they look like good friends but without real yuri undertone.
Oh Jesus
They do both in Symphogear
they are supposed to be idol and they are not singing 😦

She is a genius
Watched Yuru camp after dinner. Now i'm hungry again damn it
What are you talking about, it's 100% canon
and Nanoha can be short if you watch the 2 recap movies instead of S1 and S2
Better watch Madoka ASAP to dodge spoiler
I prefer Madoka but Nanoha is still great
Both ?
but the story doesn't make sense
Fate Extra last encore too

Damn Cygames. Making me want to play a new Gacha...
The anime is already really dense. I have no idea how a compilation movie could work

Aria is the best shonen ever
There are anime youtuber that are not The Cannipa effect ?
we didn't get any block buster for more than a year
I think most the Demon slayer movies success comes from the fact that it was one of the few movie released thanks to covid
trash animation, still a masterpiece

https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/mwvyit/ssssdynazenon_episode_4_discussion/gvkpok5/
I find them on the r/anime thread
Yomogi couching and sneezing during the whole fight was awesome.
Dynazenon is great

Visual are their only good points
Why would you watch a camrip of an ufotable movie?
Now that we have a Madoka announcement they can give us more info on 3-gatsu no lion S3 and more Monogatari right ?
But sometime they use his name as a promotion material
https://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2191376/full/ at least his name is there.
And first, they should release Eva
But we got HF3 and MiA so there is hope
I don't know if Madoka will be popular enough for them to release it in several cinemas in France.
I don't want to do 800km to watch a movie
They may show it once in Paris
Will morning rescue be there too ?
No it's not
More L'Oréal commercial! https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/705/377/6a9.gif
lucky you. I've been waiting since Rebellion was available subbed 😦
and the teaser is showing even less than the "concept" movie which was release in 2015 😄
Wait and see until we have a release date
Just like Eva 3.0 + 1.0 was announced almost 10 years before its release.
less than Homura during EP10
Walpurgis is supposed to be an amalgam of tons of different witches
If someone bought and saved it it's possible it will be released on nyaa.si
but it's still there in the LN
No, they skipped it in the manga
Didn't read Bikiwitch
Bikispider LN is great
as close as an official BD release you can get
the movie was leaked on the PSN
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T-_LnLccE4
Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru / Yuki Yuna is a Hero
Weakest ?! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeDG6BVd85g
I remember watching fansub that were rewriting their phone chat interface and VLC didn't like it
Look for his name in your favourite hentai site
You should read the author hentai too
Psycho sword is back in Thunderbolt Fantasy !
Yeah, a third show with Aoi Yuuki this season !
<:worryhype:398047794633506818>
> Tower Of God resumes on  May 17th everyone after nearly a year long hiatus. More details will be posted as we hear them.
Everythin that has been shown in the anime
|| In Episode 5, the students talk about how Yuri was abandoned as a baby, implying she and the rest of the students started off as babies just like Kumoko. They are 15 years old.

In Episode 6, Julius describes the spider he fought as the Nightmare's Vestige, a remnant of a creature known as the Nightmare of the Labyrinth, a spider monster that caused havoc 15 years ago.

In Episode 9, Julius says that his scarf was made from spider silk found from a complex Taratect nest, which is also where Fei's egg came from. This closely follows the events of Episode 2 where Kumoko's home was burned down and the dragon egg she found was taken away. He says this was 15 years ago.

In Episode 10, Ronant says he encountered the Nightmare of the Labyrinth 15 years ago, cutting to a flashback of said encounter, followed by a post-credits scene where Kumoko recounts her killing all those soldiers.

In Episode 11, we see a flashback from Shun's perspective where he is a toddler, meaning that he has been a part of the world since birth.

ep 11 and 13: kumoko directly remenbers the fight she had in the flashback from her perspective

ep 14: Literally has in the middle of the fight kumoko changing betweem her cute look and monster look that looks exactly like the monster they fought in ep 10. ||
Kumo da shinda !
it has ad
Once it was mining bitcoings
after that you shouldn't
You can use µtorrent. If it's version 2.1.x
copy the magnet link, and past it in your client
use the magnet link ?
I dropped it. Maybe it wasn't as good or the plot still hadn't really started
no idea
Symphogear is niche. Negima was a good shonen which ended years ago and is now past his prime
Yeah, it's not Seikon no Qwaser or Mato Seihei no slave level of degenerate
Negima was a fun manga. It started as a echi harem sol and at the end it's full of hype fight
what did you expect ?
It's the guy who wrote this line
Thenre there is Kumo where you are happy when there is CG
Bakemonogatari/I don't know/Rakugo ?
most likely
I liked them both. But it was almost 10 years ago, I don't know if I would still like if I were to watch it now
some new scene and a LOT of skipped content
the continuation  movie was ok but not great
Spinoff OAV were bad
lol
devilman cry baby echi ?
no twintail, no IS
no Seikon no Qwaser/Bakemonogatari,is this a zombie is barely echi
I've seen it but it's kinda bad
So an american japanese-cartoon ?
close enough
anime are Japanese cartoon, Avatar is a Korean-American anime
Slime 300 || Of course the demon king is also a cute loli https://i.imgur.com/MMV3bn7.png ||
it's avalaible ?
It's super fun
I won't pay to watch it
I've torrented it and didn't even watched it
Cinema are opening, only Demon Slayer available, FML
gundam/precure/pokemon ...
too

and she doesn't have them most of the time
her only common point with Fine is being blonde with big boobs
most of the time they are subcontractor
Maybe the BD fixed some thinks but after the first 2 or 3 episode 2017 was as much shit as 2016
some ?
http://www.skullknight.net/images/Berserk2017-ep23/beast-slowmo.gif
What did 2017 fix ?
The best version : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CJkmR3Tf7Q
I've heard that they sold tons of IP last recently. They still hold Top wo nerae ?
70 years after author death
I don't know who own the IP now
2013 the last few from old gainax already had left for Trigger and other studio
If it was announced by gainax the probality of it being done is close to 0
Dynazenon episode was great || https://i.imgur.com/SrKC7dH.png ||
This week ZLS was great https://i.imgur.com/452UyRk.jpg
Imagine pokelaboo being so generous
The last XV bd box had was telling you which node to do to get 20 gems!
The director didn't like the manga. Too much despair. And he added some useless arc/plot thread that didn't really bring anything good
Rose instead of lilies ? Way too subtle.
or so many change between TV an BD
my goat studio is Shaft but I don't think there are many with more production issue 😄
isn't it Mappa ?
Gen X Bruce willis ?
Die hard Collab you say ?
Like most studio
Urara Meirochou too !
They can do good stuff too. Railgun T, Konosuba movie, Saiki Kusuo, planet with ...
Narutaru ending is an eva clone !
diebuster is less hard sf yes
planete is good hard sf
but rare in every medium
hard SF is great
From what I remember it was great
years ago I read a SF book about figthing a war with time dilatation. I think the name was "The Forever War"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxKhhMdbU5I this music is awesome too
Let's do this Onee sama !
Sometime they are used to change the fence https://i.imgur.com/Ew7wtlj.jpeg
On r/anime discussion threads there are some background on every horses and races shown during every episode. And the video of the original race.
Don't read the Wikipedia page of the irl horse. It will spoil you the anime.
best maido
damn you TBC
i'm one or two week late on all my seasonals 😦
meet a girl, fix her problem, move on to next girl
and pretty boring
The one with Hitler and the live action one
There are already movies
tsundere/harem/reincarnation ...
they should adapt the wheel of time
he knew. He watched kumoko slaughter his allies armies and the fight between Kumo and the demonlord
he was 2D yeah, but he just stood there menacingly
to animate fight with only 3d models instead of mixing 2d and 3d
then the rest happened 😦
the early part with kumoko doing a weather report was great
https://tenor.com/view/let-down-disappointed-i-expect-nothing-im-still-let-down-sad-gif-15977210
Kumoko animation this episode my god
was is really that hard to understand that it was a joke bout low quality face ?
low quality faces from Madoka whose MC share her VA with kumoko
Being meguca is suffering
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrgxHDoe8gA Madoka spoiler if you haven't seen it
since they share the same VA
it's a reference to Meguka
https://animatedinfrastructure.wordpress.com/2020/05/18/calculating-damage-costs-to-infrastructure-during-the-exhibition-match-in-girls-und-panzer-der-film/ I love when people try to apply IRL logic to anime world
it's available ?
not just some
Most ?
More SSSS.Gridman/Dynazenon fuck yeah!
I watched it because I watched Gridman because Trigger
where they capture arena
it's an upgraded version of pokemon go
and unless you think that Starwars is a mecha show then it isn't 😄
that's not a mecha anime
The anime itself no
She never committed war crimes
<:Cryga:828680301646577702>
next volume will only be translated in october
<a:Tanya_Dance:585923358156390412>
Looks like it
more crazy Aoi isekai
https://i.redd.it/ch78kyz9v7671.png FUCK YEAH
Still a dude in his head
That's ok, It didn't click for me either so I dropped it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zBaKgJr7Ss
second half is bad
first half is ok
they couldn't animate open sea battle so they had to creat a floating cavern
Yukiyukite Senshadou is way better
that some normie tier "cursed" DJ
Did you know ? This fight is happening in a forest
but S2 can be bad yeah
the movies doesn't have either
S1 doesn't have that much fan service
or Fate Prisma Ilya (the best fate)
Kore wa Zombie Desu ka ? was a fun magica girl show too
and it's not good
it is
or Kill la Kill
Don't worry, intern-kun is working on it with his personal computer
They had an issue with the PlayStation2 rendering the cg
most anime are marketed to otaku
and Kaiju aren't alien either in Dynazenon
Most trigger show don't really have alien, LWA, Kiznaiver, Inou battle, BNA, Promare ...
It's good with some foi gras and fig marmelade
cinnamon, cilantro, ginger or star anise
No, it contains honey and a different spice  https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_d%27%C3%A9pices
i'm loving it
Shaft + Bakemonogatari author
S2 was pure trash
S1 was passable
they are rock
and some gems use boku and ore
I want genki phos back 😦
so we can appreciate ||Phose 10 000 years of sufferin g alone ||
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
manga is on hiatus since the author got his PS5
androgynous more than female
rock don't have gender
mostly male. some tomboy characters used it too
Anime characters and problems with parents. Hard to find a better duo
SF : Planetes
Madoka || soul gems are the pilote and body is the mecha ||
Is Madoka a mecha show?
Biomega : nice SF too
Knight of sidonia : mecha mecha, bio mecha nice SF
I do
Do they consider initial d mecha?
Twintails is SF
I dropped during the mega long flashback on Mars
More SF with some mecha6: ghost in the shell and Gunnm
Best show
Sidonia : best girl (50m tentacle) won the harem
Zombie desu ka is a Mahou Shoujo but doesn't really follow this logic
People really lack humour.
And since the tracing shit we got a movie
Eva fuck yeah!
Movie is a prequel
I know
Jibril is ngnl best girl
And the movie was great
They are all on Nyaa, that's all I know
> Siscon are people won't don't have siblings
When he kiss Tsukihi he feels nothing
he isn't into his sister
Well, the serie did start thanks to a 30sec panty shot
like Kill la Kill
it's the good kind of horny
https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/4bc190f5880a5a370f94063bc0519bcd.mp4 can you spot it ?
maybe she wears a band-aid ?
ok
Oooooh

Pre order or not pre order Kumo spoiler || https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=FIGURE-128049 ||
their adventure continues, go read the LN
Buy the LN™️
Isekai quartet movie ...
Kadokawa really doesn't know how to use its money
with all the horny
Dragon maid is back
yeah, not that much worse than 90% of hollywood movies with US army in it
12 kingdoms is an isekai
it's not exclusive
yeah but they can be isekai and a cyberpunk subgenre
shit happening in an other (video game) world = isekai 😄
Even bofuri is an isekai in my eyes
Yeah
Jobless reincarnation doesn't really uses game mechanics either. Only on ranking of monsters/adventurer
Without the fun tiger dojo
Subaru rewind is just playing a vn until a bad end then they send you back to the last check point
Literally minority report
Oh right Bakarina is back
yeah, sword isekai is a guy
Look how cute she is
a witch in a sword
I just finished Thunderblot Fantasy S3 after pausing it on ep9. Aoi best role this season wasn't a spider, it was a talking sword

Anime logic


Now we wait for Shaft to adapt the rest
Monogatari watch order
Speaking of bookworm, this week pre pub chapter was really fun
Onii-sama is breaking the magic setting in his own show too
you can be non-linear and/or confusing while still being interesting from the start : Baccano for example.
too much build up is often not worth it
So better drop it and watch something else I enjoy
If a show need 20+ episodes to get good then I won't care about any characters and I'll just hate it
people don't like the same things and that's ok
> Watch 50+ episodes. The good part come right after !
I've heard the same for Clannad/Re:Zero/legend of the galactic Hero
right
What you mean is that Symphogear is a gundam show ?
<a:KirikaAniMunch:755151066169081856> <:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000>
Their gloves and shoes colours are the same as their irl hooves
r/anime episode discussion thread were filled with trivia about the real horses
I don't know about the second part
The first part yeah
from an oustider point of view the JSDF propaganda light. Compared to most hollywood movies
that's doesn't look like any anime
I liked it, but some people don't like the 950+ years old loli
it looks like OC yes
but I don't think you will like it
gate has both
And if corporation don't try to protect their copyright they lose their right to it
Do it
Watch and read Ascendance of a bookworm! https://i.imgur.com/2odGmKZ.jpg
you may have seen even older anime
Dragon ball, Nausicaa and Castle in the Sky are all older!
Madoka is mecha || soul gems are like eva plug to pilot the body ! ||
GuP is mecha
Initial D is Symphogear grand father
I agree
Attack on titan is closer to being mecha
initial D is a mecha. his car even get power up
we already talked about it earlier
thanks to fighter jet
if GuP and kotobuki are mecha then yamatos is mecha
the whole town is the mecha !
is Deca-dence mecha ?
Eva are bio mecha
tachikoma from GITS are piloted mecha at first but they become self aware !
Isekai who only relies on their basic premise/gimmick are bad
and DTR
the OAV and the loli uniforms are mech
mecha with multi pilot/crew exist
Horsies good
https://youtu.be/lAuSmXw4Z2c?t=88 Tokai Teoi miracle !
what made the season even better for me was comparing the anime race to the real one.
still incredible numbers
tbf BD had some gacha bonus
by a REALLY WIDE MARGIN
highest grossing gacha in Japan since release !
damn, the endless 8 generator is down
broadcast ? Chronological ? rebroadcast with S2 in ?
which order ?

> || Also, it's homura's point of view that decided Madoka wasn't happy as a goddes|| 
|| The real Madoka on the flower field told Homura that she would be sad to leave her friends and family, when we see her arms as a godess they are covered with scars. She has to shoulder every magica girls despair. She ISN'T happy ||
|| Madoka isn't happy as a goddess, she scarified herself because she couldn't see any other way. Homura tried to give her a happy life ||
I recommend rewatching S1 before watching rebellion 😄
must defeat Brazilian night
Small sad comic
Done with Madoka ? Not sad enough ? read this :
|| The curse of Bahal strike again. talk with the person you love people ! ||
|| The lilies flied was a *subtle *hint that they kinda loved each other ||
|| And she is "ok" with it. She is alone while she let madoka be happy with her friends and family, she didn't force madoka to love her ||
yeah
|| DIdn't she say when turning into a goddess that she remembered all the timeline ? ||
208€...
Yeah ! there is a Humora Tamura volume 2 avalaible on Amazon !
|| She still hadn't fallen into despair, she could still live her life ||
|| tbf she tried during Rebellion ||
|| It was Madoka but without her memory and her power given to bebe and sayaka. ||
||Kyubey confirms it was her ||
nothing else
I only know the first meaning of those 2 flowers
isn't that the red flower ?
Shaft and fucked up production. Name a better duo
back to sleep
I don't know why i read it as shinsekai yori...
It's an adaptation
I agree
That's easy. Just add a 2min elevator scene where nothing move !
https://myanimelist.net/character/170493/Suishou_Hakamada
And Aoi Yuki voicing a psycho is always great
You could try Cross Ange, Code Geass, Evangelion, TTGL, planete with, Attack on Titan...
It could have been great but wasn't.
animation quality get really depressing
She is there!
both were crap
I don't understand people telling that Berserk 2017 was less bad than 2016
https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FlusteredSnappyAlpineroadguidetigerbeetle-max-1mb.gif Next titan transformation.
Maybe girls last tour. But less old and obscure
Less niche, Bokurano.
Some niche manga I've read years ago and liked : memories of emanon
There are way too many things to watch to keep watching something you don't enjoy
Or put it on hold
If you struggle to watch a show just drop it
Girls last tour
Watch it then read the last 2 volumes
GLT anime is great. The music, voice and ambiance is even better than just the manga
Initial D Is getting old
harder to build good model but easier to animate. They should just do an anime about car
Or CGI horses

Years after pre order I can replay the scene from No game no life 0
Cute badass ||and lewd|| magica girls
<a:IllyaTriggered:650038877456826369>
And most of Sakura stuff from HF/zero were spoiled by reading hentai anyway
Had I started with ubw instead of zero I wouldn't have keep watching the franchise
I watched release order because I had no choice and it was fine. I later read the VN first route and found it boring.
I mostly don't care about spoiler. If a serie is good only thanks to some plot twist then it's a bad serie. A good serie can still be great even if you know some keypoint
he doesn't even have a VA
better than Non non Biyori big brother
Initial D
https://streamable.com/f7wxi What is Shenshadou ?
|| Not in one piece at first ||
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeDG6BVd85g HEY WASHI
Fun anime full of meta
newcomers are cheaper to hire
Rip Miura
The last berserk chapter is available in English. It ends with a motherfucking cliffhanger...
this is why she doesn't have a route. Every other girls would lose
She makes everything better
Ilya is a better saber than saber
years of hard work to create the perfect waifu
deal with it
her real name is altria
still saber
She needed one to have child once
easy guide to saber :
yes
Otherwise I would have said Red Saber, saber of red, saber alter ...
the default one
HF is Assassin's route ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixqNT09PBho
red twin-tails are always great
let him write VN and let other people adapt his work
last time he was allowed to write an anime scenario we got Fate Last/encore
Classic SF
That's just reverse gattaca
or delete your old anime and re DL them when you want to rewatch
buy more hdd
In practice it's the same
Gate is an isekai, so yeah stargate is an isekai too
Most of the story happens in another ||video-game|| world
That's close enough
yeah
ON IRA ON SAURA SAUVER NOTRE EXISTENCE
mostly the episodic early parts
I remember almost nothing of the plot
I love this manga
like most WN turned LN. Once the author exploited all his early idea the story lose steam
Fate/Grand Order babylonia wasn't ufotable but was still awesome
"recent and forgotten" great anime which deserves more love : Girls last tour !
why would you copy IS ?
giant alien **tentacle **girlfriend.

Manga is great, I didn't read the LN. Anime could have been better
Nice ada9, the manga is fun
https://myanimelist.net/anime/11179/Papa_no_Iukoto_wo_Kikinasai
It's like usagi drop but with fan service
Did you watch "listen to me girls I'm your father?"
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:817347937183989770>
There is a lot of non-orange name here
They had a whole episode with metoera presenting a Powerpoint ...
It had potential, but they did nothing with it
I dropped around EP10
with the MC being uselss while he could have explained everything
They kept on re explaining everything every episode
Re:creators : boring exposition the anime
With how rushed the story is in the movies I disagree
HF has cool fight

Excaliber-Dess!
Watch the OAV
more lewd ?
of course it's at least decent
3 seasons, 2 movie and several OAV
I like it too
Yeah, Nise is the lowest point in the series if you don't like fan service.
Monogatari had a 48 min episode with 2 characters in a classroom speaking about a math test happening 2 years ago and it was great !
And yet, I still preferred Zero than UBW
they have been "working" on the movie for almost 8 years.
I'll ve excited when we get a release date
He also did Thunderblot Fantasy !
aren't most OAV dvd (BD now) too ?
Origina Anime D...
Yeah, we really needed to see everything happening between hanekawa and senjougahara
which neko ?
but some people don't like fan service and nise has a lot of it
they pushed pop team epic shitposting one step further
the video is black, the subs are doing everything
I just learned that some bored people re created the first episode of Pop Team Epic with subs. 360p and 69 fps : 129GB https://nyaa.si/view/1096843 1080p 420fps : 42GB  but compressed so most computers can't even read it https://nyaa.si/view/1097157 the uncompressed version : 1.1TB https://nyaa.si/view/1099393
3 torrents up

|| The magic eye effect is great ||
torrent is always the answer
more KAGAWA LIFE
Yuyuyu was great
Nisekoi isn't an isekai!
I love this autor.
Ganbare Douki-chan is still pure culture
I can't handle mtl
LN is still going strong with fast translation too
<:Praise:808996862144413758>
Great!
animegatari did it too
But there are no good WN translation
There are very few changes in the LN
The WN is complete
It's going to need at least 15 season
The author had the whole story planned before she started writing and publishing it
And it keeps getting better
time for some summer camping and a new beach episode !
We already had tons of winter camping
<a:peepoRainbowComfy:585613200125591580>

they even have flashbkack showing that whatever the time/space they meet
Hilda, Salamandine, the guy, there could be some argument for the maid too
2 girls + a guy
Ange kinda has 2 girls in her harem by the end
Cross Ange ?

That too
Not that much. The number goes up slowly with years
https://myanimelist.net/animelist/bouletos?status=2&order=4&order2=0 imagine bothering rating your show.
VE was the most beautiful boring show
My rating is : is this show pop team epic ? Yes : 10. If not did I like it? Yes/no. Everyone but me has trash taste on the Internet so anime site score don't matter

With J-novel subscription you have access to newly translated chapters before they release the ebook

> The numbers for So I'm a Spider, So What? were impressive. During its run, it was one of the top five shows on Crunchyroll, and within six months, the earnings exceeded its MG. Because of this, Kadokawa now earns extra royalties from Crunchyroll for the title. Meanwhile, the series has received over 340 million views in Asia, and it is in bilibili's top 10 of all time in the Japanese animation category. 
Imagine if it had good animation
I hate modern flat and empty design
I prefer mal interface on desktop than anilist
Yeah
I don't even need to click update
I let it start with Window yes
And detect the related Anime (sometime the first episode need a fix)
It knows the file played in vlc
You don't need to open taiga. It updates the list automatically while you play the episode
Ublock origin
Imagine seeing ads on the Internet
Taiga works with mal again for months
netflix release schedule and bad subs

Waiting for the gacha to be available in English
Yes
Hey I just remembered. Isn't Uma Musume technically an isekai since the girls are supposed to be reincarnated soul of famous horses?
Your dad has good taste
Best S2 horse was rice shower !
The last bd is there!
yes it is 😦
not like the episodes leaked for real
titles and thumbnails ? You would know as much by reading the manga 😄
> No senpai ! This is our fight
She didn't even know that isekai was a popular trope
An exemple of isekai that wasn't supposed to be an isekai at first was bookworm. But the author couldn't think of a way for a poor little girl to know about books without this twist
I wish I could see it
I wish living in Paris wasn't prohibitively expensive, theater marathon the 20 November :

Pizza hut is missing in remake movies
HDR 4k upscale from 720p base resolution 😄
Rip Kumo
Long preprod isn't always enough.
Best sequel is Yuru camp or Evangelion
Odd Taxi was great too
Heike Monogatari has ended. Best fucking anime this season even if I didn't understand part of it.
Dynazenon has the greatest anime scene ever https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/n73gna/just_eating_a_churro_ssssdynazenon/
Mushoku tensei || the figurine monologue is great ! ||

There were some battle school with Yuri !
I'm OK with it
Time for more saber/sakura/rin face?
I should check if then manwha ending/power scaling is has bad as in the WN

At long last, a reference to Simo Häyhä by Continuation
GuP, I'm impressed how they are able to improve fight even more with each new episode.
I love it

3-gatsu is shaft at its best
Kawamotos sisters are pure wholesomeness
She cooks too
bookworm too !
Bookworm
literally unwatchable.
Never realised before your screenshot but one of the lavatory isn't usable because of the urinal.
Blame Kadokawa
This is why people said that Trigger saved anime with KLK
great Jiggle physics this week in sono bisque doll
Gate is really fun yeah !
Alice in wonderland is quite old !
Pina Colada becoming a fujoshi is great
so I didn't really care
There was less japanese nationalistic propaganda in Gate than in the average hollywood war/apocalypse movie has with the US army
Listen to Rory character song ! https://youtu.be/WVwuE9NT0Us

Catching up Princess Connect S2. This gacha ad has no right to be so fun
So the anime missed a lot of closure for a lot of characters and the incredible last battle.
There is also the fact that the director didn't like the manga, it was too bleak for him.
As long as you enjoyed it, who cares what rating you gave it?
I want the last LN pre pub chapter animated but we need 3 more seasons for that
Myne scale realy well untill late game
Oreimo did it earlier
Yuuki Yuna is a hero
Cross Ange is a harem and it's good too
I'm still salty
Kuroneko was the best
https://myanimelist.net/anime/8769/Ore_no_Imouto_ga_Konnani_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai

Let's ask "a little sister is all you need" author.
But everyone has yaoi hands in it
Great anime
Kinda like Fate Stay night LN with the burning city flashback that keeps coming back
The problem with naruto flashback is that it was the same flashback again and again
I've only watched S1 and I the mandatory flashback to make you care about every demon after their death was funny to me
There is a lot of disagreement in the comments it seems :D
There is a thread on r/anime right now with a lot of upvote named :
> The latest season of Demon Slayer is a great example of how to do a long multi episode battle.
Better than the Demonslayer crowd saying it's the best anime ever because of Ufotable flashy animation
Not in France, they are the same price.
Fanta is bad, Orangina is better
I don't know if he was participating
Hey, Canipa effect is decent
Nope

A third recap is planed for 86 before the last 2 episodes.
but I still want it 😦
I bought all 9 volumes of Witch Hat Atelier this week. It wouldn't be reasonable to buy this
Last few BD I bought from Japan : Dynazenon is only 3, MiA was 2, eizouken only one (bigger) box
12 episodes 6 BD ? let's milk those otaku !
https://i.imgur.com/SiU6KHn.png
They don't and I hope they never will
Why not ufotable? According to DS fan it's now the best studio that should animate everything too!
Mappa is adapting everything those days. Let's ask them! ||and lose everything that made Bakemonogatari a great adaptation||
nhentai bad, sad panda good
chihayafuru is competitive poetry, not mahjong
they are doing differents things but they are both great sport anime
Chihafuru and GuP are both great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldOvW4OFHAI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3iRuXLUwDk both Shenshadou and Kurata are real sport !
Sono bisque meme from last episode || https://i.imgur.com/fH8oTkd.jpeg ||

Isn't that the second time they have done this ?
FGO Solomon. Not this shit again
Putin Isekai is fun at the start but it get boring

I'm weak to cliffhanger. After the last bookworm LN pre pub I've started reading the WN mtl. I went to sleep at 5am and now I only have one question : wtf is supposed to be the real translation of "rice field"...

And Shaft have done this before with Bakemonogatari

In the last volume you have a side character (man) who is with an other man but it's like 3 panels.

That's shovel : 
> Shovels are great. Shovels are the quintessence of civilization.

> With a shovel, you can dig a hole just deep enough to hide yourself. Or if you gather a bunch of people with them, you can dig a fine trench.

> If you change your viewpoint a little, you can even dig a tunnel. You can smash a sturdy enemy trench with mining tactics (not that they get used often).

> A shovel is a good friend to any and every type of soldier. And a shovel is the best gear for a close-quarters fight in a trench.

> Longer than a bayonet, simpler to handle than a rifle, sturdier than any other tool. Not only that, but they are extremely cheap and easy to make, so they're perfect for mass-producing. Plus, I don't have to worry much about damaging my mind.

> This is it. The ideal piece of equipment. This is the point humanity was meant to reach. Civilization has developed the shovel as its implement.

> Above all, it doesn't rely on magic, so it's optimal for stealth kills. With a shovel, it's possible to educate numbskulls who are dependent on magic scanning - Klang! We can say it's an indispensable item for nighttime raids. Of course, it's an excellent general-purpose tool at any time of day.

> "The shovel is truly an implement born of civilization", Tanya murmurs, leading a unit to wish good evening to the enemy with their shovels.

>  Youjo Senki  Volume 2 Chapter 5, page 256-257

Well, Geass is kinda trashy too
I would agree
Slayers is great fantasy !
Berserk could be descriped as a revenge fantasy
Ubell blat had a good story but I dropped it a few years ago.
The first episode had some potential, but it was an incel power fantasy yeah
Author must be bored to play on their PlayStation 5 all day
Chamiko opening recape was great
And chris little mirrors
it's the easiest way to show that the bad guy is a bad guy.
and A1 spend way too much time focusing on those scenes.
The author know it's a cheap trick but he was inexperienced.
Speaking of mmo, if you have almost 3 hours to spend here is a good video on their history 😄 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHQE0ILci4o

Even before. SAO was teh Demon Slayer of it's generation, OK story, nice visual and OST

As a LN reader this episode was like Overlord S3 again. It could have been awesome. But it was just OK.
ED was animated by the mangaka.

but I didn't watch Tonikawa so I can't say for this one in particular
harem isn't always the main theme of the show. Sometime is just one of element of the show.
> one of them is his sister
Did this ever stop Japan ?
Just like SAO
Even if the MC is in a relationship with his girlfriend the rest of the cast is still in love/lust with him
Bunny Girl Senpai is just as much a harem as Bakemonogatari
It's fun reading people in denial.
> NO! My favourite show isn't a harem!
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/w1xe0o/what_even_counts_as_a_harem_i_asked_ranime_about/

What’s this?

    This is a 13m Matroska file which contains a video track, two audio tracks, and a slightly larger than usual SSA subtitle track.
    But, it’s not your common file. The video track is just black, and is used only to set a resolution. Both audio tracks are fine and remuxed from the original.
    The subtitle track… is somewhat uncommon. It contains 16894 Dialogue entries. For the 1080p version, the raw subtitle file size is a bit more than 1TB. For the 360p version, it’s a bit more manageable at 128GB.
    If you are able to play the file, and display everything correctly, you will see the same output as from the original.

What are these magic subtitle files?

    They contains 16894 line entries, which correspond to every frame from the original file.
    Every line is composed of several colored vector drawings in the form of cubes. Each one has the size of 1x1 pixels.
    These lines are aligned with the top left corner, and contain internal newlines to create rows and columns.
    Every single of these pixels is colored. It is a lossless transofmation from the pngs produced to embedding them, so you could recover the original easily.
    TL;DR: every line contains one frame of video. In the subtitles.
the video is black. EVERYTHING is done by the subs
42GB for a single 360p episode
https://nyaa.si/view/1097157 the 42GB version
I should find this torrent again

Yeah?

That the anime is indeed gay
Best recap is still KLK
Eva 3.0+1.0 CGI were incredible yeah. GuP tanks battles are quite good too
Cross is awesome. And you can't tell me that Ange fuck both the girl and the guy and the end https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/crossange/images/2/25/1427610377624.gif/revision/latest?cb=20150601123137

SUPAA CAR !
Mister donuts + vampire name a better duo
It was supposed to be a movie? Fuck it.
too bad they can't reproduce /a/ sfx in anime
moar suffering
MiA last episode will be double length like S1.
They need to self insert
serveur with a majority of shonen watchers won't like it so much. Some teenagers (and some adults) can't appreciate a show if the MC isn't a male.
Yeah, fujoshi as a comedy trope
Then you can rewatch the BD with new visuals
I wouldn't want it any other way
peak monogatari
<a:ShinobuDabbing:588071837079044097>
but watch Shaft production crash and burn while making this
fuck yeah
but it's only one route
tsukihime manga
I've read the manga. I've heard it's not that bad
When i watched Zero UBW wasn't even released yet anyway 😄
Fucking burning city flashback, stop spamming it
I've read the first route after watching Zero=>UBW because HF was announced yet and didn't really like it.
Zero => UBW => HF or UBW => HF => Zero both work.
Last encore had a madoka witch. that's all I remember
And between Apocrypha, Fate Last Encore or the first Camelot movie i'm not sure which is worst
Too bad she isn't the focus of the show.

10 episodes wasn't enough in my opinion.
It's beautiful, but story isn't that great
And the final fight sucked hard compared to the LN
S1 was a good adaptation, S2 was OK even if it skipped some world building then S3 skipped tons of content. I needed at least 2 more episodes to expand and develop everyone.
S3 is a bad adaptation sadly. And they only adapted like a fourth of the story.
> bookworm
Read the LN!
Oh! I forgot that with Overlord S4 come Ple Ple Pleiades S4!
And having read the ln and the WN it keeps getting better
Well, she printed her books so now the story needs more to keep going.
Yeah, but the last episode makes it worth it
Koyomimonogatari is a mixed bag but the rest is top tier
Kizumonogatari was a bit bellow the rest of monogatari but it was beautiful

It's OK, takina will meet a strange cat and wish to meet chisato again.
Her ribbon is way more versatile than Humora guns. And once the time magic is countered there much left to be done.
She doesn't have one gun. She has ribbon and she can do almost anything with them.
<:FeelsBadMan:311546146889662465>
More monogatari light instead of more monogatari
This ost ❤️
Because I want some more Bakemonogatari
Still no news ? 😢
Bakemonogatari is under Aniplex too right ?
We have no budget and we are missing 1min30 of air time what do we do ?
Create one of the most iconic anime scene.

Do a mappa and get free lancer from twitter!
And once it was written they were missing time to have a good productions ?
Because it's the best anime ever
The only anime official site I spent money on was Wakanim back when we could direct download episodes.
It's super fun
You are reading/watching every trash isekai under the sun but hadn't read yet this manga ?
Looks great
Damn, akiba maid first episode was awesome.

Pop Team Epic, mecha of the season
Dat fucking cliff hanger at the end of last Das Final ...
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Loituma.gif I prefer the old Orihime
Bookworm has fanbooks translated and published !
They do physical for their biggest franchise
Didn't expect an official pop team epic/Made in Abyss cross over 😄
Curry, the best food in the world according to isekai writers
He knows how to make Curry !
Wait until someone upload a 60fps version!
❤️
Feels like the best XDU Collab
Yeah, I instantly realised it was Klara from GuP
Good think the translator only left those invented word the first time they appeared in the LN.
And invented language.
So many Bridges.
Time for the Bridges arc.
CR or amazon or whatever the official stream is.
It's just official stream rip
Shitpost anime but contender for the best animated mecha of the season!
Gundam stole every animator I guess?
Best op visual are pop team epic!
Chainsaw maid >> Chainsaw man || https://i.imgur.com/6ZPfooo.mp4 ||
Doesn't mean much. Rakugo is studio deen too and it's awesome.
I found S2 boring and didn't watch S3
Unlike most isekai S1 is good

||She is physically around 10/11 during early p5.||
||she first use it during p3||
Damn, ascendance of a bookworm p5v2 cover is awesome. Too bad the anime will never reach this point.
then he changes the hair style
The biggest issue with bokurano manga is that the artist can only draw one face
right
Is it the first full anime episode done by onely 2 peoples ?
The world is a strange place.
Speaking of PTE S1 I found that someone did a Hoshiiro Girldrop DJ and someone translated it.

Pop team epic earned the best animation of the season this episode.
omfg Pop team epic this week ||HELLSHAKE YANO IS BACK||
Good show
The LN is even trying to teach you the language.
Every part of her name has a meaning.

Spaurh Aronn Saicspath Nimh Laitpanr Painaich in Baronh best girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QprkSBUfCis hype
And the manga is even worse.
Bokurano has tons of disturbing scene if you want.
Nice, someone subbed the new isekai ojisan episode !
It's a bonus.
Best movie of the year.
You need a blanket to watch Yuru Camp.
I'll have to finish it at home later.
Received a new manga volume yesterday, start reading it in the subway. I forgot how echi looking up to magica girls was...
No Taiwanese puppets. Not interested.
Watch Birdie wings. You will love golf.
mimic chest 3rd !
Frieren popularity contest 😄
When speaking about guns ok, but for the rest fuck them
Too bad the editor/translator decided to use imperial instead of metric everywhere ...
Nah, she literally can't go higher by the end of P5.
but after the spin off author said she would like to write more
the LN in japan yeah
the LN is reaching the end of the WN yeah. But with more content then there are tons of unpublished side story and the spin-off ||Hannelore 5th year at the academy||
she even got a harem now.
cringe level has been way lower for a few years.
Nice Bocchi reference in the latest watamote chapter 😄
Or isekai ojisan
Pop team epic
The greatest  cross over episode.
there is a link to a nyaa.si torrent pinned in <#336310266654490624>
Oh right, there was some chapters https://hiatus-hiatus.github.io/
They already used the COVID excuse!
Girls last tour is a good choice. Otherwise a good long running adaptation of the wheel of time.
Great fan made show and awesome op.
14 episode? It's been years since I last checked this.
Chihayafuru?
https://streamable.com/bosbgf still stupid. I still love the way the line is delivered.

This Frieren chapter. WTF
BOW DOWN  TO THE GOD EMPEROR OF MANKIND
tbf ep2 was great
Isekai was that big in the anime world yet during Cross Production.
Cross Ange is the only show where a character told an other : I fucked your waifu.
More like otaku worshipping pure waifu
