you know, just kinda seems convenient i think
or play tabletops
or how many people play xdu
nah just really thought of it, because it seems convenient, like for example if you wanted to see who was participating in writing prompts and who wasnt
should there be a way to display the number of people with a given role?
i'd be down for a serena role as well
i forgot people use light mode
ah, true
maybe a lighter version of maria's silver?
we dont
yeah
ooh okay
ye
ah kk, just was wondering
should you add it to the role assignment color spread as well?
did you ever get around to adding that?
we've discussed it a few times i think
<:KirikaSpook:602224871585480776>
<:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>

welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
hello
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
welcome
welcomd
welcome
i like hibiki and miku best, but i like all of them in general
who's your fav out of all of them anyway?
oh okay
oh, you're not finished yet?
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
weclome

<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
hello
welcome
welcome back
welcome
and also are just bad at developing
like, the devs dont know what balance is
more than half the stories are not good
it's horribly designed
i hear xdu is a pretty bad game
what kind of gear content are you looking for?
oh it's the other gear writer on ao3 welcome
wow a lot of new people all of a sudden
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
there's a fourth season, it doesnt end after GX
wait have you watched AXZ yet <@135863275303731200>
glad to have you on the server, what got you into gear?
hello
welcome
headpat
welcome
there's a fifth coming next year
nice
but yeah how many seasons have you seen <@135863275303731200>
hello
welcome
wlcome
woah two new people
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
wellcome
Welcome
welcome
welcome
so there isnt really anything deceptive of calling gear a magical girl show
thematically it's a lot more of a magical girl anime
magical girl shows have a very broad reach
yeah there really isnt
so you dont know like half the main cast yet
oh okay
how do you spell that
i mean the genre is very broad
which season are you on
welcome
hello again
welcome
welcome
i feel like i've seen your user name before
hi there
madoka isnt the one i was talking about
which channel though
yeah
in fact one of my favorite anime is a magical girl deconstruction, just saying that is kinda a spoiler for people who havent watched it so i wont name it here
lol yeah
i just highly dislike what it did to the genre
i dont hate madoka as a concept though
also the character destroying twist in rebellion just to turn madoka into a big francise sucked
which is mostly why i dont like madoka, i also dont like how the theme in madoka was handled but that might be just me
i also dont like how the genre is basically devolving to suffer porn
yeah
i forget how dark the first season of gear is sometimes
but then everyone started trying to imitate it
and if it was an isolated thing it would be fine
i like madoka as a concept
i dont like madoka
hell, the first season is typical post madoka magical girl shit with scifi set dressing and there are a lot of scifi magical girl shows
welcome
oh there's two people huh
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome back
nice icon
you typed the command in wrong in role assignment <@153522612251656192>
welcome
it feels like it might of been one more down but really it could've been either
like it was at the bottom? or i might just be misremembering
i think it's suggestion box that was moved up?
something moved i think?
i meant like in the server tab/section thingy
also did something move here?
welcome
huh
welcome
welcome
welcome back
welcome
hellpo

what'd i miss
i'm back
hihi
oh okay, just check this channel again when you're done
<@174440042289168384> <@!137113218173632512>
that's a big eevee plushy
uh, what's this a xover with?
okay?
uh
what's this for?
okay?
uh
no
uhm
though ver wouldnt see it that way
a tyrant but still a ruler
every other death in G?
yeah
"They're children! They have nothing to do with this!"
and maria was horrified
remember the whole scene where ver killed a bunch of children
yeah
yes
there really isnt much of a question here
yeah pretty much
since you know that's kinda what she does regularly
hibiki'd probably try to listen to the guy's story, and try to get him to stop but if he didnt then she'd try to stop him by force
i mean without the whole backstory but similar motives
they've tried to stop several villains exactly like that
there's not much of a question there
they'd try to stop that guy obviously
but like still we need more context
they'd try to stop that guy obviously
we need more context
it had the unfortunate side effect of  raising my dub standards however
since the dub voice acting is actually amazing
the original game is also actually why i say english dubs arent bad
and yeah i've tried not to adapt the battles as how they'd be in game like entirely with all the mechanics, since it's a grid game/tactical rpg ala fire emblem and those mechanics dont translate well to actually writing fight scenes
i'm trying to write it so you dont need that much background knowledge to understand, though the full impact of some stuff wont hit you if you havent, or like several questions are raised about some of the mysteries if you have played the game
but otherwise, thanks for the feedback, glad you enjoyed what i have so far
but yeah if you were referring to me earlier, so you dont make the same mistake again, i use she/her
<@106861977086779392> (since i forgot to ping you in the first message, and you see this when you wake up)
if you're referring to me it's she
so, <@&454478881349435392> if yall remember i was writing a symphogear fic here, and you might have been wondering where it went, well bad news it's on hiatus for the foreseeable future, but i have different news though
I am in fact currently writing another fic which i have three chapters  of it have been released already so you wont have to wait long
Though this is a fic for a game that i highly doubt any of you have even so much as heard of, so there's that, though I have been writing it in a manner that you can conceivably read without playing or knowing about the game
The game itself is another story with Singing as a huge plot point, the acronym of SG and also many other similarities that are spoilers for the actual game that i won't say in case anyone actually wants to play it eventually
Anyway, here are the links:
https://archiveofourown.org/works/17583662
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13192143/1/Stella-Glow-A-Song-of-the-Sea-and-Stars
ah alright, just was wondering
though if i remember right in the past people have done so, but i dont think we ever asked for clarification
would we still @ community anthology if we post non-symphogear fanfiction here?
yeah so something similar to that
have a limit
doesnt diend like
that shoots cards
and has a gun
im not so familiar on decade lore
y'know
im tired
final forms
final
several of their super forms
a lot of their super forms would probably be more powerful than someone with frontier
you'd be surprised?
that's effectively the same thing as giving ver a gear or a relic
bad shit
since ver seems like the type of person to be super duper hypocritical
they'd see the other as an irredeemable villain
because of the obsession with being a hero
you know
i feel like ver'd get hypocritical if confronted with a kamen rider that acted the same way
uhhhh
i love doing research for stuff while writing fics
i wasnt gonna mention that but yeah
thanks gen
points at gaim? did they fight each other in gaim <@279341087494242304>
where all the riders fought each other, and killed one another for a wish
battle royal kamen rider tokusatsu
points at ryuki
that’d be really fun
but also
i was gonna just say that’s just a tokusatsu/magic girl thing at that point
do read the vns or if you really have to the manga (which are at least passable adaptations that have problems with some aspects but elevate some of the highest moments to being even more amazing, kinda like an anime adaptation), it is actually one of the best things i have ever read
also ***dont watch the umineko anime***, it is a horrible adaptation that cuts out essential elements and foreshadowing
and why the upcoming ciconia is wtc 5 instead of 4
that's why umineko's wtc 3 instead of wtc 2
each of these are seperated into four episodes each
respectively
these are Kai and Chiru
and each of them have a sequel which are in higurashi's case the "Answer arcs" and in umineko's case they are the "Core Arcs"
the first one in the series is the "Question arcs" this is base higurashi or base umineko
the wtc series games are split into two games each
yeah so
oh uh
behind higurashi, higurashi kai, umineko, and umineko chiru
the fifth main wtc game
<@!302063351767498752> yeah ciconia when they cry is coming out
essentially we’re telling lectric not to abandon an idea, i @ ed you earlier but it moved away from what i had @ ed you for
so dont you dare abandon your idea or change it just because it isnt “original” enough <@!302063351767498752>
no idea is truly original so if something is a derivative work or similar, you shouldnt worry about it being too similar to something
keep developing keep working keep coming up with ideas for it
so dont abandon it
that something else wasn’t how you did it or how you would do it
so even if the concept is already used somewhere else
nobody will do it the way that *you* will
even if it wasnt original it can still be unique because it’s *your* idea
keep developing keep working on your idea
dont just abandon an idea because something similar was already done
just because the structures or how the powers worked werent as original as you thought doesnt mean it’s bad
<@!302063351767498752> dont ever ever *ever* abandon an idea just because it wasnt as original as you thought
i’ve been saying multiple times that i’d totally watch it
just because it’s been done before doesnt mean it’s bad
dont scrap it lectric
nooo
the feelings behind a fight are what make a fight rather than the fight itself
it gives it more weight and generally is just cool
yeye
~~ryuki’s plot is also a battle royal for a wish like fsn so that’s why i was using it as an example~~
now this isnt me knocking your idea lectric, i think a toku/mahou shoujo this thing would be super cool and fun
hell back to tokusatsu like kamen rider and ultra man, build had a bit of it, and i think one of the newer ultra mans also had it
and madoka sorta
which is another battle royal with them fighting each other i think
there’s also magical girl raising project
granbelm was pretty good but yeah
like
no
what picrew
i use the site all the time, but i want the specific character maker
gimmie a link to the picrew you used to make these characters
oc? or is it a character from something, if so where?
if you arent then dont
if you're willing to disclose
ah why so
sankyu
well it was solo who did it
here
instead of y'know
no like i was asking them to talk about sex stuff in nsfw
can you chat about sex shit in the nsfw tab
maybe?
AUID;S;AIUSVB;AIUB
yare yare
is Miku mikiya in this situation
heheh
long haired bikki nice
should this be in the fancontent tab?
rip maria
her only example was top dad so it would make sense
that image seems like it could make good fic material, though i probably wouldn't write it
hmmm
?
would be interesting
oooo alchemist hibiki maybe?
yeah
mom
lydian student nastaja?
punch beams are cool
we could always use more writers in fancontent
fanfics are always good here
that serena is good
long haired bikki is good
oh wait did they draw the bird because bikki's screech during the bikki miku basa date sounded like a rooster screech?
bird
a lot of people do suffering here, it's nice to have fluff once and a while
before one retires to take care of the child
well maybe that's there  last tour together
well arent there a lot of children with both parents as active celebrities? i'd imagine it's something like that
since her and her wife are on stage
imagine the last one as ogawa babysitting basa's child
kamen rider is a kids show
and realized that there was a lot more evidence that Mirai was the one that was supposed to parallel Kushe
though initially i did think that Liko was supposed to parrellel Kushe, until i looked into it a bit more
yeah
like they have the same eye color, and Liko's goal at the end is to become principle, among others
and also there are several points that she's the one who's supposed to paralell Kushe
i know right
in a very very "This might cause me to fall" kind of way
when she's talking about how she doesnt care about the world or saving it and only about her friends
and im pretty sure she's the one who's supposed to parrellel kushe
like she has a lot of lines that are *very* worrying when she says them
like they legit kinda put hints that mirai might turn evil at some point or something, and she has a surprising amount of depth that i have   analyzed probably way more than i should of, but like the hints are there, it's just toei are cowards
Mirai is one of my favorite characters like in general, she's honestly super interesting, but like the writers didnt do enough with her
yeah that was great
mana had a harem
but yeah
not developing several characters as much as others
though it did have a bit of a problem being too plot heavy
doki doki is one of my favorites too
my fav was Mahoutsukai, but it is definetly not one of the best writing wise
though none of those are my favorite season actually
in my personal opinion the best ones writing wise were Go Princess, Heartcatch, and Suite
yeah probably
but like the same writer wrote Go Princess, which in my opinion is the over all best written one (though not my favorite), and like i think it might of been them getting a little too ambitious
then stopped a little over halfway through
had a good solid start
the movie was kinda pretty much what the series was like
and im not really sure why the writing dipped kinda
but then after Biburi and Julio were done it kinda stopped somehow
like it had one of the strongest starts any precure has had in my opinion
but just after that it kinda stopped from me at least
it was really good before hand though
eh, kirakira kinda fell off for me after glaive and elisio were introduced
suite is a good precure season
kk
oh yeah one of the three i mentioned above is kinda that demographic too
i have like three that i've been toying with/planning
that's always fun
oh nice
just an idea?
got something planned?
also Vi why'd you wanna know about fanworks being for all things
yeah
yep
yeah, not my favorite and not one that i would consider writing wise super solid, but it was a joy to watch
yeah Smile when it wanted to could be really really good
in Smile Yayoi was a tokusatsu fan
and Kamen rider is marketed to around the same age range as precure
yeah that's what i wwas saying
kanade looks like Hibiki in that photo
oh yeah
?
oh okay
wait you watch precure?
what are those from?
it's a parody of G's album covers i think
i watched the first like two episodes before nopeing out of there
when did she show up in the anime?
black gungnir hibiki
if we wanna dev this more we could move to <#357682999300718592>
yeah
both she and kanade lived, except kanade doesnt know she survived
or
yeah exactly
and i think it'd be interesting if she lived in a timeline
but fanfiction exists, so someone could write something with her in it
yeah
well
i think it'd be interesting...
at least
...that'd be very interesting...
oh okay
should that go in <#336297808221044736>
MAria looks really small in that pic
Dess!
oh makes sense
why do people seem to ship kanami and yume?
i think at some point i thought of an au that was exactly that,  or just saw someone saying something about an au like that, the concept is familiar
oh interesting
late happy birthday from me
oh nice
wait it was your birthday recently? or are you just saying
early halloween avatars?
but carol's like way older
kanade in hubiki
is that madoka in gear style
hmm?
oh okay
wait does kriisa have two i's or two s's
KRIISA EXPLAIN
HUH
neps
Oh yeah this maria costume
didnt you already post that?
why's there a legit photo of kanade and tsubasa
oh my god so it is a referance
Okita!
yep
?
they havent really
not really
i mean aoi's interacted with playmaker so that kinda counts? i guess?
if regular fate/ does an xover with gfl in gfl then it probably wouldnt cause any problems
germain also had to do it against a nuke while kanade only had to do it against a couple of noise
where's the pic?
shirabe's hand looks funny
no idea what happens in her event because nobody translated it
sharon i think is her name
she's a character from xdu
actually that's not elfnein
isnt there actually gonna be an xover event
nah that gives pain though
tiny
oh i have a friend who really really really likes that show
where
when tsubasa and maria are still alive
all
(that was supposed to be sent before you talked about the other idea)
(sorry if stuff is sending late internet's being weird)
oh that could work too
kanade and tsubasa made a band, but after a tragic accident in the concert kanade dies, and then eventually hibiki tries to start making a band inspired by them so then basa initially gets angry but then eventually joins
is kanade still dead?
she means <#407060923078017026>
dess
ooo cute
long haired miku
ooo
yes
that one isnt her being yandere
faust robe bikki?
it was though promoted as just theater kids so you can imagine the surprise watching the first ep
it's hard to describe
theater kids
floof
also tell them what happens to the person miku is
who is hibiki here
yukimura's last stand was against tokugawa ieyasu right?
and shirabe's oichi as i guess a joke
also oichi is nobunaga's little sister right?
and what wfc said
no the faceshape is finé's
yeah the final on is finé
underrepresented would probably be better to say
too many images to locate?
dmjii!!
that small kiri should be an emote, it just looks like one
i think that's hibiki with a spear
dess
aka, solo's favorite character
dmjii!
kirika
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
wait kanade ashes?
<#336297808221044736> ?
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/senkizesshousymphogear/images/d/da/ClearfilesGXLive.png/revision/latest?cb=20160519144417 this image was what i was talkign about, i cant find a better version
oh cool
and leg
ow her back
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
big
baby
EEVEE
in the miku event she goes to another world
yeah it's an alternate bikki from xdu
dess._timeline
dess.._timeline
timeline
dess timeline
just because something doesnt have anything to do with the plot doesnt mean it's a bad inclusion
so that means they didn't rehire the vas
they dont talk at all in axz, and only show up at the very end
but they did show up briefly
they didnt rehire their vas in axz
beef stroganaff
miku and hibiki's three regular friends
yumi itaba, kuriyo, and shiori
oh the three stooges are there
i love how like two of the characters here are dead
of course they can still be enjoyable though
glasses
Serena!
yeah that's her sis
i mean there are some characters who wouldnt die even if they were killed
mirai is my fave
i liked maho girls/mahoutsukai
nice! smile's pretty good
which is your favorite?
i've watched all of them except for 3/4's of the original (including max heart here), half of splash and all of yes5
hugtto was very good
did someone mention precure
ye
yeah
not the ship that you'd expect
from seasons g and onward
same director
and that's only counting those that are actively counted, if we count the ones that dont show up in xover events, then there are even more
yeah there are lot
same va
or it's just from twitter
so i think it's a pun
the japanese text says nakimori
arent all the main rangers like reds
it's yugioh
can someone send me the image this <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> is based on?
i forget when but i clearly remember her going oyoyoyoyo
i remember kirika going oyoyo before
grasshopper theme
uhhhh
zero one has a uhhh
yeah that's zero one i think
padoru padoru
how she would've turned out without miku to hold her basically
an alternate universe version of bikki who didnt have miku after the concert
from xdu
hibimiku vampire au!!!
an r-18 doujin
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
sop with a cat
cat
one of her designs reminds me of serena
oooh okay
is that ame no habakiri miku
ufufu
yes
does anyone have a pic of that one serena and miku memoria in xdu
heartcatch or go princess precure are the best starters in my opinion
depends on what you like
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
longhaired bikki <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c4_22LjGQo
OOOOOOO
oooooo
yooooo
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> judai
softbasa
edgebasa did you mean
*whoops*
when she gave her the armor she begged hibiki not to lose herself to hate and despair apparently
longhair bikki <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
imagine
hibimiku or hibichirs as eiji and ankh
~~imagine it with hibiki tho~~
HTAT'S A RLY GOOD GARIE WHOA
<@!186660127825330177>
<@!445783190976856065>
<@198715267994353665> there’s a buncha villainess art posted
it's one of the best events give it a read
i love this one
yes the big ship
precure!
suships
god i love yugioh cards
same va
best ship
where they actually teach more about the strategy of the game
that's the mc of the structure deck manga
~~that's not a sevens character~~
||also im crying||
best ship
!!!! villainess fanart!
in extra material
i think it's cause they have a duet
ecclesia!
why disgust
sankyu
<@!263983345669505025> got any pics of Kanade's sister?
eyyyy mai otome
just in a higher year then the rest
unless im remembering wrong and the school in madoka is a hybrid highschool/middle school, mami is also a middle schooler
i feel like that's nsfw
~~i mean later she becomes okay with it haha~~
bronyaselle?
idoru seele
those are pretty big differences
i mean hair and how she holds herself
same va
oh voice actor jokes lol
JP
this doesnt look very sfw
i think that’s a bit nsfw
whomst?
the anime is a rly bad adaptation lol
oh hey it’s my crackship
*is currently reading the raw jp novels*
very much so
yes
sorry if that notified you
oh whoops
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
it's not hard
it's literally just play fsn, watch zero, and then go wherever from there
wow there is a fuck ton of ruri dragon art out there huh
lyco reco!
to the point where she makes multiple appearances in flashback or as kinda a mind ghost for basa
i mean, her presence looms over the entire season one
i was gonna say G but im not sure
i forget which one
she played it in a season i think
so these arent the villains, they are a fake out most likely
all the foreshadowing points to the custodians showing up
obviously
what if, the last song they sing in the series, is called Last Love Song
oh god her neck
it looks really good
xv cover art
ooo
that's false
no it wasnt
waht
oh! it's called that because of her thing about birthdays
so that's why i messed it up
i thought the de was a partical there for a moment
ooh okay
rode the happy bus is what kirika's b side this time roughly translates too
and yeah
oh god kirika's b side's title
same with four
season three was just hibiki
season two only maria, chris, and hibiki's b sides
season one everyone's B sides played at some point
yeah ver can probably make one
symphogear eds are always bangers
it might be good to just put it under spoiler tags is what i'd think?
ooo
holy shit that b-side doesnt sound like a meme song?
holy shit that first song
since song release order for xv
it's more likely gonna be kirika
ooh okay
wait is episode 2 out?

OH
oh
are there any new keywords
she came back in the s1 finale
yeah bikki saved her
in an abandoned school with a lot of gas masks
since one of the shots in the opening is a young serena and maria standing
serena and maria's backstory looks like it'll actually be explored more/important this season
yeah Steve?'s name has a question mark at the end
but i'd need to check the spelling in japanese
probably the latter
seeing somethings flaws and still enjoying watching does not equal turning off your brain and enjoying it
but like they didnt shatter unless prolonged touching
they still got damaged sure
completely
like that's how they had a back and forth, it's only once it touched it for a while that they broke
also like not all of her swords shattered instantly
wasnt it written by someone different than the first game?
ah
wasnt xenosaga also supposed to be like six games
why are you getting so angry at someone just saying they disagree with your opinion
yeah
yeah i noticed that too
while also thinking about delicious glazed donuts
i hate that i had to think a bit on which girl you were referring to before remembering what happened
most likely she wont be a receptor child but if she is that'd be
she's the youngest, and used to be a test subject
okay i found it and
someone translated it a while back but i cant find it
quick what does her page on the website say
but you also act like anyone who doesn't think things you think are stupid are stupid it feels like
as well as acting like symphogear can do absolutely nothing clever at all and denying anyone who says they liked an aspect you didnt
hush you
there's a fine line between criticizing something while enjoying it and dunking on it at basically every oppurtunity you can
not directly call it trash no
had a duet
and chris
tsubasa
also in gx
those are unisons
since the beginning
that have been there
remember the trio songs
hey wait a minute
wait if you accept that it's a hyperbole what are you even arguing
it could be a hyperbole?
kiri's birthday is mine in some parts of the world
oh right
yeah the verse is serena
~~i think sparkle has gone on record and said she highly dislikes tsubamari if i remember right~~
it's very well written, i personally dont like it that much but it's good
god i need carol's new song now
"A MIRACLE? DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH... I'M THE MURDERER OF MIRACLES!
SHE'S BACK!
CAROLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yeah, i hope she gets a new form
~~unless elfnein eyes are just an animation error like the people not coming back~~
and possibly also why she stayed small
that'd explain why she still has elfnein eyes
why would we do that?
what?
why would we delete the discord just because the show's done?
no???
unless im remembering it wrong
after the transformation
she still has ssj's aufwachen behind her i think
i cant wait for the lasting song long version comes out because it sounds really good
they also have miracle lights
s.o.n.g. looks at the audience and tells them it's time to wave the miracle lights
does anyone have the clip where she screams that?
"SYMPHOGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"
oooh okay
gotcha
ooooh okay
like she didn't know what it was?
well didn't she act super shocked when she saw it?
she didn't realize x-drive was a function which was part of her downfall but it's important that she didn't know she built it in cause as mel said
hell even compared to autoscorers
compared to a complete relic, or even faust robe they just are very miniscule
zesshou's are literally like really really impractical, and at the time that was the only known final attack/most powerful thing they could do
yeah like
a lot of them
well chris did awaken it
but like
well also to awaken the cane
now that i think about it
chris's gear was probably a backup plan if they both got killed actually
see if she'd go on living as a living relic or something
probably not tell bikki about it and see what happened
oooh yeah good point
i think kanade dying was probably just an extremely happy accident for her as basa was probably a better test subject in the first place for her high sync rates as well
oooh
who's cloister
there are nine, who's who
though im sure kimi dake ni would be how still
WHAT IF THAT'S HOW THEY GET MIKU BACK
what if that's how they
so fucking hype
that'd be
oh god
they're always so hype
i love the aufwachen versions of the theme songs
which roughly translates to big bro
also he's not really stupid for that? politics are messy you know
but it already makes sense
holy shit everything happens in such a short timespan in axz
i remember thinking like
i think
axz
amalgam is no longer banned
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
BASA'S B SIDE PLAYING AS WELL
THE EPSIDOE
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
miku in the dress untransformed
oh also
i think fudou's in custody now
basa's had a rough time all season
or something like that
the alchemy stuff works on life energy
something something
uhm
at now
mmmmm
there are a lot of decisions in axz that have me going
not good
mmmm
that was
backfire on the fools stone usage
oh and i just remembered the like
the reason in axz was like that the alchemists just have a win button against it right?
instead of whatever ignite was like
an actual significant power up
amalgam is like
oh another thing im enjoying
what's that?
pgsm?
grossly inaccurate
that is
strategist
also isnt she their like
i just wasnt familiar with the acronym
yeah i've heard of it actually
gotcha
oooh okay
and s1
and also saved them from a situation that would've not happened if he wasnt there
if she's reviving her with gungnir that is an exceptionally dumb thing to so
what reason would they have to know that
shem ha doesnt know that
but like
oh right that
i doubt it would happen
yeah
casually gives basa more trauma in one season
kanade
wow
the s1 ost has what now?
that is a one percent to a five percent
i guess they're memeing?
any other ones of note?
like the one at the end of s1
if yatsuhiro isnt dead i’ll riot
it really has been sixty episodes
oh god
show’s not over, miku might come back
y
hmmm
a bit much
yeah that sounds like
~~unless you had japanese subtitles~~
fudou has a catchphrase?
oh wow
~~or bikki ultrasuper mode~~
why?
wh
>Just Loving X edge
technically fudou was behind behind them
and yeah
~~she’s NR’s strategist~~
a bad iseaki protag
he sounds kinda like
no offense
yeah like
and yeah what solo said
i dont see what this has to do with the convo
and yeah me neither
just a powerful magic user eh? how’d he gain immortality
that’s effectively a god
and he is immortal, god is afraid and basically
yeah you cant die anyway
the sumerian beliefs about demons and devils
er
what was the sumerian understanding of devils
oooh okay
the existence of demons doesnt imply that of a devil
okay so
specify what you mean by fix
how does he interact with the plot
okay so first thing, what’s zino’s motive and what is the *why* he’s a villain
at most nine
guess how many main fighters are in gear
another thing that makes thanos work is he’s the main villain of a series that ***has an enormous cast***
different things work in different stories
and what they’ll do to bring her back
the interesting part and the core of the story is how hibiki’s betrayal has affected everyone
okay let me put this into these terms, in related to a fic you read and enjoy dino

So, in My Sunshine, the interesting part ***is not*** that hibiki cannot lose
like
but like
yeah exactly
like
yeah he’s just
making a character powerful does not make them interesting
no we’re doing it now, c’mon i want to see what this is all about
fuck it, im going to regret this but tell me in dms if you really have to
explain it again since we’re trying to develop it
just spoiler tag em?
actually, mel? if we take this to <#357682999300718592> what should we do about like xv spoilers
from what im seeing
there is literally next to no reason to make this a timetravel plot
why’s timetravel needed here
okay so
what are dino and zino
so
okay?
how does this affect things
second off
okay? first off, who’s dino
...
also, why was zino a part of this war
how did they become gods
was zino one of these humans? and if so
what is the forgotten war
what did he do in the forgotten war
for what reason does she fear him
why does she fear him
how does he plan on doing it
what is the how
in the second ep it's passed
in the first ep
chris's b-day specifically is coming up
season five takes place in winter
bikki's b-day is in fall
well it was a function of like uhhhh the gear
where are you getting dmjii still being on earth
also uhhhh
yeah the arm regen was relic cancer
ye
just required very specific activation conditions so
according to elfnein/carol
crunchy spoils xv
crimson dragon
ooh okay
we saw a tiny version fly away
i saw someone say millarc died and that's not true
being the vambrace
but still needs an activation key
like shem-ha is in all of humanity
i think it might be like how fine needs the aufwachen to awaken
you cant make a good excuse for a ghost of her to show up for amalgam
she’s still important but like
like
kanade wouldnt even appear for a ghost i’d think
seven/eight vocal first love song
six/seven vocal first love song
“That is the story of how six girls sacrificed themselves for the sake of the world. The people vowed to never let their sacrifice be in vain. They would never forget the immense power of love. They say, if you look up at the moon on a clear night... You’ll surely hear a song of blessing, raining down from the stars above. The end.”
on a clear night, you can hear a song
~~shem ha’s evil twin who’s twice as evil and ten times as powerful~~
he would’ve prolly just let n be a puppet leader
though, ghetsis only revealed the true plan after he thought n was no longer useful
it’s not even that much of a loose end tbh
not in the series which literally has two episodes left
yeah it’s better for a movie
didnt read that right
oh wait sorry
shem ha defected from them
if there was a sequel series spinoff thing it’d prolly just start with a series not in a movie
you know, that’s what people are paying to see more likely than not if they go to a movie of a series
but it’d still focus around the main girls because
they’d make a cameo hinting at their existence
if there’s a sequel series, they wouldnt start off in the movie i’d think
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
SEASON ONE TAGLINE AT THE END OF THE EPISODE
it isnt touched on in xv because it wasnt needed, we already have basically as much as we need on it
and that isnt a bad thing
but we basically got all we needed of shirabe’s origin from that ep in axz aramdos i have no idea what you’re on about
it doesnt need to be explictly stated for us to recieve it armados
we already got that
they were a big part of a recent xdu event
in xdu
ye
because they dont have a duet?
please dont use the R slur
it could be her mom's side
not necessarily
well
but that's easy to miss
it's in the keywords
if i remember my key words right
technically the god-killing also according to the keywords why bikki can hit through multiple universes was because of her armed gear of "connecting hands" combined with the god killer
it flipped arms
who's anu?
it was confirmed yes
some people might not spoiler tag so be very careful
yeah all of the cds op and ed have b sides
depending on how it goes, im placing my bet that kimi dake ni might be the ed song
final little outro as the end song plays
other half fighting shem ha shem ha
half ep fighting miku shem ha
we dont know how any of nr are i think
why'd i say translate
not translate
i meant adapt
and chris's parents
the one with mjolnir girl
uhhhh
another one to translate would prolly but like
the one who looked like elfnein
and stuff
that one girl who nobody bothered to translate anything about
uhhh
werent there also like
what's xd quest?
huh
oh
yeah like i could’ve sworn it was a different song
GUH GUH GUH WAS THAT THE CURSED FIC SCREENSHOT
if characters didnt have plot armor then it’d be a pretty shitty story
all characters are plot devices because they drive stories
wh
not for the other seasons that are not xv
or like a design sheet in the artbook
didnt they also translate that one other sword as heavencloud
heavenrend
heavenrend
TWO WEEKS
NOOOOO
oooh that makes more sense
no
xv
xtreme vibe
the anime is bad
yeah like
if you watch prillya i will judge you
DONT
NO
and then watch hf
~~read stay night instead~~
zero is a prequel
also okita has an ahoge
there is a pov watson
the sherlock character to be more precise
yeah as the main character
gosick is very good, especially if you like mysteries
nasuverse as a whole is super dark
tsukihime, the thing type moon thought would be their main series
miku’s name is written with the future kanji
it’s a pun
god damn
im just gonna pretend ver wasnt there
true
like melua said
it was probably just va problem that she didnt have a line or two in that last scene
not ashita no flugel
ashita e no flugel
ye
im happy yet surprised that like nr didnt get a song
that wasnt a stand it was a mecha ref
elfnein did
carol did not
since that almost ruined the scene for me
one was a backup
write
write write
XV
ALSO Xtreme Vibes
i didnt ashita e no flugel also has different lyrics but i might be wrong
ye
~~or if you’re using the kanji, future~~
because it like ends up promoting the thought that if you’re made to think about something that it’s a bad thing
also cinemasins isnt good for analysis either
why are you so obsessed with the miku transformation
i also kinda wish they were two separate songs so they were longer for each part
honestly if someone played the full song and told me they were playing two songs i’d prolly believe em
the first half was used as an ed
well they cut out the first half in the episode
dino’s locked out of other channels other than the xv ones i think
you dont need to post it to a chat in discord you can post it to a website
also ff.net
so it’s pretty likely
axz had one more keyword update after ep 13
i mean, if i remember right
oh wait keywords yeah
yeah what’s happening tomorrow
wait but the gears are destroyed i think
~~resource pack~~
moira
i assume dino said something before deleting it
episode one had a big fight though
especially when most of your critiques are literally nitpicks
ah ye those’d be good
please dont speak for other people dino
what are your number one and two mel?
next destination i think right?
god g’a ed was great
xv’s cliffhangers worked better since most actually like meant something
stop this
and if someone with the curse puts it on they die
but she needed to use it to possess miku
if you still have the curse and put the bracelet on it kills you
though
carol also is still around probably, same with the illuminati
shem ha is also here
what would they even be talking about other than that
i dont even know what mental gymnastics they’d have make to deny the ending
did dino delete the initial text again
it was discussed a while back
in interviews i think
it was retconned
i guess you cant really do the bait and switch in this game
i mean
wait what
okay then
to specifically write watch symphogear on them?
do you have permission?
dude
wha
<-hasnt updated in literal months
what do we get coins by doing
so it's not just a mod thing?
wait we can do that?
ah, kk just was wondering
is there a trading system
more typos?
is there any benefits to multi rolls now?
just roll?
oh so no more reserving coins needed
serena
i know i've asked this before but to hive coins to others what was the command again
you didnt notice this?
wait really
and reason is not needed
name must be a ping
it said you can trade them in for generic tokens
so it'd kinda be pointless
well it says you'll be able to trade them in for any card
kk
?
what do tokens do
has sparkle got kirika yet
rv_mycardlist 2
rv_mycardlist
rv_pull "Grand Opening" 3
that's weird
huh, might be an error only on my end then
kk, i'll just leave that here so she sees
it's funny because it crashed on a pull of serena
it didnt give me a message that it saved one of the cards i pulled and didnt give me the last pull
saki did your bot crash
oh kk
<@!102691114762371072> kriisa are you ever gonna add memoria to the gatcha
dess_$
no i think earlier solo made a thousands of coin transaction to sparkle
i keep getting the same fucking kirika
oh she still does that
dess
<@431656503490117632>
i've pulled this card literally five times now
that's the one that keeps showing up
rv_mycard I'm bad at names, but I dont actually think kirika is a shit waifu i just think sparkle-chan's waifu is shit
the one that shows up most of the time is actually
that the thing keeps giving me kirikas
is this karma for me naming that card that
rv_mycard Sparkle-chan's waifu is shit
rv_mycard Sparkl-chan's waifu is shit
rv_mycardlist 3
rv_mycardlist
rv_mycardlist 2
rv_mycardlist
<@!137113218173632512> TELL YOUR WAIFU TO STOP SHOWING UP FOR ME
4 kiri tokens
i've pulled kirika thirteen times
13 kirikas
i have a lot of kiritokens
and the same ones too
i keep pulljng them
stop giving me kirikas
dess_$
dess_timely
she's still good
kirika's probably my least favorite gear user though
i have a ton of kirika tokens
help, the game keeps giving kirikas and i dont know what to do

it was more making fun of sparkle
rv_mycardlist
1%
no spaces is the name you put i think
rv_mycardlist
wow you got pretty much exactly who you wanted with that art didnt you
rv_mycardlist 2
rv_mycardlist
rv_mycard Kanade
rv_mycard kanade
oh okay
actually i dont remember how this works
you need to set a flagship first i think if i remember right
i say go see a doctor, it might get worse if you dont
wasnt Fenrir also Loki's kid in norse mythology
it only served to make people mad
but like, exposing your point of view contributed nothing to the discussion Langou
yeah, it's pretty calm now
dreams are fun
anything else you can remember?
but also that's only some people, not everyone is the same and you shouldnt base your judgement and use on one person
okay so, some people reclaim slurs and that's fine
oh shit that's what the image means
oh yeah the onion browser to the dark web
woah it came back online
yeah it is, do people know the problem yet
why do you talk in first person
would you be thrown into another timeline or would everyone else have looped but didnt remember it as well
same here
she only asked if we'd miss her
we were never asked for advice
yep
(maybe you should move this to a different chat like <#377148557796442134> or <#371105434771390465> )
it really is
what are ssris?
it was a symphogear fan thingy i think or whatever
you've never what now
i mean isnt she like a glorified baby sitter or something?
well introvert is technically just anyone who recharges by not being around people so you can still go to parties and enjoy it even if you're an introvert but yeah her claim of being an introvert is extremely dubious
"I dont think it means what you think it means"
"You keep using that word"
someone get that one image from the princess bride
so what's the current issue with her
so one of the worst kind of people
oh
what did they do this time?
the au pair was the one who told you you had to love your parents right?
most if not all of them cant see the difference between "We want genocide" and "We dont want to be genocided"
centrists are annoying for the most part
holy shit why are people so horrible about this stuff
the vic situation was a known thing for years before the recent one
for a very long time
the vic thing had been known
ugh
you
i dont know what that has to do with what rahki said at all
i
what does that say about anything?
the conversation
derail
dont
"All of these people witnessed this person murdering someone"
"I didn't do it"
"Everyone who says so has been falsifying evidence"
you're essentially saying that you need to have photographic evidence for everything or it's immediately falsified because the person denies it
and also
this report might've been falsified is a very bad sentiment for something that a lot of people and convention organizers have known for years, and have spoken about for years
and being straight up ignorant and ignoring anything else
there's a line between reasonable doubt
if it has been so many, and it has been a known thing for years at this point
but like
false accusations do exist that is true
for years before all of this
also, the stuff about vic has been known for years, it was so known that con organizers actively warned people about him
and you say you hate misinformation but to me it seems like you hate information that contradicts your view more and label it as misinformation without looking into it a bit more, `I know the difference on actual victims and the ones that are false that just do it for the sake to hurt people` but you seem to have been using an assumption that all of the accounts of the abuse that have been coming in for years on this specific topic are like that, and nothing else, and in the last part you've done is transformed this into a personal attack against yourself, you are acting like we have personally attacked you and you are putting words in my mouth if it was me you were referring when you said `you deny the existence of professional victims`, which i assure you was not what i was doing
it's just they're usually mentioned in a context to be used to diminish the actual survivor's words, and only view all of the allegations through that lense that "all of these people are lying to ruin someone's life" is a bad lense
i will fully acknowledge that they do exist
that's not what i said
i never said i denied they existed
that has almost nothing to do with your point nep, as well, false accusations tend to seem more common if you're looking for them, or because they make it into more news
two: it seems like you're just listening to the side that helps your side, and outright ignoring or saying that the other side's experiences are false or fakes
that's going down the road of discrediting many people's experiences
one
similar to stuff like sentai or kr
yeah multiple series
what happened?
yeah
yeah
yeah i think it does too
and changed to fit what people want to push sometimes
also things are lost in translation
werent you here when that happened?
thank goodness
ah, cant put it into words? or just dont wanna talk about it since that's fine as well
you wanna talk about it?
is the coffee lukewarm when you wake up?
do you know what the word documented means
zerona
DOCUMENTED
WAS
IT
what do you not get about `it was documented`
ah right
?
yeah it stared in general if i remember
not saki's
in your words niche
your experiences arent universal
documented
been
has
and it
YOUR EXPERIENCES ARE NOT UNIVERSAL
what the fuck does that even mean
im sorry
and please do not resort to self deprecation to get yourself out of this one again
fight the bird back with wholesomeness
oh, saki, you're very floofy
ooo, you're cute too
cute!
you are a real girl
what happened?
but like why are they defending jontron?
uh what? wait what?
ah
wait what happened on twitter?
but yeah it's fine to feel uncomfy
mojang has basically disowned notch, and notch hasnt really been coding the game for years at this point
okay what the fuck
what's up?
aha, you're sketch, i was wondering who you were
eat the rich
yeah but, can you really call it a remake if it's a completely different movie
they also changed massive plot elements from what i've read
and oh good for you!
from what i've read the stuff that's already been released for the mulan live action makes it sound like a massive trainwreck
oh nice!
feel free to do so
<@173112001684439040> you were typing something earlier, if you wanna continue that you can, i think the convo we were just having is done
mulan's story is pretty standard, and the changes that i've read are very very very big differences
im not gonna air all my grievances with what i've read about how they've changed it since i really do not feel like it
they should've named it something else and then i'd probably be more fine with it, but like the stuff they've changed makes me kinda go ehhh?
but like
no they're skewing it away from what i've read
mythical
there's no historical ichival
yeah
because kaneko doesnt research
it's from fire emblem
yeah
the rest are
ichival isnt
i mean
and added it into smite
and someone saw it who works on smite
yeah it was probably an edit because of gear
https://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/7rtnk8/ichaival/
it's from fire emblem
from what i gather
talking about etika's suicide really insensitively
the game theory guy

<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
why were you sitting in his room long enough to annoy him
can i ask a question
dont show them your writing
dont show them the show
then just
america likes to act like they are
but most of them originated as just fun stories to pass the time
grimm and peraut were the ones with “Morals”
that’s the beauty of em
they have many variations and evolve over time
even the grimm or peralt versions people call “the original” arent
yeye
well like my sib actually studies them so
my sibling is really into fairy tales, i pick up a lot from them
a lot of them werent meant to have themes at all, plus there arent original versions or anything as well
actually a lot of fairy tales were just stories people told to pass the time while doing activities
what the fuck????
more people care about you than you think lectric, so it’s definetely not the right choice, ever
in their mind they’ll always be that bullied kid
it lets you feel in control
power tripping is a hell of a drug
what the fuck???????
aight i was just seeing things then
was i seeing things or was there a deleted message from dino?
rping is a ton of fun
just keep practicing, you’ll get it eventually
if it matters to you then you need to be persistent at it
but that’s why you have to keep doing it
and nobody’s gonna be perfect when they start doing something
tangentially related
learning music theory and recognize pitches are like
yeah like
and it makes you look worse than artificial if you start fights, it makes you look like a massive asshole who nobody wants to talk to
to break a habit you need to start now
doing things like that reads to me like it's a form of self-harm for you, especially with how you talk about it, but also it's bordering on trolling
mhm
and get into less fights
you'll get the info
or just ask it nicer
or "Hey, I want to know why you like x"
"Hey, I want to know why people enjoy x"
try asking like
x is garbage
to ask for other opinions you should instead of saying
instigating things that will get you stressed
and to learn how to stop starting fights or doing  stuff that's really really similar to self-harm by intetntionally like
i think you need think about how to ask why people like things better
lectric
dont apologize for coming back, honestly i like seeing you around here
real quick
define punishment
also arent you not an english speaker natively? i remember you mentioning it though correct me if im wrong
the US investigation system is also extremely fucked up since it’s for creating a culprit rather than actually solving the crime
but you dont see there are degrees of it i feel
okay if again, this is by your definition of punishment
that doesn’t mean the lack of punishment
it’s purpose should be to reform in my opinion
okay, now that that’s clear what people actually mean when they talk about punishment (and we dont go into pointless discussions on semantics), i agree with kerrik’s definition as the ideal of how it should end up
but i want this conversation to be as clear as possible
i do lean towards the former
why do you, no why does this system decide people’s worth or value to live
you mean like someone with depression? who doesnt have the energy to even get up in the morning? are those people just lazy
why do you get to be the arbiter of people’s worth or if they deserve to live
what do you expect them to do
if you’re already at rock bottom and dont have any real ways to come out of it
maybe you should learn it
understanding the reasoning behind actions is a good skill
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
for what? because there is no way to tell the difference by outside viewing
if you deny the whole system just because of these people, you’re condemning many to die
but
i never denied it in the first place
i am not denying it
just because lazy people will use it, doesnt mean that we should deny thw whole thing
so?
you dont know what’s lead them to this point
you dont know how their lives been
you cant tell the difference really
but
you cant tell the difference so why the hell should you bar everyone for the sins of a few
there is no fucking way you can tell
nobody deserves to die ***will you deny those who need it just because some dont***
and how in the world are you supposed to tell the two apart, should you deny *everyone* just because of some
“I am sorry that what I said upset you”
this is known as a non-apology
^
it's locked
oh yeah, yeah the costume does look pretty weird
fourze was really good
i've only watched W, OOO, and Fourze (and parts of build) and i love all of them
(since ru doesnt work on rabb.it)
which kissanime url though
kk
hey <@284390402210136064> which anime streaming site do you use when streaming anime on rabb.it
kk
which kissanime do you usually use to stream in rabb.it
especially with nanoha and fate adopting a kid together
and she got adopted by her and changed her last name
cause she got adopted
yeah
lives with nanoha
wait fate's not married
yeah we're not
oh huh
it keeps a pretty consistent dark tone throughout, that one
if i remember right, it stops being as bloody, but like yeah it still has a lot of death
it's super dark yes, but it's also quite good
it's fun
i actually liked that anime a lot
daybreak illusion
yeah that one
or is it a different series you're talking about
the really super dark one?
wait is it that one magical girl anime?
oh okay
kissanime now senses if you use ublock apparently
i meant ublock, but you can also use adblock
you can use adblock on 9anime if you use your computer
what cite are you using
which actually has stuff further from where the vivid anime ends
you could read the vivid manga
i mean
it's thirteen episodes if i remember
a full series
is the full name
magical girl lyrical nanoha ViVid i think
since gen was the head writer for gaim
oh okay
because if it's gen then oh boy
or someone who just worked on gaim
gen urobuchi?
what
part 5 has a lot of really creative fights
which anime
and the well written rivals are usually their own characters, badly written ones arent
usually they also are used to be a foil to the hero
that too
rivals are more used to be a goal for the hero to eventually beat and take down i think, or alternatively they can be someone who the hero bounces off of with so they both end up growing as people, constantly striving to be better than the other while growing as people because of one another
i mean, if you're going for nihilism i'd say that could be an apt way to kill a character, but only if it's done in a way that it makes sense, like a character who desperately wants to be important, or wants to have a death facing someone of importance so they could die heroically could be poetically killed by just a generic person
yeah i've heard of the toku sailor moon live action
<@!137113218173632512>
i think there is a difference somewhere in there
the songs are important for characterization as well
and yeah
i didnt really find many of lost song's songs that special personally, but that might just be a me thing
later seasons the songs become great though, at least in my opinion
through the songs
yeah, you watch it for the characters but it's been going on so long because it's marketable
as a series
and the songs are a big part of gear
most arent though
it doesnt have the songs subbed and season four isnt there
i'd say
actually it's one of the worst
crunchy isnt the best place to watch gear
crunchy
ah
?
where are you watching it
which is why i dont think gear has been dubbed
and sometimes dialogue
for character
and the songs subs are important kinda
yep
since if you're watching it on crunchy crunchy doesnt have the fourth season
oh yeah where are you watching gear btw
symphogear's music was so good and it punctuates so many awesome scenes
i like the characters in gear and am a huge music nerd, and magical girl fangirl so it was basically something i was guaranteed to at least like a lot
so
connection and communication and how it's never really wrong to try to listen to someone
i like the theme of connection in gear it's fun
yeah not really
the fourth season isnt on crunchy
also you might wanna track down fansubs early because
well not every song in later seasons are subbed on crunchy
because of how the mechanics of the gears work
yep
also cg isnt inheriently bad
trigger makes things look good with pretty low budget too
that's because people who dont know anything about animation tend to think animation smears and actual good animation techniques are bad
trigger is really really good at animation
it's a trigger anime afterall
the animation itself looks fine i think
well, fate/ zero is a prequel
isnt the ubw anime not the best
huh, cool
*mollusks*
kk, so there arent much differences gameplay wise in that then?
also does realta nua use the the same engine as og fsn or no, is that a cap from realta nua?
fsn also has full voice acting right?
might not be coded the same
but the engine look is similar
well, makes sense
oh so kinda like the engine when they cry uses except with the box not covering the edges of the screen
ah
what's the engine look like?
which engine does fsn use actually
doesnt it not autoplay?
cant you set speeds on the vn's engine
each of the routes are wildly different arent they?
actually
ubw is also the second route
you want another anime to watch?
gopri does it pretty well, but it could've probably been done a bit better but it's better than dokidoki's vicitm of the week
hugtto's victim of the week ranges from dokidoki level to heartcatch level depending so it's like the middle
and yeah, heartcatch definitely is the best at victim of the week
we're talking about precure in general
dokidoki also probably did victim of the week the worst out of all of the victim of the week seaosns
yeah dokidoki is great with that
i mean out of the ones that actually get development
not my favorite but it has a lot of good moments, and characters
dokidoki is also pretty good
the other part why i like it so much we'd be here literally all day if i got into so i wont
maho's main strength is it's really really really emotionally charged moments i think, which it has a lot of towards the end, which is part of why i like it so much
smile was good too, it also had probably the best humor out of any of them
im not including hugtto because i dont want to include it until the series is over
out of the ones that are complete (meaning all but hugtto) the three best written ones imo are heartcatch, gopri and suite
i wont really go on about why i love maho so much because we'd be here all day
my second favorite is probably gopri and suite, but heartcatch is also very good
but it's my favorite for a number of reasons i could go on about
it's objectively not the best written one
my favorite is actually maho
hahah
and that's fine, but like there are a lot of good moments in it, but if it's not your thing that's fine
but like, it does get several moments of tension later on
and im not gonna tell you to finish it because there were probably some things you didnt particularly like in it probably which is why you didnt finish it
it's probably cause you didnt finish the whole thing though
false imo
your point on maho is kinda
however
one: your point on dokidoki is pretty valid though a little debatable so i wont argue with you there
alright let's see
im gonna go to sleep but in the morning expect more shit from me
oh so we're doing this tonight okay
so
all seasons have moments of tension
i mean
yeah
all precure eds are fun imo
in case you thought it was coming out of nowhere just this year or something
it's been known for a while
this has been going on for years too
should we move to <#377148557796442134> or  no
oh uh
and i got downright annoyed at several points during the middle
but it's so contrived
i mean it's not pointless
the middle is pointless
one? two? redeemable aspects
there are like uhhh
i actually fucking hate the sequel for the most part
go from this to the prequel and then the sequel basically
are you watching blind?
||also the main character eats a vertex at one point||
i've heard good things about it
the prequel prequel is apparently really good and needs to get an anime
pointlessly so
like
but yeah hero arc is so contrived for drama
||and these are a thing||
we're being vague so i guess it's fine
i mean
because i know there's one coming out for the mobile game this year
wait which one the mobile game anime or the next season
true, yeah that makes sense
it's impartial
it isnt evil it just seems evil because it's goals are against the protagonists
yeah kyubey is neutral
whenever i see daisuke ono now, even though i watched jjba first, i can only thing of USHIROMIYA BATTEEEEER
oh right wasnt there a big thing
giorno's just more reserved
and jonathan is easily more boring
as well, giorno's not gonna show up after this
not really
as well
i mean, it still took a lot to get giorno requiem
i liked it
this one https://nyaa.si/view/489811
yeah purple haze feedback was what it was called
the fugo one
i like it
whatever it was called
feedback
i really liked purple haze distortion
it might also be the light novel i read that takes place after the part that makes the part one of my favorites
i'd also argue that being defeated by requiem was a pretty fitting end for diavalo but like dont feel like it right now
plus, giorno's not exactly gonna show up in another part, so you dont need to worry about the stand being overpowered in anywhere else other than the very end of part five
he's not in your face like the others, especially the ones before him
but i think that's very interesting
he's always in the background thinking
part one is a fist of the north star clone for the most part
it's tied part 4 and 7 for me
because i know it can be done super well
there are some amazing dubs, and i dont hate the idea of dubs
though
it's mostly the voice director's fault that a lot of dubs fall flat
just say you dont like gridman instead of phrasing it like that, it sounds way more pretentious if you say it like that
cgi animes can be very good
why not just use kissanime with the necessary blockers
oh i liked that a lot
like a click here to download
there should be a download button
go to the rapidshare version of the videos
if you have an account
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/a_room_for_two_ch01 <@!302063351767498752> catch
what happens in vivid strike
nanoha is a spinoff that got way more popular
look up triangle heart
nope
her family is like an assassin family (though she wasnt brought into the family business i think) nanoha is a spinoff of a vn
her parents and stuff arent brought up again because nanoha is a spinoff of a vn which nanoha is a minor character in, and her parents and siblings get more focus there
i mean, what did you expect from an isekai
if you wanna experience pandora hearts, please please please read the manga and not watch the anime
also yeah
but like
i liked hacha too
heartcatch, gopri, and the original are all good places to start
hacha
or like uhhh
dont show her yes5
no
i mean
show her any precure season those are good
~~reverse claps and all that nonsense~~
~~isnt it pretty badly explained in the mobage too, like the whole yuuna factor dealio~~
~~it'll give context for the bird at the end of s2~~
there's two i'd argue tbh but like one is a super  headcanon that i dont really feel like going into as much right here
they're also pretty good
they're actually one of the party members
they're not a villain or a joke
~~more than one i'd argue but the second one is more of a headcanon~~
yeah there is a trans coded character actually
yes
er
uhm
please dont let the like harem-y premise deter you
it's really good
please dont let the generic haremy sounding premise deter you
but like
since i like her
which is unfortunate
except one
all of the characters in general are amazing
are amazing characters
with the exception of one
all of the witches
and like
like actually
alto's a good charming kid
it's really good actually
dont let the generic harem-y set up deter you
the protag is actually likable
uhm
it's actually really well written
okay
also it is so difficult to find people in the fandom
you'll prolly like it
well you like gear dont you
YOU WHAT
recommend them symphogear
if you have a friend who likes a game called stella glow
this will never come up but
the manga is noncanon
huh
out of them, i like SG’s story the best btw, i havent played 2 but i know the general plot
the second one had two routes ye
oh wait that was the second one
oooh okay
the only thing it adds is seeing what’s similar and the such
well, you dont need the background knowledge btw, it’s a spiritual successor
you’ll like it in that case
play stella glow
i’ve only played LA1 not two, and Stella Glow
~~which is bankrupt now~~
made by the same company
it’s the spiritual successor
you’ve played luminous arc
oh
it’s not as generic as it looked, and it’s really really good
really really good
like
the dub's really good
dont do that though
i say that dubs arent inherently bad
the reason
it's pretty much
and like
it's one of the best dubs i've ever heard
really good
i've listened ot both tracks and tbh, i prefer the english because it's just
like
like it is literally amazing
the dub's amazing though
ooo
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
not sure how good the adaptation well be
the manga of the otome game rival isekai one is good
there are like a few good? ones
so many isekais
what the fuck????????
uhm
oooh okay
why are bots voting for gear?
oh i hate that type of premise
oooh so that's the difference
what's the different between super robot and giant robot?
plants
including
kill half the life on every planet
tonight's just a ton of misunderstandings huh
gotcha
ooh okay
that's a really valid reason to dislike zero tbh
i missed the context i think
the adultery part
oooh yeah that was what you were talking about
~~well it was a prequel, to fate stay night so... kiritsugu had to have reasons, because he's literally the source of shirou's ideal~~
i’d say gopri is a little better of an entry point since i’ve seen people who’ve watched heartcatch first have a bit warped expectations on other seasons but both are good entry points
or smile but smile’s kinda weird since it is considerably more episodic than the others
yeah heartcatch and gopri are the best entry points imo
i have watched all seasons but the first one, the first one’s sequel, splash star, yes5 and yes5gogo, so really you dont need to watch em in order
like i even usually recommend different starting points than the first one so
unless they have a sequel
they are standalone 49-51 episode series
you literally dont need to watch them in release order
also
the two arent mutually exclusive
most precures are both
both
there’s the otome game antagonist one that’s coming out i forget when
and streamline it more
so they could iron out the finer points
that’s probably a product of max being a direct sequel
it was so bad that toei went “Tone it back next time please”
i hear
also the sequel  fights for the original are way more violent than later seasons
the best one with how it handled victim of the week was heartcatch and the worst was doki, and the rest have varying degrees in between
since there is a difference between monster of the week and victim of the week
a few are victim of the week
well technically
just because something is motw doesnt mean it’s bad
look
all of them are
i’d also recommend it as a good start point
like it’s one of my favorites
suite’s also very good
it’s best watched after watching others
dont start with hugtto, it’s very well written but not really what you’d expect out of a precure season
heartcatch is also (now) the second darkest season, it lost its title because hugtto came out
since heartcatch took some risks that only happen other than one other series
personally though, i’d recommend gopri (go princess) because it’s very solid and probably wont give you distorted exceptions of what precure will be like
well heartcatch is the one people tend to rec as the start because it’s very solidly written and does a lot of things
i personally wouldnt watch precure in release order tbh, in fact i havent since i still havent watched some of the older series, but yeah, if you’re disappointed by one another might have something you like, and they’re all standalone
most magical girl stories, especially the deconstructy types take inspiration from it
precure is like *the* definition of magical girls in japan so
well
<@456226577798135808> admittedly i havent watched the first series, but it’ll get going eventually, trust me
mollusks
also skip all the bad porn in it
because the anime is a garbage adaptation i hear
did you at least already know of the vn
NASU
because movie two leaves out a substantial plot thread that is very interesting and fleshes out the world
watch movie one, then s2 then strikers
that's oddly specific
the second one cuts some stuff so yeah
like absolutely zero of the plot is cut in the first movie
in m1 you’re missing none of the plot
so s1 was made with that in mind and so it feels rather fillery
well nanoha started off as a spinoff of a vn
s1 is
i do think the plot thread is important for getting a better picture of the world they live in though is the thing
oh lol
it’s kinda like how AXZ is pronounced Axis
if you will <#377148557796442134>
if you wont go into spoils here i guess
it’s just an empty hand in a holding position
so that even if you're older you can still analyze them
a lot of children's shows are intellegently and well written too
and killed that case's pacing by splitting it into next ep
since they've rearragned events
that served as a kinda break from the big arc before it
was a single chapter of the manga
the whole thing
legit
the case in ep 2
i really really liked the manga so im gonna see the show through to the end
more interesting visually with better cinematography
so far the manga is better imo
hellish work culture probably does thatp
you dont need to interogate someone for disliking a chara
and yelling at someone on a public server for expressing an opinion like your doing rn that you dislike about a show is a bit immature
people are allowed to dislike things
that's also good news since i was considering dropping it as well so im gonna get back to watching it sometime tomorrow methinks
||~~the anime version i assume was meant to show you a bit of inagami's methods before the case but the case did a much better job of that in that manga imo~~||
~~that came *after* the big case they'll spend most of the anime working on~~
~~in the manga~~
~~it's because that was actually a break chapter~~
<@!431214733463519232>
^
yeah spoiler that
flip flappers is super good
which was super disappointing with how it started
yyeah it's kinda ableist later on, unfortunately
ye
im not sure if flcl is the  best thing to comepare it to since imo it has considerably more understandability and a bit more binding it together imo
also a good magical girl anime
very symbolic and a great coming of age story
plus imo the direction and adaptational aspect of it (and the changes they made to the base story) have all been super good
hm, i kinda disagree with you with a lot of the points you made kaguya, i fine iroha a very charming protagonist personally, and while we havent gotten to the supporting casts' motivations, from my experience with playing the game i'll tell you right now that im excited to see how the anime will eventually show them since they do have good ones
||"benevolent"||
overdess dont click on this spoiler
just her
yep
you forgot the part where yuuna is secretly the reincarnation of an ancient hero
by eating the vertex they end up gaining traits but also power
THREE PEOPLE
dont forget when they start eating the vertex
fu goes wild and starts to make bad decisions and lash out
and then
||she gets added don't worry||
mankai
||it's for the pain||
||ohohohohohohohohohohoho||
||ohohohohohoh||
||isnt that the early final battle||
yeah watch 5
uh
yuuna came before bikki
technically
to trap them and kill them
it's a fake thing that karin wants to convince them exists
mankai doesnt actually exist
because she wants to be a hero
she's an unreliable narrator and the whole series was her plan
you're wrong, the  time looper is actually yuuna
it's just as she says
exactly shirabe
because of her amnesia
that she forgot aboiut
and how orihime and hikoboshi are yuuna and tougo
i forgot about that
sorry
whoops
i swear im not making this up
i have a friend who could probably explain this way better than me
||because she performed a reverse clap at birth which, because of the yuuna in nowayu means you gain yuuna stuff||
||essentially from birth yuuna was known to have great hero potential or something||
||there is actually an explaination about this, it's kinda stupid but i think there was one because of extra material||
||wasnt it like||
plus kotoko is just
and one of the things that sold me on the series fully
it was simply amazing
mhm
since it was done so well and was so unique for a mystery story
i was legit blown away
when i got to her deduction
as a mystery fan when i was reading the manga
i dont get it either
do that
but this is what i think is prolly the explaination for why in the world the anime would like
im not disagreeing with you
this is the only reason i can fathom they did this
but like
yeah lol
the chapter was written to be after the first big case
unfortunately
rather than dropping you right into the first big case
an introduction to kotoko's methods
i think they wanted it as like
i have a theory about that
yeah lol
minmaxing
:3
she's a great protag
super charismatic too
let's enjoy
i assume
they're phones have the transformation app
hence why
sama
shinju
the
one island
mhm
and she also had the potential for being a miko, another yuyuyu term that you'll learn more about later
hhhhhhhhhh
hhhhh
it's bad
dont watch the second half of season two
i dont believe it
yuuna goes straight? no way
especially since we said a shit ton of completely unbelievable things
the vortex
vortex
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
OHOHOHOHOHHO
ohoho
...
THIS SCENE!!!
||yuuna is sad||
||tougou is angry||
~~should probably also read the nowayu lns before the second half of season 2~~
that would be horrible
who's to say that they wont end up losing all their memories while getting their body kept as a god
very very good
gin!
w
and they're basically the same show
i'd recommend watching the anime version since the op and ed are good
K A G A W A L I F E
LET'S ENJOY

i remember watching subbed zexal when i was younger because when i get into something i get really into it
10 to watch digimon and yugioh
my first anime really was like a digimon, i legit dug up subs when i was like
hilariously
such a good song
<@!99695384296701952> this might interest you
she's the detective in this mystery
cause
slowly dawning that she's the protagonist as i read
when i read the manga it was like
kotoko's a great protag
anyone know of any more streaming sites other than 9anime and kissanime
what ones have you watched
unless you have a lotta time to kill precure isnt that good of an idea
jjust kidding
~~precure~~
this is anime club
<#336310266654490624> <#336297674707828747> ?
with the given criteria
i’ve never seen it but does Monster count
hell dont shaft the adventure two cast in every subsequent adventure one pander
or any of the ones that came after adventure one
like tamers
pander to other seasons please digimon
mhm
at least that’s what the info i got on it said
because digimon cannot stop gen one pandering
it’s an interquel between 2 and tri
(im sure i can find one if i search hard enough)
true
instead of the normal "normal person gets the curtain pulled away" setup
which is why i think they introduced kotoko and kuro like that
and occasionally the moriarty
the detective and watson
a mystery novel,  new characters are introduced each case, with the constants being the leads
think of it like
||she disappears after that||
||cop lady is only important in the first case||
well
and yeah that's exactly how it goes krika
and the light novel probably? i think it was a light novel first before the light novel stopped being written after the manga started and the manga is now written by the original author while the artist draws it if i remember my history right?
in its proper spot from the manga
were like
snake
the first two episodes, everything but the fucking
in the manga
one chapter
i guess this just comes from knowing the snake case was like
yeah but it made the snake case slow as fuck
it should've been a one parter
also i dont agree with them for some reason cutting the snake bit into Two Fucking Episodes
like before the snake bit where they put it in the anime
in the manga
it does the timeskip right before the snake bit
of course, all of this is just subjective
true though i thought the whole deduction thing she did to kuro was a good enough thing to show the premise that this is a mystery
imo
since the first case worked as well for seeing how she does things
but still doesnt make me less bothered by it
i know why they did it
true
it's supposed to go after it as like a cooldown after you're familiar with kotoko's methods
they put the fucking snake chapter before it which is not where it goes
mhm
~~and didnt put the fukcing snake chapter before the first case where it is not supposed to be~~
~~the manga is also generally better staged in shots from what i've watched in the anime~~
like, if anything kuro is the love interest, this is especially clear in the manga
mhm
what are you talking about, kotoko is legit the main character of kyouko surui
||she's like one of those characters in a mystery who leaves after their case is done, and she wants to put her shit back together||
~~Kill la Kill~~ Magical Girl Shows + ~~Power Rangers~~ Tokusatsu shows + Mecha shows + Idol shows = Symphogear
i think it might be a ova based on the mobage
it looks like
yeah the mobage protag is here
do they have the mobage characters?
hoooh
toaru’s allegedly very good if you have enough time to, after s2, sit down and read all the light novels
isnt it super sad
also i agree that maihime was really really good
mhm
i think the third? ed was claris plus lisa or garnidelia?
if i remember correct
and three eds
openings
yeye it had two
mhm
i think the second arc is probably the best
~~i've watched the show and sorta enjoyed it too~~
~~only fifty-one out of like 192 episodes of pripara~~
it's now
if there's any timeto get into healin' good
it's very early into its lifespan
AS SOMEONE WHO WAS REALLY INTO THE GAME STORY HOLY FUCKING SHIT
HOLY FUCK
ooo
oh fizzy's back
manga spoilers ||the otome game protagonist tries to romance her too and even says the line she's supposed to say to her love interest to katarina||
ahhh
weeks?
a few like
oh i didnt see you for like
but i think if we're recommending the vn anyway
true
each of the routes building upon the previous
because they are set up in a manner that it's a three act play
you should not play the routes out of order
you
ubw is the Second Route
uhh
dont do that
nah nah nah
nah
ignore the comment, cypher's just messing about
that assumes you already watched/read the original
to an existing property
written as a prequel
it is a prequel
also
that's the best entry for the series
start with the vn, which is Fate/stay night
DO NOT START WITH ZERO
either's fine
or the ubw anime
start with the vn
or one vn
what cypher said
since nasu loves to overcomplicate
the same multiverse
~~speaking of, the anime is really good~~
that's nasu's first novel
kara no kyoukai yeah
i'll get to it on another day
i do not feel like giving my full schpeal, if anyone's interested ping me
oh hi, precure is a good show that's hard to get into
~~yes precure five is not where i'd recommend first but you do you i guess~~
is more of a distorted view of the series
unlike heartcatch which
which is why i tend to recommend it first, since it's solid all around and gives you a good impression of what precure series are like
also some of the sakuga moments in gopri are mindblowing
definetely has the best victim of the week precure has done
personally i find the themes in gopri slightly stronger, but heartcatch like
another common starter one i see recommended is smile which i can see but i personally wouldnt recommend to first timers unless they like more episodic shows
and other aspects worse than the others
all of them do better things than the others
yeee
i think gopri will probably give people a better guage on what the series is like, but if they want a good mystery and plot suite is another go to
true, usually the fandom just suggests heartcatch, which imo isnt the one that i think is best for starting
(a list which definetely doesnt include hugtto)
true, but i have a generic list of some of the ones i see more people generally liking and what i consider to be good first impressions for newbies
i mean, you could but a lotta people *do* want more of a guide on where to start in my experience
not every  season will be for everyone
since like kamen rider
more guided to some of the better seasons i usually give them a few recs on what i consider the better written ones
if people want like
yeeee
is very intimidating and people tend to not know where to start
in one franchise
17 fifty episode series
but that initial hump of seeing like
it is rather easy to get into when you pick up a series and go
apologies if it was unclear
>  Really? It's pretty easy to get into imo.
<@!262326868366065664> i meant this more in the way that people tend to have trouble picking a first entre to watch and get intimidated by the sheer size of the franchise
it just feels better if you consider it after the show rather than during
||wanting to overcomplicate the situation||
since the movie im pretty sure takes place after the show ||yuri mentioning her dad went missing instead of dying could easily be her just not like||
i think it's a show of her development
mhm
that was the core of the movie
and their relationship
mhm
and the villain was pretty interesting imo
the movie doesnt really portray them different from the show
not really?
~~just it has a lotta problems~~
~~maho is my favorite season~~
~~i dont say this as a hater of maho either~~
better than the series
the mahotsukai precure movie is quite literally
the other being the maho girls movie
one of the best two precure movies
the heartcatch movie is
ahaha
seriously
yeah like
||i think?? i havent been keeping up, i just know from like occasionallu searching so i could be innaccurate for all i know||
||i *think*||
||the one wherein hiyori has focusing also reset||
||well again again||
||summertime record just came up on my playlist||
||also hilariously||
||i actually dont remember||
||or something||
||i think the manga hit another reset so that's fun||
||y'know, started the whole thing?||
||since their song kinda||
||oh also, it's weird how hibiya and hiyori werent like mainer characters than they were||
||and only shintaro, hibiya and konoha dont have an excuse||
||still two days||
||fixes a few||
||knowing his true power it's kinda like||
||granted||
two days
but like shintaro forms an unbreakable bond between people he knew only like
the backstory is longer
not the backstory
read time, like the main plot
two days
since you dont realize that the whole thing happens over literally like
yes, the songs are the best version of telling the story imo
it’s jokes
movie one is basically a generally better version that cuts out all the fat and makes it a very good watch
and season two’s movie has some changes which some fans would rather you not miss
since season one is horribly paced and generally the movie version is superior
usually people recommend movie one and season 2
~~i recommended it the other day if i remember right~~
seabed's a favorite of mine
both good vns
it’s lolicon bait
prisma illya
like a carnivorous plant
~~fate the vn’s eroge parts were the weakest part~~
so yeah only three of the biggest kids franchises
ahhh
wait does toei also own ultraman?
mhm
precure, kamen rider, and sentai
they are behind three of the biggest kids franchises
toy sales will get you to that point
so the cgi will probably be as good as ever
plus the main animators themselves havent left
def
mhm
since that's very interestin
i wonder what they'll do now
precure's cg was really good
oh rip
that's why i was pinged
ahhh
what we talking about
you either love or hated it
divisive if i remember right
dokidoki was pretty like
no that's happiness charge that was known for being the most hated season
hwat?
in jp?
ooo noice
my favorites are as follows, from most to least
gx is my favorite season of ygo period
since like
after you watch the original jp version
an extra kinda thing to watch
but it's best treated as like
i will admit it is funny at times
ahahah
butchers the original in a lot of ways
i hate it since it kinda
~~watch gx next it's really good~~
zexal is very fun
well
mhm
to get to the big good moments
takes a while
but it also
GX is really good
if i remember right
they also made ||alito straight instead of being the bisexual icon he is||
dont watch the Zexal dub
FIREWALL DRAGON SUUUUUCKS
butchering gx
i was talking about the dub
you misunderstood
krika
uhm
oh wait
the honor of being the first protag ace to get banned
i bought them specifically to build a world chalice deck since i liked the art
i have two of the damn things and they're both banned
firewall is a stupid card
it *sucked*
you were forced to play the fuckin things
links were first released
when
oh gwendolyn you don't know what it was like
i gel with rly well
all other mechanics
like
i fucking hate link monsters
~~links can just fuck off~~
~~though vrains could be at the bottom because~~
but i just dont really vibe
i can see what's good about it
i rly dont like 5ds i just dont vibe with it
way back when
except like
i havent actually watched dm
GX
Arc-V
Zexal
Vrains
5ds
but as i was saying my favorites are
ahahah
~~unless you like irony watching~~
the only good ygo dub
OG's dub is like
noice
||they're the same fucking person||
||i know right? it was so shocking and great||
oh definetely
very fun character
what episode is shingetsu introduced?
||GALAXY EYES PRIME PHOTON DRAGON||
one of the best episodes of the show
mhm mhm
dont click that gwen
also can i just say that ||i still am not over the fact that kaito died from legit oxygen deprevation and not from like dueling||
FUCK THE DUB
VABDN'M
CKLA HVDBJINO'ISMC
L HVOADNIO'[
OBYIPUNOAVD'MPK
and i think it's plot is still decently strong since it was laid from the beginning but also
yeah i think arc v has the best duels
*i know*
and yes
bisexual icon
yeyeye
mhm
AND THEN
some of the best moments of the show
i think synchro dimension still had like
arc-v throughout like
~~except for three and four since you need context for how judai became like that~~
the characters are rly good
<@!262326868366065664> that chara is actually voiced by yuka too
(tho it is still the best anime adaptation deen has done of a vn)
so while passable, the original anime was still a flawed adaption in many ways
the thing about the original higurashi anime is that it left out a lot of extra contextualizing details from the vn, which is probably why they’re readapting it
granted ||madoka is more her miku than she is madoka’s||
dont worry gwen, it’ll pick up soon
i mean the first few eps of zexal one were like that too
i like the series a lot tbh
there are good dubs
not really?
and questionable dub changes
and also have horrible voice direction
they do
mhm mhm
mhm
ahhh okay i think i had my history wrong
it's the same company under a different name if i remember right
they're still around
nono 4kids dubs all of the yugiohs
4kids
only dm got away with a decent dub
yugioh dubs are mostly bad
ah yeah the hecking voices in the dub
?
did you watch the same ep in the dub
non-straight folks
and bi people
4kids likes to pretend gay people dont exist
bisexual icon
did you get to the end of the ep?
is this his intro ep?
but yeah best boy
but it's probably alito
er some subs call him alit
ALITO
BEST BOY
oh which one
is he the orange boy?
shingetsu?
that's fair lol
ah
i think it's only really the final one that's a miss for me
most zexal openings slap
oh also zexal ii's first opening slaps hard
you say that but i fucking despise the gx dub
do you play it physical or online, gwen?
links dumb
ahahah
the second season was already greenlit i think
yeye the magia record anime is pretty good imo
noice
it is
yuri
put their names together
yuyu and riri
~~using the guy from nana isnt really a good example since ||he’s not even the protagonist and dies in the first ep||~~
6 hours
oh well then, fun
ye
speculate
watch sunshine now
~~and then after the movie you watch sunshine~~
pirate
||but ye immortal boy is one of my favorite characters in the series, look forward to it, unless im lying and he dies next episode~||
it's unrelated
oh shit i just realized something in the manga that i hadnt thought that makes a whole buncha sense, but i cannot say it for spoilers
it's a cute cat!
it shows up many times!
yes
kitty!
also the kitty is cute, best character
im hoping they'll start again because of the anime
~~was forced to use crunchyroll premium to finish up reading it since for some reason the pirates stopped uploading~~
granted there are a still a buncha things unnanswered so far in tha manga but i *think* we're on the final arc
that's not a manga spoiler it's in reference to what you two were talking earlier
also ||immortal boy is best boy||
*god* it's good
there is one moment where im absolutely sure the anime will end at but like
it's such a fun manga too
yeyeyeye
you're in for a ride
i've read the manga so i wont spoil things but like
it's very very good
oh are you two talking munou na nana?
but ye i really hope they nail it in the anime
ahehehe
chef's kiss
like, the moment im pretty sure the anime will end at is like, the moment when i got fully invested and ready to see what happened next, i was already enjoying it but that moment was like
so you'll have to struggle waiting on s2 lol
though unfortunately the anime will cut off like right at the moment that the story really starts going fucking hard
yep!
i've been loving the manga since i started reading it and it only gets better
i'll tell you straight up, you're in for a wild ride
aight
~~and also tease a season 2~~
and i hope they nail the scene
one of my favorite moments in the whole comic
i'll just say that where the anime will end is like
ye lol
hence why this seems like the final arc
there were some Big revelations recently and something really big's going down in chapter 54
54
length
and the like
the anime should be chapters 1-28 seeing with what they put in  the opening
in the arc we're on
very much final arc vibes
it's ongoing but it's like
the anime probably isnt gonna get to that spot tho, since i have a good idea of where it'll end
||it makes a lotta sense and is a really good explanation too||
||46 chapters||
||one that isnt fully revealed for like||
oh ||there is actually an explanation for that||
i've been reading the webnovel
i favor the villainess is super fucking good
||this arc might not be what you're expecting||
||it does speed up again btw||
||ohhhh you're getting to the good shit||
||which part are you at||
half-kidding, since the light novel is probably more edited and tighter paced
~~web novel's further and translated~~
the art's also rly good
the manga goes at a rly fun pace and has very good storyboarding
i read the manga anyway so
i remember some Odd decisions and the animation felt a bit slowly edited
probably
and the cases are rly well written
kotoko's a rly fun protagonist
cases
there are a lotta rly good arcs in there
s2 will probably go into a lot of the miscellaneous cases, showing the detective job more before ending with the next big case that happened recently in the manga
the manga is rly good
~~already posted earlier lol~~
which was a surprise
they're both college students
also also
is pretty fitting
which
"Inverted inference" is what the japanese title translates to
a surprise
was such
rather than just excuses to fight
and like the cases *actually being cases*
"OH IT REALLY IS A DETECTIVE MYSTERY HUH, AND KOTOKO'S THE DETECTIVE"
it was around the end of the steel beam arc where it clicked for me and i was like
and then the more charasimatic and interesting "Love interest" was actually the protagonist
it was like "Oh, we're gonna be one of these anime where the love interest is the more interesting and charismatic than the protagonist and we'll follow a boring as shit protagonist"
and it was really well written
because it faked me out
and then got hooked
then i kept reading
honestly, i dont blame you, when i was first reading it i was like "oh okay, so we're doing this" when i first read
ahehehe
and my god is she a really good protagonist, she's really charismatic
but it's quite clear that kotoko's the real protagonist and kuro's just the watson
same lol, i think most people would just from seeing all the promo
i cant imagine it not
they probably left it in
||so i cant answer one way or the other||
||i didnt get there, i fell off after episode like 4||
||nonono||
||plus i already read the manga so||
||i kinda fell off after a few episodes because of those pacing problems||
||i didnt actually get to that part in the anime||
||uhhhhhh||
to me
so it’s just painfully mediocre
it’s not good, not bad
it’s just mediocre
yeah that’s the problem
i cant wait for next season, i dont like healpre at all it’s just really boring to me
make up and water themed
which uh, interesting combination since makeup and water
lipstick and water themed
tropical rouge precure
yeye
gogo is wrapped into yes5 for me since it’s a sequel season
no i mean go princess precure
it doesnt do everything perfectly but it does do them all extremely competently and the stuff it does well it does Really Fucking Well
it’s special because it executes all of its ideas and its theme super well
gopri’s also one i’d rec, it’s just over all extremely solid
yes
gopri has really great fight scenes and general animation and storyboarding
gorpi as well
yeah, heartcatch has some of the best animation in precure
it might not have executed everything perfectly but it’s not nearly as bad as people say it is
and like, while it does get a bit bogged down by the Love Square, it’s overall a season with a lotta good ideas and a fun setting and decent cast
it’s at least not painfully boring like fucking healpre is
im gonna get lynched for saying that but honestly? it has one of the funnest settings, and the writing itself is *not bad*
hacha’s actually pretty good
it’s still ongoing but i have Opinions
healpre i have some Opinions about
i like both of them a lot
hugtto and starpre are both really good
three fights
not helped by the action being boring as fuck outside of like
it’s very like, there’s a good half and a bad half of the show
it also has a lot of really low lows
uhm
it has some of the best episodes in precure
different
kirakira is
for the recent seasons, gopri through starpre (with the exception of kirakira) are all rly rly good
my personal favorite is mahotsukai even tho i know how generally unpopular that opinion is in the fandom
if you want possibly the best plotted precure than suite
gopri and heartcatch i’d rec
ye dokidoki is pretty good
suite’s one of my favorites personally
oooo noice
heartcatch is real good tho, just might give you unrealistic expectations for the other seasons
i’d actually recommend gopri as a better starter tho, since that’s just an incredibly solid precure season with great animation, while still being more what you’d expect from precure
it probably does victim of the week the best out of the different victim of the week shows in precure, and it handles a lotta darker subject matter as compaired to most precure
it’s rly good, one of the best, in my opinion
HEARTCATCH
just doesnt really have anything that makes it stand out
i dont hate the season tho, i think it’s alright
and precure already did that rly well in other seasons so like, it makes this one’s flaws stand out more
i think ideally a series should offer something both for vets and new people
i dont think it should need to function only as an intro as well
it does work well as an intro as millh said
which is why it’s boring to me
but usually precure seasons offer a little more than just being kinda fun and cute for me
but right now it’s pretty boring
the finale could be rly good and might save the overall mediocrity
oh definetely
that’s where most of my gripes go
allegedly the didnt change much in the overall plot due to quarenteen tho so like
since that’s understandable
that’s not a complaint or a criticism
i mean, yeah but the animation quality due to quarenteen makes the action kinda feel bad
it’s not really fun to watch the individual episodes for me? so it just feels boring to me, like you can make episodic stuff fun by building character or like just zany enough plots to be entertaining in their own right
mediocre
anything fun? like the episodic episodes are just kinda
there was a few weeks after the delay when they literally werent doing like
it has one or two good ideas but it doesnt execute them in a fun way so it just ended up feeling really boring to me
the other one being yes precure 5
it’s one of two precure seasons with a direct sequel
nope lol
futari wa precure and futari wa precure max heart
oh also futari wa is actually has 100+ eps since it had a direct sequel season
~~i havent completed futari wa~~
if you need to dip your feet into the other precures first because they’re faster
it speeds up eventually i think
uhhhhhhh
it does get really good apparently tho
compared to later precures
especially with like
yeah futari wa’s a bit of a slow start
ah okay
oh wait which anime is this?
ah right yeah futari wa’s a bit of a slow start
i dont trust this
because this series is rly dark
yeah that's why i asked what the twist was
a happy wixoss anime? what's the twist
the fairies, who also were their teachers, incidentally, and the girls were romantically involved
yes
||tho after the anime airs, people will probably rip the whole thing i hope||
||it was a struggle to figure out how to catch up let me tell you, i have no idea why nobody’s ripped the rest yet, especially since the anime’s coming out now||
||since all manga pirating websites cut off before like, three whole arcs||
||tho you’re gonna need to use crunchy premium to read up to the most recent chapter unfortunately||
||ahehehe, the manga is rly well drawn, i’d recommend it||
||ufufufufu||
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
||unfortunately the anime is gonna cut off before the plot really kicks into high gear but where it leaves is definetely gonna be memorable~||
||have fun! the story starts going harder in the next few eps~!||
||aight so you met shapeshifter kid||
||are nyall on the “Survival of the fittest arc of munou na nana?||
i watched them back to back and liked diebuster a lot better
same lol
🤝
||nana already had michiru, dont pair her up with nanao||
||YEAH SAME||
||nana's sins coming back to bite her||
||a part i took issue with when it was first happening was nanao being alive, but what they're doing with him is super interesting and im fine with it now||
||and the sister is extremely unnaccounted for||
||since, jin is always shapeshifted, yknow||
||oh yeah that was a great moment||
||i also love kyoya, and i have a theory that the shapeshifter is actually gonna turn out to be kyoya's sister||
||i've loved her character dev and how she's finally a pretty good person||
||current stuff||
also im loving ||nana really wanting to come clean but cant because it might incriminate her for the stuff||
that's my favorite moment, since it's jsut really powerful
||when nana realizes that everything she's been told is a lie and she's basically been brainwashed and killed some honestly people who could be good, and tries to kill herself||
i think the peak is actually in like
oh definetely it's one of them
absolutely doesnt let up
nana gets really *really* good after where the first season will end
not super necessary but it's passable
it's a decent movie ye
~~now it's time to get to the second season~~
how was it?
there's also the seiyus
sameee
aight then they probably do have better subs now
one moment
tho the movie's subs arent the greatest either, and to my knowledge people havent resubbed it yet
yugioh fan over here
<@!213645184125239317> <@139432096023183360> ||i kinda think kyoyo’s restriction might be every time he “dies” he loses memories, since there was an odd scene where he doesnt seem to quite remember his sister||
this arc was a highlight of the whole series
oh yesss
which chapter did you leave off on?
||he's super threatening too, you havent even seen the half of it||
||his title in the comic is "mind control" but i think that more refers to the ways he can get into people's heads and uses what makes them tick to manipulate them||
i will say ||since we dont know this at this point in the manga yet, i dont actually think the military man is talented||
ping me again when you get to good parts, i love seeing people's reactions
while reading
i'll let you figure it out yourself
anyway it just keeps going from here
aheheh, yeeep
since pirate sites dont have the latest chapters unfortunately
reading on a pirated site or crunchy
hoohoho
it's a great manga
which chapter are you on
yeyeye
||but now that nanao knows his talent is more than that, he isnt always using the talent negation||
||like, nanao used to think his ability was blanket negation of talents, so jin couldnt change into him||
||while jin can only transform into talented people, they themselves need to know the powers they have for jin to be able to use it||
||but that might be a good tree to bark up if we wanted to figure out nana’s talent, and yeah i think jin’s restriction on talent usage is||
||though, they can change since, michiru also has “revival” as her title||
yeye
||nana’s is talentless, kyoya’s is talented, jin’s is survival of the fittest, nanao’s is “enemy of humanity”, tsuroka’s is “mind control||
||it’s also important to note that every character has a “title” within the chapters||
||anyway, i do think nana might have a talent, what it could be im not sure||
||NOOO||
||AH SHIT FUCJ||
||but that’s a very very interesting point, that nana’s could actually have powers and it could bring someone back to life?||
||i thought that was just due to nanao learning more about his powers and therefore jin being able to finally transform without nanao’s powers negating jin’s powers||
||i completely forgot about it||
||really really interesting actually||
||oh holy shit that’s||
||wait shit, jin cant transform into talentless people??||
||jin’s transformations can only use the powers they know they have at the moment, as shown when jin is finally able to turn into nanao||
||remember, talents can evolve and change and grow and be unlocked||
||i think nana has acknowledged it to jin, but that doesnt discount the possibilty nana might actually have a talent just not know it||
||i think in the chhapter where she met jin yes...or maybe not||
||since that's where it's building to, she's just getting cut off, and it'd be the worst time to come clean||
||also im 100% sure by the end of this arc, or in the middle, nana will come clean||
||yeeep||
||it cant be fooled by negation||
||the machinery||
||well, tsuruoka gave us a hint||
||anyway, how do you like nanao as a villain, he's super great and threatening imo||
||ahhhh||
||the ages in this are a bit weird||
||ah right, kyoya is older than them, right?||
||now, is that kid kyoya or not||
||in the first chapter, since nanao's important again, there's a curious moment in a flashback||
||also i do wanna mention somehting||
||right, right||
||well, nana doesnt recognize kyoya at all and kyoya shows no reaction to her, and i think it’d just generally be kinda weird||
||also i am 90% sure “jin” is kyoya’s sister, i do not think it’s nana, since like||
||ah right yeah||
||there’s evidence sure, but not as much as i would like||
||yeah, that’s why i said it was a tentative one, since like||
||also there is no harm in thinking someone can read minds, since you’ll just have an extra layer to play around||
||well, he doesnt know what else she could do, so it’s safe to assume he thinks she isnt able to but is just playing it safe and keeping his possibilities open||
||ohhhhh that’d actually be a very fun twist, since it’d be another way he was bullshitting nana to see if she could read minds||
||or he already has a system in place so he can remember, like a diary or something, he might not remember remember, but he does have some way of knowing||
||since that’s the kind of person he is i feel||
||i think that’s probably to do with his lack of self preservation and not seeing many of his memories as “important”||
||especially since that happened shortly after it seemed like he forgot about his sister||
||yeyeye, and the reason he told it to that one girl, he needs someone to remember things for him||
no worries
aheheh
since i've already read it
<@!139432096023183360> you mean chapter 56
~~pirate~~
play the vn
>watching
||yeye||
||since he always seems to know just what others are thinking||
||like nana lied about||
||yeye, i also think tsuruoka's talent isnt actually mind control, but rather mind reading||
||nana theorizing is super fun||
||from what jin said, i think jin has||
the vn is so fucking long for a vn too
i mean
yeye
im super loving it tho, kinda treating it as it's own thing
and that too
it kinda shits on the themes of the original a lot
i can kinda understand why people dont like it
by that logic, from what i remember from dragon maid isnt tohru in the same boat
rip
the classroom problem?
yeah hopefully
why not include it in the translation
plus the issue is one in western media too, in a different form obviously but in a lotta western media there's like flamboyant gay characters who dont quite respect bounderies so like
yeah, because the context context is exactly why it's used and cutting it out robs a kinda character development and reflection as well as something the author wanted to comment on
and yeah that's pretty much exactly what happens in the webnovel
to give the appropriate context to what is stated in the story as well
that's part of the localization process
ahhhh i see, but then couldnt they just explain the context in the monologue? like
could you elaborate?
while i was reading it i didnt really mind as much, but like cutting out this explanation and reflection is kinda not great
especially since the biggest turnoff a lotta people had with the start of villainess was how rae's actions can be seen as a bit too pushy
oh wow, they cut that from the translation? that's kinda not great
and not even a spoiler it was revealed very fast in the vn
very important character building
and like, they leave out the entire reason battler was estranged from the rest of the family, which is like
they also leave out a ton of essential info to solving the actual fucking mystery
the manga’s great, i’ve been enjoying it a ton
*jotting it down in the background*
ah so as buck wild as always
8? 9? episodes before falling off
i’ve watched like
how incomprehensible did it get?
either way we'll see
or it was misinfo
maybe it wasnt supposed to be leaked?
ah
page doesnt exist?
where was it confirmed?
||she wasnt frill btw, unless they pull the rug out with it||
also anyone else immediately go back into the first ep of WEP, just to check if ||the first girl ai met was frill? since i remembered them looking similar and the first one seemed to know more about the wonder egg world than subsequent eggs||
but anyway, im gonna reserve judgement of this ep until the finale airs since it feels like it could swing either way as good or bad depending on how everything pans out
ripppppp
TWO
this episode was like, pretty much just set up for the finale i think
~~read the manga or light novels~~
the guy who was behind the anime’s production nightmare probably would lmao
what’s it about?
and light novels
manga people wanna see adapted into anime
holy shit villainess got fifth on the poll
aighty
smile also has some of the most emotional gut punches in it so that's also fun
GoPri os rly rly solid with great fight scenes, characters, and themes, whereas smile is rly good sorta like "episodic" structure with like every episode being entertaining in its own right
heartcatch is good but i dont rly think it's a good starter
aight, i'd personally recommend either gopri or smile precure to start with
because imo heartcatch, while being a good one to start with, isnt really the best one to start with
hai hai, do you wanna guide or are you dead set on heartcatch
ALL THE PRECURE??
huh intriguing
granted, the more recent seasons are on legal sourced but if you wanna watch any of the old ones it’s pirate or bust
and so you need to pirate a lotta them
not very present on legal services outside of japan because toei
precure’s also like
~~just use a pirating website~~
i implore you to not
do not watch the dub
holy hell anime production is a nightmare
three months for the true finale?
||in what way was it gutted?||
utena or penguindrum?
of course, it comes down to personal preference too
it's fun and good, but it gets pretty boring when that's most of the genre you have to read
i like romance and sol
big agree fenny, i need more genres personally
||explicitly trans||
whoa holy fuck
and not as good
very abridged
the movie felt
fragtime was a good manga from what i remember reading it
also the art is fucking beautiful
but like, if you like that type of thing it's rly great
in a bit of a heavy and hard to read kinda way
it's only like six chapters in and updates like every three months but each update is a delight
i'd recommend it as well, and i rly rly hope it doesnt drop the ball
monster wants to eat me is so fucking good
well, at least the prequel
isnt s2 entirely on youtube?
really well drawn and like super interesting as things unfold
the manga’s rly rly good btw
they kept doing it
so like
just the code geass staff thought it was fucking hilarious
paid only once or twice
actually they like
there are a lot of them meant to
yeah japanese anime is not excluded from selling toys
and like, in all the synopsises i've read
yeah that's how it was marketed too if i recall
<@!99695384296701952> someone's watching gunbuster
apparently the lns get good but the anime’s kinda not from what i’ve heard
yeah no, after 8 years it is not gonna be in the public domain
not after 8 years they dont
and given no info since it's probably in production hell
been in production since 2013 apperently
princess principal as well, very fun and gay
but as for recommendations, toji no miko is also a fun one
(i say continue watching gear since you're writing a fic for it as i recall)
i mean subtext or like text yuri
no that's not what i meant lol
subtext
as in do you mind if it's a like
like
how explicit?
yes that joke has been made, as for other yuri anime to watch let's seeeee
since if you saw how people were talking about it instead of immediately jumping to the conclusion it was a yuri anime, you wouldnt of watched it since it because you dont like the genre
that's why you need to read the summary or see how people are talking about it
since it's also a russian name
plus there's a russian boy *also* named yuri in the show
but it's a unisex name
yes
since he skates
yuri on ice
the title
hence
since the main character is named yuri
in this case, a name
yuri can mean different things
it's not a misuse of the term imo since like
o
bokurano?
hence, the rating will become bloated since most people watching the season and reviewing are already people who enjoyed the series
people reviewing the season are coming in with hte perspective of already being fans enough to watch all the way to the final season
it's kinda expected since that's specifically symphogear xv
i mean
~~a fantranslation might happen you never know~~
~~the episode titles eight and beyond also all feel one episode off lmfao~~
that’s what i mean
like, you can get away with not gendering a person at all in jp
so some subbers take liberties when referring to people by pronouns
jp is a very gender neutral language
yeah, it’s half because like
alright, you?
hewwo
watashi is gender neutral, atashi is specifically feminine
^this
it is gendered, in that one’s more one way or another but generally they shouldnt be specific indicators if everyone’s referred to gender neutrally intentional like hoseki no kuni does
the “i” they refer to themselves by is not necessarily an indication of the gender of the chara
mhm
i didnt play the game and the anime's actually rly fun and funny
pripara is also a magical idol show, apparently it's pretty fun if you can sit through like a gagillion episodes
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
oh right brr is two cours
it was released in the era where everyone was copying fist of the north star and like, yeah it’s just fist of the north star
part one is legit just fist of the north star
(not helping that they split it into two seasons as well)
some of them end up feeling like so much of a slog due to that
like almost every fight takes like three whole episodes and like
yeah the part 3 anime is definitely paced very badly as well, not rly helping it
i think 6 is like, alright like it’s rly good sometimes and i think the good does outshine the bad parts (tho i’ll probably need to reread it eventually haha), but definitely not my favorite part
ooo, so next month’s the big finale then part 9 might happen eventually?
!!
oooo
anarchronistic is probably what the time period’s supposed to be
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
is that a hokey anime
~~gogoanime is way more virus laden than others if i recall right~~
~~also 02 content i guess~~
NEW DIGIMON HOLY SHIT
~~read the vn of kai~~
aheheh, hope you enjoy four! <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
lmfao
gotcha, didnt know that
ahhhh
are we in the right channel?
so if you're hungry for more Content then you can read it
basically
yeye
but yeah saku isnt necessary for understanding the story or completing it
seacats
technically so but the core is the eight chapters since i think the ninth was added way later
||it's framed like this from the start as well, given that the first teaparty which introduces the meta layer already positions it as "outside of the story", however what makes it interesting is that it's also within the story as a framing device and such, in a way expanding on ideas presented in the higu vn||
||since the metaworld stuff is real-ish but not real in other aspects, you've played the game you know what i mean||
||hence how battler can be revived and killed by the witch and still is allowed to deny magic within the narrative||
||so, you've just finished episode 3 of the vn right? so, let's talk about the metaworld real quick since it's kinda both happening and not actually happening, beato more or less represents the idea of the culprit (or the idea of the witch) rather than an actual witch, with each of the entities within it being representations of actual corresponding things inside the real world||
~~be precure fan and know openings by memory~~
was question to here
which anime?
they built a pc version and programmed it first too
i think they've already figured out how to hack it if i recall right
~~if you need something to read while the remakes get translated debatably~~
pffffh
||Wish it was actually shown or done better tho||
||oh that's really cool||
about yuyuyu ||tbh they should've stayed disabled imo since it was in part a war allegory i felt while watching it, especially in how they're exploited and used by the system||
since you know
i mean, it was part of the og misdirection with saber too
~~she even has an estranged sibling~~
slowly takeuchi made her look closer to saber overtime lol
arc had a completely different design and face lol
seems like it'll just be a fun kinda romp, nothing too deep from the interview
oh it's edgy edgy
which one is this
im not even sure if she's the descendant or not since extra is a different timeline
there’s no good fate route anime
ideally you’d watch fate route first, then ubw, then hf, then zero buuuuuut
yeah it’s also a big piece on shirou’s character and the idea of heroism and survivors guilt, which is the other primary aspect hahaha
big franchise
it just doesnt work as well since uh
figuring out the identities of everyone, what’s up with the war, what’s up with the grail, and how everything slots together
honestly, the og fsn is very much written as a mystery
and they speculated on her identity
it was a spoiler
making a few of the moments hit weaker then they would otherwise
also the movies dont rly go into detail in the whole ||shirou is losing memories and sense of self through arm usage|| thing
gotcha
that's one of the nanoha spinoffs right?
||true but in-universe according to rae the revolution route has Philine’s best charadev||
||if i remember her description right||
also ||monocule and white hair||
||i personally like hilda better over all, i love people who are just garbage lol||
||true, but also||
||but the revolution route and philine ~~philine’s best girl btw~~||
||...the mom route?||
arc 2’s way longer
well first part anyway
from reading the webnovel version, you’re in for something that’s arguably even better than the first half
i favor the villainess arc 2’s great
~~lns of it are that good huh~~
wandering witch?
and other times it’s just like “I dont think any human talks or thinks like this, i dont know what’s going on”
sometimes they’re rly good and capture a lot of emotion and you can really get into what’s going on
fantranslations be like that sometimes
~~plus in the fantranslation of the webnovel version it was a bit difficult to gage what actually happens in it~~
yeyeye
the magical revolution of the reincarnated princess or something? the one with a rly well drawn manga?
~~that’s actually pretty accurate to what causes them~~
umineko’s sucks dont watch it
higu’s anime’s fine, it leaves out some interesting stuff and things that flesh out the world but it’s alright
the vn’s great for both tho, i’d strongly recommend, but especially for umineko
~~it’s also arguably better than higu, tho its horror half isnt as big as higu’s is~~
very much inspired by and then there were none
umineko’s a mystery story on an isolated island with a rich family yeah
tho it’s ambigious if it’a actually loops or just different possibilities the story can go down
honestly tho calling em loops is kinda spoilery imo, tho higu’s been out long enough that it doesnt rly matter, but yeah it’s a big what the fuck moment when you start up the second chapter of the vn and suddenly you’re back but everything’s different
~~ideally you’d play the vn but like, the show works fine for what it is~~
higurashi’s premise is a small town mystery revolving around a group of friends and paranoia
they’re in the same series but they dont need the back knowledge, hell the universes are quite different and rules of them
you can also just start with umineko or ciconia which work as standalone works tbh
umineko spoilers still dont click ||as such, “magic” represents more hope and escapism, and it’s not exactly a bad thing to have something to believe in, at the same time denying that means giving up that hope and stuff like that, essentially not reading into the meaning or having soemthing comforting to believe in even if it’s not real||
still umineko spoilers ||i cant go into full detail without detailing out a lot of plot beats from umineko, but suffice to say, the magic and witches have siginifancantly different meanings and the supernatural stuff doesnt work as a “literal” thing, however with the themes of the game that doesn’t mean it doesnt matter or has no value in the narrative and to the people it’s meant for, and as such, to have magic and escapism can be a good thing with hope and tuff like that||
that’s also spoilers, dont click dud
||that’s not to say the magic side and metaworld don’t actually happen or “exist” in certain ways, just it serves more of a metaphorical device for several ideas in the narrative||
gonna be spoiling a bit dont click these, but ||in umineko the metaworld is much more of a metaphor than in higurashi, and a lot of things shown arent exactly as “real” in universe as they are in higurashi||
||umineko and higurashi play by much different rules, if you try to apply one ruleset to the other you will crash and burn||
||also by the end of it i will be finally able to discuss the stuff||
||well, keep going it just keeps getting better||
||hoho||
>trying very hard not to say anything about umineko spoilers
ahehehe
there were numerous points in my initial umineko playthrough where i was like “Oh this is *probably* close to the end of the episode so i’ll go to sleep afterward” and then it takes three more hours than i expect, i still havent finished the chapter and i have to close the game to sleep because it’s four in the morning
that’s not a spoiler these things just are extremely long at all times
oh so like, not far in episode five at all haha
<@205859030051061769> how far are you in umineko btw, i heard you mention chapter/episode five but where in it
~~i personally like umineko and ciconia’s casts better but it’s personal preference~~
yeeee
a big part of the mystery for the player is to figure out why that is so and find the truth within it
but yeah, a more accurate statement of higurashi’s base premise is a story with the same characters told through multiple chapters of the same set of days but each run you learn more about the world and more mysteries get raised, basically a play with the same characters but different plots each time that don’t necessarily connect at first
out of four chapters total
ciconia’s only on phase one (because covid delayed phase two allegedly due to Similarities) but it’s also already forty hours long
same with higu’s vn
but yeah umineko’s also fucking long, i have like 180 hours total across the question and core arcs and holy shit
~~you’ve gotta present the evidence and make it solvable~~
~~which is a sin in a mystery story~~
~~also they fucking removed some Really Important Foreshadowing and interactions~~
but like, it’s very much written to be read in it’s format
i cannot go into specifics because spoilers
umineko’s also very much written to be read as a kinetic novel
i second this manga, it's really good (and somewhat stressful at times)
~~also like long running tokusatsu with multiple phases and yearly different shows they are all different and unique so that’s not rly an argument~~
splash star is definitely still like the og series
~~that’s like saying the original first kamen rider show all the way back in the showa era is the only kamen rider show~~
i dont recall if it was commented on in the anime or not, chances are if it wasnt it probably had at least a passing mention in the vn
iirc it’s a toy gun
WTCs one and two are Higurashi and Higurashi Kai, which are the “question” and “answer” arcs, and they’re one connected story with the same cast
traditionally with the WTC series (at least one through four) they have two sets of arcs for one complete story
which are followed by the answer arcs
there’s a big reason that those are called the question arcs
||i mean, amakusa and okonogi are in both||
those are like extra arcs which somewhat continue the story of higurashi (to varying degrees of success) and they dont have corresponding vns, they are split the a similar way to the og wtc stuff tho
the new higurashi stuff is complete now
WTCs three and four are Umineko and Umineko Chiru, which are the “question” and “core” arcs of it, again connected story with same characters, however it doesnt have a (explicit) connection to higurashi
iirc the og higurashi's anime's first answer arc is actually like, the second answer arc in the vn
it’s just those four have like, more fighting animation from the ones i’ve watched iirc
generally precure has good action tho (with the exception of kirakira precure a la mode)
heartcatch, futari wa (and its sequel max heart), splash star, and gopri are the ones with the best action imo
there are quite a few, but if you’re looking for good action
uhm, iirc there are some decently heavy episodes later on as a fair warning since you’re using it as a break
lmfao
wandering witch is very fun
what type of stuff are you looking for to break with?
ahehehe
but ye if you need a break than take one lol, ~~it’s just hard to talk about umineko without the full context, mystery stories lol~~
without spoiling too much like three of the arc’s in chiru’s climaxes happen in their teaparties
especially in chiru
yeah, specify when you mean the metaworld talks and not teaparty
||since tea party is a different thing so i thought you were at that segment||
||oh not at the climax in that case||
like right before it
oh you’re right at the fuckin climax huh
what part are you at?
~~finish umineko 5 dud, it just keeps getting better from there~~
since they arent part of the mainline wtc
techincally higu rei, gou, and sotsu are actually higurashi spinoffs lol
read umineko and umineko chiru
tho that doesnt rly mean anything since both of them are standalone stories
to answer an earlier question as well, umineko isnt a higu spinoff it’s actually the next mainline wtc after higu kai
no it really doesnt
no
it’s also badly animated because studio deen
also important character building which is also foreshadowing
a big nono
but taking out the foreshadowing and evidence for a story largely concerned with being a mystery is like
not inherently a bad thing for a mystery story to do
like it cuts out most of the foreshadowing for the actual mystery
it cuts out a lotta important character building *and* important foreshadowing
umineko’s anime fucking sucks
the steam sprites suck lol
im not on the pc so i cant post ps3 battler for context but like
god steam sprite battler looks like garbage haha
~~someone post pachinko/steam sprites battler~~
i used this for my umineko playthrough i think
plus by ciconia it actually is like, pretty decent as an art style
this is the wtc fan in my brain but honestly i think the og art’s kinda charming at this point
but the vn has a shit ton of the backstory and makes some of the stuff clearer (and has more foreshadowin)
there’s a lot missing from the anime, like the anime’s still serviceable and a good starting point
yes
||legit i was expecting sotsu to be kinda like the umineko core arcs to show it’s themes and meaning and not just higurashi answer arcs except without what made the answer arcs good||
||sotsu literally has two fuckin episodes of new content and it’s not even that satisfying with umineko knowledge||
||sotsu is worse about this||
i wasnt sure if i should say it without spoilering so like same
yeah, ||sotsu gou is kinda bad regardless of umineko knowledge||
basically
it’s difficult to explain without pretty serious umineko spoilers
the verse itself is technically the same verse but the stories have much much different rules and how everything’s treated in em
they have similar thematic elements between the games but they arent actually playing by the same rules
playing Umineko using Higurashi rules is literally a recipe for disaster treat em as their own things
they each also have wildly different settings and play by *much* different rules
ciconia is also still releasing
you dont need to play either to understand ciconia
you dont need to play higu to understand umineko
the stories have some similar elements but they’re pretty disconnected from one another
Higurashi, Umineko, and Ciconia are the three current WTC properties (tho higu is wtc 1 and 2, Umi is 3 and 4, and Ciconia is 5)
they’ve also made various other vns, but the main series they have is WTC
07th expansion is the company that makes WTC
so i can explain this
the anime onlies were upset too from what i saw
actually gonna not complete that previous thought it’s mostly an opinion over the newer show and since you’re set on watching it dont let me stop you haha
if i may be blunt
but yeah you dont need to read umineko to view the new higu anime tho like
since that was gonna be a release for pc that natively included the ps3 sprites
god i wish umineko gold edition didnt poof into non-existence
instead of the good sprites
yeah steam uses the same sprites as the pachinko umineko stuff iirc
it's just her motives are a lot more layered than they may have seemed
yeah pretty much ahaha
because at her core she's been using it as an excuse to take out her anger at the world, killing innocent people because she needs to feel strong, and justifying herself because "it's for her grandfather's research"
and so she's "justified" in her own mind in taking back it by any means necessary, in turn causing the whole trauma for a new generation of people
because she's been pushed down her whole life, she uses it as an excuse to lord it over others and play with their lives for something that meant something to her because in her mind, she's still that kid being pushed down
it's an excuse to push others down because she wants that power, she wants to be "god" over some people
exactly
and the fact that she was taken to such a messed up place for a good portion of her life left her with a skewed perspective on the value of life
it's not just that she's angry at society for rejecting her grandpa's research tbh, it's that she's trying to get back at the world and grasping at power where she can find it because of how much it's pushed her down, that's why she's so invested in proving her grandpa's research
plus, it's like you have to like her either, but knowing the why and what made her like this is important to the story
but yeah, it's incredibly hard to step up against the authorities there especially given how it seems to have been operating for a while
no wait rereading i misremembered, he did legally adopt her
and like, in general people tend not to believe victims and it is hard to step up and stuff, plus takano's grandpa also like didnt exactly legally save her from what i remember
iirc there's also a stigma about orphans in jp?
also the child support system is kinda fucked jp (Well, most places have a kinda fucked child support system but yeah)
chances are it's still around since takano's grandpa was already like, disgraced and didnt have as much influence iirc
it might be acknowledged in the vn or the manga (Since the manga has slightly different info from the other versions)
out of ten
the ln is like 8+
the manga is a solid 5
~~the action’s also well written~~
but even the ln you get a better sense of the world and charas and the whole Drama setting up for the events
especially with the occasionally very wonky art
the manga’s fine, it’s passable but holy shit is it not as good as the ln
~~please read the ln it’s very good~~
what's it about?
since it's mappa and madhouse right?
i mean, it's not like the other studio has bad animation either (judging from the animes i've watched from them)
nothing to write home about just yet
yeah it's not rly a clusterfuck tbh, it's more like rly good animation and just kinda alright writing
it’s one of the big things cut out
in a lotta depth
Oh this is actually explained in the vn
if you dont wanna read the otherside picnic ln, the manga’s great
i second these recs btw, as for roll over and die, the fights are actually really really well written despite having video game-like stats it never uses that as a crutch to write a boring fight scene where someone gets curbstomped because stats
oh the rec was for light novels lol, but yeah otherside picnic has a great manga
love live an oldie?
so to make em actually work and capture the same spirit you gotta think how to make it work and illicite the same feeling in your chosen adaptation
like the same horror tactics that work in manga do not translate one to one to other mediums, just like film horror not translating one to one to books and the like
i think it actually may be a byproduct of putting so much stock into the artwork itself and they hyper detailed nature and pacing that they forget to make it work in motion while also not being drawn as scarily as the manga
retracing the manga without understanding what made it work
and also like, especially in the collection, it felt like the anime producers were also too scared to like change it so that it could work in animation and be just as scary too, ending up basically be just a like
it’s a pretty good adaptation
the manga’s real good too
i honestly liked it better than the first part as a whole, and i can confirm even after vol 3 it just gets better (i read the wns)
volume three (and part 2 as a whole) is really great
i didnt finish the anime version tho lol
the manga is really good
it's because their sounds kinda sound like nyaa-ing iirc
to make the more horrific scenes hit harder yeah
horror/mystery with a dash of slice of life and comedy for contrast
there’s another reason why it’s probably called umineko tho, or at least why seagulls were chosen that i literally just noticed and god damn it lmfao
yeah seagulls are called umineko (seacats) in jp
what manga?
yeahhhhh
if i recall right
i think
yeah they're reasonably priced
oh right ln pirating is a thing lmao
and if you like it enough buy the lns
if you dont wanna commit to reading the lns at least try out the manga
like
i'd definitely rec it
and way more developped
even though they are longer
of the arcs that are being forced into this tiny runtime
way rushed versions
instead we get these like
and it could've been really really strong
made up the first season
four cases could've
when like
i dont get why the anime just forced pretty much every case into one episode
like
way longer
and also
the cases are in a very specific order for a reason
YEAH LIKE
"this feels like a bad adaptation"
even just watching it without context from the manga or ln i was like
honestly it is one of the worst adaptations for the source i've seen
like
terrible
is kinda
the anime
well
like, the manga you get a good sense of who she is from a more outside perspective and like, it's pretty apparent that she's in love with toriko but like in the light novel holy shit this girl is fucking weird and also Extremely in love
she's kinda like a vn protagonist when her internal monologue is lost in the different versions thereby cutting out a lotta the character building that lets you really really know the characters
you will not expect how she sounds in her head from reading the manga or watching the anime
whose narration is extremely entertaining and like
you dont really realize that sorawo is kinda a fucking weirdo
in the anime and manga
like
and while the manga is a much better adaptation than the anime (sorawo's feelings are pretty apparent in the manga), it cuts out a lot of her funner internal monologues
ah yeah, i've recently started reading the ln alongside the manga
yeah, it doesnt go into enough depth for the main characters, it’s honestly just a showcase of the big fights
or two
holding out hope for it to get a movie
the adaptation for nowayu in the anime is kinda a short adaptation, cuts down on a lotta the character building and stuff and is kinda just a showcase of the really big moments in it
we know nothing about the movies or how many there’ll be at this point so like, we dont know what to expect
manga is complete, anime’s apparently a good adaptation but because of where it ends there’s not much room for content in a possible season 2 according to what i’ve heard
yooo
so they ended up having an ep just focus around velvet
so they wanted to promote it
midway through the x's airing iirc
also berseria came out like
~~zestiria is much worse written~~
berseria was written as a prequel to zesteria
||ohhhhhh okay i was misremembering in that case||
lol
||im gonna wait in baited breath since i *do* think it’d definitely be a writing misstep to reset nana’s chara dev like this since she’s been really great||
||but yeah, four ways it could really go||
||gotcha||
||tho if nana is brainwashed, i’d love to see moe break her out of it like she did for her||
||it was one of the more mindfucky “oh shit” parts of that arc if i remember right||
||like, iirc, jin turns into her during the first “survival of the fittest” arc or so||
||jin’d faked as her before||
||a fourth option is that this is actually jin posing as her and the real nana has already broken out, but im not putting too much stock into this variant of theory||
||at least she has a few allies on the resistance’s side if that’s the case||
||yeeeep||
||or a third option i cant see||
||a combination of the two||
||she’s not but she’s *pretending* to be rebrainwashed (which’d be pretty in character for her) and is actually trying to play the military||
||she is rebrainwashed and it *is* infiltrating the resistance||
three ways
it could go like
||remember back when shapeshifter guy imitated michiru to make her seem sus||
||the author sometimes does that thing where it looks like one twist has happened when a diff thing is going on||
||maybe it’s also that like||
||yeye||
||she looks like she did when she was faking||
||plus thematically it kinda parallels the starting chapters so i *dont think* she’s fully brainwashed at the very least||
||honestly, i do hope it’s a red herring since like, i dont wanna see that development all go down the drain, especially when we’ve finally been getting real progress with her||
||unless she developed some sort of talent or good connections||
||i doubt it (since she’s good at acting and it’d be a waste of her development to this point) but it very well could be that||
||DID NANA GET REBRAINWASHED???||
||I JUST READ THE NEW CHAPTER||
||HELLO YES WHAT THE FUCK JUST||
holy shit what happened
bread
whatcha reading?
you’re gonna need to be more specific than that, that’s a whole subgenre
but ye, the ln's great, i hope the anime's a good adaptation since the manga sure isnt
obviously, while some people do treat kissing as the end all be all for something to be classified as yuri and all that, i think because it's classified in the "yuri" genre and each of the girls do in fact develop feelings for one another, even if by the end none kiss, it's still definietly a yuri (obviously though, the ln series is still ongoing so they very well could kiss at some point)
and menou pretty obviously ||develops feelings for akari as time goes on||
so does akari
executioner *is* yuri, like the light novel is classified as such in the genre (and also several of the girls do in fact have feelings for one another)
they're pretty much all standalone seasons
like
tbf, you also dont have to watch them all in order
show show show
wait new precure info?
oh it's about acting and not actually a yuri retelling of hamlet
please tell
yuri hamlet?
it’s pretty good imo, i like some of the later developments in the story
what one are you looking for in specific?
you can just bookmark specific sections if you wanna stop lol
yeah otherside's really easy to read because of that
||it's just waiting to see how it plays out is the fun part||
||oh definitely, everyone plays 5d chess all the time here||
~~she has a plan~~
yeyeye definitely
it's also A Lot
it's very good
yes
ah gotcha, so i was wrong, thanks for the info
i think kimi no na wa was what kickstarted it tho and it is very good
it's one of the first beatifully animated magical realism films about teens falling in love that is what most original anime movies are nowadays
afterwards just watch the following series
the first season of nanoha’s pretty bad even if it’s influential (since they think you’re here for the triangle heart charas which nanoha is a spinoff of, if you’ve never heard of triangle heart it’s because nanoha suprassed it in everything), the movie’s probably the better way to watch it
it’s also pretty similar to gear
nanoha was a formative piece of media in the magical girl genre
yes
yknow, being an adaptation
instead of
yeah the nowayu “adaptation” in the middle is more of a cool moments highlight reel
the new season’s okay, it’s kinda not the best adaptation of some sideworks but it’s alright
like
you can really just start with any, obviously some are more recommended as starter than others but because it’s all standalone it’s not as daunting as it seems
they also rearranged some stuff which uh
yeah that too, they just cut out a lot of her monologues which generally makes the story kinda bleh
contend with trying to make it work in their formats
it’s kinda like a vn in that regard, with the narration building out *a lot* of the story and character in general and any adaptation will have to like
even from only reading the manga (which is still very good as an adaptation) you miss out a lot on her as a person (though you get a better impression of her than the anime)
yeye
like, in the manga and light novel she is kiinda a huge jerk at times and we love her for it
also they kinda detoothed sorawo’s character in general
she’s incredibly entertaining and fun and you dont get that from what i remember of the anime
like sorawo in the manga (havent gotten to this part in the ln yet but i assume its similar) is the type of person who literally thinks to herself, after doing something *extremely* assholeish, “Wow, I’m such a good person.” without an ounce of self awareness
which again, doesnt work in the anime version since they shuffled that arc to be later
yeye, especially with the preceding arc marking a pretty big change in her character and development
im overselling her jerkishness a bit but i do remember feeling like that aspect of the character felt very gutted in the anime
since like sorawo is kinda hesitant on going back to the otherside *and* kinda a big jerk who doesnt do stuff for others very often
three arcs between them
like in the manga and ln, kisaragi station i and ii have like
kinda ruins some character beats and development
strikers doesnt have movies
a lot happens in like, the years between iirc
||that was to here||
||link?||
||how much did michiru's death hit in the anime?||
oh rip
i cant say anything for its quality as an anime (as i havent watched it) but it's a great manga
you watch the anime?
~~i mean you gotta find the manga chapters somewhere first unless you wanna use crunchyroll premium~~
ahehehehe
||oh right also i just remembered real jin's comatose body is still a factor too so we might need to even doubt it if we see a jin who just shows up without first transforming||
||yeye||
||do the least likely thing||
||so hiding as a person would make more sense if he were to go into the place||
||given how considered jin is in tsuroka's plans||
||since probably every guard has been given specific orders to be on the lookout for any animal||
||i'd imagine he might be pretending to be another person if he ever gets close to the location||
||yeah, though if anyone knew where he was it would definitely be moe since she's also unaccounted for||
||maybe he's with moe||
||or in a different solitary||
||though he's probably laying low for the most part i'd imagine||
||also, im looking forward to when jin comes back since like, he's quite unpredictable and such and could come back in a big way||
||plus we saw people outside of nana discussing about her so i dont *think* she's brainwashed||
||ahehehe, that might happen lol, but i dont think it||
||like, when the timeskip happened and it looked like nana was rebrainwashed, i thought it might be that her memories were tampered with but that isnt the case i think||
||i think that might be one of the limitations of "negation"||
||if he could why would they need to brainwash nana||
||i dont actually think nakajima can manipulate memories||
||plus like||
||yeah i think so||
||still tho holy shit scenes with nakajima are so nerve wracking because of the negations lol||
||yeah, that's probably what happened||
||now mind you, i dont think this is a likely theory but it could happen||
||that being said, in going over his powers again, i came upon a theory

while the most likely explaination is that kyoya's cost is his memories, it could also be that his memories are being negated or something like that||
||as such, he can negate functions in people's brains (the invisible trick), make people more suggestable, probably negate movement, and just generally be extremely powerful and hard to out maneuver||
||at least, negation within humans i think||
||basically, negation is negation of functions *period* not just talents||
||it was during that arc, but it was explained pretty clearly||
||back when he came back as a villain||
||that's how he can just disappear while also using it lightly to make people more suggestable||
||dont you remember, negation can negate a lot, like functions in the brain||
||im not sure honestly, i dont think we have enough info to figure out the trick just yet||
||even if the last we saw of him was getting cornered, that's the most likely option imo||
||honestly i bet jin had something to do with it if i had to guess||
||probably the latter, or she's playing 5d chess||
||and holy shit the twist at the end again, this is so much||
||i do love nana, her development's just really been great all around, i enjoy how she's trying to play the system and how fuckin tense it is because now it's the enemy who has the upperhand||
||holy fucking shit that chapter was good and that fucking twist at the end||
~~pls~~
thank goodness they nailed that lol
the light novel is categorized as yuri
zexal's last 20 episodes are a fucking trip
i do love it tho, it gives it a nice flow and energy
yeah lol
genuinely, this is a really good thing for the direction and letting the show and its dynamics breath honestly
||aside from that, it was a solid if a bit boring chapter||
||plus the art felt a bit odd, that may also be me getting more used to everyone’s new designs but it hit me that they dont look visually as interesting||
||tho personally i didnt quite vibe with this chapter as strongly, prolly just because it’s mostly setup||
||yeye, it’s quite interesting||
it’s not as good as the novels
oh the executioner manga
||:pain:||
||let’s say that there’s evidence for various theories and i cant say any of it||
||at the current translated point in the ln i mean, the raws might know lol||
||take that to mean whatever you want it to mean||
||i think it’s not too much of a spoiler to say that, at the current point in the ln, we dont know if this is true||
||the pain of reading the lightnovel and not being able to contribute to theory crafting discussions||
||oh nice executioner’s anime dropped today||
||volume two has a less strong ending tho which is why i can see em just adapting volume one||
||yeah, pretty much||
||since i can also see the end of volume one being the end of like episode six||
||my predictions are it’s probably either gonna just be an adaptation of volume one, given that that’s a pretty succinct story on its own, or it’ll do volume one and two||
||oh i fucking knew that was where it’d end||
did we at least meet momo?
ahhh so it ends before meeting her, well expected as much
||it won a hard to win ln contest||
||i assume executioner is one of those too since like||
||oh definitely||
||until the anime started airing||
||yeyeye, tho at the time im pretty sure it wasnt confirmed he was back in the manga just yet||
anyway waiting for volume four to drop is pain, i need more content
||fair lol, im glad they didnt do it that way since i’d have such a harder time recommending it and going “please, i *swear* this is a yuri please”||
||i read the mangas (dont read executioner’s manga it’s not a very good adaptation and some of the translations are wonky) in close proximity to one another and it was certainly a time||
also not spoilers but ||how’d you like the bait and switch being almost identical to nana’s||
||the terminology change likely wont come up too much, nor will it really mess with anything methinks, but it's something to note||
||also because it sounded fancier||
||i mean, i think the *main* reason ivory was used rather than white is because in the novel there's a bit more time to specify and the girl who died in that scene has the pure concept of "White" whereas they're specifying that "Ivory" is something different||
yeah, just checked, they did use different terminology for this
weird bit of translation differences with terminology
it's not *too* important but just a like
in that ||when menou's teacher flare says "If this was the second coming of [White] there wouldn't be any survivors." In the novel, [White] is refered to as Ivory iirc||
there is a weird bit of translation difference between the novel and these subs
and then promptly lost my mind as more and more stuff in book three pointed to it
i actually initially made it as a joke in between waiting to read book 3
nope, well sorta? you can make the theory just from book two but it became much much stronger in book 3
and then i can explain what the fuck is making me lose my god damn mind
it's worth it if you do end up reading it
yeah lol
||it's something a lot more well, i can't explain the theory without spoiling like five different things||
||nope that that either||
i cant wait for book four
but ye, im *pretty sure* my theory over the novels is correct just judging by uh [REDACTED]
so yeah it's gonna end with book 2
oh and yeah, okay the opening showed some characters from book 2
HELL YEAH WHAT A GOOD ADAPTATION AT LEAST FOR THIS FIRST EPISODE
god i cant say it until i finish the ep
anyway, im a bit curious by you saying ||dreaming of each other|| but i'm pretty sure i know and will find out by the end of this ep but like
||But im fucking right||
||that you do not have the context for||
||another theory||
||there's uh||
||no not that one||
||OR AT LEAST, 1000% MORE LIKELY||
||WELL, LOOKS LIKE ONE OF MY MAIN THEORIES IS FUCKING RIGHT HUH||
so, started watching executioner episode one and with the currently translated ln volumes and info i have from them and UH
it’s not a good adaptation at all
the manga sucks
~~also the writing’s rly good~~
they’re not very long but they have a lotta content
200 pages
each is only like
there’s three soon to be four
it’s really really really good
read it read it
yesssssssss
yeah the chapter title’s a joke about the titles lol
heartcatch is just a rly good show
go princess is a rly good and well made show that’ll basically show what you’d expect in a precure series but like executed extremely well
Smile’s a lot more, well, zany than the others but it’s a good time especially towards the end
the starting points i’d rec are probably Go Princess, Heartcatch, and Smile
anyway, smile’s a good starting point
okay, watch all five hundred eps of showa kamen rider the original and get back to me on that
it’s like the only one with that disclaimer tho
ideally you shouldnt watch hugtto first
heartcatch
splash star is unconnected
nope, futari was precure max heart is the direct sequel
the other reason you might not wanna start on futari wa is that it has a direct sequel so you’re somewhat committing to a 100 episode show
tamers is the best
tamers
the series are mostly unconnected from one another and as such you can rly start wherever you want
saying you should only watch futari wa is like saying you should only watch the original sentai or kamen rider (the showa ones) or like saying you should only watch the original digimon
plus futari wa takes a bit longer to ramp up imo
starting for futari wa is fine (it’s a rly good show) it’s just i feel like the others are better starting points as the format wasnt as defined back then (not a bad thing)
||extremely ripped, we love to see it||
||they made her look so fucking cool in the anime version||
~~they are very gay indeed~~
anyway i can go over it but not rn rn
what anime? there is no umineko anime<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
||since it’s an important thing, i assume they’ll include it in either next or the episode after that, but it’ll make menou’s comment make a bit of sense and also like, maybe have you reform a theory or two||
||oh right real quick about this theory, there’s some things that were explained in narration of the scenes we’ve already seen that i could share with you if you’d like em||
||decent adaptational episode over all, i have a lot to say on a few of the decisions made this time round but i’ll not go into them since it’d take up a lotta space in the channel||
||the momo vs ashuna fight was a bit disappointing since it’s a rly cool fight in the novel||
and more!
just kinda drops ange in out of fuck nowehre without any set up
does not give us a very clear map of how everyone's related
does not tell us about battler's past which is important to the story
a shitton of the evidence for the core mystery
essentially, umineko anime cuts out like
dont wanna clog the channel lol
aighty, i’ll do it in dms if you dont mind?
wherein it’s difficult to tell what’s real and what isnt
essentially hollow ataraxia and kagetsu tohya both have extremely dreamlike tones
essentially higurashi and umineko are both episodic stories wherein the same story plays out in different ways with the same characters, each revealing more
higurashi does understand that, the other stuff is mostly extra material
essentially most nasu vns do it like, each route is its own thing but they usually build to one final route that ties things together and serves as a thematic conclusion
and kagetsu tohya
||probably a volume two chara||
it's great
the magirevo manga is just a spectacular adaptation all around


god the translator is doing this rly fast
YES
the manga is genuinely so well drawn like, it’s kinda amazing
since that's where im projecting book one's ending is gonna be
you should be able to start reading around episode sixish?
YES HAVE FUN WITH EXECUTIONER BOOK ONE
||it's one of the coolest fights in the first volume||
||yeah biggest disappointment of the ep lol||
<@213645184125239317> new nana chapter
||Yeah, you're right it seems too sudden||
||see, twin trick and mind control not specifically referring to anyone's true abilities||
||and given that these titles are usually a little misleading, i dont think it'd be actually time travel||
||also, the name of this mini-arc/battle is "time travel"||
||since if she were just normally tired, i dont think it would've been noted||
||also you're definitely right, nana being super tired seems actually really suspicious now that i think about it||
||yee, obviously it's still very preliminary given that its the start of the battle, so we'll have more time to guess in the future||
||the mark on the wrist is not a loop counter but an hour counter and shows how much time has passed in the real world||
||however, once they wake up, she can't remember exact details, so she's trying to get nana to fuck up and not be able to tell when things are dreams or reality anymore so that she'll fuck up in the real world when she wakes up||
||building off what you've said, i think her true ability might actually be drawing people into dreams, hers or theirs||
||okay, here's my theory||
||plus the framing of things makes it look like she appeared behind nana out of nowhere might have a good amount more weight than we're giving it||
||yeah that too, like, it seems very suspect to me||
||since sometimes the loop giver is unable to remember and that's usually the limitation to it||
||it's also interesting to note that she also remembers what she did the previous day||
||given that it appeared on her wrist only after this loop||
||it might be a counter for the loop number i think||
||maaaaybe, the bar's intersting||
||also, we havent really seen many talents that would affect the world *this* drastically, and it doesnt feel like something that could be easily negated (which raises a question of why she's working with the watchers)||
||plus, trying to find the whole like, limitations to a timeloop ability would be hard without something like that||
||similar to the twin trick||
||that's fair as well, though i think you're on the right track in that like, i dont think it's actually a time travel thing||
||plus like, maybe it's her trying to find where nana put the notebook||
||honestly i think it'd make a lot of sense if it were actually a dream, since like, it'd be kinda disappointing if nana's progress with some of the side characters went backwards imho||
||i also thought it was really sweet that kyoya honestly actually considered nana a friend as well||
||but ye, another time warper, nana's gonna get so stressed lol, how's she gonna beat this||
||oh i didnt even think it could've been a dream||
i will say, minor minor minor spoilers, ||i am a little disappointed that there wasnt a cameo from a certain character that's introduced later on during the flashback scenes, but she's not necessary to show right now||
next ep or the ep after that's also has a certain scene im rly looking forwards to seeing so that's fun too
but, ye overall i rly like this one, a lotta the backstory scenes with flare gave me chills which makes me excited for how they're gonna adapt a few things later on
there's a lotta set-up going on for some later events
whew, this ep was actually a rly good adaptation of several slower scenes in the book imo

fuck they nailed that scene from the backstory
no problem, was planning to anyway
aight yeah, ||then if book one ends on episode seven that’s a bit worrying, unless seven’s the end of book one and start of two||
||tho, if book one ends on episode seven, it is a bit worrying since book two’ll have five? episodes, unless it’s a thirteen ep show then that’ll be fine||
||depends on what exactly happens in episode five, cant say much more than that||
||judging from the episode preview that they post online, it looks like episode 6 or 7’ll be the end of book one||
||i’d assume the interlude structure is used kinda for the starting books of the longer story arcs since, saying this isnt a spoiler, books one through six form the first major overarching story arc and book seven is the start of a new one||
||the later books two through six dont have as many interludes, but book seven has about as many as book one||
||in the first book especially they employ “interludes” which is where a lot of the backstory is shown and they’re mostly very cool and evocative||
||yeah pretty much||
||backstory that was shown in slightly different spots in the novel and all that, since adaptation||
||we’re in i’d say the final arc of book one, so they’re getting menou’s journey with flare out of the way and some of her resolution so that we have further context||
||oh yeah, they’re getting some of the backstory out of the way so things that happen in the next few eps make sense||
havent watched the ep yet, tho if im right about the placement of this ep im assuming they’re getting some of the backstory they glossed over out of the way (as rearranging it for anime means they have to reorder where things are mentioned) and next episode should pop off quite a bit knowing what’s coming
you’re right but i ended up deleting something else i was typing and forgot to delete the spoiler lines
anyhow, the next books continue to build so you’re in for a good ride
||ah gotcha gotcha, that’s what i thought you meant||
||basically, are you referring to the disaster that destroyed menou’s village or something else?||
lmfao, i just really like talking about stories i like and sometimes it be like discussing spoils
||since how you worded it is kiiinda ambiguous and i dont remember much being revealed about the ivory concept in the first book other than the basic stuff||
||elaborate a little, i dont know what you mean there||
||ahehehehhe, dangit spoils. In that case, reaction about the reveal of flare killing menou?||
otherside manga is extremely good
volume one spoilers ||how did you like the akari reveal scene||
a bit over a week
also read books two and three, four’s translation drops in like
Now You Know
yeeee
this ep gave me a good amount of hope that the end wont be too rushed
hopefully
im also like, not as worried about it being rushed since i think i've cracked part of why they changed around some stuff and that makes me think it'll end up paced well
ahehehehehe
you havent seen the most of akari being extremely thirsty for menou that's for sure
||actually funny thing about this, in the ln you remember the moaning when menou did the guiding force connect with akari on the train? Yeah, the ln narration kinda implies she was playing up the noises intentionally to try to flirt with menou||
10/10
yeah, the manga for magirevo is like
oh fun
good enough that i felt compelled to buy the raws
it’s so good
plsssss
it drops on may third
a week and three days
book four in like
speaking of the series tho, guess who bought books four through seven and is attempting to read through them raw because it’s a good way to study jp and kanji
ahehehehe
the ED's also extremely good, the full took a bit to grow on me but now i cant stop listening to it
~~listening to the fulls~~
~~also they make me emotional~~
yessss
i thought you were leading into something
oh that's the end of the sentence lol
and in the anime i think it's fine that it wasnt explained since it would be a bit intrusive
oh yeah that's valid lol, do know that the novel did communicate it tho
so it doesnt feel as bad as spending half the ep
in it
way less runtime
due to being a novel, the prologue is like
tho to be fair
||lmfaoooooo, given what happens in the novel there is now a negative chance of this even happening||
||so, she wanted to test it out and then the stab comes||
||basically, she needed the info and also wasnt sure if he actually had a pure concept given that he said they said his concept was "nothing"||
the ln it's actually explained why ||menou doesnt immediately go for the knife||
and also made me realize people actually self-insert into bland isekai protagonists
incredibly funny to me
which is
i've seen some reviews that are basically people being angry about it lmfao
yes
honestly, i wonder this too since i know there are a lotta isekai fans weirdly mad about it
~~dont read the manga tho, it's terrible as an adaptation~~
~~if you dont feel like watching the anime version, the light novels are rly rly good~~
||honestly, they might end up elaborating more on it later but im not sure||
||we dont have a full picture on exactly what chooses the summoning yet, it’s been mostly implication||
||it might even be that they can only be summoned from the modern era given that all of the otherworlders we know are from the modern era||
||i’d assume so, especially since the more modern ones would be able to consider more uses for their pure concepts||
||but yeah, it’s not so much time doesnt flow the same pace as, these people are drawn into random points of the world’s history||
||i’ll take your word for it for now, but i dont remember that implication being in the story while both watching and reading the lns||
||i dont remember if there’s summoning that can happen without a ritual||
||the rituals will pull a random otherworlder into the world from a random point in time and attach a pure concept onto them||
||it was only after the four great human errors that faust began killing otherworlders||
||not to mention pure concepts allowing technological developments far more advanced than anything from our world regardless of the otherworlder’s own time period, remember the old society worked with the otherworlders and didnt kill them||
||this isnt initially obvious, but there’s a thing that’s hinted at later with some characters that *strongly implies* that summoning otherworlders dont necessarily correspond to points on the time axis and instead it pulls them into the world at randomized points||
||summoning otherworlders doesnt necessarily grab an otherworlder from the equivalent time period, rather it seemingly grabs them and puts them into the executioner world at random points in time||
||oh wait also, i just remembered the other explanation||
||pure concepts are a hell of a drug||
i havent read the ln yet since im waiting to purchase it at the same time as executioner four
ahhhhh gotcha gotcha
whenever you finish book two ping me and i'll tell you it ~~leaving out further stuff from book three~~
but ye, i cant discuss my theory since it pretty deeply involves some stuff we learn in book two so like
plus it lets me read books i enjoy
and also a way for me to keep up with my jp studies when im not taking classes for it
it's partially a way for me to drill myself on kanji since that's my weakest area
reading directly
but my jp is getting much more fluent in terms of reading ability
before i get fully caught up to speed on everything
in like a month or two
obviously it'll most likely be like
60% of the way through book four now?
yeah im like
if things about it are confirmed or deconfirmed i mean, it very well could still be ambiguous at the point in the story book seven is
pretty soon (when im finished) i'll probably no longer be allowed to comment upon or build upon my current theory so like yeah
also i am currently reading the raw jp novels so like
||flare doesnt count since flare is specifically an alias||
||or a future character who is also not an otherworlder, also has a punny name||
||like momo is from this world and her name's momo, which is a pun because her pink hair||
||yeah lol||
||the pun theory also kinda goes against what i think currently, so yeah it’s just interesting to note||
misclick
shit sorry about that
||i dont know where i was going with this||
||i dont need to explain that one||
||and akari is tokitou akari||
||like the guy from episode one is “mutsuki” and “mu” is 無 as in the pure concept the guy had||
||it seems kinda like a rule that otherworlder’s should have punny names, metatextually, so like, it would follow that, if menou were an otherworlder, her name would also be a pun, though obviously we wouldnt know her last name if she were one and the pun could be in there||
||yknow, what’s interesting about this that i just noticed on my watchthrough of the anime, is menou very clearly states that the only thing she could remember was her name being “menou”||
||very technically i can discuss it at the end of book 2, since that’s when i first made the theory as, in part, a joke but it has became weirdly likely so i am set on it now||
||there’s some very particular details in the other books that’s like, i cannot discuss until they come up in either the anime or you read the books||
||well, let’s just say some info from future books has made me think different||
yeah lol
i just like things with prominent mystery aspects so it comes with the territory lol
lmfao
||you planning on reading books two and three?||
||but yeah, extremely strong ending to volume one with those revelations||
||i cant say more on that topic until you read more of the novels||
||that was my impression of the dream by the end of volume one as well||
||hohooho||
since again, 12 episodes, time is of the essence
like obviously, i cant really imagine *that* being in any different spot that it is due to pacing and framing but like, honestly i’d mind it less if they moved it in the anime adaptation than i do with the manga adaptation
honestly, i sorta agree? it’s just i think they might combine the epilogue and book two’s prologue into a single ep
and why i was freaking out in episode one
also read books two and three so i can discuss My Theory
^ spoilers for volume one
||and the flare revelation||
||how was the akari thing?||
oh wait you read the book!!!!!
seven probably actually
comparing lns with their respective animes is a fun thing to do
like wasuyu
it could honestly make a fantastic like six episodes tbh
season three has a highlight reel of it but the full thing is rly good
it’s rly good
read nowayu the prequel
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097> judai in D tier
so it’s definitely a yuri yuri
i did some checking on the webnovel and it also does seem to end with them getting married
fenny read book four
~~speaking of books, you read executioner book two yet?~~
part of the reason i think i like roll over so much is also like, i checked the author’s twitter and they pretty much just have my exact taste in media so uh, it’s very up my alley lmao
obviously if it’s not your cup of tea dont force yourself to read it
“Wait i thought i was at the climax”
the books are also a bit too long for their own good, i remember getting halfway through book four and then being like
i mean that’s fair
i kinda disagree isk given later books do explore more of milkit’s character and the relationship does grow in a pretty good way
finally im seeing people watch the ep with ||You Know||
~~ahehehe, fair~~
my time powers extend to the raws since im reading them now lol
lmfao
||there's a few pretty big reasons there needed at least another world aspect but even then it feels a lot like it's part of the worldbuild rather than something tacked on||
yeah lol
uh
rather than the gimmick of the plot
yeah, it's more like the summoned people are part of the world building
i dont blame you honestly aya
which is the sign of a straight up bad adaptation i think
and not feel a desire to look at the source either since it's not a *trainwreck* per say
which ends up making it feel like the source isn't that good which is like, not the case at all imho
it's just fine enough that you think it's probably a decent one
it's not a trainwreck of an adaptation
like
since the light novels are extremely good
no
which is like
it makes the source feel pretty mediocre at best?
that's the big problem with it lol
they cut a very important scene and generally dont get the emotions as high as its supposed to be
the manga kinda sucks lmao
||hence, it'd kinda defeat the purpose of trying to save menou||
||my impressions when i finished book one was that it was mostly because like, Menou definitely wouldnt have trusted her if she had her memories lol||
||you'll learn in the later books||
||well,||
yeee
~~ping me your thoughts when you read it~~
eyyyy
it only gets better from here~
glad you're liking it a lot ash
now read the novel
i’d say just start the novel after this ep basically since that was your plan
the epilogue is pretty important but they may move some of that info in it since like, twelve episode anime, they may not have time to place everything in the spots they were in the novel
this ep should be the end of volume one ~~maybe minus epilogue~~
oh! ash, judging from the next ep preview on youtube
||the symbolism||
||it's metaphorical for the mostpart||
just watched the ep i take it
read untranslated yuri novels then <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
~~speaking of executioner, ash have you read the novel yet?~~
like gear/madoka level maybe higher in the future
executioner’s pretty gay yes
ye it’s pretty good
~~i still do wish it was titled “The executioner’s walk down the wedding aisle” tho~~
“way of life” is an arc word and “virgin road” is the furigana over it so it’s more like a subtitle
i mean i dont mind the translated title since like
i still gotta watch the episode myself
ufufu
it's gonna be slow for a bit
yeah it's the start of book 2 so like
the story is really well put together wow
ah fuck while rereading parts of the books to retrieve info i came to a Big Fucking Realization about something that was actually foreshadowing in hindsight
read it ash
||why dont you read the book and find out~||
||who, manon?||
||that’s the tl;dr version, the ln goes in more depth about this||
||that’s why she was only able to see the tip of the iceberg during that mutual guiding connect||
||it’s actually more that menou was actively trying to go too deep and into akari’s soul and trying desperately to avoid the pure concept in it||
||essentially, akari seals off her memories when interacting with menou and only unlocks them if she needs to fix something so menou doesnt die or is experiencing something new and menou isnt around.

menou thinks that akari, who is looping but doesnt know it as she surmised, doesnt know that menou is trying to kill her so menou is keeping it a secret still, also she doesnt know *why* akari is looping||

and my library has four paid for ebooks on it
i have the physical copies
basically i either buy em from an electronic store or pirate download em
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
the anime is really good but if you start the books do start from the first one since they go in a bit more in depth on things ~~and are just very well written~~
the anime season’s already covered all of book one and will probably cover all of book two before ending
probably until the end of the season, but there hasnt been anything said about whether or not there’s gonna be a second season
~~now read the novels~~
yeeee
but like, just in case lol
10 years old at this point
not sure if i needed to spoiler that since madoka’s like
cool enough they used it ||for homura’s witch barrier||
so ye, wasnt teasing, was originally just Cool Imagery
in an interview urobuchi stated rebellion wasnt planned but he is satisfied with how it turned out
yeah, shaft added the aftercredits by themselves
~~havent read it yet if there’s a new one~~
nana?
||ohhhhh yeah that’s another good theory||
||that is fair buuuuuut it feels like a cop out if that is what happens||
||yeyeye, and it also cleverly misdirects them for when they actually do wake up since they’ll still be in the same room||
||like it explains why she’s making it a timeloop if it’s a dream invasion that she doesnt remember||
||personally i still think the actual trick is that it’s a dream but saeki *doesnt* remember when she wakes up so she’s trying to make it look like a timeloop so nana will give up and cough it up when she actually wakes up||
||and there’s a lotta focus on sleep right before nana goes into the timeloop, hence where us thinking it might be a dream instead||
||yeah, and remember, the chapter “twin trick” turned out not to actually be about twins so the titles can lie as well||
||to bait nana into admitting what she learned||
||or maybe saeki set it up in that like she placed fuuko like that while not quite killing her||
||especially since uhhhh whatshername hanging herself is probably something nana worried about rather than something we actually know for sure||
ah yeah that is rly fair
||maybe it is time travel but the person in question can hypothetically travel back to an earlier timeline by way of the mark||
||i had a new thought tho||
||ohhhh yeah you’re right now that i think about it||
||honestly, im rather curious about the letters since they might end up spelling something important||
<@!213645184125239317> read the new nana chapter ||god how’s she gonna get out of this one||
mystery idol would be very good, imagine solving a mystery while also like, having to get your show done
does it have seeders tho, since to get a torrent to download someone needs to be seeding
did you pick one that had seeders?
and you dont need to play triangle heart to understand nanoha at all
as a franchise
nanoha is incidentally much more popular than triangle heart
~~im on book seven in the ln raws (as in about to start book seven), i am not allowed to build on theories anymore~~
ye lol
~~uuuuuu i wont be able to watch it for a while since im on a trip~~
like the entire last three episodes there’s a rly big fight that goes down so that’s probably? why it has some reuse
the next three episodes
they may be saving for the later scenes since there’s a rly big fight that’s gonna happen in like
ohno
the prototypical “dark magical girl” who codified a lotta the tropes and made it popular
of beastars and hoseki fame???
c-co animated with studio orange????
~~never head of it~~
~~great track record~~
~~most of those are rly good shows so like~~
am i forgetting any?
3hz is flip flap, healer girl, princess principle, sao:a, andddd
it’s no biggie, take your time
eheheh
~~and read the ln too~~
one of my faves
eyyyy
was i favor the villainess already mentioned?
i'll put it on the to read list
ohhhhh
i've never heard of it
ooo? what's the premise of this one
also the action is extremely good
i also second the executioner and her way of life rec, it’s personally my favorite and has some great characters and worldbuilding
the official translated name is “i’m in love with the villainess”
that’s “i favor the villainess”
a nitroplus writer huh
so i think i understand where you’re coming from
imho, i found the main relationship in that one kinda unfufilling and a bit well, couldnt connect
but i wasnt expecting the budget to go like that for this ep
big fights coming up
five?
but still jeez, i know there's like
they did make it pretty funny with that
god, honestly i cant hate how low budget it is since like
oh god they have no budget this episode huh
im finally getting aroudn to watching it lol
<@213645184125239317> i see what you mean that executioner episode eight is very janky
||rereading the manga for refreshers, i think you're on the right track. we dont actually have an answer for it at the point the story is at now but it has a solid amount of evidence||
~~im trying to catch up and find where i left off~~
oh wait i did read this part, it's just been a while since it happened that i've forgotten
~~i've gotta actually catch up with the manga, i left off a while back like during the satsuki's dad intro~~
oh god i am *behind* huh
it’s pretty good
oh people are reading liar satsuki
oh didnt see it
like in asian cultures
i mean, dragons have also been used as representations for good in the past
i liked elaina as well but also i tend to like selfish protagonists and travel stories so pretty well up my alley
ooo
~~the novels i mean~~
~~maybe i should pick up elaina~~
oh you’re right she is very cute
>has not read the lns
elaina’s broom is a character?
what’s the english title
<:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984> mystery you say?
nope, but it is when my other favorite character is introduced
there’s a lotta changes that have been made that make it just work for me a lot better, plus it made me actually grow fond of manon who i didnt really have much of an opinion of in the novels
i say this as someone who considers book two her least favorite in the series
also as an aside, these last few episodes have been just a pretty spectacular adaptation of volume two
||ye, it’s a pretty easy mistake, especially only seeing the first novel events, but as the series progresses, akari’s just kinda at heart a pretty goofy person ~~tho also acting goofy is her main coping mechanism for all the shit she’s dealing with as well~~||
||akari’s also just naturally just kinda a goof, so even with timeloop memories, in a less directly “need to move now” situation, she’ll naturally act a bit more goofy||
||it’s also the first time we’ve seen her in a situation (first extended scene i mean) where menou isnt directly in danger, so she isnt as hurried||
||as such, the self assured personality she showed during the orwell fight doesnt come out because she *isnt* assured on what’s happening since it’s never happened before||
essentially: ||this is the first time we’ve seen loops memory akari in a situation she hasnt experienced before||
||i will explain shortly||
||none of which are spoilers||
||oh, it’s for a few reasons||
if i was being really greedy i’d really hope for a season three ~~since book five is the best one currently~~ but like that seems like it could be too far of a wish lmao
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
mayhaps
it’s a shame that the anime’s gonna cut off before my (currently) second favorite novel in the series tho, i wanna see my other fave animated uuuu
~~now read the novels~~
yes
ahehehehe, you’re on the wild ride now
not yet, ~~but they might as well have~~, they're still dealing with a lotta shit to be able to actually kiss
executioner?
and it was released in 2016 so judging from the timeframe (quick google search shinkalion is 2015?) i think maybe youtube had just started getting popular around that time in jp so a few anime were trying to get in on it with characters?
i remember digimon applimonsters also had an elementary school youtuber
one of the best anime this season
eyyyy
executioner’s artist sometimes draws the characters weirdly hornyly
a well executed one in the anime, mind you, but it's still a battle shonen yeah
but yeah, demon slayer is very much a shonen anime that uses shonen tropes
can things that have somewhat mature themes and imagery not also use the power of friendship?
who
||the artist for executioner doesnt usually draw the more gorey moments since like, executioner's not a horror novel, so this scene was Exactly As Fucked Up As Described in the narration without images||
||YEP, PANDEMONIUM IS FUCKED UP||
||i'm only noting this because it's a bit of a translation quirk||
||also, genuinely i wasn't expecting them to translate "白の勇者" as "Ivory Hero" like they do with the novel, I was expecting them to translate it as "Hero of White" or "White Hero" given that earlier they translated a part referring to them as "White"||
||and not just a worldbuilding detail||
||but ye, now you know that the four great human errors are, you know, A Factor||
||honestly, i kinda wish that the manon fight was a bit longer, but like, episode 10 out of 12, they'd only be able to do so if it were thirteen eps||
||it's one of the reasons i like the anime's version here a bit more, even if a few things were better with narration||
||i rly like the anime keeping it a secret, it was getting my giddy to seeing people react||
||like, in the novel, due to the prologue showing her, we kinda already got the impression that the little girl with Manon was like, definitely the one pulling the strings (we just didn't know she was the Human Error Pandemonium)||
||i can finally kinda talk about her and that the anime did a *fucking great job* rearranging stuff from book two to make this like *a twist*||
||pandemonium's first appearance||
||ahehehe||
hai
that's just different grammer parts
that's not an exception
like
yes because like, those are all different grammatical structures?
yes, because the conditional varients are different for each of the verb and adjective types just like most rules in jp
but the exceptions are really easy to remember tho
really? it's pretty simple more or less, plus the rules are, for the most part, pretty big
kanji are bitch
yeah
pffffh
~~or fantranslate it myself but that's too much work, probably.~~
ahehehehe
which means i will continue to suffer being unable to say shit about later events
so i am literally three books ahead of most people in the western sphere
because i have enough knowledge of jp to more or less read it if i can get the kanji pronounciations (which my reading apps do)
i am way too far ahead even in the lns
fool
aheheheh
unrelated, half of me discussing executioner weekly with folks is just Me Suffering unable to say stuff from the ln
well i wouldnt say she's a fave of mine since i only really started getting really found of her recently but like, i definitely like her and what she represents
manon is
ahehehehehe
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
read the light novel
it's so weird to say it like that since usually it's like "Dont watch the anime" but this time it's "dont read the manga"
also dont read the manga, it's not a great adaptation
it's also pretty gay, about like hibimiku or madohomu levels currently
~~also i get to see my girl animated finally~~
i would love a s2 and s3 since books five and six are the first major arc's ending
and ||menou sitting in the same position when talking to momo the second time||
makes sense why there were so many reused shots
ahehehe, they were very much saving for the big fight at the end of book two so like
i recognize the art
yeah i read this one
i barely remember it tho but the premise does sound very familiar
oh! i think i have
~~as someone who has already read both, both of them are Extremely Good~~
ganbare
packed reading schedule
isnt that rly close to executioner book five dropping too?
which website is this
where do you live
||IT’S THE FORMER IDEA THAT’S BEING PART THREE||
I JUST READ THE NEWEST BLOG
FUCK YES
||plus im interested in what mei and alea would get up to in their story after a timeskip||
||i might be crazy since a ton of other fans rly want to see more rei and claire as the protagonists and think this is rly interesting, which it is, but like, i just think rei and claire’s story is finished after part two||
honestly it’s just that ||time travel would kinda make it like, all but the four charas who retain memories just go backwards in development and stuff imho. I mean, obviously Things Are Weird like there’s people who arent supposed to be there or who didnt exist and the like, it just i feel like it negates too much imo||
yeahh
||i really hope the author goes with the former tbh, but fan responses seemed to be more in favor of the latter so like, uuuu||
||the author has two ideas for part three, one focusing around claire and rei’s kids and the other focusing around rei and claire dealing with being sent back in time but things are Weird now||
part three im mostly just worried it’s gonna revolve around the same cast since like, i feel like they’re story is done tbh
but ye part 2 is rly good as a continuation since it’s fun to see the characters continue to grow as they confront all the stuff in it
webnovel reader here lol
<:ElfneinSmug:688236836891656246>
||part 2 is books three through five||
||resolved in part 2||
im not sure how i feel about the author planning a part three now tho because part 2 basically wrapped up anything that could be considered oddities from part one so like yeah
this is true, i felt the same after completing part one, but part two absolutely fucks and is rly rly good
pls, part 2 of IFTV is the best part
honestly personally i just think it should’ve ended with the first book since like…where do you go after beating the game lol (i mean in-universe the game has sequels but still)
you can only drag it out so long as well, my friend told me they were getting tired of it too lol
according to my friend who read the novels, basically every starting harem member but geordo and maria kinda just dip into the background after a certain point
and they do basically nothing with that plotline
whatcha reading
murasaki no qualia i assume
book six has a very abs picture of her
i mean
she is described as buff tho
nilitsu cant draw abs
~~i really want your thoughts afterward since book three is my favorite character's introduction~~
gotchaaaaaa
also speaking of the novel version, isk have you started book three yet?
coward
also read the novels ash
||and yeah probably||
ahehehehe
||unless that was mentioned in one part that i skimmed over in book four, im *pretty sure* that didnt happen in the novel||
hmmm
||from the poison?||
||hm||
||also still havent watched the ep over here||
||whatcha refering to||
just normal kids show things
tho six has pretty much *most* of the outstanding arc one questions answered, but like, god i cant fucking talk about any of it
books five and six recontextualize even more
it’s great
~~book seven’s epilogue reveal was aaaaa~~
~~i hope book eight gets announced soon as well~~
you’ll definitely want a season three because book five is peak
as a whole i think the book’s better at characterizing everyone due to the narration and stuff
either that or a two core s2
||legally not allowed to say||
||book four’s climax is, without spoiling too much, intentionally a quiet moment||
||tho if they’re changing something like this, im a bit worried if they do a season 2 because like||
perhaps perhaps
if not booooo i wanna see sahara animated
tho that makes me kinda curious about if they do a season two
ye
|| https://youtu.be/wrBDo-BYp9A||
HM <@!213645184125239317> i watched the episode twelve preview on youtube and it looks like they’re changing the climax a bit for some reason
||soul marriage||
vol 5 is best
probably will release early next year
book six is also not released in english yet

||especially post book five and six||
||there’s more in the lns, but menou very clearly also develops romantic feelings there||
~~and akari constantly flirting with menou doesnt pass your bar?~~
book three ||akari and momo are menou’s most precious people||
vague book five spoilers ||soul marriage||
~~fenny you’ve read book three already you should know~~ ||essentially, soul is who you are (your personality, your memories, everything that makes you you) and also the thing you control guiding force through, Spirit is basically how much guiding force you have and how powerful it is (and some other stuff iirc), and body is your body||
oh i can actually explain the three parts that define life in executioner if you want since in the show, soul and spirit have very specific meanings
~~light novels akari’s actually playing up the moans in the narration to flirt~~
i mean, that guy only exists to show what menou’s job it and get murdered (this is not a spoiler it happens in the first thirty pages)
yeah, executioner’s main focus isnt the romance but it’s still an extremely prominent aspect
very there in the anime
it’s still
like, the executioner anime is *slightly* less explicit than the lns but also like
literally everyone else in the room is saying it’s yuri
gotchaaaaa
speaking of which, you gonna continue book three soon?
boo, gonna have to hope for another season to see my fave animated then
gotcha
||flare?||
ohohohoh
||oh, that wasnt what i was wondering about, half of me was hoping there'd be like, a hint about book three at the end||
~~is there an aftercredits this ep btw?~~
that's true
as an aside, if this is an anime original ending (and they just intend to end it here) instead of just an anime original climax than like, uhhhhh, why the fuck did they put that one detail in episode one lmfao
||i still need to watch these episodes tho so like, yeah||
||if she teleported it woudl fuck with some stuff for book three and onward if they even plan to adapt that far since menou's not supposed to know akari has powers other than specifically the auto regression||
anyway, continuing my point from earlier, i'd say that my book ranking is probably like (in terms of best to worst)

Five
Three (Though this is mostly due to the climax being so good, and it introduces my favorite character)
Four and Seven
Six and One
Two
||and she doesnt want to forget her time with menou||
||if she uses anything higher than "suspension" the memory consumption is *very high*||
||i mean||
book seven i'd say is around book four in terms of enjoyment, so definitely above book one and two and such
book six is like, i am legally obligated not to comment on but it's the end of arc one basically
books three through five are absolutely bonkers and rly good tho
but as a standalone, book 2 is definitely the worst in the series
it gets better with like, later knowledge
book two is less good than the first one
as a ln reader that kinda tracks
||animated sahara now please.||
||regardless i do hope there’s a s2 since like||
||yeah, so like, hopefully they’ll keep four’s climax the way it is in the novels||
||yeah that too, again the novels just have a lot more time to show everything and all that||
||it’s very intentionally a quiet tense moment in the novels||
||i will state again, i am worried now since in a hypothetical season 2 they might change book four’s climax to be more action when uh||
||mostly because it would’ve felt like a repeat of book one’s climax otherwise i think||
||yeah, pandemonium gets resealed after summoning the huge monster because fog properties in the novel||
||i mean, she might do it in the future, the aim is currently the sword of salt lol||
plus, at the point we’re at in the light novels (in jp) there are hints that something interesting to do with her is being set up
ashuna has a really good brain too
yeeeee
but in the novels you really get to see how cool their fighting styles are
like, due to her being not the protagonist, in the anime they spent less budget on her (and to a lesser extent momo)’s fights, especially early on
the fight scenes with her are much cooler in the novels
tho also
ashuna’s mostly there as a counterbalance to the main cast as she’s just pretty simple and fun, i dont particularly think she needs much depth and also like, it is funny that the battle hungry princess is genuinely the most mentally stable of anyone here
which is pretty interesting
namely im pretty sure we learn more about her relationship with her big sister
ashuna is literally the least interesting character in the novels imo buuuuuuuuut she does get more elaborate in there too
but i’d still say the lns are worth the read if you got even the slightest interest from the anime since like, imho they’re generally the best way to experience the story
plus i do think manon is done a lot better here
i’d say the anime’s still a fine adaptation and gets most things right
that gets elaborated on a lot a lot more
oh also they didnt show the full backstory with momo as well
akari definitely comes across better in the novels, but i’d say menou’s inner world is shown better there too
i’d say the anime doesnt actually capture how cool most of em are
and the action scenes are very well written to the point where like
the books are better and explore the characters more on depth
new mononoke film!! i love that series
ohohohohoh
READ IT
i mean, i have the same problem sometimes so that's fair but also
ahehehehe

tch
six and seven likely comes out in 2023
five comes out in septemberish
they're at book four
aheheheh
but yeah, i have no fucking idea why books one through three's cover's are so horny
book seven’s (spoilered since it is minor spoilers)
book five’s cover
and book seven's
at least book five's cover looks cool
nilitsu is just a very horny artist i assume
this is the reason i cant read this book in public
||yeah, maybe that’s what’s going on||
||but that doesnt make sense unless she knows||
||she *thinks* it’s the 2nd so it is the second now?||
||yeah, or maybe it’s like, it is a dream but nana still thinks it’s real and has somehow broken out of the loop and is working on that assumption and since it’s her brain it’s like||
||honestly this one’s leaving me genuinely stumped||
||hmmmm, i think you’re probably on the right track||
||since she seems genuinely shocked to hear the black haired girl died||
||maybe it’s something like, if the user’s emotions go out of wack, she ends up slipping in her control of the situation?||
||yeah god||
||maybe it is time travel? or maybe it’s not? and what the hell is nana’s gambit here||
||oh, it probably is a dream? due to the first half, especially given the words the other girl said but then *that* happened???||
||yeah???? genuinely at this point i dont know what is happening in this arc, like i was like||
||uhhhhhh what the fuuuuuck?||
<@213645184125239317> new nana
no
~~also they're tame in terms of the gruesomeness if you've read roll over and die ~~
yeah the fights are great in the novels
but ye, guiding force is the better translation basically, ether is a bit of uhhhhhh not great as a translation for it
yeah that's probably why
or as another friend of mine theorizes, someone played ff8 and had war flashbacks about "GF" and stuff like that lol
on accident
tfw sending something before spoiling it
||there's also another thing later on that it is definitely supposed to be "Guiding Force" and not "Ether" which has now gotten me irrationally mad at the "Ether" translation||
i didnt need to spoil it
that part wasnt spoilers
the first basically meaning "to guide" and the second meaning "power"
essentially, in the jp Guiding force is made of the kanji 導 and 力
;^)
but i wont unless you want me to go off
as someone who reads the raws
guiding force is the better translation for a variety of reasons i could get into
yeah
||"momo i saved your crush lol"||
i wouldnt recommend reading it at al
back on that topic real quick
like, the manga's just a rly bad one, it feels extremely tonally wrong in most moments and the art is uh, not very good
|||princess carrying your crush's crush as a powermove||
||there's literally a line in book six where she's like "I'm going to correct you, Menou is *not* the one I like." and then immediately begins daydreaming about momo||
ashuna doesnt even like menou lmao
there *is* technically a mange but like it's significantly worse as an adaptation
~~menosaha or menoaka is where it's at~~
momo menou is the boringest menou ship
no good ones
aheheheh
tfw i cant send because two of them have outright spoilers and the other two have big implication
out of the images, my favorite spreads are prolly one in book four, both in book six, and the character one in book seven
book three has one of momo and ashuna that you'll prolly be interested in
ye
yeeeeeeee, big posters
sameeeeeeeeee
it’s pretty cute so far
and then like three days and the first serial chapter dropped
i read the one-shot like not even a week before i learned it got liscenced
oh i’ve also been reading this one lol
we dont have a :shakesfist: emote so i cant react to this with it rip
||like if you dont get to see how much akari hates herself and cares about menou you wont rly get the full picture i think, even if you get the surface||
||along with only having books one and two to work with lol||
||well, the anime makes her seem a bit more manipulative due to not including as many monologues and showing stuff the first time round||
like, ||initial timeline akari is a lot quieter, and it’s also heavily implied, especially in book four, that the ditzy act is kinda her way of coping with a lotta the stresses of the world. As well, just having it have a little more breathing room lets her ditziness feel nicer to read||
yeahhhh, the novels get you to kinda understand why she’s the way she
but like, you can get her from watching the anime
menou’s also slightly worse in this respect since you dont get as many internal scenes to really get to understand her
but yeah, i can understand not liking her from seeing just the anime
again, akari’s comes off a lot better in the novels ~~and gets very good after book four~~
we'll have to see <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
||and left in the thing that immediately lets you know that pandemonium is evil instead of making it a twist, which is like, cut it the other way around||
also they left out the really important reveal of ||flare killing menou being the thing to cause akari to loop, killing the dramatic irony going into book two||
at all times
like, it's just very janky
||doing a movie!||
there’s no anger spray emotes here
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
one moment
||she has five? girls with a crush on her at this point in the novels||
||also it’s menou’s harem lol||
||die||
||ahehehehe, absolutely permadead||
and then season 3 to see two others on my top five on screen
i need season 2 to see my fave animated smh
~~tho you should read from the start too if you wanna read the lns~~
dont worry she gets a lot more screentime in the following books
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990> oh right
tbf, it's usually isk who tells you to read the manga not me
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
sorry bout that
so i am not qualified to say what’s different for nana’s anime vs manga
the anime version
watch
didnt
okay, i uh
uhhhhh
show
~~the novels~~
anime or manga ~~has not watched/read either~~, from what i've heard the manga is a bit longer?
sent this link rather than the mangadex link since ch3 was uploaded here and still hasnt on mangadex
https://dynasty-scans.com/series/how_do_i_get_together_with_my_childhood_friend manga im sure some people here will be interested in
~~i very much remember seeing people react and theory crafting with the novels as they watched~~
yeah exactly
if you wanna go insane watch order (this is mostly a joke) you can watch the first season while reading the washio sumi novels that released during it and have a fragment of the watching weekly experience
same, tho to be fair im not watching much this season since not much looks interesting lol
and cinamatography
at the very least, the direction in this first episode was rly rly good
lycoris recoil is pretty fun so far, hopefully it stays good lol
ye, claire's pov
https://twitter.com/gomanga/status/1543347293474246656?t=hGiYy36JHgqf0QVQ_9Z0cQ&s=19 poggers
||~~tfw you learn you can call yourself through your arm~~||
ahhhhh
or is it just a manga
is the ln any different
i've only read the manga for that one
uuuuuuu
does seven seas tend to take a while to translate?
i havent read the webnovel version yet, i've jsut heard about it through one of my other friends and also seeing the author retweet things about it on twitter
it's okay
<:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
it has its own mysteries, some new supporting characters (some of whom are surprisingly important to the overall plot from what i gather), and some things to do with one of the bigger twists in part two (specifically in the part book five will cover)
aheheh
tfw i cant judge because i had them laying around for like half a year before actually reading it
machikado is very good
haiii
aight have fun ~~also maybe try the novels it’s an adaption from as well they’re very good~~
tho not sure if it matches the description of something fenny shills often
shokei shoujo if you’re looking for the jp title of that one
halfway through the episode
fifteen minutes in?
you'll see at about uhhhhh
lmao
did you skip buying book four?
yeah
ash will deny it but dont listen, it’s about as gay as symphogear maybe even a little more
in the novels especially
yes
yeeeeeeee
it is technically, if the premise for part three doesnt change, the end of rei and claire's story
i mean
love that they say "final volume" when the author is starting to plan out part three lmao
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
~~honestly we might get a flashback with her later since like, there's gotta be a reason she got so strong and stuff~~
also, there's an in-character twitter for the cafe
takina's also really fun, i like how her like stoic contrasts with chisato and just how out of her depth she with like, taking to the cafe stuff
~~also i like takina trying to shoot chisato with the rubber band at the end but missing~~
the action's very fun
lycoreco is really good so far still
what one is this
sameeeee
eyyyyy nice nice nice
Yeah
~~especially if it’s gay~~
~~or just two characters sharing a body who are able to be shipped together~~
~~plus i am partial to bodysharing romances~~
tbh yeah
unfortunately from the looks of that one, it looks like it’s not gonna be gay but like, the art’s very good and the story is pretty fun
there’s a novel version of it too it seems
it *does* fall into the trap of making the “heroine” evil but like, the story couldnt happen many other ways so it gets a pass, plus she’s a reincarnator as well so like, ye
gosh fun novel
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
voted yesterday over here
since both sound really good
i think you might just have a specific taste in voice
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/the_friend_of_my_friend_is_my_enemy#1 one shot some peeps here may enjoy
currently airing lycoris recoil might be good
the finale to just be her vs takina and takina to hit her
fully expecting
tbh, i am
chisato dodging bullets is great
also really good animation so far
yeeeee
very good show
~~i mean some dont and have other plots going on alongside the gay stuff~~
i mean if adapted, villainess will prolly go just until i think the school festival arc’s end, or at most the love scale’s arc’s end
if you doubt magirevo ||they do in fact kiss in the later novels too||
since now ||she has five retries||
||built so that nana can deal with bigger threats||
||plus it is a power that is definitely like||
yeeee
nothing to say much here, we just got the summation on how it works
nana's such a good manga
godddddd
very close faces there nana

<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
sauce?
nowayu deserved its own anime instead of just the highlight reel
ohhh
and you have the physicals for three and four?????
still if you got the time for it go for it
that would be good, tho part two was written some time after part one (books one and two) and it is kinda a new start in a way
september sixth
oh two days
when’s five come out again
that is also a good idea
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
ahehe
https://dynasty-scans.com/series/i_see_you_aizawa_san manga some people here may enjoy, basically like mieruko-chan but yuri with a ghost
ohh
so it might be just jumping the gun and the like
yeah big announcement in the next magizine update basically
lemmie check once again real quick in the chapter pageee
yeah they did mention a special announcement in the next chapter
oh damn
MEGIREVOOOOO
we're finally starting the more serious arcs and all that
yee
it's a good adaptation, tho it hasnt really gotten to the juicy bits of the narrative yet
but also villainess' manga is ongoing too so yeah idk
and you're gonna wanna maximize profits and so if a series is complete there's less sales you'll get from it since people wont buy the new books since there is no new books
since adaptations boost sales and all that
that might actually be the reason for it not getting one, but iirc the web version of magirevo is also complete so
well
and it's not like iftv isnt complete, it's complete and the novels are completely released
same honestly?
iftv even scores well on most want to get animated polls it's on too
uuuu
no this is "magical revolution of the reincarnated princess and the genius young lady" which is a ln with a really good manga adaptation (havent read the ln itself yet, will get to it eventually)
they're very fun
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
ahehehe
also left out an extremely important plot detail
emphasis on the wrong things, janky art, just in general weird framing
the manga  is Not Great
||well, not completely but for the most part||
||but yeah the gang’s completely back together now||
||if this is jin im gonna lose my mind||
<@213645184125239317> new nana
whew whew whew this is fun
~~but i will read it regardless~~
~~i dont think you ever recommended this one to me yet~~
yeah and they make pretty explicitly gay stuff in general so it is likely
~~i really liked catalus too so it’s prolly gonna be good~~
oh! i thought i recognized the artstyle, it’s by the same person as catulus
oh my god this one’s rly rly rly fun
yes
i mean, you read other light novels too soooo
ahehehe
at least in my experience reading it
the scenes are pretty visual in general so you’ll have a good idea what’s going on methinks
ahehehe
volume three and four are fucking amazing tho ~~plus you get to meet my fave in three~~
the anime goes till the end of volume 2 ye
which means afterward you’ll only have one more book before getting into the non-adapted ones
niceeeeee
ahehehe
way more in depth on how guiding force and invocations work just in general
it also goes like
yeah
but yeah, the fights and gay moments are Way stronger in the novels
i was expecting five more months
oh you’re reading it lol
oh wait is ln volume two out?
||anise really sweeping away all of her brother’s fiancés||
oooo
~~or they ruin her characterization and i complain very loudly~~
god i want a season two since then my fave actually gets animated and i get to never shut up about her
i give it two years
sometimes you like to have light reading
ahhhh i getcha
weird, never had that problem
that’s just you lol, as someone who reads these as lns first it’s very understandable imo
how’d you enjoy
eyyyyyy
just read through this one, it’s very fun but also hoping it’s gay
ohhh
ohhhhh
is the full anywhere?
ooooo
||the way her face was drawn in the modern day is also quite similar||
||genuinely i keep forgetting about it until you remind me lol||
||as for nana's brother, honestly i think it might just not be important, as of now anyway||
||like can no longer use talent, suspiciously noted||
||rin is definitely jin right?||
||uh, anyway also||
||OWOWOWOWOW, wowwww kyoya's backstory||
||hhhhhh||
||that's her first name right||
||er||
||hhhhh, i just call her michiru tbh||
||GUHHHHH, that'd genuinely be so funny||
||if nana's talent is just being talentless, like she's technically talented but without a talent||
||honestly, it'd be very funny||
||yeah||
||it's implied she's away from tsuroka and the like i think||
||she's in an ambigous state, last time we saw her was before the timeskip in the hospital||
either nanax||inugami|| or ||moe||
seriously wonder what the endgame endgame is gonna be at this point but im on for the ride
ahehehehehe
||maybe he'll show up in a later storyline but rn we're just left ambiguous||
||as for the nana's brother thing, i think he was probably like a red herring for kyoya||
||yepp||
||guess it does make sense since his talent's limitation is years and memories||
||unrelated, it is pretty surprising that kyoya is a lot older than the cast in general||
||***oh no***||
||***oh***||
||it's narrated by rin||
~~also yes i did just neuron activate when i saw people talking executioner again lmao~~
i genuinely do not get the intent behind this change lmao
im not gonna go on since i will be talking for like five minutes if i do
like, this isnt me complaining being like "they changed a phrase so it's bad" no good ahead and change phrases to make it flow better, jp and english are very different languages. but this is just breaking a very clear intentional parallel in format
i have many feelings about this.
like, in the jp version the prologues of book one and five are written the same way in the same format with many repeated phrases (tho obviously key differences) and the en translation didnt do that even tho they *did* have a specific format they did for book one's prologue
god, they fucked up the translation of the prologue by not keeping the parallel format between it and the book one prologue...and also cutting out like half a page which further adds to the parallel
books six and seven are rly good too but five is Extremely
~~best book imo, at least as someone who reads the raws~~
speaking of which book five did come out like yesterday
since she's supposed to be
i dont think nillistu can draw buff people lmao, im so glad the anime animators just made ashuna buff
oh huh, starhusk is also in the background i just noticed lol
tumby
since book seven has two characters (who are major in it) and from what's been set up for eight, there's two characters who are definitely gonna be major in it as well so
maybe they'll keep doing so for the books in part two, im expecting next book to have two certain characters in the background if they do so
tbf book seven is the only time so far more charas than just menou are shown
aheheheh
~~it's menou looking cool what more could you ask~~
~~well second best cover, seven's cover is better imo~~
~~i mean it's also the best cover so it'll look good on your shelf~~
since good god does the story get even more interesting afterwards especially into book seven (well arc 2 in general)
half a year at this point
mhm, genuinely been waiting to talk about it for like
the manga’s rly rly rly good, havent watched the anime yet
i remember trying em out before noticing the lns were fantranslated and read those instead ~~until like they took them down since it got licensed~~
the webnovel translations are quite bad
yeahhh
~~incidentally, i’ve read most of their other completed webnovels in raw jp and actually rank roll over pretty low out of their work lmao~~
the ln version’s somewhat different from the wn, in a good way, but like it’s also been stalled for two years because they left a character who died in the wn version alive and also a few other changes making the webnovel version of the next arc not work So
||webnovel version does end with the leads getting married||
the author doesnt shy away from girls kissing and getting into relationships by the end
well webnovel first
light novel
very much so
it’s never gonna get an anime because it is Yuri, action, horror (with bloody action scenes) which is like, two niche genres but like i’d want it
roll over and die
jesus typos
i want more like, cool action yuri to get adapted ~~and released~~
||honestly that’s what made me first think of the theory when we learned that jin wasnt the real appearance||
||definitely makes sense why the cat was kinda affectionate towards kyoya before being revealed to be jin now tho||
||very likely||
||also if she is jin and the author isnt pulling a fast one on us, all the somewhat shippy moments between jin and nana are now yuri moments btw||
||but yeah holy shit||
||true true||
||so this is where it started lol||
||i mean, she’s been gaslighting literally everybody since she was introduced, like that was literally the survival of the fittest arc lmao||
||definitely||
||but yeah jesus christ that chapter was intense||
||also yeah definitely jin right? like the butterfly right at the end with her wanting to become someone else||
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
gimmie a minute
oh it updated?
||tho the author does do a good cat and mouse game so like maybe not||
||probably||
||rebellion does seem sooner rather than later tho since they’ve kinda exhausted most of what they can do for this trickery arc||
||yeahh||
||these ones don’t look good||
||i do hope everyone gets new outfits soon||
||unrelated||
||not someone bringing her back by sacrificing their own life||
||oh wait no you’re talking about michiru bringing someone back||
||i feel like that’d be a cop-out but||
||what if nana||
||ah. Ah.||
||now if only michiru will resurrected uuuuu||
||also we get to make jokes about “I fucked your sister kyoya”||
||ye same||
||michiru, then moe, then if Rin is Jin that’s another, and also the time travel girl||
||also, can we say nana technically has a harem of girls now like||
||PLEASE||
||i thought it’d just be like “killing people each arc” and then the gimmick would wear thin but just as it started to feel kinda like that the actual plot developed way more||
||god i genuinely wasn’t expecting what a good journey it’d be watching her really become a hero||
||especially with the current point of her development she’s at||
||definitely||
||tho i do wanna see it revealed like, nana and co try to save her and immediately after she’s like “Nana you fool that was obviously a trap”||
||also yeah the other reason rin’s very likely not gonna die or the execution is gonna be pretend as a trap is that we need the formal reveal of her identity methinks||
prolly will cover ||till the timeskip||
definitely
||but again, probably took time to plan||
||okay it’s not actually immediately afterwards||
||yeee||
||keep in mind this is right after she tried to kill kyoya an arc ago i think||
||straight up calls for her attention here||
||i got the part where she had michiru hold the cat, aka Jin/probably Rin and wow||
||doing some rereading just a little ~~not in full since like, don’t have crunchyroll account and mangadex isnt as far as aggregator sites~~ but like wow i forgot how nana used to be a jerk||
||rereading the chapter and guhhhh they put a cat next to her right here||
read itttt
nana may or may not have gotten retroactively more yuri just now
||very likely||
||i think it’s connected to shifts in belief and personality||
||so it’s safe to say that they at least are partially derived from personality||
||nanao’s is another example, feeling talentless before it evolves after the general gives him advice||
||i think she was desperate for it? maybe||
||michiru’s healing for example||
||maybe? they seem to be based on personality traits at least||
||also also, with how much Rin wanted to disappear, it makes sense why “survival of the fittest”’s restriction is sight||
||well not the immediate next arc but i think there’s lotsa jin fuckery in “necromancer” and the two chapters right before survival of the fittest, which is still right after the explosion||
||IMMEDIATELY THE NEXT ARC AFTER IS SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST||
YEAH
||holy shit i think you’re right||
same tbh
iirc she’s already watched
so the rest of the dub quality is bad then
ohhhh
idk it sounds pretty good, and i've watched both versions, like nana's supposed to kinda sound like she's mocking her a little there
tfw not using the manga artstyle
genuinely, what you see as romantic interest is way higher than most peoples
the best pieces of media in it are the prequels, anything else is kinda middling
also imagine watching this and Wonder Egg while both were airing on like tuesdays
honestly, it genuinely got too uhhhhhhh Much for me in terms of Everything Happening that i did drop it lmao so it very well could happen
MHM
that's the feel lol
so much happens
it's great
the anime trying to be an idol show, scifi thriller, romance?, post apocalypse, and stage show and failing to be good at any of it
ah yes, gekidol
||definitely, tho not much to comment on yet||
<@213645184125239317> new nana chapter
half of these aren’t even isekai
oh wait what? i didn’t know that
ergo proxy
talentless nana is very good, the manga is still going strong too
yeyeye
also kinda surprised that it’s using the manga artstyle and not the ln one
ohhhhh
who are the vas?
since the manga’s just like so good
honestly, the anime has the very unenviable task of competing with the manga
oooo
>still hasnt read volume one
oh volume three of magirevo dropped in en?
Tropical Rouge i have enjoyed from most of the episodes I’ve watched; it’s just the show always feels like it was written with Laura as the protagonist and not Manatsu and also hecking Sango is a non-character
all through Kirakira i like a lot; Kirakira tries really hard and has a lot of great ideas and great scenes and execution….It just flubs a bit of it a bit too often for me to fully like it like it
i do think uhhhh the yellow and purple cures sometimes feel out of place in their focus eps, but it is one i enjoyed a lot, especially later on
Star Twinkle’s really fun, especially when it starts to get going
don’t take this as an order of quality really tho since uhhhh, Mahoutsukai might be my favorite but it has problems lol
my personal ranking in terms of my favorites (favorite to least favorite) are:

Mahoutsukai
Gopri
Heartcatch
Hugtto
Suite
Star Twinkle
Dokidoki
Smile = Fresh 
Kirakira


Healing Good

i have not finished Hacha, Tropical Rouge, or the original through yes5 gogo
next season’s also an anniversary one tho so it might have a xover ep
Heartcatch is a bit different in a lot of ways (even if it’s also similar) so i’d definitely rec it later
which’ll give you an idea of what to expect from a general amount of the shows
Go Princess is my rec since it’s a really really well executed normal precure season
Heartcatch or Go Princess
that’s being generous
a shame it’s only in about 15ish episodes total
again best part of the show by a long shot
yeah
but it is One
they could’ve made it a full five and it’d have been satisfying
the plotline there was just like one episode!
she didn’t even have a proper team joining arc!
also the villain group has no chemistry which is Extremely Annoying since it comes right before tropre which has a villain group with great chemistry which made me realize that it was missing from healpre
since everything else is just boring
not enough to make it worth watching basically
well not salvage since it’s not a *bad* show
and is not enough to salvage the show imo
but like, it ends up just writing them in the most boring manner possible. The cures not named Nodoka feel like their archetypes, the moments that should hit really hard kinda fall flat or arent quite follow-up on well, there’s exactly one really really good storyline that is resolved satisfactorily but it is the only not boring thing about the show
it has so many good ideas that i’d love in a different season
it’s boring
~~incidentally the worst execution of the trope is Healing Good’s and she is Literally A Puppy how did they mess this one up~~
YES
not the best, not the worst, kinda falls into god baby territory but definitely not the worst execution of the trope
fuwa’s an alright fairy
well, she does also voice the lead cure of healing good precure
and she— oh wait this is a gear server
it is
||YEAH, i thought we’d have one more chapter of set-up with how it was initially presented but then “Oh shit”||
ah, yeah i genuinely forget about those ||~~though, it is important since Ain spends most of the story traumatized from it~~||
do you not see my icon
Mine would be (three of these are untranslated webnovels rip)

-Blood Princess Kill Them All

-Two as One Princesses

-Destiny Unchain Online

-Executioner and her way of life Full Part One (books one through six) adaptation

-Hitokui Tenisha (but like heavily rewritten since while i love this webnovel it also Sucks)

There’s more but I had to narrow it down somehow lmao
||whew, good chapter. Also another gay ship||
||AH SHIT||
<@213645184125239317> new nana
it’s still a little but it is mostly cute
the manga is not nearly this pervy iirc
very bad with fanservice holy fuck
oh that is
how bad is it with fanservice
part of the nowayu novel highlight reel
ln has been heavily edited and the manga and anime are based upon that updated version
webnovel turned light novel
but most in the western sphere call it magirevo
TenTen based on the jp name: “Tensei Oujyo to Tensai Reijyo no Mahou Kakumei”
ohh
which rumored ones?
they’re also definitely a little gayer in the novels before the very gay parts
beat me to it lol
oh really?
i just don't think ikuhara's very good at writing shows less than 26 episodes long
~~unfortunately will need to wait till s2 for that uuu~~
holy shit
magirevo episode one fucks hard
same lol
since you gotta use different tricks in anime vs ln vs manga
the anime original bits honestly convey the world build in the medium and set up the characters real well
yee
it's also apparently extremely good as a ln (still hasnt read the ln) so it's just a rare case that every single adaptation is fucking great
oh right claire pov, apparently it’s really good ||and has its own twists and turns||
Spoilers based on ln/webnovel/manga ||just wait till she does it again with his other fiance||
this one’s very very good
though there are notable exceptions
gender bender mcs tend to have more of a personality in these types of story
く - ku
ぐ - gu
yeah g is just k with dakuten indicating it’s a closed mouth movement
but yeah the most you’ll get in the picked-up works in way of girl to guy is a supporting cast member to the main guy to girl protagonist
it’s also a double niche so like likely wouldnt get adapted either
however slight
since it’s more socially acceptable  for women to act masculine than men to act feminine
and even with the ones targetted to women, from what i’ve seen it’s more likely to be crossdressing if they do gender fuckery than straight up gender bender
tho since i don’t seek out girl to guy genderbenders, i wouldn’t know one to predict with it lmao
yeah, pretty much. Granted, i wouldn’t be surprised if one eventually gets adapted into anime given that genderbender lns and manga seem to be getting more adaptations but it’ll probably take a good while beforehand
since it’s more marketable to the male otaku if it’s guy to girl
like, unless the girl to guy genderbent character is a supporting cast member in a guy to girl one, you tend to not see it
demographics and all that
well like they’re mostly webnovel that don’t get translated, hence my thing about how it’s more common for the guy to girl ones to get adapted or picked up than the other way around
they do exist i will tell you, it’s just they don’t commonly get adapted since guy to girl genderbender is more popular than girl to guy genderbender
i think later it does but the anime is not getting to it
~~i need to read the lns~~
tbh most characters not named nanoha, fate, hayate, or like the book of darkness people just keep not showing up
aight tell me what happened there
<@213645184125239317> new nana chapter but i think i may have missed the last one and can’t see it since i dont have crunchyroll premium
Yes
no time
unfortunately
i’ve been meaning to
guhh
genuinely one of the few precure seasons with a listenable out of show opening
ye
ahh
~~i havent watched avatar~~
or different chara
the boulder?
i need to catch up actually
kk
dess_lq
dess_next
why's this still playing while nobody's there
why do you keep looping the same song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNFdHbJvIeM
at least that's what i heard
i mean isnt he good at spamming NP even without the damage boost?
like in fgo
how good/bad is he btw
i heard people talking about cardboard
caster
well a lot of us play it why?
na or jp
kk
didnt know whoops
oh okay
genocide?
oh okay
like commands similar to chris doesn't dess
what other commands can kirichan do
i mean i have a friend that's doing text based and they say its going well
im asking because i dont wanna use voice chat if we play
does it use voice chat
oh okay
wait what's going on?
sure why not
i'll read the rulebook later, im gonna go to sleep soon
so where's the OVA rulebook?
yeah, i dont really think i'd like maid
hmmm, so in your opinion would both the tabletop games we're voting on be easy to pick up?
oh okay
i've never actually played a tabletop game before, so which is the easiest to pick up
what about ova?
so what are general rules each
alright im going to sleep now
i voted roleplay, but i feel like i'd probably want at least a little combat in it
could you send me the rules for magical burst?
magical burst?
what the fuck
yeah i would probably appreciate voice without mic
yeah pressed queue
already did i think
okay i clicked guest log in
what do i click to join
i think i get the gist of the rules now, i'll join and see how i do
reading the yaku list right now
i mean could i just listen in to you teaching without actually talking? or is there a chat room function on the thing?
no
i might play then
oh okay
if we play do we have to use voice chat?
is that the xenosaga or xenogears thing or something different
but when it gets going it gets going
oh, it's a very good game, just the plot's a bit slow before it really gets going
how far are you in the game?
i dont like pyra's design just in general
the english voices are still good, just they arent nearly as good as the japanese ones in my opinion
the english voices are passable, the japanese voices are really good
she's also voiced by elfnein's voice actor in the Japanese version
i love that game
XB2!!
yeah the other tank blade user is amazing
oh okay
i didnt use poppi much, but that's probably cause i just wasnt good at the game that you get her upgrades through
plus once you're skilled enough, charging driver arts kinda become a non-issue
dont have any left
not if they're on nia, who doesnt have the best hp
well, feel good you didnt get them on nia like i did
didnt like that one
yeah
oh yeah, the aoi yuuki blade
yep
just wish they went through a few more revisions of the script and realized that it didnt fit with the theme
that's my main problem with the ending though, the rest was really good
hence why that one moment in the  ending made me really mad, since it didnt fit with the theme the game was showing
the themes of the game were moving into the future but keeping the past with you and learning from it, and not to let the past shackle you down
also yeah it was
honestly it would've been more thematically coherent with the rest of the game if that didnt happen (the part i didnt like in the ending)
i didnt like one part of s thing that happened in the ending
that whole chapter was great
oh cool
but knowing xb1 just makes that moment a lot better
(there's also a small connection to xb1 in the story of xb2 that if you want the full holy shit of it you need to know the xb1 story, but xb2 is perfectly playable without any of the context from xb1)
also xb1 is also a great game, you should watch an lp of it if you wanna see it's story and didnt like the camera controls
i wont spoil anything for xb2 for you, but a thing in the same shape is also important here
i got a switch because i wanted XB2
a nintendo babby
usually it sounds like she's cut off
the end is weirdly coherent
im pretty sure it does
i just refer to them as each interchangably
eh they mean about they same thing
right
but also you throw them when using blade combos
and one is kosmos and another is t-elos
there are rare blades in xenoblade 2
i got t-elos in ng+
Futaba is <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
oh nice
oh right yeah that would be good
three of the main blades are fire
oh wait forgot
well like i didnt have much issues with that part
i always had both of them on the same party
i didnt have a problem with that because well
so you will likely have a fire blade on your team most of the time
yeah two of the main blades are fire
might be lightning because of all the machinery
oh she looks cool
what's her name
oh nice
oh yeah wasnt G like not a thing when the game came out?
i love SRPGs
oh nice
what's it about
nice
how is it?
along with Chris
