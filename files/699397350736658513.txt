Why is the country of Iceland here
Nice banner

Another person
Person
There are multiple
Cryptids
That's probably the most sensible thing they've done
We are kinda crazy here
Welcome
They are terrified of friendly people
Oh nice

EVERYONE IS HERE
COLORS WEAVE INTO A SPIRE OF FLAME
And Miku is just there

Edelgard did nothing wrong
Miku would die of blood loss
Yeah of course the best characters from Both games are siblings

The stray is taking a ride
Bernie
I've seen enough to know that a girl with a massive weapon is probably a badass as big as said weapon
Good
Small girl + big weapon
Oh hey ruri
Nya
OH GOD SHE TURNED HERSELF INTO A BEYBLADE
she's adorable
Gen becomes so pissed he can kill gods
Oh god she's gonna destroy the city
It's adorable
Like she's one of the tallest Mario characters
Also really tall
pretty
Get a room you two
Might not see a new chapter for a while
Yeah that sucks
Cute
Well that's a massive red flag
Of course he is
Jesus Christ I knew the book was bad but not that bad
Huh
A man has fallen in Lego city
HEY
Aren't those targeted
Ok so what
Oh but if we have universal healthcare everything will take longer
Yeah well if it's so good then why do people always complain about it
Im pretty sure that's most of the world
Then you can just do whatever you want
Actually all you need is money
If you are a straight white cis male who doesn't have any mental issues maybe
Yeah land of the free
That sounds terrible
The term came from signs posted that "colored people" had to leave town byÂ sundown.
Basically means a place that is all white who REALLY hate people who aren't
We also still have sundown towns
Yeah it's REALLY STUPID
Welcome to Florida
Abortion illegal trans people illegal actually you know what being smart illegal
See that's reasonable
Well now I hate my own country even more than I already do
Well our politicians make sure of that
Oh god I just realized im pretty sure the same thing would happen here
Yay people being pieces of garbage
Mostly because they kinda don't really care about that
Yeah that sounds right
Or really anyone
Yeah well you can't expect conservatives to be smart
Well that's not suspicious at all
You know to weed out the nearly non-existent fake trans people
Well they have to REALLY MAKE SURE YOU WANT THIS
Really all they do is put a bandaid on a gaping wound
Probably because the problem is usually so bad they can't do anything
I'm not trans but still
God I'm lucky I live in a blue state
Yeah it sounds like this man literally has fuck you money
YEP DEFINITELY A VILLAIN
This man is a legit supervillain isn't he
Is Florida ok
What the fuck
Rip
Oh wow people still don't know the meaning of the Z symbol
That sounds like a really stupid way to get yourself  banned
Rules for thee but not for me
I mean the second favorite pastime of politicians is already illegal
Because they are rich
Because it wouldn't affect them
No they would
Actually anyone who isn't them
And poor people
Unfortunately they just hate women
What even is this country
Jesus
Don't know why they would
There are still the negotiations
Unfortunately it was just a vote
That's good
My grandma lives near one
Hey we have pretty lakes
AND I LIVE NEAR DC SO ALL THIS SHIT HAPPENS BASICALLY NEXT DOOR TO ME
I hate this country
N I C E
What even is this world
FOR A NFT
HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS
What the fuck
Like you can see it from her back door
No just her house is a short walk to her dock
Actually no she lives on one
But all that other stuff is definitely an upgrade
Wow
Oh wow who could have predicted this
Like maybe a 30 minute drive
Of course it might be because the capital is right there
I mean where I live the only guns there are BB guns
Because it's not a school
But the police will definitely stop you then
So it equals out
But hey you can very easily get a gun here
Yeah that's a given
A year
Max of 40
The normal here is 1 hour for every 30 hours you work
Huh
Sorry but I live in America
Paid sick leave what's that
Like people keep blaming the shootings on mental health
It needs to be worked on everywhere
But they don't
And they are supposed to make sure you don't leave in the middle of the day
And they have been there for a while
Though at my school their job is really just to look for missing students
Yes
So yes
It's like 3 months
What
Huh
And if you do there is a 99% chance you're a massive asshole
No one drives those
Yeah
From three houses
And Ferdinand von aegir
God and I remember hearing good things about the game too
I think I've heard some stuff about that game
Huh
Fame does that to people
I learned it from Yakuza 5
Yeah please don't let it beat you
Oh of course it's Tennessee
Yeah that's cool
As my family member
AND BILLY WAS THE SAME EXACT TYPE OF CANCER
Yeah I love seeing famous people dying from something that also killed one of my family members a few years back
Fuck cancer
God he was only 2 years older than me
Fuck cancer
And he was so young too
Oh fuck
Oh no someone call Nintendo
We just know that she has a twin brother
Also nothing is known about her twin brother
But her mother is very supportive
Musk is not the most supportive person when it comes to that
Because you know
Yeah the change of last name made perfect sense
Vivian Jenna Wilson
I mean good for her
Hey at least she changed her name and cut ties with him
Including one trans daughter that wants nothing to do with him
Yeah he actually has 7
like 19
Oh right the stadia exists
So you are saying it can play doom
Oof
do they just have that on some kind of hotkey
Oh wow
Like the hundredth
Unfortunately the damage has already been done
How is that legal
And it's the 4 Largest publishers in the world
what kind of asshole would sue the freaking internet archive
Just wow
Wow it's that bad
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
ok that's funny
yay so now the least tainted engine is unreal
So many buzzwords
Unity announced that they are merging with  ironsource
also drink a lot of water
You just can only eat like yogurt for a few days
it gets better
yeah covid sucks
Then I'd have to block you
at least it wasn't Dr pepper
HERESY
Heresy
Yeah it was cherry lime gatorlyte
It said cherry
Hey I didn't know it tasted like that
That is Also the time I tried the most disgusting tasting Gatorade ever
I had that when I had covid
Oh god yeah that sucks
people are blaming sesame street when it has nothing to do with them
Misguided hate
Twitch and YouTube are blocked
yeah they definitely do now
Ok what
Good for you das
This man doesn't have a brain
Pretty sus
That sucks
Oh wow
peak capitalism is letting children starve
oh hey it auto played a video about the Israel-Palestine conflict
Oh my god
Well shit
Yeah bikes are way better
The bikes are used way more
I haven't even seen the escooters in DC even get used much
Oh they are definitely not good
Bikes
That sounds like they were made to force you to constantly use them
Because they would be great If everyone wasn't so against using them
you mean like public transportation
FUCKING AUTO CORRECT
But cars bad
and from my experience those things break pretty easily
I just realized I never actually learned how to ride a bike
Like at all
No it's caring about people that's woke
Well it is
It's definitely a good thing
Ok then
Like seriously most influencers are not good people
Yes
Probably
Like at all
It would help if dems actually did anything
Mental health doesn't mean shit to anyone
Welcome to the USA
They don't care if anyone kills themselves
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffals#
Actually I'll just Link her Wikipedia
So yeah a pretty good target for transphobes
Oh apparently they are an activist
Wow this is really fucked up
https://youtu.be/u3oSy2vJj3I
140.17
Yep
Everything feels off
it doesn't even match my phone anymore
Discord android looked completely different yesterday
IT CUTS OFF MOST OF MY MESSAGES
It's mostly android that changed
All of the emotes in my frequently used I haven't used
Discord make good decisions challenge
The guy that runs it got tired of the republicans' shit
Fun
So I never want to live in Texas
OF COURSE IT IS
IT'S IN FUCKING TEXAS
Oh great no injuries
I LOVE THIS COUNTRY
That is usually how that works
money
https://twitter.com/Oceaniz96/status/1572330006143016962?t=DHQveILoDFy68y8Rkj6TtQ&s=19
Anti union shit
That would be getting a girlfriend
They are on this server so there's a 90% chance they are
Nothing says trans rights like bombing a hospital
These guys are encouraging terrorism
I'm sorry WHAT
Work some more
Tired of work
It's fine they will get kicked out by the next coup in a few years
Oh yeah that
Because usb c is the norm
Phone I think
Why would they only modify the phone for the EU and keep it the same everywhere else
OH ITS THE UK
What
To someone from the same union
This isn't that
So they are supposed to pay the usual rate for the union
She's part of a union
Well
Hellena is in the same union as her
You give him a song about how he would do literally anything for the greater good and then make him a fascist
But apparently rooster teeth forgot that
He's supposed to be morally grey
Like why
They literally brought back a fan favorite character just to kill them off in the next volume
Used to be a RWBY fan so
Like I didn't already know that
Wow rooster teeth sucks
That's Twitter
Everything is on fire always
Shouldn't the solution be to acknowledge it's an issue and try to fix it
What the fuck
/s
Huh
Also said trans daughter apparently has a twin brother
He's just a general asshole
If musk was my dad I also would want nothing to do with him
I mean
A drunk asshole that causes way too many problems
But he isn't now
Yeah he's formerly a republican
Wikipedia says they're a democrat
Um
Not even the AI can draw Hands
Art with really fucked up hands
You can't escape the guillotine
Dental is important and yet it's incredibly pricey
Well I think I remember hearing that it will be capped at like 35 month next year
SO WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE
It barely costs anything to make
Insulin prices are  criminal
What the hell
And if it is it's been like that for a while
It's definitely not dying
Land of the free everyone
Hey at least it's not Texas this time
https://twitter.com/AP/status/1594283286620246016?t=KmL84IzIs5p5OnGMSs-ZvQ&s=19
YEARLY
Boy can't wait to have to hack my car so I can go faster then 40MPH
Man was hated by everyone
Man was only there for 2 years
I was more worried about my grandma because her home is basically empty now
Yep
It was probably because they didn't want to focus on the fact that he's dead and more that he did stuff when he was alive or something
Yeah it confused me at first
Oh no that means he was already dead
It will probably end up all hitting you at once eventually and you will start bawling like a baby
Yeah the exact same thing happened to me
Damn
We were at his celebration of life like a week ago
I recently lost a grandparent so I know how you feel
Oh that's terrible
It's actually called your actions having consequences
It doesn't exist
New law don't be a asshole
Keyword is used to
What the fuck is a sears
Great
Very much
Yeah
Fucking walk because we can't take you anywhere
Yeah we went past him just being bipolar a long time ago
what
Unless you have nitro
Discord has a limit of 2000 I think
4000 is a bit much
Somehow misspells every word
Writes entire essay
Cool unfortunately
wait shit they would do that
Pay us and you get more
Yes
Then OOOPS WE 40K NOW
Seriously one second you are living your life in modern times in that
And very quickly gets side tracked
Because that's hilarious
I think the only ai related thing I like is ai dungeon
Well now everyone can see how bad ai is at shit
I thought they only started doing that like yesterday
That definitely shouldn't work that fast
What am I looking at
That's exactly what it is
Musk is just gonna kneel over and die someday
We programmed it to target children as a joke
With those things I half expect it to just fall apart the moment you turn it on
Damn thing's made out of paper mache
Seriously the man can't even make a decent car
Guess that now means he has to die
What the fuck
I thought it only sends you notifications about stuff you are following
Wait it does that
I don't know I kinda like the image of him being humiliated
Oh wait Hollywood
Why would you
Yeah they're old
The dog is 17 so
OH NO
https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1608462274590838787?t=LrC8AW2JanqjJ6gZ81GmTA&s=19
Why am I not surprised
She's getting money from it no matter what
Doesn't matter
oh shit the cops
Man literally said IM NOT OWNED IM NOT OWNED
And he got himself arrested because of fucking pizza boxes
That's it
He's an ass
Man doxxed himself using a pizza box
HA
WB killed and replaced her so they could make more money
Again I'm pretty sure she was replaced
WHY WOULD SOMEONE FUCK THAT
What
The real JKR died in 2007 and she was actually replaced by some kinda super TERF
JKR stopped existing after 2007
Is anything even real anymore
Interesting
Yeah that checks out
Wait it's Georgia
How is she a member of Congress
And actually said something about a Jewish space laser
Wait she actually exists
The game is actually pretty good
Weird thing is
https://youtu.be/KkIN74s1kMw
Why is that OH NO
Just the ones that get elected
Because they haven't shown that they see them as human
No they do
The self correcting would be all these people getting cancer
No it's definitely what they intended
And I think I read somewhere that it starts getting more dangerous starting at 25
It's really stupid
Less then one percent of people who actually transition
That's like
It's mid to late 20s that it stops
Yes
Just mute the channel and get done with it
Which is fine
Funny thing is they are actually banned from tiktok
Yeah that makes no sense
Welcome to politics
Oh damnit my discord is now randomly jumping around whenever I change tabs
From the people who get money just for existing
Something something bootstraps
Well you see
Where do you think the ai learned it from
Then they are at fault but only in that situation
Make all roads one way
Then the person walking is at fault
Remove all sidewalks
Nah
Yes
Though they probably should put some kinda barrier so this doesn't happen
Yeah that's like Triple illegal
It already is
Ok but
What
Also this is like the fifth time someone brought this up
So I'll just say something stupid
Because this entire thing is stupid
Ok but she's specifically talking about his music so
Ok how did the west go so hard with propaganda that they make this seem like a bad thing
How the hell
Oh right all their problems weren't because of communism it was usually something far worse
Which never worked because of many different reasons each time
I don't care
If that makes me a communist according to people then so be it
I just don't want people to die
it's idiotic
Unfortunately in the us being slightly farther left then liberal makes you a filthy commie
It backfired terribly for them
So
No one in the buildings
And again
What the fuck Is happening in Brazil
That's capitalism
They are all incredibly flawed
That's all systems of government
And
Eh
Welp
This is never going to end is it
Because
I mean their problems are horrendous human rights issues but that seems to be everywhere
At all
It isn't
I thought that was supposed to be getting better
Yeah we should ban cops
Fucking musk
That was like his entire thing
Oh wait
That definitely didn't happen because its idiotic
There was a time where I couldn't go a day without finding something bad about china showing up on my Twitter feed
Definitely
Yeah
Which
Literally nothing
That article is
Also isn't that just suspicions of it giving your info to the Chinese government mostly
I'm fine with less TikTok
Yeah this thing isn't gonna be street legal
This can go wrong for both sides in so many ways
Oh god
Why
What
That requires the west to actually acknowledge it's past actions
Why am I not surprised
Still bad
But yeah
The official story is he left it with a friend
Ok guess I'll continue playing pathfinder
Yeah that's true
Do it cowards
How the fuck
https://twitter.com/PerfectCutPoop/status/1620145021487030272?t=nlPLBUEE0CoQr7B7-QU8UQ&s=19
Auto fire makes the game play itself basically
Elon Haven't you been calling it the platform of free speech since you bought it
What does that even mean
It was pretty obvious for a while that it doesn't matter which side you pick you can't win
Honestly I think the people who care have probably just left this entire thing behind a long time ago
But yeah it's good
Brain hurts
Too many big words
Yeah
Yeah I'm surprised I did it first
It was such an obvious joke
Oh so even the VAs for genshin like children
WHERE
Well everything bad is gonna be deleted from the archive
It's very obviously not that big a deal
Yeah
They can just not
That doesn't mean you have to stream it
The first half was alright
Compared to everything else
No it is
Especially because they seemed to really not like it during the first one
Not play it on stream
Or you know
You'd think they would stop
Yeah there's 2 more streams
Oh I thought they stopped playing it after the stream
You can't notice it unless someone pointed it out
No it was literally just slight crying
The rest of the stream just had chat in subscriber only mode
It didn't
Yeah people kept saying it ended after the clip
I mean it must have been pretty bad to make them put chat on subscriber only mode
It's sad they got caught up in this
Honestly from what I've watched I'm pretty sure they genuinely thought donating to the Trevor project would equal it out
Though it was weird that it was basically just you lost a subscriber over and over again
I know that's a fact because I was watching it
They were harassed
That's the best way to describe it
SJW
Now it just feels old
Okay please just stop it
These are people who genuinely thought donating to something pro LGBT would balance it out
That's it
Like they had a big wave of it once before
They just aren't used to criticism
And they are better RPGs
The GB games do play better
Then it's not a good one
It's one hell of a thing
Nostalgia blindness
The worst thing they had to deal with was people going after them because they didn't like TLOU2
All of that
That
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
This is extremely out of character
They are usually super wholesome
honestly I don't know
So no
Denuvo
I WATCHED THE DAMN THING 4 TIMES I REALLY CAN'T HEAR IT
Many racial slurs
Oh god I would instantly get banned
How would I react if someone did the same to something I love
I just realized if that's how I react to people saying bad things about something I slightly like
Why is that treated like some boogyman
Hey at least someone didn't mention gamergate so that's a plus
Yes
At all
Honestly I don't really know because I wasn't watching chat
Oh it was pretty much just spamming I think
Or something
I'm pretty sure everything bad gets deleted from the archive
I think
They don't really do that after they stop for it to install
So that's weird
Also the stream audio is still playing even though I closed it a while ago
I'm just mildly annoyed
Why would I
You literally said the same thing like 6 times
OK PLEASE STOP
Everything
Oh no everything that is donated to them during the streams goes to charity
Then don't
Because that's definitely what it looks like at first
Honestly thought it was just a generic horn
Damn thing was used to annoy the shit out of people
God the text is hilarious though
Impossible
Actibliz not throw literally everything they have at the COD mines challenge
Also a limit break
Interesting that everyone has 2 path actions now
The demo makes it look promising
And that's just because I liked the first one and love the bravely default series
Octopath 2 looks interesting and that's about it
They need to sell it to the edgy teenage boys
So dragon quest
I mostly just look for anything from them I think is interesting
Square just makes whatever then says it undersells when it doesn't sell like 30 million copies
already on it
Good
There was also a sequel series
Xana in one episode tried to make a nuclear reactor meltdown
People hated the epilogue
Not many people did
And I don't like the ending of the manga
And it has the same ending as the manga
Knights of sidonia s3 is the movie
The movie
Oh cool I just started watching Edens zero
That's a name I haven't heard in a while
That is exactly what it is
Yep
looks cool
Oh hell no
Yeah this looks like it will be really good
There is something wrong here I can feel it
But sym bionic Titan and definitely megas xlr deserved better
So did generator rex
So still better than the actual series
Yeah this looks like it's either going to be really good or really bad
Definitely something
But Blake is
Like all the designs are good
Also why does Blake have cat mittens
Yo that yang design is pretty good
Impossible
What good comedy in RWBY?
Now let's hope it's good
His show is now an anime
God Monty is probably smiling there in heaven
Oh god I looked up the ending and WHAT
I'm sorry WHAT
Also timeline shenanigans
Also that one ending doesn't count because it is supposed to be a good ending for Vincent and Catherine
Where her identity was used for a cruel gag
Also to be honest they treated Erica pretty well until the end
Yeah that's about it
Catherine was a great puzzle game
How dare you
We have enough problems
Please don't jinx it
I swear to God when persona 6 comes out the series is going to have another explosion of new fans
So yeah
Pre persona 5
Also was a persona fan
Good thing is the entire series is now on ps4,steam,switch,and at least the first game is on Xbox one
Which really didn't help
So everyone mostly had just watched playthroughs
Well at the time no one had played the game because it was on the vita
Somewhat
At least it's gotten better
Myself included
Also most of those people were definitely too young
So I was that kind of fan
Hell I didn't even play the games until a few months ago
Because I was a part of it
Oh I've encountered the Danganronpa fanbase when it was at it's height
other reasons
Though undertale is also bad for
And most things that get too popular for their own good
Like with undertale
Sorry just saw inescapable fanbase and thought popular
So you're saying you won't watch something If it's too popular
But yeah they are annoying
Bro I just ignore the fanbase
Yes steins;Gate very good
But then I remembered Mayuri exists
I was going to say okabe is the best part
But strawberry is better
Oh nice cherry is good
If I do remember correctly you are supposed to play/watch steins gate 0 either right before or after the finale
Mostly because I played the VN first
I like the op of the VN more then the one in the anime
Yeah they are good
Oh god do you like suffering
I think this man is cursed
oh god now I feel old
Good
Though I was like what 12
I used to like Mr enter
Because reasons
Well see we need a main villain
Also yes it would have been better without frill
Yeah wonder egg was interesting
Also what special episode
I liked wonder egg
Ok but we all used to be that person
Fans
god damnit
It didn't did it
Oh I see some things stay the same
Yeah fair enough
Looks generic
Yeah they do
Hey at least the author of fairy tale does more than that
Would like to find the person who decided making the blood white was a good idea
Pretty sure the blood is still white
no
Read the manga
Yeah now it's just
Seriously that seems like something that you shouldn't move to A FREAKING SLIDE SHOW
|| oh hey by the way she met god||
Literally just a picture
Seriously how do you butcher a series that badly
OH GOD
Yeah that showed why you should wait until you have a significant amount of content to go off of
I mean I can't complain
Wow this guy has a serious obsession with tits
Looking at all the characters and
Who's only real loses are against the main character
Oh yes the kallen look alike
Yeah it's especially weird when they frequently tell you how good she is
Looking at you plastic memories
One that tries to force a reaction from the viewers
Oh the worst kind of show
So you talking about forced drama or action
What is that
Yeah I really can't argue with that
ASS
Yeah but Geass is a classic so I can't associate it with the trash that I know of in the genre
It's probably because it's just not the genre for you
No I'm the same
Hey I don't read stuff made for edgy teens
Rip
Oh I guess it can
Yeah that's really all I know
Um I guess redo of healer
No seriously why would someone want that
You want a good revenge fantasy
So read the manga got it
Yeah probably
Also doesn't that just mean it's average
Izana deserved better
a clone
A FREAKING CLONE
And then make him end up with a clone of his first love
Or the series itself can very heavily ship them
Because the canon couple has a good chance to make you mad then
Though I guess that's inevitable when you basically say all their ships are wrong
Myself included
Still remember that the ending pissed off so many people
Knights of sidonia is decent
Like early 2010s.
So the 2010s
Seriously I keep forgetting that Otomedius exists
Because reasons
And there is the one where the ships are anime girls
I think gradius also has some insane lore
Oh yeah I know all old school shmups have insane lore
Because reasons
Oh wow someone mentioned R-TYPE
That's a technicality
And you just threw it away to just have another teenage protagonist
You had the perfect reason to be different
Sorry what
You don't mind that right
Well you see we somehow didn't age your clone up all the way
Women that aren't washboards being one of them
Japanese people want the things they can't have
Hell Both of them have green as one of their main colors
I can definitely see it
Yeah
But in all seriousness
They even both have large breasts
Yes I caught that
Mostly because the OP is a man with a mission song
The first being iron blooded orphans
Like the 4th mecha I've watched
Ok now that's something I watched
I remember hearing about that
Oh yeah cross Ange
FOOD
Also said space alien looks like a dick most of the time
So he ended up marrying and having a child with WHAT IS BASICALLY A CHILD
And is basically a child
Oh yeah and said clone acts like a child
Oh god it's worse the ending of knights of sidonia pissed off ALL OF THE SHIPPERS
It's been an eternity and he is back
WHAT
YEAH
7DS flashbacks
Did no one think this through
Mostly because I seem to find the weirdest shit
I think I remember reading this at some point
WHAT
And they made a masterpiece
What are you talking about terrible people being terrible is the joke
Torture
Hey its good for one thing
Yep it's legit

now CONSUME OUR CONTENT
See they can do some good
Well that's cool of them
https://twitter.com/michelle_tan101/status/1536041460356767745?t=rjNfGg_e-xLqRisiH45JQw&s=09
Perfect
Yeah it definitely would
Well I last watched the series years ago so I should be fine
Yeah that's sounds right
It's the aniplex YouTube channel
YEP ITS MADOKA
no
I remember reading it
OH NICE
Mood
Also the reason this happened is because it's the 15th anniversary of the first episode of the anime
God that meme's old
https://twitter.com/NoisyPixelNews/status/1544092218633371649?t=8GrjkFBT6MNqYE1VQcj1wA&s=19
NOOOOOO
https://twitter.com/G0ffThew/status/1546204483905982464?t=sCsTx_LOr2GOhrhwL73vlg&s=19
So it can fool a couple suckers
That's why it exists
that's just fem kirito
The baby
And said train hit a flaming dumpster
oh no
Also that it exists
Now I remember that I really liked chivalry of a failed knight

And like 50 copies of love Hina because of course
Said dumpster is also filled with many other trashy manga
Also yeah it's very much a dumpster fire
I just realized this entire situation could probably be solved with a single conversation
What are you doing stepbro
https://youtu.be/SaKdpMnwZf0
The best thing about domestic girlfriend is the opening
Sorry you can't write manga and touch grass
no
interesting
yeah it's um
Natsuo Fujii is hopelessly in love with his teacher, Hina. Trying to move on, he agrees to a mixer. There he meets an odd girl, Rui Tachibana, who invites him to sneak out. She takes him to her house and asks him to have sex with her. Natsuo, frustrated that his love will not bear fruit anyway, loses his virginity to her. The next day, Natsuo's dad tells him that he wants to remarry and his prospective partner is coming to their house that evening. When the door opens, it turns out that Rui is Hina's younger sister and both are daughters of the woman his father wants to marry, Tsukiko Tachibana.
Here's the Wikipedia synopsis
nothing
The name says it all
Like with something like domestic girlfriend
Yeah you kinda know what you are getting into
Sis you are on a symphogear server
Most of the couples in trails are cute
most het is cringe
I FORGOT THIS EXISTS
OH SHIT
https://twitter.com/rawtoonintros/status/1551549074259824640?t=zPDwp0GSFr1sTFyMFS46FQ&s=19
Cool opening for an anime that doesn't exist
https://twitter.com/rawanimeops/status/1551639883189477378?t=7BF8rgdKI2NFhkZuNvBM7Q&s=19

Yep
Ok so it only works if you use the link in the tweet
It was there in the tweet
https://pilotmanga.com/series/clock-striker/?s=09
Oh cool you can preview the first chapter
yeah why is the actual premise not first
My gun
No
Bringing a whole new meaning to rearming
Welp
oh there goes another arm
I mean a bean magnum sounds interesting
Bean
yeah that sounds right
Oh there you go
Yeah same thing just can't put my finger on it
Though it does give you a reason to fight a Gundam with a zaku II
It doesn't do shit in the game
And battle alliance tells you to not use beam weapons against anything with them
nanolaminate armor sounds weird when I think about it
So um they kneel over and die of a random disease
Unfortunately the opponent has the writer on their side
Well see they may be some Uber strong god
But god wants the weak one to win
Well they may be strong
Like most of the weakest characters can beat the strongest characters if the author gave them enough plot armor
Well powerscaling is idiotic anyways
Oh wait that's all the mobile suits
Um it looks cool
Except for the story then we do need you to think a tiny bit
Don't think too much about it
Half of this stuff sounds like it would not be written into the show by a sane person
Though the only thing I remember about it is the OP
Oh hey I remember xam'd
Groove coaster also has eternal blaze
And how I've played it like 5 times
I mentioned how it's in groove coaster
I did
at least that's what Funimation says
I've watched up to episode 2 I think
OK THEN
I found out about aquarion because the OP is in groove coaster
I think you can legally watch it on Funimation
and I will also probably need headphones
I should actually watch that
That show is full of great looking mechs
Of course it's an aquarion
Nice
Oh cool a non humanoid mech
They look cool
It's still really good
Though it's a cover

Well 1 it is really good
https://twitter.com/Geo_AW/status/1556307684839809024?t=EoKcSx2R2rPe9Htm1JJG1Q&s=19
I mean she's so useless she birthed an uhciha that needs glasses
But still I saw most of the story
mostly because of cyberconnect
That's why I kinda just gave up on watching it and just played the ultimate ninja storm games
Yeah it is
Oh wow
why
Yep they seriously did that
People are already joking about it
Yep Rent a girlfriend is still a dumpster fire

Whip swords are always cool
2003
Code lyoko looks good for um
Yep
all this for a tax write off
AND INFINITY TRAIN
what's even happening
ITS LEAVING HBO MAX
OH YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME
What now
https://twitter.com/FlorkOfCows/status/1559964369403854848?t=kXYpP17krVMETQoGcyvtAw&s=19

https://twitter.com/NerdySasquatch/status/1560074569507119104?t=G0cTYfIeZW3CCv9JfOESpA&s=19

https://twitter.com/Prism_system/status/1560322423026642944?t=SITjOQ-gCJXalP1hxWmmJA&s=19

https://twitter.com/toonsgowild/status/1560377585342861312?t=9_1_JoTodFN9H4IoTFGyJQ&s=19
That's bad apparently
Yeah our show attracted people outside the target audience
And that's bad how
Disney doesn't like the gays
Because future was definitely a thing
They definitely wanted and probably needed more episodes
No even Steven universe got shafted
https://twitter.com/peridoxpig/status/1560333587936845831?t=dog7XYttoOqcawvp6kIntQ&s=19
https://twitter.com/Saberspark/status/1560706465131859968?t=ctIQBzRyBD7bWk4TK9hDLQ&s=19
Like everything else on the network that isn't teen titans GO
And then that got prematurely canned
well see david zaslav really wants that tax write off
Yeah that is definitely the point
Good opening

Yeah
But only the one
At least one of them makes sense
you can't watch initial D without the eurobeat
NOPE
Like is it in so bad it's good territory or is it just bad
sounds like something someone would watch for fun
https://twitter.com/toonsgowild/status/1560773817655517184?t=jMSJS2Y_WAh1JPyaC834Gg&s=19
I have to share this because SAO was kinda the first anime I actually watched
https://twitter.com/rawanimeed/status/1561054420871299072?t=8opPJxwLoQZs5qzyfSYqYQ&s=19
Oh god
Oh
https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1561150986906910720?t=neVeqM1DCBYB6qcPeyR5ag&s=19
I do know that the game it was supposed to tie into hasn't even released yet
Yeah I don't remember anything about ares
And ares
And other anime shit
Though that has people lighting the ball on fire
If it's inuzuma eleven yes
Oh cool
Oh I know
Oh wait billiam did a video on it a couple years back
Shit I thought I was the only one that remembers this show exists
https://twitter.com/Cure_fuwa1/status/1561431493070700545?t=rG6DNsZss4w0NCG2q8tLAw&s=19

https://twitter.com/CNschedules/status/1561790483411750912?t=-vqmvWvnq9xGLy0aOyNjaw&s=19
And the higher ups didn't like that
Oh god I just remembered the reason infinity train didn't get a season 5 is because they wanted the main character of it to be an adult
https://youtu.be/3uWpioVDXzI
Nah
Cat
https://twitter.com/G0ffThew/status/1562156205170049025?t=rxhdnfeNl0ZRV9QLGrJSpQ&s=19
Because apparently like half of this server is watching this
https://youtu.be/lx8l-KHnvkQ
For someone that is really important  they don't get paid much
Why does it make it sound like they have an obsession with her butt
Fran's butt
This sounds like most of this makes about as much sense in context
That sounds terrible
https://twitter.com/DrCullenPHD/status/1564620809435480076?t=_XoOK9FRJoAfzkrvOKRhIA&s=19
https://twitter.com/DrCullenPHD/status/1564606612517568522?t=qnrTqlpe9k-XJpMdDdiSaA&s=19
Then no
Does the remake count
Yeah I think they did
Apart from how goddamn long they are
Seriously none of the VNs got localized and it's kinda weird that they didn't
localization what's that
oh and read the VN whenever you got time and found a way to read it
The answer is just do whatever you want
ok what
Because there is no good answer if you don't have lots of time to burn
Unlimited blade works or zero is usually the answer
Oh wait that's the point
Though I don't remember anything from it or last encore
Apocrypha isn't that bad

Pretty
Excluding link
Ive played like all the games
I should really actually watch .hack sign
Canon doesn't exist
And then yeah
.Hack did for a bit
I can't even think of something that actually did multimedia good
wtf
Multimedia franchises usually end up as messes
Yeah sounds right
Why do people keep doing this
She is not
Yeah the only thing I really remember about sign is everyone thinks tsukasa is trans
But hey we got obsession as the main boss theme for the .hack sign portion of the game
It's weird
Because part of that game is just going through the plot of the previous stories
Probably less
I think link did the plot of sign in like 6 hours including gameplay
and The emails crash the game
Most of the game is still in Japanese
And well
Because I didn't even find out about the fan translation until recently
OK THEN
This is so damn cute
Oh look the only good thing that came out of last encore
https://mobile.twitter.com/GameAnimeMusic/status/1567966449318100996?t=b5wg5eTaxLKNM058f07gvA&s=19
Tomo Chan is great actually
Oh yeah that's good
why
Oh wait yeah now I remember
Wait there's movies
Mew
Yes
Huh
Oh
Hey there must be a reason why she's the leader
It's just only used during fights
Hey ruby has one
Um
The braincell currently belongs to
Yeah
Among other things
And then the movies happened and they got all the resources
OH NO
Oh no
It kinda makes me want to
Another hit from trigger
WHY
WHAT
https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1571327373710073857?t=Yqq5hbUMTHY-avAKlRLPMQ&s=19
I need to watch edgerunners
That reminds me
Ok I looked through all the cyberpunk slang and yeah it's terrible
So up to episode 2
Edgerunners is really good from what I've seen
Cyberpunk aesthetic good
Very interesting
Sounds interesting
Oh wait a lot of people here are actually like that
Trash
Mmmm
Figure it out yourself and you are most likely wrong anyways

That's a lot of jam
Yeah I don't like it either
Because the main party in konosuba is all supposed to be weird and also assholes
And actually don't actively help the traders whenever you can
Only do it once
If you need to do something that bad then at least you know
Looks at shield hero
And why do the ones with slavery being important in them getting animes
And why is it usually because they got hit by this one truck every time
Why are all these teens dying
Yep
We need the money so we can underpay our employees
Wait no don't pirate them
Wait what are you doing
We are holding your favorite anime hostage
Pay for our freaking sub
You can't do shit
Because I do remember that unless you have a subscription
Wait what is even on Crunchyroll
Oh no now I can't
That was fast
And fall off a cliff
Instead they get right back up
The truck doesn't kill them
Plot twist
Embarrassing sure but that's the point
They literally just fall down the stairs
Yeah
Oh wait
How dare you
Make them die of a heart attack
Welcome to anime
Because they willingly did that it's fine
Also basically everyone in his party is his slave
Yeah he gives the trader money as a thank you later I think
HE KEEPS COMING BACK
Here's the problem
Well they tried to make it make sense in shield hero
It looks better then all the other trash but it's still trash
Shield hero is just a piece of trash that someone polished
Like A LOT
Just there's a lot of trash
There are some gems hidden amongst the trash
Seriously why
the main relationship feels kinda abusive sometimes but it's good
It's good
No seriously by definition it's an Isekai
Inuyasha is an Isekai
Now it's mostly stuff from before the boom but still
How dare you some Isekai is good
Yeah it's definitely a lore thing
Freaking Lego star wars the complete saga and Lego Batman on DS
Yeah same
https://twitter.com/thecartooncrave/status/1576324028414902273?t=7QGLugXb4L7LZRQASodTbQ&s=19

Oh wait I forgot I watched like half of IBO
Turns out the only thing Gundam needed to get me to watch was gay

https://twitter.com/DrCullenPHD/status/1576779229835841536?t=j_u5DG_wcALRixjEnGoakA&s=19
There is definitely nothing going on in that head
Oh shit what did I just do
Oh yeah that scene
Wait a direct just for the movie
Zero brain cells
And kid me didn't understand shit
Last time I watched it was when it was still airing
Apparently it's really good
I should watch mystery inc again
Still doesn't stop me from feeling weird about it for a bit
Yeah it's absolutely fine
Apparently word of god Said live action movie Velma is gay
Though she is only a lesbian in like 3 universes I think
I think
She dated shaggy for a bit in that show but she broke up with him after she realized she didn't like him like that
Mystery inc also made her a lesbian
Why can she only like girls or guys
Why can't she be bi
That's all people keep repeating
Different universe
Don't know how I feel about this
Huh
https://twitter.com/KlPASH3R/status/1577097678843875328?t=t0KYa1SNvCKpLTIgZnG-OQ&s=19
Now the fact that someone made this is a war crime
I've seen this so many times that I know it's fake before I even look at it
Fan art
Now to wait to see how the characters sound
I want to punch his stupid pink haired face
Yep
Yeah she's just like me
It's gonna be fun seeing her break
Yeah she literally didn't get any more intelligent
Nope she's now a teen
||baby's first war crime||
Now time for a complete tone shift
Ma'am I already have none
And now she got a girlfriend
Just did
She didn't think
he deserves it
Though on the other hand
Yo calm down you are just supposed to hit the antenna
KILL
Your opinion is immediately invalid
Sir you have pink hair and a terrible haircut
T O M A T O
I only really watched IBO
Yeah I got nothing
Fine then um
Yeah and I remember what I saw of singular point was really good
Oh yeah I should really finish that some day
Good
God I forget both loid and yor almost killed a man for making anya cry
Some spy x family clips showed up in my recommended
Yeah understandable
What
The first location that shows up in it doesn't even have it's events happen until after the first arc
Leave it to KH to make its event viewer confusing
Not chronological order
Seriously the events are arranged by location
I was gonna say the kingdom hearts mobile game but it did it really weirdly
Well I guess it's different
I remember only one thing doing that
That's awesome
https://twitter.com/AlmirVela/status/1578969351721750529?t=MLUAWgFgbbrmAF3eES8KHQ&s=19

Oh hey everyone's dead

database is goat
The answer is literally just whatever the studio says is one
Yeah that does make it a massive target
How long until everything goes to shit and people start dying
The gay is fine but it's still gundam
How bout both
It's over
Oh wow
Ok
Oh god I forgot that

The one they got rid of ultimate spider man for
Oh god
Fuckin Mucha lucha
But no let's kill one of the most important people in the original story because reasons
You literally already had all you need
How the hell do you screw up something that badly
Remember in the comics Spider-Man isn't allowed to be happy

Also that opening
It was doomed from the start
But it was on nicktoons
Oh yeah it was great
Oh god
So an incredibly stupid reason
They cancelled it because the series did not fit in with its other programming.
Which is weird because it apparently had pretty high ratings
The MTV series right
Oh yeah he did
Aka don't lose your way
Before my body is dry
the one song everyone knows from him
Promare is great
Yeah and I love it more because of it
The entire soundtrack of Xenoblade x
So is a lot of attack on Titan
Kill la kill is him
He makes great music period
I mean only really one girl has really had anything close to a romantic relationship with him
Yes
Doesn't matter because more blue exorcist
Wait what
At least a good number
Probably
Aren't like 2 of those costumes in Spiderman PS4
Oh damn it is
She's just like me Fr

I mean
https://twitter.com/legendgaylol/status/1606469245939982336?t=ndqIMcDC2YVG9rMRPXqH8g&s=19
If I knew someone who would immediately floor anyone who makes me cry I would also hide behind them
Yeah
It's good
I want to see them seething
No it should
The game is way better
It's ok
Yeah I think that's the usual reaction
Oh god
What do you
The god eater anime was Decent
Yeah noragami S3 sounds good
I do now
Cool
Huh someone knows destiny unchain exists
I'm pretty sure the manga wasn't like this at all
What the hell
Now I feel dirty for watching that
But why
I mean I think I know
Why
No
Anything past middle school is
It is excusable if they are kids
But yeah it's not great
Mostly because it was the first one of it's type I've seen
I liked uzaki
Because kids do that
Yeah it makes a lot of sense if they are actual children
Well too bad
Hey kids you want to know about maps
Yes
Because everything else is western animation
Guess the better term would be eastern animation
I'm pretty sure anime is just used as a term for any animation from Asia
Oh god I forgot bungo stray dogs is back
Watching That op means you are on a list somewhere
Right?
It can't be that bad
Gears of destiny straight up just has wild arms characters in all but name
Oh yeah the fighting games
Then watch it again so I could try to understand it
I should finish ergo proxy
Speaking of 2000s anime
Hey kids you want to watch other kids who have ruined their lives
https://youtu.be/9jrKwkYjhCE
It is
Freaking ranma 1/2
The hacking minigame is fun
Also how the hell did they show it on a children's network
Prime was good
Interesting
Perish
Ok then
No
Listen to Me
Sounds fun
Ridiculously cynical
That sounds
Shaggy is supposed to be the bumbling idiot
WHO THOUGHT THIS DESIGN WAS A GOOD IDEA
https://twitter.com/krembeni/status/1612308147246632961?t=eIxP1J7qKB5dFuGoh7bUWw&s=19
He's just reading
Also a stoner but that's not important
An experience
It's
Every woman bond ends up with dies
She would end up protecting me
I'd say must protect but she's fine
Cinnamon roll
Vivid strike is worth it just because you get to see some little shits get obliterated
They are now girlfriends
They went to the aquarium
I'm kidding I know
How gay
Ok but there was also a movie after that
Fred knew that if he didn't keep shaggy from the girls they would immediately fall for him
Meanwhile shaggy
I find it funny that Fred is always trying to get one girl
He's always being chased so
I mean
Traditional masculinity

https://twitter.com/shagLSSJ/status/1613260780337778693?t=eyG2cWVz_GgsV8wB-6uIiQ&s=19
The man got an alien to fall for him
Still didn't stop him from getting all the bitches
Yeah
They turned shaggy into a beta male
You should know better
Hey that's your fault for looking at comments
Apparently everyone else did
Too bad
BITCH YOU ARE MAKING A CARTOON FOR ADULTS
Ha adults that watch cartoons bad
Because it isn't funny
What even is the joke
Oh my god
Adult animation that doesn't hate the people it's supposed to be made for
It's already gotten enough attention that they are probably gonna make 3 more seasons
Kinda too late for that
Fred the lover of traps
That too
Because no one wants to out themselves
We are all degenerates for knowing what oreimo is
Yeah but oreimo
Oh
They baited everyone it's actually gonna be super wholesome
They made it worse actually
Or popular enough to get 6 seasons
Yeah
Considering big mouth is popular
YOU GOT RID OF EVERYTHING ELSE
OF COURSE IT IS
https://twitter.com/thecartoonnews/status/1614006032841297940?t=dJNfD_4KXIta7E6wvQAgPA&s=19
That's it
RWBY is popular
They were being very friendly with her and she calls them a slur
Oh my god she does
No one would be stupid enough to
Then you don't need to get mad at the show that's made to make people angry
Watch something good
Teenagers
Love thy neighbor
Woke isn't a word anymore
Yeah they are literally doing that
So
They have an Indian
I mean
Brought to you by the SMG4 guys
https://twitter.com/glitch_prod/status/1614183397135638530?t=9bkxsvrSCctNAgVHuNvWRA&s=19
Big mouth
that makes it worse
STOP SPLITTING SEASONS IN 2 AND CALLING THEM SEPARATE SEASONS
WHY DOES NETFLIX DO THAT
Which
Well considering they split it in 2
https://twitter.com/AL_theBoi/status/1614279219244056576?t=wNdZ6HGy8gELV4e8Ok-1Xg&s=19
Honestly I might watch that
Which has already been confirmed by the way
And season 2
It's probably gonna slow down quite a bit after the first week
https://youtu.be/4bkQBOgaFAc
Ok but consider
Yes I immediately went to the time Scooby doo went up against actual zombies and the threat of actual death
Instead let's watch Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island
Exactly
Just forget it exists
It doesn't deserve the attention
We should stop talking about it
You know what
Yeah
Gay, trans, black you know what
Unless they are
The less you acknowledge it the stronger it gets
Yes
Shaggy
Action girl Daphne
Dead fred
Smart Scooby
Let's see
We got
OH GOD HE'S JACKED
Scrappy went from a total joke to
Fuck it Fred is a super zombie now
It worked surprisingly well
Also that weird zombie apocalypse comic series
Mystery incorporated
Or hell there's already a Scooby doo series that is supposed to be more mature
It doesn't deserve any attention
Stop talking about Velma it doesn't deserve the attention
Watch what's new Scooby Doo
On the other side of the spectrum
This is seriously what people were calling the worst Scooby doo series
https://vxtwitter.com/ComicGirlAshley/status/1614756177807826944?t=4QF-pz68F9d2oDRhxGXcow&s=19
https://c.vxtwitter.com/ManOfCartoon/status/1614780961090338816?t=5QTUyiNisEry76jmWG6PgQ&s=19

GOD DAMNIT
Nice show I hope it doesn't fall off after the first season
God it's been 8 years
https://twitter.com/thecartoonnews/status/1615724682031894536?t=pSxCUQYJunrelOs_4PywHA&s=19
Nice
Promare is literally just because trigger the movie
Also rip
Galo in English is billy kametz

Man gets so mad he turns into a dragon
This year

https://c.vxtwitter.com/nescartridges/status/1617919426678124544?t=zYvJ698bOYk1LaTYcr0LGA&s=19

Unfortunately it is and it's rapidly approaching your location
God yoko shimomura is a goddess
https://youtu.be/p1Nmc84Noos
Ah yes the song I used to replace subhuman in dmc5
Oh yeah the song that only plays 5 seconds in the base game
Yes you should
Though the game calls it berserk drive/darkness trigger
Though this song is cool because it plays when you essentially activate the ignite module
https://youtu.be/N_WCXBFQUng
send help i can't stop listening to the gunvolt soundtrack
WAIT THERE'S AN ENGLISH SONG 
https://youtu.be/Am1PKQIVSOk
https://youtu.be/ux9PzgyyqnA
https://youtu.be/v66p1JS2QXs. THIS IS A  GAME ABOUT SURGERY WHY DOES THIS GO SO HARD
https://youtu.be/XJsy5jJ7Dp0
Wow 20 years
Since I mentioned this game I'm just going to leave the awesome theme. https://youtu.be/qAvcHwlxxIo
I've always thought this sounds like it belongs in  sonic or f zero
But it's ok because remind fixed that
Well guess he's the next sacrifice
WHO TOLD YOU
I REALLY LIKE GOD EATER ALRIGHT
Though if we did get a PXZ3 we might get a remix of this song https://youtu.be/v_T6CdTwAvs
It does help that they have the musical god known as Go shiina
Yes I like namco games how did you know
Though if I could name my favorite songs out of the game it would be the ones I posted,fury sparks,the god eater songs,and the ace attorney songs
Which game I'm talking about you decide
I really need to play this game again
Also https://youtu.be/SEPfALxJoY4
Because they are just that good
Oh if I wanted to I would just post the entire PXZ soundtrack
Oh but if u liked the gameplay there's always endless frontier
Oh and the other company that made PXZ  makes SRW so good luck
Yeah unfortunately monolith is kinda busy
And I have to share this because .hack https://youtu.be/lPQjJ_cqO9c
https://youtu.be/XgikEaMFJZg
https://youtu.be/OFCTBOdhuoY
I also like the versions of this song in both project X zone games
Yeah it's a good op
I'm pretty sure the final stage theme from ROR2 is a remix of this
This was always one of my favorites
https://youtu.be/ysPtBjY8o_A
I sometimes go back to ROR1 just because
Yep
Not really but I REALLY LOVE GE
No it's better
And still love the series
Also one of the main reasons I started playing god eater
And another https://youtu.be/drb1papU7lE
Yeah remember when I said go shiina is a god well here's another one of his songs https://youtu.be/oOuaiaM4lsM
Yoko shimomura is a goddess
Oh yeah I meant to post this https://youtu.be/0VRgfSGI2wo
Just the last time they did was 2015
I mean there's no reason they aren't still willing to work together
Hey if live a live can come back how about this game
https://youtu.be/P-SO2X6J83k

If I remember correctly that's the final boss theme
THERE IS A CRUSH 40 VERSION

The game may suck but hey

Oh yeah I love awesome boss themes that are actually kind of sad when you think about it
https://youtu.be/LJfFlR5CRdc
OH WAIT THAT'S ALL OF THEM
HEY LET'S REMIX ONE OF THE BEST SONGS FROM THE FIRST GAME
Yeah a good reason to just walk around
Oh god this song
And I was partially right
God I didn't think neo twewy could possibly have a better soundtrack then the original
OHHHHHH TAKE A LOOK AT MEEEEEE
https://youtu.be/VSCjWMajQnc
Ok you can't beat the original but this is still good

https://twitter.com/dailyrpgsongs/status/1552390871366107137?t=WR07tbVy3EfsFOEKtME_UA&s=19
I understand why some people don't like the rapping but I love it
WE'RE STUCK ON A DIFFERENT PLANET
https://youtu.be/ePypW6n1egQ
you can definitely hear it in some of the songs
YEP
https://twitter.com/DailyXenoblade/status/1559912727937748992?t=Q8d0Xel9ggaEymU1XmQU4w&s=19
Give my boy his own game
Actually I think the music is really the only thing from sonic 06 they ever acknowledge exists
considering he only really has one game
Yeah I know but I think it's cool that silver's theme has multiple remixes
I mean it's not like dreams of an absolution has like 3 remixes or anything
Forgot rez exists
It was in the first trailer
THIS WAS THE SONG THAT INTRODUCED EVERYONE TO THE GAME
https://youtu.be/E8pFzQ1lyF8
YOU CAN'T BEAT ME NOT WHEN I SHIFT INTO MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE
https://youtu.be/vGUaVZN2ttw
OK WHAT DID I RUN OVER THIS TIME
Yep you will hear the intro and be like
That's always a plus
Wild arms
Oh hey
https://youtu.be/ScvxT0RItYE
Thank you YouTube for reminding me That this exists
https://youtu.be/bMfvZmhqW0A
Nice
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Should probably play that someday
Oh yeah I have overdose
Just not a good Samurai warriors game
It's not a bad game
This will make it my fifth time watching it
Well shit now I want to watch promare again
Well then
Literally right when I start thinking about touhou
Perfection
Great song
OH SHIT ITS NOT BROKEN
Hey is that a broken robot in the water
https://youtu.be/xOeb7StJlRc
They made all of the soundtrack
Yep
Fuck it we MGR now
I just love viola's theme
https://youtu.be/DlDx2LjdPfc
That's actually pretty clever considering this plays throughout the entire game
Oh my god it does
Yeah the song titles kinda explain exactly what happens
https://youtu.be/0QQXkO6gTaY
This is phase 2
Oh yeah phase one of the final boss
METAL GUITAR VERSION OF CHOCOBO THEME INTENSIFIES
So everything ends up going to shit
Lightning returns exists
Unfortunately
Well he does
So he ends up going into the past though methods I kinda forgot to fix everything
He was the last living being in the world in his time
Yeah the kingdom hearts reject has a pretty sad backstory
https://youtu.be/lSwCPqiVetI
And just because it's one of my favorite songs in the game
https://youtu.be/uncwKFZflS0
Oh yeah
Love the game so I know exactly what this song is
God this song
Because it's the one ace attorney game that wasn't localized
He sees you as a random encounter
Funny thing is this song plays when you fight him in digital devil saga
Don't really know what song I would start with though
God I can't wait until theatrhythm final bar line comes out so I can again spend hundreds of hours playing final fantasy songs
Yes they are
https://youtu.be/L3eDcInFHwE
The final Fantasy X song
Well guess I'll get pissed and use more
Oh no this ice spreads whenever I use fire
Hell yeah
Actually just train sounds in general
Train whistle intensifies
Why did I just remember this exists
https://youtu.be/UrOXTADrIjw
