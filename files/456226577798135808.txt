PSA for the community: Remember that Rule 1 is one of the most principle rules here, and always use your common sense. Make sure to ask yourself, "Is what I'm about to say potentially offensive to somene, including myself?" If so, please use your better judgement, and don't say it. Likewise, if you find someone says something offensive that hasn't been acknowledged, always know the mods are here to listen and make sure its handled.

@everyone Happy new year!
Thanks for everyone that showed up! I hope you all enjoyed the cards. ❤
Game's over for now! But, I'll announce if and when we do more rounds.
@here
Your favorite Cape has been busy these last few days thinking of something symphogear related for some symphofun in the symphosun, so to symphospeak. With some editing and testing, I am proud to announce a product of the Symphogear Subreddit Discord mods: The Symphogear Themed Cards Against Humanity deck. That's right! Now you too can roast your favorite franchise and make Kings Record cry themselves to sleep with this brand new set of cards dedicated to making fun of literally everyone and everything in this wonderful show.

The play code for the deck is: ***AWD7Q***

In the face of Christmas Eve, as my own personal gift to the Symphogear community, I'll be hosting a game with this deck in Pretend you're Xyzzy. Join the following link:

Please also make sure to spread the word about this to servers you're in that are listed with discord.me that are unaware of this problem existing. Banning these bots delists the server and its users from the server temporarily, as this person has been liable to make more alternate bots to keep crawling through discord.me lists. The only solution to handle this effectively as of current is to delist from discord.me, as it prevents the scraping from happening in its entirety. Spreading the word about this helps limit the reach of this service, and is the right thing to do.
<@&458048859910832149> Symphogear is an intense, high-octane action show! But when the explosions are over, when the fisting ends, and when the gears come off, what do our heroes do on their free time? Today's topic is special, as it's one of the first user-submitted topics! **This week's topic is Free Time!** Write about what the characters of Symphogear do when they're not busy trying to save the world (or destroy it), and don't hesitate to delve deep into how they think in the process!

`I highly reccomend sticking around.`

Additionally... today at around 6 PM EST... We will be having *** a very big event.***
**Thank you.**

***HAPPY FIRST SERVER ANNIVERSARY, @everyone ***! This place has come a long way since its creation, and through the mutual bonds shared by all the users in this server, it has become a wonderful, lively and accepting place where people can have fun. It has been an honor serving this place loyally, and working with everyone to make it the most amazing place ever. I want to thank everyone on the moderating team for making this place a reality, and you all should too! But, most importantly, we at the staff team want to thank ***you*** for being here. If it wasn't for you folks, this place simply wouldn't exist. So, from the bottom of my heart...
@everyone Remember that tomorrow at 5 bst (11 est) is the Jackbox gaming session hosted by Ibu, which will go on for most of the day! It is the beginning of our anniversary events for the server, with Mafia games being hosted the day after! ***IT WILL BE PARTY TIME, HELL YEAH.***

<@&458048859910832149> Everyone has a favorite character. Some people have favorite characters, and can't choose between them! Well, today is the day to choose! ***Today's prompt is about focusing a story around a single Symphogear character of your choosing!*** Yes, anyone! Yes, even Doctor Ver. Yes... even Tachibana Akira. ...yes, even Fudou- WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME ABOUT WRITING INCREASIBLY WORSE CHARACTERS? ...anyway. Due to certain complaints and issues regarding prior submissions, there is now also a ***new standard to writing these stories!*** The limit is now ***three pages***, with a minimum of ***two pages***. This is to help give you guys more space with writing, while still keeping it brief! Happy writing, fellow prompters. Promptees? I dunno. Promptogears. I'm not good with names!
Reminder that the Jackbox gaming session is on July 19th, at 5 PM BST!
https://jackboxgames.com/how-to-play/
We will also be having a Jackbox gaming session hosted by Ibu a day before the anniversary! It'll be super fun as we roast each other and the show to oblivion!
@everyone Yes... it's coming. On July 20th, we will be celebrating the anniversary of the server! Exactly one year ago on this date this server was created, and we will be celebrating the creation of this server with **Hosted Games of Mafia right here!** I will be personally hosting the game session with some thrown in Symphogear themes to entertain and party with people over this server's anniversary. Keep an eye out for other events I'll be conducting in the future also! `I can't wait to see you there...` Don't know how to play?

And if you're not in America? It's too late! You already are... ***in your heart.*** SO GO BLOW SHIT UP WITH FIREWORKS AND GET SOME FOOD AND STUFF YOU WILD ANIMALS. Except if you're in California! California doesn't need more fires. Just... move away from California and go blow up shit in some other empty states, like Ohio.
@everyone
"Man, I love Symphogear, but there sure are some things I'd like to fix..." "Kaneko doesn't know what he's doing!" "GX was terrible!" Opinions all voiced over the years through the long, wacky runs of Symphogear. Love it or hate it, it is Symphogear that binds us together, and those wonderful characters that we all adore. Today's writing prompt puts YOU in the hotseat of writing one! That's right. ***This weeks topic is A Custom Symphogear Season***; whether what you're writing is a scene in said season, the beginning of that season, a literal script, a guess at what XV will be, or even just writing the premise! As long as you're making up the next season of Symphogear, it's congruent to the topic.

We will also be doing something different this time. Due to issues of some people not posting or discussing the given written materials they were given for whatever reason, instead of just handing people something to read individually, each fic will be assigned a day on the second week to be posted and discussed about! That way, everyone gets their share of time and discussion without potentially risking not being mentioned or ignored by someone. People who aren't doing this can also give in their input during the discussion phase.

Remember! It's maximum a page, with an allowable error margin of another page! Anything more than two pages will not be allowed! If you're ever interested about jumping into the fun, just set the role and write! There's no prequisite or prior knowledge of writing needed to participate. This is all one big learning experience!

Have fun! <@&458048859910832149>

<@&458048859910832149> Hello fellow writing nerds! I am formally and officially announcing the writing topic for the first bi-weekly prompt! **The first prompt is: Journey.** Journey of what? I dunno, you're the writer. Could be metaphorical, physical, spiritual? But whatever it is, it better be a journey! Remember the rules: 1 page long (error margin of a second page is allowed but no more), no smut, and follow the subreddit rules! Aside from that, anything goes. Remember to have fun and, when you're finished, PM it to me directly. HAPPY WRITING!
@everyone We're conducting a writing event for Symphogear writers, writers-to-be, and writer who want to be! https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdY8H1lgoy_vX7oiKwCD-Dz17onsYG1nM7HUuXk07j5arEMjA/viewform?usp=sf_link If you want to get involved, <#357682999300718592> if you got any additional questions!
Good news, @everyone ! Have you ever wanted to get a direct update on your favorite symphogear fanfic within the community straight from the author? Have you ever wanted to see some new fanfic additions within the community? Do you just want a reccomendation to read to help curb those hiatus woes? Well, look no further! A brand new role has been added, <@&454478881349435392> that allows authors to ping this group whenever a new fanfic update and/or addition is posted within the community. Authors reserve the right (within reason! Don't ping people 50 times for a single update!) to ping this group whenever they make something new, making fanfic material updates and new additions all the more clearer! This role is ***opt-in***, which means if you ever get tired and want to give up on humanity fanfiction wise, you can always just remove it later. So if you're interested in getting direct, clearer updates on the best the community has to offer, feel free to plop right in!

As Santa Cape slowly fell to his silky bed, preparing to rest for the next year until next Christmas, he failed to realize something was going on with the Christmas magic he dropped for every darling around the world. Why, the Kiricoins he so spread down from the skies; they weren't actually real! They were made of chocolate. Clumsy Cape, so enraptued by his Christmas cheer; he forgot to tell apart the real Kiricoins from the fake ones! He was probably very hungry. As he awoke steadfast, sweating from his confusion, he got onto his sled once more to quickly make amends of his terrible mistake. On Kanade, on Chris, on Tsubasa and Miku! On Chris, and Hibiki, and Serena and Kirika! Quickly, before it's too late!

(It seems the Kiricoin announcement was bugged because Santa Cape's fingers got tied up executing it, potentially breaking a thing. If you requested to get your Kiricoins and were affected by this, feel free to PM me personally so that I may directly deposit the Kiricoin amount into your account. And, for extra compensation in dealing with this, you're also free to request an emoji of your choice for me to create for you! Useable anywhere, anyplace. Just say please!)

With Love,
Santa Cape
```

```And so, as the night turns into dawn, Santa Cape finishes his journey of delivering presents to all of the good people of the server. Whether it be blessing their future XDU rolls or quietly sprinkling SHAFT brand studio quality dust on the delayed Symphogear production, Santa Cape returns back to the South Pole to prepare for next season. "Maybe next time I'll just hand everyone a cape and call it a day," he mutters to himself as he rests within his cape based nest, like some sort of weird, modern dragon. "Mmmm... cape."

In his final Christmas act, Santa Cape leaned toward his unused Kiricoin stash, and threw it across the entire world, making it rain that sweet dess based currency for the entirety of Christmas. Permanently blessing the RV rolls of the server, he laid down and took one big nap, hibernating for the next holiday...

Happy Holidays to the server! May you all have a very lovely Christmas, and if not, may an otherwise miserable day turn around into a beautiful expression of joy you deserve to experience. From all of our hearts to yours, with love, the Staff.```

Hello <@&458048859910832149> members to another session of our writing prompts! Christmas is just around the corner... Now, between you and me, I don't want a lot for Christmas. In fact, there's just one thing I need. I don't care about the presents, underneath the Christmas tree. I just want prompts for my own, more than you could ever know. Make my wish come true, everyone! All I want for Christmas... is prompts.

And spreaking of prompts we got three Christmas prompts lined up for ya! Feel free to choose any of the three following prompts:
```
- A Secret Santa between a group of characters of your choice. What will their reactions be, getting presents from friends they didn't see coming?
- Group Caroling! I know what you're thinking; please put the GENOCIDES back in the cabinet. Everyone goes out to go sing to some people! You /do/ remember they're all mostly singers, right?
- Who could ignore the classic "couple kissing under the miseltoe" fic? You know the drill. You've got two people, and oh! There they are, under the miseltoe! The gayer the better.
```
Some tweaks for this session of Writing Prompts:
- This one, along with the next one, will last for two weeks! You will have two weeks to do this. This is because holidays are a thing and most of you are (unfortunately) with family right now. Take your time!
- As usual, page minimum is 2, page maximum is 4.
- No bonuses! Santa doesn't like greedy children...~ Instead, the usual Kiricoin payment for these Christmas prompts is upped! Instead of the normal 200, it is now 400 for this event and the next one! Merry Christmas.
- Your prompt will be displayed a day after submission to allow for everyone to see and talk about it while making sure all of them aren't forgotten until after the event. The sooner you do it, the greater the feedback!
For those interesting in joining our little writing club, feel free to apply the proper roles on yourselves for updates, and keep an eye out for our <#357682999300718592> channel! It'll be fun to see what everyone submits again. See you all real soon! Ho ho ho!
Freshly graduated from college, I will now be more active in the community. Yes, it's true. Cape now has a degree? In what? Being CAPE, of course! Not pursuing a Masters or a PHD in it though; it's a relatively new field. With this, I'm going to be much more active than ever before! Much... much more active. It's going to be painful for everyone involved. Naturally, that also means that I will be rehosting the writing events again! That's right! Melua has served as a fine substitute during my absence, and I not only applaud her tenacity for getting through each week, but am also proud of the innovation and fascinating ideas that she's put down to the table. We'll be carrying these ideas for future writing prompts to come, though this month may be a bit more traditional just to get me back into the swing of things. Expect brand new prompts tonight as well as a briefing on how it's gonna go down.
**I have returned.**

Thank you all for playing along! I hope you all had a happy Halloween...
```The boning... has ended...```
`If you follow along with this and want me to do an image manip of your choice, please PM it to me! That way I don't forget!`
***NOW, BECOME BONE!***
Everyone who changes their name to something skeleton related is entitled to one (1) free image manip from me, whether it be for shitposting or for something more serious. Consider it my own candy for the metaphorical trick or treating in this baller bone bonanza. It's good for all of what Halloween lasts!
We pardon this interruption of the Subreddit Symphogear Server to alert that it is time for bone. In the wake of Halloween, a strange new occurence is happening... people are turning into Skeletons to be recruited into a vast, undead army. Why? Because even the undead need to watch Symphogear. Even as we speak, the bonification is thoroughly consuming each and every single person, unleashed their inner skeleton's power and having them go grave to grave to tell the dead about the wonders about a show they don't have the eyeballs to see. But they don't need eyeballs to see, or ears to hear, or even brains to process it! All they need is spirit. And that's what this holiday is about!
***```BONE IMMINENT```***

@everyone https://www.zdnet.com/article/mega-nz-chrome-extension-caught-stealing-passwords-cryptocurrency-private-keys/ Putting this up there since a lot of Symphogear media is shared around with Mega; note that this is for the chrome extension, not for the site itself, but please exercise caution! If any of you use Mega actively to the extent to use this extension, make sure to avoid it!

Is it wisdom, or cowardice? Perhaps a mixture of both...
Rulesets could differ between hosts. But, if the possibility were to arise... I wouldn't say no. Despite the overwhelming ***cowardice***.
You can choose to believe him or not. There is nothing to say in the advent of mafia to prevent someone from saving themselves. At least, from my own personal hosting.
_Light shrug._
Irritating... there is nothing more pesky than a lack of bloodshed.

In his first two acts of cowardice, he choose to save himself above all, instead of protecting his comrades. A lucky move that let him live, but saw it paid in blood at the heat of all those killed around him. Then, when his conscience nagged him, begged him to protect a life... unwitting, he saved the one who would go on to kill him. As he stands before the game, to repent for his sins, a question is asked. "If you could do it all again... what would you change?" He closes his eyes. "Not a damn thing." His spine is immediately ejected from his body, as it is snapped on the killer's knee in half and used to choke him until he's dead. So is the story of Scrmz the Doctor. A failure to the end.```

This will be an interesting session.
I guess only the dead know the truth after all.
It technically is. Is that the possibility?
No I am not.
I think you really ought to open your mind to possibilities.
Is there?
Hahahaha...
Or perhaps the truth is more wilder than you care to know.
Perhaps.
Because the order would be Doctor chooses -> Instruction is given for Doctor's death -> Doctor dies -> Whoever the Doctor targets loses their immunity.
can a vig and SK be at a game this size?
The order I host it is that the save the doctor does is at the very end. If the Doctor dies in the same round, then they cannot save the person.
We are hitting peak mafia levels.

***gasp***
they were targetting Lat!Miku
this one was messy, not very articulated
yeah
out of the norm kills wouldn't be mafia, is that it?
Shirabe was a mafia?
night 1?
you investigated Lily, and they're clean, right?
Fool. I aid no one.
My opinions?
A self-confessed Doctor, a self-confessed cop, and a self-confessed villager, all under one roof.
That's interesting.
But, usually there's no reason to...
Not that it's not impossible for mafia to kill their own.
Interesting, considering they're dead.
Yes.

I grow weary of this back and forth.
I'm off from making accusations because I'm afraid of losing trust
but me keeping shut doesn't mean I don't have my suspicions
A paradox in the making. Which is more true? Are they both true? Are they ***both lies?***
Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. Sometimes you can't trust what your own eyes tell you.
He could have asked just for the sake of asking.
It was an inquiry. Whether or not its relevant is up to you.
I saved myself night one
I told him.
That too.
Sure.
Mmhm.
would that even be of any use?
So this is clearly not the doing of a role.
Mafia have the option not to kill anyone.
But, the blood will flow. It's inevitable.

What is a paradox, but two statements that are true, which contradict themselves? 'Shirou is the vigilante'. 'Latooni is the cop'. Two statements, almost seemingly conflicting at their roots, resolved with a simple question answered at the beginning. For the dead heralded it before. That there /was/ a second cop. And yet... it is the cop who gets the axe.```

you a townie

Oh shit





it seems like a gambit to amass influence across subreddits
a lot of the communities he founded or joined all date back 2 years ago to 2015
it seems he began this gambit 2 years ago
the biggest subreddit he owns is r/overlord
or, the dude managed to con his way into joining
i think this may be an operation of multiple people
lots of active users, but not much activity
he didnt found that one
interesting
his biggest subreddit is r/hair
thats convenient
theyre all in order of size here on this list
wait
im trying to decipher what his biggest subreddit is
this dude straight up has subreddits ready for films coming out in 2018 and is squatting on them
the question is: what is his endgame
its been very hit or miss for him, but it seems like he learned from his mistakes and now leans towards anime franchises, which have the advantage of having /some/ niche audience to participate in it, and thus have some sort of activity within
which means he has actively been trying to establish subreddits of communities before their popularity explodes in order to capitalize on it and take advantage of having that kind of connection
ive noticed that his dead subreddits seem to be about franchises that are starting to crawl out of some obscurity, and the ones that remained dead were franchises that never took off
there it is
when did symphogear G air
when did symphogear first air
im seeing a pattern with the dead subreddits he moderates
i am extremely curious now
when did he found the symphogear community
i had a feeling
is there some sort of rule about having this many subreddits under your belt
sort of like kicking someone upstairs; giving someone the title to do the little work it would take to manage the community itself because of how low activity it is
it seems he likely promotes people on occasion only on low activity communities
interesting
some of the subreddits he moderates are straight up empty
(which can potentially be a puppet account)
a lot of these subreddits have either him, or him and one another staff member
this person seems very insular
im curious, how did you manage to become staff
noted
a lot of anime/game communities have him right at the top
it seems he's founded a good majority of them
ive been looking at all the communities this person is a moderator of
interesting
yeah
<@!127644949884698624> did this person found the symphogear community
_cracks knuckles_
i finished a game of solitaire and i ended up teaching someone solitaire
back.

i smell conspiracy.
very ominous, strategic questions
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5ozg4w/what_do_you_pay_for_your_cell_plan_and_where_do/
they had heavy activity in r/worldnews too
it seems likely they could, one of the subs theyre a mod in is r/CloudAtCost and they seem to advertise that a lot
he seems to mod a bunch of obscure games and shows
i want to see the content of his posts
link me his profile
interesting
is this guy active at all in reddit
`clearly, im a mod`
i sense youll need people power to refute the talking point of not having enough mods if it comes up
unless some divine force literally beams this to his brain before we do it, there is no way he can know beforehand
then we should be fine
nobody knows about this but us, right?
well yeah but how will he know we're doing it
or just nuke the whole staff team
the real problem is that if we lose he could get away with doing it after the fact
so he cant depose you immediately during the investigation
he cant; apparently when you report a top moderator, his powers are frozen for that subreddit
alright
this dude is a system of landmines waiting to be set off.
or, even go as far as to hold some of them hostage to get it back
i worry that, if we succeed in gripping r/symphogear away from him, he may retaliate by spreading discontent in other anime communities against us
this person has a lot of pull in several anime communities
there is one thing that worries me
we will also claim he is breaking the nature of the site by exploiting the creation of multiple communities for the benefit of his own agenda, whatever it may be.
our top moderator actively creates communities to own on paper but abandons them by putting people in staff roles to do the work for him.
this is what we will build our case around
Reddit may, at its discretion, intervene to take control of a community when it believes it in the best interest of the community or the website. This should happen rarely (e.g., a top moderator abandons a thriving community), but when it does, our goal is to keep the platform alive and vibrant, as well as to ensure your community can reach people interested in that community. Finally, when the admins contact you, we ask that you respond within a reasonable amount of time.
because i know nothing of reddit.
but yes, i need your help in deciphering reddits rules and terms of service to see if we can find something to nail this guy with
this will be useful information
oh, that i didnt know
that i got
alice, do you think you can dig up the reddit terms of service and see the rules governing the creation and moderation of subreddits
and begin establishing a case
- compile the list of /empty/ subreddits he owns, in anticipation of given franchises
- compile his activity in each and every single subreddit
- compile a list of all the subreddits he owns
i am going to do the following:
when i get home
we need to establish the case that he is founding subreddits to actively gain power as opposed to genuinely contribute to them, and prove that his lack of contributions show that he does not have the best interest towards the community
then, there is only one way to go about this
or is there a founder level ac- alright
cant you just demote him yourself
oh, good
Have you attempted to reach out to this mod yourselves? What was the outcome? (links would be very helpful here) (Note: if you have not done this, your request may be rejected. This process should be an absolute last-ditch effort after all other avenues have been exhausted).
our biggest obstacle might be this catch:
we need to establish a case where this person is actively hoarding subreddits purposefully
ill keep it all here
naturally
...ohhhhhh.
i dont count.
how long have i had mod powers
"Consensus from the modteam is taken from mods who have been on the team for a minimum of 3 months. Members who have been mods for less than three months can still voice their opinion, but it will not be considered part of the consensus."
we need to take the ultra hard way to take this dude down.
fascinating
derp, words
*did you come to him
im curious: were you asked to run the symphogear subreddit, or did he come to you
i think this supports my hypothesis that they actively recruit the most active/congruent member of a community to do the work for them while they sit and own the actual community
this person is /definitely/ a real person, and they moderate a bunch other anime communities
for example, the only other moderator outside of sothisisit and that puppet for the reddit of deathparade is https://www.reddit.com/user/YonkouProductions/
in fact, interestingly, theyre people who are also moderators in other places that match the same interests as what theyre moderating
the other moderators are definitely real people
theres only one i can confirm, and its the one you linked
that is possible
its sorta sad too
***OF STATISTICS***
THE POWER...
cape is going to channel your power
but, do not worry, alice
or involve himself in bigger ones that need help
he actively scouts others to take over and own that he didnt make
he doesnt just make subreddits
so may subreddits, though
_rubs temples_
i cant wait to compile all this data into charts and nail him
man this guy is frightening
also whoops
yeah

i did, it still didnt show up
the one with a ? is because it didnt have the text that says who founded it
this is how its looking like so far

ah, okay
<@!127644949884698624>
so when you're on the top of the moderator list, it confirms that you are the owner, right?
alice, question
_cracks knuckles_
its a chrome app yeah?
got it.
res?
which means i have no choice but to look through his post history repeatedly to see if he's posted in subs
i.e. looking up the content a specific person posted, withing a given subreddit
<@!127644949884698624> how do i find a person's post history within their own subreddit
it is time to begin.
i am awake and at full power
`i begin preparations, commander`
tomorrow
welp.
oh
if i was feeling cynical id say she is purposefully bogging the session down with filler questions to buy time to fufill the quota of the rate she's being paid for
is she paid by the hour
does she do this a lot?
"have you considered using the batteries to dilate?" `"thats not how it works"`
"did you check the batteries" `"this is not what i pay you for"`
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tdyU_gW6WE
its time to bust him.
and make he did
and then he grew to be smart enough to cut out the middleman and essentially make his own.
they initially started out asking for moderator permissions in r/needamod and other places where they can pick him up blindly
they are just a glutton for having titles and being in charge of stuff.
this person has no actual motivations for control, or manipulation, or... anything, really
this is a hoarder.
i think i see what happened
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f2fza/serious_may_i_please_have_your_old_or_not_in_use/

this is starting to paint a clearer picture of what is going on


this man actively stalks r/needamod

interesting...
_squints_
i must comb this man thoroughly
he did not participate in this endeavors until 2 years ago, but he's been a member for 5 years
there is something interesting
_nods_
he seems to post on a monthly basis
...really, a disney channel show
but yeah thats what i got.
that is dumb of them to blow up over, but alright
i see
but the fact that i could actually think about this, and the fact that you could actually suffer that fate and have that be a legitimate concern, is just concrete proof that this is a security risk for our own community
yeah i would never do that
wait, what incident
i am actually curious if i could message him and go "yeah, could you demote alice, please? she's not active" and he'd do it for me without question
someone running a community they have 0 relevance in is inherently a security risk
or stopping anyone that knows him from going "id like to run this place for you" and basically demote all of us
what is stopping anyone from tapping him on the shoulder and doing the same to the remaining staff?
you have the evidence that he staffed people willy nilly and demoted them without question upon your request
in fact, he hardly participates in any sort of community he runs except for extremely bare bones moderation, and the case involving us is very blatantly "he's given us the run of the mill of the place with no regard on staff input"
its been made clear in previous communication that he has no interest in relinquishing the subreddit itself when he has not participated in the community proper
then i guess that is valid, though i would also point out that someone who has accrued this many subreddits and does nothing with them except for the one where he actively advertises a service does not have good intentions for us
oh
so we can't attack from that angle completely
but the problem with that argument is that it is explicitly excluded from being a legitimate argument; that part says "undoing all your hard work does not count as a valid argument"
sure
i will get back to that question once ive finished compiling all of this
that works, yeah
oh
because again, if we fuck up, i worry that in return, he'll purge the staff that did this for a bullshit reason and we wont have a leg to stand on and itll be /MUCH/ harder to take him down then
i want to really hammer it hard to be completely, absolutely certain we can depose of him
not until ive fully compiled all the stats here
it would be interesting to reach out to them to see if they know them, if it didnt risk potentially giving out the plan
having founded them but handed them away
he crops up a couple times in the anime communities iguess owns
do you know someone called FordImperfect
alice, question
this one is just an aside, but. damn.
https://www.reddit.com/r/MakenKi/comments/72tn69/aki_nijou_xpost_from_reroticvisualarts/
question, is it okay to post nsfw materials here if its just us
oh fuck
both were made in the same year to boot
this one redirects to another subreddit, which he also owns
here's an interesting one
https://www.reddit.com/r/SouseiNoOnmyouji/
and has existed for more than a year before that one was out
but https://www.reddit.com/r/ShokugekiNoSoma/ exists
dead as hell
this one was made 2 years ago
take this: https://www.reddit.com/r/ShokugekiNoSouma/ for instance
some of the obscure ass anime things this dude has made subreddits for, have already existed beforehand
alright, so here's the strange part
and here i was thinking symphogear was obscure; this dude has made subreddits of shit i couldnt even fathom
but all these dead subreddits are bumming me out
i am almost halfway there
i need strength
`I WILL WADE THROUGH A THOUSAND SUBREDDITS`
BUT I MUST STAY STRONG
goddamn this is wearing me out
yeah that would be useful
`cape will gladly oblige`
which is likely the work of the mods who actually wanted to put their heart into these places
because this dude owns subreddits that have really nice css done in them
he is actively ignoring communication while being visibly active
he's active as a /user/, but not as our staff leader
yeah, but you're missing the point
a very paradoxial statement that is the crux of the problem
this is easier to answer now with the data with compiled, but the short of it is: he's not actually inactive
he keeps repeatedly coming up as a former owner of some of the anime oriented places
who is this ford imperfect guy
fucking
yep
its likely he wouldnt do this with symphogear so i wouldnt use it as a talking point, but instead keep it as a minor bullet point to reinforce a greater argument (he is a security risk)
they are usually dead subs with no content
yep
he made it in 2014. he owns it. he posted nothing in it.
that i literally just copy/paste the damn row

because the following scenario is so common in it:
i have speed up my chart creation
he keeps cropping up
god, who the hell is this ford imperfect person
2014 was a hell of a year for this asshole
hijacked by our darling mark
https://www.reddit.com/r/kingarthur/
someone made a subreddit for an rpg involving king arthur and its been hijacked to promote a movie with the same name
the deeper i go into these subreddits the more abstract and esoteric things are getting
its loaded with the particular brand of youtube spam aimed at toddlers that people have accused of it being a hostile AI bent on brainwashing children
i trust your judgement, though.
loose lips sink ships, etc etc
ive seen him have a habit of being flakey and air-headed, doing things without thinking sometimes, and this is very important information
im aware hes not malicious, but that is not what i worry about him
you... didnt give him the real reason, right
i think you can coax it out of him without him knowing what its for
we need a screenshot of the message of the person who told him no
okay, but this will not help; all it confirms is that khairz sent that message
but, if we had a screenshot of that pm, we can confirm that he did this and use that as good ammunition against him
the stats im compiling work because theyre all things on reddit but thats the only thing theyre interested in
i read reddit's policies on accepting evidence of things and they unfortunately dont accept convos on discord or hearsay as evidence; the only concrete thing theyre looking for is things on reddit, by reddit
you need to bug khairz to get the pm where he was told not to
the pm happened in reddit, yeah?
_raises brow mightily_
scroll through this

`WE'VE STUMBLED ONTO SOMETHING MUCH GREATER THAT THICKENS THE PLOT`
***ALICE***
ALICE
alice
oh my god
oh no
oh
geno of all people?
_raises brow_
no thats all i got, unless you got something more to add
_pats his screenshots folder_
or consume communities people didnt want
and how i can reinforce by demonstrating that he used to actively creep r/needamod and constantly find either staff or the means to renew dead subreddits he owns
which you can indeed prove by pointing out how easily he just washes away staff members
because we're not focusing on the hypotheticals of whether other subreddits might be hijacked; we're worried about his administrative style leading to someone hijacking /us/
or the other bigger ones he has
that phrasing also lets us bypass the questioning of why r/overlord hasnt had that happen to them yet
theyll think we're being paranoid; we should best phrase it as 'a security risk'
we shouldnt phrase it that way
posts iraq news in r/world
makes a hub for iraq news
man this guy is dumb
plus i couldnt do that to you guys
we've got enough concrete evidence here to not do that
hell no
CAPTAIN ALICE
_TYPES FERVENTLY IN THE SONG TERMINAL_
If that doesn't give the folks working the case a good kick in the head then I dunno what would
Because otherwise we will have someone who we don't know, who doesn't want to be known, who doesn't want to let go, whose motivations we don't know, who doesn't want to know our community, holding all the cards
All this together shows that he is a massive security risk to our community, and that we want to guarantee the security of our community by having it be run by someone who actually actively contributes to it
Fact: this man will do whatever it takes to arrange it so that he can keep his staff complacent by following their whims no questions asked, regardless of who it is
Fact: We are not the only community with this problem, and the charts show the man is a hardcore squatter
Fact: we have reached out to him in the past and he hasn't responded to us
Fact: the majority of the communities he's in, he isn't active, buy he himself is active
We don't need to focus on the history to get this guy; by focusing on what he's doing now, we can make a compelling argument with our data
One thing I regret not documenting is which communities are just flat out empty
Has the spreadsheet been useful to you, you're more statsy than me
Oh hey geno's here
that i saw
x-files style
i feel like we're slowly unspooling some greater conspiracy at play
the plot thickens
i saw he lurked around in r/needamod a lot
interesting
that entire chart and the data points you can expound on only get more damning by each successive argument you can pose
how does it look
wait no, open office was what i used
i used to have the libre suite before i got the microsoft stuff for free from my campus
that too
if its the case i can copy paste this sucker in
i think google docs allow for spreadsheet based collaboration
hm.
oh
did that work

would you like a copy of this <@!127644949884698624>
the red emphasizing the bad shit he is doing, as in having too many subreddits and not caring for them
i changed the colors up across the board; the plan was to have the red and green style to represent good and bad metaphorically

if this does not rock their heels i dunno what will
the evidence is pretty damning

this is a nice workout
it has been a while since ive done some `real shit` in excel
`the number crunching has begun`

literally nothing in between
he has some posts in may and some posts in september
<@!127644949884698624> no posts show up between those dates
found it.
wait
the date only shows for edited posts
no, wait
nevermind
reddit is rounding out everything to '2 years ago'
how do i see specific dates
i did it.
its done
its over.
sure
sweet release
oh my god, im closer to the end now
i am a little bit more than halfway done.
making this chart is a godless task.
this is a godless task
_ RUBS TEMPLES_
also this is funny
https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackLightining/comments/5icia7/sorry_man_but_you_missspelled_lightning_in_the/
in fact, its good we know who it was, so we dont talk with our foot in our mouths
unfortunate, but we may not need it
for reasons we dont know
only to own it
the fact that he refuses to hand over ownership despite there being people who would be willing to go above and beyond for the subreddit (he wouldnt even have to be removed, he'd just be demoted) means that he has no interest in its betterment
his inactivity is evidence that he has no interest in the community, and his activity in other places signifies that we arent even close to being a priority, let alone anything to him
but now i need to adjust everything accordingly
which is frankly, sick as hell
this is what i have so far

as long as you make backups, sure
but one was a test one
technically i did make two
...wait, no
i made exactly one chris banner
TOO BIG
whoops.

hm
nevermind
how do i access css again
i have an idea
`we gotta dank it`
it would fit with the halloween theme
glitch, is there anyway to make the subreddit theme dark
yeah
this is what i get for listening to power metal as inspiration
i accidentally made the banner more badass than i meant to

wait, shit
i was making a halloween themed kirika banner, but...
so
tch
never made one since the original batch focused on axz
nope
done
kk
can repeated patterns be implemented in the background of the subreddit?
for starters, its gotta be dark
`im going to do them all today`
_cracks knuckles, `opens third eye`_
end of tomorrow will be hard, i got class, so...
do we keep the random axz banners or do we permanently make it kirika?
oooh, sure
except no, thatd be cruel
`the header is serena jam`
yeah
but it made sure not to delete it
i commented out the rotator for now just to see how this header syncs with the rest of it
true
i dont have the time currently for the minutiae
i mostly went for big sweeps
oh, yeah
but, how do you think looks what i did as of now, since i finally sorta came closer to what i was envisioning
itd look pretty wicked
true
okay doke
i am more fearful of touching the other reddit
i suppose for now i will upload the images and wait then
...oh
do you want me to carry over these changes to the other reddit or wait for your signal
its as good as it gets for tonight.
sort-of.
its done
now, the final touch...
now it is stylish.
sorta
I FIXED IT
its dominant
notice how you can select it between the cracks that are visible
its because its overlapping, the element
hm.
yeah
made everything transparent.
accidentally, ah
man, i am so glad this is a sandbox and not the real thing
oh.
i found it.
yeah
...
i dont know the name of the class
i know, but i need the name
like, ALL of that, since its transparent by default
the container
the box in general
its the thread appearance
i am bashing my head trying to figure out what it goes by in the css
@here what is the css to edit this

oh
wait
it is
okay back
Sure gimme a moment since I'm away
Oh right
Yeah plus purple is a compliment and `it's shirabes color`
do you want me to revert that? i can understand if its a weird choice but i did it purposefully to tell apart unclicked links more easily
the ones that have been clicked fade into the background
*they havent been
they pop more to denote that theyve been clicked
i was about to say i did the opposite, but then i remembered it was exactly that
oh, yes
nope
alright
what was the other thing again
I DID IT
mmmm
nothing changed.
its never that simple.
#siteTable a.title {
    color: #00f;
}
#siteTable a.title:visited {
    color: #369;
}
of course
tch
lemme see...
though i shoved it in and it didnt change
yeah i looked it up
anyway the css is safe now since i got rid of the text color thing, now its just the changed box
yep
i need to edit the /hyperlink/ color
of course i cant edit the colors of the titles; color isnt the thing id set to change the text color for, because all of the titles are hyperlinks
im a moron
...
definitely isnt safe yet
im trying that but the change isnt happening
let me see if...
thats where i fucked with the background behind the text for the title
or any other text in a submission div container
but not the text of the title itself
i managed to change the color of the thing under the submission title
axz styling
I NEED HELP
i have figured out how to fuck with every element /except/ the text
man
kk
i have no idea how selectors work
i have some free time right now since class is canceled, so ill be stuck on campus for a bit. but, i dont have my usual image editing tools at my disposal
Kk
I see
Ah
What is this
`we get it discord, you're ~quirky~`
as useful as seeing who joins the server is, im almost on the verge of strangling discord with how dumb the messages are
nope
i dont have xdu on my phone and my xdu account gathers dust quietly
`I AWAKEN`
_slowly sinks back into his chamber again with a slow hiss_
i must slumber
Patriarchy so strong it even permeates in this phones autocorrect
*make
I know how to do the things for the most part but the class name is always a hunt
The one thing that slows me down is not knowing the names
Male a list and find me some CSS subreddit guides that tell me where this is
brb
nope
but for now i feel done, and i have to start walking in 5
ill keep those classes in mind
except when i edit those it doesnt show up
yeah
midcol.unvoted is the state of the container when nothing is voted on
midcol.unvoted?
you remember how you pointed out that it was potentially in...
okay, so
i was testing it last time having upvoted or downvoted nothing
and its because /every/ state of upvoted and downvoted needs to have the same state
i cant recreate the dumb 'give the score a background' detail and i think i understand why
i give up
okay
that way its not too square
the one last touch i want to do is redo the midcol background i gave it to give it a rounded appearance like some of the other stuff and then do the same with the rest
when i get home i wanna watch the subs and catch up with some homework
ill keep playing around until 7:45 but from there its all you
i start going home around 8
i can sprite those another time
at least now i can keep it in mind when im at home and can make real, proper sprites
i dont think ill stick with them but they are what they are for now
apparently arrows are sprites so i changed em
thank you reddit
i made my own fucking arrows from scratch
also, fuck giving this a background, i have a better and less hair ripping idea
sure
SORT OF
PROGRESS!
hm.
hm
midcol was the right track
the solution is more complex than midcol
im reading some stuff now
i made it transparent by accident.
bad news
good news, you're right
it blends too much with the background and id like to differentiate it

the issue is if we go this route id want to do want more touch and edit this:
i think i like it like this
<@!127644949884698624>
that should work better with a perfectly dark background like that
there
lemme change the hue of the purple, though
you get a cool scanline effect from the background scrolling through it
its interesting
check it out

hey alice
haha
yay
i figured itd be a cute touch
much like the Ver one
yep

i dont actually need to do that
well, actually
oh, yes
finished with subs
i literally just got home, did some things, sat down, and started downloading subs
naturally
Bbl
But I trust you and your judgement has led me to the right track
Hopefully, I can't actually confirm it until I do stuff
I WILL EAT THEM
I WANNA GO TO MCDONALDS
`MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM`
BUT MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM

but it is late and i am...
and it bothers me too
it is
`which i really dont wanna do`
and then test for size
which means i not only have to make and edit these sprites by extracting them, i have to make a special spritesheet for them
and we're at the cap for images on this skin
which makes it six sprites
and there's three buttons
one as a normal buttona and one that highlights when you hover over it
technically its two
not without changing the whole sprite
look closely
yep
`why cant these people use things that arent images`
besides the dumb buttons that i am sure as shit not changing
is there anything else im missing
in the future ill need to concatonate the sprites for the up/down votes into a sheet
i noticed the hard way
MUCH BETTER
an image editor for ants?
what is this
_squints_
and then reupload it
i need you to invert the text and the black line seperating the server names and the 'come join us' bit to white
you see the discord invite icon and text that was customized
can you do some extremely light image editing for me while i do this
yeah it needs work
just needs tweaking
also i did it
to be honest i had no idea how it was happening in the first place, though i liked it too
i seriously have no idea how that stopped happening
_eats_
but the problem is that the text is already in the pallette shade that already works with that dark green
tch
thus, ill wing it
my puny brain has forgotten what the shade looked like
wait, so when you say light green but not pale green do you mean a `forbidden third shade of green`
one day...
that i will indeed carry over to help make that SONG terminal skin one day
this is so painful but is also a very nice learning experience
oh, true
i dont remember making the sidebar dark green
but the weird thing is
i dunno, i think pale green might work better to show off the black text of the invites
you mean the light green
i dont know.
interesting question
oh

oh you're gonna fucking love how these pendants came out.
oh
wait nvm found one
alice can you dig up a ref of a symphogear pendant
i will much more happily sprite those now since i can do those

apparently there's a css function within reddit that lets you cut that off

it looked like a thing so i put it in
no idea
this will help you, brb
https://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/1qomjg/how_do_i_change_the_look_and_text_of_the_button/
(this is how i removed the submit button's nubs)
otherwise it inherits everything
the text under it is
if you want to unset them you have to specify the color for the submit button's text, which incidentally isnt an image
when i was doing it i went "OH IT ALL LOOKS SOLID" and i didnt realize it was because res was doing it
damnit res
i see what you mean
oh
So is Fine, we never really know Ryoko since fine took her over since before the 1st season
Carol is a big character
Cut Ryoko
Since the background image is a screenshot from an episode whose contrast has been upped to be pixellated and then passed over an opaque green layer
It came from the background image
That's the light lime green the text has
I can think of something for her though
Nope
Thank you for reminding me of Fines cheap horseshit
Yeah it was in G
`DESS!`
square in the back by scythes
shirabe gets stabbed by kirika
wait, there is one
kk
kk
when are we starting that
hella
ohhh, true
what could we give as a reward
that would be pretty fun actually
I thought it was something `a bit different`
Ohhhhh
What
i hope you are having a good day glitch
yay
how is everyone doing
I AWAKEN
night
meanwhile i too must sleep
i think thats it.
i absolutely wont touch it for now
i wont touch it anymore i promise
damnit
`glitch is powerful`
and it looks alright without res too
that looks good

i actually winced at it
that was fucked
at this rate i wonder if anyone is really dead
at this rate i wonder if saint germain is really dead
hehehehehehehe
i wish it had the `WASTED` mark from gta on it
the best one is probably near the end when her ass gets hauled to the moon
i hate it deeply
it is

<@!127644949884698624>
also `im sorry glitch sempai`
i actually forgot chris cried when fine died
wow
man, tsubasa sounds so much more younger in this
`It has been too long, old friend.`
_gently wipes a tear_
_is immediately greeting by Hibiki yelling out the word Symphogear from her fucking lungs_
_starts up the last episode of the 1st season to look up fine disintegrating_
so tomorrow i am going to talk to me professor thoroughly
and by done i mean i cant do shit because nothing is working as to the instructions to this lab
im done
also i need to shit out an assignment i havent started thats due in the next 3 hours
hehe
Fucking, how dare you exploit Genjuros big heart
If it wasn't for her cheap ass move
Also genjuro could have totally kicked her ass
Gimme a moment
Also the best one is Fine crumbling to dust
She just stuffs herself into a new body afterwards
It's midway through gx
Carol does technically die once
<@285555416056856576> i hope this helps
for easy tweaking and identification of what ive added
anything i do will be pasted at the very bottom of that space
i did a smart to help glitch when she does any tweaks to any messes i made by explicitly making a space where i do all of the changes i do
ill fix it
We eat the channels
Yay
Derp, I misread
Oh
Because we're muting noise
Though I feel like we'd be better off calling the title Noise
Nice
I am sorry if I am coming off as a bit of a worrywart, I don't mean to say this as a "THIS IS AN ATTACK ON THE SANCTITY OF MODERATION"
Okay
But yeah, I know it came from a good place and all and I'm not upset but you need to be careful, even if it's someone you trust; there's other problems aside from that, that can arise
Yeah fuck that guy
That's our job, not theirs
I would advise not to give mod to people power to ban people for a variety of reasons
I propose making our own hostess, a personality with a reddit account we can all share and post as
We need a formal host personality
If we're going to host this event
I realized something
I just woke up half an hour ago
Wait, who is a troll, what
night
time to sleep
no idea
its post highlighting
yeah that was me testing if it could be changed period
check it
okay
i worry that if i fuck around itll break
id rather wait for lyssa on that one
done
that seems to be a res thing since it doesnt show up for me
no idea
`this is so bad`
i am gawking
we have caught him square in the goddamn act



we have literally caught him red handed doing the thing we are arguing as to why is a problem
this /needs/ screenshots
`is to make more fucking subreddits to own`
that the very first action this dude did upon logging in for the first time in a month
but this needs to be recorded
no no, im not
he literally signed on
this needs to be recorded for posterity
https://www.reddit.com/r/OusamaGame/
https://www.reddit.com/r/CodeRealize/
3 HOURS AGO
AND HE MADE IT
`he's made more subs`
hes not only posted more
haha
im not surprised he posted something
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/229596738615377920/337478259283591169/The_Goddamn_Cape.png
sure
i will keep thinking and tell you if i get another idea
_nods_
im sorta fresh out for now
hmmm
oh
but i dont want to tamper with glitch's fixes
as for the res i think i know what to do
plus the contrast works in a way
its likely a leftover element being inherited from something else and id rather not fuck with it too deeply
the shaded kirika green can stay
wow, that was simple
kirika green deployed
there
fuck, what was the hex for that...
but ill roll with it
a lot of these greens are kirika green
ohhhh
i was contemplating it
dark kirika green?
are you using res
er, added/edited/changed/etc
No idea
Unless you're doing a broad modification it's prudent to edit things individually then just paint them at the root
It's likely inherited from a userlist class but you can probably specify ul.tabmenu's color independently
I'm on my phone so I can't do stuff
Backish
also bbl
yeah
with all this other stuff thats legacy from the last person who made things i get sorta confused with what to touch and what not to touch
for me its more learning more thoroughly and taking the time to do real, quality changes as opposed to the theme that we did now that, while it looks okay, i feel with more time it could be stellar
absolutely, positively barebones
if we do another skin in the future i think id want to work with a 100% vanilla reddit css theme
this time around the changes have been simple
yeah
i dont see a reason why to change it for this theme
size and padding has all been left identical
yay
glitch-sempai did i do a good seperating all the changes i did to its own category this time around
and yeah, thats also true
oh, its an RES one
its likely a.voteWeight has different stuff within itself that can be changed
lemme look up the things a.voteWeight is capable of
the thing with subreddit css is that is exists with its own library of stuff outside of traditional css due to using site specific classes that have unique functions
lemme see
sorry was taking a quiz
ill gladly provide you some good css books to start with
when glitch sees it all she should have to do is look at it and tweak when necessary, and once its solid, place it in the correct location
everything i change is now its own category
this time i am
and i dont want her to be bogged down when they deal with a lot already
i just worry ill break things too bad and glitch will need to clean up again
i suppose i can try to do something with res comment boxes later
there.
ill set it to lime
who is this mech person anyway
but right now it looks pretty done
whatever black text needs fixing show me again so i can tackle it
`ass`
`i need subs`
what needs fixing that remains
`all systems enabled`
i am home
if it wasnt all on a shared webpage itd be easier
_quietly plays https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94ku1x360Zw while alice becomes the debugger_
so there wasnt a real point to worry
but then i remembered all of them are still on the other real subreddit
i yanked the image i posted in the event that i thought itd be lost
yeah
i didnt keep the original
OH THAT THING
OH
then no.
oh
this is the one i extracted

of all 6 of them
not wiki
er, subreddit
is it the transparent one on the wiki
uhhhhhh
oh
_shooes away rat_

night
sleep time
im howlin at the moon
i still have the version of cape i cut out back when i designed the ALL AMERICAN OC SYMPHOGEAR, KATHYRIN SMITHSONIAN
thankfully
i am home, `i am in full systems operational mode`, i am tired
discord finally got its shit together
Which is very soon
I'll get you one when I get home
kk
which is photoshop, and the template i custom made for easy banner making
i do not have the `full toolset` i use to make my banners here
when i get home i can
not right now
alright
true
we randomly choose 2 characters and then have a thread dedicated to talking about which one is better
so: character discussions threads, with a catch
sorry, back
I have come up with an activity idea
_nods_
well to be honest one of the other ideas i had was using a proxy account as a "hostess" of sorts; you said ryoko-bot could be good for that
i am used to that, so sure
_cackles maniacally_
`just make the character who wins a stuffed turkey as opposed to a decapitated head`
before i suggested the character contest. doing it now wouldnt finish on halloween, but we can readapt the idea for thanksgiving
we're nearly halfway through the month. while we do need to beef up our css powers, i feel focusing on css as opposed to just doing community stuff to spurn activity on the subreddit may be mismanaging our priorities
it has been seventy two years since we last did a thing.
_looks at watch_
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm***mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm***
_sits up, stretches_
_shoves coffin lid off of the coffin he was laying in_
tomorrow ill do it
today? no
sure
i have the most here probably but even then its not at a professional level
also i am finally at my desktop but i need to do a thing
true
i just feel bad in general because folks arent happy with it
yeah
Maybe it was just a bad idea in general
Man, people are unhappy with the theme
We may need a small group of skin testers
Rip
Not homework stuff but stuff I'm doing as a favor
I have to do some stuff today
I really liked Genos
it should be `DESS!`
cape

...true....
...
true, ive already created the best one
there's a good amount of artists in the community
where people submit designs for their own symphogear character
a symphogear original design contest
we should do
thats it
oh my god
He's not promoting them outside of its subreddit though
Yes
*popular
He's just spamming and sitting on things to get populat
Yeah, but it's a strong enough case to show that he has no interest in the communities he makes
This works to our benefit, catching him in the act in real time
I will look and log it all
Yes, but if we cut them off before we deal with him, I sense retaliation this way
We don't need anyone tipping anyone off
It would also be best to take down soiguess before we proceed
Outside the wiki, which is dead, there's no other place for them to go unless bingo goes all out with his site
I guess it just boils down to how they would take it if we cut them off
That's not a problem if we stoke activity
Oh derp
I mean, one person infrequently posting a sub does not make
There aint
Also, alright then
Back, just got out of class
that is sorta the point on why the valkyrie server is a good idiotsink
except if they dont have a place they feel they can go away to, what is stopping them from repeatedly doing it until such a time where they can fool us properly?
spam is not the concern here; ban evasion is more what im leaning towards
splitting them through multiple public communities reduces the chance of people getting spiteful and coming back with more accounts, or getting nastier
neither am i, but by having more visible places for people to go to, you can divide the activity of people you remove and thus insure lack of cooperation between people who could potentially have an axe to grind against a community
besides, in a way, they serve as a useful means to establish an idiotsink of sorts
that would be counter-intuitive to the desires of having them on friendly terms with us
that works
true
_slaps his own face like a bongo_
xdu... challenges...
uhhhhh
is that even possible
...xdu tournaments?
literally the only things about xdu i know is plot stuff
the fact that i only know this fact and nothing more and only vaguely know the ramifications of what this means only sorta reinforces that you should handle it
sort of
that i know
like i can make the threads but i would just not be able to do anything because i dont play it
i am very disconnected with xdu, so that one will have to be your thing
`are you sure`
_turns to face you while walking on the plank on his vessel_
that would be sick as hell
true
what color should they be, ill do it after class ends now
but `sexy grid silhoutte`
which isnt too bad
this is how it would look
lemme demonstrate
it would but it would cut off at the corners since theyre all presented within a circular bubble
well the problem is that i made it a square picture on purpose; anything else and discord will muck it up, since it only presents perfectly square, center pictures perfectly
`Is this not the most sexy robot avatar in the history of robot avatars.`
pal
buddy
is it alright if i swap my avatar real quick to see how it looks
discord will shrink this picture down as an avatar
`The future... of Ryoko...`

behold.
do not discount my photoshop powers just yet
booby notwithstanding, i went for a silhoutte appearance since its a bot
i will keep playing with it to make it cooler

here's how it looks like so far
i can make both.
oh!
im assuming this is for the purposes of making it into flair
coming right up
i genuinely wonder if he is human, or some sort of strange alien creature who thinks normal human interaction is being a community janitor for medium sized places
i want to see his thoughts and what he is thinking
i honest to god want to spend five minutes in the world of soiguess
they are essentially at our mercy if we ditch them
_watches the convo quietly_
Who knows if he'll answer it
God this guy is slippery
Tch
But
What
*owns
And the majority of his posts self promote subreddits he oens
oh shit she was here and i didnt get to say hello
i want to teach it friendship and not have it turn into another elfnein filled with salt and hate
_grabby hands_
i want to play with ryoko here
_takes off his mask and his entire outfit and disguise to reveal SAINT GERMAIN HIMSELF_
`I've waited so long for my influence to manifest once every two thousand years... and now, it has come to fruition, in the heart of the most obscure anime imaginable.`
`So you've figured out who I really am...`
_dramatic classic shounen pose_
do you like this or do you wanna do something else
but yeah, there it is
does this not scream "i am sleek and sauve and also a professional"
<@285555416056856576> what do you think
THERE
40 x 40
there.

goddamnit

whats flair size again
i just had to do some editing
well the cape is technically official art
in the meanwhile ill make a flair
gotta sit and wait.
nothing
fuck you too, discord.
it says im changing my avatar too fast
_gets in his ryoko costume_
bam

that can be easily arranged
jinx you owe me an html tag
it was in .tagline
fixed it
Lemme check
the font color is the purple we used for the spooky skin
we may need to fix this

cowboy bebop
ya

not a lit

`Call me Nemo 'cause we're gonna get forty thousand leagues under the sea in this shit`
_grips the submarine's steering wheel, puts on the shades_
thank you.
awwwwwwwwwwwwwww
i feel like if i joke around in this community people will get angry and it wont be well recieved
to be honest i feel that actually is a big hurdle here; the ice is thick as hell here
which is why i dial that down tremendously here, as opposed to the other discord
i would want to do more with this place but i feel my crude shitposting wouldnt be well recieved here
of course, we still need to think of how to stimulate activity regardless
through the decay of the valkyrie server, we can recruit members dissatisfied with their moderation, and then slowly sap them away while having a growing retention rate, because we actually moderate competently.
people who are 4channy shitposters that we dont want, will either stay in sgg as opposed to bothering us or bug the valkyrie discord with their style of moderation cramping on user interaction (folks like courier showing up on their doorstep and being unable to deal with it immediately as opposed to dumping their asses), while we get quality member joins
the sheer stratification of servers means that the valkyrie server suffers from competing with the sgg server, while we reap the benefits by stratifying the quality of user that we personally recruit through further user sifting
But rather a broad list of other servers
The reason I lump them both together is to present it as if it's not something directly at them
The subreddit one being the biggest one, and then the two below it being much smaller talking about "sponsored non-subreddit discords" which would be the valkryie server and the sgg server
We can restructure the appearance into 3 buttons as a list
A real power move
I do have an idea
in the midst of horrible shit my blood is hot and my hands are ready.
im itching to take him down.
so remind me again when are we gonna gank this soiguess guy
what a good boy
doggo
yay
can we give her a special role
_gently sheds tear_
i-its okay. i understand...
instead of the cool silhoutte
also i see you just used the profile one
fuck yeah
its funny because i made this before that crazy golden gungnir came out in the last episode
`my solid gold hibiki...`
i made this for the valkyrie server as an anniversary gift but they didnt do anything with it

also can we make this into an emoji
and i can hug her
soon ryoko bot will be here
No that works
I'm gonna check out cytube to see if it can be done without anyone hosting so we don't have to rely on someone specifically
*poses*
good question
we could even make a game out of it where people guess what it is
the first few for the sake of organization but shuffling around the rest or even keeping them a surprise
im fine with it being semi pre-determined
yep
maybe shuffle it around for the weaker voted shows
and then we arrange the list that way
everyone votes for anything and avoids what they dont want to vote for
my suggestion for voting should be that we shouldnt exclude anything, but rather using the voting as a means to order the list from what people what to want
back
brb
ah
im curious though, why doesnt he want it public
that works too
that works too
a personal account yes, but im making a shared one now
or crunchyroll
not yet, we can stream whatever we want through rabbit using kissanime, and okay
okay.
ohhh
okay
ill set up my rabbit myself personally when i get home so i know everythings functional
kk
ohhhhh
though cytube does have a chat
oh, true
ill probably be hauled off to the movies around 4-5
i can set it all up but i cant stick around since today my mom went "hey son we're watching a movie tomorrow" and that was the end of that
`wish it had the purple avatar but beggars cant be choosers`
_hugs it_
BOT IS HERE
`make it talk`
talking to it
_cracks knuckles_
they are literally the pits.
but evo packs are just...
i feel you might have gotten away with it with any other pack
like, unfathomably shitty
`the deal was too shitty`
i knew it couldnt go through.
and damn.
HA!
that part was intense, yeah
not to say yuyuyu didnt fuck with me; it did, but not /as/ much
the megucas hit me more but i guess moral shit hits me hard than existential shit
really?
meguca had a stronger punch
yuyuyu isnt that bad
yeah go for it.
gotta wait a bit.
i cannot check because its temporarily frozen
let me check
change it at your will
password: Sunstone123
login email: jborj005@fiu.edu
its under my email for now but you can edit it
so we are now Symph Subs, the eponymous embodiment of the subreddit itself
it asked for a first and last name
what would you like as a shared password
okay
no.
oh
give it some opacity
i would choose a different background color (something darker) and then make it transparent
nice
itd feel too weird
id rather keep the old one than have it with a background
ehhh
that looks sick
`have mercy on me`
Jesus lord gonna give me a stroke here in public with this porn
this one?

you mean the one in the subreddit right now
i feel like shes murdered them.
but ryouko says it so innocously
okay, i know these are quit messages
kk
that is ominous
okay doke
she turned into Fine
i can even make it look rose gold, or platinum
i kept the raw files of the thing so `it is completely in my power to change colors and outlines`
no, the icon itself. instead of golden hibiki i can make it a different colored silhoutte with a colored outline so its not `The Square`
***yes***
though honestly i feel we can do better if we're using that hibiki pic, but im feeling lazy right now after having watched a movie
if you want
_***POSE!***_

_POSE!!!_
_POSE!!_
_POSE!_
USING THE PRINCIPLES OF GEOMETRY, YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT BY PAINTING OVER THE ORIGINAL, AND THEN RESIZING THE NEW ONE TO MATCH THE SIZE OF THE INNER ORANGE AREA TO BEGIN WITH!
FOOLISH ALICE! IT WAS A RUSE! YOU DON'T /NEED/ TO OVERLAY THE ORIGINAL HIBIKI OVER THE COPY
_rips off shirt and goes to town_
just make a new layer and paste it in again

again
if you need the raw file
`Dirty.`
the bits got...
ah, i see
maybe a bit lighter
mmmm, then i dunno
if you like it like that, go for it
yeah y would have to be a higher positive integer
might want to position it a bit higher now that its a bit bigger
i think thats good
emphasize the sticker element

i decided instead of a black border to do a small black shadow
or a white border

let me tweak it
strange shed be showing up small, its a pretty large image
did you download the full image
note that this was the image i used to goldenify hibiki
`a hibiki sticker`, with the orange used from the old image
i feel this fits better than golden hibiki
abracadabra

_snaps fingers_
_cracks knuckles_
you want me to make that one cooler
OH
also hell yeah space jam
damn, that sucks
howve you been?
hey lyssa
ill use that then
im trying not to be too hostile
<@!127644949884698624> is this okay
I've been waiting to give a response to this, but its been a week now and he hasn't shown up. This is a bit ridiculous given the sheer intensity of activity I've seen this person participate in, and the fact that I don't really hear or see any involvement from them makes it feel like they don't really care about the place.

I don't really understand why we should be operating under someone who's simply not here and has not a single investment of this place beyond owning it.

geno will be a boon but we cannot rest all our laurels on her
then we'll have to refocus our efforts towards something else
i see
youd have to poll for interest and hours again
ah, okay
well its more that i dont know what to say because i feel unprompted and trying to force myself to say something aside from "you should leave" may end badly
what should i respond with?
***IM READY TO FIGHT***
She could potentially get angry at us for targeting the valkryie discord and do something
Take care of soiguess first
thats a big hibiki
oh
looks good
HUHWHAT
how do they usually make themselves known, anyway
eh, i already put down the bait just in case
oh
got it
is it fine if i @ everyone
but, i can make do
i wouldve preferred it being a symphogear pairing that gets under his skin since its more topical
`I am not a very bright man.`
i literally straight up thought it was maria's mom figure x some random lydian girl
since i was thinking crack symphogear ships
as mam***u*** x kyouko
misread this
my brain
...oh my god
wait
OH, YOU MEAN PMMM KYOUKO
or one of the song employees
is that one of the anime janai crew
_peruses memory of symphogear characters_
like...
...kyouko?
whats the one ship that would get under ack's skin
just to be sure
i wonder if theres any other alts on here
k
thank goodness i never step foot in it.
whys he harassing you, anyway
`now you see why we get rid of people immediately without fanfare that are a nuisance`
<@!127644949884698624> what do you think
than some good old fashioned mutual drawing?
https://drawpile.net/
and it hit me: what better way to bring them alongside fans in general together...
you see, this community has a lot of prolific artists that enjoy symphogear, that probably want to joke around and have fun while talking about symphogear things
and in turn even promote artists
also i have come up with my latest gambit in coaxing more involvement from the community
i see
Did we beat up soiguess
Alright
That's true but also this is someone who has actively been a detriment to literally every place they get involved in; it seems better just to wash our hands of it and call it a day instead of wasting time humiliating them
It's pretty clear this person has no good intentions whatsoever
Why don't we just ban him and call it a day
Oh
I have no idea who this person is
Who is crack kun
`HE JUST POSTED TWO HOURS AGO`
`TWO HOURS AGO`
`for fucks sake he's active RIGHT NOW`
...
have we kicked soiguess's ass yet
Goddamn
Any word yet from the admins
Rip
any response from The Powers That Be yet
it seemed wise to just avoid that argument altogether
yeah, but i recall one of the things they explicitly said to avoid was saying "he's gonna delete everything"
All of this is really badly phrased and I feel the reaction from the Admins will be "stop trying to steal the subreddit"
...alice, you are my friend and I care about a lot, but I must be honest
That's explicitly what they say not to do
Mmmmmm, saying that they'll come back and erase work is a bad move
gladly
lyssa gets 5 points
what is... the name of that mountain?
in episode one of gx, hibiki manages to punch through a mountain to escort a spaceship so hard that she manages to tunnel through it and shrink the mountain as a whole, forcing it to be adjusted in terms of statisics.
_takes out question card_
alright symphonerds, i have another trivia question that needs answering
its kadingir but it has (´・ω・｀) plastered on its walls everywhere
having the insane luck to have all of these in one hand wins you the game. period. no questions asked.
Kadingus
Kadoober
Kadango
Kadoogle
Kadenko
they are
5 of the response cards are just joke versions of saying Kadingir, because i wanted those cards to be the exodia of the card set
*much
I may rope the valkryie folk in later to get question inputs from them, not that I expect enough
Obviously
2/5ths done
now i move on to season 2
ive already compiled all the season 1 jokes i can think of
i am 1/5th done with it because its going to be a massive one spanning all 4 seasons plus some xdu stuff
i am compiling a symphogear one
so now
i realized its not that hard to make one
and after some reading
that you can custom create xyzzy decks (the online cards against humanity clone)
and i realized
you see, i did some digging
i must tell you what my secret project is
a massive shitpost has manifested before my eyes
sure, give me a moment though
are we shedding the valkryie server
so i guess (haha) we might as well do it
sigh
i have half a mind to ditch soiguess anyway and just make a second symphogear subreddit
accursed reddit beaurucracy
_quietly prepares a surprise project_
yep, so do i
@everyone i have been talking to our members and it seems if we ever want to do group gaming stuff, starbound is our best bet

The wrong way
Looks like he went
Yeah
Did we beat up soiguess
yay

no, its still there
did we kick his ass yet
...
how long are those admins gonna take?
_grinds teeth_
DID WE BEAT UP SOIGUESS YET
got it
okay then.
we can make a list of good symphogear related artists and fic material and stuff which are better contributions to the community
its not a matter of personal taste, its a matter of consistency
it is easier to stunt them and give them absolutely nothing
yes but if you give them more motivation to host the invite on their site and push for more advertising, you risk the opposite happening where /they/ come up first
<@285555416056856576> whats your input on all this
i feel this solution is paperthin and will lead to lots of strife with little gain, but alright.
_rubs temples_
added obstacle notwithstanding you havent done what you wanted to do
except youll still be advertising for them
and what will you do when he comes to you and says "okay, add it into the sidebar"
so what is stopping the scenario of, say, firebingo hosting the discord invitation on his site and then calling his site a symphogear community under your logic
which means it also shouldnt be linked.
except you're relying on a semantic definition of the word 'community' to weasel your way out of properly answering the question. what makes the discord less of a community than /sgg/? by that logic, the subreddit discord also isnt a community.
consistency in your argument. from the moment you've made this community, the grounds of you making this community is explicitly because you wanted a place where the rules of the subreddit are conrguent with the rules of the discord. now, you want to remove the discord link because you dont support the discourse there. how can you say that you dont approve of what something is doing, but preserve the link of another place that does it harder?
that doesnt make what im saying any less relevant.
nope, and only once out of curiosity through that link
doesnt matter. you've got em linked, that means you, on some level, approve of them sufficiently to have them there.
theyre in the header so yes.
you are telling me with a straight face that you are preserving /sgg/, a 4chan thread with infinitely more distilled shittiness, due to jurisdiction and the fact that they arent a discord community, while explicitly ignoring the principle of why you want to remove the valkyrie server, which is innately contradicting yourself. when you say, "and because we do not want to endorse the kind of discourse that goes down on that server", while still endorsing /sgg/, location where similar, if not ***worse*** discourse happens, you are essentially blatantly lying.
but you havent answered my question
for now, until they decide to go advertise some other place, which i already pointed out is a possibility
okay, so what is stopping the valkryie server from being linked in the header
no, but its in the header. unless, jurisdictionally, you're saying the header and the sidebar are two different things.
for the same reasons
then, by that logic, you would want to remove /sgg/ as well
then what is stopping them from saying, "okay, so why did you remove our link to begin with?"
also do we really want to push them to make themselves more active than us
that would imply the subreddit discord isnt symphogear, and shouldnt be on the sidebar at all due to it not being symphogear related
for the valkryie server? yes, if the point is to stop them from advertising
the problem here is that it doesnt address advertising symphogear communities, because... theyre symphogear communities
so yeah, there it is.
the creation of future communities seems unlikely given the only others that remain are purely japanese communities, which is hard to reach out for obvious reasons.
removing /sgg/ isnt an issue because theyll continue to exist by themselves and they already have a split opinion about this place anyway.
an ironclad rule that basically says "no" is preferable, in my opinion, than letting them do it on the subreddit and then deleting it afterwards after a given amount of weeks, because its counterintuitive of our goal to just stop them from advertising there and has no solid rule backing that isnt just a flat no.
focusing their advertising vector to /sgg/ and grassroots attempts will wear them out. zoid's blog is on ice until new symphogear episodes come out, which will be... a long, long while
symphogear has too small a following for such grassroots recruitment to work, and i know through experience that people, when left to their own devices on recruiting their own friends, typically recruit shitheads.
additionally, it allows enough social leeway for the valkryie server to slowly erode itself, since my biggest prediction is that when they get cut off from us, they will proceed to either: advertise in the subreddit (which we dont want), advertise in /sgg/ (which is ideal), and advertise on bingo's own site (the only only other place there is anything at all). it is likely they may also contact zoid and ask them to put a discord invite on his blog or twitter, or attempt to get others to reach out through grassroots advertisement amongst themselves.
my initial rule was to establish a position of not sponsoring third party communities. since the only ones that exist are /sgg/ (4channer shithole) and the valkryie server (psuedo 4channer shithole), it would be an excellent catch-all with enough rhetoric to enforce given that this community was founded on the precedent of having a discord community that fit the ruleset of the subreddit, something neither /sgg/ or the valkyrie server follow.
Pfffft
i wonder if theres a way i can show you the progress thus far
`minimalism would be gutting them all`
if thats the case then there's no point in removing either the valkryie server or sgg
okay, fine, i will make it more explicit. "no links to third party fan communities"
third party groups, not links
oh okay
i mean yeah but id rather not bother lyssa when she is busy with infinitely more important things that arent dumb internet community politics
i think lyssa is still busy with work because i pinged her before and she didnt say anything so we might as well wait.
it is the cleanest, hardest catchall to resolve all this and will provide the maximum amount of leeway for us to do things without having to deal with them
i am still very much for just going "no third party groups linked here" and calling it a day
its not hard to predict how theyll react
thats a shame but if its a real problem for them they take it up with a judge
what was the score
<@285555416056856576> since alice will be busy do you have any input on this, since youve been sorta quiet
kk
...so what ideas do you have
okay
which is a thousand times shadier
2. delete threads quietly after long periods of time behind people's back
1. delete posts quietly behind people's back
the issue i have is that you have a problem with doing it because its shady (its really not), but your alternative is:
its why i also went the "just cut them all out" suggestion, since /sgg/ is essentially identical if not worse
well, from what ive been operating on the assumption of, i thought this was gaining traction for the sake of cutting off communities that are usually toxic and arent lgbt friendly, since i presumed one of the fundamental reasons that this server was made was because the folks over there had a variety of issues that made other members deeply uncomfortable
because it is best to maximize getting rid of them in every form and reap the most benefit for us then make a rule that slightly placates them
theyre going to throw a fit regardless
nekekur is still valid for example because she is just one person
otherwise we'd have to cut off... the whole of tumblr and anything else, really
also its "no third party groups" not websites
there are so many communities that have that rule
its not a matter of disguise
there's a wealth of artists and writers who can easily fill that space and more and even work with the restructuring aim of "collaborating with communities" to "just having people do their thing"
in fact we can even make it an event
And bury them
If they can't be deleted the next best thing is to hide them as much as possible
That too
And get folks to pitch in their fics and stuff on their own page
That is community works
We can add another tab
Out of sight out of mind
Instead of as their own tabs
You click other communities and they're in there
No no, as in like
Wait
Oh
Put both sgg and valkryie under other communities
also yeah giving the place a new look would be nice
my stance is unyielding but i will defer to whatever you want to do, even if it is begrudgingly
as for 1 ask alice because that is what she has told me is a thing
strip it all, make it law, kick em out.
but if something is to devolve to that point regardless (which it will, because they are dumb anime nerds who will get butthurt that their big shiny invite link is suddenly not there, and joining amounts have suddenly declined like a closed tap), then its best just to start from there
that will be useful
id rather just hammer it in hard and when people come a 'knockin, point them to the rules, and if they argue it, we shut them up.
no but itll likely be public in the subreddit and it would be more preventing drama than worrying about hostility
by then itll be reactionary and itll make them more hostile. itd be easier to make it one swift blow.
and if theyre gonna get angry id rather dump em all and call it a day.
its etched in their subculture.
they will be. theyll be upset and anything that disturbs the norm, because thats what they are. dumb anime nerds with vaguely conservative beliefs who are easy to anger when literally anything challenges how they think.
its all gotta go.
giving them any sort of condolensce, space, or breathing room will only give them space to retaliate or find ways to wiggle themselves in
because that is what people do when they are feeling angry and spiteful
its also why i keep pushing this repeatedly; i dont want to give them space to complain about this. i dont want to give them an ***inch*** to even ***breathe*** this, because i know any and all space given to them will be used in an underhanded manner
because as alice has hammered a thousand times, this is their only current leyline
it is still inherently unfair to associate something with a given community and not give the staff who wanted to affiliate it more hands-on involvement and it only speaks for themselves the level of disorganization they are operating on; moreover, if they couldn't recognize this blatant flaw themselves and lashed out at you guys for it, it only foreshadows their reaction towards messing with anything that gets them a userbase
it would be a dumb argument because it was a subreddit server and it makes literally 0 sense to leave out subreddit staff out of something with the name of the subreddit theyre running on it
now imagine that culminated stupidity and anger when that actually does happen
all this nuance has told me is that their lack of communication spurned this, and that it was well deserved but they were still too stupid and incompetent to recognize it and got angry regardless
which was pretty stupid
so empirically, if thats their reaction simply from making another server...
well from what i remember, you explicitly talked about how they lashed out at you and essentially called what you did a mutiny for having the audacity to distance yourself from them
and more importantly, why would we even want to
after this we probably never will
we havent done anything with them for eons
3. the likelihood of any collaboration will be the same before as it was after: 0.
2. the reaction regarding any of this will likely be hostile regardless of how we approach it
1. their style of moderation and members are not only inherently poor to an extent where yall had to dissassociate from them, but also had to sprung up the means of figuring out how to properly cut them off from continuing to sap away members
well, let's review:
but i am outnumbered in my opinion, so whatever.
i feel this direction is going to end badly and will arise needless ways for the other server to try and test and weasel their way back in somehow needlessly instead of just cutting them off for good, alongside net minimal benefits for us

on the plus side ive finished my first lab and damn is it sexy
so now i am in a special hell where my wires cross and i am legitimately worried i will hand in an assignment in C# to a professor who isnt teaching it and vice versa
but one focuses purely on C# and is about software developement in general, and the other focuses on purely on Visual Basic's own language, while also being about software development within Windows
im taking two programming classing that both focus on software development, that both use visual basic
you see, in my usual self-destructive fashion, ive set myself up for pain in a very special way, because i hate myself
meanwhile i torture myself with visual basic
i will keep this in mind.
i see
maybe during the summer i will sit the fuck down and binge all the jojo animes
i need to watch the anime
ZONATHAN ZOESTAR
mmmmm
they did it with guides and stuff
yeah but the links link to pages within the subreddit
r/ptcgo
other subreddits do this a lot like ptcgo
so regardless, putting those things on a seperate page is a good divider to establishing that context
things that are subreddit related should be easily visible within the subreddit; things that are related shouldnt
well its [R] which should clear it up but okay
can't trust people. folks like cheap thrills and throw them away. its the same everywhere ive gone. whether months, or years, it's all the damn same.
i dont really believe a word any of them say.
i dont really believe a word he says
firebingo says my leave hasnt gone unnoticed, and that every other day someone brings up the fact that i left
and so i left. bitter, depressed, and generally not wanting to see 'em again.
folks grew more toxic. more unfun. got to a point where i didnt even bother talking anymore.
so many little things just bundling atop each other.
i make a deck of card for cards against humanity for symphogear. try showing it off there. no dice or momentum. nobody cared.
"they weren't highlighted in red", he says
why?
wanting to get involved with community stuff only to get snuffed out. i made a fucking slew of entires for the symphogames chris hosts, and he remarked they were good! but he used none of them.
then engaging in arguments with idiots like xaxas who are essentially manchildren raised squarely on anime who are deeply pretentious and basically devolving every other day to shouting matches about how shit was stupid
slowly but surely, my enthusiasm and joy just slowly being crushed.
but i should have known better.
even though people would praise me, sing songs about me, say "man that guy is hilarious!"
rules being bent for me on basically favoritism left a bad taste in my mouth and made me feel guilty for engaging in it, and people who would see what i was doing and basically ignored it because they felt i was a nuisance, and i felt that sentiment only grew more and more
make a shitposting channel, id say, but alas, it was largely ignored.
"we've gotten some complaints"
"its a bit much at the moment"
my penchant for horsing around slowly getting reeled back when i would get tapped on the shoulder by moderation privately and be told "yeah, you gotta tone it down"
my goodwill towards making images for them devolving into them dumping it on me (the last time firebingo contacted me about making images for them it was less of a request and more "hey can you do this? thanks" and just dumping it on my lap without even really asking like if it was a fucking workplace)
it was a slow and gradual disenthusiasm for the place. i used to really like that place. cracked a lot of jokes. made a lot of people laugh. but deep down in the back of my head i knew, in my heart of hearts, that it was all fleeting. one by one, the signs would crop up. getting into arguments about lgbt stuff and seeing people who ***actively consume yuri as a genre*** straight up say "oh yeah but that doesnt happen in real life"
its a lot of little things that bundled up.
i guess its complicated to lay out.
i...
this has been nothing new since the beginning. in fact, one of the main motivators of knocking out soiguess was explicitly to make sure they couldnt contact, bitch at him, and knock you guys out. i said that from the very beginning
because theyre terrible and we shouldnt have them around.
the same reason you encouraged me to
`which can gladly be done to bury the valkryie server`
which means they should be seperate pages
as far away as possible...
and keep them
are you sure they cant just be links to another page
Thanks autocorrect
*literally
Squares n stuff
Obviously not to like, pretty levels, but more just the general layout
I'm talking literature drawing the whole subreddit page and appearance
No, the mockup and drawings need to be much bigger, and much much more thorough
But it needs to be a process where we draw it out physically and model it with a mockup first before we really do it
I can do this in my spare time after math and it'll keep my CSS stuff sharp at least
Yes
Lyssa is a forbidden seal whose true talents I can't begin to comprehend for fear of melting my face off
except it jumps to nothing because there is no property set for it.
its the same concept
like how hyperlinks change color when you click them
since we're treating the image as a hyperlink object, we dont have anything set as to what would display after our browser registers the link as having been already clicked.
this is so stupid. i hate this so much
i think i know what it is.
fuck
oh my god.
maybe it hiccups with self-linking within the- ohhhh my god
okay that is weird
...
and then when you tried to change it more it was mismatched and didnt show up
it was existing with an old link when you were fiddling with it
okay, i think i know what the problem was
it works now
otherwise it wont show up.
you have to do it in the css and in the place where you edit the sidebar contents
did you change the link in the css
oh
`what`
and make it as simple and clean as possible
and clean out all the baloney that is fucking up everything
and im going to make a reddit skin for this sub from scratch
im going to sit my ass down
one of these days
`why`
and sometimes it does not
sometimes it works fine
it was working fine before too
whaaaat the fuuuuck
wait im seeing it now
wait
it... doesnt happen with me
???
Emoji
making a mental note to make a pinned resource thread for all the xdu translated comics since one doesnt exist
_pops in_
so, if we were to deal with serizawa, we would have to keep this rule in mind as well
this is your rule regarding the fancontent channel
```Concerning headcanons: headcanons need not align with actual canon. Do not argue with people over their own personal headcanons, if someone is gushing about Chris and Maria being married and you don't like it, take a break from the channel rather than call them out on it.```
something else to note is this:
the offense being: serizawa isnt listening to anyone, and keeps pushing something people have either tried to give feedback on only to be ignored, or just plain dont like.
serizawa's content isnt the offender, its the means towards the offense.
inherently, if someone is being a nuisance, then the matter at hand isnt about serizawa's content. its about serizawa themselves. people have repeatedly given feedback and he's sorta completely ignored what theyve said to opt towards what i could honestly only describe as a hideous piece of garbage
of course, there is one other detail
in serizawas case... i would not pursue him over what he makes. itll make for a bad compass to aim towards.
hanlon's razor is annoying because in a good community you want to give people the benefit of the doubt `unless they're hideously anti-social and espouse things that undermine the core of a community, like neo nazis and other garbage`
which is counter-intuitive to developing a tolerant, healthy community
gatekeeping quality in a place were users share work on a micro level gets fickle, because you risk fostering a more hostile community since in the scenario of kicking serizawa out, you would be establishing an example of "if someone's work sucks enough, and people dont like it, they get the boot"
i dont have a positive opinion on serizawa but they dont strike me as malicious, just extremely stupid
yeah
idiocy isnt against the rules
its a tough rope to walk
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
and the wild wild world of `Serialization...`
now my second lab is dealing with xml
slick as hell and fully functional

the assignment is for a simple form thing since the professor wants us to get acquianted with C#
though this is c#
`behold, the future`
ill take a look at r/hearthstone
never knew.
huh
...moon mode?
they dont have images as links
i hate this
mind: broken
fucking...
still happens.
nothing
im not changing it in the other end.
im an idiot
wait
it dissappears
i modified the hyperlink in tsubasa's from nt to www and when you click it and go to that page (takes you to the wiki's index with nt in front)
the fucking wildest thing
this is like
this is genuinely wild
okay
_rips hair out_
disable res a moment and click the tsubasa one
do me a favor
*alice
akuce
wait
also thatd be cute
`Convince people Symphogear was cancelled...`
honestly if i really wanted to fuck with people id do what i did again last year on a really big scale
if not a bit spammy
thatd be funny
ooooh
it couldnt be
no.
wait.
or... hmmm...
grooooaaaannnnn
it didnt work.
and topping that off...
yes.... and that should mean... a little bit more...
come on...
little bit more...
and let's just...
i see.
let's try that again.
that is bad.
no, give me a moment
i found a solution.
alright
let me see if i cant...
the weird part is i dont really understand why we cant just hyperlink images inside the sidebar
`it all went green`
so
...
but right now, no
id have to look up the clicked property
thats what i was pointing out
no, because you're going to another page
literally any subreddit link
set it with other communities and see what happens
yeah.
also on a real note lets make her a chatbot
WHAT
what
in the summer i will definitely make a skin from scratch
for now id avoid further edits and focus on fleshing out the wiki sections for stuff and making them presentable and doing the event thats planned
to note: since we're gonna shove the keywords into its own thing we can eat the keyword links on the sidebar
though in the summer i plan to incinerate this skin in favor of a new, simpler one from scratch
this will make life much easier
thank the lord
yay
`i wish i knew this existed sooner`
holy shit
`d-did you see my buttons lyssa-sempai`
i-i hope lyssa-sempai likes my buttons, baka
`more like a nuke`
must be a combination of things
i had experimented with that as well and nothing happened
interesting
`tell me everything`
what did you remove
...and you added padding and margin
you got rid of the content
okay
what
wh
`lyssa when you can help us`
_slowly looks at lyssa_
when all else fails...
this is really annoying
yeah
nothing has worked
dicking around with how its set up
dicking around with the method itself
in which case i tried manually setting it as a background as opposed to relying on the content tag
unless you mean before that
i stopped to take a break.
nothing
im going to do this in the summer
and make a new one from scratch
i want to incinerate this skin
but then
is it because of a click event?
so...
...
yeah
yeah its just dragging the link out
?????
whatcha do
oh?
since tomorrow i need to do math homework
because i wanna do some rtt updates to queue up
i will take a break and let you take a knack at it
`and it doesnt work.`
because ive tried that multiple times
do you think its that they have it set as a background instead of using content
what
in fact, if you really wanted to bait them, you'd do it with work already done
consider: if every response is we go forward with a wiki, then they are irrelevant for creating it
if you want to run the risk of asking them and genuinely, deeply expect any response outside of "if it aint broke dont fix it" or "go fuck yourself you digital imperialist bastard" then by all means, go for it.
if you havent noticed, the community we have is pretty averse to people outside the main 3 discords. they already dont like the fanon wiki, and seeing a place affiliated with them would already raise deep red flags
yes, except the grander goal here isnt just for them to do our work; its to do our work, in our name, while getting /our/ community also involved
of course the other point of that is they could probably just say "fuck it" and make their own domain
http://symphogear.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page
(trick question i already did it in june)
someone would have to have done so.
it would already have to be registered in shoutwiki.
i mean, if you ask them, you also run the risk of potentially convincing them to go "oh, good point!" and then they just do it themselves instead of doing it under our banner
like, how long has this series existed
dont you think that, with the vast amount of wikia alternatives, if they really wanted to do it, they would have done it by now?
alice
unless theyre idiots and go "sure!", which i supremely doubt, they would likely rather freeze over in hell than ever surrender a project that is theirs
and there is no way to change it.
regardless of how you word it, this will be the root nature of the question
"hello, i see you've worked pretty hard on this wiki. do you mind if you transfer all your effort to us to a site you wont be able to own in name and also enforce stricter rules that will be given to you to clean up the information you've worked on for the past several years, theoretically losing most of the creative control of doing stuff in the process?"
i can guarantee it, because it is an inherently skewed thing to ask of them
they wont
they are. but there's a key difference here, and its that since the project is more broad and touches upon something our community never shuts up about, youll happily see more people throw their part into it
nobody would waste their time sinking in effort to provide data on a dying game outside of the bare bones "this is how you play, these are events" that are already managed through word of mouth
and xdu as a game is... failing. its boring. its dull.
xdu's issue also revolved around a heavy effort of translating things
the owner was a lazy bag of bones who hosted everything but failed to put in the most basic of plugins every wiki has (which shoutwiki already /comes with/)
yes, but you also seem to be forgetting the circumstances around why it failed to be maintained
but judging from how people talk, public opinion of it is "we dont really like it outside of it hosting all the songs as an easy reference"
it would be interesting to gauge their opinions on the wikia
we've got a discord's worth of people that contradicts this
```- No contributors, effort put into something no one uses```
what
```- Potential community split, making the fanbase even more splintered```
<@!127644949884698624> here ya go
```The Clearer, Concise Version of The Issues:

- Wikia is a bad, bloated, horrible platform riddled with problems, stigma, and unprofessionalism masquerading as a valid wiki platform.
- The people contributing to the wikia are bad at what they do outside of copy/pasting plot synopsis and keywords.
- The established article and organization system of that specific wikia is vague and muddied at worst and hard to navigate and digest at best, with poor visual design.
- The work going into collaborating and fixing their issues is outweighed by the work of making our own, with people we already know and resources we have at hand already.
- The goal our the subreddit/discord is to work with our own standards, which was the founding point of making the discord to begin with. Working with them on this is counterintuitive to this goal.```
here are my points why
alice is curious about why we shouldnt work with the existing symphogear wikia people to begin with
2. something to help refresh themselves for the next season
1. something to do
which gives them:
ive proposed to alice that one of our Big Projects(tm) over the course of the hiatus is to work on a /proper/ wiki for the community, collaborated with the community
okay
_comes out, scans ID against the building's scanner, goes in_
_parks his car_
_drives his car here_
yeah thats true
ive been learning that a bit in my college class, but at a baby level
ooooh, cool
whats the project?
im glad to see you alive though lyssa
this is true
i see
i just worry whatever i do could `destroy everything, forever`
ive always wanted to learn snek
i wish there was a way i could help code for the bot so i can learn how to program for discord bots
yay
you're gay, made by people who are gay, representing a character who is very gay, in an extremely gay show
dont lie ryouko
`ryouko wouldnt mind you visiting her backdoor`
oh
you will never get them to come here until that changes, and it wont happen because this particular person is inherently incompatible with this server.
someone who also happens to not only provide the main source of translations for current events, but also actively decompiles and provides content to the channel.
one of the main remaining presences of the xdu channel is someone who refuses to step foot into this server.
and its a fairly obvious one
there is one problem with this
goddamn.
the princess principal subreddit is also deadish
_squints_
perfect
`this one will be a piece of cake`

i join their discord
also, good news
noted
also recognize anybody in the staff section for yuyuyu's subreddit?
noted
yuyuyu meanwhile is roughly our size
https://www.reddit.com/r/YuYuYu/
the only moderator is the founder, and they havent been seen for nearly a year.
so the nanoha subreddit is dead.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanoha/
interesting...
i will keep this in mind...
interesting
give me more animes similar to symphogear in the meanwuile side from nanoha and yuyuyu
i will begin analysis of the subreddits and do so
noted
we should devise a list and pay them visits
excellent
places with untapped niche audiences means more visibility, and more space
we could, though id ideally like ones without one
staking out shows with similar styles, themes, `and gayness` to symphogear, finding their subreddits, `making sure soiguess doesnt run them`, and then tapping their shoulders saying "hey we'll cross-promote each other"
and vice versa
one of the other ideas i had is, much like what the wikia does, we should visit the subreddits of similar shows to symphogear in order to create a network of sorts where we can sponsor ourselves as a choice for people looking for similar content
if the wiki idea is to be laid on ice, then i will not only do this, but also shift our focus to something else we need to do
fine
egggggghhhhhh...
i hate it, but also you are right.
but id ideally like to work with the momentum we have now so we can execute and keep people doing things instead of putting this idea on ice for god knows how long
yeah but lyssa just said it aint
i wont.
fine. if i must, ill get everyone on board with this
groan.
a move implies we're salvaging wikia content though
i was going to rely on shoutwiki which is honestly the best free wiki platform currently
no need
```In any case, I doubt I would be able to contribute infrastructure-wise; assuming there's a platform that's featured to what we'd want that's on a technology stack I'd touch, I don't have a lot of free cycles at the moment and there's higher priority server maintenance I need to do.```
...where was it all previously hosted?
wait, what
```Granted, the case where I've been peripherally involved with that was an unplanned migration to wikia```
`and i can assure you it wont be hard to make something better than this with a much more involved community`
so i feel the risk of "we anger people" is mitigated by "even if this group of people, worst case scenario, despises us, we can still gain traction simply by providing the quality of what we do with our own wiki"
there's no real group collaboration outside of reporting to the mod and it seems very dertimental to try and collaborate with a community that doesnt really have it together when there's more benefit to do it on our own
the contributors of the wikia seem to be low in number and some are people i can speak with and collaborate with directly; however, the wikia is... bad. its bad. like, i didnt think it was even /too/ bad until i stumbled upon user profiles and pretty much looked at how they did things and it basically chalked up to "people calling shots randomly without any real fact checking that goes unwatched until someone who is active notes it and tells a mod"
```So, if you're looking at this from a community perspective, keep in mind that a wiki fork, even if it doesn't lok like it's being done with hostile intent, can be a good way to piss people off!```
Okay
wiki nerds suck. anime nerds suck. you mix em, you get a bigger asshole.
i am just saying you are completely wasting your time with this, and i have little to no prospect with them. it comes with the territory of arrogant, dumb anime nerds.
i am absolutely not stopping you
and /show/ the quality of what is already made
but i feel if there is someone who can also help work on it, who has much more free time on their hands, and reward that initiative within our community
since outside of what the bot does, everything else we planned on doing... hasnt happened. which is understandable, since you're extremely busy
its mostly because i saw sakimori is really into making discord bots and it would help levy away that responsibility to give you some space with everything else youve got going on in life right now
true
we should recruit them for discord bot things.
sakimori seems like a talented individual with a lot of time on their hands
i know, and noted.
with it, that wont be a problem
we have a firm ruleset i can follow
ive familiarized myself enough with this place to understand it and folks like me (i think) so i think it would go over fine
ill have lots of free time during the summer
but only if you feel comfortable with that
if you want i can take up the helm
`All according to plan.`

this is fun
the windows 10 monika wallpaper i made eons ago
this is funny.
eroding people away AND seeing my own art get reposted
hee hee hee
everythings in a swirl and theyll forget this a day from now
plus nobody cares
yeah but im busy being monika chaos agent
"casual reminder the subreddit discord is a good place to hide out if you dont like this"
like ah
something sardonic
(this is important while everyone is annoyed)
make sure to tell them directly that the subreddit discord hasnt dissolved into this mess
when there's maximum dissent
now is good
now
instead... remind people that such chaos ISNT happening in the subreddit discord
i reccomend just doing nothing
nah and nah
KUKUKUKUKU...~
afufufufufu~
why do you think im contributing?
yep
i cant think of an elaborate one on such short notice
i am crossed between saying that xdu is going to close in half a year, and saying that kaneko is dead
im thinking of what to do for april fools tomorrow
she's australian so i gotta wait for australian time
ill do that when she wakes up today
thats just... bad.
ive pointed out in the past that xdu has a lot of flaws and sometimes i poke fun with `Wait... people /still/ play XDU?` in the other server when xdu stuff comes up but i didnt know there were people that actively go "you suck for playing xdu"
nobody shames xdu players at all (i didnt even know it was a thing)
yeah pretty much
yeah
there is a solution somewhere. but right now the bigger question is: is it worth pursuing that solution at all?
its hard, is the thing
not... exactly
and thats it.
they come. they nod at the community, they stay quiet. play game. talk when they need info.
and these people are inherently different from, say, very shy folks who are worried about sharing their stuff, because they are asocial by nature
which are an immensely tiny handful that are very difficult to fish out because these would be the very same people who idle everywhere else actively and ignore everything else
so the people we'd end up trying to focus on to interact with the rest of the community, are people who have no interest in participating in the rest of the community and just want to play the game
the people who play xdu are people who are already, on paper on /some/ level, interacting with the rest of the community. there's no escape from this. as isolated as xdu is, if you look at both servers, you'll see that the bulk of the xdu players are also people who already talk in other places in the first place. it just feels isolated because of the fact that theyre playing a specific game with mobile game terms.
watch show -> meet and know community -> play game (if you're into those games)
so the process of getting "indoctrinated" into playing xdu is:
because, thinking about this, i realized that in order to play the game, you already need to be well-acquianted with the show and in turn, the community
so musing about this heres the crux of the issue of appealing to the folks that play the xdu game; i feel it boils down to the audience we would end up trying to cater to
yeah that works
feel free to move the thread down and unpin it.
both
_scratches chin..._
to be honest, xdu is a downhill slope. i wouldn't be surprised if the game died out in like, a little less than a year, at least on the western front
i suppose
the rest... may be hard to cater to, since they seem more interested in the game than anything else
i mean... most of the people on /this/ server that play xdu are already highly interactive with this place for the most part
***SO, AS I EDIT...***
`Yet those hands will never create anything original...`
HAVE WITHSTOOD TIME TO CREATE MANY EDITS
***NOR TO OBSCURITY***
***UNKNOWN TO COMEDY***
`I HAVE CREATED A THOUSAND SHITPOSTS`
`Wide is my pallete and many are my layers...`
`I am the stroke of my brush...`
it is done.
the moment the semester ends
pin it
but its time we really hit hard.
golden hibiki is nice, and will always live in our hearts
one we can use for there and for the discord
honestly ill probably make a right and proper small subreddit logo
yeah that needs fixing

oh nice, the flairs carried over
ill let you choose alice
the first emoji.
who will be
filesize limited to 64kb
`SHITPOST CHAKRAS ARE BLITZING ALICE`

`MY HAND IS ON THE TRIGGER ALICE`

we can have emojis
alice

this is what i mean by a lot of what the css does being removed from it
yes you can
https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/about/traffic
this has a traffic monitor
oh
feel free to set the upvote/downvote sprites we have for the new design
_slow grin_

widgets...
new
how do i access editing things again
the writing on the wall here seems to scream "we are vastly reducing css interaction with these new features"
and thats if the oncoming css changes lets you
nope
see i think that, but think about what the css does currently
what will css do
which leads to the big question
all the options have been cut and cornered to their own options to standardize many things
but yeah
`I will unleash myself upon this wretched menu...`
once thats done...
for now im not touching a single thing until `The Hell Phase` is over
my last final is in thursday
not until the semester is over
So yeah whattaya think
he'll also make a good buddy for future css fuckery
gives ryoko shiny new functions
gives him the freedom to implement stuff
gives the community a nice toy to play with to boot
pipes them to us when theyre fully functional
he makes them
which he has, a kirikabot
sakimori brings in a protobot to test scripts with on his own end
my thought is the following
itd be pretty swell for a variety of reasons
thats number one, above literally everything else i have to tell you.
first of all, you need to give me the ability to kick people. i dont have it. this literally wouldve been resolved earlier if i had it, alongside ban functions. its a bit ridiculous that im penned down as a moderator and dont have these abilities.
<@!127644949884698624>
we seriously need to have a talk, alice
The literal only reason I haven't kicked them is that I do not have the power to.
<@!127644949884698624> You are seriously wasting your time. Kick them.
get rid of them.
you are literally wasting your time humoring them
there is literally no point in humoring this
kick em
okay doke.
ill keep that in mind
alright.
it was less creating a rule and more just announcing something that wasnt completely set in stone for the sake of moving something somewhere that seemed more congruent
and its not a discussion in of itself, so...
yeah but this is less spontaneous and more "someone who may or may not have a second account actively making a complex scenario", and there was no real discussion before this
since most of the rp isnt real rp and mostly just complex injokes itd make sense to dump it in there, as its basically just sophisticated shitposting
shitposting is the most congruent channel for it
as most of the rp isnt so much real rp as it is just extending complex injokes between people within the community
i do not think we should make a full rp channel
need some water
do you uh
....you okay there ryoko san
are you okay ryoko
???

i just want to get the ball rolling encouraging people within the community to do more for this place and giving them the means to do so while solving some of our own progressional obstacles
i cant tell either
`also what do you feel about the thing i said above`
true
maybe it was the channel order being rearranged?
i dont... think so
uhhhhhhh... not really, no
yeah alice did it
_slaps around ryouko a bit with a large trout_
and if the problem is "you're very busy due to real life things", and there is someone who can also do this thing, it can help deal with two birds with one stone
we've sorta had this bot for a while now and we came together to think up a bunch of features for it only for it to... not happen, outside of join and leave logs
we would have to ask them, but the motivation lies more in me not being familiar (and probably not being familiar with it for a long while) and you being very busy; while i know its not an immediate process of "yeah theyre here now just do it", it would be pretty helpful and not only pave understanding between everyone here who doesn't know how to work with bots, but also have someone of some quite notable talent on our side for other things besides the bot
which is why i want your input on that and potentially `More...` in the future
but once finals are over... `I'm going full throttle.`
i have been busy dying due to finals
alice has been hearthstone grinding
take your time though
`but i would really want to hear your thoughts on this`
thats okay
there's some good and some that are worrisome
the changes are... ehh...
yep

So yeah whattaya think```
also
***UNLIMITED STROKE WORKS***
we're using that psa and then pinning below it that those two words are considered slurs?
so to be clear
sure
it is more restricting to tell people what to do, then what not to do
by saying "do not use that word", you are basically opening the gates to encourage people to use equally bad words, and they WILL test the waters
yeah, but there's another problem, and its the other side of that coin
mmmmmmm.
you feel it might be that way because of the way the community has conditioned them to believe otherwise
its particularly inescapable.
then why would you assume the trans populace in this community, who would need to be involved in its culture, wouldnt be vaguely aware of at least the discourse surrounding this word given they are of said minority
would you consider yourself a person who enjoys anime and manga and is at least involved in its culture to some extent
would you consider yourself a person who would have an issue with the word
thats the principle of why i phrased it that way
the point isnt to say, "you shouldnt say all the bad words/slurs you know", the point is "if you feel there's someone in here it could hurt, dont use it"
there are, but thats not the point of why i phrased it that way
```there are a lot of potentially offensive words or phrases that AREN'T "stop this now" material```
remind me again why wien isnt banned when hes literally running around saying "NAZI DISCORD NAZI DISCORD"
```PSA for the community: Remember that Rule 1 is one of the most principle rules here, and always use your common sense. Make sure to ask yourself, "Is what I'm about to say potentially offensive to somene, including myself?" If so, please use your better judgement, and don't say it. Likewise, if you find someone says something offensive that hasn't been acknowledged, always know the mods are here to listen and make sure its handled. Thanks for reading!```
ill write it up and show you it. its not a big thing
OHHHHH MY GOD
`PRAY THAT YOU DO NOT REFUSE THE CONVERSATION LIGHTLY`
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIGX6q2o1aM&t=153s
...
im aware.
i reward learning lessons, not stupidity.
if theyre not smart enough to find the link again then theyre on their own. im not going to be nice to people who break rules unless they show genuine remorse.
no.
i doubt there will be any jackasses coming in besides potentially rukia, and my current prediction is that they will come back eventually and apologize, or simply not come back at all due to pride.
alright.
i will admit i was raised with IRC culture where kicks are pretty much simple warnings but even here a kick isnt big when theres a public link back
that is the point im getting at here.
and what better way than to kick them.
yes
and hot button topics
with loaded questions
this is you, being drawn out to respond to someone, whose response to breaking the rules is further debate
this is not a point of debate
this is sorta exactly the reason why he should have been kicked earlier
```Alright, so the issue I'm having is that my initial explanation on why femboy is okay and shemale is not is that I wasn't terribly descriptive,```
alright.
noted. take your time. im going to make an announcement now thats a brief psa about slurs, which helps smooth things over and remind the community to use their damn brains.
especially when my whole point in being in this position is to enforce rules.
make sure to at least give me ***at minimum*** the ability to kick. im fine with not being able to ban, if you want to keep it that way, but its a bit ridiculous that i dont have the basic power of enforcing the rules when the rules are broken, especially since there's only three of us here, and of those three, im usually the most active.
you dont usually see this side of me because nothing really happens here but when things like that happen i seriously do not fuck around.
im sorry if im being a bit rough. but that is how moderating rolls.
good.
that was someone who had to go.
that was not genuine. that was someone trying to walk the rope of the rules.
the moment he literally decided to ***debate the nature of slurs with the n word*** was the moment he had to go.
and yes, i know i do. but this was not one of those moments
this will be a bit mean for me to say, but i dont really care whether you agree or not. this is not advice from one small moderator to another admin. this is me, weighing in with my ***several years of moderating*** experience here. do you want to know why i am getting on your ass about this? its because i have literally ***lived through those mistakes.*** this is not a matter of debate. this is me, warning you, of what will happen if you dont do those two pieces of advice i just told you.
***You cannot delete things that readily.***
this is no different. this moderating style has not changed. its simply on a new cloud based medium where EVERYTHING is the logs.
back in my irc days we literally lived gospel to our IRC logs for a good reason. literally any bullshit that could be made up from them was easily shot down looking at the archival responses that went on, and pieced together how much of an idiot someone is
because these imbeciles LIVE for calling out censorship
additionally, you need to ***stop deleting things.***. ive said this before, briefly, but this bears repeating again for emphasis. deletion is not good. it works in more casual places like heiroglyphs because there's nothing to be lost or the offending picture. but if you delete pieces of log of conversation when someone is refering to them, it is going to bite you in the ass. ***Hard.***
***Don't waste your time talking and kick them next time.***
dragging it out runs the potential of making you lose face to your own community. its very likely that the inconsistencies rukia noted in your enforcement of the rules (a small, and not very worthwhile one) is going to be fodder to be spread around other communities. i would not give a shit about this and neither should you, but those things can add up over time.
you need to stop humoring people with arguments. they will get you nowhere. there is literally no point in entertaining these dumb diatribes; you knew something was being done in bad faith. do not bother wasting your time arguing things like this: folks like them when they act up get the boot. nothing more, nothing less.
secondly...
basically we give everyone a default role and then have self-assignable color roles delegated for people who are active. this not only minimizes the impact of things getting too colorful (only the active percentage of the community would go for this) and feeds to the demand of this (which has grown), but also gives us a decent statistic on how many active people are in the community as opposed to inactive users or lurker.
anyway
im... `ice creaming...`
one moment
ive got an idea we can do down the line that balances both
demand for it has increased, but ive kept what youve told me in mind
i have been musing on the role color stuff
if you want, though i highly suggest against it
its a weird curve.
people take personally being told to shut up better than moderator tools silencing them to the margin of it being used to temporarily remove them or ban them from the community.
but a community this small will not handle that well. i know this because ive seen it.
those tactics have only ever worked for extremely large channels, which i used to use during my IRC days
in my experience, it is.
id rather not do that.
ill think of a nicer way to phrase it in the future.
theyll think it regardless. but, alright then.
if they cant understand simple directions, then i will of course show them the door.
if someone, let alone a moderator says, "thats potentially pretty spoilery", the onus is not on them to decide otherwise. it /is/.
its not a matter of tradionalism, but of fucking common sense
the spoilers rule has existed forever. keeping spoilers away have existed forever.
its just stupid because its trying to debate a topic they know already exists, but also theyve defended HAVING in the first place.
alright
of course i will gladly wait as long as you need. this has just been a thing for a long while, and id just want a conclusion to it
its less having this conversation and more me poking you for a definitive answer on the conversation, because the conversation keeps going unfinished
```@Glitch Infel can you give a list of reasons that relying on a two bot solution for the server would be bad?```
_points up_
also
whichever you feel works
that explains why that happens occasionally
nice
I was gonna say if they did it's fine to list them just for the sake of morale
Ah, alright
Did they ask to be listed
*see
I ser
<@127644949884698624>
Aliiiiiiiice
How did this come up
Then there ya go
It doesn't need to be discerned but there's no harm in it showing up either
Mainly because it's a fun role
I have no strong feelings one way or another about this
Then there you go
That is a very abstract question left to our own designs
Yes
jeopardy theme intensifies
remember my advice: if they start being hostile, throw them out. no hesitation.
ive got to sleep in a bit. but, it seems rukia is back
its unlikely something will happen, but its wise to cover your bases.
just in case, keep an eye on the subreddit
oh, one more thing
again, you shouldve seen me like, 7 years ago. totally different person.
it has been a while since ive gone into raw moderator mode. i forgot how stressful that is.
also, again, im sorry i got a little bit mean.
hooray
_flexes infinity gauntlet_
got it.
no thats fine.
ill post that and pin it?
that works.
we'll make the bots channel when we carry over kirichan at that moment
ill probs be asleep by then so itll probably be tomorrow unless alice is still awake by then
okay doke
okay doke. but, still, the question stands: do you wanna drag Kirichan here now?
ah!
do you wanna drag dess bot here now and we make ya a bots channel
hella
<@!102691114762371072> you see this right
make yourself at home
welcome sakimori!
also ill do it now alice i havent pmed them yet
also its literally just one more person. and we need more staff since its literally just us.
a very slow gradual thing
many, many months
i am talking moving things from one bot to another in the process of like, /months/
explicitly because you are definitely lacking the spoons right now to do it
and as ive explained before, the point of that two bot system is less for teamwork and more just brief collaborating and transfering stuff from one bot to another, in a process that would ideally take much longer that allows for flexibility on your end
speak now or forever hold your silence 'cause im bracing to pm them
im going to go do that now.
do i have the green light on recruiting sakimori
didnt you just say you do this for fun
then that is that. i will recruit sakimori. naturally, this isnt me excluding you from this, and you are still not only able to give in your input but also always free to actively partake in whatever sakimori does, since you're really talented and a part of this group. but i still sorta firmly stand behind it being unfair to unload this all on you when you are constantly busy wrestling with way more important things, and it being unfair to us to wait a week to two weeks for responses constantly for something of this nature to execute when there are people active right now that can do it
alright.
heh, yeah, i know
and even then this isnt exactly a straight answer. im looking for a yes or no.
this has been sorta gathering dust for a couple months now and every time i go "here is an easier way of doing it wherein you dont need to sacrifice time doing this" i havent gotten a straight answer until now
i would gladly do this, but the emphasis is, well, doing it
```I kind of want to say let's get a list of functionality with priorities and just go through it```
_leans in_
alright
default role can be set up to be a good mod tool to punish people without kicking them
ohhhh
theyre actually pinned in this channel
also the plans arent a secret to you
what do you think, alice
thats actually not a bad idea
i just realized im the illuminati to your autoscorer
hella
perfect.
YES
`Kirichan Unleashed...`
ooooh! actually... sakimori... if you wanted to, with that picture, you can make a command when Kirichan is mad
feel free to use it for your own purposes
it didnt pan out, but the picture is still cool as hell
this was an old creation i had a long time ago for a subreddit skin

if you're looking to give Kirichan a new avatar for this place for the sake of maximizing `Bot Coolness...`
also...
got it
oh?
lemme dig up my cape pic- actually
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
`THE NEXT STEP IS CAPE`
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH SAKIMORI
...
an interesting challenge given that the bot will have to reverse-search every image that comes up
what else is on the to-do list
still, im impressed, you've done a lot with your first day alone
that is so interesting...
so it works by just pressing an emoji?
fascinating
is it possible for you to tabulate all the people who opt in to their own color roles
sakimori, question
she's been singing nonstop for half an hour.
she needed a break
we should probably raise the symphogear discussion category and its channels a bit higher
hella
ah, okay doke
music commands also probably should be public
since... it's not proliferated around publicly.
sure! but, it will help making the code also a command for easy recollection
i made it all single handedly and tested it with alice, but its never seen a lot of action
the deck spans everything from the 1st season to AXZ. no XDU jokes besides very few.
(calls are black cards)
this is how many questions and responses it has

also...
make a simple command that states the cardcastgame code for the symphogear deck is AWD7Q and it's used for https://pyx-3.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/game.jsp
alright
how easy would it be to provide a command that gives the code for using the deck in xyzzy? its literally just spewing some text casually
i still have the symphogear cards against humanity deck lying around
actually that reminds me
oh yeah
say the word and ill gladly design questions
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
also people love bots and kirichan is pretty flawless
and i dont want to make you host `Everything.` since that will be terrible. itll just be something in the backburner for now thats nice to think about being able to do
dont feel pressured to do it, this is really really low given the other stuff we gotta do
i see
but having it here with all the latest jams with the best quality?
the valkryie server already does this with firebingo's Noisebot
see, the idea was to have all the symphogear music available through command now that the albums all exist in one big zip
ah, hmmm
this is a local file you're playing, right?
wait, you already did what i was thinking about, technically
wait
hehehe
take your time
hella
sakimori gets to see the behind the scenes of `The Secret Symphogear Council`
dont push yourself saki, its not a big rush
bingo's noisebot is not different; he simply has his own personal hosting options since he hosts that website as well
mmmm, alright
mainly because with this boom we've got a shitload of channels and its gotten `very wide`
i also feel we should split music commands with role assignment and bot testing into a bot-command-list channel and a bot-playground channel to eat one channel
alice, how do you feel if i moved bot commands below general discussion
mmmmmm
its a super mario party style board game on intense amounts of cocaine
yep
for now? nothing. but itll be useful when im doing wiki stuff and choosing color palletes.
besides us not wanting you to financially invest in this since this is literally just a community tool, we also dont want to be held liable for money stuff
alright... just, remember. dont spend money on us
yeah seriously dont spend money on us
nice
a shirabe... to go with kirika...
gasp
ohhhh... thatd be delicious
people betting on who lives or who dies
thatd be funny.
mafia with currency
oh my god
games would be fun, but i may avoid the currency
i already have barely enough energy to get through the day
and id really rather not make the hill i die on food.
at minimum i get disregarded and at worst theyll go on a several hour rant on how my life choices are the worst and that i really should listen to them more
i have next to no input on things and the only things i have managed to obtain was literally through getting in physical fights with my parents
i dont, because i dont really get to choose
our local grocery chain sells it cheap.
i can at least enjoy the potatoes but id rather just have potatoes period.
forever.
constantly
all we have is salmon
lets trade...
please...
and ive prepared it
ive had nonstop fish for the last month
`RAW POWER`
the apartment hotel room is big but not that big
yeah
playing mutiny in this situation is a very bad idea
no no no
no
i take my laptop with me
yeah
the gaymes
thats just the gacha formula though.
yeah but its because theyre looking at you
its all girls
girls frontline is your go-to gay gacha
i checked it out briefly and its not my thing
passed all my classes so unless something horrible happens in the fall im going to graduate
i hope so
i am so completely resigned to my fate in this vacation that im treating it less like a vacation and more like a gacha camp where i hammer down on my fate grand order stuff.
they constantly bicker.
i just dont like doing it with them
my parents think i hate walking around but i actually like walking through cool places
we go back. we shower. we lounge. we might do a drive. maybe briefly step foot in the nice dock place that has entertainment. but only for a day.
we wake up. we go to beach. we dick around in the water for exactly 30 minutes to an hour. we dont have fun. i dont do anything except swim around. i am expected to dunk my head underwater one (1) time.
every day is as follows:
because my parents are old and would rather be holed up than see all these places. we dont dine anywhere. we hardly participate in these things. the very few times we do, theyve ended in fights.
none of it.
and we're going to do
there are a lot of amazing ice cream stores, and a really good pizzeria, and a pier you can overlook that sells novelty trinkets that are really cute, and the entire scene is very 90s mellow with fully visible rise and fall sunsets
on paper it sounds fun: its an entire week beachside in a really nice hotel with a room big enough to basically qualify as a very large apartment facing the ocean; fort meyers is a very sleepy beach town, so its basically taking everything with miami beach and making it as empty and quiet as possible
im going to where ive always stuck going and its a beachside hotel in fort meyers
we can tag team.
thats perfect
around the second week of june im going to be gone for a week. as in, i wont be watching over things, because ill be doing the yearly "my parents want a vacation and we'll be going to the same place we've gone for the last 4 years" song in dance
i need to make `A Staff Announcement...`
that reminds me
maybe something in the image processing bit got confused with the new addition from shirabe's thing?
wheres the complaint
alice...
yep.
anyway, you got your feedback alice. put your foot down and make it clear that the discussion ends there, and tell them to not do it again. and `stop getting sucked into these dumb debates.`
if rukia wants to have serious discussions about the nature of racism across all races and how the system of oppression works, then they can happily have it in serious-discussion. but this is not a space for discussion. this is a moderator, telling someone, to knock it off.
make it a clear point if they do it again, theyre getting the boot, very permanently.
yeah.
alice needs to learn from experience that debating this kind of garbage is not only a waste of her time, but also a very pointed attempt to try and coerce moderators to not enforce the rules on people who broke them. notice how this debate only happens, constantly happens, when we call them out on this.
but also, a ban on this is unwise.
there's a line between discussion and attempting to circumvent them by trying to debate moderators on the principle of why the rule exists.
no ban.
if you remember a while back sakimori, why i was very much incredibly unwilling to open dialouges with people on rule enforcement, this sort of shit is exactly why
do you remember how i said long ago that this isnt something you need to debate, alice
just know that after this, if you decide to still let them stay, to remind them theyre on very thin ice.
ill leave this to alice, though
they were literally here for its creation, and saw the pinned rules that explicitly state that all rules apply there.
if rukia did something again thats been told a thousand times to stop, then they need to get the boot. also, if you delete something, make sure to have the offending image/message on hand.
people dont actively try to break the rules in heiroglyphs because its a fun channel. its not a matter of lack of moderation; its a matter of people not actively breaking rules
i would suggest for your next goal to work on having reddit posts from r/symphogear show up in the discord as a feed but its completely up to you
you're doing god's work, saki
hence the "rome wasnt built in a day" comment
i know
but, they are also just being contrarian
the 'sourcing artists from twitter' part. there's a lot more art that leans towards twitter artists than pixiv around these parts
rome wasnt built in a day
a valid point but this bot literally just got made
miniscule
discord was shitting itself for me
alice ya gotta make the announcement
outage likely.
discord is shitting itself.
if the users understand the point, and the moderators understand the point, and someone does not and keeps breaking rules, then us as moderators must step in and remove them when they break the rule. which they will. its really only a matter of time.
rukia is the sore thumb sticking out who has seen it been made clear he is essentially alone in thinking this
the community reaffirmed the core belief and principles that the rules are predicated upon
like i said
and yes, exactly
rukia being dense plays in the 'getting out' part of the plan
as planned.
im back
`SPEEDY SPEED BOY`
it should be smooth sailing from hereon
saki, keep an eye, you got this.
i need to shower
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLN0SLHcKe0
precisely.
next time he does it, get rid of him.
that is how ya do it.
the community reinforced its own beliefs and now all hostility has disseminated.
no. this is pretty much perfect.
this is precisely the outcome i predicted.
all according to keikaku
alright
just know he is not interested in discussion. he's interested in dominating his points on you, so you can bend to his own beliefs.
it seems particularly hostile that he wants to treat you as The Spokeswoman for these causes but if you want to keep humoring him as a 1 on 1 discussion then go right ahead
give it a moment.
oh wait these are older
The not announces threads and responses in threads
Interesting
take all the time off you want
you've literally done in around 3-4 days the good majority of everything we've had planned for months
of course, you've done so much
alice, we should update the roles message to include where to get the custom roles
i would honestly classify them more as a type of announcement for the server
its a notable feature and having it more visible would be good to remind people the subreddit's a thing
should we move the subreddit feed up to the server category
amazing.
questionable content still exists
wow
thanks discord.
i forgot and no idea. she messaged me a long while back saying she hasnt been able to record voice stuff because of reasons
whether it is or isnt aint our problem.
shrug
so if anything all it would do is hurt her
plus his wife posted it and shes probably really sad
he was a dick at times but i guess its just general regard for the dead unless he was a real fuckin' asshole
i dont have any real strong feelings about it
nah
the people interested will see it eventually, one way or another
ah, okay
....who is redacted
CAPE!
hat
that sounds like a bad trip
This was not intended for this channel but look at how fucking tsundere this goddamn knight is

This is fine, for now
*bot
alright then.
do you see the point im getting at here
except the only one demonstrating to bite said bait is you
you are right, but on the other side of the coin, rukia is not someone who engages in constructive discussion historically. he sealions persistently, and then ignores anything presented to him
cant have a problem if nobody cares enough to engage in it
especially since `you explicitly said this could potentially be a problem`
i mean yeah but if something that seems dumb runs the potential of just casually being ignored, it helps to just ignore it and let it die on the floor as opposed to stoke it, construct comments or otherwise
_long sigh_
its wise not to humor things and let them die on their own
bite your tongue on this alice
our users have brains. ill keep an eye out though.
i am not worried
inertia and focus are the foundations of writers block
thank you saki

old cape needs a break
this is the fineply ironed cape to the old, rugged, yet beloved cape
its vectorized and cleaner
this one

not the cheaty big one i just supplied though
<@!102691114762371072> can you update kirichan's cape command with CAPE 2.0
`Hohohoho... delightfully devilish, R...`
`But if I widen the canvas to make it LOOK like it's square?`
now i can say
there

PAINT.NET
FUCK

hohohohoho...
`but what if...`
what general aspect ratio are you looking for alice
but what if...
`grooooan`

<@!127644949884698624> CAN YOU MAKE MY `CLEAN CAPE` AN EMOJI
@here should we allow <#357682999300718592> for things outside of symphogear
That kind of information would have been nicer to know earlier since that really spins the context on this hard but I understand you keeping it a secret
Now it suddenly makes way more sense why you kept being lenient with them despite tiptoeing the rules aggressively
I am awake and have read up on this
Yay
tea? kay.
technically, its a valid sentence in of itself
theyll probably pronounce it as tee kay
haven is the name of an old ex friend
this will sound petty but... dont use haven
and the timing gets really, really funny
once every few hours
back when i did the irc equivalent it was like
1% is very low
you can set it to a 1% response rate ratio and then have shirabe randomly interject in conversations, spooking the people talking, and appropriately mute her in given channels
in a good environment, `they get real creepy real fast`
i used to have those back in my IRC days
one of those markov-chain bot functions would be interesting
if you want to be cheeky
exactly, but there is literally nothing stopping them from doing it themselves
i remember back in my IRC days when there were issues, you know what we did? we had a dedicated logpost PUBLICLY for people's logs that could be backtracked and we control-f'd to the point of the convo they said
they need that foot up their ass if they have the absolute nerve to get me, a non-staff member, to do their damn job
i will contain it though i will probably still keep going with the heated discussion regardless because i ***really*** gotta bury them
i will reel it back
@ me here or in dms when i get out of hand
otherwise it will be just me, and while im good at entertaining people, i can get really, really mean.
you are a good balance to this place, and also one of the main reasons i wanted another moderator here
so its never a matter of debate or opinion to begin with
but also she was shunted in a corner doing nothing until she split this place
and that their constant tone policing will only make me yell louder because thats how you get things done. alice is a sharp debater and could honestly tell these points infinitely more better than i can
just for you to understand its not coming from nowhere
im not saying this to defend what i do
i know
they actively bury problems and constantly suppress issues. i am a pain to them because i am literally the only person who actively shoves it to their face and forces them to acknowledge it
if you read up on the logs of that group, again, its not the first time i do this
with the decline of valkryie's quality and the knowledge of how they treated alice, i sorta treat them very cold and callously
anyway
and he has some big ones under his belt alongside what is likely a second account with a bunch of other accounts on its belt
the last count was around ~200 owned ones
click on his profile and look at his subreddits
once the subreddit discord became its own entity again, and became more active to what you see now, a group chat of all the symphogear discords was created; the one you see now, with /sgg/, us, and the valkryie server
ironically, i actually have the most moderator experience here, unless you've secretly been taking care of communities for 8 years. a lot of stuff here ive been shouldering because alice gained moderator ability of the subreddit by its founder, who is a powermodding son of a bitch that never, ever acknowledges us. (by the way, dont ever pm them. just dont)
the discord and in turn the subreddit remained dormant until i decided to get involved with it, and with it all the shenanigans i did
quinn on the side had occasionally threatened her to stop advertising the symphogear community itself if she didnt oblige to given demands. quinn has a long history of being cruel and hostile to people, and is generally a massive pill that operates on near psychopathic levels of function. this is why i also took the moment to heavily lash out about her.
she got a ***lot*** of flak and harassment from it. they bitched about it and yelled and i dont recall if they cursed her out but it was sorta nasty.
as you might know, the valkryie server was the first subreddit symphogear server due to the fact that khairz long ago pitched it to alice as The Server, which alice obliged. together, it was one community. the original mods were competentish and people were involved. but over time, the quality slowly dropped and the subreddit aspect of it was shunted away. alice's input was more and more ignored to the extent where she was basically promoted upstairs (a term for someone in a high position that can't do anything useful) and as the general userbase grew more 4chan-lite, alice decided one fine day to split away and make her own.
its a bit more thorough than that
did we alice?
i dont know if we've ever briefed you about the relationship between this place and valkryie
like, "please post over here"
it mostly happens when people apparently dont have the brainpower to listen and just follow along to a simple order from a mod that is relatively harmless
that is true
if you read up the logs youll see this isnt the first time, and probably not the last time, it happens
i know, and i understand
and make their lives living hell otherwise.
so ill gladly curse them out.
nothing. but if their intent is just to backpedal, then the fact of the matter is that they wont listen to any argument regardless.
if they find offense with that, its their own problem. if they dont want to do the work, im not doing it for them.
im not here to make their community a better place. im giving them pointers to improve it at their own leisure.
if they want to sit there and sealion their way into doing nothing, thats exactly what theyre going to do
i try. but the moment they ask me to do something they should be doing is the moment i drop them like a potato. its like a waitress telling you to get your food from the chef. thats not how it works.
i hope they do, this has been the most ive seen them care for a while. they dont do shit and even admitted to not even look at the place, so
but i stopped caring the moment they told me to do their jobs for them
im very aware
i try to be nice but i have very little patience with incompetence.
i am sorry you have to see this side of me, saki
its probably for the better
and it will hurt them. its going to hurt them hard, one way or another...
theyd rather entrench themselves and avoid or downplay everything and debate semantics than resolve anything.
but they havent. and if they havent then, they definitely wont now.
because it should have happened by now. because they should have had the better sense to realize someone like that should not be a staff member by now.
this is precisely why i say its not happening
i know
internally, theyre likely lecturing quinn with the typical mentality of "we wont demote you but this is not good but we wont get rid of you" and then quinn will cry quietly with the staff and theyll comfort her and then theyll all move on not having learned a damn thing.
you saw how they spoke. theyre more interested in backpedaling and downplaying this than actually resolving it.
if they havent demoted her by now with all the dumb stuff she's done, they wont demote her now
its more likely quinn will just leave again, and then come back again, and then pretend it never happened.
they wont demote her though.
all the more reason to throw her out if she does.
i dare her to blame us
`Shirabe will live...`
nice
ill give you the commands and the nature of the commands. theyll likely mirror their IRC counterparts
yep, thats why i plan on hosting it
hehehehehe...
but cruel enough to really fuck with em
not too cruel to keep people from deciding
just the riiiiiight amount of sadism
a good mafia gm always keeps the participants on their edge and doubting their actions
sometimes i straight up RP as characters
personality
and i /really/ like to have fun with mafia
its doable to have a bot run the mafia game for you but its infinitely more fun with a human gm at hand
i might keep it simple and instead of tabulating the results for the win conditions it may be easier to make it just a command list that i can use while hosting it
ill think about it; when i do ill write down the general logic for it to make your life easier
ive done it on discord without bots
well ive been debating between using a bot or not
i used to do mafia games on IRC with custom mIRC commands and i successfully hosted mafia on Discord long ago with ex-friends using some Special Discord Tricks(tm) that i learned
one thing ive always wanted to do was host a symphogear-themed game of mafia
i have something fun planned, and im curious if you'd like to help me
speaking of which, our anniversary is actually july 20th
same with me and the rest of this place, and alice and making this place exist
its friendlier. this place is what valkryie actually used to be before it declined, but even better, because its only gone up instead of down.
and everyone greets the new members instead of someone just abritrarily assigning roles
yeah
live-shitposting? it was a tradition i first did in valkryie. i had suggested making a channel like this to them before. no dice.
yes.
a lot of community jokes and fun stuff i first did there before i brought here
and its disheartening because i have a deep history in that place
`Man oh man is it tempting...`
literally the only reason why we still associate with the valkryie server is because alice wants to, which i dont fault her for but man...
that level of amateur unprofessionalism disgusts me to my core
its stupid
and when firebingo started actually doing it he went "well... it's not a problem to ME"
large media sites actively promote hate, because it is what coaxes user engagement the most in the larger depths of big name online products
this is not an accident nor is it a coincidence

ill probably try and dig up my old markov bot tomorrow
https://github.com/calzoneman/MarkovBot
and some other stuff
http://charlesleifer.com/blog/building-markov-chain-irc-bot-python-and-redis/
saki, have some reading material
you may need to cull things from her vocab and keep her from learning in specific places
ah, okay
itll be so funny
lets not announce this and see people's reactions
and you're golden
art too and archived channels, avoid those
avoid music and tabletops
any social non-serious channels are fine
fancontent is fine
symphogear discussion is fine
none of the server channels
okay... lets see...
glorious
and also saying in a very nice tone that 'we will resolve nothing'
its disingenious. theyre choosing to be professional /now/ when theyre quietly dming us about things.
this was manicured. likely formulated by all the higher staff at large.
feel like im reading a fucking email
how typical.
slapped wrists around the board with nothing resolved
its all hot air.

also saki have you seen `The Latest Developments` on the wiki end of things

i do not like how abrasive he is, but i can at least respect someone who knows how to run a tight ship
he is competent

god thats so pretty
ill work on prettying the wiki tomorrow

no, it was meant to be a one off

excuse me, i do too
because now i need to fix the kirika gun image with this genius
i am upset...
im upset

tell me when kirika with the gun is implemented
i likely wont get nitro for a LOOOOOOOONG while
id be extra happy having that gun as an emoji because its slick yet dumb
double yay
_points at the other person chiming in with the same feeling_
it doesnt really add anything outside of shirabe being shirabe
this is true, but solo does have a point
<@!102691114762371072> mute shirabe from fancontent
okay doke
during my vacation im going to really show solo and sparkle what suffering really is
thats good
it can end extremely badly
as someone who has fallen in that pratfall
you need to be careful
shirabe is deeply beloved and so are you. its natural for a father to get upset about someone not liking their offspring.
it's alright, saki
_pats_
it would be unfair to scold people to utilize a function that was made for their own entertainment, especially when all of us did the same.
pretty much
he isnt wrong in looking at us for dealing with it
_shrug_
that doesnt mean im not listening. it means im listening, and i think its stupid.
and the kind i have no patience for.
its that kind of pretension that annoys me
he strikes me as the kind of person who sorta festers in their thoughts unchallenged without realizing the context of the way things operate; the time her argued about us enforcing the rules over something that was written write in the very ruleset, for example
there is a reason i sorta stepped my foot down on him a while back when he started getting contentious
thats not a shocker
if you want to talk about them, do so here
i dont really share solopy's strange opinion on his belief that the channel is "dying" for the same reason that people do not write 24/7 like maniacs
the direct way of addressing it is 1. dealing with the source, and 2. reinstating activities to get it going again
if someone is pointing out that something is overshadowing the content of a location, and its been made clear thats the case, user driven or not, it needs to be addressed
its taking credence to what theyre saying and factoring it into the health of a given place
it isnt a matter of bending to one person
`SAKI! YOU SON OF A BITCH...!`

art will be much harder and ill need some time to think about it
yeah dont worry
i will need more time for thinking about something involving that
there is demand for doing this with art instead, hm

yes
yes
which means i need to start learning now.
it is now a staff requirement for everyone to know how to skate

that is the power... of `The Pingus...`

2017
WHERE OUR FOUNDING FOREALICE DECLARED THEIR INDEPENDENCE FROM VALKRYIE, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE, TO ALL
july 20th is the anniversary of the creation of this discord
yes
as for events. im already preparing the writing event, and the discord anniversary event is coming soon, but that we will start preparing when im back from vacation
just in time for the 1k subscription, too
i think it is time to start updating the reddit theme

```TO-DO LIST (IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER):
--------------------------------------------------
- WORK ON REDDIT THEME IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER:
1. NEW REDDIT THEME
2. OLDER REDDIT THEME
- MAKE EVENTS
    * GAUGE EVENT TYPES TO SEE WHICH ONES WORK WELL
    * MINIMUM ONE A MONTH (SMALLER ONES WORK AS WELL)
- CONTEMPLATE REWATCH EVENT
    * GET RESEARCH ON ALTERNATIVE STREAMING VENUES OUTSIDE OF CYTUBE
    * CONTEMPLATE ALTERNATIVES IF THAT FAILS```
let's see...
now that yttt is taking on the bulk of the wiki project, i can refocus back to this place and do more fun community stuff alongside the things i had for the to-do list
ive got something else planned
nah
ill make an image.
something small, but impactful
no idea
***WAKE UP***
WAKE UP
@here
i can adjust it tomorrow
i went with datto shitemo because alice told me
plus it can even be a temporary server icon
its not the most impressive thing in the world but i feel it came out decent
anyway whattaya think
`EVEN SO`
***DATTO SHITEMO***
`DATTO SHITEMO`
yes

after the anniversary where we do MAFIA i want to experiment with some Big Brother stuff with custom prompts done
anyway
pinny pin
pin
https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/8qpz4a/were_hosting_a_biweekly_writing_event_in_our/
as for the prompts there's no need for a thread yet for topics
if 13 people are participating then itll need to be like that to give people time to give input
a week to write, a week to read
its bi-weekly
not really
doh holy shit its ballooned to 13
im fine either or
gotcha
also it doesnt look open source
feel free to take the form i made and link it there directly
oh, sure
also let me double check
***ALICE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PENIS PARTICIPATE IN THIS***
can you fathom this

i wish
no
i mean i think it is but thats not the case
no
a ***shocking*** discovery...
and i have come across a shocking discovery
a friend of mine recently did some hunger game stuff by herself because jokes. out of curiosity, i decided to ask for the website so i can look at it again, mainly to relearn the mechanics
a large, massive party of people raining down and having the times of their lives watching each other massacre each other. but. but...
the biggest thing in the valkryie server used to be the symphogames, hosted by chris.
i dont blame you, but ignore your phantom pain and humor this a moment
besides your dick
but alice knows
you wouldn't, because it is `before your time`
the biggest thing that has attracted the MOST involvement.
no alice. you see. what is the one big thing the valkryie server is known for.
no saki. it is even better, and something that can involve multiple bikkis
`THE BEST SERVER IN EXISTENCE`
THAT WILL MAKE US
THE THING
I'VE FOUND A THING
and when it comes around, we'll be prepared.
its not a problem
and its not a bad thing if we repeat them
but also our backlog of ideas is pretty monolithic
i cant tell you what because i havent focused my brainpower to those things
also... whatever we can think of
i doubt symphogear will stop seeing content given that symphogear is so tied with albums from artists to such an extent where its a MASSIVE ip but in that event where everything just gets the doors closed we just keep moving
there's not much else
rewatches, jokes, events to the max
we make up shit
oh
i vividly recall there being two seasons after axz
wasnt there a season announced after xv
It's all good
right now im... committing sins...
sure
todd howard coming in with that locksmith 100 skill
at least to check out if its not garbage
ive always wanted to give it a try
http://pokemon-planet.com/
also, i remembered something i bookmarked a while back
alright
actually, that reminds me...
how would you check for cheating
what would the contest be
go for it
i wont stop any of you from doing it, but working on it as us, alone, a staff thing? it is quicksand, and it only spells doom
you can swap the argument im making with any genre, and the engine example i posed with any other, and the argument is still the same
- people who understand what goes into any sort of fighting game to begin with
- people who would be familiar with MUGEN itself
- coders who would actively want to do this, for /free/
- artists familiar with drawing the symphogears well
we need:
there's a lot to be orchestrated if we make any sort of game, period. there's a reason everything i do in terms of events is a bit low effort. games take time and work to make, and people willing to work on them. tossing asside the potential legal ramifications on everything and theoretically lets say we made a symphogear fangame on something like, say, MUGEN
thats /one/ of many reasons
no
```IDEA: XDU sucks so let's make our own symphogear game. As long as the music comes separately and we're not selling it, it SHOULD be fine legally.```
...i have no idea how to implement this
this is true
who knows
ah, okay, dont sweat it then
<@!102691114762371072> , you around?
backish, gonna shower but
brb
he's about as confrontational as a lawyer.
hes not confrontational
interesting......
interesting...
this is adorable

also
(which again, i was there for)
the conversation is going in interesting directions, given he never spoke of this after it happened
its good to get things out there
dont be
im satisfied that quinn has been defanged and that her threats hold no weight anymore.
no need
oldest trick in the book.
just as quietly as they can demote a person theyll promote them back.
they sure can, but it was never spoken about or announced
it was never formally announced there, but she was demoted. dont say anything about it outside of here, though
im pretty sure theyll give quinn x-drive status back after a month or so
not so intimidating after getting their powers revoked in another server, getting raked through the mud for their sheer stupidity, and then having to go down memory lane on all the other awful shit shes done
not shocked.
when saki comes back `from the war` ill have to ask him to make a writing prompt group so i can begin preparations today
okay doke
a little less
we still got around two years for xv though
damn.
well.
just saw the tweets
oh i see why you asked about symphogear ending
i looked at the server in my `Frog Form...` and its alright
alright, nevermind
tch
oh right, because we type in role assignment
itd also be useful to fuse role-assignment with one of the other server channels
since people dont talk a lot for it to conflict with one another
i think we can fuse music commands with general voice and have general voice and its voice channel be both the talking and the music corner
a general voice channel is still useful though
true
i know but even then there's still a lot of channels
im still trying to wrap my mind around what to do to reduce the channel number here
just name it Writing Prompt
the writing prompt role...
`saki are you hoooome...`
alice confirmed new mortal kombat character
Just trying to make sure we keep channel numbers low
I suppose
Mmmmm
A fine blend of 2d and 3d art
We can rework the art channel into arts-and-crafts
take your time
and nice
i need to prepare some stuff because tomorrow i leave for `beach purgatory` but until then with the role done ill ping everyone involved manually and tell them to put on the role
its for the event tomorrow
because this is seperate from the community antho- yes
yes
wait
saki can you add a 'Writing Prompt' role
ARE YOU THEEEEEERE
SAAAAAKIIIIIIII
oh
why are we kicking ibu
?
announcement deployed
`I am fully operational.`
So I can rest
Give me a moment
Sure
hey remind me again what the server uses for reverse image searches
alice confirmed trans pope
im gonna miss the kanade emoji
and continues to do so
it did exactly what it needed to do
whenever anyone asks, "who makes content for symphogear", we slap them the list
new artists havent revealed themselves or asked to hop on it, so naturally there won't be new additions. but there doesn't need to
basically a "we support our community" kinda deal
it exists to advertise and be an example
its not meant to be active
ah, okay
```"non-symphogear crafts"```
yes but
because then you're cutting out the figurine aspect, since i predict symphogear figurines will pop up in discussion
mmmmm, no
fucking liveblog manufacturing ikea furniture for all i know
same goes for... well, anything really
it would fit well in a diy channel
i know lone likes to talk about his beer brewing, which is fascinating but feels incorrect in serious-discussion and live-shitposting
it can be general DIY stuff
as for what else to gunpla channel can be
`I have returned from beach purgatory...`
im too tired to argue this further.
there is nothing i hate more than avoiding rule enforcement because they agree with their beliefs. i agree with hazel on a lot of political points and i also agree that wien's a moron
put your foot down harder instead of licking their boots
next time, please tell hazel to tone down the condescending tone. its serious-discussion, not holier-than-thou time
what did i come back to
it is no surprise that he stays more in line here while we're more harder on him
yes
if it's happened so many times that we've literally had to sit down and talk about it in a server where these things normally happen, that is automatically in the "enough" zone
we've talked about it before and that alone is already the indication of "enough"
i refuse to be like those valkryie pansies and allow repeat offenders to keep skirting around and grow a brain
no questions. this has been repeat behavior and he's gotta get the boot
i saw this late, and i wouldnt want to undo what was already done, but the next time, he gets a kick
it would not be fair to come down on langou for something others have done in the past similarly, so i would not do anything about it when it comes to langou. instead, we should probably take the direction of affirming heiro as a more sfw place
there's been vaguely nsfw things posted in heiro and ive been very lax about it so long as its not straight up porn
oh its fisting an anus
what is this
also, now that i am back from vacation, i want you to help me prepare for the discord anniversary mafia game
_pats the saki_
i see...
still, fuck em
oh
there is a sad irony how the issue we faced with telling the server about DL's harrassment being fostered by their own community right before their eyes and it being handwaved as "clearly not enough evidence" is met with literally someone saying "i do not like them because trans isnt a thing" while repeatedly misgendering DL
also, im cutting off riya now. i never really speak with them and reading that made my stomach churn, they can rot in their own little crafted hellhole anyway
this amuses me
i read it
what happened in the other server
```especially after reading everything in the other server that happened with ibu,```
what
im not against giving channels the axe but there were others besides langous who wanted it and a few more people came out of the woodwork to use it
i need to think of a way to inject more positivity into serious-discussion
fuck these corn flakes are tasty
though thats less a fault of the server and more a fault of the times
serious-discussion has been coming more and more contentious
mmmmm
langou got it coming
i just read up on this while eating my corn flakes
what
that kind of stratification is common, and its not exactly a bad thing
No, like a "an admin chat for admins that's meant for talking without basic mods PRESENT that just devolves to bitching"
Their staff is large enough to warrant it
I wouldn't be shocked if valk has an admin only chat dedicated to raw shittalking
I don't know what amuses me more, his patronizing attitude over an indefensible position he wants to dig himself in deeper, or the raw hypocrisy given he probably has done the same and is just trying to mollify it
Funny how he pulls this with you but not me
i have a few in mind but i need to give you the ideas for mafia so we can do it on the server's anniversary
speaking of events
they can bitch about me all they want but at the end of the day im helping in their dumb event
`I always have...`
as long as they breathe ill keep driving them crazy until they just give up
it helps that i have tons more experience over what to do over them on these things
this is my way of performing psychological attrition. i fill em up with thoughts, shove it down on em, and let them process it until they tear themselves apart.
the last time i gave them hell, they spent a week wrestling with each other over something that is, in a bigger perspective, a no brainer
they are dumb and insecure when it comes to handling their own things
yelling at them destablizes them
i will try, but my yelling isnt just out of raw anger
nope
yep
yeah, surprise
welcome to the shitshow
"R, it's through peace and communication that all the symphogear servers can unite and stand for something good"
"R, we need to unify the servers and have them work together peacefully"
if they want to be idiots, they'll do so at their own expense
doing his job for him only enables him to be shit at it more while avoiding the consequences of not being responsible
you need to not do his damn job
(he won't, because he's a narcissistic sociopath and will instead blane everyone else instead of him)
there's no point in trying to convince him of anything and his arrogance wont give a shit about anything until he feels consequences about it
i know xaxas' line of thinking well because its a mentality from most south american countries, which are pretty much the biggest shitholes for trans folk in existence
then there's no real point to talking more. its rotten to the core.
if a community wants to value someone's (dumb) opinions over the safety of their users, and wants to prioritize bad opinions over people literally telling someone why their comments are hurtful, bad, and incorrect
as for him talking about the whole "well if you dont educate people, they wont learn", xaxas has repeatedly shown no interest in learning, and he himself said that xaxas is steadfast in his own opinions, whether right or wrong
its not a safe place.
just tell them, point blank
and if anyone asks in the future, about what the other server stands on
its not a safe place
well, he said it himself
my brain
`Oh.`
i-
dont get me wrong, i think their rhetoric is stupid and going in circles for exactly what you just described
translation: sparkle is scared to label riya as a rape apologist because it will force her to look at a good friend in a negative light that they dont want to
sparkle will get scared and buckle under pressure because sparkle doesnt really do well with pressure
i already know how this will turn out
I don't think making them privy to your talk with bingo is a good idea but whatever floats your boat
It was very much out of left field too
Which is objectively wrong
It's weird, because sparkle seemed to be less defending rape and more defending riyas perspective on the defense that it didn't have anything to do with rape
Go for it
I would talk to them but not warn them
saki, keep an eye out.
ive got to sleep
R agrees
R thinks sparkle is digging a needless hole, saki
there's nothing new there
`SEARGANT, I DON'T SEE ANY STRIFE HAPPENING ALONG THE BORDER MEETING GENERAL CHAT AND HEIRO. WITHDRAW TROOPS?`
_puts on binoculars to see distant serious discussion territory_
as much as i enjoy lighting a fire up their asses i really do not want to breed a "us vs. them" mentality, for the same reason ive tried avoiding it with other things
<@!127644949884698624> please dont specify the valkryie server
this is a "babby's first convo on why pure centrism is bad" discussion
im not really worried about this discussion, though
as much as i enjoy seeing hazel rip and tear into things it wont be conducive to keeping it sane at all
i hope hazel AND wien isnt around
do what you gotta do
just dont break your own rules, alice
if i must
_long sigh, puts on the leather jacket and fetches a bat_
id rather it not be a bot command. remember that the numbers are random
ehhhhhhh
also you can just say it in fancontent
yep
Yeah
This is the internet, they won't lose sleep over a kick, and a self-removing quarantine rule is the biggest joke I've ever heard
The act of physically leaving the server is a firm enough reminder that they are here because we allow them
No
Yep
Hella
Alice, you've given me exactly what I wanted, so I'm not really upset at all
Wonderful
Kick + invite it is
People inherently have to know about the subreddit to find it
It's a public discord
Links they can find themselves
It sorted out rukia and it sorted out wien
Kicks have shown their effectiveness here though
Why are you pitching moderation styles that have failed repeatedly on valkryie
A mute feature is worse
There are not any other options between selective channel blocking and full removal
Kicking is the alternative
Because you're using the role for the same issue
Except that is redundant
It's simple and effective
If they come back having no care for realizing what they did wrong they get the boot
Kicks remove the problem and make it clear that they need time outside the server
It doesn't matter if there is or isn't a lobby
A kick works better
It's disingenuous
It's a dumb formality that'll only serve to piss people off more
I'm not fond of the restricted role
It's part of the job
Moderators get yelled at all the time
pretty much
if you conflate the concepts and treat it as something out of survival sense as opposed to embracing improving the safety of your community, things only get worse, and in turn you normalize people getting away with said violence
if you're stabbed for walking in a dark alleyway, should you have had some sort of weapon on you, or known the means to defend yourself going through said alleyway? yeah, sure. does that negate the fact that you were stabbed? no. a stabbing's a stabbing, and its still a crime, and it is still someone who committed that crime. focusing on the victim on the crime for not defending themselves removes the core root of the cause: that someone did the stabbing
people who defend rape tend to conflate the two
keep pressuring him. id emphasize the fact that she is saying that emphasizing precautions and condemning the act of rape are two mutually exclusive concepts
sparkle's a big baby and afraid to look at riya negatively even though their very logic is contradictory
anyway
i am so sorry
pretty pwease
can we do that alice
*as
i want to rebrand ryokou is maria
i dont understand what is going on
???
ryouko...
maria...
yeah but
`I want to convert her into the Maria bot and finish the trifecta.`
_eyes ryoko_
and we have a shirabe.exe
we have a kirichan
it has dawned on me
<@!127644949884698624>
i have a proposition to pitch
If you feel otherwise though I'm not against it
I'd say it's edited enough in a way to let it slide
*?
The slur is jap yeah
Mmmmmmmmmm
kk
but for now i dont think the solution needs a bot command. just for now
ill keep it in mind but i may refine the logic a bit because it will be weird having it set up under numbers when the authors under those numbers wont be the same
i do not like you telling me to stay quiet on this. i will do it, but know that i will voice my displeasure whenever possible.
i dont want users who make mistakes that have the capacity to grow and learn from them run the risk of being conflated with users who dont give a shit or are contentious
i am warning you now. this style of book-keeping warnings over things that aim overexamination of things without regard for the context of what was fully going on (ie someone talking about slogans made by a bot and then posting them in a channel) will not end well. i would prefer a more formal warning system with the aim in mind to log real warns towards people who break rules with no real regard over what happens than this.
tell saki to rewrite it so its not a warn
i think you are choosing to be very stubborn to document something that doesnt need documentation when its been made clear that this kind of tactic is not a healthy direction
logging this against them now is inherently unfair
except you already told them it wasnt a warning in the first place
i would think that someone who preaches that kind of postivity constantly would understand that
this doesn't warrant action. it warrants guidance. we want to nudge people who listen to the right direction. people who do not listen, like langou, get the boot
no, but deleting the warn when we said they are not warned for it is a fundamental honesty towards what it said. if we say, "you're not warned for it", there should be no log for warning. the dm isnt to warn them. its to explain and communicate the thing to them, and make it clear that 1. theyre not in any trouble, 2. we understand why they may have posted the thing from a popular bot after they were discussing the nature of the bot and its examples, and 3. facilitates transparency that we say what we do
that would mean that, by association, you should remove the warn here logged for it
did you include the part that said "you're not warned for it"
to say nicely, "hey, i know you copied that from inspirobot and a lot of people share those images, but we dont really want to share images that encourage suicide on the potential that people who feel those impulses might take it seriously, and i hope you understand. its nothing personal, and you're ***not warned for it***, we wanted to just clear that up, since we deal with a lot of people who have heavy depression here in the server."
you are the one issuing the warning
it should be telling to you that the person (me) who is regularly draconian about these things is telling you to reel it back for this one
and i feel that kind of mentality is not good towards approaching things at minimum are misunderstandings
i feel this does not warrant something to be used against someone
im aware, but making it a formal warn over something you can just talk about is excessive. you cant argue that warnings are meaningless when you're pushing for its very logging; a log means a record, and a record is kept and used against people
a formal warning isnt needed in an opportunity where we can just guide our users to do better
the basis of having a functional server is to understand where people come from when they post things and nudge them in the right direction whenever possible. cast5 had explicitly mentioned about inspirobot and was talking about its nature in general chat
since the intent wasnt to upset people and more to share nonsense images from a bot
alright, but i would not constitute a warn; i would go for something more informal as a "hey, i know where this comes from and i know you dont mean harm, but please take it down"
which makes nonsense inspirational style posts
he's not telling people to kill themselves. this is repost content from inspirobot
yeah i know, but there is context missing here
?
K
alright
`saki are you malfunctioning`
???
if you want saki i can draft up a 3 bot system where we can organize bot command groups for each of them
fine
tch
And more importantly, will future mods down the line do so?
But ***will we?***
You guys are seriously making me lose my damn mind.
....a formal warn list??????? That's the point of formally warning people???? If they do something and we give them a slap on the wrist, and they fuck up literally a ***year*** later, because they're fucking falliable, I don't see the problem just giving them a slap again? People who fuck up constantly are very fucking visible and would get a formal warn regardless? It's literally what we already have?
I do not know how much more clearer this needs to be.
You don't need to. That is exactly the point of me saying it's not something that needs to be logged. Explicitly, if something like this happens again (which empirically it won't, because surprise, the majority of people we poke and do this with either stop, or do full fucking throttle that they get banned or just stop talking (re:, Langou and Rukia) and stop doing it), we tell them a bit more sternly that they are warned for real, and we record it.
As a laundry list to see what people do wrong.
That is literally how warning systems, since the 2000s for every piece of software, has operated.
That is the entire point of a warning system.
Yes. Except, by logging it, ***they are.***
It isn't okay. ***We are teaching them that they have the space to understand that it isn't okay without the air of persecution.***
***Do not lump me with them.***
It absolutely is not. They reposted content from a bot they were talking about. They just wanted to show off what a dumb bot said. This is not the same as "well they /didnt/ know". This is not a matter of repeatedly preaching hate speech. This is someone who just made a simple misjudgement about something that they themselves were even wary of, who ***understands*** what they did wrong when we politely told them, "Hey, that is a bad thing."
Don't you dare compare my reasoning to them.
doing this is the opposition direction, and when you're in a situation where you have to cite this, it is going to blow up on you
a means to encourage and help improve people by not pressuring them with the knowledge that we are recording every small misdemeanor they do will give them the leeway to be more productive members in this community and keep this place healthy. ive already repeatedly hashed down the fact that they did not intend it as a suicide joke, and were just reposting information from a generated bot that's been shared hundreds of thousands of times, and the fact that they expressed doubt about posting it at all is a positive sign that we want to bring out more
this was also before we had a functional logger
alice had a habit of deleting messages when someone would say bad things and i explicitly told her to stop that because if you delete messages during a conversation, you are actively eliminating evidence
it was old, several months before you came in
this is not the same kind of freedom i would give people actively breaking rules. and you've /seen/ me in action.
i want to make sure there is a warn system in check that records users who do wrong. not fringes of rules that can just be resolved with a simple click and talk. which we literally just did. they literally said "i was really on the fence on saying this, to be honest", and instead of putting in something that can be interpreted as punishable, we give them the benefit of the doubt and say "dont do it again" and let it move on
except last we checked we talked eons ago about message deletion was bad and can potentially be abusive. this means that this rhetoric only extends to hieroglyphs, which is the one place where direct message deletion is encouraged to eliminate bad things. and yes, we can use our judgement, but i dont want our judgement to be skewed potentially for us and for other future moderators down the line if they ever come along on what merits a closer examination or not, especially when sitting down and talking is infinitely more effective. and you may say to yourself, "well, of course we'll sit down and talk with them", except ***the very founder of this chatroom*** would have skimped out on this if i didnt call it out in the first place
communication is a higher priority than doing this
the fact that you not only show no awareness to the fact that you were more eager to check off a warn list instead of approach and speak to him until i pointed this out emphasizes the danger of keeping an informal list like this
and we can all move on without checking off a list that can be used against him
because he learned from his msitake
without, yknow, holding that against him
by SPEAKING TO HIM, he can then go "oh, okay, yeah, wont do it again"
he was not cracking a suicide joke. he was showing generated content from a bot that made it. and as you saw, even HE was iffy about it
no, the warn isn't because he posted content from a bot he was discussing about that was alongside a bunch of other images. this isn't new protocol for hiero. we've done this before dozens of times with potentially less or more offending images.
no. those are formal warns.
at best its redundant; the informal log will only tell us the greater story of what the formal logs have. issues with users with formal warns speak harder than informal logs. at worst, you risk conflating users who can actively improve over detriments in the community
im using cast as an example. secondly, if you read that i agreed with one log system, and not with another, then the answer is "yes, it's pointless to keep two logs"
the former, yes. the latter, no. the latter falls into what your average warn system is. we do not have to hesitate to use warns towards bad behavior. the issue here is that there is a difference between active malice, and someone who was discussing the content of something and shared it in another channel, with that content happening to have something that may have breached our rules a bit.
it is ending with you telling me to shut up and accept it.
it started with me voicing disapproval over using a formal warn system to log informal details, and me criticizing how that can feed into something very negative towards the community. this doesnt need saki's technical perspective with bots because the heart of the matter is logging those kinds of details as opposed to just handling them more gently with a forgive and forget style mentality to keep users feeling like any mistake they do is a gun to their temples when it is just an earnest misjudgement on their part they really wont repeat again. i /only/ suggested renaming it to something that isnt warns for the sake of being congruent with what you said. ideally, i would just not make it a warn at all, and save the system for real rule infringments that warrant logging.
then she got into a cocoon
she ate stuff
i mean
wasnt the plot to axz basically the very hungry hibiki
okay...
okay
i just get upset when i am told to shut up suddenly when trying to make a point
i will try to tone down the anger
you dont need to. moderating is a group endeavor. you have two other brains with you. a team has everyones backs, and i have yours
lots and lots and lots of experience...
if people are listening, i will help them. if they take advantage, ill know, `And I will be the first in line to remove them.` i sadly speak from experience
that other server embodies it. its why i ignore it.
because they dont want to listen, or be helped, or understand. and there is no tolerance or patience for them.
it just so happens many people online skip to the latter
i know i can be really intense and seriously just downright tell people to fuck off but i firmly believe despite my cyncism about MANY THINGS that the fundamentals of being a mod if "help first, ban later"
i just really really really dont want this to become a weird secret police is all
thats okay. i let myself get too angry
okay dokey
ive written rules for places since i was a teen. the original #minecraft IRC rules were my own creation and i even yelled at notch about some of his own.
would you like me to reuse some of my old templates or make something from scratch
we all do that anyway so its not much of an issue and mods DO need to be active
actually? yeah, thats perfect
that sums it up perfectly
yeah that
well, let's review using what i described and the process of elimination
it's not rocket science.
***We gave him the fucking boot.***
he didn't, and do you know what we did?
that is indeed what we did with langou. we did indeed talk to him nicely at first. did it again? I ***personally*** told him to shape up, or he got the fucking boot
you record those warns. you review those warns. enough warns? enough of an asshole? gone.
he's gotten better. still some rounded edges but he's VASTLY improved from shittalking the subreddit server with quinn
wien was an example of the former
rukia is no longer a problem.
rukia was an example of this
if they meet that criteria and they give you shit? you kick them!
if the person you are warning does not meet those 3 criteria, you slap the fucking warn on em
that's a whopping two people that learned! compared to the valkryie's 0.
anything ever happen again? nope. because ***He learned, and so did Joe.***
and we also told him about the slurs.
wfc posted it himself without knowing it was announced. what did we do then? `We told him to delete it, and he did.`
wait, no. this wasn't wfc. this was joe
"Hey, please trim the slurs on that. That's not very good."
we told him, very politely and nicely
what did we do, when this happened?
did we warn wfc about this? no, we did not. because we realized that 1. wfc doesnt cause much trouble despite whoever he is, 2. is posting information from an outside source, and 3. was doing this during a conversation where he was asked to relay it.
which was very much riddled with slurs. lots of them. because of 4chan speak.
a good example of this is the time that wfc posted the yametetomete talks about the xdu wife event
First you define a warn. You are correct about this, and this is something that needs to be resolved. Second, we need to have a better policy towards how we handle warns, because currently it's very muddled and jumps between situations. A guide that reads "If someone breaks the rules, do the following" which lists the courses of action to do. The very first one should ***always*** read to explore the context of the situation and the severity. If someone is indirectly posting something that may break a rule, and they 1. Offer context which hints that they were unaware/on the fence about something, 2. Has a secondary explanation aside from "they are ignorant of the rules" and 3. Are a member who usually doesn't cause any problems, ***the first course of action is to immediately speak to the user to clear up any misunderstanding and make it clear they have broken the rules without realising***.
Still a bit of an asshole but- oh, sorry- gotten better!
Wien? Same treatment. You know what? He's gotten better!
Rukia, who we explicitly gave the benefit of the doubt and talked to them about it? Massive asshole! What did we do? Repeated kicks and temporary bans. Now? She shut up.
I don't even understand why this is a debate because ***we've done this! Effectively, and proven!***
Because by doing so, we can better foster people to not do that again more effectively than just recording every small infraction. It's more constructive, and more effective, and the people this doesn't work on usually immediately fucking hate this shit and go 300 MPH and get themselves banned IMMEDIATELY for being contentious assholes.
The issue is ***ACCEPTING THE HUMAN ELEMENT OF WHAT TRANSPIRED TO HELP NOT FOSTER A SENSE OF PERSECUTION AND HIGHTEN TENSION ALONGSIDE LOSING TRUST TO OUR STAFF GROUP FROM OUR USERS***
If we aim towards doing it constructively when there are smaller mistakes, it will make for an easier, more accepting, and not paranoid community.
This is why I am repeatedly hammering this into you guys. We are equally as falliable as them.
Hella
it wont matter
point of the game is to watch and conspire
it doesnt matter if they can see the spectator chat, theyll be seeing the game chat regardless
yes
and a mafia channel, where the mafia plot
a game channel, where we actually play the game
a lobby channel, where guests can be that arent involved
in the mafia category we'll need...
just for that extra zest
have it be briefly visible before you hide it
if you want to be a cocktease
ill need a MAFIA category
do i have the power to add channels and stuff
<@!127644949884698624>
im gonna announce a teaser to what we're doing july 20th for the mafia thing and begind drafting and preparing how its gonna go
Ibu tells me they told Alice about why they left but I can surmise what happened in tabletops
I read up in tabletops
I see...
...ibu left?
we've tried to eliminate him with no success.
our community here would survive, but its basically having us be stuck having a symphogear subreddit server without the subreddit
the disconnection between the subreddit and the discord means we lose our primary means of recruiting members
any idiot can contact him and single handedly destroy this place
its deeply annoying because that is our achilles heel
i hate it
`Never.`
i have no qualms adding you there but thats not my position to say. the only thing id ask is to `Not talk to soiguess.`
thats up to alice
this can be arranged
I stopped because it was not very fruitful but if you can get associations that'd be anazing
Go for it saki
its very specific, and very wacky
<@!102691114762371072> i have a small assignment for you
feed me...
i want to eat the roles
gold medal?
medals
<:HibikiGold:370774300883419136>
we've even got the golden hibiki
golden hibiki
fine
people like pretty stickers.
a catch all seems better
and a pat on the head.
if they do good in the server we give em a lil ol' gold sticker
we could give people a hidden role called Gold Sticker that we can assign to people for contributing towards the server that doesnt change their name color
we have a lot of those already, technically
its a very subjective thing, and its a fine line to walk on between encouraging people to contribute to the server and breeding elitism and favor towards people who do things in the server
i dunno
so...
i would not set outside as a mod yet
good morning
i will definitely be asking saki for stuff, and ill also be pitching some things to him for the bots in general to help organize things
in my mafia hosting experience, it means little that people talk about the game while the game is going on after theyre booted.
2. it keeps conversations from going into pms, where cheating usually happens
1. dead players dont really know the answer to what is going on inherently. everything they say is conjecture. even if other players were to use that information, itd be irrelevant; at the end of the day, the risk remains, and its no different from in-game talk.
but i dont want to suppress the means of discussing the game to themselves. the reason is twofold
dead players cannot talk in the game
ive seen it all. felt it all. and looking back at it, if i could have avoided it, i would have
the whiplash of being hailed as god and then immediately being treated as trash.
those sleepless nights wondering if you did the right thing or not, the self-doubt in those long talking matches about whether or not you're right, the raw negativity you recieve when you have to do something that you KNOW is the right thing that everyone else refuses to accept, so aggressively so that they denounce, threaten, belittle, and preach about everything you've ever done being wrong forever after
experience that still haunts me even long after it happened
i am just speaking from experience
am i the devil
if you ever do it, its your funeral
very arrogant, and very stupid, and one without a lot of self-reflection on the nature of running a community that big
it is very arrogant to say
they are self-destructive, and topple over with time. even the most competent hands succumb to rot. i should know. the biggest one i was in threw me away after i slaved for them from the ripe old age of 16 for free.
you are better off, mind, body, and soul, not aiming towards incredibly large communities
as someone who has dealt with the worst of the internet has to offer en masse, its not worth it
people will always defer to the easiest course of action to deal with incongruencies with how they think. its works here because the franchise is so niche, and the communities so limited
symphogear is in a special position because despite its flaws it manages to avoid a lot of them
a lot of issues with the anime community stem from the media portrayed within them
im doubtful, but, at least there is progress here
and ive made sure to make that a reality to the letter
there's a reason why i avoided anime communities like the plague
it comes with the territory
i did the most american message possible.
it is done
ill make an announcement but i wont use the infiniping gauntlet
got it
what
nothing much, just a general ***FOURTH OF JULY LET'S PARTY*** server vibe
the barack obama image wasnt good and honestly happy genjuro celebrating is way better

can you set the following for me as the icon of the server for july 4th
good
<@!127644949884698624> you still have the file for the server icon right
`Berenstain bears...`
i swear to you that there is a cameo by barack obama in this show
obama very much did make a cameo in the early seasons of symphogear
and take a screenshot of it
i need you to find the cameo barack obama makes in symphogear
you cant really refute this, alice
yamete tomete is comprised of people who are in the majority made up of /sgg/ members
except you're helping them, because yamete tomete is an offspring of /sgg/
why are you on /sgg/
i dont know
what will you do when people start getting annoyed that theyre being kicked from your server and bring it up with people who run the servers theyre in and decide to give you the boot
okay
so what will you do with people who encourage it in places you cannot see
so again. why do you not ban miganon on this.
except usage of slurs encourages both. this is complicit with the nature of transphobia.
by that logic what val verde said also constitutes as 4chan culture. 4chan culture is raised on a hotbed of racism, misogyny and slurs
yeah within, my bad
except everything said outside of /sgg/ is 4chan culture
that seems pretty banworthy
usage is usage. you also said just now that you wouldnt hesitate to boot some people if you found evidence. there's evidence for miganon. why not boot them?
are you playing favoritism towards people that benefit your cause? because that is elitism, and is completely counterintuitive to your message
you just admitted that you wouldnt ban miganon
```From how far I looked back, the only other person I'd be looking to ban would be Miganon, but given his total of zero messages on the server, the comparatively mild usage of the word on the /sgg/ server, and his standing within the /sgg/ server, I'm willing to give him a pass as long as we're gonna play nice with the admin chat.```
also
also anybody can know rules and have enough of a brain to not say things while still harboring beliefs
sure
no, but we can probably bet the entirety of yamete tomete, a grouped formed from /sgg/ where those opinions are harbored, has similar views
and likely all of yamete tomete
are you prepared to ban half of the server for this, if not more
okay
it's not within our jurisdicition to police those things outside of the server outside of exceptions given with members who have harassed other members in the past (i.e. bwen)
for future reference: we cannot police people's behaviors outside of this server. it doesn't set a good example and it is liable to horribly backfire. im saying this not to defend their actions (they're shitheads and ive never had a high opinion of /sgg/ in general) but doing those things is incredibly unconducive of operating a community
this is not a shocking development
it's not fun. there is very little to gain. it takes a lot just to come out of it relatively stable.
now imagine you, someone who hides their identity through a strong necessity
the duplicity... the pain...
dangerous people. people who like to doxx and talk shit. people from every level, above and below. the very person founding the community insulting me right behind my back despite going along with my methods.
as a cis straight presenting man, i dealt with the vitriol of several thousand people at once
think about it this way
that does not make them any less valid, and im going to explain the importance now of why i insist on this
a safe, progressive place where people arent drowned out by the bad garbage your average anime fan spews, and making sure that the rights are in place where every user can defend themselves while we as moderators remain consistent, strict, and guiding towards those principles. by establishing those rights, the user does not have to fear persecution for things that happen outside of this place unless there exist extrenuating circumstances for it.
sure
long ones. ones that span several years
i have stories, saki
and he is but a mere dwarf in comparison to the raw stupidity i have dealt with
he was very much that stupid.
believe me
`Never.`
believe me when i say you will never reach this raw level of incompetence
and that is the minimum, compared to everything else i have dealt with in terms of moderating
it was the biggest of trashfires
THAT is the ***minimum*** of how badly you would have to fuck up in my eyes for me to leave
founding admin would proceed to botch the plan i gave him and single handedly ruin the community by turning everyone against him so thoroughly that his only saving grace was to ***literally hand administrative power*** towards a select group and then permanently step down from having any say in how things are run, ever, and forced to just own the whole thing by name only.
founding admin repeatedly handed me back my moderator role and i self banned
i got so livid i just left
"You fucking moderators are lazy as shit. You should be out there moderating the server, not sitting around and doing nothing all day!"
the founding admin one fine day, after having done ***all of this***, proceeded to say:
2. fully established a massive, long thought out solution to help restructure the ruleset of said community to help improve the quality of the roleplay as well as help protect minority roleplayers (there was a big problem against trans people and trans characters alongside other things) alongside getting rid of some really problematic roleplayers that also skirted the rules for eons. it was carefully paced out, explained, and bullet pointed for convenience
it was after i had successfully 1. reconsituted the morale of the entire staff and respect from the users to the staff for finally enforcing the rules on an incredibly notorious sophisticated manipulator who was actively assembling their own grief team to ruin other people's rp on a starbound server through a gambit i pulled by using the same tactics of manipulating the founding admin against him (which he was doing to us by feeding said founding admin garbage ideas involving bearucractic division of moderators to basically stall us forever from keeping us from doing things) which led to purging every other notorious person who should had been banned eons ago from there
the last time i literally got up and left a moderator position
to give you a perspective on this
also, again, for the record to get this clear: im not going anywhere, and you would have to be really, genuinely awful for me to up and leave
if you guys really think shes good, go for it
i dont know elise that well, so im neutral
im doubtful mainly because ive seen time and again that folks focused on other things dont really want to be mods
but only if she really wants to
i would be fine giving lily a test run some day
mmmmm
you had the heart
i dont know elise well enough to say
*moderate
lily white is a very nice and responsibile young lady, but i dont think she has the time nor the experience to moderator
yeah
a general undercurrent feeling of "i dont think he can handle the responsibility"
i guess he just doesnt give me The Vibe or something
no.
please leave it.
arbitrarily just humoring cherry picked details of very important things im trying to explain to you isnt going to make anyone feel better.
you told me to stop. i stopped.
because this is ***important*** and you rudely dismissing it when i am trying to be as polite and not yelling as possible about it is really rubbing me the wrong way and aiming to achieve the opposite
the point of this isnt to win
im not interested in winning!
i really, really, really do not like that you are brushing away these points with "stop arguing" and pulling out something that i will be working on throughout the week that i only just said id do during the weekend while also preparing for other events
that is not being honest with the core principles of the server
to anyone outside of this conversation with half a brain, this smacks of cronyism. you are actively looking away from someone's bad behavior for your own benefits
and you explicitly said you wanted to maintain a friendly relationship with them despite this
i am more concerned over keeping ourselves consistent with our moderation while making sure the average user here can exist fairly with the rules. otherwise, you get very bad things happening, like what i was pointing out before with highlighting miganon. you've said that they havent done anything majorly wrong, but by any users standards here, they SHOULD get the boot. they're using slurs. we've talked and kicked and even temp banned people for slurs.
its not a matter of whether theyre active or not. its not even about ***them***. i dont care about them, im indifferent about them
the point i am trying to make here that is going over your head is that you cant bring down the rules on people for things outside of the server once theyre in it unless those individuals are known for being antagonistic towards others in the first place and exist only to disrupt the server itself. doing so fosters insecurity amongst your users
_rubs temples_
can you sense where this is going and why im giving you all these lines of inquiries
okay, but by that logic, symphogi would have also qualified for a ban, given what was likely his potentially transphobic past
you're aware theyre helping us work on the wiki, yes
okay

wait there's a perfect reaction to this
yeah
true
cape always lives on... `in my heart.`
ah well
damnit...
shit, did that include The Cape role
wait
yeah dumping legacy roles is fine if we're doing that
i shouldnt say it, i just hope it happens
nevermind
oh, fuck, have you
there's someone else thatll pop up too thats cool. she's the jock goth
she's the prep goth
she's sweet though youll like her
shes a transwoman historically thought fate botches her occasionally and treats her as genderfluid here
youll like her
have you met d'eon yet
its a fate thing
YEP
carmilla is the edgier goth weirdo who shops at spencers a lot
vlad is the cool goth uncle who was invited to the party by jeanne and didnt really want to show up but he had nothing better to do that day so he decided to join
BIG ASTERISK vampire
*vampire
carmilla fits it more but again its more "vampire"
ehhhhhh
yeah, but...
if not actually more of a vampire than vlad, honestly
who is also technically a vampire
he's about as much a vampire as carmilla
he's partially vampire because its part of his legend but he's not a `real` vampire
he is in actuality vlad the impaler, who dracula is based on
its just part of his myth tacked onto him
he drinks blood sometimes but hes not a really real vampire
hes not, not really
...okay he's SORTA a vampire but only by name and aesthetic
well i mean he IS sorta dracula but hes not a vampire
hes not dracula
the edgy scene kids just cant help it, alice
i understand...
yeah...
but ive been emphasizing this less for them (because fuck them) and more for anyone else in the future
like i said before i really have no real feelings over the people who got the boot and frankly they likely wont do shit about it and will just go "lol subreddit having its period again" because they're /sgg/ shitters
and finally it keeps things fair and keeps from building rap sheets on people who may do those things our of peer pressure or stupidity when they could do better, as well as build rap sheets over potential misunderstandings needlessly or even just avoid the logical conclusion of having the check on every single person on the server about their values. (note: im not saying the people you kicked were A Misunderstanding, im just speaking in general)
this methodology keeps us consistent with what we do. if we target people who we know are pricks, but keep pricks around who we dont know are pricks, it will come off as duplicitious on our part. additionally, it risks judgement in other servers that you would want to keep an eye around and gets you booted. alice had pushed community unity before despite my motivations to basically go "YEET" and smash the whole thing harder than a bull in a china shop. to maintain that while staying consistent to how you enforce things, this is the way to go
3. if they are reported directly to us for hostile behavior in places we cannot see. this one is important, and sometimes it crops up
2. if they have harassed users in the past before (bwen)
1. if they are actively targeting our server by either getting details on users to doxx or just preparing something hostile
the obvious exceptions to this are the following:
our rules coupled with our enforcement already do the legwork to keep these pricks heads low and quiet, while understanding that they cannot do what they do in other servers. there is no need to come down on people who dont really do anything to begin with; they are just there. their silence and obedience in the face of this forces them to deal with the incongruency in other servers. whether they talk shit or the like is their perojgative; it is merely the metric in how effective we are
something you need to understand is that outside of jurisidictional containment (enforcing things that happen in our server, within our server, excluding some exceptions), the purpose of this is to make sure the flow and expression of power cannot be used against people who express themselves outside of this server. this is because this kind of expression of power is prone to abuse. if a moderator does not like a person, and finds that what they say outside a server constitutes towards rules that would be broken if theyre there, they would feel comfortable deposing them with this kind of mentality. you may argue, "but, theyre being transphobic pricks!" and they are. i agree 100% with this. but they're not doing that in our server, because the concepts of keeping that kind of power in check within our own community, and making sure people in that community dont spew that shit, are two mutually exclusive concepts. the valkryie server is an example of the former concept being enforced, while the latter concept ignored. that is where the real problem lies; a problem we've never had, because we've been proactive in enforcing those things.
the amount of death threats, insults, constant harassment i got from previous communities just for doing my job...
being staff is just not a happy job in general. its chill here because not much happens and when it does its very dumb things that can be yelled out and resolved. all of this is literally childs play to what i used to do.
yeah
but it is difficult given our low staff number
i suppose that could be one workaround
even if its for more noble and obvious reasons
stepping out of that bond risks accusation of corruption.
because our proactivity in terms of jurisdiction is limited to our own community. that is the inevitable truth of all larger communities.
```Why should I wait until someone else has been impacted by this hypothetical asshole```
we represent the users and obey their needs. thats the point of being staff
but rules 2 and 3 and thrown out the window for us when it comes to authority, because we have power, and users do not
the overlap of user and staff is still enough where rule 1 is valid for us
no, this can still be handled by rule 1. rules 2 and 3 are what we cant use.
that is what comes with the responsibility of running a community
we are not users. people who are of authority in a given community, while participating in user activities, are no longer ordinary users
this is the secret to making other communities bend to your will
the impetus of our jurisdiction was affirmed, and other servers who had to answer for this could not say "no, you are just putting your standards on us"
if you recall back when i yelled at bingo and co. about this, this was precisely the position i planted and yelled squared in their ears
alone, watching her tumblr get harassed by people, we could not say "well, we need to ban quinn now, they did something stupid". but, with DL coming to us and talking about it, the focus shifts from "i as an individual who runs this server feels the need to enforce the standards of my server(s) onto others" to "a user ***in my server*** is reporting that someone is saying bad things about their art in a place outside of the jurisidiction of both our servers"
the best example i can cite of this is when we were resolving the DL situation against quinn
the real point to touch on is that for three, it is basically what you did with banning those folks but on the impetus for the user. the question therein is, "well, why cant we do what we just did, and commit to direct action about it?', and the answer basically boils down to establishing jurisdiction, which is the point of all this. taking it in our hands on something like that, for better or for worse, risks abuse of power on our end. we cannot establish jurisidiction for servers or locations we are personally on and enforce rules on people that would otherwise be broken in activites they do in another server. but, we ***can*** enforce users coming to us to report those behaviors on the basis that the users feel threatened that this presence exists outside of the server, which gives us the jurisdiction to handle this; this is a useful bargaining rhetoric to use against other servers
no, thats not it. that can be applied for anything, regardless of rules
there will be something i will note about 3 that im surprised you didnt touch on
sure
the usual playthrough of this scenario in a bigger server like our own is that both users will likely not interact and keep to themselves without taking it to the mods.
pre-existing users take priority over those that risk harm to pre-existing users. the exception is if the pre-existing user is actually the abuser in question feigning abuse (ive experienced those cases before)
two users are in a given server. we'll call them A and B. A and B also exist on another server. A and B have 0 relation to each other.  they dont know each other. they are complete strangers. A spots B on this other server which we cannot see spouting something like say, nazi rhetoric. B is not harassing A; B is spouting very bad beliefs about very bad things. A, concerned that B is doing this on this server, comes to us to tell us about this, and we handle it and give them the boot for encouraging potentially hateful ideologies. this scenario cant fall to 1 because its not plotting on attacking the server, and it doesnt fall on 2 because its not harassing the user. thats why 3 exists.
ill give you an example of 3 now
3 covers scenarios we cant see of users reporting people to us that have done things in other places that are very bad
as for the third, there's also overlap but its a different concept
its a classification sort of deal
because while people who fall in the first can fall in the second through overlap, people who are in the second dont fall into the first always
in a situation where a user comes in who seems very friendly and non-offending, but raises alarm bells for an already pre-existing user who knows them and is aware of the bad things they may have done to them, you need to defer to the second one
people who harass others can also be very good at being social with other people. abusers by their nature are very manipulative, and are known to strike up friendly relations with others while also being generally horrible towards a specific person or persons
dogrunes is a unique case that is excluded from this because you are staff and you have the call on people you feel can come and go that have personally harassed you
if someone has shown themselves to be an active detriment to pre-existing users before we dont need to bother with them
you knew he had already done shit to wfs, that is basis enough
we didnt even need to, honestly
you recall how we gave bwen the boot. he had a history harassing a user here, and we gave them the boot for it
the second: well, bwen
when there are visible plans for raids and you either can see them or can deduce they are occurring by an abnormal amount of traffic into the server or by specific people working with each other to cause a stir
for the first one:
ill give examples for each
```1. if they are actively targeting our server by either getting details on users to doxx or just preparing something hostile
2. if they have harassed users in the past before (bwen)
3. if they are reported directly to us for hostile behavior in places we cannot see. this one is important, and sometimes it crops up```
i outlined when
yes. legislative discussion in which i have been teaching these concepts to the both of you, after a long yelling match a few days prior about it
there is a very big difference between being in a position to enforce rules, and being in the position to make them
there is a difference between being responsible and reasonable and having the experience to handle it. these are mutually exclusive concepts. its not a matter of distrust that i say you dont have the experience for it, in my opinion. its a matter of not having been here long enough, or having this much experience doing this to begin with
dont type, drive
***HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! CAPE ETERNAL! CAPE FOREVER!***
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVSyv3sHOs
YES! FINALLY! I HAVE THE MEANS! NO MORE SYMPHOGEAR! NO MORE HIBIKI! ONLY CAPE! CAPE FOREVER!
***SLAMS THE MANDATORY CAPE UNIFORM BUTTON***
`R, without limits...`
sorta like that.
you know that scene after hibiki comes out from the cocoon and has to be subdued with large military grade electrical ass clamps
and while i can probably provide that, the raw power i would display would be like
sure
that is true i suppose
why latooni
interesting
itll help a lot instead of spending time going through all this
feel free to write up the outline and then ill polish it with the draft
yeah
yeah
ill get down on it for serious this weekend
ill have to add that into the internal rules draft thing
thats good
thats fine
im just saying its usually the norm in a lot of internet communities for bad reasons
im not disagreeing with you
most of the communities ive been have had a lot of mods, whether chosen abritrarily, for favoritism, or just because
here's a solid statistic: alice, you proved previously that the valkryie discord is actually lower in traffic than us, yeah?
it is, but also again: most communities are incompetent
people constantly bitching and moaning
most communities are garbage and poorly run, so you have problems every day
we dont need that many because there arent many problems
10-15, roughly
15
most communities with that amount of active members have like
its the norm
6 staff is nothing
probably like 1 for each
not many for this place though
and more mods
more admins
its not a bad solution but it usually needs a thicker hierarchy of power to do
that they very much deserve and has gotten some solid results despite it
as youll probably learn about soon
usually my anger comes less at people here and more from incompetence in other places
i have been working on it
hehe
this is probably a lot to take in latooni. if you need some time to process it, dont hesitate to ask
it mainly consists of things, and me yelling at those things
there is a lot we're going to brief you on over time.
trust me
we have so much to tell you
oh yes
welcome to the shitshow
_squats_
saying it like that makes me a grandpa
im down
yeah sure
real life is more important.
i like you but it is honestly true, you're hardly here which is understandable
sorry lyssa
yeah
plus lyssa is hardly here
make it happen
sure.
i know
fun fact: when alice offered me a moderator position here, so long ago, i actually declined it
the reason i hesitate taking the position is because despite me acknowledging my strengths in this position, i also understand my flaws and worry that those flaws will get in the way of making good decisions
im not saying this to belittle you or say that you aren't worthy of the position in time, saki. im just saying that it takes a lot to make rules fairly as opposed to enforcing them, and that takes experience and pressure to do. ive said it before: its a punishing job. it is thankless.
its all good
dont worry i got the intention
that were deffered to me to make
`like`***`so`***
(technically yes you can by breaking the ` in the middle and re-adding it)
interesting turnout
alright
it is hard not to be angry with the things that crop up
i weigh in a lot on things because i am mostly just laying what i know on the table
that too
and sure
- the one person with community experience under their belt who also cant keep their temper for 5 seconds when seeing other servers
- person who is not here for big real life reasons
- newly vetted moderator who is good with bots
- hopeless optimist who is still learning how to moderate things while owning a server
and our current team is made up of
yes.
yeah
...which is admittedly everyone here
only if its people i trust
```The question I have to ask is when you're at your worst, can you trust people enough to listen to them when they tell you you're crossing a line?```
yeah that was me yelling at them for basically making me do their job for them
and man oh man the shit we've had to put up with has made everyone's blood boil here
unfortunately i also dont hesitate to resort to them
im not afraid to show my weaknesses
you should probably show latooni log samples of me at my worst to really get the message through
i took it up here because i love this place with all my heart, as sappy as it sounds.
to the extent where i am actually wary of taking on staff roles
ive seen and felt and been through many things
roleplay communities. gaming communities. communities centered around an indie game. combinations of the such.
for context: i used to be a mod for the minecraft forums when i was 16 for several years and then did 1-2 year stints in several online communities spanning several contexts
yes, exactly
and i get ***angry***
i guess my tendency for control comes with the knowledge that i know what im doing but i worry there will come a time where i steamroll someone who is right because i am too mired in my ways
more or less when it comes to doing online community things. its not something i carry with me in real life nor its something i do contextually outside of anything except running communities
i have a very strong 'my way or the highway' attitude, and it has not backfired so far because i have the most experience doing community things out of everyone here
its more that i worry that with the elevation of authority i will be less receptive to feedback and more... leadery, but coupled with the angry bits, it could potentially risk devolving into me being bossy
that isnt exactly my concern per say
thats fine
it was as good a plan as we could think of
tomorrow it is.
why the server exists, etc
the whole history with valkyrie and stuff
im leaning towards tomorrow since i sleep soon
also <@!127644949884698624> should we tell latooni everything thats happened thus far and get them up to speed now or tomorrow
saki's gonna prep some bot things and i will be hosting it since ive hosted mafia on IRC/Discord before
the big thing i teased is a game of mafia
yes latooni
the discord is a shared admin chat between the /sgg/ discord and the valkryie discord
cape is cape forever
nah
`My blackened cape... is turning GOLD...`
`This power...`
`Dorito...`
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRWbIoIR04c
has green dorito
because illuminati
dorito status
yes
latooni can have dorito status
ill vote for you the next time this comes around, and ill make it a point to teach you everything i know.
dont worry saki
he had a close tie with using cloudcost that seems to have died down. he would actively post articles at botlike speeds on given days, and then go quiet for several months
in order of popularity no less
youll see them all
if you click on the view more tab on the communities he runs
https://www.reddit.com/user/soiguessthisisit
i wouldn't be surprised if this is how r/symphogear came to be
soiguess is a poweruser on reddit who sports the foundation of over 200 subreddits, who actively registers subreddits for things that are preparing to come about in the hopes that they will become popular and spur users which he can be in charge of
im serious.
one of the biggest things we maintain here is to ***not contact them for any reason whatsoever***
something youll notice if you look very closely in the subreddit is that its founder is called soiguessthisisit
https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/new/
so
strap in, latooni. this will be a long one.
im going to start from the very beginning, which is how alice managed to gain authority in the subreddit (since thats really important to cover) and go all the way from there into the present
alright
i hate to cut this talk short but it is now officially briefing time for latooni
`I am now fully operational.`
`I hunger for egg...`
All this talk of egg makes me hungry...
When I get on my pc `It's briefing time`
I awaken
of course, the consequences of me being aggressive to them is that our relationship is more strained now
i hope they kept me in mind.
i hope they sweated every hour of that moment.
i hope it was
i yelled at the staff so hard they spent a whole week in deliberation on what to do until they cracked under pressure and demoted her.
i am the reason why she was demoted.
that was quinn
if you remember the time DL was talking about a certain user was harassing her about her art style
successfully so, in fact.
but yeah, i could go on and on. the point is they did a lot of shitty things and when i got wind of it i resolved to really make their lives as miserable as possible.
alright
i spent 2 days explaining to you why quinn could not do anything to you and why her threats were garbage
you explicitly told me you were
- exclusion and hostility from users in the valkryie server against her going largely ignored by moderators
- constant abuse and belittlement ranging from leaving her out of rule discussion and treating her like an idiot to specific mods harassing her and threatening her with very stupid threats to the point where she was AFRAID of a given moderator (who has now long since been demoted)
stemming from:
then i was made aware of the things the valkryie server had done to alice
anyway. despite my hesitation, i became a mod to this place and basically gave it a good kick in the ass and got it active, slowly but surely. aiming towards cultivating niche interests while promoting this place to be asshole free and the like, and making activities and fostering interaction and things to do amongst users.
right now im just covering the events as they are
ill also get there
lemme just cover the history first
i will
`And then I came into the picture...`
as a result, this place was dead for a while
even though alice successfully split away from the server, she was still overshadowed by valkryie's activity. this was to be expected; valkryie had an entire headstart in cultivating its userbase that should have rightfully belonged to a subreddit orietned community
to keep going...
july
im not good with timeframes, alice you fill in for that one
anyway
ah
you got some from quinn
this was, in retrospect, the best move she would have ever done
the valkryie server showed no desire to remain consistent to the ruleset established in the subreddit while also wearing the name of the subreddit on its collar. coupled with hostility and threats from specific staff members, alice would proceed to gain the raw cojones to actually make her own discord server and split away from valkryie because of this. she caught a lot of flak from them for basically asserting back control of her own community that she should have been allowed to have more influence in to begin with, and so this discord was born.
initially, the valkryie server was a nameless server khairz created that was offered to the subreddit community many moons ago as an affiliated symphogear discord. conveniently, despite posing as The Official Subreddit Discord (having even had the name Subreddit Discord for a while), they never truly believed themselves to be a part of the subreddit community. alice was propped to a moderator-like position that was treated as a title only position despite her running the subreddit itself and from there a lot of friction on how to moderate emerged.
the real friction youll see is with the valkryie server
as i lovingly call him, the king of shit mountain
symphogi is the owner of the /sgg/ discord
yeah
we dont have beef with them because for all of their tremendously deep flaws (which are many) they at least have their shit together and are consistent amongst themselves
you are probably already familiar with /sgg/ but to reiterate it, they are the 4chan shitters. we have ties with them because the majority of yamete tomete, the people who plan to make subs for symphogear stuff in the future, are primarily comprised of /sgg/ members
as you know, there are three primary servers for symphogear that have the biggest coverage. in order of size its the valkryie server, our server, and /sgg/
now that's out of the way, we can move on to the server relations bit
never, ever, ***ever*** message him
he is a poweruser and not our friend
he is the biggest achilles heel of the community. no matter how well we ever run things, we always run the risk of someone having sufficient brain cells and enough malice to just pm this person and ruin everything.
he has no real interest running any of the communities he has. he delegates them all to the first person who speaks. this is how alice managed to end up having the same set level permissions as him. she literally just asked. he can also demote people on a whim just because.
the biggest threats are soiguess, or valkryie contacting soiguess (they wont, they dont know about it except for khairz)
the biggest conflict outside of here is playing nice with the two other servers, which isn't hard except for valkryie `who are idiots`
nothing major really happens here because we usually resolve them quickly and effectively
now you know.
but yeah
rule 5 is a default in literally every online community out there, amusingly
actually you say that one, you're more familair with it innately
oh wait the valk- yeah
what was the rule revision thing, that was me doing the internal rules stuff yeah
did i leave anything out...
anyway, now you're up to speed
yeah.
yep
ironically, im still helping in an event they have
im there to keep an eye on their stupidity and thats honestly enough
we dont care if you're there or not
they likely are on bad terms with alice because they probably still feel the split was a bad move, and they are likely on bad terms with me because god forbid i just cant be nice to them all the time, forever.
which is funny, given that i literally give them the answers to their community problems and they literally ignore them, so
valkryie staff dont trust us because thanks to me constantly giving them headaches, they probably think i do and say these things with the intention to belittle and/or sabotage them
anyway
that makes 'em bigger.
yeah but in terms of numbers they have 700 over our 400
they only thing they have over us is a higher user count.
they are completely tone deaf to the needs of their own community, have repeatedly shown no interest in improving their users behavior, have distrust from their own users on resolving the problems within the server, and have actively antagonized, doubted, and ignored the few people who ***did*** care about it
we dont trust the valkryie server because they have historically, empirically shown themselves unable to enforce the rules they have on their server. their own users treat them as jokes and shit on them while also basically either telling them to shut up, belittle them, or basically just ignore them by sidetracking and moving the conversation away from them. the server as a whole has grown more bitter as a result, being flooded with toxicity to such an extent where its become 4chan lite, except dumber.
oh
i tweeted it on a junk twitter account
knight looks good
i dunno man
how do i vote again and where
ah, yeah
if not, ban.
if they show remorse, chance
channer arrogance is something most channers carry with until the day they die.
i dont think they will.
if they ever want to rejoin and ask why they got the boot, we'll tell them
nothing will happen. they're /sgg/ shitters wholl just grumble in their corner and circlejerk until their dicks fall off.
whats done is done
no they stay out
jokes on him though, he's gonna be an anituber and will be raked through the coals for it
he's too dedicated into become his own anituber brand to really care about others and ive given him shit about it in the past
sure
even then i wouldnt lose sleep not letting him in
johnny is the only one i would be a bit more lenient on from the whole list because he is the only one on that list willing to listen. he is basically wien but less talkative.
xaxas never sets foot here. his views are more complicated because they come from systemic culturual oppression and masculinity that comes with south american traditions (im cuban, i live it) but he is pretty much garbage
bisa is a moron. im fine with them not setting foot. their raw stupidity constantly stirs shit up and theyre the source for a couple fights in valkyrie because they cant really seem to process that theyre shitting on things in a server devoted to them
rosael is pol tier opinions. ive seen them in action once or twice, its garbage
riya i agree with, like goddamn
`latooni miku`
latooni miku
yep
injoke dating back to valkryie about joking that chris is actual chris yukine
that is literally just them joking.
chris and joe are not in an actual relationship
the curse of a niche community
everything is going accordingly
khairz will never win, though. mainly because he is too addled in anime garbage to truly assert things getting done
wherein khairz and bingo wrestle over what should be done
depending on how things go it can go from "shit you're right" or "khairz dont talk ever again" and even potentially escalate to a full on power struggle
planting the seeds of suggestion into someone like khairz means they will have to hear it from him for better or worse
pressure accumulates over time
let it simmer
nah
im a sucker for alliterations
i like latooni's title
good morning
It's a different story in valkryie
They have the exact amount of brain cells to understand this and have seen our example that we do not tolerate it to keep it in check
No one is above the rules
Latter
Thankfully we enforce the community well enough where these people don't feel empowered and keep their fucking mouths shut
Comes with being a part of /sgg/
Most if not all of them except maybe Joe are similar in thought
If you read up on discussions and see me debate about how why we don't also throw out yamete tomete, this is why
Yep
Mhm
And I got a bunch of lovely responses of "yuri isn't real"
To which I vehemently pointed out he's literally in a server that shipped gay pairings hardcore
Once got in an argument long ago in valkryie where Chris talked about the vote in Australia for gay marraige and talked about not voting
Chris is a closeted homophobe
Also that's not shocking
Founder
Yes
she doesnt look as cool.
...eh
what
`BECAUSE CLEARLY`
LOOK IF THEY CAN CALL THAT NIPPLE-ERECT SCANTILY CLAD UNBLEMISHED SUPPLE THIGH TOTING CYBORG A CORPSE I CAN CLAIM MY LACK OF HORNINESS ALL I WANT
absolutely no horny here
no
but otherwise
for research
i would have to read that to confirm that the corpse is doing corpse things
i mean
really double checking thats a corpse
just... you know
no horny on main to be displayed here
there is no fucking on my mind
no, no no
`are you sure`
that its a corpse
double checking
no no im just, yknow
are you sure
are you telling me that is a corpse
latooni
a corpse with robot parts
Tell them to just not use the emoji
Not telling others to kill themselves
The context is a suicide joke
Eugh
Oh it's that emoji
Preferably just making it a stern "don't do that" since getting preachy about it comes off as condescending
Latoonis stance basically
Discouraged
nice
which is a good catchall for whatever other weird shit crops up
yeah, while SONG deals with noise, theyre introduced in season 3 as a general paranormal agency
probably would set up another server for it
id rather it be a seperate thing from the server entirely
no
i dont mind handling another person's setting but i do better with my own things since i worry ill fuck it up some way
the question is would you want to keep going with using saki's setting or would you want me to `create my own experience from scratch`
i actually have a lot of rp experience and ive hosted sessions before in terms of freestyle rp
i would be fine with this
`Who Killed Shirabe?`
also id be down to host some symphogear rp `that is small`
did you ever get far into the setting's story to use... `you know`
wait saki
Also yeah if someone tells another person to kill themselves that's an autokick
If they use it again after they're gone
it would be too much porn that would kill shirabe
precisely.
yes
lets move all this talk to the other channel/server since this is a `staff channel for staff things`
im not a big fan about lying about rolls so id rather people tell me honestly so i can judge and go "wow, that roll sucks, im overturning it" in a given moment
but ultimately things usually tend towards one direction, so that people feel like things are leading up to something, as opposed to them happening hap-hazardly
usually when i devise narratives during combat i file for both failure and success in mind
like... oocly dumb to the point of self-sabotage in the session
those wont happen unless you purposefully act very dumb
nobody dies in my sessions without explicit permission
usually how i do it is rolls during combat with appropriate modifiers made up on the fly
i may use dice, but very liberally
yeah its freeform
ive done rp without roll20 unless you guys really wanna do that
just make a channel for our rp shenanigans only we can see
sure that works
couple that with my worry of mishandling a setting im hardly familiar with despite `pitching some ideas` and it might not end well
well the thing is itd be a bit weird if there were 2 sessions going on with different copies of the same setting
in fact if i do this yall can keep going with your session
of course
mine is the same way.
thats moms for ya
yeah
oh
at least your brother seems to sorta understand
thats par for the course with parents
its hip to fuck `birds`
pickle on a burg
chicken on a raft
ah, okay
does this make me the only cis staff member in this community
wait
i voted priest
this is exactly the kind of stuff that should be talked about
nah
`:o)`
`Goddamned clown...`
it was just an amusing pic from hxh where that damn clown asshole is walking around on the phone ass out and mentions its july 10th which is today
oh true
not too much
it has to be manually set it up but yeah
despite the risk assessment, im confident it can be handled
do not worry, latooni
i dont think it will happen to an extent where its big but the threat is very much there
yep.
quinn is an avid redditor despite her own self loathing and she definitely has an axe to grind with us
i worry some of the more curmudgeon members of /sgg/ and valkryie will shittalk us and itll go down as one big fiasco wherein they will never touch us again
anyway, yeah
k
just read what i @ you about
its more the users that concern me
the staff are idiots but they wont sink that low. even hecate wont do it.
and by the valkryie server, i dont mean the staff
is whether or not the valkryie server will badmouth the subreddit server and the subreddit itself visibly purposefully
now, my ACTUAL concern, which is something i brought up in brief with pittman and why im asking to group together in counsel with him
as long as no one tells him to demod people, we're good
whether or not soiguess spots the symphogear subreddit getting activity is irrelevant. he will never interfere in something that nets him more under a subreddit he owns on paper.
in order thats alice, lyssa, me, and saki
thatd never happen
yeah there's no subreddit mods from valk
none that i know of
in r/anime?
we're not worried about soiguess
relax, saki
?
<@!127644949884698624> do i have the okay to make a channel for pittman now so we can talk to him together
```
Pittman66 - Today at 12:09 AM
(Sorry if I don't respond immediately, it's late but wanted to send this before I forget in the moring). So I definetely want to do a community spotlight with you guys (Since I know you guys and are active within the community along with an airing season later), what we're discussing right now is whether to tie in a community spotlight with our new Weekly Discussion thread that's posted on Wednesday, which Symphogear would be the first to do this. This would mean that the community spotlight for /r/Symphogear would be posted the weekend before Symphogear Series discussion thread is posted on Wednesday, giving the opportunity for the community to show off and prep for the discussion thread (and re-advertise the community spotlight in the discussion thread), and hopefully boost the popularity of both thread series. If approved, it'll likely be the community spotlight on July 28th, and the Discussion thread August 1st. After the Yuru Camp one (assuming you guys approve), I'll send out a questionaire asking for individual mod responses and an intro like you likely have seen with the previous community spotlights. 
Sorry it's a lot of info at once and I may not be responding immedietely, but if you have questions regarding any other this, please don't be hesitant to ask and just message me. And even if we decide not to do the tie in, I'll still do a community spotlight with you guys.
Rakoczi - Today at 12:11 AM
interesting
the staff want to talk this out as a group but i will relay them this information now```
**TRANSMITTING DATA...**
**CAPE SIGNAL NOISES...**
im not saying "i want him to pm me so i can solely tell him everything", im saying "i want him to pm me so i can divert him to us and give him the proper schpiel"
i know
he will understand.
pittman's a good person, though
hence why im more "hey pm me when you do!" so we can safely divert him and go "so here's the thing..."
i just want to vet pitman out and make sure `he doesnt think about tossing in valkryie in this`
i know
the terms we want him to agree to are the following:
alright
its simple
of course the emphasis is that it needs to go right.
i personally feel that if this goes right, coupled with the support of our own community, it could boost us to valkryie levels.
no ambiguity. the terms are clear, and anything less is bad faith on their part.
this is not something you ease someone to. this is something you put on the table, and make it clear is needed for the event to function.
we make him agree to the specifics then and there
no
except specificity is key
we need to tell him
what we need to propose to him is moderating terms to help keep an eye out for problems while we, on our end, drown out problems with our own community
(its a mainstream anime community, its to be expected)
that too
i mean this isnt bad but this is not the question to pose
no
"but R! the r/anime mods can handle-" no they wont. mods dont enforce anything thats not under the rules. a dissenting opinion against a community is not against the rules.
very much yes.
your typical otaku always believes themselves to be counterculture. whenever a dissenting opinion manifests, whether it be true or not, is already potential for something advertising something to go awry. whether it works or not varies on the competence of the execution. do i think valkryie is competent enough to do this? no. do i think the users are dumb and malicious enough to start a chain that leads to this conclusion?
end result is the thread is undermined and another community is advertised wherein ours shouldve had the spotlight.
anyway
well i guess there's not much there to begin with so whatever
what
it piles up. people chime in. people scurry away. someone advertises valk on the thread.
thread goes up. people are cool and chill. we're talking about symphogear. user comes up, likely nameless or an account under a name we dont recognize. maybe its a throwaway so we never know who it is. they go "yeah, symphogear's pretty cool but this community really isnt". people stop and ask "well, why?" there's no rules to saying whether a community sucks or not. people on r/anime, much like any other generic community, support free speech. from there, other users go "yeah this community really sucks, i left it after a day lol".
okay
and would probably say "hey, symphogear's great but, dont join that community lol"
there are problem users, but there are also other users who just flat out dont like us
except the problem is broader than just "a problem user"
instead of waiting until something happens at the last moment
it shows that we have genuine concerns that should be addressed on the table before this happens
except no moderator would immediately agree to keeping an eye on a user without first asking why. presenting the why is good faith
he has to for the sake of moderating. this is the nature of being proactive
it /is/ necessary
in order to give context for our concerns
just that it happened
its not necessary
i dont want to tell him the amount of harassment that happened and detail every story to him
that is because i also do not want to flood him with information thats irrelevant to him
```but you and Alice were just discussing how much to say, in front of him
so the exact scope was not being discussed entirely in private```
i am, and we are
at least /something/
he's gotta know
but if he is going to do community stuff with us, and if there is a risk in said community stuff wherein folks will fuck with us because we're a server with a large trans demographic who has literally had to twist arms to get what it wants against assholes
look i understand people dont need to know about these things and i am not trying to implicate pittman in this garbage
i thought we did?
its upvoting their responses
and its not just telling them to post
this is the other half, OUR half of what we need to do
this is completely seperate from everything else
when the day rolls around, we gotta pump our users to rep for us
its this two-fold strategy that turns this from a proactive measure that makes sure the worst of it is dealt with, and an airlocked measure where `nothing happens, period.`
yes. preventative measures are good. they are extremely important. but SHOULD THEY FAIL, even slightly: this is how we disseminate what happens
`At the very bottom, overshadowed by the rest of the thread.`
where do you find this response?
one person, presumably a sourpuss, has a dissenting opinion about said community

now, scroll to the very bottom
people dont like the show. but the community? seems nice, from the testimony of its users
sword art online community spotlight.
https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7lcd2m/community_spotlight_rswordartonline/
here's an example
look. so there's a two part element to this that needs to work together for the execution to be proper. the first part, we just resolved; putting what we want on the table to make this function to resolve possible external issues that may arise in doing so. but the secondary element, which is just as important and works hand in hand with the first part, is having OUR community talk about THEIR experiences in the subreddit/discord. this is important because 1. it helps establish a foundational opinion of people who are active in the server that can give positive testimonies towards our community and 2. ***drowns out any attempts of negative opinions if a dissenting one were to appear for a given reason***
`please let me talk`
no i know but this is a seperate thing
it is, but its not enough. let me explain.
obviously if someone's being a dick we report it, but thats like basic stuff
and im not saying we dont help them
its more a strategic underpinning of getting people to do something for us
its not exactly us
but bear with me, as i said that there is also a community element part into this
it will sound paradoxical
well, actually...
that works
no fun police
ill unpin it later...
its so good...
i know... but...
advertising a sub and then advertising other, non-sub places is inherently disingenous
none of the other threads advertise other communities
id like it if they werent advertised period
feel free to add in the no slurs bit
yeah
sure
```The reason we're hesitating in immediately participating in this is because we worry that the prior friction from the server split alongside negative opinion from other users outside of the community from the other servers may devolve the thread into less of an appreciation and rejuventation of the Symphogear Subreddit and more of a warning post of keeping users from coming to this community, advertising the other in it's stead. Because of this, we'd really appreciate if you could do the following measures to make sure this doesn't happen:```
```
- Keep an eye out for users who begin to insult the subreddit and it's discord for undefined reasons. There are also users in specific we'd like you to keep an eye out for.
- Make sure other Discords and Communities aren't advertised (I don't know if you already have a rule that covers this for thread topics)
- Make sure there isn't offensive talk against the LGBT culture in the server (there are a high number of trans individuals in our community)
```
```We would deeply appreciate if you could do this.```
alright
oh.
i know.
i know
WEEKS, working with alice, framing the answers as efficiently and as relevant as possible
at bot speeds!
SHOWING IT. ***making*** it clear that fucking prick was sitting around doing jackall claiming subreddits like a fucking machine
alice should still have it somewhere.
i made a damn spreadsheet. i did statistical fucking analysis.
so many months compiling evidence
damned dumb rules...
we'll play it by the dumb rules.
fine
valkryie has never invested in a splinterboard and likely never will
i cannot have respect for a place and its rules when its fundamentally broken
you and i know full well that we both worked together to make every plea possible to the site admins and it failed
im not hiding against any experience
whats a splinterboard
i wont suggest it again for your sake.
i care not for the rules of a major social media site when our initial endeavor in utilizing it as fairly as possible against someone who actively exploits the nature of its existence ended in complete failure.
i doubt a siteadmin will care for it
i dont care for them. soiguess exists as a testament to its failure, and im not really above bending and breaking whatever it takes to get things done.
but i. wont get upset by it.
shutting me out when i have had the most drive to get this done between all of us seems a little bit out of left field and leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth
yes
also please do not be passive aggressive saki when i am trying to be as not angry as possible
i have not said that? i am just posting plans we will undertake if its agreed to
how am i jumping the gun
but... okay then
because i felt it was a relevant point to make?
we can post and just let it run its natural course
things dont need manipulating if everything goes well
yes, but there's a degree
if bad comments arent moderated then the second move is to drown them out
the reason this comes up is because if we're unable to contribute anything to moderate for whatever reason, this is our secondary go-to move
oh, that
I WANT TO BUILD MY HOUSES ON THE PROPERTIES
i want the trifecta
honestly i want to replace ryokou's appearance with marias
the fanfiction. the events. the artist corner. the daily art posts. the shitposting. all of it.
honestly this is where all the shit we've been working on gets to shine
that works too
noted
little more than two weeks, basically
16 days
july 28th
_checks date_
we've got time, this goes down...
if you want, sure
something something come talk about how great symphogear is and your experiences in the community so we can get more people into symphogear
global ping, subreddit post
this is important because in the event their moderating isnt enough, engaging the users will be the first line of defense towards dealing with these issues in a `non rule breaking manner.`
if he says yes we sorta just sit until the day comes and do the interviews and stuff. when the day hits we make sure we engage our users into it as much as possible, whether through testimonies, positive opinions, or general good rep.
okay
he cannot message that man on any circumstance
yeah mention that too
yes from me
i already said yes so im good
and... fine.
it angers me so much
people trying to defend themselves after the rules having failed them getting banned for having the audacity to utilize that feature for that purpose in the first place
it just boils my blood
unless the subreddit role is no longer a staff role and just a distinguishing title
seems strange they wont show them to you given you're literally technically still part of their staff
oh
also what have i said in the past that didnt happen
ive always wanted option a and honestly they wont even notice if its there
nothing much really

`All is going accordingly to keikaku...`
that is why it satisfies me to see these responses
to go "hey, these people seem to have some cool ideas, and that gives /me/ cool ideas, too!"
the end goal behavior is to have more people write things, and feel inspired to write and do things
thats the reinforcement, not the end goal behavior
but also the principle of doing this isnt only to just compile written stuff and pin it to the fridge
late submissions wont be accepted, this is pretty obvious
***DISCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORD, IM HOWLIN AT THE MOON***
***KICKS DISCORD REPEATEDLY***
if i do, there's no FUCK YOIU DISCORD
if i do, there's no lists
if i do, there's no lists
just for this one only
nah
***HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA***
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIGX6q2o1aM
darling solopy believes that this particular submission was sent in by zbd, and i told him yes, `him unaware that zbd never sent a submission to begin with`
fun fact: the writing topic discussion variety hour also doubles as the "torture the speculators who think they know who wrote it" variety hour
Despite our progress, which is a lot, this is still an anime server
The garbage fires do not shock me
Pain is fading... I can think a bit more clearly now
I see
Very interesting
Keep an eye on him
Interesting
Seems strange someone who usually doesn't talk comes out of nowhere to say things that historically have been talked about and had a conclusion reached on them on the server
The guy Alice warned
They remind me of Rukia
Who is Carneg
*okay
Okau
Par for the course sadly, dude screams weeb
God forbid hibiki feels any emotion outside of happy
Someone is angry
you will get more mileage against valk reminding people we're not valk when theyre frustrated and they dont need to stay there, as opposed to letting them stew in their own negativity about it
also remember that its important as staff to be positive role models. bitching is not conducive; reminding people we're not them is
good riddance.
anyway fuck bingo BACK TO RP
oh
he didnt need to know that
you probably should not have told him about r/anime
whatever hurts more.
i would prefer gripping them to action than letting them get accustomed to ripping band-aids
because leverage is better than just doing it
sure
and that alice cannot correct me if she doesnt have the evidence at hand to do so
you should probably pressure him by reminding him that a lack of logs breeds misinformation
yeah- well
im not against a second one right now since the communities grown since then
at the time, one felt needed
jump out of it
it feels strange to have lily's awesome porn art pop up in the middle of a serious conversation about writing. i dont really have any conflict with it now, but say when im back on campus for my final classes and im talking in fancontent and she posts porn; i sorta have to immediately just
this is more me addressing an overall trend
note: this is not me conceding kalik's point of view
to be honest, fancontent is pretty much on the foremost of this. have you noticed that a lot of nsfw content has died down in it, except for lily's occasional posts, which are great but feel off place?
people wont feel the need to be more overtly nsfw because of a sort of receding tide socially. because less nsfw is being shown, less is being encouraged
this encourages a slow, gradual change towards overt nsfw habits into healthier, softer habits while better containing nsfw material more efficiently
we incorporate alice's definition (which is honestly the most "pure" definition of nsfw as that was the initial point of the establishment of its term) as the de facto of our standards. on top of this, we regularly check channels for their nsfw content ratio; the ones at a given minority of nsfw content as relabeled as sfw, and whatever nsfw was being made there is escorted to the <#336297808221044736> channel
okay.
test
one that not only handles terminology, but also normalization
thanks discord.
i have a more complex and thorough solution
Sure
I agree with alice
Googly aballytic
You may want to @ everyone if it's a community survey
*?
You got a survey ready
Go for it
Sometimes rejection of an idea is more frustrating to a community as a whole then just establishing our own vision and rolling with it
Do you want people like Dragon and people who feel similarly like Dragon to feel empowered by us humoring an opinion without judgement and say `some very bad ideas`
I don't know if I can trust an anime communities taste on what they feel is sfw or not
we've never had consistent nsfw standards outside of 'keep nudity in nsfw marked channels' because we have a habit of actively and visibly talking about nsfw things even in places that wouldnt or probably shouldnt be the case; the collusion of a lot of nsfw materials with places that arent usually nsfw in the first place also spreads to normalize this
`ironically`
thats the best one.
yeah, what alice said about things you dont want your boss to see.
oh right
...what started this discussion again
i forward that motion
alright
but
but
itd be the equivalent of kiri running to us and then hitting a glass door
CAPE!
no i mean kirichan
wait this doesnt break the bot right
i suppose this is true
yeah but then the pretty art thats sfw doesnt get seen
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
and then tell people to be careful with it
we unembed the link
but
we could allow nsfw content in fancontent
alternatively
`she's just that good`
before fancontent existed
to be fair, lily way back when still got coverage in nsfw regardless
yeah, go for it
you mean just asking her input
oh
yeah but it should be done more officially
if we do it, we gotta go all in
that wouldnt be fair to her to exclude her like that
no
because yall are horny on main, goddamnit.
that kind of slow receding style can very much benefit the community right now
but yeah
yeah
maybe wantfastcars? has he written anything lately
...
You did...?
I
I wish I had people to fuck around with on gmod
a smut cosplayer, thatd be the day
is that a portugese rush b
what is a por b
THE `PENCIL` IS GOOD. THE PENIS IS EVIL.
yeah that one is good
i think we should ruminate on it until we get a better idea
i...
_quickly gets the infinity gauntlet_
***WE'VE GOT TO BAN ANIME.***
EVERYONE...
OF COURSE. THE SOLUTION... IT'S SIMPLE.
i am on my last functioning neuron so i am just going to meditate on this by fucking around in gmod
a lot of xdu content would be ruled out too
actually yeah thats a good point
i made sure to slip in smaller maps
it shouldnt be too bad with the mod/map choices
its why i usually try to find people to play with, as opposed to making my own server
as far as i know, i cant host for beans
and again, if you have any mod suggestions, go for it
i will be able to drive people around in buses again
anyway tell me when hosting is ready so that we may `party with gmod` and latooni is invited
hee hee hee
yall are wild
`Here lies Sakimori, former Homestuck trash.`

no
we're talking complete annhilation
because i found something that will absolutely destroy you in one blow
do you want me to murder you in one blow
also saki
also it doesn need shenanigans i think
there's actually a portal gun mod for gmod `but dont install it it runs like trash`
sent an invite saki
`We must get a server going.`
...
also gimmie your steam handle
tell me
if you have any mods to suggest and/or add to this list
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1440368393 <@!102691114762371072>
i sorted them through
alright
ALRIGHT
`i have it`
i know it does
im including... `the best of the best...`
...making this pack will take a while
alright im making a modpack
very much so
oh it does
Lemme make a good modpack
Yay
I just want to do stupid shit with someone in gmod
Oh
The problem is always hosting
`do you want to fuck around on gmod with me`
no, but
i am deeply conflicted saying a thing
also understandably frustrating
i know, understandably so
but i am genuinely hesitant bringing it up
the problem is a bit more deep rooted
i will give him the benefit of the doubt and say he is refering to it in the platonic sense because if i go down the alternate road its going to not end well
mmm...

because `mine can, and it cant handle a lot of things`
your pc can handle gmod
oh wait i have to redownload it
YES
`But difficult to master...`
yeah RoR is easy to download
id be down for risk of rain though i havent played in eons
`but but but gmod...`
ive always wanted to play risk of rain with someone again
YOU HAVE RISK OF RAIN
but...
that one is fun
the only real mod you probably will have to be careful with is the directional gravity mod
there is one mod i slipped in that actually allows NPC spawning via info-nodes, which is hit or miss depending on whether a map has info nodes on it (most do for the choices)
and the mods are very light on processing, and the npcs shouldnt chug as long as there arent many
alright
that works
sure
always gotta be one step ahead of these things
best to wipe the evidence, yes?
except if we tell people its for the discord tos, we'll be reminding them they have the means to report us over these things. if someone is annoyed that their loli garbage is gone, and decide to take it out on us...
if it still exists in nsfw, we'd need to delete to make sure thats not the case
since the principle would be based on us doing it so discord doesnt gank us
if we say its for the discord tos we have no choice but to
id be interested to hear saki's and latooni's side of it
probs should delete and renew nsfw after the rule is deployed
yeah
i got a headache now, a little bit
anyway... thats pretty much all i got to say
yeah
(it doesnt happen sadly)
it wouldve been nice if he and nero in septem spoke for reals and sat down trading perspectives
thats the good shit people want
he is but he exists for all the wrong reasons
discords have been deleted in the past for these things
that is the short solution and im not against it, just be ready for any big whiplash
yall doubted me with barack obama and i pulled through
i know its real, though
im still looking for it
nearly every memoria depicition of shirabe and/or kirika, the worst one being them literally in bed looking like theyre gonna fuck
i suppose another direction you can take is reinforcing this and pulling it off like a band-aid saying that we read up on discord's tos and realized that this directly threatens the intergrity of our discord and we risk deletion due to this
also true
it isnt impossible. its just a tremendous amount of effort.
this is the biggest obstacle to substantializing and hardening this rhetoric, because you will face being undermined by the very content you enjoy
"well, why does a community say sexualizing minors is bad, when the show does it? does the show support bad things?"
the hardest obstacle to deploying this form of enforcement is specifically the media in which we're surrounded on. people will not take easily to this due to the fact that the show itself, alongside its corresponding media, depicts it. this is a clash of ideologies.
then eventually, when you can sense that your community's overall census is "sexualizing and talking about minors sexually isnt okay", you make harder rules and purge them all out.
its difficult. usually in these situations you would want to facilitate a multi point, gradual solution when gradually changing and shaping the unhealthy mentalities of people in a community. you would first want to get the change to be small, and in writing. rules always cement verdict. something small like "nsfw also covers sexualized talk of characters; take all discussion about it there". you always want to herd the offenders together and make them feel constricted, and tight. then you slowly change public opinion and overturn it by participating in talking with the community when it comes up, and make your point clear to everyone, and have others agree with you. this makes it clear the people with the offending thought dont feel welcome or need to understand that they have to change their ways or else theyll feel unwelcome.
and im telling you that a larger part of the community thanks to how we deal those things will not only cause backlash walking on eggshells in either direction over this, and that potentially removing dragon on these grounds means hypocrisy on our part for having encouraged it before
alright, but who. right now despite you feeling that dragon is a potential future threat, your rhetoric brings more grounds to defending him than removing him
the fact you say this sorta cements my point
```There are a couple of images that make me more than a bit uncomfortable, but we have no policy on it so we've never done anything about them.```
under 18 is the classification of a minor, despite whatever dumb weeb likes to (mis)quote the age of consent of japan and its nature
and its this kind of thinking that defends people like dragon to begin with
there's literally no excuses to make here
alice, literally one of them is a canonical memoria too
how many nsfw arts here have had kirika look younger, or kirika and shirabe in sexual poses. how many nsfw arts posted have we had of kirika, someone you explicitly say is codified to look older, fucking or being with shirabe, someone who is explicitly codified to be much younger
for the same reasons xdu also understands this and exploits this knowledge regardless
kirika is a minor regardless of depiction and the community literally has no shame in not only acknowledging she is a minor but fetishizing it
so... there it is, on the table.
there are a lot more people you will have to show the door besides dragon in order to deal with this problem. it will not go away with dragon getting the boot. it would be hypocritical of us to do so, given we have fostered this.
dragon is but one consequence in a longstanding tradition of this, a fungus consuming what is otherwise rotten soil established by us, if not thoroughly embedded throughout the whole community. thats how a lot of anime communities are. its very rare for that ***not*** to be the case.
posted by other people who ***arent*** dragon, enjoyed by other people who ***arent*** dragon
rather, its an indictment that our enjoyment of it has fostered the creation wherein people like dragon can comfortably sit in. because, well, if we call out dragon on this, what does that make of us, participants of having done the same thing and actively consume the same content as him, if not worse? where in nsfw you constantly get dumps of shirabe and kirika and other minors in extremely fucked up sexualised poses
and i know we're responsible. we're not fucking weirdos. we're not into kids, and we dont want to fuck kids. we like seeing characters live their lives happily. this is not an indictment to having enjoyed that content in the past nor present
the biggest fandom presences around here eat it up like candy. ***we*** eat it up like candy.
and its inescapable. the show does this too. it does it a ***lot.***. it does it in xdu ***constantly***.
if we want something to be effective against someone without backlash, we need to first make it policy. its not fair to get rid of someone when its not listed in the rules nor embedded in the culture of a server or the media it represents. im not saying this to defend dragon. im more saying it because the problem is... way more rooted in how the fandom operates with the show itself. if you recall... a good majority of the cast are minors. and we, as staff, have actively encouraged in the past the shipping, sexualized depictions, romance, and content of those minors within that space. none of us are exempt from this. and i do really mean it when i say ***none of us*** are exempt from that. this is an inevitable truth that we need to embrace before tackling this problem. every single last one of us has had a hand in cultivating this culture, where someone like dragon would feel comfortable in.
here's the thing
so
i... alright. humor me a moment. im not overtly fond of dragon but this is a point we might as well discuss eventually, and its a very big one that probably needs discussion
this is not a direction we should take if we were to handle this problem but man i am really, really hesitant to make this point
i dont blame you
shes probably one of the best assassins in the game
in other words, `jack kills good`
which is exceedingly useful, since the male:female ratio of servants in this game skews heavily to women
her grail wish is literally to return to the womb and she actually has a gender advantage against all female servants.
yeah
```Once the number of aborted children who were disposed of in rivers reached the ten-thousands, the collection of resentment that the children shared eventually formed the shape of a human. Because she was created from children who had yet to even be born, she lacked common sense and morality, and simply killed prostitutes so she could return to the womb. To put it another way, this is the heretical Jack who was born from the “side of the victims”.[5]```
```Although there are numerous theories about who Jack the Ripper could have been, she is one interpretation of the series of gory murders in 19th Century England. Her true nature is that of a collection of wraiths born from the aborted children of prostitutes in Whitechapel, London. Because she is a collection of wraiths and not a single entity, piercing her heart will not lead to her immediate death, but the spillage of said wraiths.[1][5]```
yeah
the lore behind THIS jack the ripper, who is the most iconic one, is that she manifests as the unborn children within the women jack the ripper killed, sorta like an amalgmation of poltergeists of his victims given flesh.
the thing about jack the ripper in the fate series is that jack the ripper actually has various class incarnations due to the nature of his mystery; as a result, different jacks can be summoned in the interpretation of their mystery to match the many theories of jack the ripper there are. basically, every jack the ripper theory has the potential to become, in itself, a servant
her lore is cool but her design is... fucked
but she's usually shown off without it

she has a better outfit than that
that is jack the ripper

jack the ripper is a girl
and yes
because fate is garbage
alice, you never figured out who jack the ripper is, right
to be fair, i dont blame him for using- oh right
_pats medusa_
soon, she will get there
you better fucking believe i give medusa rights to kill
he's straight up my antithesis too because i have normal medusa and normal medea
yep.
ah
at what
?
sure, thats reasonable
okay
i have been feeling strong bouts of depression so im going to cope by getting something done from the list that doesnt involve intense thinking, and that will be working on the subreddit skin
take your time
thats fine
take your time
<@!99695384296701952> <@!102691114762371072> your thoughts on all this? gotta read up from what i first said down
yuh
even if it doesnt do much, the option of there being a place where people can suggest things to us is important. keeping it in the same medium shows we want people to suggest things to us directly
removing the suggestion box is a hard no.
we can talk to mami about how she got one thats more consistent
as for the subreddit feed and the suggestion box; the subreddit-feed can just be hidden until its in a more functional state
we dont do a lot of calls but general-voice is still an important channel to have regardless
music channel merge is something i suggested in the past so im down with that
`you will have to pry heiro and live shitposting from my cold, dead hands`
List em
Mostly because I tried that last time and couldnt
I think we're good
you've got to be careful reading malice in things that are otherwise explained easily through other means; its a dangerous thing to do, when you're in a position of authority
they havent even gone to college yet
theyre not so much rejecting the information as going "wow classes sorta suck"
judging from what theyve said, theyre young
i think you're misinterpreting the aggression for "well damn my studies are baloney so far"
I remember my clown cop
very, very lazy
ive been... lazy
yeah...
the list is long and i am not exempt
would pirate fine be in it
that sounds pretty damn cool
`Fufufufufu. All according to plan.`
thus, forcing others to do something different.
and people now got tired of it
and because of this, all the raw negativity (anonymously) is being presented
all of the prompts were oversaturated with suffering, as i predicted they would be, because one of the fixations after AXZ is the cliffhanger stinger of something happening involving strife between miku and hibiki
they simply experience it themselves, the consequences of a given action
communities dont need to tell people what to do
thats the beauty of a community, latooni
`All according to keikaku.`
_gently nudges pieces along fancontent_
also, meanwhile
they dont seem hostile, though
noted
i wanna try this so bad
YES
...where can i download this
i want to try this
...
yeah take your time
<@!127644949884698624> go read it
even while my parents were fighting, very loudly
i sorta focused all my mental power in this despite having a very down and depressive day
feel free to edit at your leisure
but yeah
if you need it as a pdf ill give it to ya

and i did the damn internal protocol stuff.
i got my shit together
so
and i realized that with maple 2 it was going to crunch a lot of time
between the anniversary, maple stuff, and july 28th
and judged the dates
so i did some math in my head
okay
`It begins.`

i did sorta explicitly say yall got free roam to edit it for flaws i may have said
edit it in
yeah that should say another user
oh that works too
(though also i would reccomend you get openoffice since that opens .docs, is free, and is the closest to a word-like functional word processor that emulates word itself)
i can set it up as a pdf
what other format can you open
4chan was literally born from somethingawful banning all anime on its community alongside discussions; moot made 4chan in response to this, culminating a massive exodus and forever intertwining anime and channer culture forever.
given 4chans origins they go hand in hand
4chan culture is to be expected from anime communities despite us viciously wrestling against it
well i drew up that part of the protocol for a reason
oh
you mean bb guns and stuff
whats airshit
Uhhhhhhh it's sorta covered but I can add in something more explicit
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning
You're better off not knowing
there's not much to
i need to brood quietly as a skeleton in gmod now.
clear it if you want
oh yeah i did that
and not a complete mistake of a human being
because im just so nice.
i even pinned it

ohhhh
its good that he deleted and apologized
okay doke
okay doke
hell yeah
`I know my capes.`
cant fool me. i saw that waver art in iskandar's freshly handed cape.
as for this person... they arent a problem so long as they dont step foot on our server. they scream fujoshi garbage, though
there's no point in focusing hate on people that arent worth it. valk has gone quiet and under the radar; theyre not our concern anymore.
id assume the opposite
is it a sociology degree, or a psych degree, or...
that sounds very ambigious
a degree in human sexuality
_kicks_
I'll start my maple rounds when I get online
Very eccentric tastes though
Very much so
Then I woke up
I got her number, she was cool
I was declared not guilty and spent some time talking to the judge
One of the witnesses put on trial to talk about what I did was a metapod on a phone
She was really nice and sweet though
She conducted the hearing wearing a large goat skull on her head
I was being tried for some sort of ambiguous crime in court but the judge was this tatted up 20-something year old who was weirdly into demonic things and also into cosplay
Not exactly
No
I had a very strange dream last night
Where's that 4chan post about fun being something lesser people experience
"I don't understand why people play games"
This dude's a moron
It's fine
yes
How do I join the maple guild
Hate everything
No point
Busy
cant cry
crying
i hurt so much.
they cant stop yelling
every moment im just yelled at by them
every moment is just strife
every moment is just fighting
I need to do errands because my folks are a fuck
Also sayakas English va is in here
I made Chris
`there are other places ive put up posters in`
and if you keep a close eye
who else did you think would put up that poster
yes it was me
yes
You've got a lot on your plate
It's cool, take your time
time to maple.
i am home
Now I'm finalizing getting new glasses with newer and better frames
Visions the same as it ever was
Did vision tests
Eyes are fine
Did eye tests
We finally settled on this place which was okay and they're friendly but my mom's a fucking child who can't keep her fucking mouth shut and wait for fifteen fucking minutes for things
I've spent the last 3 hours being driven around place to place to place for things that naturally won't do things immediately since you can't fucking snap your fingers and get new glasses like she wanted to
No planning, no nothing, just a big DO IT YOU FUCK waking up now
She wanted me to get new glasses ***immediately***
I got dragged into my mom's dumb impulsiveness
I apologized to ibu but I still feel like trash
I feel like a complete dissapointment
I need to apologize to them later when I'm not stuck running around like an idiot
I missed ibu's thing
I feel horrible
Meanwhile I am dragged to get new glasses
specifically me since im the chris char
HELLA.
itll be easier
just use a throwaway discord
yeah but i dont wanna and itd be weird
also having it concentrate somewhere keeps from cheating
watching the layers of speculation is entertaining
let them
nah
how do you expect me to gain attention for this without pings and or `any assistance from any other staff member, whether for their own personal reasons or otherwise`
nobody else can see that if the per- oh my god
what?
in the spectator chat
im only using here
*good
its allg ood
anyway, who here in staff is gonna play
fine...
but its our anniversary...
a little pingus wingus for our anniversary dont hurt no one
okay, okay...
for signing up for server games when they happen!
can you add it to `The List`
bless you
Event Participant
i need you to add the following role to be self-assigned
for role assignment
`also saki i need you do to a quick thing`
sure!
i mean alternatively yall can use a throwaway discord to play
everyone whose under every category for role shows up
right
for permission- oh
wait right clicking where
damn.
lyssa probs wont be here, ill be hosting, and alice will likely be doing something else
at least for illuminati
i think what we can do is set permissions for staff aside from myself to not see the plotting channel until the dupe townie role is enabled
i dunno how to get it so yall can play mafia without demoting yourselves
also i have some slight bad news
its really important
i need your help with adding one more thing in the auto-role assignment thing
<@!102691114762371072> how much free time do you have today
roles are operational
gonna prep for mafia time
anyway
<@!127644949884698624> you should post that to the subreddit
Thanks game
Fucking teleport my coffin to the next area
Also fucking Muphaza
It killed me and the whole cutscene is done with me as a talking grave
The VAYAR keeps fighting even after the fight ends
I HATE THE VAYAR
He can't climb blocks and his big hammer swing has an area where you can dodge within the circle and outside the circle
I had to cheese him by abusing geometry
Yes
The Minotaur with the fuck off hammer
Hemokan
Yes
ONLY MURDERRR
I WON'T FISH
Real estate bubble popping hard
eat it, valk
it seems it was a rousing success
i wanna... maple...
ill discuss it when im not tired as hell
the next event wont be roleplay oriented much
being fine and micromanaging everything wore me out.
im so fucking exhausted
In fact, it's a statement I point out to every cop before they start out.
The answer is simpler than you think it is.
Nope.
Nope.
The truth is much more twisted.
Silly Saki. I wouldn't do that.
gotta get rid of that too since he can still see everything with that
oh right you have the staff thing
had to pin that so i can remember

REMEMBER TO PROMOTE LATOONI AGAIN LATER YOU DUMBASS
just say the word
if you want me to demote you temporarily for this <@!99695384296701952> ill do so
`I'm getting old...`
and man this is tiring me out
i know it looks like im going ham but this is just a shred of what i used to be able to do
remember if you wanna play you gotta get a throwaway
okay doke
im working on my own piece
not yet
COUNTRY ROOO-OOOOOOADS...
TAAAKE ME HOOOOOOME
I BELOOOOOOONG
TOOOOOO THE PLAAAAAACE
TAAAAKE MEEEEEEEEEE HOOOOOOOME
COUNTRY ROOOOOOOADS
<@99695384296701952> i know you were down recently so you should login and check on your slime
That's fine latooni
I'll work on it tomorrow

Monsters in fucking hubs crashing everything
A MASSIVE MISTAKE
A BIG MISTAKE
in which case, `why did you not say this sooner`
i dont see it in spotlight so ill assume it was pm'd
ive already even prepped the answers to my questions
you didnt even make me aware of a deadline up until now outside of the context of "this will happen july 28th"
so i highly suggest you take a really good look at yourself and choose your next words wisely, because you are sincerely pissing me off.
i am a grown adult who is capable of prioritizing things. it just so happens that god forbid, i want to play the happy fun game where i run around doing stupid shit over constantly doing server things. server things you're not around for, incidentally, because you're doing ***the same damn thing i am***
yes, i did. i also pointed out that i still get everything done despite that. you're not my parental guardian alice, you do not police me on what i do this way. i dont plan on immediately getting on maple story tomorrow because i will prioritize this first.
Excuse me?
I wake up and get online usually at 2 so I hold no promises
Like making sure the writing event is run, or celebrating the servers anniversary (that you weren't there for), or making sure the internal rules were written before this event
I'm well aware of my procrastinating nature but I would really appreciate having more faith in me given that I've pulled through every single time
I will do it tomorrow
I'll do it tomorrow
Haven't started yet
What
Yes
That works
I'm glad everyone's commenting on it and likes it
i figured the first explanation was encyclopedic enough
symphogear is a clusterfuck
but yeah what do you think of what i wrote
jesus fuck
oh.
`what`
telling them all the writer behind wild arms is also behind this definitely gets the gist clearer too
so fusing em together feels like symphogear is that
because interstella is definitely about aliens and songs and nanoha is more solidly magical girl camp
i felt that was probably the best description for symphogear possible
can you access it?
cause i was doing it under my universities email, whoops
it was set for people with my college's address
okay try now latooni
hold on
its not registering access?
<@&336301457185832961> <@&336301943179968514> go read it
in fact
but i did it, and its done, just as i said i would
cut it up, edit it, delete it from the ground up if you really want to
you got your intro two hours earlier than the deadline you said
wake up
<@!127644949884698624> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8VNJtNFH5JCntCxJJXgniWRboKkUiz1We5QSUhcBnM/edit?usp=sharing
good night.
i am going right the hell to sleep because you are genuinely infuriating me and i am very close to saying some very mean things that i really do not want to
are you honestly telling me with a straight face that you, the person who ***founded this place***, felt that the event i was running to celebrate the ***server you created*** was something no one asked you to participate in, given that i asked repeatedly if people here wanted to play and even pitched that yall could use throwaway discords to get in on the action? or that you couldnt even just, yknow. talk? to your users? ***your*** community? during the celebration of what ***you*** created?
but if you're not around for it ill hold you to those very same remarks you're giving me
in fact, we'll do exactly that next time
sure
when i wake up i will work on it.
im going to sleep
i have been firmly capable of getting these things done and treating me like this when ive literally not only done so much for this place but also continue to do so scheduling time out of doing other things id like to try out to do so while the person who is telling me this has literally been mapling nonstop making songs like a madwoman is genuinely irritating to me
i do not need to be talked down to nor be told to be checked on to do these things
well still, i will be doing it
oh
`Latooni has ascended...`
if you want to come visit its outside elliana in a nice place
which makes it more annoying in theory but also their skins dont need to factor in going outside the box so i can just paint it all black and call it a day
mostly because they throw in added detailing for the smooth bits around their models
fun fact: they're not perfect squares
and now learned the nature of maple's skinning methods
i bought some fucking land and redid my house beforehand
`I have done the impossible.`

also
maybe as a parting message after we all answer the questions
Okay
I'm in favor of the edits
thats the long and short of it.
if you feel those edits are correct (which they seem to be, latooni's comment about pacing is correct but not something to overly worry about), then edit it accordingly
including the fact that this server is gay as hell and sort of a unicorn as far as anime communities go
the people interested in hearing that are the people we're interested in coming to our community, since people interested in empathy are in turn typically more empathetic towards things
its why i did the second part to make it clear the cast is largely women and also to make it clear that its very mushy and emotional
im more concerned on giving the message out to them on what this, and us, is all about, rather than focus on every period, comma, and semicolon
grammar focus is not a very big concern. these are anime nerds. proofreading our response is important, but remember your audience. getting the details clear to them on what it entails and, in turn, what our community entails, is more important than 100% accurate grammar.
for starters, what i wrote is largely unedited, so i trust any edits you give to this on the basis that its completely unpolished
maybe we can do the sendoff a day before and then yall do your own sendoffs
ah shit i wont be online that early
when would it shut down for me alice, we share the same timezone so itd be...
ill most likely be there barring if anything stupid happens
ill get back online now though
i did because i was bored as hell
shirabe needs a doctor's checkup
i see...
i sense the error lies in her potentially learning her own messages, maybe
ohhhh
also <@!102691114762371072> did shirabe say a bad thing
lemme finish washing this
im glad it did
`I made sure you were here in spirit....`

do not worry
<@!102691114762371072> i know you couldnt make it to maple 2, but
that sounds like apb reloaded
maple 2 feels to be going this road
the game became bloated and unfun and everyone wasnt playing for fun anymore
then the service folded and reformed itself into pay to win garbage with costumes costing ridiculous amounts of in game currency that you held ***temporarily*** for a ***week***
we'd wear whatever we wanted, go into places, party
or experimental mount or show off effects
i played with old friends and the dev would crash in sometimes (they were friends with our group) and show off the wild big mount
(for reference, gunbound is sorta like Worms except you ride things and has the sample Maple Story aesthetic)
back in ye olde days there was a hosted gunbound service/server that basically had all the cosmetics very dirt cheap and you unlocked bigger mounts through experience
because i used to love gunbound
which depresses me
I've said this before but this whole experience gives me gunbound flashbacks
its honestly a shame the game cant just be like this
im leaning towards no unless i hear news tht costs wont be TOO bad
i have no idea if im going to play on release
I wonder if we can weaponize this against valk
i need to get more skill points
yep
with patatulus or whatever his name is
the clockwork tower one i soloed
there are some you can solo with some time
except probably some dungeon bosses
if you hit level 50 youll basically be able to marathon the whole thing alone
***THE ENDING STILL PISSES ME OFF***
and the ending SUCKED.
i cleared the main plot and honestly? it sucked
honestly go for it
latooni proceeds to just skip the main quest storyline and gets lvl 50 through raw music alone
getting on now
I'll be there, a bit busy with something right now
mmmmm
noose emojis fall under the rule
we can make it an announcement and make it clear to people
its pretty explicit already
it /is/ a rule
poe's law looms judgingly...
yeah i feel irony's sorta dead too
Feel free to do it since I'm not in a good position to right now
We should
Whatever that is, is just freaky
I know that's not porn but...
Because it's not a porn channel
Heiro is lenient with nsfw jokes but there is a strong no naughty bits policy there
I point it out because it looks like someone jerking off an uncircumcised dick
Fuck you discord
Mainly the punched hibiki which has a slur (That is part of the original source material for that joke) and... whatever the hell the last thing he posted is
Mainly the punched hibiki which has a slur (That is part of the original source material for that joke) and... whatever the hell the last thing he posted is
We may want to talk about kerrik and his content in heiro
Before you do
I did that too, just wanted to make sure
Alright
On discord?
We pm them to him yeah?
I got my questions in yesterday
GETTING ON NOW
SHIIIIET gimmie a moment
HOW
?????
also there probs will be another one
for some stars
seeing as i combed the damn map looking for this one motherfucker
which, really, makes me want to slam my face into a wall
are simply not programmed into the current beta
despite being codified into the quests
that some npcs
just the slightest
i have the sneaking suspicion
i got distracted looking for a man named fredo haights
Tweeting about it is also good
Putting up a notice on our subreddit would also be good
fiiiine, ill make something new with the insignia
if you want to, totally

or we can use this one which is already a circle and i can omit the KFC bit
you can set it as the channel icon temporarily for the day

i still have that old insignia i made for the kanade fried chicken joke i did
if you ever need help just @ me
got bored and burned by some missions not working
*im not
IM NOT
just take notes from what ira built
honestly building with maple isnt hard
this is true, but i just logged out
theres no build permissions for people's homes
i cant
*shakily points gun at ryoko*
`It's time to go.`
`ryoko...`
*cocks gun*
its good, clean categorization
yessssss
wherein we recycle ryokou with maria and then have shirabe for automated scripts, kirika for commands, and maria for server messages of things (people joining, people leaving, when the bots have come online or offline, etc)
i actually have a bot architecture idea going
because it is her birthday.
tomorrow is kanade day
incorrect
thats good
build time now.
smug time over
anyway
watching them circlejerk about hardening up only reinforces their further descent into 4chan hell
business as usual
ah
i wonder what pushed him in the end
just talk to him and dont assume what he's saying is immediately hostile and youll be fine.
pretty much, yeah
he'd post in the writing channel about his work completely blind to the fact that ***no one*** looks there
he also as a bad habit of not being able to read the mood
he's not exactly an asshole, but he's very... mechanical with his thinking.
ditch that mentality immediately; i dont want paranoia and assumed competence from those imbeciles
no
that being said, keep an eye on wolfsbane
precisely.
we're not here to stoke rivalry with valkryie further
people hardly look at it unless i directly ping them. ive always had greater visible feedback pinging then not
suppressing my only means to advertise events is also not a good look either
period.
if people have no interest in a community's notifications, and do not actively engage in it, then the door is right over there. i want to draw in people who feel shy and dont actively engage in things by showing them visibly there are things to do instead of saying it quietly in a corner. until you find me another means to do this that isnt 'do it less', i will ***keep pushing to use @ everyone***.
the people who have no interest in what is going on are the people who would disable it regardless
that is just telling me to do it less
thats not an alternative
or, even better: ***help me out*** when im trying to get the word out
find me a viable alternative that works just as well and i wont keep trying to do it
except i dont want to just have people active in the community. i want people who arent active to gain visibility of what we're doing in the community to give them visible cues to engage it
i dropped 4 to advertise engagement for a game that was coming up
i dont want my desire to engage with the community to be constrained by people who do not participate in it
disabling @ everyone manually in discord also exists for a reason
its not, but its nice to give the idlers a reminder as opposed to letting them wallow in silence for all eternity
instead of letting them rot in obscurity
with the whole community
it is not at a drop of a hat, its to celebrate big things
FINE
<@!127644949884698624> permission to use @ everyone to ping and celebrate kanade's birthday
ITS KANADE'S FUCKING BIRTHDAY I GOTTA SET THE ICON
WAIT WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING
ah, alright
whens the r/anime thing coming online
_looks at watch_
...its not up yet
THE R/ANIME DAY
TODAY IS THE DAY
***BANG***
SHE CAN FIGURE OUT LOVE ***IN HELL***
sure.
sure
thats easier to explain, huh?
no. you're just stripping everything so it doesnt look like it.
just demote me too, why the fuck not
sure
great
and it hurts
and nothing
and i push myself and i keep it going
and nothing
and all i see are people holding me back. limiting me. all i feel when i keep doing these things is either unappreciation, getting ignored, or just general apathy. do you want to know a personal detail about me, alice? when people praise me, the few times i see it happen, ***i straight up don't believe them!*** i cant! i am physically incapable of feeling any sort of positivity in anything i do. i try, and i try, and i try so much
and that is the reality if i do not keep engaging people.
that was the reality the moment i stepped foot here
because a community without things to do in dies
you didnt have a single damn finger in the anniversary, and very little in everything else
and its constantly shown in everything you do here
repeatedly you've even gone on record saying that you'd rather even defer everything to me and just kick back than actually doing things
besides founding this place
name one activity you have had a direct hand in doing that wasnt me.
okay alice
its been the same with establishing meat to fancontent and giving artists the means to express themselves, to show appreciation on the subreddit by giving them a place a recognition, making the writing corner and activity to help them write more, getting herio in check for people to have fun, establishing live shitposting as something ***that wasn't focused on me*** so everyone can have some entertainment and have some fun
when she was too busy to even have breaks
from the very beginning you were resistant to wanting saki on board because you thought lyssa could cover everything
saki is here because of me ***telling*** you over several months, and constantly getting lyssa to talk over several months with no response here
you are literally here because of me arguing alice over the course of ***several months*** to get you involved
no, it is not
this entire community consists of literally me constantly trying to find ways to engage people in every way possible
constantly
except i have
```Third point: If someone does not engage entirely we need to find ways to make them want to engage rather than just shoving content in front of their face, especially when that content amounts to not a whole lot ultimately.```
and they were a good idea
ive been trying
except they havent been working as well lately
and you are blithely ignoring it.
and i am saying "this is a problem and it will not carry the word out"
you are explicitly saying "do it less" and calling it a day
no, you are not
how about, instead of just telling me not to do it, you help me find other ways to advertise events that dont rely on it
no, because i already know your damn answers, and it will be literally nothing and only proceed to just suppress my means to actually get events done in this place
alice you explicitly joined that community only for the maple and maple alone when it was first and foremost a streaming community. that server is a thousand people strong, more than twice than ours.
tate is a streamer and those pings are to advertise when they are streaming
no, it is not. ping spam doesny phaze people when its actually good and cool information being displayed. talking about the birthday of a character central to the whole plot of the show this community revolves around, is one of them
the other 400 arent even around to begin with. you are telling me to prioritize server fodder over potentially getting more activity with regards to fun things and dates
or ill do it
so you can remove it now if you want
ive already done all the prompts and right now im just polling
i can remove it now honestly
`we're doing gods work`

we should probably cross-post the announcement of the symphogear feature to r/symphogear

i dont really get to go anywhere. or do anything, outside of what i do on my comp.
as of this moment the server is literally all i have
ver gets no parties.
except for ver
i will make there be a party
i guess i will have to do the latter
i suppose that is true
im sorry i sorta broke down a bit
alright
im still not convinced. i mean, i suppose people can notice the icon change, but, will they care enough do things noting why its changed?
...where?
when did amity talk here?
wait, what?
its such a small pool of suggestions
its still so low
its gone up to 5
literally only three people have submitted prompt ideas
im trying to get people's input
im trying to see if maybe im the problem when it comes to prompts
im trying not to

***THE SONG IN OUR HEARTS... IT'S REACHING THROUGH...***
genocide is the perfect song to listen to to watch all these people react and take to heart our words
i hope our words come through to them

oh
GIMMIE THE IP AND THE PORT AND IM IN
<@!102691114762371072> ARE YOU PLAYING RISK OF RAIN
alright
i... i thought we would have maria cover messages
then they join
whenever anyone harasses you, you just link the steam group to them and tell them its an erp place
we should give the valkryie steam group some special attention
only in my heart, latooni
alice, do you still get messages from those random creeps who think you want to erp
SHIRABE PLEASE.
<@!127644949884698624> hey alice
im musing...
not now, shirabe
it seems valkryie is thinking of new ways to try and expand
a steam group
_squints_
which is fine
i file what alice does as "friendly suggestions that happen to lead to essentially wild life discoveries"
casual reminder that while i understand we try to do good, we are not therapists
i am still proud that the deck exists though
i did it once and it was pretty okay but there wasnt much demand
go for it
are ya hankering a cards against humanity symphogear edition?
whatcha thinkin
i did
yes
_radiates raw maria energies_
`And I have the killer Maria...`
sakimori is kirika
latooni is shirabe
yeah that one
kriisa you still got the dess emoji yeah
i may make a more hd one in the future
oh that coin is perfect
i dont want to put too much weight on her when she is busy with life things
the only thing i hesitate with in terms of currency is that it will likely be a lot of work for saki
anyway, what do you all think
that can work too
kiricoins is too alliterative not to use
its too late
kiricoins is perfect
KIRICOINS
something like...
id go for something catchier
the more people vote on the same character, the more likely they will have to vote together on the emoji they want to see on the server. the less people vote, the less deciding there is. if only one person votes for a character and they win, they get full creative control over the emoji of their choice.
i want people to PLACE BETS on who the winner of this simulation would be. each person can vote on who they think will win. the person or people who get it right get a reward. and that reward is an emoji on the server that is compliant with the subreddit rules, no questions asked.
the premise itself is already intriguing. but, it lacks interaction with the audience. which leads to the associated part of this idea
`What if I ran a simulation wherein EVERY SINGLE SYMPHOGEAR CHARACTER lived under the same roof ala Big Brother and was documented as an event for all to see?`
and i had a very devious idea
one of them that caught my eye was Big Brother; for those of you who arent familiar, Big Brother is a show where a bunch of people are forced to live together under the same roof under surveillance and are individually voted out of the house until one remains; the winner
http://www.brantsteele.net/
something i noticed is that brant steele, the person who made this simulator... `has a bunch more simulators...`
with that being said, i have a brand new idea that is similar to symphogames but more interesting, and more related to symphogear
these events, obviously, are now a thing of the past because chris is a flake and doesnt really host them anymore. but, i always had fun with em and they always drew out a large crowd.
something ive been wanting to do for a while is an event similar to the symphogames while it being its own entity. for those who are not familiar, the symphogames was a series of hunger game simulator activities run by Chris in Valk circa half a year ago or so, or more. it was a fun activity where people would sign up and basically have their gauntlet thrown as part of a player in the hunger games simulator, with lots of symphojokes and stuff into the mix. this was back when valk was relaitively decent.
anyway, who wants to hear the event idea thats been prattling in my brain for a while
also flip flappers
and for one more thing, `i just hate them`
and for another their ideas in general are bad and oftentimes completely unrelated to symphogear
for one thing, theyre doing more things because i explicitly shoved it in their faces, but are going completely against the spirit of why i suggested it to begin with
seeing them do things grinds my gears of a variety of reasons
yes, because i hate them, but also im more suggesting it out of spite than genuinely wanting to do it, really
perhaps it may be time to dust off an event idea ive had for a while...
i suppose you make a compelling point
really?
i dont want to give those idiots the satisfaction that they did something moderately right for once. and when we do, i want to do it better than them.
not now though
on a more serious note, we should make our own steam group
fufufufu
sure is great to get fucking evicted from my own damn computer
o-oh.... your dess is so... big... and large...
that one, yes
saki can you give me the big version of dess
honestly id take the currency stuff slow
okay yeah thats doable too
ohhhh you mean not just symphogear
because youd program in the questions and answers
id have to construct new events around the currency
mmmm
that can be tied to currency too
saki did say she wanted trivia nights
id really rather not taint the writing topics with `capitalism...`
yeah no i really dont want that
wait
absolutely not
no
_holds up coin_
so keeping it all in one image allows space for other images
the reason why its a spritesheet is because there is a limit to the amount of images you can upload
at least this is how "old" reddit does it
and then coded in manually through their dimensions
because theyre processed as a spritesheet
flairs in reddit are wacky
okay so
true
its hard to say
bot testing honestly can be recycled into a bot spam server unless it genuinely needs to be a secret
yeah
so something passive people dont have to use commands for
id like to avoid public notifs for kiricoins though
yeah
so people can get comfortable using them
though i would prefer showing off the kiricoins first before we do the event
we dont need to for a while
so i cant even do that
i was going to design one but all my design tools are on my PC
i wish.
because GOD FORBID i want to stay on my comp, one of the FEW THINGS that are genuinely 100% completely mine with zero meddling from anyone else
because i literally dont even have a room to myself, let alone any real sort of sense of possession with anything, ever, because this tiny ass house wasnt made for 3 people who hate each other deeply in mind
and the literal only reason im even in the fucking room with him was because of HER demands to do so in the first fucking place
even though i made it explicitly clear to him that if hes ever too tired to not want me in the same room as him he can tell me personally and ill fuck off and hes like "yeah sure" and doesnt give a flying shit up until he goes "hey son its late can you get off the comp" to which i say "yeah dont worry" and immediately do so
and i pointed out she only cares about his health suddenly because she needs him to drive him to a car shop tomorrow and wants to make sure hes well rested but is compulsively dressing it up as "you're hurting your dad"
even though she actively desires his death
i cant sit at my damn computer because suddenly my mom cares about how my dad feels
fuckin...
yeah its not at you its just
im going to go sulk watching vids and preparing to get ass scatty on fgo
also when i get on my pc im making hd versions of those coins
this headphones inexplicably have startedworking
i
i suppose
well, i still side with her having the greet/goodbye bits and the command for pming all bot commands personally to you part
oh.
i thought maria was the message bot
if we did that id want it to make fun of xdu
itd be a discord version of xdu
that would be so funny
discord server gacha
youd know whatd be funny
_snorts_
mainly because sql isnt programming, in a sense
but sql is wacky
i sorta know sql
maria was also planned to be a notifier for when bots went offline as well
yeah thats another reason why im surprised you dont just bundle it with kiri all the way
true
i can draft up some psuedocode stuff to help saki give a visible list of things of how to implement in it so they dont have to do the designing all alone
anyway im down with the xdu idea
true
i just, you know, momria, mom maria greeting you, i liked that aesthetic
im not against the xdu bot
oh, really? shit thats amazing
this is something i relied on with my sql classes
feel free to use this as a resource to understand
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/
yes
no, but using the primary key you can get the secondary key
thats the unique identifier given within the table itself
thats a primary key
you see where it says 'id'
okay so
as in its logged in that database
i assume the account is the database itself
honestly as fun as it is to throw ideas we should probably get all this on paper first so we can organize it clearly and not get tangled in knots
sqllite just strips a lot of the bells and whistles of sql but its still the same
nah
whatll the sql database be used for
depends on what you're fetching
so sql syntax is really straightforward, but in order to access things, you need to access them through the primary key, which is the unique identifier every database object has
ahhh, okay
in sql
you remember primary keys and shit right
aight
we shower maria with cash and then she takes off her clothes and gives the rolls
you can probs use the latest version of express though
this is what i used in my classes
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42299
it was about pokemon cards
actually when i get on my pc again i can show you my sql project, saki
l-latooni...
o-oh...
but youll need to unlearn some programming logic
sql isnt hard
take me now
i already am
there is but people dont do much with it

folks at /sgg/ have a brain, for better or for worse

oh
discord is a different medium than a mobile game
because we cant replicate xdu's system 1 to 1
oh.
ive done it before
photoshop can auto resize things
it can be done
yes
ill likely draft up something for discord
*memorias
also no memories
ill resize them manually if needed then
oh
we can have the bot resize them
yeah itll be a big file
ive asked for it before in the past
you wont arouse questions
i like that last one
Momria
`Maria.net`
now we need
we've got Shirabe.exe
we've got kirichan
id like to help with designing The Gacha for the sake of working on the game aspect
we prepare the foundational systems, currency, and event to unveil them all beforehand, then deploy them strategically
this is what scheduling is for, and why pacing is important instead of machinegunning everything
we also need to prepare foundational systems towards getting coins casually
yes
help them get acclimated to it and get used to using them
yes, but we want to warm up our users to kiricoins as opposed to overwhelming them
currency -> introducing users to the currency -> event which uses currency -> gacha
but also i feel we should prioritize things
i am amused this became this after talking about an event with bets
also the name kiricoin made me realize i feel like we've invented a blockchain currency
yay
then integrate it later
we can have normal mafia games where you host, no kiricoins
im fine with that; i can teach you how to host mafia
thats why im musing for different events to construct with this
i do want to keep a healthy balance between "fun events for fun" and "fun events for server cash"
same with quiplash
cah might be hard and i dont want to have that one tainted either, especially since itll be harder since its offsite
im musing on other games
stump the chump wont work here
people like making their mark in places
a single emoji, no questions asked sans rules? youd be surprised
so that the core focus is people setting up camps and either cheering on their chars, or plotting to take it all for themselves
since the initial presented point of the idea is for people to draw lines and choose between character and pick between either supporting a character or supporting themselves
...now that you say it like that i feel that might not pan out so well
the engagement comes from people either making alliances for a specific emoji/character or betting on an underdog alone
big sister was going to be "bet on a char to win, if they win you (and everyone else who bet with you) choose together to slap in one emoji of your own design (under the rules) no questions asked"
the initial idea, no, that came later when we thought up of kiricoin
i thought big sister was the kiricoin event
_confused face_
gotta make sure.
but you know
the prompts are customizeable so its not a problem
since big brother the show has sexual things happen and the last thing i need is a prompt that reads something akin to `dr ver fucked shirabe`
since i want to vet Big Sister for any bad prompts
i will have to get things ready first then
aight
and can play around and understand its mechanics
so people understand "this exists now"
like, timed
but we should introduce kiricoins before the big event
yeah
that works
we'll do a normal set and then introduce the coins after
i just want to make sure they work first
sure
both votes are required
yeah
they can vote for themselves or not, and vote for someone else
people get two votes, but can only vote for two unique lines
i dont know how to keep tabs on that. in which case we could probably do it jackbox style
stratify winnings by 1st, second, and third
put it to a vote
we get a screenshot of something in symphogear and have people submit one funny caption for it
caption contest
thats similar in vein to yours
ive got another idea
we'll test it out and see how it works out
art quality spikes, cast, etc
some are really easy to deduce since symphogear is very heterogenous with its content
youll need to find some good ones
a what
ill think of something
we dont want to burn people out on them
there are
bi weekly or even monthly might be better
weekly might be a bit much
gladly
i say we just use what we have
are we gonna do a sendoff today

quinn of all people noticed, which satisfied me, since the draw of it all was probably one big middle finger to her
you know they noticed the thing on r/anime
i will think of a way.
one day, valkryie...
nrgh...
neutering them is not enough.
the aftermath is worth enduring for the complete eradication of those smug bastards
even if theyre not its worth a try
thats not what they've done to some servers that were affiliated
servers that have it break the ToS
not if there's enough people in a server doing it
with the caveat that we must strip our server of it
you can probably report the whole valkryie server for their porn and screenshot/submit the underage porn they post
we dont need to
as for a script, thats not hard either since he's set it up to directly query his server and retrieve it, but if you want to go full autonomy, you can just decompile it yourself
its not hard
he's talked about it before

tsubasa's birthday
remember that you told khairz about one of our critical weaknesses wrt to the subreddit back when we were investigating soiguess to try and get rid of him. if, by any reason, your line of inquiry leads to ignite some sort of spite against us, he has exactly the means in which to execute a monumental part of us
there is one fundamental weakness to this plan
mmmm
so what are you suggesting
he would have to kill me first.
oh no he will never touch a staff position here
that he has founder level access and that at the end of the day he has the final say
he does understand that he is the founder, right
how so
elaborate
im slamming the fucking button.
but if and when the day comes that the opportunity to nuke valkryie appears before me
i dont mind staying friendly with /sgg/
i can respect someone who listens.
a long time back he was curious about learning more about trans people when i got on my shit in valk back when i was active there with him seeing me talk about things, and i gave him simple enough advice (from my perspective) and pointed him to you
he also listens
honestly at this rate i am deeply curious if we cant just recruit pittman flat out in some way, though i worry he would turn it down due to conflict of interest with r/anime
we do...
_eyes pittman_
conveniently...
muscling in on valk's territory with streaming the releases will help us gain coverage
just valkryie being monumentally stupid and totally justifying the presence of a total /pol/-tier racist to boot
i guess that is slightly okay.
but, ibu thanked me for talking
im just dissapointed on every level.
im not even angry
absolute waste of time
<@!127644949884698624> dont invite me to this again. there is no point to discuss there.
in a "i dont give a fuck i wanna use it" sense
there are people straight up advocating the use of the n word
like
you are really wasting your time arguing in that server
i just got home
WE WILL CONQUER THE WEST
because the site is dedicated to custom sets

maria: `Faker...? You're not even good enough to be my fake...`
tsubasa: `What are you talking about, faker?`

yeah its been a while



looking at these white cards i still smile
this is a custom deck in card cast
that one you gotta find a source since its built in
calls are black cards, responses are white

_unzips deck_
sigh...
also the symphogear deck is pretty big
i want to avoid meta
we COULD do xdu jokes and ova jokes
i did all the jokes i could from 1st to 4th season and some xdu jokes
itd be fun to break in for all the new folk
its actually been a while since i used the deck
maybe do a cards against humanity thing
gotta muse on small event ideas
no idea
it will
what it is
we all know
i know what it is
you know what it is
there is only one picture i can do for maria's birthday
alice
given the nature of him being in an arranged marriage and such, he probably doesnt have much agency to begin with and is likely used to people doing things for him
he is likely not used to even the smallest amounts of heat and pressure
he probably left the staff discord explicitly because of me, honestly
id only tear him apart anyway
didnt plan on involving myself to begin with
have fun with that
alright
unfortunately, i manipulated the founder harder into banning him due to the founders growing frustrations towards him, so whoops
also this particular piece of shit also organized a posse within our community to organize things to an extent where he even got people from his group onto the moderating team to leak every move
but this is mostly because the founder was an absolute imbecile way up his own eyes who literally could not relent or understand why his moderation ideas (that werent is) were fundamentally wrong, given he had 0 experience running one to begin with and was desperate for moderating ideas and organizing
i once had to deal with someone on another community who actively pitched bad ideas to the founder of a community on purpose to bog the moderators down in actually doing anything and thus keeping us from warning/banning people and instead cause tons of infighting
its not impossible, latooni
_grins wickedly_
i will keep musing
dont encourage nobody to go that far
of course
i thought you meant him hosting the site was a felony
oh you mean the act of ddos
how is it a felony
?
thank the lord i saved this in txt seperately
oh this is so good
`this is such an improvement`
this auto-detects the spaces and deduces which type of question it is
oh my god
SABASA
`oh no`
`this has text to speech`
oh no
aw shit this gui for cah is really slick
alice does really like slamming her head against brick walls
surprise
found it!
probs gotta figure out how to do submissions
we need to have a test round to see how this plays
interesting
i dont drag anyone to my machinations
until every waking moment in their position in power is dredging through raw, unending misery
unless alice tells me otherwise, i will do whatever it takes to make their lives as miserable as possible
valk is a server that has repeatedly made it clear they not only plan to be antagonistic to us, but also repeatedly hurt our members without scruples up until we personally get involved
this is how i stay one step ahead
the advantage of having an eye into one of their events and how they think is too good to pass up. its likely with the death of xyzzy that someone else will host something, but they wont remove me as staff of the event, which means i still have a prying eye on it.
additionally, it was also a means to gaze into how they organize their events
that is who cape is.
i dont want to do anything else with them after this. but, when i conscript or i am conscripted to something, i do my best to serve
i did not remove myself from it because im ultimately a man of my word, for better or for worse
this was before we removed the valk link, and when alice wanted me to play nice
better tell khairz this since its part of the server anniversary for valk that i was going to host
It can be printed
I mean, the deck I made still isn't totally useless
Well this sucks
Shit
I didn't anticipate this
Like fuck
This is devastating though

crack open that apk and sip

shit you might not even need to use an emulator
its a unity program. all you gotta do is find the executable on an emulator, crack it open, and scrape the gwaphics. images wont be encrypted.
in an archived /sgg/ thread
straight from /mu/

aye
lemme double check
ptcgo also uses unity
its not uncommon for those programs to use unity, unfortunately
last i checked
yes
alice can probably ask louis since he's talked about how before, its really easy
it uses the unity engine, so basically you just need open the game on an emulator and then dig from there
there is no room for playing nice. we take what we want and we grip people's arms until they snap and agree.
and its why i yell at them with my entire soul, essentially
this is why i spare no hesitation in berating them
if they're hostile, mean, and cruel, it usually means the ones above them share the same influence
the behavior of users in a community are symptomatic of the staff's mentality
users reflects staff

however, i dont like putting things at risk to get things done

but i dont recall who...
i vaguely remember this
`who did i help out...`
who...

_holds up a mysterious note_
yeah thats reasonable
We got you alice
i have honestly, genuinely contemplated just asking him to step down, but the mere risk of that ending poorly is too much to actually want to do that over
what pisses me off is that he's actually actively moderating r/overlord too
if the legal means have failed us time and again? gladly
he is an ever-dangling damacles sword that needs to go
if the way is made clear to get rid of him, i will gladly do so without hesitation
that man is the biggest achilles heel our community has to offer. if anyone- literally /anyone/ knew or even so much as bugged him as an accident, there is immense risk that everything we've worked for is nuetered, and in turn rotted away
do i look like the kind of person who does not contemplate opportunities when seen fit?

yeah this is a seperate thing
Interesting
Takes a while to load
says its like minimum 3 gigs
the mod may be a long download though
ooooooh im excited
im going to test it first to see if it doesnt run like garbage
IM GONNA TRY IT OUT
THE THING YOU SHOWED ME
YES
`IT IS`
I THINK JAZZSTRONAUTS IS OUT
<@!102691114762371072>
WAIT
WAIT
garrys mod is where i focus all my chaotic energies
`I must Garry's Mod.`
there is only one thing to do when bored out of my mind
im bored out of my goddamn mind
I'm happy for yall though
Apologies, that is my slang kicking in
I'm used to moderators hooking up
Har har
And also fine, at least in this small circle of mods
That is funny
Did I wake up to hookups
You gotta run gmod
i still made it through
despite having swapped the default combine with dangerously competent kizuna ai npcs with even more dangerously powerful old timey rifles
interesting thing is that this thing plays well with a lot of mods too
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1452613192
You gotta look it up on the work bench, lemme see if I can...
You got gmod alice
You have no choice but to disconnect
Some maps you choose will flat out not load and when a map doesn't load in this game it traps you in a very literal void
Okay so one warning about this game
THAT'S AMAZING
YES IT DOES
I'm seeing if this mod saves progress automatically even though you're playing single player in a local server
Oh?
Since there are some... very interesting mechanics at play
I'm mostly learning the game
No I'm playing singleplayer
You'll need to, to learn it, and then you can play multiplayer saki this mod is SO GOOD JAZZSTRONAUTS IS SO GOOD
<@102691114762371072> please please play this mod in single player
Guys this mod is so good I'm gonna cry
THIS MOD IS AMAZING
***THIS MOD IS AMAZING***
oh this mod is fucking with me.
also this mod is fucking wild.
but you may want to disable physical bullets maybe
it wont affect you too much saki if you host because ive set up custom npcs that replace combine
so my own mods are making this much harder than it needs to be for really funny reasons
It's likely because of jazzstronauts nature to download new maps to hurl you in
It supports single player but it has to be lan
also by 'no more can follow' i mean "no, more can join in'
night'
No more can follow
Because my dad just absolutely needs me out of the room for his damn prayers
I still need to wait
Have to fucking wait for my dad
Can you see my messages in game
Wait alice
You'll know who
The cats are cool, but two of them are fucking crazy
Like you'll lose your shit doing it
Because it's really funny
I recommend it
Are you... in one?
No idea
I see you but you're not moving...
WAIT I SEE YOU
*ass
Yeah it'll be a long add download
K back
Brb
Imma get a beverage
A THICC THIGHED LIAR
VANILLAS A LIAR
SHE GIVES EVERYONE THE SAME LIP SERVICE
SHE WON'T MISS YOU
IT WAS GONNA CLOSE ANYWAY
YOU CAN DO IT ALICE
Unless it forces it
It's a shame you'll miss the intro probably
You're going to fucking love this
It'll be a long download unless your internet is stellat
I made their ai too sophisticated with a mod and they're really good with the grenade/rifle combo they have
Run
Also if you see a kizuna so with a gun on my end just uh
It's a really long list though
You'll get to have my collection
Oh even better
Ignore em, if it's p2p just go to my steam profile and do the 'join game' bit
Oh sorry
let's try without it and see what happens
though in retrospect i wonder if i genuinely need all the mods together to work because i managed to do saki's server and she had like a Best Of list of my mods that i compiled
yeah but we gotta have the same mods, unless you want me to dump all of my mods on you
saki said she might host later but i dunno
there's no server
that was a fucking hassle, thanks for overcomplicating everything

for fucks sake, steam
let me make this screenshot shit PLAY NICE
Gimmie a moment
Okay
My comp can't take it
I mean I am, I'm not hosting a server because I cant
If you do it right you should show up to a prompt with a button and the rest is buckling up for the ride
Then select the game mode which is jazzcats, with the map that should show up uniquely as jazzcats, and set yourself as a lan server
all of these too

im gonna hand you mine but to also ask did you subscribe to like
i see
when you downloaded the mods, did it include the added mods for this or just the basic one
strange- wait, question
uhhhhh
is your progress not saving?
<@!127644949884698624> aight im on
friend connection was dead
I should be- Oh wait

pingus wingus me when
aye, gotcha
<@!127644949884698624> when do you wanna go back into gmod space to hunt some props and shards
fun fun fun fun
i sure do love working out
going to a park to get humiliated by being told how to fucking power walk and run like a ten year old sure is a fun experience
Waking up at 10 am to go to the park? She's not even here
Exercise? Funny!
Sure is great to have gone to sleep early only to do the exact opposite of what I was told I was going to do
we really need to develop a system to handle that
there are two one hour intervals starting at 3 for us, 4 for valk, then three one hour intervals starting one with us, another with valk, then another with us
10:19
since what im comparing it to is in est
translate that to est for me
interesting
wait is that the time that you have for him joining right now

id like the precise timestamp
no no, thats not what im looking at
whats the logged timestamp of epicgamer joining in right now
let me see something real quick
hmmmm
I don't like imposing bans on assumptions; he could be a bit, or he could easily just be a skittish user unable to make up his mind
Hard to say
Yay

alright
also you have both vanilla and reccomended, right
i know something loaded in the mods when i booted it up today
maybe the game did an update?
okay
where the fuck is this goddamn file
at least its not in the directory path youre telling me
i... dont have jazz_bar.bsp
uhhhhhh
you crazy kids have fun
thats fine, just giving the heads up to what i and alice will be doing then
okay doke
yall got it?
timing is crucial to deliver this message as hard as possible
since i dont want info to leak from here to valk
we're not announcing this exploit until bingo has given his response
just generally make their lives as miserable and panic filled as possible.
* go to the servers they can be found on and point out this issue to the server owner while @'ing how easily they were found to the staff member in question
* make the issue known publically on their server
* pm every staff member personally and show them the servers they can be caught on
- if he says no for some ***really fucking stupid reason***, here is what i encourage you to do:
- if he says 'yes im gonna take it down' we keep an eye on it and hold him to it and make sure he does it. when he does we also press him to announce this exploit over on his end as well, and make sure those users, for better or for worse, are also protected. this encourages good faith between our servers and in turn can work towards maybe improving relations a bit even if we still dont like them since while i very much want to crush them alive, crises like this need mutual cooperation to resolve
secondly, here is our reaction depending on bingo's response:
we're going to wait for bingo's response. whether he says yes or no, we need to announce this exploit publically so that people can react accordingly, and leave the compromised servers theyre in or address this to their server(s) in question. regardless of anything, this is the most important and ethical thing to do, since a shitload of people are compromised by this.
aight, so here's the plan
cant believe i was so stupid to actually hesitate banning it.
which it will, because that alt bot came in
at least until valk gets re-indexed again
same for me
yeah nothing shows up for you saki
if its not on discord.me you're not affected
if he refuses... then we let the hounds free
i want to see bingo's reaction
dont tip it off quite yet
probably fucking nothing since its existed since july
so he probably lives for making people uncomfortable by creating stalking level tools
his twitter literally says "I exploit things."
a fuckwit script kiddie
5 servers i can find him in
khairz has like
great, isnt it?
At least if he doesn't refuse
I wont
I'll personally deliver the news
Not this time at least
Not at first
No
And if refuses I'm going to whistle blow the whole thing right on his server and burn it all to the ground
I want to bring it up to bingo explicitly so he takes down his discord.me invites
No no, quite the opposite idea
When life gives you lemons...
This gives me an idea
Hmmmm
Damn
It's up
did... did it crash?
...
alright
the response almost seems pavlovian at this rate and its equal parts funny and very harrowing
Shoot
I've stopped for real
They can't escape me though
Good riddance
Looks like they banned me
I'm done
and then creating a response that is basically "we know this exists, but we're not going to do anything about it because there's already so many ways to do it anyway"
imagine doing so little research on the current problem that you borderline lie to your users about it
```As you may have heard, a site has been established that, using discord bots joining public servers, pulls the server user list and reports which servers a user is a member of. This is not the first time this kind of information gathering has happened, and until Discord fixes the underlying issue, it will not be the last. There are privacy implications with this site, but the information is public even without this particular site and bots. Again, that is a more fundamental issue with Discord.

These bots use discord.me's server list to find servers to index. Our server was indexed by these bots before we became aware of this issue, as have a great many other servers listed on discord.me. In this particular case, taking down our server's information on that site might prevent the bots from updating the information they already have if they haven't also stored the server information itself (given that they list the servers, this is highly unlikely). However, it doesn't remove the information the bots have already acquired.

Since the information acquired is already public and can be gotten through other means, the staff here aren't too concerned about the issue at this time. We see no reason to get into a panic about it. However, we understand if you personally are concerned. If that is the case, you will need to leave any and all servers listed on discord.me before they are indexed by these bots, not join any that are or have been listed either, and then hope that the bots and site do not acquire the information by other means that currently already exist. Beyond that, only Discord can fix the underlying issue.

If you have any further questions or concerns, we will be happy to answer them as best we can with the information we have available to us.```
they didnt even bother to @ everyone
i am here temporarily as a pillar of salt manifest
_eyes valks response_
probs a bit more
be back in like.... 4 hours
leaving for reals now
i agree with latooni but what saki said is fine
understandably so
i wonder if she watched me fight everyone
its why im bringing it up
i got a pm asking me if the link could be trusted
announce that, but also tell people to be wary regardless
later
needs to be used safelyu
god knows what its also laced with
you need to tell people that while the service works, you cannot trust that link
alice, one more thing to add since i gotta go
oh, feel free to correct me with that alice
i was going to since someone pm'd me but if youre gonna, go for it
were you gonna add something alice
absolutely no one gave a shit
i truly, genuinely hate them to the core
valk always sure is full of surprises
added a thing
my mom came home and she wants to do thing and i am seething to the core
<@!127644949884698624> do the announcement of this exploit for me
and then me mocking and belittling them by basically just pulling the receipts about all the servers theyre in, and them egging me on and/or telling me to stop
to be more accurate, its me growing increasingly frustrated and angry at the server for trying to tell them about a problem involving discord.me with them ignoring it
aye
though i still havent watched it
feel free to invite me if you want

heiro simply provided the roadway to that, under a common denominator everyone can relate to
to be honest, i would argue it was not heiro itself that got things going, but rather an easy to post means of expressing ideas
explaining to valk, that is, not them
they can have fun watching me shit on valk after i give up explaining to them how massive a problem this is
go for it
<@!127644949884698624>
endless, unceasing cowardice...
cowards to the end.
nor did they have the balls to tell me i was banned.
they never even had the balls to warn me themselves
since they never saw me as anything beyond a user, they're forced to treat my banning as nothing beyond a normal user's banning
anyway
back
Gonna shower now, brb
In other words; my beef with valk is a battle of attrition I cannot lose, and their endgoals favor us equally
And there is nothing to be done about this anymore, because I will not tolerate their lack of professionalism or concern anymore, and they are going to have to chew on that for the rest of their lives
And it's going to keep beating heads until they either never speak to us again or they simply get so tired of it that they step down
And they are going to learn this the hard way
And it's going to fail
And it's why they're trying to go behind my back to get rid of me now
It's why none of their moderators performed nothing to silence me
It's why they resorted to an instant ban while scrubbing all my messages conveniently
Grates them thoroughly
Up until this point no one had the balls to call them out on things with such raw violence and persecution, and the way I do things publically and thoroughly exposes what they do and trampled their silent status quo on secretive dealings and simply quieting things down
- they find me enough of a nuisance to get rid of me
- they do not like dealing with me
- they do not like listening to me
Only confirms the following:
And the fact that they want to see me get repercussions for this over something of their design, failing to follow their own protocols, failing to deal with their own heckling users, failing to patch their own security problems, failing to even research and tell the truth correctly to their own users and instead all circlejerk around about how this doesn't affect them and they don't really care about flaunting themselves being in literal porn servers
The conversation before last involved bingo shushing me because he thought I was just some pickaninny moderator
They didn't even acknowledge me as staff
The fact that it exploded this way is a shame but also they never had me in any special user role to begin with
Out of sight, out of mind
And frankly, it will actually spare me headaches in the long run as I no longer have to be summoned to discussions or be pointed to them by you, and proceed to be horribly infuriated by them
Banning me was likely for the better as this honestly crossed the line alongside every single thing building up to this moment
Valk is incompetent and we are not, and I do not reward incompetence, and I am true to myself in shaming it for as much, and as long, as possible
To sum up as to why you should not worry about it, aside from you alongside everyone else being my friends who I deeply care for in a community I personally make sure to defend tooth and nail for, the fact of the matter is this
Okay I am home
I'll give a response when I'm home

imagine if mario party was a linear board game with pop culture references everywhere
its a board game where you move your piece to the end while basically fucking around with the game in wild, strange, and otherwise weird ways
used to play this with some old friends...
it is very wacky and very entertaining
a very wackly online game where you can host and invite people to it
it is board game online
https://www.boardgame-online.com/
its been a long while since ive done it
there is one thing we can try out
hmmm
i will keep musing...
go for it
i dont want to pressure them to do something under such short notice when it will basically screw up their sleeping time
i feel the same way but remember ibu's timezone
think, think, think...
i dont want to bug ibu about it because its so short notice for them
and two days... thats tuesday, right
mafia's too big an event for maria times
mmmm
as for what to do for maria's event...
fufufufufu
when they look it up in the substitute site its on, all they will get is an incomplete deck, `which only sports the 200 or so questions, and not the answers`
and i will not host my functioning cah deck until their dumb event is over out of spite
this is unreasonably specific, but the reason why is because now that im banned from valk, they will need someone to fill my shoes for the cards against humanities event
im not doing cah until september is over
who wouldnt
"no latooni, im not fucking the guns"
im glad you cracked that joke, because for a moment i was gonna go
so im satisfied
my consolation prize is really big fucking guns
well you know what
***im the seventh fucking wheel***
i really am the chris of the server
i cant believe it
`I'm officially the Chris of the server.`
i am officially the third wheel of the server
sauve
?
- all of my old reaction spots about symphogear are also gone to the wind
- all of my old meme posts are now gone to the wind, which is fine, because theyll keep using them anyway, much to their chagrin
- only the server staff hold the real truth to what happened, to which everyone else can easily lie about, because there are no public logs
ironically, with my subsequent ban and all my messages deleted, it means that:
i dont blame you for wanting to avoid that headache
the highlights involve hecate "nothing hurts me" dumbass agreeing with bingo about it all being public info and it not mattering, then me pulling out her server history which included not only two blatant porn servers but also a suspicious china town server, to which she basically said "lol that doesnt bug me in the slightest" and then me going "sure, i guess ill ping you in all of them when i join them all" and then her accusing me of harassment despite it all being public information, succintly proving the point on why its a fucking problem this is around in the first place
i do too
i dont like copying
plus if i did it it wouldnt be symphogames
its too big
im not doing symphogames for maria's birthday
also lost to time

then when serena came out i made up `SERENOW`
which i added as an answer to the sympho CAH
she was partially credited for the phrase `serenever` whenever serena talk came up
yeah she likes the ribbing
***BANANABASA***

the worst creation...
with all my messages deleted, i have finally been rid of the scourge of humanity
meanwhile i have just realized

looking back some of my early stuff was flat out weird
i know
and we ping amity
a serenacon channel but no one can post and its just the picture of serena bleeding out of her eyes
i liked mine better.

i also have the really fancy doomsday blend edit i did that i was unaware kid had a version he made himself beforehand
pizza.



french fry

maria had pineapple
tsubasa had french fry
kanade had pizza
theyre part of a set of meme edits where i gave each character a food item
these are old


let me show you
its a long story
i do have other pics but... theyre all pineapple themed...
honestly the one saki linked actually might be better
hehe
i know, i know
`CAPE MARIA A THOUSAND YEARS TIME`
CAPE!
but it is
a close contender
you can feel it in your bones.
we all know it
we already decided the icon beforehand for maria's birthday
games can be even bigger and it handles idlers
_It was at that moment that not only was R was immediately demoted and banned, but also executed at gunpoint._
`and ate it too`
sounds like you had your cake
it would likely be classified as emoji use
this is a good question though
Even doing the most innocous things
And yet the thought is on my mind daily
I don't want to do it either
But at least they would not have me binding them together, anymore
They will likely argue whos to blame and the funeral would probably end in a fist fight between them
My suicide note would say "If you wonder why I killed myself, know that my parents would rather blame each other over my death, than actually mourn me" with the backside saying "I never loved either of you"
Securing me psychologically into going through with it and killing me before they broke down the bathroom door
Them being alert would give me enough physical anxiety and panic to go on with it, as it'd be easier to die than face the consequences of dealing with my parents and explaining my feelings to them
More importantly, the shot would be to alert my parents, who would have likely heard it. My dad in particular is sensitive to the sound of gunshots
Both plans end with me sitting in the bathroom locking the door. I fire a test shot into the floor since I've only been taught to use a gun before, and have never physically used one. Shooting into the floor would give me the sense of familiarity I need to understand the feel of the recoil in my hands and confirm that I've set it up correctly
I don't talk about it, but I have very strong suicidal ideation about using my father's guns to kill myself. It's two plans: the first one is fooling my dad to give me the keys to get the revolver he keeps in his glove compartment with the six bullet loading sleeve it carries since it's not loaded, or using the black gun he has near me in the black filing box in the same room I use my pc in, then locate the ammo for it somewhere in the room. He keeps a lot of spare ammo around since he buys and hoards it, due to his gun hobby
I sorta qualify as someone who has an extremely high risk to suicide
Because... by it's classification
The second one... unsettles me
I'll need them for the future
Pin them both
Read them
Alright then
This is the method I chose after trying literally everything else
This is not my default method
I shut it down explicitly to give him direct advice cause he sorta wasn't listening
All he's been doing is an endless chain of suicidal ideation with responses just fueling him more
Figured with his channer background it'd give him some sort of wake up call and I absolutely made sure not to insult or say anything mean, just to shut down his constant self loathing
Well it's either that or we just flat out ban this talk because everyone's trying to get through to him with 0 result
`WHEEEEEEEN THE MOOOOON HIIIITS YOUR EYE LIKE A BIG PIZZAAAA PIE DAS AMMOOOOOOREEEEEEE`
whenever friends of mine on campus who were in a relationship started getting really lovey dovey with each other with me around on my laptop id change to this song and then slowly turn up the audio

DRAGONS - MUSK

but yes, behold saki
no whips
yall have fun first before doing that
also yeah thats to be expected, yall are doing the lovey dovey bonding, so no pressure on getting that done
`Behold.`

`I made it a reality.`
after much ribbing, and constant derailing...
back on valk long ago, when the new dragon kanade card came out, i made a constant joke of correcting dragon dusk to dragon musk

do you know of my greatest shitposting sin

the forbidden shitpost
ah yes
tomorrow im down
not today, i sleep soon
anything that needs to be paid for to use is considered a barrier in my book
im not against that idea but id also lean towards something more easily accessable
`golden succ`

also, who wants a golden succ wallpaper
which is why we've got other event generators to use
aight
IS MARIA'S BIRTHDAY TODAY OR TOMORROW
No skin off my bones
Sounds like he's pissed off about something else unrelated
He has like 0 wiggle room on this given how many times he was offroled in valk
He will need space to grow up a bit
If he acts up again don't hesitate to kick
As for popwobbles he lives for the edge and valk made him too comfortable
Because the rules are good
I do agree we need to work on the rules, but they need to be less of a rewrite and more fleshing out
Ah yes, popwobbles
I woke up what happened
oh yeah thatd be great
wb alice
take your time
hella
You should have me on steam I think so all you have to do is join my game
It's set to 4 people so if <@127644949884698624> wants to join in feel free
<@102691114762371072> aight, it's up,
Let me fire up gmod now and let it load
right now alice and i are at post game but i think we can still help you
ill be setting it up for 4 in case alice wants to jump in
ill be hosting this time since my computer can actually manage to host this, but as a peer-to-peer thing
this one has literally every single one
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1464410837
with ALL of my mods
i need to give you the other one
i think you may need all of my mods this time around since alice needed them
ive been playing it with alice and frankly its amazing
maybe we can try out jazzstronauts
if you want instead we can play dumb games to pass the time
i do not want to burden you with server stuff while doing this. even with all that, you probably have a lot on your mind
i cant help it.
still, i worry
well
oh
the emotional toll of leaving behind your parents, forging a new life, and balancing through unfamiliar terrain with little support outside of your brother and us, has a very strong toll
also you should most definitely focus solely on your thing right now
you posted a crop
okay
as someone who feels that a lot, we're here for you
yeah, welcome to my world
i know things are tense for you, and if you need some distance to cool off and do what you gotta do to get out by all means
he doesnt, but he wasnt giving hostile or bad advice, and lashing out at him for basically not doing anything aside from just simple input is not good
I am in hell
Right
Thats... 11:30 pm
How long will the both of you take
Aight
Self-loathing aside when I get back we gotta have A Meeting
I hate everything
Now I'm at a restraunt
I got dragged into it
It wasn't really for me
I've just been stuck in the doctors office for the last 4 hours
Of course
Oh geeze that sucks
I always just find it funny when my shitposts circulate
My adam chaos emerald shitpost
*eyes his chaos emerald shitpost in heiro, is amused*
gloriously
and just watch
we used to have pyborgs wherein we'd forcefeed it wikipedia articles
4 seasons, and 4 ovas worth of dialouge... consumed...
contemplate that saki
and it will learn it
you could forcefeed it the entire script of symphogear
also... in theory...
like... eerily alive
you master this and youll pretty much have a creepily alive bot
but yeah
its the hot topic phase of her life
point is this might help you save headaches down the line
by that logic you cant say you made kiribot either, since her base is nadeko
its allll in python
it is probably still one of the most powerful and realistic bot markov chain libraries you can find, barring things like jabberwocky and the like
pyborg also comes with the ability to unlearn words, and fix word libraries
it helps theyre in the same language
its built for irc but... with some fiddling, you might be able to easily adapt it into discord
into a command line module
pyborg is very powerful, and even comes with the ability to manually copy/paste LARGE amounts of text for it to learn from
https://github.com/bdrewery/PyBorg
let me show you what i used long ago, for irc
i think i have an idea that does not involve reinventing the wheel for you
hmmm
what are you writing the bot in
`we must make her feel more human`
to be honest, while a lower rate or working on a lower rate may help a bit, i think it is time to bring shirabe to The Next Level...
_nods_
shit, back when i had my own bot in irc it REALLY annoyed some people
and while the bot is a thing im very fond of, its easy to understand why it can annoy some people
saki, people who disagree with how something is done isnt someone we immediately write off; we listen to them just like we listen to anyone else
aight
if you want, sure
ill still be able to run the bigger events on weekends but for the most part everything i need to shove into everyone else's hands
and in my full honesty i feel neither one of the current staff should get it, which is a problem. saki because she is busy wrestling with MASSIVE life stuff that is infinitely more important than whatever we do, and latooni because they've been here the least amount of time between all of us across the board
`Someone's gotta get the big promotion...`
2. appointing someone as a custodian and getting maybe one more staff member in
someone's gonna have to run the weekly writing thing, someone's gonna have to do the stuff i normally do for days (didnt do it today 'cause i was stuck, annoyingly), handle the Bigger Things that crop up while im not around, etc
1. the distribution of what i do and events to other staff members
this means the following:
(when i mean here i mean my house)
because ive been trapped here for several months and id like to, well, have a life again
so. school is starting for me on the 20th. that means ive got another week and a half of raw free time until my entire time is consumed doing college stuff. that doesnt mean ill be going away, or stepping down. a lot of it will be due to the fact that ill be on campus from 12 to 9 to avoid my parents monday to friday, and actually getting to exist outside of college
aight
they can catch up with input later if you're really itching to hear me talk about what i need to say
though they dont really have to be
if saki and latooni are here
It's a "I need to talk about future things" meeting
It's not a bad meeting
depends on the threshold
so are you motioning for me to be demoted on the grounds of my volatility
it seems a bit unfair that your policy towards activity is excluded from someone who isnt very active; even in my least active moments ill still end up being more active on virtue of having my laptop on campus
it is
you do realize thats impossible, right, unless you plan to transfer ownership completely to someone
just presume a period of inactivity
i did sorta say i did not plan to step down
im fine where i am
and give her a more ominous shirabe avatar
yes
with pyborg you can actually get it to shut up while it learns
every two months is a good interval, and also when there are problems is a good flag
im down with both
both is fine
if its their behavior we just point it out to em and make sure it doesnt break the rules of our community
activity wise it'd be a bi-monthly thing
yes
and some moderating styles involve moderators being quiet, but there
that causes burnout to happen
but i also dont want to promote activity for activity's sake
i agree with it
but you are aiming this concern at me, someone who is presumably more active than the person you dont have a concern with
do i have the ability to defend myself
this is not a presidential campaign
i dont want to sway people
there just isnt much for me to say because i am pretty sure defending or rebuking some of these things will only earn more ire, regardless of their validity
im still here.
i do not doubt anyones ability to moderate
yes but that is less about moderating and more about how to structure our moderating
who are a fucking joke
it is the valk moderators
to be fair, it is not at the people here
nice
```I think I'd want to leave it up to her. You trust her implicitly, and I have no reason to doubt you on this.```
saki did
it happens
you are a good friend and comrade, and if things ever change for you in any way where more time would present itself, i would be more than happy to rope you in my stupid bullshit events
one of the main motivators for wanting to edge out your bot was because i felt relying on you for things when you literally have an incredibly hellish schedule programming train stuff is also inherently unfair to ask of you
but from a moderating perspective the literal only reason you are still staff is because alice wants you to, and nothing more
i think you are really cool and it is a genuinely shame you do not talk here more, because i feel we can be better friends given what im studying and what you do, and the cool projects you have in mind are both fascinating to watch and enjoy
lyssa is a gift but she is also never here, her absence is the reason why i pushed towards recruiting saki for so long. i dont mind if she stays on, though
okay
im sorry.
i would like to keep going but i have no control over this
do you want to continue this tomorrow
im being forced to sleep
as for anything else, i likely will not resort to anything.
valk is no longer a concern because i am banned from there. but, if an opportunity comes up, i will not hesitate to destroy them. i am sorry.
most factors tying into this are no longer a concern anymore. pittman has proven himself a good ally in furthering our goals, so there is no means to resort to dirty tactics. the results of what we did on r/anime have shown me we can play fair there.
i will trust you to it.
i just want to make sure that when they say so, they are doing so because i am crossing a line, and not to use it as a tool to silence my points
if someone says so, i will stop
im trying to
i exist to serve.
thats pretty much it.
if they dont have one neither do i
my reason is the reason of others
i exist for the will of those who keep me here
otherwise, lets get this over with
if you have any other questions, throw em at me
take from it what you will. demote me if you will.
those are my defenses
so, there you go
this was not the reason why i was upset. i was upset that something was being taken from my hands that i relied on to foster contact with the community with 0 substitute. latooni even understood this to be a bit absurd and commented about how i shouldnt immediately be shackled from this for demanding another means of getting the word out, which we ended up talking about
```"i wanna global ping a lot"```
i was not upset at the deadline, i was upset that i was being hassled for something while trying to enjoy something else when nobody else compartively displayed the drive to do it, while also simutaneously being talked down to about my abilities of getting things done. it was not fair that i had shown to always meet deadlines and be relatively on time with things when proposed if not earlier, and then suddenly be treated as if i was not. i was upset, and reminded alice that while i pour my all, i do these things for free, and that i too am human. true to my word, i completed it anyway, and with alice's editing, it was a stunning centerpiece to what seemed to be the most compelling display for r/anime's weekly event.
```"volunteering to do the spotlight intro and then getting angry when we pointed out the deadline"```
i really mean them. when i go out to do things, i could not care in the slightest whether or not people hate me for it. i dont care how many people oppose me. i dont care how many people vent at me for supposedly being wrong. im used to it. it has been my life since the age of 12. my brain is a train and it only stops for friends, or serving the interests of whatever it is i am doing. everyone who is in the way is promptly eviscerated. be it valk, reddit, or the entire world. that is the raw loyalty i put down for everyone who i support. that is literally my minimum.
```"let's break reddit rules because I don't like them"```
its why when things like
it is a harrowing reality that i deal with personally.
i am not now, nor ever doing good enough.
everything i feel about anything i do is constantly summed up as "not good enough"
writing stuff. creating hiero. watching shirabe do things. pitching ideas. i get no real joy out of them. all i get is satisfaction from being a positive part of a place.
those 6 hours doing mafia. nothing touched me. those pats on the back. nothing. nothing phased me.
i have an intense self-loathing towards anything i do. praise actually does not register to me at all. i am literally incapable of feeling any real positivity towards what i do. when i get involved with things, it is never for my own sake, but for someone elses, or just for my own curiosity. i dont take pride in anything. whenever people tell me i did a good thing i dont believe me.
again, badly
```I want to ask R about how he feels he's performed over the last month while I've been here```
lemme start again
gimmie a moment
yes, i got sidetracked
it literally exists because i shoved phpbb down his throat, which he hated, but it didnt matter because he botched the conversion anyway and got demoted and needed aera to take over temporarily
he is a fuck, and before he reformed actively told people to kill themselves, did shady deals with his server hosting, and had the mcf hosted on a forum software that was so devoid of functionality that it didnt even have ***personal messaging features***
but i remember his name is citricsquid
if he's changed his name i dont know
citricsquid
here's a fun fact about me
bad
```I want to ask R about how he feels he's performed over the last month while I've been here```
discord is a relatively new medium but many principles from irc still carry through.
i did it anyway because it was small, and it seemed like a genuinely nice place to make a difference as the One Good Anime Server
i do not belittle people, nor intend to belittle people when i say this. in fact, its probably the saddest statistic about me. so many years wasted on something i put so much heart and soul in, over something i cant even use on my resume. the founder of the minecraft forums hates my guts. everyone has forgotten me. the old guard there has moved on. its the same story everywhere else. they are all battered and sad stories that i dont reflect back happily on anymore. its why i was even hesitant to join the staff here at all. i even told alice when i joined this place that i really did not want to be staff.
i do not take pride or joy in doing this. but it is a factual reality. it is what i told alice from the very beginning when i recruited her. its why ive managed to ***teach her*** a lot of things. it is why i keep trying to impart my perspective into this place. because it is steadily reaching the numbers i used to deal with long ago. the community is almost hitting 500 members. the irc i used to administrate 800 ***active*** users. i dont wave it around a lot and try to avoid that because i prefer just talking things through and letting things establish themselves through empirical fact. but sometimes i just feel i need to remind people that i used to do this hardcore, in my blood, when i was just ***sixteen***. it is why i also tell alice not to follow in my footsteps. because looking back at it, ***it sucked hardcore***. there are traumas locked away there i still dont want to look back on. moderator decisions that people hated so much that the whole community turned against me, only for it to work out completely in the end. raw, painful whiplash of people who worship you, then hate you, then worship you again, then hate you, then forget about you.
```"he constantly waves his incredible amount of experience over our heads like that automatically makes him right"```
i am trying to be more positive. i am trying to be nicer. i am trying to be more compassionate. it is difficult. i see problems and my immediate heartfelt response is to destroy the response at any cost.
and i am trying to improve on lashing out. i am being honest. i know it is a monumental problem. i know that i have anger issues. i know that it hurts people without meaning to. i know that it will hurt them regardless of whether i apologize. i know it will still hurt regardless of the apology. it hurts to know this. it hurts to know that even when i do my best, it isnt enough anyway, because i am still harming things around me.
i am sorry if you were hurt in my raised tension. its not my intention to hurt people. it just means that doing this- doing what we do here- means ***that*** much to me. i sink heart and soul into things. every moment something is implemented or discussed is basically a make or break decision that could improve or hurt our server for the worst. these are things that keep me up at night. these are things i think about constantly. how to improve things, and make sure people are happy and satisfied while also making sure theyre not terrible fucks, or can be better than terrible fucks.
yes, i have. ive yelled because you were obstinate about a point that was counterintuitive to managing the server in a healthy way. i did not mean it to harm you, but thats simply who i am. im passionate about making sure things are executed in a way wherein the users do not feel pressured or cornered. the bit that led to the internal rules i specifically raised hell for because i wanted to make sure the opposing line of development, which was warning people for little things that could be talked through to avoid contextualizing a warn log for simple things that can just be taught as opposed to punished through recorded log, was stifled. because it was bad. because in basic psychology, positive punishments (i.e. adding a negative thing to something) is nothing compared to rewarding good behavior, and making sure the ***principle*** of the rule is imparted, as opposed to enforcing the consequence.
```"he's yelled at me, on no less than two occasions, over disagreements,"```
this is an unfair citation as its not relevant to any staff or community thing whatsoever. in fact, this is an incorrect generalization of why i was upset: i wasnt upset because i didnt like how she rp'd her own character, i was upset because she rp'd her character in such a way that it broke everything i planned and led the narrative down something she did not like, despite me going with it alongside its consequences. i felt it was not fair to take that route and hold me to that when i was playing a specific character (tsubasa) with a personality antithesis to her own character. we talked this through after my heated moment, and resolved through it regardless. to note, latooni even sympathized with this.
```"he flew into a tantrum because he didn't like the way you RP'd your own character,"```
i cannot in good conscious treat them with any sort of professionalism or even acknowledge them when they are as they are. it is completely antithetical to my being, and no matter how far you demote me, i will carry those feelings until i die.
alice, for a fleeting moment, actually genuinely convinced me that we could work together with valk back when we unveiled the wiki project together, and those feelings have long since defenestrated.
getting banned on valk is probably the best thing ever and ill probably want to keep it that way. ive never wanted relations from them from the beginning. alice can recall the endless conversations we've had about my feelings of even ever bothering to associate with them
i did, and i do not regret it. in fact, it has been a complete improvement of my life experience. to cite, alice would have a nasty habit to pester me into valk arguments to see their latest stupidity while i was sorta minding my own business. i hate them to the core, and im glad that i left spitting in their eye, and will probably keep spitting in their eye until they day they either die or i die. that being said, i also have a brain about these things, and have sworn off talking in the staff server to valk staff. if they have anything to say to me, they can say it to some other staff member. ive made it clear in the past that they have not nor desired to acknowledge me as any sort of staff even before this, and that they had this coming for a long time. i refuse to offer my professionalism to people who cannot even properly pm a warn to someone, and instead actively act in shady pms cornering people to deal with them. this cannot, and will not change, and i will probably refuse to change this about myself until they either change ***tremendously*** or again, if im dead.
```"he yelled enough on Valk, past warnings, to get banned,"```
i will go piece by piece
this will take a bit then.
goodnight.
`wrong channel`
because only latooni had the floor
but also to continue from last time are there any other questions
no
im here
`the dawn of a new era...`
`lyssa has changed her avatar...`
hella
i hope
without interruption
if you ever want to try jazz again i should be able to
cant go wrong with cats
hows it faring in your boss's place
tell me when you want to continue it
im here now fully
Might go back to sleep in a few hours
Back hurts
Couldn't sleep
I'm awake
alice is a breath of fresh air compared to the apathetic, egomaniacal, incompetent, hostile maniacs i have worked with
i just wanted to highlight the things we've talked about before and how i feel that factors into my 0 reason
there's 0 reason
power is power, and ultimate power is ultimate authority regardless of presentation
you cant... nerf yourself? with supplementary roles that limit you
discord is designed that way
founder level access follows you regardless of what role you have
yeah it wouldnt make sense
you are not going anywhere from that position, and i would sooner quit than to see your status as owner moved to anyone else, including me
and you care.
because you listen
you care very much, and despite your inexperience, you've succeeded in where most people would usually fail
you care
the people who have had, on paper, more experience than you, have more often than not failed, because theyve completely misunderstood their positions as something akin to "this is my fiefdom and i can get lazy with it while not caring about anything and growing increasingly disconnected to the community as possible"
or having so little vision that they were taken advantage of easily and exploited by bad actors to bog down their staff
whether it was plotting to get rid of them somehow because of the fact that they were such a trash human being that they kept breaking the very rules they set up in the community /publically/
people who have had such poor vision, such absolute uncaringness, such raw apathy, that the community turned on them every single damn time.
ive dealt with many stupid and inept founders in the past, who on paper would indeed have more experience than you
and that is fundamentally the most flawless means of being a server owner and founder possible
but you listen. you dont intervene unless you have to. you give space for people to operate with. and you do well with organization
you are the least qualified person in this server. you have 0 experience. from the very moment i got into a staff position, i had to teach you the basics of moderating from scratch, and how things flow in a community and how interaction and having things to do in a community fosters community growth. ive made literal flowcharts explaining these ideas to you, back when i was pitching ideas. you've admitted before in the past that you prefer taking the back seat and letting folks do things for you than actually do them. you were a doormat to some people who were making your life miserable and directly threatening you with 0 means to fight back.
demotion it is
im waiting for everyone else's input
body part wringing
i am stepping down because of frustration felt from the moderators, but the public explanation is that im going to be busy with schoolwork, which is ironically what set off this conversation in the first place
yes
its mostly so valk does not get the impression its being done because of them, and then feel compelled to exploit the knowledge to their advantage
im the one that suggested it, so yeah
kiri confirmed narc
it would be nice to get my black cape color again
if you want to try it out, go for it
i suppose that is true, though im surprised alice is going with it given her own thoughts on identifying colors
go for it
(no dont do it)
yes
gotta sit in the benches with adam and his chaos emerads
illuminati becomes the cis male zone
`also that would make me the only illuminati and that would make me feel weird`
in light of my demotion there does not seem to be anyone else left. my vote against saki was not even because of experience, but rather because she has a lot to deal with in life right now and i do not want to burden her.
i have stories
`fou`
i cant believe we missed obama's birthday
what about barack obama
much better
hex is #CFE9E3 toy with it until its light theme friendly

you can probably get away with using this for cag's color, since its defined seperately enough from elfneins
it looks like monkey poop
because its like
i just really hate that shade of green
you can get away with tealing it up
yeah but more people associate her with her hair color, which is a bright aqua
that kind of olive for cagliostro? eugh
`I WILL SULLY MY HANDS IN THIS DEVIOUS CAPITALISM`
ill save up kiricoins EXPLICITLY to BUY MY CAPE BACK
fine
`i hope you add in a secret Color Me Cape role`
like i said, germain's color isnt actually greenish because its supposed to be more like a stylized pearly white thats contrasted with the rest of the coloring, but thats a close enough approximination thats friendly for light and dark themes
good enough

....finding my own damn shitposts in google search
because light mode is the devil's work
grandma a bad bitch at heart
and just LOOK at that pose
having her be a seperate party entity thats occasionally friendly with SONG but ultimately has her own interests wouldve been so fucking cool
remembering scenes like these makes me sad she didnt live

as an aside
hair at night

hair in daylight

but stylized as a very very very light green in lighting
because the thing with saint germain's hair is that its actually white
absolutely nowhere near that shade of green
as someone who has studied saint germains hair color to the extent where cracked a "saint germain is maria 2.0" joke by swapping her hair color, her hair is like
illuminati green is DEFINITELY not saint germain's hair color
why not individual colors for saint germain/cags/prelati
mmmm.
ohhhh
wasnt it already
its counterintuitive to being a ninja
ogawa doesnt get a role because getting a role would spot him
thats good

ALONGSIDE OTHER THINGS
ALRIGHT I FOUND IT
found a cameo of me

`It is time to use nyaa.si`
this is starting to get annoying
alright
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLm-jeFj3tk
i found /that/ scene
oh no
`CHOSSEI! CHOSSEI! CHOSSEI! YASSAI MOSSAI! YASSAI MOSSAI!`

_spirit in the sky intensifies_
_eyes Fine_
lydian actually was a private christian school
oh shit, i forgot
hibiki, and miku, two very gay women, gay with each other, thoroughly confused: `what`
chris: `We gotta keep things straight.`
`i am amused`
flipping through the ova and watching tsubasa be on a game show
"BUY BUY BUY" "SELL SELL SELL" ***"DESS DESS DESS!"***
laidess'z faire
THE KIRICONOMY
shul shagana chris shows up in the gx ova, right
im gonna go... `all out...`
can you relink me the big kiricoin again
aight
also sure
im going to create the currency, make sure nobody knows who the hell i am, and keep a massive share of it to myself in a wallet absolutely no hacker can seem to access
also since im at my comp do yall want an HD VERSION of kiricoin
im going to own 51% of all kiricoin. youll see. YOULL ALL SEE.
`IT WAS ALL LUXURY SPACE COMMUNISM ALL THIS TIME`
_TAKES OFF CURTAIN_
THE CAPITALISM IS A RUSE
THATS RIGHT
same with colors
theyre just another means to express ourselves
kiricoins are not a real economy and probably should not be treated as such outside of basic economic principles
you cant game a system for something to be achieved if the means to achieve it can just be done without it
like, thats that
keep it
you can just
you see: if there's a large amount of people who, by demand of kiricoin, REALLY want to keep that emoji
there is a better way to handle emoji demands for people in groups who really want the emoji
besides
i fully expect people to get excited about it at first, sure, but i feel the empowerment down the line will be more from an individual, as opposed to a communal, effort
by its nature it is temporary
the emoji system in our place is fleeting
the average user doesnt really fiddle much with bot stuff unless they have direct benefit to them. what we'll be implementing will, but people arent that invested in bot stuff generally unless its something with global and permanent ramifications
you're also smart enough to be staff
and i am staff, so that isnt happening
excluding me
nobody here is smart or energetic enough to do this
yeah but valk's stupid shit is low effort
`Yeah, see, we made a pact with the :TsubasaSquat: people just the other day. They don't touch our'a turf, we don't touch theirs. Anytime either of us low on funds? We send'a few checks in the mail, easy peasy.`
fucking emoji mafias
`YA WANNA DO IT? YA WANNA MAKE THE KANADE CRY? SHE'S ALREADY A DEAD LESBIAN, YA DON'T NEED /SAD/ DEAD LESBIANS ON YER CONSCIENCE.`
`EVERY KIRICOIN YA SKEEVE OUT ON FUDNING THIS HERE EMOJI IS ANOTHER 15 MINUTES KANADE CRIES IN HEAVEN`
`Alright. Yer all in the Kanade club now. Ya know what that means. We only got 2 rules 'round here. 1. Ya gotta love Kanade from the bottom of your heart. 2. Ya gotta pay your monthly 500 Kiricoin due, so that the Greatest Kanade Emoji Ever will ***never*** go away.`
like im sorry but thats just the funniest shit to me
ill laugh so hard
crabs n shit
everybody drags each other down in this systems
thats like capitalism 101
nobody's gonna cough up their own cash to sustain an emoji when it means space to pitch their own
like thats so unfathomably stupid
i dont think that joke will happen
`BREAK HIS KNEES UNTIL HE COUGHS UP DA DOUGH.`
`Ya didn't pay yer dues... you don't want the shiny Kanade emoji ta' go away, do ya?`
the fucking emoji yakuza
if people start racketeering to support a specific emoji im gonna laugh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgct3Jn8pFA
consider the following:
nah
honestly? thats fine, yeah
EVEN THOUGH ITS COINS
FOR ***CASH***
the cape... is GOING GREEN.
mark my words
im going to game this economy
c... cape... cape...
i really do feel naked without a cape role.
man
oh right true
...im surprised we didnt do a more solid gold color for Fine
wb
_quietly watches chad explicitly vent about quinn_
feels good. feels organic.
feels good
CAPE...
MMMMMMMMMMMMM
***YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS***
YES
TES
ah, alright, i get it
ohhhhhhh
basically the legacy color roles
'color me kirika' and 'akatsuki kirika'
just delete em?
what do we do with the duplicate roles
tell me when it is up so i can... cape...
a VERY rich indigo
like a rich indigo
its more like an...
to be fair its not purple
that color good?
anyway
like putting away nesquik powder in the fridge and going "brain, no, wait, that does not go there"
like, i catch myself, but they are "misplacing things in wrong places" levels of bad
`listen i can be extremely dumb sometimes when i am not fully focused`
before that i thought yall were just copy/pasting chunks somewhere
yeah but my brain processed it like now
that seems like the best but if you need others i can get em
oh right i forgot kiri can do hex codes
miku is a much deeper purple
lemme check if it doesnt clash with other premade colors
thats good
try that
#605E96
gimmie a moment
yeah...
mmmm
how would #2E2D48 look
ill need this for reference
CAPE!
that isnt black
ill pitch a cape color
fine
WELL `GIVE ME ONE`
***LIKE RED ALERT 2!***
THE CAPITALISM WAS JUST A GAME TO KEEP US PREOCCUPIED WHILE THE LUXURY SPACE COMMUNISM DID EVERYTHING FOR US
Also true
That is an important side to consider
Consider also that if every major argument ends like this however, it can reinforce the notion that nothing can end without moderator intervention
This is true
The latter does not
The former demonstrates it as a safe space users can trust
There is a difference between a user venting and being helped through a really bad time, and this
Every event like this only worsens the channels reputation
That's why I said we should think of one
I don't have the solution
I think we should likely think of something to restructure serious discussion in a way that prevents these things from happening in the future
It's an inevitability
Hazel will be back though
Agreed
What was hazels pronouns again
Hazel will likely return
Alice's warns were definitely deserved
It is likely for the best that hazel left
This is a complicated issue, because I do not want to presume I know about a religious and cultural conflict I have no cultural relation with
Anyway
Of course it would be vali who posts it
Catching up still now
I just woke up and read this all up
Wait...
Have fun
...did Joe just ask for color me elmo
Unless she just decides to idle in valk, which is pretty ironic to contemplate
I can expect to see her back in a few months, maximum when April comes around with the new season
Time erodes shame
Discord, by that logic, is even less so, since instead of seeing people connect and disconnect in one window, it's all hidden in one channel that pings no one that can be muted by the user
And IRC by default telegraphs publically when people connect or leave a channel
Saw this shit happen in my irc days over bigger outrages
Doesn't matter
More often than not users that leave that have been involved or had a presence in a community will come back at least once
Its not arrogance
Point is they'll be back
That don't stop stones from rolling
You're right, she'll probably avoid them all
We're about as good as it gets aside from maybe the touhou server
Then reality will hit her hard when she shows up to other anime communities
If hazel feels this place pisses her off
Bingo was not wrong, as jacq has come back multiple times before, they just stayed in our server this time
Boomerang effect
Even if Hazel says she won't come back, she'll be back
Court adjourned, bring out the dancing lobsters
Anyway
`That's why I'm saying to keep a close eye`
That's why I'm saying to keep a close eye
It is
Vali literally said similar things and didn't get heat for it
Even though their views were aligned
And validating people shitting on hazel
He was literally laughing in the channel
It's trolling 101
He literally just sat there and laughed
It seems suspiciously convenient that vali posted what is usually a controversial topic, left, then came back and laughed at the results
Keep an eye on vali
As an aside
no i just cant do the @ thing from here
did hazel leave again?
wait
how do i do the log warn command again
still gotta warn hazel though
also solopy left
anything less is lying
given this isnt the first time it happens, and given that we want to maintain transparency about these things and do what we say, it needs to be formalized
repeatedly
to solo
its because you explicitly said she would
its not whether i think so
because <@!127644949884698624> you did say she would, even though you pm'd her personally before saying you couldnt find much fault
does hazel still get the warn even though she left and came back
here is today's question of the day
anyway
hazel is saying it (foolishly) from an anti-establishment point of view
its because saying "i dont recognize israel as a state" is an extremely controversial thing to say, and something most major anti-semites say
like clockwork
hazel's back
also, speak of the devil
predictably his next words will be "you are restricting my free speech doing this"
this is one of the people who wanted to question the rules a long time ago back when we had to deal with rukia over what is considered offensive and what isnt
a lot of irony.
there is irony in this conversation

Thanks mom
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
*slowly falls apart*
`I don't feel so good...`
Alice....
THE WORKSHOP HAS ***UNO***
UNO
Good luck
Kaliks will also be back though
Don't need to be on their server to put 2 and 2 together
Both are on the valk server
I say this because kaliks left randomly
Likely venting about how he was warned
Whining
It seems solopy is nothing about us on valk, and kalik left in solidarity
IM GONNA FUCKING PLAY CHESS IN SPACE

I rolled a 20 for an str check on table flipping
I will mahjong when I learn it
Time to solitaire
OH SHIT I CAN MAHJONG
This is so wild
Oh here's the single player stuff
how do i... spawn things...
amazing
this has direct irc configuration
FUCK YEAH TABLE FLIPPING
I FLIPPED THE TABLE I'M GONNA CRY
AAAAAAAAA
I NEED TO IMPORT THE HONEWORLS PANORMAXA
I CAN SCRIPT THINGS IN REAL TIME
Fuck this has homeworld style selection this is so cool
THIS GAME HAS CUSTOMIZABLE BACKGROUNDS
`you can't refute me on this either since i was right about hazel,`*`ominous finger wag`*
mainly because he writes and we're the most active symphogear related writing circle; valk has not nor will never do anything with its writing circle, and he lives on feedback to an extent of raw desperation
solopy will be back too.
anyway
okay doke
anyway, TABLETOP TIME
aight
and in turn, it will backfire on you
because people will hold you to them
also alice a word of advice: i know you feel hazel probably doesnt deserve a formal warn, and maybe you're right, but in future reference, dont say things you might not actually do
got it
aight
im asking so i know better beforehand if i need to warn because `i have not actually used the warn function`
does it work for you because you manually include the whole name or does your status as founder like autofill it regardless of what channel you're in
that works too
the angle im trying to warn you about is the reason why i am saying we are not therapists
that i did not know
his motor skills for typing were fine
he was talking about how he was wanting to be /drunk/, but he's very explicitly not drunk talking about this
he wasnt drunk.
read up
band-aid's useless. conversation died down anyway. if he starts up again ill tell him.
sure; be here to do it
where, in literally anything that ive said, did i insinuate that you have not helped suicidal people in the slightest; the problem isnt whether or not we're even capable of helping him, its that we as a whole entity, with people aside from us, cannot help him like this, and doing something to address that is important
you are limited in not physically being present in wfc's life to help him, as literally all of us are
like, to be clear: this is a problem none of us are exempt from. even alice, who is probably the most knowledgeable in this subject, is limited by a lot
understanding this fundamental difference is the line between a place that can genuinely help and push you to the direction you need, and a place thats absolutely miserable that consists of people venting raw depression without anything constructive coming from it, thereby dropping morale
there's a very big difference between "i feel as though i have very strong desires to kill myself" and having an active support network of people around you to help you through that, and "i think i am going to kill myself later" while said supposed support network racks their brains trying to fruitlessly think of a way to help that only a real professional can
we cannot encourage this behavior; we're not therapists. the dude needs help, and we're not the place for it, and masquerading as such for these types of issues will only really drag things down in the long run
and then what, latooni? have people constantly talk about how theyre going to kill themselves, and watch as people try to help with no avail, and feel pressured to help with something they have 0 knowledge on what to do?
we do not have the therapeutic chops to handle this kind of stuff
he's literally threatening to kill himself
okay, this shit with kanadeanon is seriously going too far
MOM SAID I CAN HAVE PUDDING TONIGHT AND THATS GOOD ENOUGH
i have saki's word and thats good enough
ITS REALLY, REALLY GOOD
DL DID A REALLY COOL POWERPOINT THING AND I WANNA PIN IT BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU FOR PERMISSION FIRST

ALICE
alice
aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyGFM5CGnoo
thanks senketsu
because he was, because i needed him to be so i could get people out from their shells and share their stuff like we do today
i guess its more accurate to say "im glad he no longer represents a fundamental touchstone in our community as opposed to back when it was smaller and it was only him actively advertising his written work"
that was bad phrasing on my part
and solopy percieved himself as someone with influence
because i do not like having assholes have potential influence
but he already showed signs of reaching this point long before the both of you were staff, and i really did not like relying on him to carry around the torch of "a big symphogear writer in our community"
and of course
i relied on him a long time ago because he was one of the few active writers to which i could springboard writing events on, and encourage others to follow suit
solopy was a raw nihilist in the guise of realism
but if someone is a nuisance and is useless, then thats two marks on them
no
Not 'others will be like him'
As in others will recognize he's useless
he outlived his usefulness, and served his purpose as a springboard for other aspiring writers. the moment he finished his story was the moment i stopped having stock in him, and in time, so will others
to be honest, im glad hes gone
whatever narrative solopy writes is inherently incorrect, and in the event people try to confront us about it (they wont), we'll now have ammunition towards it
because hazel was spoken to and warned as well
they cant
```Oh well. If someone wants to call us hypocrites because we allow users to decry Israel and compare a literal country to transgender people then whatever.```


***SATAN'S GAME***

OH NO
IT HELPS WHEN YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY IRL FRIENDS WHO PLAY IT

WE ARE PLAYING POOL
***POOL***
If they still won't stay despite that then it's no skin off my bones
Please make sure to correct them immediately
Where are they talking about this
Except we did warn her
WHATS THE PASSWORD
oh wait where we talkin then
do you want me to host the room or should you
oh i meant val's corner but either one
lemme brb real quick first
saki's server works
you will have to hold my hand on some things because while i grasp the game there's a lot of tools whose usage confuses me
name the game and its on
ABSOLUTELY
<@99695384296701952>
whats up
`i see it too now...`
i...
...
i
I


have some ryokobot concept avatars
<@99695384296701952> im reorganizing images on my desktop and cleaning things up
ill discuss why i feel that is an issue when you return from your vacation
it is not at that extent yet
because ive known of communities just our size who have had these problems and have had to /ban/ suicidal talk because the encouragement of people visibly talking about how they want to kill themselves offset other people in turn, and encouraged enough negativity in a vent channel where no one could talk about their problems
i came straight here to talk about it for a reason
but also i have enough brain cells to warn of another, related thing that can be a problem to the community down the line
i have enough brain cells to know when to not do a thing that i am unequipped to handle
whatever you say.
sure
because it is sort of important to address
the literal only thing ive done was 1. bring this here, and 2. at you in serious discussion as a note to look there
do you see me having done anything whatsoever?
latooni even felt that despite agreeing with my stance, they did not want to censor this at all, in which there is a difference between censoring this and letting this go unfettered
2-3 days from now
none of them are pointing out this problem, let alone noting this
do not say those things when they can find you legal trouble
it is /illegal/ of you to claim that
you do not have a license
you are not one either
kerrik and outside are big nonos
yeah
would a `'STRAYA` timezone be compatible
i would suggest lauren but i hardly know her
agreed
we can look at other candidates
why not review the other members in our community and see if any of them fit given when theyre awake and their timezones
hyperfocusing on one person to solve a problem that requires better vetting is not the way to go
yes, it is, and it is a valid opinion to say?
even in all my yelling i never once did that
im fine with not having the power to choose but shutting someone down when theyre trying to say something because theyre a tier lower than you really leaves a bad taste in my mouth
my opinion
i ask because that was exactly what i was offering
okay
or potential mod candidates
am i not allowed to... state my opinion on mods in here
_rolls eyes_
i like parm, but i do not know parm well enough to say-
...let's slow our roll on that
to be fair, literally saying "i dont recognize israel as a state" is an extremely dangerous statement and we probably should have come down on her harder for that
sort of a "what to do to avoid escalating discussions into yelling sessions" thing
i will still probably work on the serious-discussion guide regardless
i suppose my lens are a bit more tinted since im used to people in other communities leaving for less or percieving things even harder even after constant clarification
alright then...
i see
they know you're jewish, though, parmesan follows you on twitter and solopy has been here quite a long while
i may make a serious-discussion guide on how to handle situations like this on the user level in the event that people fly off the handle again
im just saying that if they still feel that way after all the corrections and telling them what went on, im not going to lose any sleep over it
they are, and you just said after what i said that they might come back
except we made it clear in all of those public warns that it was not due to anti-semeticism, and we have corrected the person with telling them that the person they think was not punished, was also punished
?
and it is an extremely bad experience
very hard
because i have also lived through that before
i just dont want to exist doing things with the pretense of "you can give your thoughts on things" and then potentially be told "dont bother saying your thoughts on things because you do not meet the tier required for them to be valid"
ive lived it
im aware
okay
we can still voice our opinions, right
aight
they sound like a good fellow
go for it then
mainly because i dont know scrmz that well outside of mafia and fucking about with tabletop sim
i dont really know what else to discuss
okay
that is convenient
i dont know him well enough for cons and thats probably a con in of itself
hes got experience
he actually manages the konosuba discord
okay then yeah he's good
(scrmz is fergus right)
scrmz is actually pretty okay
kerrik is pretty immature, outside seems very... dubious
i want to see how other people hosting it would go down
who wants to test drive hosting a writing topic/week this week
also, as another, unrelated aside
Yes it does
Yeah he is
RAW, NO HOLDS BARRED BEATDOWNS
HER ONLY WEAPON IS HER FUCKING FISTS
AND HER NP IS LITERALLY TJROWIMG TARASQUE DOWN ON SOMEONE AND PUNCHING IT ON THEM ROAD ROLLER STYLE
Swimsuit Martha too, she's a Ruler and SHE PUNCHES
I fucking got saint Martha so a thousand times yes
I looked away to engage in hedonistic gacha pleasures
...what did I miss
ill probably be already screeching by then.
you dont even gotta tell me
`Oh.`
im just wondering who
no no i know what it is
`INVALIIIIID USSSSEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR`
IM STILLLLLLLLL IN A DREAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
i feel the rules need a more thorough rewrite and rewording but for now this is a good thing to carry us through until it happens
this works
surprising
also solopy is back
we really need to enforce that better
tch
```I already asked, it's about how non-nsfw channels just get kinda... nsfw.```
she's already shown signs of lurking far before this
judging from things, i find it of low likelihood that it was the israel thing that put them off. rather, i sense its just their introverted nature putting them off to the increased activity in the server, and just wanting to take a small break away from things that they have fun with but also find mentally taxing
they should tell me what they feel comfortable telling me without me wringing it from them
i dont want to pry further for the sake of not putting them off
i wouldnt worry about this too much though i feel this is a sign that we should probably do things to raise morale

theyre just taking a break from the server
almost tempted to message em about it but i dont want to intrude
what the hell is going on
lucifer left?
_raises brow_
ill put up the prompt, then
alright
so now i am re-suggesting it
but now i am not good
and at the time i went "im good for now"
you did
and id like to foster the confidence to say "well, the community can do this kind of stuff while i am busy doing college stuff"
since i am usually the one to visibly execute them and push them until theyre done
im a bit pushy on this since, well, one of the things i did explicitly talk about was that i worry that if i take a step back, there wont be people doing events or engaging the community anymore
this is less calling on you and more calling on A Staff Member to do it
...so, anybody?
i really would like someone to try because it will give me more ease in handing off things i do to other people instead of the constant anxiety i feel of "if i dont run events literally no one else here will"
thats when prompts get posted
i dont like pressuring people but youve got a day to think about it since tomorrow's monday
_offers baton_
that sounds like something someone who could be hosting the writing event could set up
additionally, we prod people occasionally to talk about their progress and see how they feel about the topic itself by @ing the group and then discussing about it, getting feedback not only from the amount of submissions we get, but from the quality of the prompt itself
so right now the weeky writing prompt is in a state of experimentation wherein whoever hosts it can pitch ideas to it to help raise interactivity (within a given limit since i dont want to go too radical on it)
for one thing, ive been currently experimenting with user submitted prompts in an attempt to see if it was me that was responsible for the lower amount of submissions going on; last weeks prompt was actually a user submitted prompt, and it had the same amount of submissions as the last one which was of my own design, which was 4
its not that straightforward
I'm in hell
i wont be here during the morning
_...with confetti_
_preps rifle_
damn.
<@!127644949884698624> did you buy the axz design archive? `are ya gonna scan that shit`
wait
`'STRAYA`
lauren is pretty cool but i know her even less than scrmz and unlike scrmz i cant validate if she has any prior experience at all
id push for scrmz
alright
because... i gotta show you it
of course after you gay it up with lyssa
because... `jazz...`
alice when will you be home btw
with alice
i agree
its probably where the heart of all this is
this is a problem of semantics, and schematic framing
hazel does, because her viewpoints are anti-establishment; its why when solopy pointed out america does worse things, hazel explicitly said "yes, i know, i dont recognize them either"
you do not need to denounce a country's existence in order to criticize it
the best way to approach this is likely through optimal wording. to be anti-israel, is to be anti-semitic. but to criticize what israel does towards a minority is not anti-semitic, its anti-establishment
its why i said hazel chose the worst wording possible, because solopy is sorta right when he points out that people who denounce israel also have a habit of strong anti-semitism
the word you're looking for is anti-establishment, which is the word i attributed to hazel's perspective on the matter when she voiced not recognizing israel as a country
...wait
Until now
Seeing that only excacerbates it ten fold
My mood is already poor getting dragged across miami achieving nothing we planned to do for errands
Even though I really really want to
But I'm not going to
The fact that they may be using an obsolete group talk to underhandedly just talk to you while circumventing what we officially agreed would be the space to discuss things already makes me want to yell at them, and reminding them that the channel still exists away from most of our staff already gives them the bright idea to just take things there and shut out any other staff
I just don't want to hear of them
I don't care
Didn't even ask for my permission if that's the case
I have nothing to say about their stupidity and honestly am trying my damndest to ignore it before I rage again
Alright
Don't bring it up there, I don't even understand why the channel is even still in use
You do understand the tactic behind that, yeah
He's replying to you in a smaller space only you're in
Them
No, not you
To corral discussion to a place where you have less voices in play
You do realize this is an incredibly underhanded strategy to take, yeah
I used to be there until I ditched it for what was presumably the more complete staff chat
Yeah, it is
You do realize they're discussing it outside of where we agreed to move discussion
6 hours straight...
I'm so tired...
I am the R
I will upload last submissions when I get home
Make sure to post it in the subreddit as well <@99695384296701952>

that always left a bad taste in my mouth and i even pointed this out
back on valk they got reprimanded for live-blogging their experience of doki doki literature club, while mine was not only encouraged, but even given its own channel
i hope jay makes use of live-shitposting
i will keep this information to myself.

it doesnt
```vali's narrative will be a bit biased```
im pretty sure hes lying in some way, but with it only coming from him, well
aight
vali's narrative will be a bit biased
im especially interested because i want to know if vali harassed her off the server
press ibu to ask about snowaru and what happened between her and vali
oh, awesome, thats exactly what i was going to ask for
<@!127644949884698624> , are you busy right now
folks like him are a dime a dozen.
i know you do, but im just saying, this is sort-of the behavior i anticipate
this is sorta why
remember how i said before that it seemed interesting that vali brought up the israel thing, left, and then laughed at it all when he saw it unfold
they left randomly with no explanation, and with this cropping up, i feel there is an incomplete story at play
im curious because id like to follow up with snowaru's sentiments

i ask because
Guess who's going to get up at 7 with 0 sleep
Thus keeping me from sleeping
But guess who refuses to sleep
Also I should be asleep
Find it funny he literally went "Don't worry I play it smart" while literally confessing he harasses servers for fun
Yeah
we have a long list of them
anyway, welcome!
i feel so good now.
6 straight hours of raw sleeping action
`The Good Nap...`
this rare experience is...
sorry for not being in `The Ceremony` but i woke up at 7 am to get blood drawn and then i had an incredibly rare experience
oh shit scrmz is here
no this is seperate
like i absolutely need you to because right now im actually scared of continuing to play new game plus
its really important
like
on my end
i... really, really need you to come see something
but...
scrmz can play with us with you hosting
this may work in our favor
...
sure, i just hope progress doesnt stifle
uhhhh
also we can bring mami here since she's hosting it and ive always felt bad that she doesnt get the recognition she deserves for doing so
and we can continue the pattern of slowly draining valk's userbase piece by piece.
that way people who are interested in doing wiki stuff, but see that valk does no wiki things, can come to us
while valk rots
then we take it on ourselves to keep our chunk of the wiki community active
not that it matters, because not a single staff member has bothered to even register into the wiki
i was contemplating continuing with the desire to have every community open up their own channel dedicated to working on the wiki, but lean towards keeping ourselves and /sgg/ members as staff to have active editors to fix information where needed. we would not promote valk staff
i have an idea what we can do
i dont want to pull out fully
we opened up the scope of the wiki to involve all the symphogear community that isnt wikia
all symphomods + wiki stuff
and for /sgg/'s flaws, they are at least ***competent*** and ***consistent***
we are ironically on better terms with them than valk, because unlike valk, symphogi fucking listens
founder of the /sgg/ discord
that works
alice you should probs tell symphogi to add scrmz to the staff chat
we just keep it under wraps
though development has halted and i may have to talk about just making it public, and yeah
we are also secretly working on a symphogear wiki
oh right!
also hibiki's next in september
<@!102691114762371072> `was this a bot command`
...was it
theyre pinned
we also do birthdays
then there's the list of subreddit stuff i want to do but that is more its own beast so to speak
we've been thinking of other stuff besides that
you remember mafia, yeah?
we also have server events planned, ill likely want to get some other server events going while the currency is being developed so we can test what people respond to well and dont
you can see discussion of it in <#466821423550300180>
we're still hammering it out
maybe earlier
feburary might be the starting month, around there
symphathizer
we'll be coordinating a rewatch with our good friend pittman, a mod on r/anime, who wants to do a rewatch which we'll be rolling with
the currency you already discussed, and yeah that too
<@!127644949884698624> @ me when you're ready
its ripped from valk's server
yes it is
partly because ive secretly hated the design of that timeline, and partly because i dont want quinn to have any sort of satisfaction that we use any material of hers whatsoever
sometime this week im going to redesign that timeline into something more cohesive

It seemed to be flowing fine

i actively make sure people handle what they need to deal with in real life first before doing any sort of project or thing whatsoever
dont sweat it
keep that in mind when you're doing stuff over there
if you're not having fun anymore in a place you enjoyed, you dont need to feel the need to fix it, moderator or otherwise. no one's paying you. it's not going on a resume. the people in there hardly know you. the userbase you serve will shuffle in and out and, in time, will become unfamiliar to you at every level.
and the overwhelming weight you feel with that responsibility, because of how much you invest in it, will crush you with unneccessary guilt
ive been in that spot before where ive been left to try and fix things to the best of my ability after everything and everyone's bailed and foolishly i used to think that i could fix them singlehandedly, or even believed that everything will get better if i dedicate myself completely to a place. but the reality is that if something is actively draining on you, its not going to stop draining on you even if you fix it
remember that your wellbeing is more important than loyalty to a server
sounds rough
A glacial pace
aye
No type, `only jazz`
Yes

anyway, whenever youre ready
ill probs redecorate it anyway

Trust me
i do not like basking in the idealism that online communities are bastions of good; but i do agree that this place is better than your average anime community, and id like to keep it that way
`trust me its wild`, also it should be on the top- okay
once alice is hosting we can drag you to our session but for now i reccomend playing through some bits alone to understand what the fuck this rollercoaster ride is
after that you press start game and go for it
because jazzcats cant be played as a single player thing, since it needs constant contact with the steam workshop
then set the gamemode in the bottom right corner from sandbox to jazzstronauts, and then set the single player to 2 player
you have to go into -> start new game, then find the jazz_bar map under jazzstronauts
to play jazzcats singleplayer
so like
i have an abridged version of my mods that cuts out all of the chaff but alice added all of mine so now we just add them all together and call it a day
yeah...
i did not know this
wait.

do you have the jazzstronauts mod
if you've got any mods to suggest as well feel free to hand it to us
youll need the modpack we have, actually
yeah
just be prepared for Some Bullshit
we're on- oh my god alice- new game plus but if you're not bothered by that feel free to join us

also, have something terrifying
rev up that jazzer
yes
i didnt like the cellist too much but he grew on me with his story
also incredibly dead, since you're mortal, for now
im imagining a version of it thats your tongue with a fruity drink that says PWEASE NO SIPPY
you know that yellow and black flag with the snake on it
oh
you usually dont taste alcohol in them despite them being very high in alcohol, if not higher than normal dr-
thats what fruity drinks literally are for
thats what fruity drinks are for
i worry im all of those and more.
some people are violent.
some people are sad drunks
some people are happy drunks
something like alcohol however, depends on the person
thc isnt so bad in the sense that its not a drug that will make you potentially go violent, since its effects are incredibly to deeply mollifiying depending on the dosage
to be honest, i am deathly terrified of any sort of substance use on my end, because i worry i will become a much worse person in any sort of vector
down to even the cooking bases my parents use. i dont even have rum raisin ice cream
no drugs, no drinking, no wine, not a drop of alcohol
in fact im probably the cleanest person youll find
im not into drugs
im just also very restrained, and bad with strangers
despite my reclusive and enigmatic presence, im more social than people think i am
if i could talk id do more calls
also alice's voice is lovely to listen to

dont hesitate to @ the writing group when hosting

it was probably the map that killed it
i wanted to beat up kirito and the server died.
i wouldnt grill pop any further. he's already backpedaling.

its less getting me and more im trying TO LIVE
he's jumped from government to healthcare to insurance and so on
so his perspective spans a lot of places
the teacher im taking now has done various fields
but this dude was a government agent
i had a similar teacher back when i did comptia a++ certification classes immediately after graduating high school
ranging from "i know how to retrieve people's credit card numbers by address alone" to "let me tell you all the times ive hacked places, including things on campus, for research reasons"
so now every monday and wednesday night it is basically spooky it stories from his work
the best part is my final class on mondays/wednesdays is cybersecurity and the dude teaching it is cool and ***incredibly*** seasoned with 30 years experience under his belt
yeah, its pretty much a dream come true
nobody bothers me, i get to go on silly misadventures, cool shit happens, i have no inhibitions, i can be myself
```is school everything you thought and dreamed it could be```
finally home
this wa s avery strange show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuFzJD9pyA
im gonna pull an even harder throwback
`i had a feeling you'd bring that up`
i wasnt completely into it to be a fan but when itd crop up id be like "oh hey, wacky spy hijinks time"
i liked totally spies
and by horrible i mean "there's some good jokes in the mix and generally the writers are aware that they are deeply hated and sorta roll with it but cartoon network is a fuck"
go is horrible
there's talk it might come back, and not because of those hoax rumors
also the jokers hyenas
and those two amused the SHIT out of me
and a wonder woman cat
mainly because there was a batman equivalent
also i tolerated krypto
but its in the list of shows in my memory that are like... hazy experiences of "i dont fully get whats going on but its decent filler for my other shows"
i didnt hate it
i wouldnt say i liked code lyoko
`Would you fuck a robot...?`
i used to see the dub on that kid friendly toonami knockoff
you mean that chibi gundam show?
`KANEKO DOES IT AGAIN, THE ABSOLUTE GENIUS`
foreshadows the giant fucking fist adam gets
the giant fucking fist gauntlet
i just realized
wait
_holds up MASSIVE HIBIKI FIST, ***MADE OF THE COMBINED SPIRIT OF ALL THE OTHER SYMPHOGEARS***_
"or... consider the following"
"we COULD delve into why she chose to forget about it and delve into the nature of her decision of simply engaging in raw hatred by expressing her point of view that carrying that grudge for so long has eroded all her morals to the point of no return and link that as a counterpoint against all the dad exposition we've been doing so far as a motif that your upbringing doesnt totally decide who you are morally as a person"
"hmmmm, you're right... but then its not as cool"
"but sir, logically, if the big bad realized her father never intended her to go down this route in the first place, given her blind devotion to avenging him, wouldnt that be more conducive character building than just going fuck it?"
"let's see.... big bad did the thing? check. big bad got stronger? check. did we force the big bad to realize they were wrong in some way? check."
which by that point feels less like telling a story and more finishing a check list
but at the same time the story is literally just going "yeah, whatever, we know we gotta push along the story for the Big Climax, so"
which is somewhat fitting for a villian determined to burn their own memories to accomplish this
carol's narrative just feels so short sighted because it barely delves into the nature of her dad's death, and then when that motivator is pointed out at her point blank as wrong, she just straight up says "fuck it"
_glares at the world's biggest fucking retcon_
yes... `that damage...`
had he died they would have had to literally summoned the strength to destroy the whole chateau proper, and even then, it would be unable to undo the damage much like ver managed to do manipulating it
ver activates the chateau and she literally goes "yeah, dont need you anymore"
yeah
i still herald carol as like, THE most competent symphogear villian, and had she killed Ver proper, they literally would have lost
i like and also dont like carol

i think its even still going
fairly oddparents was WAY longer than ben ten
ah, but that is what investors call `more toys`
ben is no longer ten
but alice, the arc of him growing up involved him growing up to be older than ten, its the metaphor
he literally becomes god one time and rewrites reality
a shitload
yes
where he meets himself, from the future, and also learns new forms
yeah but thats because its a hook to its sequel
oh that!
code lyoko's cg has likely not survived the tests of time. the animation was pretty okay
i think you mean kevin eleven. the ben they introduce later on is ben... 1000, i think? he's like 30ish and jury rigged his omnitrix
the original ben 10 had like. genuine depth and good writing for a younger audience. it helped that it was the same studio doing teen titans
and the reboot AFTER that i dont know
the reboot was eh
the sequel was... eh...
the original ben 10 was really good

when fucking ***sgg*** is better about things you would think youd want to review your community's quality
which is depressing, given people from valk likely wouldnt be like that
i have low expectations for people from sgg, but them being corrected and going "sorry" and making sure they do it again is not only exactly what they want, its surprisingly more than whatd id expect from them
im more aligned towards correcting them rather than jumping on a warn beforehand since it enforces the principle more cleanly, while coming down harder when they do it again afterwards

slowly building influence as other personas to bring disarray, doubt, and chaos in places
the kind of people who ban evade who are the most dangerous are the kind of people who can not only keep up the facade convincingly, but also use it to climb to positions of power within a community
back on the minecraft forums there was a dude who was really incredibly not liked. ive long since forgotten his name, but he was a very abrasive person. very much a "many little warns stacking up to being a major nuisance overall" kind of guy. eventually gets a ban. we find out around a month later that he had actually ban evaded, and assumed a new alias and was following the rules perfectly. he told us he really just wanted a new lease on things. we let him. never was a problem again.
here's another example
and the people who are good at that facade, are ironically following the rules
dunno if he kept going. i left after a while because i got bored. point is, he had to clam up because he realized that he could not continue a facade for so long until his true nature came out.
went largely ignored.
it got to the extent where he essentially became a lurker and hardly spoke. he had a small cult following, so he'd get some of his friends (who understood he was an asshole but still liked him anyway because thats just the kind of bad decisions you'd expect from people in a ddlc chat) to advertise his fics for him
alt gets banned. he gets another. he tries harder. alt gets banned. he gets another. he tries harder. alt gets banned. he gets another. he tries harder. alt gets banned. etc etc etc.
and they would compare it and go "oh shit, you're right"
and i would log them, pat the mods, and go "hey, this dude has the same behavior as the dude you banned before"
and he'd do the same complaints
but eventually he'd just slip back into being an asshole
so any time he would pop up, he would try to pretend to be someone else at first and actively try to mask who he was
unfortunately for him, he is mortal
he even demonstrated this when he was banned by having the server flooded with 40 alts of his in just a few seconds
anyway, this particular asshole was also very competent as scripting and was an IT major by trade, and he had actually developed scripting tools that automated alt creation
he was a writer, and really liked to shit on people for their writing, which i chewed them out for a lot because as you know me, i am the kind of person who is very much encouraging of people to write things while giving them constructive advice
i think i talked about this example before, but back when i used to be on the doki doki literature club server, there was someone who was a huge asshole
as long as they break character it doesnt matter
but even then
yep
the ones that dont understand this are the ones that are easiest to deal with, because they break character the easiest
also, to scrmz; alt creation is by its nature a losing game. the people who keep creating alts by their nature need to conform more and more to the rules in order to blend in. by the time they manage to successfully do so, theyre already correctly following the guidelines, whether they truly intend to or not
i have no idea how big it is now. probably even double unless irc use has dwindled
for reference, back on my time on esper, the second biggest channel was like... 300ish? around there? and #minecraft was at 800 and ***still growing***, and im pretty sure its probably either still in those numbers or bigger
#minecraft only existed on esper because Notch first introduced minecraft on tigsource and then grew out from that community; #tigsource itself is also on esper
#minecraft is a fluke though, and there was actually a time where the sysops wanted to get rid of the channel because the server itself was not designed to handle that kind of traffic at the time
i ran into it on the daily as an old OP on #minecraft
this is true, but back during my time on espernet, banlists were incredibly limited to such an extent that we had to ***unban people*** just to ban more people
```love how IRC is superior to discord in that you can IP ban```
I'll be on campus
What's that in est terms

school is slowly kicking in
i am home
STEFAN KARL FUCKING DIED
with teachers whose curriculum boil down to "you can literally learn this online on your own but the only reason you're here is for a piece of paper"
i literally cannot afford it and neither can my parents. ive done things fairly and attempted to, and ended up repeating courses, which is repeating bills, which is stacking costs
and i mean that literally
yeah, i do, cause i cant afford failure period
it helped that you could do the exam infinitely many times
so i cheated it to the core compulsively. pulled out every cheating resource, and moved on
you needed a 70 or more on the certification exam in order to pass the class regardless of whatever you had
last semester like i said, i had a class where the professor literally did not exist. it was an online class. no one could reach him. emails, messages online, the works. zero. he gave us work involving an automation product called kaseya that worked towards a certification for it. it was bad. none of the work he gave trained us towards it, and the kaseya teaching instructions were on a bad flash site thing that was unstable and sorta broken.
dropped it. it was a wise choice; more than 90% of them failed.
immediately realized what this issue would bring and how this kind of grading would immediately point to failing the class
there were apparently many mistakes and i was working on the second assignment so i could, well, have it done
second assignment rolls around. each assignment builds on every other assignment, so i really wanted my feedback on how i installed the linux distro. feedback gets to me ***on the day the second assignment is due***. second assignment hinges on the first assignment having been done flawlessly
i think what best presents this issue was a unix class i had to drop. teacher was really nice but it was built to be a difficult class. i dont mind, i can handle difficult classes when it comes to computing. professor does long schpiel about us having the space necessary in our lives to make mistakes. makes sense, this is a learning environment. first assignment comes around; its installing a very specific linux distro on a virtualized environment access through a terminal program using a campus specific thing. easy enough. i do it. it seems to work. but i have to wait for the professor's input to come in, and he takes a while grading them.
thats because you are a very talented person. i dont devalue my skills, but sometimes i just cant do a thing and im stuck in a position where just turning in what i have and asking at the end of the day wont get me the grade i need to move on
total ghost
last semester i had an online class with a professor who essentially didnt exist
usually the better a professor is the less i cheat
i do what it takes to graduate, especially when some (not all) professors around here are bullshit
hehe
given that i am a cheaty mc cheaterson
its just really funny for me to basically be at the forefront of `a potential den of scum and villiany...`
yep, if you're hosting or have mod priviledges
and then delete anything that could be construed as cheating
if i do one ill probably literally outright say "if you're gonna cheat take it to dms not here"
literally every single whatsapp group ive been in has devolved into a treacherous den of nebulous actions that some people could call cheating
```personally I dont think a whatsapp group without a professor is an issue, ive had one for the past 6 years, and ive never seen anyone try to use it to cheat, but I dunno if that will be different for you```
god i missed college
thus preparing myself to the potential of becoming a cheating lynchpin for a semester
man in eric andre avatar messages me on my campus's website for a specific class. i am nearly thrown into a stroke because my puny brain nearly interprets this as real life honest to god eric andre. i tell him this, amused. he tells me that someone should make a whatsapp for the class without messaging the professor. i tell him that its likely the professor will be in there regardless of whatever i do because he can see these messages regardless if he so chose, but i also decide if that no one else does it, ill make and orchestrate the group
Aight
Check if there's any weird permissions set for introductions
does the invite point to a specific channel
alice quick question
_pats big story book_
ive got a bunch of other stories like this and more.
then i left and it all went to shit again.
all in all it was probably the biggest high point that community ever had.
the icing on the cake was that there was infighting amongst them because some felt he had become too cult like, and left him
server founder took credit for everything, which conveniently deflected them from doing anything to me even though they tried to call me out initially. their efforts in doing so were fruitless, because the rest of the community who had enough of them pretty much drowned them out. thats the problem with insular groups. theyre blind to everything outside of them.
morale went up, people were happy, assholes were gone.
his group of friends did not like it and he instructed them to attack the server as hard as possible, which i anticipated. the server already had tools to revert everything, so it was not only fruitless, but also gave us the perfect excuse to get rid of them all.
the founder did not like him much, not because he didn't want to listen to him, but because he wanted to seize back more control to his community. i then employed the same strategies said asshole did, talked the founder's ear off, and successfully convinced him to ban him.
he got the boot because during a time where he and his friends gave death threats to a community member, and we banned one of his friends, he pm'd me to talk about why he was banned. i saw this as an opportunity to get rid of him, and then told him that it was not something he had to know. he got angry and insulted me, and i baited him further. his ego made him insult me further, and i took screenies and shared it with staff, who were already feeling the pressure at the time due to the whole affair.
the person in question who masterminded this managed to unite a lot of people who were very much 4channy trolls together in coordinated efforts to harass and belittle people, and got away with it because people wouldnt report it, and what little we got was not big in terms of infractions. he would also purposefully talk to the founder and give him extremely bad ideas on moderation organization and how mods should voice input purposefully so that they could be as slow and inefficient as possible
back in a starbound roleplay community, we actually had someone who joined the moderation team on purpose to leak information out to someone who was actively trying to sabotage the community for their own amusement, and they did so successfully for several months until we found out and demoted them after a very big thing
yes
but i have experienced similar, though
id lose my mind
***NANI?!***
these are very rare. absolute psychopaths, though. they play very long games. we're talking ***year long*** games.
`i wanna-` wait no i probs wont have time
_eyes immediately dart to tabletop sim_
I FLIP IT OVER. I FLAP THE CARDS. I FLIP IT AGAIN. I FLAP THE PAPER.
YES
yes
_flips table over, flipping your hearthstone cards, and then flips it over again, showing a blank paper to write on_
i should work on an old fic idea i had in my free time on campus
i am home
and i have class in 20 minutes
because you are not understanding my point.
so im going to end this conversation here and take deep breaths
your moral myopia is genuinely upsetting me over something that i have had intense feelings of suicide over
saki
i literally cannot describe to you the raw terror i felt last semester taking trig again for the third time. the absolute fear knowing that it wasnt just trig, but a class more ADVANCED than before, because it was all that i had left, and that failing it meant that my education here would be prolonged by not only a year, but i would have to tell my parents AGAIN that everything would be delayed. and that theyd have to pay EVEN MORE when NEITHER OF THEM are working. that i would have failed AGAIN, for the THIRD TIME.
i ***cannot*** fail.
i /will/ do it.
if i have to cheat, because i cant focus at home because of the endless fighting of my parents, or try to stay on campus only to get harassed by them to come home or get dragged home if they figure out anything
i will do it.
if i have to cheat, to get all of this off my back and more
i should have graduated a year ago. breaking the news to them was extremely painful, and reminded me that ill be subject to even more of their fighting for yet another year.
im also working on the framework that my parents hinge on me getting my college degree to secure their divorce. because they want to feel satisfied about themselves knowing i have some sort of job security when they settle their divorce.
the only exception to this is good networking, which i dont have, because my friends are few and my ability to be literally outside my house are fewer outside of going to college again
im working in the framework that for someone in my position, a college education is the difference between having a job for half a year as opposed to a year or longer when you have zero entry level experience. my parents are horrible traditionalists who have never wanted me to have a job despite 1. helping me work towards cultivating experience, and 2. building towards a firm resume, because theyre dumb and dont understand my currently reality within this generation
i am absolutely not bothered with the morals of cheating because it is no longer within the frame of getting an education. it is in the frame of survival
i have no financial safety net for failure. my parents are saddled with sky-high credit card debt following a long, long string of bad decisions. my only saving grace was a college fund they poorly interpreted, which left us paying a lot more out of pocket sooner than anticipated.
and if the professors i deal with, that i explicitly pay for, give me a lackluster education and screw me out of learning things properly, then i in turn reserve the right to equally screw them. because reporting them does not work most of the time unless its for more serious accusations. because sometimes some professors are there because they fufill a specific role no one can, and basically get away with anything.
me not being cut out of academia does not exclude me from being forced into it
academia's an industry focused on maximizing profits on the backs of people who require documentation to prove their skills as opposed to genuinely learning them on their own

so there's a fun fact about me.
being shrouded in a sheath of humiliation and despair
but the raw emotional pain is like
physically i feel fine after doing that and these days i rebound easily from it
emotionally
and i feel really, really bad
that just happened now
im prone to slow growing stomach pains that can evolve into intense, gut wrenching pain that can evolve further into the literal sensation of knives slammed into my gut and then become something so unimaginable that my body rejects it, and forces me to literally strip down naked in front of a toilet and vomit my guts out for 15 minutes to half an hour nonstop
here's a fun fact about me
i forgot that college fun comes with college drama
mmmm
how could you make such a horrifying, painful sentence

life is good.
- had random oreos for free
- saw an old friend show up to my class
- got in a random pool match with someone because they wanted to pay me back for something
meanwhile, in college, i:
my laptop uses it because the wifi card in it is dead
my pc uses it because my parents refuse to drill holes to get cables lined through for mine
theyre cheap and last a long while for a temporary solution
you can also get a usb wi-fi adapter

i will say though
some memes thoroughly make fun of him and some memes glorify him and the line between those two gets blurrier every day, but i firmly believe that it was also the railroad heading straight to his downfall
respects and defends him
he is one of the major news fronts that feeds into /pol/'s delusion, and vice versa
he's a snake oil salesman, and his snake oil is literal alongside political
Hes a horrible ultra right wing louse that was memeified because of the intensity of his raves
I hope that's the final nail in his coffin

I know
IT'S THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT, BLIZZARD
do as you like
but its your server
that is an incredibly sketchy description of doing something that is an incredibly monumental task, and it does not instill any sort of confidence in me whatsoever
but i feel for the record that none of us have experience in doing this kind of thing except you, and while i dont underestimate your desire to carry all that, i also have to point out it may not be compatible in terms of legacy if and when any changes happen in the future
this is good
do you agree with what im saying at least or do you have anything to say against it
and while i really try my best, well, you've seen first hand that i am not the best at it
that part was important because most of these people were strangers and it is literally only me running the show
if someone says a slur, and mods bring it up and they go "well, its not a slur to me", if the mods go "this could hurt someone", the user cannot refute it. it says in the rules. if it can hurt someone, dont say it.
notice how the wording tries to be consistently telling people what to do, as opposed to not; there's less question as a result on what you should be doing
```1. Keep it cool.
* Avoid hostility and spam. If you have an issue with someone, bring it up with staff.
* Be civil and respect each other.
* Offer a helping hand, if you're able to.
2. Keep it clean.
* No slurs. Think before you say things. Reflect if it could hurt someone; if it can, don't say it.
* Post only sfw material in public spaces. There are minors here. Please respect their presence.
* Respect people's pronouns. The effort you put in is paid back in kind with equal respect.
3. Keep it legal.
* If you are an adult speaking to a minor, understand it as such, and act like one. Anything less will not be tolerated.
* If you are posting nsfw materials in nsfw, remember that people are receptive to certain things, and respect that. If it offends them, take it down.
* Remember that the limit for nsfw materials is the limit of the federal law. Anime/manga depictions of illegal acts are not acceptable here.
4. Keep it together.
* If you're having issues in life, this is a community that has your back. If your issues are beyond our depth, accept our limits and find real help.
* Take a step back if you're losing your temper or patience. You may regret it otherwise.
* Communication is what fosters understanding. Never hesitate to talk things out as a first resort.
5. Keep it fun.
* Positivity is not a constant, but is an integral part of the human experience. Contribute to it to everyone else where you go.
* Talk and socialize to your hearts content. That's how friendships are forged.
* Most importantly, have fun!```
it was a bit rushed since it was completely sudden and dropped onto my fucking hands, but it works decently for what it is
here's an example of what i mean. a long while back, for an fate grand order server that i ended up being forced to host for `reasons`, i made up a ruleset to help handle things
its more limiting telling people what to do, than what not to do, as telling people what not to do is more open ended in terms of interpretation
thats not a bad start. though usually with rules, you want to keep them in terms of telling people what to do, as opposed to telling people what not to do
"are you a dick for being happy that john mccain is dead? or are you a dick for celebrating a problematic legacy?"
i really do need to sit down and do a rewrite of the rules or at least pitch something, because while that rule is okay, in this context its very much
i am not the best authority in this position, because it is a problem unique to our own moderating style here in this community; usually in these situations moderators would typically abstain from opinion to begin with, and rely more on the rules than partaking in the discussion
when i already said "yeah it likely wont happen" in agreement, and just noted it because my brain is so hardwired with this kind of stuff that its sensitive to the potential of people trying to do subtle bad things
otherwise it will just suck me up into a loop of me refuting you with my own experiences and then me getting even more paranoid to the point where i go "shit, well, maybe i /am/ right"
dont need to follow up me saying things with ideas on how something is not the case when i said im just being paranoid on my end
there are other ways to- look, i already said it was just me being paranoid, alright
ive met stupider people who have been much bigger nuisances by virtue of tenacity, but i doubt he has the drive or motivation for it
its just me being paranoid, is all
anyway
never underestimate how close bedfellows stupidity and malice are. especially when the precise wording was "that he liked trolling servers for fun with his friends in his own server dedicated to it"
who knows.
he is definitely not THAT dumb. or maybe he is
you were staff when he was given the boot
it is just me getting my `old staff reactions` upon hearing familiar behaviors
i dont expect any complicated attack vector coming from vali, if such a possibility were to exist
my brain is just giving alert signals since usually people who are banned that try to keep tabs on server things outside of where they are, are the type of people to initiate attacks
alright
vali is contacting staff members outside of this server?
wait
`WRONG CHANNEL!`
ill hope for the best
i smell a catch coming up soon.
in fact it sounds too good
it sounds really good
told ya here so ya dont lose face
its chill, dont sweat it

<@290431224596660224> please delete that image

otherwise we have stagnant messages in <#448237561085952001> that need to be deleted manually
<@!102691114762371072> note for the future; we should probs have kirichan autodelete and point out when someone has inputted a command incorrectly
it wont be
this is sorta why, and this behavior is pretty much clockwork
remember how i said "hey, it seems strange he's reaching out to mods" and why my brain set off alarm bells
i guess that is more comforting... sorta.
alright then...
i see
that there are people in my past i may have ruined because i tried my best knowing nothing, because i had no one around to help me otherwise up until this moment.
ive been in positions before long ago in the past where i had to stop people from committing suicide. where ive had to talk people out of it. how i treated wfc is usually not the norm, but it was not compliant completely of what you showed me previously either. so now in contemplation i have the thought that i may have botched that too.
it is just a bitter pill to swallow
i know
okay
i dont have potential.
okay
and im me
alright
what do we do when you're not around, and we have no one to find that can help
Out of niceness, I pointed them here
It seemed they were lonely, since they brought up being kicked out of an rp community
They messaged me today, which was surprising given the last time we spoke was jan
This was a stranger whose rp I liked seeing but didn't want to rp much with after seeing how closed they are medium wise
*leans over*
i will do it anyway and I will dig up the craziest maps possible
and also its a labor day weekend
my biggest assignment is due on thursday, and of the other two, one is basically automated (teammates are basically doing it) and the other is just a quiz and a simple current event
do you want to do some jazzcats during the weekend to help your mood
<@127644949884698624> how are you faring
made a new friend also
shes okay
today i went to a seedy pool bar to chaperone my best friend in order to ward away a potential sex offender
Okay
You told me once you get into really sour moods when you're hungry
Were you hungry
It sucks
I ask because you talked before about doing higher doses and while I know it is important, I worry it could be signs of substance abuse
I see
Did this come immediately after your thc high
I would do more if I wasn't in class right now
<@127644949884698624> how are you faring
yeah
okay
we're here for you

yeah shit this survey is the real deal
http://furscience.com/
also, today i learned there's a website dedicated to documenting the furry phd community
theyre all the real deal, too
fascinating
ive done this moderating gig for years. ive seen so many things. but if you told me "furries with actual phd's going around knocking on subreddits to get data from anime fans across several subreddits" a few years back, i would not have believed it

latooni you madman
after my sweet karaoke session i ended up in a car ride around campus talking life advice to a friend dealing with fuckboys
You can rest easy with that at least
Things are under control while you are away dealing with this pain so you thankfully don't have to worry about it
That is an improvement
But also yes how are you faring alice
And he dropped it immediately
It was resolved quietly since it's not a real warnable thing up until I go "this is warnable if you keep going"
I stepped in and ripped the dictionary from his hands
passed down person to person to person
like a collab fic of sorts
i want to do an image worm, but instead of images its a fic
a writing idea.
my brain has hatched an idea
sorry for having to put you aside on this one, but you were veering closely into the dumb things i do
back out of this one, latooni
i reccomend taking advantage of this as a teaching opportunity
not exactly
<@&336301457185832961> and <@&336301943179968514> if im not here to post ibu's link, please do it for them
no idea
alice, i am seriously worried for you, mainly because you... havent really told us much of what is going on, and you coming out of the blue to suddenly say you need to hand off the server concerns me deeply
okay
go eat
i will take ownership temporarily if necessary until a proper owner can be decided upon
what is going on

I'm not at my comp yet since I just woke up
Latooni, feel free to use the file hosting service I use to host it
YES ITS BEEN UPGRADED
so you see posters that literally say "SOCIALISM SUCKS" and "BIG GOVERNMENT SUCKS" and aims to peddle itself as anti-establishment while completely unaware it is for the establishment and whittling down and removing as many government regulations as possible
there's posters in my campus put up by the local republicans that basically tries to peddle strong conservative values while dressing it up with artificial kid punk aesthetic
ive seen worse

`These are 80s furries.`
these arent just any ordinary furries.
then again... i looked them all up and all of them seem roughly in their fifties
bugging subreddits is all well and good but theyd make a lot more headway poking larger discords with active participation in it
what bothers me is that these nerds arent more hip to whats in right now with technology in terms of social groups given they study this for a living
`because free monies`
i mostly went through this just to see if i get that amazon card
then i misread it
the wording on that confused me because i couldnt tell if it was asking me if I feel the anime community /should/ welcome lgbt members or whether or not it does already
*looks at watch*
Anyway
I hope my words keep haunting them thoroughly amidst every failure they experience
So no one will likely do it to begin with
Plus they've never cared about increasing and supporting their writers for eons
*pats latooni proudly*
Because they do not have a Latooni who is good at throwing new ideas in
The funny part is they're going to hit the same walls I did since these are identical limitations (500 words is roughly a little less than 2 pages) and they won't know what to do about it
This is now the perfect opportunity to make them dance
This only concedes defeat to their lack of originality
Amusing
Shameless copying of our ideas, hm?
I don't expect problems from him because his own anxiety keeps him in check, so it's wise not to touch this one
It's why he has friction with valk; the irreconcilable nature of imitating assholes, only to be treated as one would to an asshole, is something that severely wounds him
Lectric is a caged, anxious parrot; repeating things not because they should be fundamental core values to their morals, but to follow whatever is cool

DO IT
Something...
Something
it has been a while since A Thing was done
i might do an event next weekend
it can seem insignificant at times, because there's more activity here than in the subreddit, but whenever people need a handy resource and things get pushed up and/or unpinned because of pinning space to remember topics, that thread is the best
aight
i understand your hesitation, but this is good practice
so you can make it, bug me, and i will slap that shit on the fridge with a magnet
i have the ability to pin/unpin reddit threads
<@99695384296701952> this would also be a good time to get you comfortable in writing the reddit topic for prompt announcements, since it needs to be updated
now go announce that shit
`i am proud of you`
hooray, you did it
make sure the pdfs have the name of the person who wrote it; doesnt need the titles, just their names
since you have multiple topics, dont bother specifying it (since the title will be massive)
here's an example
https://www.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/973bcv/all_stories_submitted_for_topic_4_a_characters/
id rather you post to get experience in making the thread (it's literally just a title and its hyperlink) so you can feel comfortable making them in the future unless your pc is too wonked out to do it

actually...
oh
i mean i might give https://skribbl.io/ a try because it actually seems really good but it bothers me that i cant customize the words
but its too wild to do.
i have an even more insane idea
pictionary does not seem to be panning out

in my journey to find symphogear based pictionary, i have aided an ai in recognizing pictures
the answer lies on finding something custom for symphogear words
so, clearly, its destiny to do this
aside: i randomly joined a pictionary game, and my very first word was cape
but, im trying to find something that has custom word lists
but symphogear themed
is pictionary
one of my event ideas
so
Cute
Aight we gotta seriously do bot descriptions
AND THEN WE GET MASSIVE ENCODED TITLES THAT BREAK VIDEOS
RIGHT <@99695384296701952>
But also I fear by breaching this territory we summon the eoten debacle all over again
Despite it being factually wrong
So my brain would never be able to process higurashi when they cry as "when the cicadas cry"
But I've always felt anime titles are their own separate beast in which the mingling of words between cultures makes weirdly iconic titles
True
My soul was ascending
Someone brought up higurashi when they cry and they just called it 'when they cry'

note that this is for the chrome extension, not for the actual site itself, but i feel its pertinent given that lots of folks upload stuff to mega for symphogear music any which way
aight
do i have the greenlight
im going to post an announcement to https://www.zdnet.com/article/mega-nz-chrome-extension-caught-stealing-passwords-cryptocurrency-private-keys/ since it seems important due to folks here relying on mega to get their symphogear stuff
That and the ipad tracker in case you lose it
It seems mostly untouched aside from the forced IOS version for the sake of assignments
The iPad mini I've been loaned has airdrop functions and I am actively combating the mischief maker within me to airdrop things to people
If they're still there it means they haven't done it yet
That's where the anniversary folks are
Check on the side bar if there's still helper people, ie people separated that aren't staff or subbers
When they finish it I'm gonna finish the SYMPHOGEAR cards against humanity set on the other site
It's important
Peep for me as well scrmz
I need you to peep on occasion and tell me when their anniversary party is over
<@127644949884698624> I know you're feeling bad and I don't want to ask for anything but there is something small I'd like you to do
i cannot leave this house unsupervised, and there is no one here willing to take me anywhere
i hate everything.

just got repeatedly punched and slapped in the head while having shit thrown at me hard and having all of my computer cables ripped off
ironically, its also the reason why they end up neglected in valk; no one else wants to talk to them either and as a result they end up talking to thin air
jacque can be annoying, its why i dont speak to them much
i sense your frustration

And then it will break down and be ruined
When they devolve into porn, inevitably, they'll only just focus on the porn with everything else thrown out the window
Anyway
Other community shits on her for not sticking to feminine norms
She's a member here, a prolific artist
DLAnon
Anyway, I suspect given the enthusiasm of "anything goes" coupled with Quinn's involvement, it's going to devolve into porn very quickly
Which they remodded once the subreddit officially cut ties
Yes
And, if they were smart, they'd exploit that against us, given that I purposefully barred porn entries
It sure is
Can't wait for all the porn they'll dump into those prompts

As usual I'll be on campus unless it's on a weekend
Aight
I'm not fond of them because of that and also my dad is just really into guns and keeps rifles like a hoarder
Damn
*gunpoint
Then my dad held me at gunpoint after holding my mom at gunpoimt
I was neutral on guns
It's similar for me
I don't like guns
its why i wanted the headpat to be updated to the current blond, since valk uses the older elfnein form for their elfnein bot
her eyes look even better with carols hair, honestly
headpat
it is best to block and move on
just talking to him opens risk of him trying to plea more emotionally to come back
yeah seriously just block him
it is a painful reminder that no matter how nice things are, as long as i am here, they will never go away, and that if i am to truly get rid of them, i must dissappear and not look back
but its not fun to hear.
he's said it periodically over the years
its not the first time he's done it

is it alright if i slap it on the announcement channel
if there's anything i associate with hibki the most, its that
i ask because i want to include it with the announcements for hibki's birthday
can anyone find me the scene in season one where hibiki yells ***SYYYYYYYMPHOOOOOOOOOOOGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR*** when she goes all out against fine
how far can the timer go
how do i use kirichan's timer function
are the subs in the video or is it cc'd
that way if it mysteriously dissappears you can still host it on a google drive and it can be streamed on a cytube
https://en.savefrom.net/1-how-to-download-youtube-video/
you should extract it
the funny part is i think they borrowed the 'custom role, no questions asked' idea from the idea i gave them of the winner pitching an emoji to add into the server, no questions asked
because there will be people gunning for that custom role
its not going to be quiet
this is going to explode in their faces so hard
theyre going to do them all at once simultaneously so that they can wrap it up in 6 hours to do the symphogear live watch

yes
i will never cease to be impressed how they continue to sabotage themselves more effectively than i ever could
_grins wickedly_
AND THEYRE GONNA TRY AND KEEP TRACK OF ALL THREE EVENTS AT THE SAME TIME WHILE TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF PEOPLE WHO ATTEND AND GIVING TICKETS TO PEOPLE WHO DO, ***AT THE SAME TIME***
***at the same time***
theyre gonna do all three events...
those idiots
those
oh my god
_pauses, re-reads_
wait
theyre also doing it all in one day, which amuses me, since this was supposed to be a week long event
it seems they sectioned off events with that being the end instead of just shooting them along every day
interesting to note the sympholive watchalong
cards against humanity, `the event i was going to host`, alongside something else i dont recall, since it was planned to be 5 events instead of just 3
its a team, you're not alone here
or, ask another staff member to help you
take your time

theyve even also mysteriously gutted some of their idea concepts
theyve also mysteriously gutted some of their rewards
theyve also mysteriously gutted a lot of their events
theyre late
yes
even better
oh
they are stuck wrestling with a moron that voluntarily left our server by choice.
almost a year ago, actually
the AnonAnon account he's using... is the same one he used when he personally departed the server eons ago
do you know the punchline to all this
just them going on about ack
no

I've combed everywhere and see nothing
I'm scrolling but... I don't see anything...
Why did hazel leave
`I need that .ass...`
_chews cigar aggressively_
is it alright if you dm me the credentials
makes me satisfied that we get the symphogear name on it
Slide it to people in pms to those who use it
But don't have the info public here
Feel free to do that

`What a shame that they couldn't use Cards Against Humanity due to whoever was transferring it to the new site leaving it incomplete...`
dess_remind me 11d finish symphocards against humanity in the new site after valk has finished their trash fest
ahhh, okay
dess_remind me
.dess_remind me
does it do days
It looks like hazel left everywhere
i have some ideas.
i will be doing some cytube experiments when i can
its the weekday, its to be expected; its not a bad turnout testing out with cytube
i got a lemon lime mountain dew because i wanted something to drink, and its so filled with sugar that this milk im having hours later feels ***bitter*** in comparison
also, mountain dew genuinely is a horrible, godless drink
but i feel like a responsible adult
i am exhausted
i am just pointing this detail out because while some users can be dumb, i want to try and avoid fostering angry or bitter feelings towards users
that is true
aight
it sounds like while their discomfort about it is a personal issue, it seems to stem more from their own personal issues with their gender and sexuality, instead of the usual buttmad nerds who just want more tiddy

...did it generate
wait, did my batman dick post generate discourse

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO***BO***
i have renamed myself in shame
`I am a fool.`
`. . .`
...
also, arent we talking about how what nexon is claiming about it using its designer stuff as a platform and having permanent cosmetic items being a lie
before i foolishly reinvest in maple story 2
BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW HOW NEXON IS CHEATING ME WITH ITS LIES
but... but i liked building in maple... so i cant help but be enticed by this
it would be but now im genuinely curious why so i can keep it in mind for future hype curbing
`tell us the knowledge on why this is false`
tell us your secrets lyssa
burger time has never been the same
which means it can be resized into a discord nitro emoji
the beauty is that its transparent
is there something wrong with seeing carl and shaggy do the macarena
i will trust that judgement then because it looks like a big tangled knot of fuck and i am not the best with big tangled knots of fucks
i see
i am sorta standing here in the corner going "this is going on"
as for the hazel thing i dont really know what to say because i have been briefed on 0 context
it can feel that way because we are constantly experimenting new things and throwing things off the wall, but we are most certaintly not the most active users here in general compared to everyone else, and also the things we do are for the users, ultimately
this is not true
```Sometimes I get the feeling that this server has pretty much just become a playground for mods.```
literally nothing happens and yet it is so terrifying
its recurring name is pinko, or pinko-chan
and im trying to figure out where the fuck this thing comes from
its genuinely unsettling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OdOG9Caxgc
there's no jumpscare but like
i stumbled into a youtube channel centering around a character who is a floating head with a visible and fully functioning connected lung system
the focus is this
yes, but thats not the focus here
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEgQVdEw763kPWcfISpSKuw/videos
i was trying to look up some old vocaloid spooky music since a friend of mine redipped into vocaloid. but, during this, i stumbled upon... something
this has 0 relation with anything of any sort of moderation, but i trust you all, so i need your brains for this mystery
alright gang
and yet, they have a girls last tour avatar
impressive that they found jesus in a convention, of all things
im hungry. i ate. i still hunger...

aight
i have a feeling you dealt with the departure thing, and i forget what the second thing was
if you just have 3 days to work on bot stuff my advice is to shove aside the much bigger projects for smaller, immediate fixes
do lab with worksheet...
fuck law
with worksheet
next time... do lab
im so tired...
fucking...
fuck
none of it is congruent with what i did
its
it
AND THE worksheeet
FOR A LAB
FO
ALLLL THAT WORK
IMMM BOBO THE CLWN
that too would be appreciate scrmz
get mariabot in here
maybe trying to get reddit rss working, i need to talk to That Guy to see how he did it in the touhou server
making sure the names are no longer long funny strings
i feel like we should push back the currency idea in favor of smaller, more important goals
`All this time...`
_looks at the server's bots..._
yes.
***IT WAS JUST LATOONI AND KRIISA ALL ALONG***
_unmasks it, gasps_
_eyes that xdu plot of kirika and shirabe splitting their apartment in half with tape_
i will keep biting my tongue on this and keep wishing the best because i like seeing happy relationships
```I hope the fact that we broke up previously, not smoothly, and nothing about server moderation or relationships was noticeably impacted is testament that we can be mature and trusted in this```

aight saki
its open on github

WAIT
may be a bit more complicated.
https://jamessliu.com/Hourai/
this...
ah
thats why im going to figure out which one it is so i can tear it apart
i know
it seems the bot capable of this is one of the mainstream bots
also, got word back from the subreddit dude
yeah itd be a bit much
thats... moderately terrifying
this thing can talk on reddit, too
this
oh
full documentation here
https://pyborg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
ooooh, this one has some stuff set up for discord, sorta
...a more modern iteration of pyborg that doesnt run really old python
_eyes picture_
here's a more modern iteration of py-
<@!102691114762371072> https://github.com/jrabbit/pyborg-1up
okay
let me look up...
the subreddit rss thing will have to wait until i get a response but aside from that, that clears the slate on the boring important stuff
that seems to pretty much be it
aight
do kirichan and/or shirabe have spam countermeasures
im looking back at pinned stuff to see if there's anything else left to knock out
poor phrasing on my part
_keeps thinking..._
oh well.
tch
still, i feel that prompt needs changing. at least to be changed to say "This bot runs on Nadeko, and the prefix for commands is changed to dess"
now im curious...
with the dess_help command in a pm
and... that feels weirdly worrying
its advertising itself to join other servers

really curious because, well
also... as a reminder. your bot is hosted by you, yeah?
the nadekobot command list doesnt use dess
yes, but we have a bunch of custom comm- yeah
dess_help
hell, i dont even know the full list of commands
right now, the commands are mostly a mystery except for active users who see us do them, alongside, well, us
we need to compile the list of commands each bot is capable of doing so that one of them can pm them to users when needed. ideally, the best one to do this with would actually be mariabot, since i had also suggested mariabot also have the ability to announce if and when either bot goes offline
my brain has remembered something very important
no
oh, wait
what else...
currency will take a long while. it would be unwise to focus on it. i am also hesitant to get you to work on improving shirabe's talking functions since it can take a long while, though i can probably find another markov chain library to aid you if you really want to go for it
i am thinking...
all that is left is to wait.
i have messaged the person whose brain i want to pry on how they managed to get rss working on a bot for their subreddit
yay
i will message the person in the touhou discord who managed to get the solution to that right now and relay it your way
the other thing in the list that seems preferable to prioritizing is, and it will be annoying: resolving the subreddit rss feed
i will post a thread
YAY
hella dess
its simple, dess
dess
damnit.
i cant bedesslieve it
`james...`
ooooh good, thats important, yeah
a 15-30 minute difference
honestly a minute or two is fine, the old subreddit postings had like
nice
which isnt bad but, damn
thats actually even better than the touhou's discord bot, theyve got like a minute difference
amazing
hows the reddit post to discord post time difference looking
hella
yaaaay
i see...
also yeah the jokes are garbage

What is it

i was going to be true to my word and keep discussing this because i said i would but i am coming down with a fever and the sniffles so instead have a puppy
And it was disarmimg him in terms of his actions, not treating him as a threat
I've got class now and later I gotta help a friend who's been sick so I'll talk about this later
Either they follow the rules or do not, and if they do not, we find out why and either offer a helping hand or give them the boot
I don't want to approach people with the mentality that they're bombs
I don't want staff projecting real problems with users against users who are just being dumb
Because the behavior seemed to be brought up as evidence to deal with a user instead of just normal venting, and it was being presented after being admitted that kriisa was admitting electric was hitting the notes of a user who shows much greater concern, and being presented after asking evidence about said problematic behavior (bread)
im aware
yep
that is a problem
lectriclord was already disarmed the moment i just pointed out people liked the art while kriisa was responding condescendingly in image macros
that road only leads to bad things
presenting things in the same vein as a user actively admitting to stirring shit up for fun and potentially projecting issues of one user to another user is something i want to make sure is nipped in the bud as much as possible
so, no, that excuse is not valid
except it was presented in the same chain of me asking them for evidence on bread
which is not a good way to approach things
the latter already insinuates guilt
there's a difference between venting, which is fine, and taking up arms against a user. bread has publicly admitted to doing things to fuck with people; this is a valid reason to get screenshots against them and keep them for another issue to deal with. lectric, however, has not, and while you're fine to vent about this touches a sore spot, there's also a line between going "this user rubs me the wrong way" and "i am handing you screenshots that may be potentially be breaking the rules for future things"
and that is bad
no, you're not, but you're already handing me screenshots over something that was casually resolved, that has no real incriminating evidence outside of "i dont know why people like this thing"
you also just literally admitted that lectric was touching a sore spot you already had with a previous user, and i worry that may be projecting issues with one user onto another unfairly
you have 0 evidence to substantiate this. additionally, we dont force thinking by citing rules we cannot claim theyve broken, but rather by talking and challenging them. note how i pointed out that people just liked the art and did not make it that big of a deal as they were makiing it, and lectric shut up immediately
i will save that one, though i note that lectric was not doing this for the sake of stirring things up, nor is not admitting at any moment that they are doing this purposefully to be hostile for the sake of causing problems
bookmarked as well
i dont know how used to directly dealing with people you are in bigger communities; know that if you feel any sort of hesitation, we're also all here to back you up and also reel you back depending on what goes on, so you're not alone in this
the next time it happens, that will be your go-to log to deal with it
bookmarked
remember, we're staff. problems exist only if we allow them to exist. and you're a custodian; you have not only to enforce these things, but also to do them freely without hesitation if you feel the rules are being broken
the next time something similar happens, we confront it
take screenshots for me, and log them
since i know you spoke to him in a call
er, verbal conversation
did bread admit this in logs or in conversation
please dont do that
kriisa, saying not to engage when also saying "this is bait" in the same chat is still also engaging
okay doke.
?
that means we dont have to hide the subreddit channel feed anymore
it works
YAY
havent focused too much time on thinking about gameplay
and its super depressing.
mainly because i spoiled myself on the manga's end
girls last tour always makes me sad to think about
*studying
i should be studyin for an exam and prepare to tutor someone for the same exam
alright
which means we must sharpen the wording... i must think
but the nuance comes from the wording, because that is the first (and sometimes only) thing our users see
yep
yeah, but the problem therein is that the arbitration of what is nice or not nice to say is on us; some things are obvious no brainers, but others boil down to taste, and we can't enforce taste. what we can enforce, however, is behavior.
id probably lean towards something that states "if you have nothing nice to say, don't say it at all"
though i will one of these days restructure the wording of the rules to something more definitive, because it can be argued that they are not ripping on the art, but rather just stating their distaste for it; we've established currently that our views on excessive ripping existed for the sake of curbing the LARGE amount of salt against some very bad fanfic writers, so if we want to have better enforcement against this, we need to address our wording
yeah
i already mute enough things
`i am not brave, this is a very public place`
but yeah, alice is right
i would zoom in closer to read kriisas screenshots but i am on campus and those are some dicks/tiddies there
They're dumb
- random person who just spoke here in the game room im in on campus right now
"thats not even water, thats H2O"

today was a good day.
between that, managing to help a chronically sick friend pass their exams, and being useful in a networking class for once...
i watched the sunset quietly from the distance while laying back and basking in the breeze; the booster i opened had an articuno gx
i liked their business and i got myself a sunkist and a celestial storm booster and decided to bail since everyone else was busy playing other tcgs and didnt want to linger around there if i didnt have any more business
i showed them my binder, which i took to them, and tested how they give price checks with cards by giving them one card to check whose price i already knew; their response was congruent with what i already knew, so i knew then it wasn't a place where they cheat people out of cards.
i got to meet who i believe is the owner and he showed me his mammoth binders of standard ptcg cards; as it turns out, they put aside some of their stock for boosters to open up and add to their collection to personally trade/sell directly to people
but
BUT
there wasn't one, mainly because they actually have it friday
mainly because i wanted to make sure the people there weren't horrible shitheads
went to stake it out
i thought they had a pokemon tournament
i went to a card shop today
_sits down_
YAY
***ALL GACHA, FOREVER***
CAPE MUST BE IN GACHA
CAPE
_BURSTS THROUGH THE DOORS_
yeah dropping it is fine
`i want to hold her in my hands...`
_weeps..._
mariabot...
yeah
that way people can get used to exchanging and using kiricoins without feeling rushed to learn a whole new game
i think what would be smart is for us to focus first on pushing out the gacha card collecting aspect of it first, and then stepping back and going "okay, let's focus on the gameplay"
i want to have the card game as simple as possible so playing it can be as snappy and enjoyable as possible

Nothing happened on my end
big dog

it shocked people that i had the capacity to make jokes. it was that bad.
and much more stressful, since it was with more people, and thus made me infinitely more distant
it used to be much, much worse
like, you see how much of a stickler i can be towards doing things In A Given Way
not because of malice but because i was ***much*** more of a hard-ass
i would not be friends with any of you 7-8 years ago
i am designing the gameplay for the card stuff right now. once ive sorted out my ideas ill be handing them to you in an organized design document for you to read through and judge
heheheh
where is this happening
no wonder hes single
she's been working extra hard with the subreddit feed
maybe shirabe was just tuckered out
oh
but for mobile it does not
because i just opened up my pc and it says who it is (but only for bread)
maybe it might not be a bot problem, but a phone/pc api problem
now its showing up as normal for bread only
*collective floor shitting in agreement*
*takes a shit right on the floor* "sure glad we're not the subreddit discord, huh guys?"
He'll likely bitch about it in valk and they'll all circlejerk about it to themselves
(Without understanding banlists are a thing)
An old classic harking back to the IRC days
The old "YOU CANT BAN ME, IM LEAVING"
Ah
Where did he announce it
Kriisa... you need to fix the invalid user thing
Did he leave
...wait this is a site
what is gamewith
(note: i am not going to structure this as xdu, i just am curious to know)
<@!127644949884698624> you used to play xdu. can you show me where i can find details on the card types and such
i saw some ideas thrown around but im looking at the doc and it is empty
okay so gameplay is a complete blank slate right now
where's the design google document for all this card stuff
was she born on american soil?
actually, better question
need to confirm this for someone
would that have made maria an american citizen or considered one
was FiS an american institution on american soil
gals and pals, jog my memory here
realizing victory
okay dokey
because im a nerd
and yes, i gave this a plot
but this roughly covers what i feel would be the best approach towards this, since i was trying to focus on something intuitive and easy to use given that this whole thing would be constrained within discord
note, this is a very early first draft, so there may be many things lacking
this is the game idea in mind

im done with the document for now
because it was confusing me a bit
alright i just want to know if they were like, seperate cards or not
are the ascensions going to basically be the same card, just with newer art
question
now i am going to type them out and draw them in a good design docket for yall to read
i am nearly done writing down all these ideas
ohhhh.
awaken status?
yay
though thinking about it, i want RV to mean Revolution
i like RV
aight
you basically just talk and then someone writes it all then, and then organizes it for you
alternatively you can get someone to shadow write the ideas down for you
yeah... but its gotta be done, i usually tell symphogi the same thing when he talks about his games
it helps to write the ideas down in pencil and paper first and then clean them up by typing them out, thats usually what i do since sometimes you write a thing and then go to type it out and go "wait, this sounded dumb" or "im missing this detail" and stuff
yeah its just not good for this, thats what i meant
i know my idea `was not good` but there is a reason i jumped immediately to cleaning it up and writing it down
you may want to document and organize this information
ill do that at home since thats where i have the tools
_tosses idea into bin_
well, i gave it my best shot
right
but... we're using cards...
oh
...any thoughts
***HUGS ROBO CAPE***
finally, cape is in the 21st century
i am still happy that mariabot is here
I suppose
I'm sorry
Its hit me now seeing it in action
Yeah
I worry that can lead towards abuse in the long run and give the wrong impression of what the coins are for
I do not know if I feel comfortable giving coins towards something I'd prefer to see executed altruistically through community building as opposed to paying people for doing reviews
at least, from what i remember the last time we talked about her
THIS IS THE PERSON YOU SAID WOULD NEVER STEP FOOT HERE
OHHHHHHHHHHHH
OH
that would be good
this draco person seems familiar...
though in reality itd actually be discord's character limit
so, in theory, one of the names can be the entire bee movie script
is there a character amount limit for names
the longer the name the more fucked the formatting

also, dunno if you know this
i have... very silly card names
fixed it
how do i... rename my cards

the card in question?

anyway, i played myself
well, wait, no, i dont think the problem was having the pngs, but rather the means in which we got them needs to stay a secret
oh right
also, i played myself like a champ
honestly i need to look up sites similar to discord.me to begin reaching out to new places
yes
also i have been distracted lately
oh there it is
OH
I HAD 0
I DIDNT GET THESE COINS
`did people start with 500 coins`
did people start with 500 coins?
wait
paisa already scratches this itch for me
i will go against my base instincts, dont worry
thats perfect
```After having checked the discord API, there is no direct method of checking what invite link were used by the joining user. Therefor this feature can at current not be implemented by a bot.

(There are though ways of fudging around this by saving the list of invites before an after someone joined and checked what invite link incremented, and through that know wherefrom someone joined.)```
reading around:
or even who joined from what specified invite
i dont know if discord has an api function that tracks who joined from where
that is hard
what do you all think
but yeah
here is a list of discord server lists that can be potential candidates to look at. i say potential candidates ive only given these a cursory glance to make sure theyre not horrible, fakey fake sites that steal your pepsi and call you a bitch
```
https://discordlist.me/
https://discordbots.org/servers
https://discordservers.com/
https://disboard.org/
https://discordsl.com/
https://discordhub.com/servers/list
https://discord-server.com/
```
the fact that the subreddit feed is operational again only makes this better, because we can get more users using the subreddit again (since we are the subreddit discord)
this two prong failsafe system means that if sometimes happens with a site, we can snip it easily, while still maintaining something to advertise on there without consequence.
each server invite link on each server list site is labeled accordingly to which one its plugged to. the catch is that for each description of ourselves for each ad we do on a server list, /must/ have a link to our subreddit. if the site is compromised in the way the discord.me site is compromised, we kill that invite; but, leave the husk of the invite itself online. that way, potential people who stumble upon this invite can see the link to our ***subreddit***, and join accordingly through there
here is the model proposed

something i talked to alice about for me to do a few months back while i am busy doing college stuff and not being able to contribute much is to passively dig up sites similar to discord.me to put the word out about the server; this time backed up by a means of managing the security of our server a bit better if and when those sites may be compromised and abused such as how discord.me was.
`Our next move, of course.`
what am i procrastinating with, you ask?
but instead i am procrastinating, like bobo the clown
i should be doing homework
true
maybe make the daily rewards 12h intervals instead of 24
suggestion
mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
you may want to implement the intro package automatically when they join and then state 'yeah we got a gacha'
also yeah
ohhh
oh
im glad shes here though
something about her gf not being very into subreddit stuff and thus always avoiding it, which was the reason why chris would never be in here
and yeah
in that case, its valid
the best answer is 'not yet' because our rewards are based on activities we're doing in the community organized by us
i thought he meant actual virtue
oh
yeah, pretty much
oh
where
what
nope. because our server events need to be structured in terms of reward wherein that doesnt happen; and if it does, the money can be passed around easily again
the point is to have a dynamic ability of making a betting pool for events
the idea is to implement a Pot object. basically, initializing a sort of object that is a container where kiricoins can be dumped in by users that moderators can maintain and distribute amongst users
not now though. kriisa has worked hard though
but, before we do so, we need one more function added into maria bot that would be VERY helpful to making this happen
nothing gets the blood and the hedonism going than some good ol' fashioned bets
the thing in question is events
```i know exactly what will get these nerds going in spending their coins from hoarders```
also
yes, that is crucial
yeah
R x Ver is dead, now it is R x Robo Cape
darling... darling robo cape...
also robo cape
i suppose the only reason i have not been more... on top of these things, is because part of me was just excited for `coin` and the other part of me was too distracted with school to point these things out
hindsight is 20/20, unfortunately
i mean, we can allow it this round, then wait for the next round and go "yeah we're changing up some things"
we cant tell, objectively, whether people's input is "sufficient" or not when giving feedback; we can right now because its very earily, but over time i feel it may boil down to fickle abritration that may just turn off people from giving feedback, since they can go "i want easy coin, this isnt giving me easy coin, ergo i will move on to the next behavior that gives me easy coin"
plus, there is another problem...
that part is fine because its less performative for the sake of getting coins and more honing a skill and using a motivator to keep you from losing the skill
except kiribased
like studying by reading a thing and rewarding yourself for reading a piece by eating an m&m
because then the onus would be "we want to reward your motivation for writing pieces of fiction, which in turn is a good motivator to getting you to practice"
we could just have coins rewarded for submissions, as opposed to discussions
people were already giving feedback regardless of cash, it seems unneccessary to tack it on for something thats already doing well
honestly i would cut it completely
as opposed to just having good members
it gives off the aura that the server exists to compete with itself to be the best member
when looming at fancontent and paying people for reviewing things, it struck me that not only would we be conditioning people to do things for fake cash instead of the other way around (people getting cash alongside doing the good thing) and basically killing community altruism, but also we'll have people who just straight up feel more isolated because they dont want to do things for cash, but rather for the community's sake
also yes, that is a concern
im waiting for latooni to say their idea first
i know exactly what will get these nerds going in spending their coins from hoarders
but, do not despair
the funny part is with the card game i had designed, i had explicitly set it up so it could play with money bets
ah yes. the eternal pitfall of capitalism
what, why
and okay doke
its not breaking any rules and there's no real harm in poking fun at something that is meant to be had fun with; this concern seems to boil more towards an individual than just "heehee joke"
if you two personally have a problem with rakhi joking about it, then talk to them personally about it and tell them to quit it at like, a person to person level
i hate crypto too but folks are just joking around with a new toy
who will genuinely look at kiricoins and go "Yes. This is genuinely a cryptocurrency. It's very much like Bitcoin."
i mean yeah, but... what is there to misread
we've literally joked about that here between ourselves
i dont see the harm in the joke
except it doesnt
its the digital equivalent of "here is a box, put in your money, we're playing a game and taking bets now"
for starters, it gives us the means to be able to half if not fully eliminate the need of doing things manually if we do custom events hosted by us from the staff that arent built in bot events. its something to be generic enough where we can go "i want to do x thing and make up the reward table and experiment around and rope the community into it" and have that ability without programatically making something new for the bot every time
kiricoins arent a real currency. theyre monopoly money
okay, but that isnt the point im trying to explain to you. im trying to approach this from a perspective of engaging the community as a whole; remember that we're not fostering a true blue economy here, just making sure that a toy we've introduced into the community isnt horribly abused
but playing alone, with a bot, is boring
because yes, we can indeed craft and or even use the built in nadeko games
even if its explicitly consented for a game where their losses are very low at the worst possible case scenario and where the winner is only slightly more richer, and the winnings are distributed on a curve as opposed to "winner get rich, loser get poor"
we just need to control the tiering of the winnings in a fair and not horrible distribution
we dont need to control who the winners are
also yes but by that logic it means people must immediately spend everything, which means people wont have money to engage in other facets of the server
okay, but why settle for a partial solution... when we can tackle it with a more concrete solution, which is facilitating engagement through events, and having the means to engage these events (circling back to why im pointing back to making something like a pot)
caps dont stop the 'people sitting around doing nothing with their cash' problem. it only means people will max out their cash limits quicker across the board
yes, we can, but aside from gacha, our means of having people to toss in money is... nonexistent. and yall were very much talking about the concern of people just idling, racking up massive piles of cash, and not only doing nothing with it, but immediately and swifting defeating any sort of gate we put up to have custom roles or emojis or such
okay, but also like i said, the onus in making sure people dont get fiendishly rich, is to set up the event to prevent it from escalating that way
and again, events would be structured in such a way where people dont get fiendishly rich out of it
im aware, but also if we did this a communism kind of way, it would get very boring very fast
then we can @ people the contents of the Pot
i talked about it before. basically, its the concept of a Pot object where people can toss in their kiricoins and moderators can manage and distribute it; this is for the sake of facilitating bets for events
but also i want to wait until kriisa is refreshed so she can add a crucial thing for future events
now i want to plan a big event for october as a party
in the event that anything happens, that information is now pinned, and we can shoot down the invites if need be. all of them have links to the subreddit: that way, if anything ever happens, as per the model, people can refer to the subreddit directly
the bottom one- ill keep that in mind- managed to list our server but does not hook correctly, and i sense its because it needs a bot in there as well, even though it shows up without it
two lists were used, and their invites are next to them. the third one is a leftover spare

thanks for auto-embedding that even though its formatted inside `, discord

most of them wanted to shove a bot in here, which i naturally turned away from
as it turns out, a lot of free discord server lists that arent discord.me are scum
that was a fuck fest!
so!

ive stumbled across one of the most incredibly discoveries in the modern world
everyone. wake up, now
_in sheer terror_
_pauses_

_ditches a dead echidna_
_cracks knuckles_
aight
yay
<@!127644949884698624> do you object to me combing through and setting up the invites for the server lists i linked
i did some homework like a good boy and i will finish the rest tomorrow
okay
<@!102691114762371072>
go for it, that works
that is also true
anyway, the answer is yes, regardless of what we want, to stay consistent with what we're doing currently. if we change our minds, we announce that and provide transparency on what we've changed up.
yeah
no, thats not!
no, that is a horrible exaggeration and i am apalled that you are using hyperbole when i am really trying my best to be nice and not be angry here
thats the whole principle of implementing this
we have more control in making sure the users are happy participating with it
the former is better as a learning experience! thats the whole point
thats the point in experimenting with these events, and experimenting with them manually; to keep around the ideas that do work and refinining them better and tossing away the bad ones
```for events we're not even sure what they are and whether we want them```
tweaking as in adjusting the event after its over, or maybe looking at the results and going "man this sorta wasnt fair enough" and then just giving a better consolation prize
```easier to abuse on our end due to "tweaking" after the fact```
what
its basically being a GM
the extra work is to give us leeway to do whatever we want
thats the point
because i dont know if people will react nicely to that, and i dont know if the math itself may need some tweaking to be more fair, and i dont know if maybe we'd just need a totally different approach altogether
but rather wrong as in morally wrong
not wrong as in the math is wrong
but the built in math might be wrong and unfair
it eases your workload and lets us do things more asbtractly while we figure out which events and money spread wins work best
yes! but thats the point! its either we do the math ourselves, or ***you have the program the math for every event we make up***
yes, but if its tied to what im explaining to you, which is made from user input as opposed to our hypothetical bank of infinite coins, it means that the math would have to be centered around a highly variable total that changes drastically from the amount of users participating, and how much they want to put in wrt cash
the former might be good, but the latter for first/second/third may vary on percentages. the reason i emphasize doing this manually is for this to be a means to do things on the fly to see what values work and what dont
there's no going around putting in work for an event, though
its less work on your part to program
yes, since the values can be variable, and each event can have wildly different spreads in terms of their winnings
maybe an extra tool for gauging percentages in increments of a factor on the fly as well but that can also be done manually if necessary
sorta. you wouldnt need an enter event. remember that the idea im proposing involves doing events manually for the sake of having people host them, so we can experiment with ideas on our own without needing to add in custom things for every single little thing we do. rv_enterevent would probably be rv_enterpot "name" "buyin amount", and the ping command would be more rv_winner <name> <amount> to assign each winner's winnings manually
how would you re-implement every single event that happens, with that system
okay, what are the win rewards, presuming that what you're proposing is to programatically add in the event itself, when events can be wildly different or do different things. for example, i could rehost mafia again, but ive been also been planning to do something with the Big Brother simulator to do something fresh ala the old hunger games simulator stuff that was done in valk, and i wanted to tie kiricoins to it
the first sentence says that "the pot is an object container". it would be something that keeps track of the count of what people have given in, in terms of coins. ive already explained the metaphor as a basket. host offers basket. people throw money in.
the event is done manually, as i said
a pot is not an event
no matter how complex it may be?
are you going to pre-program every single event we'd want to do?
this implies the event was pre-programmed in beforehand
```A moderator intializes an event via mariabot.```
okay, but as ive also pointed out
and it was based on a percentage given in
so what if the reward was just kiricoins in turn
kiricoins? the very same way?
okay, so what are we using to buy in
not bot. contents of the pot
*pot
the event would be run manually, but the means would be handled freely and dynamically
a pot is an object container. a moderator initializes a pot via mariabot command. users can use a mariabot to throw kiricoins into the pot at their own discretion. the pot size is variable to user contribution. ***we***, as the host of the event (whoever that may be), distribute the contents of the bot from within using mariabot commands with whatever the event calls or asks for
i want to punctuate for the record that while i will keep going with the conversation, it is a bit hurtful and unfair for me to sit here and participate in what is essentially a thesis defense for a simple idea that is used very widely everywhere in vast mediums of entertainment, and that im not gunning to make an evil casino out of this. also, ive already explained that a pot does not need to be programatically tied to events. yes, you are talking about a ticket system. are you going to update the rewards manually every time? are you going to change the amount of tickets given out each time? will you be available to do that, each time?
except the former is still the same anyway. the winner is just the house. its just not stated because it is much more subtler.
additionally, just as there are losers who dont get the pot, there are losers who will also just lose whatever non pot based thing you do
except this is done without everyone involved in the community. this is what im trying to reiterate; the community aspect. there is a difference between going into a lotto, getting a ticket alone, and just hoping for a win, and going into an event with multiple people, to have fun and discuss theories and crack jokes, and then throw the money around to winners fairly with events of our own design
```that is equally possible to do with "here is a box, pay for a ticket, here's the rewards"```
the winner doesnt NEED to take the full pot
its not something you really hide
pool style bets have been around for a long while
i mean, it can be easily deduced
yeah, thats exactly it
its not a bank
no
its just a tool to use for events
there can be multiple pools for multiple events
yes, the point is a command to create a pool
```Would it not make more sense to generate temporary instances of a pool like that rather than to keep one around constantly?```
i need to shut up and focus on work
the pool is kept around not for the sake of hoarding money but for the possibility of an event taking like, a few weeks to execute over time
do whatever you want.
i retract my idea
im awake
another time.
i am trying to be as nice and as not angry as possible and it sorta hurts to keep talking right now
except if we are doing an event, it would imply that we have planned this beforehand, and we are not just doing this blindly. its not just random guesswork; its going in with an idea, seeing the results, and going "yeah, maybe this didnt execute very well. here are some more consolation prizes"
maybe once a day
no; because i specified that this would be something that would probably happen once
yes
```if I give Melua 100. She gets 105, and I get 5 back. This is what you're suggesting?```
and then refine it for the former
if there is a choice between "this can warp the economy a bit" and "this will encourage positive effects in our community", id opt for the latter
well yes, but remember that this a monopoly money economy; we're only regulating it as much as to keep people from exploiting it
reinforcing community values
that way we actively encourage people to give cash to other people and share the wealth in a positive way
i actually even had an idea to encourage positivity and friendship with tipping by making the initial tip give a bit extra to the person its being given AND the same amount of that extra cash being given back to yourself
yes
a lot of neat ideas were thrown around, but at the end of the day, it will be easier in a lot of facets if it can all be contained in one solid location and organized for easy revision
i feel that we should more focus our energy on a proper design document for whatever game we want to create for this gacha should accompany
yes, that
i think thats how you spell that
adding gachas i can imagine are a sinch
thanks kirichan.


i only kept discussing a bit for clarification
i did already say i retracted my idea, and to do as you please
and we need to buy time to design a game if we want to
pacing content keeps things fresh
but yeah, itd take a lot of coordination and if that happened we could just intervene
i know
not daisy daisy chain
daisy chain
...
hypothetical profit can only exist in this system if you create a daily daisy chain of 2 or more people and roll around the money in sequence with them
yeah, but the value is really small for it to overtake exploitation or doing so just for extra money. and remember, this isnt just people getting paid. if you give kriisa 100 coins, and they get 105 and you get a 5, you've still technically made a net loss, regardless of the amount you do
paving multiple ways of doing so would be nice, thats why i suggested that
and yes
i think the fringe case of people compulsively farming this every 24 hours for something that is much, much less than dailies wont pan out on the facet that dailies would be a more efficient system to farm than that
it seems like a fun thing in good faith that encourages niceness
```if there is a choice between "this can warp the economy a bit" and "this will encourage positive effects in our community", id opt for the latter```
im sorry i should have been more specific- why
`initial tip`
also
```Rakhi takes forever to name her cards```
its basically getting members by gunpoint
because its forcing people against their will to come to the community purely for the game instead of coming to contribute
wait
but yes. very evil. very bad.
my brain confuddles mariabot and kiribot with gacha things
oh yes
this is a very evil thing to contemplate
but
you see, it dawned on me that there's nothing stopping kirichan from existing on other servers. but! if we did that, then everyone could play this gacha without being in ours. unless... we force people to roll on ***this*** server only, which means that if people want to fully participate in this game, they have no choice but to come to our server
mine is... a bit more evil
thats /your/ evil idea
but i want to bite my tongue on it because its extremely evil
i have a very evil idea

it has not been taken down

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIsGEGuhMms
ah, HERE it is
though im trying to find something that could be a good work around
yeah
uhhhh, every video about symphogear that shows songs that isnt edited or warped in some way has mysterious dissappeared, dont underestimate japanese copyright pursual
i remembered something and am looking for it
like how the pokemon and the metroid fangames were developed. not a lot of talk besides "this is around"
yes, but their game is very... hush hush
this reminds me...
actually
wait, actually
_uploads every genesis soundtrack possible_
`My own music...`

like how sony managed to get a fucking video on bach removed, because of bogus claims of owning the copyright
though these days people are getting much worse with copyright
yeah
yeah, as long as you dont use their music it should be fine
the only people who make symphogear games are either the folks behind symphogear, or `very underground`
there's the legal ramifications of this too
yeah, but
a webapp is... a lot of work
i usually feel bad already giving kriisa suggestions and i try to make sure whatever i pitch is as simple as possible even if i can be dumb sometimes
though, i still feel a webapp is asking for a lot and i worry it may be too complex for us to make as a bunch of freelancing people who... arent paid for this work
yeah the webapp would be more valid since its "here is the game, come to us to further talk about it and get some stuff"
that is true. also kriisa you should probably add that as a disclaimer when people roll
and never name a card

and i only have a faint idea of what you guys are doing outside of- oh there we go
but, we gotta document it.... starting now, honestly. because this sounds like a very big, long project
yeah
this would be different because id be following the guidelines of what we're trying to design, as opposed to me doing totally new things
i was very new at doing reddit theme stuff
to BE FAIR
the latter is more me following orders
there's a pretty strong difference between me throwing ideas and me doing art that is requested
and organize everything we're saying now
but, before all this, again, we need... to document this...
_flexes photoshop powers_
i can do sprite art and ui visual design if needed
i think i am just attached to this picture because it is so cool looking and yet ive found 0 application for it- also that looks pretty amazing
you may be right
hmmmmm
this should work better since it will morph with the circle appearance and then crop nicely
try this one

like, just the head
which might work honestly
oh, that is the crop, unless you feel it might look better even more cropped
lemme see if i can...
though id want to preview it first
you may be right

`Serna...`
that will be a bit harder. ill think of-
the result is things like that
then i clean up the "stray" pixels and make it into a more cohesive picture
paint.net's way of doing contrast filters does it in a way where the image itself successfully becomes not only monochromatic, but also perfectly aliased. so the result is something akin to pixel-art
the colors were chosen as color pallettes from the picture itself from her gear
what i did was use paint.net's contrast figure to maximum and then swap out colors
accident
scythe big
yeah, but
good point, though ill have to dig up the original picture of that
kirichan defaulted for our sins
just participate in it and reward yourself
its brilliant
TELLING LIES? `NO MAMA..`
OH MY GOD
oh my god cast5's chart is amazing, im saving that
no lemme see
the s4 model would invest all our kiricoins into tomatoes
she's performing... `economic terrorism...`
this is what we get for getting the s2 robot model
i cant believe maria is the source of our debt
maybe kirichan isnt saving the coins being recieved during pulls
i cant believe we're a debt based economy run by what the robotic duplicate of a singing crime fighting magical girl slash power ranger needs to pay back to everyone
what was the command for that one again
no no not print money, i mean give people money from my own pocket
how do i give people money again

im trying to think of the ***simplest***, bare bones things to do
its why im thinking
i know
usually i think, and then i put it on paper, and then i think more on it, and then i write and share
my brain is still mulling over these things
i know, but like
storyboard stuff out to see what necessary menus are needed
thats what i want to get to documenting first
thanks
im just scared, i guess
sorry that im venting about this here. but, i trust you guys a lot, and yeah
one more thing running in my brain...
thats on the table
so
there's probably a chance that she'll like the idea but be too lazy to do it and thus throw it away but i also see her sending in her credentials and then not getting involved and that in of itself is already a major compromise given how scientology works
like, no. absolutely not. never.
***i wholeheartedly refuse to be roped into this***
i have been dragged to new age cult locations, mineral/rock stores who sell shiny rocks as a front of said new age cult stuff, dragged along to hidden personality cults of incredibly conservative evangelical priests who use the power of persuasion to convince people that their abortion was their mistake in horrifying acts of guilt tripping
and i am ***sure as shit not getting dragged along to fucking scientology***
and where she goes... i am usually dragged along
she's read dianetics in spanish and believes it but hasnt really been targeted by any scientologists until today since theyre probably campaigning due to the new base they made here in miami (ive seen it during drives to the beach)
naturally, her response was "im going to read this and ignore your warnings because im stubborn and also tom cruise is in this so it cant possibly be evil"
im sorta terrified right now because today in the morning a pamphlet for Scientology was here as part of the mail and i looked at my mom and explicitly warned her not to even humor this and just have it shred, because, you know, `it's scientology`
i currently have 4k in the bank that is shared with my mom so id need some time after i graduate to make sure i can cut her off without noticing and then just fucking leave
thats not an exaggeration
my life
damn
classes are going alright in the sense that ill pass them all so nothings really in my way
i graduate in december
`please.`
i can get a job easy. i have a lot of certifications under my belt and some experience. i can do retail. ive already got a resume set up that i can sharpen.
literally anyone. i dont care. please.
i clean, i cook, i watch over things, im good with fixing stuff, i dont know how good i look in a maid outfit but desperation leads to interesting bedfellows
so, who would like their own servant in their home
unrelated note: it seems my timetable on wanting to leave my family to live as far away from them as possible has sped up tremendously, as per the writing on the wall screams "spending any time after graduating with them is an extremely bad idea"
kriisa is now infected

***HEY, PAUL!***
i love huey lewis and the news
the power of friendship
what a coincidence, you're the best mod of the symphogear server too
if it was me id probably do something about the time of day during sunset where the entire landscape is enveloped in gold
its less mystical and more "the anxiety that keeps me up at night causes hyperfocus on things and delivers ideas to my brain more intensely and clearly than being awake in the day"
or my brain does the weird thing and tell me ideas in my sleep
im just a very slow as molasses thinker when it comes to things because i take ideas and sorta boil them quietly in my brain
we're in the asspulling phase
thats fine
this is why i am mulling over things, and then storyboarding afterwards
which menu tabs should we apply to the webapp, and which ones can discord handle itself?
thats another important thing to ask ourselves
im assuming there will be an initial starting screen, yeah?
well the thing is that isnt the most basic of questions; the most basic of questions is: how would the flow of the program operate in terms of accessing the game itself, which boils down to first addressing menus
but right now im mulling about what to do, which in turn needs to lead to storyboarding
thatll be my forte, dont worry
shes not our workhorse
no, but simple is necessary because im not going to force kriisa with so much work
but i gotta like process it first
its the same approach when i shared that tcg idea. if you read through it, the "gameplay" is literally just a combination of Uno and War, except automated
like i /will/ still be leaving but i will be taking some time so i can save to get a car first
so the rush isnt there anymore to leave
dont reserve it for me though im still visiting options and it seems my mom took my advice and tossed out the scientology thing
i will keep this in mind when the time comes
nice
im poor
i got paid ten dollars today for returning someone's 64 GB usb key filled with a bunch of personal sensitive information about them
True, I suppose
What do we do about really nsfw memorias or cards

hehehe
pillow talk it up like you know how, latooni
`fate stay night intensifies`

game mechanic design, i love blissey and would hug
note: `write all this down`
at least something as minimal as teaching the game
should there be a simple single player campaign? i want to get that question out of the way
question
ill be talking here since it works out for the call i suppose?
and filled to the brim with data
the latter is important because my ***fucking*** god was it full
right now im juggling between doing a group assignment thats due today at midnight and also sleuthing this 64 GB usb key i found in school and successfully managing to contact the owner to return it to them tomorrow
(i am a bit busy doing Some Things but starting tomorrow i will begin real focus and documentation on things alongside organizing)
So dumb
"Why am I not allowed to hurt people?", I say, as I violently step on someone's throat
*and graphics
Animations and a graphics are a final priority
Are you telling me you drank `a hibiki`
im extremely paranoid with dmca requests because many are done mechanically and done even for the smallest of things
like, none
yeah, but better dealing with mediocre than making something only for it to suddenly vanish. that being said, i think we're good as long as we use no assets whatsoever for the main app
and stats
just names
initially, this is why when i did the design docs for my idea, i did it with the fullest intentions of it being within discord only; by keeping the visibility only there, they can never touch us. that being said, i would advise not displaying card art on the main app
the less they see of any assets the less likely a takedown
he's right; clearly, he hasn't earned it in the server if he's immediately breaking its first rule
_slowly turns to hulk out but instead of hulking out he just curls up and cries on the floor_
`I'm always worrying about it.`
but, thats my secret alice
ill have to make a simple sprite template to do that with a consistent body model
i already knew ill have to manually do sprites for every character and character alternate design
we could go the fate go route and have alternate card art, or i could design smaller card representations for rolls that are custom
thats what i was thinking
and i dont want her to get boned after doing this long project
i just want to be ready for that possibility because the person who will face the brunt of that, if that happens, will be kriisa, since they are explicitly hosting this game
the threat is higher that bushido or what have you stumble upon it and go "SNOOPING AS USUAL, I SEE"
yeah
that being said i doubt any of them have enough japanese chops to email a japanese company or make a report in japanese, so
so yes.
i always assume the worst
_eyes the entirety of valk_
or worse, being issued a dmca as a bluff with it having no legal standing, but us not being able to represent ourselves effectively enough to rebuke it
well the idea here is to do it with none of the xdu assets whatsoever. my main concern is more towards it using 0 xdu assets, and still infringing copyright in some way anyway
but japanese copyright is notorious for hunting things down to the ends of the earth
i wish
ITS ***SWIFT***
EXCEPT ITS NOT OBJECTIVE-C
OBJECTIVE-C
instead now currently i am stuck with...
i miss C#. i should do new coding projects when i graduate to sharpen my skills with it
but i also know kriisa's working with c# on this and frankly thatd be perfect for handling it
java is definitely stronger with ooe stuff than python even though id rather work with python more
oh
**PROGRAMMING?-**
`ORIENTED`
***OBJECT***
DID SOMEBODY SAY
_BURSTS THROUGH THE WALLS_
get that breadth
now i get it.

i found an image that lets me understand this
wait
owait
oh my god what the fuck is that
ohhh
and polar coordinates are an arcane art i refuse to touch
so the solution to this was translating trig coordinates to polar coordinates, and then working with polar coordinates for stuff
this was actually a problem that a friend of mine who was studying game stuff in a college had
but the problem is that trig is unweidly for programming things because it delves into weird values
a unit... circle
because its a unit
regardless of where you turn it
the radius is never squared here because it is always the same size

and absolute y
yes its absolute x
because the radius is...
because the unit circle, which is |x| + |y| = 1, can also be written as... sin^2 + cos^2 = 1, but the radius isn't squared
also thats trig stuff, let me rack my memory
understand my pain
yes
imagine if all your units, in turn, were maxed, and then you hit the ceiling of "i only roll units i have that are maxed out, and then get only tokens from them every time"
which means ultimately the endgame for efficient profit would be to hoard everything, forever, and then constantly roll to get money from all maxed forces
and then it can be maxed out again, and in term profited upon. except, then, deleting it hampers the profits of rerolling a maxed unit and just getting tokens
i see
i presume that in order to check whether you already own the card and is maxed out, the card must be there, and maxed out
that means that deletion will be skewed towards AFTER the card is maxed out, since the optimal strategy for maximizing cash returns in this instance is to allow the card to be maxed out, and /then/ delete it, unless deleting it in turn removes the terms in which coins are given?
i see
what will you do with cards that are maxed out but you keep pulling regardless
except with that system in mind, deletion is basically frowned upon, and youll end up gamifying clutter instead of letting people work with their favorites
yes, but every deletion is usually skewed to be profitable gameplay wise in some form
even if its like, pennies
every gacha game gives /something/ back when deleting forces
why
the sub question for 2 is: if they trash cards, do we give them a percentage refund
do we allow players to play with less than 4; naturally the default needs to be 1
okay
since this is a turn based thing, how many player-based characters will be in play at maximum
yeah, like
2. do we give people the ability to delete cards to make space
1. what will be the party maximum of forces in this game when youre playing
well, two questions
question
alleys dont really exist here in miami so im good
"Never chase a dog into a dead-end alley."
also i got another fortune
nice
i will...
`i hate you so fucking much universe`
"It's definitely a day for work, not play, so don't be tempted."
had some chinese, time to see my fortune
also here is a cool graph showing which languages influence which
https://exploring-data.com/vis/programming-languages-influence-network/
AND THEN TRYING OUT THE ***NETBEANS UI CREATOR WITH JAVA***
JSWINGPANE
JOPTIONPANE
i remember when i had to design a ui from scratch with java...
it helps that c sharp is derivative of c which has existed longer than java, and c# handles events much better than java
python is more a scripting language while C# is closer akin to what java does without the problems of java
can a tie condition be possible (ie both units dying via one doing damage to reduce a unit's health to 0 but also the unit themselves being poisoned and losing enough health to hit 0)
can there be repeat units (ie two shirabes)
how is a winner determined
hehehehehe
yeah...
i remember the IRC days when quote repositories had to be HOSTED AND UPLOADED by copy/pasting conversations
im so glad we have a quote repository system
dess_.. R
symphogear ultra prism
anyway yeah it can be prism
but... tasty...
oh wait i have crackers
look my brain is still marinating in the tasty sweet and sour sauce i had and i want more...
well i more meant that they do not inherently have the association of prism and that my issues stems less from people going "OH, THE FATE THING" and more "i cant unlearn the fate thing"
what
so that could be used
they dont copyright the word prism
also, you're right
i mean that would be gjallarhorn splinters
which kriisa liked so im carrying it over from the card game idea to here
...meta gels well with symphogear rv's plot
even though its a good name
but yeah i dont feel like calling them prisms because it gives me fate flashbacks and the people playing this likely also play other gacha games
_files information away_
oh
...love tokens
gay tokens
but theyre not actually prisms? theyre green cubes
since fate already hands out prisms
prism works but it reminds me of prisms for fate
IM BUSY
GUDAKO GO AWAY
no go away gudako
no
`"Shouldn't you be grinding to level up Caster Elizabeth Bathory? It /is/ the Halloween event, after all..."`
_a certain red haired gremlin puts a hand on his shoulder_
`Of...`
prism reminds me of...
i prefer prismata
...we should give tokens a formal name because my brain automatically assumes on its own that kiricoins are tokens
i was confusing kiricoins for tokens
alright, that is an important detail
okay
yes, but, the currency of our gacha is linked to the currency we do events with; theyre one- oh
unless we set money returns to be less than their rolls, this could break things
money that can be used... for everything else
yes, you do; but you're still generating money
this sounds like a very dangerous endgame
thats doable
my brain says 64x64
you told me before but i wanted to double check
how big are the grids pixel-wise
thats along the line of what i warned when they first came here; they have very mechanical thinking
yep
they are the litmus that demonstrates that we as a community are solid enough to have someone coexist here that has incompatible views and slowly improve their behavior in a way that theyre less terrible, while having strong enough rules to point and say "if theyre being a shitter, they get the door"
to be honest, despite their behavior, i find jacque to be the biggest success in our server
its why bingo was so convinced theyd come back regardless
repeatedly
whenever theyd be chewed out for their behavior theyd just simply leave for a period of a month or two and then come back
in fact, they were /worse/ over there
the problem is that they were the same way here as over there
except they did. id see them talk; they just blocked quinn AND hecate (something most staff members knew but didnt really do anything about)
i sorta saw this coming from the get go and was surprised that they even played so nicely in comparison with valk
i was surprised you were so friendly with them before, but i figured it was just your own positivity in play
true
i know it is very tempting to tell jacque that he should very much not be a spineless centrist but no good road will come of it
dont respond to that, latooni
a funny one, "most common unit this unit has died to"
many games have stat menus so that works
can players have kiri-coin free matches?
players will be fighting against each other. what do they get if they win within these matches? will there be a leaderboard? game perks?
will we ever release a joke card set
will we release single player event campaigns in the future or leave it to be contained amongst players; in this vein, will any events happen with the app whatsoever aside from card set releases?
will we have Things in the grid that our team must manuever around
oh that brings up a question
sometimes ya gotta just draw
if ya gotta, draw the grids with diagrams
is the gameplay gonna be mario rabbids rpg style
wait, so to better visualize this in action, and this is going to sound extremely weird but humor this a moment
its gonna melt
latooni unleashed her laser beams on ideas and it got too hot, you need to blow on it to cool it down
<@!102691114762371072>
i dont have strong opinions on gameplay because i am not good at nor have i touched the rpg genre a lot; a lot of the questions i give mostly defer to like, generic mechanic choices or external things
it will help with documenting all this
yeah you may want to show this off with more drawings, like step by step
`two 2coop2`
that was fun.
but then visual basic sat next to me, pulled that away, and made rock paper scissors games that i rigged the ai to win 50% of the time
its more an animation tool with logic thrown in than anything else
i was forced to use it in high school
i despise ALICE, the programming language
and not our alice
i used to use Alice
visual programming languages that are good are few and far in between
scratch is a visual programming language
yeah
if you wanted to go the extra mile you could design the designer as a drag and drop sorta thing to avoid syntax errors
fascinating
see i was thinking bank teller but armored car is infinitely more hilarious

what does this make shirabe
if kirichan is an atm. and maria is a bank.
<@!102691114762371072> question
`You'll get your day in the limelight... illegally printing kiricoins...`
_gently pats kirichan 2.0_
_weeps_
alice can we add the kirichan atm as an emoji
LORD KNOWS I CANT, ***CHAYYAYAYAYAAAAAANGE***
***AND THIS BIRD CANNOT CHAAAAAAAAANGE***
CAUSE IM AS FREEEEE AS A BIIIIRD NOOOOOW
ILL NEVER CHAAAAANGE
This is true, my like for Maria and like for Cape are mutually exclusive
I can still smell it on her, it smells like regret, bad decisions, and sephora
Maria wore cape
Is Cape also valid
jacque's negativity irks me, so now im going to apply some soft, but firm pressure on him
i made sure i didnt bring you up
i know
get a water bottle
latooni no wonder you're so thirsty, there's no hydration to be found with pickles
we do have a nsfw channel

also
visual basic is good. its not the bestest of the best but its neat and the ide it uses is cool, intellisense is a blessing and it helped that i learned from a microsoft veteran fossil who developed on microsoft back in the 70s
okay, i think im having a stroke now
did you just call me melua
...
i already had a hard time learning rollerblading; that with sharper implements screams a recipe for disaster
didnt actually skate though cause i had to look after kids and i am just an inherently clumsy person
i remember when i went to the skating rink here in miami a while back

A MERE PITTANCE FOR THE PROLES COMPARED TO THE OODLES OF CASH WE HAVE, OHOHOHOHOHOHO~
i woke up, i showered, washed my hair, had breakfast. im feeling good.
`911 what's your emergency`
WH-

_casually eats several poppy seed bagels_
this is now a drug free staff and we're testing everyone for WEED

that was almost a haiku
_brain does dial up noises_
no
wait
yeah
`its almost like all of them are on valk`
how convenient
probably
its probably more positive because they are allowed to get away with more.
what do they say about valk
the concept of moderation to the unmoderated is shocking.
pretty much.
essentially
just copy paste it here. no need for more screenshots
id like to see what else sianz said after that
precisely
practically automated, in fact.
the moderating work is done for us
if their hearsay creates a false narrative for the people outside of it, and the only people listening are also assholes, even better
i ***hope*** they are afraid. if they feel the atmosphere isnt good for them, then its precisely what we want; curbing people who are assholes away from here.
i couldnt care less what those idiots in /sgg/ think. i respect their consistency within their moderation enough so that im fine with working with them, but at they end of the day, theyre 4chan shitters
thats dumb
oh
kirika transformation gif?
ill pm it to you
ill give me to ya now; its dead anyway
i still have the notes.
do you want to know the spoilers of what the setting was going to entail
i will keep it around for fanfic ideas.
a shame that the other setting wont see fruition
if we ever do another tabletop thing with alice's desire of a slice of life thing with intrigue (using the MAID system since i think its real neat) my brain has come up with a new, interesting setting that makes it pretty cool
by the way
im extremely dumb.
thanks latooni.
that means i havent peaked
ive officially peaked. its not going to get better than that joke. im retiring as of today.
`There's a reason you're in a relationship with her.`

go for it
whether they genuinely felt that way or was simply peer pressure to preserve quinns friendship remains to be seen
they were also good friends with quinn, and i do recall the both of them back in valk getting in knots over DL's art in the past
as for lilac, i cant really think of anything quotable. i just know that theyre similar like me in regards to how they react to things, but unlike me where i just have hammy reactions for the sake of fun comedy, they more freak out or just express disgust
_gasp, shock_
`it's almost like thats how communities function`
you shove him in a shitty place, he acts shitty. you shove him here and... he's a pretty swell guy.
i think he is like lectric in that he blends in with his surroundings or actively tries to
im honestly shocked how far hes come given how he was in valk
wobbles has gotten better, surprisingly
i am just of the positon that, much like most that come out of valk, i dont have high standards for their behavior
im sure someone like jasmine doesnt mind company
bug em more
i feel bad for them sometimes but theyre an incredibly childish person with even more childish beliefs
also i care not for jasmine, to be honest
nice!
our moderation literally does itself
yep
pretty much
you didnt even tell him off
not really
issues have been so few and far in between that im pretty sure their impression of us is less of them partaking of our server and more just hearsay of people who watch from the outside to make their own assumptions
jog my memory, when was the last time we seriously enforced our rules
i guess what they fear is our style of coercion towards enforcing rules, which is how moderating works. we work so well in fact, that the last time we seriously had to enforce the rules was...
shocking.
***HELL YEAH***
HELL YEAH KRIISA
fuck that guy.
i forgot it was a holiday period
its columbus day?
wait
An opt out role then
Alright
Okay but the other more used opt in roles work as intended, and the point is to reward people who want to be rewarded
Itd be much easier to do this than check manually every single time
Because I still see opt in roles existing, and a role is basically a list but with a tag put on the user to boot
What roles did we purge
A role might be better suited for telling people apart while leaving access to kiricoins public for everyone
She doesn't like awards but partakes in dailies
Lucifer is technically one of them
We have people who want coins passively though
And keep it a flat rate
I feel like at this rate we should create a role for people interested in getting kiricoins through art/writing to reshape as a tool for motivation as opposed to just paying people every time they do a thing
` cape`
`ULTRA JUMBO PLAYING CARDS`
And people have many, many roles
You need to click on a profile to see them
Roles are not immediately visible
or pretty much anything aside from talking to bingo
or google an answer
id rather ask scrmz's friend
lord forgive me for my sins

my anaconda dont want none unless we've got builds, hon
naturally
i cant lie about it.
i like those
logging stats of all emojis used and ranking it
can that actually be a bot function
...actually
depends on which one is used less
at this rate ive been tempted to create an emoji server where we can store all the legacy emojis we have
if they have them
i guess youd have to find them on their visible social media platforms and see how they think
okay. brain screwed back on again
to see which judges are staying, to see which ones are assholes to avoid for future things
my brain is mush and loses track of things
what is this for again
the most solid way i could imagine is befriending a judge beforehand and convincing them to handle your case and hoping that works but i dont think there's any real formal medium in the justice system to allow this
there may likely be some sort of referral system but most judicial systems in the US are very much the 'my way or the highway' when it comes to doing stuff
`likely all lobbyists`

tonight on this featured magic trick show, i'm going to put a gift on display for our darling little sister serena cadeznava eve, a little featured but otherwise still beloved character of symphogear
ladies, welcome to the R magic show, where I, R, show you magic tricks galore

_casually puts something on a table. it's..._
_pulls up a table, adorns it with a cloth, gets a little magicians hat on the table_
maria would specify 2018
maria makes it extra formal, serena doesnty
but also its a quick edit for something extremely silly
it is a quick- no ill always need kriisa
dont sweat it i found it
KRIISA
CAN SOMEONE LINK ME
Can someone link me the serena horror bleeding from her eyes pic from the show
Nice
i just am keen on keeping a closer eye on them due to them coming from more lax places moderation wise and in turn internalizing very bad things because of people who break rules who are not enforced upon
i dont really care whether valk people come or not, barring what we spoke of the blacklist long ago
but this is all tangential on my part, and its not really even something we have to worry about
misinformation travels best in hushed tones.
not publicly.
Except because of it not being wildly known coupled with them being the biggest community, they in turn have the ability to facilitate the dominant narrative
thats not surprising given a lot of strife is not pulbicized since valk's moderating style is "sweep it under the carpet and let no one know"
_`THROW`_
THE POWER OF MY FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU WILL PROPEL YOU INTO ***SPACE***

i made this all for serenacon
but yes
`Until next time...`

that is all for R's magic trick tour. i hope you all appreciated my magic tricks. how did i do them? well...
***IT WAS ALL PART OF MARIA'S PLAN!***
***I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!***

_gives a single lick of his thumb and simply RUBS THE PICTURE OUT_
I WILL DEDUCE WHERE SERENA GOT ALL THIS SHITLOAD OF CASH
NOW FOR MY ***NEXT*** TRICK
***THIS PICTURE FALLS OUT***

_turns it upside down_
_shoves the picture back in, shake-a shake-a shake-a_
***WILL BE FILTHY. FUCKING. RICH!***
_pulls out oodles of kiricoins and stuffs into the hat_
THIS NEWLY REVIVED SERENA, WHO CLEARLY NEVER DIED, EVER, AT ANY POINT OF HER LIFE
NOW, FOR MY NEXT TRICK!
yes, it is true! the power of *shoves paint.net aside* magic, I have successfully reconsistute a picture of serena... 🅱loodless.
(this is the part where you all go "OOOOOOOOH" and "AAAAAAAAAAAAAH")
tada!

_pulls out the resulting picture..._
_rolls up the picture and puts it on the hat, taps the hat three times with a baton_
all of serena's blood... `will magically dissappear...`
for my first trick, in honor of serena's anniversary

THE PC GORE
IT HAS RETURNED TO ME
that makes sense
i dont remember, its been a while
jacq is a weirdo but they're more of a pushover than they let on. i dont anticipate this escalating to a ban
when you deploy it, tell us, so we may have your back
on the basis of harassment
and if they keep doing it after they get the boot
if they keep doing this we will give them a formal warn
ladies, i understand you're charging your gay energies to become super sogay 2, but we must address this very bad thing
IT'S BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, ***BRILLIANT I TELL YOU!***
***I'LL SMASH IT WITH A HAMMER!***
`Ah, how shall I do it?`
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cx7jzq2Bx4
and if they become shitter...
on the one hand this is an offsite issue since he's inviting you to group chats external from this community, but also we have a protocol for this to handle it (thanks past me) and frankly i feel the best way to handle this one is to just tell them up front to stop doing this shit
but also, `what`
i know, its a shitty band
`what`
uhhhhhhh
that sounds like a job other mods should do if you're not available to do it
what
preach to the choir
except with the exception of reporting things, which is less the user doing the thing to address is directly, but more leaving a note of "hey this happened please resolve it when you can" as mods are typically mortal and not omniscient
you NEVER want users to do the work you're supposed to be doing as a moderator
which is like, terminal illness levels of a bad community
its a classic case of "this person skirts around the rules and is generally a weirdo to other people but the mods arent doing anything about the culture of our community to address this, so now we as users will take it into our hands to retaliate by being assholes"
and they got fed up
yeah people either actively shit on jacq or ignored them
Also discord is sending me updates at the top frame of the app for mobile and I despise it
Interesting
Huh
Jacque left
BOTTLENECKING 👏 AN 👏 INVITE 👏 TO 👏 ONE 👏 LINK 👏 TO 👏 WARD 👏 BOTS 👏 IS 👏 VALID
its `Valid.`
it needs to be replaced with the dominant one for the subreddit
i sense we may have shut it off in the face of cutting out invites
<@!127644949884698624> when you have time, check out the invite in the New Reddit theme, since it might be broken
it makes me curious on whats going on in valk...
though im surprised, given they leaned towards the 'subreddit stuff sucks' camp
theyre not hostile but theyre not exactly friend material either
valk regular
i am genuinely curious what brings them here
_eyes kuon showing up, of all people_
Kick some ass kriisa
I hate it
Like it baffles me
Naturally I voted yes but these things are so painfully mutually exclusive and I know some fucks are gonna go "this is terrible I want to vape indoors" and vote against ending offshore drilling as a result
One ballot had something about a policy that would both end offshore drilling for oil (a very good thing) and ***ending indoor vaping*** in the ***same bill***
Like
I hate how amendment and Bill's are colluded though
Straight ticket Democrat baby
I voted today
but fuck it, if its gotta go its gotta go, i set that all up on purpose for it to be destroyed if needed because there's links to our subreddit if the invites are broken, securing that we get some sort of visibility anyway
i think i had to make a widget for one of the site invites
ah
at least valk likely is getting it even worse given they have the discord.me link still up
i see...
i think we may have to cut every link excluding the main symphogear subreddit link
i will delete it more thoroughly when i get home since my chart is at home alongside login credentials
*anymore
ill dig it up when i get home but snipping the invite should kill it from the site since it cant scrape from it anymor
if discord had ip banning tools this literally would not be a problem
i looked it up and its some nerd with a lelouch avatar
I'm going to time travel to meet past Alice and tell her to kill it
Which is funny because chris was there back when it was called the subreddit discord
This is what I warned when I said valk thanks to its size can seize a greater narrative of history
Same
My brain misinterpreted the 'we acknowledge that we should just stick to games' as an actual apology even though its empty
Wow, fuck you GOG
Looking at it more closely they actually didnt
...that's a good point
At least they apologized and recognized they should stay in their lane
who left this sassy... small child...
that sucks.
damn
_pats kriisa_
shakespearean
an inevitable clash that only leads to strife; someone who thinks how the world works is approached with new information and refuses to learn, but cannot back away to a safer sanctuary of like-minded people because the people he most blends with have ditched him.
rukia strikes me as someone who has learned only part of this lesson long ago, which is why he still sticks around here, but hates that he cannot function with his usual habits
company amongst assholes is a friendship with attrition; over time, they break down because well, everyone's an asshole
thats probably the problem
the likelihood is low. mainly because rukia actually didnt like valk much, and we're the only other server aside from /sgg/, which would not shock me if he is
do not worry, kriisa. the fact that he shuts up means what we do is working, and working well. in fact, i would not be shocked if he went silent again for another few months
yep, but knowing him, he will likely want to debate it all again as he did last time, so frankly its either letting it die or banning him completely
i would let it die there
this was amusingly when i had to tell alice not to delete every incriminating offense
and no, but we do still have screenshots
its not, but hes stayed under the radar for quite a while
alice, my advice is to tell rukia that his patronizing on why he doesnt talk is irrelevant for the channel, and that if he has that deep an issue, the door is right over there
thats understandable then, scrmz, feel free to stay in your lane
i see
he is not breaking the rules, sadly
jesus

what is euphoria
evangelion embodies this to its core; wherein its points are largely ignored and people show up for the massive trainwreck
most edgy mainstream anime begs to differ
```And you're also not gonna have a huge audience purely from how horrendous that work would be.```
it doesnt take much to convince a reader that things are bad
DOOM is the biggest one that comes to mind
but also solopy is fundamentally wrong when he says it needs to be there on the basis of there being a long list of works that establish things being bad without going there
a part of me says anime has done far worse, and that the issue stems deeper into an institutional foundation of how most anime writers percieve storytelling to be within the mainstream in terms of marketability
the goblin slayer discourse
ah
which channel is this in

Celebrate the only way Miku knows
but its more just something fun and wacky to celebrate halloween with everyone
ill be real with you and say that if they didnt want to be skeletonized and wanted an image manip id still do it anyway
***THE WHOLE SERVER BECOMES SKELETONIZED INTO A GLORIOUS BONE ARMY***
thus, for halloween...
basically, people swap to an avatar that has a skeleton/skeleton based thing with a skeleton punny name and in exchange i would give them one image manip/shitpost edit of their choice; part of it is to get me into refreshing my image editing abilities again and part of it is to bring in a new wave of symphogear shitposting for everyone
i was still thinking about the skeleton army idea but giving it a twist so it doesnt rely on kiricoin since thats inherently unfair
because I HAVE ONE
also <@&336301457185832961> <@&336301943179968514> do we got any ideas for a halloween event
the only reason i have a facebook is to preserve psuedoanonymity
then again i dont really engage much in social media in general
im glad i never engaged in twitter
but yeah, i do second the motion of slapping that link and noting that
anything born from /sgg/ carries with it its philosophies; louis and symphogi may be responsible people, but 4chan has a corrosive touch through and through
the anticipated outcome of this is that yttt makes no real headway with editing progress, and in turn simply sit and wait on our call to do things
in fact, its that assurance that i know they will come back and just ditch yttt
our users are big boys and girls who have the capacity to understand and leave whenever they dont like it
with proper execution, we not only keep peaceful diplomacy with yttt, but also make sure our users understand why we do what we do, maybe weed out some bad users for good, and let yttt/sgg and valk ping pong back and forth
hella
this ties back to my old plan of cutting off valk (which we already did) and letting valk and /sgg/ interchange members into one big morass of shit, cooperatively sabotaging each others communities by having their cultures grow intensely worse (moreso valks)
we phrase the announcement making it clear that yttt is a seperate community to us with a different culture, and that they are looking for editors. we let our users find out the hard way what that difference is, and we let their own actions speak to themselves wrt their opinion of yttt. our community is already equipped in terms of strength in figuring out good and bad things; the likelihood is that no one would stay, outside of people already in yttt or inclined to that culture
here is what i would pitch we do
i dont like their internal culture and they are most definitely annoying, but they are at least competent in their management of things. i would immediately much rather work with symphogi and louis than any valk staff member anyday
yttt is just as much in our mercy as they are in valk's mercy
subbing groups are a two way street. yes, in theory, you could deny a community subbing content and starve it, but in turn you would also be starving your own group. the less coverage a subbing group has, the less relevance they have in that community. alongside the (losing) attrition battles of stopping content leaks from coming out if such a doctrine exists, it only proves one thing
there is one funny little catch he has forgotten, and one that i not only anticipated, but have now confirmed with them sending out a recruiting drive currently
but
louis is aware of this, and is aware of how he metaphorically holds the keys
yttt is in a precarious position of power wherein they are the most relevant subbing group (barring commie) to this community; ive voiced my concerns before about how yttt, because of this, holds a shadow like influence over things. and while we're on good terms with yttt, they contribute much harder to valk, which is why at the end of the day, valk will always have the edge over us regardless of community quality in terms of symphogear content
i understand your hesitation, which is why i actually say yes
i hope her and her gf are doing okay
yeah cherry's a sweetheart





you're killing me alice
please
i cant see the screen anymore because of all the blood that made me cry
alice, why do you want to remove my ability to see in this time of need
one hundred answer checkpoint
for i am capable of feats beyond human capacity
but fret not
all that remains are the answers. unfortunately, its 200+ answers...
_cracks knuckles_
i am home proper and working on the cah list
I usually get home around 9:30 and get on my comp at 10ish
I'm not home
aight
when i get home i can probs finish it off
not yet
also we can just have it be names only; if people feel empowered for avatars then thats fine too
its why i established it being hands off with silly shitpost commissions, i can get around to doing those at my own pace more easily
narration will be hard since this will happen while im on campus
and people shouldnt spend all their time fighting
its tiring and sometimes you just dont want to fight anymore, and it wears you out because you spend so much time fighting that it feels like you take two steps forward and three steps back
but sometimes you gotta fight
it sucks
it feels sorta dumb of me to say these things given that i dont have the perspective you guys do
every moment that you live in fear is a moment you wont be able to enjoy what you have around you, and while its important to have a healthy douse of concern and caution approaching things, know that today is today, and tomorrow is just another today you need to wait and see for
you've got a great job that i think pays decently, with an amazing boss while working with what you love
you've got real life friends whove got your back
you've got friends like us and in SONG who care about you and understand you
so my advice is honestly to keep an eye out for tomorrow, but not to forget today and live it
but it will get better.
and there's going to be periods where it might even suck harder
and its going to suck for a while
it sucks now
my point is this
there is not a moment where im not thinking about it, honestly, but that is just my raw anxiety in play in regards to worrying about friends
if it were not for discarding that mentality, i would not only not be here, but i would not be friends with anyone here. i care about you all dearly
but i met people that enriched my life. and then i met people that hurt me again. and then i met you guys.
i used to be much more nihilistic than what i am now. i dont have it as bad as you guys, but there was a time where i shared nothing about my life, about the things i deal with, and even bothering with making real friends, because i felt it was not only impossible, but that such change was just not going to happen, and that id be stuck with my parents forever in permanent obedience
and that is not only objectively worse, but will pretty much assuredly destroy yourself mentally over time
but its either that or just be trapped in raw nihilism that nothing will get better
and yeah
essentially, yeah
_eyes brazil_
it just sucks because when the setbacks happen, they happen and happen hard
despite major setbacks in places, lgbt rights are growing, and so to in turn will trans rights, and so on, because it is becoming evolutionarily more relevant to survive by accepting and caring for one another than killing each other overtly
progress comes and goes, but over time, we as people are growing to not only be more understanding, but also tolerate and accept these concepts. not only that, but people are more accepting these days, so long as they are sat down and spoken to. it just varies from location and culture; the fight is always there, and it is never going away, and it is something that gradually gains traction over time
but, it is not all doom and gloom
and those in power are vastly outnumbered by those who are not
because the bitter reality is that the rich are also, technically, a minority
as long as hate is used as the sole unifying force amongst elites to herd lesser classes, that is how it will always be, and it will never change because hate is self-destructive, and to command authority and subjugate, you must not only hate, but effectively point hate away
as long as minorities exist, they exist as the perfect target to be exploited on for blame just for being different, and not being the majority
also scapegoats
there is no relevant information to be gained here
i dont even know why you're watching it
at first i started telling her that wasn't going to be a reality. she said it needed to be
so i got mad. i snapped, actually.
even if everything seemed dismal, and without hope, i still had /that/. i still had fun and enjoyment with my comp and doing cool stuff with it.
and if i let them do so id have been left with nothing, and i mean nothing. friendless. dreamless. with absolutely no aspirations or goals in life whatsoever. acquiantances in highschool already told me my worldview was bleak and seemingly hopeless, that i had no real goals or motivations. but working with computers was honestly the only thing i had.
and they wanted to crush that too
computer science has been the one thing they have not now nor ever managed to have control of because it was the one thing i had an advantage over with them, because i knew more about computing than the both of them combined, and thus was always one step ahead of them
t-ball? parents hated the coach who was my neighbor. karate? parents didnt like that one kid who played dirty and took me out of it.
every time id ever go out and do /anything/ something would always happens that my parents would get involved and then take me out of it
whether it be for its escapist nature or the fact that i just genuinely loved fiddling with hardware and software, i had a deep love for computers, and at the time, i didnt have any other passions. thanks to my upbringing, most of whatever passions i could have had were destroyed
number two was that as long as i could remember, i had an affinity with computers
that was number fucking one
i would have had to have done ***AN ADDITIONAL TWO MORE YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL*** to graduate properly within their program
for starters, i had already done 2 years of doing the choosen path of my high school. i couldnt undo that shit; you need to follow the tract to graduate correctly, or else you'd basically have to start over doing classes from scratch
and man, was i livid, for a long list of reasons
she wanted me to never touch a computer again, and to move on to another career effective immediately
but the point of her telling me that dream was because she was basically giving me an ultimatum
_slaps belly_
she tells me all this, and my brain is already immediately refuting everything in that dream. for one, id never get tattoos, and a piercing is never happening. secondly, my mom always freaked that i had too ***much*** blood despite my levels being just a smidge higher than normal. and thirdly, as time would soon prove, `i am sure as shit not a sickly skinny prick`
***NEVER LET YOUR SON USE A COMPUTER EVER AGAIN.***
i was much older sitting on the edge of a doctors bed in one of those clinics. i was tatted up and had piercings, and i looked vaguely anemic and sick. my mom was with me, waiting for a diagnosis for something, but the dream didnt say what. it just had me like that in that state and her regretting everything while looking very sad. everything goes black, and i shit you not, she tells me that a booming voice told her the following:
her dream was the following:
so my mom takes me aside and starts telling me about her dream. obviously, alarm bells go off because ive been told about these supposedly prophetic dreams to death, and they never come with anything good
my dad believes it too, and so does most of her family members. she is actually weirdly feared because her tarot game is also good to the extent that she's accidentally predicted deaths within the margin of a month. nothing really fucks with people more than death. shocker.
now, some context on this. my parents are very superstitious; it comes from cuban culture. they interpret metaphor in everything, and they see spirituality in a lot of things. dreams, paintings, occurences. superstition is what they live and breathe. my mom has dreams that ***supposedly*** predict the future. she claims in the past to have had dreams that predicted the deaths of people in the family, dreams about 9/11 happening, the works. all that wacky shit
eventually i wake up and my mom sees this and while my dad keeps his distance, my mom approaches me. she's planning to speak to me about something. she tells me she had a dream
next day, im in bed and waking up a bit. parents are talking about something in very hushed tones. my dad has a sound of concern but seems very distant and reserved. my mom urges to talk about this.
spend our first day there, everythings cool, room's nice, beachfront looks, etc
no brainer. you live in miami, you at least go to miami beach once. it may be a tourist trap but hey! its fun, sort of
so all that garbage is going on and its the summer. i just finished sophomore year. parents decide to vacation in miami beach, because, well, miami beach
it didnt help that i was also an admin of Minecraft at its peak, and i was dealing with thousands of users who reinforced that feeling, because they were all dumb internet users who worshipped me blindly up until the moment i did a Thing They Did Not Like and then immediately cursed the floor i walked on, making it abundantly clear that even people who claimed they liked me actually did not like me
so, my high school was *Different in that it was a magnet program devised to be a mini college of sorts. the whole place was divided into fields to "major" in and specialize, and you'd graduate doing that "major" represented in a field. i did the IT field because i have been using computers since the age of 4 and it came naturally. back in those days, i was ***extremely*** different. i did not have friends. i did not trust people. i did not talk about my issues. i did not tell a soul anything that ever happened in my life. i caged all my emotions in, and over time, grew to believe i could never share them, because not only would no one accept them, but no one genuinely cared
no greater example of this is the time i vacationed with my parents back in miami beach back when i was... 17ish? it was my sophomore year in high school
like i said. im a cis guy, so while i try my best to listen as much as i can, and help as much as i can, my perspective is limited within the avenue of trans experiences. but, if there is anything i can deifnitely sympathize with, its fighting to get stuff done for the sake of your own future, because i live with emotionally and sometime physically abusive parents.
alright
i cannot stand in your shoes, but is it alright if i tell a story
oh thank goodness
(given that i would be in diapers, it would actually be me who is the shitter)
im going to be an old fart in diapers in a retirement home and im going to get my HoloCube technology to ring you up and go "HAH! YOU WERE WRONG! YOU'RE NOT A SHITTER, BUDDY!"
that is absolutely not true
i am feeling a story time
like i got ***stories***
my parents are different in that theyre... theyre just really, really dysfunctional with extremely poor life choices
nah i get you
well of course it wouldnt when the cost of living has been bloated so damn high by all the corporations making HQs around the area that the mere cost of breathing is 30 bucks a breath
oh right
oh
no, sadly, they do not
"do the horses live in the mansions"
and i know what you might be thinking
big mansions are hard to live in anyway, we have a bunch down here in horse county
is her name betsy devos
thats depressing
your dads rich and shes his wife, of course theyd vote for the asshole that would make their business run recklessly without any ethics whatsoever
im not shocked
and we're here to live it with ya
youve got your life to live
but thats not your concern anymore
its common for CEOs to get hooked on cocaine and the like
the good news is that people like your dad are on the fast track to self destruction. either everyone leaves him or he winds up killing the people around him, and the only thing that remains is solitude. with the money hes got i wouldnt be surprised if he got hooked on some drug for his sheer stupidity. given those violent bursts, i wouldnt be shocked if he already was beforehand.
its cool
we've got your back on it. im sure your brother is smart enough to navigate out of those situations himself, and understands why you cant help out
thats just straight up dumb
no, i believe you
and a coward probably, doing that to people much younger than him
he sounds like a fucking psychopath
fuck that guy
also, what an ass
sometimes physically
also the intended takeaway is that fighting is not always long term forever. usually fights are shorter term that take a year or so to get what you need, so long as you dont back away; and sometimes you've got to fight people for it
he cant do it to you now anymore
i see
i see
i feel your dad had the ability to get away with this more because he's... well, he's rich
she has never said this explicitly but i am pretty sure part of her giving up is because IT pays well in field, and her plans for me involve her living with me and basically being her breadwinner while she... exists and tells me to follow her every order.
because without a computer, i simply would not graduate high school, because she didnt have the time to take me to the library and supervise me there.
we did not speak the rest of the vacation. over time, she tried to police me dozens of times on me being on the computer. id sneak on constantly. she'd harass me and tell me to get off. over time, however, she was ***forced*** to relent, because my high school curriculms, even if they weren't it based (they still were) needed me to use my computer for online work and books. she'd say she would take me to the library and supervise me. she couldn't. she also failed to successfully destroy my laptop, and i still kept it nice and running out of spite. every moment being a thorn to her side until eventually she conceded and left me alone by the time senior year rolled on, because she knew i would just not change, and there was no way for her to make me change, and her ability to change me directly went against her continued desire to use me for her own means
and then i took one of the stuffed pillows on my bed and savagely beat her repeatedly with it and we basically got into a massive physical fight with her trying to throw the laptop i took with me to said vacation and us wrestling trying to choke at each others throats, neither willing to relent
then i escalated and told her all the reasoning i just said now. she did not care. it had to happen. it was basically commanded by God to do so.
That is the most important thing to be doing
She is being kriisa
Kriisa is doing stuff
YOU'RE JOKING, YOU'RE JOKING! I CAN'T BELIEVE MY EYES!

oh my god it has ruins mod too
`fear`
doing terra firma while also doing the twilight forest
oh lord, it just hit me
if you really wanna ill give it a shot. with terra firma i usually dwindle with interest because its a BIG hurdle to overcome everything and i usually am not big on hyper realism when it gets grating or hard to do even basic things
because terra firma is serious business
also... are you sure you want to enable terra firma
tch, no tinkers construct. oh well
shit there's roguelike dungeons here too
`Oh.`
PROFESSOR FLAXBEARDS MOD I LOVED TH-
***DRAGON MOUNTS***
COMPUTERCRAFT
it was... entertaining, but brutal
which is basically as realistic as it gets to living in the outdoors, in minecraft
long ago some friends of mine wanted to play a hyper realistic minecraft mod/game mode called terra firma
i thought it was the old, ***the*** terra firma mod
oh this is a mod pack
where have i heard that name before...
terrafirmacraft...
eat.. eat... EAT... EAT... ***EAT... EAT...***
<@102691114762371072> your name is great but I nearly read halley as harley
flaxbeards is fun but without caution it is actually capable of inducing earthquakes that can literally destroy the ground some devices are build on
also some mods dont lag but have the capacity for strong lag
yeah the weather one seems cool but there's probs a bunch of laggy particle effects on it
oh my god there's a weather mod
THE BIGGEST WAS 2056 AND YOU ***LIKED IT***
YOU DIDNT HAVE ALL THIS FANCY PANTS MASSIVE SIZES
i rememebr the GOOD OLD DAYS, when MINECRAFT MAPS WERE IN INTERVALS OF 8
god
EIGHT TIMES THE SIZE OF THE EARTH
thats true
(it just, up until later versions, had no explanation or tutorial for it; something Notch did purposefully for gameplay reasons, but did not anticipate that the greater additions down the line would need)
for all of minecrafts flaws the crafting system is extremely snappy and quick
because while i really like tfc's land creation and texturing (its super vivid and cool) the necessity for bigger building gates for greater realism sorta bores me on the basis that i play minecraft for less realism
until i have many a rock and get bored.
usually what ends up happening is that i end up running around traveling collecting rocks
not really; i did explicitly say tfc sorta wanes my interest either way since its such a high dedication to doing stuff
?
do not worry latooni, we will not leave you in the wayside
THE ORIGINAL MODDED MINECRAFT
dadido3, aera's server, etc
before that i used to hand on serverside modded minecraft servers
after like several years of not touching it
i think tfc was the VERY first minecraft mod i touched, by friends
yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwzUs1IMdyQ
techno... firma?
...?
a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time ago
i wouldnt fathom this being compatible with tfc but then again i played tfc like...
thats amazing
immersive engineering
oh yes
is there any way i can like, clone this pack and strip tfc and slap into tinkers construct for my own personal playing
there is nothing more entertaining for me than to make a large forge, make a massive village, get a golden lasso, and then begin systematically culling the village of the villagers with extremely shitty deals to smelt them into emerald
also yeah, i figure
i have a soft spot for tinkers construct because of the wacky and fun creation shenanigans slash insane religion worships i would get on to
honestly if this had tinkers construct this would be the mod pack i would use for like... forever.
ruins mod is great because it gives minecraft the character it always lacked
yeah ruins mod is lovely that way

flaxbeard at its endgame is capable of terraforming

but its playstyle is very much a "make sure to maintain these things or else they will either fail or blow up"
its very big on dwarf style bronze steampunk devices for faster and more efficient mining
so flaxbeard is basically one of the big steampunk mods for minecraft

Renaming the subreddit feed wont break it will it
true
the idea makes sense now but at the time i didnt give it as much credit as i thought before given gamergate from what i saw was less a coordinated attack and more a bunch of raving idiots piddling shit the classic 4chan way
ending up in high places and searching around online in communities gets you interesting stories sometimes. though, the point is more the perspective of gamergate being a massive breeding ground for white nationalism, which is a perspective i didnt think of initially
weev is an extremely dangerous white nationalist. ive known people who have known him in the past, who have had to deal with him. a manipulator and sociopath to the core. there is only one thing that dude deserves, and its a bullet.

yep
i just hope he is okay...
and thats what i figured
thats true
and i guess also sorta sad
but yeah like, i /know/ i did. my brain tells me this. but also i feel... weirdly guilty
HI MELUA
even came with an alarm, too
yep
i feel guilty, even though i think i shouldnt be. i tried comforting and talking to him as much as i could, but he sorta got to a point where the pain was a bit too strong to let him talk, let alone even get up
this was a few hours ago. i am hoping he is okay. a part of me knows i did as much as i could before real professionals came on the scene, but another part of me feels like i could have done more
they swing on down in less than 2 minutes, a cop and one of the building faculty. i help out as much as i can, she was friendly. eventually they get the heart shocker thing just in case they need it and pull this dude back from vomiting to help him out. i stand around watching, but there was not much else i could contribute, and the fire rescure was already on their way. i asked if there was anything else i could do to help, or if i needed to stay to give anymore testimony on what happened (since they asked me how i saw this happen), and eventually i left with my friends, who sorta sat on the sidelines letting me handle it while still being there for me if i lost my nerve
she does so, patches me to them, i talk quickly but coherently
he had a good smell of alcohol on him. he was clutching his chest and talking about some sort of heart problems. i asked him if he would like me to get the paramedics (there's an onsite police task force here and the ambulance comes pretty quick 'round these parts). he was hesitant, but the pain had him relent to my idea. the moment he said so, i immediately got up and went to the guest service thats really close (literally just like, a few meters away, since all of this is right at the entrance of an important building in our campus) and i immediately tell the receptionist that its an emergency, gotta get campus police and an ambulance here 'cause this dudes sweating hard and having heart problems, and also right then vomiting
he says no, and immediately my brain shifts from "joking fun R" to "no more laughs R" and i start talking to him, asking him whats wrong
just to ease her nerves (because she noticed how he was breathing was a bit irregularish but nothing too off) i ask him if he's okay
but then, my friend spots a dude lying in the seat in front of us (its a circular table with one of those seats that are nearly all around the table) that i didnt notice before. he's laying there, and nothing seems immediately wrong with him. my best friend says something might be wrong with him, but i did not want to bother him too much since i figured maybe he was napping (its common for people to take naps there)
our campus has a piano lounge. its this big indoor open area with a piano and lots of fancy chairs and tables as a public venue for people to chill in. a lot of melee shitters also hit up this place because big tables + outlets everywhere = perfect crt placement locations. today i showed up katamaring some friends along to see my best friend, everything's chill, we're laughing. i leave my stuff there for a moment to go to a jamba juice just a few yards away, treat my friend to a drink, come back, keep chilling. most friends leave. everything's cool
there is something that i need to get off my chest that just happened to me today and it has been bugging me a lot when it happened
I stopped at Libertarian

But I worry building resentment over things as opposed to paving roads towards solving them will be self destructive to your own health in the long run
This is completely understandable, but also is not a valid thing to hold against him up until it boils over into something that involves the community; in this case, you do have the right to call him out on it on a personal level
Over time, they either give up and disconnect from the community or stack up enough issues that something is done about it directly
People like Yorin run their course

a barge in the atlantic is doable for me
that sucks
im gonna make a thanksgiving post
im going to throw so many damn games at you melua
i sure did nothing productive today because of it
it sure is
"you did this" "no i did not" "let me explain the ways you did this" "that didnt happen" "here is a taped recording of that" "you deserved that"
they can never be wrong.
they move the goalposts back constantly
because, you see, thats the beauty of my parents
i showed it to her when she claimed she would never insult me that way, to which i played back her insulting me in the ways i described, to which she chalked up as "i deserved it"
two party consent.
no
and her, being the absolute narcissistic sociopath that she is, ***agreed with herself when she did this the last time, which was the end of the last semester just like this, when she literally threatened to get in the way so i would fail my classes***
mom denys everything i tell her. i proceed to bust out ***a recording of the last time she did this, and play it to her in my headphones***
proceeds to punch me repeatedly. i grab her wrist and twist it. she shrieks and tells me to stop. she gets even angrier and keeps punching me harder. i slap her hand away. long, drawn out yelling.
mom bugs me all day while im trying to do work. mom yells at me. i tell her to please leave me alone in equal tone. mom proceeds to come over and yell at me in my face. i tell her to leave me alone because i need to focus on this work

neither of which have bothered to look at the damn manual for it.
my mom and dad are fighting over constructing a fucking coffee maker
parents are the worst
the people who still use it majorly rp wacky shit on it and/or like to mess with new people by showing them the weird shit designed to spook people out
the servers ***still exist*** and still run as one big patent trolling scheme

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqel0k0NzNU
i told this to someone a long while back, but this idea isnt new; its just been shoved into vr. vr chat is basically the successor of worlds.com, with all of the madness that follows with it
being whoever you want, doing whatever you want, as whatever you want, to talk to people doing the same in interactable environments
its the oldest thing in the book
i do
whoops caps
I DO
because its weirdly entertaining in that it is one of the few last free internet frontiers, and its such a fucking surreal experience
i may hit vr chat some more
when i move out and get a better computer
so i visited a dimension that was basically a set of whiteboards and people drew funny hats on me as pikachu.
i showed up and got an avatar and dressed up as pikachu. as it turns out, if you dress up as something thats 1. popular, and 2. very relevant, people will love seeing you around
one of the main issues is performance; it lags hard even though thats been slowly improving
wherein i update and run vr chat and see just what the fuck is going on in that hellscape
i did my bi-annual reminder on why i dont play vr chat
`biscuit...`
im such a sucker for biscuits...
biscuit...
turns out brainwashing people is hard if your brainwashing puts them to sleep.
anyway. id have rocks on my back for an hour in a cold place and then we'd bail. my mom would eventually get cds that she'd force me to meditate to, which would backfire because the really soothing voice with the soft long synth riffs would put me to sleep really well.
as in from their very inception they are created with harmful intent
though i do agree there are inherently corrupt institutions
also, to be honest, while im not fond of religion, i feel the base of corruption comes not from the institution, but rather the people who seek to corrupt it, to which in turn the institution itself is mutated into a corrupt entity
new age music that was these slow synths would play quietly everywhere but it was honestly boring.
then i would be taken in to have rocks placed on my back quietly for over an hour for chakra healing
it was a very eerie sight that would still haunt me because of how well arranged it was. the sitting pattern was, exactly: one middled aged mother, and to her right would be a young girl in her teen or adolescent years. i was the only guy there. they all sat in this identical formation, with me included.
i would soon learn quickly that these shops were also fronts for new age cult groups. there'd be cultists wearing all white in a studio behind the shop where everyone would congregate and sit down in.
there was a period in my life where i would be taken to locations that basically- so there's these stores that exist that sell rocks. we're talking things like gems and precious stones and really shiny stuff. i was around 8 at the time, and naturally i was hyped as hell about this. i loved me some shiny rocks
i have so many stories.
there are no two people on this planet that have systematically made me hate religion more than my parents, mainly because i was taken to many new age cult stuff
oh no, my brain just says it on instinct because i shorten it from the phrase 'preach to the choir'
wait, no, my brain realized that is a poor choice of word
preach
banning memes for a day is amusing but hiero and live-shitposting have actual uses aside from just posting memes
i made assumptions in my oversharing. it wont happen again.
i think i will just shut up now
okay
you're right, im sorry
i didnt mean to insinuate that
im sorry
i did not mean to say or imply you didnt
im sorry
i was only aware of two of those things
one ive retaken twice
ive failed around 8 classes and retaken them
it doesnt, but it is the medium to which i have to break control from my parents
you still live with your parents, latooni, and you're much older than me. same with alice. kriisa got very lucky, because she is very smart. but im not. im a fool, whose coasted his way through education by either cheating compulsively or just making shit up. every moment im plagued with doubt. people look up to me, freshmen and sophomores who think i know programming concepts, and even think i explain them well. but despite whatever comfort i feel in programming things, the answer is that its not enough. not in this industry, where they quiz you when recruiting people, where they probe you to see if you have /real/ knowledge, and arent just faking it like a chimp eating a manual
what if i never truly move the inertia to get rid of them
part of my plan to escape my parents is to break their financial control of them, but what if i cant? what if i cant get a job and i wind up dependant on their ssa income forever
all this blood and sweat and pain and in the end it doesnt genuinely get me closer to a job. my gpa is garbage. ive spent too many years and too many classes retaken. one good look and my employer will throw my resume into the trash regardless of whatever certifications i have. i cant compete with everyone thats younger, with better grades, and much better work ethic.
why not? ive dug myself into this hole anyway. ive procrastinated everything like an idiot, again, and now time is just robbed from me because i deserve it. sometimes i even wonder if i should even graduate college.
i sure am garbage.
Zio likely needs a break
im exhausted from schoolwork
naturally
yes.
i just cant do time tables because school work
i mean dont let me stop you, i can catch up later
im tied up until semesters over
yes
and yeah
i feel like its ultimately the old issue of whether or not we make heiro very sfw
_moves over here_
I will need to draft voice chat rules for this, though I'll have to tack it onto the rule rewrite

it's not possible.

i read that as "im in Sonic with R"
impressive
anyway, it was all dumb as hell, and my parents would hop around religions despite being catholics on paper to cherrypick the best aspects of a religion that would directly reward them while ignoring literally everything else
the point of it is to take you into a trance to allow you to "take in the healing"
the voice is much deeper, usually male, with reverb effects on his voice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_5hQbafALg
here's an example of one with the exact synths
im going to give them a long talk about each and every one of these points. they are keen to pick on you, but i would like to see them match with the person who made this event to begin with
give me this, melua. i will deal with sparkle personally
rolling my FUCKING eyes
```The definition of

fuck

no i gotta fucking

this is the stupidest fucking
im laughing
oh my FUCKING god
GIVE ME THIS
***LEMME READ IT***
LEMME READ IT
HA
i will return...
dec. 9th is my ceremony
and if all goes well, im graduating
literally next week, because this week is going to be my last week in school
next week.
this is just me being my paranoid self musing about ideas but, if discord ever dies, we should have an IRC server backup for stuff
sip louder for maximum asmr
pulling the ol `/msg Nickserv #symphogear kick Yorindesarin stop doing that`
mmmm, irc flashbacks
it helps that i dont see or hear valk at all
because `you've seen my salt`
the only reason i dont want to hear it is because i am trying to desalinize myself and not be as angry or salty
yeah
its lots and lots of keys
clickitity clack down the track
trust me when i say it will make your life much easier
thats part of keeping the distinguishment between someone participating in the community, and being staff
but its always best to just say what needs to be said, and then leaving it as so
i understand your frustrations, given this is someone who walks the line constantly
the one thing i will say is that kriisa, you've really gotta dial back your disdain for people. there's a line between telling someone to stop, and then passive-aggressiver responses after that part of the job is done; it doesn't paint a pretty picture
no, private
for continuing hostilities after aila was told to stop, to which aila complied
yes, that is why yorin gets his warn and kick
what a thing to wake up to
aila definitely needs a warn as well, its just a matter of our system balancing between the previous infractions
agreed. his warns mount up for a kick
they both need warns
_finishes reading up, rubs temples_
_looks_
wha
you ***need*** a much larger, more experienced team than us, to make this happen
yes, but they still exist, and continue to exist, because of the massive corporations and/or millionaries that maintain them
there are so many moving parts to it
a social media platform is MASSIVE in comparison
we have barely started on our first and currently only major project
because a social media site requires a LOT of work
i dont want to be mean and shoot it down but i need to be mean and shoot this one down
no
that was a lot to take in
i may reach out to a couple more artists in this manner, and spread the word out quietly while making a reddit post about it and pinning it to show solidarity
she got much more keen to the idea once she saw she was personally affected
i have put things in motion, though. i bugged DL about it, because as i anticipated, she's one of the artists affected by tumblr's new policies. i pitched to her to advertise the discord on our behalf as a haven for people being displaced who like symphogear as well as a resource to find other artists theyve lost due to them moving
actually, no, though i sense it is related to it
`and naturally, that place could be us`
mainly because a massive niche of symphogear fans who use tumblr are likely migrating away from the platform to other places
in the advent of tumblr's self-destruction, i have realized that there is a massive recruiting opportunity that is a direct silver lining towards getting more users
i have put things in motion
morons.
i dont think there is any more succint image that details the problem with people's line of thinking more than that
as long as sparkle remains a member of the community, i wont do anything
regardless of my behavior, i am not hostile to users within the community; if people break rules and start yelling, i simply point them the door
i want to do many things now that school will be hopefully done
i do
im just going to talk to them and address each point with them
sorry back
i dont want to assume groupings of writers as i dont like forming views of 'us vs. them'
sparkle wont do it
as the person who made this event a reality, you have my blessing, and you've been doing perfectly fine
do not sweat this, melua. once im done with a good bulk of work im gonna talk to sparkle
This is not a bad idea
I think it is that I am too used to assuming people's gender as within a binary and then when I correct myself when I know their gender my primary instinct is to mentally correct into a binary, as opposed to splitting the mental schema between other genders
But one time I misgendered someone who went explicitly by they and I kept calling them female by accident because people had used female pronouns without complaint and I was too used to shifting gears from 'they' to 'other pronoun' to rectify myself permanently
With Alice it's not a problem because I've known her for like a year
By default I gender people whose gender I dont know as they but sometimes there are moments where my brain sorta relapses because I know some people who are bigender and jump genders, and some people who are nonbinary but dont go by they
Honestly, yeah
I'm not truly back yet though since now I must prepare for my ceremony on the 9th
I finished all the school work for the semester
It's over.
no takers. a wise choice. best to remain a cryptid to the server.
in all of my complete, horrid hideousness
who wants to see some `Inside Footage` of what i look like
for now this is more just milking an event to our advantage more than anything else
yeah
you got me melua, im actually doing a merger
pffft
not yet, anyway
we aren't that team.
i know tumblr exists but there is genuinely so much thought that goes into these things
yes
yes, and this is a great idea on paper
social media as we know it only become mainstream during 2008ish when internet quality became more consistent and we moved away from dial-up into dsl and beyond
im pretty sure lyssa can even confirm this, since she lived through the era of usenet and the such
yes, they were, in the 2000s, when the internet had not hit the full wave of user participation and was not 100% essential to every facet of our lives
Please change the lulu bus <@102691114762371072>

also go for it
....wrong channel

wait
too much capitalism.
ehhhh
go wild
ive been wanting to shed golden hibiki for a while
honestly, my suggestion would be to go somewhere completely different in direction
i figure. its just im so used to seeing it be neat like that
like, basically how you see it on the sympho server logo, but with the hat on top
mmmm, smaller
then yeah, just center it a bit better and its perfect
oh
<@!127644949884698624> hook kriisa with the bigger version
i like it, but i dont like how its off center
Gotta get her a fucking present because shes made my goddamn life
And then shredded the graduation denial form for me
Because she went "you know, I'll just wait for his final grade to come out before I file this"
And it turns out she accidentally did me a huge solid
Its real
I spoke to my counselor
I'm sorta locked in this bathroom crying really quietly while also laughing like an idiot really quietly
Gotta go to the counselor and make sure that graduation cancellation form is ripped to shreds now
Yeah
I fucking did it
I did it
But
I'm gritting my teeth so hard to not cry really loudly
I fucking graduated

I graduated
I
Hahahahahahaha
Hahahahaha
i have fully absorbed the failure and planned around it thusly. now the only remaining hard part is telling my parents.
i am feeling a bit better.
I'm sorry.
I dont really want to speak for a while
I failed.
my future's in limbo and im not really going to let the man sleep until its not in limbo anymore, one way or the other
so yeah
so he basically told me to wait and see for tomorrow to see if my score goes up to 65% with it, and if it doesn't, we'll talk tomorrow then
to be fair to him, he also noted that my last homework assignment wasnt graded yet (he hasnt finished grading those) and he says that adding that will have no effect other than boosting me up
yes, he does. it sucks. but its either i play his game or i fail, so i must play his game and take what i can get.
this is my highest priority given i literally just DID THE GRADUATION CEREMONY YESTERDAY, and my parents believe up and down im graduating, even though we dont even have our final grades
he has no plans to round it out, but he plans to help me out. its likely he will open up opportunities to do previous locked assignments to get it up to 65%. he doesnt seem keen on performing miracles, just things abiding to his grading scheme. so yeah.
because i ***absolutely refuse*** to fail because of ***1%***
so, instead of getting back into the motions of being a true blue moderator and taking up responsibility of the writing prompts again... i am going to be focusing on this
the goodish news is that i spoke to my professor about this, and mulling it over, he noted im 1% away from passing (passing score is a 65%, ive got a 64%)
i failed my final, and got a low score for my final project, for a class (mobile programming) that ive been struggling with for a while
so, some bad news
also, <@&336301457185832961> <@&336301943179968514> quick announcement
he does not seem to be taking it down; you may have to do it. im not a big fan of tests of character as a mean of rule enforcement. either they did a bad and we clean/chastise, or they dont. otherwise it just feels like entrapment
im assuming the black one is the screamer
<@102691114762371072> delete the screamer if you haven't already done so
I see...
Presumably graduating
Clad in their graduation outfit
Guess who's in their grad ceremony
thank you
Its fucking with me
and thus are dressing it up as much as possible to prevent negative ramifications
im pretty sure theyre using this tone on purpose on paranoia that they think we're overly draconian
i am used to people dressing up bullshit a lot.
i also made it painfully clear their tone was needlessly formal at best, and absolutely contradictory at worst
i didnt bother humoring it. i already did say we're not a company, and we're not employees.
i hope whatever cabal sparkle has, either imaginary or real, wakes up very quickly that i do not play games with this, and do not appreciate someone who worked very hard and consistently in hosting an event getting treated like this, legitimate feedback or otherwise.
then they sorta shut up and left with their tail between their legs.
and then when they spoonfed me their professional apology i disabled it yet still by reminding them that isnt helping
then after i finished humoring their points i made it painfully clear this was deeply unacceptable and encroaching on harasshment
summation: i detailed their points for elaboration and it led to lots of backpedaling. i pointed out a lot of things and they either shrugged or went "yeah pretty much"








take yer time
thats fine
`looks like gamers wont be rising up anytime soon`
it seems the gamer person left
it was less of a revenge bot and more giving a bot revenge modularity
I dont really understand why the community likes me so much, but i suppose I'm used to that feeling
Though rakhi just seems happy to see me hosting again
Sure
`whoops`
Ohhhh
so i made it 400 for christmas
the normal payout was 200 and the bonus for doing cool prompts was 600
nevermind i found it
whats the usual kiricoin payment for doing a prompt
aight
min 3, max 4?
<@!99695384296701952> what was the page limits you were doing again
what the fuck
wow
naturally
ill likely shift back briefly to something more traditional to what i used to do while keeping melua's three prompt idea just to get `in the swing again` since its been a while and then do some new stuff afterwards
<@!127644949884698624> im going to make the announcement stating My Return Proper and also that i am taking over the writing event, and then doing another announcement of what the writing events will be in december
NEVERMIND got my power back
FPL says itll be back by 2:30 (its 1:46 here) but I do not trust the estimates of a monopoly by principle
I was going to do the announcement for writing prompts today but the power cut out
hella
i would want to shoot for before new years but new years is in like... 2 weeksish so its not pressing
this is fine. it can take as long as needed, since its not something that needs to be done immediately.
since sparkle, who is being a big baby, fielded the complaint that the stuff the writers write isnt being unveiled, im tasking you with the job of taking all the submissions that weren't put up on the subreddit and putting them all together into one .zip (organized however you see fit) so i can slap them on there while outfitting it as a release. i may redo writing prompt writing packs as a monthly thing instead of a weekly thing, so that there is more content more perusing while people dont have what was read fresh on their mind.
<@!99695384296701952> i still have an assignment for you specifically that you can take your time on that is related to the writing prompts
since i am back, starting tomorrow i am going to be rehosting the writing event stuff. since it was agreed upon that it was a substitute thing until i was `done` with my shit, and also because melua had voiced before that she needed a break (with the timing being immaculate), i will be hosting a slew of christmas based prompts while also preparing for a christmas event aside of Chris's birthday (which we need to talk about what we're going to do for that)
<@&336301457185832961> <@&336301943179968514> ANNOUNCEMENT TIIIIIIME
https://i.redd.it/9xq14nidsi421.png
yeah that is actually really important to know

```
TO DO LIST:
- PITCH IDEA FOR SPOILERS
- REDO RULE SET (LONG TIME COMING)
- HOST WRITING PROMPTS AGAIN
- CHRISTMAS EVENT? MUST THINK IDEAS FOR IT BESIDES CHRIS BIRTHDAY
- GET SUBREDDIT FLOWING AGAIN (FINALLY DO RESKIN)

BACK-BURNER:
- START MAKING ASSETS FOR GACHA GAME AND ADDRESS CURRENT STATE (WHAT DO?)
- UNFUCK WIKI FROM CRYOGENIC STASIS (IT DEMANDS BLOOD)
- THINK OF FUTURE EVENTS DOWN THE LINE
```
and with that i will be DOING THINGS to go with it
THAT MEANS I WILL BE BACK TO FULL SWING HERE
NOW THAT I AM A FRESHLY GRADUATED GRADUATE STUDENT... WHO GRADUATED

well, i wanted to do a Santa R joke and then post up
im pretty sure it will still exist even if its deleted, but if its deleted there's no way anyone can do it, so it will just expire on its own
i just figured it would do what we've normally done for kirichan money stuff since we usually do it there and then it carries over like the rewards we give
why not just delete the message manually
oh this is the wrong place.
THEN I MUST ASSERT MY DESTINY...
I hate them.
Reddit funnymen coming out to cash out their conditioned karma points sinking to whatever low possible to get their imaginary dosh
alice has already reported back sparkle's opinions of us in /sgg/ and it reflects in line with that kind of assumption
i may just do that instead in case people keep clicking on it and it doesnt work to phase it out entirely as a "hey do this instead", that way more people dont get confused on clicking that more and potentially putting more work on us
i was about to just ask people who wanted the coins to pm me directly alongside an extra thing they could request as compensation for it bugging up
i was about to do another thing, but this works too
oh, shit, thats useful
one moment.
in fact...
i will make an announcement about it and supply the coins manually to manage it, though they will have to pm me to do so since after enough clicks, it doesn't record who pressed on the reaction
...33 people clicked on it. i sense they all potentially may have been affected
okay doke
`im sorry`

What are we doing for Chris's birthday

how is this
```And so, as the night turns into dawn, Santa Cape finishes his journey of delivering presents to all of the good people of the server. Whether it be blessing their future XDU rolls or quietly sprinkling SHAFT brand studio quality dust on the delayed Symphogear production, Santa Cape returns back to the South Pole to prepare for next season. "Maybe next time I'll just hand everyone a cape and call it a day," he mutters to himself as he rests within his cape based nest, like some sort of weird, modern dragon. "Mmmm... cape."

In his final Christmas act, Santa Cape leaned toward his unused Kiricoin stash, and threw it across the entire world, making it rain that sweet dess based currency for the entirety of Christmas. Permanently blessing the RV rolls of the server, he laid down and took one big nap, hibernating for the next holiday...

Happy Holidays to the server! May you all have a very lovely Christmas, and if not, may an otherwise miserable day turn around into a beautiful expression of joy you deserve to experience. From all of our hearts to yours, with love, the Staff.```
because god forbid anyone functions without me
i just got called twice
im working on it
Bold of you to assume I can die.
Is that how you'd like her to die?
If people have a taste, then so be it.
This is your sanctum of misdeeds.
Whenever.
"You're welcome, Mistress Fine."
So consider it my own personaly kindness of working out the fact that making you mafia means your ability to see both channels irrelevant.
It would be cheating to have you play. But I also don't want to exclude you.
<@!102691114762371072>
You're not alone.
**My pleasure.**
You amuse me deeply, Lucifer. If you win, consider your resume sent. Even if I'm dead... the memories of this I'll be able to enjoy, for a ***long*** while...
The present... is reserved for blood.
But I digress. The past is the past.
You know, you could have made a great apprentice were I alive...
How bold.
Choose your next victim. Or, don't kill at all.
Naturally.
Is there more to your name than what it implies?
You're doing well for someone who doesn't do this regularly.
Welcome back.
Interesting choice.
Surely, there must be someone you really, ***genuinely*** hate amongst the list. Wouldn't it be nice to see the ways I can cut them apart with ease?
Be as petty and vindictive as you wish.
Precisely.
Amongst the townies, who will you kill? The choice is yours.
It is the night.
Now then, Lucifer...
No. I'm not. This is me de-stressing.
Excellent. I'm glad we're both on board. You and I are going to have lots of fun, unlike a certain someone who turned their back on me so long ago.
Glorious and poetic, isn't it?
But if you're good enough, you can let them do the job for you. Let the pain within those haunt others to their own doom.
It may seem hard at first glance. ***So*** many townies to kill, so little time...
In your case... it's when it's down to one.
You win when the same number of mafia and townies remain.
You tell me who to kill at night. And I make sure the deed is done.
I'm the smoking gun in your hands. The smoking ***hot*** gun, mind you. Nothing less in my eyes.
Every night, it is your job to see someone dead. Or not. It's up to you.
You're mafia.
It's simple, dear.
It's no skin off my bones. Rather, on everyone else's.
If not, I can give you a rundown on what to do.
Lucifer... you don't mind if I call you Lucy, yes? You've played this game before?
It's just you here. I suppose this makes you the mafia, hm?
A fitting person for a fitting place.
Well, well, well.
<@182683872062865408>
I couldn't pass up the opportunity.
Have some company.
If the pool is small this time around, I might allow townies to go first... Mmmm. Give me a moment to wait.
Tonight is your time to shine.
Welcome back. From guinea pig, to killer.
How specific.
Ornamental fan...
But, have you taken one step too many?
You like taking risks.
It seems your arrogance is catching up with you, Rakhi.
Now, it is just you.
Goodbye, Homura.
You can.
So it shall be.
Interesting. Wien?
I'm **waiting.**
That is up to you to decide.
Is it wise to blame someone's tools over their own lack of skill?
But, I am not so much a murderer than I am a weapon.
How unfortunate. Usually I'm better about killing things.
It seems the assassination failed.
So it shall be.
Is that your final choice?
I see.
The Columbine Killer would be proud.
They might be your downfall.

You seem to pride yourself in assumptions.
Latooni?
Decisions, decisions...
Scrmz it is.
Scrmz?
Time for the killing.

Hello there.
You live another day.
That amused me deeply.

Strategies do not entertain me. Results do.
Who will you kill tonight?
That is the mafia way.
Lying is fair game.
No one needs to be in contact with anyone.
No. Because that's factually incorrect.
What do you mean?
Five remain.
So be it...
_Squints._
You can do that yourself, reading people's titles.
How ***stupid.***
How bold!
You want ***me*** to do ***your*** legwork?
The convention unfurls so many new serenas with so little Marias to love them...
Big serena, small serena, tiny lesbian serena, I cant believe it's not blood serena
Within the hustle and bustle of all these serenas
MEANWHILE IN SERENACON
Good morning serena
***JUST WAITING FOR HER TO TURN TWENTY ONE***
THERE IS A LOT OF SERENA NAME BRAND LIQUOR



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-bkx6RmDZQ
***TIME TO GO CLUBBING***

actually that could make sense
baloney- well
no, dead is not a valid age
shit how old is serena now
`Well it all started... many, many years ago...`
`You're probably wondering how I got myself in this situation.`
`Yeah. It's me. Serena.`

_freezeframes_
***SHE'S MAKIN IT RAAAAAAAAAAAAIN***

and it says...
i am
whats that sound
wait
`The purification ritual has begun.`
PRECISELY
did you know that chronologically, serena is the first to technically die?
its true, serena died for our sins
_quietly shoves a serenacon pamphlet into your pocket_
but, stay a while, won't you?
maybe
better than maria probably, and maria would agree
she's great at using airgetlam
she was a nice shining light for however brief she was
mmm.
she...
though thats mainly hearsay
she's a great little sister
_pauses briefly_
she...
serena's the fucking best
GOD do i ***love*** serena
_***KICKS DOWN THE DOOR***_
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXatquVqAc
NO BLOOD ANYMORE ONLY MONEY
SERENA MAKES IT RAIN MONEY



this one she sends to kanade

BEFORE ALL OF THEM
***THE FIRST***

FREE SERENA BRAND SERENA PERFUMES
MEANWHILE, IN SERENACON 2018
serena^2
its a symphoserena server
it's not a symphogear server
we're just rebranding the server now
SERENA HAS BLESSED US ONCE AGAIN
that too
the punishment is her frowning
just raw, indescriminate murder
she beats up people, as her is god given right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLDeNi-8vAk
meanwhile, in serenacon
as she does
AS SHE SHOWERS US IN KIRICOINS AT HER OWN BEMUSEMENT
BEHOLD, THE VISAGE OF OUR GODDESS

as she bathes us in money
a place where we can all love serena, experience serena, and ***be*** serena
its a con, not a fest
well, no
YES
BLESS HER GLORIOUS HEART AS SHE MAKES MONEY RAIN FROM THE SKY
AND SERENA GIVES
more are converting to the glory of serena's love
you cant hate serena, she wont let you, especially since you're her
impossible
he, she, we, serena
you're serena
im serena
***everyone*** is serena
i mean... to be honest?
you mean serenas
the symphogear franchise's backbone was serena this whole time
face it
Fine is just serena if she decided to rule the world and fuck god
dr. ver is bad timeline serena and i dont need to explain why
carol is angsty timeline serena if she lived but was angry about it
as accordance to the 'saint germain is maria 2.0' rule
saint germain's just future ***future*** serena
prelati is the victorian goth version of serena, and...
cagliostro's just serena with big tiddies and a bigger libido
genjuro? guy version of serena
shirabe's just a pint sized yoyo addict version of serena
kirika's the hot topic `dess` version of serena
maria? just future serena
hibiki's the short haired punchy version of serena
tsubasa's the sword noodle version of serena
everyone's serena
no
kanade is just a really big fluffy version of serena
its likely
discuss
every symphogear character is just a different version of serena
(When was the last time again)
Since.........
We haven't had a voice chat here since...
True, but the people predisposed to joining are people who actively do calls to begin with
The third is interesting but requires a lot of effort to coordinate, I'd be down to edit the footage if needed
The valkryie server does karaoke and does it surprisingly well when they host it but they have people who actively are in call
The second can be done but it'd be difficult to do here when folks don't do calls here
The 1st is good
i would be down with such a channel
<@!127644949884698624> whats your thoughts on this
mmmmmmm
we try not to copy emotes from the valkryie server
Animated emojis only exist for discord nitro users last I recall
<@!127644949884698624>
plus people dont leave a lot and the ones that do are just lurkers that want to move on
plus people leave for their own reasons and folks gossiping about people leaving isnt very constructive
AMQ group?
Too bad ping itself makes duets and group songs nigh impossible, but we can still try
Dunno if they still do that, left the server over a year ago
But it's fun
And ofc, it wouldn't be limited to Symphogear songs
Oh
We could do it like in /r/RWBY where it has a set time and weekday to meet up and get it going
Anyone present (but only one at a time for consistency) can volunteer to manage the queue
And whether it'll be sung acapella or alongside the instrumental is totally up to the current singer
tho I bet someone said it already
karaoke night?
FINGER LICKIN' GOOOOOOOD

i am already one step ahead
mainly because reddit is a fuck
we'll be looking into fixing it up soon
only at the end times when i and mariabot fight for cape supremacy, in the foretold prophecy during my fall after mariabot defeats me and becomes True Cape
<:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>
thank you for giving us the chance to spread this beautiful padoru hibiki to the server
ohhhh my god
oh god i can animate this too in the future with the padoru padoru dance if its allowed
ITS BEAUTIFUL
BLESS YOUR SOUL
OHHHHHHH MY GOD ITS AMAZING

Let's go
I suggest this as a sticker.
unfortunately this is the best quality i have. i was looking up hibiki pfps and found this in a shared folder and all of them were the same low res as this one. if i ever find the original, i will share it here though
idk
or HibikiCringe
BikkiCringe maybe
kind of like cringing or disgust
this as an emoji
so just <#336310266654490624> then?
makes sense
<:WHY:841071301678333952>
a channel to discuss the cooking spinoff manga and also a role for pings of new chapters and translations plsss
or #7b7973
#88867d
i mean how many adam fans are there anyway
#c4aa19
darker than fine but lighter than carol
like his whole thing is gold
gold though
the goofy answer: transparent because no one's seriously an adam fan
the somewhat obvious answer: gold
the answer i want to give: the most disgusting shade of green-brown vomit possible
i think making writing prompts into threads is a good idea
that's why i suggested just some way to prevent them from posting in image channels, since they disregard the rules there
~~you could make a role that just bans people from being able to post in the image channels~~
replace it with suggestion ball
you smell like a rancid pickle
if you have that role you should legally be allowed to be bullied
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
carol put her in time out (which is getting chased by leiur)
easy solution: we tie her to a chair
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
you shut matt down easily

It's why I never contributed beyond moveable tokens
The session I helped in basically was plopping symphogear characters into dndverse, which was sorta eh
Oh nice
Then again it was for Canon chars...
Specifically tokens for chars
This must be a different one then, I remember contributing stuff to a symphogear campaign
Oh
Was it with someone named radiantsky
(I was the artist)
I know who you are
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!
It's chill, this channel is just for greeting folks who come in so it's pretty much tradition; if you wanna lurk that's also fine
Probably not used to introductions

understandable
plex?
the alternative is cytube
we've thought about it but its not viable
yeah, we cant use rabbit for this. the usual groups grow to like... 50-80
how would you feel if you hosted a group rewatch for everyone sometime
im curious actually saki, you seem technically inclined and have some tech prowess
we'll likely get more on that during the summer
there's been talk of forming one but its been hard since we wanted to synchronize it with the other symphocommunities and also `we need someone to actually host it`
the show is currently on hiatus because theyre working on season 5 so you're right on time!
feel free to live comment about the show in either <#407060923078017026> or <#336310266654490624>

Yo
***YESSSSSSSS***
YES
yes
TOO MUCH CAFFINE, EUROBEAT, AND POWER METAL COMPELLS ME OTHERWISE
I WONT GIVE IN
im giving it my all
and then. `all the final exams`
- the remaining trig work online to finish off casually, `also on the final exam`
- another programming project due later for another class and labs to catch up on that are also related to the final exam
- a programming project with some people that has to be done by saturday and has to be coordinated with everyone in order to work, that is directly related to the final we have that is literally redoing that project from scratch in real time
ive got:
and this is just the beginning, too
and yeah
`The academic ouroboros forever eating itself forever...`
and finals that are the project itself, repeated
which will be like... in a week. right now it's `Torture Time` because finals, and projects, and projects directly related to the final
during the summer ill figure out the logistics of it with the staff and see if we can get the ball rolling
hella
this looks like something you'd still need a host to help stream from though
im looking through it now
once i am free from the shackles of school...
yeah well come thrusday its gonna be helped so hard

As a result, the older server goes by the name 'valkryie server' now, it's discord invite still public
<@447809449399418881> a while back the person who runs the subreddit, Alice, migrated the subreddit aspect of the server you're looking for into a new server, the one you're in right now, for the sake of it being more congruent to the subreddit rules

Yes
Like email verified?
are you registered with discord? ie have a proper account?

This?

it shows up explicitly as 'expired'?
Not sure how long it takes to refresh

which is godawful and makes me very sad.
because they decided to kill off css in favor for contained css tidbits
mainly because i havent put much muscle in the new reddit theme stuff since it sorta sucks
`that one needs work`
oh wait you mean the New Reddit theme
i think we may have swapped urls for a new one
the current subreddit button leads to the https://discordapp.com/invite/ewvbjUj invite
hmmmm
i will take this up with staff, one moment
what do you mean? the main subreddit is working just fine, i think
also we had to kill a shitload of invites due to bots
welcome
Oh shit welcome!
welcome
***hell yeah***
if you do feel free to showcase it here, we'll gladly show it off
in that case, a very warm welcome!
shit
`and one of the people who hosts it is here?`
wait, there's a symphocast?

I'm pretty excited because it being described by a friend I went "let me guess the downside is that there's tons on cgi"
I'm starting this series soon

ah shit i confused them
`is that pyralsprite i see`
_gives a big grin at kriisa_
`Such raw power...`

Yep

I’m part of a monsterverse rp server, and we make our own OC kaiju and rp with them. I made a kaiju based of Dr. Ver.
I drew a kaiju based off of a combination of Shirabe and Kirikas G gear outfits.
Yep
Marianne

It’s from the perspective of King Ghidorah
If you couldn’t tell
We fought, and I won. I felt good, so good...Until he showed up again. I was losing badly, and I wondered if I was going to die here. But something saved me. I don’t know what, but in those few seconds...I emerged as the victor. I had finally won. And with that nuisance gone, I was the king. I was the one with the power. No longer would I be obstructed by that being...or so I thought. He showed up again. Why? Why wouldn’t the damn thing stay dead? We fought. As always, he was winning. It got worse for me. The angel showed up, and trapped me again. I was at the mercy of the king and angel. But I had a trick up my sleeve. The demon, you remember him? I got him to my side, and sent him to kill the angel. He proved a well enough distraction while I settled things with the being who had plagued me for so long. I got the upper hand, and I made him fall to his knees. I shamed him, and now he was at my mercy. I was going to kill him, but that angel! The angel stopped me from killing him! My Chance was ruined! And oh, I wish the demon could have killed her, but alas, it was not to be. Now comes that part where I become fragmented. The being, he cane back stronger than ever. His presence made me feel more scared than in my entire life. He nearly killed me, and I was at his mercy...and I still am. I’m about to die to his hands, right here, right now. He’s going to kill me, and I can’t do anything about it. Now you know why I’m here, fragmented and about to die to a being who I’ve hated my whole life simply because he was better than me.
I wrote a really long poem last night 
I’m about to die. I bet you don’t know why. But I’ll explain it to you. Here I am, bleeding out and almost dead. A mere fragment of what I once was. Now hold up. Let me show you how I’m in this situation. Lets go back to a time long before now. 
I came here looking for conquest. Something to rule. Something I could control. But I had opposition. A being of raw strength and prowess. A being who conveyed a sense of awe and power. A king. A true king. And I hated him. Why? He made me feel small. Insignificant. Like a pebble next to a Boulder. He was smaller than me in stature, but his presence was bigger than mine. So I sought to get rid of him. Then I would be the one everyone would turn too. I would be king. 
And yet, I couldn’t beat him. His allies kept showing up whenever I had the upper hand. He never lost to me. Not once. My hatred for him only grew stronger. And one day, he trapped me in an prison that I couldn’t escape. All I remember was being pushed by that damned thing into a crater, and then...I was trapped. Millions of years passed, and I couldn’t feel a thing. The only thing I ever felt was a thirst for revenge.
And then I was free. Somehow, some way, I was free. Free to roam and go about without any sort of hindrance! But then again, that being...I couldn’t wait to fight him again, and show him who the true king was! And that opportunity showed itself. He showed up, and we fought. I had the upper hand most of the time we fought. And yet, I couldn’t shake the feeling one of his allies was going to show up and ruin everything. Perhaps the angel? Maybe the demon. But I ran. I ran away, like a coward. I regretted that decision as a ran far far away. Until I found someone. The demon himself.
Redesign of a friends dragon

It’s the first day of monster march-and  since I’m partaking in a drawing challenge each day, Godzilla is first up!

A crazy redesign of Godzilla

<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>

GHIDORAH WHEEL- March 4th

Mothra- March 3rd

Yes
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Other than the chest area, I’m very proud of this drawing.

Ooooo
That’s really cute
Awww
I wrote a battle between Eva-unit 01 from neon genesis evangelion and Kiryu from Godzilla

Yes please
Niceu niceu
https://tenor.com/view/feed-me-goodbye-bruno-bucciarati-jo-jos-bizarre-arriverderci-gif-15008229
Bruno blitzes and has dura neg so
Do you agree with the verdict and the reasons?
Thx
It’s not that good
This was my first DB script so
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HC3xFg3anCUufG16Nnu6XyXcHdo3yqtjyRD-dVuk10c/edit
Does Bruno Bucciarati vs Blake Belladonna pique your interest?
And a few DB scripts
I have a ton of DBX scripts
Well
You wanna read one of my scripts?
Lol
Nice
I keep them all on google docs tho
I don’t upload my stuff to any site
I wrote this, actually
Mista dies lol
As for my Chris MU
I want to say Ragna, but Chris’s AP is ridiculous
I’m torn
And oh god
Kamen rider ftw
Edelgard ftw
Ded Ruby in her MU
Nice
Noob Saibot wins this one
Lemao
Byleth wins imo, even tho Jotaro blitzes

I made that
Jotaro vs Byleth
Oh nice
Hmm
I like that idea~
Cloud vs Basa eh? I’ll take that into account
Niiiiiice
Giorno with regular GE beats Yang, Polnareff takes Weiss down, and I’ve heard arguments for both Lilac and Jake, so I’m kinda undecided atm

No, Giorno blitzes. Dialga is basically a Pokemon god tho so
Dialga wins against Giorno with GER imo



I have a lot more thumbnails if you want to see~
Nope

Wanna see some of mine?
I do like those
🤔
Context is for the weak.
that is...terrifying
Thats interesting
oh?
Alternative to gravity beams yes?
That’s cool
thats cool
the very conception of a venus flytrap ghidorah fascinates me
nice
the last resort ability of the Zillasaurus is quite unique
i definetely like both
I'd suggest 12,000 tons for Zillasaurus rex, and 20,000 for the Venus ghidorah
Because, kaiju are infamous for having ungodly heavy weights
Same with the Venus ghidorah, bump up the weights a lot then you'll be golden
Aside from that, I really like it
First off, i'd like to say that the Zillasaurus Rex is super light weight
ight
damb, Venus flytrap ghidorah?
lol
i find it interesting that it breathes fire
dang, thats cool

Grand king, yes.

I can see why
eh, not really

Theres also the nuclear pulse, which MV sure won't like.
Ehh....it depends if MV can get up close fast enough before getting knocked out by Heisei's beam spam.
i have done enough lol, i've witnessed a very heated Showa Ghidorah vs MV Ghidorah debate once lol
Honestly though, I highly doubt Showa ghid is that strong, his gravity beams an other abilities aren't too impressive.
wheres the source for that
doubt
> Showa ghidorah is more powerful than MV Ghidorah
technically both can one-shot the other, but Yoko has wayyyyyyy better AP and means of yeeting sniper so
FR tho, yoko slaps
yes



Ye, Velvet Crowe



alrighty then
I wonder if I can post my non-symphogear related stuff here....I usually post my symphogear stuff in fancontent but i think the non-symphogear stuff can go here?
i mean, there *was* a scrapped heisei era movie about Varan basically being the devil lol
i find it quite bizarre, frog rodans aren't something i'd ever have considered.
Ah, nice.
FW Kumonga is fodder lol
I’d say yours would win
Hmmm
Definitely cool
Nice
I don't see any problem
i am definitely downloading these <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

Wait, how is this nsfw
***CAPE***
CAPE
Looking at this all I can say is that I can imagine kanade inheriting genjuros sense of humor
hehe
i feel proud, if not slightly confused
did you actually make that screenshot i gave into an emoji
"It's okay. I'd stare too."

CHOSSEI!
that fact still saddens me to this day.
chris would be so different if genjuro had the opportunity to raise her
"when fine isnt home in the afterlife"
when autoscorers were cool
the good old days
That's still probably the best kanade fan work ever made

That outfit swap is ***killer***

i cant imagine a maria without pink hair
blonde hair maria makes cultural sense but still feels horrendously wrong
no sunshine
SHE'S NOT DEAD
and his arm is just... pulsating
and his eyes look so lifeless
and wrong
it feels gross
What is up with that ver sprite
Hold the fucking phone
gosh, they really are expressing so much `FRIENDSHIP` here, they're such good `FRIENDS`, doing `FRIENDSHIP` activities

Fuck me that saint germain

a lot of wild anime hairstyles can be attributed to not combing or hairbrushing

`madoka started hitting on hibiki and homura got pissed`

hibiki punches time
homura stops time

it was anime looney tunes in the best way
yeah that was a genuinely funny show
`I CANT BELIEVE HE CAN PULL OFF THE FUCKING LOOK`

i feel the biggest flaw here is that with dmjii now technically being related to each other, you get into a very Citrus situation of `sisters falling in love`

that is a shame.

she learned from the best

`she was trying to befriend me`
i didnt
and that i made her unkillable and hostile and she hunted me down like a fucking animal
casual reminder that hibiki tachibana exists as an npc model in gmod
`In her heart...`
but it didnt matter because hibiki punched her where it counts
tsubasa only managed to beat her by using her swan song and once hibiki utilized martial arts against someone who only used whips, she basically shed her nehushtan for her `Phase 2` form and essentially crushed her
chris has honestly been the most effective antagonist thats been recruited so far; everyone else was defeated, but chris took a long while to be beaten in something that wasnt even fully encompassing her true talents
but also has such an acute knowledge of trig on the fucking fly that she can snipe from a massive range with them
she can not only ride them
`I have yet to see man outrun bullet.`
in the wise words of heavy...
chris is honestly the most dangerous of them
she doesnt need to run much when she's sporting `so many fucking guns`
the gag is less her being weak and more constantly relying more on upper body strength than lower

I kinda imagined mixing it being akimbo to it having a split personality

so yeah
when thinking up some of those gun girls, I kinda ended up taking into account a lot of what Ahoy had to say because he brings a lot of context and history to that gun
it's 100% kirito free afaik
did you at least give it a chance?
the SAO spin-off

https://twitter.com/Thiago_YH/status/1005203311576932353
never finished watched Soul, only finished Qwaser years later
before that
beside the anime that aired on TV (that I didn't tell apart from western cartoons yet) I had stumbled upon Death Note, Dokuro-chan, Soul Eater and... Qwaser (on the pinnacle of my innocence, I swear)
yeah
up until high school, I was all about games
so during the months between HS and college I remembered an anime a friend mentioned some time ago about people stuck on a game
and early into the first college term, overheard some classmates talk about a currently airing anime about a world where all clashes are settled with games
late 90s here
didn't even fall into anime hell until college, lol
`AND IT MOOOOOOOOVES US ALLLLLLLLLLL`
`It's the CIIIIIIIIIRCLE OF LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFE`
i am amused at how something that was posted in fancontent gets shared around in twitter and then shared back in here
didnt have a 3ds
couldnt
the thing i love most about risky is how they slowly made her more competent and more dangerous over time
`I'll dance on your runny innards!`
even the original gameboy color game
ive played every shantae game
i played half genie hero and honestly i felt it was better than pirates curse, though i DID love pirates curse

i learned my lesson throwing away euryale
...where the hell did i get euryale
...
i vividly remember getting her from it
no, euryale was definitely okeanos
nero
and then a roll later with the tickets for the anniversary, very first ticket
then i got euryale back
i ripped her in two because i didnt like her with the whole shitting on medusa bit, `since i have medusa`, and my luck tanked for servants ever since
she is for na for okeanos
my luck came back when i got a euryale `after i threw away the story-given one 'cause i was angry`
up until now my luck has purely been on rare ce's with no golden servants beyond what was given to me and my first roll
my luck is strange
interesting
i guess i mean a higher ratio of rarer servants/ce's
does jp have more luck than na
Want to save it but I'm on mobile

i think fate doesnt get a remake because studio deen ruined it
though the heavens feel movies are coming out
its complicated
pretty much
rin tohsaka is an example of an interesting and well written character getting crushed under the weight of raw fanboy boner

BUT ITS CAPE SO I AUTOMATICALLY LOVE IT
I wont lie this sorta borders on lingerie
***IGNITE CAPE***
IGNITE CAPE
WHAT
What
my advice is to avoid the outlining on the bottom part of the eyes; itll help make the eyelining at the top look very distinctive
its like she was more of a marshmellow fluff
the small chibi aesthetic is very soft and huggable
i love it though
its not like an aggressive sadness. its very pensive. its like "damn, i missed out on that one."
she looks like she spilled her favorite bowl of oatmeal but everyone went to get her another one but she's really thinking about the first bowl

oh right!
yes <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>



Can't translate Tsubasa's part I'd love some help.




oh my bad

some more
P1: 
Chris: What's going on?
Kirika: So this part should be like this 
Shirabe: Oh, yeah that's good 

P2: 
Deeeeeeeeesu 
(The sign says some shit about how they're coming up with the ultimate attack to defeat the Nosie) 

P3: 
De...su...

P4: 
Shirabe
Wait if we kind of do it like a pair of scissors, it'll be way more cool

Kirika: Oh and after let's make a ufo noise come out

Chris: (Being a retard)
Prob reference to GX ending
https://twitter.com/runawate56/status/1134810885774462976
some translation for the Kirika x Shirabe fanart:  It's essentially the artist having a "Akatsuki is kyooot and Shirabe makes a cute couple" circlejerk. He mentions how they wear matching uniforms, and even when they dont they wear matching socks. 
Shirabe drinks black coffee, and Kiriha wants to be mature like her so she tries it but can't do it (because she's a fuckin' dork).
Niceeeee
Which gundam is that
Cool one
Oh that's fine too
"this is fine"
Chris and tsubasa expressions are hilarious
lots of Madoka spoiler btw
<:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
hmm who could possibly steal bikki's pantsu

great cosplay
BlackRockShooter and Sympho collab would be really cool
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
a Symphogear fighting game would be so dope, even better if they can make it similar to ArcSystem games
Hibiki model is pretty cool
that Mitsuboshi art gave me a chuckle
the rest is quite spot on. The artist didn't get to eat good stuff when he was little so he find Chris who just eats anything offered to her cute
「餌付けされるクリスちゃん」basically means that the "wild animal Chris is getting fed" so thats why google translate was awkward about it
can also be Tsubasa and Bikki <:GWvictoriaNotLikeBlob:384871121893195776>
based on the text colors
I assume Shirabe is giving her a lollipop while Kirika is angry that someone is eating her candy (or shirabe is feeding someone else)
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
oh I know it's nsfw but it fits the conversation so I just posted here, with proper spoiler tag <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
there is this nice pic of bunnygirl Chris only available on twitter with shoddy quality [NSFW]
sometimes they don't upload everything from twitter to Pixiv tho <:GWnoneMeguDed:384871020735102978>
I need to check out the artists' Pixiv for better quality
pictures seem to be compressed when uploaded to twitter right?
😎
maybe it's a running gag at this point but Miku is superman in disguise
that group marathon pic is hilarious, poor Maria getting blasted. Miku despite having no gear is leading <:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>

some alt outfits from Xdu that make everyone a pirate are really cool
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
also the screenshot of Chris best girl, was that s3?
can u post some s2 or s3 dress Chris
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
I find it funny how Chris has her forever alone folder while other girls have their couple folders
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>

that artist is awesome, lots of Akane art

OOF

As much as I love Kiri, Maria my best girl
And I thought that JoJo was hit hard by North American copyrighting
this will be fun
oh yeah, there was supposed to be an abridged series uploading soon
Copyright is fun oh boy

GET TO DA CHOPPA
I also tried to look for it on Imgur but it said it doesn't exist.
Its blurry.
Just checked Pixiv. Could not find it under Shem Ha.
Me too. I will have to find it.
Hopefully he's not frozen in Carbonite.
Basically, Hibiki gets possessed then Miku saves Hibiki by the using the Shenshoujing Faust robe to erase both relics and purge Shem Ha from Hibiki's Body.
I think what would happen is something similar to Solo's Fic.
Oh wait.
I know what AU Miku is like, but if there was an opposite version of Miku, what would she be like.
Welcome to opposite world, where everyone is an opposite version of our main casts and yet at the same time, are the same.
In any world, Chris is a badass.
Yeah, I don't want to get the shit beaten out of me multiple times. So I think she can look after herself.

just as good
_miku!!!!_
in that exact shape
unless you had a real scar

normally i'd be the one to say that but in the case of cosplays i don't think you could make it look.... good

~~shirabe and miku get tired of their partners being oblivious so they do a double date but this ends up being the worst idea because hibiki and kirika just goof off together and don't pay attention to them. tsubasa thought she was being left out of a mission and the other two knew what was going on and decided to stalk them~~
love the difference between pre-season 1 tsubasa just going "ooh" and everyone else flicking her harder than she gets hit in some battles

i mean he _is_ genjuro's dad
fudo is immortal. he was born in 1329
oh right
i think that was their explanation for why he specifically wanted noble red instead of having his own team fight against the gears

i think it was made by vanessa
i think fudo had the faust robe made
no i think she did

miku's was already posted
serena going back to her home planet
~~also it references chris x miku _and_ has nehushtan chris so it's fantastic~~
i love the chris one too
the kanade cycle of going from feral to dust
the tsubasa cycle of going from gay to gay
track miku, mikugear, hot goth shemiku-ha, faust robe shemiku-ha, wedding faust robe miku, hibimiku
this is one of my favourite miku arts. it's literally everything
i mean i do like miku's cool vr helmet but i vastly prefer her faust robe anyway
TRUE
THE AMALGAM DESIGNS ARE SO GOOD MIKU NEEDS ONE
yo is that my favourite playstation all-stars battle royale character cole? or is it my second-favourite playstation all-stars battle royale character evil cole?

yo this is so cool
they're both rpgs developed by square enix with character designs by and heavy influence from tetsuya nomura featuring spiky, light-haired swordboys who float around and have at least one sidekick who is infinitely cooler than they could ever hope of being
still the fact that she uses 10th tier spells might not be
ah
i also don't know much about zetsumei since the tl'd light novels haven't really dealt with her much but she also definitely knows of yggdrasil so she probably also knows of some way to revive people. also i think the mobile game gave her 10th tier spells like time stop so she's clearly powerful
they keep making a point to say that ainz doesn't know everything about the world he's in so i have a feeling there's definitely a way
when was her fight
i do like that maruyama said something about wanting to end the light novel series soonish but he still has no idea what to do with clementine, who is one of the most popular characters and he set up for a return like.... 11 novels ago?
https://t.co/KtAOo7sWkP
apparently it's escaping nazarick if that new game is anything to go by

that's an awful idea because elfnein would somehow figure out a way to use lego to bring back carol

honestly seeing these arts back-to-back i think blue (periwinkle?) works better for kirika than green. at least in terms of a full outfit

hibiki has two portrait poses in the game. one of them is that goofy cheer thing in the image and the other is basically the edgebikki pose fsr
https://youtu.be/rI3yD3WAcz4
lemme see if i can find it
there was a video i saw about that a few months ago but it's wild how some guy is basically just trying to claim his company made caramelldansen despite... not
caramelldansen is such a weird meme because its based on an eroge and the song's origins are trying to be obscured by some random company
i love seeing shemiku-ha in miku's casual outfits <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>

~~they should have had hibiki learn that ||miku was "killed"|| in the middle of a battle and then had her go berserk~~
hate that they got rid of the berserk states because they were rad

she still bullies hibiki though. but out of friendship
chris the schoolyard bully but only because fine is her mom and tells her to be an asshole

the vampire slayer
buffki
and to tie it back to symphogear: they should do a symphozombie spin-off. bring back all the villains ~~+ kanade and serena~~ from the dead and have them be zombies. and also millaarc is there but since vampires are undead already i think she's just like "fuck dude this is weird"
true!
i feel like we probably should have moved to <#337805317276565525> at some point but who cares lol
you should do der eisendrache's because you get to blow up moon
i'm not doing that dumb shoot the random specific rock step lol

you mean you didn't follow gersch around and shoot at him??????
<:FujitakaSalute:688199574917087256>
i'm the opposite lol
i wonder what it's like to be good at zombies. me and my friend did a couple of bo3 easter eggs by me doing basically everything a guide told me to and him keeping one zombie alive
moon is a really cool map concept but man is it a map i do not want to play lol
nope
no problemo. nothing to worry about
yeah! it's right there!

st patrick's day was a few months ago bikki
she would go for an excuse to have hot chocolate and/or if shirabe (and/or maria) wanted to go
for two characters with essentially identical designs, it's incredible how edgebikki looks off in bright colours just because of her more pointed eye shape and expression

yes this image is cool
i mean technically but they are different enough that i think you could treat them more as sisters?
for characters with basically the same appearance, there's something odd about seeing edgebikki in og bikki clothes

oh i think that might just be the colour scheme playing tricks?
edgebikki's eyes are more pointed and og bikki's are more round
they have different eye shapes yeah

Inb4 Symphogear turns into God Of War
I think they're already facing the three "remnants" in ep 1's fight
btw anyone figured out what the backing vocals are saying in METANOIA?
Vitalization has them too
aka OW
no, I mean
if Kimi dake ni shows just how accepting Hibiki is
that was what I thought it implied
```She truly is such an accepting person...```
could that mean Miku does something almost irredeemable in XV?
https://twitter.com/zoid9000/status/1139727285844467714
The final trailer for XV should come around 1 or 2 weeks before airing
XV OP? july 17th
Then if I haven't slept for two nights then it's June 20 71:35?
I'm expecting a third song with the full activation chant/super song melody in XV, this time finally with Kanade, Serena and Miku properly singing their respective lines.
And if as the lyrics we finally get the translation of the original semi-gibberish that would just be the best.
the Devilman video
But the one anime they're pushing this season is very much Abandoned Sacred Beasts
And like, coordinating with Gigguk to do a "Symphogear in X minutes" on the first 4 seasons
Just wishful thinking actually
Yeah
I'm kinda counting on someone in their staff really believing in XV being a big thing this season
It'd also be cool if Crunchyroll surprise-announced AXZ and XV
[YT] can take their time <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I can't believe I set up this countdown 16 months ago
(oh wait, that's not Shirabe, it's fripSide)
heh
i can almost hear it
it's so close
Ooh imagine if the enemy crashes Chris's birthday party and it gets used as a battle song.
||two pipes||?
||as I said, didn't watch it myself, just read tweets about it||
ep 1 song details above
||>ALL LOVES BLAZING plays first||
||>all 6 sing the group song, Rokka Ryouran||
||>ep 1 ED is FINAL COMMANDER by Nana||
oh, it's pipes
--test--
||test||
that is from reading some tweets from who actually went to the screening, I didn't myself lol
oh yeah, we have spoiler markdown now
earlier today/yesterday
are we talking screening spoilers/rumors here?
>oh, I avoided anything regarding XV
This doesn't seem like the best channel to do that...
first time on this channel?
>fist one
Nice
Only 167 hours remaining <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Note the "did you mean", which gives the correct translation.
Works for me.
Maybe it adapted after you used it to translate too much hentai?

featuring some of the VAs
a screening
||FINAL COMMANDER's lyricist is Shihori, same as Glorious Break||
btw, personal expectation
||is for Rokka Ryouran to be, just like Axia's second half, its own unique melody||
japan probably takes the "don't film screenings" more seriously than anywhere else
Filming is prohibited
ok
It also says no date for AXZ yet
I see
The simulcast will air 2h after TV, btw
I don't remember GX that well, but iirc they only started simulcast on ep6?
16:00 GMT
Yup
It's not fully automatic. I think they have to at least set up a timer for each show, since I know they fucked up a few times.
Then it's free
AXZ will for 1 week
Two more sleeps
I still need to get my first <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Maybe they didn't plan it out that well
But XV was planned as a sequel of AXZ more than anything before, so yeah
They could release it earlier if they did away with that
They have that thing where the trailer recaps prev season's main fights while the Aufwachen intro plays out
(talking Japan time now)
It wouldn't be at 18:05, that would just be Chris' single cover and Aoi's drawing for the countdown
But after they release AXZ 13 at 21:00, it's free real estate
```Bit sad we didn’t get a bigger trailer```
My bet is that they didn't drop it yet because it'd spoil the official rewatch
btw, if anyone still had any doubt https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/status/1146509381195878400
in Jalter's place it'd be Chris saying fuck in front of Hibiki
it'll air on CR pt at 3pm BRT
so probably also 11am PST
```oh seems like what got posted was for portuguese speaking regions only```
well, what goes for pt speaking regions might happen at the same time or even before on english speaking regions
25:00 is useful since it's easy to convert into times in the rest of the world.
Welp
Where's the long trailer, thoooooo
Futurism has the best "Aufwachen" out of the EDs imho
qooapp
they know they're trolling us
It's even shown (not fired) in the XDU opening
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
soonTM
6 hours until airing!
8 hours until simulcast!
No more sleeps left!
was catching up to the chat to post exactly this, yeah
but ||isn't Miku going to be the last boss, or at least the one Hibiki fights while singing Kimi dake ni?||

Theories for GGGFA before the keyword comes out?
I'd go as far as to say she pulls off the greatest feats when she doesn't know what's happening.
When did that ever stop Hibiki?
No, the German lyrics are the translation of the first part of the Japanese lyrics.
as well as the countdown
don't worry, AXZ also forgot about the phases
I like Jojo but dislike its ironic meme fanbase, where does that put me?
`like dude, there are no jojo references at all`
So you're saying ORAORAORAORAORA is a reference even older than Jojo?
Airgetlahm is a left gauntlet. Enki had a right gauntlet.

That's only in the subs, no?
I wonder why they changed it from the half-sensical name of S1 into complete gibberish later.
Which Crunchy changes into parodies.
Jojo also never got sued and it's chock full of music references.
thanks for reminding me that this video exists

The gears can compensate and increase skills but the user has to have some level of proficiency.
they can't exactly go on autopilot
time to rewatch G
`In season 5, they will befall numerous dreadful and sad events that ordinary humans would be unable to overcome.` - Yuuki Aoi
Imagine if it's ep 13 ED
Has both songs
There's this: https://www.bilibili.com/video/av58453960
3.5 is confirmed canon
The dimensional shenanigans are almost certainly non-canon
But Hibiki should sing it in-character.
I find each Hibiki A-song to be better than the last one
but G-Beat is iconic
Rokka Ryouran won't until october
All Loves Blazing is out tomorrow/today
The same thing happened in G
It's yet another instance of "the only person who can legitimately save the world turns out to be totally evil so the protagonist has to asspull something".
Where does "I want to conquer humanity and make them my slaves and at the same time protect them from the gods who want to kill them" fall on the evil scale?
Looks like I've got a manga to read.
The what now?
Or maybe ||end credits is the HibiMiku Flugel from the manga||
>anitubers
I first thought of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_yOt5NfcMA since I didn't remember it exactly.
This channel gives zero fucks to King, it seems
they uploaded All Loves Blazing, Kimi Dake Ni, Lasting Song, and the full ep 1
>kissanime
Oh shit I found it, now I'm conflicted whether to listen to Kirika's song or wait for the episode.
to me it sounded like it had come from either an aired preview or some insider leak
but yeah
either King or Bushiroad are calling Exterminatus on this one
Didn't open ep 1 and Kimi dake ni as I had already watched/listened to them, but when I saw Kirika curiosity got the best of me :v
YT kept recommending me its videos
sorry, won't do again
(powered by everyone)
Not the real meat.
That's typical visual novel prologue stuff
Steins;Gate is a sci-fi thriller
Symphogear is cute girls doing badass things while singing
Do you think remaking S1 has crossed their minds at least once?
```I think Symphogear as a franchise might take a break here```
I think so
during Live 2020
what will they announce at the encore?
something that just came to mind
It's a wild arms reference
Ayahime said in Live 2018 that "exiv" did sound like a sneeze
so when do we talk about Chris's sneeze
that'd go against what Nana meant with Metanoia: "live your own life"
it's weird because then we can assume before balal any lulu amel could wear the bracelet
talking about scorpion
the metallic shell the scorpion enters at the end of the OP
what are we assuming it is? airgetlahm?
after what happened
we'll for sure see Tsubasa a lot closer to laying down her life in battle
so...
was the happy mood OST with bagpipe used when Chris met Bikki x miku used in previous seasons?
I wonder if there will be a longer version of Kirika henshin on BD, lewder too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
<:GWsiraSataniaHAhaa:398886125873135616>
those golden fists look like they come from her scarf
rather than full upgrade I like how each girl develops more ways to use their gear, like Chris has more types of guns, Kirika splits her scythe into 2 smol ones like Death from darksiders
I see, thx ahiijny
and she has some other versions of it in the case
is our new wolfgirl's weapon a buttplug with tail?
was Maria talking about G ending?
the combo move they did was cool tho I thought Kirika would've hit the yoyo back like a baseball there
it was Kirika henshin but majority of the fight was actually Shirabe and later Tsubasa this ep
Chris when :
with handcuffs n shit
she started that pole dancing in AXZ but here it's a lot lewder
not sure what was the seal thing our vampire did
poledancing, handcuffs, leg cuffs <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
the thigh highs little pinch <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I can't find the bagpipe ost track, anyone knows the name of the song? <:GWvictoriaNotLikeBlob:384871121893195776>

Don't worry, Kaneko doesn't know either.
What's the common theme for maria henshin, I hope cape is back
The first symphogirl will have the last henshin, cool
I wonder if Chris will do the Bang thing
I have watched kirika henshin like 6 times already, it's just too gud
But that would be more risky, more expensive, all the new girls would have to get their turn on the lives, and a million other problems.
Did they release the cards without the story or was there another similar event?
(that's how I get to like Mikoto Yamaguchi's manga, or the Underworld movies)
I think I've managed to detach my enjoyment from my critical thinking

btw
if Mijuku Shoujo Buttagiri played in ep2
and we still didn't see Shirabe's henshin
next episode might already be the Zababa duet
(some memed about how Area 51 is just evil, american SONG, but FIS was exactly that to Div2)
that Area 51 and the FIS institute are basically one and the same
I think Zoid pointed it out on Twitter
not exactly a baddy, but a Dragon run amok that ends up being the final boss
*yes*
well, either him or the remnants will look for a vessel for the divine power (maybe they're allied as some have theorized)
oh, you mean ||Miku||? 🙃
has anyone discussed this yet?
Tsubasa is not only the last one to sing, but only in ep 8.
that'll probably be the climax of her arc in this season
the choir sample in the A-track is 👌
I prefer to see the keywords as a cool extra, not as something necessary for stuff to make sense
Some organization of concerned mothers would sue the shit out of them.
They could never be advertised anywhere.
it's just a "random super cool religious reference"
301 million or whatever is the number of angels as calculated by some ancient theologists
The show is clearly biased towards the thing it's named after.
Nehushtan was a complete relic and it was shit. The gears could tank more than it could regenerate.
But kimi dake ni and the birthday song are really interesting
ALL LOVES BLAZING was kinda cool but MAPPUTATSU is literally "Kirika song 4.0"
So far the both B sides were a lot more interesting than the A sides.
It had low lows and high highs, but it's symphogear so awesomeness is par for the course and only remember the bad shit.
Mostly what it did to Hibiki
Hey, at least it can't be worse than GX.
I'm <:Ver:336656981144109066> and <:MariaYell:336657352264646657> at the same time rn

Yeah the keyword says "involuntary muscle movement yadda yadda sometimes it can sound like something unintended"
I heard something about the wedding dresses being like heroin so it would explain the bikkilust and them scrubbing it from all records would explain why I can't find it.
Maybe it's from the recalled wedding dress event? I joined after it.
That's odd, I can't find the HIBIKIHIBIKIHIBIKIHIBKIHIBIKI clip in my data dump
Dunno if there's a better way
VGMToolbox to extract ACB into HCA and then some random program I pulled from a google search to decrypt the HCA into WAV

Oh, that's interesting, I never really dove into those files too much.
How about you check?
Trash... Huh?
I wonder if the android/robot villain girl is the same as adam
are all henshins this season the same length <:GWchinaSakuraThinking:398950680217255977>
how long is the whole sequence
yea a bit slower would be nice
but the ribbons + closeup on her booty are way too fast for me
I feel like her henshin has too much going on, the boob reload referencing grenadier was cool
lmao
Chris finally gets to use her sniper rifle
<:GWsiraSataniaHAhaa:398886125873135616>
guess she's out of blood
ye last ep Mill was really intimidating
best Shirabe henshin so far
2 henshin in 1 ep were a pleasant surprise
our villains seem to be real jobbers
this ep was a real treat, both ChrisxBikki and shira x Kirika fights are great
the segway Noises are so funny
the part they gave them the suitcase and noticed the bikers
so our new topdad just treats the remnant alchemists as expendable ?
yea
I think it's more effective against tsubasa due to the trauma she has
or would it have some long term effects <:GWchinaSakuraThinking:398950680217255977>
so millarc's charm/eye power only renders the opponent immobilized or comatose
but we prob have an even bigger topdad
they briefly mentioned topdad
well I suppose elf can just fix her up enough to use as a tool <:GWsiraSataniaHAhaa:398886125873135616>
well tikki is somewhat of a device to help fighting against gods
well they hinted her iirc
maybe elf can do smth about it
btw tikki is still not fully destroyed right
they are not as skilled as carole or the Germain gang
I can see that
Vanessa's theme is so majestic
need to see more of our catgirl, shes been a jobber since debut
so far I like millarc best, her wings are so versatile forming a ball to reduce impact, hand and leg gears and so on
I see
damn, really give us enough time to appreciate all the details
if u believe hard enough all the famous dudes become waifu
oh yea <:GWsiraSataniaHAhaa:398886125873135616>
which character(s) in Fate btw? I'm only familiar with zero and stay night
have u ever seen similar powers in other fictions that don't feel like bullshit <:GWchinaSakuraThinking:398950680217255977>
<:GWsiraSataniaHAhaa:398886125873135616>
what do they call it, together with the swordbreaking doll, philosophical power?
was a huge disappointment
the big underwater monster back in GX
mikugear was dope, too bad it was destroyed
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
its perfect for binge but prob a real suffering exp weekly
early seasons also have cliffhanger at the end of every ep
"mind flay" is just the ruby text, the cool name they gave it. The description was something like "mental abrasion".
And FSN Fake Assassin didn't even exist out of legend
It's like I've gone 47.5 hours back in time.
I feel deja vu
I did a shitty stereo sync of the DMJii youtube previews: https://files.catbox.moe/64dmlm.mp3
what is the primary color of Maria
🍡
dango team eating dango
I know dango but didn't know they come in those 3 specific colors
I feel like Neopolitan was the best localization they could make
`Hitler wasn't actually evil, he was doing it for the interest of Germany`
Not seeing one here.
Yes I do want to see a good meme.
Or series composition was really changed and Basa will sing in ep9 now
So either airing will skip one week because of some event
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1156784630231633921?s=19
Tsubasa's single delayed by one week
I occasionally saw the friend that got me into Symphogear hyping stuff like Live 2016
like, I had caught up to Symphogear when GX was airing, and when it ended I didn't go into hiatus mode
>the sword
>the blue sympho
```did she even have an arc in AXZ```
hell, i had some trouble remembering her name when AXZ was airing
Sorry for extending the topic in the wrong channel
```tbf, there are zero male opponents Nanoha deals with?```

There's ||Detonation's true villain||, that's also the only irredeemable one I've seen in this series (didn't watch StrikerS and ViVid yet)
nah, Miku still going to become a vessel for the divine power
when that happens they're gonna update this part of the OP

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwVZgs2pAaY
looking like Death from Darksiders
I really like when she dualwields her scythes
yesss
that was so sweet
also Kirika has that sickle +chain + big ninja star
I was a bit disappointed when Carole grew <:GWsiraSataniaHAhaa:398886125873135616>

infintely
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>

I love Elf's gear/relic
finally watched it, this ep is quite a surprise <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>

Kirika on that CD is adorb
can u post it, lemme see if I can cut it up a bit

Summation: those dildos are genuinely...
But those dildos are extra insecure since you can't equip any security on it outside of the security protocol the network itself has
So really everything is 100% at risk until a new protocol comes out
I mean, not that it matters anyway, since wpa-2 has been cracked with an obscure backdoor nobody knew about up until now
But yeah, gotta be careful with that
clearly it's a dti (digitally transmitted infection)
The Internet of Things is currently one of the most insecure aspects of the Internet that exists out there and time and again those dildos have been cracked
- be used as a medium to hijack other local devices; anything else in the same network is at risk
- be used to directly sabotage or spy on you (reading network traffic, listening through microphones what you're saying, use hidden features on a device that may be shut off for good reason)
- be infected with maleware that can reach through your network and steal credentials via intercepting packet traffic or add your dildo to a malicious botnet
Anything that is compromised with Internet capability can have the following happen to it:
same with dildos with internet capability
those things have been hacked eleven ways to sunday
DONT GET STIMULATORS WITH INTERNET CAPABILITY BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE INSECURE BY DEFAULT

can i just whisper a secret to you
"A lot get education of sex through porn..."
"i mean... its a hole, so... i guess?"
"ah yes, this is where i stick it, yeah"
_eyes peehole_
also, `everyone sucks as sex because few places properly educate people in it`
nevermind
...oh, yes, its the same
i want to say the word is urethra but i dont know if the term is the same for men as it is for women since functionally theyre both the same but words are funny
'Where it turned out a guy was having sex with his wife via her piss-thingyword'
you do realize fetish bait is basically encouraging people to pursue the fetish, right? and yes
you wanted to have a serious conversation and now you're just saying what im telling you is projection
and its why i sorta snuff out those jokes. im sorta tired of them.
its, frankly, trash
this is something impossible for me to project given that im an only child, but its just fucked up that a show basically goes "yeah your relative is pretty hot, clearly you should go for it" and it gives idiot otakus the encouragement to seek it
its not projection
every damn one is basically "well, if they're hot, go for it"
personally i just hate incest tropes in anime because it gives a quick, easy, validating reason that reassures people to do things they themselves dont even understand the ramifications of
alright
`there are next to none`
if a show encourages a bad thing, and people use it to validate the bad thing, `it's trash`
yep, and the media they consume that goes with it only empowers them: do you get the point that is coming here
it sure is, and it sure embodies the point im trying to make here
like
and the otaku culture... deeply falls into the latter
it is, and it is a two way street. because you can sit there and complain that there are people who have complaints because they cant seperate a concept in fiction from reality, but there is also the other side of the coin who /do/ treat fiction as reality, and take it as their ticket to validate their behavior.
except people have shown to actively just conventiently label serious conversations to be had on something as SJWery to avoid talking about them, so where does it begin and where does it end?
you say that but then you say stuff like "Ugh, the SJW movement is the worst thing to happen in a long time" and then sorta prove to embody the very thing from keeping games back from not being considered childish
@ alice
yeah, true
the mainstream baking of the term nerd has not changed the nerd culture in the slightest, its only been made more inclusive
it is a very specific, /widespread/ circumstance
id put it akin to just cultural immersion
i feel a slope is a poor means to explain the effect of that chart, though
i think you explicitly ignored the part where that graph doesnt talk about learning it from video games, but from people who play video games and have only a grasp of the world through a lens of video games only
i will step out of the conversation and keep going with my work
which is especially annoying when you go "have a serious conversation" and then just basically not only not listen, but embody alice's points
because you are saying things and then immediately contradicting yourself, and then expecting people to have a serious conversation with you
as the saying goes, "if everywhere you go it smells like shit, you may want to check your own shoes"
id like to believe you, but you're being inconsistent with your own reasoning by using singular they right now, so i just feel its you just rationalizing your own behavior when being called out on it instead of owning up to it

there is a strong heterosexuality eminating from that dildo
So all things have genders
We don't have an "it"
Btw solo
Wouldn't half an A-press after the "at" be a neutral pronoun? <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Eles is both our masculine plural and neutral plural, but somehow Ele can't also be our neutral singular
Srsly
Elx is unpronounceable
Portuguese
Ele/Ela is He/She
Here, some queer folk asks us to use instead of ele or ela, *elx*
They feels comfy to use as neutral singular
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Their naming is uniform, too
So a name like mine (Thiago) wouldn't be allowed, only Tiago
But that is, in Brazil
No idea in Portugal, they probably call it Vapor as they translate *everything*
To this day we discuss whether Steam is a he or a she
yeah.
finals arent up to professors here.
i cant even focus on my study guide anymore.
ill give it a try when i see my counselor.
florida sure is swell.
great.
that means my recording is worthless

but its either that or the streets, and i live in miami
it doesnt
in fact, she explicitly owns said roof
i still share a roof with her.
what will that do
and im not calling from a landline
not without an address, unless they already have tools on hand for that
the 25 pound ones.
the recording basically admits that she has the right to beat her 23 year old son into a pulp if she so pleased without ramifications, and detailing how violently she'd do it with the weights in the room
she dropped it and gave up because shes impatient.
and i tried texting 911, but that service doesnt exist yet.
i recorded it all this time around too
AND I HAVE ALL THE INFINITE FREE TIME IN THE FUCKING WORLD
because god forbid that telling her id do it LITERALLY THREE DAYS FROM NOW when finals are OVER
which is a process that takes several hours due to moving things around and polishing the glass and wiping everything away
i slapped her hand away because my mom kept punching and pinching my arm because god forbid i didnt see the need to immediately drop ***the thing im studying for intently that i need to get a 70 in to pass the class /period/ with*** to thoroughly clean my desk
the reason?
i just spent the last 2 hours being threatened to e beaten an inch within my life while being purposefully held hostage in the very room i do my stuff in being prevented from studying
also, im not okay.
Plus I want to graduate first
Unlikely
not yet its not.
I sure am loved and appreciated in this household
Can't wait to be guilt tripped on how this is all my fault even though when I politely asked her if she was done and we could sleep she went "I don't care about that"
Sure is great being forced and emotionally manipulated to sleep on a shitty couch
They're my mom, so
Gotta love it when you tell said person and they just flat out don't care
Gotta love it when you gotta get up early for a test tomorrow
Gotta love it when you are explicitly told to go to sleep only to not sleep because the person who told you to refuses to fucking sleep
ibu right now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ6VY3ho0Ec
i fully intend to.
just in their own ways.
no, theyre both horrible
they thought i was going to graduate last fall
my parents agreed to divorcing after i graduated, my mom has prepared the divorce papers for it without my dad knowing.
yeah
i need to graduate. full stop.
my parents divorce is scheduled at my graduation.
thats not an option
i wont be allowed to get a job until i graduate. i graduate (hopefully) in the fall.
pretty much
i appreciate the feedback here but its not going to work out. i already know that i need to tough it out, get a job, and save up money to leave. the people ive spoken to in the past who would be interested in getting a roommate in this city want to make sure their roommate has a job.
so no. it wont work.
its their word against mine and they have colluded in the past to lie together to cover their tracks
its not uncommon.
they would on paper but they cant because they all live with their parents too
because there is high crime.
dont have any money.
its florida, there's no such thing.
because again. im a bit cornered.
and thats if my parents decide not to file me as a missing person and get me picked right up and sent right back to their house
i will not survive the nights in miami homeless.
i live in miami
pretty much.
yes.
friends cant take me in.
aint got no cash
aint got no car
then wait for me to crawl back to them
kick me out and leave me with literally nowhere to go
im aware
they wont let me have one.
ive got to tough it out until i have enough money saved up to dissappear.
but getting a one way ticket without money or a degree will not end well, when i have no connections at all
i know it is
but i have nowhere to go and rent is expensive in miami
no, and no
didnt even have the strength to cry today.
despite the fact that i have her tape recorded saying otherwise.
the car ride home was spent with my mom passively aggressively insinuating that i deserve it, and that she denied any and all allegations of preventing me from studying, or her actively saying and telling me she was purposefully obstructing me to make me fail
there's a potential chance i failed the final i took today
i would literally have to straight up not do the final exam to sabotage this
so now it is impossible to fail
the beauty is that my final replaces the lowest test grade i have, which is a 60
my final is tomorrow and i was super worried about it but seeing this all the edge has just melted away
_HIGH THE ***FUCK*** FIVE_
***I'M GOING TO FUCKING DO IT, AND THERE'S NO ONE ON THIS PLANET STRONG ENOUGH TO STOP ME.***

but
and... i was genuinely afraid that i couldnt do it
but now this semester im taking a math course thats a combination trig, algebra, and calc, in order to satisfy the last math requirements i have without taking more math classes
(ironically after i got the C- the semester afterwards they removed C- as a grade entirely)
first one i got a D. second one was a C-
ive failed trig twice in college. the first time because i was stupid enough to take a terrible class that was really short that lasted a session of 3 hours each class with a professor i could hardly understand, and then with a teacher who was very erratic with his teaching style
i think im gonna cry. this time its for a good thing though
im not working with law enforcement though
i dont even know if one exists
absolute fact.
okay
my dad is more deadbeat though i guess
my mom is sorta the same way
my dad is in his own little world but he is actively monitoring what i do
hard to say
i havent seen them for over ten years and they have no interest in even knowing that i breathe
they dont.
who they hate
they literally want nothing to do with me or my mother on virtue of coming from my mother
my dad's side is a bunch of rich snobs who actively wished for me to die upon my birth.
my mom's side is a bunch of drug addicts who actively harm each other and are infinitely worse than her
both.
and yeah.
yeah
but i wont really have anywhere to go otherwise
i dont really want to be with either of them
my dad says he's been apartment hunting
my mom is convinced she and i will go somewhere
i dont really know
i also know this.
and depends on the situation you're in
all of this varies with context
and if you're not an asshole, and you're surrounded by people who arent assholes, but when approached with new ideas or concepts proceed to react with assholeishness, you risk morphing into one
if you act like an asshole, and treat others while being an asshole, then you're stuck being an asshole
if you're surrounded by assholes, you're obviously either gonna be an asshole, or gonna be miserable with assholes, or will simply be percieved by others as an asshole in virtue
there's three factors to improving yourself: who you surround yourself with, how you handle situations with your behavior, and how you approach new ideas and concepts
All that remains is trig
I passed
I got an 83
I saw it
alright its not there either
wait im an idiot
MY HEART IS POUNDING ***I GOTTA KNOW***
ITS GOING TO GENUINELY KILL  ME
I CANT STAND THE SUSPENSE
JUST TELL ME IF ITS OVER FOR ME
`just tell me already`
please...
its likely she set it up that way because she has graded them but needs to upload scores but please
***I NEED THE GRADE***
`P L E A S E`
`PLEASE`
PLEASE
***BUT THERE IS NO GRADE VISIBLE***
i see there's the thing for finals. went to see it. gotta see it. less than 70 means i auto fail. it says its graded.
i see my project grade posted. did wonderful. teammates praised me as the second coming of jesus christ.
im going to have a fucking stroke
but whatever you do, do not let up, no matter what
it can suck, and sucky math teachers are the worst
you've got this.
that being said, as someone whose failed math classes twice, and just passed the one he took this semester, which was arguably the hardest
please keep the images to a minimum here
HELL YEAH
also i got a 60 on my final for math but it doesnt even matter because i nailed between 70-100 the last three tests and coupled with everything else i got a fucking B so ***SUCK IT I PASSED A MATH CLASS FINALLY***
the general conclusion between all these factors basically boils down to a wholeness in positivity and just not being a horrible human being
but in general this is the recipe to improving oneself.
cant even trust cell himself.
cant trust your cell
cant trust yourself's self
cant trust yourself
but thats a story for another time.
there was once an online cult i joined out of curiosity thanks to /x/
pretty much
because unfortunately, the same people who eat up /pol/ content have a common denominator with the same people who believe in conspiracy theories
it used to be a place where you could tell cool ghost stories and also `ask advice on summoning succubi` but now it has devolved into sub-/pol/ territory
x is the paranormal board of 4chan, where things like conspiracy theories, ghost stories, and other stuff is
but to me its more of a point and laugh sorta deal
same
places like /x/ entertain me because i look at them and go "thank the fucking lord i havent gone that crazy yet"
its easier to manage smaller boards
UK is a joke, people getting happy about a 3.1% drop in housing costs without factoring how much it's even gone up recently

if you find yourself without energy, sometimes the best way is to set up a routine beforehand. something extremely simple that you can build on gradually over time.
motivation takes momentum, and momentum is difficult to muster

be fair now.
alice this is serious discussion
you're literally bringing up how you were nearly kicked for rule enforcement for it passive aggressively. but also, alice is not The Spokeswoman for this, so you dont have to only badger her about this
```Alice, can I actually question you about the article you linked me without fear of being kicked because you don't like me discussing the points?```
you've got a bunch of other people here to discuss your inquiries
the only one who posted here about bringing up the rules in the first place was you.
at least, within an english western context
but they dont
okay, but thats not a greeting. that is someone indicating someone is acting out of line through action.
in fact, you're actually using a hostile word in its opposite context
okay, but you're not saying hello. you're saying asshole.
there are limits. a word only works with hostility if it can be used in a hostile manner. hello can't be one of those words, because its inherently a greeting. you'd only get confusion otherwise. of course, this sorta directly contradicts the "society dictates whether a word is offensive", to which i point out its a mixture of both. derogatory words are usually things people find negative traits in, used directly within everyday society with hostile intent
i mean if the source you're pulling it up from literally says that i dunno what else to say
its a very easy conclusion to jump to given the examples you brought up were slurs against white people
how come?
really?
but they dont affect you
right?
but they still matter
the only moment they have, in the entirety of this server, is when you noted their existence
if you've got beef with those slurs and you dont like them, then theyre just as much an issue as other slurs. they just... dont pop up, at all
i did somewhat explicitly just say that they hurt people and we're not really in a position to say whether the hurt they cause others is valid or not.
rukia, you do understand that those slurs are so obscure that in my time looking through the internet they hardly crop up once, right? though, to be honest, i feel all of this talk of language and stuff defeats a very main thing about slurs. they hurt people. and we're not really in a position to say whether the hurt they cause others is valid or not.
these edge cases in other languages are exceptions following different systems of communication, which is sort of ridiculous to compare without getting a linguist involved
Kinda
I mean...
4D > 3D > 2D
_eats hat_

What fucking moron jokes with very real knives
i do it a lot when i help my mom cook
rice is like a sponge. it absorbs the water contents to grow.
rinse out rice. put rice in small pot. put lid on pot. check periodically until most of the water is gone. if it hasnt grown a lot, throw in a bit more water and wait more.
its not hard
i do
and i sure have eaten it charred
and i do mean ***burning*** your rice, because when you do it with a pot with no safeguards, it will get thoroughly charred instead of just chewy
there's honestly not too much of a difference between a rice cooker and a pot aside from rice cookers being more dedicated and having a timer built in from keeping you from burning your rice
rice cookers are more reliable since they have pre-built timers
we dont use a rice cooker; what usually happens is that we basically let the pot boil with the rice and my mom forget and im usually the one to rush over and put out the gas
this is interesting because more often than not i usually eat burned rice
```"hurr durr Alice burns her rice" just fucking nonstop because one time my mom failed to understand how rice cookers work and I mentioned that I was just chewing on crispy rice```
you can do better and your life will be better without people who actively drag you down
fuck em
https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/08/us/anthony-bourdain-obit/index.html
you look for others. the best place to start honestly is to look for studies conducted by sleep labs
that is a really foolish perception to take. you shouldnt avoid reading things because they may be potentially wrong, but rather read them and come to understand /why/ theyre wrong (unless its just raw, unadulterated garbage)
dream theory is a relatively new and nebulous field that has been unfortunately plagued with mysticism and psuedoscience
```dunno what part of psychology that covers but it's something I find interesting```
hypnogogia is a state where you are awake physically in real life, but your brain is still stuck in the dream state. the result is dreams manifesting in real life.
calling it sleep paralysis is misleading, since you can move in these episodes
ive never successfully gained lucidity because my problems were the opposite: i dealt with hypnogogia
you are not the representative of how dreams work. you dont just /will/ dreams to the content you want. ive tried, and failed. the general architecture of a dream is generally dictate to the content you consume, since dreams function by looping back information of things you already know in one big mish-mash that swirls around with the general feelings at the time
that is not how it works
i would very much like to stop having bad dreams, so i can not be afraid to sleep at night
that is extremely not true. ive meet people who have boring dreams or straight up dont who lead pretty happy and fufilling lives. there is 0 correlation between dreams and quality of life. but there ***is*** correlation between quality of life, and repeatedly getting terrible fucking dreams
good for you. i wish i had more of them.
all of them are psychological horrors, but very passive ones that are less terrifying and more thoroughly depressing
but i wouldnt call them nightmares
i have a lot of bad dreams
in your case id say it likely did, and your dream warped the message of the urgency into a very literal life or death scenario
whether or not it had meaning varies between dream (and person interpreting the dream)
usually, dreams have a habit of taking in a stimulus and then warping it into something related to it. this is strange though, normally because you arent supposed to feel physical pain in dreams. it could be possible that the pain that manifested managed to bypass the normal detection of pain within the dream state to interpret it directly into the dream.
do you have them often
because it feels very, very real
its a genuinely unpleasant experience that terrified the shit out of me
they can but this was not it
not nice
we are talking "watching the walls bleed for half an hour" bad
the episodes... were very bad
ive had hypnogogia that has only gone away by changing my sleeping location
no, and i wish i was
there's a lot of labs dedicated to the study of sleep and in turn, dream generation
there is no such thing as flow of time in dreams. it works in lucidity because your perception of time properly kicks in once you gain consciousness; even then i would argue that lucidity still has a more flawed sense of time and isnt 1:1
none of my dreams involve clocks and my house is filled with them.
there are some people whove never dreampt of a clock before
the only consistent thing is waking up from one, because its the one thing anyone can do in a dream, regardless of their state
which in turn brings the implication that dreams have no real logic; they are trapped in the knowledge of the dreamer
there's no true consistency between people in terms of dream logic
dreams in general follow the schema sets of a person's knowledge in a way that can still function within a dream, but can also be nonsense at the same time
okay, correction
thats because dreams dont really follow logic, theyre usually a mishmash of thoughts. there is but one consistent rule in a dream, and its how to wake up from one
no idea. i dont really believe brains genuinely output dreams with the intent to replicate simulations
no meaning, rhyme, or reason. just balls bouncing around infinitely.
like that one dream that was just an infinite white plane of rubber balls bouncing of various sizes and colors
and completely incomprehensible
very rarely my dreams will be neutral
gore is rare. just strong feelings of sorrow and despair.
the worst ones are where friends just give the strong air of not liking me while im around them
i am just skeptical because modifying dreams is something ive tried but failed at, and then gave up on and just let happen. sometimes i just stay up very late without sleeping worried that ill get another bad dream again. it genuinely hurts, because like i said, a lot of them are just genuinely depressing. they usually involve failure, or distance between friends i know, or raw paranoia that people who i trust will turn and hurt me.
thats fine
it just so happens that outline is morbidly terrifying
it is basically your mind trying to tell you where to go, and unable to do so, because you're paralyzed, so in the dream state it makes the outline for you
i sincerely doubt its memetic. mainly because the issue with sleep paralysis and how it manifests is that studies have shown that the hallucination of the shadow entity is usually the projection of the schema of the body reflected back at you. you see someone person shaped because your mind is projecting movements outside of the current physical restrictions its experiencing during the paralysis
i didnt even know the name until a few years ago. thats how obscure it is. a friend told me the name and i looked it up on my own.
with no knowledge of the case beforehand.
as did many people
yes.
multiple times.
i know this because ive gone out of my way to read up on it
hypnogogia is not well known, nor clearly documented
they dont read it and see the dragonflies
they're not, because people report these after the fact
so i doubt its memetic
nobody told me id have a hypnogogic episode seeing the walls bleed
one ive also experienced
you are completely lucid in this state. one of the more common manifestations of hypnogogia is seeing dragonflies, a common one a lot of people report
satire is dead.
to an extent where people began to indeed, take it seriously, and in turn, believe the earth was flat
the irony is that the flat earth movement gained traction explicitly because of how many people joked about it

teachers are grunts in comparison
they also usually have direct access to resources that are provided to the schools, have a foot in the door when it comes to higher political positions in education (re: county boards and in turn superintendent seats), and have greater networking power in association with the people they /need/ to know
principals make more than teachers
```Nobody goes into education for the salary```
whoever it is, they can go fuck themselves. you've got your talent and folks love it

<@168828685497925632> i am pretty sure these are asks that are only good to provoke you. just remember you can track ips if you dont delete them
i think alice is referring to geno
anyway, that was almost a year ago
(i should know, i was also there)
that happened because we were ribbing on him a lot about kanade a lot
i wont lie sometimes i wonder if even i exist
he's not here and he aint comin' in here anytime soon.
though itd rather cut it short since going on too much only breeds needless negativity and ultimately only serves to remind you more of him
its fine, you're getting it out of your system
thank the lord we cut him out quickly then
what
wh
i know, i know
something at the time id rather not make a habit of. the giving people powers to ban others bit, not the actual ban
Ideally the distinction between the state and national level is supposed to combat corruption between each other should it exist, but Florida and the rest of the South exists so
hotel beachside woes
the both of them, together: `proceed to buy more fucking food`
dad: your mom bought too much fucking food for the trip. no shit it doesnt fit in the fridge
mom: this fridge is so small. all the food i brought doesnt fit
thats the issue with corruption
so as far as im concerned i dont really trust cops even if they mean well, since theyve been so thoroughly rotted out
there were official documents released by the fbi long ago that revealed intense efforts by several white supremacist groups to infiltrate police forces across the nation, with a quite a margin of success


instead, have some really stupid looking weapons i found walking around
anyway, thats my vent of the month, since i dont vent at all here and actively avoid doing so.
every vacation with them is the same. constant, unending strife that sees no end.
it was like walking with children. oversized, bickering ancient children
i walked the pier today with my parents, as we usually do (and on the same day as last year too) and it was nonstop bickering from them
mainly because im tired as hell
you are disagreeing with something that is the equivalent of "the sky is blue" but i will drop it
like, completely. it is in their very definition and nature to be incompatible
which is impossible
oh wait no, you said you could be a fascist and a communist
like, full stop
that one is just inherently wrong
like believing fascism and communism are the same
i feel the reason was that some of your views may have been factually incorrect
i didnt think we were convincing anyones views here to begin with
yeah toning down the sarcasm would be sorta nice
even when theyre very blatantly not the case
definitions can be subverted with just the right rhetoric
thats the beauty of politics
politicians say theyre a thing and can be described as something else completely all the time
on paper
see: fascism and dictatorships masquerading as communism
fascism and communism are two diametrically opposed beliefs
that is literally impossible
thats fascism pretending to be communism
except that in itself isnt communism
i dont really trust anarcho-anything within this country given its history
...wait, what do you moderate that has 722 people online
naturally
thats always alright
its funny because they sold all this tourist garbage and seashells and what have you and then they had a wall panel dedicated to these really edgy impractical weapons
i hope you notice the metal brass knuckles with massive blades on them
this really innocuous hole in the wall store sold these weapons

do SOMETHING to hide it better
like jesus fucking christ man
that he keeps this massive monolith of porn on his phone, or that he doesnt fucking hide it like an ***amateur***
i dont know whats worse
eventually he gave up and just told me to stop looking for it and i sat down
i am an extremely straight faced person and made 0 comments and my dad got more annoyed that i fumbled into it because i was looking through the directory of whatsapp videos to see where the damn thing dumped
lots and lots and lots of porn
dad wanted help extracted a video from whatsapp and accidentally showed me his entire hidden porn collection on his phone
im an adult
but im keeping it cool
very... very disturbed
so, i am thoroughly disturbed
i am pretty sure that is explicitly you. if it was something along the lines of going "im done" but then jumping back in, then that would lean more towards your point, but even then those happen less with wanting to just have the last word and more just getting dragged back in
if the person feels that insecure about it, sure, but thats their personal problem
i dont understand how this is an alien concept to you
this is common parlance
to tell the other person you're done talking?
you know, the behavior that would be constructive towards not participating in the shit slinging
you literally just said it was poor form for them to announce they were leaving the conversation
its the internet, not a high school debate club
well, its a discussion, not a debate. people reserve the right to say "im done with this conversation"
a 4chan post, sparkle
sparkle, you are seriously heading down the "it was the victims fault" road over a 4chan post
riya explicitly said "they had it coming"
there is a pretty big difference between leading a responsible life and justifying someone's rape, and it was sorta the latter, sparkle
that is, in itself, defending rape, sparkle
can you exactly blame ibu when the person in question he was responding to was literally defending rape
most silicon tech ceo's are fucking nuts anyway
i dont know the guy personally but im naturally wary of ceo's by default
(the whole flowey fight in general got me)
that bit in undertale before the flowey fight with the fake menu? that got me
i get scared of things that glitch out really well
it was more my obscure fear of glitchy effects
see to me it wasnt that it got into my head so to speak, though the final bit was pretty intense
yeah we're not arguing that
ddlc fucked me up a bit and im a grown ass man, i can only imagine how a kid took it
yeah...
...that is true
whoever experienced this played this alone, and likely had no one to open up to with the themes the game carried out, and pretty much was the last nail
also that would partly play into it, yeah, but id also argue that it also opens up more the avenue for desensitization. lots of people play it and talk through it (and bumble through it) so the effect of the horror is diminished. its the same reasoning why people watch high profile streamers playing horror games and having said streamers get scared constantly
if this opens up another hysteria about gaming i will be annoyed. its always too convenient to blame video games over lack of a good means within a society to deal with mental illness effectively
jesus christ
`That is but one of my many abilities. The true depth of my powers cannot be comprehended... You are welcome...`
In fact, ***I will it so.***
So, I will hope that it appears before you
This is bad, but I usually try to remain positive because usually lost things are closer to us than we think
You didn't lend it to anyone yeah
Where did you last see it
What happened
id read whatever horror shit id get my hands on
i played those a lot
usually what i do i just shut my eyes, toss my headphones, and use the window close shortcut
these days i dont really scream or react hard to screamers
this was when i was like.. 15, 16
i grew really desnsitized to them until a really bad one got me one day and i just couldnt do them anymore
when i was young i would compulsively binge screamers
funny story
in ddlc it was the subtle broken things.
that fucked with me
when the flowey bit happened in undertale with the menu breaking and being stuck on a musical tone i essentially shit myself, and with the window closing and opening and all that shit
the catch is the more realistic and inexplicable it is, and the more consistent it is with how it could break, the more terrified i get
low quality things that tear at the seams with something that feels inherently negative or bad behind them
visually broken things also scare me. very bad video cassete tapes with ambigious images frighten me
they dont need noise it just needs a broken change
abrupt glitch changes with 0 explanation graphically scare me
yeah thats probably the ones he doesnt like the most
things that just feel... wrong
which is when things are functioning normally and suddenly they break with 0 explanation and just result in either sharp noises or decaying graphics or what have you
like, its a very specific style of glitchiness that scares me
its not the deepfried shit that gets me
glitchy shit still gets to me sometimes...
i enjoyed it, but i wouldnt play it again
different endings dont break immersion but consider it this way: there's a moment between loading saves and figuring out the direction of what a route will lead you wherein you stop focusing in the nature of the story and more get focused on seeking a specific outcome, which narratively can ruin the impact of a story if the story sucks.
i guess dan just felt that doing that repeatedly spoils the immersion of the game or something along those lines
i feel that
it literally even tells you at point-blank a few times, honestly
it was pretty ham-fisted
even dan salvato went on record to talk about how he didnt like typical vn's because of it
criticisms can be bad and not agreed with but that was basically the point
thats the point of the criticism
yeah, and the game turns that against you by having a character do that instead, except even further and with a singular person
well not hacking but i mean more the folks who obsessively save and swap save files to get the endings with the characters they want
its pretty funny
monika does all the dirty tricks and underhanded hacks a seasoned vn novel player would do to get the ending they want.
yeah
im less refering to people who use it for escapism and more for people who have so burned the genre into themselves that they have engrained the nature of handling situations in real life with the similar mentality of dating games. you know, /that/ kind of otaku. you know the type
thats understandable, though i feel for what it was it was a very good story on the basis that it was an extremely good wake up call for the type of person who actively plays those games for very fetishy reasons
the ending didnt so much scare me as it did just make me very depressed

binged the entire horror segment of encyclopedia dramatica, binged the creepypasta wiki, binged the tvtropes horror nightmare page of every franchise i could think of
your modern nazi doesnt walk around with stereotypical red bands on their shoulders shouting shit at their lungs. they look and talk like everyday people, and pretty much hide in plain sight.
we do have the tools to stop it. the problem is that over time, they were retired, and rhetoric has refined itself in a way where theyve opted to encourage fairness of discussing completely undefendable positions reworded as easier to swallow terminology

lets reel that edge back a bit
(note, this is already happening with the global warming "debate")
what do you do when the derision does nothing, and their opinion gains more strength
```but we are also allowed to deride them for being idiots, while also providing them with plenty facts to argue against their opinion```
like say, `the earth is flat`
which means inherently, you MUST disallow people from holding ideas
that is true salvio, but also for there to be fact-based discourse, you need to establish facts
while there's a certain subjectivity across cultures, there are very basic things across all cultures that overlap in terms of morality. you can argue these are taught, but when different cultures teach fundamentals consistently enough that they match other places (murder is bad, for example), does the desire to teach become instinct itself?
this is also why people need reminders
this is true
```if your parents hadn't told you the difference you'd not know.```

the only good things elon musk knows how to do is accrue a shitload of raw talent (to overwork) and successfully raise such good PR that everyone who likes him worships the ground he walks

same goes for therapists
its true, sadly, and applies to a lot of fields
then go simpler
so i miss out on a lot of the bigger games
its depressing because while i am proud of my computer most things do not run on it
yeah
because it ties perfectly to the mentality of "if it doesnt run, you need a better computer", which in turn devolves into the sales pitch of "buy one of our new computers to run x game"
outside of "it needs to function"
its a dying art because there is 0 incentive for computer brands to encourage code optimization for programs
one of the bigger problems ive seen in `The Gaming World` is that people learn enough to use the engine but not enough for optimization or making sure it runs properly
it is genuinely easier to use pre-made engines than to make your own, and there's a lot of factors to making a new engine that boil down to "if you're going to make something that isnt an improvement to everything else that already exists or needs to exist for niche reasons, you are better off just learning an engine and calling it a day"
also, to the talk about game engines

do you document them
the smaller it is the easier you will complete it
stuff made on things like Game Maker and the like can have an equally profound impact
creating simpler things not only grants you more energy to make more, but also lets you focus on sharpening quality
things that sell a portfolio are things youve made, regardless of creation. most demos dont see coverage because while they look nice and make for good pieces, theyre substanceless and nobody really knows about em
there are so many unreal demos and unity demos with high end shaders
a lot of people assume you need high end presentation and graphics to make things

a lot of christians really got into minecraft because of the initial solitary and building nature of it mimicing biblical stories

http://objectiveministries.org/zounds/review-minecraft.html
this is really funny to hear because minecraft used to have a REALLY strong christian following
```They visited once, with their grandson and wouldn't let him play Minecraft just because the Chinese Mythology skin pack exists, despite the fact that I don't own said skin pack.```
Hella
either that or some serious introspection followed by some good self-help books if you cant afford it
wfc, we're here for you, but these sound like issues best handled by a professional
Absolutely not
Also I wont tolerate that kind of talk here
If you can't find anything in Japan, it seems wise to concede your losses and go home to start anew. Remember, you were laid off, not fired. You are at least competent at what you do
That's shitty of her, and you deserve better than that
They're not, no, and it sucks
***We are here for you, but you need serious help we cannot give you here first***
I've said it before and I'll say it again
My point is I feel like now you are just running to any excuse to point at yourself to self-depricate and I really do not like enabling people to shit on themselves
Phone being dumb
Worse when you're drunk, I mean
Except you just said you're worse when you're sober
Because it makes em stupider
People are literally not themselves drunk
That's not how being drunk works; the act of being drunk does not remove filters, it literally dampens brain cells and slows brain processing
Being drunk proves nothing about you
Do you feel as though the value of ones life is measured in their performative value
If you did you would not be here
No, you dont
Get that through your head, that you are cared about here, and that those thoughts otherwise are cancerous mental tumors eating away at your wellbeing
For fucks sake wfc the fact that you're here and you exist in our company is one of them
Your life will improve drastically if you open yourself up to that idea, but we can't do that for you
You feel alone, but you are not
Wfc you need to come to the realization that if you can't care for yourself others won't and aren't going to try to. We're trying to help you out with your feelings here but you ain't doing yourself any good saying you should kill yourself and that there are no solutions when there's a network of people here ready to throw down for you
Laughing derisively about it will not get you anywhere
It's not
Buddy I'm 23 I ain't even done shit
Suicide is not now nor will ever be the answer and you should frankly be ashamed at toting it so hard when people are trying to help you realize otherwise. Whatever you're wrestling with, these feelings, you need to take a step back and understand that a lot of them have to be sorted out, either by a professional or by you with some serious self care
No, it is not
It will do nothing but trap you in a state of feeling eternally shitty
Entertaining suicidal thoughts will get you nowhere
Recognizing the problem is key to dealing with it, but the first step is yours
You got that?
Alright?
So I can personally crush them and ring them into fucking pulp with my bare hands
To talk to us again
And if these thoughts come back to haunt you
- that when you manage to reach a point in life that is any sort of remote improvement to this, to seek help ***immediately***
- that you start working towards a plan with these suggestions in mind to the best of your ability
I want you to swear to me two things:
I'm giving you this talk and being a bit more aggressive because there seems to be no other way to shut down your goddamn self loathing, but I know for a fact you will possibly relapse again into this mentality, because that's just how depression do
Now I'm gonna be three thousand fucking percent real with you wfc
Good
You got that?
The moment you unlearn that undiluted stupidity is the moment a lot of things are going to improve for you, and it'll be the moment that helps you click and maybe help understand some peace with who you are
Even the most socially reclusive r9k android on the planet has to interact with someone
People are too complex to do so
You cant
Like it's literally fucking impossible
That is a lie hammered into your brain by people who have lied to themselves to delude themselves into thinking otherwise
There is literally no one on this planet capable of surviving alone, either psychologically, socially, emotionally, or physically
Do you understand that?
You're not weak for relying on us, and you're not weak for having to go back to deal with your folks if needed
Start making a damn plan now and stick with it, and at any moment you waver, you can come to us and we will always make sure to set you straight again
I think you will be able to survive most other places in the US given that, and while your predisposition to shit on yourself is strong, your resourcefulness in staying afloat as long as possible despite what I can only describe as intense chronic depression is much stronger
You've successfully shown your ability to survive in a completely foreign land for a year with the only reason stopping you being a non renewed contract. Do not debate me on this, this is fact
I feel the sweltering heat is nothing compared to eating evangelical Jesus add for the rest of your life
I get you, but consider between either living with your parents forever, or living in Arizona while building experience away from the racist assholes who make your life miserable
My suggestion for you is to take the L after your stint in Japan and go home to the US to live with your parents for a bit while actively finding jobs outside of the state, probably in Arizona where you can teach English to folks on the cheap. UK could also work if you've got connections there
I know
Alright
Japan
Shut the fuck up and tell me if there is any future job potential after this contract in the forseeable future
That's more than a years worth of experience you can shove in your resume teaching non americans English successfully
Shove your fucking self depreciation in a box for 5 seconds for me and tell me how long you've had this job in japan
Like what state
Where would you live if you had to end up with your parents again
Quick question
phenominally friendly
your boss is like
all of it
snatch it
see if your bro knows the combination to the safe
and if that is the case you need to nab them somehow
that is bad
if saki's preparing everything im presuming whoever theyre going to is already aware that theyll be coming tomorrow
of course, that boils down to how good you are at lying. if you're not an active liar or arent used to lying i reccomend against it
see if you can ask him under the guise of getting some details for a work specific thing without tipping off your hand
i speak from experience when i say there is no low an abusive parent wouldnt sink to do whatever it is they can to assert that they are right
wrong names and inconsistent information has not stopped people from attempting and successfully trying to ruin other people's lives before. i understand you're angry, and rightfully so, and there's time to do this, but the last thing you want to leave an abuser is any sort of potential advantage that can be brought back to you. this goes double due to being trans.
otherwise, her possession of that information could be used against you to fake your identity by any means
saki, after you get that sorted out, my advice would be to look up your states laws wrt other people holding your legal documents, and twisting your mom's arm to give you your documents back by force
It is much harder to fall for things when everyone around you is reminding you why you did it in vivid detail
If you ever find yourself in that kind of situation saki, tell us, and we'll make sure you don't fall for it again
Right now, your parents are completely writing you off, but in time, do not be surprised if they try contacting you harder or try finding you while seemingly being 300% more accepting, as this is a common tactic for parental abusers to try and get you back into the cycle of abuse
There is one more thing I will warn you about
Good
<@102691114762371072> did you ever manage to nab those papers from the safe
Casual reminder that russia is one of the top asbestos manufacturers in the world

Sounds like performance anxiety
They will likely turn against me
And if I defend myself against very notably elderly people
Because they'll likely go "well, why don't you stay? They obviously care about you and you'll save more money that way"
Ergo I can't rely on them
And cops hate and actively avoid getting involved in family drama
But the culture here in miami favors parents due to how parenting styles work here
It sure is
And then they will likely physically restrain, block, or beat me until I say otherwise
And I will go "fuck you, I am leaving"
Because they are the type to go "you cannot leave, period"
Because I'm absolutely certain it will end in a very physical, violent confrontation
I am a bit afraid of the day I move out
At least you were able to run off with no strife
Well that ain't the case now, we got your back
Damn
`not unless he kills you in the name of heroism first`
at least `no one ships you with ver`
(this applies to everyone else who ever has these kinds of experiences as well)
thats what we're here for
also a reminder that if you ever have feelings like this, aside from getting it out there (which we appreciate), you can always count on staff to come to us to tell us these things as well so we can cut them down when they happen

be wary of him as you're wary of her
it is cowardice on their part to not sit down and understand, and instead guilt you repeatedly using manipulative psychological tactics. they are cowards for refusing to listen.
it is exceptionally brave
you have every right not to confront them about it when they show 0 desire to understand, let alone leave you be about it on the matter. what you are doing is not cowardice; its leaving a bad situation and moving on to live your life how you want to

nice
Here's for hoping for a swift, steady recovery
children are not being detriments to society by not getting vaccinated. parents are being detriments to society by not letting them be vaccinated. gotta be careful shifting the blame to kids when they not only dont know any better, but probably would understand it more clearly than the parent
in fact one of the pushing measures of eugenics was eliminating people with the lowest measured IQs
i get your angle but also that is actually still eugenics
if the question is ever "why shouldn't we get rid of people with x disability instead of help compensate for them", the answer to why that reasoning exists is always eugenics
the reasoning is eugenics.
eugenics

rome paid for that lesson and soon so will we.
the irony is that people will end up paying more for it anyway, because it stops being a small tax and then becomes a service you need to actively pay for to have
pretty much
privatization is an american national past time
thats... depressing
true
honestly as an aside im sorta surprised virtual reality hasnt been implemented into prisons yet for the sake of pacifying prisoners
thatd probs be me
if i was in prison
i wont lie
private schools are just the increased stratification of education of the higher classes to `keep those damn poors away`
kerrik, thats what actual prisons are for
whatever maximizes profits
i wouldnt be surprised
_eyes betsy devos_
`it's almost like this is a long slow conversion to privatizing schools`
and its sorta why the gen education exists in colleges to begin with; people who go to college arent completely guaranteed to know or remember what they did before, so since it's a service thats paid for, they have to go "well, since this is a paid service, we need to assure that a benchmark is assured for what is being paid for so people cannot say 'this college taught me nothing' when clearly we prepared the opposite"
it was overpopulated but the teachers were alright, but a lot of high schools suck dick
my high school was okay
yep

Thats good. Knowing what you want to do is huge lol, I didn't know what I wanted to do for ages so its good to nail that down in your mind/heart
Have you thought about how successful you want to be in life/ at uni? Not being motivated is going to haunt you even applying to unis let alone doing well in one
I decided not to go to uni but when it came to motivation I just thought about how sucessful I wanted to be in life and how I wouldn't get their if I just sat around not doing the shit I really need to do to sort out my future. Doesn't work for anyone but it got me where I am now
`i say, half a day into the future`
thats horrible, fuck that guy
Don't need a 2nd incident after yesterday
Hopefully it's all good tho
#RAW moves fast so that count could be off
Though saying that
#RAW is basically 1 in 20 people warning others and the other 19 just actually talking about the event, probably unaware of all this
Using the hastags and the @'s and even in general it's not a topic to joke about
There's a time and place for everything
Pff
Sad thing is even if this person is joking the moment someone inside the venue sees this
Hopefully it turns out fine
Also since it's pretty serious, was recently shared on twitter. person deleted their account and from what I heard security is trying to find X person now
as if
I love how they tried to win back peoples trust by saying they wouldn't do any more lootboxs
Just curious to paint a full picture in my mind. Are talking 25+ min wage?
geez
20mins break?
thats killer
7 days a week
Oh wow
Couldn't imagine myself doing it for what i assume is 9-5?
Sounds like it
What do you do now?
`For now...`
But you can meet other artists, most art circles are really friendly and supportive
Yeah
Though you can find friends who are into art stuff too
(Even though art for friendship shouldn't be treated as leverage)
I've definitely met people who you could say aren't boring, but are immense assholes
But even people who, on some objective, are boring, aren't necessarily bad company for it either
To be honest, being boring isn't even really a bad thing and is largely up to interpretation; I don't really think you're boring since you show off such interesting ideas even if you don't talk too much
A lot of people are boring as sin, but the social anxiety is definitely a problem
But the best way is just to go to places with people who have similar interests to you
Talking can be hard, and it takes a while to work on it
have you spoken to them first about getting their shit together
fun, fun, fun
dad berates mom. mom gets mad. dad points out faults of hers. mom gets madder. mom drags me into fight dad created. i say whatever it is to escape said fight. dad insults me for supposedly being spineless over a problem he created, and then sarcastically mentions how i think he should defend me, when the issues with my mom literally stem over things outside of my control
Dam. Sleep well, hope and sure you'll find something much better soon
Can say its not something I saw when I was job searching at first
Was wondering how one even becomes cassette changer
Ahh
Are you just looking for factory work or something?
The thought of it just makes me depressed
Anything sounds better then that imo
Finding something better is what happened though so at least leaving then is justified
I rarely got to talk to my co-workers so that was out of the question
at all
I can't imagine doing what you do
Tbf I'm new to the world of full time work in that sense, I literally had my first full time job last month and I'm deciding to leave already
at a push
I wouldn't even last 2 days

How long have you been working there?

but not anymore
probably wouldve worked in like... 2012, circa that time
'cause theyre dumb and thought that strategy would work
a very devious smokescreen whose raw confusion on the surface executes an otherwise lazy protocol of "we're lazy and dont wanna do the work"
making it enough of a dumb spectacle to the extent where it interferes with their daily routine makes their fans decry "why are you doing this? just keep doing what you were doing" instead of sitting doing and resolving problems
it makes perfect sense
not until i graduate, which is thankfully this semester
she's not nice.
one time literally stroking the knife against my neck
she's threatened to kill me before, and has threatened me a couple times at knifepoint
its not new
and yeah
im just upset because she literally theatened me and dug her nails into my wrist hard, and that i was very close to just opting to snap her wrist in half
in fact, there's stuff that BELONGS to him that i've helped him with, that favors him leaving it the hell alone
there's nothing of use for him in that key
she does not seem to fundamentally comprehend that it literally does not matter
my mom and dad despise each other
ive put it here for years
except
its because she thinks my dad will rife through it since theyre in seperate rooms
she grips my hand, digs her nails into my wrist, clenches her teeth, and tells me to shut up and to just do it
i, not wanting to engage her paranoia, remind her that ive put it on my desk with ***literally everything else i own*** for ***more than a decade***
she gets upset, tells me i should put it on the nightstand
i tell her i dont need to, ive put it on my desk for years
mom sees me usb key on the bed, tells me to put it on the nightstand
and/or spay

current right wing politics actively pursues the combination of church and state in policy creation at every level. 'far right' and 'religious right' are synonyms at the institutional level
theyre identical
```I'd almost be willing to argue that worse than the far right is the religious right.```
also as an aside
thats hella good
sometimes talking can feel futile but it helps, if only because people are genuinely listening, and do mean the best for you, or at least try to
you share as much as you want to share, we're here for you
```I’ve dumped my emotional pain here for god knows how long, im surprised people still have words to say```
https://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/magecart-newegg/
its not an inherently bad thing to do, and there's lots of places dedicated to doing just that safely
yeah that too
*this varies on the people you meet, and if you meet shitty people naturally all of this comes apart
you will have more fufilling connections* in your life in finding romantic partners if you take the time to know them first, because most of the time, the people who you meet who you like and like you at the worst case if they reject you will go "yeah, im not interested, you're still cool though" and you have a fun time with them regardless. and, if theyre already in a relationship, you can still befriend them and still have people in your life to care for.
yeah
so judging it as a "should you, or should you not" answer dynamic feels wrong to say, because the real answer is to get to know them enough to understand whether they are or not
so, here's the thing. on paper, going "well, let me ask them if theyre in a relationship first before asking them out" is a responsible thing. after all, you are communicating directly your intention and wish to understand where theyre at so you can make a proper judgement. except, the problem with this is that it comes off as a bit exploitative. it basically says "i dont know you, i havent taken the time to know you, but i want to ignore all that to take you out for a potential opportunity to kiss you. would you like to?"
```Should I ask a girl if she has a boyfriend/girlfriend before asking her out?```
_reads this_
hella
if you love this person, id say to give as much of your heart as you can until the inevitable happens. it will suck, and it will hurt. but you'll have the satisfaction to have lived without regret, being with someone you care dearly about.
at least the both of you know how you feel for each other. i dont want to sound like a massive cornball but, when people say that it is better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all, this is what they mean
ive also known cases of people cheating through morse code
back in my day in high school, i helped cheat by doing finger signals on my paper so that the person next to me would see. id explain the timing so that they would keep up with the signals, but the emphasis was them keeping up with the signals, or else theyd fuck it up and get wrong answers
using audio to cheat is for chumps

Isn't he a deuterantagonist though
Oh yes him
I know jojo part 2 has the wubwubs
Maybe it's an audio thing?
Hed even show up in espernet sometimes
Many... many years ago
The last major thing he ever announced was a music collaboration in Minecraft
Also deadmau5 hasn't done a damn thing for years
Gotta sit back and listen then
so much so now that political identites are now opting in belief of facts as part of their platform; something that was unheard of a decade ago (though existing informally as campaign tactics)
this system of showering the public with lies predates this presedential election; its only that its come to a head with the increased scale of lying over the years
It has spawned some of the most absurd rhetorical I've ever seen
The strategy of showering the public with lies until they're too desensitized to fact check anything
I'll sound like a DMC character for this but
This is all Bannon's doing
Marine
even Le Pen and Fukuyama disapprove of him
and Fukuyama was called a communist for that
and a president that fought poverty is a political prisoner and hated as a criminal
well
this is the country where a judge that bends the law for his own agenda is hailed as a hero
only to get a simpleton reply such as "shut up what do you know about our country"
it's amazing, actually
we have ***the whole world*** in one way or another declaring their disapproval of Bolsonaro
```Casual reminder that there is an active disinformation campaign to fuck with this country```
oh, you mean brazil?
And its working

its just madness that courses are designed to hardboil pressure to find /the/ most exemplary student as opposed to just focusing the course to create as many exemplary students as possible more slowly

Its not

The worst part is
Now that Bolsonaro, just as Trump did, managed to discredit all opposing media in the populace's eye
Every alarmist-sounding news will be taken as fake news
I wish I fucking knew
One had its school and health station burned to the ground
Within 24 hours of Bolsonaro's election, two indigenous tribes were attacked
jesus
Anti fascism banners in universities were taken down by judges for being "against Bolsonaro" even though no name was written
Well
Everything in this election was so fucked up the worst outcome was quite foregone
The Electoral Court being lenient with a blatantly fraudulent campaign, or going out of their way to accuse Roger Waters of... something... for the position he took while in tour here
Barbosa during his time in the Supreme Court was called a "Brazilian Batman" by PT haters
But now he's being criticized to death instead of at least trusted by those haters
>Fact: in the populace's memory, the Mensalão and Car Wash scandals are PT's fault
>Joaquim Barbosa, rapporteur on Mensalão, hunted down PT corrupts: voted on the PT candidate Haddad
>Roberto Jefferson, Mensalão convict: voted on Bolsonaro
>Rodrigo Janot, rapporteur on Car Wash: voted on Haddad

i can't even begin to express the irony in this
we just elected a corrupt, dictatorship-loving, alt-right piece of shit under the assumption the other party in the second run was the most corrupt this country has ever seen
ye
`Politics is painful`
you tell me
Damn

wanna see a giant act of arson?

they voted to stay in UK to stay in EU
I feel bad for scotland lmao
But yeah
Shh 😉
I mean her pulling out of the vote to pass the deal through the commons shows her strength in parliament already
Boris was favoured lmfao
No one else is gonna do much better at this point
Her surviving was pretty easy to predict
As planned
Also £8 -8.35 is pretty darn solid depending on your age, previous experience the actual job and all that
Was gonna say, crazy choice for winter
I misread Sketch's post and thought they were doing an actual run <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
As of now 136 members of the Conservative party have publicly stated they'll vote for May so she only needs 22 more to be safe 🤷
The possible replacements aren't much better anyway 🤷
Seeing a lot more support for her by Conservative MPs then not atm
She'll probably get through it anyway
you made it through I assume
Ouch
god I felt so shit while looking
It took me around 5-6 months to find a job
my high school  grades were a joke
Oh yeah you can do very decent with shit school grades
Whats the possibility of him getting a job?
Oh yeah I can imagine
Nice
Ohhh
They have April to pay?
Oh
Even more with unemployed
Fat oof yeah
Ouch £2k with no income?
Can be useful
Work experience is pretty nice even if its one shift
But yeah bringing up the EVO thing could work
But like don't play these games with life like that
I get the pride thing
It's there for this reason
smh
He isn't claiming it?
but eh
I feel like it needs to be soon
I dont even know when I'm gonna move out
and took me like 4-5 months to even get a job I wanted
I didn't know what I wanted to do until like 4 months before I left college
Exactly
I think I would have probably been depressed if I went down the uni route, was kinda done with education atm and would rather get the experience for my career path
Yeah college was good for me
what dark times
Even thinking of the old days of education make me shudder
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560> Stupid stress
got me stressing out as a kid for no reason
I wish I was told how irrelevant most subjects minus english and maths would have been in my life for my career path
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227> Very true

so 3 times I took English
I think I got a D in highschool,  a D in my 1st year of college and a C in the 2nd year
You need at least a C or above
I did terrible in high school so I had to take an extra year in college so I was there for 3 years
I'm 99 myself
Yeah 1998-99
Redeemed myself at college at least
Ironically 2015 is the same year as I did mine. Got poor grades of course
Yeah, can built up a nice portfolio in the background while that solid income rolls in. Where you at in the education side of things
Did you have a plan for the overall career path you want to end up on?
Good stuff!
A solid job it sounds like
Even losing a weekend here and there is fine
I assume Monday to Friday?
Having that source of income is fantastic though
What even is it?
Hype!
plane ticket, exchange program, american colleges, whatever it takes. its not going to get any better there.
given who they elected and the new spark of lgbt violence incited over there, you need to feverishly pretend and get the hell out of that country period. ive heard the news going on over there. its frankly unsalvageable.
you need to absolutely keep your mouth shut given the current political climate over there
```I still remember when I told them I was a transgender and the conversation ended with my father screaming "I'm not gonna spend a single cent on that idea"```

I didn't really know dub anime so I didn't realise who they both were until after I worked with them <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
so got the chance to help both
Yeah they were working on the same project
But mainly David
It was work for David Vincent and Bryce Papenbrook
Yeah
Oh it really does. Very blessed to have that
Which helped massively

£32k in UK but like $55k+ in US
Even if you do get underpaid for your age least you start now
Still a solid sector
In game dev?
of course some people get lucky
Yeah that tends to be the norm for most sectors
Train into london is already £2k+ a year
Yeah I can see that being a thing. Being in london 35k+ salary probably only actually nets you around 17-24k or even less anyway
I also know someone on 28k so just did the average between them
London based of course

She knew she was going to lose the vote hence why she pulled the vote before Christmas
at all
It was never going to go through
^
Why are people surprised she survived the vote
fine. you're right.
so it seems more fruitful on your end, as a moderator, to ***make sure people don't start this to begin with***
you also have no right in stopping me in correcting these details, should they crop up, as i maintain to right to correct them when they appear
the fact that you feel the need to also tell me this publicly instead of assume the very medium you claimed i should do, which is pming, is very telling of your hypocrisy in handling this, given that you are showing no impartiality to something you know full well happened throughout a good unit of time
you are explicitly dancing around her explicit attempt to connect her feelings of harassment with a repainting of what happened between her and ex-staff; i have not done this to ensure she is a shitty person, im doing this to ***keep the record straight publicly***, as these kinds of tactics (ie the casual erasure of attempting to repaint scenarios people have no context to, in order to quietly either shame previous parties or make them out to be either hostile or useless) are precisely why i spoke out before
```You've been airing personal grievances to try to prove a point. I could have warned you for this a few days ago, but I did not, in my concern about strictly appearing impartial. However, my position doesn't change your behavior, so I'm warning you now that it's happened again. If you think Alice shouldn't be enforcing rules... she's not, so that's the end of it. If you just don't like Alice, please just disengage. Litigating prior personal issues in public isn't constructive.```
i gave my advice on what to do to handle it as well. thats the most that needs to be said. if there's anything youd like to add, feel free.
and im pointing out she brought it up to begin with.
*former staff
i am not justifying the harassment. i am pointing out why the staff would not be so keen to help her, given her blaise erasure of context of why the staff left to begin with and her insinuation that them leaving is linked to the harassment
i think her conflation (and even assumption) of former staff not wanting to defend her coupling with the casual erasure of the context behind what led to such a belief is in itself an admission of a hostile agenda
whoever it is that is going out of their way to harass you in private, you must take up with staff. ive explained to you in the past back when i was staff that ban evasion is a losing game.
```It doesn't make me feel that great to know that someone cares enough to harass me but the entire staff team that used to be here does not care enough to defend me``` that is no one's fault but your own, given that you admitted to purposefully targetting a staff member for your own hostile agenda, and then proceeded to do quite a long laundry list of many other things (that upon jogging your memory of, you immediately silenced me for)
Also where I’m around a single bedroom is at least $1560+ a month

She's from Sweden. We've been together for just over 4 years now, nearly a quarter of my life haha. She wants the move in around summer 2018 but I'm pushing for the more realistic approach of Early 2020
Mhm
Living at home is nice and saves you a lot of money. With my partner moving over to the UK soon I'll have to kiss that opportunity goodbye and move out <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> Should be worth it though
and no I'm done Glitch, sorry if I rocked the boat at all.
"Pushing someone else's issues aside and proposing that they do what has worked for you and only what has worked for you is neither constructive nor helpful."

Oh you mean like throwing a list of toxic behaviors in someone's face right?
Plus I feel like tossing up a list of toxic behaviors at someone giving advice is very counterproductive.
I definitely clarified what I meant in no uncertain terms in my very next post.
What I said is neither toxic nor negative.
But this is a general discussion channel is it not?
I'm not debating. I'm giving advice which you can take or leave.
That seems...very self-defeating. If your approach is clearly not working well for you in a consistent way, how is my approach less valid if it works very well for me?
Sometimes it really is about faking it and convincing yourself of an alternative mood.
Even at times when it's hard to function, I still have to get up, take the bus, and go to work.
I'm also Bipolar. I learned through my time with myself that I have to make my own happiness at times.
Hell they offered it to me.
well that's a rather noninvasive procedure.
I mean that's not really...a good reason though. I have my own share of emotional disabilities, I just work through them and learn coping mechanisms.
I'm not against drugs, moreso the concept of using them not feel better about your current situation.
You should definitely not rely on drugs to be happy.  If someone is so down and out that they can't not feel depressed, something needs to change in their life in a more tangible way then drowning their emotions.
As in it's the reason why
It is
but i only hate those who really shove their rights into other's mouths

there are certain things that appear legal on the books, but are not legal in the real world
sounds like you are arbitrarily drawing the line between free and not free to fit your own whims
i think that is different from my example
it is like saying in china that you are free to support hong kong, but you must face the consequences
then you cannot say you have free speech
i think that if you can get harrassed by police, even punished, just for saying certain things
sounds to me like free speech isnt really free
if you think there’s actually free speech in the united states, youre out of your mind. have you ever tried saying the n word in a public space?
your words remind me of the words of the kgb when they try to arrest someone
my example was saying the n word in a public space. i will not be strawmanned

It’s a solution that’s simply too big brain to comprehend
Waking up having borderline suicidal thoughts every day for six months has just been one of the worst times in my life.
That is true, but at this point in time, the bads have been outweighing the goods for so long that I’m thinking “what’s the point?”
And it’s not like I wanna end myself, but if there was a button where if pushed, I would suddenly stop existing, I’d choose that.
Honestly, depression sucks. I would elaborate more, but I’m gonna go to bed soon. It’s just that the mood swing is hitting hard again.
Got like 10 things all going on at once in high school
Needed an extension, bit of a long story but I didn't wanna type for an hour
She looks at my assignments w/o my permission, sees that I have ONE not turned in, and flips her shit. She told my dad, who’s taking her side, and tbh, I just feel like no one is on my side rn
She invaded my school Google acct btw
My mom invaded my privacy big time (high schooler)
I just need to vent real quick
Same on that, tho not w/ my orientation, but with my mental issues. Also, I somehow feel safer talking on here, because it's completely anonymous and I don't feel like I'm just dumping all my problems on my friends

Precalc man
That Cognitive Behaviour Therapy thing ain’t doing shit for me as well
9th grade, which is in Junior High for us Canadians, is when it started for me. My Aspie ass got over anxious and just wanted to fix my problem so here I am now with a good support network and meds yet I still am having suicidal thoughts on the regular 🙃
Though it kinda just kicked in when I said the depression has been hitting again (FYI: parents know how I feel, and both mom and dad know I have suicidal thoughts) and my mom saying “I don’t see you depressed when you’re at home” Robin Williams was always laughing and joking and smiling yet he still committed suicide from depression. Depression isn’t plain to see, and this is a high school English teacher I’m dealing with.
Abt to start new meds so that’s fun
Actually was a little bit fine
It was gone for the past week
Oh yeah
A sympathetic science teacher of mine and my dad also are part of my support network
I see a councillor at school when I can’t meet w/ my therapist
I play vidya, go on Reddit, listen to music, and watch anime to distract from the pain
I journal
Jesus Christ that was a lot I just let off there
It’s like the worst Rube Goldberg machine ever
It finally got triggered again when my mom (who I finally realized has been abusing me for 6 years) screamed at me for the first time in a week. Them meds also don’t be workin. Mom doesn’t understand that I’m depressed and thinks I’m faking, which correlating with high school, ending up in lower grades due to memory loss, she thinks I’m not trying hard enough, of which she thinks the best idea is to berate me over a singular assignment I haven’t done feelsbadman
Fuck, the depression’s back and it’s hitting harder than ever.

I’m sure that we pretty much all know that any person with a monopoly on power is not going to change things easily because people asked nicely or did a mild non-violent revolt without any of the opposite to back em up, total control over the perpetrator/dismantlement is the only way, the former won’t be listened to and the latter will be short lived, enforcement of that system/regime/etc will be sent to crush it down no matter the cost, that’s the first blood that’s always gonna happen in these situations, though the first blood happened a *very long time ago before whatever counter action was sent*.

Late, just wanted to deluge my thoughts on this, be it this is admittedly the tip of the iceberg.

The total control doesn’t have to necessarily be by direct violence, I think strikes are a good example of this.
Historically speaking this is true as well
The whole world is governed by violence in a daily basis, the huge chunk of it isn’t what would be classified as “violence” to any normal person as it’s not direct physical contact.

It is very sad that in some parts of the world it isn't safe for LGBTQ+ folks.

Disgusting.
I understand.  I personally have seen banter taken too far, and it ending up hurting someone.  I do not care for it either.
It is unreasonable to assume that any relationship will have it's hurdles or arguments to overcome.  The best thing you can do is learn from them and grow as a people.
no offence
at the end of the day, most nazis nowadays are evolved incels, so it makes sense that the fat single neckbeard guy who spends his whole time online would be a nazi
stooping to their level is stupid
fascists are usually people without jobs/girlfriends/respect/all the aforementioned who spend most their time browing 4chan or jacking off
to carry, yeah
my friend's dad is a council worker, and he showed me this room in his house where he has weapons used by kids on the street, and there was a literal fucking katana and an ottoman-era sword
lmao
i can understand the appeal too
no offence or anything
is having one for pleasure that cool?
but honestly
i mean i can understand the protection part
'hahaha gun go pew pew'
its purely pleasure
people in america don't want guns for 'self defense' or 'protection'
that makes a lot more sense
ohhhh
new zealand had the same gun laws as US until 2 years ago, but the homicide rate was 1.3 compared to 5 in USA
ig its to do with the culture as well
britbong police doin ok <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
uk homicide rate is 1.5 per 100,000, compared to us which is 5.0 per 100,000
but awful if you dont live in one
which works fine if you live in a safe area
we basically don't allow any weapons to be carried
3'' and above are banned to carry
how the fuck did he go from a childhood hero to the mayor of crazy town
It is far beyond any reform.
That is the main crux of America ever since it’s exodus, a colonial state born from the slaughter and slavery of natives and other minorities it used to grow itself.
America is a colonial state, so yes.
And the causes are as wide as the cosmos, and interconnect, it goes much beyond just police brutality.
Otherwise you’re fecklessly slapping at air.
My thought is that it’s pointless to wonder about if it’s good or bad.

There is no one controlling these uprisings, only circumstances, we can wonder about wether it’s good or bad, but it’s **pointless** as there’s no organization aside from circumstances in any of these, it’s a false discussion to have.

If you want to understand these uprisings and to fix the fruit that it bares, you must go and analyze the root, what caused it all.

For me I feel 100% people are going to kill me
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
For example, I thought up an idea of Kirika dying and Hibiki failed to save her, and Shirabe got extremely pissed off at Bikki
My ideas for Symphogear fanfics and the like are...depressing in some cases
To be honest, I feel like part of the things I post in <#357682999300718592> are...well, I’m good at match up ideas, but anything else i suck at
Thank you for the kind words~
Okay. I’ve held this up inside me for quite a bit of time, but I really think I need to say it now. I don’t feel comfortable here at all. I love this place for what it is, Symphogear, and the things it has, like the amazing artwork. What I absolutely hate though, is how the server makes me feel. I’m never comfortable at all here, and i feel like everything I do, say, post, or whatever is either something bad, wrong, stupid, or something else. I seriously hate the feeling that everything i do here, someones is going to penalize me for it. It doesn’t help that I’ve accidentally broken several rules in the past which only serves to give me an extraordinary fear of Melua. The point is, I feel like I don’t belong here in any way, shape, or form outside of my love for Symphogear. Practically everyone I see has SOMEONE they can socialize with because they share an interest other than Symphogear. Me, I don’t feel that way AT ALL. It’s as if I’m just here to be that one person everyone ignores and no one likes. Well, I’m done ranting. As if anyone gives a shit about me here.
I need to vent a bit, not like anyone cares
i wish everyone would be nice to each other

Honestly, I remember a time last year, where I was in a really dark time in my life. I struggled heavily from depression (still do, just I've become better at managing it), mainly brought on from my abusive mother (she has verbally abused my little sister and i for a long time, I don't want to get into it atm), stress, and overall struggles from my first year in high school (it was completely new for me, I knew no one, and I also have autism, which makes it hard for me to make friends), to where I felt I was close to ending at all at times. I still feel like me discovering Symphogear helped me out a lot during this time, it was an escape from reality, and unlike anything I have ever seen, period. Yes, the show doesn't have the greatest writing known to man, and there are more plotholes than I'd like, but it was just amazing. I don't know how to describe it, just all this action with absolutely banging music playing, it was just plain awesome to me, and it still is now. I really don't know how to say it, but discovering the show, and this crazy supportive community, you all have been a blessing to me (even though I haven't been active here in a long while), thanks for helping me become a better person. To those who are struggling atm, you just gotta keep on pushing. I know it sounds cliche, but it's true. Just keep persevering to the next day, and the day after that, and just keep finding reasons to keep on going, and even try picking up good habits. When I was down, I walked around my neighborhood, every day, and it ended up helping me a lot because it simply cleared my head. I want y'all to know you aren't alone in this world. My DMs are always open if you just wanna talk. Sorry if this felt like a tangent or I had like zero direction whatsoever, it's hard to get my thoughts onto paper.
Thanks again, everyone. <:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>

I actually had a friend who I am 99% sure was a tankie LARPing as a leftist
idk honestly
Here's mine.
I'm just about done, I'll post mine in a bit
It's okay.
I'm actually gonna try that quiz rn
the disabled in general. Here in Canada, we really don't have much going for us either.
I also have a moderate disability, but I have a higher QOL than most (middle class, 1st world country), so I feel I am not really in a position to comment on such an issue without possibly coming across as condescending.
typically, they deny the Holodomor, and/or Tiananmen Square.
someone who is an outspoken nationalist in support of the USSR and/or China.
It's all good. I only *really* consider Stalinists and Maoists as tankies
My family's in a union (teachers union <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344> )
why can't we just return to monke <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
modern politics in general.
That's why I hate how prevalent tankies are on Reddit
^^^^^^^^^
and a lot of bashing towards other leftists
I also wouldn't advise forming opinions from political Twitch streamers
Reddit and Twitter are enormous echo chambers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
man i want r/gamingcirclejerk to go back to the old days of Toddposting
Reddit period is a circlejerk
Honestly I stay off political Reddit in general.
I think so. I feel there's *a lot* of loaded questions on the LeftValues quiz
I feel 8values is a much better test for shit like this
The wording on loads of questions feels real off
^
Stalinists like saying they're an ML just so they don't have to say they're Stalinist
MLs sometimes fall into this category. depends on the person.
^
It's a crude explanation, but hope it helps
Honestly, that’s why I’m third party above everything else. Both parties in US government feel hella crooked
https://theweek.com/speedreads/964588/manchin-support-democrats-reconciliation-bill-allowing-covid-relief-move-forward-without-gop
Jim Justice, a staunch Republican and Trumper was the outlier who voted for the bill.
No, there was one outlier, Joe Manchin, who wasn’t as at the individual vote, he voted in favor today.
Even their death penalty is far more cruel than most forms, as they’re one of the few places that still executes by hanging.
^
The justice system period, is just fucked up. If you have time, I strongly recommend checking out the show “The World’s Toughest Prisons” on Netflix (iirc it’s available worldwide). Despite the clickbaity title, it is by far one of the most interesting series I’ve ever seen
I remember seeing a *disturbing* video about the Japanese prison system, honestly made me sick.
^
My idelogy is a mix of standard leftism and libertarianism atm
I feel there’s a lot of infighting in political ideologies, especially anarchism, from whatI’ve seen
Gives me a headache sometimes
Politics is hella complex

There is no perfect political system. Every one is bound to have kinks, and there will never, *ever* be an end-all-be-all solution to problems within governments.

On that note: how many days before Navalny mysteriously ends up like Epstein?
Well, you can filter shit through faster if there’s no one to oppose you <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Comparing the US political system to most other countries feels like an apples-to-oranges comparison, mainly based upon the sheer numbers the US has.
^
I definitely agree. The Germans were in a terrible state, and Hitler was an excellent manipulator, and here we are.

well, in the past, most wars were about material stuff. It just changed from land and territory to material goods
That would be nice, but I feel we're nowhere near capabilities for that

Writing fanfiction has actually been helping a lot in just tuning me out because I have so much ideas for the longfic I plan on writing that it actually takes my focus was from the world at hand, if only for a little while.
I just wanna tune out the world once in a while, but it always feels impossible.
well, it's official. I'm now 17 years old. I don't know why, but I feel very scared for the future, like no matter how hard I may try, it just won't be enough. That being said, I have come a long way in the past year (almost a year ago today, ||I was on the brink of attempting suicide from the constant verbal harassment my mom had given me for years|| (TW: suicide)), but I still feel worried, unsure, and downright scared in general. School, while I'm doing well, is a huge struggle due to my mental health, and my mom puts outrageously high expectations on me. She's better than she used to be with me, but it's still an enormous amount of pressure. I guess one thing I want to do over the next year is get better control of my emotions and reduce my time on social media (yes, these two are connected), as I will get borderline enraged at pretty much anything regarding politics because I often get extremely emotional over such issues. One last goal would be to look after myself, I treated myself like shit because I was in a deep depressive episode last year, simply put.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
school's already kicking my ass from stress
ah man the depression is back
Tru
Middle East is where it's most lucrative, you know why they're there.
^
I'd still consider China to be a bigger threat. There are known concentration camps and no one can do a thing about it due to China's sheer influence and power on the global scale.
tru
I haven't had motivation for shit.
I'd say today was a good day for me <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090> 
but it's been a tough bout of depression that recently hit me <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
It’s okay...
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Social Studies (specifically nationalism and our interpretation of it) and English (interpretation of poetry)
What's worse is that these courses could easily determine me getting into college.
My 2 favorite classes in school are both now focusing on a concept I have always struggled with in my life: insight
Well, today wasn't a great day, but at least it's over <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
You and me both

Speaking from someone who used to be involved in the leftist community, nobody hates leftists more than other leftists.
Nobody hates a given political affiliation more than people who are part of that affiliation
Yes

Your health comes before anything and everything else, Stella. Don't worry
Glad I could help! <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I went through a similar problem as you, Stella. About a year back, I won't discuss it here (maybe in DMs), I was also having a lot of problems with my mom, and I felt like I just didn't deserve anything better in my life because I felt I had to work towards it, of which I was not in such a state at the time. However, while it did take a while, I learned to realize that I should be judging my self and self-worth based on what I think, not what others think.

I was just making a comparison to my own life, so I could at least try to relate to you better. Sorry if it came across like I was downplaying your sitch
Yes! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I usually get scared and worried very easily by inadvertently overplaying smaller problems into thinking they're bigger problems. If it helps, I usually take deep breaths, tell myself it's going to be okay, and just think about what makes me happy.

She has an *extremely* short fuse, and will often yell, scream, and berate over minor infractions, alongside constant guilting. The problem is that I can't report what she says, at least for a couple years, because she has a relatively high-paying position in her work, and if she were to lose it, it would create far more problems than it would solve, and I could never bring that upon my sister. Last night, I found out that she was given $5K in high end tech from our city's school board (she's getting an iPhone 12 Pro Max, an iPad Pro, and a high-end laptop), and I just couldn't feel anything but anger. She treats myself and my sister this way, yet her students love her (she's a teacher) and she gets such high-end shit in response. I feel frustrated knowing that the world works this way, and I want to hopefully be able to make a positive difference one day. Until then, I just gotta take that shit one day at a time.
How long is “a little while”?

<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Many societies were hella puritan for a long time. Japan still kind of looks down on the LGBT in society. The USSR *recriminalized* homosexuality during its time as a nation, the UK only decriminalized homosexual acts between 2 males in 1980, and even after, Thatcher existed.
Ah, I see.
I was able to record one of her outbursts lately, so that's something.

I think we both know why it’s gonna get taken down
He mainly played as the Joker (and I hate to admit it, but he did a damn good cosplay too) and said offensive shit on Omegle, a lot. He used to be active on Twitch until he was banned, then Youtube, until he was banned. He ran a fitness channel called Gypsy Fitness for a while up until a little while ago.

Yes and no. Atheism makes up 73% of the Chinese religious population, but that also includes multiple other smaller religions that are local to China, like Confucianism, Taoism, Chinese Buddhism, etc.

I remember staying with a cousin on summer vacation in another province a while back. In his province, there is a huge problem of ultra-rich foreigners investing in properties and just sitting on them, driving up the prices of houses and apartments exponentially. I remember my cousin telling me that his relatively small house cost his family **one million Canadian dollars**
There’s just no winning in the modern real estate world <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
If supply and demand are anything to go by, you’re right. But if far more people are just renting apartments than buying houses, we’ll probably see rent absolutely skyrocket.

This reminds me of when Rieri narrated an episode preview as Emilia *as Megumin* https://youtu.be/HIgkGkZxC2g
Because let's say Aoi
She's not in Re:Zero or KonoSuba
And there's no reason for Clementine to show up (was she even in Overlord's petit series?)
This might be the only case of shared VA in quartet if I remember correctly
Also
All the yes for an official thing that might have Megumin and Emilia interacting
`It's a "petit" world`
at least 40 chapters will be covered in the first 3 eps
and it was confusing even for me that read the manga
meanwhile TG:re had its first ep broadcasted before airing so I already know what to expect
at least Brynhildr didn't look like it when I watched it
>121 chapters in 12 episodes
as a testament to my morbid curiosity, I'm watching Tokyo Ghoul:re Last Chapter
Zombieland Saga has my curiosity pushed to the brink
it looks just like my kind of trash
this season, let's see
I'm personally excited about Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet
I just wanted to take a look at the manga before watching, didn't expect at all to be completely smitten by it
but the whole puppet thing turns me off too much to give it the chance it deserves
I feel like I really should be watching TBF
it's an Urobuchi story
and Aoi is in season 2's cast
wait
I think Alicization might count as isekai
Kirito completely lives inside this new world, right?
I don't think it does anymore
only followed by Kenja no Mago in april
and the next season, apparently
`cull isekai from the anime I regularly watch`
I say that, but it's literally the only isekai airing this season
and then I nonchalantly spoiled myself out of morbid curiosity because *there's absolutely no way it can actually get interesting*, just to find out it eventually takes the character in a direction that's completely unforeseen (IMO)
and then I found out it'd be 2-cour, so if there was any time I'd feel like picking it up, it'd be now
and then I watched the first ep and found it to be just my kind of stupid
but then I found out Ebata was deeply involved
I didn't intend on picking it up purely for trying to cull isekai from the anime I regularly watch
they do not deserve trashing for their terrible writing
i kept the asuna pendant out of mercy

Is [YT] going to  sub the XV episodes as they air?   <@81815015224516608>
Actually, Phantom also has some references to the 6th novel, that's a prelude to the entire series
I just clarified because this little mistake make people think they should watch the 2000 anime first, when it's actually much better to watch the new anime first
I just found the first teaser very ~aesthetics~ and Aoi was voicing the lead
me neither until quite recently
the new Boogiepop anime is a direct adaptation of the first 3 novels
it's set between novels 1 and 2
but just a thing
this isn't "Boogiepop 2"
2000's Boogiepop Phantom is a sort of Boogiepop 1.5 instead
looking forward to Black Fox too, looks awesome!
so I can either expect a fight or an impromptu Petit Milady insert. Or both.
also Manticore is voiced by TKTT
I wake up and see there's a new PV for AOTY 2019 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKwalYCVJZg
Watch a regular rom com whilst twisting again, like you did last summer?
Kotobuki is what y'all should be watching instead of Girly Air Force if you want dogfights
Boogiepop had a rocky start but it seems that this current arc will go a lot more smoothly
as an anime-only I have a bad feeling about Neverland getting an unsatisfying ending since it only has 12 eps
the actually good stuff this season for me has been Kaguya and Mob
meanwhile "the trash I needed" has been Magical Girl Spec Ops Asuka
I'm probably dropping Gotoubun

Twintails had some good moments

A great job by KyoAni
I watched KnK. It was beautiful!

I totally loved Spyce
Good Shows. Must Watch


<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
>Only 
>4 Seasons
Precure
This is too long.
700 episodes?
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Or it contains a decent story?
Does it have the monster of the week format?
Watching the first precure.
Every episode is like the zakenna spirit thing entering into some random object and assuming the role of the MotW.
I'm watching the first precure (8 episodes in), and I can't find any good progress into the story.
Cool.
Any good isekai with FeMC?
<:Kiricoin:495336831978569759>
Why didn't anyone recommend it before​?
Endro is what exactly I needed.
Nanoha was Would-be-friends of the quarter.
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Is it also MotW?
What about Suite precure? It seems popular
Which one is the most popular?
But I think the chemistry nut is more akin to Aoi from Vividred.
But that show had a good story.
Reminds me of Papika and Coconut.
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Looks good.
<@231025503643893770> what's the name of the show?
Its good CGDCT for the teenage soul
Totally loving Machikado mazoku

<@152896851660505088> Definitely did see a huge resemblance there.

If you noticed, Spyce has the crescent-inside-the-eye character design, just like YuruYuri.
Probably not.
Goemon_kicking_open_steel_door.gif
And what about Spyce?
Does Endro count as CGDCT?
Finally I can get some insight on Accelerator and that "Last order" thing.
Season 3?
Rewatching Spyce.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<@231025503643893770> Spoiled it for me!
I always have a couple of other shows on the side so that I won't feel the void as much.

First time I've seen someone refer to Gochiusa as that.
Wow.
Cool
<@256945399338631168>  as "Is the order a rabbit"
(if anyone here has watched the whole thing?)
Is Jashin Chan Dropkick good?
First episode of some anime?
It's a good series, a bit too ambitious at times but very enjoyable
<@87512939107450880> oh I think he wants to share it with other ppl on steam. Do u mind if I dm you?
hi, I know this is strange request but does anyone here have Wallpaper engine? A friend of mine wants to share a wallpaper he made but he's also a bit paranoid and doesn't want to upload an anime wallpaper with his steam account (and I don't have it either). It's a Evangelion wallpaper. I can send u the mp4 file and gif thumbnail. You don't have to credit him, just gimme a ping. Thanks!

Gonna get down to it soon
I actually haven't seen Mob Psycho before
I’m planning on watching Weathering With You soon, as I’ve heard it’s amazingly well done and from what I’ve seen, it looks like a well animated, well sounding tearjerker (A Silent Voice is my personal guilty pleasure, as a 6’1 guy obsessed with action movies most of the time). Should I watch it?
Idk anymore
Same on that <@471416654346321930> . All I got here is a disappointing hockey team and -30 C temperatures
Japan would deadass seem like an awesome place to visit
Theatre! : )
I'm pretty hyped as I'm gonna see my first anime movie this weekend <:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
I'm finally getting down to Your Lie In April after leaving it for like a year
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Just saw Weathering With You and OH MY GOD IT'S AMAZING
Thanks Shirabe
Thanks Shirabe
As much as I love to shit on Fairy Tail, it ain't a half-bad shounen (if you pretend that Mashima didn't completely give up on doing good fights by the final season)
Well, I just pirated the first dub ep and ngl, the dub is actually pretty good.
They currently panicking, but they may either drop it or go all-or-nothing and continue releasing it, but you have to prove that you're eighteen, probably with an extra sign-in in order to watch it.
yet they still did it
dub was still good tho
They realized their stupid mistake too late
I'd say that Funi was just being stupid and trying to cash in on new season anime
That's 2 steps short of literal hentai
I have no idea why they even considered doing that 5Head
Fat OMEGALUL that Funi even started releasing an Interspecies Reviewers dub before it got pulled
Thanks Shirabe
**EXTREME SEX**
yeah this ep audibly made me go "what the actual fuck"
I almost feel like the beginning was inadvertently poking a bit of fun at what Funimation did
God the new Interspecies Reviewers
Nothing in particular.  I'm very new to the medium, so I'm looking to expand my palate.  Something friendly to newcomers I suppose?
Is this the place I would go to come and get reccomendations for what to watch? I have quite a bit of free time these days.
I am sure I will find out sooner or later.
Mr. Weeaboo?  What does that mean?
However, I do not like Patrick's character.  He is quite the hothead, and in my experience hotheads don't last too long on the battlefield.
I think Sergei Smirnov is my favorite character.  At least for the time being.  That might change in the future.
I know the series came out in 2007.  Has the quality of anime changed that much in thirteen years?
I just finished the first few episodes of Mobile Suit Gundam 00.  My initial impressions of it are that it is definitely a product of its time.  The romanticized vision of globalization is very interesting.  And the influences of the War in Iraq are apparent.  The idea that countries relying on fossil fuels would be left behind as the rest of the world moves on to a near infinite source of renewable energy is definitely a nice touch, and it fits back into the themes of the Iraqi War I mentioned beforehand.  However, I do find Celestial Being's mission quite paradoxical.  Responding to violence with more violence is only going to bring about more violence.  They have made an enemy of the entire world.  With Celestial Being's overwhelming technological advantage it is going to push the world into a new arms race.  I only see this ending with Celestial Being failing.  I could be very wrong though.
OH BOY
lmao
you'll get lynched

<:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>

you see anime new Dragon Quest: Dai no Daibouken (2020)
here all anime?
Here’s mine
KiraKira, Smile, or Heartcatch are the best starters imho
Hope this helps!
<@!509335685791088661> Can't find anything too similar, sry.
Here's an idea of what each of the seasons are like:
Futari wa Precure (2004): Very similar to W in a sense imho
Futari wa Precure Max Heart (2005): Don't watch unless you finished and enjoyed Futari wa.
Futari wa Precure Splash Star (2006): Basically Futari wa, but more well done imo
Yes! Precure 5 (2007): I think you'd enjoy this, the beginning of where Precure started to feel like Sentai.
Yes! Precure 5 GoGo! (2008): Don't watch, period. It is **not** a good season.
Fresh Precure (2009): Themed around fruits, so I guess you can find minor parallels to Gaim, but overall it's not a bad season.
Heartcatch Precure (2010): Themed around flowers, an excellent starter season imo
Suite Precure (2011): Themed around music, don't know too much sry
Smile Precure (2012): Themed around fairytales. If you like Saber so far, I think you'll like this.
Doki Doki Precure (2013): Themed around cards. You'll probably like this if you liked Blade.
Happiness Charge Precure (2014): Themed around the world and culture. I personally think of it as similar to Boukenger.
Go Princess Precure (2015): Themed around royalty. Another great starter season from what I've heard.
Mahoutsukai Precure (2016): Themed around magic. Basically, if you liked Magiranger/Wizard, you'll like this.
KiraKira Precure A La Mode (2017): Themed around animals and sweets. I would personally also consider it a great starter.
HUGtto Precure (2018): Basically the Precure equivalent of Gokaiger or Zi-O.
Star Twinkle Precure (2019): If you liked Kyuranger/Fourze, you'll *love* this.
Healin' Good Precure (2020): Themed around nature and medicine. Think Ex-Aid without the video game motif.
Tropical Rouge Precure (2021): The new season, starts this Sunday, actually!
Netflix is releasing both at the same time but aight
I was hyperbolic
Netflix rights are wacky
Netflix is gonna release before BD, they have international home release rights
There are only camrips <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Just found out that the Violet Evergarden movie isn’t gonna release in my country until Netflix release the dub in like 5 years
I ended up binging a lot of anime yesterday, alongside Chunibyo. I watched High-Rise Invasion on Netflix, and it wasn't bad, just there's lots of fan service. I don't see myself rewatching it any time soon, but it was a fun experience, I'll give it that.
tru
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
but apparently according to a Korean distributor, the movie will not be releasing on Netflix before May.
they signed a dubbing agreement
yep
Cuz they have official streaming rights
Guess I'm waiting for Netflix to release it
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
It's only getting a US release, I've checked all over.
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
It's not releasing in my country (🇨🇦 )
yea
I'm holding off on a rewatch until the movie releases because KyoAni said that the movie serves as the finale to the series
First one for me was Dragon Maid (need to rewatch that), then Violet Evergarden (for the love of god can the movie release here faster)
And don't get me started on ||Rikka finally coming to terms with her dad's death||
The scene where ||Yuta just berates Sanae as she breaks down in front of him|| was really hard to watch <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
The whole 2nd half of the season I binged.
watched it blind.
I cried all night at the Love Chunibyo S1 finale
man
Fifa sucks for me. It looks the same almost every version.
Of Rem's taking over the world? XD
Is this the day?
Too many Rem's.
<:PharaBlush:741631423999639673>
I started to read Chainsaw Man. I expect great things to come.
true
but yeah many of my friend complaint about that
I don't really have a problem with Aoi Yuuki in many anime
only 2 animes that I finished watching
I don't really watch much anime now
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I'm really conflicted, like I know it's Aoi Yuuki but it's not song from Symphogear
I remember that I lose my point in amq because her insert song in gundam build fighter
Kiara
god

<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

Duel in the moon
and Nichijou and Asobi Asobase
I can't really watch other anime beside Geah and ZLS
charms of the old animation
oh ye
how bad was it?
Interesting
I noped out
"that" scene
oh yeah
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
oh right
is Mark Twain the first person that write an Isekai story?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
The Big O is good.
Looks like it has a dub, I'll give it a shot.
I haven't taken a hard look at the case yet.
If it is available to me, dubbed.
I plan on watching it this weekend.
Excellent.
Has anyone here seen The Big O?
I have a soft spot for diesel punk.
Good stuff.
I finished the first season of The Big O.
dragon ball super: heroes
just call it heroes
it's dragon ball super
it can be helped
crunchyroll has rights to 95% of anime released outside of japan but somehow still can't convince toei to rename dragon ball super super heroes
~~all of his stuff looks the exact same though~~
everyone in that universe took "inject porn into my veins" a bit too literally apparently
no they need to milk ip for all their worth
rip sparkle man
what if they go self-aware and she wears black censorbars as clothing
actually how come there hasn't been an anime about the heavenly rays of censorship yet
~~or just have a lot of the heavenly rays of censorship~~
or just skip straight to it being a dvd/blu-ray release and not air it on tv
with the internet i'm sure they could distribute anything
interspecies reviewers exists. kinda
well spy classroom is getting an anime and that light novel plays around with you not being able to see every detail in a text-based medium so uhhh they can make anything an anime if they want money
when i ring your doorbell 37 times at 3am and then run away
~~although granted that's basically what i write but i will also never call myself a good writer~~
yeah i have no problems with isekai stuff but i do have problems with randomly overpowered protagonist who can solve any problem because plot
🤷
||resurrecting shalltear probably cost a solid chunk of that||
although that did happen before he had a steady source of income so i guess he was just being stingy
fair
also ||if he didn't resurrect/save arche then it makes sense to me that he didn't care about clementine||
||they're not npcs so who cares i guess?||
||it'd take too much money?||
it has aoi yuuki as a murderous woman who completely disappears ||after she dies|| and they still haven't canonically explained it
can't believe you're shit talking overlord smh
forget about higurashi, the real stand out here is isekai quartet featuring youjo senki, overlord, and some other series that aren't as good
power traingers in lab coats, the most unassuming anime girl, and..... a pokemon?
there is a lot going on here
still waiting for someone to license hakuchouki so i can read that ln <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
oof
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
~~assassination classroom was also decent imo~~
gintama is the exception
that's true! ~~shonen jump isn't good no matter the medium! <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>~~
anime really is just the worse versions of light novels and manga
anyway overlord is good <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
i don't remember when stuff was adapted
or do you mean overlord
i didn't enjoy reincarnated as a slime s1 so i didn't watch s2 <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
so he's just kinda fumbling his way through
and ainz is dumb
ok i don't either but i think overlord gets around it (at least the light novels) by focusing more on the politics than the fighting
do not listen to ayaya
no it's good
||she accidentally starts a cult worshipping ainz after becoming convinced that he's a better ruler than the holy kingdom people. except she's just brainwashing people and not realizing it||
true

i hope season 4 animates the best character
which part
yeah because the npcs pressure him to be duh
||to be fair he at least let the lizard people live,,,||
~~also the light novel is better ;P~~
well that's because season 4 isn't out yet
i think most people genuinely believe anything below 9 is awful
||i was gonna say that you can't top a god so it makes sense but i think homura does that in rebellion||

i hope the next madoka movie lets sayaka be badass again. she had the best moment in magia record anime
wonder what that point would be for me <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
then she will explode and maybe give us some useful items
maybe we should hit her with a crowbar just in case
true
she is not a headcrab or a suzudaru cat. she is safe. for now
Hikari vs. the Suzudaru Cat Headcrabs
i can just keep this image open on my computer while i insult myself

thought you said bed time with a gun
||but the main reason i think she's telling the truth about her talent being time travel-related is because i think they're gonna have nana find jin and he's going to use her talent to try to fix shit. like send nana back before the time-skip to stop the warehouse from blowing up or (like i said) going back to the beginning of the series. we still don't know where jin is or really what exactly happened in those three years besides the basic "tsuruoka 'won'" idea, and that seemed very... not talentless nana-y in how they handled it imo||
||oh i didn't even consider the idea that saeki doesn't remember her own timeloops||
||like there's 100% the possibility that saeki is drawing the tally on nana||
||but i kinda have a feeling saeki is telling the truth about time travel, just not the _entire_ truth. like i think her ability only lets her time travel and  there's some side-effect relating to why she wanted the top bunk ||
||this is true||
||saeki wouldn't know about fuuko being ready to commit suicide though so she could have intended to let her go and follow nana to see what she'd do||
||but no i think she either did die in this loop or she just hanged herself and is still barely alive||
||fuuko sorano||
||true and i think they're focusing specifically on that one car almost hitting nana/kyoya for a reason||
||i think it's more so that they don't do a haruhi endless eight situation and just repeat moments with very slight differences and they could instead do plot. especially since only one chapter comes out every month||
||i've been thinking saeki's time travel talent is gonna be used to eventually send nana back to the beginning of the series and if they're not gonna repeat the day again and have fuuko stay dead then i am 100% sure this is what's gonna happen. especially since it'd fuck nana up so hard seeing michiru again||
NANA FUCKED UP BIG TIME
YO WE GOT SOME TALENTLESS NANA FANS HERE????
fortunately, so the people behind it don't get too overworked, but unfortunate for us since we have to wait lol
well
once a month unfortunately

my favourite flip flappers character is that au version of papika that shows up for a second in that one episode and then goes bluhbluhbluhbluhb and melts away
they flip and they flap and then there's a banger ending theme
looks like an upside-down armadillo-spinning top hybrid thing
oh
why is it standing on a spinning top(?)
coward
i mean 🏴‍☠️
well you can play its sequel in english legally but there are ways to patch an english tl for chaos;head too
the vn comes out on switch in english in october. wait to play that and chaos;child - their animes just ruin the experience completely

yes

why are these kids monsters
why does his brother have strawberry-tipped horn hair and shark teeth
why does that kid have horn hair and shark teeth
hatsune miku
eh i've heard of worse
~~they also made my least favourite anime series, rising of shield hero~~
my jittle pony
why does that middle kid have no teeth
ok but urameshi though
he's the gay guy who they made straight for some reason
if there is a new new hakusho then they need to make kuwabara gay
~~konosuba really is the japanese family guy. or japanese rick and morty~~
~~konosuba isn't good but it's not even the worst of the series in isekai quartet lmao~~
mood
they kinda shove like 6 episodes into the last like 2
i like angel beats a lot but i wouldn't say it's an 11 because it's kind of a mess plot-wise
skyla from pokemon black and white. and you're probably right

and thus it was proven: heroines can not run the show <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
til the overlord wiki uses the same template for the author as they do characters so
she is a fashion disaster

and Offspring is absolutely timeless
a friend of mine plays this and other JSRF songs almost always when he fires up our server's bot

nicalis did him dirty
i replayed cave story like a month ago because i got my best friend into it and now Hell only took me less than a week to do with me treating it casually
months upon months upon months when i was like 16 playing through the same damn level again and again
how firmly engrained this song is in my mind, only few can comprehend
`An old friend...`

been also listening repeatedly to the new Overlord OP and this 2hu song a friend recommended https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4GthFnxn5U

Yeah
Sounds like a good time
Because it felt lively
By the last 5 songs they were already closing the bar so I just kept it around club and dance
Was talking to a friend of mom's that also liked Offspring
When I listed the bands that were my favorites during specific moments in my life, I mentioned Ling Tosite Sigure and thus played Enigmatic Feeling to show their sound
It emptied up real quick so then I mostly ran through songs according to the conversation
No matter the bar's theme (most are just botecos)
Most patrons will just want to listen to the crap you often find in a brazilian bar
nice
That was up until California Dreamin
i see...
I was just keeping a slower pace until most patrons (mostly my family since it was 2 birthdays) left in their ubers so I could rock out more with friends including the waiters
where will this be located
spanish song definitely wont work out
true faith might not fit the aesthetic well, very boppy/80s synth percussion
moonlight shadow is good
take me home country roads is a good fallout reference to match the era style if you're feeling cheeky
youll want songs that evoke nostalgia
aight
super retro then
mmmm
Hipster vintage
Like beer labels, 50s pinup, framed pictures of superheroes and villains on the wall
80s vintage, old folksy vintage
what kinda vintage we talkin
<@456226577798135808>  more like a pub I'd say
It has quite the vintage aesthetics
Do a version with the full song and we'll talk
like what kind
what bar is your cousin running



Got to pick songs for my cousin's bar after midnight again
Compare and contrast the Puerto Rican national anthem, with the Cuban national anthem
If you look up countries that have been influenced by other countries, you'll see anthems that bear resemblance to the country doing the influence
Now, here's where they blend in terms of the cultural bit: some national anthems blend depending on their origins
Now, in comparison with say, the Soviet national anthem, you have a strong classical orchestra coupled with strong lyrics, since the aim is to demonstrate the might of the union
The US national anthem, for example, is a very cut and dry band piece, because it's not designed for any culture in mind; it is designed solely to evoke the historical imagery of the past
Sometimes national anthems align to the genre most appropriate to what the nature of the country demands
The style aligned towards it's culture
The subject must always be espousing the tenets of the nation in question
They have to be catchy, memorable, and most importantly, easy to engrain into someone's head
The only difference between a song and a national anthem is that the latter is designed solely for the sake of evoking patriotism

4. Days Go By
5. Ignition
6. Smash
7. Splinter
8. Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace
9. The Offspring
```
been listening to a lot of Offspring lately and felt the need to rank the albums

Probably some prose about how they are the star that shines brightest
Yeah that works
*nature
*nature
Sometimes the patriotism of one country extends to another country by mature of history
If you listen to them, you'll notice the Puerto Rican national anthem more closely reflects it's culture within the genre most popular in the country, while Cuba, who shares similar cultural details musically, have a more cut and dry anthem more closely resembling the Soviet anthem

yeah the music definitely sounds like it's from a bad party game lol

Instead of it's Bonus content.
But, wouldn't they have put that in the show itself.
I mean, I would love that.
I don't know. Maybe?
There's a reason why they didn't do it in the show.
That's my wish for the last shinai.
That is what i also wish to happen but with just Shem Ha and the last half is Miku waking up, getting to a helicoptor, flying to Yggissill and leaping out of the helicoptor then signing her activation chant before it fades to black with her song in the credits.
Wher da basa
Ight, be back in a couple days
well weebs it's time to learn Japanese
did not know there were no subtitles yet
woah
Thanks
Just wondering, are there any links to XV shinai 2 yet? There was one posted on this server this morning and the link's dead. Any other links available?
yeah, you need to save up coins and get yourself a theme deck from the store
my god...
of the ones you have
borne of fire is the deck with the highest damage output
arguably the best 3 theme decks before sun and moon decks came into play

i forgot that the majority of the challenges i did with trainer challenges was done with these three bad boys
i looked through the theme decks you have and they are frankly trash.
wow
ive never really thought about it, huh
in theory, you could say that healing scarf is supposed to heal 20 damage, but because there was nothing to heal, the state of healing itself was not executed due to it being a zero-sum thing, which means seaking's added attack damage isnt triggered
i guess if no damage was erased, it doesnt count as a heal, even though healing scarf heals 20 damage, since the act of healing involves eliminating damage
hmmmm
anyway... let me read healing scarf's text
i keep sending messages and it keeps not letting me send.
EAT SHIT DISCORD
FUCK YOU DISCORD
fuck you discord.
mmmmmmm, not exactly; the issue is that trainer cards that heal dont allow healing if there's no damage
mmmmmmm, not exactly; the issue is that trainer cards that heal dont allow healing if there's no damage
mmmmmmm, not exactly; the issue is that trainer cards that heal dont allow healing if there's no damage
it shouldnt, soaking horn works if it was healed before attacking
which is great
very, very stupid
the ai is stupid
like, literally; if its not a trade, it wont send.
because in the wild world of ptcgo, i cant send you anything without trading for it
personally i would open them just to stack up on more cards since your collection is thin and you'd want some tradeable cards even if theyre junk so i can send you cards when you need em
please eat shit, discord.
as for the dragons exalted packs, it all depends on how the current public trades are looking; otherwise youd need to make a trade, and trades cost coin (and youd need to think of what to trade for)
as for the dragons exalted packs, it all depends on how the current public trades are looking; otherwise youd need to make a trade, and trades cost coin (and youd need to think of what to trade for)
plus coins to build towards getting more packs or theme decks
12 trainers in each league, 3 leagues means 36 free packs
each trainer, when their stars are maxed out, gives you a pack
i reccomend beating the shit out of those nerds and stealing their pokemon cards.
that means that the packs for them havent been taken
also
test
oh my god
also trading them unless the public trades look like shit
this, or are there no stars

do they look like...
your trainer challenges
wait, question
oh yeah thats old, ive got one too
open 'em anyway, you've got a strong defecit of cards unless you want to trade the packs for cards
mmmmmmm
oh! thats pretty good
if the packs are locked, feel free to open em
whaaaat the heeeeeell
...you dont even have theme decks?
though a handful have an ex card or two in their deck these days. not that theyre competent enough to use them
the ai is still as stupid as ever
now its just full starring them, which doesnt take a lot of time, and the decks you have will slice the ones theyre using like paper
trainer challenges have changed; they used to be sorted by difficulty
if it reset, take advantage of it
question: have you done the trainer challenges? like, beating up the AI for packs?
puts you at a bit of an advantage, especially with having that greninja
a good chunk of these cards come from the starter decks you got when you first registered
tch. you even have the ninetails ive been looking for.
god, that takes me back.
you have satan's conkeldurr.
oh.
oooh, circle circuit raichu
you also have some old ass cards
you have some nice cards
if you email them you might, i think i know which one you're talking about
one thing ill warn you is that some people pop in with some ultra-obscure ass theme decks; the kind of theme deck that has good cards that few people have. but youll mostly be expecting sun and moon theme decks to be the norm here
the rewards for theme decks are looking pretty okay, too
since ptcgo does 3 matches consecutively to win due to pairing everyone off; winners face each other, and the the remaining two face off in a final match
like, two whole tournaments
i think its actually 6 matches so in theory if you win two you're set
go for it
oh wow, speaking of evolutions, i just got a free pack of it now
_glares at rngesus_
there's only one being in the world to blame for this
i know
though in your case itd be beneficial to have em
(also its the one that sucks the most because there's hardly anything good in it besides the ex's/breaks, and a good chunk of the ex's are reprints)
this was basically the final xy relevant sent to send off xy as a whole before sun and moon kicked in
as well as a send off of the xy set
its because the evolutions set is the anniversary reprint of all the old card art
you'd be better off getting all the free cards you can get without touching the elo and then striking hard and burying them into dust.
facing people now without a decent pool of cards to make a deck from or lack of decks will start easy at first but as you keep winning against people who play /worse/ than the ai, your elo will go up, and so too will the competence of the average player you go up against.
and the occasional random booster or two
free tournament tickets (usually 1-4)
they usually consist of free coins (variants range between 25/50/100, before you could get 375 coins randomly but that was a bug that stuck around until the daily rewards got updated)
the daily rewards pale in comparison to 36 free packs
youll have a better net benefit beating up the nerds for now, until you've reamed them of every booster pack
plus its to your benefit to have the latest trainers, which are either reprints of old meta cards already, or totally new cards that are immensely useful
there are other good theme decks but for your current purposes you're better off focusing on the latest cards because they have been scaled to be even stronger than the xy series
id suggest the latest lunala one.
hella
and i have spares that i can hand you
battle compressor is a key card for expanded thats still used to this day
at least until you get battle compressor, which is like 2/3 wins away
okay, listen, you should definitely focus on the versus rewards ladder for a little bit
oh my god
if you make enough progress and stack enough successive wins you may even be able to burn through the first phase of the vs rewards and get some specific cards/coins/boosters
id definitely go with mental might.
mental might is good for strong attackers, though these days thanks to the latest sun and moon decks, you may find it an uphill battle. your elo should be low enough where that isnt a problem yet due to your account basically being trapped in time while everyone else who could bury it being too high to ever match with you.
now i remember.
ahhhhhh
let me refresh my memory with mental might
also...
the good news is that when you get 12 wins on a theme deck you buy from the store against the AI with individual ai trainers, you get an additional theme deck
and wasnt how it used to be at all
that is so stupid.
https://www.reddit.com/r/ptcgo/comments/5fgu74/how_do_i_get_the_fourth_star_in_trainer_challenge/
you're still stuck with only 3 default decks, which means to get the fourth one, you need to spend coins to get a theme deck
okay, so, apparently, you get a star for each time you defeat a trainer with a /unique/ deck
this is so stupid, i cant believe they changed it to be like this
oh, no, i see the problem
should have maxed out your stars by now
that
unless your client is bugged for some reason
like 2-3 times
youve got to face them repeatedly to get all stars
I remember there was a specific formula but I dunno if it was preserved from the old point system days
Maxing out damage will help get more stars
All the card packs you get from the ai are gonna be trade locked but it'll be a lot of cards
Oh my god you've got a point
Hella
How goes beating up the AI and being treated to their horribly corny lines
I live
sleep time, night
helps you stock up on newer cards and plain lunala can obliterate most of everything the ai can send.
the lunala theme deck is your best bet
steam siege is the least valuable of the three (its still a good set) so feel free to open that one
_scratches head_
that is quite a spread
oh, wow
and then the fighting types just straight up murder the other colorless
heheh. one hit koing lunala with pangoro...
would be interesting to show up to theme deck tournaments with dark hammer
i had a feeling that this deck would crop up a lot but jesus christ
oh thank god
like literally the same exact deck
has it all really been the same deck
the rewards right now should be the latest sun and moon packs. you could technically trade those for rarer cards, but i reccomend opening one to at least have tradeable junk cards around so i can send you `the good shit`
oh shit thats good
wait what round is this
thats true
`It's been over three thousand years...`
`humbled king is about to live up to his name`
salazzle can finish that off though; ive been meaning to experiment with that card, but there's a specific ninetails ive been wanting to get my hands on...
the devil's mirror match
like after sun and moon released
that one was recently culled from the store
this is the yveltal from said set

was it called destruction rush?
whatever it is, it predates anything in the store right now
i... let me check
mainly because those old cards are hard to get these days. theyre not sold publicly over the ptcgo client; they occasionally crop up in deals and in random booster rewards
assuming they have half a brain and still have whatever contents of what you had before saved /somewhere/, hopefully by bugging them they should give it back
hm
this thread dates back around a year ago
http://forums.pokemontcg.com/topic/48292-cant-see-your-collection-steps-to-fix/
i found something while looking for something else
...interesting
i dont know where to fetch the logs- see, despite whatever changes have happened in forever, the one thing ptcgo does is do notifications of logs that you made x purchase with y amount of coins over a given deck
tch
in fact...
id still point out to them in the email that you have these random ancient cards to corroborate the fact that the game stripped these decks from you
hmmm
do you remember any old starter decks that had an old ampharos in it
yeah thats the weird part
consist of cards that are still standard for now
"Aurora Blast, Stone Heart, Iron Tide"
so all of these:
its double crisis onwards
roaring skies is also still standard
oh no ancient origins is still standard
i dont recall if ancient origins is in expanded by now
but the specific cards should be in expanded now... i think
anything ancient origins and onwards should be expanded by now, though theme decks are exempt from being marked as legacy/expanded/standard stuff because they exist in their own category of theme deck;  by that logic, anything old and new counts as long as its a theme deck for that category
let me check
yeah, you really need to bug them because if you get these decks back you may be able to cobble something together and do stuff in the legacy format
oh my god that is old.
green tornado...
give them hell
theyre weirdly obscure, its always annoying
http://forums.pokemontcg.com/
the only place i can think of is the forums
yeah you should email the ptcgo staff about it because that salamence was useful back in the days when i relied on it
i forgot thats another deck where that articuno pops up
ohhhhhhh
but whats weird is that- the cards you showed me, that list? the base cards you currently have, are cards that are derived from those theme decks
basic red and basic yellow were also great
basic blue.
***SYMPHOGEAR***
THIS DECK, MY HAND, IS...
no, you're right, thats exactly how it goes
_checks script_
blastoise ex
also thank you for shoving another evolutions pack down my throat, ptcgo
that yvetal is common in dark acceleration decks
note to self: next time try out with destruction rush
and NOW i get the dark pokemon i need
shit.
oh
time to put by dark hammer deck theory to the test
lunala
i go in, first deck i face
decided to try out a theme deck tournament
that is one of the few mercies it grants
ptcgo always starts opening packs with the locked pack first
i didnt get to grow up with nintendo consoles or pokemon games outside of the tcg
i get that a lot
ive never played the handheld games

https://youtu.be/XhWul0562YY
i hate the vast majority of the characters and mostly find myself just enjoying some of the side characters more
but its frankly atrocious
i feel one of the things that just wore me down with the series was the writing. i usually feel more motivated to continue on with a game if its long and has a bunch of things to learn if the writing is good
i just hate the nep neps. i played all through rb;1 and then the majority of rb;2 before i get fed up grinding those love connections or what have you
i can see you liking the designs alice
Of the candidates I like uni the least but I like her infinitely more than noire
Noire is the one I hate the most
I hate the core goddesses though I hate nep the least from them
The game play is eh
I'll explain it all another time but it boils down to not liking much of the characters or the plot
Many, many reasons
Also I personally hate nepneps as a whole
THAT FISH IS A GOOD MAN

Cyber dimension confirmed the Dark Souls of the nep series
`Now you know...`
the reason why i played it in the first place was because a bunch of ex-friends pushed me to do it
yeah
goddamnit
...thats probably why she's set up that way, isnt it
but it just felt nice to have my thoughts of "wow, this is so stupid" acknowledged in-game at least. which is probably what led to me liking her to begin with.
i guess its true
and then IF would push on that and i'd go "oh, thank GOD. truly, you're a goddamn blessing."
it all felt forced and dumb and tropey to nonsensical degrees
in my case I liked it because for me i felt the ridiculousness was poorly written and contrived in a way where it was like, they would jump from either really badly done shoehorned references or just really stupid jokes that either made no sense or were poor in execution with no character building or fleshing out or any development whatsoever
but in rb;1 she is basically the sole sane person
they do take the piss on her later on in other games though
i know this, but specifically the one who had the biggest influence in the game being `the smartest and the most competent in the group` was a little too ego strokey for me
literally every time something would happen and i would roll my eyes, she would roll her eyes with me, and it was probably the most reassuring thing ever
admittedly i find it sorta obnoxious that the most competent team mate is also `the company's self insert` but she was just, like
Compa grew on me
IF is my favorite
there were characters i did like
but yeah if you can stomach the writing (which some can do effectively because `tiddy`) then its... enjoyable-ish
new game plus
oh right
i looked up the true ending.
i got the normal ending
r;b1's endings arent that different, they just have slightly different results
yeah
someone actually even made me a chart complete with where and when i should save should i be insane enough to get them all in one playthrough
i think the true ending does need lily ranks
i wanted to do the lily ranks to get a better end and see the other shit since a good chunk of the rest of the game is behind that general path, and yeah
LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE HAD AN EASIER TIME BUT MEANWHILE I SHOVE 3 TRINKETS TO HELP MAX THAT SHIT OUT UP YOUR ASS AND YOU HARDLY EVEN BUDGE!
i think rb;2 has the worst of the grind because of ***FUCKING NOIRE WHO JUST /CANT/ RAISE HER HEART POINTS WITH PEOPLE EASILY BECAUSE SHE'S JUST GOTTA BE TSUNDERE AS HELL***
`Grinding.`
grinding
not the best thing in the world but- yes
the mechanics were pretty alright
i hate the core goddess cast with a passion
Steins;Gate 1
now you gotta beat the next one

```Morality in Media was launched by an interfaith group of clergy in the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1962 after grade school children were caught with hardcore pornography. MIM was first formed by Father Morton A. Hill, Rabbi Julius Neumann, and Rev. Robert Wiltenburg (a Lutheran pastor) as a neighborhood organization under the name Operation Yorkville.[6] They were soon joined by Rev. Constantine Volaitis of the Greek Orthodox Church.```
it is the typical religious conservative crowd who are exploiting the nature of political correction and twisting it against itself tactfully to continue their agenda

so remaking kanto and going "now you'll have the g1 experience with ALL THE POKEMON YOU CAUGHT IN POKEMON GO" is like
yeah looking at this it really does scream "we want to own these people and induct them into the franchise proper" because a lot of people who play Go dont fully know what pokemon is or have only a cursory knowledge of the pokemon world
and it makes sense itd be a trip back to kanto for recruiting this userbase
the much powerful, more reliable console
it seems more a means to utilize Go and transfer the userbase over, because its giving you the option to transfer the pokemon on your phone to the console
it doesnt seem to be
this sounds like educating the remaining playerbase of pokemon go and inducting them proper into the Pokemon franchise proper with something that transitions them from their current medium
this seems to be bigger than just throwing go a bone
the closest we'll ever get to fat pikachu
it looks like a diluted pokemon dungeon

https://twitter.com/RobotBrush/status/1001529962363543554
to be honest i thought for a moment it was gonna do pokemon go on the switch but that probably involves some weird legal stuff with niantic and switches arent phones
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T PORT OVER MY NON GEN-1 LEGENDARIES?"
i literally have 3 groudons and 6 kyogres
if thats the case then it will probably flop because the appeal of porting over pokemon from go to here extends to... everyone. all the pokemon. go is filled with so many legendaries of those eras.
pokemon go went up to... gen 3 or 4?
but im actually curious if this game takes in non-kanto pokemon
honestly, if i had a switch, id be tempted to get this purely to port over the assload of legendaries my dad pumped into my go account
yeah, after my vacation
flatkachu
ten
its honestly pretty diabolical and if my dad gets wind of this and gets a switch im eating my hat collection
because thats now a shitload of legendaries `that you can carry over to another game`
i wouldnt be surprised if account values for pokemon go went up for people who have a shitload of legendaries
and advertising that you can transfer your old pokemon go pokes into this game is very blatantly a move for people who long since gave up on it
the main demographic of people who play pokemon go are usually early teens to late twenties, which is the exact same overlap as people who likely have a switch. the shift to molding the switch into a hybrid mobile/fixed console coupled with using pokemon go to reinvigorate the franchise previously before sun/moons release pretty much plays perfectly into their hands with this
wien, you big silly: the agebase of people who have pokemon go likely already have a switch to begin with
which, honestly? is probably the plan
itd be really funny actually to see people move in from pokemon go into this game and then get a main installment pokemon game and go "wow, what an upgrade! you actually fight the pokemon with your own pokemon first, to catch them!"
`its almost like this is very blatantly a bridge to hitch the pokemon go crowd in line with their consoles`

"Hey Master! You ready to go down to get some hamburgers at the local cafeteria? I've got the rare special Heinz red-white-and-blue color dyed mustard/ketchump/mayo combo just for you!"
i usually assume the absolute worst so seeing that dialouge is like "okay, also stop calling me master"
thats better than my expectations at least
"I have a secret only you can know, Master!~ I'm not wearing any panties underneath this dress. *giggle*"
thats true
the only reason i dont play gfl is because it runs poorly on my emulator
gameplay is definitely superior though
but gfl is straight up tiddies out waifu sim
with fate at least the characters vary and their personalities have lots of variation on who they are, so i have a little less shame having it on my phone since i can go "haha these are historical people" and joke about it
thats what put me off from gfl for a long while

its why INFERNO COP is so fun despite it being so low effort
easily recognizeable silhouttes and characters are all about good design
aint a bad thing
trigger's all about the easily identifable mc or female mascot, or both
cast was probs too generic
ive always wanted to watch kiznavier because i liked the idea conceptually
this is true
but not revisitable, for me
it was fun
like i enjoyed it
i dont look back on klk a lot to go "i sure do miss that show"
but also i dont feel its on the par of what trigger's made that was memorable
i mean it is
i mean i dont fault them
_throws them out the window, holds up klk_
_holds up all of trigger's most successful/recent ips_
it just feels so strange of all the things theyve got going for them theyd go "you know what we're doing after this incredibly recent and well recieved little witch academia game?"
yeah!
like
its EXTREMELY late
yeah
yeah
but the timing feels extremely wrong
the show is very video game like
like i can see WHY theyd make it a game
