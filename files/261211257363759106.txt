hi
the worst for her
yeah this ep was just
pfft
oh
basa?
was literally just the kotatsu and a closet
it was really small
or 6
was it 4.5 tatamis
tehepero
well yeah
yeah
run down af house
also, look at where he lives
he's still a shithead
cause it was clear theyre not trying to redeem him or anything
topdad was actually pretty interesting

knowing sympho theyre gonna come back and job for hibiki later on
presumably
even if it was just the same one from ep 2 or whatever
the song was hype af though
what if you wanted to 
have your sunshine
but god said
"humans disgust me"
damn the sound that fall made was really gruesome
but
obviously not because fonikku gayn
that fall sounded like it fucking shattered everything in her spine
and its a relic now
4 millenium time skip epilogue
like
oh my mind thought forward
LMAO
also i didnt notice but i hope that motherfucker's tie never went out of the pocket
FINALLY
genjuurou fucking fought
even if he jobbed
also the one thing i was absolutely desperately hoping for happened this ep
lmao is that really how it went
did mom just fucking pick them up from an alleyway
but like, how did they go from orphan -> fine candidate
somewhere
by someone
maybe i heard wrong but i remember it being said that we'd find out in this season
also, will we ever get the story of how kiri and shirabe were orphaned
LMAO
exactly weeb
also idk how any shippers can complain about the tsubasa and maria stuff, i think slapping tsubasa in the face was probably the gayest thing short of using airgetlam as a strap on
maybe not milaarc and iforgothernamebutsheskanaichinose de arimasu
imo vanessa is gonna come back
no way theyre gone forever though
the dude who killed her dad is her dad
also yknow
pay attention to the lyrics here

welp something else for ep 10 then
didnt he go ssj at the end
i doubt it
that
oh
just change your trend-
probs one of the keywords
adult
isnt sympho one of the most lucrative late night franchises
probably
oh in jp
nah today's a k-pop boy's birthday, that aint happening
lol
golden saint-germain stand
oni ni naru
ðŸ˜­
the three of them were, for that matter
she was already poisoned by the tomato juice
but her blood
thank you lol
elsa right
milaarc and fuck im sorry whats her name, are totally dead imo
they got blasted by kaminochikara
absolute kino
also the shot of vanessa being decapitated using her head's perspective
the three of them
but yeah for right now theyre 100% dead
that image hurts
oh god
this is the kazanaris
it's a little bit of a toxic worldview but
well i think the monster part is referring to patricide
what do you mean melua
LOL
ðŸ˜­
the context behind it
like of all things
god i cant believe they tweeted that shot out before the ep
avoiding all of this
if they werent excited about beef stroganoff, miku would have died of hunger
lmao
