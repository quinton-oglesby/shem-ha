I'll work on it when I get home but this for MilaarcIntensifies emote?
Okay well that isn't much bigger
<:GenjuLUL4:664481414795886652>

Idk why feels a bit small...
Outer Glow essentially makes it pop off the page a little
<:GenjuLUL2:664476488963457024>
Literally just saw the the face in the book just now. And thought it was funny and should be an emote.
I just redid this version
HM... Whoever made the emote made it pretty tiny...
Oh....

Wait which server??
Still needs cleaning up
Maybe note yet
Oh actually
New Emote
Some of us know about it.
Good to finally see the Symphocast guy here
Well that's a name I haven't heard in a while.
What's an Asmo? And should we be worried?
THE CLONE WARS HAVE BEGUN
Welcome
<a:RageChris:555851696908271660>
YOU'RE HERE TOO NOW?
<@439713581919895554> WHAT?
YES

Next year hopefully I'm gonna try doing Genderbend Hibiki Tachibana and Shoto Todoroki as well as bringing back Hajime Hinata and Nagisa Shiota.
Gotta start somewhere. My advice is start small then once you know what to do then go bigger and bigger with it
I'm doing 1 day in May next year but next Oct is a full weekend as I've been roped into another DR/AssClass group.
Aw damn. DM me next time you at one of these events xD more the merrier with Symphogear fans.
We didn't go out till say 7:30-8ish when we managed to get a table outside
We were inside for the most part cause Clemps showed up and some of my other mates were with him too.
Yup. You'd have seen like 6-8 people watching competitive Tetris on the Switch. I was playing. XD
Nah. The pub right outside when you make a right.
I was a drunk Sento Kiryu
Better late than never xD

If you went to the Fox around 5ish you'd have found me easily.
<@81815015224516608> now I see this? Yeah. Whole weekend my dude.

You can get it for around 30 for standard BR set I've seen. You're getting a really good deal for 30 quid. 48 eps/2 OVAs/Solid State Society.
It's really clear. No 2004 DVD graining quality either
Yup. The recently released Manga UK BR set. I got that in June tho
All sold out in Japan
20th Kamen Rider Kick series.
Yup
Tomorrow is just the CDs from NieR hopefully cause no Geah stuff :(
Yup ^^

WOAH. I just saw Kura's fig collection. O.o
Yeah I've managed to get his attention so hopefully next event he'll have something
Asian fella. He's a friend of mine. Was at North Hall nearer the back.
He's known as TheTokuDealer and sells Tokusatsu related merch.
I got the prerelease mag. I'm hoping a friend I know starts retailing Symphogear merch at Conventions as I've got his attention on it.
I've been going since 2014 and haven't seen a single thing
Any symphogear rep is better than non
Once it's just a head with a pixel size body they'll achieve the ultimate smol
They're not smol enough

She publishes her work afterwards to purchase as well so there's that.
I showed Lat one of her works just a few days ago actually. TWEWY drawing.
Shunao.moe
And I love her stuff
So I don't mind.
She's a hard artist to get hold of to do commissions since she does mostly FG fanwork and charms.

Taking one for team.
Good things can have a weak start
Can't really sympathize for characters with no development when something goes wrong

Where's the emote for dead Kanade? That was too savage.
She seems to have gotten Kanadeitis
Did Kiri die in that wedding picture?
She's taller than any of the Geah users
Just over 6ft I think the art book said
Sounds about right. About 1-2in
True...
Hibiki is taller than Kiri
That height chart is wrong for Hibiki and Kirika
Smol Chris is great tho <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
Put Cags next to Chris tho Chris is an ant LMAO
Weirdly enough Maria is 5'6" apparently. Not uncommon for girls but put her next to Cags huge difference.

I'll also be watching from a phone
I feel your pain <@87512939107450880>
WE DID IT

Well

-Kanade was the first Gungnir user

-Serena was the first Airgetlam user

-Carol's dad was an alchemist which later on lead to the faust robe

-Dr. Ver and FIS Mom(cause I can't bloody remember how to spell her name) trained child soldiers to use the gears

-Tsubasa's Dad-Brother worked for SONG which was directly involved with the Symphogears

-everyone else either had a hand in engineering the gears, used Alchemy or was a result of being involved with the relics aside from creation(? Idk the best way to put it) .
(Enki, Fin√©, Illuminati/Noble Red)
But even then when you look at everyone that showed up they had a technical relation to the Symphogears.
Didn't Chris come to an understanding in AXZ?
Chris and her parents?
So kinda no reason
So yeah I know there's a few people complaining Chris' parents didn't show up but they had nothing to do with the Symphogears
Oh yeah and Enki was killed by Shem Ha
Fin√© sacrificed herself to save Shirabe
Actually... you're right
Chris' parents died during an unrelated ambush on one of their charity runs.
Like... 

-Kanade sacrificed herself by going Zesshou

-Fin√© got killed by Hibiki(iirc)

-Serena got killed by going Zesshou

-FIS mom got killed tryna stop Ver

-Ver got killed by Carol then tryna stop Carol

-Carol's consciousness merged with Elfnien but burnt out in XV

-Tsubasa's dad/brother got killed by Fudo

-Both Bavarian Illuminati and Noble Red died as a result of helping the Symphogear users.
Arguable Carol's dad could be the same but Carol kinda was.
They weren't killed as a result of relics or symphogear related matter.
Actually you know something I just realized. Why Chris' parents weren't in the final scene.
How many Japanese fans are gonma draw Fin√© x Enki
Fin√©: https://youtu.be/xO1TScQwu6g
Right thanks
Or 1?
Is normal Gungnir and Black Gungnir two different relics?
So supposedly Fin√© created 7 relics right?
Hm... Can someone explain something to me. Seems to be a plothole I haven't heard anyone talk about yet.
Never forget... TSUYAMA
Didn't realize LMAO
OH
Wait. Is Astolfo Letric?
Ohhh
I'm confused what new years holiday?
Was there something going on that I'm missing?
I thought it was 29th of Sept?
Again they weren't involved with anything to do with the Symphogears.
She was killed by going Zesshou
ü§î

Well again they were killed not as a result of the actual events of the show while the rest were.

Chris' parents died in an unrelated ambush.
MAKE IT HAPPEN
AMERICA YOU HAVE TO DO IT FOR US
Actually tbh Symphogear fighting game from ASW can only happen if the Discotek release does well.
ARC SYSTEM HURRY UP WITH GRANBLUE AND GG2020 AND MAKE THE SYMPHOGEAR FIGHTER
OH NO
Isn't everyone trapped kn gacha hell?
SHIET
Carol can rest now.
As both a rider fam and Symphogear fan this stings
~~I'm looking at you AssClass~~
Like BRUH YOU JUST SAW AN ENTIRE SHOW LEADING UP TO IT. I DON'T NEED 90 MINS TRYING TO RECALL EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED LMAO
I hate those
Symphogear has been fine without it thus far
Just no clip show OVA pls
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY GIVEN A HIGH BUDGET
>2022 to mark 10 year anniversary
>Symphogear Movie Project

Fore is a way of saying 1st
No. Fore and Latter
Fore.
The Discotek home release is the first step
Symphogear is kinda non existent after the reception for S1 went. It has grown over time and with XV I've seen how many people suddenly have XV in their name to support Symphogear. But that isn't enough for Bushimo, Satelight, (Whoever owns Symphogear) to see that. No concrete numbers by just counting names with XV.
Because the appeal is actually that visible.
Granblue is kinda in the same boat as Symphogear but yet Granblue actually does receive those games in another medium and anime tie ins.
Currently what the biggest hope is the Discotek release brings in the numbers and its finally seen as having potential in the west for consumer interest.
<@185949743321579520> well as said earlier it really depends what the demand is.
I just want my fighting game already
Toshimichi Mori
For a second I thought they meant BlazBlue Mori
But if Anime Limited, Manga UK or MVM localize it for a UK release I legit will dip the money for it.
Sadly my money is on reserve for that Kirika figure
As in guys that'll go on to right stuff and amazon that'll pay those fees and all that effort just for a home release.
And if you know the Anime Community in UK... We got dem importers
And importers too
Sadly yes
Arguable why not the viewship numbers on CR?

Not exactly reliable considering 
A) Symphogear didn't arrive on the service until 2015 
B) AXZ was due 2 years later
It's the only way to see legal numbers of who's actually interested in the west.
Anyway the only way to see how well Symphogear in the west does is the Discotek release.
There's an English option and desktop version of it.
It's international now
Although I wouldn't worry about it tbh. As long as you enjoyed it is all that matters. Don't let a score determine if you enjoy it or not.
Hm... UK fandom seems to be okay with it.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
When a dramatic change happens then we can start panicking.
Even then 8.63 is still very good for the series.
Like 0.12?
Hasn't shifted much today.
PERFECT

CENSWORD
Swors.... Or <:censword:263778150859800576>
Yeah. I'm still gonna go on job hunts once I've settled some place
Yeah.
I am legal but I don't have a good starting position rn.
Atm is a case of whether or not I can manage. I'm heading to a friend's on Monday so I can start looking.
Almost actually
20 and 2 months.
That's a good enough reason right?
So I think listing out the problems why I'm leaving home is as follows(yes all to do with a sole family except the last);
Emotional/mental torture 
Homophobic behavior 
Lying about me so he can get away with what he's doing especially having my mom of all people take sides.
Thanks. I'll keep you guys posted on what happens.
Yeah. Just where I left it.
Just in case I need to jet off again I've packed.
Gonna take <@256945399338631168>'s advice. It's better than what I'm having to put up with now.
He's not home right now.
Managed to make it back home but I won't be here for long.
Seriously thanks guys for keeping me calm or at least talking to me a bit. Really appreciate it.
So yeah I'm doing better now as I'm in more of an environment that isn't causing me too much stress.
Tbh though he keeps bringing up me and moving into my own place and being in debt of rent and shit
He won't definitely but its a better option than take what was going on before.
Update on the whole situation I'm gonna go back tomorrow and see how things are. If things aren't working out I'll see the council about what I can do for housing.
I'll see about tomorrow. If not I know I have people to turn to until I'm back on my feet.
No I'm not employed.
I'm at my buddies' place so I'm in a safe place
Just saw this now. I'll see how tomorrow goes.
On the way back to a friend's until things settle.
Just been picked up
Dangerous or not as long as I'm not being cuffed it's fine.
I have a friend on the way so I think it should be okay soon.
Not too good rn. The place I was supposed to work at never called back to let me know when I start so guessing I didn't get the job.
1570 should be enough rn if I stay on the road for a while at least for and a month and a bit
All I have is 1570 passport phone and book
I'll have to sneak back home. I have another 1300 in a box.
I've got a friend on the way
Not in the area no.
Cause he's always tried manipulating everyone like a dictator.
Hence I call him horrible uncle
Like I'm Bisexual yes. But there was never a reason to have telling me having attractions for same gender isn't okay.
Among other things too
No not that. He found out I wasn't straight and started telling me that I'll never be happy with that and I should find a girl and settle down with.
Initiating suicidal thoughts again
It became mental torture after the last thing I posted
Better than staying in a household reducing me to a prisoner
As in SW England?
Heh. I'll let you know if I'm ever nearer to north xD <@256945399338631168>

Was great meeting you as well  <@290431224596660224>. Let's hope I actually have some place to settle first so I can actually look into going to more future events.
I'm heading west on Monday likely but Ealing  <@154722817412300800>
Heh. But seriously thanks.

Might be another 9 months before I go to America hopefully xD <@102691114762371072>
I know it's the only thing I've been discussing as of late constantly but I'm really grateful everyone who've been talking to me has been supportive. Wish I could meet all of you irl rn.
Thanks outside. 

Sorta scary tbh but I'd rather be free than terrorized. That sense of freedom is so close now.
Just not the whole picture
If I get caught on Monday I'll just say I'm heading off to a friend's. It's technically not lying.
Just almost there I keep reminding myself.
Just 2 more days until I make a move. No one has noticed anything yet.
<@263983345669505025> good to hear man!
I know I keep bringing up this accusation but it's cause family to stop trusting me.
If they're willing to believe a lie about me and let my uncle have a free pass to torment me then it doesn't matter.
Well what was I guess.
No one comes in my room anyway
Figured if I'm moving I might as well have everything ready boxed up to go
I ended up packing everything in my room up
Thanks buddy
I'm off to my friend's until I find a better place
Sunday
Saturday
Friday
Thursday
Just 4 more nights
Is it bad I'm scared shitless in my own home cause of the whole situation?
I only have to stay as quiet as possible for next few hours
Hiding in my room with the lights off
Oh shit he's back
Yeah.
That's why I'm scared
Yeah
Me?
What I'm scared of right now is what happens tonight till Sunday.
I figured as much.
You know what they say don't sleep angry.
I get the feeling being different sometimes is just hard for people to either accept or not make a big deal out of it. Everyone is their own person, not a recreation of what people want them to be.
Me personally I wouldn't say I have a problem with letting people know its a thing because with me it can go off any time.
Ouchie
You know actually thinking back I wasn't allowed to eat chicken until I was 8
As a child I wasn't fully developed before coming out so my bones were extremely weak and immune system a wreck. Stronger now but back then physical activity was limited.
Oh damn sorry to hear <@236607622642401291>
You posted the Question same time I did so.... Heh... Oops.
Timing was odd
Was the question aimed at me or Aila?  <@456226577798135808>
I have a condition that basically affects my heart should I be doing instant movement or under stress
Hm... Not one I can definitely confirm
Was checking. I've been mixed up with people changing names lately on other servers so just to be sure xD

Late welcome aboard!
Also  <@236607622642401291> you new here?
And honestly you guys I do wish for a better outcome for you sooner than now. Wish I can hug you both for support and comfort. <@284390402210136064> <@236607622642401291>
Doesn't do wonders for anyone.
Not yet.
It's other problems as well. I'm gonna be staying with a friend until I've settled for new place to stay.
So I definitely know he's gotten to rest of family. Definitely need to go tomorrow.
Everything hurts.
I have a weird feeling if I go out I'm just gonna try running onto the road. Everything is freaking me out.
Haven't been able to stop shaking for the last few hours or so.
I think?
Hurts so much if I'm not applying physical pressure to my head.
I can't eat or sleep
So many thoughts are rushing through my head it's making me physically sick
Can't tell if I'm having a mental meltdown.
QUICK EVERYONE ADULTS ONLY PARTY!
I forgot Rakhi and Scrmz isn't allowed in NSFW...
I guess?
Actually Kerrik is the same age as me besto friendo
Guess I thought wrong
Always thought you'd be younger than Kerrik, outside.
Probably should ask if you're older than me before I start calling ya kiddo tbh xD
Well okay. Hope you're okay tho ;;
You okay kiddo?  <@236607622642401291>
Also Polygamy? Huh. Well can't say I'm not surprised there.
Just caught up on the situation. Damn kiddo really sorry to hear how badly he was tormenting you :(

But keep up the defenses Rakhi! Cause better things are not too far!
I just found the first shitpost I did on this server. Really March me?
I was inactive for a while tbh and started talking more in July
Huh. All I remember is Zolgenien(?) and that's it.
QQ was Vali active on this server when I joined? (circa. March)
Wait what went down with the last votes earlier this month? Don't think I heard or saw anything after it
I swear May doesn't listen to anyone.

Everyone: WE DON'T WANT BREXIT!

May: WE WANT IT
Oh dear lord when May decided it was a good idea to join a government party that were known as Homophobes and racists to get the majority last year...
UK Politics made no sense to me since last year tbh.
Shit that feels like a while ago now
Oh yeah you were Ibu before right?
Huh. Context behind the name or not really?
Right. Noted.
Bad history huh?
... Oh
Wait who's Valk?
I already had caught up with the whole series. Someone on twitter just forwarded me here.
I need to find a good op to use this again.
I just remember being in and out a lot. Scrmz's appearance was like I didn't even realize he joined tbh xD
Like I'm not AS stressed as I should be about it.
Still a big ouchie
So... Like $90
70
Like luckily wasn't like 1000s so it's fine I guess.
All fell out.
I was doing food shopping on Monday and I accidentally opened my wallet upside down.
Money has gone missing from my wallet. I know what happened. And no way I'm getting it back.
Well shit
And what'll happen.
Now the package arrived I'm gonna meet up with someone to review what's going on currently
Like it seems the only way to make politics work is do something to piss everyone off.
Y'know something I'm just baffled how bad politics has gotten in past few years.
Oh I meant with America.
Hm... Exams are a pain in the butt. But they pay off when results day comes if you've been working your butt off to get the grades you want and the Uni you want to get into. 

Probs not my place to say since I didn't do A-Level myself and just did 2 BTECs while working for 3 years but realistically you want to get into a good Uni to suit your career path right? Put in the backbone now and later it won't matter once you're doing what you want to.

If you don't get the grades you need you could considering registering for clearance placement. Basically filling up the spots so Unis can get their funding for a full class.
So less than 2 weeks. How many exams?
Boy education has changed much...

Hm. How long you have until that?
PPEs?
Hm... Well 3 more weeks until holidays Xmas da?

At least you'll have time to just catch a break and relax to calm down.
Stress getting to ya? I can see why tension might be high especially what's going in.
That him calling you the f word is okay? Tbh if he's doing that in school, especially in classes you need to raise it up with someone
There not anyone at school you can talk to to make sure that you two don't interact?
Ah. Right. Yeah might be a bigger problem than I thought.
Vali ain't around in person right?
Some of their doctors especially newer ones were let go post referendum
Can't blame them tho
NHS still struggling
I don't think by UK's main healthcare? I could be wrong about NHS though
General practitioner
Oddly enough I've heard a lot of people Musk work with don't exactly look up at him either
That's only 4hrs of sleep a night
100hrs a week in a working week would kill
Remember when everyone freaked out about how R* exaggerated how many hours their employees put into developing RDR2?
The man is nuts
Right. When I go to Japan in 2020 I have at least ¬•1000... That doesn't get me a lot does it?
Still in circulation?
Guessing different designs now for 1000 Yen?
Talked to a few friends about it. So we're looking around for apartments in general. Heard there's new apartments readily available to let so might look tomorrow as well.

Package arrived so don't gotta worry about it no more.
So yeah decided to just go get coffee, replaced the 70 that went missing and this is probably gonna be forgotten in a week or so.
Actually I should ask <@246146781832806401>
Still valid?

I can check?
Mom told me to hang on to it cause its the last thing I have of my pops.
From the 90s
I don't even know if it's still valid tbh...
The only thing in there now is coins and ¬•1000 I don't know why I keep in there
Nope. Surprisingly not.
Hm... Well I'm always open if you need to talk.
And oh no :(
Bottling up is bad for you mentally.
Oh yeah true.

Tbh I'm sorta used to talking to folks when there's an issue. Just more recently I had problems on my end irl so I couldn't set aside mine to help others just for the time being. 

I would suggest you can try talking to me if you need to let off some steam dude. I'm sorta used to it by now.
No Psychiatrist you can seek out?
You don't have anyone else to talk to then?
Fairs.
>sending hugs and support
Hope you feel better man
That's what this channel is for right?  <@246146781832806401>
That's one way too look at it. Truth be told tho, I'm 20 and don't live with my parent still family sure but Q1 of next year I'm moving out. Once you're 18 you're legally allowed to live on your own and working pay is enough to get you through life even if it's minimum wages.
Those courses aside from the obvious. Do they make you happy and worth the stress in doing it? It's more or less something to think about.

There's not a time frame for Uni to be allowed to enter, truthfully. I know someone that is 22 now and went in just a few months ago. Most people will want to get in straight away. But you have an alternative at least to consider if you desire to change your plans. 

Sure MIGHT cost more than a dime but if it makes you happy, might wanna think about it. Plus you're 17-18 now right? You still have 1 more educational year for free so if you do want to change into something easier that makes you happy, it's worth a shot.
Hm. Was gonna say something but again might not be my place to say it, about the coursws you're taking that is.
Was it compulsory?
Hm... Guessing all the subjects you're taking aside from Computer Science are focused on politics?
Hm... Part of me does wish eduction can take into account mental health in their students and how it can affect their progress at school 

What is it you're hoping to lead into if I'm allowed to ask?
:LOUD SWEATING:
I got an interview on Friday
Fuck fuck fuck fuck
Coffee has a reverse effect. My body got too used to it after weeks of homework then I ended up in hospital due to malnutrishment and sleep deprivation and missed my deadline for my controlled assessment for school.
>face palm
Completely free tomorrow
Just doing stuff tonight
Gonna ask tomorrow.

Tues now.

Already looked online and called. Won't arrive until after X-mas
Worst comes to shove I'll just practice drawing and set up shop. Unlikely success but won't see results until I've tried at least.
Yeah

Nope :|
Might be able to say I just didn't get it when I was 16.
If I apply to retrieve it now too I won't be able to do the interview
>20
I was supposed to get one when I was 16
You need it to legally work.

Eh.... This is why I don't politics. Just fucks people over.
For it to happen though
Wasn't the initial referendum also a fail on its own part seeing as Cameron didn't actually want it? Just playing with odds
Wait have they decided if we're fucked or not?
I am they.... Who do not exist...
... I'm Vietnamese/Japanese/Polynesian
Like honestly aside from reason 'a)' I've always been on the screwed end of things. a still affects me a lot even after all these years. :(
Also an extra one: if I can't even look after myself how's a relationship gonna hold?
I keep saying I'm not interested tbh considering how 

a) the only person I actually ever gave that much of a shit about is long gone

b) my ex in 2015 was the cause of my depression ever starting

c) I was fucking accused of trying to cause an affair of which made me lose some of my closest friends

d) the person I liked this year stood me up cause they rather have had Ricky Gervais's rejected body double
That it requires a dick and vagina and I also like dicks too?
I'll be honest I love my family like a lot but I'll be very honest I fucking hate it when they bring up I "need a girlfriend so I can have a family" and just egg it on without thinking about it when they know what happened this year, 2016, 2015 and the fact I'm not fully straight.

Tbh at this moment I really couldn't care less at this point if I do have a relationship much less a family of my own. I'm a lone wolf and I like it that way.
That's definitely true. The damage has been done.
He's never apologized for anything even if it's minor
It wouldn't
It's not one that affects me heavily now thank god but it can be pushed so I live longer and my brain doesn't collapse on itself when I'm older.
Even when I brought it up apologising might help everyone said it sounds silly. Now they're doing it when it's far too late for simply just apologies and hugs. It actually frightens me a bit I can't talk to family about a medical condition because of this that I have.
My uncle refuses to apologise for anything as he feels he's done nothing wrong because nothing is showing physically... Not all pains are visual...
Yeah I get what you mean Noren
Not leant, own money
Thanks you guys ;;

Like seriously yesterday actually almost did it for me. My uncle said and I quote I still don't do anything around the house when he's eating the food shopping I did with my own money.
Sorry if I went on a tangent there. Just a little pissed off at family for realizing only now things aren't okay especially after being vocal about it.
I turn 20 and the 2 months I am 20 I've basically been broken and beaten down.
I do shit for people and what's the thanks I get? Being reduced to less than dirt and mentally tortured.
I'm considered selfish.
Well guess what?
Like literally if I get what I want with my own efforts? I'll be considered selfish

If I don't get what I want and just put it aside? I'm still selfish

If I don't want anything and do anything for someone else?
They're saying stuff like "Oh you're not looking too good" and I repeated what I've been saying for 3 weeks that I'm being tormented by my horrible uncle and now they're asking is there a solution? 

It's a little late after antagonising me heavily after my uncle made all those accusations about me. Why try to make things better now when I look like shit and mentally worsened?
So it's taken 3 weeks for family to pick up on me being abused is a bad thing?

Now they're bothering me about trying to fix things when it's really too late.
Rumors and lies can cause serious damage to someone's life
But a few months later I met someone who'll end up my best friend.
Yeah made things worse.
The truth is the girl's boyfriend was having an affair with a girl in Austria.

I was there for her for moral support. In return she was there for me when I was depressed after my break up. 

Then sent me a bunch of weird texts saying "We should go out" and I declined as I wasn't mentally prepared for another relationship. Then straight up rumors were flying around.
Really showed how much trust they had in me tbh
I lost friends due to that as well
I was accused of having an affair with someone
It didn't help with what happened after either
I still kept fortunately on until 2015. When My Ex left me and I got super depressed beyond the point of wanting to wake up.
She wanted to out do em but I know myself I'd never out do them in that field.
That I understand but her focus was really on comparing me to my sister's cousins who were going for doctors and banking because their mom forced them to.
Was especially torn too when our house was broken into and all my drawings were either destroyed or gone.
My mom didn't realize I should have been doing my own thing to find out what I want to do until it was too late.

She wanted me to work on getting an office job while I had ambitions of getting into Art and becoming a cartoonist. In 2013 I did drawings non stop, heck maybe until 3AM in the morning and my love for stuff like FG art fueled that. Drawings of Strider Hiryu, Megaman endless... But when I heard I had to stop to focus doing stuff for school the following academic year I was partially sadden by it.
If it were possible at home I would do so much more with myself. 

But it seems as long as I'm here I'm obliged to be sad af like everyone else and have no ambition for better things.
School was moving at a pace I couldn't follow, family drama etc. I just slowly didn't want to be me anymore.
People say irl I stopped smiling properly when I was 14. And you know tbh it's not too farfetched to believe either.
Just some time to just catch a breath and move at my own pace. That's all I needed. Heck even considering putting time into doing new things. 

And yes I still would have gotten a job. Just not right now. After sorting stuff out like the whole NI No. Fiasco.
Actually less than 1 week
That's planned currently.

Like the thing is I came to take a break and slow down a bit and move at my own pace so I can become better so if I wanted to go to uni or anything I would have a better mindset and health and maybe smile once more. 

What he's done in 1 week has reversed months of therapy to keep me calm about everything that's happened in the last 10 years and stomped on anything and everything I love.
Well I have everything prepared I think
Accidental typo UCL instead of UAL
Just gotta update my CV.
You're right
And I'm sorta shitting myself Dx
Anyway Interview tomorrow
Good news is at least I don't have to start until after Xmas at this rate.
DAFUQ AM I DOING AND I'M NOT PREPARED
But anyways seriously interview tomorrow....
So you can have Saint Germain on a keyboard?

8-8.35 an hour isn't bad.
Bonus: Anyone in London I'm cool with can get 40% off their shopping I think? Employee discount xD
The employer said if they were happy with my application they'll do a trial run
Seems like it.
Thanks.

11:00-13:00
My trial shift is 2 hours
Guess I passed Step 1
Heh.

..........
I have a trial run for work tomorrow
Well the interview requires I have as follows

ID, Address, CV and NI(which I don't have but it's on the way)
Figured as much.
Not a Mod but as an Asian person, the C word is definitely offensive and "Jap" we'd prefer JP or JPN if you're referring to Japan or Japanese in general.
Just hoping I don't mess up today's trial shift <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>

Kitchen Assistant for Shoryu in Stratford
<@290431224596660224> JapanCentre company
Well I managed to get a job in catering with shit school grades. 

Heck even if it's ¬£8 p/hour he'll make enough by the time April hits even with rent in the way in theory.
So hotels and flights are freaking expensive
Which is in LV.
Cause we need to have accommodation booked. We're attending EVO.
The holiday isn't until August
Yup.
Is it fair I might need to set up an intervention at some point? Because at the moment

-he's unemployed
-no income
-wants to attend a holiday that'll cost ¬£2k to come

And we all need to make payments by April. If he starts too late, work probation won't allow him to book off time.
I'm not sure he's as serious as I am about it.
Me: Hm... No offense or anything but are you sure you're not putting too much on your plate atm?

I'm only asking as I care as a friend.

Him:
I kinda wanna say that but same time I don't know how to say it to him without it sounding like an intervention. I might need to settle an intervention irl.
Also said something about not being able to lower himself to working a labor job as it'll affect his pride. Sorta insulting to me tbh considering I was working in catering since I was 13.
He's trying to dance around the option atm and it's a little frustrating telling him the same thing and getting the same answer of "Yeah but I'm doing x and x".

Literally running out of what to say that hasn't been hit with an excuse.
Hm... I have a friend who's slightly clueless what to do post uni and couldn't get onto a programme he wanted to do so he could go to Japan.

Is it fair I tell him to get a job until another opportunity comes up?
But the work experience in a nutshell: I got a work mom/aunt
It went okay. They'll let me know if I did okay or not if they drop my shift schedule.
Trial shift just ended.
Trial shift begins soon. Tensing up yet kinda calm at the same time
Good thing you asked tbh. Shouldn't really be saying it.
A little better
Just so I can understand the situation
Hm... How old are you Yumi?
Depends what you feel are obligations tbf. Like my aunts and uncles didn't leave the house until 30s or so because they felt they needed to look after their parents/my grandparents as thet don't have a stong pension to pay off bills constantly.
Self sufficient or not
What I meant was just in terms of living some people still live under the same roof for various reasons.
Wait that came out wrong
Not everyone can be self sufficient to be fair.
Well for me I don't but just saying.
Living in the same place?
True. Although that said depends on the current relationship between you and the parent. No two people have the same parent/child relationship. I didn't have a dad and the next person close that was abusive to my sister.
As Buddhist belief(and just common logic) goes, Respect is earnt. Not given. No matter how old you are.
Tell him to screw off
Think that's the plan at some point now.
And  <@456226577798135808> exact same excuse as before. Literally tired of hearing the same excuse at this point.
That might be a good idea Lat. I'll definitely have to raise it with the others going tomorrow to see if they're okay with me doing so. Plus as trip planner I have full jurisdiction of who comes and not.
Talking to another friend. He's agreed an intervention might be needed.
I've been telling him that since summer tbh.

I even said even claiming unemployment benefits is better than nothing and just said "It's more my pride getting in the way of things". He's legally allowed to claim for 2 years until he has a job as far as I'm aware.
Maybe they're not getting the message across about how you feel about them. Yes they want a little more respect but you could at least tell them okay but in return they could at least be nicer back?
Well... Not to counter Lat's point but is sitting down with your parents to talk things out an option?
I guess ma wasn't the average parent then... Actually she didn't raise me until I was 9
That's just people bickering at that point
That's not parenting
I'm just taking a gap year to sort myself out. It's better cause at least I have time to think what I want to do.
First year of College for me to was meh. Advance IT wasn't for me personally. 

Second I liked having creative control of what I can produce in Art. I got relatively high marks for doing Japanese streets and Chinatown perspectives drawings full color and all. 

Third I got so depressed because less creative control what I can do.
Like ironically only subject I was happy to walk away with was English. I enjoyed the literature side of things.
The thing is I couldn't take a break from it. I get one thing wrong I had to redo the entire thing. My teacher got sacked by the end because no one got higher than a C on the actual exam paper and enforcing students to take the controlled assessment out of class to do.
And my geography teacher was a dumb ass... We learnt nothing.
I was screwed over by Electrical Engineering and Geography GCSEs. 

I ended up in hospital because my EE Controlled Assessment was way too much and I ended up pouring days of no food or sleep and collapsing due to malnourishment putting myself into a short term coma. Wasn't worth it in the end. I missed my due date for that and my art stuff.
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Sad but true. Unless you're going after Creative Writing in Uniü§î
I got a B in they actual paper.
Literature is easier.
English Language is stuff like reading non fiction texts and etc
College/6th form here equates to US highschool.

Secondary school is like middle school. It's kinda hard to explain.

But yeah in order to get anywhere like a Job via academics you need to have a C/4 or higher in English Language and Mathematics
C or now a 4
Nah on about School.
In UK
Well it's a compulsory topic you have to take
Same Sync. Well I sorta got stuck in a loop based on my ENG grade alone.

That question still haunts me as they had  to remark that paper because of how the question was literally unanswerable.
Is everyone I know suddenly 1995 or something? XD
Idk why I thought I was younger than you ü§î I'm 1998(Oct) 

Yup. Art related. I think I posted like one of my good stuff like a few weeks ago but haven't drawn in a while like sat down with an idea and just went ahead.
ü§î what year are ya just outta curious like 1998-99 or?
Especially for anyone taking English Language exam via WJEC exam board.
2015 was definitely a bad year for GCSE students
Gap year atm. 

And like I said last night I had pretty piss poor grades at school so working a bit and building my portfolio is a way to redeem myself.
Well I still want to go into creative media(Art and Animation related) but I think in my current position it's a good idea to just take a break from education or such and just work. 

I'll still do some stuff in the BG but I still need to have income at the same time
Well trial yesterday was way better than my previous job in general lmao
Varies. I might lose weekends but I still get 2-3 days off depending on my shifts.
¬£8-¬£8.35 an hour is good in a 40 hour week. 

Tiring but praise be I have income. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thanks. Like I know its not huge career but its a good filler until I move on to something else.

FeelsGoodMan.
But better than nothing
Noodle bar.
I GOT THE JOB!
Catering
I'm gonna be able to get food certificates through this job and because it's apart of a Japanese company that works closely with the embassy, chances are I could later get myself a recommendation.
You fuck up you're done.
Catering you do
Like truth is yes I worked since I was 13, Why?.... I wanted Metal Gear Rising but mom said no. So I asked if I can work for her. So worked two weeks and bought myself MGRR. Then turned into me just saving more. And gradually increased overtime.
I still don't see myself anything great either. I just worked in life to get what I wanted.
I didn't just buy myself luxuries either. I saved and saved constantly so by next year, 2020 or some shit I'll be able to move on to potentially greater future after living 10 years of being in what is the equivalent to hell for me.
Like honestly I took week after week getting shouted at by my boss while trying to learn how to work there.

>tells friend about referral service job

>says he hasn't got the training

Who's ready to hear some hard boiled truth about my life?
Was on the phone to my sister. Sorry. Yeah one of the reason was job related also his parents don't trust him going abroad.
My mom said me moving out is a sign I'm in full control with my life. So she can't say shit if I want a holiday just as long as I don't come crawling to her for dough. 

Yup.
Luckily despite me being a year younger than him I don't need permission. I just go if I feel like it xD
I'm heavily guessing that.
Parents won't let him.
So update on the whole no job thing and EVO with my mate, he can't go.
Hence I say easily miscasted actor. Especially working with FUNimation...
Like a lot of people feel mixed about Bryce especially since he voices Kirito and pretty much anyone that's voiced by Megumi Ogata in Danganronpa series. He doesn't carry the role as well as he should do.

Like I'd personally say his voice better matches a cocky stubborn teen character than the hero or completely psychotic type tbh.
Bryce has a questionable reputation and DV isn't widely known so I don't blame you?
Like Durarara was good. More of that.
He needs to be in the rival role than the protagonist
He's an OKAY VA but I feel he's easily miscasted
Eh... I'm still a little 50/50 on Bryce
NICE
Wait David Vincent? As in Senketsu?
<@99695384296701952> Yorin is sorta on the right line. Well noodle bar but they could have rejected my application on the interview if it was gonna be considered a huge problem to them. 

Still, I can request a change to one of the stores than catering.
I'll just message HR when I get back home about if I can do a different job. I didn't realize fish allergy would pose more problems than my last job.
Hm... Having double thoughts about working in a kitchen tbh.
Dude at work I've just met keeps taking up like different spaces to work. Like wtf? We need to work too.
Another 4 hours. That's all I need to manage at work.
<a:work:514894446475739156> nice
Owned by same company
An actual shop
Worse case scenario is I work in Panton Street
Like I said. I only do this academic year to do some things first before moving on to other stuffs again. 

The best I can do since it's only for a year is just treat it a little like school at least like l come in do work have a break then work again until time's up.
Think my only gripe for now is just everyone is telling me different stuff to do the same thing.
Eh... Things got better after the hiccup.
Anyways work.
Well... Yeah. Harsh reality is it does take a lot of effort in the back no matter what level you're at. 

Tbf you can say that about half if not a good majority of the creative industry.
Good thing I'm only doing this for a year. Like I said, only doing this so I can support myself financially then next year. Might move back to doing something art related if I can.
Two boxes same had a bit of a panic but it's fine.
Messed up a little at work today. Used the wrong box of rice for Sushinori
Oh right yeah. Japan Centre group doesn't give up on people too easily unless the fuck up is that bad.
?
Worker's union in UK is still a thing
If my manager is in, I'll talk to him
HR first, then if it doesn't work out, I'll then resort to other means.
I wouldn't mind working out in Panton St.
That doesn't do catering
Cause they could just move me to a different shop
I'm just gonna Email HR when I get back in.
Was not in the job description
Nope
You can look up the company yourself actually, Japan Centre
Like unrelated to cooking
^ the best I can do is just ask to move to a different chain.
Just the case of catering on its own.
*solicitor in UK but sorta same thing. Thing is I don't mind the main company itself because its mainly importing goods from Japan.
Yeah
Causing me to suffocate.
Chances are lungs can get inflamed
Also fish allergy goes to the extent of breathing too
Like those rashes come up the company can get in trouble
Well not uncomfortable with more like cause a nasty reaction
Bet I look a little silly now tbh
Not that I regret it but its just more of a struggle that might have a greater impact I'd rather avoid.
Maybe I was aiming too high working in catering outside of where I used to work tbh
I rather that than catering but s'pose that was my easy way in.
Yeah. Their stores aren't that bad actually
I did ask if it was gonna pose an issue as well. They said they'd get back to me.
Uh.... QQ would a contactless card survive a washing machine?
Yeah. I mean I do feel a little shitty after doing that but in the grand scheme of things it works out for me.
The good thing is my pay I get to keep from the shop
So all works and ends well
Same pay per hour too
Means I can see my best friend every week
My now Ex-manager said cause my allergy is severe but doesn't wanna fire, I'm gonna be transferred to White City instead which is actually really good.
Yeah. It's better I do that than a kitchen where I'm allergic to everything
Hurray
And I get Xmas holiday.
That ended nicely actually
I'm just getting a transfer to a shop department
Sooner the better too. At least I'm raising attention now than leaving it till... Well I die in the middle of a shift due to an allergic reaction
Yeah. That too. It's not like I'm handing in a letter of resignation I guess
I feel super shitty I already have to stop working at that shop but it might be for better due to the allergies being a thing :(
I do want to stay, just not the current position I'm in atm
I just explained everything about that allergy, what's happened and if I could arrange a meeting with HR to discuss what I could do instead.
Thing is realising if I jump to a solicitor straight away without consulting higher ups first, it might pose an issue with did I do this and that before consulting a paid solicitor.
Just emailed HR. Most likely will have to talk to my manager tomorrow also.
Really getting woozy
Need to haul put for 10 minutes
There's red all over my jumper and jacket now
And I'm fucking bleeding
I just got egged on the head
Welp
30 mins away and only 2.10 to get there meaning ¬£20 commutes a week
I'm not even asking to quit the job either.

There's another shop in between Stratford and White City that is actually perfect for me to work at.
If anything goes wrong with either then I have to be the one to take care of it.
My grandmother doesn't speak English
My granddad isn't in good health
It's like I said last night
Yes
The last one was only 15
I wish that could be month instead
This one however its charging me 30-40 a week.
I could do those commutes just fine.
Would it be bad if I said the commutes are probably not appropriate for me? I'm 50-80mins away from family and I'm the one on call if anything goes wrong with family(more specifically my grandparents). At least Stratford was only about 15-20mins away.
Got out about 28mins ago
4 1/2 more hrs to go
On break now.
Thanks <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Short shift today which is good. But still 8hrs.
After May, I'm just gonna focus on looking after family and seeing my mom as well more often before I do my own stuff. 

If I'm not back in education by end of August then I'll look into another full time job or hopefully part time.
Hm... Calculating my wages if I work until May 3rd I should earn a little over 6k and that's with minus travel fares on weekly passes w/out taking off holidays. Which no need to since my I'll only have Mid March until start of May.
I probably love my grandparents the most out of my family. They raised me since Birth until I moved in with my mom.
My grandad has a heart problem. He's a very active man which is good but he needs to be careful now. He has had 2 strokes over the last 4-5 months. :(

As for my grandma, she has gout. She's developing a heart problem also so I just wanna make sure she's just resting while I'm home in the morning.
Gramps is 95 and Gran is 87. 

They both have certain illnesses that probably means they won't be around for much longer tbh and that does scare me a little so I wanna be able to spend more time with them until then.
Hm... Am thinking of doing this until May then finding someplace closer when I'm back in August cause I really need to start looking my grandparents.
More things to handle but less fish so I'm okay lol
Hm... Had my first shift at the new place
Consistent hours so that's a positive
I'm okay with this
I start on 27th but what's good I don't have to leave the house until just before 7
Already got a response from work about work.
Huh
My card will still be active for online transactions but stuff like food is locked behind the card...
Okay. Sorted. Just waiting time now.
Hm.... Imma have to make a quick call to bank
Ffs I just got this one as well
Can't tell but usually picks up by my phone
It's out
Usually both pick up
It's not being picked up by my phone but my oyster(travel card) is
My grandma decided to do my washing without letting me know and I had my card in my pocket from work
Fuck I'm actually hyped now.
Heh.
Yeah definitely. I'll have to let him know tomorrow morning.

Not accounting. More something I enjoy doing day to day.
The pay is 50/p hour and all I have to do is just sit my ass in a seat and analyse stuff. (that's all I can say atm)
So 30 mins plus walking
Literally where I had my induction
I'm definitely doing it.
Wtf?
Like I could make a month's pay in a week
It's contracted but the pay is good
They're looking for hire at his work place.
The one I don't hate
I think my uncle just called me.
Well this is awkward
I'm sure there's a blood trail leading to mine rn.
Based off the surrounding building
Maybe 3 stories high
The shell cut the skin I think
From an overpass
It was.
Have to wash the blood off my face first
Maybe.
Idk if its normal for me to be a lighter skim tone tna. I USURLLH AM
Not a wide cut but a lot of bleeding
Grandma's just patching me up now
Almost home
Yeah they realized keeping me around like 3hrs was kinda pointless after shop doors shut
Not fired btw xD

No we just shut and cleaned earlier than usual
I got let go early.
My manager said she'll discuss it with me later. She understands the situation so it's being discussed later.
Handed it in.
But handing my resignation slip today~

Cause contract job in Feb so no point of me keeping this job since I'll make my entire pay from a month in a day.
I'm still woozy from last night
I SURVIVED THE NIGHT WITHOUT DYING
But train just different
Like if it was 40 minutes on a bus or walking I can make do.
I just ended up writing about me not being able to make the commute all the time.
Imma just print that resignation letter off first
Fuck idk if I should sleep or not now. Since I'm partially still woozy from earlier.
I'll pick something up tomorrow me thinks
I guess? Idk. I mean I've been having off dreams lately but not this bad.
The oddest thing is that girl. I feel like I've seen her before but it's not anyone I know atm that comes to mind.
Dude. I'm gonna need something real sweet and cold to cool myself off. Like the most wtf dream I've had since I had Charles Lee Ray chase me when I was 5.
Then I woke up drenched thinking wtf?
Like it killed maybe 5 people? Like it felt so real.

Basically like what happens at the start of the dream my mom for some reason opens up a new apartment complex in the middle of nowhere that suddenly looks like the indoor market from a futuristic dystopian sci-fi movie or something(refer to something like Demolition Man).

Then I walk about and meet this girl. Say around 5'2", dyed blonde hair and suddenly this demon starts chasing us. Like a tall black shadowy figure. And kills this dude I just met at work leaving only bits of his flesh behind. 

This girl and I hide in an old arcade of some sort then suddenly the arcade machines turn on giving our position away. We run, more people die and suddenly we go to a room. Where she's trying to call out for help. 

The demon comes breaking into the room and she pushes me out of the room saving my life but she dies. And only bits of her remain and the demon is gone who knows where.
Ep 1? Uh... Idk like the demon was taking away all these people I just met. Then giving me bits of them back. Then I woke up drenched in my own sweat to the point I just changed all my clothes on.
Holy shit. Just woke up in cold sweat. Just dreamt people I just met getting slaughtered by a demon ir something jfc.
I ain't even scared of TOD anymore lol. They can try me but nothing'll happen lol
Well good thing I like to play Rush down.
FighterZ (I know that's near suicide but would be fun at least I go down in style) and see what side tourneys there are.
I am not dying before EVO
She let me go home. Cause the palpations were getting worse. Like I could feel my heart bashing on my rib cage.
I can't do 3 more hours of this
I'm getting heart palpations.
3 more hours on the shift.
We're so understaffed here.
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Why it gotta be 6th?!
Can my termination period end already?
Ooooh... So government would control it?
I know I should know but it's me. I'm a dumb ass.
Wait. Dumb question but what's it mean to be nationalised?
Than 2 years ago
There's more maintenance
You know what's worse? The services don't get any better.
Wth?
Apparently going up by another 10% for season passes.
Eh.... Anyone in UK should know what a pain in the ass to use trains are atm.
Then 17th is Mortal Kombat time
2 8hr shifts today and tomorrow. Let's plow through this and then 9 on Sunday and that's me done.
Between tomorrow and Sunday

I CAN DO THIS
Then I'm done.
I can plow through this weekend.
17 1/2 hrs left of work.
Like I'm not sure it's dying down but it seems to be more open than 2 years ago.
Two kids.
They're fine tbh
Tbf with China itself they're fairly heavy on Communist propaganda. One of my uncles is married to a Chinese lady.
Eh.... I've not heard much from Chinese people hating on Japan in like years.
I'm kinda glad it's up. I mean sure things happened but it's 2019. And already a few good things have happened and that's making me less depressed to where I can sleep at night without going "I fucked up" .
Me to everyone:
I'll be honest like 2018 was a real shitshow but being here certainly helped a lot. Didn't realize I would constantly be coming back to this server.
Looking forward to Feb
But first, I'm going to the Mortal Kombat 11 Keynote on 17th
I have better work coming up some point in Feb.
Then I'm outta that shop
8 1/2 tomorrow. Then 9 on Sunday.
Was supposed to go yesterday but then I kinda forgot to bring extra clothes xD
It'd have costs me 2.70 to get back home tonight
Also only 1.50 to get there
Early shift tomorrow
Cause I'm going yo a friend's to sleep
But I'm not going home tonight. Shit.
I have too much adrenaline.
Sometimes
HEY I DON'T TAKE THAT LONG
I'm too motivated to fall now. Fuck I need a Vergil Emote
I'M STILL ON A MOTIVATIONAL HIGH RN
<a:blobble:512471343699197963>
<a:blobble:512471343699197963>
Just got off
Me for next 29hrs
<@189283693557186560> shift. I'm a little on the hype train after I handed my resignation slip due to a better job coming up REALLY soon
Alright here I go. 8 1/2 hrs now.

Then 9 left tomorrow. Yeah that's doable I think?
<a:blobble:512471343699197963> <a:blobble:512471343699197963> <a:blobble:512471343699197963>
8 1/2 hrs. Mask on and let's roll!

Motivation is at maximum!
Sorry its a bit long.
Like idk what to do or say.
After I left things on a bad note I'm sorta scared shitless.
So I'm seeing a friend in say 2 weeks-ish time I haven't seen or really properly spoke to in person since last May-June-ish. 

She meant a lot to me like seriously a lot and made me smile a lot when we were still talking. But around the end of April I had to get something sorted with a much another friend(which I got seriously hurt after) but her boyfriend started threatening me on discord and stalking me on services such as twitter and finding ways to harass me. 

So I stopped talking to her. She started acting really awkward around me irl. Like anytime I was around we wouldn't talk more acknowledge that both of us were around. Open a door, she was there we couldn't say anything. It got super uncomfortable. So she messaged me on discord and I admittedly started freaking out saying we should stop talking or even being near one another. I didn't want her to get hurt if I accidentally got her in trouble with 'him' and sorta forced her out. June I heard something happened at College that her work got vandalised, badly. So I messaged her seeing how she was. We slowly started picking up but there was a huge gap between July and October. 

Until a few weeks back I mentioned her in a convo at work and I messaged her again during my break asking if she hated me back then for what I did. She said no and we started talking a little more.

After the MK11 keynote I'm back in Derby for 10 days and I asked if she'd like to meet up. It's only hitting me now that it'll be the first actual time I've seen her since May.
Anyway
I mean yeah I'm saying it now. Bit silly I said that.
So... I sorta need to talk to someone about something if I'm allowed to say here.
Hm....

<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
Final day
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Ass clenched tight prepared
.... I'm usually more prepared
And a toothbrush
I guess so. Like luckily I know the college she attends and she said she'll meet up with me probably the mid week of me being there as I'm seeing Broly with another friend as a belated birthday present. So guess we'll see what happens.
Like I really don't like talking negetively about anyone. In fact I'm more of an optimist at minimum. It kinda takes having crazy shit actually happen to get to the point of "Well... Goodbye then"
It's a shame. I don't think he was that bad when I met him but like half the shit he's posting is kinda annoying/not worth seeing. Probs for the best tbh
Hm.... Not to sound like to I rant or shit on people but there's this one guy I met when I went to the demo event for DMC5 in London. 

I won't say who they are(it's not anyone here I love y'all) but half the shit they post actually started to annoy me a little. Like the dude is super full of himself and acts like he's super popular... Probably a good sign to unfollow him. Not a fan of content he posts and we don't even talk so I have no reason to.
Feels good to sleep in again
What's annoying is if I complain about it and want compensation back it comes out of Lyn's wallet and becomes her fault when it was Royal Mail's. Not her.
It was charms from the artist that did my Avi btw.
Also the only time I'm showing my actual name

So they said this morning "Hi, we couldn't send it out so we're sending it back cause oops we're too late"
Cause we didn't get a customs fee for a package they had down on their system differently to what it was on the package.
Like seriously no fuck them
Welp fuck Royal Mail
Like... wtf? You'd never catch me saying to someone jump in front of a car "as a joke". There's a bit of a personal reason why but let's not go there today.
Tf kind od twisted joke they into?
We managed to get the hotel back
A HAHAHA
My sister is a genius
But like I can have that cancelled if I find something better.
It's fine. I have a back up room
Shit.
Ah fuck. We lost the hotel cause we ain't travelling as a 4 person group.
I can hold off for Booze for like a week. I think during the after hours we're just gonna go back to the rooms and just hang out.
I'll be fine. My friend wants to take me to an arcade in LV at some point so I guess that'll eat my coins instead of gambling
If they are I'll still be 20 xD
Hm.... Are gambling and drinking age the same in US?
~~Gacha games says otherwise~~
Lol I'm not yhe gambling type xD
Found a hotel deal that's really good
We might be at Mandalay Bay
I have 2k for the trip in total. Half of that is getting there and hotel.
She has prints and charms I want
I have some money set aside for Lyn alone xD
And I'll get to see Lyn IRL
I'm definitely gonna have to see her to pick up the charms.

I had ordered BnHA ones and Xmas Hazama for my friend but sadly RM couldn't read her hand writing...
She did my Discord Avi for me also. <:raisedaaa:402985739899633664>
She's the seller I bought the charms off that got sent back due to RM being nutjobs
Actually Kaliks, you know Shunao by any chance?
Deffo sorting hotel out tomorrow. I got caught up doing something now I'm tired.
I'll be seeing the artist at EVO
But it's a 7month wait
The problem got resolved
Forgot to mention
Oh right
>sighs hard

I'm surprised how much patience I have with people sometimes

>post some old art
>someone one makea a hentai joke despite not being R-18 content
Well not a little more like a lot.
I can't sleep and freaking out a little
Think the thing earlier is traumatising me a little the more I think about it.
Better call it a day early
Tbh I really shouldn't be talking about it here
I went to go visit her grave just.
Today was the last day I saw her.
She's been gone for 13 years now.
When I was younger there was someone I deeply cared about.
I bumped into an old family friend on the way back. And I forgotten what today was.
Like really dark for me.
So today got dark.
So.... QQ has the last few years just gone to waste then if Brexit has fallen through?
Well... I certainly missed something
Huh
Is it bad I may have started laughing cause someone got booted from another server due to an argument someone started but I couldn't take it seriously cause 

A) he kept saying 'Fuck You'
B) they openly admitted to blocking messages from me

All the argument was(I would say debate but I think at that point the guy got super defensive) was me saying Opinions are Subjective and those that openly express it on a platform like YouTube shouldn't be surprised if a negative comment against their opinion is made especially if research is not made on the topic matter. I.e. Jim Sterling's video on FGC or AngryJoe and the DMC5 Microtransaction fiasco
The guy is a dumbass
Yes
Tbh I was still laughing after it happened
Like one of the rules in that server is literally "don't argue, debates and discussions are fine". The guy wanted an argument and I couldn't even take it seriously cause he kept spamming "Fuck you" 

so I posted that.
He's taught me not to treat anyone like he has.
He believes that you should only help the 100 you care about
Oh wait I didn't mention that yet
Wait by his logic I shouldn't help him. He's not in the 100 I care about.
Like if anything I try to love as much as much of my family as possible. But sadly he can't even be helped at this point.
I know a bit. Not too much.
He didn't realize she was Chinese until we both spoke Cantonese
Truth be told my uncle just uses his GF as a tool. He knows squat about her.
Ah. Yeah. Thought you meant that. Yeah doesn't hurt to help I'd say.
Heck I'm thankful someone actually found my ID after dropping it in a shop one time.
While true, it doesn't cost a penny to help someone out.
Even picking up an item someone has dropped by accident is recognize as inefficient
Not sure if anyone remembers me saying this before or if I have but he's actually selfish to the point helping someone you don't know he acknowledges as a awful thing to do.
In a nutshell he's a selfish asshole
He's not committed either I've heard. Sometimes he'll keep her from doing her job and expect her to pay the bills plus use her work perks to travel around....
Of course she's not gonna be at home most of the time.
SHE'S A FUCKING AIR HOSTESS
All cause "Waaaah my girlfriend doesn't come home"
So he accused me of abusing my grandparents but he terrorised everyone else and my grandparents.
The guy is a fucking moron.
So he's letting out his frustrations on where he has total control.
All cause his relationship isn't going well.
Wasn't even related to me. Turns out my uncle has been abusing the entire family.
Oh boy I have the best revenge setup and I know why everything happened now.
Does anyone remember back late Nov when I had problems at home?
And here I was for weeks shitting myself thinking this wouldn't go well.
So... Finally met with my friend yesterday. We hung out a bit. Glad that the weight of the past we left behind us and just had fun.
Well... Aren't I having a swell day? XD
For now I don't have a card to be using
As soon as that arrives
Luckily I'm not buying anything but will need to update all my current preorders
Orz
So.... I only have 48 in my wallet
Yeah...
But it's fine. That one is getting cancelled and I'm getting ¬£15 for it
FANTASTIC!
Welp. HSBC cancelled my card and the other one got lost in the post... :'D
Dreams to work towards? Hm....
You learn shit loads of stuff
It's partially how my mom raised me. She did some international charity work and I'd come with.
BakaBaka doesn't wanna see the world?
Going back and fourth to two places you've already been to, what's the point?
I hate travelling like commutes however
I don't mind travelling in the context of going abroad.
I go to a lot of conventions but not even I've broken 800 in the 4 years I've been going surprisingly.
Just leaves it to collect dust.
He doesn't do anything with it.
Actually he spends ¬£5k on speakers but complains to me I spent 40 on a video game with my own money
He's extremely pathetic.
I firmly believe she, the current girlfriend, just does her job to go away from him sometimes
Like I wish I was joking about that
He scared away his last girlfriend apparently tbat badly she moved back to Japan....
She's very nice actually.
I don't think that many bad things occurred that's had a huge impact on me tbh
~~I've oddly gotten great at video games with it~~
Like I'll get used to it but honestly I don't mind the feeling
It's a common thing among oriental Asians
Like literally a pint too quickly is enough to get me red faced
It's a physical thing like I can't drink too much at once otherwise I get red faced too quickly
I'm Asian so I get drunk too easily
Nah. I'm too clean to be one aside from the occasional beer
It's a bit hard to discuss as I'm under NDA
Definitely not an errand boy xD
And now I have a job that calls me whenever and they'll pay me whenever I do something for them.
So made me realize too that leaving that job might have been vital in looking after my older folks.
I'll still sort of count 1 as bad as I almost lost my grandad cause I was at work when it happened.
A 2:1 ratio ain't bad for good to bad
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
The piece of filth can't seem to understand a singular conversation without any mention of him getting money. Almost safe to say he's probably the most single-handedly disrespected person in the family.
What's funny now my mom's caught wind of it. She ain't letting that shit fly so she's literally said that if he dares even think about it again, he can go fuck off and not bother coming back.
Not like he already hasn't but now he has for real.
He's stepping too far now.
So my horrible uncle still persists on continuing on being a dickhead towards others. From what was "Oh I'm trying to make the house more liveable for grandparents." to literally trying to move them out to a retirement home for his own beneficial gain...
International relationship eh?
Realistically I'll probably keep it to the 4 servers I'm most active on. Here, my two servers and SugarPunch.
Hm.... Kinda thinking to go on hiatus on a few servers until I can sort something out. Not leave so to speak but less or not active on them until I've finished something
Unrelated to problem one. But now I have another problem. So my uncle doesn't listen which was starting to piss me off. So it pushed me a bit to even put a note on the door because obviously he's full of himself to the point his ears no longer function with the rest of his body. Now he's saying I threatened him. Well we wouldn't have to go that far if he would just listen and leave.
You've a point but I've waited months for it. Might as well see this the whole way through.
So best be going off to sleep
Idk if I've gone into a random rant or what not that doesn't make sense but it's almost half 2 and I'm tired.
What's not been helping is one of the servers in particular I'm on. I have this strange feeling I'm not exactly liked in that server and have been tempted to just leave but I can't due to the owner owing me something so I need to stay until summer(or EVO to be specific). The reason I feel that way anytime the owner or their mods talk to me it's in a way that's extremely rougher than anyone else in the server like they don't want me there. 

Which is a shame since I've always looked up to this person just for them to tell me to "Fuck off" at some point due to slipping up on the server once or twice which was poorly timed as it was on 11th Jan(which I'll refrain from saying what happened). The slip ups weren't even that bad either. I accidentally posted unsourced art from another server via linking it. Which is fine I understand why I got told off since its a rule, people make mistakes all the time but wasn't any reason to literally pummel me down that harshly I felt uncomfortable to be there.

Its had me thinking for a while I want to cut down on servers I'm on just so I can sort myself out without having to have any concerns with them. Just spend less time on them I guess.
Probably should explain what I meant last night. I've been going through physical examinations amongst talking therapy to aid my depression. 

Results ain't looking too good for me sadly on the fore subject since let's just say if I'm not careful enough could result in more concerning outcomes in the future.
I kinda wanna forget everyone linked to my family just so no drama can get back to me
Think if I move out soon I'm not gonna turn around
Yeah
Fore
Kinda on the verge of dark thought again
So this day has taken a bit of a 180
Heck I ran off from home when he first argued with me. I wasn't comfortable at home anymore and I had planned to just run off.
He's been pushing my patience harder than I can take it since November.
If he's so insistent on believing that I can become more violent if that's what he wants.
Then he goes telling everyone else that oh we're threatening him.
I didn't do anything bad before either. He's the one who's telling my sister to go fuck off else where as well as me saying we would be better off be 6ft under than be alive.
Uncle is doing that thing where he's telling everyone lies again but this time everyone is fed up with it.
Not that much of a bad person am I?
He has the biggest room in the house. There's no reason for it to be empty.
What's funny is he's the only person I can't cope with. 

I can cope with everyone else. Even my oldest uncle who yes he's a little rough and physically imposing but he's not or ever to the point he'd ever raise a fist to anyone or even say fuck.

Anyway this uncle was threatening me months ago if I have any of my work and studies around the house he'd would trash it. So I bought myself a table at home so I can work in my room. So I said the same. If he leaves his tech crap in the house I'd list it on eBay just as he once threatened me with his shit.
<@388516680742993933> he was Qrow in RWBY
Definitely Quinton Flynn
I mean if Vic is known for OTT Croaky voices
Raiden from MGS and Axel in KH
A more deserving voice actor
Give all of Vic's roles to Quinton Flynn.
Britain's prime minister everybody ü§¢https://twitter.com/DailyMailUK/status/1095624297119449088?s=09
I guess so. Before everything went to shit for a while I was always happy with everyone. 

Just in November when everything started happening it started getting rough with homophobic blackmailing and mental abuse. I'm just sick of it tbh.

I guess the driving force behind everything bad is just one shitty person. And everyone else who I'm happy with would be in shit if I just left.

I'm taking time away from home again after this coming week to see what my options are
I just need to disappear really.
Kinda having those thoughts again where if I go things might actually be better for everyone else.
Yeah it's an age where self control over hobbies is still a mist to some.
Hm... Year 9 is 13-14 years old iirc
"too much" is up to interpretation tbh.
I'd imagine he's quite young right?
Just maybe have a little talk with him once he's calmed down a little
It's only human to do so. If you still feel sorry for your brother maybe have a talk with him. You love him as family right?
Hm... Feeling sorry for someone after something bad has happened isn't necessarily a bad thing. Tbh your brother should have listened when he was told so non of this would have occurred.

Your mom didn't take the best course of action but people have strange methods of discipline especially Asian parents of our generation. That's coming from someone who is from a predominantly Vietnamese family from living on my mother's side.
Top tier mom(?)
Tbh though of Rakhi goes through with it and it results in losing trust in some family it really singles out the ones that actually accept Rakhi's decisions and not judging her on what she is.

I'm not entirely caught up on the convo but what I can say is this the ones that love you will always stick by you as long as they can, no matter what happens. Even if that results in losing your 'biological family' as a whole then make a new family with those that are willing to stick by you.
Trust me being in a coma isn't great
I've learnt to just go with it sometimes. Better out than in but you just need that outlet/coping mechanism
For me bottling up has actually harmed my mental state permanently
Like true no two people are 100% identical so idk if that'll work with some but 20 years of me being alive; I've faced being in a coma at age 7-8, assaulted 2 times to the point the police had to get involved and potentially a brain condition that I'm always afraid may be my demise if it gets worse than it currently is which I know it will. 

And yet here I am just accepting what's happened/happening and just coped with it since. There's not much you can do for the past but you can always make your future a good one.
It sounds weird to say but sometimes if you feel your emotions are dragging you down then sometimes it's best to roll with it. Sounds weird, yeah? 

But letting yourself just go with it sometimes is the best coping mechanism.
Not a bad thing.
We all have those demons weighing us down.
It's just I went to college and Rakhi went to 6th Form
Dw about it.
It's fine xD
Alice UK Colleges work a little different. Like alt = to high school
Clearance is an option at least don't forget. Not ideal but not a bad thing.
Just as long as you ain't the type to expect owed favors that's fine.
Being good is sometimes a thankless job. But not a bad thing.
Or a machine lifeform idk
Unless you're a monk
I mean we don't really go living without sometimes we've hurt people in our lives we care most about. Sometimes it can get resolved, others it may go worse. But sometimes it's up to you to know what to do next.
You got the news of the new rules?
If you're wondering what I used to do in this job general assistant in import media shop in London. 

Nice place actually.
Yeah he was extremely scummy.
Like he would fully lose it with customers then randomly "Sorry I was rude, I'm autistic see?"

After customers would leave the store I'd actually go tell him he shouldn't be using that as an excuse much less tell customers that.
That's how they found out he faked it.
It got to the point work wanted legit medical proof of it.
Idk how he managed to get away with it as long as he did.
I used to work with a dude that used autism as an excuse why he was so rude to customers. I kept telling him off because he wasn't actually on the spectrum.
God I really hate the ones that just resort to stuff like autism to validate unrelated shit. I'm also autistic so that insults me too.
I'm in a weird situation. Cause I have a thing with my brain that's kinda harming it physically so I can't get too angry otherwise I can black out randomly. In a way despite my hot headed temper I have ways around it as long as I still have control over myself.
I did Kendo. Still practice today as an outlet.
I mean if somehow Dunkek's neighbourhood is that bad they need the security sure but to monitor someone's activity is definitely concerning.
Shiet
>30 mins of discord
Like going that far is a little concerning. Nanny cams are fine as it's to protect the child incase something bad happened.
Reason basically
Wait is there context behind the camera being needed?
Yeah Japanese art community is flipping out
RIP Japanese art community on twitter https://twitter.com/NESbot_OT/status/1100112947400060928
Thing I never understood is why is one governor's opinion the one that matters?

Maybe it's a topic of discussion for another day or I'm the wrong person to discuss it but you think about it and really most of these decisions are an opinion of a singular person
Actually tbf the two topics I excelled at are Math and Eng Literature
>seeing everyone talking about how smart they are.

>me here with a dunce hat
It's weird saying communism in Vietnam has actually benefitted the country as you go there it's probably cleaner than any 1st world country you'll see in the west.
Commies, America, Japan(who still owned Vietnam at the time and still do), France(Who set land in Vietnam for a while) and Poland.
Everyone's fighting for the right of Vietnam....
The Vietnam was was one giant mess.
Both of my Biological grandparents were from Japanese empire's migration I think? As far as I know my biological gramps was. I may not know who he is today but my current grandad has been by me day 1. So I'll still consider him my grandad. Not a step grandad.
My Biological grandfather was POW in Vietnam war despite only being there as Japan's empire were still in Vietnam by the time of the war. Towards the end he passed away and she remarried to Lanh Nguyen(my current grandad). Anyone born after my mom were his children biologically.
*cousins

My name at birth in full was Kazuto Kawakami cause it was my grandma who named me initially to carry on the former surname before grandma remarried in the 70s.

Then my mom was worried my sister's dad would find out about me so she tried to legally change it but the paperwork was never finished properly. Now I have two names.... And its a fucking pain in the ass for stuff like paperwork to find out where I am so I'm getting that settled this year.
Actually two... Fucking counter productive when both my family and public names are both from Asian backgrounds....
I'm the last kid to be given an Asian name in my family.

Others after me were;
Jamie
Caitlin
Emma
Jasmine
MaiMai
Actually would they use an Asian name or an international one.... <:sweats:417436182465740805>
[Name] Nguyen-Jackson ü§î
Considering they both decided to merge their names together
Hm... Just thinking what the name would end up being.
We're a while away.
<:BikkiSalute:449129247403933697>
Hence why we need to raise the kid right Solopy
Hm.... Just be happy for us.
7's her husband's/my uncle in law's favorite.
Also we can play Aerisu or Tifa's theme at birth
Hm... In a family of JRPG fans FF seems more appropriate
Eh... If it were up to me NieR but I'd rather the kid not to be depressed at 5
He's a massive FF nerd xD
Imma make sure that my aunt's husband get the kid's cultural influences right. By that I mean have the kid surrounded by 100 JRPG games.
LMAO
The last 4 births since 2004 have all been girls... Everyone's kinda hoping the cycle breaks xD

But everyone's okay regardless what it comes out as.
She's skipping the whole surprise gender reveal at birth I think. At this point everyone kinda wants a boy to happen.
Heh Will do xD
Was thinking 2 months but her husband showed me an app to monitor how much time has passed
Actually no 12 I think
Mhm. She's almost 6-8 weeks pregnant.
Aunt came around earlier with the good news.
I'm gonna have another baby cousin :')
So... I can finally go into Serious Discussion with good news.
Then again how many lewd characters that are around 16? Also those Symphogear stuffs which you know if you follow literally any geah focus artist you're bound to find via RTs.
Think papercuts are fine or what not like super minor stuff but like yeah my buddy managed to make a pool of blood in that meaty area of your hand where there's no bones with flesh still hanging off.
That is true
Discord's community guidelines are really odd but if I wanna keep my server up better play by their rules at least.
Oh no someone else was getting exited to see it.
It's better to be on the safe side than risk it.
```Sharing images of gore and/or animal cruelty. Do not share or post graphic images for sadistic pleasure, glorification or celebration of violence.```
I checked the TnC's.
Like luckily didn't tear off too much of the surface but layers of skin was just ripped off by a really heavy revolving door
No no skin ripped off <@137113218173632512>
So... Turns out it was.
So yeah had to go check TnC's if that was why.
It was basically a patch that got ripped off and had a pool of blood on his hand.
Yep my server actually got locked for a bit cause someone posted an incident from yesterday that occurred where some skin was cut off by a revolving door...
>someone posts gore on my private server

>whole server gets locked
Yes
It's bad enough I had Thursday to deal with I don't need another fucking bad thing to happen.
She's been extremely hostile towards me. The sad thing is if I try to call her out then people will come defending her. Like a lot. There's a shit ton of evidence leftover from her server.
It's a shame since I used to look up to this person a lot. I was and still am a huge fan of their artwork but the stuff that was said completely changed my view on this person.
Because of what happened I now have had to wait 3/4s of a year to go pick it up myself when I go to EVO. The only way for me to contact them is via their discord server.
And when I said they owed me something. About $60-90 in an unfulfilled order.
It's the person who drew my Hibiki pfp I had for a while.
Because today was kinda the last push I needed to see how they really felt about me being around.
So 2 months back I was fairly upset about someone verbally abusing me on their server. And I think I'm gonna become more clean about who it was but not say who directly which is gonna be heartbreaking for me personally.
She's feeling better now.
Yeah.... Phone was dying anyway
And I'm gonna go with my sister in the morning to look at a replacement mobile
Good news the phone has been barred
Sis has her clients and bank info on that phone. Luckily however she's able to get the phone remotely disabled
We did but the guy looked like he was close to pull out something
The thing is my aunt who is pregnant chased the guy but we tried to stop her.
Was out and sister had her phone stolen.
Today went from great to scary
Or money ks stolen from the account
Oh PayPal does give me the refund threshold should an order fail.
So in actuality I need $30 back for having to pick it up there.
The bullshit thing is most of the total price went to delivery and it failed.
On the otherhand we are still within 6 months of a failed order. I could just ask Paypal to refund me the $92
I'm just not gonna go to her discord server tbh.

Like I rather just leave rn but I need to get some of the stuff she said to me first as evidence/stick until I've picked up the order.
Tbh I'm glad I finally got it off my chest today
Yeah. Okay.
Wanna DM it to me? The name. I'll say yes or no but as long as you don't go after them.
To a certain degree even though everything she's said to me my best mate has actually deemed "Fucking awful" I still have a certain level of respect only as an artist to artist. Not as a personality anymore.
She's no Symphogear fan so she's not here.
Oh the artist... I said I wouldn't directly mention their name I think. But you could prolly find her via serching SFW Art since she did do my old pfp.
There's rumors it's just an act but he really an asshole too.
LTG is probably one of the most abusive Fighting game players out there. Same level if not worse than DarkSydePhil in terms of personality
I'm in Geoff the Hero's discord. He has LTG there for a joke.
Heck it's awful when the server with LowTierGod is better than dealing with her.
No way there'll be an incident where people can just pile on...
Knowing her a lot of people kiss her boots.
Already started doing so.
Record everything she's said to me?
I'm planning to depart soon.
I'm Buddhist by religion. Patience is a given.
I'm kinda glad I didn't send that now.
I still have this on a clipboard as I was gonma send it into her server when I was really down and just talking about things in 2019 going my way for once. ```Actually you should have seen me go into hysterics when I saw [] accept the Hibiki request. It was shortly after the whole thing started, I was really depressed. But it went 180 after```

I was interrupted before I could finish it.
Heck I was so happy when she accepted the Hibiki commission
Tbh it's heart breaking that I have to talk about this person like this. I looked up to them. I have done nothing but be nice to them. And all they've done is give me shit.
Yeah I guess today's example wasn't the best I could be presenting. Or the way I'm wording it rn.
But anyway yeah I literally asked that. And I was outed as "OH I WANNA SEE THE BUTT CRACK"

I have the Japanese version of the game coming where this scene is uncensored. I didn't learn about this until just a few hours ago.
And it's uncensored on the XBONE/PC versions
It's literally just a butt crack.
In UK its way stricter though
I guess?
That's the point I was making
LIKE DMC5 IS M RATED/18+ FOR A REASON(sorry for the glowy picture). Why would there be censorship involving human anatomy in an 18+ game?
FUCKING EXACTLY
The problem is that MANY of the top names like MarkMan and MrWiz know who this artist is and will defend her should anything go wrong her way. Actually she still has a NSFW Lucina bodypillow listed on her site.
Well DID.
The fact she does NSFW Work as well gives her no right to tell me the game was just objectifying women by having them naked.
Was that a core values joke?
Wait. I don't get...
Fighting Game Community
A lot of harsh comments were made...
Like yeah my best friend had to comfort me a bit after what happened today while I was around hers.

For context there's a scene in DMC5 that occurs that has been censored ONLY on the PS4 version. I pointed it out as odd as this was a scene already shown at TGS without any form of backlash against it and the game only being made for Adults. She started insinuating I was being a pervert for wanting the scene uncensored and everyone started joining in when my point was it's only on the PS4 version it's censored when in Japan and literally every other system it's not.
Yeah. I will.
When reality I make accidents
People will just end up making it look like I was being shitty
META's right as well
She's a highly regarded artist in the FGC. Like I've told some people and actually given today's incident
I should crop that and upload it to general
Tbh I was shuffling between different pics but might keep this one just cause the one I really want I'm waiting for a few months to pass before using it since it's a funny screencap from closer to the endgame
Yup. Old man Dante~
Even the small parts help~ <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Guys I really appreciate you being supportive to me complaining last night. If I could give you all a group cuddle that'd be <:SSSrank:484110905693569034>
Drawing naked people is a norm for someone that does art class nowadays
If I'm allowed to say something about the censorship thing anyway even if I was complaining about it I do art. Last year I had to draw a naked man with a piercing in his dick
Yeah... That's what I'm concerned about
(Canada to UK)
Good use of $50 since she's sending it vua USPS
Instead of it reading as 41a, it looked like 412
"She really needs to use a label maker if her handwriting was that bad"
And she's admitted to having that happen before
So the reason that we never got the package was after reviewing the sending sheet they couldn't read her handwriting. So it was sent back....
My friend had pointed out something really bad.
The evidence has been with me since New Year.
Was about to get her something she might have appreciated since it wouldn't be retalied in the US/NA region.

Oh I have evidence.
Yeah...It's super tempting atm.
I'm in the clear for about less than 90 days more.
Goddamn.
I've been hearing about this all morning :(
Welp. A13 passed.
Dunkek is becoming a grown up now!
Just enough for me to pay for a new controller in time too.
If we paid on Friday that'd have been ¬£900
¬£623
At least the EVO plane ticket was sorted for relatively cheap.
Not 19
Yeah. We sorting it tomorrow. But like I thought my passport was still valid till 2020.
We don't fly out until August 1st
I have time
Im A dUmBaSs
I sorted out my EVO stuff which is great but I did not realize my passport expired a week prior to EVO
Well getting something. Screwed.
I was only 17 at the time
I couldn't vote
The brexit campaign has been called out on multiple stuff the past two years as well

-Flase claims saying ¬£350mil would go to our health care... Yeah they've taken more money out of the NHS and foreign doctors have been let go. 

-Illegal campaign via overfunding their push by several million pounds and more. 

List goes on.
It's a piece of shit honestly
Iirc the actual result was something like 48.2% vs 51.8%? People wanted another referendum after that but were denied calling it democracy.
Trust me a lot of vocal people here has been complaining that 2% has been very stupid to push forward something as affecting as Brexit for almost 3 years.
>says let's put ¬£350mil towards the NHS

they've taken more money out of the NHS
The Brexit vote was a 52% majority with a rather shit campaign. 

At this point British politics is nothing but a steaming pile of crap. It's not getting anyone anywhere. Those politicians only care for their own bias and call it democracy.
Sometimes I do wish I lived in another country but the alternatives aren't exactly in great political states either...

... That said I wonder what Hawaii is like?
>sighs
End of the day, politicians of the modern age don't think. And politics is based off a bias between a room of people.
The latter post is interesting...
"My mess is done. Someone else take over."
Something this then or?
Atm about 6 different servers are saying 20 different things.
Indulge me. So if and when A13 does come into place

What will we see online and won't see?
Wait. Wtf is everyone freaking out at then?
<@263983345669505025> canada is in political shitstorm I've heard last night.
We have a police officer in the family. He's aware of everything what's happened since November but it's out of his jurisdiction due to not being in the same city so he's forwarded it to my local area.
He's almost 40.

She's 25.
Kinda fucking creepy she's closer yo my age than his.
He commutes.

Cause he doesn't wanna go home to his girlfriend whom he also abuses.
Exactly as is. He just came in without knocking and asked why am I even alive?

Among saying things about the history of my birth saying I was just a mistake. He really dug deep this time around.
I really need to go from this place ASAP
You know something I went away for a month to go clear my head and that's what I come back to?
That's not normal right?
So I got moaned at by my asshole uncle about being alive
I would take a photo but rather not rn seeing idk where it is. Like at the bottom its like normal trousers.
I'm not too huge on sweatpants myself. Well specifically the ones where its laced at the bottom so it ends up looking like aladdin pants.
Like more trouser + shirt combo or?
ü§î what do you mean by masculine? If I'm allowed to ask.
Hm... The way I see it if it feels comfortable should it matter? Unless there was a particular reason or something (not sure how to word it rn)
So more natural looking then?
ü§î hm... Define "terrible"?
Kinda curious what is <@302063351767498752> crossdressing for? Like in general or what's the story here?
I also came out about my clinical depression, how it's actually been a full year since I've been diagnosed. So things that my uncle have been doing have to stop as soon as it can. 

Me moving back with my grandparents is actually heavily linked to that. So they've realized what might have been just pushing buttons to "tease me" is actually mental abuse and they fully understand how bad it was.
Not in a bad way just I was really quiet about everything
Considering one of my trusted family members is straight up gay, I'm not the first to come out but it has surprised some it is true.
But it was something that was very much needed.
I ended up crying. Like a lot. Honestly.
That also means yeah, I've officially came out to my family as bisexual.
So I spoke to my aunt about everything that's been happening at home, the abuse and homophobic attacks from my uncle. 

She said she'll discuss it with the rest of the family since they're now calling him out on being a hypocritical asshole.
They're aware already.
He's figured it out already and he's used that as a form of blackmail.
Actually he's the reason I haven't come out to my family yet. Cause I know he'll antagonise the shit out of me.
It's bad enough he's been called out on homophobia as well
Idk I'm dumb so don't quote me on this but I do know there is an extent that could only be covered in trans health that can't be in regular stuff. Maybe.
I'd assume also it'd cover anything from after any operation since its not as easy as a one and done operation(?)
It also covers stuff like Gender Dysphoria etc.
We're almost coming to the end of Trump's presidency. Only 1.5years left.
I doubt at the time I reported it he would have gotten away. Maybe from the specific station but he was making a change to central from DLR. 

So no way he could get out the station without needing to go through a gate.
Not really a case of "NOW EVERY EASTERN EUROPEAN PERSON IS BAD". Apparently what I've been told by the police after the first two incidents is there have been reports of a similar kind.
Part of me doesn't wanna think about it but I partially think both incidents might have been linked. Both incidents involved an Eastern European guy.
Honestly? Kinda fucking disgusted that I even saw anything on that phone.

Especially since this might be the same shithead that went after that family member a little over month ago I mentioned.
The idiot was right next to me and just had his phone out.
Transport for London have direct contact with transport police. They should have taken it from there.
I don't think any sane person would have what the fuck I just saw
I flagged it up with TfL but holy shit the contents of his phone
Think I may have just caught the dude who tried trafficking her.
Shortly after(this part I haven't mentioned) the same family member almost got trafficked.
Not sure if anyone remembers but almost 2 months ago I had a really close family member pick pocketed in the middle of London
So something extremely scary just happened
Not my first choice tho
Maybe if I'm THAT bored
You use TV for News?
You guys still watch TV?
Like he attended two conventions I've attended. Anything I've seen in terms of footage hasn't been short of... Odd or creepy.
The Vic thing was kinda known in the convention groups for a while
Well there are certain people in the world that either treat opposite sex like garbage or the worst thing in the world.

I.e. Objectifying genders for stuff ||Sex industry|| or Misogyny/Misandry.

I'm far from doing or being any of those but that's a few sad examples in what shitshow this world is.
Also they're infamous for taking things way too far so if they happened to start then... I guess tge point Shimoneta makes is no longer a joke
ü§î well Japanese corporate knows how to milk x and y. If it fails they do it again until it works.
"Anime has gone awful. I BLAME THE LOLIS"
I've heard about the anti-moe animator one
Creepy in what way?
I think I've entered the lost zone on this topic so imma back out while I can.
?
I really don't wanna hate Sabat or Rial by any means but c'mon guys? I sure as heck would be vocal about it if something wasn't right after multiple incidents.
But they had a lot of opportunities to do it. Why when shit hits the fan bring it up then?
But anyways yeah those voice actors are a bit two faced then cause they had no problem talking about Vic with high regards. And then turn on him when they had every moment to speak up about him.
What now?
But insulting the fans over it?
So Chris Sabat, Monical Rial, Sean Shemmael(idk how to spell it)
Majority of the FUNi DBZ cast actually
The VAs definitely doubting.
"This guy stole my thing!"

"do you have a photo of it"

"n-no?"

"we can't take your case"
Sorry Nep I do like you as a person but I really have ro disagree with what you said just now
^what's I'm hearing
Nep... Are you asking for photos every time?
Hot Take: Yes the accusations sometimes do get out of hand where its just not even an accusation. It's just adding fuel to the fire.

But within that pile of accusations they do speak truths.
Hero Hei has been leading the StandWithVic for a while with YellowFlash2. I wouldn't cast it aside immediately.
Annnnnnnnd this is why I don't watch edgy anime anymore unless it's a deliberate horror themed show. (and no not cutesy horror, much more like cronenberg Junji Ito level)
I watched Sydsnap's video on it. Like they give more context to the massacred charters.
I've heard in the manga it's worse.
Goblin Slayer pushed the shock card way too early much less a reason to...
Oh crumbs. That show....
Must be that hardcore
ü§î anime discussion in <#336297840529899522>?
Depends on the context no?(Dunkek)
Well some people aren't exactly comfortable seeing stuff like that
That's easier said than done in present day
It seems its exploring themes people aren't comfortable with
WOW that went from 1 to 100 in 1 second...
That.... Sounds depressing. Why "Hero"?
And should I be concerned?
What is Shield Hero?
Woah what or where the heck is that coming from?
It depends Zero. Since Saban doesn't keep any of the story the same in PR compared to its source material. I'll carry this on in <#336297387863703552>
<@175163984197058560> this has turned into... #Serious-Anime-Discussion
I.e. super sentai and kamen rider
It's a genre of live action drama shows
Tokusatsu
A lot of Toku fans like precure
Devilman Crybaby was probably the last one I was invested in just because how much of its source history has influenced so many other shows I've seen
I'll probably see one edgy show once a full moon but wouldn't be my first choice tbh
I never caught on to Lied past the first ep
Ay Zero I've seen a good majority of those
As in AoT SNK?
Ew
WTF?
IS THAT WHY PEOPLE LINK SHIELD HERO TO VIC?
Wait
ü§î excluding symphogear I've realized I've been watching more serious level stuff like GITS and DtB more recently.
As in they weren't accepting of it?
"i lost my parents"?
I do wonder sometimes what it would be like to transition. Just speaking out of curiousity. 

Not inherently trans or anything(as far as I know of myself currently) but does make me wonder sometimes.
Okay that much I get. Cause I have a friend over here that is the same.
Oh my bad. I misread wfc's message. I thought they transitioned already.
Trans but didn't want to transition but did anyway? Can someone explain to me?
I'm Buddhist. There is no god in our religion technically speaking.
Hm... I have a friend who comes from a Muslim family but doesn't consider the religion to be what he believes in. He's Turkish.
QQ and somewhat unrelated but are you religious, Rakhi?
Granddad is oblivious tho cause he kinda doesn't give a fuck who I like and end up being happy with.

Also Rahki its okay to not be happy with how your family reacts. End of the day you is still you. Your family isn't you.
My grandmother is a little odd about it only cause she's like 80 and has no idea what's going on.
I'm fortunate it's a small number out of what? 15-20 family members of my grandmother's children/descendants that are really shitty about it. Everyone else is extremely chill or supportive of it.
It fucking irks me how one defends the other with "he's only doing it cause he loves you". Okay then? So if I'm not straight it's okay to cause domestic abuse at home is it?
Damn. That sucks. :(

Sorry to hear. Not that it's anything similar but I still have family with an old fashion'd mind set(well only two members). They think me being bi can be "reversed" so they act like homophobic arseholes about it.
I don't think so?
Real world problems. <:YuiScare:442105076933459979>
Oh that presentation is still up online
In an assembly aimed at 12-13 year olds
Actually speaking of that and my school(I think I've brought this up before) my school got sued by a racist UK government party for comparing them to Hitler and the Nazis
Well... Learn something new everyday.
Ohhh
There was also a video online they made which was them opening up about what they were going through but they were picked on for it. Like holy shit to the point they kinda weren't allowed in class anymore. I didn't watch the video while it was up just out of respect.
Hm...(still doesn't get it) 

Anyway yeah they had a problem for the most part. There was this person in my year (let's call them M for now) who was going through a bit of Gender Dysphoria but one non school uniform day they got sent home just cause teachers weren't happy about how they dressed which made them comfortable.
Pink triangle?
So like I was saying yeah when I attended school back from 2010-15 they had a lot of standards back then which weren't in favor of if you weren't straight.
I've been trying to conquer my fear of converting to tablet for a while now. I kinda need to just get used to it cause it won't get better without doing anything.
Back to failing at art :')
I'm not even sure where to go from here tbh
I mean... I get the joke now but... Really?
When you said Binary terms I didn't think you meant literally...
What was it that was said specifically?
Like November
This has been going on for some time now
Oh right forgot you haven't been here for that long Nara have you?
So I guess that's the adrenaline rush gone
Welp. Motivation killed by my homophobic uncle.
When I joined I think I was on and off until June. Then I started talking to more like Zolgenien(?). Whatever happened to that guy?
There's like a weird thing on discord where people aren't active as soon as they join a server. So that's understanding.
Dw you okay in my books!

With home life I'm okay to give the general version of it but the full version is something that's been going on since mid-November. And my uncle overall is an unforgivable asshole.
The full version would be too long and painful for me to detail sadly which involves running away from home and other things...
Basically the short version of what's up at home with me. 

He continuously lied to family about me with random stuff to justify torturing and blackmailing me at home making it hell. 

Everyone in the family(aside from my oldest aunt cause she's extremely gullible) kinda sees the truth now but it was kinda too late. He still proceeds to be a total dick about it but everyone is just telling him to get lost.
Woke up to hearing projared news
<@279341087494242304> I'll just say I'm tired.
Boom. Fucking exactly. If anything it's wasting time and counter productive af.
Precisely. Finally someone that gets it.
Irks me when people want my input but then do something as silly as that
Like I said don't ask me to do things if I'm in bed and too tired to be doing anything.
I think the first warning should have been at "I'm too tired, let me sleep"
Other than that yeah Mom is gonna have a talk with her. Cause honestly anyone I'm talking to about it rn is just saying she's throwing a tantrum over it. I really don't want to agree but is what it is.
We come from Buddhism. We're told not to waste cause it'll come back to us later on in life as a regretful action.
Perfectly good bread, rice and casserole.
Well that and I had to remind her that anyone could be eating that right now. But she decided to throw it away after that? 

Like don't get me wrong I love my sister but that was extremely disrespectful especially with what our religion stands for.
Which slightly pisses me off a bit
She threw a whole bowl of it in the bin
This isn't the first time this has happened before. So called mom and she's gonna deal with whatever is left of it in the morning. Cause it's clear my sister has this illusion if she runs away from it it'll all be better.
Basically that.
^
She can't cook beef for shit. She wouldn't let me sleep until I did. (I'm tired cause I started running around London like a fucking idiot after a major adrenaline rush)
I said it was dumb but she insisted.
Yes
Like who the fuck cooks a casserole at 10PM at night?
Like here's the thing with me:

Never ask me for help under the following: I'm tired/you're not gonna listen.

Admittedly it was over something stupid but got violent really quickly. Sister wanted me to show her how to cook beef properly. So I was showing her how and suddenly "Don't grab me like that" cause I needed her to hold the pan properly so she could take over. It wasn't even violent grabbing either just like putting her hand on the handle so it wouldn't fall off the hob.

So I just went upstairs and here's the thing about me, if I'm annoyed don't apologise to me straight away unless you actually mean it or aren't gonna use x amount of excuses why this and that happened. So I said "whatever" after her attempt at an apology so she started violently throwing herself about next door in guilt. She has a really bad tenancy if one bad thing happens she needs to literally pack up and run away. So I said she isn't the only one with problems I have my share too and so does everyone else and that just made things worse. Like yeah stress can result in physical effects to occur but I've taken way worse hits in life. 

||She forgets I was stabbed and crushed underneath a bookshelf last May while trying to look for someone and I still have those scars both internally and on my left leg. No joke this was someone that was close to me since I was 5 and after the incident I actually had to seek medical attention that badly I missed college for a week.||

I calmed her down after a while but now I'm made out to be the bad guy. So I called mom to have her talk to Sis in the morning cause she's the only one who knows how to deal with it.
Gotta love it when you get annoyed over something and suddenly you're the antagonist...
But seriously like wtf? Who sits around thinking "Ohhoh if I do this I'll get away with it hurrrduhurrr"
They've leaked online as shown in this parody mock up of ProJared's intro(is censored where needed) https://twitter.com/thatdude433/status/1126394930073620480?s=19
There's still also the fact that he sent nudes to people on social messenger services like Snapchat
Jared is lying apparently
Well okay the latter isn't important but you get the gist of it.


In two tweets explaining everything
Catch you up to speed PJ is an Internet personality in the same vain as AVGN. He makes videos on video game discussion.
Like someone made a mock up of ProJared's intro and used the photo
They've leaked online also
What is the matter with people thinking its okay to have an affair much less the nudes
No respect to him... Not that I had any to begin with

Stop forcing overtime and mentally abusing your devs.

If you've kept up with the news regarding NRS is that they've been forcing workers onto crunchtime ever since they were founded in 2010
Unrelated but HOLY FUCK NRS now I really hate you as a company. https://www.gamepur.com/news/40144-netherealm-crunch-death.html
What meds are they?
Shirobako actually made a graph about how a budget works.
Same applies for Anime
VAs make more money if not the most
Isn't nice to hear but you kick up a fuss they won't have a 2nd thought about replacing you on the spot.
The problem with developers is you can always get replaced.
As much as I despise the VA Guild they did make a difference but the reason I despise them is they're asking for more money when their voices alone gets them more than a single dev will get working on the game.
The problem is Unions aren't pushing enough to make a difference
I.e. DMC5 actually has cut characters due to the scans costing too much to do.
Most of the budget goes towards using the equipment
Hana the problem is that game studios go off on a budget. Several millions.
Lol
I only do freelance testing on the side. It doesn't pay much but covers my bills
That's one half of the industry yes if not 2 3rds

That's a story for another day
I had talked about someone that brought me out of my comfort zone from 2014. The first person I had ever seen as a friend. But he seriously mistreated me badly the longer we were friends, constantly antagonising me and making me look like the bad guy. Even used me to break him up with someone which I regret ever doing 4 years ago. I did things for him and never a "thank you" afterwards. I felt more used than appreciated. 

But compared to my closest friends now, he can go suck it. Cause the friends I have now are honestly the most fan-fucking-tastic people I have ever met and I think it would break me if I ever lost them as friends.

I also talked about someone that left me in perhaps my worst state for 2-3 years.
So I had a almost 3hr long voice chat about friends over the course of time in 6 years.

And that made me realize something really important. How much I fucking love my friends I have now and the ones that have gone aren't in my life for a really good reason.
Interesting.
How could one be only just alive now but 22?
Weird.

Not all heroes wear capes.
Pretty sure the queen also helped our during WW2.
Heck they don't necessarily need to be on the front line as this guy is saying. History has shown female medical support during war also risk their lives to save soldiers. I.e. Florence Nightingale
Female soldiers do exist

You can imagine how that ended...

So after cooking... I kinda was too depressed to eat :/
I'll just get food there despite being really hefty
I'm at MCM tomorrow.
This was supposed to be lunch for tomorrow as well :/
By my height and age I'm supposed to be 18.5

I'm 17.1.
Threw it away.
I bought mind you
All the onions, carrots and potatoes cut fresh
I literally just did it
Out of spite
Swear to god I'm so close to punching that bastard in the face.
And you wonder why my BMI is under average
And then my uncle threw away the food
Did food prep
Oh great
He's not wrong tbh
I ate something. Not a lot but something.
Cause again the fucker keeps scolding me.
If its not then obviously no one can add that to the Wiki page.
I suppose if the information is made public then it might be easier to put there.

I.e. Caitlyn Jenner. They have it formatted like this.
I wonder if that applies to Wikipedia since that goes through people's history based on what anyone puts
Welp. Spain is now fucked.

It's times like this I rather be a hermit than endure this sort of stuff
Now I'm hearing conflicting stuff
So Lewis has actually been banned again apparently after people had their bans lifted.
OH THANK FUCK
<https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=900777463595035&id=253752011630920>
There was also an incident I didn't learn until midway through yesterday about someone running around with their boobs out at the con too... Yikes.
I think there are people trying to reach out to the current committee concerning Lewis.
The buyout happened a year ago iirc so MCM could expand by the same company that owns NYCC and SDCC. I'm not sure why people that were banned are allowed to return now.

The dude is infamous in the convention community. Alongside a few others.
I've been hearing rumors about something really concerning over my local major convention. Everyone that had a ban from MCM has had their ban lifted since the buyout. Including someone called Lewis Falcon Williams, someone a few years ago who did a bomb threat ||and threaten to Rape Girls|| at the convention years back. I'm hella hoping the rumors aren't true.
I guess I should have mentioned something like 3 days ago... Oops
Oops my bad xD
Rakhi. It's me Sketch xD
Yes.
Ngl we weren't given much info what the last election was much about speaking as someone who did try to find out what it was.
Didn't it turnout to be like 37%?
It's so unclear rn
So QQ who actually won the last UK election?
That was a bus. UK trains don't look like that. And yeah.
I just avoid dumb shit now after 3 tweets into an argument

96 almost

Not happy about it.
Just emailed them.
But 95 just gone like that
If I could take a snapshot from my mobile banking account I would
Apparently not any more....
A little concerned.
I don't even know
Gonna see if I can get a refund and cancel the order.
Yup
So... CDJapan just took ¬£95 on an item that has no release date and isn't even shipping any time soon.
I get the point. I was just saying.
"Britain doesn't have independence day"

... We have Bank Holidays. And they're more frequent.
The guys weren't caught no
Kinda was. I would share the thread but a lot of it was ranting about now no one cares about Lesbians more than the actual attack.
Someone had a thread about it but the way the wrote it sounded like no one gave a shit.
Not all feminist are bad. History dictates it's done good. But it's stuff like this I hate where it feels they're taking advantage of the position they're in. Especially how Sarkeesian does it.

We were lucky to get the house when it wasn't worth as much.
Tl;dr with my grandma so she's close to being considered terminally ill. They found a stage 3 tumor so shes having a surgery examination to see if it can be removed. 

It's a 50/50 chance atm so I haven't been too worried since we don't have a proper answer. Went to see her at the hospital a few times she's home now. (I am concerned yes but not overreacting) 

What that has to do with the house is because the house is tied to both her and her husband if anything happens to either of them we could potentially lose the house since it'd be too expensive to fully buyout(¬£400k post inflation) from the company that owns this household atm and we may not have enough to pay for rent. Which we as a family have had since the mid 70s.
Plus $50 to pay off the fee for staying at a hotel in the strip.
Plus I'll still have $500 for EVO I think?
It'd be a matter of having it sent to my mom's place instead since there's stuff going on with my grandma's health so I'm not sure if I'll be at the same address come release day nor is there an address I can change to around where I live.
In hindsight if I can't get a refund I'll get a game I was mildly excited for cheaper than buying it in UK surprisingly.
Looking at the bigger picture I might be just okat
I need Samsho since that's one of my games at EVO.
So that'd be 80 reimbursed.
I'm in a weird position where I can get 40 from a few friends that owe me minus Samurai Shodown that's coming out soon.
I kinda wish they sent an email asking me if I wanted to keep it than just go "Oh yeah we took money out"

Not even nowhere near. Not even detailed.
The item was delayed for like a year
Yeah it was just a preorder.
O.o
So does that mean I can't get a refund?
Little worried about that paragraph
After playing the open beta over the weekend.
Well worse case scenario I get an item I'm just wasn't too hyped about
Hope so. Probably won't get a response till Monday
Yeah and Samurai Shodown which is what I'm playing. Doesn't come out for another few weeks
I'm semi panicking atm
So I have an update about my money mishap from Sat <@256945399338631168>

Sadly no I didn't get a refund but I do know when that thing I ordered is coming

And Mom said she can spot me 200-250 from my savings but whatever I don't use goes back into the savings.
Well the otherway around.
ü§î Pretty sure Ghost in the Shell SAC did something similar but not to offend anyone.
I'm not exactly sure it's in a game developer's interest to be doing that stuff especially with Sony breathing down their back about it.
Is it a penis tho? Like have they confirmed that is it what it looks like or??
Wtf?

I wouldn't think so. 

Mandatory checks are free(obviously) but idk about requests. Would just try filling in the gaps myself but apparently we need permit to do anything alike before going ahead.
Mandatory house inspection isn't for another few months. I'll ask tomorrow about if we should just call someone in about it.
Had the kitchen rebuilt in 2017(?) so anything like holes and cracks that could let them in were gone. We have a bit between the kitchen and stairs that might need another look at.
Welp now I can successfully say I kicked a rat by complete accident. We really need to call the company that owns this house cause we might still have a rat problem after 2 years of nothing
Fuck I'm actually scared now
Went downstairs to find 5 paramedics surrounding my grandma

And finals ticket was not cheap either
But not as it is atm
I'd have been completely fine if it was a day later.
Well... I might have run into a problem with EVO. The flight company has rescheduled my flight so we're flying out a day earlier than planned. Mid-finals.
They found several possessions of his including wallet, phone, laptop and switch on Weds night. Only reports are being made public now.
Kinda scary to wake up to hear about Etika... I've never really watched his content but watched as he slowly lost it and now knowing possibly he jumped off Manhattan bridge is a scary thought
But it's much better for my back.
And yes. It's as dumb as it looks and impractical
This is the best I can do...
Couldn't get the bed moved out of my room as planned. Guess I'll sleep on a sinking mattress a bit longer.
OH THANK FUCK IT'S BACK TO NORMAL

People overtime were pushing for him to get worse too. May have not been a majority but even that small percent of people laughed it off as a joke what he was doing during the time of his mental breakdowns.
The problem with fame and popularity is when you have comments like that thrown towards you, it can get to you.
That too but here's the thing. He also got death threats and violent comments towards him.
Guess the fame got to him.
D:
Very much of that clickbaity or doesn't actually know the full story journalism
I just don't like Keemstar in general
As requested by Khara it's quite possible.

This isn't the first time LGBT has been wiped in anime coming over to the west. Toei stopped the gay relationship in Sailor Moon too.
Not saying I agree to it but is as it is. The harsh part of localization that exists.
And Evangelion being a huge household name, to Netflix wasn't worth the risk after investing the money already.
One of the more famous incidents of this was Ghost Stories where the studio said "Okay you're allowed to do anything you want, just keep the character names the same and the way the ghosts are defeated too". If they don't abide, the studio could just pull it.
When studios allow distributors to localize shit they have stuff they make the distributors agree to.
Cause Khara said they had to.
Netflix had nothing to do with the translation. 

All Khara's doing.
What's "enby"?
Fun start to the month
So my mom forgot I was clinically diagnosed with depression
There's maybe a handful of shows that can manage that in the sense the lead characters aren't supposed to be likeable. The two mentioned being quite popular amongst that.
Other than that most of it I find quite funny. Roy trying to explain and find out how a fire at seaparks happened, Moss joining Dragon's Den etc. It was kinda made when humor was less restrictive and the medium was less frown upon for how far it can go before offending people I feel.

Then again I'm a guy that enjoys IASIP and Curb Your Enthusiasm. In which both shows don't stray away from humor to shock.
The only episode I feel might have not aged well is the episode involving Matt Berry not realizing he slept with a trans person.
Well that's just ep 1. Every ep after that rarely goes into that again.
It was funny for its time imo
Oh damn... Kinda weird since The IT Crowd is still one of my favorite TV shows and all.
Wait as in he tried stopping it from happening or?
Right. I've heard JK Rowling also got into flack with this subject matter, no?
Yeah. Women who don't support trans iirc?
So can someone tell me what's up with Graham Linehan and what was the flack he got into with trans people?
In fact if that movie had anything good come out of it was literally that
The funny thing is... Khara were completely okay with exploring Shinji and Kaworu in considerably the worst of the rebuild movies (3.33). Which came out mind you 5 whole years ago.

My cousin is gonna give me guidance once planning starts. Its very early talks rn.
He said he'd rather have me be safe and happy than miserable living with blood relatives that drove me to dark places.
He also wants to make amends with me after what happened in October.

I was startled at the offer at first. Did have to think about it and kinda am happy with it.
My cousin overheard the BS with my uncle so is offering for me to go up to Canada
Guys. I might be moving to Canada either end of this year or next.
Well I'm fortunate to have friends to talk and go to. When shit gets real rough at home my best friend lets me around. She and her boyfriend don't mind for the most part.
It's mentally damaging me the more I think about it. I should sleep.
So yeah there's really more than a few reasons I despise him.
If I'm being honest he's the cause to most of my S word thoughts since I was 14.
Called him by his name which is more than he deserved. "It's uncle to you".

I told him to believe what he wishes but I refused to call him that. Cause that thing isn't my uncle.
I need a new more appropriate name for him. Cause I feel every time I say uncle it might refer to the other family members I like.
Considering how much you have to push me to hate someone I hope one day when he falls he doesn't get help. Let him bask in what he believes in. "Survival of the fittest" my ass.
In fact I hate calling him uncle. Cause its demeaning to anyone else I refer to as Uncle.
Uncle being a selfish fuck shits on those that believe in charity work. It's no wonder I have nothing but utter contempt for him.
I'm not one to say what people can spend their money on but he throws ¬£5k per surround sound speakers mind you he has a house full of them and some of them seeped over into where I live... 

Mom sent over at least enough to fund most of it back in the 90s and asked nothing back but for good health and upbringing for anyone that ends up there. I don't know how much it was exactly but I'm super proud of her regardless after having visited the site back in 2011.
Uncle decided to shit on my mom's life work and then refused to own up to saying it in front of everyone yesterday morning...

She worked 3 jobs to earn money to help fund an orphanage in Vietnam way before I was born and still sends old clothes and food over when she can. 

So in a way I'm a little pissed off. Is it right for me to be pissed off?
This was something that happened back in March
I'm assuming you don't know what's going on with that.
Yeah.
I have gotten an apology. I haven't replied as I know atm she is busy with something and I'd rather do it at a time she can respond
But anyways grammer lesson out the we are 50% of the way there
I maybe could have been clearer
So was the artist
My best friend is a girl
In the context, she's been wanting to say stuff for a while. So I felt there wasn't a need to hold her back in saying it considering I was being ghosted after asking her something about that order that got sent back.

So it doesn't go without saying there is context behind it and something did get done. And I got an apology about how she was being towards me.
So my best friend got into a fight that with that artist that wasn't being nice to be several months ago. Oh boy. That was something. I didn't even tell her to. I just said "Do as you please".
Well sometimes no. What happened with me was I was phasing in and out of conciousness. It can take a while for it to result in that.
I was in a coma for 3 weeks.
After injury.
That's just losing conciousness.
I was in one for a while let's say. It has resulted in a somewhat long term damage but nothing too worrying.
~~yes I have also experience a coma. I was 7.~~
LMAO... Not again... but you get what I mean on the surface level right?
Well yeah consider this the Zesshou.
The best way to put the situation is think of it like Hibiki and Tsubasa.

Hibiki looked up to Zwei Wing and the last member of Zwei Wing. But said person Tsubasa had a cold shoulder over Hibiki. That's how it was for a while.
```Basically an artist that I had looked up to as a role model for years, commissioned an Avi and supported started being extremely rude to me and was making me upset for various reasons let's just put it.

My best friend got enraged for months when she found out in March. For a while she has been wanting to say stuff.

There was also an order that was sent back due to a misreading for an address so we didn't get the customs note and we had agreed yeah okay I would be able to meet up with said artist at EVO to pick it up but I messaged her like 2 weeks ago and got ghosted. So my best friend wanted to step in due to how she saw unprofessionalism. 

So they got in a fight on SNS that resulted in an apology for how she was towards me due to being called out. Thing is something would have kicked off regardless if I let her or not. And I know my friend is somewhat reasonable unless shit was really that bad. There's a lot I could say but tl;dr shit got sorted. 

Which means ¬£98 would have been gone on an order that should have arrived in December if nothing was sorted now. ```
We ironed out the problem. And she'll be less stricter on people.
So update on that artist thing
So that calls for him to be an asshole even before things got serious?
"Oh your uncle is just getting emotional, that's why he's like that" my ass.
Things can't even be peaceful without it getting tense at home.
I need a go to so I can just forget about home life until Canada
Doubt they'll want him back
Just 1 more year kid.
Couldn't even answer it
Literally a simple question
Check <#336310266654490624> to see what I'm on about
Gotta love it when people get angry over a discussion about anime...
You got a link to that thread?
Warning: Graphic detailing ahead. It's fucking atrocious. 

<https://twitter.com/i/moments/1150682337014734848>
Thanks anyway
I found the thread now
Majority of UK news outlets tend to BS and twist their stories/content for the sake of making conversations happen
That should tell you enough
He writes for The Sun
<@284390402210136064> they're Unknown. So still unconfirmed.
Apparently 28 dead now
The survivors need time off work.

1) they're more than likely to have PTSD over what just happened 
2) they don't have a work space to work in to make anything
In regards to KyoAni I don't think they'll shut down depending how the employees feel about it. But they'll need some recovery time for definite and if they still stay active they need time to rebuild their lost assets.
No offense or anything but isn't the sex industry quite common in that part of Europe?
Although part of me is saying they'll have time to rebuild. Just not produce anything in the meantime which is understanding if you want to try rebuilding your lost stuff.
That's one possibility.
Iirc about 35 were injured. So that's more than half of their team either dead or injured. To what degree I don't know but some reports have said severe.
Also depends on how many survivors are still fit for work too
Considering its the Japanese workforce we're talking about they'll need to recover their equipment to work with first before looking to employ people again to fill up the free job slots again.
LMAO
It's happened before. One of the more infamous takes on that is Food Fight aka Hollywood's most expensive animated movie that looks like pure dogshite.
Months, perhaps a little over a year.
Melua's probably right unless KyoAni are able to recover which is gonna take a while.
The upcoming unannounced Free Movie may be on indefinite hiatus as a result. I wouldn't go as far as to call it cancelled but it really depends if they can redo the movie if it was made prior to the cancelled announcement or if they can if it was only supposed to be an announcement of them making it.
Yeah pretty much what Millhi said.
It was fortunate that one of the animators took their work home with them
They almost lost the entire Toy Story film due to someone turning off the servers ny accident.
Pixar don't either
Believe it or not this is not uncommon

Twitter's been the absolute worst with it.
Although doesn't help with everyone jumping to conclusion he's dead.
Hm. Bit of a perspective.
Just asked not to be vocal about it?
Even something to confirm he's okay to his peers would be okay no?
But it's too distracting...
This is something I shouldn't even be thinking about
~~Weird religious orgy?~~

Japanese Cheaper by the dozen much?
Wtf?
Man had 12 kids
Had they kept him alive.
That said tax payers in Japan would probably br keeping him alive and fed after what he did.
They only decided to execute the fucker last year who did the sarin attack
Was about to bring up the sarin attack
So 24 years
That was 95
It was either someones son, daughter, wife, husband, mom or dad, uncle or aunt lost in that fire. Those people who are related won't get to see them cause some maniac decided to go commit arson over an idea that might have not even been plagiarised.
Loved ones even
Sad thing is knowing most of those people had families.
True
Yasuhiro is still not known though
This long though?
If Yasuhiro is alive why'd he decide to keep quiet?
Nothing official about him being deceased yet
He's still marked as unknown/missing
Man I'm still a bit worried over Yasuhiro Takemoto's current whereabouts.
I've never seen words I'd agree with so much
^
Wait. Maya is British?
Am still seeing several concerns over it. Mainly how Boris just has a bad tenancy to run away from problems than deal with it.
On a scale of 1 to 10 how fucked are we? <@284390402210136064>
I'm sorry. What?
Oh dear lord. UK Gov is not doing so well.
Everyone does it anyway
Naraa it's okay
Night guys
So I'm just gonna check in in the morning
It's sorted now though
Almost had a heart attack over the EVO trip
So for context I didn't know Canada requires you have a VISA(eTA) to pass through
It blocked me from checking in
This is kinda their way to actually say she's trans outside marketing material. USFIV made no reference to it and SFXT's only reference was something that didn't sit well with people. It's been a controversial topic for a while but throughout time there has been more evidence to pointing Poison is trans. Even as far back as her OG concept art. Although albeit not all great evidence. Been some stuff that has made people go "wut?"
In SFV:
For context Capcom had to take out several win quote due to it being slightly offensive about Poison.
Interesting. Capcom actually haven't given poison shit for being trans. 

Good job. They've learnt from SFXT's offensive outro that had to be changed.
Especially a shop known for selling arms
They're grossly missing the point....

You realize you sti give him +1 on views by having downloaded the video cause you need access to the video to DL it...
It's fuckin great
As a British person I know of that movie
It's worse when you realize this is what hospital and school funding is being cut for.
What is it with current gov's obsession with more prisons?
We're okay now. She was actually very nice and apologised about the whole thing.
So I had a chance to meet them in person at EVO since they had a stall.
Oh so I have a follow up on that artist that was being iffy with me. Idk why I'm saying this so late.
Would really suck. Especially since she's a Chef irl too.
Max has been super stressing about it for a while but didn't think this would happen :(
Atm they're going through their 5th house move?
Made enough money so he could help other FGC members in dire need, helped his wife set up a cooking show on twitch.

Progressively pushed out more content.

FGC stuff and SugarPunch DesignWorks keep me busy for the most part
I feel bad for not being as active here anymore
Used to be hella shy to talk to them. Turned out to be the nicest pair of brothers around.
ABI is fun to talk to.
Although I find myself more active with the Symphocast dudes now.
There is another one that has been around for 4 months I was on that was made by a bunch of Bang Dream fans.
Isn't that the more known Valkyrie server?
Btw I don't mind this server tbh.

At least I get along with people here. For the most part.
<:sol_grump:316703070799134722>
It be like that
Apparently making the problem worse was the best way?
"People put spoilers as their icons"
The owner kept putting up the most recent spoiler and I even asked if that was a good idea.
They're a very closed off server this one.
It started to falter for me a little around August ngl so I just wasn't active over there until the last few eps.
Or maybe 4
Nah. That server was around for like 6months iirc
Did one of those 5 include "The superb server of the Valkyries"?
Left it anyway so really can't give two shits
It's another Geah server but not the Valkyrie one that's kinda infamous here(?).

There's just so many questionable actions with it but as soon as you mention it... "Hur dur hur you're wrong".
Dragh need to vent about servers but idk if it'd be safe to do it here since idk how many people here are on there.
Okay maybe in his mind a civil war might  start but that'd just be him and his family vs pretty much everyone

They said its only extremely rare cases if say he was armed and I hit back to get it off me that may justify it.
Also said I was right not to attack back.
So I went. They'll get back to me on the matter but at least I've reported it and explained what's going on.
As long as I don't hit back the law is still on my side in this situation.
Reporting it to a MET station so can go either way really. At least I'm getting it done.
Like... 1/4 way there?
I stood up to him and got hit. Progress but not gone all in my favor....
Since he's using my terminally ill grandmother as a free pass to get away with shit now, it's going to be worse when she passes away.
I realize something else too. I don't know why it's taken me this long either.
Physically
He assaulted me today
I'm finally gonna report my uncle tomorrow to the police. Today was just extremely bad... I should have a while ago tbh but the line drew today.

Ish cool. *patpat*
Right. Adds a bit of context at least.
Sorry to ask but what is GNC?
As I was saying If for whatever reason that was breached that's be leaking a huge percent of people's data across UK.
Who own PornHub and YouPorn.
Yes. MindGeek.
Also it was said all the checked IDs were being stored in one giant database
Ultimately why it was flawed was two things-

A) it only accounted for porn sites

So stuff like Twitter and Discord you can still get NSFW content without this ID check

B) VPNs
The alternative is paying ¬£5 for a 'Porn Pass' for 24hrs on upto 5 devices or ¬£13 for 1 permanent device
Namely- Passport, Driving Licence, Credit Card or Birth Certificate as listed.
Essentially you had to present forms of ID to prove your age.
The reason it didn't go through in April or July was there was no way to make it happen with the EU Privacy Protection laws in place.
A) The system presented was flawed.
B) It was a way for UK gov to collect data more private data on top of what they have.
For multiple reasons.
Yeah
This is actually super important

I'll just wait for reviews. Usually I don't follow em but this is a rare case I might have to.
One day it's a 'remake', next day it isn't
It's been extremely spotty
Yeah. Not to worry.

I can see where the misconception could come from seeing as it's being labeled as a remake of a character that Disney already adapted once.
<@238855496797257729> it's based off the original song. Not the animated Disney adaptation
Yikes

Something I'm obligated to do but wanting to do it I feel kinda okay I guess

Something I'm willing to do voluntarily and see it through... I kinda forgot how that feels tbh

Hm... Idk actually know if I feel better after letting that all out
That's the Tl;dr version. I think I'd have been typing for like 3hrs if I explained every small deet
<@83626774000308224> you wanted to say/ask something?
That's done for now I guess
19- okay here's where things started going downhill very fast. I'll try to give the quick version since I was here when it happened. ||So I had to do a .5 version of the course I just did. While having to retake English again due to remark being refused and retakes weren't happening for anyone on the old English GCSE spec.

I came in a bit... Disillusioned. Let's just say. But I met someone. The first person I could say I gave a shit about in a while locally. She was brilliant, perfect even. Eventually I did gain feelings for her and stupidly did confess... Bad move.

She started avoiding me more and whenever I was around interactions became less. Wasn't sure what was up. The first time it happened she cancelled on a sort hang out time I planned for a while with a few other friends because she was having another friend visit so I kinda just went "Okay".

Eventually found out the reason she didn't come over that day was she 'did it' with the friend who came to visit her. She didn't say until after I had gone home to do something that could have gotten me killed but if I didn't someone else might've died. That's a story for another time. 

So bruised and bloodied up and all that's when the guy that did it with her decided to drop the ball on it. Threatening me not to talk to her again. Ultimately I was just angry at myself for wanting to get close to someone again and I was hurt in the process. It kinda was affecting me mentally so I decided to move back home and not finish that year off. And I did recover a bit... Until I turned 20.||

I'm not gonna through the 20 years cause most of you know what happened. Abusive uncle n' all, ran from home, grandmother who raised me (far longer than my actual mom mind you) getting diagnosed with cancer there's a lot that needs to be recapped. Another time though.
Pt. 1 ||So year 14-15 was just what I consider misfortune events tbh

There wasn't anything seriously bad other than blackouts where my brain would shut off even seeking out medical attention.

16- I got into my first but not really relationship. It ended on a bunch of lies being told and emotional trauma being caused. Left me in a pretty bad state to the point I couldn't pick myself up for a while. 

However shortly after, someone I had been helping threw me under the bus. Its a strange story but tl;dr I was dragged in and framed for causing an affair. The person I was helping just needed someone to talk to and moral support cause their boyfriend was cheating with someone overseas. To cover that up they used me. Even she tried to make a move on me but due to my last relationship leaving me in a bitter state I said no, I still have the texts on my old phone. 2 days after I got a message saying we couldn't talk again and rumors about me spread saying I tried to do something I usually wouldn't condone. I lost the trust of a lot of people around that time. 

17- 2016 was a bit if an odd year. But ultimately was due to how college went. I didn't know what I wanted out of life but I didn't have a lot of options due to how poorly my GCSEs were received. (I still have PTSD over this one question about a fucking cow in a higher level English paper). So 1 year went to waste. However it was slowly picking up. The lady I call my best friend I met at a Convention. And towards the end of year 1 I finally figured out what I wanted to do with life. 

18- I changed subjects. It was... Kinda picking up. I did more drawings again, finally made a few new friends but was short lived. Wasn't a day where one person wouldn't argue. Also had to do my 2nd English resit because the 1st was only 50% done. But that was a dud. Only a few marks off but they didn't want to go through and remark it.||

Covering it up so you don't have to read it if you're just coming in
Guess it might help the problem to go through the bad shit. Get it out of my system.
14-20 are kinda considered my worst years but... It didn't really start until I was 16
I think my motivational half kinda went after a series of pretty dreadful events when I was 16 and again when I was 19.

Oh boy story time with Sketch again?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I just need that push to get me going again tbh
I need like a big adrenaline boost or just work towards something so I'm not just moping about tired all day
On a more serious note trying to pull myself together is kinda rough
Kinda just feels like...
Just every time I try to do something since I got back into the country I kinda just falter and hit a wall
Idk
<@302063351767498752> I'm not sure having Asperger's would affect getting a job nowadays compared to 5 years ago
That's the strangest thing I've read donated. Although that said damn Yumi :(
Most of what I have to do has been relegated to working from 9PM-5/7AM.

and back up again in 2hrs to look after grandparents.
Perhaps only 10hrs of sleep since Monday
I'm just so broken after this week
So I've managed to rework my deadline for my work thing that'll allow me to finally have more stable income for an extra three months. So the work deadline is now March as opposed to Jan. 

Cause stuff at home really hasn't allowed me to do anything to work towards that and caring for both my grandparents which one of them is terminally ill btw has taken up all my day time.

I'm so tired honestly. I need someone to give me a hug or something.
Well I haven't accepted any new projects from my current job. I'm not required to come in unless I'm on something. Latter is possible but due to appointments for my grandma really depends when. Upcoming week might be more flexible to work with.
Also a case of her having to go up and down the country since she doesn't live in London with me
I have mom to help out too but even then she doesn't have as much time as I do.
Pls <:sadmiku:557524716265537547>
Hm... That's a tough one to answer really. I want to say no but I have no justification behind my answer
I have questions now for who I am now but also like maybe for the best I guess
There's probably a reason tbh I haven't seem him in 16 years not even call or a letter but hey ho guess we'll never really know.
My old man couldn't come to UK and my mom didn't want me going back and fourth between UK and JP
My mom didn't really have anyone else to help raise me or my sister tbh...

My dad was overseas

Sister's had a restraining order that lasted until she was 12

Grandparents were they only people she could turn to.
It's basically what my grandparents did for my mom. She wanted to move up to someplace outside London so grandparents offered to look after me and my sister until she had everything settled.
Like if I was in a good financial spot and I can provide for them sure maybe.

If not then I can raise them until they're old enough to take over.
What's your plan?

Well depends on context of help
If I already know then...
Who's the other parent
23 years or older that's fine
Obviously when they're a teen
Okay so I said I didn't want kids but like if I found out my kid got someone pregnant the first thing I'm asking is "THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!"
I don't think so no
Yee
I'm guessing they're leaving it to him from what he's said.
.... Hahahahaha...
I'll pass on the romance. After screwing myself over and over I'm better off without it... Unless someone wants to cosplay Galo Thymos and have me call them Daddy LMAO
I'm a pretty hopeless loner so hey ho the job is basically doing itself... I just have to wait another 19 years so I can become a wizard
Yes
Tbh as much as people said I could be a pretty good dad I don't wanna think of having kids until I'm 6ft under LMAO
Which is a problem considering who's gonna look after the baby then?
He's able to claim benefits especially how young they are as long as they're working or in education full time...
We're from the UK
Not impossible but difficult
Raising a baby and a girlfriend when you are not earning much from a labour job is  very difficult.
I have concerns since he said he'll settle on a fulltime job after college... Which is going to be very difficult
Past the date to get *that* done
<@115744398997716995> they're keeping it
<@279341087494242304> you'd be right in thinking so
They're having the baby but they're still very young
I'm still trying to wrap my mind round this
Well he got his girl pregnant who's 19, turning 20 in a few weeks
... As in he's only 18
And he's 2 years and 2 months younger than me
One of my friends is pregnant
So I got hit with a freight train news
The chemo is working
Yee
Positive :')
We got the results
So my grandma went to see if the chemo is having any affect on the cancer today
Well Bexit Party
Welp. Goes to show how redundant UKIP really are.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

Trump is just a billionaire fulfilling an Ego

BoJo is just Prime Minister based on an inside joke we know nothing about
Oh god has it really sunken that low?
Last time I heard Coalition the tories wanted to form one with DUP
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I mean Boris
Basically the last 10 year round up since Cameron became prime minister, then Theresa May now BlowJob Johnson https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1204728905766227969?s=19
They used to be called the tory party way back in the day
Wait so concerning the votes that didn't go through in Cardiff what will happen?
Boris believes hiding in a fridge will cryogenically freeze himself. True story.
Oh we talking shit about Boris?
I heard the turnout aas pretty awful
We should be worried the tories have the majority this early right...?
They're more rounded
Or well looking at monitors
I guess I'll only use them for reading as opposed to all the time now.
They can still sit on my face fine
<@115744398997716995> the right arm went missing this morning. But it's been busted since Friday
Otherwise I'd have put it in the photo, not to sound rude
That's the main problem
"that can be fixed"

Yeaaaaaaah about that... Everyone seems be ignoring the fact the right arm of the glasses are missing...
<:ver2:248770589458694147>
"Don't invest in the spare pair" she said

It's cause they broke
To now
End of 2016 I think?
>needs to get money from savings to get a replacement pair of glasses

>gets nagged at for needing new glasses
Basically...
Did they forget?
Remember when Boris became PM and people wwre dreading it?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Literally just saw a woman go "She voted tories because she doesn't like Corbyn"

... And Boris is better?!
Oh wow there's protest going on
Channel 4 news lady: The people have spoken and said let's get brexit done!

... Speak for yourself.
Welp...
<:SGGarie:263726163510165504>
Really depends where you look I guess?
What's trending?

"People require photo ID to vote"

... Wait was this not a thing before? Kinda makes sense
Tories be like that
I'm not surprised
Hm... I suppose it depends if you already have one or not. If not, I can understand why people might be upset.
Man... All we can do is sit back and *sigh*
"We're voting Conservaties because we don't like Corbyn"

... You know there are 2-3 other parties you could have voted for that wouldn't have won or just not.
Remember how people voted against Corbyn for not liking him... Implying they would prefer BlowJob here to be Prime Minister.
Oh no even better
And how the difference was literally less than a %
Remember when Brexit was essentially just one whole "Nah the nation wouldn't want that"
He had remote smart plugs installed around the house the house so I unplugged all of them. Put it in a lock.
Well an abusive one at this point.
Melua he's been at this kinda shit for 13 months. Everyone knows at this point he's a DQ
No kids
So I've taken all the chromecasts, tech etc from around the house he can remote control via the internet
So now no one can watch normal TV
My uncle has put a child lock on the TV
So basically the cold war all over again?
Isn't this his last year of presidential run anyway? If they let him rerun for president they're making a fucking mistake imo
This seems very fucked
Was there any reason why he launched a drone?
Wtf is going on?!
>wakes up

>3 days into 2020 and I'm already seeing WWIII trending
https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/1213209203432665092?s=19
I try not to let my thoughts go further than they should
But no apparently they don't wanna acknowledge it and I'm in the wrong.
"Why don't you get it treated"

I went to go see a therapist in 2018. All of that was undone when my uncle became more abusive.
They really think I can just turn it off and on like a switch
"W-why do you not talk to us?"
Family: If you ever have a problem you can tell us!

Also family: Pft to your depression. It's not important.
New decade isn't even 2 weeks old and this shit is happening...

Hrm... Ultimately its just satire. Also as far as abridged humor goes there can be worse.
Really hope they can recover from this
Really fucking upset over this
https://twitter.com/Runawayturist/status/1219870381466669057?s=19
After events occuring today I may be looking into moving into a new place in a few months for definite.
So... I kinda have a change of plan but good news.
I don't wanna say more than that because I may end up saying something you don't wanna hear
I feel nothing but contempt rn
She's trying to act like last night didn't even happen
"Oh your depression doesn't matter"

... Thanks that's all I needed to hear mom
<@238855496797257729> I feel your pain. I am the same with my abusive uncle.
So like tl;dr I caught my uncle stealing my stuff. Just a PS2 for now that was modded which can go for a bit on the market. I found out and got upset. Then mom and I started arguing because she didn't wanna hear the truth he has been abusive or just did that. And basically told me to fuck off. (paraphrasing but basically was the equivalent of) 

Which I got extremely upset about to the point I started crying since we've never argued like this. Ever. So I talked to a few friends and an outsource SugarPunch editor who happens to be a very close friend irl has offered for me to move in with him and his pal in a few months.
I'll still be in London but living with friends.
No I don't think he's here but still
Tbh I should have went out since I had everyone feed me the same BS about trying to get along with my uncle.
After the shit from last night no fucking way I'm going downstairs
"You have to be happy because its Luna New Year"

What kind of false optimism bullcrap is that?
My aunt told me grandma is going into hospital and mom goes blaming me for not coming down to eat
That statement would start with "No"
If the coin really wanted to be truthful....
"We want to make peace with you which is why we're leaving byeeeeeee"
... Why does that statement on the coin feel like a massive lie? https://twitter.com/hmtreasury/status/1221333864423022593?s=19

Is there any reason The Guardian has done this to the firefighters in the French riots video when in the actual video there's noone on the with facepaint on
Even then the last few days haven't been the easiest to interact with anyone that isn't my sister.
It's fine dw about it
^
She's a hard one to make understanding how things are and how they work.
She'll still think the same way afterwards.
Which it isn't
She keeps thinking depression is a state of sadness.
I've kinda come to the point of not wanting to come out. I've spent maybe 20 minutes outside of my room since Friday night.
She hasn't exactly been making it better since. Comes into my room and just keeps pushing the idea I'm in the bad because my depression has been making me very demotivated since Friday.
Well Saturday I was not in the best of state and not wanting to come down to socialize with the family for Luna New Year. My aunt came up to tell me grandma is going into hospital but as soon as I went to go into her room to see what was happening mom goes blaming me for grandma's hospitalisation because I didn't come down and eat.

The cause of why she's in hospital was related the cancer affecting her liver.
I've been extremely depressed and mom keeps coming in and thinking its okay to make things worse
The last 4 days haven't exactly been the brightest either.
>has medically diagnosed depression since 2016

>has told family

"You can just turn it off and on right?"
Around 80s
82 I think?
Just came back from the hospital this morning
Mom
So I've just been told my grandma might only have 2 weeks left
Having a month away from the chemo definitely spread the cells quicker. She was off it because she had the flu which could have made the whole thing worse if they kept her on.
Grandma is being moved to the hospice again but she won't be coming home
Just everything happening rn is kinda scarring me tbh
I'm kinda struggling how to react atm
On topic of the virus China is really hiding away the full picture if someone has to go out of their way to post a video about what's going on.

Was gonna suggest the Persona 3 movies but Netflix seems to think it's okay to just have Movie 2
That's UK Internet for ya
Welp.
I mean I have. We didn't finish it together.
Used to use it with my Ex to watch movies. Never did finish Deadpool
Oh yeah... Forgot Rabbit does that
Yeah just had a look. Non of the Madoka movies are on Netflix(UK)
Was this AM or PM? Could've totally swung by. And not sure anything Madoka related is on Netflix...
<@284390402210136064> what time zone are you based in?
MAL is still down so can't get info on this...
Another Netflix animu... But its not in 3D
Anyone watched AICO yet?
It was okay
How did you... Yes.
I've seen a movie made from the studio behind Monogatari.
So... What's the donut anime?
>doesn't know the anime
... >plays funeral music
What's the red box mean?  <@284390402210136064>
Although Katsumi Ono ruined S4 of Yu-Gi-Oh! Himself
<@456226577798135808> 4kids in a nutshell with almost anything?
That's how we'll watch it
Let's Watch the 4Kids version of One Piece.
700+ pieces more like
Cause I suggested this
What about if its a set of movies?  <@256945399338631168>
It's one of those anime I see and say I'll get there but never happens.
How to identify a Bones anime: 
do the male characters have square fingers?
This is like when I found out Bones did DTB
Shaft did Madoka?
Welp
I did wanna get Gen 6 tbh but again no console and cause I usually watched the show alongside playing the games didn't keep up with it.
I saw a gif of it. That's it really.
All I know about XY is that Sereena kisses Ash at the end. Blame Jlist.
To Ibu
And how come?
I got as far as Oshawott and Meowth tries to win that Cat pok√©mon only to find out its a guy
>still hasn't finished B/W
Plus living in UK, yeah fuck watching the show on CITV...
Didn't keep up with pok√©mon cause didn't have the system to play Gen 6 on.
I liked it up to Gen 5.
I meant that short where Pikachu accidentally falls out the hotel room and gets back in but there was a surprise party or something to celebrate Ash and Pikachu's anniversary
Anyone remember that pikachu short where Ash celebrates the anniversary of him and Pikachu getting together in a hotel room? (this sounds horribly suggestive)
Oh look its the smash character in pokemon
Funny how the guy who saved Symphogear ruined OG YGO halfway through with S4 and Capsule Monsters
I actually need to find it and watch it. I've seen the clip xD
Deadpool did get an anime where he was voiced by Dio
Feel like 2 completely different movies to me for some reason.
Deadpool 2 was funny. Can't really put it side by side with the first one though
They needed to get baby legs in there somehow.
<@256945399338631168> think its bad in the movies? Play the game.
Her story is a little sad really towards the end of her solo comic run. She thinks cause her comics are ending, she'll be gone.
She has DP's 4th wall and bloodlust but no healing factor.
Literally named... Gwen Poole
Gwenpool is someone else.
Deadpool comics > literally anything else related to deadpool
And Gwenpool
Tbh I only really care about X-Men and some of the Deadpool comics.
Surprised Queen wasn't playing in the credits
I grew up playing a lot of Marvel fighters. So sorta fell into Marvel media through that.
Basically Mark Rufflo went in an interview everyone dies.
According to Mark Rufflo
Infinity War?
LMAO
I said something about Pokemon XY a moment ago
... Woops.
My eyes are beginning to ache a little
I've been surrounded by 3 today due to rendering the same video over and over due to small hiccups
^
Eh. Don't like looking at screens for too long tbh
Every time I walk into JPBooks there's loads of One Piece...
Gives you all the important bits
Or just play Pirate Warriors 3
Is Sun and Moon game worth playing without Gyms? (I'll move that discussion to gaming if I need to)

It's better than all of 3.33
https://youtu.be/ZGRxRbjEEUs <@99695384296701952>  <@264373970118246400>
So lets stick a Battle Royale bomb necklace on Shinji
Oh man when FUNi had to redub the whole movie because Anno wanted a "serious tone"
Also Anno man. Blames Shin Godzilla for why we haven't got a 4th movie before 2020
Why did Anno feel the need to change it?
Langley Shikinami?
What was it?
Cause of that photo shown to Shinji of his mom and Asuka is in there woth her mother but also strikes a strong resemblance to Mari
There's a theory that Mari is Asuka's cloned mother or something
Inb4 Mari turns out to be a clone of Asuka
I actually wanna know what was the original 3.33
1.11 was fine. 2.22 was good. 3.33 sucked.
<@99695384296701952> what's your opinion on the Rebuild movies?

I still have the DVD
I was 5... All I remember was pretty colors üòÇ my first anime as well
Like everyone had pok√©mon and YGO, Duel Masters and Beyblade... "Nah. Let's show Kaz these anime. He'll get older to appreciate them"
>ends up watching everyone turned into what I thought was orange juice at the time
(2006)
Honestly don't know why my uncle had me watch bits of Berserk 97 when I was 7
Nope <@99695384296701952>
Berserk...
My childhood was messy...
Uncle used to sit me down in front of a lot of old stuff like City Hunter and Wicked City...
That was my fault that time....
Hm... I'd say Devilman OVAs.
Although just to make Ibu happy... What's the oldest anime anyone has watched?
Like this bit in Austin Powers https://youtu.be/SjnWOnJK-zw
I feel like it's saying whenever someone talks Japanese we see subtitles in English below them
Always found it weird when people differentiate the JP audio and EN audio by dub and sub
Oh my...
Wasn't some April fool's joke was it?
I was hibiki taking a nap in Ep 10 lol
Where have I been?
2?!
There's a new FLCL?
Anyone know what this is?
I need to though
>never seen Outlaw Star
Not sure why I forgot lol
And Cowboy Bebop
City Hunter
Actually scratch what I said
Not sure I've actually seen anything from SRW
To this day I still haven't bothered with it.
I know Nana is in a lot of things but Cross Ange happened to pop on my radar cause Nana was in it.
Cross Ange I know as that other series with Tsubasa as a blonde chick.
Anyone else remember how they hyped up the reveal in Japan so much in 2012 for 3.0?
Or really the actual title: Retcon of Evangelion
Wait for Anno to make a ReReReRebuild of it.
I hate the fact the killed off everyone who's considered a side character off
Kaworu: get in the robot ;)
>near the end
Kaworu: oh fuck. Shinji this was a mistake.

I'd reckon a Kylo Ren mask is close enough

It wouldn't be a problem if it was standard price but this was something I did have to think about ordering....
Can't open it yet cause there's a few dents in it. Gonna see if anything can be done about it before opening it.
O.O
BIG

Mystery box but I think it's Big Anime
<@284390402210136064> huh. I thought we were. Hm. Mistake on my half. Apologies
yeah was curious about that. How is it?
Anyone seen the new FMP series? Any good?
Oh damn. Good thing I moved to London in time. There was a screening where I was living but at least I got to see it on a bigger screen. Although let the AllTheAnime team know so future movies can be screened in your cinema~ <@256945399338631168>
https://myanimelist.net/anime/35851/Sayonara_no_Asa_ni_Yakusoku_no_Hana_wo_Kazarou If you got 2hrs then I really recommend this
It's about an Iorph(sorta like an elf?) who raises a human boy after being separated from her clan and finding the boy as a baby with his death mother. I cried.
<@284390402210136064> Yeah. One night screening in UK tho
SO... Anyone in UK Watch Maquia?
I really need to get watching that series...
Anyone know who dis and where from?

Well blackish purple

Anyone know the name of that black haired ninja girl?

My buddy loves 2.22. Now to ruin it by making him watch 3.33 cause I need him to hurry up with Symphogear already
https://twitter.com/fondlyRegarded/status/1040063258395373568
Tank already has a best match.
So should I catch up till Ep 11?
^quietly preaching

Tbh I wonder what caused FUNi to drop Symphogear? I wanna guess music rights but Sentai Filmworks have no problem doing Love Live
Not sure info regarding Voice Actors were shared. They didn't get as far as getting Ep 3 onwards finished so who knows?
They only got as far as 2 eps
FUNi fact: FUNimation had plans to localize Symphogear to the west. It never happened.
CR x FUNi partnership will cease soon

So talking about Ulysses in the SugarPunch server
Also SOMEONE PUT A SYMPHOGEAR THING HERE
Hosoda exhibit today
Had a theatrical release during the summer and a US release in September
Japanese home release isn't for another week and a bit sadly
Maquia? Yup.
Anime movies need a mother appreciate sub category
Definite must watch
https://youtu.be/AEWvRqZQ0RU
It's about a slowly aging Iorph adopting a boy she finds in an invaded village and the life of raising the boy.
I need to get on Twintails. 

But anyway if you guys do like a one off movie night I really recommend 'Maquia: When the promised flower blooms'. (if the JPN home release has dropped) 

On the surface its basically parenthood the anime No 2 behind Wolf Children
*watch sympho*--

>remembers which server this is

... *watch Maquia*
>watches Goblin Slayer "Controversial" clip
Sky High is what happens when Varrick from Legend of Korra adapts BnHA before BnHA existed.

Where do I start with Monogatari?

Or in other words... Wasted potential.
Every Japanese artist I know just lewds up the black haired chick I'm actually curious now.
Is SSSS. Gridman actually worth watching?
I've seen worse protagonists tbh
Kirito as a protag is fine imo. Its everything around it how it happens to just fall in place in his favor.
That had me laughing like a fuckin moron.

The manga itself is fairly okay. If you ignore what already is existing you'll find some satisfaction with it but that's like a tough task to do in its own right
Kawahara(?) tried fixing it with another Manga but was a bit too late
Apparently writing for SAO started before 2010 so idk
I think the problem with SAO's earlier stuff is its dated stuff.
Haven't since
Like years ago.
It's been a while for me. I saw it when I was 10?
Aside from Bebop the Movie but I need to rewatch that
It's the only anime tie in movie I've actually enjoyed to date.
Although God mode right at the end sorta dropped everything good about it for just.... That.

Everything before it I was actually rather happy with.
I was genuinely surprised
I went to the UK Cinema release a while back.
All I'll say is Ordinal Scale as a movie is actually pretty good
Like in another world with my smartphone

Oh shit imagine growing up watching (and enjoying?) the cheesy toei devilman series just to eventually watch Crybaby and have your childhood ruined right there.
She's too precious
Hidaka is best girl
Hi-Score Girl is a cute show
No context
Within the photos
Not saying anything in defence of Vic but I find some of the supposed allegations hard to believe to some degree. 

Of course the forced kissing photos was something that can be classed as grooming and anything I heard while he was at MCM Expo here in UK was a huge red flag but some of them said he "had humped [them] during the photo" despite no contact with the lower area with the recipient
What happens if he starts making out with the burgers?
They delivered
They were asked for a statement

I feel escapism is probably the most relatable one for most people myself included
It's a pretty good modern adaptation that touches on a lot of relevant topics nowadays
Anyway you may continue Meta
Thus people complaining about the changes really don't factor how topics of mental health and escapism are more prominent than when Go Nagai wrote his original manga
What was relevant in the 70s might not be either relevant now or a topic of discussion that would piss a lot of people off
... I'd like to talk a little about Devilman for a moment
Like here's the thing, between now and when Go Nagai's original manga stuff has changed like a lot
An okay adapatation
It was....

Neon Genesis Evangelion.
I NEED TO LIVE TO SEE THIS THROUGH
OH LORD
They're redubbing NGE for the Netflix release
It'll be 6.50GBP
Netflix don't exactly have to find a completely new guy.
Actually.... Why wasn't David Harbor Jet?
I would say Keanu would make a good vicious if anything.
Also voicing a cat with? Peele and Key
He busy with John Wick and Bill and Ted.
Really?
I mean don't get me wrong John is great but....
Why John Cho tho?
The cast of Netflix's Cowboy Bebop... Oh
I maybe should have said as well I try to separate art from the artist. It's bad enough I'm having to do that already with both Kenshin and the new Samurai Shodown with Yoshitora being in the game, the character that he created for Samsho 5. 

Like yeah what Watsuki did is bad, I never once said I'm letting him off the hook and I'm still heartbroken by that and that feeling is probably never going away, this is something I have been saying since day 1 of his arrest.

But like I said separating the work he's done and trying to enjoy the work on it's own. 

And if I offended you I apologize but that said I wanted to enjoy today's announcement and I somewhat knew there might be a potential risk(evident by that passive comment) but I also know there might have been someone that'd like to hear about it. There are still people that are passionate about the series but find it difficult enough people are constantly being reminded that this had happened.
There is something I could easily say that could make me a bad if not the shittiest person in this server. But I do believe sometimes certain opinions have to be held back. And somethings that doesn't take a 2nd thought to be said.

It's clear that yes you don't like it, but don't let your personal grudges rub off and ruin it for anyone that likes this especially for those involved. 

It's bad enough it happens with the likes of Star Wars. Please don't make it a normality. It's a toxic form of behavior.
Like I shouldn't
No but you're shaming it
So do you believe no one should be allowed to like RuroKen anymore?
You might as well start on Michael Jackson then. He had a much worse history.
Again he's not nothing to do with these two
His name isn't even on it anymore
He's not even getting paid for the Hokkaido arc
Constant shaming/holding grudges is never healthy. Doesn't Symphogear GX basically say that
Plus Nobuhiro Watsuki has no ties to the series anymore. It's all his wife now.
:/
Bit childish to go "I hope it doesn't do well"



You did see the other films right?
It can only be a Rurouni Kenshin movie if One OK Rock does the music
KENSHIN'S GETTING A FINAL OUTING

Ohhey Ricky is back
```When a young man‚Äôs telekinesis is discovered by the military, he is taken in to be turned into a super weapon and his brother must race to save him before Manhattan is destroyed by his powers. Kaneda is a bar owner in Neo-Manhattan who is stunned when his brother Tetsuo is abducted by Government agents lead by the Colonel. Desperate to get his brother back, Kaneda agrees to join Ky Reed and her underground movement who are intent on revealing to the world what truly happened to New York City 30 years ago when it was destroyed.

Kaneda believes their theories to be ludicrous, but after facing his brother again is shocked when he displays telekinetic powers. Ky believes Tetsuo is headed to release a young boy. Akira, who has taken control of Tetsuo‚Äôs mind, Kaneda clashes with the Colonel‚Äôs troops on his way to stop Tetsuo from releasing Akira, but arrives too late. Akira soon emerges from his prison courtesy of Tetsuo as Kaneda races to save his brother before Akira once again destroys Manhattan island as he did thirty years ago.```
I have problems with the Akira live action movie plot.

Probably getting paid more to push promotion.
There's a famous movie in Japan where a Gyaru learns how to English within an entire semester from bimbo to university level.

The moral is never put yourself down because of how clever you think you are. If you're willing to succeed then you'll get there.
Dedication my friend.
Even basic knowledge is better than non
Start learning now. It'll pay off sooner than you think ^^
I'm multilingual so figured might as well
Aight. I also got the remake recently so I'll be delving into that soon too.
By watching the anime
Figured with the new game coming out in 3 months might as well see what all the hype is about...

He knows Gunkata
Bebop Live Action to be put on hiatus after production injury with leading actor John Cho https://twitter.com/DEADLINE/status/1185323939821522944
There goes any hope I had for Eugeo
Oh no...
I've yet to see SAO 3. Apparently it's better?
^
Say what you want about the plot, OST was always good.
SAO OST was actually okay
https://youtu.be/fnbJiRApGKM

This is definitely a sequel to SAC

Miso watching Doctor's Stone'd?
Trueblade speaks my language
There wasn't really a moment where I got up and was like YES!
The fights are the highlight of the series
Everything was just okay
6/10
On Ep 12 but I feel I can give my verdict already
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Not "IT'S THE WORST THING ON THE PLANET"
I said "Okay"
I seem to have caused a misconception
....

You can have that one
HEY...
>not a fan of Toku

EXPLAIN THIS  <@279341087494242304>
Dude
Uh...
.
.
I can see the appeal but like... That's it really
Okay is the best way I can put it
Think I'm like Ep 6 or 7
It's like the most mediocre thing I've seen
4 eps into Gridman
Which is weird cause I don't have this problem with other characters that have hair that flicks out slightly
The tips of Rikka's hair in pictures mildly annoy me
Lol
I'm watching OG Garo now
Guess I'm gonna find a compressed version of it later
Hm...
Now I can finally decide if it was worth it or nah
Yeah
So...
And also its taking up like 25GB on my Hard Drive
I just needed to see what the fuss was about cause I'm a Toku/Kaiju fan
Me before Promare: looks cool

I'm definitely gonna cosplay Lio Fotia
The OST slaps
It's got Johnny Yong Bosch so I'm gonna go see it again
<@256945399338631168> no English Dub on Thurs??? D:

They also get a mini fan booklet
A shitposter/artist I know got the Aniplex release.... Here's the 1st bonus
I got the Amazon one
<@246146781832806401> hope you ordered from the right shop...
Agreed. It pains me to actually see this tbh.

It's an amazing film people deserve to experience, maybe my new feature favorite. I would have expected people to behave a bit better...
These are the three most prominent ones I heard today https://twitter.com/Garurusama/status/1204067804023910400?s=19
I've been hanging around the r/Promare server... We've all been dreading what's been said...
<@99695384296701952> you heard about thr horror stories too?
Promare in a nutshell
Eps are nice and short so I can watch it on a bus
I'm liking it so far.
It's... Interesting

REMEMBER YOU ARE BLAZING
STILL YOUR HEART IS BLAZING
IF THE WORLD MAKES YOU
I DON'T NEED A NEW WORLD ORDER
YOU... SOON YOU WILL KNOOOOW
WE ALREADY KNOW THE SMELL OF THE GAME
That is Bullshit BLAZING
STILL MY HEART IS BLAZING
IF I LOST MY WISH 
I DON'T NEED A NEW WORLD ORDER
YOU
CAN'T FEEL A THING
WE ALREADY KNOW THE SMELL OF THE GAME
Do you know who you are
When you speak your words?
*inaudible screamo*

[Something something actual lyrics help]
*ehem*
I know who I am
The moon light lake told me
"This is who you are"
My fangs are so long, my nails are sharper than ice
That is me
I wonder what that will prove?
That is bullshit!
Blazing! Still my heart is blazing!
If the words killed me
I don't need a new world order
You... Soon you will know
We already know the smell of the game.

Anyone that plays fighterz https://twitter.com/BandaiNamcoUK/status/976020526077480962?s=19
Probably be free this weekend if I finish Bayo collection after tomorrow
Yup yup. Its 'KenshinGWs01'  <@174440042289168384>
You're making tempted to ask to play some time now lmao
What system dood?
<@174440042289168384> ya tried Noctis yet?
Gotta feel sorry for development team though
I've seen Auto combos from screens
At least MVCI had 30 characters
Arc System are basically using Evo to sell the game cause players will make it look good
"I want to support the game much longer" my ass
Mori's excuse was rubbish
Evo is basically free advertising if you think about it
Again.
My Jubei is DLC.
Cross Tag Battle
<@98541382393688064> CTB...
Saw the first one on PSN YEARS ago
Ooo I think I know of this game.
This is the reason the word "why" exist.
I love dumb things but... This
As someone that plays this game ever so often... Yes. This is dumb.
Wtf?
https://twitter.com/noobde/status/976590180013416448?s=19
Oh?
Actually something I need to give attention to is Central fiction
IJ2 is badly animated and looks janky af but it's alright enough to have fun
I needed relearn Tekken in general. Played way too much IJ2 and FighterZ
I have to make sure I'm not holding down one of the kicks during execution otherwise it completely cancels it. Used to hold on until she does it.
I can sorta say the same for Xiao but in terms of what happened between Evo and Geese Patch.
People still play Asuka tho?
Got her in Bikky colors too
Main her yee
Well... Good for me lmao
This is fine
https://twitter.com/ika1024/status/976355165165924353?s=19
Alsl Paul's iM@S skin.
Summer lesson skins and shit. The stuff that was recently announced
Also what you guys reckon about the arcade exclusive stuff?
Jin feels different in 7
I'm so rusty I didn't realize Xiaoyu's been nerfed since the last time I played
One more week till Bardock
I feel like its lacking compared to T6 and Tag 2
The home release for T7 could have been better imo
So theu don't cover the whole arm in the original?
Oh. I get it now.
Never really noticed before. Will need to look this up later.
For Jin? Are they different in 6 and 7?
Can't customize him to have other clothes
It's literally everything you see in his launch trailer.
Ugh. Noctis has the WORST customization options.
Or was it blue?
White and Black right?
I only played T5DR
Wasn't 5 Jin just the normal outfit he's been having since T3?
He's even got the stop sign xD
Here's one for laughs
I won't lie though the best 2 costumes I've made are Bikky Xiaoyu and Kazuya Shizuo Heiwajima
Markman said more DLC would be coming in the SP in a video interview so hopefully he's keeping his word and get a proper shirt tie combo
I tried guys...

There was no proper Shirt Tie combo for guys so had to work with what I had. And the hair.
... Sorta
Actually speaking of which I did Genjuro Paul as well
Was trying to find it for a while but decided to load up the game instead xD
<@174440042289168384> Bikky Xiaoyu like I mentioned the other night
I see Katarina being discussed so I leave a prezzie for yall. https://youtu.be/QPnjxcBM8g0
10. Sorry. Not 11
Gonna be joining 7 for a friend. I'm usually on 11(Last time I checked)
Anyway anyone play PSO2?
Is it good enough to "fuck the oscars"
T7's online pissed me off so I threw it into the bag where I keep my beer.
I should have waited though cause could have saved about ¬£50... Like 2 weeks after.
I'll only buy a Collectors Edition as long as it has the Season Pass. No SP no Buy.
I agree on that but I feel I couldn't get hooked on to it. I still have it though cause A. I don't like selling my fighting games and B. I bought the CE cause it had the Season Pass in the EU release of it.
Won't lie MAYBE that's why it didn't get FG of 2017. I'm not one for awards but IJ2 was a little more active for a home release.
Only saving grace for T7 was quite literally the main game itself.
Episode mode was worse than the character episodes in SFV
Back back 3+4
Only thing I know what to do with Heihachi was literally thaf stupid run laugh thing
I'm no Heihachi player either so that was like "Tough shit. You're doing this anyway"!
You try beating Kazuya with Heihachi just to get your ass kicked anyway.
The story was really underwhelming
But this is still great
Last FighterZ thing I'll post today
https://twitter.com/Lythero/status/964165579065131008?s=19
I forgot what I was doing... https://twitter.com/TechnoWhistler/status/978406432897949696?s=09
I had to get that last win.
Think I went ham on FighterZ

Someone made a freecam mod on MGSV. Somehow better than the actual game
Tempted to pick it up later. But got 1 more game from Q1 arriving... Soon. It's out in Japan already just taking it's time to come here in UK.

Is a way out any chance like that Brothers game?
<@174440042289168384> that's awesome
Almost 12 hours.
Guys. I'm almost there.
Rest are fine. I can even put up with BlazBlue's convoluted bullshit. Lmao
Only ones I didn't like were IGAU, MKvsDC, SFV, T7 and MKX. FighterZ is about to join it for how tedious it is.
Not as fanservicey as you'd expect
Actually DOA5's was good for what it was as well
I liked MK9's a bit.
Or both.
This either requires you to constantly tap the button to progress the dialogue or fight endless bots...
At least T7's you can sit through it like a movie.
<@174440042289168384> trust me this is worse.
... You're right  <@145980336071901184>
üò≠
But FighterZ is gonna annoy me since its one character locked off.
We I mean... I am and arent. Only some games.
No.
All for 1 character I'm most likely not gonna bother with
...
We're entering hour 11
Can someone end me now?
Ive... Been at this for 10 hours....
But I want Android 21 due to me being OCD about games
So put it off for a while.
I've been hearing its bad.
Is it bad I'm only JUST touching the story now?
Wanna beat up someone with Papa Bardock LMAO
Anyone play FighterZ?
It's really good.
You spelt all wrong
https://twitter.com/psychoknuckle/status/978312243010945029?s=19
How is it replaying Valkyria Chronicles 1 Remastered feels more fresh than playing a new AAA game nowadays?
...
>waits for FighterZ update

Xrd updates instead
?
Now who's making out of place decisions
Even worse gets included into SC6
>suddenly joins Tekken 10
Anything But Tekken cause A. PS4's online still pisses me off and B. Noctis' inclusion in the game pisses me off.
Someone give me strength to play something while waiting for Bardock? >w<
It's not the worst game in the world but SEGA hyped it up way too much in Japan
Which one?
Also the postman doesn't know how to use rhe doorbell so my copy of Valkyria Chronicles 4 won't show up till Thursday now. :(
Of Doom
Also a mint version of the UAC version?
Speaking as a huge Valkyria Chronicles fan... Azure Revolution looks like a bad attempt of a  Fire Emblem knockoff

It's done.
OH FUCK ONE MORE FIGHT
... That was quick
I need everyone's spirit right now like a spirit bomb üòÇ
Ohhhh
?!
Bah. Probably wait till I've finished Valkyria Chronicles 4 then. Good game.
How so?
I would buy the remaster but I have too much in my backlog library...
I miss Dragon's Dogma....
Eh. Was just curious really
I'm curious I have ZBDPatsFan on PSN. Who else has PSN?
Always wanted to try Trails of Cold Steel
That could be said for Valkyria Chronicles 4 but the west is also getting an XBONE port.
I'm surprised Yakuza is a PS exclusive
Anyone find it odd that Persona Q is still a Nintendo only game when the main source games are only on PS?
Didn't stop P4 on the Vita ;D
Remaster it.
Why remake P3?
... Meanwhile I'm tackling Valkyria Chronicles 4
Oh.
VR?
NieR is good
Gonna pick up the complete edition of HZD when it comes back in stock. I've been wanting to play it for a while.
It's on my get to list.
Hm... Guess there's no rush to play it right now.
Wat you talkin about? VC1 came out on PC and PS4
Yup. The switch version is set to come out in Japan in Summer
Hoping a demo comes out for the switch version soon though. Played the hell out of the demo on PS4.

A bit. Only cause family.
Gosh it's been a while since I got through VC 1's story now... Still need to finish the remaster but 4 is so good
Edy
Even 4 has Edy missions.
No VC game is complete without Edy DLC missions.
Was there DLC to 3? Can't remember now.
Bah.
Physical or??
You make me jealous
...
?!
Could always get a patch ROM I suppose
Like how DB Evolution made Akira Toriyama and Co to do DBZ Battle of Gods so no one would remember Evolution.

Good luck on getting through 3. No western release.
As far as I know Revolution's story is just bad. But did make SEGA realize to go back to using the CANVAS Engine.
VR being dirt cheap is tempting me a little now.
<@263983345669505025> so what came with the limited edition of Revolution?
I really need to play the spin off games...
Watch that video
Any Kingdom Hearts fans here? https://twitter.com/Laaaaaaaagu/status/981181797206671360?s=19
KH3 final mix featuring the MCU
Theeeen FFXV got handed to a guy who's never been involved with any of SE's good decisions including mobile ports
Cause Nomura is a perfectionist.
When NieR Automata does better than FFXV regardless how much content they added.
Think that was odd look what they did for the Origin release

Also whoever did the box art for the Royal Edition needs to get fired. They put the ending as the front cover.
Don't get me wrong I love FF as a series. Even XIII as shit as it is did try and does for a decent guilty pleasure... FFXV however needs to be laid to rest.
Just to get shanked by Ardyn
FFXV's from Chapter 8 onwards was just bad... I literally stopped caring for Lunafreya when she had her huge talk in Chapter 9
The selling point of season pass 2 is Episode Ardyn
Actually not even talks. They announced a 2nd season pass.
There's talks of a 2nd season pass.
Worse.
The "Royal Pack" is ¬£20.
Also buying the game now vs buying the game on release anyone who played it on release sorta got screwed over.
The games as a service model ended up ruining the experience
They murdered it themselves.
FFXV
It did really badly it dropped in price from in UK ¬£45 to ¬£28
Speaking of Square and console ports Dissidia NT. How did they even manage to botch that one up?
Wasn't the console port for Type-0 so bad they stuck a demo for FFXV in there?
That, Chrono Trigger and FF6
I'm just salty the fact SE knows they need to do something with NieR Automata on PC. And still haven't.
XSEED... Well their problem is mainly tied to Marvelous in Japan. They overcharge for additional content for games like Senran Kagura.
Can name a few problems. 

Arc System Works- The current DLC conundrum with BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle. 
BAMCO- they're like A-1 Productions. Good content but treats their employees like shit. 
CAPCOM- Pushing for incomplete fighting games for DLC.
EA- It's EA... 
Konami-... Again, its Konami. 
SE- they're fueling a dead game abd ignoring other potentially great games by doing so. Also those god awful PC ports. 
SEGA- They're getting back up. But they have no idea what they're doing. 
Valve- haven't even released a new game in a long time.
Well publishers
I was saying to a friend the other night how game companies are not in the green for anything. How each company is suffering from bad practices.
I'm fairly wide spread but with soft spots in terms of games and fandom
I've met two... Ah boy they actually poised my opinion on Nintendo for a long time cause "Nintendo Loyalty"... Still doesn't change the fact E3 2015 sucked for Nintendo
Like Star Fox 0
Pure Nintendo fan service
Sad thing is the new Kirby game isn't good.
I think
Both were in the 60,000 zone though so that's good
Same happened to Ni No Kuni 2 as well lmao
Apparently sales flopped in Japan cause of the new Kirby... But ratings wise got a 35/40
I wouldn't imagine SEGA to pass up om remaking 2 and 3 IF 4 does well enough in the west.
Ports won't do them justice like Type-0 HD
I want a remake for them
Ohhh
Is the story good though?
Holy shit Well I've been oblivious to its existence.
Like 2016?
Didn't this series only start a few years ago?
Ohhh
Sen?
I had them on notes on my old phone but I forgot to get them before I swapped to ab android from an iPhone
I need to start using that to manage my games better...
Marvel Infinite was just... Stupid.
I've completed 3 games thus far this year... All fighting game story modes. BBCPEX, Marvel Infinite and FighterZ.
Ah boy. I'm not sure I want to look at my Backlog. It's a bunch of PS3 replays cause I changed PSN accounts and then I was playing catch up on PS4
I'm making bad decisions apparently xD
>buys sonic mania
>expansion DLC announced
...
>buys a switch
>remodel teased
It was so... Lifeless.
Bayo 2 on switch was fun. I had a Wii U but only bought Smash and Xenoblade X on it... Xenoblade X was a mistake.
Will they still have Ruben Langdon voicing Dante? Better be
...
It's coming
God Eater 3?
Code Vein?
As far as I know CC¬≤ only involvement was to shift the engine from the FFXV engine to UE4
I heard they're starting again since they've parted ways with Cyber connect 2
Speaking of FF7... What's even going on with the remake?
*cough* SEPHIROTH *cough*
Otherwise we'd have Noctis in KH... although 2B... Too violent even for KH...
Probably for the best though
Little surprised SE aren't tying any of their IPs to it.
I'm guessing someone knew cause Stan Lee cameo'd right at the end
So how did they manage to snag that?
What's really weird is Big Hero 6 is a Marvel Fox story cause ya know... Their founder was the Silver Samurai...
Actually I can't really say that can I? Big Hero 6 was a Marvel Comic...
I'll add it to my wishlist then
Cheaper?
Did a quick search... And yet I'm willing to buy 10 manga books for 40
Lmao
From an earlier convo sorta figured it out.
She's alright. I get what you mean though xD
She flirts with everything. Even bears
So... Juri-Han from SSFIV
Anna from Shimoneta crazy or Juri-Han?
How crazy we talking?
This... Has my attention
Maybe
Next steam sale
I go for one minute... You're gonna do it until I get it aren't ya?
That includes P5
Or most of it at least
Tempting but lemme defeat my PS4 log first
I... Maybe
Oh dear lord...
Maaaaaybe. Trails in the sky is on my steam wishlist
Although we speaking Butts Kai Schulen from Valky 4 tho... Good butt
Where does one even go from this?
THAT'S IT
CONTRAST
Lmao
My spelling isn't great...
Wait. Maybe I'm spelling it wrong
From hundreds to 80 hours...
Then again that can be said for most games right?
That contrass though...
Like Manga.
I have this odd natrual instinct where I end up putting off buying games but end up buying something else for the same price...
What they look pretty?
They look super pretty but never know why I put them off when I end up spending the exact amount I put off games on Manga...
The problem with living in UK...
What's this Fortnite level BS with multiple season passes?!
I kept up with IJ2 till the end of the DLC run. I'm still keeping up with BBCF and FighterZ. Fighting Climax sorta faded. I have no idea what's going on with GGXrd
Okay managed to put only 4 games on my PS4 to play through. I'm keeping the fighting games there cause they're regularly played.
For me anything fighting game is too much of a priority. Only one I waited out on was KOFXIV. Still haven't bought UNIST yet.
Just those Persona dancing games for me really. DS remastered is tempting but I heard early footage of the switch version was not looking good
Monster Hunter World
DragonBall FighterZ
Dissidia NT
Under Night In-Birth.exe Late[st](or UNIST)
Far Cry 5 (sorta crept up behind... I saw nothing on twitter till the day it came out)
Senjou no Valkyria 4

Loads of stuff and now... Nothing till May xD
Q1 this year as well I'd say
So no new games.
Luckily Q2 has nothing I'm interested in other than Dancing Moon Night and the P5 one.
Guess what I COULD do is delete the other games off my system I'm currently not playing
No idea what I'm doing
Alien Ship
The Stick of Truth
I got stalemated with the shortest one on there currently
PS4 alone
33 games
... This is heavy
Oh boy
Listed most of my backlog...
On console I meant... But at this rate 18 sounds accurate
Ah boy. I'm ashamed to share...
If I wasn't so buried in my current Backlog library I'd happily delve inyo Trails today
I like to spend as much time with the game as I can.
Really? More of looking around and stuff in RPGs.
Adding more JRPGs to my list is always fun
!!
It's there
Oh dear lord. If you've been in the FGC, smash players whining for the Switch port to happen was a total nightmare
Also visuals gave me... Unsettling thoughts.
From what I remember playing you can die when you're not even anywhere near the monsters
XBX was lifeless AF
You thinking to get 2?
I played X... It was okay but the whole game felt lifeless... I can see why people downplay it. It gets boring and repetitive outside the main story with little to do.
From what I've played I like whats there but people are telling me it sits in between 1 and X in terms of how good it is.
Does trying it count?
I want...
>sees what's in season pass for Valkyria Chronicles 4
Oh yeah that patch just happened didn't it?
SFV is still alive?
<@273256087107403777> Ay. Signed by him and Barry Lewis too.
<@200030864497704960> careful what you wish for. They'll make us pay for half the roster.
I'll play anything. Imma be the King of Fighting Games. üòé
Never been one for Sports games personally but would like to try Madden or a basketball game sometime. Just fighters has my attention most of time time.
Guessing wasn't cheap? But hey at least its Tekken on a bigger scale?
Just one has a reduced lag time.
My monitor I use for my PC/PS4 and TV are surprisingly the same size üòÇ
1080p HD or those new UHD ones?
That's huge
WEW
Same monitor but only 1 HDMI port
How big? lol

Also need a HDMI switch for my PC and PS4
And PS2.
Huh... Mine's sorta in front of me bed connected to my PS3 and Switch
How small ia your TV?
On a chair?
I watched Jirard's video on it. Sorta wanna 100%
Clearing a few side quests but I can have it done before the end of tomorrow me thinks
Hopefully I can finish Stick of Truth now
No walkthrough but was pretty stupid how they placed things
Wew I figured out what I needed to do!
This is leaks from Amazon Mexico

It's good imo. Not in my top all time but it's a good JRPG if you have time to spare
Well albeit Saga in Europe was handled poorly so I only played 2...
Gears and Saga were great games
And I'm no stranger to the Xeno series mind you
Ehhh... Gotta respect both sides of the argument friendo.
Tread carefully. "only" should be used loosely
Only positive I can think of is the design of the mechs and open world. Just needed a bit more life to it imo... And story.
Even for Hiroyuki Sawano this was... Obnoxious. And hey I play fighting games. I could listen to infinite loops all day.
So you're able to listen to this on an infinite loop? https://youtu.be/dfk-dQceR3Y
Also really personal gripe... The music was just annoying af. I'm sorry defend all the game you want even the deformed faces but the music I'll never go back to listening to.
Won't try to downplay anyone that likes it but really don't see the need to return to X.
Read somewhere months ago about how it was considered as bad game design especially for how big it was.

Granted my experiences was only about 10 hours of the game but I didn't bother returning to it after that. Sorta just got bored of it from how empty it felt.
Tbf though X was considered a flop.
Hm... You are right about that...
But here's the thing. That was a sequel. They could do anything they want. This is porting a game that utilized both screens.
Cause that was pretty important
Would they exclude the whole map system?
How would a port of XBX work?
But worth it since I scored good
Box Sets and Weiss Schwarz sets.
Funnily enough every time I get taxed its always a symphogear item...
I've been taxed about 3 times. They've altered how the send packages now so they can avoid customs tax. GG CDJ
Like a 10 year old child...
"don't you dare assume we're doing these checks without notifying you"
They pretty good but customer service is mean af. Was asking about if they were doing a verification check on my card since I put an order down and somehow ¬£115 went missing even though its wasn't due for a while. They were mean af with the response....
I'd have suggested CDJapan but depends if you order on there. Its on or off if you'll get taxed though. I've gotten away without getting taxed with all my games. Symphogear got taxed though... Orz
¬£54?!

Then again I imported FighterZ for same price as UK
$75?!
Which version? This is new to me.
Yuri did Ben 10?
Yosuke Hanamura is Spidy
I started again on 7
Which ship?
https://twitter.com/TechnoWhistler/status/982018607793176576?s=19
I used to play FFXIV. But PSO2 was more to my liking
Definitely am gonna drop and get the English releases both PS4 and Switch. Which system do you plan to get it on? <@264373970118246400>
Isara as far as I've seen in the trailer she gets the grenadier class which is new to this game. The main poster girl Riley is also a grenadier.
I'm gonna reattempt the Squad 7 DLC as I think S-Rank on both missions gives you Isara and Welkin as playable characters. I go A-Rank so I got Alicia, Rosie and Largo.
It feels like the sequel the series deserved... Just took 10 years and a bit to realize it wasn't going anywhere as a handheld. The new class as well is surprisingly good. I'm 5 chapters in and can't stop replaying chapters to get an S-Rank in Normal mode.
Yup. Got the 10th anniversary edition. <@264373970118246400>
Yup <@263983345669505025>

Also my bad. Get some rest.
OMG If you complete the the Squad 7 crossover DLC chapter in Valkyria Chronicles 4 you can have members of Squad 7 join your team. <@263983345669505025>
Gotta weebify yourself with the most Japanese of games  <@102691114762371072>-san ;D
And my opinion stays the same. Momo so useless even her character arc changed nothing
<@98541382393688064> arguably one of my two favorites
Momo is useless
I wanna chime in on this BnHA talk...
This game has more pointless expansions than both destiny games put together https://twitter.com/thegamersjoint/status/982346436003024896?s=19
Maaaaaybe.
If only me bestie would let me hug her... Sadly she's all the way on the other end of where I live and its 3AM so fuck knows if shes awake üòÇ
What to do this morning...
I see go to sleeo and I literally just woke up... It's 3AM
Chapter 7/18
I don't want Valkyria Chronicles 4 to end but its so good. I can't stop.
You can play MELTY anywhere
https://twitter.com/autisticbimbo/status/976688438706606080?s=19
Please send help
I've been on it non stop
Can someone actually take Valkyria Chronicles off me?
I unlocked Edy... :|
From the rate of how many weapons I'm unlocking in this game I don't think I have to worry how much DCT(money) I have.
I heard the Hard EX DLC for this game(4) is ballistic difficult
Which one?
And Mission 3 is only unlocked via getting an S on mission 2
This was actually harder to get an S-Rank than I thought simply cause Mission 2 requires you to move very specially and chance of AI being dumb
S-RANKS ALL AROUND ON VALKYRIA CHRONICLES SQUAD 7 DLC
Oh god
Couldn't do the final boss cause the bots kept respawning. Solo.
It was so buggy
<@273256087107403777>
Right?
The only problem I can see with that is repeating Grimm Eclipse... Y'all know how bad that game is too...
<@263983345669505025> Geah Fighting game more like :P
Not having properly seen the anime or tje existing games I feel KanColl needs a musou game with what character designs exist. All in favor?
He's looking well though. I swear he never ages.
When you realize both Tatsuya Fujiwara and Kitano Takeshi are in Yakuza 6. What Battle Royale reunion is this?
Just not now. >->
I mean I COULD...
I wish I could pull that off https://twitter.com/TYOKOBO5/status/984658438276853760?s=09

Anyone for NieR here?
AWWWWAAAAAHHHHHHHH
https://gematsu.com/2018/04/valkyria-chronicles-4-for-switch-delayed-to-fall-in-japan
^True...
This is the stuff that makes me try less at college. Half assed stuff.
Someone got paid for this as well
The colors are really putting me off looking at it. I'm sure they had better options?

The box art is REALLY bad
My Hero One's Justice
Oh dear lord the western title for BnHA game is so... Bad
I can watch this on loop and still find it funny without context
That completely threw me off for a second since I'm playing Danganronpa and there's a character called Aoi Asahina... <@174440042289168384>
Tempted to one shot Danganronpa 1 tonight
Feel like there's missing context
Meme and a what now?
That's ironic. It's the other way around for me. Long live Dissidia 012 Duodecim
RIP my Pok√©mon days.
Before the screen went white
My sister broke the hinge of my DS. It lasted 5 more years after that.
See I keep hearing about that but never had a chance to play it.
I had it on my first phone via a SNES Emu. Didn't finish it cause the phone bricked itself...
Straight up port of the mobile version with the bad textures and fonts
The PC port was so bad on launch
Like Chrono Trigger
I need to play 6. Just waiting for the PC port to be fixed...
FFVII was the first to make the 3D Jump from SNES to PS1 if memory serves me correct
Good point
XI or XIV?
<@273256087107403777> FFVII imo is one that lingers a bit but in a good way. Just  tread carefully with the spin offs.
Also the last thing I heard in a summary video https://youtu.be/BavI7qdz8Ug
Hm... As much negativity I'm giving its laying out with whats been said and shown off.
And doing all the eps at once would be unreasonable otherwise they'd release them all at once as a full game.
<@102691114762371072> <@145980336071901184> it was revealed last they are still working on Ep 1 since they departed from CC¬≤. And at a press event they redid Cloud so he's "more purple"
So they've spent all this time on Ep 1 how long is it between the episodes?
What's more concerning is this shit is episodic.
Or if it's anything to go by FFVII will STILL be on PS4 in 2029
At this rate I delcare FFVII remake episode 1 to be available in 2029 on PS6
<@263983345669505025> that's being too generous
They had CyberConnect¬≤ move everything to Unreal Engine 4 to make the gameplay more like Kingdom Hearts then scrapped that version then are redoing what we saw back in 2015 without CyberConnect¬≤'s help
The PSX Gameplay from 2015 isn't the game anymore
Actually what makes me laugh about Squeenix now is FFVII remake
They'd rather funnel more into FFXV which still has a lower score than NieR Automata
<@102691114762371072> you think SE are THAT generous to NieR fans?
Why not buy digital on PS4?
<@263983345669505025> "Ys 8 on PC Seems like trash and it's sold out on PS4" so NieR all over again?
It's good that NieR got Best OST of 2017
I need to find the Bluray to this concert. This surprisingly made me cry so hard I think I'm on my 3rd box of tissues. 

https://youtu.be/sqP4G4ne7kc
Actually same price
What annoying is the Season Pass now cost more than the base game here in UK
Tbf The problem with NT is they didn't know what to include with the home port since I think this is Square's first Arcade to Home port. Unless there's a Gunslinger Stratos home release I don't know about.
012 > NT
Didn't really bother me tbh

Also dunno how I missed this but Valkyria 4 has revealed the unlockable skins in the 4th DLC pack. I'm happy about this.
At this point they may as well
Yes normal Goku is happening according to leaks. But people are suggesting this will have everything from when Goku fought Vegeta and Freiza like Spirit Bomb
So how many Gokus we gonna have in FighterZ now?

Normal Goku 
Blonde Goku
Blue Goku
Bad Goku
Papa Goku
Fused Goku
Shrek Goku
Not sure how I feel about this
When you crap your pants mid super.
<@346360946643566594> more like taking one.
This game has facial problems
...
<@98541382393688064> actually I don't mind Normal non SSJ Goku. The problem I feel sorta revolves around that he's DLC when he really should have been a base character.
>comes back and sees a guy fapping as god watches
I want to watch Darling in the Franxx but I saw the first episode while I was at home... Was relatively disinterested tbh. Please tell me it gets bettet for a while. Love the designs.
Idk what happened but a lot of people got mad
I hear Darling has been slipping too
Probably would have been happier if LWA was shorter too.
Some bits just seemed... Really dumb. Don't get me wrong I love stupid shit like Pop Team Epic but LWA tries where it really didn't need to. Like the race episode... That Cannon outta nowhere
Actually haven't seen Inferno Cop.
Although Amanda... Yup. Only good part.
I had problems with LWA. It has charm but doesn't last long. Found it quite forgettable which is a shame really.
<@98541382393688064> quite charming to watch really that one bit... Shame that anything after KLK didn't really have much of my interest
Ur not me mam
And I'm not in class anymore lmao
I have a server with my mates from class.
Started laughing like an idiot in class cause of this
https://twitter.com/hibiku_yamamura/status/988282954550947842?s=19
The final DLC which lets you unlock Selvaria Bles for the main game and bikinis for her and the other antagonist characters
Actually a month now.
It only came out 3 weeks ago
They've literally just finished with the DLC for Valkyria Chronicles 4 which was surprisingly quicker than I'd thought seeing as it's a $40 season pass...
Tbf SEGA does have the next two-three months busy too guessing they wanna give this game its own spotlight after Persona Dance
https://youtu.be/Y2WXyaN1yXA
Launches August in Japan
This is Border Break
Nope
Anyone for mech games? Wanna know if anyone is getting Border Break
They need a new writing staff tbh
Everyone I know just rips it apart now
She just rips on S3 and refusing to continue it.
So I'm getting revenge when BlazBlue CTB drops since she likes RWBY before S3
As much as I hate to admit it... Yes.
Also even though I love my fighting games... I suck at Smash. She beats me at smash 70% of the time.
Hai Arigatou~ ^^
Yee. She's me warmest sunshine~ But I said I'm gonna wait till college has ended till I ask anything after load of on and off stuff for the past month. Not really fights but more or less not really understanding what to do.
2nd if you're implying I have affection for them.
It was... It was just as satisfying as I expected :')
So... I got me best friend to finally play something with me on switch after 1 month of attempting.
Labo

I want to buy Persona Dancing Trilogy but I don't want to spend any money
And a friend is giving me the first game on PS3 for free also
I just got a copy of HyperNeptunia Dimension U for free
Welp.
I have P4DAN on Vita
<@200030864497704960> gotta hope that Tri Pack comes to the west then?
This was the bonus.
And knocked off the shipping costs.
<@174440042289168384> CDJapan as always. Cause they have a bonus for first orders.
Yup
Yeah ban me from thy wallet
Oops. Had the order num on.
The gameplay in DmC:DmC is the only redeeming quality of it. Capcom never learnt and made MVCI
<@138131889142628352> okay I see what you mean now. Goddamn. Such a shame really but I'm still liking it.
If its screen tearing I can see it. But I've played Asura's Wrath so it's fine.
Is it later on in the game?  <@138131889142628352>
So what's going on here?
I don't see a problem with the gameplay
Um...
So played 10-20mins of Drakengard 3
<@174440042289168384>
Was it this one someone was saying that it hard to get/come by on PS4?
Also this
... I'm just grateful it's a thing okay?
HYPE

I'm not 5 mins in and I regret everything http://www.twitch.tv/technowhistler
<@263983345669505025> you got a full version of dat?
Can someone help me here?

Then we try harder. Hibiki would never give up!
Do we start crying out to put Hibiki Tachibana in the game?
But...
So Audio Leaks happened for BBTAG that Asuka and Yumi from Senran Kagura may be in the roster at some point...
https://twitter.com/PsychicTerrain/status/997514008025550849?s=19
So played Project Zero 2...me rn after leaving the game for 1 minute...
Hibiki 4 FighterZ pls? https://twitter.com/hamuan12/status/998151366408159232
Which means that certain characters aren't going to be in futute games like the Cyborgs unless it's that Triborg thingy
I did play MK9 for a while then NRS and DC ruined any potential for MK's continuity. MKX was a mess.
Wasn't till I was 9 or 10 I got decent then 14 I started getting some where
Like 14 years of FGs now
I've been playing them since I was about 5(?)
Hm. You could be on to something
I'm the android 16 player btw
Let's just say I like doing crap like this https://twitter.com/TechnoWhistler/status/978433706305183749?s=09
Eh... I'm not good but I'm not awful
<@138131889142628352> 10/20 in tbr base roster
The game itself isn't the problem. Just the name throws me off a bit. Also Latooni I question your choices right now.
https://twitter.com/TechnoWhistler/status/998751535642365959?s=19
<@200030864497704960> already on it with asking Mori LMAO
Senran Kagura characters are supposedly going to be in too
Also don't forget those leaks
It's a hypothetical comparison.
It's sorta like calling MVC2 Street Fighter Alpha Royal Rumble I feel. Only some of it is SF but as a whole isn't.
Okay someone level with me here. ASW had no reason to focus the new game around BlazBlue or calling it "BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle" when
A) the gameplay is NOTHING like standard BlazBlue
B) the story/episode mode has nothing to do with the BlazBlue continuity
Well more like install at this point
Tempted to redownload T7
<@174440042289168384>
The art style is keeping me so hooked.
Supposedly Valkyria Chronicles 4 is a 30hr game but some how I've made it into a 60 hour one seeing as I keep replaying chapters to get S-Ranks.
I miss the "WTF IS" series.
He retired last month to spend his last moments with family. Didn't realize how short of time he was on.
https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/999787845127634944?s=19
:(
Anyone watch TotalBiscuit?
Was about to pass up on it until I found out due to me buying Symphogear AXZ box sets I had enough to get the JP version for a decent price.
SEGA's been keeping it a secret for a while now. They've been working on this one since that spin off happened. Was announced last November and I was so hyped when I saw it surface.
I have the JP Version but will still be buying the localised version soley for the voice acting alone. Not often I do that but I love this one so much I need to experience again it with the English voices.
<@138131889142628352> can confirm it's more like 1
Sorry. *ehem* Valkyria Chronicles 4 finally has a translated trailer.
THIS WENT COMPLETELY UNNOTICED
https://youtu.be/W5yq9y-Z-6c
You didn't buy them when they were on sale last weekend?  <@239564932125949952>
You can tell how much they care when thr text isn't even placed right on tbe screen.
I want to like it
I'm 50/50 on it.
So they're already done.
From a leaked video of the RWBY story mode
The DLC characters are actually done. They'll be in the episode mode.
So Cross Tag Battle just reached a new low
Mori just wants a Love Live game now.
I'm more trusting for French Bread to do a Symphogear game.
Think Mori said he's gonna stop with the Extend models. Not sure if he just meant CF.
Highly doubt it.
Not sure the Senran Kagura characters will be a part of the 20 unless that's their way of replacing Yang and Blake from the 20 characters pass
$20. Was confirmed at a ASW event a while back
But this is from the RWBY episode mode
Two on the right are DLC
Yup.
<@127644949884698624> I posted a few screenshots earlier. That's why I'm riled up.
Okay so overview on the whole debacle:

-50%(May be more if the Senran Kagura leak is true) of BBTAG's roster are DLC
-They are an additional $20 on top of a $50 game
-The characters are already done and will show up in story mode.
Preach
Because you have to pay extra to get access to them
You realize 50% of the cast is DLC right?
I wouldn't have a problem if they weren't
They're in the game behind a paywall
Also these DLC characters are done
$50
Why I'm upset over this is because Arc System can do much better for their fan/player base
Like SFXT
What I meant by poorly managed is the base game seems fine(for the most part ) . Just everything surrounding it like DLC is the issue.
The character portraits in story is the same used for the promos
How did it end up so poorly managed?
It was literally supposed to be MVC1 of Arc System's plethora of games.
I'm genuinely surprised how lazy ASW got with this game tbh
Ruby's high pitch voice liquified my eardrums....
<@138131889142628352> take out Ruby. We on same level.
<@246146781832806401> they are free
Marvel/Disney company are ones to blame for MVCI turning bad to be fair. Tyrant UK said himself when recording the footage Disney wouldn't allow their good guys to get beaten up in any promos.
Catherine Full Body for main stage Evo 2019 pls!
And Extremely low payout
It'll still be at Evo just on the side tournys like all the older games.

Well let's look at a game capcom and another company hope would be a great success at tournaments... But looked so ugly its not showing up at Evo
Hey if there's both Smash 4 and Melee at Evo then UMVC3 needs to come back.
SFV is centered around esports now.
About that...
Capcom, WB, Namco and ASW have been really pushing for esports
>cough the 1000s of versions of SFII to fix one bug cough

The beautiful creature of a fighting game...
I also have Mahvul 2 on PS3
I'm just not good at it lmao
I have Melty on PC.
Oh boy if I listed all I have we might be here all night... So I'll just say currently I play BBCF, FighterZ and SFV on PS4 and Fightcade on PC
I'm okay at them. I wouldn't mind going a few rounds on anything
When you realize a good chunk of Skullgirls' cast did Kill La Kill
Think the only game closest to delivering the same product as Skullgirls rn might be 'Under Night In-Birth.Exe Late[st]' 

That's a mouthful title
Skullgirls is like the weirdest perfect mishmash of fighters. I would rather watch a Skullgirls tournament than most of the games today
MikeZ's probably not the best rep for the game lmao
Skullgirls did that way back
I'm guilty of that tbf
Is cause everyone tries to buy everything
Although the few that still have logic in the FGC still vote with our wallets
^ preach
I live in the country it's based on. It's infamously popular for some reason.
EA just makes money off anyone buying Fifa
>same year Logan came out
"Nobody remembers the X-Men" - Peter Rosas
Funny how it all technically started with X-Men Children of the Atom and now there's no X-Men
Even Deadpool 2 makes a crack at it.
The X-Men were basically a metaphor for racism and discrimination.
Then Wolverine
What's funny is The Punisher was the first Marvel/Capcom collab and he's never been playable in any of the MVC games
It's not they couldn't get the licencing apparently. They didn't want to give FOX free advertising.
Ninja Gaiden?
You guys play this game https://twitter.com/Capndrake/status/1000421649840267267?s=09
I sold my Wii U to get another fightstick
He plays all the female characters but it throws him off

Grenadiers shoot bombs into the air. They can take out enemies if there happens to be a wall but you can just about aim over.
Well it's not so much as perm death, more if they go down but there's a random asshole nearby to kill lmao
In terms of gameplay additions- a new class, Grenadier, and a last stand mechanic is added where if your character dies during their turn, they have a chance to get up for one last attack or stay down but boost up someone else.  <@138131889142628352>
And a medic dog
There's a 5th but she's not important until a certain plot point happens halfway through
(left to right: Claude, Riley, Raz and Kai)

Find it a little interesting how the story manages to focus on the 4 poster characters as opposed to how 1 sometimes focuses on other characters to return to the main 2
The war is Atlantic Federation vs Eastern Imperials around Hafen. 

But among the main army(Ranger Corps/Squad E) is pretty much bringing few of the characters, who the story is focused around, back together after being separated for so long.
Literally
Otherwise running around in Bikinis and Swimming trunks would be a thing in the story and trust me the setting is cold...
Non canon DLC
The DLC chapter is really Squad 7 come passing by on another mission. They're actually off after the end.
It makes more sense than Edy being playable with one DLC mission then some how she's can be selected to be in the Squad from start to finish.
You can get the key members of Squad 7 to join E. Even Welkin in the Tank
Just happens to be a thing...
Not if 4 and 1 happen simultaneously
Also Isara a part of the Squad E meets 7 DLC. It's an interesting chapter. But to get Isara as a solider you need to S rank both presented missions to unlock a bonus one.
Street Fighter, Soul Eater, Persona 4
She's in everything
1, 3 and 4 happen simultaneously but all different wars.
So basically the Valkyria time line is 1, 3 and 4 then 2
Happens during 1 and 3
Even Valky 1 as Isara. Hope she comes back for the DLC in 4.
What about Laura Bailey. She's in everything lmao
Patrick Seitz is one of those voice actors once you hear his voice you kinda notice it.
If you've played BlazBlue, Patrick did Ragna the Bloodedge from Calamity Trigger up to ChronoPhantasma cause ASW didn't want to dub the last game... Just to end up dubbing the weird crossover no one was asking for starring RWBY.
Also in MVC3 and High Moon's Deadpool
He's been doing the cartoon and video game Wolverine since the show Wolverine and the X-Men.
Was gonna say Steve is current Wolverine
Patrick Seitz and/or Steve Blum? No?
She's not hugely known VA
English trailer happened. I'm guessing, and wild stab in the dark, Kayli Mills from Re:ZeRo will be the lead heroine of 4. She liked every post just involving Riley(in picture). I can confirm the story is good but its going for a darker setting. Something that sits in between 1 and 3 for atmosphere.
Heck I've preordered a switch version too but for the English voices. One of the VAs might've accidentally teased her involvement a little too much on a liking spree on twitter üòÇ
Hoping 4 does well on Switch though
I heard on DYKG's Region Locked that he wanted 3 to return to console but felt because of 2 it'd have been weird to run that version of the CANVAS engine on console... Didn't stop them from using the first version of it to make 4.
2 is understandable to be "bad". Even the director said it was a mistake to put it on PSP
3 wasn't awful from what I've heard.
<@138131889142628352> but we've left the age of handhelds, mobile base building and poorly visual spin offs. 4 was actually good.
Valkyria Chronicles 4 managed to pull in 62k sales but I'm sensing cause there's a Switch version this October it'll probably fair better then.
It did better than Valkyria Chronicles 4 by 2k on the same console... To say the least
But rather not blue two console for two separate regions.
Cause I'm multilingual it'd be a waste not to get some Japan only titles
Region lock is what decided
I could have got that or a Switch but obviously I chose the latter
Always thought that was silly tbh
I like this one better cause you can fold it again and doesn't intergrate the 3D
Of the New 2DSs?
Even Kirika and Maria have 2DS variants of them ü§£

RIP Shirabe fans.
... It's close enough
I know this is a pok√©ball but I'm dubbing this the Chris Yukine edition...
I call this one the Ignition Tsubasa Edition and orange/white one Hibiki Edition
>cough
Although I'm in need for a new DS
Hm... 360s are cheap here in UK. Who knows?
Gud jab Capcom
Not even published by the original makers either...
Then again Killer 7 is JUST now coming out to PC... 13 years after the PS2
Bit surprised for a simulation game they didn't port it to PC
Would if I could since I liked Assault Horizon
Orz no Xbox 360...
Assault Horizon I think
I played one of them
I think 1 out of the 6 DLCs is actually canon though.
But you have to finish the game for that to my knowledge.
She has a crossover DLC with Selvaria but it's sorta clear its non canon since it ain't possible for Selvaria to have met Crymaria.
She throws like a 1000 ice picks at you. Oh god if she's the final boss and thats her entry fight I'm actually scared.
She shoots from a 90 degree range but if you can divert her sight of attack she's fairly easy to get past... Shameful tactic but once you see her attacks you'll wanna try doing that.
There is. Actually I don't think the Valkyrur in this game can move.
Nope
I can't get past that mission cause of these two.
I'm on 10 right now
You will... It happens. They have like unlimited movement. If you thought Selvaria running around was annoying oh wait for Chapter 8 and 10...
And these two... Okay whatever you do just use the tank on them. They'll one hit kill any of your characters. They are so overpowered.
Just watch out for this guy riding a tank. No joke it's in the trailers too. He's an asshole.
No PC release though :(
16th October for Switch(worldwide) and PS4 and XBONE(in the west)
Yup. 

There's (sorta boss) enemy in the game which grenadiers becomes useful where the tank weak point is for some reason on top of the tank making it just a pain in the ass to aim. You'll see what I mean in Chapter 6.
Makes more sense than having her run around with a rifle. Also the downside to grenadiers I feel is just their limited range in movement. They can aim pretty much anywhere in front of them so that balances it out I guess?
Guess what Isara gets taught to use ;D
So Mom told me to try out P3D since it just came and she knows that I've been non stop revising. SO... I gave in and gave it a shot. Minato in 60FPS is perfect.
60fps waifus

GORILLAZ APPRECIATION MA DOOD!
Oh thank god xD
Hm... I should get involved with Voice Chat but 3 problems. 
1) I can randomly ramble on about nonsense without realizing
2) I'm really shy sometimes
3) I really hate hearing myself xD

and Maybe? I haven't been paying attention since Plastic Beach.
Wait. How long has that been there?
I'll now hide forever listening to nothing but Gorillaz again xD
<@302063351767498752> thank you for bringing this to my-- our attention.
GORILLAZ HAS A NEW SONG?!
...
Gorillaz has a new song?
I mean... I didn't pay for any of the DLC to begin with but this is a little dumb. Honestly.
That's dumb
I just found this out there's a ¬•10 fee to carry over DLC from the vita for P4DAN...

Huh
Or... Papyrus is Skullomania but retired from Street Fighter
Lmao

Skullomania was first

Basically in the initial reveal there was a character shown off but she's DLC suddenly...
I think Arika just flipped that and made the first character they revealed DLC...
Uhm.... I have a question. So if you reveal your fighting game characters first they're usually in the base game right?
Like as a whole
I still haven't started GUP
It's P3DMN related.
My laptop is not great
Which are only 4 mins each.
So I have to spend another hour rendering 2 videos.
So funny story I was working on a video but due to me not checking the audio levels the intro was too loud
Tbf the only reason I saw it cause I liked the original. It's not great but it's a good parody to Jaws.
<@263983345669505025> yes the "boob" movie
Is it bad I saw that and reminded me of Piranha?
Not too late to get a 2DS is it?
The main story had the SF Premise of having a tournament to lure out Azrael
At least CP made sense
That's actually a good idea
Doesn't make any sense until you just get to the last bit...
Instead of 3 different stories, Mori merged all three into 1 for the last game and it was messy as fuck.
If you just follow Ragna the story is just fine. But they make you play through the other routes...
You're actually not wrong
Calamity Trigger in one picture.
I just realized Central Fiction is basically Infinity War. Everyone just dies then randomly comes back...well actually 3-4 people die in CF if I remember.
I watch their ABItorials.
Yup. SugerPunch DW.

Ya got Hanafuda?
P5D's tracklist has really calm songs. I like upbeat songs to dance to usually but hey that's JUST me.
By miles.
I feel after comparing the P[3/5]D soundtracks 3 has a better collection.
What is it?
No idea why I merged both of them...
I meant Hitman Go
They ported Hitman Sniper GO to PS4 and Vita
It's Square Enix. Wouldn't be surprised.
Why? They're obviously gonna port the mobile game to console.
Like FFXV
Like November leading into December
Bet its November
If anyone has a problem with me liking Ring of Fates better than 7, they can come bite my ass.
More for FF spin offs than main series tbh
And for some reason 9 more kingdom hearts spin offs would have come out/in development for some reason with 4 not even being considered
In 2025 Noctis will be roaming all of Eos catching all the monsters like Pok√©mon and FFVIIR STILL wouldn't have come out
Oh wait
Gosh it's like Square Enix doesn't want to give Yoko Taro a reasonable budget to work with and rather implement golf into FFXV
*PowerPoint presentation of what you should be playing
Then Episode 1 happened.
I liked the first one. 2nd didn't play cause its the DMC2 of the series apparently. I started 3. Started fine with a few hiccups...
Yoko Taro can just come out with blunt answers and everyone's happy.
I feel this is something David Cage would explore in a 10 hour game with multiple needless endings
ü§î

Is Spyro out?
It's about time they added Hibiki Tachibana

You can get the DLC with a few mods.
Someone's been hacking the game
Didn't happen to get that Deluxe bundle did you?
<@161253890090729472> you playing on PC?

Huh...
Or a Geah game of its own.
Mori wants 2B and 9S in CTB apparently.
https://youtu.be/33Mv8Tt1YQY
Hm... Well it's got the same issue as the DBFZ game had around launch as in two separate matches would end up happening cause of a desync
I'll play it at some point but not day 1 in UK
I'm hearing it has issues online.
Makoto's Alt outfit better be present!

"base"
For a Fighter
In UK the base is Full priced
Such a shame that ASW handled it the way they did
The characters are present in the story
I put a few weeks back that DLC was locked into the program/disc
And they'll botch it again

Cause Team Ninja botched every other game they made they need to have one they KNOW will get them money
What's the point?

I think I ended up getting more confused....
I watched SugerPunch DW try to recall it.
I know there's a copy of the Dante meme one nearby a shop atm.
I have SMT 1 on my PSN account. That's it.
I have P3/5 dancing. Finished all the songs on P3D. Just a matter of finishing Commu mode
I finished 3FES, 4 Golden, Arena story(if we're counting those) and a fair leeway into 5 but haven't had time to sit down and focus on it due to priorities on NieR and Valkyria Chronicles
Admittedly I never played P2 cause when I was actually in my mid teen years my uncle accidentally sold my PS1 and the copy of P2 I had which I was given from my cousin.... 

P1 I have on PSP but I rarely go on it.
The games people actually play
Oh you mean the PS2 era onwards?
Reboot?
Eh.... Tis fine. More Minato for me then. <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
P3 is great. Minato is best Protag.
Moriyama in 3
Maybe. I mean she's in no way a terrible character(that goes to Teddie in 4 or Natsuki in 3) but presentation is a little key to making or breaking a character imo.
Mitsuru earnt that. They just gave it to Makoto straight up.
It's the whole Queen aspect I'm not fond of.
Thought Eternal Punishment came out on PSP in the west?
It comes with the full OST P1-3 and bits of 4 and 5
Of P5
I have the JP CE so I have the full OST
Revelations shouldn't be remembered since the PSP version exist
Good.
Which version of P1?
Wait so you're telling me you played P1 and 2?
Is this your first Persona game?
I really have mixed feelings about how Makoto was written in this game. She could have been better.
They're trying to recreate Mitsuru but giving all the aspects to the player of what Mitsuru is without Makoto actually doing it.
She's a very spoonfed character
**SHOTS FIRED**
Well that and how forceful the game is with Makoto
Thats.... A weird way to put P5
The demo is also on PS4
Then S Rank it again.
Then play it again on a higher difficulty
S Rank all the missions.
Anyone that has a switch. Go play this

Gimme ¬£15 and I'll run to shop tomorrow to buy it xD

Quite funny though
Can we appreciate how Arika made Terry Bogard look great?
Since ROMs are gone I guess no one can experience this true master piece.
The game literally calls you out for trying to lewd the MC in your head... Admittedly it's not even wrong
Also the fact how selfaware it is with the players.
I'd argue NieR explores themes games usually don't
I got the JP release for P5 for my 18th birthday in 2016
I've finished Drakengard 1-3, NieR and NieR Automata since then
Believe it or not I've had P5 since the JPN release
But that's NieR for me.
<@263983345669505025> I need help how do I not jump onto another game and while playing P5?!
Annnd I've jumped on to something else already
Okay here it is
Without turning it off in 5mins
Play P5
Okay I'm gonna do the impossible

Only problem is I like playing FGs on my 2m/s delay monitor so that means I wanna play FGs again.... Unhook everything again and back to where it was
I'm gonna miss doing that in IoD...
Maybe if I move my PS4 in front of my bed and play it there
I really need to get a move on
I think its perfectly clear for me to think every time I try to boot P5 "I wish I could play NieR" then suddenly turn off P5 and finish another ending to NieR
Games like Journey and Flower.
Probably makes sense why my uncle ended up getting one as he is one of the PhyreEngine Devs.
Dunno what **dev**station is. All I know my uncle got free stuff from work. That's it.
Like that
Since then I've learnt not to make arguments with game devs. Otherwise I don't get free shit from my uncle's workplace.
Hm. I probably don't see it as I'm a guy that solely plays FGs and RPGs but yeah again I be making that argument when I was 14 so views has probably changed since then. (19 almost 20 currently)
True but for Fifa? A game that incorporated online and the whole Fifa packs as a huge selling point?
Maybe. Then again this is me from 5 years ago. I was still just a na√Øve teenager
It's more efficient to both consumer and publisher than releasing a whole new game on a whole new disc for thousands of dollars for what is essentially just a patch.
Argument wasn't that bad actually. More on why EA bothers to release multiple games than release 1 and expand them every 5 years.
Apparently guy was a family friend who'd only met me when I was still a new born.
Nah the guy called me out first after saying that and I didn't even realize he worked for EA. We were alright though.
This was back in 2013 I think? Give or take I was about 14 so needless to say my dumbass years.

What's up? <@99695384296701952>
Then I shouted out "FIFA IS THE SAME GAME EVERY YEAR!"
He was on a video call with my Uncle and he was trying to convince him to buy Fifa.
The argument wasn't even about that initial funnily enough
He knew what I was on about. He told me "Go play something like Battlefield or whatever kids are playing". I simply said I would if EA didn't cancel TimeSplitters over who to put on the box.
He shut up after that
I called him out on TimeSplitters 4
I had an argument with the art director from EA sports before
Not Star Wars Battlefront 2 EA
And SWBF2(PS2)
Only game I'd willing buy from EA are Timesplitters and Dead Space
<@99695384296701952> thought that was an early PS4 Demo?
Actually Ellen Page sued Cage after BTS for that naked shower scene.
Beyond Two Souls is questionable and Heavy Rain.... Don't get me started.
Although tbf Detroit is probably the high point of QuanticDream's games
The world of NieR and Detroit are nothing alike
That's the Forbidden action
We don't compare the two.
The first two playthroughs admittedly are the exact same from different perspectives. The third playthrough feels like a new game. Given how Square Enix doesn't like funding Yoko Taro either that's fairly impressive
Also NieR does this thing where you feel like playing 2 games.
She's a character that learns to become human, discovering what makes a human and how the artificial lifeforms and androids are alike. 

She starts out quite stern but the longer she is around 9S, a scounting unit she develops more human emotions.

It's more of a random moment in the game than a spoiler

Wait... God Hand? As in Clover Studios?
BOTH?!
Can't let those imported games go to waste now can we?
I got a PS Slim at some point though so I still do have a PS3
Mine died cause YLOD
RIP PS3-Chan.
Well you're not wrong entirely. Although I've heard people went back to the PS3 Ver for the visuals.
ü§î
I applaud you for taking on the visual downgrade for a "remaster" in favor of better framerate though
Wait a minute that's not right
"Back in Muh day. DLC was locked on the disc"
"GIT OFF ME DAMN PATIO"
"10 years in development"
>releases a ¬£20 season pass and another one for 2019-2020
Like FFXV
I don't mind if DLC happens to just expand options the game like ingame skins but actual story is where the problems be starting.
UT is a game that refuses to die.
Capcom already pulled the plug on it like not even half a year into the game's lifespan.
>Cough MVCI
Hitman is questionable.
Well some do.
Episodic games get an exception. Since they make it at the same time.
The publishers excuse now is "We'll support the game afterwards so we'll finish the game by like 75-90%"
Overwatch
Injustice 2
I would say TF2 but honestly who buys those Keys? You can just glitch the game to get what you want.
Man. All these games that'll quickly be dated just for having lootboxes.
Fifa still had it.
Although not entirely now that I think about it.
EA were lucky to avoid getting sued over the Lootbox thing by European government by taking it out despite the fact they sparked the investigation to begin with.
Also who the hell at EA thought putting in a Gacha reward system in a fully priced game would be acceptable?
Galaxy in Turmoil better be in working progress
Those last two Battlefront games just felt generic.

Star Wars: Battlefront: EA
Sims DLC and Fifa?
I suppose EA has the power to decide if TS3 will happen as a remaster. It makes me slightly sad. 

Shenmue may be getting a new entry from an indie publisher but SEGA are still publishing the remaster.
Almost.... Perfect?
Won't be surprised if ArcSystem only did that to guarantee sales. ASW games are a bit known in Europe to rapidly lose their value. BBCF you can get for like 7.50 new.
20 DLC characters and "Another fate is coming"
Then again TS used to be EA ü§î
Taking advice from EA or Arc System?
Even the T-Rex, Gingerbread man and Mr. Sock.
Right down to all the characters
Anyways so I wonder if a TimeSplitters 3 gets a remaster or remake on current gen.... The online better be as goofy as it was on PS2
Suppose it's the case of separating Art from the Artist but I loath anything Anthony did after departing from Gearbox.
Yup.
I don't mind Ashly Burch though, his sister. Not the best VA but I like some of the characters she's done more notably Mayuri in the FUNi Dub for Steins;Gate and Chloe Price in Life is Strange.
HAWP used to be pretty funny then S5 happened.
He wrote Borderlands 2 and of the two Burch siblings who did 'Hey Ash, Watchu Playin?' 

Screwed his ex-wife over over something so petty then sided with FemFreq and mocked Atlus USA's P5 localisation writing saying it was too "memey" then made that crappy CR Crime Brigade show starring ProZD(I don't mind ProZD but I refuse to watch it cause Anthony Burch)
Whatever the case I'm excited the better Comedy FPS is coming back. I don't mind Borderlands but I hate Anthony Burch.
Or well tribute project really.
I'm guessing the fan project didn't follow through. TimeSplitters Rewind.
SPLITTERS?
TIME
My god.... TimeSplitters?

What kinky stuff I just walk into?
"yeah it was fun watching ggers get their undies in a twist" what?
I did. I liked Part 4. Not worthy of a purchase though
Quite literally
https://gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Asuras-Wrath-DLC_2-20_02.jpg
The other problem of it as well this game is like a QTE Synchronize anime
I love Asura's Wrath but I still haven't bought this DLC
Especially this game
I'm a bit 50/50 depends what the DLC is. Story DLC actually makes me debate hugely.
The worst DLC is the one where it's made before the game's release and put out as Day 1 DLC.
>cough ATLUS
But I can't trade any.
I played the game as F2P player. So I glitched all the weapons I wanted
Like DMC4 Special Edition did in 2015
I also had Radaint Dawn on Wii but more of my aunt's copy. I'd go around and play it while seeing her since she has the Wii system especially when she moved out.
It was just Fire Emblem.
I did play the one on GBA and played through all the advance wars games. I've seen this game about for like 4 years now and never thought about getting the system due to hardware constraints ie Region Locking. But Fire Emblem Awakening itself I've always wanted to get but never had the console to play it on.
Man. I JUST sold a figure for ¬£65 then I see this. Do I?
Since then it's been impossible for me to start this one.
Basically what happened was cause I stopped playing it in Japanese but I got the Eng Revision in hopes I could have someone I liked over to play with. That never happened so I'm trying to make sure money didn't go to waste.
I got passed the difficulty select
Omg guys
Just pray I don't quit before picking difficulty again....
It's 0:40AM
Gonna try plowing through P5 as much as I can.
Alright you know what?
Even to the point of the ball not rocking
Gen 5 had that glitch the more regular Pokeballs used the higher the rate of catch at 100% health was.
I spent so many hours on White and HeartGold alone. Spent every hour catching those legendaries in Pokeballs.
The games were 
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team
Pokemon HeartGold
Pokemon Platinum
And Pokemon White
4 Pokemon games for 40 Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards and a Pokemon Red and Yellow cartridge since I had like 4 of each.
Then I made one of the strangest trades.
I always wanted Spectrobes as a kid but my mom lived by a "Games are evil" logic so I only had 2 games for a long time for the DS.
Actually was Spectrobes series any good?
I still have my copy of Ring of Fates.
Oh boy.... My actual DS got smashed by my sister when I was 11
My biggest concern it'll be the Vita all over again where I got it just for Danganronpa 2. Then took 2 whole years until I got P4D
Anyways what you guys reckon? It too late or I can still get into it this late into the 3/2DS lifespan?
