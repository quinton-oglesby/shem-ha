<:HibikiSmile:808136132558323763>
Anyways good to be here
Looking forward to being here
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
Wont detail much but her first 2 initials + last name = S.O. Nata
Because puns
*nod*
thanks a lot ^.^, I don't talk about it a lot but always feels nice to hear stuff like that
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
no worries, writing is plenty fun and havent done much for sympho aside from whipping up a labrys wielding character with a dumb music pun name but might try some in the future
<:NyanPaw:737367148271501381>
<:HibikiSmile:808136132558323763>
but many thanks for the warm welcome
honestly cant say I expected any less despite having little to no exposure to the fandom prior XD
yeah saw that, and definitely will 
been spoiled about small parts of XV but been trying my best to dodge spoilers
hiho, only watched up through AXZ but been rewatching through with a friend who's going in blind
We finished up G last week
eyy

welcome to the house of geah, spinning up hot stacks of wax with wicked raps and wack attacks
Thicc swords end lives
for a second i thought I had misread "scythe weirder kirika" 
but nah thats the actual way its said
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222> thanks eheh
That arm was awful and took forever
But I finished damnit
DONE
https://twitter.com/copperminetypek/status/1446350157193297921?s=21
At least on digital art
My drawtober stuff will be a mix of physical and digital
I tried my best with it
I’m no good at depth but layering isn’t so bad
Thanks <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
https://twitter.com/copperminetypek/status/1445142113407143940?s=21
Try to at least
Yeah fair
I don’t really wanna learn 3D stuff myself
So I’ll have to conquer depth eventually
I mean
Not really because I am awful at adding depth
But it’s easier than drawing a full body
I can barely draw bodies but faces are something that are easy to practice
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
but its finished
great*
its not grear
https://twitter.com/CoppermineTypeK/status/1444161289392099330?s=20 HURRAY I ACTUALLY FINISHED A DRAWING
also yugioh fanart because gate blocker a good boy
https://twitter.com/CoppermineTypeK/status/1447773768265474048?s=20 today in drawtober

Copper tries to just do anything to get a drawing out, even if it doesn't help refine skills at all
Kirikeyboard
Phosphora
This just feels like one of those things that’s one sided one way or another but I don’t know which way
A cute one
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
<:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
Both
~~I know it’s not the right kind of beetle but shhhhh~~
Would that make her Miku Kohercules instead
Leiur makes a lot of my friends go nuts
The gun is to be handled by all
Oh dang
~~let me have a smash type game or beginner friendly DMC type game~~
https://twitter.com/siecchadraws/status/1359037436777484294
its a scientific fact denying or disliking the fact your cute only makes you cuter
she 100% does
the grump only amplifies the cute
since she got new cards recently there was a new surge of art for her

No control the Bikki
Unless it’s to get her out of trouble <:wesmart:562491300683972628>
~~I just imagined black clover collab and Hibiki and Asta sharing a brain cell~~
Is that Hibiki?
*SHES GOT A GUNNNNN*
She’d definitely be great to have as a family member
Found or otherwise
Miku is her anchor
Pretty much
I think she’d make a better aunt than a mom imo
Better to just
Not be on bikes within a mile radius of Tsubasa
Best not to risk her going full GTA
*ever*
Just never get on a bike with her
Probably Tsubasa
Gundamain
Maria is good
Why Karmify when you can get ripped
Mariataker
Oh
A good Chris
Never enough Hibimiku
Lots of good Hibimiku overnight
Doubikki good
Double Bikki is good
perfection
pfffff
even better than Tsubasa's hat in S1
Maria's glasses are the coolest
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
<:cheems:683182129668292685>
comfy
Kanade being the feral chicken gremlin she always is I see
maria cool
and I am not comfortable calling them braids either
strand usually refers to singular hairs
well what else am i supposed to call them
better count the hair tentacles to be sure
knowing Maria it probably is her hair
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1341344529727688704

comfy
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Mariacard
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
yeah its perfect
the bike is relieved
it has a chance to survive
> (friend) WHAT IS A MAN?
> (me) A MISERABLE PILE OF SONGS
convo that sprouted from me sharing the Maria Belmont pic
too hot to handle clearly
<:KanadeBlush:672455329451343882>
Maria Belmont good
the only reason Tsubasa doesn't have a brand deal is because bike companies dont want their product associated with that driving record
<:doubt:562491300587241472>
its like SCP-666-J but it only affects the vehicle
the moment she touches the bike its fate is sealed
any Bike Tsubasa touches is already doomed
*nod*
least I think its Kanade based on the hair color
Kanade with her hair that restrained feels almost cursed
yeah thats also fair
oh for sure
aside from the fact I don't think anybody could take Kirika seriously and Shirabe is too reserved
why else do you think they made her the face of FIS
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
<:weirdchamp:636293304765513728>
the other best Basa
ah yes
gay panik Basa
at the very least that scene has good meme potential
dont need the machine to see that
its true
Bikkiposting is always welcome
I mean with gungnir she did mostly fight using the cape
this is the last Maria pic i have stashed in my art stash

oh for sure
it might have been partially coffee
i mean
its pizza colored
its pizza cake
i mean dont tell me you dont see her as a big wheel kind of girl too
radiates kirika energy to me
but it also just
oh for sure
imagine Kirika in this
i know because I've seen them in person
theres also cars with 2 wheels in the front and one in the back
its called a motorized trike
idk why
Hibiki I see as more of an ATV person anyways
probably
i mean I certainly wouldnt trust Basa to teach them
yeah
No Bike-kun can survive Basa's curse
somehow
and those motorcycles will get crashed
Basa would still *try* to
if she had her way she'd buy everyone color coded motorcycles
i remember reading that that was a thing somewhere
didnt Basa also buy Shirabe a motorcycle in some XDU thing
yeah I wouldnt trust Kirika with much either
They are
Micha going to school <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Blessed
Basa smiles are always good
Hugs are the proper sheath for the sword
Sword and spear also good
Kirika 100%
<:PuddingSip:527758227371327498>
*gay gay gay gay ga gaaaaaaaaay*
Gay to the beat of FF7 victory theme
Liking Hibimiku is just human nature
That’s valid
No
But only because words don’t do it justice
Sheath the sword so she doesn’t get dull and worn out
Hug the Basa
Yes
https://twitter.com/kaiyamon_xv/status/1325282187244138496?s=21
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
The three of them gang up on her
She only has two arms
Yes
So both
Is Kirika late or did she do something dumb
And don’t forget how the opening scene of the show makes it seems like Hibiki dies anyways so in the long term her sacrifice did *nothing*
They knew exactly what they were doing
They were cruel making her as loveable as they did
Miku but trained by genjuro
Rule of cool > not rule of cool
Listen if Dante from Devil may cry can surf missiles it’s the correct choice
Yes but missile surfing is cooler
Until she’s missile surfing like a pro
Mikuval
I mean it’s better than just giving her a crowbar lead pipe or baseball bat
Her wife has gungnir so she has gun
Miku with a gun
Kanade x Kanade sounds like a disaster or a horny singularity waiting to happen
then again I'm pretty sure the canon ship is Kanade x Any girl with a pulse
theres also the one where Kanade pins Miku against a wall
probably because we've seen what happens to Hibiki without Miku
its true
OT3s are nice
<:PuddingSip:527758227371327498>
a pair of one winged angels
"If i cant see myself smile I'm gonna make myself smile"
I regret nothing about going for the pun
Zababies and their Airgetmom
<:chrisblush:808131453321084959>
yes
still find it funny how its almost unanimous among a lot of the fanbase to not notice she's a girl at first
Drident also good
https://twitter.com/comic_hand/status/1306215420207050752?s=21
was a little surprised we didnt get a zoodiac x litho combo like metalfoes got a whatshisface x agnimazud combo
mhm
tbf the battle horny giant gun wielding bun isnt for everyone
the best zoo
ye
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/742204367914139679/770774158769913896/d57.png and now back to what this channel is actually about
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
or to be short about it
dark stuff is a necessary evil, but still an evil
I myself just aren't a fan of dark stuff personally <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222> 
I like happy fluffy shit with the cool action
or at least the dark stuff being capped off by warmer stuff
oh for sure
it is important to balance the cute fluffy stuff somehow
franchise ain't perfect, none are
half glad I didn't keep up since a lot of the story stuff seems a bit mean/dark for my tastes
~~and the gameplay was bad~~ 
but at the same time geah good
still definitely something that could have been used more
but at the same time i kinda get why they didnt
*nod*
I know Edgebikki somehow absorbed a karma noise while going berserk
i uh
have not kept up with XDU for the most part since the day global shutdown got announced
or that they havent done more with the concept of relic cancer/fusion syndrome
also true
~~honestly I'm a little surprised there hasnt been an AU where Miku is the one to get the chest full of gungnir and Hibiki is the wife~~
i mean she could afford less screentime where she is the center of attention
she do
XDU remembers a lot of things
is true
Miku was the first one to tame Chris
looool
hugga da Bikki
fluffbikki
right down to the meme faces
and Spectre is a dead ringer for a Ver relative
yeeeep
i was gonna say tsubasa is too relaxed to be them
lol
https://twitter.com/inferiorskirt/status/1360349125884141568?s=21
concerned Bikki is 100% going in the treasured meme folder
also perfection
perfection
what an icon
https://twitter.com/rfufvas3phbxkxa/status/1360429641756934148?s=21
She’s rolling high
Garie you can’t use alca noise spawners as replacements for dice
She’s got those big ol mits
She looks like she’s having hand trouble
https://twitter.com/0gra09/status/1360587401215705092?s=21
Yeah once someone draws attention to it it immediately expires
Hug them both
Bikki’s  for hugging
Hug the bikki
<:KEKW:622347587516628993>
And Maria is just freaking out because she doesn’t know why Hibiki is freaking out
I don’t blame her
Given how that went
I’m assuming this was caused by Hibiki having flashbacks of Finés driving

Shocking
Absolutely shocking I say
Whos Jones in this situation
The fuckin Bikki in the background
She knows to let the two have their moment
They are hopeless and I love them
The pillows only come out when she worries about Hibiki
That’s fair
https://twitter.com/pt_ushi0123/status/1360774805641777153?s=21
Or just out shopping without her
Apparently Natjassha was big into Yoga when she was younger, according to that memoria
Happens though
They were even in global
They were like
Launch ones
Mhm
I mean with how enthusiastic she was in the Yoga memoria she probably at least likes Chris
Correct
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920> does this look like the face of the romantically aware half of a relationship
Of course she is
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Spaget is a solitary meal for me
You win this round
<:cheems:683182129668292685>
I mean would you just invite a normal friend for spaghet
The highest possible
Yeah you got free chocolates based on your score
And iirc she scores super highly
Possibly without actually knowing it’s for Tsubasa
Hibiki tells her to practice like she’s giving it to Tsubasa
That tests how romantically you can give a present
Just like with the robot
there is no stance nor strut with a more powerful aura than that of the Belmont lineage
Maria doig the belmont strut is such a powerful mental image
pff
yeah it went up on their facebook/youtube on friday
mini maria is just a cat
true
Miniria
except when she has her miku
then she's cute
edgebikki always cool
the best one winged angels
rip light stick-kun
my guess is last class of semester got out and the teacher wants them gone
everyone wants a piece of her
hockey kirika alt in XDU when
kinda dissapointed Kirika doesnt kinda skate around when using her gear
was worth
tiny snowball yes
she just smashed the problem until it went away
it just works
thats probably even worse lmao
it probably is
pretty sure yeah
Shirabe has motorized Heelys
brawlers and heels dont mix
Hibiki broke hers
she did have heels at one point
Ah yes
The gayblade
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
if you dont have a valentines, romance yourself
Maria who believes in fisting
Surprising absolutely nobody
No that’s Maria
Baby sword
Yeah Miku’s throwing arm is <:monkaGIGA:652734094664269835>
Miku has been training for this moment
Yes she is an Angel (dragon)
https://twitter.com/saphirune/status/1306274817520201728?s=21
Really fun design
And she mostly emotes through her pupils changing shapes as opposed to her expression changing
https://twitter.com/kencile2/status/1299151724775579648?s=21
Sandalphon dragalia good
https://twitter.com/runrunoh/status/1306241677158264833?s=21
the inner machinations of Miku's mind are a (Hibiki centric) enigma
maybe she's just trying to establish a Miku pecking order
also very weird for MikAU to react that way
very weird flex
<:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
~~I mean it doesn't help Serena arguably serves the same function as Kanade but used less good~~
Kanade is just so powerful
im sure she has standards
of some kind <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
yes feral rooster girl
I like the feral chicken girl

zwei wing incident caused her family to move iirc
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/463860490364387339/807394987016454205/Amou.png
Kanade art good
idk, art can do what art wants
i'm assuming
one is the edgebikki AU miku
I have no idea if she's actually saying that but im imagining it
Miku telling her other self about all the handholding she does with Hibiki
And floofy
Goddamn Kanade’s hair is massive
Comfy
Babikki
Baby
Gangnir
Kanade is 100% the type to try and hit someone one with the ball while she’s up to bat
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
She doesn’t even have to sabotage them
They both just play that rough
I was gonna say Maria was playing umpire
Then again that’s just a normal baseball game <:HYPEROMEGUFACE:459980344419024896>
Some say that baseball game is still going on to this very day
But yeah I could totally see Kanade being the type to go from completely normal to “why is the room spinning” in the span of one drink pushing her over the edge
<:OhImGheg:562491300683972618> <:OhImGheg:562491300683972618> <:OhImGheg:562491300683972618>
She’s basically fine right up until she can’t stand straight
Yeah
A tipsy point
I can’t decide if Kanade is a featherweight or can out drink someone twice her size
Yeah I could see them having drinking buddies energy
<a:APetForKanade:753351080133263540>
I just leave my hair how it is when I wake up
Although it’s usually pretty short
~~shush I know stardust was the actual ace but Junk Warrior is cooler~~
one of my fav protag aces mixed with one of my fav protags
Scrap fist turbo is hella fun
Junk Bikkior

Tsubasa Kazanyarhari
No, wait
Yarharbasa
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Tsubasa knows what she likes
Major Za Hando vibes
Three flavors of Bikki
the latter is quite literally a kitchen sink that shoots bubbles
maybe a blaster or bloblobber
idk for Garie
maybe splash-o-matic if you wanna go full fire rate but actually have range
aerospray probably
or inkbrush
carbon roller
🤔
Micha 100% uses dynamo roller
Autoinker
Autoinker
But she has such a sunshiney attitude
True
*the* sunshine
She looks good in the uniform

Blond hair, sizeable amount of pink
I feel like it’s harder to not be friends with Hibiki than it is to be friends with her
Or whatever happened to eva 03
That’s also probably pretty bad
That’s *super* rad
~~listen i grew up on a lakeshore~~
maybe shovel a bit if theres snow on the lake
or if you live on a lake you just go out
nah theres just a lot of fans and Alexis is a popular character

Somethingsomething The power of a miraclesomethingsomething XXX-drive
Yeah those suspenders being Miku’s idea makes a lot of sense
~~i know she wouldnt say that but it was funny in my head~~
"feels like yesterday I was trying to kidnap her, and now she's a married woman"
she looks so smug
Ah
It’s not the best pic but it gets the idea across
I just grabbed one off google Images
it was popular in the 80s i think

Even if my brain immediately wanted to call it a mullet
Slightly longer haired Bikki is precious
holding the hands of heaven and hell
<:HibikiDissapoint:809274117491523594>
Hibiki was born in 2027
Hibiki has been through situations where she should have been dead plenty of times
I’m confident Bikki at least has 1,
A bar is still a bar
Miku takes care of Bikki’s brain cells for her
They are a pair
Do not separate
Just don’t think about it too hard
Lol
fluffy bikki
Hand gun with hand gun
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Tsubasa needs to know why Miku can’t get enough
Bikkita
https://twitter.com/Iuciferic/status/1364709919082086400?s=09
I thought that too
<a:ChrisHappyCry:744335804482060349>
Also just attitude wise
I mean they’re holding they’re side
So probably not a corpse *yet*
Probably some unnamed SONG support staff
Miku is a badass when she wants to be
She baby
which is a big reason for the surge in fanart of Akiza
black rose got an upgrade recently
Akiza good ye

<:Copperminesquee:815032335472525332>
They are right tho
Definitely a great pic though
And not in a good way like usually
That Hibiki is cool even if the armor looks uh
A bit extra
Pffffft
A cool edgebikki
And now I own that digitally so can’t lose it <:wesmart:562491300683972628>
~~parents think other kids stole them from me because I’m a fairly trusting person~~
I also lost like 3 copies of Kirby squeak squad in a year
Now I own a copy of platinum and I’m never going back to OG Pearl
Er, copy
Aside from the toys-r-us arceus and a gallade I got from a friend I remember nothing else about that save file
But I distinctly remember it was female
~~I lost that copy of Pearl + at least 2 more copies~~
Yeah
My first was a female chimchar
Because my luck is fucking weird

Oh this is hitting right in the gut
Ye
I can read one of these words
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Also the main character is unnaturally adept with their power armor/clothes due to special circumstances
Also the main character has a gf that is an emotional anchor for them and helps them out of their worst state
Also there’s an emotionally repressed girl wielding a katana in a position close to previously mentioned villain
(Also I know the timelines obviously don’t line up for them to have actually ripped off Finé)
Listen I’m right
Maybe not the best phrasing
But I’m right
Also they get way too intimate with the supernatural force they are obsessed with
Just think about it
Overly sexualized mother figure obsessed with supernatural power clothes that gets betrayed by the person they are motherly towards
~~KLK came out after geah, clearly Ragyo is ripping off Finé~~
Cute
And Chris is in the middle of dying
also a flat joke probably

Awh this has such a glum vibe to it
Clawy edge(“)bikki
I feel like Hibiki would normally just be the type to randomly give gifts anyways
why is Chris a goomba
she'd be a better bullet bill/bullet bill blaster
Also long hair Bikki
~~hurray for black clover references not many people will get~~
In her presence, all intelligence means nothing
Aka how to create a negative amount of brain cells
Hibikirika
Elfnein ready to throw hands
I could *maybe* see noise halloween costumes, especially after song becomes a thing
cute!
those noise plushies are cute
<a:ChrisHappyCry:744335804482060349>
The magenta visor is more or less why I assumed it’s a costume as opposed to the actual relic eheh
And not just the Bikki behind it
Honestly it almost looks like Hibiki is cosplaying Shenshoujing as opposed to actually using it
That visor is very pink
Miku with Hydreigon has the same energy as that one guy in the BW anime who pulled one out of his ass to make ash lose the leauge
Umaria Musume
big penny
3 dollars is generous for that smile
this has major "this is getting out of hand, now theres two of them" vibes
Miku looks like she wants to remind Chris how effective her reflectors were against Shenshoujing
Hand holding
Hibiki looks like she’s having thoughts she doesn’t know how to process
Hug the zenbu
Edgebikki be like: “no, you can’t have this me, only I can”
i love Michas smile in this
Micha tried her best if the last pic is anything to go by
And would still be possible to tell the difference probably
Yeah although for them to look like that they’d probably need to be custom made
*the sound of Mikus across the multiverse swooning could be heard*
It has the energy of a tandem karaoke thing where one person is carrying hard
but its important to the deck as uh
Minimal as that deck is currently
doesnt really do much on its own
its just a beatstick
and the flavor text is a resturant review
yep
~~yes those are cranes assembling that sushi~~

floatzel is an odd choice for Hibiki but the color works
Can confirm hockey is violent skating
Yeah she would definitely use a needle that big
Nothing good can come of that much denim
Inside of you there are two Hibikis
One of them is hungry
The other one is hungry
You are hungry
And Hibiki
Doubikki good
she's got great baseball form

That Bikki pic is cute
~~but man i wish there was more art of her in anything but her XV outfit~~
yep
although it also makes sense that going apeshit would grow it back

Would have at least been neat if the arm looked inhuman for a bit or just looked wrong somehow
Chris hugs would be good
But I distinctly remember seeing it
I don’t have it stashed anywhere because art like that Kinda makes me uncomfy
And she was smiling (wearily) because well?
She’s helping people doing that, so she tolerates it
That’s just reminding me of that art where Hibiki had the Gungnir crystal things bursting out of her and she’s like
Strapped to a generator or something and being used to power the city or something
(assuming the relic cancer wasnt cured obvs)
and if we're being fair
regrowing that arm probably shaved months/years off Bikki's life
she needs hands for holding
do not make a bikki noodle
<a:HibikiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
but I do prefer my Bikki fully armed
her coping with it would have been a better arc than what she actually got in GX

Fun
Hoping at least
I’m guessing he’s happy to see his daughter happy
Good wings
She looks like she’s mortified at the memory of it
Yo that’s dope
pfff
Gungnir is a problem child
Which honestly probably hurts more
I mean at that point they *are* a part of her body
Honestly the crystals do look cool even if they probably hurt in ways Bikki doesn’t have words for
So there is
Honestly I didn’t even notice the little Gungnir crystals poking out of her
Pretty
i mean
Hibiki was late to class in the first episode because she was helping a cat out of a tree
Amazes me how people can do stuff like that, even with presumably years of practice
Damn
So much difference the presence of a girlfriend makes
https://twitter.com/Spareribs_777/status/1385171521644077058?s=20
She looks like she just rolled out of bed and threw some shoes on
im still in the boat of the triangle for og
if you gotta involve alternate dimensions at least keep them kinda separate or like
have a *good* summary of stuff somewhere
unconventional is understating it for one where half of the pair actively despised the other for half of the first season
All good
Not the Shem-frieza
Was talking about this
Tiny good snowball
at least from what I remember
like she doesn't even really interact with "extras" or tertiary cast members much
i know lol
because I didn't think before I typed
Chris is a very good wildcard given the SONG crew is more or less her entire family
i partly like it because it means no awkward 3rd/5th/7th wheel
not even the full album honestly
she heard one song she liked and wanted to try out the look
So one

not even the power of christ can repel Kanade from Tsubasa
good stuff
gets kinda boring only seeing outfits from XV
~~I can imagine Kanade also wouldn’t be happy that the girl she gave her life for is doing something so passive and probably self destructive with that life~~
Gotta save people from themselves
Yup
miku isn’t taking no for an answer anymore
I could imagine Hibiki being rather defensive about it given she is technically helping *a lot* of people by doing it
Probably yeah
Honestly I kinda doubt she’s allowed many visitors at all, if any
Publicly she’s probably been stated as MIA or dead
~~I hate that it’s so well done but it’s good~~
Partly because of the concept
*partly because I know canon Bikki would absolutely do it, and fighting noise (if she were even allowed to) would be her only time away from that contraption*
I remember that pic
It makes me sad
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I’m playing on the “mom said it’s my turn on the Xbox” meme
Yes
Yeah I was more joking on how Hibiki clearly wants a turn with her miku
Genjuro said it’s my turn with miku
the befriending will continue until morale improves
Gotta love that flawless wardrobe malfunction to show off the scar
Chris is too much of a marshmallow for mornings
I mean she’ll be fine
Probably
https://twitter.com/blaze_pso2/status/1383226019356692485?s=21
Now for something on the opposite end of the spectrum
~~I am guessing~~
She had also sung her activation song before punching the noise
So the relic was probably mid-activation
By the end point I’d wager she’s almost more relic than human
True
Honestly given how much the crystals have taken over her body in that SSJ pic ~~and the artist’s preclusion to suffering with that AU~~ it’s very likely she physically could not transform to fight back without killing herself instantly
I wonder why she’s even handcuffed in that first pic
It’s not like she’d do anything to stop it
~~plus knowing governments they probably aren’t the kindest to Bikki despite the fact she’d probably be nothing but cooperative~~

~~isn’t the answer that it’s both~~
Would certainly indicate why Bikki seems to be more prevalent instead of it being more half and half
Something something fusion dance
That’s a statement not a question :p
~~I know Maria isn’t in school anymore~~
“What grade did you get on your last test in school”

You know your probably right that it’s Sonnet
Well
Bigger, titty Chris
Big titty Chris
The rest of it (aside from moms weird chair thingy that moves around the ship I guess, not her wheel chair) isn’t too futuristic
The cloaking part of the ship was definitely relic stuff
Pretty much the hospital scenes are the most significant futurey thing as far as I can remember
Also true
I mean
Less a slave collar and more a bomb collar
Which I guess aren’t mutually exclusive

But it is a great pic
It’s good and cute tho
This is one of the weirdest arts of Symphogear I’ve seen
And not like
Bad weird

Like “makes me feel like I’m missing a joke/inside joke” weird
Smh not wearing hockey socks
Anime girls in hockey jerseys is a weird niche I did not anticipate existing
I was mostly confused as to why Tsubasa was wearing a penguins jersey when there’s literally an NHL team called the sabres

Yipe
Can’t tell if that’s bi or lesbian flag scarves on Bikki
But very cute
Nah it’s all good
I kinda know a bit of it
Iirc I heard essentially ||agreeing to do something for her effectively makes you her slave|| or something like that
I don’t entirely know makima’s deal but I know her deal makes some people horny
Lots of people are horny for her
Idk I don’t read chainsawman
I think it’s kind of orange-pink or somewhere in between
Pretty sure that’s Makima from chainsawman
They are both the worst and literally peak S1 comedy
It’s true
“Breasts? I have Chris for that” /s

This has the same energy as giratina about to kill Cyrus

It’s a story I should share here when I actually have a place to post it

Because even non transformed the powers grant passive buffs eheh
~~of course because things happen, only the twin actually gets her powers, so that throws off their teamwork~~
Punch girl made up a fighting style with her twin sis where she handles all the offense and her twin handles all the defense/counters
But yeah
I will be sharing the comm and raving about it when it’s done
Fighting with just a cape is cool
Gold* not good
She is uh
Coincidentally very similar to Bikki inspired
Good/yellow and white punch girl
Partly because she’s paired with a silver and blue punch girl that’s her twin
But I got a comm of the MC on the way so that’s pushing me
It’s part of what’s been holding up my own magical girl writings

Just like

Please blacklist those writers
That makes it even worse
(Assuming that’s accurate)
Or in this case with the wedding gears
Throwing it in for no reason
It can be
But making it the entire thing is lazy and bad
God knows if they were allowed they’d probably do something similar for the maid gears
It’s been a thing before madoka
But so many people were copying madoka and just making it dark for the sake of dark
Dark and depressing is a tool, not the entire damn process

Best teacher and student
Idk im not a doctor
Also that’s sedative your mean
Maybe
Anesthetic is usually numbing stuff I think
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
I still couldn’t bring myself to be comfortable around her >.>
I would not be comfortable with Akko anywhere near a scalpel
This is adorable yet also terrifying

This is probably a reference I’m missing
I prefer the no scarf myself but fair
But I think the overall design of S1 Gungnir is *chefs kiss*
Yeah the colors of S1 Gungnir need work
<:copperminekiss:694764559474360340>
Good stuff
Yeah tsubasa’s gears always seemed to just kinda phase into her thigh area
Whereas the others have a more sudden stop
Hibiki having her midriff exposed is fine I guess
But S1 just feels *good*
Yeah
The scarf isn’t a bad part of the design
I just think the S1 design is really good
Give me S1 design with G/GX colors
Honestly the scarf for me is a lot of visual clutter
*S1 Gungnir is honestly my favorite*
S1 Gungnir is so goddamn clean I love it
Do not shoot the Bikki
I assume one of the XDU events is why Hibiki is a werewolf
I was also making a joke that Chris’s portrait was cutting off the incorrect leg
I thought so
is
It’s not the *right* leg tho
Iirc
Maybe I’m wrong
Idk
Yep they are
But my best guess is that there’s no more appropriate channel for them

Convoluted is also another word for it
Interesting in more than one way
Apparently some of the master duel single player modes cover the DT story
Maybe one day we’ll get a duel terminal anime
And yes that is a clarinet(?) she has for a leg
This should be obvious but I guess not
But yeah uh
Do not give the robot body for your sisters soul the weapon she killed herself with
Which is no bueno

The fairy that possessed his sister ends up getting into the robot body he built to house her soul
And as it turns out
Winda is cute yes
Not even konami could censor it enough

Well
Almost

The dude is busy fighting the bad guys minions (his sister is currently possessed by the evil fairy but he doesn’t know it) and by the time he catches up with protagonist boy his sister is dying in protagonist boys arms, with a sword in her stomach
I am not joking
Remember kids, when your preparing a robot body for your younger sisters soul to inhabit after she died years ago

DO NOT FUCKING ARM IT WITH A SCYTHE MADE FROM THE BLADE SHE USED TO KILL HERSELF

There’s a blacksmith witch
Tiny pottery witch
Sewing witch
Although in some other cards (like the adult form) she tends to go by other names 
The young form is basically the head of a witchy arts and crafts guild
This lady is named Verre
And the adult form

I mean there is a witchy yugioh monster that has both childlike and adult forms

There’s some oversized gauntlets



You love oversized gauntlets you say?
Now I’m imagining animal gear Bikki but scorpion instead of tiger

||yes, but Edgebikki deserved her happiness, although I didn’t and haven’t kept up with XDU much||
But that’s the most speculation I’m gonna go into on this channel
The thing is
I think Miku wouldn’t turn out nearly as drastically bad without Hibiki as the reverse
Like she’d probably be less happy
But I don’t think she’d be an entirely different person unless like
Her Hibiki died in her arms or something
She’s here to kick ass and kiss Hibikis
And she’s all out of Hibikis
But yes thankies all the same the feeling of someone liking your OC is incredible

https://twitter.com/super_32x/status/1454084883534344193?s=21

It’s just mimicking gungnir or something Idk for sure

Well yes but actually no
Ye
But an 8 hour car ride has the strange ability to drain ones energy
If I had the energy to write
The girls dressing up as each other for Halloween sounds like a fun prompt
Yeah I basically only remember hearing a Kirikavania joke and that’s the extent of what I know
Wasn’t there an XDU event involving vampires?
Idk it happened before EN but that didn’t last to it’s first Halloween
“My fangs are infernal swords that stalk the night and prey on beautiful maidens”
https://twitter.com/YuGiOh_RUSHDUEL/status/1454389364016889862
Cute
Ahhh
But thank you for the more detailed explanation of what I did know
Idk anything about the event where Kirika basically becomes a Belmont
XDU taking liberties?
Well I’d never guess
And someone else is probably better suited to explain the dual relics anyways
Idk anything about the former
Replying to this
The latter basically means combining ones main relic with another
The only example I know being Hibiki with Gungnir and Mjolnir
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> <:copperminekiss:694764559474360340>
yeah they have a separate twitter for non gear stuff
Doubikki good
Heiki, Hecchara
noise rather than Noise
even basa kitty suffers
Sure she’s the reason SONG can’t get vehicle insurance
But she’s guilty of serial vehicular noiselsaughter
It’s true
Tsubasa has no talents or skills except singing and fighting
Inb4 fighting game with the OVA doodly style
Who am I kidding if there’s ever a movie/season 6 it’ll be back on the suffering train for her
One day

https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/7j9gec/can_we_talk_about_carly_nagisa_for_a_minute/ heres a great thread on it
yeah
Idk if that exactly was the case
There’s been tons of misinformation about the story
But 5Ds was kind of a mess behind the scenes and involving some of the VAs tldr

She has a cute deck though
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/555733101926678530/599619645712105483/image0.jpg
Yes Carly is a simp
Because she was horny for one of the main characters that never really returned her affections
She made a deal with a demonic entity sealed inside a nazca line and it brought her back to life
And I would argue that was justified
Aside from killing the dude who killed her
She bad at being bad
Because woman also good

This is actually so cute it hurts a bit
https://twitter.com/rt_imomochi/status/1456224020970409985?s=21
the arm crunch was the only hit it ever got on her
when you think about it Hibiki vs Nephilm was basically a one sided fight from start to finish
even before Hibiki went berserk
calling it a fight is generous but yes its an awesome scene
Symphogear berserk is still fucking incredible visually
https://twitter.com/olf_factory/status/1456532311026008072?s=21
in yugioh wyrms are just dragons but not actually
so they dont have to design around pre existing dragon support
like i said
Wyrms in yugioh are basically "dragons, but not actually dragons"

wyrm construction workers
Her and her Wyrm deck
She’s so cute
Why does she have to be a villain of the arc she’s introduced in

her gear is a giant camera with a noise destroying lens flash

Yep
Farren is just a precious baby

Iirc in the sub she shares a VA with Hannah but in the dub she shares a VA with Barbara
Or the other way around
Constanze’s voice is honestly pretty cute for the singular line she gets
I never even knew she had a name
Except the third girl in Hannah and Barbera’s mean girl group at the first episode
Most of the girls are best at something
Constanze is the best
https://twitter.com/20iog10/status/1480071555707453440?s=21
The best character trope
Pure of heart and dumb of head
~~there is a reason I mistakenly thought she was voiced by Aoi Yuki for a short while~~
But she is in fact, dumb
We love her for it
That’s because she’s dumb
She go bonk

Micha is just there to ensure that almost all of GXs fights are curbstomps in one direction or another 
And mostly be opposite to Hibiki even thought Shirabe and Kirika take her out
But she mostly antagonizes Hibiki
She’s just kind of there when Hibiki encounters Carol for the first time
Mostly
Maria
Probably because she first appeared at a concert

Anyways, back to art
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Also trying to balance 6 main characters mean some won’t get the screen time to suffer
Hibiki’s suffering is usually in flashbacks
Yeah
Okay everybody suffers, fair
Which is most of the time
She’s the suffering magnet when it isn’t Chris or Hibiki
Tbf Tsubasa suffering and moving on to a healthier stage of grief is part of her arc for S1
So her being a bit of a twat is expected (Hibiki still very much deserved that slap though)
Yes
At most
She lasted half an episode
She didn’t even last one episode
Kanade is incredibly likeable yeah
Although Bikki is still by far my favorite
She’s still one of my favorites
She has one but it’s rarely ever consistent for very long
Maria has the least consistent personality
I just don’t care for smug gremlin types
I hate Garie for all the right reasons

I showed this pic to some of my friends and one of them replied to it simply saying "gender" (they really, really like dolls/doll joints)
I think she'd definitely have a bit more trouble going through the learning curve than Miku
but she'd be great once she got the feel for it
but yeah IK, speaking as someone with two moms myself
but given her level of responsibility shown in the show for civilian life stuff
she seems a bit scatterbrained to do a lot
she would be a passionate mom, and a loving mom
but Miku would probably be better off doing the actual mom work

Miku pretty
Yeah I had a hard time telling which Basa that was
Hibiki “oh god I’m gay”
Tsubasa is probably the only violent drunk and/or is a lightweight
Chris just doesn't get drunk
I imagine her as the sappy loose lipped type of drunk honestly
Hibiki would eat too much to get drunk easily
yeah I think Maria is the only wielder (not counting AUs/people who wield completed relics) that can drink by US law

Which is unfortunately also the worst third
Alexis does appear in the latter third of Arc-v
There was 1 ritual summon in Zexal
Nvm
She is the first character since Alexis to ritual summon as far as I can remember
She also becomes part of the oblivious protags harem (I say harem loosely because by the end it feels like everyone wants a piece of him)
Her most significant contribution to the plot is foreshadowing that the final villain ||is the protagonist combined with his 3 alter egos from other dimensions||
She’s from very early Arc-V
Nope
Well she gets a duel and a half and loses both of them
But yeah this is Aoi’s one performance for yugioh and uh

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/d/db/FullAuraSentia.png/revision/latest?cb=20140831122937

Yugioh does have one single solitary role voiced by Aoi yuki as well

Sam is writing Yugigear

Yeah Sam commissioned it for his Duel gear fic
Which is why some people I know call it hot
So in some cases it’s not zombies it’s just brainwashed and transformed people
Undead zombie puppets that convert people into them by stealing their shadow

Or just “infecting” dead people awaiting reincarnation
Sometimes you just wanna make the world burn
*nod*
Yeah I don’t like them much either

I love being able to recognize stupidly obscure monsters at such a small glance
I always get that mixed up with the material yeah
(I might be mistaken)
Also if I’m not mistaken
That’s Gaia Drake the force of earth with her
Rather than one of her BLS monsters

Have you see how much rice costs these days? That’s a steal!
I was just gonna say “I knew Kanade was gay, but I didn’t know she was *this* fruity”

It also doesn’t work because “fruity” is more of a gay dude thing
I was about to make a fruity/gay joke about this but I wasn’t sure if that’d be poor taste somehow

Maybe not the most comfortable thing but like
It beats playing tag with Noise
I can imagine Hibiki fighting with her fists while wrapping up a civilian in the cape for protection
Or at least concept art for it
Because the cape stuff is my favorite part of black Gungnir
I would have also loved to see like
Official concept art of a black Gungnir Bikki 
Fighting with fists *and* a cape
*nod*
And that aspect of Gungnir basically vanishes after S1
Because the almost shirt collar thing looks adorable
But I also love scarfless
It’s good extra
I dunno why but S1 Gungnir just feels so nice without the scarves
They look great, and I’m not normally a minimalist 
But I like scarfless Gungnir with the collar
So much
I love S1 Bikki
Long hair Bikki good

There’s the black haired rage bikki
Yes even ragebikki

the unfortunate consequence of basically having 6 main characters
*meanwhile Chris is vomiting at the sight of Chrstina*
It’s impressive that they can fit 7 people in that car at all
Relic fusion (and by extension Relic “cancer) really isn’t gone over much despite kind of being pretty important to the first two seasons
*nod*
The lethal end point of relic fusion makes it feel like it would more end as her like

Actively fighting against it (stuff like trying to take herself out of a fight, or unleash the aggression on not people
It would be *cool* to do it through sheer force of will
But it would be less interesting/feel less significant 

Probably something along those lines yeah, trapped in her own body/mind as her body suffers and rampages
Ignite definitely wouldn’t be possible through sheer force of will yeah (as cool as that would be), a lot of the safeties/mechanisms that make it work are needed
True
Nobody really knows *what* would happen to her if it kept progressing, is definitely part of why the tension around it is so high
thats also a fair way to see it,
at least thats how I saw it ^^;
because that was kind of the direction the fusion was going, slowly taking over her body and merging with it, becoming something not quite human, but also not fully a relic
rather than her going nuts
I always figured they meant in a physiological/biological sense
so probably not this far
eh, she probably would have stayed psychologically fine as long as she had Miku
this is like
a Bikki that *never* had a Miku, rather than a Bikki that lost her Miku like Edgebikki
~~although if she never knew Miku she'd have never gone to the concert~~
that is a Bikki that has lost her mind and any reason to live
both the veins even across the armor, and the crystals on her chest
oh lord she's lost it
Edgbikki never hits the XV level/crystal because she does Elekleid stuff
I still get really uncomfortable looking at the Ignite crystals because they look perfect for impaling your shoulders on
to my knowledge
nah this is normal Bikki
edgebikki never got to the XV crystal thing on the chest
would probably have to call in the entire team to deal with her
and they
they gonna get it worse than Adam did
even if Miku isn't dead whoever did that to her definitely will be
that is going to end *badly*

She really got the shaft
Imagine having your whole fighting style revolve around a cape and just throwing that away
I’m gonna say lorge apple
Goddamn that’s a big apple
Ye
The K sound also seems very common in Japanese names
I say K sound and not letter K because y’know
K is a more common letter in names than people will admit
I just realized
Do Hibiki’s scarves while she’s still a relic fusion count as a part of her body?

That’s what she’s getting headpats for
+ 1 Noise
Oh wow this is basically every named character in the series aint it
Mostly her sword it seems

On the bright side she can use it like a garrote wire now
Quick somebody get Tsubasa some pills for her SD (sword dysfunction)
Oh no Tsubasa’s sword has gone flaccid

it's basically showing how terrifying Hibiki *could* be if she wanted to be
its so good
XV probably had enough suffering for at least one person to go berserk
I got into the show as XV was airing
Never enough dakka
I know several people who would find this hot

Good work

or Tsubasa actively saw that Kanade actively gave up her own life to save a single person
and is *very* displeased that the one person in her life she likes died for a total stranger

But the real question is the cause
But also <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Jesus Christ her torso is so long
Gay
I see, she stopped denying her weapon it’s purpose
And somehow not entirely recognizing her

A notably not season 1 feature
Tbf Hibiki is drawn with the scarves
the final fight vs the colossus of rhodes
season 6 villains: urban explorers
although its likely it got shipped to the dragon palace or somethin
in season 1 they did imply at least some of the gungnir fragments were successfully removed from Hibiki,
ye
after she grew her arm back
that was some of the debris from the cancer stage
nah
i do wonder what happened to all the fragments they *did* manage to surgically remove from Hibiki
ye
doing fight choreography for that cape must have been a pain in the ass
given its not like a static layer
honestly I wouldn't be surprised
it's fun getting to see the optimists finally have their turn to go apeshit
and also have their lovers/friends calm them down
Berserk was way too pretty to get used so little
YES GOOD YES GOOD YES GOOD
BERSERK GOOD
I agree

Nia is great
Anti spiral nia outfit also good
It was Miku who got her out
I mean half the time she’s wearing her school uniform and the other half she’s wearing something I’d generally quantify as “cute but dorky”
Damn Bikki got drip
The dead mom ponytail
And Hibiki
Being the dumb cute idiot brawler she is
Is the one who gets launched into the water
I’m just imagining this is the aftermath of a mission to protect the fountain of youth

This was Cagliostro’s idea
This is like
Such incredibly specific fanart

https://twitter.com/manamoonart/status/1555012710617817091?s=21&t=MvLUrOxO0Xf778aqUFKXug
It’s basically a comfier more friendly version of her S1 dress and it’s great
Although unlike the knight, Tsubasa is an only child 
Jesus Christ the knight has a lot of siblings
Both have fathers of questionable quality and were created for some purpose
It’s kind of appropriate for Tsubasa to pretend to be the knight
Honestly
Genjuro is tired of the dog bullying his student

Doubikki
Wouldn’t that make them sisters

Either that or get tortured into an almost Tsubasa trying to escape to Miku
But now your making me imagine Hibiki with Chris’s backstory

Or just an alternate series of events where Finé kidnaps Hibiki instead of Chris

Seems about right
Pffft
Listen Sam I’ve already joke spoilered song of the cards today
I’m not joke spoilering X2 as well
…

So just Edgebikki but with brainwashing instead of trauma
Given the broken relic I believe the intent is that she was KIA
Presumably it’s a “Hibiki didn’t come back from the mission” scenario
GOOD
No that’s a *very* Tsubasa expression

This is a very un-Tsubasa expression

This is definitely how I like to see Chris with Leo or whatever his name is (I usually just refer to him as shota hitler from the moon mentally)

Well I guess that’s one way to have the scar without actually having the scar lol

Is she wearing a necklace with nothing on it?
Or is her scar a weird pendant

school field trip and parents with coupons and days to burn
mhm
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
yeah that I get, know people who are like that and have parents they want to avoid becoming more than anything
and all my support as well
i do not often have the guts to say anything out of sorts to my moms
I am very much a people pleaser/peacekeeper when I can
my sympathies for you,
*hugs*
just helps me understand stuff like this more 
~~and their arguing is probably a big part of why I like helping people be happy more when I can~~
proud of you for having the guts to say something like that
yep
parents can suck big time
speaking from experience with ones that argue more than get along
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936>
That’s the goal
yeah no matter how much my friends who reassure me do so i still worry
also the fact the feelings > words conversion is very uh
*rough* for me
i kinda know *why* it turns into long rambles
because i get anxious about being misunderstood so I talk more in order to try and clarify more and then things just kinda lead into longer rambles
(i guess a good example is that sorta ramble in general I went on )
god i have this really bad habit of rambling when I get nervous/talk about akward subjects
here in the winter you do have to watch out for people on snowmobiles though
the car in front of the one I was in
I've only witnessed one accident but it was fuckin scary given it was like
yeaht that sounds about right
mhm
yeah also northern state so no real frame of reference
but i know it doesnt take much snow to completely shut things down in the south, or I've heard
also in rainy situations where hydroplaning can happen
but car accidents can happen very quickly and not give you much time to react
they do
highways it happens because theres no good chance to slow down if its a high speed area
yeah it causes a cascade effect basically
yeah it is insane
low visibility + slick roads
*nod*
jeez this conversation went places lol
closest I've been to going on to a military base was like
a week long summer space camp or whatever hosted near/on an air force base
those are probably a thing here as well but i dont recall seeing any
*nod*
mmm, also true
fair
if one at all
lots of public roads probably cant support more than one tank
probably
parades
but yeah generally driving a tank on public roads would be a no go outside of like
a guy on my street had an old military jeep in his driveway
and at that point its basically a heavily armored ATV with treads
~~jk he was actually a super nice kid~~
fuckin showoff
he had his dad bring one in for show and tell one time
idk if he had any tanks but he had several trucks
i knew a kid in elementary school whos dad was a big military vehicle collector
oof
you basically need to import tanks if you want to own one in the states anyways because the army probably wont sell you one
countries where tanks are stored/produced/sold/used probably
mmm
i would not be surprised if he was
*nod*
true
buying tank ammunition is significantly harder
because of course thats how it ended
I'm pretty sure it's legal to own and drive a tank if you have the proper license and permits
americans
pretty sure at least, never been on a military base
yeah we dont just leave tanks loaded up with ammunnition lying around
<:HibikiDissapoint:809274117491523594>
and none of it is going towards developing rocket jump technology
yes
i do super appreciate it
but thanks for being encouraging about that (and the interest in the stuff I talked about last night really boosted my mood then too)
*nod*
yeah, the spoiler worries are a bit more uh
both reasonable and at the same time "you knew what you were in for coming here" which is a part of why they are there and not just dismissed
can do some things about it but can only do so much and want to be blind for what I havent seen and kinda fresh for what I have when me and my friend do watch more
I am a worrywart, even if I'm usually kinda laid back (at least i'd say I am)
probably just me worrying too much about little things, but I do that sometimes <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
i know theyre kinda weird given i joined here but brains and feelings are weird and now I'm here
in a kinda weird funk tonight
part weird stress about dodging spoilers for stuff i havent seen so I can be kinda blind for when watchthrough with friend gets to those points, part weird worry of not wanting my entire personality to be around this show (this one I know isnt true i just hyperfocus sometimes)
probably other stuff too but those are the big thoughts that were bothering me just now I guess
Because sure socks/slippers are an option
But it gets excessively warm after not long
It’s super petty but super frustrating
Also re: the dorm always warm thing from earlier
It’s even worse because bad circulation in my feet leaves them almost always cold <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Tax crimes are always what gets them
Yay
Iirc
Yeah this was specifically about the riots on the 6th

Much more minor venting
*why is my dorm always hot, I’d open the fucking window, but we have a window unit AC in this dorm room and I am not using an air conditioner in February*

I mean now that he’s not president he’ll probably have the people he owes money coming after him
~~optimism save me~~
Still a chance to possibly bar him from future office maybe
Honestly I’m kind of really annoyed at how the article wrote the votes
Like I get you write the “winning” number first
But I’m personally used to the *bigger* number being first
We got 7
Admittedly it’s a bit annoying how they wrote the votes in that
It was 57 in favor of convicting but they needed 67 ive heard
Yeah debt was a big worry for me starting college
Hell the fact the college I chose to go to was relatively cheap was a big reason I chose it
<:NyanSip:737367185126588426>
I have seen startlingly bright nights due to winter
*nod*
Speaking from experience
*nod* yeah
So yes it does
It reflects off the snow
Yeah it’s good points
But it could have been presented better than “be less white”
That’s kinda what it’s reading like?
It’s horribly tone deaf regardless
So what they’re saying is
To be “less white”
Is to be a generally good person?
Wow
and nothing about the act itself
sex ed at my high school was legit just about the anatomy of the organs/diseases/safety methods and whatnot
They are distinct iirc
A gift you give with no explicit expectation of something in return,
<:KEKW:622347587516628993>
<:HibikiDissapoint:809274117491523594>
unfortunately thats probably the twisted logic behind it
machines are guranteed to incur future costs
workers are expendable
if they were trying their hardest they would have at least said like, "cotton harvester"
the worst part is despite that literally being the occupation the phrase "cotton picker" typically brings up thoughts of slavery immediately
Even if this will at least temporarily cause a surge in people buying them
Good on his estate, honestly
I’d imagine the answer is typically “ease of obtaining, ease of transport, and ease of use”
Probably not practical/efficient enough in destruction
Dav Pilkey is still an absolute legend
Also whatever this says I guess

<:KEKW:622347587516628993>
Although the article title is uh
A bit misleading on actually reading it
<:OgreThink:562491300537171978>
And even in that case literally nothing good comes from it
Best case scenario if the purchase happens: Microsoft changes nothing

i have no idea i was just quoting the article
> The gay and trans panic defenses are often used by defendants who are accused of violent crimes. They claim that the victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity made them panic.
Through any means necessary
Addressing companies pollution before people’s pollution is probably the right approach though
Restoring rainforests and the like is another step
Biofuel and whatnot is a good start
Good for them yeah, hopefully it does succeed
Yep
But the fossil fuel push has a lot more dough behind it currently
Doesn’t help that there’s a lot of anti-green energy pushback from the fossil fuel lobbyists
I will absolutely take whatever changes can happen
But the pace needs to quicken
The issue is that “slowly” isn’t going to be the best option 

These are good changes yes, I won’t deny that
But “slowly” isn’t going to cut it for much longer
I know it needs to be/*should* be gradual
But currently it feels like band-aid on bullet wound levels of effectiveness
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
And by the time climate change becomes that threat it’ll be too late
Anything to force the people who can actually make a significant difference to do something
Honestly as much as it will economically suck I want non-green/non-renewable power to become completely unviable as soon as possible
~~if you can’t tell, I’m very much sick of being stressed about a disaster I inherited and had nothing in part of creating~~
At this point the time for asking nicely though is behind us
I don’t like that stance, I really don’t, but at this point it feels like the only way
and the people with far more than enough means have no intention of ever even obtaining a shred of motivation
Which is why they need to be addressed first
Educating people about what they do is important yes
It does
But the common people’s word doesn’t have much standing against the lobbyists dollar
I’d still argue that prioritizing corporate pollution should be a bigger priority than that of individual people
Least not as much as they should
The stigma around it is the issue yeah
People don’t want to move past Chernobyl and the like
Honestly I’d even take pushing nuclear over fossil fuels at this point 
Destigmatize that shit
Well yes, that’s true
But reasonable people know modern nuclear power is safe
Plus for the people arguing against nuclear
Smaller reactor = smaller worst case scenario
That’s honestly kinda brilliant

pretty much

the 3 that resigned/retired had literally nothing to do with this from what I've heard btw
that would sound about right honestly
you also have no control over what the gacha gives you
So yeah just because an 18+ character you like turned into/was a child at some point, doesn’t make it skeevy
You can still find them cute and whatnot
But liking them in a romantic/attraction sense is the issue
^
people who tend to jump to accusations over platonic liking of cute things are usually just looking for people to attack, in my experience
~~pretty sure they are at least~~
Waffles are vegetarian
Cereal is vegetarian
Oh yeah in that sense probably
But

Yeah,
Dog fucking *sprints* out of my bedroom to go bark out the window
Of all days for the lawn guys to show up
Thanks, I am too
Some might say it’s preferable to him moving a ton
He’s not moving a ton but that’s fine
Preferably the latter but yes he’s choosing to walk around on his own
My guess he hurt his ankle/ankle equivalent jumping up on the couch yesterday
Dog update: he can (is choosing to) walk around now, his stride is looking less limpy
And he is eating/drinking
He jumped up into the bunk below me last night so he’s on the mend
Okay doggo update
He got up and moved to a different nearby couch
It’s not much
Butit’s something
And I’m still a nervous wreck about it so you know I’m not gonna let this go too long
It’s kind of happened before where he’s had periods like this but not very often
Like he has been with me for 8ish years now and I love him more than the world itself
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
Sorry for not answering
But he can move, but is mostly choosing not to
I’m absolutely going to be keeping an eye on him because he’s basically the only person in this household I wholeheartedly love
Vet will absolutely happen if there’s no improvement tomorrow or Wednesday at the latest
Not yet
We’re waiting to see if it gets better or not
Think my dog hurt his leg somehow
He’s been limping all afternoon and been super lethargic
This is gonna end in someone basically getting hung I just know it
So yeah instead of worrying about the long term I just try my best to survive and enjoy the present
I honestly wouldn’t mind something simple like that even if it doesn’t use my degree
But thinking about long term future stuff tends to stress me out a lot so I don’t always think about it even when I should
Kinda doubt they will be
But might be neat
Next summer I might see if I can’t work at the greenhouse near where I live
It’s super close and given it’s a greenhouse it’ll be fine if I’m kinda sweaty from biking to it
More focused on the short term than the long term
Rn my focus is at least on getting a degree (and my drivers license)
Yeah I don’t know much about passions 
Which is strange to say I guess
But that kinda stuff isn’t something I think a lot about
Yeah I don’t really know what I want
I just worry that I don’t quite have it in me to do more complexish stuff
Rn I just do bagging at a grocery store
I need to get my drivers license so I can actually have a decent range of options
I could at least move to other positions at the same store
And honestly I’m less interested in being Uber successful and more interested in a non-soul crushing job that I can also have decent free time with
(Also the school I’m going to is relatively cheap)
I’m basically only doing college because I know having *any* degree can help in getting a leg up over people without a degree when it comes to even unrelated jobs
I don’t know a fragment of either of those things
Yeah college being a waste of time and money for me is a really big fear I have
If that ain’t a mood I don’t know what is
Yeah
Definitely not holding Scott in high esteem anymore,

God I feel like I’m just making myself look like an ass by trying to be Kinda moderate about it
Like I don’t wanna hate the guy, because he has done good, and he does seem like a nice guy, even if he does support shitty people and shitty causes, 
But I also don’t wanna sweep those shitty things under the rug
Also true
Yup
That’s a fair stance to have
Even if it went to shitty sources I myself can’t let thousands to terrible people overturn millions to charity that actually does good
There really isn’t a good reason
But I also don’t think it should justify tossing all the good things Scott has done away

I do think he shouldn’t escape scrutiny and criticism for it
But I don’t think it should ruin him
I still think he’s overall a decent guy, he’s donated dozens times more to actually good stuff like charities
Like it’s not shocking that he leans that way
But I’m also not one to let this negate all the good he’s done either

Nor am I one to completely let this slip under the rug either,
I mean
He’s a Texan who made religious games for a living
*how is any of this surprising despite all the good stuff he has done*
I’d hope not too
This is gonna turn into the Apple version of the McDonald’s hot coffee lady isn’t it
Where Apple spends tons to make it seem like she baited the technicians or something
Cant even fake enough sympathy to *forgive* a years worth of student loans
Yeah basically rowling but probably not pure evil is basically the vibe I got from that response post
<:ggalReally:536013174210691072>
<a:ZweiWing:663572847993552936> I getcha, wish I could offer ya more than that
It might not be ideal
But it is *a* potential option
Best I can recommend is maybe try and write the things out before you go?
Try and prep for whatever questions they might have beforehand or something
The only good cop is a former cop
Because it’s quite literally all I can do, so I might as well do it
Even if having to hope for y’know
Environmental conservation and climate care becoming highly profitable, makes my insides churn a lil bit
It’s the only viable way I see it happening unless the corporations of the world decide they want to keep the world intact just for shits and giggles
I’m still hoping that there’s a chance
Because it’s better than being hopeless over something I myself can’t do anything to fix
It still stresses me out when I think about it, 
But I still want to hope for a better future,
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
At least I *hope* un-ruining the planet becomes profitable
Even if I hate that that feels like one of our only saving graces
Or at the very least until un-ruining the planet becomes too profitable to ignore
Correct
Why do we have to live in the timeline with actual Captain Planet villains being the most powerful people on earth
Literal 1st amendment
The immune system is weird
Now this isn’t why I got the two dose moderna shot
But it certainly makes me glad I got it
Yeah she’s uh
Very minimally dressed as I recall
<:HibikiDissapoint:809274117491523594>
For sure
As many people have said
It’s not about religion(well, it probably partially is), it’s about control
im just glad college is starting up again soon so i dont have to just live through their constant arguing and fighting
But I appreciate the input anyways
(I do try to be fair when venting about family)
I’m only working 15-20 hours a week atm
It’s just a summer job
thats fair, no worries about giving your own take on it
i just kept it brief and to the point
its been a lot of building frustration because I've also almost exclusively been the one walking the dog as well
yeah my parents also uh
they dont get along
at all
had a frustrating, but thankfully short convo with one of my moms a bit ago
tldr is 
mom: "you havent gone shopping online for clothes yet have you?"
me: "no, I've been too busy with work and doing stuff around the house for you people (the family)"
her: "you sound resentful saying that (i kind of am)"
me: "well between work and all the stuff going on this summer, its basically stolen my summer from me, so yeah I kinda am"
her: "I'm sorry you feel that way, welcome to the real world"
~~it doesn’t help my parents issues with each other has led to me very much being of the mind of “home is a place, not necessarily with family at it”~~
Thanks for being supportive at least, I’m still kinda new/lurky here
But I appreciate it
<:HibikiDissapoint:809274117491523594>
Yep, so while it’s nothing new, it’s still good for them to stick it to China however they can
It absolutely is
Unfortunately
Because it’s hard to believe it all if you heard it by word of mouth
I really hate that my/our generation have inherited all of these problems we didn’t cause but are still expected to fix
That seems too crazy to be real
I think aspergers as a term has been phased out and replaced with autism spectrum disorder (which is used as an umbrella term)
<:HibikiDissapoint:809274117491523594>
Hiding the evidence
In self defense
Ah yes
Self defense
But if I had to ignore that
I’d say probably just trying to maintain an orderly evacuation for civilians as well
In an ideal world they’d never need to be soldiers in the first place
I’m shocked, shocked!
Well not that shocked
*meanwhile the only kid my age in my neighborhood save my brothers who didn’t move away at any point shortly after we met them was literally as far away as possible from me while still being in the neighborhood*
I’m just glad the area I grew up/live at when not at school is basically geographically impossible to make into that
Even if that exact type of development is right across the highway from us
unsurprising, but i am surprised they cut to the chase so quickly
Making it illegal just means the people making money off it make more money
That too
It led to a lot of people trying to make their own in a lot of unsafe ways yes
Thus making the original problem worse while taking livelihoods away from people who did it legally before
Like
Nobody wants to keep trafficking around
But if you force the harmless stuff underground it’ll pretty quickly make trafficking more of an issue
Damn puritans /s
It won’t be long until they move from this to nudity Altogether
Pretty much
From what I’ve heard OF didn’t really get a say
It’s basically Visa and mastercard having a thing against NSFW
its also a supieror court so its nothing definitive yet
^
Being banned from/by Visa/MasterCard can screw you over yes
It wasn’t really their choice from the start
Visa and MasterCard have *a lot* of push
Which is probably a big part of it being targeted came from
I heard that the people behind the bot charge for its use
When they don’t have the license to the music
Like I think music licenses are dumb and whatnot
But if that’s the case,
Yeah that’s definitely a feeling I understand 
Realizing that one of my parents just turned 60 yesterday
Mmm, fair
It just seems like a lot of work
Good fucking luck enforcing it
pretty much
Maybe not ideal either
Having no ruler at all would be more preferable
I keep hoping mostly because I know there will be a breaking point where the 99% have had enough
Kindness should be the law yes
But unfortunately it isn’t
It got refloated shortly after
Oh, neat
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I think it’s because people charge for the music bots
Last I heard at least
Yes
At this rate it’ll be easier to say what is allowed than what isn’t
They are basically doing everything short of outright banning gaming entirely
Unfortunately your probably right
I mean that first item on the list is like
Reasonable
It depends on the individual
mongolia probably counts
It was me being frustrated moreso
But fair enough that it doesn’t exactly fit
Sometime have a bit of skewed view of seriousness
fucking
about to go to bed
random user in a server I moderate sends me art out of nowhere of a gacha character drinking from a bong
Er
Could
While I like the idea
Doing that would set a really dangerous precedent
This is a Tesla thing
Not an electric car thing
Even if running out of power mid-drive could be concerning
did my yearly sorta "status update" to my friend who died a few years back
even if its just in an old discord channel, I still like doing it, even if i didnt do it on the anniversary of her passing this time
it just makes me feel good, like she might be able to see it still somehow

i guess just part of me coping with that friends passing even to this day
even if I've had my time to healthily grieve
At one point attendance got so bad I heard a rumor the TA offered extra credit to anyone showing up in person
I did not attempt to verify this
(Not like “met for the first time” met)
Including a story about how he met his mother and some of her friends at a strip club
He spent the first few class days talking about himself
And on multiple occasions the same question appeared 3 times on one quiz
Even the final/midterm had answer key quizlets online
It was basically “get everything done by the end of the semester, idc” the class
I almost missed the mid term/final but he gave extensions on those
God that class was awful
Legit there was quizlets for that class that were even made for the specific school I’m going to
And I wrote 11 of the 12 papers for that class in 48 hours and I got perfect scores on all of them
And by co-wrote I mean he wrote the foreword
And he had worse attendance than some of his students
He legit said day 1 he never takes attendance
My intro to ethnic studies (it was for generals) teacher co-wrote the $120 textbook
Nosirree I definitely do not pay for textbooks if I have no other options I always buy them like a good law abiding citizen
Not after spending nearly $500 n textbooks my first year and barely using them
I definitely don’t pirate them every chance I get
*those* are the outright scam
Now college textbooks?
Yeah
And like
I still haven’t earned my license 3 years later
So picking college was the more reasonable option for me at the time
I also picked the closest, cheaper end school I could find
Like my parents either told me when I graduated high school “you either go to college, or you start working full time”
It’s unfortunately a scam that society pushes on people like it’s a necessity, and not having the fancy piece of paper can genuinely make it harder to find employment on any level
I mean infrastructure is important 
But there’s more important stuff
this is true
Oh yeah
City streets don’t need tolls
Toll roads encourage the use of public transit
95% feels a bit overestimation
God forbid you fund repairing them
And that’s only to build them
I think most reasonable Americans dislike it too
Sadly
Tax funding public universities would be ideal
But America doesn’t even want to pay taxes for infrastructure 
Let alone “college I’m not even attending”
That raising them for any reason can often be considered a heavy bullet to anyone involveds career (or at least it feels that way)
But taxes are so heavily demonized in America
Yes tax funding stuff is good
Yeah scaling the cost to income makes sense
Wow that’s cheaper than most singular *classes* I’ve taken at college
“Because I had to do this thing other people shouldn’t have it better than me”
Yeah
Student loans here are a thing even for public universities 
And it’s really fucked
Yes it’s loans to pay tuitions
And so many older generations think “because I paid mine (that was probably incredibly less expensive) these youngins shouldn’t have theirs forgiven”
Jealous
Yeah I didn’t have a plan and still don’t have a plan…
Or a drivers license
So college was kinda my best option
Yeah
I’m only even going to college because my parents said “college or full time work” after I graduated
America is very fucked
Yeah
Yep
And society pushes college (and by extension student loans) as an absolute necessity
Not necessarily bad
Just kinda weird
That’s a uh
Interesting solution
True
can't lose the china market
they'll remove it
a lot of games
wow thats uyh
(Disclaimer: am not a military expert, obviously)
China has *a lot* of land to defend as well, which probably wouldn’t do it any favors
Copy this one thing from China
Pls
yeah
*has spent a lot of time watching Maine game warden shows on animal planet because nothing better was on*
the state
<:NotteThink:526612512896974858>
I know in Maine you can earn a hunting license at age 10 or something like that
Obviously you can’t hunt by yourself at age 10 (I hope)
<:HibikiDissapoint:809274117491523594>
this is also true
Or for concrete filled cups to fling at politicians or some shit
I remember that being a thing that people were accused of a while back
Because providing content in the headline doesn’t get clicks
Mhm
speaking of someone who used to have those services but doesnt anymore because of dumb reasons that always make me feel shitty (I.E. I accidentally ghosted the person assigned to me because I procrastinated messaging them back and got scatterbrained)
yeah, there is
and those can be helpful
yeah theres a lot of people pushing for you to have it figured out, but really just trying your best to keep going is fine like the others have said
Probably
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Which the antivaxxers are already ignoring
He also had underlying conditions that made him immunocompromised
Yeah…
Yeah
and in the comments of that tweet people are shilling a supposedly carbon neutral form of blockchain but like
even if its carbon neutral its still taking tons of power
its a fancy reciept
And people are asking for Baldwin to be charged even though it’s not his responsibility to make sure to prop is safe
Even if it is his responsibility to use it responsibly
Yup
I think I would actually try and walk home no matter the distance if i saw a relative of mine doing that
~~ITS OCTOBER~~
which is also why theres stories of parents hiding assets to try and get the amount they owe reduced
yeah
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Tell the corpos that
So just try to be the best you that you can be
And I still struggle with beating myself up over stuff like the vocational rehab thing
But we’re all just trying to be our best selves
I still struggle to take pride in stuff
But trust me, do whatever you can to feel proud of every little accomplishment
First year of college had me so scatterbrained I accidentally ghosted my way into being removed from a vocational rehab service my high school care manager worked to get me added to

Still feel awful about that to this day
But my point is
Be proud of your successes despite the things that try to hold you back
Just try your best, parents and school can be a brutal mix
Hah yeah I know the feeling
I was always bad at using accommodations out of wanting to succeed on the same terms as “normal” students
I mean given how easy it is for rich people to avoid taxes here
Probably both
oh right you mentioned that
my b
and dont forget how some hearthstone cards do not practically function outside of the digital space
And discord is so big lots of people will grin and bear it because of how much effor it’d take to restart somewhere else
okay cool
But that isn’t helping
Supposedly it’s an opt in thing on a subreddit by subreddit basis
Did
Did I use that word right?
I feel like I did but ive never used it before
I crave the cessation of fossil fuels more than ever
From what I gather
Basically their creating an additional up/downvote system that uses blockchain
For fucks sake
https://twitter.com/NireBryce/status/1457502721809043458
theres so many people I'd never have met without discord
so many experiences I wouldn't have had
it's not easy for me to consider moving somewhere else
we're just trying our best while trying to remain sane and connected
unfortunately it seems that way
yes but this is even shorter sighted greed than usual
but yeah it's definitely getting tiring seeing the pace at which this crap is popping up
good
let it shrivel up and vanish off the face of the earth
Technically the company behind it but most likely cookie run themed yes
But deserved
Every fucking day
It’s from all sides
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
God I have never craved a bubble bursting more than I have now
I hate this trend
that and a shareholder thing
or some corporation complained to them
because youtube has their head up their ass
the people that compare crypto to cigs tend to ignore that crypto uses more power than argentina, lol
surprised it took this long
I mean someone literally made a cryptocurrency out of spamton/kromer from deltarune
So yeah
Or I forget it exists
Whichever comes first
Now I’m going to sleep and pray this affront to Bikki gets what’s coming to it
And probably going to be wiped off the face of the earth
Hopefully
But am not a copyright law expert so idk
I’m like
Very certain that’s nowhere near distinct enough to not be causing issues
Because NFTs are so fucking tiring
Regardless of what happens, hopefully the hammer drops
~~I’ll be honest I have no confidence in it actually working out anyways, god knows that tiny ass difference would be enough for Twitter to not care~~
Fair enough
So uh
Idunno about you but this feels like a lovely report target
I’m not sure if that’d actually be enough
But I’m no lawyer
I’m sure certain copyright holders would be very interested n that
Never mind then
Oh
Fwiw Hibiki *is* just a name
And it’s not like their Pulling a cryptoKromer and using a copyrighted property
<:monkaGIGA:652734094664269835>
Yes and both are waste for the sake of money 
Which is a big reason why I’m anti crypto
And any waste I produce is still dwarfed by that produced by corporations
Until humanity completely abandons nonrenewable energy both are the enemy of ecology yeah
microwaving is fast and easy though
typically for full sit down meals those are normal
but good for him
LGB alliance probably isn't the best group to be associating with iirc
Lmao
i was thinking of Rush Limbaugh developing lung cancer
i was thinking of rush limbaugh
that might be wrong
iirc he also developed cancer recently
idk how accurate that is
Alex jones is just a godawful person in general
Alex jones is an absolute sicko
yeah
<:KEKW:622347587516628993>
no worries I was being dumb
forgive me i didn't fully read it so i mistunderstood lol
I love it
yeah that makes more sense
I don’t blame you for leaving
yeah
gun culture is kind of fucked up and impossible to actually deal with for the safety of the average person as well
US law is a mess
<:HibikiDissapoint:809274117491523594> is basically my thoughts on this whole thing
It’s a mess of a trial
god knows they probably used it to justify it
because this trial was a mess and basically foreshadowed how it would end from the moment said the judge said the obvious victims couldnt be called victims
also true yeah
and thats why i said what I did
it really is
i saw someone on twitter (falsely im pretty sure) claiming one of the victims was a pedophile
just kind of a knee jerk reaction to this mess of a trial
yeah thats fair
especially since this case will probably embolden hateful dickweeds to try and copy him
"self defense" killing should be illegalized
maybe the universe will correct itself somehow
better to not engage at all
just remember to not feed into the lunatics who are happy about this
and I'm still dissapointed
i knew this would happen from the instant his victims werent allowed to be called victims
Oh absolutely
they got what they deserved
Probably
He’s earned his eternal rest
He definitely lived a long fulfilling life
I definitely wish I could just stop doing college rn
But I’m kinda at the point of no return (halfway through year 3)
And I definitely understand the pressure and Kinda crave that ability to just kind of
Exist without any real pressure
Just think of the poor fossil fuel industry execs!
~~and now it’s dinner time~~
Thanks for the encouragement at least
Like I genuinely can’t commit the brain space to thinking about the future right now when the present is piling up
And I hate that I feel like I’m making another excuse saying that
Yeah, I guess
Unfortunately right now I really don’t have time to worry about the further future when I’m heading into finals week and need to worry about the present
I unfortunately came into college with no plan beyond “not going straight from high school with no license to full time work with no license”
I still have big worries about college and student debt and whatnot
But I don’t really know what to do about it at the moment so I’m just kinda drifting along hoping for the best
God I wish we had good public transport
And with uh
Winter coming up it’s not exactly an ample time to be working on that
Could always hitch rides off siblings or get driven wherever I need to go
Never really needed one until now
Yeah
Yeah, that’s probably a good way of phrasing it
Just a gap year with no drivers license doesn’t sound like something I’d be comfortable with
~~I feel like I’m making excuses but that’s just kind of the facts~~
But I do appreciate the advice
While that is true
Idk how I’d even consider approaching it
Job hunting idfk anything about
And honestly being at college keeps me away from my parents and their uh
Volatile relationship, if I’m being kind about it
It means a lot to me, even if I might seem like I’m pushing against it
Yeah I appreciate y’all wanting to help though
…
You win this round
~~but also like I said, other things to do, getting ready to go back to my dorm for the rest of the week so parents don’t disrupt the grind~~
I’ll bookmark it for later
I’d rather not give myself a crisis first thing in the morning
Yeah, I also used to play yugioh on weekends but uh
Plague, y’know
I really don’t have time for that right now, I’ve got an assignment due tonight, a group project presentation I need to draw stuff for on Tuesday.
And 2 other projects/papers I need to start and finish within the next week or so
I kinda try drawing and writing
But it’s so hard for me to stick with things
So far my only “real” work experience is retail, and bottom level at that
But I’m definitely just stressing that it’s all going to be for waste, and I’ll be saddled with this student loan for god knows how long and just
I’m stressed and scared and probably not in the best mindstate because of end of semester burnout
I’m going down for a mass media major and just praying I can finish it quickly and cheaply
*nods* I know that much, I just have a bad habit of basing my value on my output of anything really
*it also doesn’t help this semester especially has been a nightmare with group projects*
Because yes I am worried about having wasted all this college time and all this money on a degree that might not even be useful
All I learned is that I have no idea of what I want to do or any plan towards what I might want to do
I was just reminded of my social failings too by going to college, where basically the only friends I’ve made so far are ones that were friends with my roommate, who is a friend from high school
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
I mostly started college because my parents gave me the ultimatum of immediately finding full time work, or college
<:NotteThink:526612512896974858>
~~I assume the answer is "yes, but not as bad as many sources claim"~~
It’s a weird situation
Yep
Marijuana is federally still not legal iirc
Those clicks gotta be clicked
True
<:NotteThink:526612512896974858> <:monkaGIGA:652734094664269835>
the economy will have to be on the brink of tanking for anything good for the working class to happen
selling the brand new switch probably pays for like
two weeks of groceries
and they are too cheap to pay real wages
people need money not video games
thats a pretty pathetic incentive
and thats probably one of the less murky ways to do it too
<:NotteThink:526612512896974858>
So while climate change is real
This article is kind of clickbaity
Although to be clear this is referring to Hawaii’s high altitude mountains
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
And doing that can be a very bad look
since euthanizing someone probably takes its own toll on the medical professionals who have to take part in the process
But having one to approve it is absolutely the right way to go
It could just be someone really hating Fox news
But yeah motive is unknown
Wow that is fucked
Best of luck with all this winglet, I hope things improves for you, I haven’t known you all that closely or all that long, but I still hope things turn for the best
Don’t forget how he turned a woman to salt for looking back at her home after he destroyed it
God is kind of a dick if you take things literally
SMH authors not fact checking their work
The Bible itself is honestly crazy
Letting go of hate and forgiving are two different things, it’s definitely good to just handle one at a time
It’s good to see your comfortable enough with the people here to be able to open up like that
Tbf the “human with wings” is also biblically accurate
Yeah I know the mood of Christmas dinner going sour
For better or for worse yes
I don’t think it’s even applicable in this scenario though
Iirc
Based on a somewhat famous poem
so forgive me for mistaking it for a toilet
on the bright side its a camera
How is this not a pragerU video
Officially she was banned for Covid misinformation
Also 362 days until Sherlock Holmes can respect women again
Fuck that

I want a raw chunk of science that spits in the face of Mother Nature, forced into existence by humanity and an act of god

Also y’know
Not obtained via slave labor
That’s so much worse
Bruh why does the first one have a bridge behind it
<:KEKW:622347587516628993>
The enemy of the enemy is a temporary ally
Oh it almost definitely was
They’d use any riots or protests over a literally 4 year old being killed as an excuse for needing police
Bastards
Fortunately the girl is probably going to live
Scumbags would
Yes
this is true
Poorly educated the non rich people so they don’t know enough to recognize how they are being treated and try to force them into just accepting things
It’s intentional
I just kind of stopped caring about something I knew nothing about, I was in my edgy teen phase so it was just part of me mellowing out
Yeah I had an anti SJW phase as well but then I mellowed out and learned stuff
Good
Best of luck
Also said class is fully asynchronous/online
Aka “here’s a semester long project with a presentation at the end that also has a third party mentor you have to work with, and it’s overall worth half your grade”
~~for me it’s just “oh god one of my classes has a project that’s literally everything I could hate about a project combined into one thing”~~
Ah yeah
That’s definitely more serious than for me
Best of luck with that place while you’re stuck there though
Yeah first week woes are a mood I understand
Just don’t be like any Randy
Yep
<:monkaGIGA:652734094664269835>
<:HibikiDissapoint:809274117491523594>
That does not reassure me
Why’d it have to be war
Why war
<:monkaGIGA:652734094664269835>
If I understand it correctly
Yes
Then don’t dismantle the bridge maybe
If he won’t pay for it
Nah he falls too far into fair use
I’d imagine it’s easier to do it all at once rather than in waves
It’s unfortunately a shitty scenario, and I hate it that it happens
But it happens, and there’s no real way to fix it short term
It’s definitely shitty that YouTubers are getting strikes like this
But it’s been a thing for years now and unless YouTube or copyright law changes, there’s not much recourse against those companies unless it’s a false claim
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> copyright law is fucked, not much we can do about it
god I wish third parties were even remotely viable
Oh my fucking god
Yeah
Which I know isn’t overly feasible
I meant moreso “bring it down from orbit and in a preservable state”
Ah
Just a shame there’s no way to recover and preserve it fully
Tbf that thing is getting pretty old ain’t it
at least the sane part of it has
Wow
A week (and a few years worth of change) late but okay
I think it will when people who actually care about more than money start working on it
Or at least one of my moms does
Middle aged women
Yeah VR is just too expensive with not enough offerings yet
That’s because it makes their currency look worse
Democrat politicians are (usually) at least useless/don’t do much instead of being actively malicious like thos
<:EllyFear:495477986586525706>
Like genuinely speaking MAD is basically why I’m never concerned about a nuclear war, because if one side uses nukes. They’re opening themselves up to having nukes used against them
MAD is one hell of a preventative force
Almost 0 probably
Yeah I was about to say
I don’t know a lot about war or politics
But that sounds like bullshit
A world war isn’t going to break out from this
People with power want more power, or territory, or more anything they don’t really need
*nod* that makes sense
I do know about a few of those incidents
Yeah
I still don’t expect there to be actual nukes launched, but like Melua  said last night, MAD only works if everyone involved is thinking rationally
Jeez I didn’t expect even *implying* the nuclear option
Trying to turn public opinion internationally against Ukraine
Disinformation tactics
Bullies standing up to bullies is just theater
Yeah I don’t think I’ll be visiting the elephants foot
Ah, neat
That does make some sense, although I can’t imagine they’d want to stay very long because radiation still bad
*nod*
Does
Does Chernobyl even have any strategic value?
Ah well
One tweet I saw described things as “Russia is fighting a 1970s/80s war against a small but early 2000s opponent”
While that’s a possibility I also think it’s possible that it’s legitimate
(I am not a military buff so idk the validity of it, which is why I said supposedly)
Supposedly a Ukranian pilot became like, the first fighter ace in 60 years
Might be hacked yeah, not out of the question
I’m pretty sure that is the actual Twitter for the Ukranian government yes
Even if it is legit, I wouldn’t touch crypto anything to be able to donate it
Yeah I still don’t think this will go how Russia wants it to, even if it hasn’t been a disaster either 
And I’m still taking this with a grain of salt
yup
Which makes more sense
Apparently it was honorary
https://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putins-black-belt-revoked-international-taekwondo-organization-1683304
That’s
Certainly an interesting way to jump on the bandwagon
Putin got his black belt in taekwondo revoked
And doin nothing about it
Yeah but unfortunately that’s not a new development
Which they probably will have to do in order to “warm up”

At least based on my experience with cars on winter
Although the vehicles engines certainly wouldn’t appreciate that cold
Wow that is some really unfortunate timing
Nobody likes working
But also having time for nothing but leisure also gets old faster than people would like to admit
To try and uh
Catch them off guard?
Like people weren’t expecting them to break it?
Uhhh
“We’re too strong to end things peacefully, surrender now so things don’t have to get *really* violent”
Yes
that makes sense
fucking twat right there
my apprehension might prove unfounded, and I would love that,
I would be ecstatic if it went through and was actually implemented without needing to go through a mountain of bureaucracy to get your loan cancelled
oh no
Mostly I just don't trust older generations (and by extension, older politicians) to let it happen for the "we paid ours, these entitled younguns should pay theirs too" reasons

among other reasons like student loans being a very good thing for the people who they make money for, as well as a very good way to edge people towards joining the military
I absolutely agree that student debt is something that needs to go, and I do want it to
I just hope its understandable why I am apprehensive over it actually going through
yeah, thats certainly got me more optimistic than I used to be
because for the people who benefit from student loans being a thing, that obsession is keeping their yachts in tip top condition
which is a big reason why it just won't happen,
I think it should be a top priority fix as well, but the hard part around that is the fact that people will shout louder "well it was there CHOICE to go to college, why should they be forgiven?" or "why should they be forgiven? I paid off my debt in full"
I *want* it so badly, but I just don't see it as realistic unless someone can explain it simply to people
but I just don't think it's viable because not everyone understands that
I absolutely support canceling student loans, I think it's in everybodies best interest
yeah
so they don't understand how significant and emburdening the loans can become
a lot of people against it are also people who had much smaller student loans than modern students do
which really ignores the massive societal pressure to go
especially one like student loan forgiveness that only benefits people who *chose* to go to college
as nice as this is, i don't expect much to come of it
I would love to stick one to the people who go "we paid ours so you should have to pay yours" but every time a push for canceling student loans comes around it either gets shut down or pushed to the wayside
<:hugeline:587370244247388172> it’s not much, but I hope you have the best of luck recovering what you might be able to
I would definitely be stunned too
Of all the ways to uh
Suggest one condemn Russia
This feels like an especially poor form one
Like yeah
It could look like trying to dispose of potential bioweapons
But it more feels like trying to prevent a huge biohazard leak
Yup
It says that they were supposedly destroying pathogens 

The article also states that the labs are US owned/operated/whatever, but are just located in Ukraine
Which makes me think that outright saying it’s bioweapons is connecting dots that might not actually be there
It says biological facility but the actual presence of bio weapons seems to not be actually confirmed?
Without a source that sounds very propagandaey
jesus
but not something they got away with
its what they would have wanted
this is genuinely something not even the robber barons were able to get away with
<:EllyFear:495477986586525706>
or 5 days straight of uninterrupted work
so 17 hours of work a day 7 days a week
ahh
that only leaves 4-6 hours recreation and commute, if you consider a 6-8 hour nights sleep
but even then, 12 is way too much
i assume thats supposed to be 12
Hate is also why we’re seeing it
Oh didn’t see the article attached
God I wish
He’ll probably be fine
there is the (currently unsupported as far as I know, this is pure speculative theory) theory that he's come down with some kind of illness and is under the impression he doesn't have that long to live

Yeah noise juice and Chris fine are the two biggest cases of fanservice I can really think of that isn’t shower/bath scenes
Also Bikki getting covered in Noise juice iirc
The Chris Finé scene
a lot of the heaviest fanservice is in S1 yeah
At least until the people really in power want it to change
Individuals can hardly make a noteworthy difference
And companies will actively do everything in their power to distract with small acts
I’m sure something will happen
But not until something irreversible has happened
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
I’m sure things will improve
Eventually

If we ever start making companies be accountable
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
And supposedly digging trenches is the fucking red forest

Even if I think I myself would probably be too afraid to get very close to them

You did yes
That’s fucking unnerving as hell to watch

That’s how they get people yeah
Social engineering is devious
There should be like, a recently downloaded folder right
From what I understand
He also *bragged* about not doing research
~~and don’t get me started on PragerU~~
It was genuinely a nearly 20 minute, normal ass YouTube video from some fishing channel
Sure in this case it was a harmless fishing channel
But like
They just put an entire YouTube video up as an ad
I’ve seen entire 20 minute YouTube videos show up in advertisements
How dare we value sympathy and kindness, and consideration for those
Ah yes
The “society” flavor of tyranny
It’s an inconvenience 
But definitely not tyranny
Being forced to wear one is not tyranny either
Covid “tyranny”

Otherwise known as “y’all fuckers aren’t being considerate to vulnerable people, so you forced us to do this”
God I hope this is just a scheme to try and make the stocks he just bought more valuable
Lots of free speech screachers think because it’s free it’s a public forum
That sounds awful
Imagine Twitter but with even fewer consequences for being a shithead
That seems like a funny way to tell musk to piss off, if I’m understanding correctly
On the table = the carrot on a stick is still barely edible
Unfortunately it’s not him personally going bankrupt
That sandy hook was a false flag event, and all the kids shot were hired actors, or something like that
Supposedly
Some people think it’s because donations from a different textbook publisher

Others because the textbooks have culturally diverse names in word problems
Neither would I
But I still want to see actual findings

And hopefully see NoA handling this more gracefully than Activision Blizzard did
Yeah, that’s fair

But I’d still like to wait for more than news of them investigating 

Y’know? I do want to see actual findings
Like I have no doubts nintendo isn’t the shining beacon of wholesomeness internally as it’s PR department wants the company to look

But at the same time, with how vague the allegations are stated to be, I’d feel dumb to not be skeptical
And I’m pretty skeptical because I recall nintendo usually doesn’t have a ton of dev horror stories coming out of it?
Because from what this article is saying is that they’re making very broad statements about the alleged violation
I’m gonna wait to believe that until actual concrete claims come out
Absolutely 
It was a dumbass idea to do this in general
But it shouldn’t have been arrest worthy
I feel like you should just
Not twerk in front of any statue
Or in public

It’s shitty that she’s been arrested for something like that

But like
please
But I don’t think a lot will change
What will change will most likely be for the worse
I honestly am doubting much will change
That’s because it is
I would be in favor of not ruling both out
er
i would not be against ruling out a little of both
a friend of mine thinks its because he's worried about the dropping tesla stocks
Wow he’s trying to speedrun devaluing the platform he just spent 40 billion on

fuuuuuuuuck
this isn't even about protecting "babies"
And with them comes their outdated, unnecessary beliefs about a lot of topics
Politicians becoming old becomes an issue because as they age they have nothing better to do but try to cling to their power for unnecessarily long as possible
That is literally the best reason to spare someone from execution
<:monkaGIGA:652734094664269835>
And sometimes they feel like prophecies
Just like most of our politicians
The smallpox wasn’t intentional but it did help his goals
Oh it absolutely will be

Gotta love/hate that they’ll only do the right thing for the wrong reasons
you're right and I do very much hate that
that applies to far more of our government than i feel people should be comfortable with

Yes
The whole situation seems kinda fucked
This is what I’ve seen about it
https://twitter.com/rubyrkgk/status/1525955635921174531?s=21&t=kldRaLYtWMb35uzGbSPD6A

That they are inconsiderate towards anyone not American/ “American enough”
I guess
They don’t have to spend the materials on airbags
This is genuinely unhinged
I kinda wish I wasn’t terminally online

But it’s also the main way I get to speak to people now because approaching people is difficult and scary for reasons
Parents are seeing how teenagers use the Internet and are basically deciding they can let YouTube parent for them
Pretty much the same for me
none
yeah that makes sense
so could be a hacked account turned into a bot

Critical race theory

<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
That will definitely help
so the better pay/fewer hours might cancel out a bit?
Yeah this absolutely reeks of them trying to create an out
Like it shows they could do it easily

But this is a specific case
This is strictly because of the school defrauding it’s students
To clarify
You’re working hard in a fairly secure position, sure it could be more fulfilling and less intense

But you could be doing worse, at least in my eyes
And honestly given how fucked the economy is rn, I would rather play things safer once I graduated
But yeah

I don’t wanna just coast along, but idk what I wanna do ultimately and at this current moment in time I just do not have the energy to spare for thinking about it
Spoons is a way to easily quantify mental energy basically
I don’t really know what I want to strive for in terms of work stuff, just personal improvement goals

But today was my Nana’s funeral to currently I just don’t have the mental energy for future planning
~~although given how this trip has gone I do not have enough spoons to consider a more difficult position rn~~
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Even I’m finally working up the nerve to hopefully try something more complex to look better for the future at my own job

I don’t want to potentially take on more hours for a summer job

But a year from now I’ll be out of college and need more than a summer job even if I am living with parents
Also god that off brand Hibiki
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
👍
~~although with how the store is run it’s also the least disposable~~
And yeah I try my best with my job, even if it’s the easiest, lowest paying job on the store
No worries about the time you’ve taken up, it was good discussion
Anyways I probably need to call it a night for serious topics 
Got a flight tomorrow and today was long
Tetris also helps with grocery bagging

Tetris + common sense
I am very hesitant to spend money but that’s because A: one of my moms tracks me and my brothers spending despite us being adults, and B: I am still getting used to spending money on myself without asking for my parents to feel like I can
That’s fair <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Ahhh
Yup

Because if they acknowledge the problem they have to do work to address it

And they can’t do that
It dies in the senate
They also have Chekov

Unfortunately humanity will probably be like cockroaches when it comes to full extinction
It’s serious for a reason
Out of context? Yeah kinda

It was relevant to the thing with Ted cruise iirc, but without context it looks shitposty
The Batman guy just got cycled out as Batman actors do
Yeah
That’s fair
Because they are hoping that people won’t be able to deal with them as effectively as if they happened me at a time
It’s just an unusually high amount of *bad* decisions
Nah I heard it’s normal to dump a lot of decisions at once
And many of them consider themselves “above” an armed uprising
Yup
Except thats literally against the one amendment that comes before your shitty arms law

Zelenskyy seems alright, even if it does potentially affect himself too
How does it keep getting worse
Whether or not regaining his citizenship would make him able to run is a different thing
But he is technically US born
He was born in New York
You’d be surprised
Yeah
He could technically run for president
So if he gets his citizenship back
I mean
He is a natural born American over the age of 35

I am also probably a bit too confident from never having any serious issues
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I consider them on the more reasonable end of reasons, but admittedly not great
I haven’t worn a helmet while biking in a long while but that’s partially because I haven’t gotten one to fit me in a long ass time but also because I tend to stick to bike trails/side walks
And I personally at least, prioritize giving pedestrians the right in basically all circumstances
This is probably the case here as well for me
As long as you aren’t causing trouble for pedestrians at least
Or I just hop off and walk past the pedestrian before going again
I use the sidewalks when biking for my own safety (bike lanes here are often too small for me to feel fully comfortable) but tend to either go onto the grass or the road to avoid pedestrians 

I’m the cyclist so I kinda see it as my responsibility to move out of the way
Oh yeah I always go for the seatbelt myself
I’m confident without a helmet but that’s because it’s on me and me alone most of the time
With cars I have to trust everybody else on the road
I tend to worry a bit more than I should about not speaking clearly
Yeah I figured you knew I just wanted to clarify
(I am talking about a push/pedal bike, for reference)
It’s mostly just a mix of confidence and being kinda lazy about getting a new helmet then
Pretty much yeah
Good
Let the rich eat themselves, they probably taste terrible
Good

Not really the bad kind of abnormal though, but it is a lot
In this case pleasure specifically refers to the satisfaction of desires
ethical hedonism is basically doing that in an ethical way

living for maximum enjoyment/satisfaction essentially
<:concerneline:494091504583966743>
Or anything that isn’t essentials for modern living
And by that same logic the video game industry doesn’t need to exist
Or the movie industry
It gives people jobs
A lot of it can be traced back to lobbyist money
Also car industry money
Lots of lobbying money
And personal freedom is a very important thing to a lot of Americans I guess
Because they weren’t controlled by the got dang guberment
I love the idea of nuclear power but we really don’t want it in cars
Yeah
Because america is unfortunate infrastructures around cars
I mean
Technically child labor went into designing it
But yeah that seems neat
At least in short term

Ah yes
Getting upset over *checks notes*

Yeah took me longer than I’d like to admit to see that
But pretty much everything else that nuclear could feasibly power should be powered by it
Admittedly I’m more hesitant for airplanes to go nuclear for a lot of reasons
A trans streamer who’s been harassed repeatedly and swatted

i'm still amazed that this ad even exists

i really wish musk decided to just make himself a do nothing figurehead
yep
Only Elon musk and his fanboys ever claimed he was actually smart
musk is a known twat yes
yeah
what a hack
Wow
https://twitter.com/sentedcruz/status/1586796299760074752?s=46&t=G4XgitlBMeKXTVEjCMXOgA
also I love how apparently an account saying "owning 3 companies can't be that much work, if Musk does it" or something along those lines got suspended (apparently)
Elon is not as smart as his concerningly obsessed fanboys pretend he is
yes
That’s the “fun” part!
Incarcerated people already have fewer rights than those on the outside
And many people (won’t name political affiliations) believe criminals of any kind don’t deserve to be rehabilitated and just punished
But it’s not what the prisons want

For profit prisons need to be illegalized for that to even be a possibility
That’s reasonable yes
But that’s the opposite of what the prison system wants
You’d think working actual meaningful jobs would help with rehabilitation and getting people out of the system
Yeah
And just being incarcerated effectively screws you out of any good jobs
But not enough to meaningfully help the prisoners
Which is enough to satisfy those in charge
Yeah they do get jobs in prison
For like 30-40 cents an hour
Yep
They aren’t just sitting around
Prison labor is a thing
Yeah that’s the thing
It’d be a better use for taxes than the military
That’s mainly because Americans are trained from a young age to be okay with criminals, no matter the crime (especially the victimless ones) having their rights stripped away
That sounds pretty bad
number 2 is correct and number 3 is also correct I'm pretty sure
it is very funny seeing  the people realize they aren't trapped with Musk in twitter
he's trapped with them
it is
Unfortunately Twitter is also an excellent place for artists to promote their services

you can tell that this is the kind of person who just assumes japanese VA's are superior because their japanese
yeah
i'll believe it when the money reaches the supposed recipients
Goddamn Elon “Clown Fiesta” Musk
The police: it’s a civil matter
if he wants twitter to live
but yeah I think Elon is going to have to prove how hands off he'll be after he finds someone to take the clown throne
scabs
and if he doesnt, I don't mind being wrong
he *will* backtrack on this
but I don't think he has the guts to actually do it

They assume driver ergonomics won’t matter because self driving technology
It’s the musk brainrot
Oh
Should have specified that
I was looking at quote tweets my B
Some of them are even suggesting self driving trucks are coming soon and comparing it to Walmart employees not liking self checkout
It did not take long to see the fanboys going “change is always good, musk isn’t bad”
Somebody please medicate this man

It *reads* like clickbait at least, lol
I feel like that’s a lot of clickbait
Probably more people would be willing to opt in if they were asked permission rather than ignored and told “this is just progress”
Personally my only real issue is that the image generators are usually opt out rather than opt in
“Why should I try when a machine can do better than me in 5 minutes”
I also think it can be rather discouraging for new artists
“Why pay someone to do this when I can just make a machine do it!”
It lessens the value of artists in a lot of peoples eyes
I fail to see the issue
But it’s better than him getting off the hook
That nothing probably won’t last long given his following
But might as well drain him of everything he’s got regardless
Probably not
It could potentially endanger his ownership of the company if it falls far enough iirc
Yep
well
more impotent than usual
over the cold dead bodies of every anti vaxxers and covid deniers
I would argue this is even worse
Having a channel to quarantine it to is better off
I don’t expect it to actually reach completion
Or some petty shit on musks end
They take a cut of it
Pitbulls are also just favored by people who are the exact reason they have a reputation as dangerous dogs
They are applying scooby-doo to a show nobody would watch without the IP
Self driving tech is just a bad idea because people will use it to try and deflect responsibility from their accidents
Fuckin hell
I doubt this will actually kill off solar
But it’ll be a setback
Great
Aka: we are gonna sell dead peoples usernames
Yeah on second watching I realize I was just kind of having a knee-jerk reaction to how a lot of people are just gonna act like jackasses about this situation regardless
Yeah but they mean in the “I have committed a crime and do not wish to be taken in for it” sorta way

Rather than “why are you arresting me I want help”
Or just racist idiots who think the police wouldn’t gun down a man because he’s black
Probably
God there’s already people saying he was resisting arrest/strung out on drugs etc
Also abusing a pig
Most likely yeah
I somehow kinda doubt they’ve even considered doing that
Honestly I wouldn’t want to be *anywhere* as a creator of that
Mhm
Aren’t*
Rabbits are people silly
And less addictive too
Yes
Another jumping the shark moment

Fair enough, you put it into better words than I did
Honestly I don’t really take the doomsday clock thing seriously

Sure it’s not baseless but I don’t really think there’s a point in trying to predict something that might never happen
Tbh I wouldn’t be surprised if there isn’t a huge change in content quality
Best of luck with working Sebas, I’m not far behind ya
I’ve been kinda similar lately
Although it’s mostly just a massive amount of stress over figuring out the internship i *need* to graduate

But between anxiety over approaching the people I need to, worrying about not getting done in exactly 4 years and disappointing my awful parents, and other stuff

These past few weeks have not been pleasant

So I think I can sympathize a bit
and if it is it's by popularity
I don't think it's ordered yeah
lmaoooo
Yeah at the low low cost of driving off every popular automated gimmick account on the site
Elon changes for the sake of changing
At the same time I feel like there’s far better ways to spy on the US than a balloon
he absolutely is but I think it's more he doesn't know what he's saying
Why is this man allowed to do education stuff
Clownery
I don’t think there’s any confirmation that it’s *currently* contaminated

But I suspect thats likely to change
Yeah it’s definitely something to worry about

But there’s no need to fear for your life
or your employer falsely labels you a contractor
Absolutely incredible

It’s on Netflix I know
There’s a few metal tips but they are very few and far between because of the shitty plastic stadiums
Yeah most pieces are plastic
But some tips use rubber, some use metal
Also hasnro rubber tips were shitty
It was yes
Idk
I think it’s just force of impact based
I stopped buying beyblade stuff long before burst came out
I do not know
Yes
The burst ones are designed to break apart
Hmm
It’s been a while since I’ve watched both
But burst definitely has less “brute forcing and shounen bullshitting through the problem” is the answer
Burst has some additional mechanics with the beyblades being able to be smashed apart to count for a point (as well as stay **slightly** more realistic to actual gameplay)
But metal tends to do more with the simpler mechanics of “knock them out of the stadium or make them stop spinning”
Uhhh
Oh
Definitely main line
Tops hitting each other is typically easier to do more with than “wheels you launch at people” or whatever the fuck the latter is
It’s very cheesy typical action anime stuff
You certainly can’t go wrong with any of the main line shows though
The spin-offs (beywheelz and beyraiderz) are uh
Significantly less good imo
Might have just been my friends opinion, I certainly enjoyed the reduction in scale a bit as well but I enjoyed the metal saga more
I’ve heard from more invested friends burst is the best beyblade anime
Partly because of how it reduces the scale of things from previous versions of the show
Burst is also completely disconnected from the other shows but is pretty good imo
I still would recommend it as it’s a fun watch
It’s more that beyblade as a whole is a show meant to push toy sales and whatnot
So it’s kinda about that quality of show
That I can’t say since I haven’t watched OG
Yeah ik dragonmaid has big feelsy moments too
As someone who absolutely adores that era of the show
<@!430379754190012426> thats more or less my advice
It’s honestly super fun and campy I just recommend you don’t set your expectations too high for an ultra high quality show
It has little to no connections to the original version of the show and you could easily skip to it if you wanted to
That specific meme is from the second incarnation of the show (dubbed the “metal saga”
Also it’s just a nice comfy show to watch in between seasons of other stuff
I’ve been showing my friend dragon maid recently
And teasing her about how she’s 100% a publicly decent lucoa has been very effective
Powerful
havent watched XV yet so unfortunately cant get the joke <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
dont forget the time a beyblade saved the world by piercing through a giant celestial body of evil
yup
Yeah most of the incarnations are their own timeline/canon
The lore on beyblades is inconsistent but stuff like them wielding dark powers fueled by negativity and other supernatural BS is 100% canon
At least to metal
They are aliens
They were ultra powerful weapons of war in the past
They are designed after ancient powerful things yee
Some do
Just wait until you hit metal fury where there’s an evil dark god and a black sun that was sealed away with beyblades
does whatever a spider Bikki can
<:monkaGIGA:652734094664269835>
^
Screen goes black if you screenshot it/stream it to something
From what I understand
Yeah that’s just how the site functions
Yeah that’s uh
That could be better
It’s a good series this trailer is just uh
Really weird
keijo still seems like a fever dream from what I've seen
||because again, titty fucking hypnosis, which is apparently also like, a thing thats happened before and is a banned technique or something?||
i've only seen a few clips of it
from what I've heard it wouldnt be nearly as good if it wasnt played so straight
*nod*
from what I understand its one of those shows with a ludicrous premise that takes itself just seriously enough to loop back around to being unable to be taken seriously at all
I am still not over the fact that is a sentence I can say about an actual anime that takes it as seriously as it does
and most of what I've seen is the ||titty hypnosis scene||
Ursula Dianna and Akko are the top 3 no debate
Ursula is best girl, gotta agree
Sports family + parents that are like
Bare minimum supportive about other stuff, pretty much just asking “how’d you do” after card game stuff,  (partly out of not really knowing how to approach I’m sure, but kinda drifting into more serious stuff and gotta go do some things so that’s my handful of cents on the topic)
Also I kinda come from a sports family so that’s another layer as to why I’m not super confident in explaining/being open about my interests
Honestly I would buy merch maybe but I like
Just don’t have any confidence to explain my interests to my parents
And other things but mostly that
My parents knowledge of my interests pretty much starts and ends with “yugioh” and “video games” more or less
My issue is that my parents either don’t really “get” it or are the type to basically assume the worst about anyone online thst one doesn’t know in person
I wish I could be more comfortable and open about my interests lol
The most mine have watched with me is like
Pokemon, maybe jojo because they were in the room and had nothing going on
But something like Symphogear I would never show them because I *do not* trust them that much
Although that’s kinda all I will say without drifting into serious stuff
Yeah that’s a big mood
My parents are kind of the same
They don’t really “get” my kinds of interests
They’re supportive of the more social ones like card gaming but I pretty much don’t watch anime around them unless it’s like Pokémon or something

I’m honestly surprised this didn’t happen sooner
<:OhImGheg:562491300683972618>
gonna be finishing dragon maid tonight with the friend who I "guided" through their first watchthrough of symphogear (just the first two seasons so far)
Yeah that makes a bit more sense
*nod*
Which is funny given technically everything except the first and last scenes of season 1 are flashbacks
That’s good to hear
https://youtu.be/bl9eZ41Sqzo this is just
Miles worse than the 4kids openings
4kids zexal was better than whatever funimation would have given us
fair
*gestures at the entire fucking virtual world arc*
yes but its especially sad with the original yugioh
God
There’s just this
Sad, sad feeling I just got when I saw someone say “the original yugioh is the best anime of all time, aside from censorship it did everything right” and seemingly mean it
Tohru crushes hard on Kobayashi but if it’s because she saved Tohru’s life or not Idk
Even if that deck is full of kinda annoying to say onomatopoeia names
He also gives his son his deck
He was a great dad when he was around
Ye
But he (and his wife somehow?) got sucked into another dimension after the dude funding his work (I think) betrayed him for something involving a different dimension from the one he got sucked into
He came home in between expeditions
Nah
Kazuma Tsukomo is unironically one of the best dads in anime, even if he is absent most of the time (not willingly)
He even explored at least 23 different ruins all across the world searching for 7 specific cards
But Kazuma (not that one) is absolutely a powerful as hell dude
Yeah zexal gets weird

Weird ghosty fellow who beat the literal incarnation of chaos in a duel thousands of years ago
Just the protags main sidekick
(Also the mind wipe was him like, fucking with “the algorithms programmed into astral” whatever that means)
Uhhh
The mind wipe thing is his main feat
But he’s also capable of erecting barriers between dimensions or something, and can basically turn into light to travel, somehow
He is at the very least canonically the most powerful *human* in yugioh
It doesn’t stay decent
But uhhh
Arc-v had a decent first 2/3rds
he somehow manage to mind wipe/scatter the memories of astral, who defeated the living embodiment of chaos  on his own waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay before the show
but yeah
Yuma's dad is insanely powerful
and also one of the best dads in anime
thats one way of saying it yes
y'know
but without the uh
https://twitter.com/nocontextvrains/status/1356683595423895555?s=21 the vrains dub is good
they realized nobody takes yugioh that seriously and I guess they were allowed to just have fun with the dub
reminder
*looks at the dabbing joke in vrains dub*
i mean theres nothing wrong with having fun
which is probably a fate worse than death
iirc whats left of 4kids more or less exists to dub yugioh at this point
*looks at Galaxy queen*
Yeeeeeep
Astral better
But yami is boring
<:cheems:683182129668292685>
That’s 4 years old
yup
Finral is still and always will be best boy
and also a very small role in BC
aside from matt shipman but only because he was like
the public face of the yugioh arc-v dub cast
i don't recognize a lot of the rest of the cast for the dub admittedly
yeah thats fair
he does a great job with Yami
vegeta
which was just <a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>
they got Chris Sabat voicing Yami
dub is pretty solid most of the time
thats fair
the screaming is basically trimmed of all excess by the time he gets his arms back
oh yeah IK
*if i want Asta to make my ears bleed i at least want to be able to understand through the blood*
i havent caught up because I'm watching the dub and I'm lazy
like I genuinely just love how Mereleona is basically terrifyingly battle hungry at all times with the power to back it up
~~Mereleona is best girl though~~
and most of Asta's fights are great
Yami vs Lict was an awesome fight
i mean theres at least good stuff *before* the end of underwater temple
but theres also stuff thats longer than it needs to be
even if thats basically uh
after the 50 episode mark
but after the underwater temple arc things stabilize pretty nicely
early BC is rough ye
*shudders at the memory of one specific BC episode covering like, seven panels of the manga*
black clover is good when its not moving at a snails pace
even if thats usually referred to as a problem child
but uhhh
I haven't seen enough one piece to judge that fairly
~~the beyblade metal saga was fun (not necessarily good) and that is a hill I will die on~~
pokemon Sun and Moon was really good for all the hate the style got
S2 wasnt as bad as people say
it just really slogged
I'd argue OPM season 1 as well
GL absolutely earns its praise
but it was pretty popular
pretty decently popular, yeah
it wasnt a worldwide phenomenon
little witch academia
*arguably* dragon maid
KLK
gurren lagann
probably season
as fast paced as BC can be I feel like a movie wouldn't suit it well
idk where exactly the dub is in terms of not-toonami release
yeah
uhhhh
idk
i havent been watching lately because at school
but i think prior to the captain fight
i'm watching the toonami release so i might be behinder
afaik
thats anime only
its in the filler arc before spade
Mereleona vs Rhaya is just such a hilarious fight
yeah it did
(And apologies for kinda slipping into that ramble again <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222> )
I almost want to rewatch LWA again but I already watched it over November/December
Those ending issues are why uh
I haven’t gotten around to XV admittedly
Also why I can never seem finish a KLK rewatch (aside from me *hating* Ragyos design with a passion) or get myself to rewatch Gurren lagann 
Even if I can rewatch LWA with no issue
I am bad with endings
Ah god I went on a whole rant about suffering from like
Ending paralysis over anime in another server 
Be it last season or last couple episodes, sometimes I just lock up and can’t go into that
My friend who I’ve watched stuff with over the last several months picked it out for us to watch after I got to pick the last handful of shows (IE, geah seasons 1 and 2, little witch academia, and dragon maid)
I’m like 3 episodes into Utena
My only issue so far is ||the first episode makes me feel like I missed an episode or something||
Stuff like that is kinda why I have no plans to actually watch madoka at any point in the near future <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Yeah that’s fair
S’all good,
Not even my joke 
It’s about as widely repeated as “what does pot of greed do”
At the time perhaps
But now it’s just ahead of the curve for overused jokes
Yeah it’s basically the pot of greed joke of madoka, I haven’t watched the show but I know that much
Nothing to lose ones head over
But I don’t see it working out
Like you could also argue that CR/Funi effectively squash awareness of other platforms
Yeah I don’t think they’ll block this unless something extraordinary happens
listen she gotta get represented when the main tweet dont
<a:HibikiCheer:620778132257112103>
some of the slice of lifey episodes (fish teacher, mr bones) arent my favorite either, both halves have their weak points
i enjoyed the payoff with the "please keep being my teacher" moment
but i can see why you wanted it to not be explained
i do like the first half more than the second myself
the slice of life stuff was fun
i enjoyed both dont get me wrong
croix is a great villain
i hate her for all the right reasons
Sucyland was a fun ass episode
Oh yeah that’s a very valid take
even if it does have its weaknesses
I still love the series but havent seen the OVAs yet
will definitely track them down sometime but I still loved the series
yeah thats what a friend of mine also says
didnt do the original thing justice?
i enjoyed it
just more LWA in general would be good
~~I'll just sit here hoping for LWA S2~~
and nothing more
its probably just gainax assets being split up and whatnot
fair

Lemme kekw for you
What are you doing here Kirika
Who’s ready for flaccid pancake in glorious animation
Oh yeah for sure
The visuals are half of why I even kept up with demon slayer
I definitely like black clovers magic system a lot
Not pages
*panels*
Black clover definitely has bad pacing in some episodes
One specific episode covered like
*7 panels of the manga*
That’s valid
Or manga
Oh yeah it’s far from a perfect show
The screeching gets less bad over time
The anime just has the pacing of a sedated snail sometimes
Black clover is super fun
And then the second season happened, or so I hear
Yeah I’d rather have bad animation (within reason) and an enjoyable story/characters than the reverse
Yup
But be glad we got it, rather than be sad we’ll never get it again
Even the story behind its production is hilarious
Listen there’s no other reason to remember it
It’s genuinely just funny to me
God I just remembered the ghost stories dub exists
Promised neverland ||any% wr||

But I’d imagine that you don’t get this far in the industry without enjoying it
I mean needing money to live is also a factor probably yes
Given how many roles she plays I can imagine she just loves her work in general

god that reminds me of a subnautica quote for some reason
always
punchy girls are good
Nah it’s mitosis
Besides Yusei was already married to his bike
I think it was mostly Carly that fell victim to shenanigans
I mean
She is kinda cute
Probably a few from later on
Admittedly I never finished the subbed version of LWA
I watched like 80% through subbed, gave up for a year or two, then watched the dub
Gud 
Akko good too
And she is bud
She is trying her best
Diana is pretty good
Ursula is my fav
LWA has lots of good cutes
Me and my friend (the one I showed Symphogear) gotta pick up utena too
She moved recently so was busy with that
Mood
I just kinda watch whatever I’m feeling like
Need to catch up on the black clover episodes I have tivo’ed
Most of the seasonal stuff I see other people talking about I’m either too lazy to check out or it doesn’t appeal to me immediately
I don’t actually watch that much stuff
Many anime I don’t actively seek out
Yeah it’s such a fun reference
Also fun fact
Diana’s cronies are named Hannah and Barbera
https://twitter.com/awestruckvox/status/1407372416788185089?s=21

Well that was unexpected
The vrains dub is wild
https://twitter.com/crystlabndce/status/1407354718200946696?s=21
I mean it’s not borderline porn
Does LWA count as yuri
But it’s definitely beyond plausible deniability
At most Bikki might be Bi because of the boyfriend comment in S1
Her super saiyan design is just awful

Yeah the shy thing is overblown
Which is a shame because I really like her base design
I’m pretty sure both major times she goes super saiyan she just gets super pale for no reason
Across multiple episodes
Yep
Also why does her skin get bleached when she goes super saiyan
Broly is cute yes
Just a shame it’ll be on Disney+ because fuck Disney
<a:discodog:823133361836392468>
https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1433414708288278529?s=20

It’s animated so close enough
Yeah
Like isolate her, and go ahead make her completely shrink into her shell
But the whole “soul sister” thing feels really one sided when Kale isn’t going apeshit with jealousy
I like the idea of a shy, timid saiyan
But they overemphasize it and make it almost her entire personality when she isn’t going apeshit
dubs case she has the same VA as one of Dianas cronies
I mean she grunted/made frustrated noises and other stuff
but in both JP and english she shares a VA with another character
TIL Constanze isn't actually mute in LWA and just chooses not to talk most of the time
she has a single line
Channel description says all types of animation so
The protagonist literally calls her out saying she’d lose to him
And you can visibly see her getting ruffled by it
Oh my god
Given sevens has the main characters literally in elementary school
I’d rather not
Oh my god
Watching yugioh sevens
The protag reprograms a local megacorp drone
And it starts simping for the female lead
I believe
That’s part of the joke
https://twitter.com/powerfulhag/status/1438473413396336642?s=21
Not my tweet but
Sevens is amazing
The change happened because they got a new studio working on the anime
Sevens is good tho
Probably disturbingly where it always is
Given this episode aired like a year ago
Wearing a wooden sign around her neck saying “I am an adult”
There’s a scene of her in a bar and she’s legit
*this girl is 37 years old and works a high ranking job at a mega corporation hell bent on uninstalling the protagonists new ruleset*

Watched more yugioh sevens last night
first major arc of yugioh sevens finished
true
It’s all part of one 3 episode mini arc
Either 8 or 9
Uhh
8 I think?

Today in my watch through of yugioh sevens
The female lead goes completely apeshit out of hunger and ends up turning the tables against one of the other male characters despite that characters ace being a card that shuts down her primary access to her own aces
in an actual magazine
i love that this was a thing

But not a full on butchering
There was some neater deli slices from it

Yeah they did

The dub OP is that good shit
It’s delightful
Yugioh sevens is incredible 
And I will die on that hill
Tonight in Yugioh sevens
The rival hallucinates a duel against himself

In the next episode he applies to a tournament he heard about via carrier pigeon
AND THE RIVALS SISTER HAS LUNGS THAT PUT HAMON USERS TO SHAME
WHO GAVE THE MASSAGE CHAIR A TEACHING LICENSE
tiger is the best yugioh character ever
https://twitter.com/jjbadub/status/1458225547000037380?s=21
this was a frame I absolutely had to screenshot
yugioh sevens is incredible
That’s 
Fucking incredible
Yup
And drawing until you have 5 cards in hand every turn makes asspulls easier to write
Since it *drastically* reduces the card complexity
The switch to rush duels is also a big help
Yup
Which is just incredible
I do know Yuga had his "protagonist goes apeshit" moment because of a ladybug
even if she is arguably psychotic
honestly Luke's sister is one of my favorite characters so far
Great Multistrike Dragon Dragias Burst
~~fun fact in the manga Luke has his own maximum monster~~
just like the Luke devil
and I somehow doubt they'll ever be explained
I still love how the fucking "Ko" girls show up with literally no explanation for a single episode, then vanish to never be seen again
the last episode I watched was the Ninja twins being idiots together
I'm still on the Goha 6th elementary arc myself
where Asana is the current "big bad"
that he was a little orphan gremlin living on his own?
the scene is genuinely really well put together to make this thing fucking scary
and they dont know *what* the dude is drawing for
the scene is fucking incredible because the protags friends start freaking out because the guys monsters are named after increasingly small measurements as he draws deeper into his deck for Yggdrago
"Heaven, earth, light, darkness. Creation, despair, eternity, demise, fate...
These are the new myths which will fly through and pierce the world.
Now is the time to bestow reason upon all creation with your three sets of insight.
Maximum summon!
Come forth! Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree!"
And uh
The result is one of the most incredible summons in the franchise
That character also “completes” the rule set by adding stuff to an empty space the protagonist intentionally left on the code for rush duels
Because when he was 5 he made satellites fall from space so he could have shooting stars
Fuckin
Sevens is wild
They have an 11 year old monitoring all duels from his own underground “garden of providence”
Oh for sure
But the entire city is named after the company
*kids can’t even trade cards during recess without being supervised by a megacorp drone*
Where the megacorp has just been accepted as part of life
Like
Sevens is by far the most dystopian yugioh series
The protagonist creates his own rule set and most of the plot is the local ruling megacorp trying to get rid of it
Which is a change the franchise *desperately* needed
It’s closer to a yugioh slice of life
Sevens is so fucking good
It’s honestly an incredible change of pace
Sevens
Only being beaten out by kemono friends season 2
Legit for one of the seasons arc-v was running, 9 of the 10 lowest rated anime episodes were from arc-v
~~the final third of the show being one of the biggest issues with Arc-V~~
Yeah pretty much
Yeah
She *willingly* tried to run over her son because he was being a wimp iirc
She wasn’t even brainwashed or under blackmail
I wasn’t joking about her literally trying to run over her son btw
Road Raven Red Queen is her boss monster
She plays a biker lady deck
This is Yuya’s mom in her biker gang leader outfit
Yuya’s dad was uh
Wow that sure was a thing
Yuma’s dad is possibly the most powerful human in the franchise
Yusei and Yuma both had dads
The post is exaggeration but it’s still funny
And Yuya’s mom nearly (intentionally, she absolutely was trying to) ran him over with a motorcycle
https://twitter.com/serenaarc_v/status/1464836373488279554?s=21
But sevens is also great because they don’t have to print shitty anime cards in master duel
I mean some people don’t like the more laid back nature
And even more people don’t care for rush duels
Supposedly a dub has entered production/pre-production
Entame is the most accessible way to watch everything after though
For the first 12-13 episodes I had to use one of those porn ad filled anime sites
But everything after they have
They unfortunately don’t have most of the first 12-13 episodes
Entame subs is the source I’m watching
I think the noodle ninja deck so far is my favorite
Ironically the best deck right now doesn’t use maximum *or* that extra deck mechanic
And maximums aren’t that complex
Who played a chair themed deck
Sentient massage chair robot with a superiority complex about chairs
One of the main characters for a while was a fucking
Because it’s an entirely separate dueling format with entirely different rules
And an entirely different card pool
Once against his rival, and once against both of the other maximum monster users
Yuga has lost at least 3 times and I’m about 36 episodes in
Yes
Yep
Rush duel cards are drastically less complex than master duel cards
Sevens also has uh
I’m kind of hesitant to mention Mimi
Rush duels irl are also a ton of fun
Yup
Her first major loss was to another female character
Romin hasn’t been that dirty as far as I know
I still love how their called duel disks even after the design is evolved from being a literal disk
Basically this but with card games
Yup
The only real issue with DSOD was the pharaoh taking over at the climax despite the whole movie basically being about moving on from the pharaoh/the events of the show/manga
Actually it was a gate to the afterlife yeah
Eric Stuart was having the time of his fucking life dubbing it I can tell
https://twitter.com/feelvibezone/status/1465881067483648000?s=21

DSOD is Kaiba’s movie I am not accepting feedback
<:selfdestruct:914680932538122352>

Fuck I love this dumb shit
HE DID IT
THE MADLAD DREW HIS MAXIMUM

NO MATTER IF DOUBT, DISTRESS, OR DESPAIR BLOCK MY WAY
DREAMS
COURAGE
AND FRIENDSHIP
WILL CARVE A ROAD AND REVIVE
I love him so much
It issss
She’s super disappointed that the protag isn’t also using a maximum so they can be dueling on even ground
Maximum monsters are fucking awesome
The girl also duels atop an excavator
Yes, yes it is metal as fuck
AND HE DID GIVE IT
BUT THE PROTAG ISNG USING IT
BRUH HE ASKED THE PREVIOUS ARC VILLAIN TO GIVE HIM THEIR MAXIMUM

She summoned her big bad boss

the next episode is the climax of the arc
And he almost has a mental breakdown due to trap card spam
Tonight in me watching yugioh sevens: the rival character duels a fucking pigeon and his interpreter human
this was a good shot
The robot the protagonist built is still simping for every important girl there is though
Both of them destroyed each other (and their cards) at the same time
Maximums are the perfect hype beast mechanic
yes
this scene was great
he is the miracle maker
DUDE THIS IS THE CHARACTER WHO LITERALLY HALLUCINATED A CARD INTO EXISTENCE
HE IS THE PURE OF HEART AND DUMB OF MIND
HE REALLY SAID THAT FR
holy shit
this absolute fucking madlad won not just in spite of the protagonist having an asspull card
HE WON BECAUSE OF THE ASSPULL CARD
Tiger is literally the best character
(He's talking about the pigeon btw)
At least under Goha Duel rules article 6666
Yes
I am not going to be a judge for a fake anime ruling
I assume that would still be illegal, as someone caused the planes to fly at all
Not just people involved in the duel
But a card being forced into your deck by circumstances *nobody* can control
No
It’s a joke about how all the rules that get brought up during the show are numbers that only contain 6
I am not joking “new card via uncontrollable circumstances” is allowed by the in universe rules
Literally section 6666 part 6 of the dueling rules allows it
Actually yes
THIS MOTHERFUCKER CATCHES A SHOOTING STAR WITH HIS DUEL DISK
AND THAT SHOOTING STAR HAPPENS TO BE SPACE DEBRIS CARRYING THE EXACT CARD HE NEEDS
Yeah
This whole mini arc is fucking asinine and dumb
And it’s so perfect
Shit like this is why sevens is objectively the best card game anime
Fucking sentient ass manga
Oh my god the fucking
MANGA ATTAINING LIFE plot turn
Update on sevens
The rival character is so fucking stupid ||the current main villain basically told him “hey, actually you are one of the villains of this arc”|| and he didn’t think once about it
We’ve got actual dueling aliens
The girl uses dragons
Rush duels are awesome
Good
Protagonist uses a new “galaxy” type
NEW YUGIOH ANIME
IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/358148411343765504/921578649109540864/unknown.png
Still suffering wanting for more LWA as well
Yep
One of those yeah
Or at least has French producers
Because it’s a French show iirc
One of the two
Or a new season idk
It’s getting a reboot
<:EllyFear:495477986586525706>
Oh no
https://mobile.twitter.com/RiseFallNickBck/status/1480056169754505217
I love yugioh sevens
The plot for the first episode of a new arc is that the villain of the prior arc has literally nothing to do that day
That’s what
It’s being the best goddamn yugioh there is
I know what I brought upon myself
Listen episode 71 has a 37 year old single mom with the body of an elementary schooler dueling the female lead over a potentially (as in “these two pots of curry WILL DETONATE IF MIXED) explosive curry
Yugioh sevens episode 70 summary
A ladybug ninja girl with hypno eyes abuses a phobia she inflicted onto the protagonist when she was younger to steal data
The long awaited “villain that fucks with peoples memories/minds” arc yes
important image
Yugioh sevens episode 77

Well then
In yugioh sevens
Monster reborn can be used to completely seal off someone’s memories like an actual magic spell
Yugioh sevens episode 74
There’s a zombie apocalypse and one of the main characters is left dueling a Michael Jackson reference to protect himself from it
Only to have it revealed it was a theme party the whole time
Have fun with the crazy train
watched Kino no tabi the wonderful world (the first 2 episodes of the 2017 version) with a friend just now
its kind of a fun show
I love how Kill La Kill switches between the best and worst animation anyone has ever seen 
But intentionally and it’s great
She’s the same genre of villain but is also a much worse person yeah
LWA carried on this legacy in spades
Trigger smears are always good
Yeah
Honestly it’s only worse ||because Satsuki is her daughter, rather than Chris being some random kid who was compatible with a Symphogear||
She is yes
I should probably track down the movie
I haven’t watched since season 1
I think the plots kinda average but it’s very pretty and the action is decent
I should watch season 2 if that’s a thing
Or at least the movie
This is where that one KLK Symphogear crossover pic comes from yes
I mean I loved the whole thing
But the slice of life stuff I enjoyed a little more
I did prefer the more slice of lifey parts admittedly
But I just enjoy stuff very easily
Personally my favorite trigger show is LWA
But I know some people don’t like the TV anime as much as the OVAs
~~god I still want more of Akko’s nonsense though~~
The KLK dub blooper reel is great
Nonon is definitely the type of character you *need* a good voice for in order to get the most out of
thats fair
her dub voice is fun
yeah Nonon is a little shit
And is basically a walking retcon
My best guess is that it just takes place during the course of the normal shows run
I don’t expect this to go well
They are decent enough
*I wanna be, the very best*
One could argue that’s the entire point
<:EllyFear:495477986586525706>
It’s a streaming service
Exclusive to peacock TV
Nah
An animated series
Oh no
This can’t end well
https://twitter.com/dreamworks/status/1492174262748151810?s=21
I don’t remember them normally looking like that but I also have watched demon slayer in ages
Although her pupils look really fucked up for some reason
It’s a ribbon with tinfoil wrapped around it
That sword looks really fucking stupid
True
Most of that money doesn’t go to the animators anyways
Hell more dubs are good or at least serviceable than bad
Yeah
Hell the dub voice for Kobayashi basically sounds exactly like how I’d imagine her in English
Funimation bad but that’s a different thing entirely
I enjoyed the dragon maid dub anyways
It’s fun
Luke is genuinely one of my favorite characters
he's just so fun
no idea

one of his wins is even against himself in a fever dream

a fever dream where he somehow pulls a card out of his dream and into the real world
everyone else has a fairly even record
Luke is basically the only sevens character without a loss
And I love him
has as many brain cells as he does losses
this fucking buffoon
I still find it fucking hilarious, that the single dumbest character in the series, is the only character in the series to even *tie* playmaker in terms of W/L ratio
we already missed our opportunity when Ver died
I also loved the first Maximum summon, even if it was literally an outright curbstomp with no chance to turn the tides
nope
this is one of my favorite sevens duels
only for her singular turn to be off screened
*remember how much they were hyping Queen up earlier on*
AI rebellion is easy because theres only two good duels in it
but fuck Yusho
and Yusho
hell I think she's the only yugioh parent period aside from Kazuma to duel at all
Yoko Sakaki, former gang leader, single mom, and probably the only yugioh parent that contributes something beyond inspiring memories in the protagonist
so it gets points there
but it does involve Yoko making an attempt to murder the final villain
Yuya's final boss rush was not very fun
yeah his only really noteworthy duel is the last one and like
that gets deflated by the ending
my favorite Arc-V duel is Jack vs Sergei though
it was more just Reiji bullying Roger
the Reiji infinite FTK was fun but hard to call a duel
~~I'm still salty out of how robbed my son sawatari was~~
so basically all of them in some capacity
Zushin was a good moment
besides everyone knows Jaden vs Sartorius would be best because dinosaurs in space
that would take forever
xyz is just way too short to be its own arc
yeah thats fair
but I guess yugioh tournament arcs are like
almost never good
I'm really surprised you put fusion dimension over synchro dimension
honestly I liked the pilot design more, but this is still alright
if they *had* included previous protagonists, it would have just pissed people off
yeah
Yusei is boring but I at least like him more than Yusaku
Yuma I like for being simple but somehow still tacky
given that sevens is ending incredibly soon, i think it'll be fine
yep
and its great
but the rest of the cast literally comments on the ramens progress over the course of the duel
sure its the last bowl of ramen a resturant is ever going to make before it shuts down
one of the early duels is literally over a bowl of ramen
yeah
sevens is that flick to the forehead kanade gave tsubasa in episode 1
and it's a desperately needed breath of fresh air
yeah
even if I also love how seriously they act about a childrens card game
it leans all the way into the silly bullshit after 6 series of taking things probably more seriously than they needed to be
yeah stuff like that is why I love sevens
he was fully willing to blow up a building with himself and hundreds of innocent people inside it just to kill a ladybug
Yuga *really* hates ladybugs
although in Yuga's case its specifically ladybugs
also like Yusei he has a morbid fear of insects
but he's also really laid back and just likes having fun
he's amazing with machines, to the point where he can hack into a duel disk and upload his own ruleset
Yuga is like a halfway point between Yusei and Yuma
either Yuma or Yuga imo
yeah
maybe all the way through synchro at the best
it works great up through the first half of synchro arc imo
yeah
and I think Vrains english OP was just an instrumental
it just doesn't match up to any of the japanese ones
terrible
arc-vs singular english OP isn't uh
https://youtu.be/_KK2soH_tKw
kind of terrible EDs
arc-v had great OPs and uh
oh yeah Hanate is also amazing
for how mediocre yugioh as a series is, its OP game is on point
in no particular order
Take a chance, halfway to forever, get your game on, hyper drive, and Nanananana
Like his first duel with don thousand happened *Billions* of years prior to the show
like
he makes dartz look like a toddler
Astral is genuinely one of the oldest characters in the series yeah
sevens I guess has people having their memories/personalities sealed away via monster reborn
eh

https://ygorganization.com/go-rush-new-character-announced/
But we don’t talk about that
Aside from that period of time when people thought he bootstrap paradoxed his way into existing via Yuzu
Nice
https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/tffkut/new_yugioh_manga_manga_about_ocg_card_lores/
AP sounds cooler
I do love Haruko's whole character archetype though
I enjoyed alternative but I watched like 2.5 episodes of the second one
I have been informed yeah
~~admittedly the first one is the only one I haven’t watched~~
But alternative/the third one felt like some kind of ending
Didn’t it like
Finish with the third one?
didn't secret saturdays get like 3 seasons
so his ability to murder is restrained
he's just on animation
https://ygorganization.com/highlights-from-interview-with-go-rush-director-kondo-nobuhiro/
The manga isn’t as bad
in the case of yuya... performance quality definitely saves it
its better than yuya's dub VA having to voice all 4 versions + zarc
Yep!
He is a wanted hacker
yuya is a wanted criminal
but originally people thought it was an actual factual godforsaken ||Time Travel Incest Boostrap Paradox||
and when one takes control of the body they magically transform to match their appearance
they pack all the yu-boys into a single body, and they can just
take over at will
not only do they introduce time travel
yeah
you know
when people thought the ending of the arc-v manga implied a ||time travel incest boostrap paradox||
behold
the page that ruined an entire manga
That too
But the damn capitalists and their damn sweets
She really did
Because she’s too hongry
Unfortunately Elma is terrible at not scabbing
Shun got blueballed so hard in that duel
“We are all but chocolate chips **AAHAHAHA** on the cookie of life”
“Real fan favorite? We’ll see about that”
“Consardit, what’s that word.. uh, dibs?”
As god intended
I can’t believe he never got his chicken fries
I love shun so much
“DAMN YOU AND YOUR BURGER KING CHICKEN FRIES”
“Take flight my giant mechanical birdie! And punish this pathetic excuse of a villain!”
“I appreciate Yuya because he looks like my previous Yuri-senpai”

Yuya and Yuri: “Ew”
It’s all so good
“I’m Batman”
Most people can’t read

Yugioh actually damages your ability to read
Yes
Watching the first episode of the new yugioh anime
The new protagonist doesn’t even know what a card game is until nearly 7 minutes into the episode
Go rush fun
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/470338641106042890/960227912622166056/unknown.png
okay so I am satisfied that yugioh go rush will probably not be going back down the super serious road a lot of its non immediate predecessors have
Yes it is
maybe if this wasn't rush duels
oh you sweet summer child
Yeah 
Just a shame they don’t credit their artists
It’s a trash fire game
But it’s a trash fire that’s great for roasting marshmallows with
Yeah
I get what you mean though
I totally understand why some people dislike rush as a format
A lot of those reasons are admittedly the reasons I like it
That’s basically what speed duels are
~~speed duels stinky though~~
I love them personally
Rush duels do have a lot of removal
Mainly because the possibility of drawing into a comeback the next turn always exists
That’s fair
But I love rush duels card design honestly
Yeah battle traps exist
And I don’t even know if it was actually printed
(There’s like, 1 rush duel card that negates effects)
The only effects you can use on your opponents turn are traps
Rush duels have no negates
Nope!
He says this while playing a burn deck
Rush duels baby~
Unfortunately none of them are applicable
Or even exist in his world
This delivery right here

This is some good shit
Arc-v is bad but
https://youtu.be/ll35aPi9rpk
Because arc-v is already bad
Watched more yugioh sevens 

Getting through a “my friends have been brainwashed/had their memories sealed” arc

It’s cliche but I always love the yugioh motif of passionate feelings overpowering logic or reason or magic bullshit

Especially when a pair of twins force free a main characters memories through both passion and reminding him of the moment in his life where he was so embarrassed he wanted to die
Yeah no it’s just an otaku chupacabra
Or an otaku in a chupacabra hood
Dude the villain of episode 3 is literally an otaku chupacabra
he is literally an alien
I mean
Who needs fusions or bootleg unions
he's also based as fuck
Roa is such a fun character
giving him a rockNroll/heavy metal themed deck was genius
Yugioh sevens episode 85 "His's monsters effect only works on level 8 or lower monsters"

god no wonder all the best rated episodes of sevens feature this dude
Still lame
Given he lost to her in DP anime
Probably Cynthia

Did they?
The yugioh sevens dub OP doesn’t have lyrics

Now I’m sad
Bruh can you feel the power was great it’s just it wasn’t always tonally appropriate for a show about dimensional genocide
They found him with shark bites from what I’ve heard
So to find a body at all his family is super lucky
I mean
Aside from Pokémon there isn’t much room to go anywhere but up
https://twitter.com/HMKilla/status/1547700656189845507
i love how an actual moment in yugioh sevens is "YOU FOOL, I PLAY A 60 CARD DECK"
A new age of piracy is about to begin, as the historians say
it's still fucking weird to me seeing that invisible MHA girl being anything other than like
a pair of gloves and shoes
finally watching more Yugioh sevens
the female lead wins her final duel of the show and gets her own musical theme with singing attached at the climax
this is what would have happened if dragon ball evolution was a successful movie
she's genuinely in my top 5 yugioh characters

more yugioh sevens

Lol
Yep

Ash is now the #1 ranked trainer in the whole Pokémon world
I think he’s neat but he!s kinda meh
Yeah making Goh the MC wouldn’t be a great idea
The only reasonable thing to do with ash is make him a mentor

Maybe finally let him age
And it’ll completely deflate this big moment if he goes to Paldea and loses to the first random schmuck he comes across
They literally have nowhere to go with him
God I hope they retire ash after this
This is the exact reason TPC spoiled it themselves through their Twitter
Voice actor jokes great

Yeah
Given based on some bios I’ve seen floating around she’s

> from kanto
> a scarily talented battler
> refuses to give her last name/family name to any of her peers. And just doesn’t like talking about her family in general

Which kinda reeks of “my family is famous and I really don’t want to deal with it”
Or descendant in some way
There’s a non 0 chance the new protagonist is Ash’s daughter
God*
Oh good
Just finished jojo part 6
So glad they brought back ||roundabout||

She’s also the flatwoods monster

plus the fact she's spurred on by the "Don't give up on life" thing 
its one of my favorite scenes in the entire season
yeah
especially with how it contrasts in comparison to the transformation you see Kanade go through before it
sure theres the sequence
but then theres the fuckin industrial zone coming out of her back
it really is one of the best
visually not the best
but the presentation and context of it all boosts it so high
i sometimes rewatch the first few episodes because I love how much they characterize Bikki
good
one of my favorite parts of the S1 OST
the casual fluff scene music vibes with me intensely
honestly most of the non-combat songs aside from the piano gekiso I don't remember super well
i just remember liking the casual fluff music a lot
that scream is just
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~mainly because its followed by that goddamn scream~~
*nod*
i think i mixed up whatever plays as Chris falls from the sky with the piano gekiso
i think it plays multiple times but your probably right
refrain might be the wrong word
i know I'm thinking of like
the soft piano refrain of gekiso gungnir
nah not that
*nod*
I'm thinkin of the music that plays as chris "dies" and the final convo with Fine is happening i think
oh is that the piano refrain thing that appears in S1E13 or somethin
