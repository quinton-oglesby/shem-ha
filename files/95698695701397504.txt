Oh my god I love all of them
She does need more representation as a smug
True
I feel like the first one though would work best as an emote
You have failed the vibe check

Well that is okay, mods rules
Please do this I swear I’m not bias- YESSS
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I fully support the zenbu nation
facts
i am also a chris fanatic and i agree with that being  a not good idea
streams i've seen haven't had much lag, but that might just be because I live near the guy that usually streams in my server
I second this idea
Jackbox is super fun
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh my god there’s more of them now
I know it’s late but I used the same link, can’t wait to get to know more gear fellas
As one should
Welcome to the Chris Clan
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
All this power the server has now
<:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884>
no idea
this is getting out of hand
now there are two of them
i needed that right now as dumb as it sounds
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I like how you did the hair and the ribbon
keep up the good work dude, thats clean
~~might just be my tifa bias but~~ feels like a VN character, and it looks pretty official
yoooooo
thats pretty cool
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
AH
They're all so cool
i see you are cultured as well
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
True
Can I be 2
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Wait if there’s a Maria group chat is there a Chris one
The Maritual
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Some just a bit more than others
All of the gears are precious
Kanade is so precious
The perfect recipe
top tier tbh
im love thm
It’s realistic
Yeah, I get that
A flawed character can become great if they can keep persevering through their flaws
But as I was saying
The Two Reasons aren’t why shes my favorite
Thanks a lot you epic gamer
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
You have no reason to believe me but she’s not my favorite because of the Two Reasons
*cough cough* <:ChrisEmbarrassed:663558614610608128>
Yeah the first part was great
I can’t decide which transformations are my favorite
Bruh
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920> <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326> <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752> <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517> <:KanadeSinging:421432676789256202> <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
I like all the gears 
Just Chris a bit more
Okay I didn’t wanna say it
But I like dark oblivion
That’s so in character
Dang
If that’s true that’s hilarious
Bruh
Why did you make me remember it
I just remembered the gratuitous Engrish scene from the first season
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Definitely
It was the last season
Oh my god
Look at her go
The animators were scared that Maria with abs would take over the show
I thought the animators were too cowardly to show them
Wait she does
Bruh
👀👀👀👀
You mean there’s more??
Wait birthday *pack*?
It’s like they have people constantly watching for unofficial gear uploads
True
Her or her Maria voice
Who would be doing the “talking”
In the context of your statement
No I mean
Hikasa or Maria?
humghanomhmganahnahloughonghouse
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
very nice
miku? miku nakano???
They are all baby
They do not need power
I like this too
Whoa I like that
The most weeb stuff I have is Kamen Rider belts
Anyway *they all so good*
I wish I was brave enough to get gear merch
ggo alternative was so good, the voice actors were the highlights
I’d be livid if I made something and someone pinterested it without sourcing
That’s unfortunate
Pinterest is terrible, but thanks for the source
🔫
🦍
||He’s out there writing the script for the show with banjo||
I like that better
Ohhh that makes more sense
The bottle looks drained so I’m guessing this is somewhere in the timeline where ||using genius form kills him to defeat black hole evolt||
That’s so big brain
Oh my god
oh no hamster sees mecha hedgehog kill organic hedgehog
what will she do
This I like
That's the best part
Blessed image
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>

<:ChrisEmbarrassed:663558614610608128>
translations for the many faces of sword please? ~~shes adorable~~
theyre all so precious
thats pretty cool
bruhhhh

yeah that
I think basa is getting nervous because of-
Thank you for both of these
Oh my god
I might be wrong since I just woke up but is that saint germain with abs
I'll try it out maybe
because i know its heresy, but i put gameplay before the jpgs
but for my own experience, whats the gameplay like
I'll tell him
what is it
a friend of mine would be interested in the muscle women game
That look so good
Oh my god
short babby
hey i like that
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> theyre all so cute now
I’m love them
nice marias btw
~~i wish it could be me but im not brave enough~~
~~if only there was someone with chris obsessed in their name~~
i hope the kickstand is up on the other side or else they might get hurt

This channel is almost always blessed
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/349020417719009283/625757794821341184/EBy60zlXoAIcA39.gif
YES
I must admit, I like
Hopefully the years pass by so fast that I won't realize it's been that long so we can get the event
truth
she
aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAHH
She looks fine imo
Everyone must know the majesty of the yukine
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Phrasing?
Uhhh
My heart is yearning for more Chris
Now that I have I am grateful
We’re another layer deep in the dream
I knew the style was familiar but I haven’t seen your post of garren Chris
Slander
The obvious tachibana san
Every Chris is good chris

AGHHHHH
I love that picture
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Chris is ***ultra mega very good***
Yeah sorry I’ll correct myself
They’re so good
Same
This is the ultimate blessing
AH
Ma’am
It’s her
You know it
I still love how stupidly impractical it looks
It took me too long to realize it’s called bayonet charge because Chris is a gun and tsubasa is a blade
We appreciate your efforts

Relate
If it works it works
We are truly cultured
I love that official art
floof chris
Same, something about it makes me drawn to it
Looks like a regular old claymore to me
I already have
She’s just so sweet
Floofy floof
That kills me too
I’ll kill the alcanoise if it kills me
>:(
I’ll make her not sad
She cannot be sad
She’s a burrito
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Good
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
She snom
This is that Hibiki
Hibiki snom
Hibiki snom
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
For reference try something like this
Needs more hearts, but otherwise a great concept
Relatable
called it
did you try to post the muscle thing
i would apologize
if it was an accident and without consent, yes
is she gonna apologize?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Beautiful
I love it
Fixed that for you
> ~~her~~ China dress ~~skin~~ is just so good
Dang so cute
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
*amiya* <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
She’s baby
Protect her
I love this Amiya dump
Fang and liskam are very good
Whoa miku
Something happened
Undeniable
Facts
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
floof chris
Now this is raw swag right here
Yes.
hya ha
I couldn’t stop myself from buying it
Chris headgear hoodie would be rad
<:KirikaMunch:672599382670966785>
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047> <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047> <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047> <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Y E S
You have some good art my dude
I just want her to be happy and confident like her usual self bruh
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
I’d be happier with this content if she was happy
I mean
But she puts off the aura that she doesn’t wanna be there
Y E S <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047> <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047> <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047> <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
She’d probably rather be back at home watching weste-
She just shlorp the spaghet
I guess that’s why I like the spaghetti scene so much
When my favorite characters are upset I find it hard to enjoy the content
Oh my god
I can relate
She has to accept that she’s infectiously adorable
I know right
Praise be to Shem-ha
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I’m going sicko mode for more Chris art

dang i like this source
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:663558614610608128>
So what’s Maria got
Oh wait
I suddenly feel an urge to buy swords
She’s still a pretty sword
No bullying of the sword
Now this is culture
Yes mari we’re talking about protecting the zenbu
Protect the precious zenbu
That is true
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Final consensus
Chris cute
And endorse t
But I get what you’re saying
😔
It be that way sometimes
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Chris?
Was it like a figure or art or whatever
Did they really
Fair points
Yeah she’s turbo cute
Tsubasa is so pretty
aaaaa this is culture
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Miku with cool scarf and sword is cool
Exusiai <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
Chris with braid <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Smol babbys
<:ChrisHey:607742733817479168>
Sorry about just dipping right there but I agree Maria needs hugs after what she’s been through
All the gears do
anyway
a fellow cultured person
i get confused
i just play so many gachas
yeah
cant do #1 but its there
what i mean is my server just started lostbelts if that helps
not the JP server
i've played WW FGO
thats the first time someone's agreed with my opinion on a fate character
that art is so pretty
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
look at the two of them
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Why Chris gotta be cute in almost everything she do
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:663558614610608128>
She’s so smol
baiken is pretty nice
i'm an elphelt guy myself but i can see the appeal
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:ShirabeJoy:672105345316814878><:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785>
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
yeah that dont look like a reluctant embarrassed that looks like straight up humiliation
Yooo this is cool
It's absolutely adorable
P cute
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Is it not?
I agree that kanade is really cute
Shemmy brought it to my attention since I didn’t know it existed
That art
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

**SHE BLEP**
space mountain for the hundredth time does things to people
looks like shirabe
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
ma'am
😳
i hate remembering that
she's funny
yeah i know
~~not just because shes hot~~
da vinci is great
i want hongry seiba gf
awww
its so funny
i knew i was a disappointment
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
yo is that nero and boudica
chris = cute
i dont miss
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
oh god amiya is turbo cute but silverash will kill me
honestly though might be amiya or chen
😳
~~probably because i only get dupes~~
honestly i cant choose a favorite operator
i cant see her without thinking of the arknights add where the guy's like "im really interested in the horn girl, shes really rustling my jimmies" or something like that
saint germain good
this is good culture
~~i'd keep it if it was easier to get the summon juice~~
arknights stays winning
no luck with the granblue muscle girls but there is a dragon girl
im pretty sure there was one or two and i just forget their names
hmmmm
you talking about Erunes?
oh god im gonna be playing so many characters in versus
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
facts
not sure if Zooey is a knight but she sure is the other criteria
I have heard that too
a friend of mine dropped me down the granblue rabbit hole and i have ascended
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
the art style is gorgeous
truth
i'd play katalina in versus but i already manage lancelot with a pocket gran
i am not immune to hot lady knight
pretty much all of the gears are cute in their own way
facts
both are quality
yes i love this so much
take this
you wanna know some of that *real good* stuff
i see
very good culture
best mascot
yooo lappy goat
oh no she is cute too
smol chrises just made my day
all chris are quality chris
That or the third one i cant decide
I picked a good day to check this channel
~~i agree~~
I agree wholeheartedly
they just vibing
an excellent thing to return to
😳
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Rin and saber
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
yo thats some *good* art
then i get musashi AND a nice 4 star
But then one day I said i was gonna uninstall if I got no luck in the next draw
Every time I rolled for her on a rate up, no luck
i've frequently told my other fate friend how musashi is my favorite, so my phone must have transferred the knowledge to the game
lemme tell you a short story about my experience with the desire sensor
but i see what you mean rany, these are quality
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
thanks for clearing that up
ah okay
dang, some of the best happen to be nsfw 😔

ooooo thats good
babey with her spaghet
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
noted
im always like "man i wish i could contribute to these art channels"
but then i realize everybody here has probably scrolled to the bottom of google images already <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
but that is really neat
the plushies
oh i thought you meant
she so cute and gamer
yeah tomoe is in my top three favorite female servants
i'd get one of those cute things if
they didnt cost so much
the judgmental effect from my parents
bruhhh
and pale skin, yes
if we're going in general, i'd say musashi, mash, and emiya
btw, who's your top three? i didnt ask
so many fate characters allows for so much quality art
this is epic
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
wait a sec
most of her clothing is a shade of blue
*why is my friend always correct about my obsession with blue sword wielders*
so all i gotta do is say i'll quit and i get what i want
man i gotta watch symbionic titan again
thanks for the reminder
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
and theyre so cute together
shes so pretty
yoo lets go granblue

i may be biased because of aimi but millaarc is my favorite of noble red
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>

Oh I didn’t look through all of it
CHRIS NO
yooo that marine is sick
noel <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
thats some good smug vampire
that might be my favorite casual chris outfit
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
babey chris
ilove this video
hmmmmm
🤔
uhhh
get some more good marine or noel or something?
the reason for those huge air quotes is
well
its a surprise
mine is a deadlock between coco and matsuri
exactly
honestly i dont know my favorite hololive member
i couldnt
imagine a world without the third generation of hololive
chris could say anything and i'd love it
bless her and takagaki
why not both
*yoooooo*
i dont see whats so bad ab-
oh
we dont thank kerrik enough for this sustenance
i love all of her
oh god i take it back dont make me choose
*fubuki dont let matsuri do anything nooo*
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
yoooo
exactly
facts
im love her so muych
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
oh also, i'm fine with getting pinged if theres good stuff i would like, as exampled by rany and musashiposting
so akiposting is also applicable for a ping of me
aki is just so pretty <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
i really like the diner one and the armor one
this is the best night of my life
LOOK AT HEEEEEER
YYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
~~but uh yeah if anyone finds good aki stuff you know who to call~~
a problem with liking aki though uh
~~because of her *signer bonus* its not that easy to find cute art of her~~
but hey
i still like both of them equally
because i didnt know much anime and most of my exposure was 4kids on saturday mornings
i would get kallen and aki confused purely because of their hair
when i was younger
yo honestly
~~she was my first anime crush actually lol~~
yessss
im talking about aki now
CULTURE

What would you do in response
Bro...
~~I’m not one to go for that kinda thing but if Chris playfully glared at me i might like it~~
I feel threatened
I didn’t think Hibiki could have such an intense stare
alexis is based
<:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

implication that hibiki is anything other than an angel
even if it is edgebikki
yo this is cursed

their craft is amazing

<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>

<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432> musashiiii
awwww
If I got to see both apple pies
I’d join if making said apple pie summoned her
glad i pulled her during a rate up
that was the best day of my life
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH
yeah lets go
yoooo these all look so clean
~~not because of my chris bias~~
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
one of my friends actually made a hibiki trophy for his smash clone i'm helping him concoct
it's just a sketch though we arent at the modelling phase yet
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
i cant compare when she's in babey mode vs epic mode because saber is always too good to compare
i love saber so much
borgar made my night
Thats like saying you're not a fan of a movie because you don't know the composer
That
doesnt make sense
yeah those people are like, somehow able to tell who it is by their breathing and thats *pretty weird* ngl
Oh yeah, I can relate, I was a mod on a server myself, before it died. Maybe I just feel that way because said server had drama every other week.
In my opinion, mods should be ready for drama, as it's an eventuality in any server. They shouldn't be like "ughhh why do work when supervising a server?"
Worse things than drama will happen if a groomer is left unchecked.
If they're mad at you for exposing a groomer, they don't know what's right.
I agree with melua, pronoun roles seem really convenient.
I think they’re referring to “pick your head up, your crown is falling”
Did we actually rip the papers-
It just makes us look bad.
Honestly, I hate people who try to act that way when they clearly know what they’re doing. If they’re well knowing enough to say it’s their condition, it’s not.
Wait what
im defending the genre
im not defending him
no i mean
honestly just let someone enjoy watching goofy show if they wanna watch it
dont make it a whole thing
just why
Both of your statements
That is also true
Obviously I wouldn’t be able to dislike *all* of them
I know, I was making a joke about me sticking to one thing
Dang I just noticed his higurashi pfp
Now I can’t read it without feeling yucky
No idea
That’s why I think calling himself the emperor of anime youtube May be a little shortsighted
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
It’s always the anime youtubers
I won’t move on
I’m gonna stick to disliking his videos over and over and see how he likes it
I realized how hypocritical I sounded since I go ape in the brain mode for fire emblem and the like, so I apologize again for the assumptions.
I apologize for my bad phrasing as well
I mean, I like me a fire emblem and a sakura wars from time to time
I’ll admit I was definitely in the wrong for assuming wrongly
But some tanks are cool
I don’t vibe with glorifying war either
Nobody is reporting on much of it
He was stated to be brain dead a few days ago
We aren’t sure of most details
Tru
If the leaks are true, ruined the whole thing
But uh
I enjoyed the first game fine enough
I know right
~~cowards~~
George was not resisting arrest at all according to footage from a camera
i wouldnt be surprised at this point
but it is a young voice
yeah and all the other voices
someone asked if the kid spoke and the post vanished
the link i sent has him speaking
sent it here
no i
well to verify, that is the voice of the kid
oh
i posted it
at this point im not sure
thats not an adult
listen to his voice
i hate this country
You can tell they're children because they actually respond to protestors asking them questions
https://twitter.com/georgeadventure/status/1266701189611245572?s=20
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:663558614610608128>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Yeah cry battler, cry
get outta here kinzo nobody wants to read umineko
An average of $100 is worth it for all three of them
I still want all of them
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
She’s so smol
Such is the price of salvation
I need that smol Chris so much
so i am summoned
i heard talk of the best mobile rhythm game
EWWW
That sounds fun
Okay that’s a relief
I wouldn’t be any good then I’m mostly a normie
Oh we are supposed to choose shows people won’t know?
oh no
ohhh no
the i am mad scientist scene
STOP IT
oh god i just realized they might throw in western pop culture to try and keep the integrity
zenbu 2
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
And they’re used to get kids into Star Wars
Those are just amazing
Like the animations on the Star Wars kids channel
I need to like
Watch this show somehow
I saw that sequence on twitter
I was blown away
Well I didn’t read the Bible so
*Biblical themes:*
(+) bringing judgment on someone who tries to put herself on the same pedestal as God Himself
_ _
*Content to Look Out For:*
(-) blatant but unstated homosexual themes (Hibiki and Miku sleeping together and bathing together)
Short hair and smug is very good
Ahem
Anyway
Humongous humghalumhhanuhnuhlogunghous
These dahoonkabankhaloos
Some major dobonhonkeros
Oh boy
The smug energy indeed
im ready to be hurt again by s2
never ending sufferin
and so he got stuck with the three stooges
ah yes
well actually kazuma ||didnt save someone from truck kun, he jumped in front of a slow tractor and died from shock|| unless im missing a joke
<:KirikaCry:671948299179130885>
dark oblivion the goat
people are uncultured
man why she gotta be so unhappy in everything :(
lemme pull a shark tank, i'm out
oh wait shes unhappy
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>

awww
NATIONAL HOLIDAY
well you heard them
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
dang
how do they explain naruto, hero academia, demon slayer, and a bunch of others
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
yooooooooo
i see gridman
i approve
ah i see
i believe you
i'd assume being the maou is important for a political show
i havent watched it i just think shes cute <:ShirabeSob:701475635025019000>
~~so i can see potentially the only two reasons why people watched it~~
dang
ah
and it wasnt interspersed with action scenes here and there?
she was too cute for the people
i have too much shows on my backlog anyway
regardless, cute demon girl
eh
__***EVEN BETTER***__
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
nice
is it wrong to pray in regards to a demon
oh no another cute demon girl
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
bruh
the character looks familiar
ye
i think one of my friends watched this show actually
awww
either that or i get to know people enough that i trust them
i wouldnt be caught dead being obvious with what i __like__
i just think they're neat
oh no no not like that
~~cant believe it took that one game on steam that came out a few weeks ago for me to like demon girls~~
man i need to watch that show again to prepare
promare is one of the coolest movies i've seen in recent years
i won't try to advocate for jojo fans
we're insufferable
Yoooo
Dang then why isn’t xeno a queen she’s great
But the baka tsurugi is pretty quality as well
That’s pretty based too
Dang
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
I like
Yesssss
Favorite again
😳
So are you using “fighter” as an analogy
She’s that dumb
Oh
I think I know my favorite
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Yeah her
Oh
Wait is that her name
No the one with blue hair
What about the epic other character who’s name I forget
Ah
I can see
Oooohhhh
Oh
Would protect though
<:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
And couple that with the fact that I did not know what koneko looked like
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I said short blue hair was based
I mean if you scrolled up
I knew short blue hair was based
😳
I love when voice actors have such great range
Not bad pain, her voice is amazing
~~I felt a pain in my heart when she spoke is that bad~~
So very nice
I’m fate trash so I know her as Marie Antoinette
👀
I mean
The voice’s name is a way
I know who yoko hikasa is
....Haven’t seen that either
I
Have not watched that either
Also I would take either
YOOOOOOOO
just for clarity
who are their voice actors
oooh
Oh I see
That’s way different than I thought
Oh
So going by chess rules
Is there another faction or smth
Oh so it’s like a clan deal?
Bruh
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
i swear im not biased because of her voice
man
anko is underrated
i'm assuming so
i know boruto is in the future but man...
oh no
This song is kino perfectly distilled into music
big time rush is coming back after the quarantine so i'm back in my phase
