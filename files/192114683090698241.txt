Hello
Don't have anywhere to paint in my new apartment :/
I haven't touched this thing since 2019

The EG Nu kind of has a frame lol

I say that, and yet

The Bael was a downgrade tbh
Granted, the only other IBO HGs I enjoyed were grazes and shidens since I hated the Gundam frame
It's so cool
The Sigrun is my new favorite IBO HG, dethroning the Grimgerde

Another edgy astray design

My friend came back from Japan and got me the statue entry grade kit as a souvenir
This Nu Gundam... is indeed just for show!

They've come a long way
Polycaps needed to be shaved to fit
My first koto kit was their chibi saber lily from a decade ago
This has the nicest plastic quality of any kotobukiya kit Ive dealt with

Wonder if the GM Spartan will improve upon the base kit
released during the HG Age line and after multiple GM kits with double elbows/the same shield but color-separated
marking stickers as foil stickers but they don't fold/keep their fold well
Single 90 degree elbows on a 2012 HG GM kit smh
I wish the HGUC GM Sniper II was a better kit for its time
Sure looks like an Okawara design
Was playing around with spare parts leftover from buying option body sets to upgrade their base forms
The designs are symphogear-ish
30 Minute Sisters are fun

I don't understand why the box version of the eg strike excludes the armor schneiders
Doesn't really say that but it's possible

I bought a second standard Dilanza ~~for the shield~~ to make a custom
Probably
Why couldn't the standard one come with two of the regular shoulder shields smh
The Dilanza really grew on me

Obligatory joke
Finished Guel's Dilanza

I have another on the way because ~~I forgot I preordered it from somewhere else~~ I plan on doing a custom paintjob
Darilbalde my beloved

I guess the revive is more standardized in terms of joints...


I still think that, actually
Though tbh I remember thinking "wait the 2007 HGUC Ground Gundam was a pretty good HG, why does it need a revive over something like the Exia?"
I think the ground war set, but it was designed for the old HGUC Ground Gundam with different proportions
Actually, the visor on the parachute pack's ground gm head looks bigger for some reason
The HGUC Ground Gundam is the same base kit in different colors. The head proportions should fit your HGUC revive Ground Gundam perfectly (And the head in the parachute pack is probably the exact same head).
It's p-bandai though, so expect awful secondhand prices
Kind of reminded me of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandal
Saw this in relation to the ongoing baby formula shortage

Facebook holds ppl in different parts of the world to different standards
Make it make sense
I reported a series of anti-LGBT rants and comments from Indonesians and none of them violated community guidelines. I redirected one of their comments back at the poster and that apparently violated community guidelines, even though it didn't mean anything without the original comment. So like, redirecting a homophobic comment back at the Indonesian homphobe is a violation, but their original comment isn't.
That actually makes sense
Isn't Ukraine the motherland of a lot of eastern European culture or something
Taiwan is interesting bc ppl from all over he mainland fled there shared their food cultures, resulting in a unique food culture there
They're very different cuisines
One has an emphasis on numbing and spicy, the other on natural ingredients and less intense cooking methods like steaming
Well, there's a pretty big difference between Sichuan and Cantonese food
Maybe with some regional variation for bao
Like scallion pancake or bao
Some Chinese dishes are pretty universal though
Didn't that happen with Taiwan and Thailand
I mean
Less spicy in Taiwan's case, not spicy and sweet in Japan's case
But Japan and Taiwan both have their own takes on mapo tofu
I like Sichuan food
Perhaps, but regional descriptors are useful
Sure but attributing Chinese things primarily to Taiwan or HK doesn't directly affect that sort of thing
I still don't think hating a country justifies revising facts and history
I'm pretty sure the motivations are different though
Yeah that just seems kinda messed up
I guess that's the sort of double standard I'm thinking about
Takoyaki is very widespread in taiwanese night markets as well, but takoyaki would never get attributed to the Taiwanese
Oh yeah, Taiwanese food is a really interesting mix of various regional Chinese cuisines and traditional and western Japanese cuisine
It was a hole-in-the-wall-ramen shop
When I did study abroad in Japan, my host family took me to a "Chinese restaurant"
Not like the Japanese would ever claim Chinese food as their own though
I recall an article by a Taiwanese person complaining about how ramen joints in the west were serving gua bao "without acknowledging its Taiwanese roots"
It's just weird to see it be predominantly associated with the diaspora
I mean, that's the case bc the people who brought it over are the same ppl from the place where it originated
I guess a "California burrito" would have fries and guac
Yeah but most street tacos here (LA) are just regular street tacos
The meaning kind of changes
Wouldn't that be "Taiwanese gua bao" rather than "gua bao, taiwanese steamer buns"
Idk, I've seen a fair number of articles that try to do this sort of thing
https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/travel/2021/12/how-to-make-the-perfect-gua-bao-taiwanese-steamed-buns
Echoed by those who try to hit on the Chinese international students
Kind of flies in the face of the whole "we don't hate the Chinese ppl, just the CCP" narrative the media's been pushing the past few years
I still feel like the reason it would sell less is hypocritical on some level
Also, Taiwan and Hong Kong would very much like their own identities separate from the mainland
It's an equivalent comparison, ignoring geopolitics
California used to be part of Mexico and many ppl of Mexican descent reside there
I thought the western world agreed that weaponizing cultural erasure is morally wrong
That has nothing to do with their food though
Like, how would ppl react to "California street tacos"
Seems like a double standard
But they have nothing to do with the CCP, so why?
Because that might negatively impact sales
I mean, they probably don't want to be associated with China
Why is cultural erasure okay against political enemies
Like for dim sum, gua bao, and night markets
I've noticed that... Businesses? Media? In the US have been trying to associate Chinese things with Taiwan or Hong Kong whenever possible

Though I haven't visited either in the last 5 years so idk
Attributing various Chinese things to Taiwan (or Hong Kong) seems mainly a western thing, not all that prevalent in Taiwan or Hong Kong from what I remember
Yeah, so the context is quite different
*s
The Chinese food there is from the diaspora and not native to the indigenous Taiwanese
Yeah but Taiwan is completely different
I thought we were talking about Europe in general
But also very strict regulations
Doesn't Switzerland have a huge gun culture or something
Truly a Japanese tradition, really thought it might have been different this time
let me change that to 1/99
My bad, it sounded more ironic in my head
When you're a weeb but don't read Japanese history
????????????????

50/50 on whether the perp did it bc he's too right-wing or not enough
Would lean towards the latter normally bc history, but you never know
Have they determined the motive yet for this?
Despite him also being one lmao
By a Japanese right-wing nationalist
That guy also got stabbed in public
Is it not a confirmed assassination attempt yet?
https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20220708_37/
"Japanese right-wing nationalist commits an act of terrorism for the 37th time"
-Literally Japanese state media, which is right-wing
"Was the CCP involved"
Well he needs to make it about his agenda, so
motherfucker give me back my 2 braincells
https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1545274002389684224
They're pointing out the trend lmao
Huh
https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20220708_27/
pls save the Japanese youth

Anyway, hoping for Abe's recovery regardless of his denial of Japanese war-crimes bc
the same demographic that has assassinated or attempted to assassinate Japanese politicians and otherwise prominent figures who weren't being right-wing enough for their tastes in the past
One major demographic signs up for that
It's not confirmed that it's bc Abe wasn't right-wing enough, but I mean, former JSDF member, so....
I'm still curious about the motive
Best to ignore them tbh
There are many people commenting who lack a basic understanding of Japanese history, culture, and politics
Why do those bozos' opinions on guns in Japan matter
I feel like we're having separate conversations
Guns are not a concern in Japan
Not with guns per se, but assassinations
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimanaka_incident
It might inspire copycat crimes like one the previous instances though
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Inejir%C5%8D_Asanuma
Japanese ultranationalists ü§ù  Chinese nationalists
     Wanting Japanese right-wing politicians to die

Everyone
Yeah but I feel like they were impossibly close to kissing several times in the movie
It was beautiful

Finally watched the revue starlight movie
!!!

Pls draw more Lilith, I'll keep buying them acrylic stands and continue subbing to fanbox üôè
The better Konbu Wakame character
Oh
And since the white-haired girl seems serious and no-nonsense, the chances of MC being genki and having 0 braincells have increased üëÄ
There is a non-zero chance of yuri

Yoasobi hype
I made that statement after watching the prologue and the 2nd trailer. Hoping for this show to take more of the X route when it comes to the characters. Garrod was my favorite MC.

ed 2 sounded way worse than mosaic kakera
I was playing battle royale in AMQ and learned the hard way that a code geass rebroadcast with new op/eds came out recently
Why do rebroadcast op/eds exist
My local karaoke place's joysound doesn't have it but has the 2nd op for some reason
I thought that was an unusual situation or something
Oh yeah, Toki wo Koete
~~Granblue collab~~ movie when
yeah, they're the ones who made the shitpost(ier) segments in pop team epic
and they apparently got the shitpost artist for pop team epic to make the illustrations for this
Orange Range did the code geass r2 opening
Decided to look it up and it's pretty cursed
So.... this one master duel meme youtuber keeps using this song in his vids bc he runs suships
