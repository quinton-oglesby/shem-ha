Yeppers!
One for the left and one right.
There'd have to be two for every character.
Oh yeah this would be a pain to do. If she says no I'd understand.
<:HibikiKiss:738240567049191505><:MikuKiss:738240587014340649>
It would be good to know, yeah.

Hello!
Hi hi!
Hi there!
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Thanks!
Medabee!
Interesting.
The style is cool though.
I'm not even sure if I'm proud of the finished product but I wanted to at least make it.

Chris car!
I have to say the drawing is sick so far.
Nifty.
Oh my Ryuki that is awesome.
Oooh.
I dig the claw arm.
Ooh.
Amazing.
Sick.
Ahhhhhhh.
What's this?
Nice.
Nice stuff.
Not sure if you want feedback but I think maybe you can attempt doing more of a consistent pixel size for the animations. Aside from that I'm interested to see where you'll go with this. 👀
EGG.
That's awesome!
Cuteee.
Also neat!
How come?
Ahhhhhhh.
Raine answering to Sam's requests once again.
Art.
I like the shoes. The sword and colors are also really cool.
Regardless I love it!
Interesting.
Ooh, this is actually pretty cool and sick. Mind if I ask the inspiration?
Is- is Miku using what I think she is?
YES! GOATHORN.
My bad, I can move it.
They're performing traffic safety.
Aww.
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
A friend showed me this and he doesn't even like Faiz.
It makes me sad.
I hate that post so much.
Surprised there's that many cosplays.
I feel bad for finding these images cute.
Committed to itself?
This same person said it's like Rider but if it didn't have the toy gimmick limitations and more uuuuuuuuuuh.
Since they were presented as an endless threat.
I remember someone comparing the Noise to Showa monsters.
You're not wrong.
In a world where people are being threatened by armies of monsters?
They're also uuuuuuuuuuh.
Ignite literally is using the steal power from the enemy tactic.
And gear uses a lot of the logic.
Initially at least.
Since Build was basically the original premise with all the Heisei stuff added in.
They're both using stuff from Ichigou I guess.
Does that count?
They both are trying to follow the rules of Ishinomori.
I mean...
Both biological hybrids which is the only reason they can Transform.
Actually is a surprisingly good comparison.
That...
Anyone gonna' talk about Maria being outside?
She cut into the wall to stay up there.
Why are they so cute?
I just like that ends with a hug since I'm into simple things like that.
To sunshine.
I like how it goes dark and then light again.
I dunno why but I love it.
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336297674707828747/762909811179782164/77662756_p0.jpg
Found it.
It was more of Miku being her various forms.
Someone sent it here.
I mainly remember seeing the Miku running to hug hibiki art in Which she briefly becomes Shem-ha.
I can talk there.
Want to go to discussion?
I think I used to say Symphogear is kinda like if there was an animated Rider season that evolved into a Sentai.
Kaneko is a fan of the creator if that counts
She's the tertiary heel turn yeah.
>initially aggressive to lead, uses bike, one of the finishers was a kick.
Also Tsubasa is very much like a stereotypical secondary.
YOU-
This image hurts me on a spiritual level.
The pout makes it.
Awww.
Chris hasn't graduated yet by the end of XV. Just accepted to college... I think?
You ever think about the jobs the cast have after HS? Aside from Tsubasa and Maria of course.
~~My bad.~~
Thought they got paid allowance.
It's so weird to see her smoking.
And Chris is often nicknamed Chris-chan.
The Sonic Pikachu thing is chris-chan.
Chris-chan cosplaying Chris-chan.
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
So much long hair.
I just like the relationship between yellow punch girl and purple mirror girl.
Best ship. (Subjectively speaking).
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Cute.
This is making me interested in trying Nanoha.
WHAT.
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
I thought this was safe for work.
That works surprisingly well with Miku.
What does Yo nonke mean?
Oh just the general vibe? Was thinking it was based on a specific one.
I feel like I've seen this artstyle somewhere but I don't know where.
https://twitter.com/foshymooo/status/1315635798880874496
It looks like Leo convoy yeah.
She finally joined the crew.
Awwwwwwww.
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
I looked up and tbh I think I have a similar feeling with Lily.
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864><:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
He appeared in the Anime as the dad and Ultra made it an event.
Actually it's confirmed basically.
He's the polepelago dude.
I will never forget learning you casually meet their dad.
And this is literally breaking me right now.
She did but it still made her become abusive.
Oh my gosh...
My goodness.
This is literally a break the heels moment.
Goodness why is this my favorite type of character arc.
Her attire change and switch to upbeat excitement is the visual representation of this.
In order to make her mom understand and help Nebby she needed to change her attitude.
But yeah, that's kinda her thing.
I love them both dearly.
They're hand and hand.
Sun and Moon when it comes to characterization is arguably the strongest in the franchise.
Oh my gosh is literally my favorite type of character arc?
She's literally finding her own footing and self.
She broke away from that.
That's why she changed her hair and clothes.
Lusamine has an OBSESSION.
She's literally dressed up as a Nihilego.
Wait Fenny, do you know about the whole she's dressed up as a Nihilego detail?
I feel so bad for her and her brother.
OHHHHH YEAHHHHH.
This is a new one.
They in love.
What.
Because movies have all the answers.
The fourth is movies.
You literally got it exactly right.
You read my mind.
Dude.
Or fourth.
Kicking is the third best answer to everything.
I was looking for it.
THAT'S THE ONE.
You're not wrong actually.
Is Tsubasa green then?
Wait.
It looks slightly similar to the one I use.
I feel like the Hibiki one is vaguely familiar.
I was trying to find one but it was a silhouette of Xv Hibiki.
I got an idea.
What is that sickle hair.
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Still adorable.
~~Primeverse is xdu right?~~
What the.
The Hatsune Kohinata we finally got.
AWWWW.
Yeah I'm out.
It getting brutally destroyed with the heart being the only remaining thing.
Now whenever I think of Nephilim I think of...
Great.
Oh.
I ship Ver with his ego.
So like if I ship a brick with a blade of grass that'd be crack shipping?
Well that's a ship.
I heard Suite is good.
Oh my gosh...
Beautiful pair.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Now we're talking.
Yes.
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
AWWWWW.
People hate short hair?!?
Why is long haired Miku trending. Not even complaining.
Fourze was always an odd aesthetic.
It works.
Ya' know what.
I see.
I dig it.
Now I get it.
Him.
Oh yeahhhhh.
Sounds familiar.
What is this.
Yes I believe?
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864><:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
And voice acting.
Character design.
So the best type of fist bump?
PUNCHING.
That's a valid feeling, Star.
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
They both have spirit buddies.
Also I will just say Chris will protect today for her *tomorrow.*
Hole in the what?
AWWWWW.
To make you feel better this is why when Hibiki rushes forward she makes her wake up by shattering the helmet.
They speak a thousand words and more.
If I learned anything is that music and images MEAN EVERYTHING.
And who is this character?
Who?
*She refuses to let the helmet open up out to her.*
She doesn't want to open her eyes and see the sunshine.
She looks like a monsterous threat.
It's because she's scared after wearing the gear.
I sadly found a way to make it sadder.
It would make her cry more.
She can't look at her at the moment.
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
Woah.
COMPLEMENTARY COLORS.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Sengoku driver.
WAIT A MINUTE.
Gungnir Kitaa.
How much does the commissioner sell?
We seriously need the translation.
They swap last names.

Lemme find it.
Wait I have one artwork I found neat I can send.
Oooh, I want to see.
Broken free from the fear.
Insert me bringing up eyes finally open.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
(Wait am I in the group now?)
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Love you too.
Thank you.
Awwwwwwww.
Also dm me too.
Yes?
Flies in the house.
Since she can cook.
Miku uses it in the kitchen.
Wait they already do.
They will finally move in toge-
Is that a friendnship ring or a real one?
Yes queen.
Because 4 has Chie.
Persona 4 or 5?
Pretty sure everyone on this server who talks frequently does.
Feels persona-y I think?
Nah it's her.
A double edged hand.
I'm a man of emotion.
Someone please make me stop.
And free themselves from the original sin at the same time.
And save eachother simultaneously.
My people.
You're a TF fan.
Wait.
Burger Chris!!!
That's sick.
Yooooo.
Yo that's low-key sick.
THEN I'LL MAKE HER BEFRIEND ME FIRST!
SHE IS SMILING AND IT'S WHOLESOME.
https://twitter.com/mutukiriichi/status/1318747819444850688
Or a D:
I couldn't tell if that was a :C
Wait.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
AWWWWW.
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
Since the altruism or so.
I was trying to sound clever or something.
The only thing holding back is that she has to love herself first.
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Leave the room.
Woah.
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
She's staring.
LEGO SHIRABE.
Lego Shirabe.
Tsubamaria child.
That armor is still sick.
Tsubasa Ichival.
Still want to see alt gear used designs.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Oh yeahhhhh.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Who's in who's body in the Tsubasa/Hibiki image?
Wait.
https://www.deviantart.com/r59k6/art/Hibiki-Miku-Symphogear-816970494
That's cute.
Sick.
What the shark?
https://twitter.com/a_yaco_/status/1320759788905533440
Hibooki.
G... X...
The only thing missing is the X.
Awww.
Tiny!!!
Okay so I wasn't crazy for noticing that.
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
https://twitter.com/nyanmaru1121/status/1177982874269519872
Huh.
2. Interesting.
1. How in the hey do you have that emote.
Oh.
Elf-nine.
Funny because Chris uses guns.
Wait I think I've been in a hotel room like that before.
Build MG.
Woah.
Hugs.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I feel like I've seen this artist on Twitter
So much drunk.
Donuts.
The Mecha Gear.
WOAH. WOAH. WOAH.
Holy spit.
That's a flock.
OHHHHH.
The first one I mean.
Yooooo, who's this character?
Imagine Tsubasa collabing with Nana Mizuki for a concert.
Yeppers!
In this it's because she's reading the manga for Gear in the world of Gear which was the source of the whole charm whatever.
Kinda joking at something outside the world of the story.
Why does that rhyme.
Wonder if anyone remembers her classmates from G.
I liked when the Protags just came in to play instruments.
Fwow.
IT BABY!
GIRATINA!
ELEMENTAL RULER DRAGON.
HOLY ANGEL DRAGON.
And sea dragon.
And armored dragon.
Mecha dragon.
WOAH.
What is this.
Aw.
Cute.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
So. Much. MIKU!
This is overwhelming.
**07.**
07.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
MIKU!
Much.
So.
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Oh.
Woah.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Oh dess.
Nice.
How come this only made me realize Kanade's Gear makes her arms covered.
<:ShirabePlease:724034356192215081>
Awww.
Need more Hibi-Miku.
THE ART IS TOO CUTE.
UGH!
Yukine!
Awww, hugs.
Wait does this mean Miku is a robot.
Gungnir.
My.
Oh.
Berserk form and hoppy fella'.
Ah yes.
Rabbit Yo-yo Shirabe works ngl.
I love it.
Wow.
I need to see more of those gear rider esque designs.
WOAH WOAH.
She just hates physical contact.
Who follows them because she cares.
Chris is secretly a romantic.
WAIT IS THAT CHRIS IN THE BACKGROUND?
Duality of relationships.
***Especially because the last two images.***
The sailor moon based tweet scares me.
I don't know what emotion that image gives me.
At least the lungs are close to the heart?
I don't like this image.
Is that a whip?
Wait.
Smiling Shirabe is blessed.
Oh.
Genjuro's outfit.
Hear me out.
Dess.
Why is she a demon?
I... Think?
I think.
Just like her.
Basa is a boss...a.
I liked Maria's Axz outfit tbh.
I like the XV outfits a lot.
Oh wait.
Favorite outfits:
Tsubasa: XV?
Chris: G.
Hibiki: GX.
Miku: G or XV.
I need to make a list.
So I'm not the only one who liked the Axz outfit.
Is it wrong that I want her hoodie?
Why.
Yes.
Apparently if you wear Gungnir you look sick in suits.
Lovely.
https://twitter.com/jampan0823/status/1327606828830580740
I did find some movie sequels pretty good.
That is true.
Those are called sequels.
Also heck yeah.
OH YEAHHHHH.
Feeding the dog.
**Yukine.**
Hoenn, Unova, and Alola fan here.
I see I'm not the only person who liked Oras... I think?
They both punch I think.
Dog army.
*Glasses.*
She's really about about them SPACE.
The eyes are staring into my soul.
So cute.
This is making me smile and it hurts.
Awww.
I really need to play or see stuff for Xenoblade 2.
Welsh gap!
Adorable.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
https://twitter.com/nyanmaru1121/status/1329427417291649025
Yuki yunna?
Is tha-
Also since they dominate the market there now.
I mainly just to preserve the genre.
2. Aruto's pointy hair bits.
1. Girl Woz.
Things to point out.
YESSS.
Also IS THAT BABY CHRIS IN THE GREY HOODIE?
Genius girl!
Genius girl.
PENGUIN MIKU.
Penguin Miku.
Jiiiiiii.
What is even up with the double heels.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Ah.
What does it mean?
Who is this?
Need Gear x Goku Uniforms.
Oh yeah her.
Sharon?
That Chris hair twirl.
It gives me life.
Seriously curious on what caused Maria to be so associated with card games.
Lovely.
Oh my goodness.
That gave me chills.
Ties!
Need more of it.
Awesome.
Bea!
So you ever notice how Chris' hair changes between S1 and G?
Chris!
Miku is speechless.
https://twitter.com/sns2323/status/1330489572170592257
It's too adorable.
I think it says that yeah.
OHHHHHH.
~~What is Sakimori?~~
I've always been curious.
Shirabe with Tsubasa style.
https://twitter.com/monato2033/status/1331241165056688128
Also hugging the berserk form and calming her down gives me life.
My head-canon: Miku gave her the bow. It complements them.
Inject some into me too.
More Hibi-Miku is lovely.
https://c.tenor.com/EPZS64Pl_BsAAAAM/symphogear-cry.gif
A sunshine needs her sunbeam.
I will hope for her being alive.
And AU Bikki is >:(
AU Miku is ^-^

Now I can just...
Oh thank goodness it isn't horror.
I love it when they do a Peanuts esque style.
Because Miku is her tree.
"Koala."
Oh I love the name for the first image.
Give me all the HibiMiku.
YES.
KiraShira!
Matt as always giving the good stuff.
OH MY GOODNESS.
Genjuro would feed them all.
Woah.
Wait that's Kanade isn't it.
That is sick looking.
I want to save the first Maria image.
https://twitter.com/AceYuriBot/status/1331834423575072771
BANG!
I'm saving that.
SHE HAS A SCARF!
MIKU. ART!!!!
MIKU ART.
But I don't remember where.
I swear I know the scene it's referencing.
That's such a move.
HIBI-MIKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
*Breaths in.*
Finally she can play Doom eternal.
Which eeveelution would each one use?
Okay.
You ever think about how Chris' hair changes between S1 and G?
There's too many good ones in this batch.
To all these images.
I've finally caught up.
Bro.
Thank you!
Gotcha'.
I need translations.
I don't remember the name though.
That's a csm exclusive.
Masked Noise.
I'd watch that.
I mean.
Mother of Tsukuyomi.
https://twitter.com/Jourd4n_/status/1332911195557269507
Ooooh.
Sevenger I think.
She's wearing a head band of that one Ultraman robot.
I love this.
Matt.
HIBI. MIKU!
I'll calm down now.
HIBIMIKU!

Yes and Dess.
Awwww.

Oooh.

There's one where she's in a parka.
Ooh ooh.
Okay that's kinda sick.
Better.

9 is September.
The guy in the suit uses a phone to type out 913.
Get the other better one here.
*You're the second person who does this to me.*
STOP.
NOOOOOO.
September 13th-
*Berserk Bikki and Ignite flashbacks.*
Insert something about how Build and Gear both have the tower of babel.

They're amazing.
I don't know how to mentally process all these images.
https://picsart.com/i/image-manga-132678032001201
I'll continue in <#377148557796442134> if that works.
It seems harmless.
Ahhhhhhh.
It is.
Actually I think for the first one it's more because he just doesn't like tokusatsu.
Oh yeah, the first half of the series was kinda more... Artistic?
~~I just like henshin heroes.~~
Seeya'!
Reminds me of the one time I saw Kaneko commenting on being a fan of a Turboranger.
Despite their identities are pretty seperate.
Narrative beats have a similar vibe.
Yeppers!
I need to find the site. I just googled it.
THAT HAPPENED.
OH YEAHHHHH.
That one.
Oh yeahhhhh.
They'd be in a mecha game. But would they be in a magical girl game?
And fast.
They'd stand out for being smol.
Whenever I think of him I just hear Senketsu and Momotaros.
Finally, the Mecha in my Mecha Anime.
I don't think the pencil sharpener is done giving us the dog head.
I just like saying the show is yes.
Even if they'd had to do size they could always bring back the giant from burning X-drive.
Is that a dragon sword?
Woah it's the season 1 girl but older!
I feel like I should recognize the thing it's referencing.
This is vaguely familiar...
AUNET!
BAYONET.
OHHHHHHH.
Awwww.
https://twitter.com/tobelate_bot/status/1304808964173885440
She going full on rice and rice.
Now I want that too.
https://twitter.com/mcrtj00/status/1335390165628424193
Oh my.
I'm saving that.
Awwwwwwww.
Depression.
Whenever I look I just cry.
It's just shows that she cares and stuff.
Both?
Chris hugging intentionally for comfort I can't tell if it's giving me a warm feeling inside or tears.
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
I dunno why.
It's always surreal to see the cosplays.
Fine dining.
~~Does this mean Poochyena Miku?~~
Growlithe Hibiki works.
And Miku Gamora.
Since I only recognize Tsubasa as Baltan.
Does anyone know which kaiju each one is?
WOAH.
They get along though.
She's Kanade's neighbor who lives in the lungs.
She already lives...
In her heart.
I don't know what that is.
She truly is a saint.
There's a second image as well.

I JUST GOT THE REFERENCE.
WAIT.
I love it.
MIKU!
*The power rangers.*
Garie Christmas! To call a good night!
Dess!
Thanks!
Gotcha'.
What does the image text say?
HORSE.
Finally, an ax wielder.
Nice.
I love it.

THEY'RE ADORABLE TOGETHER.
EMOTIONS.
YESSSSSS.

So much Miku too.
I can't unsee woman Genjuro.
Angy.
Aww.
Thanks!

I need translations for this.
This is best.
Ma Chris Dancing.
There was.
I'm screaming over a collab.
THIS IS THE ONE TIME.
I'm NOT over it.
I'm not over it.
We would not be here if it was.
Biker miku!!!!
Ahhhhhhh.
Who's she?
Lol!
Kiramager. The art is a reference to an episode where kirameiblue got a clamping item stuck on his head because of a motw.
~~I think I prefer it now.~~
But man the look is growing on me.
I think it's more of I'm just not used to it.
Man I don't know what to think of Maria without cat ears.
I love it I love it I love it I love it!!!!!!!!;
This is the best.
A bayonet.
Minia.
Oh my gosh I just realized they're a quartet.
Neon Genesis Symphogear.
Is this Gaogaigar.
MoMiku.
That's a new one.
Older Carol is something.
I love it.
Ooh.
One of the best lads from Orb.
Oh hey Juggler.
Is that Sakura?
***Her hair is on fire.***
***She has a good point about 100% off being bad for buisness.***
Is this what they call perfection.
***I love it?***
Oh my gosh...
Oh my gosh.
That's really solid.
Who's this character?
Love. It.
Messy eater Miku is kinda cursed.
Then the 2 X chromosomes would've made sense.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Regardless.
Painfully in character.
That's...
I might need translations.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I still love Shem-Ha Zett.
*Salamance colors.* Top-tier colors.
Huh.
Baby.
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Someone please ping me next time their works are posted.
There's something about it that's so appealing to me.
Also man. I love Namrute's style.
Why is she lost?
Ah.
What show?
Love.
Santa is what?
Wait.
Miku looks beautiful in turquoise honestly.
She has so much class.
Or that it made them play instruments.
I just didn't know the name itself.
Honestly I knew about the BanG collab.
Oh wait nevermind.
I didn't know about this.
Wait.
SPEAR. SPEAR. **SPEAR.**
Ahhhh!
Lovely.
I feel personally attacked by this image.
Laura.
It's finally here!

She's playing angry birds.
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
These mock-ups are way too cool. Unsure practical though.
https://twitter.com/ban06/status/736448807676698624?s=21
https://twitter.com/ban06/status/790074831244976128?s=21
Gotcha'. Thank you for the clarification!
Ahhhh.
I'm curious if something is going on or it's just a coincidence haha.
The Eva posting in general yeah.
Is something going on that I don't know about for this trend?
That's all I got.
I've seen this scenario before and it helps heavily when you tell staff regardless of how new you are to a server.
What Fenny said.
I can't say for every server but there's a chance they'll consider your fresh point of view.
I'm with Fenny.
Is it possible to tell the server staff about this feeling?
Congrats! Happy to hear that they understand.
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
I kinda rarely talk in this chat but I feel like given the circumstances with the post I'm sorry you all have to worry about Gwen. I haven't known them much but I can tell they mean a lot to all of you as friends.
*Hugs.* For Shizuku.
There there.
Because sadly if you try to be a decent person and improve people hate that.
I'm not too keen on the mentality with the term and how it's used now.
Please Ohio.
This is good.
Same.
Oh thank goodness that's a relief.
You mean this, Kat?
https://twitter.com/cnn/status/1325112684644347904?s=21
May he rest in peace.
Yes I think.
https://twitter.com/abc7newsbayarea/status/1325226554209734657
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I kinda have my own stance on this? It's okay to look up to people's positive traits and be influenced to only an extent and not to the point where you're not being yourself if that makes sense.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
🫂
My condolences, Pharios. I'm sorry to hear that.
So you're unsure why you're not trying to solve your issues? I'm trying to understand more.
Oh wait I have a third one.
Gotcha', I appreciate your response, thanks Shemmy!
1. How do poly marriages operate out of curiosity? Since that kinda suddenly came to mind.

2. For poly it's not just 3 people right? It's possible for 4+ too. (I assume yes I'm just making sure).
I actually have some questions if you don't mind me asking?
Yooo!
I'm gonna' be 21 at the end of this year and I still feel like I'm mentally a child.
~~Would 20?~~
I think I have complex feelings with that situation honestly.
I kinda was always on the thought of sticking around people who are 0-3/4 years different from you age wise at maximum. But I don't think everyone would agree with me.
Not really exclusive to one group.
That's a label of its own.
I'd believe it.
I'd joke in response to that but this is serious discussion and I'd be self deprecating.
Yeah...
I was wanting to bring that up but I appreciate that you said it.
If they're happy, I'm happy.
That's all that matters to me personally.
I guess about how there's not really one way to be in a relationship. And it's starting to be more accepted publicly now I guess. Is that the right choice of words? Correct me if they aren't.
It does kinda remind me about something though.
That sounds fair.
I do think I enjoy learning about this stuff though.
I just suck at talking.
Admittedly I've never been in a relationship at all currently so I dunno.
That's... Peculiar.
That's true. My bad.
What are stereotypes for polyships out of curiosity? Outside of I assume one getting jealous about the other member's dynamics.
That's kinda like, inevitable I think? If you have attractions that is.
Honestly I think it's fine to find other people attractive even if you settle into a relationship.
Again, I appreciate this, it's informative.
Interesting.
3. How does one establish or form a poly relationship? Like, is it similar to mono where you just both agree with asking? Or is it possible for another person to be a part of this relationship or is more of like, super situational and different for everyone's circumstances and stuff.
I just don't talk to anyone that is.
Me neither.
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I'll have to sleep soon but I found this conversation genuinely delightful. Thank you for sharing this stuff! It was educational and informative.
Agreed.
There isn't one answer or one thing.
I find the complexities interesting honestly.
That or just more confident so I guess fake mature.
I think a lot of people younger than me are a lot more mature.
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Huh.
Doesn't proffessor Layton have an anime series?
Not like, actually noir but ya' know.
Cowboy Bebop would be a neat choice yeah.
But I'm unsure if I'd be my thing.
Oh and the gear comparisons are 90% of what I hear with it.
I mean like, I don't really know much about it except a lead using Gungnir or something. But aside from that I haven't heard much in idea or something.
What's it about?
Lupin is getting the movie so that may help?
I'm not certain.
Haven't seen but I heard it's one of Gen's stronger work?
Oh yeahhhhh, that's a show.
Is the series bombastic at least?
From what I remember zls was neat.
Yeah.
Like Rider and Sentai. Meanwhile One piece is one story still going. Same for DBZ ish in the sense of the same cast.
I mean since it does the yearly new season schtick.
Since that's gonna' go on forever I guess.
Curious how successful Precure is.
And movies and stuff.
Also they could always remake I guess.
Don't they own Sailor?
Toei is successful with other stuff. Just not internally.
I mean...
Wait what's this?
I see.
I want to also bring up the whole he doesn't view guilty pleasures a thing. Which tbh I kinda started following as a mentality after a while.
ANYWAYS!
What is citrus about?
Don't know much about it though.
I knkw a fella' who unironically liked Citrus flaws and all or something.
Ya' know.
I get why it shut down but...
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
It was the *only* thing I was there for the release.
I'm still bummed about the app.
Been busy and I guess not in the mood especially since it's kinda more slower in nature. It's both refreshing but a bit of a struggle for me. Definitely interesting though given its situation.
I've seen a bit of Kuuga but not as far as I want to yet.
And not international which is a shame.
Since I think it's more of america available.
Oh I think the US.
What device do you have?
Oh wait nevermind.
Captain Holt and stuff. I dunno.
Since automatically I'm thinking Brooklyn 99.
Anime or in general?
Is it good that I view it as exclusively a relationship then?
Says to the other they're happy they were ever born.
**Just friends, guys.**
Offer a ring to the other.
I just look for whatever relationship I find cute.
I dunno.
Tfw your girlfriend is necessary for you to find self-worth for once and actually have personal desires.
Their child or something.
Make them combine into a Mecha using their gear.
I'd risk hugging god possessing my significant other in other to save them.
**Friends forever.**
Not friends for life.
Nah.
Best couple.
It was the most romantic thing it hurts.
You're making me cry about that song again.
True.
I think you're right.
Honestly given how College takes up so much time...
Sounds neat.
I'd watch a college anime.
I'll zip my mouth.
My bad, Raine.
Is it weird to just assume because pedophiles?
You're not wrong.
Not sure if this is the appropriate choice of words but Hibiki always is kinda given the vibe of the ""man"" of the relationship?
She's a neat character based on the description.
<https://twitter.com/KanadeAmo/status/1314175519378812929>
I think I have it saved.
I swear I've seen fan art of a biological daughter of the two.
Is that like, a legitimate development right now?
I've been curious about that.
I've seen stuff like Hibiki and Miku having a child togethe-
Oh wait adoption.
This does remind me of a thing I've always wondered how.
Maybe it's something like the sun or photons or whatever.
This does remind me I question how Ultras procreate.
That's an image I don't need tbh.
Hello!
And you're okay to feel that way.
I'm mixed on it but half the reason is a weird scenario for me to apply because normally I'm one who believes in seperating the creator and the work.
That was probably it.
Or something, I'm still surprised.
Since like, apparently they made a legitimate dub for a show that they were paid to do.
When you look at it.
Like, it's weird they formed a buisness.
But the early stuff is DEFINITELY dated.
Some people I know just aren't big on abridged stuff at all with valid reasons.
It's just a parody.
Nah that's totally fine.
Nah.
I sometimes listen to their podcasts if it's on material I'm big on.
The shorts are cute yeah.
TFS I mean.
I thought they did it because they wanted to end it on a good note?
I low-key never intentionally recommended because I don't think the people I'd share it to would be into it.
I jumbled up the wording.
Since it's recommending something you think they would like. Not something you want to share purely because it's your favorite.
I think I'm bigger on the idea of sharing what would make the other person click with it.
But they never fight him.
How did the movie end since all I remember was Hitler being there.
I seriously don't remember how the original anime ended. Or the movie I mean.
I think I should clarify I only saw the original version and not brotherhood.
Since even though I finished the anime it wasn't too much into it I think? I only finished because it was a light consumption.
I'm not certain admittedly.
I think that's why I heard people don't complain about the horror fandom despite it has questionable people.
You're able to share reasons and stuff more since it's with people you know and stuff.
Since friend groups also kinda have the uh, multiple interests sorta aspect?
Also that is true Solo.
It's because there's enough people yeah.
But that sounds concerning.
I have never seen his fanbase.
Me with power rangers.
Especially with things I'm not big on or haven't seen just to see a point of view.
Like, if they're sharing from the heart or something what they like I'd be into hearing it.
Depends on how it's worded/shared imo.
Or the greats everyone talks about.
Makes you feel like you're mentally worse/less valid because you like something that isn't the heat peak or whatever.
Always thought it was the opposite.
Which isn't the case often but ya' know.
Though at the same time I half get it if it's from someone with genuine reasonsm
Yeah not big on that.
This reminds me that Eizouken completely fell off the grid after it finished.
So talk about what stays with you.
Because this is a bit of just my philosophy I don't think anything is perfect, stuff is flawed it's more about what resonates and stays with you the most.
That's better than following like a sheep tbf.
I like sharing info that may intrigue them. Like I unintentionally shared something I thought was interesting that a friend would be intrigued on with a show.
Bebop was very westerny yes.
Been meaning to try those.
When I think of good dubs I instantly think of either Bebop or Ghost stories depending on what type of "good".
Huh, Gunbuster is 1988.
I see.
Oh my.
Oooh.
I know this doesn't apply to every show but if the long ones have dubs they're way easier for me to watch.
Depends on the thing honestly.
I've been half tempted to get into the Mecha genre more so I guess what are some neat series that are easy to get into? Since I've been half tempted to watch Getter and possibly OG Gundam (plus a few more but I dunno)?
Thanks you two! I appreciate it.
Alright, made the list.
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I like how all the components are kinda unrelated things.
Don't know why I keep forgetting.
I've been tempted to see Gaogaigar.
What the...
Is it wrong I haven't heard of those until now?
Was my first time seeing his directing yeah.
Even though Eva is on my list. Same for Shin Ultra when it comes out.
Sadly I haven't seen much of Anno's work.
That was a concerning thing to learn.
Yeahhhhh.
Woah, it was directed by Anno?
Interesting.
Nevermind found out. Was something about Armageddon vs. og Getter.
Wait.
Interesting.
Ahhhhhhh. Sounds like an experimental pilot episode.
That bad or just oddly placed?
Like, no continuity stuff?
Out of all the ones suggested and things I don't need to worry about some previous work or whatever right?
Small question.
Interesting.
That is the most accurate thing I've heard.
Because wasn't Brave an attempt to continue making transformation toyline stuff for Takara?
I've been partly intrigued into getting into Brave stuff since I'm a Transformers fan?
Those are the two I hear the most about.
Since I remember seeing the first episode and it was gonna' have the lead bot's memories be erased.
Isn't J-decker the one that applies the question of machines with thoughts or something?
Mainly in thematics? Not sure how true it is though.
I heard J-decker is good.
Fixated?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I've always found that cute. Especially if it's like, openly admitted.
Do the Monsters live up to the name?
What is the show about? Aside from yuri and mythical weapons.
Which it isn't even the first to do.
Madoka is just a grim dark angle of MG.
Not sure what to describe BNA.
I heard someone describe the MG aspects being more of subtext?
Yeah that's why I wasn't sure if I wanted to say it or not.
For some reason Klk also comes to mind but that's kinda a different rabbit hole entirely. And arguably not MG?
Closed I've heard is Nanoha but I don't know how true it is.
I heard Rayearth is a bit tech like? Unsure how true it is.
Oh yeah.
Pretear I saw and it feels very top left.
Trying to think.
I ||need to see it still.||
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/697237512237875243/768950765016317962/Screen_Shot_2020-10-22_at_4.35.30_PM.png
I wish I could use the emote here.
The only relevant character is Kerochan anyways.
Because I heard Tomoyo has shown feelings for her.
Goodness if it wasn't for the fact that they're cousins I think I'd be down to pairing them.
Wow both of the jokes I wanted to say I think would be a definite no.
What if...
Oh and instead of transforming she switches into real outfits.
Where they're willing to pair a lot.
I mainly know that it kinda follows a lot of Clamp's things?
Goodness I've heard things about that show.
Probs.
I think? The ones I saw are light-hearted.
In feel.
It's not on there. But it's more top left yeah.
I should really try more Cure.
I'm saving this.
Heartcatch is catching my interest.
I'm caught up with Healin' Good and taking a break from Star Twinkle.
Heartcatch Precure is neat.
I've officially started Heartcatch.
He traded my exact opinion on Micchy.
I think that's when I started loving Taka.
I did like when they talked.
As well as say he shouldn't write again.
I do kinda hate how some people think he ruined Rider and other stuff.
And also they did a p unique thing with the whole disguised rider thing with the two brothers.
Like stuff such as Kaito's upgrade was in response to popularity.
You can tell he was really trying his best to adapt.
You're more of watching 24 hour long episodes which is the normal length of Nakashima's works.
The thing with Fourze is that it's 48 episodes but exclusively 2 parters.
And Gaim is like, 47 episodes.
Which is a problem since imo Gen works better with shorter shows.
Also they wanted to drop the 2-parter format.
Like actor availability and things.
But the toyeticness and other factors with production probably limited him a lot.
They hired him because they wanted to change things up so they got a manga writer.
I think I heard something about Gaim being limited for him.
Iirc he was planning for there to be a sequel to Rebellion which never happened.
Psycho pass.
But none are like, my favorites.
I think he's a genuinely good writer and all the things I saw that he wrote I liked.
Honestly I wish I clicked with Gen more than I do.
Making him actually immature.
Micchy is basically that one kid who thinks he's mature.
I do want to read up the allusions.
I sorta knew but I let the show speak it for me I guess if that makes sense?
So I felt PAIN.
He was my favorite at the start.
He did his job amazingly for me in the sense of how I was supposed to feel.
(I think Micchy is a well written character btw. I just didn't like him going corrupt but in like, a good way I guess?)
I'm trying to watch the original before I see the anime. But I'm definitely interested.
Nana Mizuki is good at her job. I keep forgetting I'm hearing her voice.
Heartcatch is fun.
Wait is that a dog?
My only other assumption is they're the same world but aside from those scenes they're completely unrelated stories.
It could be a little nod or something. Or reusing character designs?
Is it me or is that artstyle kinda charming/appealing? (11 and W).
Like Kirameiger I guess.
I enjoy it in the sense of just a weekly thing, I dunno, it's weird.
Admittedly that's my first one.
Finally gonna' see my first season baton pass.
Here we go!
https://twitter.com/precuredolphin/status/1332160283997995013
OHHHHH.
Oh you mean Go go right?
https://c.tenor.com/t3_nxEQSB90AAAAM/heartcatch-precure-precure.gif
Tsubomi is awesome.
Eyyy, Heartcatch. I'm currently on that one.
Are we talking Precure?
Just curious though, Millh, Illindus, and ZX Chronicle, what are your favorite seasons?
Hinata is probably my second favorite.
https://c.tenor.com/XnTSgMaMkrIAAAAM/hanadera-nodoka-precure.gif
Also if there's at least one thing I can say I got from HG is this gif.
Now I'm an MG fan.
My friend got me into the hole.
But yeah, I agree with you on that.
Unless it's done in a creative way.
I prefer interesting stuff with new ideas and not dedicated to the past. (Ultraman's biggest gripe for me).
The word intro is weird.
It's written in a more disposable manner.
But I dunno. I do feel like it's not something I'm gonna' rewatch however.
I think it's really a thing I'm neutral on tbh.
They're more of huh this is neat and cute and things. I dunno.
Anyways I think most of the reasons I'm not bothered are just since it's my intro if you get me? I don't want to invalidate your stance.
Just in case someone wants evidence/info.
https://twitter.com/precuredolphin/status/1324930948169781248
46 total.
They already have the Episode number.
Oh yeah definitely.
I assumed it was because of Asumi's transformation sequence.
Given the pandemic and all.

But anyways that's fair, Illindus.
It's kinda weird to think it came out this year.
I'm enjoying that one so far.
The power of Dragonball.
Been interested in trying Futari.
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
I think I found out early on and found that a funny coincidence since that was when I was first getting into Gear.
Precure club! Precure club!
At least they understood the right spot.
Wait where's Chris?
Dedede?
Is that...
Woooot! Dynazemon.
I like her already.
What does she do
Oh yeahhhhh, I think I was recommended it.
Gunbuster?
I can't believe Eevee is here.
I'm slowly watching Heartcatch.
Informative.
IT'S GEN UROBUCHI'S BIRTHDAY!
GREEEEN.
Hold on I'm intrigued.
I just finished the Ultraman Netflix anime series. I really enjoyed it.
I think I have weird split feelings even though I still greatly consider Rebellion interesting.
I think I agree. Especially if you end up preferring the conclusion of the show.
I legit never saw the recap films. Only Rebellion.
I keep hearing stuff about it.
Like it's the current big thing?
Chris?
Who'd be Optimus Prime.
**Remember when Optimus used the reqium blaster for the first time to shoot at the ocean?**
Mainly since it was a space opera with alien robots.
Cybertron is kinda that one cheesy action series I enjoyed.
Whale?
DestroNoise.
Man I really need to start Wonder Egg Priority.
Tbh, I'm tempted to finally start wonder egg priority tomarrow.
Iirc it's tied with the idea of hormones.
I think I'm finally gonna' watch Wonder Egg priority today.
Basically just start any season or so. Unless it's Gogo season 2 or Max Heart.
They're all standalone and basically do the sentai esque schtick of only do crossovers in special episodes and movies.
What Ardania said.
I relate with that, Copper.
There's a couple of merch I low-key don't want to get since I'm embarrassed about it.
Mine is mainly learning the real world and biology/mythology. It's kinda a jump start for me to learn.
My dad knows I like Pokémon but I don't think he gets why it's appealing to me.
So not really tied to majority of my backlog of passions. (Which can also be educational but not really the same style).
The only one who probably watches animation is my mom but more of educational simpler ones.
My issue is my family has no care for animation.
*I just hide what I watch and hope no one sees.*
And was bothered by everyone loving it or something.
I know a guy who almost quit Yu-gi-oh purely because of Arc-V.
Wait isn't Arc-V the one where they tried to do false depth by presenting war to children or something?
That's a valid reason.
Is there a reason you like it?
*Symphogear.*
It's one of those things I try to avoid as much as I but willing to overlook if the substance or story I like. But then have this complex feeling of "why do I like this thing?"
Man. I have a complex relationship with fan-service.
What's up with Gatari?
They killed her off due to all the power.
:(
Please say no-
Is the one next to Kanade dead?
I believe so.
I literally only learned about it because of Hatsune Miku.
***Also give them coffee.***
PLEASE.
YES.
It had papaya laser eyes
Was neat.
I saw the first episode.
Gotcha'.
Fmp as in Full metal panic or...
Weird. Since it works for me still.
Well dang. Crunchy is really promoting this show
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MYZlI3Hj5Eg
Or just equally prominent to another character.
Wait for before was it like, lead lead main focus protag or?
Has there been female Gundam Protags? Asking as someone who never watched Gundam.
I jokingly want to avoid Seed.
I need more suplexes.
I was just surprised how keen I got after the first fight.
(I didn't see Episode 2 yet hehe)
I'm excited for Sangou.
Oh my frog yes!
Frontier's english dub opening is top-tier. **I won't hear otherwise.** /joke.
I heard the One Piece manga despite the length is pretty easy to read through.
It's more western superhero I think? But sticks with the kill monsters philosophy and makes that a major topic if not one of the main. So I guess if you're interested in that topic and also fine with certain content then maybe you can look into it.
Hm, I think it ultimately depends. It's an adaption of a Seinen Manga that was about the original Ultraman host's son but it's kinda done in a way where everything relevant to the narrative is presented in the show.
Ahhhhhhh.
I did! How come you ask? (Also pardon the ping).
Madoka is neat. I think grew more appreciative of it after digging more into Magical Girl as a whole.
I would've said a joke involving ||Mami but not the head|| but I'll refrain in respect.
That's a bit disrespectful imo.
I think the film gave me more of what I expected the show to be like?
I have weird feelings on Madoka.
Oh yeah we're getting the world ends with you.
That's just a combo I'm super into.
Maybe I'll check out this season.
I'm down.
👀
Yo steampunk anime?
Sango is precious.
I love that thing.
Also there's this if it's allowed to be posted.
I need to keep up with ZLS.
Dang I missed the Trigger show discussion.
I'll probably look into it.
Ooh gotcha' gotcha'.
I swear I heard there was an Asimov story that did something like that.
Does it have anything unique to itself? Like its identity hook.
Admittedly I just wanted to try the new series, maybe a few others I was interested in. And then just... Dip out. 😅
Finally I don't need to worry about continuity.
Quick question. I'm not someone who typically cares about finding the "good entry point into a franchise" since I'll just go for what I'm interested in anyways. But I'm curious to hear thoughts on Witch from mercury so far and if I should check it out.
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Huh.
👍
