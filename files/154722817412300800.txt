I have calmed
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
One idea I will put forth, make le  fay call jessika "child", young lady is very famirial feeling.
Though tbf it is 4am nearly
That does feel tighter.
The line you wrote comes of as nearly Q from James bond, add a small amount of sardonic amd it will make her stand out.
I mean tbvh this and what I suggested have the same end result, plus it kinda lampshades the whole magical girl outfit protection thing. Cuase if the armour is all a flight of fancy then she would still question why bother at all.
So, what do you guys think of this line: "Young lady, you're a magical girl.  Your armor is formed from magic.  There is no reason to shirk on protection simply because you want to look cool."
But I was trying to say that while jessika would totes be behind it, how would mprgan feel about it?
Yeah
That would add comedy to the scene.
I know but Morgan la Fey would very much be critising her decision, and would ask her to at least do it right.
Kings don't have to wear armour
Also one thing you need to do is work on decluttering your paragraphs. You use a lot of short sentences and have redundancies.
But if you are going tondo it, do it right.
Ah yeah she would probably comment as to why she is bothering to wear armout at all, considering her lack of fighting experience and that using ice in walls would be far more armour than simple plate.
If she is apeing him badly he will chastise her.
Yep, so she isn't covering herself like she's actually a knight
Hmm, so she has a quick flash of his armour and bases it of that OK so in that context you'd be fine if she had only done the parts thag look cool. I.e helm and cuirass

What typos

If she was classically speaking, she would technically be right
Still girl, but with armour.
Aye
Saber is a nice "magical sword girl"

ahe likes the idea and sees it as a way of creating a bugeoning of apprentices
considering the  historical suspicion of witches and the like
Maybe go down the line of thought that she sees it as a way of increasing the popularity of magic.
sterile
I just think it's too serile

I'd say keep it to callsigns in ship names on the ground maybe
should be fine
this can vary in different company
I.E. A calls B Mike and C calls B  Michial
As long as they are consistant between characters
this talk gives me an idea for something
barely remember much at all
need to go back and read that again
I loved that concept
it would probably have a locally held copy in a database on the colony or base in question and a centralised master copy on a hub network more secure elsewhere
^
I look forward to reading it O7
Hell all my insurance has a digital signature
all od that would be digital TBH
I'd say it could work in certain situation say if there is a technological menace that can hack anything I.E Cylons or replicators, but I think NDA's would be technical
Looking forward to it

The information is vital for the readers but not the pilots
Absolutly giant tits

SAKI PLS
in the first part
it feels like it is redundant information
something about this bothers me
‚ÄúThe test site is fifty kilometers away from the Wild Whirlwind,‚Äù said the representative over the broadcast comm channel.  ‚ÄúThe test will be executed like an interception, with the Archangels first intercepting the Virtues and then vice versa.  Confirmed?‚Äù
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
no
and the start up routine is almost that magic spell which allows her to get in the zone.
It's a nice way to show that she is very attached to her craft
no you don't
I think my issue was equationg training to action in that sentence
try something like that
like the only action she's seen was the counter attack on the priates, other than that all she'd done was train
`In the past five months since the battle over Elyssia, the only action she‚Äôd seen was training and Harpy Squadron leading an attack against the very same pirates that had attacked the colony.`

something about this line feels off
better word
yeah
I like that you made sure tests had specifications

Ark Royal Munitions.
nothing super stand out
and Empress, while impetuous, does tend towards good ideas for commands
 try 
Sapphire while Empress ,who can be impetuous, does tend towards good ideas for commands
parsing
change and to while or something
‚ÄúSquall and Empress will be flying the Virtues,‚Äù the flight lead said.  ‚ÄúSquall needs to learn how to fly with someone not Sapphire and Empress

Not bad additions
sorry went for the toilet
I thinlk you are doing good
implying they have a good level of observance on board
if you feel you need to reference it you could add a throw away line from the representative that all instruments are showing green or somethibg
the gun pods are important
what I mean is you don't need to explicitly state it unless it is important later.
showing whjat the wearer is looking at
No I know what you meant like Go-pros
I.E. some sort of issue with the connection or a lost feed after a manuver
helmet cams would be fine, but it's better to only talk about them when relevant
sorry by face cams I am thinking of typical mecha show shenanigans where they have the pilots faces popup next to eachother for reasons
want to be drunk though
sober... just tired
pilot error or control malfunction.
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>

I have another Nanoha figure but she is still in the box
shame I forever associate that character with a superfan who drove me to find the character insufferable
it'sm a great figure
that yukari figure has her 7.5cm shell included
still salty about that Jousuke figure
I gave up on male figures cause they kept disapearing in the post
here is the other shelves

Maria would probably go for adoption as she herself is an orphan

There seems to be no lack of orphans
They could just adopt a child
Coolio by me
If the children produced are healthy and viable
And no
You can achieve the same technique with skincells
This line of research is cool but it is the definition of science babies

If eggs could fertilise each other, when a woman ovulates 2 or more eggs she would end up pregnant

<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
Look when an entire political part is basically branded as anti-semites becuse mwmbers are pro isreal and decry your countries massively one sided war with Hamas. There is an issue here.
I mean dropping airstrikes into population centres cause you suspect people who kight be terrorits and in that vague area is a pretty blatant case of fuck it.
Trust me, when border guards start shooting marked aidworkers I begin to damn well listen.
Look don't get me started on my opinion of the chinese government, we will be here all week, and I have not many nice things about the american one on that front as well.
I mean in my case it is a joke, and TBVH I have had the Pro-isreal side beaten out of me in the last 5 years by reports that keep coming out.
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE WEATHER...!
Don't mind me I am gonna curl into a ball as I just made an argument that draws parallel with a conspiritard.
Yeah
So positive messages
Shame the guy who runs almost all of the press outlets is a Zionist
I feel like it should be uncountried soon.
Ha
Even f it critisim of a country that is edging ever closer to genocide
This shit has been going on for years, and people know tow to the jewish crowd because having parallels drawn with being a Nazis still holds wieght,
You know that anti semitism row in Labour... that is almoust exclusively about critisim of isreal killing Palestinians
Ha you think this is "allowed", this is them being required in order to be seen as anti-semetic.
yeah this went down hill quick
woah Hazel please
Kiri please
please can we calm down.
that shit suggests it may be more of a one-sided conflict now
I have, and even if he says it is a two sided war, the slow expansion of isreal, the fact that Palestinians  are treated as second class citizens in isreal itself and the use of acute force against civilians and aid workers.
this isn't the first, or the first dozen times this shit has happened.
Kanade, this whole argument started over the fact an airstrike killed people and the BBC was ordered to change a headline to make it less like Isreal was at fault.
I kinda tapped out a while ago
I have travel to do, goof luck everyone.
I agree with that

I'm having a laugh but it'll get you in trouble if you are not careful
yorin that is sexist, please stop

Oh man no deal brexit is what a lot of these chucklefucks are aiming for
we are gonna get a shoddy deal either way cause no brexit at all is the only way to leave this unscathed
TBVH
"njo we don't"
"yes we like it"
Even then a say on the final deal would be
I see you point but I have very very strong opinions it should never have even been considered and I still want a say on the final deal.
the logic isn't there
I mean... if you think brexit shouldn't happen vote for a chance to recind it, but don't say you are not interested in not influencing a deal  that could  cause a lot of problems for you cause uyou are lazy.
NGL if they disagree on that principle they should be removed from the voting pool

More idiots in the final disagree than I like
<:DMJii:458047433067200512>

This current job is   causing my mind to go faster down the hole than that job ever did.
The slow workers who could do 3 hours of  work  a shift
The petty arguments and childishness
I miss the stress of having to juggle 30 things at once
So... took a week of being an untrained agency worker to make me look at my old job lovingly
so to speak#
you are partners, they become your issues
I see my error
sorry too far maybe
I have a no fighting rule
I would never advocate actual violence merely suggest some bitch needs to be bodied into getting proper help
He needs someone who gonna sock him and then drag his arse to a professional
can't even internalise the hate properly
Yep, sounds like a bitter vapid twat.
well fuck him you are not long for uni right?

well it certainly is helping me back into that mindset
just I'd rather starve than do this for 12-14 more days
in talks with 3 companies over something better
\o/
unless your managers a twat or you find something better
If you have co-workers who talk to you and time to sit down during your day keep at it.
I've done 5 13 hour shifts in a lab in a row without seating and I was tired but stable
I have worked some ass jobs in my time but the monotony of this takes the damned cake
trust me I am nearly done
if ya couldn't tell I am slowly losibng my mind over the last few days

Her friend of 7 years
So one thing leads to another me a friend hit it off and we end up cuddling and kissing while waiting for her
So impassioned I was she burst into tears and sodded back off to the bathroom leaving ke and best friend alone
Then it is my turn to speel how great she is and all that jazz, how she can be awesome
Said husband calls to check in her and she is fine.
She turns up finally and we begin doing everything in our power to alay her fears that crush hates her while avoiding too intently pointing out she has a husband
We check if she is ok and everything see said she is fine so my and best friend settle down and begin drinking and chatting about how to cheer her up.
For 30 mins
She goes to the bathroom and disappears
We drag her home, and we get settled in
Devout Muslims don't stay with women who are unmarried overnight, after all
Crush goes home
And we all leave to get drinks as this drama caused us to miss out on the casino
So we get them to talk I give the guy some pointers on kindness over honesty
We will get to thay
Oh yus wait for that
But we iron it out establish that everyone loves her and her insecurity is silly
Best friend is upset and has things going on... :see last night:
She is going on about how crush is more into best friwnd than her
Catch her calm her down and I finally get to talk to her
So we pay and leave
Walking out and crying
this ends with her throwing her second strop of the night
So we do a couple more rounds and crushguy is running scared and is findimg any excuse to avoid her
So in other words doesn't understand women at all
Mind you he's 21, a devout muslim and not dealt with a woman other than his mother
She's  a big girl and dude is too honest
We calm her down
He says sometimes and she goes quiet and cries
We go a few rounds more and she asks her current crush if some of the not nice things he says to her are serious
I thought ok then
I did and she acts suprised
This is all fine until she asks me if I had a crush on mutual friend from uni back then,
So we go a few rounds and everyone get softballs except me because fuck it go big or go home
My red flag jumped up hard but you know bday girls wishes and all.
She decides to go truth or dare.
During our outing to a shisha bar, *her choice, she isn't paying*
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
*she's married but lets not let that get on the way*
Unfortunately this group happwns to contain her new crush who she wants to get with
We take her out, she is piled with gifts, multiple cakes and so many well wishes she can't keep up
So we take said friend out for her birthday, dragging a small group from across the country to see her
Well sit down kids cause this is a tale of how to be self centered
Well finally decided to cut a friend out of my life
Every week
Even if that is just a phone call
My goal is now is to enable them to have the positive impact they want, then to make sure it sticks
Though tbh I do feel a bit teary
Believe it or not
Ha it's fine emotional support is my existance irl
It's been a heavy night
Gonna take note
Thanks
or better
Until she is done
No tears

It's fine I will help her as ,uch as I can

<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
She said she had the same but couldn't act on it
Had a thing for her for years
No literally the person I fell for has been a peraon I've know for 3 years, we met over a mutuals friends bday. We've been flirty before  but this time we went aside started getting close and then we had a heart to hewrt about things. Turns out she has lympatic cancer near her heart and she is literally untreatable
Why do I always meet amazing people too late

I'd say that's a plus
Lost a ball of human cancer, gained a wonderful new friend
Had a wonderful train ride, we had luch saw her off ho,e and got on the train myself
We texted the husband that his princess is in another street and got on a bus
Me and BF both just shrugged
Went on and fucked off down the road
And hasn't had a significant other in a year
You know the one who pushed away the man she loved cause she didn't want to have him suffer watching her go
And she accused BF of always stealing the spotlight and all the guys she liked.
She blamed me for causing her problems in uni cause I didn't find her attractive and I only care about thing girls. *demomstratably false*
And it all boiled down to how we are all selfish cause me and BF liked eachother and kissed
Aabout how none of us care for her
And me: a guy who has no friends where I live, basically can't breathe wrong without being unemployed and basically got fired to be here this week.
Woe is me-ing to her best friend: who has a low chance to survive a year, has massive imsecurities about her body is unemployable bacuse she can't breathe well and has become anemic becuase she struggles to eat.
Now I need to write this dpwn
Oh now its just a vent
Woe is meing
From a woman who is married, has two guys on the side, has an aparment, huge friend circle that supports her and has a full time permanent employment
Que the most insulting, selfish tone deaf argument
Yes the idiot who doesn't answer her phone is complaining that a person who wants to contact her contacts someone he knows is next to her

"Why does my husband call you to check where we are."
We walk on talking randdomly when to the suprise of no one... and I am quoting.
Cue bitter looks and some comments
Husband calls BF and asks if everything is OK
We leave and move towards the road where husband has parked the car whensuddenly,
Cause he can wait till she is ready
Madam is ignoring husbands phone
Well we were supposed to leave at 1130 it is now 12
But it is enough to make me go for a very long piss to hide
This is only a few babies
We say she should do what is right for both of them and she get pissy cue dolly toss number 5
She switches gears suddenly and goes on about how she is going to distance herself from crush cause she is not good enough
Between this and the constant self depreciation I am worn out and am just wanting to go
While getting ready
Madam co,es back to this and then starts picking on this
Talking about the night before and I say I owe her for a meal so I will get her lunch
She goes and me and BF sit and chat
After a bit BF tell madam to go have her shower
so I face away and chat to madam binny as she continues to make many comments about how I wanna turn around and peak.
BF comes back and has forgotten her clothes
During this time I am reading manga and BF has gone for a shower
12 is fine this and that
She has a long convo about what time they are gonna meet and everything
During this time husband calls
I xome back up give BF the toast with a nasty glare from madam as she begins to wolf down her maccas, glarimg every bite for a bit till I started focusing on her
So I do the real thing and go get BF the toast
Bint belays that and orders macca breakfast, which basically leaves friend out of luck and me with hot chocolate
I ask for team and BF asks for toast to help settle her stomache
Bint asks us if we want anything from down stairs
So she is hungover puking and wobbly
BF is hung over and has many medical conditions that mean even a light amout of alchohol hirts and we could not go light
To help the others get up
So finally 6am calm falls on the room and I get 2 hours sleep before I wake up
With my travel bag as a pillow
And sleep on the floor
I come back and decide fuck it one I will not be another issue in this bints life
I say good night go for the toilet while BF gets changed and gets into the bed with Madam
We shrug
No we finally get her calmed down and go upstairs to find madam selfdepreciation lying against a wall hogging all the blankets and all the pillows
So we head inside, I pull aside BF and spend 20mins with BF balling her eyes out into my shoulder about her medical condition and how she just wants to leave happy people behind. Bearing in mind I have mnown this wpman a total of 24 hours in my life and selfish bint just ignored her in tears. You'd think she'd come have a look at least.
The constant comparison to BF finally causes BF to get upset
We go outside a bit drunk by this point, we talk about her crush and how he seems to like BF more *he doesn't, she intimidates him for so,e treason* and all the insecurities we just spent 5 hours covering and telling her they ain't a big deal
So what more can we do
BF tells her everything and I am only her friend when she is upset
We get beratted for not including her in our issues
Durimg this time I have exposed a few of my issues and BF re affirmed a few of hers
We go on for 50 mins more until the nieghbour knocks and asks us to quieten down
Gets a little pissy but we confirm that we are still wanting to help her and split up and put her between us
And we are on good terms
So she notices that mw and friend are cuddling
Yeah
And for some reason came back
Talk about how she just spent the entire time talking to Ex-sama a man who also adores her snd she wrecked hard
She comes back an hour later smiling
I feel like an exhibitionist streaking a super bowl
thanks
that was the last straw
Well miss emotional tick is outta my life
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
AND i JUST HAD THE SINGLE MOST SATISFYING 50SECOND CONVERSATION IN MY LIFE
just to confirm she was fine
not doing this shit, if she is serious she will be locked up if not I swear i am not going to know who she is let alone talk to her.
TBH I am more annoyed than worried
I called a mutual friendand they are dealing with it
I will be don't worry
she has people who live next to her
then she called me for real
then she called me on whatsapp
she's threatening to kill herself
well so I just got amessage
Nani sore
No that is pretty shitty
Or eyes
And is not fit for human ears
That would be a story to rival a song of fire and ice if the main character was helen of fucking troy
This isn't the worst one
And no
I had 3 like this
This is only one "friend"
Oh yus
That's why it exists
That marriage cert is the only thing holding him in the UK
Kerrik
Exactly yorin
But he lives with Madam
rip girlbot
well TBH twats are gonna be twats
He lied
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
the rest of them are being very lax
he's not being strict#
back in my day phones were collected and held
TBH I am suprised they allowed you to keep your phones at all
doesn't matter it'd require everyone to have their phones checked
depending on what you do you could even have multilpe files
I mean it is not hard  to rename a file and have a cheat list recorded by you for that purpose
is it time to kill the moon?
Happy birthday
can I say though that fame is the best frame they could have picked
Fucking moron
Good
Trust me throw your vote for the lesser evil at this point
Awful man
He just went full counter offensive on a relatively small group of people calling him out for saying something fucked up. This whole thing is to he frank a minor incident that would have been solved with a proper apology and a little tlc.
So it's not like he did not know
It's funny cause he got in the case of someone a couple years ago for being homophobic during a fight
My biggest problem is he came out swinging
I kinda just feel his best bet would have been to just shut up, let the fire burn out and then address the issue in a couple days
the argument that "I am not that sort of person" doesn't hold water.
He fucked up
LMAO
those tweets were of a 12 year old.

Sadly it is very much possible for 4 more years of trump
A revolution either requires a vast  majority or a specialised minority.

Oh fuck the Trump admin up the arse.
but I did work hard as part of a small team to get a stupid amount of work done at double time

If you use anti bacterial hand sanitizer before you eat.
There really is no way to counter it the fecal matter literally can travel through the air, a once a day clean should be mandatory anyway. But short of wiping it down before you use it there is really nothing you can do, and even if you did the moment you touch some thing else.

Election fraud needs to a more serious response, seen far too much dodgy shit in the last couple years
Haven't missed an election I could vote in since 18
and a few move up to calais and provide nice photo's for the daily mail to flaunt
I can see why, plus that gives them a lot of county to get lost in
I guessed
such as India and Pakistan
honestly same in a lot of cases, most of our non-EU migration comes from former territories
Yeah my mum voted yes, and no word of a lie believes that a fall back 40years is what this country needs, no foreigners, no muslims just peaceful white people or some shit
but in those places they advocate policies to hurt the migrants not make it unattractive to live there for everyone, ya know competent racists
I know
like leaving the EU is not going to hurt the brown people, any more than it is going to hurt you.
plus Xenophobia in this country is damn insane in some quarters
pretty much
it was an ill-advised, ill-ran, corruption riddled mess. right from the start.
TBH the whole thing was a massive farce
I live in a country where the government is trying to cripple itself over not leaving the EU and the EU is offering every olive branch it can
funny thing
Funny thing governement

Honestly suprised we haven't buit a wall to go with our oversized moat
So jobs can keep paying peanuts and have a high staff turnover
But that doesn't prevent people getting jobs it just allows wage suppersion
Actually the glut of cheap labour is a reality
Well it's the issue we've been overfocusing on for years

Migrants out is the most hilarious stance because the most visible and hated migrants are the ones who are not affected
Yeah you could write an essay for each viewpoint but still lack the nuance
Oh yeet
From my observation, so far there are:
Blind remainers: who just think the leavers are all racist
Educated remainers: who see the EU as an institution that is useful but has problems
Educated leavers: people who see oppitunities for themselves

People with mental disorders should be allowed to vote, because if they were bad off enough to not be able to vote, they would not be able too.
Agreed, but you can encourage people to actually question what the hell they are voting for in the first place. Christ over half the people who voted only had a vague idea of what the EU ws

If things go well we can finally achieve the promised land of looking like a baltic state

Brexit is almost garunteed to be partially about leaving money holes open
it's not just money though, it's also expensive dinners

500 years equivilent of negotiations, hundreds of standards, thousands of laws, dozens of projects and charities,  couple 100,000 people here and there all gone because of lies, misinformation and how easy people are to misdirect.
but no, Brexit means brexit and we wanna march through a minefeild layered with pigshit to prove that we are the bravest.
Show me the benefit or even a deal that isn'twhat we have with less say and I will go along with it.
No we ahould have the view that they were right and any resistance is heresy and the cuase of all the issues.
And the worst thing is the brexit party has no manifesto or real policy and it still got a third of the vote
our country has no consensus
it's nuts

Just hope our electorate isn't so enamoured by trumpian politics that they will fall for Boris'BS
An unelected PM who will try prorogue parliament at the behest of rich non-EU donors and racist brainlets
They know they are screwed in any election unless they can successfully gain back the hard brexit crazies
And neither does his party
I think he does not care
Batterning down and blaming the EU and remainers will keep him in no.10 till the next election cycle
I mean... doing something that is likely to destroy you would be stupidity
Calling an election will likely shatter the tories more than they already are.
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>  I am saying nothing

Just unattach your soul and take over a fresh body

I feel ill thinking about what will happen if the US deal just floods the market with US produce
Mine is basically facilitating current regulations on food and is already lean as hell, like being understaffed is normal.
Our one hope is that the queen dies, the country shuts down and we get invaded by aliens

LMAO you think I meant the rich
at least we can just eat those who starve first
Well

I hope every one of the working poor who voted tory starves on a cold street with a simply curacble disease

Proof that smearing your opponent, blaming voiceless targets and lying is the truest way to get success in government
My exact reaction

well when you dress up a man as satan any person who stands againt him seems a hero to the average blinkered person.
Tommy Robinson: Hold my stella.
My mum: no one in the Tories is anti-muslim
hahahahahahaaa
<:DISGUST:357027937855209472>
Anti-Islam activist ‚ÄòTommy Robinson‚Äô announces he's joined the Tories
This election was never about policy, it was about making small people feel comfortable with lies while selling everything that they hold dear to an olligarch.
Fuck shit up bad, get voted out, blame the new government for the mess you made
The ol' cons tactic
60 years of anti-communism and people being selfish

Lol
That os very classy
Oh my nostalgia
Next to purple heart
Put it in the deltof
I need one of these for the memes
Ouch
Wat?
Nanoyuuno could work but that dude has his library harem going on.
Look even I can see Nanofate for the quality ship it is.
what is a topic... when you have PC talk
``I wanna recline while I watch.`` My friend... you get me.
Masterani.me is better
who needs to relax when you can fight monsters and have a butthole so clenched it basically doesn't exist... Thanks Diablos.
cause consoles are actyually nice once in a while.
Amazon subs...

YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LISA!!!

Miss Rakhi, I need to go to the tooooooilet
pls calm down
Ma'am
mine turned into, I'd be unworthy anyway

DID SOMEONE SAY PALMO!?!
Also yurivampire? thing
Jingai San no Yome looks curious
That is so dumb I am so fucking sold
Conception is harem bait
Index 3 and jojo  5 makes me excited
SAO for your smugbait of the season
Defo
On the other hand I am 1000% OK with this
So unless you are a sucker for tanks and historical refernces to tanks the show will feel stretched
It's very much a shallow sports show
Though not until they fix the parts and FPE issue
and if you are feeling tank hungry you can always play wt with me afterwards
The heat death would hsppen sooner
Come now
Anzio ova is fun but that is all
Good order
No if anyone spoils I will be waiting after you die
Now about the battle...
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I agree
Oh ho
Oh man, I will need to be drunk as shit so I have an exchse to be emotional
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Episode 11 is where the show gets sexy

CCS is the classic
This show gets it.
Re:zero is the one you are looking for

Kumo is coming soon
what you gonna want
WN/LN adaptions
totes worth it
English title on crunchyroll
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime
and the very stylised UI elements for Great sage
I liked the abstraction of the slimes senses
Slime Isekai is pretty good so far
I will keep an eye on the channel

XP
yes chris
an hour
Fuck it time to reactivate hi-dive for OVAs
people are bastards
Got killed during a night mission
but not really too importamnt
it's a nice I see
Shinobu is so different  during the series
Kizu is best wherever you fancy TBH
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
generally a good idea to follow it
Airing order is here
https://www.reddit.com/r/araragi/comments/253p64/the_orders_to_monogatari_condensed_version/
Aye and it is fabulous
added to seasonal list
Props
Ankou dance was the best
and the ankou dance
Schools ship war
Survival war
Water war
gamnes
Scrmz went of to play maple story so me and bread went and played
we watched 4
oof
and that is a vital reason if any
I wanna get food in while we watch but I am going out afterwards
cause duck
Katsu
OK
What time we doing this?
You don't get called legendary
DENSETU NO YAMADA TAE!!!
The Expanse is the shit
^
Probably for the best
Derfilm is the best
well RIP simulwatch
lol so is anyone actually going to watch?
Bread can do it in a pinch
I'll ask bread in the mean time
I'd offer but my internet is special
https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1504/4722/products/asuna2.jpg?v=1476408974
even looking that makes me angry
has the chains and everything
Looks like Asuna from the worst arc of SAO
the thighs
Rikka
Join the cult of Akane
the fights currently feel repetitive
though you can tell it is a Trigger show
it is entertaining
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
More like "Kaaaaaaaaaaaaazuuuumaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Rikka is a wonderful character, she is everything you said but, Akane is a petty bitch and I think that is wonderful.
Akane is a petty bitch, and that is fantastic.
Awwww
Skipping this week then?

Believe in scrmz
I mean it's her episode, every character is getting one episode to focus on them
it's fun
do it
Being nuts is her major charm point
And Rikka has some stuff going on with hibiki
I am loving Akane as a little selfish wretch
SSSS.Gridman has me excited but I am a fan of how they are going about certain characters
but not the constant fanfare that basically makes the goal undeliverable
they deserve a little hype
Trigger is one of those studios that does above average stuff above averagely, and then messes up a little about 5 episodes before the end
Instant pick up
3hz
every last bit
I mean it was all foreshadowed
and has one of my favourite checkov's guns in all of anime
and the art is amazing
The OP part isn't that important
It's my life, bout a OP guard captain who retires to make a home and ends up taking in a kid who brings shenningans to his door.
brilliant ending to a great film
yes it is
OOF loud as fuck
this song is a wonder
Cause this song is too sexy
