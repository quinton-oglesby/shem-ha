im convinced this ai is always programed to poison everyone after shirabe uses her aoe heal/poison cleanse
it should be down this run unless rng decides to say no
hibiki got bodied by turn 3
i got so unlucky on my 3rd run
thats dedication
I can help kill some P hard if anyones doing that
if you can find Accelerates raid and havent tagged it, its getting close to dead now
whelp spent a bit refreshing and no snipeable raid. Just gonna start my own raid i suppose
f
seems like we'll have to dogpile onto a newer one then
Sunsets is about to die btw. Might kill it my current run
70 hibikki bodies P
had something like that happen to me yesterday doing the gold dailies
rip
oh P hards attack isnt supposed to be Cause? I always wondered what that would have even been
gave up on finding the top one. Found the bottom one though
on this int one?
ohh ill have to see if I can find that after this. I can decently do power
least you can get the 5* exp scrolls daily to chip away at it
dont think so
im just in crystal stockpile mode since the only thing I could UL until i get some more MLB units is the mikasachris
well thats quite the rewards
nice
mines around 30% left if anyone who hasnt yet wants to jump on
if i see that one after my raid is done, ill probs help kill it
possibly
dang thats commitment
thats unlucky
i got my P hard raid up if anyone wants to run it
3000?! jeez thats a lot of farming
i think ive only been matched up with 1 which i beat
the cult of teemo
Cais
good night
no problem
yeah, its about to die
i might be able to kill it cause the boss in normal doesnt seem to be doing much damage
Same
Ill hop in. Wanna clear out a follower space so i can add you?
34k now
i cleared up some space haz if you needed to follow me back
hmm that is weird haz
ill hop in it for a couple of runs
ive definitely bought some rice already
the blue autoscorer with carol
Ill hop in that P hard
plus shes a blue and at this point im all in blue
I LU'd Horizon spear maria cause shes the only 4* i can MLB
LU some rando units
eat all the rice
Super unlucky on that banner
I gotta wait for the rerun down the line for her
Yeah if you need P hard, itll go down fast
ill just tap that one too
anyone need help with P hard? Got some stam I need to waste
dragoon guy
im hitting that one now
Bye bye is 2
ill help
anytime
<@!107532017809260544> freed up some space
sure, Ill free up some slots and let you know once im outta this raid
i can help with a P hard if you need it
cool, followed. I cleared some space too if you wanna follow back
<@!107164200433885184> wanna clear up a follower spot so I can add you to hit your raid?
I can take some swings at it. Not sure how chunky my swings will be on carol though
if any one needs power hard, i can help run those fast. I kinda crush it now
i finally can hit her pretty well so im down to hit as many as i can
thanks. hitting it now
you have any more power hard to throw up? If not I can throw some up for you to join
wow i got so unlucky this run...xd bikki died from burn turn 3
cool, just followed. Cleared a few spaces if you need to follow back
just got out of a run. I can clear space if people need to follow
I have a red carol thatll be going down probably down soon
Ill hop in that one once im outta mine
added
I can help clear some P hard for you
I cleared up some space if you wanna follow me
could put things up and just invite friends instead of everyone
ill help beat up some carol after this advent
rip imma rando
1mil - 1.5mil
ah okay. Down the line i should be able to carry that since the next goal is mono red but for now I just body any red raids
<@!168735369184018432> just realized miracle was green and not red. Not sure if I can carry that one unfortunately
oh nice
its just a way to give back to the community. Ive learned a lot from here thats helped out my account
still got some rice left
yeah, i can run some more
Cleared a few slots
Ill clear some space so you can follow back
ill wait to start my next hit of it
I got a red carol at half if anyone wants to hop in before i kill
Either works. Both are like 15cp for me
building a mono red is my next goal now that blue is done. gonna go down the types
i can try to help with green carol but probably wouldnt be that effective since I run mono blue
okay, depends who needs mats. If someothers in here need to leech for carol mats, im down to kill as many as i can
Working on killing Kazusas carol now. After that I can work on yours
Sure that works
anyone need help with a power or red carol?
or just take 2 of my gigas
hopefully youll get that in 1 more run
oh nice
that 1 mil is my lowest run since I updated my team. Usually range from 1 - 1.5 mil <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
ill hop in after i finish the gold dailies
oh nice, only 2 more then you gotta grind those miracles
left my red carol with 9k hp if someone wants the hunt bonus
imma start working on another red carol and leave it low for others to get the hunt bonus
Nice
last member is the welfare kanade

Ill post my squad but I use the 3* blue jii and dr jii
i believe in you
its at 61k if anyone wants the hunt bonus
Got another red carol up that ill be killing if anyone wants in
if you have the spare mats, i think its worth
70
cleared a few
i can wait to do my next run
got a red carol up if anyone wants to join before I go for the kill
beating up a red carol now. Ill post it after if anyone wants in
one day, we'll be able to body the scary int man. Until that day, imma just leave it alone
thats a big rip
could just purge for now and if they come back readd
i do love bullying some red carol
Another red carol up if anyone wants in
Got a red carol up thatll probs die in the next 10 or so mins
the 4* power basa
yep, burnbasa
yeah the burn is the only annoying part really. Can get really unlucky with it and just have a bikki die really early in the run
my views a bit skewed though as I went mono int
cool, ill work on your red carol
cleared some space if anyone wants to add me
i just killed it
ill hop in that in a bit if its still around
shes at 165k. Ill hop back in when i get some more CP if its still up
ill hop in and carry
nice
i just opened one so if you dont get it this one, sure
ill work on another one and let you know when its up
sounds like you need to kill some red carol
i got a red carol up im working on if anyone wants in
Its up
cool, starting one now. Ill let you know when its joinable
you wanna clear some friend list space so I can follow? ill clear some of my as well
Which red? I can help for a bit before i head to bed
adds are dead for that carol
wait nvm, just 1
i use 2 posion cleanse jiis so I can probs deal with poison
havent tried. probs not as well as reds
just gotta kill more raids. Im working on your new one currently
itll still be up. Takes me 2 taps and im on tap 1
my bad. Im working on Yaminos red now if you wanna hop in
Especially with all the 2k XD mlbs with the reruns
yeah, theres definitely hope with that amount
its what happens with nonstop grinding ~~and a lighter wallet~~
Themofw's p hard will probs be going down in the next 5-10 mins if anyone wants to hop in that one
im working on Yamino's p hard now if you can find and join that one
rip cant. Can help you if you need more red raids dead though
its what my comp is good at. Killing red raids
Shes pretty solid in power raid
Oh nice. You got it
Anyone putting up another p hard? I still have mine i can toss up
Its really small
depends. CP efficient is 2 5s. Time is 10
ill just smack boops
cant find the first one
i can still beat em up
you still looking for the last melody?
In that power currently
although probs gonna hold off on doing more rages till I got more anti poison units
i believe in the 5%
got it to 40 now. im ready for future rage fights
Oh yeah thats a thing
Gotta wait another week for the xd maria rerun to have mlb
Run 2 of rage was pretty meh. Eren bikki ate so many poisons
Cleansing my units into her posioning them again right after feels so bad
once I get the last 3* P, ill have 2 to run in this
553k a run it seems
Rages poison is really annoying, holy hell
for 5 cp, ive seen the damage range from 1mil to 1.8mil
depends. Anywhere between 30 and 50 based on rng
ill give it a go once im done with the p hard

Nah im good on rewards. Would rather help out others get resources

ohh thats a new record for me with a single 5cp run
sounds like its time for me to beat up a power raid
time to go killing again
alright, hopped in yours
also im down to kill as many p hard raids I can if people need it
i would trade so many gigas right now for a 4* pink bikki
desire sensor at work
im in it
same
guess ill just pray i pull 2 more so I can mlb her.
there any other burn cleansers beside burnbasa?
i legit need only 1 body gigas and ill probably not need to farm it for a while after
Yeah, its actually the worst
At least i know now for my future self, if you bring a mainly int team and no burn cleanse, you are gonna have a bad time
true
oh dear, body bodies me.
ill give it a hit to see how much i can do after this power one
okay
anyone need more reds dead?
as far as I noticed, yeah. The stats are a lot better
im still waiting for that last dr jii so I can get her to 70
4*
imma step out after this one
body
i can only really do red raids really well
and deaded
power should be dead in a minute or so
i can bulli it
its cause cc
I can help with a few more. Wanna save some rice but i got a couple i can burn
magic carol is at 54k if anyone wants that hunt
smacking it now
I can help people with magic carol or int raid
you get that second giga from that carol?
i need to do more body
ive started killing more smol carol then power now tho
came from helping a ton of people kill power
i have too many red gigas ill never use

i wish i could convert a bunch of 1 gigas for a single gigas of something else
Ill get to the 5cp clear one day for a raid
oh nice
nah the edit makes it a ton better
too late
time to beat up a smol carol
she has been bullied
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
Cleared 5 spots
ill clear out some spots too
you should totally clear a couple spots so I can get on that list
2 body raids are getting close to dying if anyones interested
imma need to grind them miracles after i get 6 more bodies. Got enough miracle items for xd maria this weekend but not for the xd kiri rerun down the line
okay, ive forgiven body raid for the previous heartache. Got 5 gigas from the next one
getting the body gigas for xd kiri is gonna be so painful <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
This hurts so much
ive eaten so much rice going through body raids today
Im a whale with no life
i think most of my 5*s are caught up on xp right now

same
its going down
im just gonna think of the positives of my wasted pulls just now. I can LU dr jii
whelp off guarantee was a mistake.
tempted to go for it off guarantee
im 2 away
thanks <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Im free

gonna pray the nothing one rolls me 4. Nothing from the other even with all possible drops <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
i just need 4 gigas and i never have to touch body for a while
might be dead
It dropped to 15k. ez pz
my runs range from 40k - 105k depending how friendly dragon is
its at 60k...i could try and rng it

I just need this 1 body raid thats at 99k to drop to 50k so i can get that hunt
can i have that luck on my body raids?
thats a loooot of miracle
nah, its the selling 3*s and 4 *s
i was running low on rice until i realized you can get 200 from normal medals so ive been grabbing those
ok
anyone else have a power raid that needs a smack?
<@!64565434468282368> can you clear a follower spot? Ill hit that power for you
ill kill it
itll def be up. takes me 3 5 cps runs to down carol
ill be working on Girheims power carol if you wanna hop in that
yeah, I can hit power carols
yep, its a struggle to always clear some space
spaces have been freed up
ill clear a few spots
alright, ill add you and hop in it when its up
rip
so the healers can come in when she dies to full heal bikkis

5
im down to beat up a smol carol
power
<@!263392442345193472> I got an int raid at 62k health
definitely should still be up and at ~50%. Ill give it some time before I tap the other half if anyone else needs Int
<@!263392442345193472> opened up an int raid if you want in
now thats dedication
dont have her
nah
it dead now. got my highest 5 cp attempt <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah, you can do good damage if you have good blues even without burnbasa
i might be able to solo in 5cp once this ignite basa is 70
probs 50
didnt pay attention
anytime
whelp didnt kill it. Crystals power is at 98k if anyone wants the last tap
not much time left before its dead
Finally got the 1 tap
i can
just let me know if you need any beat up
<:KirikaWink:689564310908960900>
guess i gotta hit all your raids then
oh nice
its dead
killing it
oh nice
need some int hit?
i actually dont really hurt dex carol. Others here can help out with that though
im beating it up
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
Kat's int raid is about to die if anyone still needs to jump in
I can help hit int hard
you mean never stop spamming raids so you stay future proofed forever
Looks like i gotta bop another p hard
Yeah, I can smack one
i have a int boss at 557k if anyone wants to jump in that.
thats how the game gets you
if not, I can do that
<@!195044406343106560> just to double check are you dropping it low for tab now?
ill clear a spot
i dont have taboo on follow so I cant see it
if youre doing int boss, I can help out
lol ruby
Ill kill it in an hour or so if its still up
If anyone needs blue mats i have this up
ill hop in to it once im done the raid im in
I can help out if needed
I can do big carol pretty well now if anyone needs help with those
does that mean I cant add you <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
i wish there was more follower slots. Getting real hard to purge since most of my list is people from here
got some spots open now
i have it open to followers. Ill clear a spot if you want to add me
I have a dex carol up if anyone wants to jump in before i go in for round 2
yeah dragon is super rng based
rip
hitting Tab's int raid first tho
yeah, Imma start working on another dex carol
if that ever happened, i would just keep spending if my rolls were that
LMAO
me
kimono chris/jii, ignite maria, xd kiri
I shall be the int savior with my 4 LUed B units
i can jump in the intel hard
tabs int hard is at 312k if anyone needs blue mats
retire and run it back with 10cp
ill smack it
yeah, someone killed
its at 500kish
i have one up if you wanna join it
yeah Im down
yeah, ill worki on it more
yeah, about to finish my run
its gonna be dead soon
nice
Looks like its dead now
not enough rainbow mats
yep
ill give the one i opened an hour or two to see how many people in here hop on it
thats probs the first one i put up. The screenshot was a rando who had it open
5 cp on auto. New units clap body. If anyone needs some body, i can help out
yeah
ah okay
i was gonna have it up and see if anyone wanted the hunt bonus on it
bring on the next body
my tech raid team aint that good but i can try after
if you open up some body hards, Ill body them for you
yeah, i havent touched dex is forever and i dont think ive ever hit heart
Body raid up if anyone needs a hit
if you need more, i can hit some more
it is done
if you post one up, ill kill
I can hit that. whats your ID so I can follow you?
Ill kill it
no problem
you can host as many as you want as long as its not the same boss
I can 10 cp or 5cp 5 of the bosses
i just auto raids whenever i have the stam

more like this
pfft
didnt get the 1 tap but its at 80k so someone will swoop in
i got it
okay i win
first one done wins a prize
im in p carol
ill hit some
I can now 5cp smol carol if anyone needs it in the future
I can kill quartzs raid
<@!174272493777977344> cleared a couple of spots if you wanna add
if you need int mats, I can 1 tap blue boss for you
if you have some raids that you can put up you need killed, I can kill most bosses
bring on the next
2nd is dead
50 basa too strong
jumping into next raid
one done
i cant really poke yellows but if you ever need red/blue/pink, I can clear those for you
yeah, thats not too bad
you can see the raids of the person you follow
its technically the other way around
putting your friend code in your discord name helps people adding/finding your raids to help out
<@!263392442345193472> bonk my raid pls
should probably move to <#673253184885489696> at this point
it was WoW and its short for Hilbilystomp
thats a pretty nice collection
whats the collection looking like
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the worst part of reading it is the wait for volume 6
yeah, its pretty amazing imo. Only 5 volumes of it currently
im a big fan of Reki Kawahara's works aside from base sao. Have you read The Isolator?
theres just too many series i have to get through <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
accel world is def awesome
ah okay. last volume i read was 10 and i have up to 25
how behind are you on accel? Im also in need of catching up
strike and asterisk definitely two series i regret not getting when they were just starting to come out since ive been collecting print copies since like 2015ish
0 on site
https://www.amazon.it/Asterisk-War-Vol-light-novel-ebook/dp/B01M0XFERP/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_it_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3K8IM1J4EHL6F&keywords=asterisk+war+3&qid=1654202961&s=books&sprefix=asterisk+war+%2Cstripbooks%2C108&sr=1-1
for asterisk war, the out of print copys are like volume 3 and a couple others
the physical book
Not for paperback
air neos reprint is never happening <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
that series is my next white whale since i finally this past weekend was able to find strike the blood 3,4,6,8 as a bundle for 300
Asterisk reprints when
the novels came before the anime
i got the 2 omnibuses coming in soon <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the ln
theres always hope that theres a solid deal out there like the strike the blood one i got for an arm and a leg
log horizon is another i want eventually
asterisk war is the main one
i should probs look for more deals on some older series i want to pick up
Same for me 2 weekends ago. Day 1 I did rock my Watch Symphogear shirt and got 2 people to comment on it
I still have an open order from july of last year cause 1 book still hasnt restocked
out of stock stuff is so fun
i actually like that series tho
yeah, i havent seen the anime but the ln is written really well
this volume ends on quite the cliffhanger
one of my favorites currently
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G63pPhsIn-yihuMwdEkFqKEtz1au-91t326gCMZ5ql8/edit?usp=sharing
if youre curious, heres my spreadsheet on what i have
oh i doubt ill read all 19 in the month. My backlog is probs over like 600 at this point
ill have to see once i start the order. Should be 19 books or so for me next month
konosuba 17 i think is the only one i know off the top of my head
even better
time to get all the volumes 2s
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
ah that seven seas sale has preorders for next month on it. Guess im preordering earlier than usual
Makes sense
gotta have the biggest western LN collection of all time
keep getting it
i get volume 1, never read, and keep getting the future volumes in case i like it
i take the opposite approach
nope
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
lmao i have the best taste
out of print. Sniped a deal on ebay for them
the out of print ones come in later this week <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
i saw the sale, but i usually preorder for the month ahead so im probably set

Too lazy to take a photo since they already on the shelf so heres the rightstuf screenshot of what was sent
newest one is almost full as i just got a bulk order of stuff delivered today
you mean i got more bookshelves to buy <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
one day ill go back to collecting figs
i read otome game though so im fine
nah nah, if i wanna see a series as art, ill watch the anime. I got anime for visual and LNs for story
i dont read manga
all LN
Okay, july was a bit more volumes then i expected. 23 more books to the collection <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
it makes the $$$
My subject is on why "Don't you love your mom and her two-hit multi-target is actually an enjoyable book"
can i teach the class?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
its should be a class
also sometimes you have to read bad series so whenever someone says its good, youll be armed with all the knowledge on why they are fundamentally wrong
no no, it gets good volume 2 on i swear
like the idea that maybe it gets better
lots of things can save a LN
hopefully when i get v1, i can get around to reading it in less than a year
thats good to hear
i mean they are pretty good again with sending partial orders
eventually ill put in a support ticket for it
they forgot my order probs lol
ROLL OVER AND DIE I Will Fight for an Ordinary Life with My Love and Cursed Sword! Novel Volume 1
nope, havent read it yet
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
but they aint light novels <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
biggest collection of LNs
why would i need more to my backlog
although buying figs on rightstuf doesnt seem worth imo
oof
value
i gotta renew mine as it ends next month
it pays for itself so fast
oh you def should have gotten it by now
so ive been building my BD collection when those happen
lol not a millionaire. Rightstuf here and there has insane BD sales where a ton of series are from like 3-13 bucks
im hoping for the insane BD sales
I remember when i used to order all my lns from amazon until i heard of rightstuf and got tired of some books being damaged cause amazon packaging is awful
Rightstuf definitely is the goat
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
LN <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Hell yeah
Smartphone LN is where its at
oda nobuna no yabou s2 when
if you read the source, you dont need to watch the anime
wait no you always read source
just pick up book 2 onwards for collection purpose
yeah it is
that old one has just 1 book that hasnt been sent yet
This is what my open orders tab is looking like
see the goal of rightstuf is to build up as many orders as possible that dont ship
Niiice
*do what your heart tells you to do that isnt illegal
do what your heart tells you to do
join the full LN side
speaking of which, i gotta order stuff for this and next month
cause more keep coming out each month
the day that happens is the day i go back to buying all my LNs on amazon
I really hope that this doesnt mean down the line that they change how much care they put in packaging books
oh nooo
