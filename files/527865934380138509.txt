does anyone know if comic-cons and the likes of that are doing covid precautions? i ask bc a family member of mine is going to one soon
i'm actually dealing w/ what ella's talking about rn as we speak, so i'm on the same page as they are rn
i actually have a similar problem
^
NY
ty
Very unpleasant experience
So I got quite a fright tonight bc my cousin was stuck at work late at night with no place open and a flooded car
though i guess the 'bad days getting worse' thing can be linked to it as well
i may try to make chit-chat to get my mind off of it and talk about a show or a movie, or maybe just say 'hey, how's it going?' and i'm still treated the same way
sometimes i feel like discord hates when i'm experiencing a negative emotion. i'm not talking about specific servers, i'm just talking in general. when my dad or night goes bad in an instant, i literally say *nothing* from the offset about it on discord. i understand that discord is a gaming platform and not a support platform - i totally understand that - but from the moment things go south for me, every server i'm in ignores anything i say, and i'm not even saying a *single thing* about what's happening to me. it's like nobody wants me to exist when things go south for me, even if nobody knows that that's what happening to me. again, i'm not attacking specific people or servers. i just notice and experience this everywhere i go
i wanna help my sister bc she's nervous and anxious about a lot of things lately, and tmrw is her first day of school. but there's nothing i can do to help, at least not atm since she doesn't seem to want any direct help rn. idk what to do. what should i do?
ok. i brought it up and my mom said things just might take a slow time for my sister or something like that
the only thing is that as long as these storage guys are here, i can't really say anything to my folks rn or for a while
i guess i'm just not the best at dealing w/ this bc i see that something's wrong and, well, nothing's improving of it, especially w/ school back in session
ohh
what's tmrw?
if that's so, i guess that'd explain why my parents aren't brute-forcing it either atm
you know what i mean?
for us, it's less so the issue of how the states deal w/ it imo, and moreso the fact that 1) it's only the 2nd day, and 2) she's gonna miss all the teachers in all her classes saying 'this is what we're gonna do moving forward, what's the plan,' etc.
long island. we're actually having moving people bring in my furniture from the city and from storage, so i can't really bring it up to them (the guidance counselor idea) bc they're occupied rn. should i try calling the counselor myself or just wait for now?
ok. i'll just have to see, i guess
no, but her school is the same one i went to
but idk how else i'd be able to tell them about the guidance counselor
i'm also hesitant to bring up that idea bc i got yelled at this morning bc i could potentially say something out loud about this whole ordeal rn
like her guidance counselor who works at the school and so on?
what are we supposed to do? i feel like the only option is to shove her into the car and then into the school building just to get her in there, though if my parents aren't doing that, i'm guessing it's not ideal. but still, ....idk
she said she's tired and that's it. we feel like there's more to it than that, since we explicitly told her she can't miss it on just the 2nd day, but she just kinda treated us like we're shit and won't say or do anything else now. she also stays up all night long, even after we say not to
it's my sister's 2nd day of school and she's already just refusing to go. nothing we're doing is working
i was wondering how one could find out whether a therapist (like the one she's seeing/meeting with) is effective for her or not, but my dad said that that's not something you can answer in only a short period of time. so idk
she's 16
now she's just sleeping all day and all night, refusing to do anything at all or cooperate
coming off of <#336297387863703552>, my sister made my mom scream and even cry bc she treats my mom like crap, is sleeping basically 24 hrs a day, already missing school even though it just started, and just will not do anything. and once next week starts w/ more school days for her to go to (or rather, that she has to or should go to), i fear we'll go back to square one all over again
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
i've felt that feeling aplenty
i understand too. sometimes we just feel like we have the entire world's weight on our shoulders (figuratively speaking), even if we don't want to
in my area nowadays, the tv networks and internet seem to talk about hurricanes, what could become a hurricane soon, etc. i wouldn't mind it so much if they didn't spam it constantly, and you can't really filter the online news based on your location or state bc google and news don't really do that too much. but regardless, i think their method of shoving the hurricane news in my area's face 24/7 needs to stop
doing nothing at all never helps. i speak from genuine experience. keeping the mind relaxed or occupied can help
the only other option i can think of is to call 911 and see if they can help
i'm hoping for the best for your dog.
that's similar to what folks i know have done too when they've gone out to eat
since i live in NY, i get a lot of ads from the city saying that you need to be vaccinated in order to go into diners, restaurants, eating establishments, etc. in the city. however, when i was there today, mcdonald's didn't seem to care or take note, so i kinda wonder what was the point of the NYC health PSAs on tv then if it's not necessarily *all* eating places
one sec
to make matters worse, starting next month, i learned that we're gonna have another great recession
let me share something that i learned today
don't use peapod. at all. they won't care about your schedule or what time it is. they only care about themselves. they are awful!
no. US
Should I assume that girl had Covid, or is that unknown in any case?
But because I keep hearing about stuff like the variants and what the media says about them, I fear it doesn’t make a difference anymore, and i really hope that’s not the case
I’m vaccinated. My whole family at home is too
Maybe I just shouldn’t work in a city until Covid is gone forever
I touched it before. A little while ago. I wasn’t thinking about that unfortunately
Showers don’t get rid of the virus, I don’t think
Between the cough and the time I get home will have been over 2 hours. Would the shower still work for that  at that point?
No. But I think there are tiny holes on the back sides of my face mask. I think I could feel them when I checked
Do masks still work if someone coughs behind me instead of in front of me? The mask doesn’t cover behind the head, and they weren’t wearing a mask behind me when they coughed
what i was saying last night is basically, someone said that something would happen in D.C. that would cause another great recession, and it had to do w/ the debt ceiling
not to take away from that bc that's very important too, but i looked online. it turns out that showers do absolutely nothing to prevent covid. like at all
isn't NSW in australia iirc?
yea. some are good, but others are bad. it's the latter that can make things harder
i mainly don't like it when i associate it w/ times of significant change in my life. times where i'm kinda going thru something on my own that can be tough to manage or handle
going back to something similar to said a while back, sometimes i have an emotional reaction to music bc i connect it to something in my life. idk why i do that but it just happens whenever something major comes up in my life. and while it may be understandable or reasonable, i don't really like this reaction of mine
prob not much
I kinda wonder what the knicks and the garden are doing with fans. A train I’m on has a bunch of younger Knick fans and they’re all maskless. I was kinda hoping that New York would take precautions
i am a hypochondriac. if the risk is present but minimized, how minimized is it? a lot or a little? also, i don't want this to become a 'doomsday catastrophe', but it seemed like the driver was being careless bc of not protecting me from him
he was deliberately going against company policy of having masks cover your *entire* face. that's what uber says to do
I should’ve looked into the service before ever taking this job. Uber has zero liability for whether or not their drivers are vaccinated. My mask accident of being exposed for a split-second is gonna infect me and my entire family
Screw it. He gave my family Covid. I’m reporting him
Uber seemingly has no liability
Uber has no indicator as to whether or not all of their drivers are vaccinated. They don’t even have a phone number. My driver could’ve had Covid and I have no way of contacting Uber. The driver was wearing a face shield that didn’t cover the direction where I was, as opposed to a full face mask, and I had a little accident with my own mask as I was about to get out of the car
The NY railroad:
Where “federal law” apparently = “no law”
Is having your mask on and not covering your nose considered masked? I was kinda thinking no since you breathe thru your nose, but so many people I see irl think the opposite
at least seemingly or upon first glance
so it looks like this is texas and the supreme court's fault partially
https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/oranienburg-09-21/index.html this seems bad
why do nor'easter storms seemingly move much slower than hurricanes? an upcoming storm is staying above my area/county for roughly 2 whole days, and i honestly hate them more than hurricanes sometimes
A dog fence guy is coming into my house but he’s not wearing a mask. How do we know if he’s vaccinated?
ty
my grandpa is going to the hospital. on his bday. during a blackout. i can't take this anymore
I am seeing a therapist. But I can’t talk to her all the time
is there a way to know the likeliness of certain risks, or could that be somewhat uncertain too?
all i can really think of regarding doing that is telling myself 'you're fully vaccinated.' but idk if that'll be enough, at least for me mentally
i am having trouble. i just happen to be worse than i usually am bc of events going on in my life at home lately/in the past 24 hrs or so. also, my therapist isn't always a guarantee bc, while she said i'm allowed to call and text her whenever i need to, she doesn't always respond back to me, so i could sometimes be left just hanging w/ my specific issue, such as this. in regards to defense mechanisms, do you mean mentally and emotionally and regards to those defense mechanisms?
while my situation is somewhat different than yours, i absolutely feel what you're feeling, for lack of better words.

my therapist told me to not be a burden on my mom or my family, especially w/ recent events that happened to us over the past 24 hours. but i'm just failing miserably. i'm on guard for any remote possibilities or warning signs of people or workers w/ covid or stuff that could lead to the flu, but no one will listen to me. people who are fully vaccinated can seemingly still get covid, suffer severely from it despite the vaccine doses, or worse, die. why is everyone around me treating things in the world like everything is back to normal? it's not. if you're in someone's face who is unmasked and unvaccinated, i just don't see how you can't get covid and spread it to everyone else you meet. i just kinda wonder if i'm the only sane person left in an insane world, or vice-versa. idk anymore and idk what to think. all i can do w/ literally no guidance from anything or anyone is brace for the absolute worst
this past week in its entirety, she didn't go to school. part of it was bc she got a cold. the other half of it, idk
i don't
my family and i have tried literally everything to get my sister to do her homework. she's even going to a new school for half of the day and meeting new friends. and this all in the end changed nothing. i just...don't know how to get thru to her anymore so that she doesn't fail her classes. i fear this will all end in disaster
would the booster make me feel sick? idk if it's any different from the regular covid vaccine
that's part of the problem for me personally. i actually do have hypochondria. it's hard for me to chill sometimes when this happens, even if i want to or am looking to chill
at the school i substituted at today, a faculty member mentioned that an entire class there was quarantined, yet other students and classes were still there in the building in-person. idk whether or not more than one class shares the school cafeteria at once for lunch (i just asked them via email now), but i do know that they share hallways, stairwells, and other rooms or spaces like the auditorium when waiting for certain classes to start. why would the other students and faculty not be freaked out (or something like that) about getting covid if a class or student they share the building and halls with got it? isn't the risk greater for people in an indoor, small/cramped, or shared place inside?
i'll have to do it privately bc it's venting
what happened to me today is actually making me question if i'm even worth anything to anyone. at least outside of my family
i wanna get my booster shot for covid, but now that this video came up on the top of the youtube homepage for me, i'm kinda asking myself: should i? will it even work now? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guoYPK0XmC8
I will
Mine
To get my Covid booster, I need my physical card with me. Why don’t pharmacies tell you this in advance before you go?
i'm never prepared when seemingly everything goes south at home for me. and when it does happen, i'm just so angry and frustrated and don't know how to react. idk if it's bc i like things orderly or if it's something else that's causing my reaction(s)
But any mentions of the precautions they did? Nothing. They just talk about the variant case, and that’s literally it. I’m getting sick of the news
Yes
Someone who went to the anime convention that my sister went to got the Covid variant. Nothing has been said about the effectiveness of precautions at the convention online, like at all
everyone told me to get the booster and i did. i just hope it ends up being worth it in the end
i don't wanna have to fear me or my family going outside for the rest of my life bc of this virus and the headlines, at least not while other people i know are going out, working, etc.
i'm afraid to go to sleep tonight - at least rn - bc of something pretty serious that i'm dealing with rn. however, since it's the middle of the night, i have no professional help to turn to, and idk what to do
i'm afraid for my physical when i go to the doctor this week bc the news said that covid cases had doubled. the doctor usually checks my mouth, so i would have to take my mask off. should i ask him not to do that to avoid any chances of me getting covid or something like that?
Ahh that’s reassuring
That was partially due to timing. Though I prob shouldn’t say more than that…
Unless they talk about solutions, they’re just twiddling their thumbs
Then the media needs to stop talking about what’s going on and instead talk about what SHOULD be done
Idk much about corruption in Europe so I can’t speak for them
Did US and Europe magnify it?
I hate Xi Jinping so much
With the cases, who is vaccinated? Who isn’t? They don’t say from the offset. So you kinda just have to go with irl knowledge while the media is seemingly, if not entirely or 100%, fearmongering
I guess another thing to consider is
Otherwise, it wouldn’t make the tv news headlines, and this wouldn’t happen: https://twitter.com/tompelissero/status/1475594469680553985?s=21
Yes
Who won’t anyone get vaccinated suddenly? Vaccinations seemingly just stopped all over the country
i was hoping that the shots would keep covid away at all times. but if it doesn't, do the shots still do their job at least in our bodies and whatnot?
if they're vaxxed and boosted?
could someone in their 80s w/ breathing issues survive it too?
was your dad vaccinated, too?
my mom said my grandma has no symptoms, but she's still old. my grandpa is too, and he has breathing problems
as soon as i was told this, i ended up being alone in my room, afraid for both my life and the lives of my family. my grandma has (unintentionally) given the family covid, so my parents will get it, my aunts and uncles will get it, i'll get it, etc. i have no one to talk to online and irl rn about this and i'm afraid we're all gonna die
idk how a 1-day difference will affect the tests, but that's what they're gonna do
ok. i ask bc my parents and 2 other people who saw my grandma (who tested positive) got covid tests today and their results afterward. i believe my parents are getting tested again tmrw bc someone told my dad that it's best to get tested 2 days afterwards (which for us will be tmrw).
so i know that covid tests aren't always 100% guaranteed or correct, but if a professional covid test (like at the doctor's, etc.) is taken by someone 2 days in a row, is there a decent chance that the result between the 2 tests will be the same?
what i hate is that they don't always specify how many cases are unvaccinated, which are, and so on. i feel like that's important
rip
i know south park's take on post-covid is supposed to be fictional and humorous, but i hope it doesn't become a reality
the vibe i'm getting from her tweets about this is that life doesn't seem to be worth living just bc of the next 2 months. and i'm still dealing w/ covid at home as we speak
i'm really angry that my whole life had to come to a stop for who knows how long bc someone at my grandma's nursing home can't do their job
just don't come into contact with them
i haven't either. however, often when i google something like seeing it or running into it in an article like this, the search results show more than one site saying this. so not just intelligencer or ny mag
is there a way to get google or youtube to stop showing me anything news-related? like at all? https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/why-you-should-upgrade-your-face-mask-to-an-n95.html?utm_source=pocket-newtab
exactly. while not all the time, it's sometimes kinda fearmongering
> Taiwan buys 20,000 bottles of Lithuania rum destined for China
where do they get these stories?
you guys were right about the omicron scare being a bit overdone. my grandma got the variant and she had no symptoms. my uncle has it now, but it only feels like a cold to him and he's feeling ok despite that. i'm just getting a bit frustrated w/ the news and articles often scaring me to death (figuratively) like this
https://www.the-sun.com/news/4464479/winter-storm-izzy-path-tracker-live-updates/
fuck google
https://twitter.com/WVEMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1482819951282982913%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.the-sun.com%2Fnews%2F4464479%2Fwinter-storm-izzy-path-tracker-live-updates%2F i'm gonna die
i can't even share my server online bc the discord search sites SUCK!
a mod in a server i'm in, or rather, was in, mocks me and harasses me. i love the anime that the server is associated with, but i'm done w/ this. so help me, i'll make another server for it if i have to
in regards to covid and going to see a movie, should i go to whatever theater is in an area w/ less cases?
if a storm is coming and everyone knows about it bc the news goes on and on about it, why would the electric company call everyone and tell us what we already know? what should i interpret from that?
i know it's been a thing for a while already, but i don't recall this many people making a living online or on youtube falling victim to this all at once
japanese countries are out of control w/ killing youtubers. they don't run the world! all of this shit that they're doing w/ youtube is atm only coming from there https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6uH71BdMBA
https://twitter.com/GilvaSunner/status/1488555303918616581?s=20&t=63wjF6DegLvaQTO9Fy683A
no sugarcoating it, i'm currently atm at one of the lowest points in my entire life. something could happen to my loved ones and there's nothing i can do about it (without giving away any specifics about my situation)
mark zuckerberg doesn't like how he was portrayed in the film The Social Network. the thing is, though, the rest of society thinks the opposite about it and him
ohh
i scrolled up for a while and all i can see is articles that support or point to this war happening. i can't find any articles going against it, and i've scrolled up 2-3 times already
what's the thing?
unless someone confirms that they won't fire nuclear weapons at us, why should i even sleep? heck, why should i even be alive?!
i was about to say 'and please don't spam jokes about how we're all gonna die from this conflict anyway,' but...you know what? FUCK THIS PANDEMIC AND FUCK WHO STARTED IT!
i'm not gonna point fingers in regards to when the world started to go to shit, but i'll say this. during the previous administration, w/ all the news and conflicts w/ north korea, i honestly thought they were gonna shoot their nuclear missiles at us and thinking 'we're all gonna die.' russia said any enemies could suffer consequences unlike anything before in history. russia is much worse than north korea could ever be. how am i supposed to sleep tonight without confirmation on whether or not russia could shoot their nukes at the US and kill us all?
like maniac screaming
i was never in that. that might've been someone else. but if that was something that could get me out of the house for most of the day, i'd do it. i went downstairs bc i can hear coming from upstairs is literal screaming
i don't think i can live in my own home anymore. i'm living w/ a mental case rn and i just don't think being stuck in the house w/ the worst mental case in human history is going to help me, especially since i'm working now
someone in my family has pneumonia. since my folks are busy on the phone about the matter, i have no idea who has it, so i'm a little concerned
well i'm just getting the feeling that multi-platform games cost more on the switch, and it's all i have access to. so i get ripped off and i have no other option for buying the games or playing them on anything else
coming off of <#337805317276565525>, i'm just moving this here to avoid any issues. the nintendo ceo needs to grow a pair
My grandpa turned on the tv and Fox News’ headline said a UN Secretary General said a nuclear war is possible. So now I’m freaking out internally since I’m constantly and really afraid of things killing me (as a phobia). I have things i need to get done today and now that's grinding to a halt because of my fear over this, even if my fear may or may not be somewhat irrational
RIP. I don’t think I got to see her here but it’s sad. Dying so young
anyway, idk why i became so hellbent on doing my new hobby. it's just destroying me
idk how to respond to that
i've tried figuring different things out w/ this hobby of mine since late november
but i'm having trouble coming up w/ something else
bc i wanted to accomplish something w/ it. i guess i enjoyed it at first, but it got to a point where it was all i could think of doing to pass time. and now, i'm obsessed w/ it and i feel like it's ruining my life sometimes, like w/ how i feel rn bc of it
i really had to pick up a hobby that i'm awful at. i wish i could go back in time and slap my face for even thinking about it in the first place. this new hobby i've been having for the past couple of months has been nothing but a waste of time. i heard somewhere that 'trying is never a waste,' but it was for me in this case. i'm such a fool and i'm just hate myself so much rn
i'm kinda wondering if i should look for another job if i'm hating this particular commute every night before i go in
bc the ones we have just will not work. and any other service online that i've found only do or specialize in specific things or topics. they refuse anyone or anything else
i am now literally living in a house where no one is happy. 2 people keep fighting w/ each other and making each other upset, and i have no power to stop it. all i'm able to do is restrain myself 24/7 from lashing out at one of them. nothing ever blows over like people say. everything just gets worse. and you don't realize it until times like these where therapists, in reality, care about nobody but themselves. and i bet that none of this would've happened if this pandemic never happened
that doesn't include the US, does it?
my home life is awful right now. i don't know why i clicked on the chat. now i find out that putin is gonna take control of certain parts of military from all over the world bc of this fucking bill
there's a video of a spanish or mexican (iirc) newscaster who pointed out the problem or the cause in a rant, and he was just livid. but at the same time, it was kinda cathartic to watch since he was *kinda* right in regards to what he was saying
so i was told at work by the person who looks out for covid (as part of a union thing) that there's a new covid variant. i really wish she never said that
dirtbags
i usually don't get tangled up in that stuff, at least online
unless they follow that stuff too
but this wasn't the manager. this was the producer
i was given crap at work today for something i didn't do, and everyone essentially told me to suck it up. why do i get scolded and yelled at for stuff i didn't do or had no connection to? does the whole world just hate me?
NO MORE NYC HEALTH PSAs! just stop! if they don't stop doing these 2-minute talking ads, they're essentially fearmongering. stop!
i swear. therapists don't help anybody. someone could be in a crisis, and they just turn their heads. it's disgusting
i don't. but someone in my family does, and their room is next to the kitchen
so then does this boil down partially to news fearmongering? (w/ that in mind)
oh
wdym?
every news channel my household comes across keeps telling us that, essentially, all the nuclear weapons are gonna get fired at us, and we're all gonna die. i shouldn't be afraid to leave my room for an hour each day out of fear that the headlines will get worse and worse (someone in my house watches the news at this hour), but....yea. idk what else to say
you can continue to discuss this as you wish, but i kinda realized i gotta hold off on it for now bc there's something serious going on in my house that i should focus on instead of multitasking
and when there's a problem, one needs a solution. but there's seemingly no solution
tbh, if conservatives and liberals have polar opposite opinions and stances nowadays that lead to disagreements, fights, problems w/ congressmen, etc., then...should we still be 1 nation?
1 year actually. biden won in 2020, but he didn't take office until 2021
https://www.facebook.com/nychealth/posts/410447600907386?notif_id=1651499762897981&notif_t=covid_alert_notif&ref=notif i have to go back to the city for a potential job next month. should i back down from it if the covid warnings, etc. are going up? it says that covid alerts have gone to 'medium'. sorry to butt in suddenly
ok
but wouldn't i be exposed? or is duration usually/generally too quick or brief for me to worry about it like that?
i heard that wearing masks on planes isn't a federal mandate anymore. if i wanna eat or drink something on a plane, how do i prevent getting covid from anyone else who might have it on the same plane?
i'm stuck in a work and club predicament. i have to drive 45 mins to do something for a half hour (4:30-5), but i can't go home bc i have a club 30 min or so away from home from 7-10pm. while both the job and club aren't bad or horrible per se, bc of how long the commute and day is, i'm getting tired of it, and especially tired of the commutes and long drives. however, since i have no other job accepting me, i'm afraid to turn either down. what should i do?
i definitely feel you, pug. when several things start piling up like that all at once, it's just...well, unpleasant. very unpleasant, for lack of a better word. i don't entirely know the best way of combating it mentally, but yeah. that's just what i think since i'm in a similar situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dMgEwQYdog i'm sharing this after today since this video is still relevant, and bc my entire day has been utter shit
is there someone or a service you can call for additional or emergency help?
ok. i'll try to keep that in mind as much as i can
idk what to do
my sister (and possibly my family) now has covid
i'm so sorry
ok. i'll try to do that as much as possible
i was recommended to do coping things like meditation. however, when i've done that before, i felt as though i didn't have to worry about the lives of those i love. so idk how i'm gonna be able to do it now
what did i ever do to deserve this? or my family?
i'm safe. but i tend to associate the ER w/ life-threatening things. idk if this will end up being life-threatening or not. i don't want it to be
my sister just went to the ER due to symptoms of covid, and...idk what to think or do anymore
i mean in regards to how i'm thinking about it
my parents aren't worried about (unintentionally) giving each other covid but i'm worried about it. idk if i'm in the wrong here or i'm just insane or not
idk if this topic can be considered iffy or not, but i'm gonna put this in here just in case, since i think this *can* be considered at least somewhat serious or questionable.

i've been noticing that in the cast credits for a lot of anime from/over at least the past 15 years, male seiyuu can voice a character at whatever age they want to, but most female seiyuu are under 30. are they not allowed to voice primary or supporting characters in anime if they're 30 and over? if so, that kinda seems unfair and a bit biased imo
this week's SNL and colbert episodes are prob gonna be *brutal*
i know it's silly to think about, but...is being *1* nation really working anymore? i sometimes don't think it is
if anyone needs little pieces of catharsis in all of this madness, i recommend checking out the monologues of stephen colbert, and chelsea handler, who's covering for jimmy kimmel this week. i wanted them to throw some punches and they certainly delivered. they verbally gave the court, the ex-pres and the GOP what's coming to them
i will say that i've been getting a kick out of colbert and chelsea handler this week. chelsea's covering for kimmel
or did someone else get them in there?
but i thought trump was the one who put the current judges on the supreme court
it's hard to say for sure, since the person responsible for the reasons and cause of the J6 hearings in the first place is the same person responsible for this supreme court
rest in peace
so my grandpa was supposed to do physical rehab at a nursing home, but for some reason, even though we have the coverage, he's being denied the rehab. idk why they're blocking him and us from doing it for seemingly no reason
atm i'm moreso shaken up by the fact that suddenly, he's not actually gonna come back to our home/house anymore, and i didn't know about this until now
ok. so I just got sudden news that my grandpa won’t be living with us anymore and instead at the nursing home. And I’m not too sure how I feel
i wanna bring something up, but before i do, is bringing up not-govt stuff in this chat ok to do?
my mom told me we weren't able to care for all of his needs. he's gonna be put in a room w/ my grandma so that they're together, and we're planning to visit them this weekend
my family did so much political talk earlier today to a point where now i'm worrying about trump winning again
i did. basically, i was gonna turn left, and another person on the other side of the road was also gonna turn left. he had his blinker on and was slowing to a stop for the turn, so i was moving. suddenly, w/ his flicker still on for whatever reason, he then speeds forward in my direction instead and i had to swerve to avoid a collision. asshole
speaking of transit, maybe people should learn how to drive at night. i say that bc on my drive home tonight, someone almost crashed into me
ty
though i prob won't hear from her until tmrw since it's nighttime over here by me
i have a therapist and i talk to her. i guess something like this hasn't come up for me in a while. i just texted her now
i will admit that i do have problems w/ stuff like that, etc. and i'm also a bit frustrated bc i feel like everyone else i know (at least irl) doesn't seem to have problems like this. i know i shouldn't compare myself to others, but still
so then, thinking back to my initial reaction when i heard this in the media a little while ago, is this the media fearmongering something again? (or partially?)
the tweet for it says 2 days ago
but i saw a prediction map for re-entry and the area of prediction covered practically the entire globe
i don't exactly have my family to talk to about this since they're out of town, but i came across this headline. i don't wanna be afraid for my life, but...should i? https://www.wesh.com/article/chinese-rocket-falling-earth/40746563#
what should i take away from the video? just so i'm 100% sure what i should take away from it
“Under siege, raided and occupied”
Seems no different from when he’s there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6gVZMcdHAE whenever i wanna relax, youtube gives me these recommended videos that suggest the end times. so now i'm worried that i'm gonna end up on the street, especially since the comments section said so
also some parts of it seem a little vague. not all of it. just parts of it
TIL elon musk fucked w/ las vegas https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boring_Company
I didn’t want to interrupt anyone, but then I just wasn’t sure when to say this but I wanted to say something just to get it out of me: my grandpa died
We’re glad you’re ok
if some strangers keep walking by for seemingly no reason, call the cops or let them know. better safe than sorry imo
he did, but it still hurts
going back to something important yet tragic that i mentioned before, i wish i could do more for my dad since it's been so much for him
oh i give up. my grandpa died, i'm grieving, and i can't talk to my family for the next (nearly) 24 hours. i'm not kidding
i'm sorry everyone. you can still talk about the war stuff if you want to like before
unless the damage is already done 🤦‍♂️ <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
but i don't wanna make the convo come to a halt. i'll feel like i've screwed w/ the entire chat
i can't talk to my own family for several hours tmrw bc they'll be at a funeral, and i can't handle this bad week on my own
it's ok. you can still talk about whatever you're talking about. i just needed to get it out there, y'know?
every time i want to use this server, all i can think of is venting. i'll try to keep it as little to no venting as possible: my life is legitimately falling apart and idk what to do anymore
i just want all of this to eventually pass. i don't wanna feel like the world or the universe is against me or anything like that (i sometimes feel like that when stuff like this happens (irl))
i really appreciate it and am grateful
before i forget, ty lily and everyone for letting me use the chat to just...unwind from all of this in my life rn
ok. i'll think about it
aside from this whole thing of them going to the funeral out of state and me staying here, i don't need to video call my parents. they'll be home tmrw night
i won't go into the details in this particular case but...let's just say in this case, it's easier said than done
if i went, then no one would be able to take my sister to and from school
this only happened for us last week in this case. do you think it'll get better over time for me and my family too?
imo at least
i would've preferred going to the funeral. yes, it is a funeral, but when the time comes for everything in the funeral, everything is slow. it's calm. it's peaceful as everyone and their hearts come together to honor the life of someone. w/ what *my* schedule was gonna be like instead, you can't really do that
just w/ my dad
exactly. the same thing happened to me in this case
ok. ty. the only thing is that now i'll have to break the ice to my parents in regards to me rescheduling everything. but i'll emphasize this when i tell them: 'please don't be mad at me.' this loss is affecting me as much as it affects them
again, the lack of emotion control thing
i honestly started getting mad about a seiyuu being in every single anime that i ever come across, and (tw) ||even started yelling and cursing at my computer monitor bc of it||, but i remembered that stuff like that isn't important so i decided to speak up
and calmer
in retrospect, idk how a pop team epic video led me to realize that i need to talk about my feelings. ok, i do know why, but regardless, i'm glad that i realized it bc i'm starting to feel a bit better
my therapist told me that even w/ a death, life goes on and you still gotta do what you gotta do, and she's right. w/ that being said, this is not an ideal week for me to have so many things to do than anyone else i know
part of me feels like i made a mistake asking to have the interview moved. i'm not getting any jobs i'm applying for anymore and idk if this'll affect my chances for this particular job
i usually have control over my emotions but i figured i'd talk about everything here and use this chat bc this is one of the rare times where that control isn't exactly there for me
i wish i could tell the discord user (from another server) what their words did to me and how they hurt, but i'm afraid to bc it wasn't actually their fault and it wasn't their intention at all
for anything that i have scheduled this week, i'm asking if i can reschedule, and i included the reason as to why this time
the funeral itself is one day, but everything surrounding the death isn't
i wanted to
i can't. bc of the school thing
ok i sent it
ok. i'll send another email specifying it
wdym?
i didn't tell them straight up that i needed time to grieve. i just said that something suddenly came up that conflicted w/ the interview
and i want it to, but it won't. i have to wake up at dawn and babysit someone bc school districts don't care about deaths in people's families
the commute to and from the interview may be the worst i've ever seen. i'd be fine w/ it if that was the only thing, but throw in the death of a loved one and everything i listed in my post above and i just can't tolerate anything anymore seemingly
ok. if you say so
something happened in another server that made me reach my breaking point. in a fit of rage, i have an interview in between the funeral, multiple wakes and lack of sleep, so i ended up asking them if i could reschedule it without considering whether or not this would affect my chances of getting the job
a declaration is just that. a declaration. it says something, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna start. i remember a war or 2 in the past that was never announced as being over, despite it actually being over. so i'm thinking that if that's the case at the end of a lot of wars, then i'm thinking the same could be said for the start of them
ok, so i misinterpreted
you guys don't...*want* war to happen, do you? i could be misunderstanding
is there anything i can tell myself so that i'm not uptight and anxious about this the whole day? i ask this especially bc i might be alone a lot today
i found this on reddit, and now i'm afraid. i'm also afraid to even go back to reddit after seeing this. i won't go into complete specifics but i have a particular phobia, which is what makes me fear this news/headline https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/xvw3r6/south_korea_and_us_fire_missiles_into_sea_in/
for example, that's why i've decided that if a company i applied for doesn't care about all the personal irl stuff i talked about here last night, then i'm gonna quit. just an example
if someone isn't nice to you, i'd say it's best to just ignore them, whether it'd be a country, person, etc.
or rather, start? w/ a question mark
alright. i'll keep that in mind
ok
> there's always been a lot of show-of-force between SK and NK
same w/ the US?
oh. ok. either way, that's my worry specifically
i worry less about the conflict, but moreso about dying from it
oh. this isn't the first time this headline has come up?
i'd say somewhere in the middle. prob doesn't deserve any hate, but it's not necessarily a random or out-of-the-blue choice for me either
i'll try to word this in the least venting way possible to avoid venting at all, but i like to look at anime casts, and if i see a recurring name after or while i'm having a bad day or night, instead of being annoyed like i usually am, i get angry. livid. i kinda feel like i'm reaching my breaking point just from seeing *1* name, and it's just a name
my parents are on vacation in aruba and said they'd come home if i got covid. if i get covid, i'd ruin their vacation and their break
it was for the whole haircut actually. not just a few secs
||i've had a recurring personal issue come up for me while i was at a barbershop today. for the past 2 1/2 years, i've always assumed that no matter where i am, if my mask falls or gets taken off while in a public place w/ a lot of other people, then i'll get covid. and so that happened again on my end and....yea, i'm not too thrilled or happy about it||
well let me explain. maybe description wasn't the best word. but basically, the way in which he described it is what made me question it. from his words, it sounded to me as though the intensity and work of this internship is comparable to, say, a sweatshop or an anime animation studio. that's why i wanna ask him more questions. the place where this internship's located is a place that i've been looking to work in, but i also don't want my job to be miserable either
the owner of a company i reached out to for potential work reasons suddenly called me tonight and presented me w/ an internship opportunity. however, his description of the job left me uneasy and even a little traumatized afterwards. i'm gonna call him tmrw to tie up loose ends and ask about more details regarding the internship, but i just hope that all goes well bc i don't think this started out the best for me exactly
rip
my job is awful, i can't talk to anybody inside or outside of work about it, and i don't have the courage to quit. idk what to do
how about....elon f**k
elon should have a nickname
my parents happened to be awake when i got home, so i talked about it w/ them for a while. they helped me understand that it was primarily the commute that was bad and that since i was mad from it, i was kinda dwelling on everything that was negative, whether it'd be the job, the commute, etc. i realized that nothing downright bad happened tonight at work, though i'm still feeling a bit...iffy. not about work but just in general
I’ve kinda had this notion in the back of my mind that the former is more important than the latter. I don’t want this to be true, but I can’t seem to convince myself otherwise
The only thing that’s getting me out of it is a prior obligation I have to attend or go to. There aren’t really any sick days or hours bc this temporary job started Monday and ends this weekend
I’m feeling that, but since I committed to it and the thing I’m working for is a team effort, I’m afraid to simply just leave or quit now. I *would* like to talk to my folks or my therapist about this, but the job ends late each night so I’m alone
This week, I have a job that’s 7 days a week, and things took a turn for the worst due to commuting issues. It’s gotten to a point where I’m questioning if I even wanna do this temporary job anymore. I feel legitimately miserable
Ok. I’ll try to vent as little or nonexistent as possible
No
I don’t wanna vent where I’m not supposed to, so could I talk to someone in DMs for support? Anyone?
someone's giving me crap for what anime i watch and i'm having a hard time not responding or getting involved
i'm only able to have a session w/ her once a week
there are plenty of moments during the day in which i can't talk to my dr bc she's busy. so w/ that in mind, idk how to break my covid-fearing habits after 2-3 years of it
i'm working at an after-school program and i just learned that someone who one of my students lives w/ got covid, but despite that, the student still came to school. am i necessarily at risk of getting it now? i've been wearing a mask at work every day since i started the job
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64003237
Ok. I’ll try
am i the only one who can't stand job prerequisites? i have the right experience and skills needed for so many jobs that i'd like to apply for, but the description is like 'nope, sorry, you don't have enough years of so and so to be considered or to apply.'
anyone could be anyone thanks to elon
In order to have or learn a coping method, I need help. And I have zero access to my folks or my therapist rn for varying reasons. I have 0 resources
I also asked in a discord support server and someone told me to sanitize everything. Once I get home, Idk what to do with my clothes and stuff in my pockets bc after they said that, I’m assuming that everything I now touch or wear will carry the virus
Yes I am
I was told to not text my parents bc they’re going thru a lot rn, so I resorted to google search. This has never ended well for me bc it says that literally everything will get whatever medical thing I’m worried about, and this google search was no different
Everything is falling apart at my workplace today. One of my students got a stomach virus and even though I wore a mask, I’m kinda convincing myself that now I’m gonna get it from him
At the school I’m working at, the people working in the main office apparently bail as soon as the school day is over. I feel like someone should stay in there for after school stuff, no?
i need to tell my coworker and/or my boss that i'm having a very hard time w/ my job rn, but i'm afraid to say anything regarding that. idk what to do, and i think it's starting to make me depressed
Does anyone else hate the YouTube algorithm? I don’t know if this happens to anyone else but everything I upload goes under the radar. It’s mostly music stuff but still
well, i've decided that i'm gonna quit my job. long story short, i've kinda felt trapped w/ this one bc i have a coworker and they should be looking for someone to replace her. but some bad stuff happened at work today so i decided that the buck stops here. they haven't helped me at all, that's for sure, so i'm just done
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/long-covid-now-looks-like-a-neurological-disease-helping-doctors-to-focus-treatments/ i'm not exactly able to leave that article title alone now that i've seen that headline in another discord server, but should we be afraid again? like for our lives?
a bunch of reasons:
1) they're coming to me so that they don't get in trouble and have signed bus passes from me (at this school, students aren't allowed to come back in after they leave once the school day is over)
2) they come whenever they want to. there's a rule that my partner/co-worker told me that we leave if no one shows up or is in after a certain point in time. so i leave and follow this rule like i'm supposed to, and then they ask 'can you let us in?' i'm not letting them in when they're coming in 1hr20min late and no other students are here
so i realized that some of the kids i'm watching at my after-school job, who aren't even in the group/club i teach, have been taking advantage of me. how fun
so my students tampered w/ both classroom supplies and computer equipment today. i'm not taking that lying down!
short fiction submissions to what though?
well she's also *the* voice of eevee now, if that's somethin
i'm fine w/ her as hibiki bc her voice/performance in this reminds me of tomoyo kurosawa, who's one of my favs
anyhoo,
i haven't kept track
the hollywood equivalent that comes to my mind would prob be the rock, who's also in hundreds of stuff nowadays
it's just that she seems to be in every anime ever
it's not necessarily the voice itself. if a voice or an actor is flexible, i'm fine w/ that
there's this 1 seiyuu in which every time i come across a random anime i never heard of, she's in almost every single one. i'm ok w/ her in symphogear, but i'm getting a *liiiittle* fatigued
even if they didn't even grow up w/ older anime?
but what's w/ the constant 'this anime is awful' reviews left and right? (not just for this anime)
it's like the 4chan of anime
if you look at the reviews shown for every show on MAL, you'll eventually learn that people on that site rarely like any anime ever
the comparison is that they're everywhere. that's why i used god madoka instead of regular madoka for the comparison
hence my comparison between her and madokami in the other server lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg8dt27LlMQ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_h1EgigtAM
almost reminds me of a story i heard in driver's ed
a gif in another server reminded me of an anime i saw recently where a girl was drifting in a truck on a mountainside. though i'm kinda wondering how she got said truck if she doesn't even have a license
this is unrelated but is aquatope the only 24-episode anime in a while? the ones i can think of are only the usual 12/13-ep length
good subplots, at least? or is it unknown atm?
came out this year, i presume?
hopefully aquatope delivers if i watch it at some point. that came out this year as well
i'm only referring to stuff coming out this year. i'm excluding anything prior to 2021
w/ all the news coming in for any anime i've watched so far this year, has there been any anime that has delivered from beginning to end and didn't half-ass it?
only 1/4 of the anime gets truly insane, but that 1/4 grabbed me
no, it's unrelated to monogatari
anyone heard of animegataris?
tfw you got hooked on an anime in some way and it doesn't have its own discord server
sounds much more fun
though i will say, if i got to play an anime character in HS or college instead of go to school, i honestly would
ahh
i sorta compare it to western stuff in that in western stuff, if you can play the part appropriately whether it's in live-action or animation or whatever else, you can play it. for an anime, most of the cast is in their 20s w/ few exceptions. i'm not against it but i just find it a bit odd
like 'you have to be *this age or lower*, etc. to play this role'
i noticed something about anime casting after looking at the casts of a lot of diff anime, and i'm kinda wondering if there's a trend or requirement of sorts for a seiyuu to get a lead role or significant role in an anime
https://imgur.com/a/64pos3e
from her especially
any emotion and intensity she needed sounded pretty genuine when i watched it
tomoyo (itsuki) doesn't get to do much in yuyuyu as she does in LotL and hibike. but hey, some roles and gigs are better than others in the long run
but it's moreso quality over quantity of roles in this case
actually i was referring to just her
going thru all of the seiyuu, i think yuuna's is one of the GOAT
i think they're referring to the monogatari server
it's 9 episodes of 'eh we're just chilling out/SoL,' then 3 episodes of 'WHAT IS HAPPENING?!'
the things they show these days
very start of pokemon anime in US: 1998
first movie in US: '99

just 1 year in between? how does that work?
reminds me of sin city. that movie supposedly did that color scheming too

either that or eggman did it
and thank goodness for that
i found a review of an anime movie in which the guy referred to all anime as meaning 'bad animation.' thankfully, he has gone to not review anime again
Guess we’ll just have to wait and see
here's *an* anime
https://youtu.be/uWF6UBz9Amc
why do anilist and i always have the opposite opinions on most anime i watch?
https://twitter.com/sugoilite/status/1455543368415596545?s=21
so it's kinda like the rock
well *aside* from that reason
w/ all due respect, why is aoi yuuki in literally every anime i come across?
so it's like madoka...ish?
/ all of the conflicting pics and gifs, i have no idea what higurashi is supposed to be. a comedy? a horror/slasher thing? what is it?
this doesn't feel like a 2011 anime to me for some reason https://youtu.be/k7OsR4Q1lPM
what show is this?
nice art
https://twitter.com/NetflixAnime/status/1467981757899472897?t=XuSmbvCibNV2ciRI5m8qNg&s=19
ugh i forget everything
w/ all due respect, i'm honestly starting to get a little frustrated where i come across random anime that i suddenly discover on discord or internet or anywhere else, and aoi yuki is in every. single. one. it's a little fatiguing
this is unrelated but i just wanted to spill this
wait. officially?
thankfully the uproar isn't bad as it was w/ the 4kids movies
pikachu's voice hasn't changed, but ash's has
at least for that show
the same thing happened w/ pokemon but that didn't seem to kill it
i know pokemon moved to netflix iirc
that'd be a shame if so. so hopefully not
i remember digimon being on various networks in the US and then it just disappeared. did hype go down for it or something?
ghost game as in digimon?
https://youtu.be/VOYq5bmAUjk guess who's back. back again
this is unrelated but
the last thing i wanna do is compare him and his act to real-life terrorist acts
but anyway, i should leave it at that. i realized it's not good to deal w/ bad anime/fictional stuff and bad irl stuff at the same time
fuck him
though it does give me an idea for a fanfic
and this is a work of fiction
just take my opinion on it w/ a grain of salt bc it's kinda similar to my thoughts about some irl figures
i revisited SAO after a while and i realized something: the creator of the game seems to be someone who commits mass genocide and suffers no repercussions at all. that's...kinda sickening, honestly
i know dubs aren't everyone's cup of tea, but if you're interested, check out this VA's life and career story. it's a nice story https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPFt1B7xVms

https://ranking.net/rankings/best-anime-production-companies
https://c.tenor.com/Hgt-mT0KXN0AAAAM/chtholly-tiat.gif what anime is this?
> The Genius Prince`s Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt
yep. that's an LN
ahh, those were the good saturdays, i will admit. just chilling and watching saturday-morning tv
the original japanese ost is actually used a lot in the game Kirby Air Ride. you get to hear a bunch of songs from the original version of the anime in that game regardless of where in the world you're playing it
i wonder if there's a smash mod w/ that voice
so this company seems to be loathed by pretty much the entire world, so i'm curious. what do you guys think in regards to anime when you see this company's name attached to it?
in imax
1-2 months in the states, so yea. pretty much
prob not
possibly 3 if sao is still around
this is unrelated but every time i learn or discuss the fact that an anime or an anime movie is a musical, my mind goes to something else
since it directs me to local ones over by me
i guess that makes sense in the UK
it just lists the options from the other cinema or ticket sites?
so it doesn't make much of a difference then?
yeah. i wanna see both. the US' distributor for the movie has tickets as an option listed on their site. should i try that?
i know
i'm prob gonna see belle
*in the theater, that is
i'm not saying they don't. i'm moreso thinking in regards to the whole 'there is zero way to protect yourself in your life from other people screwing up' thing
is it better to buy tickets online or on an app? or does that not really affect those chances?
i might wanna see an anime movie at some point soon, but something just dawned on me. sometimes a person buys a ticket for one version of the movie, only to be shown a different version (like subbed vs. not subbed). how do i avoid that?
Positive bc they’re still remembered for something else?
so they're dubbing the songs in both belle and sing a bit of harmony. i can't really pass judgment on the latter since there aren't too many singing clips out *yet*, but thankfully, both the jpn and eng versions of belle's songs sound incredible
this is unrelated but
i guess never say never
no big or mainstream manga or LN that i can think of has *not* gotten an anime adaptation
well then
behind kirby, i'd prob go w/...sonic x. maybe
in the past, i kept wondering: why is aoi yuuki in everything?
in the present, i'm wondering: why is sora amimiya in everything?
even if they sing in it?
f
though i guess one has to be lucky in regards to what theaters show what
anyway, the reason why you don't have to drive a while to see an imax is bc it might not be a TRUE imax. some imax screens are only slightly bigger than those giant-screen cinemas (non-imax) have, which are twice as big as a normal screen. the TRUE imax screens, on the other hand, are 4x the size of a normal screen
sony owns gkids too?
i guess GKIDS knows what they're doing
eleven arts did the same thing w/ hibike euphonium in 2019
the latter's only being released in theaters overseas for like 5 seconds
actually, you don't necessarily have to. can i give the reason why if it's not anime-related but still pertains to the convo?
https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/336310266654490624/942118894125064263 sorry to barge in but how is this a spoiler? 🤔
i just discovered the anime 'school live' and it's like a bunch of anime, video games and live-action stuff was blended into one show
most people do
i think digimon recently introduced the weeb to end all weebs. i'm not watching it, but basically, a kid got his master's at 13, and he went back to japan bc - get this - he wanted to live the anime school life
ooh, i found a random new anime
*aoi yuuki's in it for the millionth time*
STOOOOP!
i'd call WEP a passion project but by the end, was it really?
most anime are adaptations so that might be a bit tough
who or what decides whether or not an anime gets a s2?
but i don't think streaming makes *enough* money for studios necessarily
could a project be both?
i thought most anime studios only care for the most part about sales?
in those
technically they sing as said characters
you're too old? i'm practically older than everyone i meet on discord. ...for the most part
VHS? 🤔
well then i guess an OVA can be anything they want it to be
are they just continuing the story for the plot and the series' sake?
what if an anime company isn't super broke and they do an OVA?
is that clip above also from demon girl or from a diff anime?
well both countries are different
ahh. UK ratings
maybe that episode is one of the few exceptions
which site?
i don't remember that off the top of my head, but take that warning as you will. though i'm thinking it's prob not *too* extreme since the show is TV-14 and not TV-MA
what about it?
is bisque doll My Dress-Up Darling? that's all that comes up on google search
what show is that pic from?
check out the dub for a show called kare kano, aka 'his and her circumstances.' a bunch of pokemon VAs are in that anime too and they bring their A-game to it. like cowboy bebop dub levels of A-game
come to think of it, i wonder if 4kids had any other anime besides pokemon when they first started out
nothing was really set in stone yet
any channel or whatever else was fair game
i think in the earlier 90s and beforehand, you could find an anime anywhere
where are you located? that might affect that and what rating you get
so due to the 18 rating, the site you're trying isn't letting you watch the ep?
https://twitter.com/yurucamp_anime/status/1499319712815063041?s=21
some of the other episodes can't even compare
I just remembered s1 of ZLS having one of the best climaxes I’ve ever seen in anime
it's the 10th anniversary of kill me baby. everything in that anime has aged gracefully. ...except for the op
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1507604221469757441 i thought kancolle was girls und boats/fleets, but this poster seems to look more epic than that. what is it really about?
since someone on another server i'm in brought up school-live the other day, i think a part of me wants to watch the anime again
so wouldn't gunbuster be more of a time thing than gravity?
oh here we go. 'Patema Inverted'
there's an anime movie w/ people living in 2 different gravities. i can't remember the name
from school-live. 10/10 spelling
so i have finished my 'revisiting' of school-live, as i have finished the last chapter after reading for a couple of hours or so. i finished both the anime and the manga. ever feel like the world around you just stops bc a story is just so good?
i have no idea what's going on in love live, but someone in another server i'm in showed a preview that was unlike any LL stuff i've ever seen. i won't spoil, but it looked cool
the whole thing is very movie-like which i like
btw, if anyone has seen or heard of sora yori, check out its ost. it's really, *really* good
not sure. i'm open to anything.
i can't decide what other anime i should get into. i revisited 2 really good ones so idk where to start
i checked out the movie belle again. that film is just so enthralling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSczQHYeU38
https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/838534
i'm gonna start checking out Hakumei to Mikochi. premise reminds me of pikmin
what anime is it?
i found another anime called rideback. it's somewhat old but it's pretty action-packed imo
4 stars looks promising
all i know is it's mobile. though it's prob
apparently it's based off a game
ooh this oughta lighten things up
i never thought this would happen, but i've gotten so overexposed to someone (in anime) i've heard and seen more than anyone before that...she's starting to annoy me tbh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISh84oSZTt0 so i've been laughing at sub clips of chika for a while, but i stumbled across a dub clip. and...i will admit, she's pretty funny in english too
if the last one isn't, then now i'm curious where else a113 can be found in movies
i mostly knew about the truck, the ball w/ the star on it, and 'A113'
also yes, that's the answer
0_0 how did you figure it out so quickly?
this is something that's apparently in all pixar movies. without looking anything up, can you guess what it is?

while a character in non non biyori was on a massage chair shaking, the subtitles shook as well. it was kinda cute
there was one other pic from the anime i saw online that seemed pretty dramatic...ish
looking at the gifs of Yuyushiki, is it supposed to be like nichijou at times? https://tenor.com/view/yuyushiki-happy-stary-eyes-anime-explosion-gif-11909231
lol
gives me vibes of this
https://tenor.com/view/spaceballs-confused-huh-what-camera-gif-17264159
in regards to the anime i brought up before, i was told about r/whatanime elsewhere so i'm gonna try that. hopefully something will pop up
yea. it could be anything. but ty for the help though
something like that
there were 3 kids (2 boys and a girl), and they had ancient weapons. one was a beam sword kinda like a light saber. also the anime seemed to be from either the 90s or 80s
how come?
i'm trying to find an old anime, but everything i remember from it is so vague that i can't find it online
so i saw a bit of revue and i'm confused about ||the underground railway system, the entire tokyo tower underground, and the talking giraffe||. or is it supposed to be a bit nonsensical?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISh84oSZTt0 is it bad that this is in english and yet i still find her kinda funny?
apparently the show that that pic is from is mediocre
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HotVyn3uDHY
reality be broken
every show i'm interested in on anilist, anilist users hate. idk why it happens so often
'it's like an anime where the characters are in different framerates, and then there's gonna be a *3d* scene, and then they're still gonna be in like *2d, 15fps*'
my mind often goes back to what a channel called microwave society said about anime animation bc i find that's often true to some extent
that gif's from D4DJ. isn't that show completely cg?
that first pic of healer girl from before oddly reminded me of yuuki yuuna initially
from their pov's, i guess
the notion i got from mal reviewers is that 7 or lower sucks
though some reviews i've seen on mal are just crybabies tbh
so *this* is how mal users rate anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GRYa_3gno
idk where else to put this https://twitter.com/SugoiLITE/status/1527644241274744832

https://youtu.be/eRYazzXViJw
unrelated but
watching more anime, i'm starting to familiarize myself w/ other names in the seiyuu world. idk *how* famous they are, but their names are inori minase, ayane sakura, and nao toyama
that pic is giving me 'here's johnny' vibes

how is this for kids??
more movies coming out https://youtu.be/iGL4ETxVKd8

what is this from?
so then what show is it?
i'm confused. is this still the same show as https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/371105434771390465/987496043098832907 ?
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
...ish?
so essentially it was style over substance?
ty
jeez, saucenao freaking sucks. anyone know where this is from?
i saw this in a video and i was curious where it was from but i can't search for it bc it's tilted
you can't say the d word on the internet. people will come after you https://youtu.be/g5ru4KtvLrs

https://youtu.be/4ec3dV3QjBw
it's been so popular on the whole site to a level comparable to, say, when frozen originally came out
i asked this elsewhere already, but is lycoris like...the *only* anime out this summer?
TIL thomas is in kaguya https://youtu.be/9JdnPhF_wiI
konami code at light-speed
TIL yoko hikasa is in the anime Campione!
how is all of discord obsessed w/ lyroreco at the exact same time?
idk what this show is (yet), but the CR dubs yt channel has been making some pretty funny title and thumbnail combos as of late. i gotta hand it to them https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELtjg7yC41Y

also CR used people's money to vomit up high guardian spice
ok, *aside* from 🏴‍☠️
where else can i watch LR though?
i know
i'm just a little annoyed w/ crunchyroll limiting some recoil stuff to members who signed up for the site and whatnot
https://tenor.com/view/let-me-in-eric-andre-wanna-come-in-gif-13730108

if chisato wants to drive so much, why not do it? she should be old enough to have a license iirc
https://tenor.com/view/he-man-i-have-the-power-sword-gif-5305079
more of this show is great. will this be s2 or part of s1?
also i'm glad i wasn't the only person who thought of this in my head https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlC0s5v0d8U
looking around discord, how did lycoreco grab the attention of certain servers while not so much w/ others?
ty
what is this from again?
revue's pretty popular elsewhere that i visit online so you might enjoy this vid https://youtu.be/vjSD8hTnggY
https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/407060923078017026/1014951180943773767 so are most people familiar w/ this anime? i kept assuming no but...idk
almost seems like the career path isn't even worth it
they really got find companies that have good working conditions before signing up to one. almost every one of them seems comparable to a sweatshop or something
https://tenor.com/view/nacho-why-confused-jack-black-gif-8714598
was this bob chapek's idea? or lasseter's?
for some reason, i've been thinking that the title 'love is war' seems kinda dramatic for a simple SoL anime. what do you think?
i thought they did. some of the voice clips sounded produced when i heard them. outside of the songs, that is
either that or her regular vocaloid voice
i said edgerunners when i should've said cyberpunk edgerunners. my bad
sad to say, but...yea
aoi yuuki
this one seiyuu is just in...every anime. when i saw the cast for the new edgerunners anime, i literally groaned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg-dlFofC5U
https://vxtwitter.com/KorewaEden_/status/1570790887206289411?t=mohbCnayVAtbedRud2i8sA&s=19 what show has this engrish?
a head tilt? yep. shaft definitely made that anime
note to self: look for that to get into the season's story
it got a pretty good score
huh. let me see the mal score. one sec
perhaps, but 3 seasons is not too shabby
nah, i'm fine w/ the anime. they're actually adapting a lot of it instead of doing just 1 cour and calling it quits forever like a lot of other anime
so i was revisiting an anime called 'ascendance of a bookworm,' which i like. the protag is trying to remember where she's from, and i'm thinking 'it's an isekai, where do you think she's from?' lo and behold, i was right: ||japan||
promare reminded me of suicide squad. idk why
it should be put on the side of hibiki's shared role
'and 249 others'
what am i looking at?
the little rascals
let me guess. LN adaptation?
https://twitter.com/ProZD/status/1575344129441046528?t=foOrpW0MpXfB2zhEgVFsLw&s=19 kana hanazawa's gonna be in this movie
so just go w/ the flow?
||and the tower suddenly being a rocket that lands in the desert|| bc why not
trumpet players in school are worse
is that what she's so distraught about?
i watched the revue movie a while back and i'm still confused by that movie
video game adaptations can be hit or miss. or both
outside of anime too
what if you try the 3-episode rule? a lot of people seem to like that rule
and now, ...well, you get the picture
i was revisiting magia record. still wasn't perfect after seeing it again, but i found myself having a good time watching it
https://tenor.com/view/laugh-laughing-knee-slap-lol-gif-10766177

what anime is this from?

i came across a movie called drifting home. looks interesting. guess i'll take a plunge

revue's whatever you want it to be
but they literally have idol concerts. well, irl, that is
maya: this is maya tendo
channel: *dies of laughter and wheezing*
theater + idol = revue
also the va of the protag, i've come to like her work. she's a fun voice
is it the same va?
this one reaction channel i saw on youtube didn't like nana's VA and kept comparing her to a smoker. not entirely sure why but i guess you can't win em all

saw a 3d camera pan in weathering w/ you. looked pretty cool honestly
looking at that coaster, ...yea no, i ain't riding that
y'know, he who smelt it....well, y'know
also aoi yuuki is one of the reasons why i have anger management issues
lots of anime get an abridged. now it's lycoreco's turn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZvRPVhOb74
also, looking at the cast, the seiyuu for sayaka from madoka magica was an idol? huh. the more you know
Idol Master xenoglossia
i'm guessing the idolmaster mech show didn't do much compared to macross and gear
now i get it. ||the character's late dad built the robot, so he must've put that message in there||
ahh ok
i'm spoiler-tagging this just in case, but in into the spider verse, there's a brief message that the robot gives. does it anyone know what it says? i'm having no luck w/ google
why space the show and movie viewings out?
i guess this is appropriate: d'oh!
i turn my back to watch the weird simpsons anime/death note thing that they made and then i miss something elsewhere

i won't go into full details here but i'm legit starting to get pissed off w/ how frequent i come across her
every freaking anime i come across! just stop being in everything!
Started an anime called talentless nana. So far so good. Might watch more of it later at home
i'm watching a higurashi episode in which ||a private school is also a prison||. i won't say too much since this isn't <#336297840529899522> but i find it utterly disgusting

though varied is good
gundam seems like a versatile and varied franchise looking at all the clips and images here
wikipedia said he did the 90s one
found it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(1994_TV_series)
it's like when the happy tree friends writers killed the sonic franchise for a little while. but that's another story
yea i don't think this is the right choice for a serious DC cartoon

not that i know of. so then their material prob sucks
one of these names might be fair game
for something to be bad, you gotta find the source. the culprit
who? some raider?
btw i don't think marvel animation is making spiderverse 2. i think that's sony pictures animation's doing primarily
thankfully zack snyder hasn't touched DC's animation stuff
i thought of another show but then remembered it was live-action: daredevil
maybe 4
speaking of marvel animation
i can recall maybe 2-3 marvel cartoons and that's it
that reminds me. i started spy x family. it's funny and charming
pretty rockin song
it's like the wii u of viacom
ahh memories of being....prob the nicktoons channel's only viewer years ago in my entire state
it was on nicktoons when paramount did all the mcu stuff. then disney xd once disney took over
nah, that one was pretty good
the show was 'iron man: armored adventures'
thankfully they learned from that and put a future marvel cartoon on nicktoons instead. that just makes more sense
put it on MTV2 instead. that channel doesn't have *any* set style imo
oh it did? odd
well who's gonna rush to mtv to watch a cartoon anyway?
yea
i was gonna say something about another show and then i forgot
more power to him
including, believe it not, neil patrick harris. he voiced spiderman at one point
1 spiderman video game had 4 of the cartoon VAs
no i know it
had to go afk for a while. i'll give you the pasta: ||TOSHISHITA NO SENPAI||
i came across a manga i'm reading now that has an interesting premise, but it's so lewd at times. like rated-R lewd
why sadly?
i did and it didn't work
how does one get a bocchi the rock song out of their head?
it's kinda like how they came up w/ titles in codename kids next door. w/ a bunch of acronyms
yep, def not the one i was thinking of
i feel like i've seen or heard of it before but part of me thinks otherwise
what manga is that?
a gundam play? how does one do that?
so is this a new trend in the anime industry? a bunch of anime are getting musicals now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b24TfwybajQ
what would you say is *the* anime of this season? DIY, bocchi, or something else?
for some reason i thought roy was goe
he has stayed the same age for 2 decades so i guess that makes sense. have they given the newbie a name yet?
I doubt ash will stop. Plenty of irl sports champions keep playing. Plus he’s still prob gotta deal with team rocket
https://youtu.be/NdWFitNUsMw
the nostalgia critic once said that ash 'has the personality of sandpaper'
So no pressure
Ash has also died multiple times (typo. darn it, siri)
going back to
> The big question is what will happen to Jessie and James and Meowth. Are they also gonna get retired or follow the new protags
i don't see those 3 as folks that know when to quit
phew. the beginning of spy x family part 2 is intense!
https://vxtwitter.com/melzigatari/status/1601877625546358785
dw i got it, i got it
looks like it has a lot of meme potential. this and 2-3 other servers are going nuts over bocchi this weekend
STRIKE!

NICE THROW
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5le-BaNH-Y
or at least getting the hang of it
i think i'm getting good at this. i was able to tell that the image was from ||DIY|| bc of one of the girls' hair
bocchi might become anime of the season

i'm so confused bc i thought kancolle was about ships but this image is making me think it's like star wars
https://youtu.be/LfdwwZOUrGE
i'm thinking of what AOTY is gonna be. i'm thinking lycoreco or spy x family but everyone's telling me 'bocchi, bocchi, bocchi'
https://twitter.com/catsuka/status/1607734481481334784?s=20&t=kZNb8QodJJ0OcE2R7mahjw
videogame adaptations don't exactly have a high bar
is this the bocchi chat now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVRpNAxBiXI hard to believe that this is completely fanmade
i ended up skipping ahead w/ astra lost in space. idk when i'll see it all in full, but i just wanted to see who was, well, ||sus||
ooh i gotta check that one out
sure. we can go w/ that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbpNiDxSJgE i really like this show

bocchi in front of everything? jeez
now that's what i call a wild card poll
there's a magireCo and a magireVo?
https://youtu.be/DGD1NPn0kGg
finished. good movie
i might spend my new years night watching patema inverted
started the devil is a part-timer. fun little romp so far
spongebob is the best anime https://twitter.com/MJs__0707/status/1564778466951794689
https://tenor.com/view/shrek-donkey-shut-up-two-gif-13716529
tell the haters or bullies
I was thinking after seeing this. I think the movie patema inverted would make a good source for a live-action adaptation. Can you imagine what regular and inverted gravity would be like in live-action? I think it’d be cool, and prob technically impressive
i haven't seen yuki yuna s3 yet, but what the heck is this?
deja vu!
so that makes 6 anime seiyuu names i'm seeing a lot. for better or worse
idk if this is good or bad but i'm noticing another recurring name in a lot of anime i'm coming across: rie takahashi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi79l5k8gBM some of the ones in this vid are insane
> The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady
like how can this not be an LN title?
> The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady
where's a nickname for a LN anime series when you need one?
image search stuff not working again
what is that from?
what's this from?
i mean yea, it was jank, but don't folks know not to judge a book only by its cover?
this is unrelated but i was watching devil's a part-timer s2 and went on the subreddit. for some reason, for 1 episode, the animation was so wonky that it distracted the users from what the rest of the episode had to offer
so essentially, the industry is having a meltdown?
just revisited a bit of yuki yuna is a hero just for fun. and man, yuna's seiyuu has gotta be one of the goats
so i usually get anime recommended on youtube videos, but i got a non-anime recommendation this time. i guess i'll see what 'cats don't dance' is all about
i'll watch it *if* discord (as a whole) stops spamming it
what, the precure pic or what i said?
TIL gravity falls had a DDLC/FNAF episode. before either of those existed
just watched typhoon noruda. short, but sweet
yea that adds up
i'm revisiting girls und panzer. why is the attendance girl kind of a bitch?
so oreimo started it? or it's just an example?
i kinda wonder where it all started. like who was the first author to go 'oh yea, this is how we're gonna do these novel titles from now on'
https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/371105434771390465/1063100496346349578 this one
really any. though in this particular case, (one sec)
i keep shaking my head at how long some of these LN titles can be
just started bofuri. good so far. i know it's not the full name but it's a mouthful
didn't grab me
i mean i know i've been avoiding it
idk if this is expected or not, but i was looking up the reviews for velma and those for space jam 2. velma somehow scores higher
iirc they all were
the topic by itself isn't bad
the creator of HGS wasn't a transphobe, *but* he and a lot of the writers kinda dabbled in that topic, and it kinda hurt that show, in addition to everything else
so it's high guardian spice all over again
Hakumei to Mikochi is a cute little anime. i'm revisiting it
more isekai
i've scene a yuuki voice a yuuki, an azusa voice an azusa, and a sakura voice a sakura
https://tenor.com/view/sir-mix-alot-big-butts-gif-19551628
a manga outdoing the LNs. huh.
> The Hero King, Reincarnated to Master Martial Arts — Thus Becoming the World's Strongest Female Knight-in-Training
is this the longest title yet?
discotek: this is gonna be bigger than any year prior
internet: are you gonna dub symphogear?
discotek: NO, NO, for the THOUSANDTH TIME, NO!
chisato, what are you doing??
also this is chris' seiyuu singing
https://youtu.be/gXAvushxa30 this is called healer girl. they apparently have power through music. would that make it a spiritual successor to symphogear?
play the OP, play the OP, play the OP now
oh yea. flea too
now if i can just dissociate slap bass from sonic music
i heard it stinks

2 musical anime discoveries in one night. sweet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbF4s7jTiEo
though it's prob more up my alley than others since it's a musical
but why? it seems fine to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyBv8w5uy5g now it's fitnessgram pacer test: the musical
well there ya go
there's plenty of animated competition https://youtu.be/tqaHBfBSSuc?t=39
though it's not the best musical out there necessarily
well i finished healer girl. not revolutionary but i liked it

i have 4 weeks of no work and no internet at, well, work, and now i have 9-10 anime i can watch. hopefully these will tie me over
okey
I found 3 shows I’m prob gonna watch whenever I’m bored at work: average abilities, endro, and the asterisk war. A pink-haired trio

kancolle's production - wait for it - sunk
that mom has good taste
i'm watching bofuri. nice name pun
MAL gave it a 7.something
what's w/ the discord resurgence of cross ange if the show sucks?
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjDDP2sOIbQ||
i wish HS didn't ruin reading for me so i could read manga to continue the story/stories
amazing show
yuyuyu reminds me. it's a shame they didn't dub much of it. they did a pretty good job w/ what they did do (just s1)
if school grading was based on anime grading, we'd all have Fs
tbf, anime-grading can be, well, tough

not even she could save it?
promare reminds me of suicide squad. not 100% sure why

way to go, nana
well i've seen this server obsess over nana before so this is prob in line w/ everything else in the server. well, prob
lol i thought i was the only one who saw the resemblance XD
the guy on the left for some reason reminds me of an enemy from yoshi's island
i was in a similar boat too
from oshi no ko
speaking of yuru camp, that reminds me. i wonder why they decided to dub s1 and then just bailed after that

idk why but buddy daddies isn't grabbing me as much as SxF did. still cute though
are these pictures actually shirabe or are they from another series?
backstory time for the 'average abilities' anime which i'm watching now. it's a comedy but things might be getting serious
c'mon keanu, get movin
after s1's success, why not?
mhm
lupin: and i'm here too!
well i think my anti-aoi yuuki train or phase or whatever you wanna call it has finally passed, *but* now i'm getting a little sick of another seiyuu in her place
discotek is missing one more anime. i know they won't do it but still
if he's playing a villain, then we might get to hear his eggman voice
ooh kayli, i like her work
got confirmed elsewhere just now. ty
what is this from?
odd that one got a s2 and not the other
so it's like pixar's a bug's life and dreamworks' antz coming out at the same time against each other
i'm watching asterisk war and chivalry of a failed knight, and i'm mixing them up since they're pretty similar to each other (imo). i still like them. though chivalry episode 2 is pretty kinky, without giving anything away
i finished s1 and the movie of made in abyss. it left me speechless
btw i still think you were

sailor moon apparently has some lyrics from Danger Zone in it
lycoreco is posted 3 times. meanwhile bocchi the rock is posted 3 octillion times
sorry about that. didn't realize it was posted here already

picked up on 'saving 80k gold.' pretty fun imo and charming

in other idol concerts, the crowd after a song is often like 'yayyy...i guess' and then silence
one of their reunion concerts was prob the loudest japanese concert (or one of the loudest) ever caught on video
i'd have to ask the k-on fandom. they'd prob know
...well unless she faked it
speaking of her, as a musician, i find playing a left-hand bass when you're a righty to make no sense
well there ya go
does she voice-act in AOT?
ah. mio

oh no, not the demon slayer TRUE OP. this was her ringtone
i gotta introduce my sister to some other anime music. the stuff she's listening to all sounds the same

either my sister is listening to a lot of radwimps lately, or every male j-rock/j-pop singer sounds like him

so i started about 4-7 diff anime this week, and every single anime OP sounded the same. where's the music variety?
GuP's OP and an OP elsewhere made me think of a good question:
think of an anime OP or ED song that does *not* sound like another existing OP or ED
anyone else have someone they know who won't stop singing a song to the point where you never wanna hear it again?
