hi! been playing etrian and found the pic
So then Kirika killed god's soul once? Interesting
honestly back in AXZ I was expecting that to happen with SG's group or at the very least with Adam
I want those 3 to job and get killed to make the villain look better, I really don't want more alchemists
||Shut up, let me dream||
they're fodder, that's why they look unimpressive
we trascend dimensions and include serena and kanade?
but don't think they will
I mean I would be ecstatic because I'm a sucker for that shit
dont think so either, just random thought
what if they go full anime cliche and last battle song is Synchrogazer again instead of the OP of the season?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
the beef stroganoff is there either because of troll factor, someone lost a bet or someone dared Kaneko/Ono to put it in
ok, no
the troll now is that the entire cast dies, no one will see it coming!
the amount of rage that would ensue would be impressive
"we couldn't choose which one to use, so we threw all of them"
just wait, she's gonna get the sniper out and get sniped herself by something before she gets the chance to pull the trigger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzGUN84B0eg
did someone mention quality animation?
not sacrifice per-se but you get the idea
bikki's gonna be like
because they're evil beings that like toying with your heart
But that's just my wishful thinking speaking
Well as I said, I don't think they're forced to keep the status quo completely unless they're planning to have movies or something later on
but episode 12 just makes me rage to irrational levels
don't get me wrong, overall I liked AXZ
god fucking dammit you cannot deflate my hype on the final episodes
but fuck giant hibiki
what with having to shill 2 versions of each song and all
at least new form got rid of something that was becoming cancerous
the first half especially
the entirety of AXZ ep 12 is my most hated part of the entire series
oh that's not even my main AXZ salt
have murica bad
no, that would be too good
what with having them suicide to a random nuke instead of, oh I dunno, THE VILLAIN OF THE SEASON
after how AXZ ep 12 was handled it's clear even the guys running the show don't want to do anything interesting with them anymore
that's just my salt speaking tho
honestly the sooner for me they're done with even more alchemists the better
also last season and all
though to be fair, had they not teased Custodians with Adam's last words I wouldn't be saying any of this
inb4 they job to the beam in the PV, we don't even get a shred of angst from them, they were pulling a Kanade but with villains this time
obviously the 3 new illuminati
lol
I've said this ad nauseam already but those three practically sound like they're just made to job so that the actual villain looks more threatening without having to kill one of the good guys too early
I mean if they really do mean it when they say it's the last season they can get away with burning one figurative bridge with the fans that get pissed at their favorite character kicking the bucket, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Dj5G1kaqI
obligatory
give it time, maybe Crunchy will pull a GX so it'll get use for a month or so
Custodian is the species, "God" as mentioned by Fine is probably the Custodian that's acting as their leader
lol
Genjuro is so not walking out alive if he tries to pull a S1 in the supposedly last season
(just guessing from PV and the comments)
that depends on whether the hype fight is the same one where they job to beam-kun
Twitter comments say that fight was hype and that it feels like it's the final season from the first episode, so probably well recieved, first episodes have never been an issue with this franchise anyways.
||I'll show myself out now||
Yes they were fine, well not this one really but she thought she was for a while back then
relax, they'll be fine
||She's a Custodian, you're a Custodian, I'm a Custodian, everyone's a Custodian!||
so long as we don't get one dollar south park walk cycle again...
oh yeah also relevant image for XV
Genjuro would be that one actor who just acts like himself
so Ver is actually a subdued person?
so if they were trying to shill it was pretty ineffective
the gear I mean
I mean I did not know that it was referencing the game and just assumed was one of the many things that get explained in a keyword
inb4 cliffhanger XV ending that transitions into radio silence for years and then adaptation of the mobage
congrats, you just handed Ver the world
We already had literal illuminati confirmed pulling the strings in the series, could be anything from a media reference to some conspiracy theory
1 am of the 7th in japan which is 24 hours and 11 minutes from now, give or take a minute or two if my clock is off and no, I will not use the 25.00 madness that's just silly
and technically somewhere it's dawn
it's 11.46 here
I was waiting for the exact minute but fuck it you guys called it already so posting it now
spoiler: the casket surfaces in Val Verde, thus it's both midsummer where it appears and winter in SONG HQ
(after whenever CR puts up theirs I mean)
an hour after or so I think?
not really long if Horrible Subs is auto ripping stuff
Glorious Break did nothing for me, and count me in the wanting Synchrogazer at the end of XV camp, I'm just a sucker for that cliche
sounds more like something Carol would throw out tbh
that's what I was getting at
yar har
(unless you actually speak japanese of course)
is there any point to watching raws this time around assuming CR isn't terribly delayed?
that as well, just business as usual
yeah that
I just assumed it was another insert song like the bajillion that we already have?
13 hours, 20 minutes for the japanese broadcast
ok, too tempted by those black bars, time to bail until a few hours more
well ep1 in S1 had the op
but it doesn't play here
yes
It's X-Drive, don't have to explain shit
||So southern hemisphere WAS actually the explanation of midsummer, Custodian is totally "god" who probably had something of a "disagreement" with the rest of his kind and yeah Illuminati remnants confirmed to be wimps by their own words||
||We need something happening to the moon that pisses off the Custodian faction, the ones that screwed over "God" I mean, assuming he was actually betrayed like I think it happened||
Of course he will
I love how they kept the remote reconfiguration thing so now we don't have to waste an entire "arc" adapting for new super effective stuff we can't block
||bit bummed that Genjuro was about to come out and punch some things before they got out on their own, but it was probably too early to pull that card||
telling Fudou to shove it and wreck his shit, not expecting anything beyond that
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I'm exaggerating a lot but you get the picture
which one of the three thousand of them?
and arguably Leiur since she had to protect Carol
except Micha because DMJii unison OP
they looked down on them, then sandbagged hardcore
FIS also acknowledged they were monsters that couldn't be beat in a straight up fight
||Oh shit||
there are two versions of this going around rn, dunno which will stick
(full versions I mean)
we might have to wait quite a while for the unison kind of songs since they usually come with BDs, right?
can't remember the source tho so maybe it was just bs
I remember reading somewhere that Mikugear only happened because of King Records meddling or something, which is hilarious given how things have turned out
not that much of a stretch
I mean she can reconfigure them on the fly and repair a broken converter
and Bikki has godslayer relic
She can be a vessel for god power
SSJ is destroyed, yes
honestly at this point if we're gonna use spoiler tags the whole chat will be black bars
then Enki comes back with them
Probably wanted to piss them off enough so they'd return or something
Bikki's too used to cheating deathflags that she's numb to raising them
why do I get the feeling that the curse was a compromise by Enki because the alternative was kill all humans or something?
Yes, it's the whole reason Genjuro almost went to solo the coffin
<@138380189741744128> All Custodian names like Enki should be from Sumerian mythology, it only makes sense
the one about causing trouble
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
now they have an infinite supply of that one, she needs help
yeah but that Linker they stole was not Ver's good shit which allows you to abuse it hardcore to fix your problems
she needs an intervention
Kirika can just Linker away her problems, that's her MO
>almost died
>swan song
nope.jpg
yup
the other (first) version of the chart, seems like this one won't stick however
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
turns out it's not to protect it, but to keep idiots from releasing what's inside
I mean, I hear in Wild Arms there's apparently something that has a similar security system
By the way what was the coffin and its minions? I thought they were some noise variant at first but since they had to reconfigure the gears to deal with them it's probably not that
and yes I'm calling a huge helicarrier cannon fodder, that's how absurd we've gotten
so it's hard to compare if you ask me
The thing is that this time we jumped straight into plot against an actual threat instead of rescue mission or wrecking some cannon fodder
They used similar absurd output in the previous season
Carol is the one who knows how the gears work and still nukes Bikki with phonic gain
Adam threw alchemic energy, can't really blame him for assuming they wouldn't be able to use it
protip 2: do not throw a shitload of phonic gain to people that are known to be able to absorb it
protip: actually make sure to kill the other villain you're backstabbing
lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
same here, when someone tossed me a webm of that I thought I was getting trolled
but still
ok that's a cheap shot I'll admit
>budget isn't everything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRhyNs-WJos
BEHOLD
AI
DESU
YO
after all they said anything short of topping them is a disappointment
they're in full tryhard mode in terms of making the transformations
if they're going by CD song release order
Kirika probably
technically all of them should be since they all channeled the energy from SG's spellcaster, didn't they?
what's this about AXZ forgetting about the countdown? It even explained what happens when it runs out which I've heard people criticize it was never explained
unless you mean the literal timer on screen in which case yeah
the 3 new alchemist + the bad custodian <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
there, we have Maria screentime
Maria jobs to it
the mummy wakes up
now if they will also use that time to shove yet another poorly conveyed message on a Maria arc as well is not certain
or at the very least some time establishing what the hell the relic actually was
we're probably getting an arc focused on Argetlam given the info they've released
but nope
You'd think that with such an adaptable gear she'd get more use out of it
so maybe?
I mean we even have a scorpion in the mix
so maybe this time it actually ends up happening but much earlier
I mean back when AXZ ep 1 aired I thought the sealed thing SG's crew stole was a Custodian which would proceed to kill them at the season's end when it woke up
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
>awaken it
welp, wasn't expecting them to last very long
not to protect the corpse
I mean either they come back or the mummy wakes up and the whole "security system" was to keep idiots from releasing what was inside
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
So Fine turned Enki's arm into a gear, without knowking who it belonged to
yup
lol
despite being literally called "Enki's creation"
actually no
yup, one is a god, the other is Gilgamesh's buddy
remember, he doesn't need to have thought that far ahead, he only needs to make it look like he had
>finds out Fine is dead
>then finds out the reincarnation thing
>then finds out about Kirika's stunt in G
oof, turns out it's Kirika who's going to get hurt and not Miku
not that I'm complaining, just very surprised
>Symphogear
>getting into popularity lists of any kind in the west
what kind of sorcery or timeline fuckery is this?
it's bullshit of the highest caliber
yeah
throwing a freaking beam at that temperature
absolute zero is already absurd
yeah
at absolute zero atoms stop moving, this shit is about 20 times colder
yeah I get that it's supposed to be impossible
you know there's plenty of bullshit in Symphogear in general, but this genuinely bothers me more than any other that's been thrown in all previous seasons
they even tossed a jab at the wall thing after a random rickroll in an FIS installation sign in AXZ
it's supposed to be absurd, I admited as much
that's kinda funny
wait so the universe also has issues with underflowing values?
though Kirika's "are we there yet" bit made me chuckle a bit
but can't have Red Hot Blaze actually being fired
I was expecting that
so only one feasible choice
I want to beat hordes, but not in musou style
sign me up for DMC/Platinum style
yeah but I don't think it measures up to god powers without resorting to godslayer shenanigans
I mean the coffin was dealt with by the geah so clearly that wasn't the main course
so yeah, corpse is probably not that dead
In Wild Arms, which the franchise references a lot since lolKaneko, apparently there was a security system set up in a tomb of sorts that ended up not being there to prevent it being robbed, but to stop people from unleashing what was inside
wait a minute, if there's only Bikkis who's going to bully her so that she goes depressed mode?
and then they lash out like edgebikki and world peace ruined
CD yar har is out btw

>Chris being cancerous projectile spamming
~~can't believe there's 2 of them~~
which one?
She was just transfering her mind to compatible vessels from the coffin
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
When the mummy wakes up, wrecks whomever woke him up's shit and then proceeds to explain what actually happened, all while laughing at Fine's misunderstanding
[Angry FIS screams in the distance]
but not coming back as an AI on the bridge
I mean I'm sure he'll show up in a flashback or something
hey hey, at least it isn't CyVer
Bikki's side B, ||that's playing with a HibiMiku montage at the end of an episode, isn't it?||
speaking of gay love songs
also table manners have gone completely extinct
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
world peace indeed
what's funny is that Rebellion could've just ended happily ever after, but we didn't get that because Shinbo of all people suggested the twist, but that's enough off-topic
and butcher is too busy with puppets
no one dares to do anything with the main story without the complete quartet
so we end in what feels like the second act of a trilogy and then we transition into releasing nothing for years and then a mobage adaptation?
the final piece of trolling by Kaneko <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I think I'm just jinxing myself building up too much expectations by listening to it on loop <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
rough translation with plenty of mistakes on the subreddit I believe
activation is tied to the user, the later one has more freedom
One thing is the activation song and another is the singing in battle which increases power output, or at least that's how I see it
the only ones with a program to use relics were FIS and Div 2 and both were basically being puppeted by the same person
SSJ literally deletes relics
the only thing we're getting in the Maria side of things is the Argetlam thing
"I've nullified your magic with a martial arts technique" -Genjuro, probably
[laughs in noise]
or nothing at all if you're G
ones with dose just get jam
Linker junkies out of their dose get dusted
yeah but it's more than zero I mean
which is why Linker is there
they have some degree of compatibility, but not enough
speaking of activations, funny how all chants ending with zizzl meant that the particular gear would not stick with the user for long in terms of screentime
and him getting killed by non-noise enemies makes said enemy look tough as shit
Genjuro is not needed for CD shilling and doesn't get waifu crowd on their throats
<@!99695384296701952> yup, I'm thinking the same thing
they just didn't use them much
well they technically had, an entire pocket dimension worth of invincible troops at that
yep
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
yes I still mad
if you're jumping so much on the merch bandwagon give me my three missing nendos right now <:MariaYell:336657352264646657> <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and then the mummy wants to destroy the planet
and what about Adam?
yeah
and lure them with that
you can just throw noise
but guess you're right
it tried to beam them right away (the only downtime was the little charge time), unlike Chris who just stood there doing nothing until Tsubasa stands up
though maybe if they really wanted to I guess they could've shoved that once they got frozen
well the coffin wasn't exactly one to stop mid fight to allow their opponent to talk so it's kinda early to say that's the case
I mean ||they could play it in full if they mixed it with a montage and used it right before the end and the last part covers the credits section proper||
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
because the only thing the man fears is the noise and the coffin ain't no noise, not like he wouldn't have tried to come out anyways if that same situation would've happened with noise since there was no apparent way out until they thawed themselves
I completely expect for whatever evil Custodian Adam was trying to stop to make fun of the whole misunderstanding by Fine
"I've done so many fakeouts that they're expecting this time for me to actually deliver in the death department, that means if I do it again it'd be the unexpected!" -Kaneko, planning his next troll move
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Kirika, they usually go with CD release order
spoiler: the ending of XV destroys both bad guys and all gears and Symphogear turns into a slice of life anime
I wonder how the OP will be, kinda hard to picture it given how different Metanoia's style is compared to the others
more of a taste changing over time and don't liking the series as a whole any more
so "in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king" kind of deal?
so the channel is getting thanos snapped in a few days is what you're saying?
I chuckled a bit when I noticed it
(the table)
this wasn't in AXZ, right?
(western release/naming shenanigans with VII I mean)
and people think they're pulling a Final Fantasy
but still
I mean that's what I refer them as for the uninitiated to avoid confusion and memeing in the case of XV
lol?
it's a proverb so can't really change it, just thought it fit since nougat said the season was a dumpster fire
and what the hell wasnt side b supposed to be a meme song?
also damn the first one
yeah I was just saying that including Hibiki doesn't mean no attack card for you
Synchrogazer, Vitalization, Glorious Break and Testament
yes
it's a combination attack though so it could've gotten one
but maria bullying is expected so it's fine <:Ver:336656981144109066>
to be fair, neither did the twin drill
lol
and in that case they had a movie that had plenty of potential for a sequel without having to come up with much new stuff
And even then it couldn't let her completely go for that interquel bit of sorts since Amadeus was a thing
I meant "cheat" in that they're not really as screwed by the general reduction in volume sales that's been going on as something that only relies on the anime itself
To be fair Gear also cheats with the concert ticket thing
well you can always throw mobage codes to cheat the volume sales, though it's still probably easier to sit on the mobage
5Ds got shifted away in tone after Dark Signer when one of the VAs caused fiction to not be all that different from reality, did it not?
can't have backfire from the relic if you're the relic
[points to brain]
IIRC
and that's minor compared to later stuff
Megadeth Fuga required lots of chargeup
by the way where was the zesshou explanation that channeling it as an explosion skyrocketed backfire compared to creating a beefed up armed gear? I use it all the time and it makes sense but can't remember where I heard it
rofl
I mean I've seen worse differences in food that's called the same but still funny
lol
lost all of it afterwards
had meaning at the start
Zesshou is basically being a super saiyan
not exact phrase of course but something along those lines
something about "don't think you're hot shit just because you fully unlocked those toys"
Fine mentions it after they go X-Drive
and those are small fry
only Megadeth Party is spammable in S1 IIRC
it's X-Drive, I don't have to explain shit
what happened there?
spoiler: we get the episodic formulaic jobbing episodes in the second half, but it's the geahs dying instead /s
the non mocking ones I mean
funny, everyone I talk to IRL actually uses it as a literal "I'm thinking about it"
PV images
damn
She's going to job to one of the alchemist rejects
(haven't watched it yet by the way so if I'm way off already excuse me and disregard all this)
em we have potentially 3 different "villain" factions this season, all of which should end at each other's throats, unless this episode already killed that idea by having the alchemists being on the Custodian side or something and even then we have whatever Fudou wants to pull
she did try to hit her, but Fine's shield blocked it
that has as much of a chance as them doing the same with Kanade
she's appearing on a flashback with the whole Enki deal, that's pretty much obvious
ok, bailing out of here until some form of subs is up so see ya in a few hours
what did they do?
she even gets visibly concerned as that happens
when the armor regenerated
shards, they were integrating into her body
(or the survivor count is in the double digits at best probably)
everyone in that concert is fucking dead
so just watched it... holy shit
but since the mummy is all the way across the globe...
I mean I originally thought it was some kind of diversion
damn
and she pulled the eye thing
they've done nothing but double down on him being irredeemable
oh that asshole is definitely pulling that shit
but that's up to them
that's why I think it can be done without being a rushed mess
also if they don't waste an arc with upgrade BS that saves time as well
honestly if they don't pull an episodic lull for getting rid of each alchemist they could handle it better
lol
so it will possess whatever sorry fool who wears it? <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
and they were done like 6 months in advance
or something like that
each transformation was given to someone in the team that was fan of the respective character
I was about to say that too
and she was at almost 75k I believe
yup
just realized, bat girl just outdid SG's body count within minutes
it seems only Bikki's gear has the philosopher's stone thing right? it wasn't on Kirika's transformation
I also thought let it rip when she fired that thing
yup
Well that would solve one issue of too many potential antagonists fighting over the same thing
not much, but they didn't have a place with such a high concentration of people IIRC
letting Tsubasa watch a lot of them in the process of course
bat girl here was probably told to maximize death count
because Maria didn't want to kill anyone
also what happens when your weaker than the protagonist antagonist doesn't have any moral reservations unlike Maria
yup
this one legit was aiming to kill people to break Basa from the looks of it
well the attack on Zwei Wing concert was basically a distraction
Zwei Wing incident was Fine's doing
true
I mean there are probably survivors but I don't think they can handwave with "most survived" this time considering the entire place collapsed almost immediately
>implying that wasn't the intent and the Curse of Balal wasn't a compromise of sorts
problem is bat girl had no intention of taking things slow so it didn't make any difference
yeah but they pulled those as soon as shit hit the proverbial fan
please don't
same, but that would've probably left her out for the entire season and then some
I wasn't there I believe, but pretty sure she wanted that body to be killed there
at least now they escape because they'd legit get their ass kicked otherwise instead of you know, bail because I feel like it
teleport crystals, not really much of an option
bat girl zerg rushed the place, killed the loli in front of Basa and bailed
yeah pull the military stuff because you don't want to miss your concert, that's real nice. If you actually mean when shit went south though they did call helicopters after that
things that aged poorly really fast
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
inb4 some guy just mistyped a 4 where there should be a 1 in his numpad
so kind of a high bar to overcome to not be fodder
note that "fodder" is compared to ridiculous freaks of nature like the Geahs
tfw your laptop has decent sound with headphones but crap screen colors and your TV has good colors but bad sound <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
that reminds me I have to rewatch now on the TV
lol
they're basically a cornered beast
there were 2 versions of the chart for ep1
oh welp
also wasn't the other version with the gear blast the one that was supposed to stick for EP1?
well I didn't either at first since I was just watching the thumbnail <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
>dusted gaijin
lol
relevant
>Kirika forgot her drugs
I call bullshit she's the biggest addict <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
(sorry if it's spoilered, just copied it from another post from last week since I only save the full chart)
this one
let me look for it
the one where they activate it at first
not the victory shot
whatever is the extent of what she actually did remains to be seen
vampires hypnotize people
im joking
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
stop giving them ideas
Basa is going to go: "just tell everyone I died or something" to Ogawa (about the aftermath of the concert disaster) if she's fixed on the traumatized state due to Millaarc's BS right?
"What if we stopped building our stages like figurative death traps? Nah what are the odds of that happening again?" -Engineers and architects in geah world, probably
but yeah this is probably too much
she definitely had more than what were shown on screen
she even has a cameo in G with the global zesshou
NO
if it is I'm going nuclear
not the same girl
which just carbon people
it's the entire deal of Alca-Noise vs regular Noise
because they decompose targets into that
still conveniently colored to give us this tho
it's some primordial substance
it's not blood though
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
they DID say something was happening in ep 4 with Bikki IIRC
there probably won't be much in terms of remains left
if you leave this one just to rot there for so long and underwater to top it all up
I mean the other body was clearly being preserved/sealed
this one wasn't
also Enki was kind of lacking an entire arm
Enki died in Frontier control room, also different armlet thing
nope
>central jewel is purple
yeah, just drill that point even further, it's not like anyone will be surprised due to all the flags anyways
he's just absorbed into the armlet thing and will possess the fool who wears it <:Ver:336656981144109066>
GX concert didn't get crashed until it was done, didn't it?
though given Basa's current... condition, I'm expecting the later to be more able to do it depending on how early it happens
I can't wait for either Tsubasa or Genjuro to kick Fudou's ass
seems legit
it's all fun and easy rehab till someone needs to facetank a god beam
I mean the biggest addict now forgets to carry her dose
AXZ with Kirika's zesshou stunt
(the attack that works the same as Thousand Tears)
~~Maria's Infinite Crime tho~~ /s
~~yes I know it's probably a lot less, but it's memeing so whatever~~
~~those are the remnants' kills tho, she's like that because she was outdone in like 10 minutes~~
"we really should've just killed our rejects..." -SG in the afterlife
not really
it's a figurative death trap in case of any disaster
even if you remove the noise factor, it has like two exits at best and is suspended in the air above a huge body of water
so yeah
and those weren't present
the only bullshit I'd really call in any of that scene is on whomever designed that stage
>dusted gaijins
>stabbed gaijin as well
>and Maria
let's just say there's some weird eccentric billionaire with a lot of money to burn, an interest in music and not the best at picking architects to design his oddities
it's a death trap that wouldn't pass any safety standards of any kind
STOP
as someone who lives in the country with the strongest earthquake in recorded history, that thing bothers me tremendously
lol
or at least that's what I understood from people who TL'd the thing since I can't into japanese
no that was the animator of Kirika's henshin saying he wouldn't forgive her
so given recent developments, how mad would you be if they try to redeem this villain trio?
well the one traumatized was the aoi character, mami didn't have time to even register wtf just happened
rofl
some guy was saying that there was a madoka rerun airing in the time slot right before geah, if true then that's kinda funny considering recent developments
welp
~~zababa for OP senpais in the sequel~~
lol
would be weird if it ended as is without much changes
I can see them adding a lot of visuals to it as the season goes on
I want Millaarc stabbed through the chest with a Tsubasa/Maria combination attack
inb4 it never sees use and it was just bait
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
welp Shirabe already said it "4BD"
~~Fine with the T-pose to assert dominance~~
yeah I'll just stop
NoWaYu anime now or riot
seriously screw how they handled that
at least we're not being denied budget by Kadokawa in the final season
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what if gold form actually shows up in episode 4?
/crack
||Fudou is feeding them SONG info because of course||
Millaarc: "I'm gonna literally end this woman's whole career"
[King Records ~~ninjas~~ snipers have been dispatched to your location]
ToMaTo InTeNsIfIeS
the reason was break Basa to use seal
>Custodian armlet has purple jewel
I mean we already telegraphed the friendly fire we're getting in ep 1 anyways, no need to add more
then things will tone down boob jiggles aside
it's probably going to be on the same level but with yoyos
>headcannon 
~~sorry~~
show: "here, have some fanservice, see? nothing bad's going to happen!"
[last bit of the episode exists]
viewers: "welp"
next up is Shirabe by the way
they're different ones for each
keep in mind this is *after* they told the animator in charge to tone it down
please heal the sword and impale the bat girl <:MariaYell:336657352264646657> Actually maybe the later is required for the former given the mind flay thing
he wouldn't have considering the guy was given the job because he was a Kirika fan
lol
*this is after they told the guy to tone it down*
[Episode 4 happens]
Fans: surprisedpikachuface.jpg
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
4 is death
just have her suffer because thing happens
I didn't mean literally have the vampire do the thing
just take away Miku which already has plenty of flags
Bikki
please no
surprise attack while untransformed aside which is definitely not happening, yep
too much stuff to deal with on top this season
I doubt it'll go for all of them
assuming it did not burn from the same thing happening twice already
she's most likely locked in the traumatized state due to the mind flay thing so anything that basically burns the singing career bridge could happen
she actively avoided killing anyone
no, Maria's stunt in G doesn't count
and she's went through that *twice* already
~~the show itself is the incarnation of Nana Wills It though~~
"Ogawa, just tell the press I died there, ok?"
out of comission for quite a while indeed
Tsubasa's CD is the last
just realized
you're not going to riot much or drop it over that
to be fair, if you get hooked all the way up to S5
[laughs in restraining ~~brazzers~~ Noise]
I mean sure it called attention but it got drowned by Zwei Wing 2.0 anyways
fans when Chris transformation gets jiggle
Chris will most likely get the S1 transformation callback like Bikki did
and they're gonna do it
they know we know it's happening
we know it's happening
just accept it
that's pretty much a given
Chris is getting jiggle shenanigans
inb4 black gungnir callback on Maria's
*and still 10 seconds of it were apparently too much*
and this was made
entire plan was scrapped
guy had some planning made, then was called and told to not go overboard with the lewd
each was given to a fan of each character or something along those lines
~~yeah no, too much strawmanning in my part there, sorry~~
anything in transformations is fair game since characters don't reference it in-universe?
so basically with that logic
srsly
"no one paid attention to it"
The funny thing is the VA apparently can speak acceptable English
dammit
Fine's English
AAAAARGH
yeah
that one scene with Fine and Chris
Is Vanessa even an actual full doll or just cyborg?
hey, hey, at least that guy wasn't "rapey-guy #65"
>SAO villain
welp he DID make that rape remark so I guess it fits...
but please no
I joke about that from time to time because data card virus infiltration and all
CyVer is just crack memeing
just die
bitch killed all those peeps at the concert just to get under Tsubasa's skin
just no
no
oh she better impale Millaarc, put those crosses and silver to good use
(Tsubasa)
I mean she gets the triumphant return deal in exchange
(the poledance up to 11 I mean)
Actually I saw a not small amount of people calling out what happened in advance
or maybe he would've, it's been a long time... damn I'm old
>200 episodes is not much
not even my younger self that watched Naruto, One Piece and Bleach would say this
and here I am, not having watched any of jojo and no intention of doing so, not understanding anything except that it's basically solopy's kryptonite
they just used monster motifs for the seasonal villains
reminder that she has literal finger guns
cyborg it is then
even the episode where she gets roasted about the fool's stone is called Arcana 0 or something
yup
well at least the show already did the job for two of them
Carol "CHECK THE DAMNED BODY OF THE PEOPLE YOU STAB" Malus Dienheim
they told us, and we didn't believe them <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
and that could cover his meme quota
at best we get a flashback with new dialogue or some shit
because we don't have time for meme man when we already have a bajillion things to deal with this season and we only get 13 episodes
and she knew it
knowledge thing was an excuse
it was just revenge
I can already see this discussion crashing with no survivors...
||there wasn't any singing in the scene so I doubt they would've pulled a transformation scene given how each has the intro for the respective insert as BGM||
that's asking for a bad time
don't watch things out of obligation
if he's sick of the action I don't think there's much point and should just drop it
that's Genjuro tho
>mentor too cool to live
cape might be referenced in henshin but I doubt it's coming back
so of course beating her while she's down is a given
Fudou has never missed any chance to keep doubling down on being a piece of shit
given her current... condition
it's a triumphant return at the very least
last one
I love that emote
just drop it
at least it didn't go the usual escalation that ends in a firestorm
welp it didn't crash as hard as I was expecting it to so there's that
I already know what's the worst route
he's fixated on muh pure sakimori bloodline
actually I'm already picturing what's the worst they could pull with Fudou and let me tell you the entire fandom will be set ablaze in rage if they do that
"love... I wonder what did he mean by that?"
it's just a massive disaster, sure
and their numbers naturally just dwindle even without Gears because they need to suicide to kill people
(the whole world's noise)
gears don't really cover it, it's just that noise aren't that common as they are around Lydian for obvious reasons
or what Melua said about getting confident with the blow
even if she couldn't beat him right away (she can if she just pulls Solomon's Cane), she wins the war of attrition
memes aside, she just regenerates
so lower your torches/memes
this is me laughing, not asking for Ver
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
we might be fine
as I said, if we don't waste time on upgrade arc or episodic lull
unless you expect the season to crash with no survivors in a mishandled mess
same here, too much stuff on the plate already
GX had to regress characters for a single episode only to put them back up in the same episode
now die
so THESE ARE NOT SWORDS so fuck you
she said that she couldn't be beat by a sword
I meant in terms of effectiveness
dunno the rest
I'll say it again: philosophical armaments in this franchise are dumb
those are 100% maria and serena
I doubt they'll pull her actual death again
rofl
yup
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
honestly at this point telling her she's useless or inferior wouldn't do shit
because dat keyword and dat end of the op
and the Argetlam arc
Maria is probably just going to be Tsubasa support
the basa thing was just funny, the others were presented better
Argetlam I mean
it's the silver armlet looking thing in the op
why would you think they'd launch an attack on the literal other side of the planet with the intent of maximizing kill count
I mean they previously just showed interest in the mummy as well
I'm not even going to bother since I don't speak english as first language so whatever I write will sound phonetically different to everyone else
if Bikki had been on the concert and the same result was needed, then that dead girl would've actually been S1 girl just to make things even worse
keyword shenanigas
it's also the "reach and connect" part that only Bikki can do and which basically negates the damage denial part completely
the godslayer is more than just the longinus bit
actually nope
since you know, "infinite" supply and all that
if this was madoka and noise were witches Solomon's Cane would be even more valuable than it already was
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
they made it clear that it was moved, how is it too quick?
*was* but you what I meant
mummy is on the US isn't it?
lol
girl Frankestein monster
Vanessa
Millaarc must be impaled with extreme prejudice
~~it's not a hostage if you don't intend to keep it alive for more than 30 seconds even when unprovoked~~
except if you're G
Millaarc vs Tsubasa and Maria
Eliza gets put up against DMJii
it's right there on the op
yeah that sounds awesome
oh they're from there?
care to enlighten me about those? not really versed in XDU
come the fuck on my S1 team wants more friends
muh FIS nendos <:MariaYell:336657352264646657> <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>  they're not even hard to make
>he still thinks they won't be incredibly stingy in the figure department
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
then again she could job since you know
I don't give a damn, Maria please put your silver and crosses to good use
no, unleash the vampire hunter on her
but yeah I expected them to be nothing but fodder before this happened so it was good that they took this approach
I mean if you're such weaksauce that they can solo you and you don't have any moral blocks (unlike Maria in G) you might as well do the most of what little you have <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
(I at least know that one)
and one was so bad it was banished before it was even released
but don't go "oh it was there but they retconned it"
that's ok
that's not how retcons work, now whether you don't think it was there in the first place
I don't call it a retcon either but I don't get why some do
me neither
(the meta reason, which is obvious if you consider her popularity)
I mean, everyone knows why they didn't touch upon the Chris thing further
VPN it is
>video not allowed for my country
brb
at least BDs will remove it but those are so far away...
can I just say that I really hate the dynamic lightning thing they have to add because Pokemon?
oh I've seen that maria bullying before
>see lots of people saying "Emerald Splash" on the reddit comment section
>put it on google to see what it's about
>of course it's a jojo reference
I dunno why I expected something different
and none of the Noise seemed to notice him being there
I mean Ogawa *was* standing there
Noise confirmed Jurassic Park dinosaurs
so if you're surrounded by noise just stand there?
so everyone just stopped showing up
had one, got nuked by RL drama not involving me <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
welp
I really need to get one, but can't choose between red or green <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
lol
but chances of that are kinda low
either that or they release it in the window between Maria's and Tsubasa's CDs since there's a two week gap I believe
~~inb4 BD release bonus~~
dakka or lewds
depends entirely on what the animator's more into
>try to sell it on hype action for years
>turns out we had to appeal with lewds
lol
lol
did he mean the entire concept, Zababa's gimmick included, or just the AXZ approach?
yeah I know, just a random pipedream
Vampire†Killer finisher or riot
back to XV tho, just realized Maria uses a "whip" sometimes and is being assigned to fight the vampire in the OP
can't be assed to unlock HHM, why is that thing not unlocked from the start? <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> 
Never bothered with Erk since you get daddy Pent later on
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
she's supposedly garbage in higher difficulties precisely because she can't rely on dodgetanking anymore due to the enemies no longer being sad jokes
or even more hilarious, FE6 where the best "tank" for me was a freaking healbot
[laughs in GBA FE7-8 formula where in lower difficulties you can just send the fragile speedsters to tank]
no middle ground based on my very limited exp
lol, evasion tanks are always either garbage or totally OP
well Chris *has* the tank skill despite being also ranged DPS
yup
nor the two persons clinging to him
lol
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so we're getting that as well
don't worry about that, Fudou will 100% kick her while she's down
OP and ED are there as well by the way
check nyaa
already up
actually kiri's already out
http://symphogear-xv.com/products/
dates are there
~~I actually want more dakka as well don't get me wrong just memeing here~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
welp, at least Kirika will not be the only one taking one for the team in the name of reddit top page
since no need to suicide upon killing a single human
regardless of that little... design flaw the place was zerg rushed by Noise that are a lot more proficient at killing people than regular Noise
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I could see Fudou tossing a number on the call he's definitely giving to Genjuro about it, but if they give one it will most likely be relegated to some keyword
"all the attendants" is a catastrophically huge number tho <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
so for real, how many people do you guys think were actually killed in Millaarc's stunt? Certainly not all 100k (which would put the disaster almost into Hiroshima levels of body count) given that Maria implied some people escaped but I'm sure this time they're not pulling the same card as in the Zwei Wing incident, right?
since weaponized and all
and that's a conspiracy theorist's wet dream
I mean, some word in Val Verde might as well got out about how Noise were being used there
...I know where the door is, I'll just leave
I mean, the concert *was* to die for
but yeah, that would've been too much even for this
I mean, this is symphogear, has the subtlety of a sledgehammer anyways
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
well it's not like the previews help much anyways <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I'm still lost here
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
isn't that from G?
I assume it's from the previews
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
because that would send things to shit reaaaal quick
thank god every alchemist, Vanessa's group included, wasn't a chaotic evil nutjob that would just go around giving regular people noise capsules for personal use, amirite?
yup
or something along those lines
Fine just says "don't think you're hot shit because you removed the locks on those toys"
to be fair, the number is never thrown on screen IIRC
TIL
really?
that's just how I interpreted it
(what you mean)
yes I know that
but since it's just power level wanking it's kind of a moot discussion and the least of GX's issues
that's why I asked back then
then you're absolutely right
if however it turns out it's a heck of a lot more
look, I think we're arguing different things, I am arguing on the basis that whatever Carol meant with her boasting about phonic gain was the same output as the G finale, since it makes no sense to pull the *exact same number* for no reason
at the end of G where she pulls all that phonic gain together she's no longer a relic fusion and she's just chill
some translations literally have the same wording for both cases
that's why I asked about the wording and different translations a while back
they used the same energy output in G
I mean the actual fight after she goes full tilt due to the Chateau falling
Well I'm on the camp that at the end she was stronger than the AXZ alchemists, she lost because you can't use phonic gain to beat a team containing Hibiki + Maria
And base form power didn't escalate all that much
To be fair Carol was able to conjure up on her own what took the entire planning singing to achieve in the previous season
Couldn't have been much
how long was that training in-universe anyways?
That part I do agree with
except DMJii I guess
so it's not as big of a stretch as doing it from scratch
yup, they just couldn't call it at will
Well the idea *was* originally a prank
but that one in particular struck me since it's right at the end
well there's a lot more wrong things like the whole tea thing
funny thing, the part where YT says "no life signs" said "checking for life signs" in Crunchy
oof
oh I wanna see this
same with whatever happened with Fine and Enki
power of flashbacks I assume
unless it wasn't this way in TV broadcast and was fixed in BDs which is the version I have, I really don't see it
I see her with all her limbs and no visible scratches when hibiki is carrying her which is the first time she appears on screen after the dragon blows up
About Fine regenerating before pulling the moon fragment, I just watched the scene after the dragon falls and didn't see any part of Fine regenerating, the only change is the armor collapsing after pulling the moon and then she gets dusted. Unless I'm really that bad at paying attention <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222> The armor is not visible wrecked nor has cracks before that however, just lost the golden color and some details
yeah that
I meant afterwards when they took them in
~~unless I'm forgetting something and he wasn't involved when that whole debacle happened~~
because FIS
he shoehorns himself on that alone
we have pretty much the OP establishing that there'll be a Serena flashback
And that way he gets the information about what happened with SSJ and wielding god powers
you think he will give a fuck?
actually... if they do that, he can just kidnap Miku and... oh fuck
and if Genjuro is replaced by Fudou at the head of SONG... well there goes the entire dynamic of the organization
I mean he was already sick of him before that disaster
and probably pull Genjuro from SONG command
Fudou is going to call
season already has to deal with a lot with just the living
let's just leave the dead as they are
autoscorers are not people, silly!
of course as you said that can be fixed
still, it basically worked on memories
inb4 philosopher stone work the same as in FMA <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
that thing?
The one that requires either memories or unreasonable amounts of phonic gain to work?
~~he's just meme man and they won't do anything else than being meme man~~
It also gave us best villainous anthem <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I do not outright hate GX despite my relatively frequent bashing of its bad parts (I would've just dropped the series back then if I did)
at least we've kinda touched some of the plot without crashing, which is more than I can say about early GX Hibiki
(space shuttle suplex)
yeah but the amazing part was completely unrelated to the actual plot of the season for the most part
don't jinx it, please <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
reminder that the Illuminati backed FIS at some point <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
lol
now since it's just the aftermath and not Millaarc's little concert visit itself it was less likely to happen, but if the KyoAni attack had happened last week instead of yesterday, a delay for episode 2 wouldn't have surprised me all that much
I dunno, sensitivities with airing things that could be remotely linked seems to be a big issue there, I keep remembering what happened with the whole Team Plasma vs Team Rocket thing in the Pokemon anime
wasn't Yugioh guy Ono?
(of course this is just retroactively having it make sense since no way that was on the table back when the gear was introduced)
well the main deal with the gear is that the name was a placeholder, wasn't it? so it kinda makes sense it doesn't really make use of the premise it should have
remember the plastic wrap?
what's up with anything the gear does really
for real tho I have no idea what they could do
Maria is a Megaman with the stolen moves, so she should just change gear colors according to what she's copying <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*He is invincible I tell you!*
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
tfw you thought all 3 new alchemists were jobbers but one of them ended up being a really successful heel
~~Chris, because red~~
For real though, will they go beyond Millaarc crashing the concert... ||WITH NO SURVIVORS||?
what therapy, you know she's getting a verbal beatdown by local old war general on being a failure as a sakimori
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Agematsu is song producer I believe
Noise only affect humans so it wouldn't do much of anything
I'll have to give the start of AXZ a rewatch and pay attention to that
I just remember them commenting on how bad it is that Noise are being weaponized, but that could be just them referring to what they saw in Val Verde
have they?
and still haven't
yes I know and they didn't show anyone else having them
was that said anywhere? because Val Verde had them due to Illuminati connection, or was just highest bidder?
just have to thank that none of them are full chaotic evil nutjobs that would just hand them to regular people to watch the chaos unfold I guess
since SG's group was able to produce even those special gimmicky ones
I think it's safe to assume that a lot of alchemists have the recipe and not just Carol
only disadvantage is that technically anything can hit them but we've all seen how ineffective regular guns are against them anyways
and there's no reason to bring those back since they're less proficient at killing than Alca-Noise anyways
pretty sure the entire pocket dimension and all Noise inside were destroyed
nope
regular are called from treasury (which went kaboom by Nephilim) and the recipe was probably lost or something, we don't know whether the ones that spawn more could do so infinitely but we do know that once they're out of the treasury they expire on their own after a while
just realized tomorrow's episode airs at the same date as the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, if we go by UTC time of course <:Ver:336656981144109066>
also damn you now I want Chris to fast draw shoot one of them to cut off their escape and will be bummed when it never ends up happening
and then leave because you have to keep them alive/you got pissed at something they said and just ragequit the server
instead of wiping the floor with them
they run because they have to or get rekt
at least this time they're being used in a less annoying fashion
so long as they don't take fatal damage/their base is being attacked, they can always just leave
then teleport away
isolate them for a couple minutes to do your dirty job
could be useful given their position
wonder if reject squad has some
Did they even have more of those special model Noise after Cagliostro used them? Not even Adam tossed more of those at the end.
Chris shoots an arrow at it with a giant bow before this happens
assuming you meant this one ofc
that was Chris' attack
nope
(the attack card Alca-Noise)
wait what?
Kaneko being Kaneko
I watch that scene from time to time just to admire the absurdity unfold <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
over 100 years old
seriously what the fuck is up with Fudou
Pretty sure he has some really weird genes going on anyways
reminder that canonically what they were shown was that scene of that sucky 2003 Hulk movie where he destroys the tanks the same way Bikki did
they attune to reality in the few seconds they're lunging at people I believe
I mean the thing was about to explode and only stood there T-posing on their way, wouldn't have made much of a difference anyways

just realized the original question of this conversation is a moot point
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
loophole please
regardless, they only do the killing thing on humans based on what the show said, that's another advantage the Alca-Noise have, those decompose whatever the hell they please
or collide, depending on whether there's a gear nearby or not
rest they just phase through
at best you could order them to stay still
~~why the fuck did I play that without headphones, thank god you could blow up a bomb nearby and my brother still wouldn't wake up~~
welp, episode is airing, time to mute this until subs are out
>Chris actually shot the teleport crystal
I LOVE YOU
until he gets hijacked by the bracelet of course
enjoy your stay
Welcome to Fudou's ruse cruise
I mean everyone has lost count of the flags by now
obviously he has the complete Kusanagi sword stashed away somewhere <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
fuck this guy
70k dead people for that
The point of that attack was obviously just so Tsubasa gave up on singing
yeah I know I meant how they were being abused
I was literally yesterday saying how that would never ever happen because teleporting seemed the same as transforming: a free action
sorry if I interrupted something, just finished watching and had to say it
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> : Ok, time for goofy theory!
>Millaarc appears
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> : Wait, I was right?
lol
solo calm down
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
damn
I laughed at those way more than I should've
at least given their own words previously
they would still get trounced if they went full unison though
<@138380189741744128> yup, that one image with SG wasn't that far off
yup, as I said, 70k deaths for that
he's embracing the obvious villain flag he's had since AXZ
"the nation" is an abstract term one sentence away from being distorted into being only himself
wasn't that some kind of misinterpretation?
Kirika is the limit given what we've been told though
we still don't have a gaijin chart update right?
she's obviously not ok
yes, that was Fudou's plan
ikr?
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
how the heck did I miss that
lol just saw the error
they're gonna pull this later on, aren't they?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
the only question was if he was puppeting another faction as well or not
~~no one that's been paying attention at least~~
no one?
he can still do that you know?
Ame no Habakiri imapling please
someone is suggesting the guy who made it to dress the guys like the delinquents
oh god it's in the making
Ver is not even all that old lmao
and not just Bikki
he still needs to find out that Miku can use the infinity bracelet
removing Gen from command and take over I mean
some anon in /a/ (yes 4chan I know, spare me the lecture on it being a horrible place and all)
and the madman is delivering
just realized that Fudou even installed a script that turns off all of the bridge's lights for dramatic purposes whenever he calls
ofc
cute dorks
there's one with Ver but it's not a SONG recruitment one for obvious reasons, just more ITS LOVE meme
and here we go
their deal is being a failure
lol
for 2 specifically
apparently Fudou is another giant Wild Arms reference
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMJKzp6CkvA
>that description
before that whole thing happened I believe
the bios did hint that she would do monstruous things for the sake of the other 2 as well
"hey I have this that I know your friends need to live, can you mindbreak my granddaughter/daughter and get me this infinity bracelet thing that the muricans took in exchange?"
(not trying to justify, just saying how it's probably going to turn out)
she fucked with Basa because Fudou ordered that attack
since we still haven't seen what the heck was Adam so terrified about
he's going to get overtaken by Custodian shenanigans
though I'm sure they're not walking out of this alive anyways
because he's the intended hate magnet
I can already see most blame being shifted to Fudou
she's literally unable to function in many ways without miku
and Kanade maybe not going zesshou
or maybe not since slower plans
granted without that everyone would've been crushed under Fine's heel
Zwei Wing concert invitation
*[shipper torches being lighted in the distance]*
because subtlety of a sledgehammer and all
something something Fine/Enki parallels incoming something
oof
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that and the philosopher stone thing
(Kirika henshin)
pretty sure that part was the 10 seconds that were cut
that or "what are 70k lives next to the supremacy of grorious nippon?"
even though it was obvious
enjoy your stay
welcome to Fudou's ruse cruise
the 10 seconds I mean
pretty sure after the ones shown today that what they cut was the philosopher stone + S1 intro
(gear blast)
it's just armor purge optimized as a team attack
6 years for this to actually be fired
~~all 4 of them already came back from being glittered by SG & Co in the AXZ chart anyways~~
lol
guess it's that one
dunno which one the anon decided to stick with at the end
that one got updated multiple times
oh yeah
what do you mean?
Shirabe is 54 secs including the chant part
the best part is that she also denied a teleport before doing that
I'd argue Millaarc was going for a heel vibe last episode, but now she's out of fuel so she can't even do that
(of course in this show it's a big deal)
one man illuminati relegated to just japan though
plenty of time to amass quite a lot of influence
well he IS over 100 years old
but that bit of info throws me off in how much control he has
yeah I know, it's just that he clearly has power over all of them
I think
or something like that
but was forced to resign because Ichaival was lost under his command
he was in Div 2 command
it's complicated
he even has a script installed in the bridge that turns off the lights when he calls for dramatic effect, he's probably spying on them
pretty sure he did not expect them to stop it
grorious Nippon >>> japanese people for Fudou
well they already said it in axz
and if there was one moment where Basa was most vulnerable to that kind of shit, it was in that whole disaster
but against the right target on the right situation it works as intended or something
yup, normally it's weaksauce
actually it probably had some additional lingering effect on Tsubasa
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
apparently the name of the bracelet is a Hebrew word to refer to god, but it's also used in satanic rituals.... watch Fudou summon Satan when he thought he was summoning god
we have Kazanari "what are 70k lives next to having my heir become a true sword?" Fudou, toppest of dads
you just need a wielder
you have the alleged source of god power already
you have infinity bracelet already
I mean why would either of them need her?
that's like purposely creating CyVer
why would you bring her back?
she is kill
and that one ultimate attack Millaarc hinted at? It's an Icarus reference so it'll probably not end all that well for them when they actually end up doing it
it's really noticeable how less skilled than the previous alchemists they are, not a single spell has been used
That said I fully expect them to pull boob missile at some point
Vanessa isn't fully mechanical, she just got blown up in some experiment and had to be rebuilt with machine parts
should've clarified that
GX was the season of top dads, I meant when he was mentioned
some people were calling on him becoming a villain as soon as he showed up on GX because his whole schtick there is apparently directly lifted from some guy in Wild Arms 2 (Kaneko pls) who also turned out to be a villain
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> : *tries to lighten the mood with some dess theory*
Millaarc: *shows up*
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> : "Wait, I was right?"
like that's not even up for debate IMO
it's 100% a joke noise
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
who wouldn't want to try those out as soon as possible?
putting my money on that last one
oh is YT out early? Awesome!
*ditches cr subs*
lol
Carol takes over for a moment, shits on reject trio while mocking them for being shitty alchemists and jabs at SONG for even letting them accomplish anything
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
assuming he was dead after just a hit and letting him fall
yes that's what I was getting at
then she forgets to fully kill Ver and that's the second mistake
until Ver somehow bullshits his way into making it work again
there was no recovering from that tablet being lost
her fuckup was that her plan got ruined by <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
I guess
Season ends right there
they were most certainly asked to break Basa by Fudou so that was just another tool to make the whole thing more effective
they killed 5 figure numbers worth of innocent people there, what's one more little girl to add to that mix at that point
or something like that
>not xXx_DaRk_KiR1_xXx
oof
Chris is the ultimate third wheel
yup
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
>has cat ears
>copycat gear
~~that'd require for Carol to come back since it looks like she was a fan~~
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> someone's asking for more jojo ~~I actually haven't watched anything related to it and don't plan to~~
They seem to be pretty keen on not backpedalling on shit hitting the fan this time, what with them straight up giving Millaarc an SG-tier bodycount in 10 minutes instead of pulling the Zwei Wing card
"D-do that at home!"
"But we are at home..."
well using RHB for its intended purpose in that place would've been bad given how it works <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
I love how DMJii have been used so far this time
heck they were more impressive than a lot of the ones from previous seasons
Both DMJii combos would've gotten an attack card in any other season
sorry had to be done
alternatively:
>||Heavenrend||
I rise your lulz with:
>subbed screens
I don't even know why she was apparently hurt, it was just noise fodder into a fall that the gear should've easily absorbed anyways
lmao
(it's on the YT ones, wasn't on cr, dunno about commie)
that's funny since it's not like the rest of the team are typical magical girl loli age or anything like that
what did she mean by this?
Kaneko's going to troll us again with meme keywords
inb4 Fudou casually pulls Kusanagi as a complete relic when Gen inevitably gets fed up with his shit and tries to wreck him
blue swordies are cursed, clearly
welcome to Fudou's Ruse Cruise, please enjoy the ride
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
best I could fish without making one myself

so bonus Tsubasa duel points
I mean it's the imperial regalia and all, no way they're giving him any other if he's using a sword relic
lol
he's going to pull Kusanagi or some other complete sword relic
if Gen tries to pull that off he's going to be killed for real this time
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
did someone say puns?
reminder that the sanitization collapsed so hard in GX that the last season never got dubbed ~~yes I know that's definitely not the real reason~~
yep
~~idiots calling S1 a bootleg Madoka back in 2012 didn't help either~~
~~this is still symphogear, not a big western fanbase to discover meme potential of things and/or act on it quickly~~
so try to sell it to western executives... yeah
I mean the premise was completely bonkers in japan as well, no one at Satelight would believe you in 2012 if you told them this would blow up like it did there
also keep in mind a lot of the income comes from CD/concert shilling compared to your average anime
and very likely to not work
well given the amount of insert songs it's no wonder the show is also licensing hell
well that *was* 7-8 years ago
I've been told that it was a thing back in 2012 when everyone got rused into thinking Kanade would be an MC by promotion material
kind of way
I meant in "this is bootleg madoka, instant shit"
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
welp
oh lol
*anyways* back to gear before the police banishes us all to <#371105434771390465>, S1 had the curse of being compared to Madoka because of the dark tones so even without the singing while fighting deal it had an uphill battle
not just one of the things it could do
but it was the whole puzzle spirit's schtick in S0
yes I know mind crush is a thing in DM too
"Remember when Yugi went around mindbreaking people with random games?"
or finger guns
even if you take out the Shadow Realm nonsense, then you had Barrel Dragon nerf guns
I always laugh when I remember all the censoring in Duel Monsters
~~im still here please save me~~
what have you done to me I can't stop
*laughs in Nanoha*
THE ONE THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED
AAAAAAAAA
will actively tease for days, never actually do it
tl,dr: it's japan
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
down to the even having a daughter but not confirming anything either?
Real talk, y'all not getting any yuri stuff confirmed ever because of course *[raises shield]*
~~funny cause when they had the chance to go full murica bad they had the mastermind be a right-wing japanese extremist instead~~
oh yeah there's also some old drama with the studio and the west as well isn't it?
lol
well if something was watched by a lot of westerners but flopped on the absurd japanese disc sale market, that can certainly happen
>that theory on Zoid's twitter
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
the only question is whether they die to papa Fudou or to Custodian plot hijack
let's be real, at best Noble Red gets to be a pity magnet before being killed off
"Why the fuck am I ranged DPS *and* tank? That doesn't even make any sense"
it's a blessing we got that move at all, I was calling it a never ever the night before lol
that one bit about what Fudou said at the end is still interesting
that's precisely why it could get stuff right
it's batshit insane
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
without any effort
infinitely
then it regenerates
of course she would've lost
Carol cannot damage the freaking thing
so it doesn't matter <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
ok thinking about it that's not 100% true, the Divine Weapon is the most overpowered thing, problem is that it got trolled in rock paper scissor fashion before getting to do much of anything
Carol is still the most overpowered villain, yes
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
please no more meme man shoehorn
I have a better idea: feed the 7 billion to the team, then use 7 billion yourself as well <:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
as far as I'm concerned that's as full strength as you can get
He went Baphomet on their asses after resting 3 days and had no reason to hold back at the end
I know, I'm asking because that probably sheds some light on whether Carol > Adam or not
how do the last ignition gears at the end of AXZ compare to the GX X-Drive by the way?
and damage never happened
Divine Weapon just rewrites reality
Nehushtan could be overpowered by something
yeah but she's Illuminati for all they know
no way he knows Fudou ordered the whole thing
what is he going to retaliate against?
and all he knows to do is send nukes or shitty mooks with regular guns
he refused SONG's help and got screwed by something he doesn't even know where it is
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
~~yeah I know, lapsus on family relationships, blame Fudou's BS~~
yep
>get removed for fucking up
>replace your son because he supposedly fucked up even more
it'd be funny if you know your side materials though
lol
>Millaarc punches him from behind
>this should kill him by all accounts
>he just shrugs it off and kills her/fatally wounds her so she gets her pity speech before kicking the bucket
(yes he wants bracelet, but we know he can't really use it)
as I said:
>pulls out Kusanagi
>proceeds to wreck shit
I mean this fucker was at the head of Div 2 prior to Genjuro it's not that much of a stretch
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
but nope
you'd think that a crazy loli dissolving the planet would raise some alarms
exactly, they're just a joke at this point
and that's without counting that the whole thing was controlled by Fine prior to that
backed by Illuminati cash but still
they lost their relic division to an old woman, a madman, an idol and 2 kids
in the eyes of the world they can't even nuke a place into the ground right anymore
and murican goverment has done nothing in the show so far but embarrass itself and fuck up
lol?
(I don't remember the exact details, might need to rewatch but that involves me and AXZ 12 which is... not pleasant)
wasn't that because it wasn't fully fused and thus could be removed with the anti-linker + miku shenanigans or something?
Well not much you can do if you're getting hard countered which is probably the reason he might opt to use Miku and never use it himself (because he's getting kamigoroshi'd the moment he does) <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
oh you meant literal lol
~~seriously how many of those were used there?~~
They already spent all the "get out of death free" cards in S1 and G tho
~~I know it was not the real reason and they were just memeing btw~~
"Symphogear delayed for the hilarity of being delayed" -Commie 2017
or still doesn't like it but might as well use what happened there as a major plot point for your finale because life giving you lemons and all <:Ver:336656981144109066>
lol
heard that somewhere but never got an actual source so probably just BS
~~wasn't Mikugear an executive meddling move by KR or something?~~
~~also mostly memeing here~~
~~don't give him more hero points please~~
Reminder that Ver's BS in G is technically to blame for all the Miku related suffering we'll get later on in XV
so salty you forget you can dissolve him into ~~atoms~~ red paste <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
>toss an Alca-Noise crystal
>"hey touch that meme man over there will ya?"
well that was hard
of course not
only because he thought Carol's motivation was not grand enough
He screwed up a plan that he himself helped put in motion like 30 minutes before (there was no recovering from the tablet being lost, Shirabe and a stray saw are the real heroes <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> )
oh I see
more Kaneko trolling?
and yes that means the dude doesn't know about Miku yet
inb4 Fudou tries to pull some BS on her through Noble Red because free of sin
~~whatever it is it's probably something unimportant~~, when have preview pics ever contained something that actually matters? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
wasn't the transfusion requirement only an Elsa/Millaarc thing? It's probably something else if she also gets them.
that said, looking forward to the next stop in his ruse cruise
~~because he got introduced as a top dad in a season where there was already a top dad filling the piece of shit quota~~
jap goverment according to subs
Probably will pull a stunt after they all get jailed or something
I knew he was going to pull something like that, but didn't expect full takeover at gunpoint
Didn't expect Fudou to drop all pretenses so soon tbh
dat Hanasaku Yuki duet tho
yup, they did <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Fudou: "I'm assuming direct control"
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
at least I'm pretty sure that's what they were trying to convey
even if noble red's weaksauce you cannot pull that shit if you're a regular human
Fucker's certainly pulling some sword relic now that we know he can actually be a boss (combat wise I mean)
lol
by the way we're probably getting our explanation outside of meme strength for Genjuro because what the fuck was up with Fudou's strength
could've worded that differently <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
by "dropping pretenses" I meant just not putting the entire bridge at gunpoint by making whomever he's controlling do it, not a literal cackling in their faces
?*
or would they=
I know it's crunchy and all but even they wouldn't mess up that catastrophically
the upgrade arc was indeed AXZ
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
problem is that creates a bunch of issues with other characters
well there's been people saying fucker's a Custodian since AXZ because of the Wild Arms 2 character he's supposedly referencing or something
lol
If Millaarc is going to die then it'd probably have to be to Tsubasa, not Fudou doing the deed himself
so it doesn't make him look *as* evil
also the vamp, even if under orders/forced to, got a killcount of innocent people that rivals freaking SG in less than 10 minutes
if only one of them has to be kill fodder to make Fudou look even more of an irredeemable bastard I can see Elza fitting that role more than Millaarc
>gets fatally injured by Basa
>spills the beans as a last fuck you to Fudou
chances of Bikki succeeding at the befriend thing and then Basa going ballistic on Millaarc immediately?
I need to check those, though it's probably not too far from my guess
then do the Miku thing
that's why I think he'll look at the files
he doesn't give a shit anymore
but he just sent an armed squad to a freaking UN op without any provocation
he doesnt have direct authority for sure
takeover, look at the files (because they for sure omitted that in the reports sent to him)
so what's the next step on Fudou's master plan?
inb4 Kanade spirit shenanigans in Basa's Amalgam ~~im joking please don't~~
let the poor mirror go
relic killer is a no go, since that thing is going to Miku 100%
still, we have a literal god power bracelet
doesn't prevent him from making the beam effects a major plot point <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I mean they weren't going to unceremoniously kill him off screen after the concert disaster so it wasn't that much of a surprise
was he?
wait, Ogawa wasn't on the bridge in the takeover scene
~~not exactly, but the adaptation still trolled the whole thing so much that I'm not even going to bother~~
and now I just thought about Maria's song getting interrupted by mines instead of Bikki
tfw you can no longer joke about Maria's henshin being just doodles with some notes made by Kaneko
we already had an entire season that ended up being in hindsight a glorified upgrade arc (AXZ)
probably not happening, unless they're hell bent on turning the last 3 episodes into the most mishandled clusterfuck this series has ever experienced
by the way now that I realize <#371105434771390465> though it's probably too late now <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which is dumb as all hell since that would put freaking Slayers in the category
basically, isekai has become so spammed that I've seen people call generic fantasy setups "native isekai"
speaking of isekai trash, anyone else heard the "native isekai" buzzword? I legit struggle to think of anything more nonsensical than that
~~not like the source material is anything I'd call good anyways~~
Hamster Jesus
yup
didn't gen get jacked in like only 2 years? (looks slimmer in the Zwei Wing concert IIRC)
yes, but those can't overpower in strength literal augmented humans
not likely, he would've already put it on or wouldn't have made that comment of the bracelet making things not as easy
so probably works if the wielder is free of sin
activated but putting it on just turns you into fireworks
that's assuming Ogawa knocks the guys on the bridge out and those manage to escape btw
>enter Lydian
>kidnap Miku and maybe some other people
>hold them at gunpoint
wow that was hard
emm
Prelati v2: "Basically, how am I supposed to walk through doors on this?"
I will be extremely disappointed if OP visuals don't have a pretty big change after episode 6 or so
yes (a descendant at least), it would also mean that Fudou's been technically rubbing the whole thing on our faces with semantics with his sakimori schtick the entire time
I swear if they pull the move of Fudou being a Custodian descendant...
doubtful, since they mentioned it in the character bios thing for the season
also to do an episodic lull they kinda need an op miniboss squad that has to be dealt with separately, and the only ones available for that just got 1v3'd
if we're just in episode 4 and they don't do an episodic lull... it can be done, but only if they don't waste time
Let's see, calling how is this probably going to unfold in terms of tackling the stuff in their plate... if Fudou is a Custodian descendant of sorts those two are the same thing aside from the obligatory Fine flashback, america is a joke in this show as I've said repeatedly so it's just going to get sidelined or fail in like 5 minutes, Tsubasa's deal will get mixed with the Custodian stuff so it doesn't have to be separate her probably going ballistic and killing one of Noble Red before finding out it's all part of papa Fudou's master plan aside, Chris parents in the OP is probably just a visual thing like Nastassja for DMJii, Miku's thing is mixed with Fudou/Custodian stuff and Maria's Argetlam/hometown deal is pretty much confirmed to be involved with the Custodian stuff as well
in other news... I need a clean version of the Bikki/SG duet, but that's probably a BD vol 2 bonus so I have to wait till November <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
so it should've been somewhere near where Tiki got stomped
about Adam's hat... it just falls off after Tiki trolls Adam and he doesn't pick it up
Nokia >>>> Divine power for sure
oh right, the bullet was fired from that gun, forgot about that
I can rationalize SG somewhat... the rest not so much
they appeared behind Bikki when Adam was going to get Testament'd, it's not much of a stretch, though only SG would make more sense since it was her spellcaster that gave the rebuilt energy after all
I mean, at the current pace shit will hit the fan at like ep 6 unless they calm down, and Fudou literally has the bridge at gunpoint so he doesn't seem to be interested in taking things slow
not a straight up upgrade like the S2 gears were compared to S1
(when not using the alchemic power I mean)
they can just handwave that though, since the rebuilt gears seem like a sidegrade
which one, the one with SG?
the song itself has been stated to produce a lesser output
yes, that's why I said she wouldn't be much of a threat
because it could be that
do we know the title of Basa's side-B' yet?
that's more likely
(hesitation from the team aside I mean)
unless they want her to be a non-threat that is
can't happen unless they want to contradict themselves (bringing back the S1 song as it was)
yes she has, all of them really
but yeah, Ignite clogging up shill slots or something
only Bikki ones
it's not the same as the AXZ trio
Carol was straight up trying to dissolve the planet, there was no compromise possible
(SONG being a killsquad in that instance)
yup, exactly my thoughts back then
especially Prelati since she was escaping the actual big bad
still felt off for me at the time
~~ones going for kills weren't Bikki tho~~
he threw a sun, then fucks off till the end
~~I know, just messing around~~
also turns into a giant monster
she's Adam's glorified sexbot that doubles as star analyzer or some shit
what was the plan anyways? aside from:
1. Activate Frontier
2. Pull the moon
3. ???
4. Profit
~~yes I know that's just PLOT~~
that went down in flames to a stray saw
~~does that mean the rebuilt gears are technically made of people?~~
"also no one but you can see me so you may want to not talk to me out loud"
"wait, I thought that was a one of thing?"
"no apparently I'm stuck here, do you need any help with that?"
[insert that one shinai scene of SG's group learning to pronounce their philosopher's stone name]
Crysopoeia?
at least that's what things looked like to me
he had 3 whole days to recover and shed his human form, I thought he was at full power?
he was at full power in the end? or you mean that he got Testament'd by just Bikki
he could've oh I dunno, chime in 5 minutes earlier when Bikki still hasn't fully recovered and they're all busy paying attention to Trump's chimpout
his most remembered scene for me aside from obvious sun throw is him going "waaah waah it's not fair waaah you'll be cursed waaah" at the end of episode 12
aside from being a jerk to SG and transparently evil of course
it doesn't even make sense in the context
that's some high level screwup
and they'll probably bait the jojo one with you know what
this week they baited the Akame ga Kill audience
"a smile price to pay for the shilling of this franchise" -Crunchyroll, probably
~~though you're probably right~~
Kaneko is the kind of guy who gets forced into something he absolutely hates and then goes on to make that an important plot point for the final season, not sure if this is the last of the SG thing we'll see
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
the linker is the apple
~~you have a dude obsessed with his bloodline being of "the protectors/sentinels/insert synonymous" and the ancient race is called "Custodians"~~
thank you for your hard work btw <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
into the trash it goes and on to rewatch
and as soon as YT is out
so "better than nothing", only reason
it's literally just because raws was the original plan because I'm an impatient mofo
at least correct your fail when it becomes apparent
omfg
Soil
why would you think that's ok
just random "kill"
treasury randomly leaks some
that's also a thing
because Chris activated the thing after that IIRC
ok, I was about to have a breakdown over how the hell did Zwei Wing or the attack in the SSJ site happen if she couldn't summon
can Fine control/summon the Noise without Solomon's Cane?
it was just the excavation team at the SSJ site, wasn't it?
where do I sign?
for whatever reason
it starts at the end of Elfnein's little description
yup
I love how they put the spoiler for the release that they still haven't finished in the thumbnail
>doesn't start at DATOSHITEMO 
one job
oh look, crunchy uploaded the amalgam clip without a bait title
lol
Chris & Kirika: "So why are you guys here exactly?"
Cag & Prelati: "We spoke like 3 sentences to each one of you and SG didn't want us to feel left out"
but it was not full yet
the hall had 100k capacity
and rising
nope, next episode they said 70k
now the problem is that SG got her kills within a ridiculously long period of time... Millaarc just did a quick 10 minute visit to crash the hall with no survivors and almost matched her
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
She literally has someone with 75k confirmed kills as her powerup
SG
at least this time it was kinda plot related instead of trouncing soldiers with zero chance of winning, I'll give it that
>food analogy
every. time.
that would've been funny though, she succeeds and everyone is crushed under her heel... then she dies to relic cancer months later
given what they implied back then, Fine's crap was an improvement
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
my b
news is she got kidnapped
im wrong
nnope
because the news was that she got rescued I believe
oh so when the news got the Chris rescued story Chris was already lost again?
Well S1 doesn't work if she can't summon them on her own unless for some random reason the Cane can summon without being activated, so that's probably canon in she show as well
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
that one?

~~Systems Red henshin when?~~
oof
I wonder if he'd do it himself or have Basa do it
But she'll get her pity moment or something
Sure, I don't expect Millaarc to actually *survive*
this is the franchise with a protagonist that was hellbent on redeeming the alchemist that wanted to dissolve the planet for revenge
~~[SYSTEMS RED]~~
and probably millaarc is being sent to mess with basa *again*
oh yeah also vanessa feels the thunder or something
bath shenanigans
so Fudou is installing some smug dude as head of song and basa can't catch a break, also DMJii keep their comedy relief streak
~~she had 2 years to practice that~~
Bikki tries to make friends with GENOCIDE tho, at this point not expecting her to pull this shit every time is being naive
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~they were there?~~
elsa can be kept around as a pet or something, millaarc is not getting out of this alive and vanessa is a maybe
and of those only SG has a narrative one ~~aside from, "this concert thing was cool, let's incorporate it in canon!"~~
unless for some reason now Faust Robes let you mess with the spirits of the dead or still keep the memory integration in such a way it can be used to manifest the stand thing, only the alchemist trio has any explanation to appear
it wasn't me, but it definitely bothered me in Prelati's road rage fight a lot
how would the geahs then
except SG laments them every minute
Gen won't die even if it kills him
<:Ver:336656981144109066> <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
papa Fudou's ruse cruise continues
I don't think befriending Bikki gives them their human bodies back
just for my birthday, awesome
it's the only one that had some sort of narrative justification (both for characters and how Amalgams were made) but yeah good to know
technically that was already kinda GX ep13 territory (the "fuck you S1 I have an armed gear" part)
yup
so basically Amalgam mode is min-maxing mode
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
holy
"Hail Sakimori"
dammit Genjuro you're supposed to switch out if confused, not leave things to RNG!
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
~~but really having him die to alca-noise would suck~~
and they don't know how the vambrace thing even works
the last time she wielded god power she turned into an ultraman reference completely out of control
which is their goal
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I mean this is the guy with the script that turns off all lights when he calls
and papa Fudou wanted more dramatic effect and sent the armed dudes for that reason
in fact, it seems like Genjuro was just dishonorably removed from position or something
and no one was imprisoned or something
I mean in the images the bridge bunnies only seemed annoyed at the smug dude that's probably in charge
then again last time I thought that they gave one of the designated jobber villains a monster kill ~~even if that only served as a statistic and some nightmare fuel for Tsubasa~~
but I don't really think they'll do much anyways
I mean, final season removes the biggest constraint: need to keep status quo
depends on how forcibly that is done <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
so basically a bit of A and a bit of B
I choose C: Vanessa gets disassembled
*[Soil blood type intensifies]*
4 hours for "better than nothing"-tier subs
~~just going on wild semantic stretches here~~
because that's how he rolls
he's been rubbing it into everyone's faces from the start
He's been parroting basically a fancy japanese way of saying "protectors/sentinels" and the god race is "custodian"
oh yeah there's the screen at the end before papa Fudou reveal
oof
wasn't the type spelled out on the packages anyways? granted that was in a later episode and they don't get the imagery along with the script
I know that, I'm mocking crunchy subs
F for smug inspector, no one is going to believe anyone else of the present just got offed
probably Fudou got the information from the inspection, told Vanessa to keep Miku as well and then she'll get hooked with Direct Feedback 3.0
it was random as fuck
the face of a man about to be turned into a fountain of blood
they're baiting, problem is we know they don't have the balls and they probably know we know but are pretending they're being clever
nope, just a random Alca-Noise
people thought it was someone being dusted in her face again IIRC
it looks like red matter from Alca-Noise or from someone dusted by them
neither Elf9 nor Miku are getting offed like that
it's definitely the inspector
was dissapointed when it wasn't (random civilian as Millaarc) <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I was honestly expecting that
and then she goes on to be forced to help the enemy team <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
inspector is already dead tho
those were great shots
been that way for a long time <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
with all what that implies
Well both him and Gen know that "nation of Japan" =/= "people" necessarily for Fudou
so yeah it could be that
He has a million reasons to believe he's being watched
gets offed because he got too close or something?
On another subject, Yatsuhiro is certainly going out of his way to believe in the man that fucked his wife because "muh pure sakimori bloodline"
if the arm gets used he will be there as well somehow because meme man, pray that it doesn't get involved
random worriesome thought I just had: Noble Red is chilling in Carol's Chateau, which is also where a certain meme man died, I *seriously hope* this is not a low key excuse to shoehorn him *again*
DMJii best comic relief
you'd think that her spamming so much AoE would cause some casualties but the evacuation game is just too stonk I guess
yeah, for comedic effect
that amount of blood is not "hurt"
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's not an easy 5 bucks because no one would take that bet
lol
Tsubasa: "Why am I here?"
good night!
~~you just wanted to keep up the new meme train going, didn't you solo?~~
nice
>"aniki" when Gen is talking to Yatsuhiro
>sub says "boss"
rofl
She'll be forced to use the gauntlet thingy that's for sure
tfw inspection crew wanted to turn the season into Metroid Other M
*[jiiiiis collectively]*
or at least what passes as an arc there
the Pokemon anime canned an entire arc because of the Fukushima incident I believe
they totally would
you'd be surprised
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
and here I am, still waiting for that one anon to make this week's gaijin chart
only that now there's no SSJ light to force unequip safely <:Ver:336656981144109066>
now whether they just recycle the same shit from G with Direct Feedback 3.0 given that they supposedly captured Elf9 as well or not is the uncertainty
probably just a BD bonus

the custom ducks are so cute
In other news, gaijin chart anon still hasn't shown up, I hope he's just busy drawing Millaarc gaijins
well 11:15 if you need to be exact
the impression thing
11:12 mark
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Tsubasa: "Why am I here? I should be training to be a better Sakimori"
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
he's already dead
and I guess Miku is traumatized due to the blood fountain
F for inspector
they didn't actually *need* it since it basically meant "Bikki do your usual thing, only this time you need less punches after you close in probably"
~~but I wanted the reference~~
they actually do
because Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space
till it hits something
into space
they just keep going
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1157823356063932416
zoid referenced it on his twitter, it's probably one of the untranslated ones
If you know Fudou he's probably being watched, I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up getting offed due to getting too close or something
so basically Yatsuhiro loves her and a fuck you to his father
According to a GX keyword, Basa has her name instead of a number reference because Yatsuhiro wanted her to be free from Kazanari family BS
>Millaarc singing
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I'll give it two threads for it to settle
up in the air which will stick
due to the anon showing up late we have two completely different versions

<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
inb4 it suffers the beef stroganoff fate
name of smugface
yeah but it's normally reserved for villains, not for random mook about to be ended
seriously though what was up with that?
I'll say it again, the face of a man about to be turned into a fountain of blood
I'm just saying that out of the 4 present, it's obvious that the one who got offed was expendable mcsmugface, it's probably the weakest cliffhanger in the series
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
also took down a building to kill a single human sized noise <:Ver:336656981144109066>
friendly fire by accident is completely out of the question
She spammed AoE and burned 6 blocks, no casualties
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
not Bikki
it's Tsubasa the one who's supposed to go ballistic
everyone knows it's expendable mcsmugface
guess you can't be a reject without your body itself glitching out


<:Ver:336656981144109066>
then on the last frame switches to the wrong one
one frame it's the correct hand
it's funnier than that
and there we have it
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
other than some people asking for some bored gaijins and put less stuff in it, it's not that heated of a discussion
this is the version that will probably get included in the actual chart
well after the "kill" cringe I'd try to get the titles fixed as well
Fudou probably found out with the investigation team and he has both the wielder and someone versed into the same kind of direct feedback system used to control said wielder in a previous season in the same place, that said he'll probably still try the "reforge this into a sword a sakimori can use" angle and kidnapping Miku is maybe something on Vanessa's end
so it checks out <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
same director
from YuGiOh 5Ds
Junk Warrior
yay
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
someone pull the junk warrior comparison pls
rofl
blame the curse of balal for fucking up the understanding of the message
because ToMaTo AnAlOgY
honestly the Linker arc in AXZ would've screwed itself even without meme man
another is hijacking the plot
one thing is being shoehorned as an annoying navi-like entity
~~please no~~
there's a bigger chance of the plot being hijacked by Ver's arm eating the vambrace than him getting redemption
other because fan favorite
one because Nana wills it
for completely extra-narrative reasons
same with Chris
Tsubasa is the closest we have to an immortal character
so yeah
both him and Gen are failures in Fudou's eyes at this point
for a variety of reasons
still, everyone has plot armor aside from bridge bunnies and gen
I get that Elfnein doesn't get to do all that much but not having anyone that can somewhat tinker with your morphers a bit just in case seems like a bad idea
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
of course
to troll us
they get really hungry afterwards apparently
~~probably because trying to go the geah route is not exactly cheap due to VA~~
~~this is without counting botched adaptations that end up changing characters making a bad source material even worse~~
You know the isekai genre has gotten out of hand when generic fantasy gets called "native isekai" which doesn't make a lick of sense
the Val Verde junta however...
The alchemists I could *kinda* buy not happening so easily
Just imagine if someone caught an alchemist or the junta in Val Verde using a noise crystal on video and posted it in the symphonet.
"That's odd, that blue haired sword wielder dealing more property damage than the noise she's fighting kinda looked like Tsubasa"
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
not until we're almost ending the season
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~she's probably worried Tsubasa's AoE spam got her~~
And also added wubwub protocol which almost always worsened the song used as base
You have Amalgam, there's your powerup and it actually works as a min-max mode instead of a straight upgrade like Ignite which meant every time they were not using it they were holding back
Wouldn't it be hilarious if the madmen actually did it and it had no negative effect in JP sales whatsoever?
This has honestly reached levels equivalent to seeing a normal person being impaled, shot with a gatling gun and then explode with dynamite and then saying it's not dead because we haven't been shown the body.
Forever doomed to the NanoFate route
here, no guarantees that it won't change a bit once episode 6 one comes out though since I haven't kept up with the threads but saw some variations trying to add even more stuff on top after this was posted
was referring more about their efforts to keep deniability as much as possible ending up being pointless
me neither tbh
but it's better than being completely lost in moonrunes
oh absolutely
actually there was a fantranslation for NoWaYu and it was pretty quick so no issues there
yes I know, but it pisses me off I'll never see Scorpio make everyone cry animated
Sorry have to rage every time about that when someone mentions that franchise
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
No the Yuuki Yuuna way is having a prequel LN everyone in the fanbase wants adapted and not adapt it, also get fuck all in terms of funding for the second part of S2
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
by that logic I have a friend that pretty sure lives in 2015 instead of the current year by now
obviously
it's not

cursed video btw

"why is this pronounced like that?" "dunno, because fuck you it's English"

oh yeah
so yes, you get huge differences even among the latin american countries
that's the example that always comes to mind when you mention that here

yes
Spanish is cool, now the spanish we speak in Chile... whole different subject and everyone that hears us speak will agree unless they're chileans themselves
She's the dense shonen protagonist
About the Eiai thing, how in the fuck can you believe that? I know I said yesterday the not showing the body comparison after someone being obviously dead, but this one is like saying it's not dead yet after seeing the body because the corpse isn't visibly rotting
doesn't DMJii have the issue of having a bit too many waifuers flocking to Kirika?

I've always wanted to win a single cent on a bet
going to assume Elf9's face in the previews is just her crying being interrupted by "wait, the fuck? did she just kill that smug asshole instead of Miku? man that's a looooot of blood"
yeah, and that was traumatizing, doesn't mean she won't be shocked at a dude being decapitated/cut in half in her face
Normally the dead people she sees on screen are turned into red dust, not gored in a clearly overkill fashion
Miku is not dead, Elf9 is just shocked because of the gorefest mook mcsmugface was turned into
like you don't call Gungnir "Swaying one" or whatever it meant in old norse, so what gives?
anyways, why was the name translated to Heavenrend?
they just needed a name for the bow they were giving to their Ullr reference
yup
Ichaival was spelled ichii-bal in the FE Museum apparently <:Ver:336656981144109066>
time to mute
so probably no effect on the crunchy stream where most people get their initial fix before not shit subs are up
1 hour and only one channel
or use for whatever
what was up with the bunch of autoscorer rejects that they wanted to activate though?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
my life is complete
I always wanted to win a single cent on a bet, now I've done it
yay
Miku woke up and grabbed the vambrace while the other 2 were busy
also wth Ogawa you can't just apply your ninja shenanigans to your car
Figures Noble Red would be into rushing god
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
oh yeah I have to check shitpost central now
now after seeing it can also work like that I'm certain
I mean before when we thought it just locked her in despair state it was possible
no after credits
no
so now we get a three way battle for the cocoon between SONG, Basa (as Fudou's proxy) and Noble Red?
got a cocoon
he comissioned a sword
I mean Fudou will be mad
ok
oh
no cackling evil, that's not his schtick, he'll put a spin about "protecting Japan" and all to it, but still
so probably going to drop the pretenses after this anyways
and Noble Red probably just backstabbed him
well SONG already knows of his bullshit
I mean he can have his fist fight with Fudou
most likely
bang
grabbed vambrace
Miku woke up
Probably God cocoon, only this time there's no gear to prevent complete fusion (Gungnir prevented that in AXZ, didn't it?)
but combo breaker still
not all of them tho
so we have our first bored gaijins

~~he was missing the same right?~~
most likely
It's Enki's hand
it's probably just a reference, but damn the pattern is the same
wtf
oh fuck
so next up is a giant Miku, right?
There was no reason to believe she would actually go ahead and fiddle with it (and she wouldn't have had the Vambrace not called her)
I mean she didn't know she could wield the thing, probably didn't know what it was but she does know it's a bad idea to fiddle with unknown stuff in this universe

Fudou be like "I ORDERED A SWORD, WHY DID YOU GIVE ME A COCOON WITH A GAY SCHOOLGIRL IN IT?"
it's not really much of a stretch
She was being called by the Vambrace
* teleports behind you *
"it's ninjutsu, I don't have to explain shit"
I mean he could sure unleash his daughter on Noble Red, but aside from moral satisfaction what good will that do for him?
sword is completely out of the picture and I don't think Fudou will like that the girl that almost told him to go fuck himself is now in charge of his prize
things got out of hand
he ordered a sword and now thanks to Noble Red acting on their own all he has is a cocoon with a gay schoolgirl inside
they had no intention on keeping their end of the bargain after that
then why did they took the wielder
~~or more like Miku doing it herself but you get the idea~~
and there's nothing bigger in this episode than Noble Red rushing the divine summon
it's always the wham
in the previous episode's one
also I think a shitload of stuff got added
anon going for simple this time
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so that means Fine unknowingly made a gear out of the hand of the guy she wanted to fuck
and at least they won't solve this shit in 15 minutes like last time so I consider this an absolute win regardless
but won't be surprised at giant size
I am hoping human size this time
inb4 it's small
~~yes I know~~
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
>Crunchy translated Lulu Amel as "Ruru Amel"
Argetlam is most likely Enki's arm, so definitely some ties with the other Custodian
Murica in geah is a joke, they will get handwaved by GodMiku
Fudou beyond pissed his keikaku just got trolled
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
he just watched a movie with Genjuro or something
I quote myself
crazy driving stunts
it got smashed?
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
poor Elfnein also got bullied just because Millaarc felt like being a dick
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it would've been hilarious if Elfnein just started talking and Noble Red were like "oh so that's a thing? We were just going to use her as a hostage, but your idea sounds better"
they weren't free until Illuminati collapse, yes
it just needs to be stored on the SONG database, which the users probably don't fiddle with
one of them is a cyborg, planting something on the team to spy on them is not that farfetched
inspection team
and fast
she's regressing
at least that's what some googling is telling me
Apparently "Lulu Amelu" are basically the humans created by the Annunaki by mixing the genes of earth hominids with their own
SONG: "It's just incomprehensible noise!"
Maria's thoughts: "What the hell are you talking about? It's clearly a song!"
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wik18z78Y
of course the video was going to be this
just stay dead, you sandbagged way more than necessary on your fight
at best it leaves them wondering who got killed until a blood analysis because no body, but other than that...
it's not like it's useful to not leave traces since she leaves a mess anyways
it's just a trick she learned because it looks cool
what. the. fuck.
so now I'm curious, in the way you'd watch a trainwreck but curious nonetheless
I'm gonna join you on that, that kind of idea was fun to read in My Sunshine and it would be a blast to watch animated
thank you for your hard work YT! <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
awesome! I get to do my rewatch now instead of tomorrow
nani?
Millaarc almost matched SG's body count in 10 minutes
The thing is if he can actually do anything about it beyond sending Basa ~~of course he can he will pull kusanagi out of his ass after Basa snaps out of it who am I kidding~~
~~A custodian that can't deal with one glutton boy without suicide song~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~inb4 the vambrace is also a relay of sorts that calls a full Custodian invasion~~
if it were just an infinity gauntlet without a mind of its own he would've wanted to use it
Adam was terrified of whatever was in the coffin
I mean, Miku will probably not be in control
that shouldn't really last too long, biggest problem is that Bikki will not want to use her godslayer on Miku
Lulu amel is just how the Annunaki call mankind
I mean can't blame you when they install a literal low-key mind control device on you
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
well this season started with a line straight out of heaven's feel so go figure
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Ver with divine power... I think the rest of the characters would just kill themselves to avoid the insane ramblings that would ensue
now that probably won't end in random civilians being killed, more like she'll be thrown at the other geahs
because things are headed that way for sure
I have some bad news for you if you don't want her to be broken
I think that would've pushed her waaaaay too deep into the despair pit once she realized what she did <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
They weren't going to show Basa burning people to death with her overkill AoE spam given recent events
Millaarc uses that thing just because it looks cool, and leaving the body bleeding out gives more shock points to mess with Basa so she didn't bother.
If the guy Fine loved is Enki, and Airgetlam was the arm he was missing at the start of the season, then Fine unknowingly made a gear out of the arm of the guy she wanted to fuck
Given what's been shown all I can guess now is that the Airgetlam Symphogear's creation is one of the saddest ironies in the series, to the point I'm expecting someone to say that out loud
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
now if that also lets the vambrace add their properties to itself....
yeah I suppose that could be it
oh ok
it was just odd seeing the pattern on Vanessa's display of the place where they were holding the vambrace
I mean it's already the reason why Miku is being used
I meant in XV if the pattern ends up being more than just reference cause Mikugear
If the relic slayer gets combined with divine power everyone else is completely and utterly fucked <:Ver:336656981144109066>
By the way, what was up with the random SSJ patterns? Probably just a reference but it was weird how it was the same thing
then Bikki jumps in and yaddayaddayadda
I mean if he straight up wants the Vambrace right here, right now he might as well order Basa to attack Miku
Depends on what Fudou wants to do with Basa now that he got Miku'd out of his prize
~~We need a Fudou emote~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~come at me~~

I will figuratively explode if they end up being madmen and give a gay ending to any of the potential pairings
All gears gone camp over here as well
~~she has 2 on top of her regular arms now tho~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I have to say Gungnir did a pretty swell job with her arm considering it didn't get SSJ'd later
lewder version got scrapped in concept phase, not a single animated frame of it exists
Audience waifu
~~or they're into dumpster diving~~
>not mentioning the wannabe sexbot
that's a BD bonus tho, but yeah maybe?
and a rapist
Ver being a creep
no seriously, that's the reason for the electrocution thing
~~removing Nehushtan parts~~
though really that's par for the course for Bikki so I guess she just chalks it up to her usual thing
Kinda weird how she hasn't gone ballistic on Hibiki for trying to befriend them that time
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
*within about 10 minutes*
the kill count
it's 7x that tho
something something Zeus something <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I love how we have an in-universe almighty excuse for all the "why didn't they just talk?" scenarios
production issues or side B is a villain/spoilerish song because papa Fudou's wild ride
~~inb4 Ver shows up and the sheer rage at the meme man makes Carol come back~~
can't argue with that
also the Miku kidnapping was part of Fudou's ruse cruise because he learned about the vessel thing through the inspection team (so yes, the info was on SONG's database)
I'm reading what some anons are saying about the keywords, apparently the US in the geahverse started the Iraq war by saying the Relics were the WMDs
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
~~I'm joking~~
hey if life gives you lemons...
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what if someone picks up the control word for Basa's seal and just uses it to send her to attack Fudou, papa Fudou answers in kind and then they end up playing tennis with Basa?
It would have been a real kicker had Fine reincarnated in Maria and still lived subconsciously until they find out what exactly the relic was: "Wait, we're wearing *his arm* as power armor right now?"
so Bikki has Minesweeper installed?
~~and now I just got DBZA Piccolo/Neil scenes ideas in my head but with Fine and the FIS trio~~

inb4 nothing and the show spins its wheels for 3 episodes more
"better than nothing"-tier subs are out
I have to say the ||GX CD cover reference in the whopping 2 frames that the Autoscorers show up in the henshin is amazing, especially when you realize Micha gets 2 poses because in one frame she's doing Shirabe's and in the other Kirika's||
maybe the real universal language were the screams we made along the way
gaijin chart will be interesting to say the least
*[screams externally]*
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
it just makes the wait for subs even more agonizing
I'm not that allergic to spoilers tbh and for this one in particular I'm not even mad
people exploding that is
I want to see the explosions
yeah, don't
(got spoiled due to refreshing a thread without looking at the time, I ain't even mad)
oh my
even the nameless bridge bunnies at the back
everyone in the room noticed it probably
by the way, Basa has completely regressed, flat out lost it or both
"ok, I had enough of your shit, give me the harp, I'm going GENOCIDE on these shitters" -Elf9, probably
ok, now that I watched it for myself: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
sure why not
I mean if Solomon's Cane can survive whatever the heck happened with Fine
they were practically crumbling by just walking
oh now
other way around man
F
DMJii can shit on Prelati with vanilla gears if they're using non-shitty Linker, their unison shenanigans are absurd
but whatever, they did all they could now
from what I remember Micha actually got beaten
but Garie was sandbagging and screaming "First!"
Micha *maybe* didn't
Garie is the hardest to judge because she threw the fight as soon as Ignite was present back in GX
in their full power a single one of them would've shitted on the jobbers no biggie
yup
a *reject*
that thing is from what I understood
unless hit by Gungnir but as we saw it clearly has countermeasures now
divine power is a bitch
even if she had it
not really
so not really expecting her to be erased, just weaker because no way she's keeping seven billion zesshou shenanigans
I mean the excuse to handwave it and have both live after this is there, and you don't have to give a shit about status quo if you're ending the series
at most they're burning Carol instead of Elf9
of course they'll just double down on the old geezer's plan
at this point
they might want to consider giving it up
ItS a SwOrD oK?
anyways, Vanessa really needs a hand after today's episode
the revolvers got introduced by using 2
no idea why she didn't pull another one and shoot her with that
she does have 2 revolvers tho?
they also get trolled every single season aside from GX
they can't even nuke people right
muricans are a joke in this series
idea for the chart was having the gaijins be autoscorers
too bad it just made Carol surface <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
the bullying on Elf9 was to make the seal thing work
Noble Red can't teleport away since their waypoint is the Chateau btw
so you think she wrecks them, even match or ends up jobbing to Noble Red?
I mean the only reason they're not moving to shit on Fudou is because the god fetus and rescuing Miku and Elf9 is more important
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
but not that it wasn't even consistent
I caught the mispelled Micha while watching
lol
are you fucking kidding me?
technically the finger is also a gun
Billion Maiden has 6 barrels on each gun
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
another one
oh
about the Ver thing
<@152422489417318400>
Ver already lives rent free in Maria's head so yeah
just hope damage is minimal
Fully expecting him to be memed back because meme man
at some point as Vanessa you might want to consider that maybe the universe doesn't want you to continue down this path
yup it's awesome
I mean this series already went full weird shit when Satan, the leader of the Illuminati, was trying to steal god's power to get revenge on aliens
Satan
now it's like "I'll be a good sakimori, I'm a *good* sakimori, right Kanade?"
she's anything but ok
she's lost it
/cue the Junk Warrior animation
~~"I summon Hibiki the Godslayer in attack mode! Attack Vanessa's life points directly!"~~
because stealing moves from everyone and all
argetlam is what megaman would use if he were a gear user
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Bikki cares because that's her deal, rest probably only do because Bikki cares, except Basa who just wants to cut Millaarc in half
should've kept a philosopher stone in her pocket <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
she gonna die son

Now that we have TL'd lyrics of Carol's new song, yeah she's gonna burn whatever remains of her to hold off Noble Red

so one more for the Piccolo/Nail brigade if both of them survive this mess
since the stand got dismissed as "cool story bro"
I wonder if everyone heard the Amalgam duet or they just heard Bikki not sing some of the lines randomly
just take solace in that Noble Red is probably also gonna die by the end of all this (not by Carolnein's hand but choking on their own shitty bet for the old geezer)
gonna have to settle for rioting there
she smol
the CDs are physical things, they need to be held somewhere after they're produced, someone's gonna spill the beans if it's a thing
not album but song I mean
Miku is kind of a given
BD BoNuS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpE8VqcQ2uc
yo CR, that's the wrong logo in your thumbnail
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
thanks
speaking of highlights, need to make the rounds to see if the chart is already up
he's gonna explode at Carolnein right?
I saw his reaction to the concert disaster
Carol's brand of alchemy uses memory combustion
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Hey she's the slayer of miracles and she herself appearing was a miracle so...
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241> shame about that but it's probably what will happen
(YT version)
less strange wording
Problem is, they wanted to save Miku and were told that forcibly removing the gear would cause brain damage
If any of the gears would've gone all out with no regard for her safety Miku would've gotten trounced
or so the explanation was IIRC
SSJ was actually weaksauce, it's just that the beam was hard countering gears because Miku's wish boosted the relic's properties to become that
so kitten vs doggo?
the references are pinned by the way
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
animation slips hardcore
it's the end of the season
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Alternative: To bait people in pre-release promotional materials
leave that one to british Basa on a spinoff or something
well ok, "Airgetlam (placeholder name)"
Airgetlam, which is most likely Enki's missing arm
nope, in some parts it's called "The Star Money" as well
pretty sure that was more than one building
amusingly enough bike-kun *did* survive Prelati's road rage
and Carol told her to fuck off
yeah the massive phonic gain there now makes a bit more sense
will we get "DURDABLA DATTO"?
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
except Kanade's not actually there so
Tsubasa lost it and has regressed to S1 moebasa
yes
which as I said, would make for hilarious shenanigans if someone at SONG picks up what it is
that's just the control word probably
so yeah, probably not going to work on anyone else
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
miracle man foretelling the return of the slayer of miracles
I'm just praying damage is kept to a minimum
and expect to be called a hero for that
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
when you ruin the plan you yourself put into motion
and of course that's without Bikki hesitating due to Miku being the wielder which of course will be a thing
~~yes I know it's because it would be boring otherwise~~
and that thing's a *reject of excess energy*
subdues it and takes it out of the picture
fetus identifies the threat
yeah and look what good the hard counter did for her
We have literal god power capable of saying fuck you to logic involved
`In other words, we have no idea. At all.`
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
depends
or  just Kaneko memeing
things that get posted in the official site with additional info that didn't make it into the show
they already got robbed by Noble Red this season
so who trolls them at the end when they try to be relevant this time?
thanks
yes I know about that last part, was just wondering if the origin was from the gear and Ver just made use of it or if he modified the thing
one question about that now that we're at it: the direct feedback thing for SSJ was originally part of the gear or Ver added that feature?
the only thing that matter is that they were using fragments on the vambrace seal
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so she can gearjack anyone
a lot of shit is going to get cut
part of being used to write for RPGs and then be constrained to 13 episodes
toss throwaway nonsense that could be used in the future if you're hoping to get a sequel at some point
making shit up as you go along 101
and then Bikki nullified her plan B by befriending
The assumption would be Fine gave it to her after stealing it from Fudou, but yeah not explained or confirmed
Miku's insane feats?
(meant the explosion after Fine died, not the trillion degree hell)
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
somehow the cane survived the explosion and found itself in a completely different location
wasn't being gunned down due to starting to rush the plan?
*relic
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
inb4 it's actually Elfnein LARPing as Carol and she burns a bunch of her own memories to fight Noble Red
that was just sad
aside from the crybaby moment when his god hand gets trolled after snatching the divine power
Adam is just there but I don't actually hate him as a villain, just thought he was underutilized
but really the only gear villain I dislike a lot is Ver
that dude was also trash from my vague recollection of StrikerS
and that he was only elevated by Sugita to meme man
Kaneko himself admitted he was written as throwaway mad scientist
GX gets shit on because Bikki randomly going "muh Gungnir" at the start (among other things), top dad, dolls throwing fights and mishandled episodic lull, not because of Carol herself
gotta keep piling up the S1 callbacks I guess
Gen
~~best way to troll your local DMJii as well, didn't think I'd laugh in the middle of the final battle~~
oh the telephone meme is great
he has some fun things and a somewhat interesting concept going for him, but that was underutilized so he just comes off as being there
>going "muh Gungnir" on Maria after she saved her and her friends
>understandable
no, that was random as fuck, the not wanting to fight bit I can kinda understand however
>punch
"moshi moshi, Kirika dess?"
that's the idea
~~is it wrong I can picture an even more of a gag version of that where the punch comes out of the phone itself after Kirika answers the call?~~
>season name in episode 8 instead of 12
oh shit
pattern has been broken
~~so Gen's eye thing from AXZ was inherited from Fudou~~
so yeah rip
mutual annihilation with nehushtan
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
>Full relics being activated and used
So Fudou is indeed pulling Kusanagi out of his ass, got it
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
the hamster already got wrecked by the fetus reject of actual god tho
they broke the rules <:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~yes I know~~
at least that's what the pattern was until now
second to last episodes are the season name, last is tagline except for GX I believe
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I guess
at least in terms of broad idea
just better execution
yes
gg
now they die
decided to double down on the wrong horse
well they had plenty of chances to bail out of the Fudou gamble
that was funny, figured it might happen this episode last week since Carol showed up
I mean we have the imagery, the shards and he said he has a way to counter god killer that sounded more confident than relying on just hesitation
or at least from what I understood from Fudou's monologue
they're fucked
he has relic killer
that's bullshit, I love it
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so what does XV mean? Didn't catch it from watching the episode <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
so now KaMiku casually tosses them around a bit and fucks off to the moon, right?
well they used the same power source, checks out I guess
he could be a usurper or something for all we know
"how did these losers give you so much trouble again?"
"Why can't anything nice happen?"
that's a pretty subdued reaction to seeing the one you're supposed to save disintegrating
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
nice
so she discovered applied troll science on alchemy
just ctrl+C and ctrl+V lmao
did carol just figure out how to cheat the flaw of her own alchemy or something by the way?

it's plenty of time, a heck of a lot more than this show usually gets when it gets to a similar point
probably, there's always an error screen
lol
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
>Japanese ultranationalist
>uses sumerian-kinda vambrace with shards of chinese relic as his master plan
Fudou please
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
lol
we're ded
oh now she is
internal conflict among custodians and stuff
rewatching the KaMiku henshin, was that a noise summoning sound at the start?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
thought that was bikki
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's clearly a ghost type attack and humans are normal type
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just gets supereffective bonus on relics or something
well it's still a beam ~~that apparently ignores flesh or somthing~~
do we use the mikugear reference or x-drive this episode?
yes
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
calm down
"Tsubasa shut the fuck up for a second and let me handle this"
go to the moon, disable balal curse and that somehow allows him/her to control the planet?
so, what's Shem-ha's endgame anyways?
they're all getting ~~cleansed~~ trounced by super beam next week anyways
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
silly Maria, you don't use your ultimate form this early and expect it to work!
gotta keep milking them whales
it basically is though I do wonder what was up with the noise sound in the henshin
most of them aren't all that necessary tbh unless you want to catch every minute reference
didn't the henshin have the Aufwachen Wave of SSJ as background
the little victories
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
hey at least the logo is right
~~Fudo is just a servant~~
please no
getting AXZ flashbacks
not this shit again
pretty convinced shem-ha will pull the relic erasing properties from the SSJ shards, which is functionally the same shit as having SSJ
seven billion zesshou pls
he's not going to
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ask Kaneko
(I don't think people are saying it's literally a gear)
it's a literal god all it needs is to take the mirror pieces as base and absorbs its properties at which point whether it's a gear or not is entirely semantics
yup
yeah, the gear, not all the entire half mirror they found
and the henshin in G was not in the episodes themselves
nope, just fix animation errors
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so you're saying Millaarc smashing the camera with the wrong hand might stick?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
inb4 it's the japanese regalia
no she had half a mirror
gear was completely erased by its own beam
*Shem-ha! I've come to bargain!*
Well part of the god slayer *is* her reach and connect deal so sure why not
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
of course it could be a random reference
wasn't the labyrinth the same length as the distance to the moon or something?
calling it: they die using a modified Daedalus End to get the party to the moon for the final battle
until then we can keep sinking
obviously not, she reaches rock bottom when she team kills/backstabs someone
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~if you watched it on youtube for whatever reason the ED montage just got cut~~
I was saying more that they're technically still Ignite songs due to how they're used, but since they don't have wub protocol on top yeah they don't count
but those dont have regular version so the argument is kinda nullified there
unless you count the unison songs in which case the number gets bumped up a bit
aside from as you said, like 3 exceptions
at least from what I hear here
not really much of a controversial opinion
please
stop ruining the song
wub protocol what are you doing
omfg
The thing is the only way I can see him being memed back is with Shem-ha fucking with the dead
~~because no, AXZ Linker arc did not crash due to Ver, it crashed because Kaneko thinks children are tomatoes~~
I mean so far we haven't crashed and burned, it would be a total shame if we were to just for memes
but please don't meme him back into relevancy again
He technically already was plot relevant enough without even being named
and the one where he said he'd repopulate the planet using Maria
even the main writer agrees Ver fans are only a thing because Sugita made him a meme
(of the group of friends I mean)
tfw the one that thinks is not doing what she wanted is the one that gets paid the most
final battle might be on the moon all things considered
just so that Noble Red doesn't have the highest body count of the season
They're going to get dabbed on by Shem-ha, as in she will literally throw the nuke back at them
whatever she does to Fudou unless he has another ace up his sleeve doesn't matter much considering a much bigger fish just entered the fray
inb4 Basa pulls the eyes when she betrays SONG
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Gen
~~of course it won't work but watch them try it because the vambrace is a relic~~
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
just reflect the beam when she uses SSJ function or something
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
some people say that means the original is dead and just a copy of the original was created
well she did disintegrate into atoms and reforms again
I mean if they wanted to go for it, sure go ahead, but don't transition into doing fuck all for years after that ending
AI YO
something something Kaneko said it'd be a happy ending something
welcome to Shem-ha's divine ride
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so what, Igalima does fuck all then?
lol
"oh I was only banished to hell, and apparently the guy down there couldn't stand me so I'm back"
this is the show where Ctrl + C and Crtl + V is a valid power source
Wild Arms 3 I believe has literally Fudou as a villain from what I've heard
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
or at least that's what people who played Wild Arms tell me
because that's all he knows
so he will repeat the plot points of his previous stuff
Kaneko is a hack
kek
patterns I guess
that was just them saying "hey we still care"
inb4 Custodians just use vessels to reincarnate and Enki just put a stop to it with the curse of Balal
also his arm is the base for Maria's gear (Enki)
~~no wait, that was Wild Arms 2~~
no just showed him seemingly activating it
but chose to do it
they could've just not created the invincible dusting monsters
The curse is not the reason per-se
considering everyone's still kicking and all
dooming it seems kind of a stretch
Fine can summon noise
she'll just let them live because they're beneath dealing with or something
~~except Noble Red, those guys just zerg rush a concert and then lose every fight~~
she'll have to fuck off instead of trying to kill them for the plot to continue
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
wipe the floor with them, then extended monologue or the other way around?
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
yup
~~that knows the formula of course~~
Alcanoise literally just have an alchemist make you a crystal
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
they just do whatever they want after that instead of obeying her without cane
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
~~dead~~
also yeah she's missing the "why am I here?" face
S1 because of artstyle
IIRC after that she kicks her ass and then Chris goes ZENBU in the next ep
B side is in episode 6, when she fights Nehushtan Chris and Miku finds out what she's doing
depends on whether she fucks off to the moon I think
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so the scorpion went divine along with Tiki in AXZ?
It's not the same kind of armlet thingy that they showed when Vanessa talked about the Iraq thing
yeah it's always been "copy/jack of all trades" gear
oh ok
Did they make a fuss about it in GX or just in keywords?
instead of outright bringing her back
they can always just flashback in the middle of some exposition by Shem-ha
it's something
hey in LWA she got to ferry around the MC and fire the finisher
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
from Kaneko's writing
goddammit Maria
forgot the /s
~~I'm being sarcastic~~
who cares
no biggie
just nuke the place
also collection of relics, the japanese gov for sure will just give up on those
it's in the middle of a part of the freaking city too
About Shem-ha preferring a to use a body of its own, it depends on the approach they take with her, like if she intended to life forever using vessels and the Curse of Balal fucked with her plan then she won't give a shit
I guess it depends on whether the "using an expy from another reality" gimmick applies to soul damage
just leave as in just fuck off to the moon?
they're shown damaged when it's just sitting there I think so any time where they're intact it's indeed an error <:Ver:336656981144109066>
(the second one I mean)
they're damaged even before the attack
those were hit by Bikki in the previous chapter
you mean the tentacles that were destroyed?
Again, why would you mention your random lab rats at any point, that's what Noble Red was, they're not even shit tier enforcers for the Illuminati
They don't even warrant mentioning, seriously why would you mention your random lab rats
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
then have the owner come collect the unpaid rent
sure, throw another nuke so that people can see again murica not being able to even nuke people right
I was talking about what BlackRaiden said
pretty sure the perfect body thing involves some sacrifices and stuff, no way you can just mass produce it
(Vanessa was at some point yes, but not anymore after the accident with the Faust Robe tech)
something something hold hands something
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
"our gears had that junk from Bikki installed on them, right? Then technically we have a piece of Gungnir, therefore, fuck you Shem-ha"
(to destroy the divine concept and stuff I mean)
By the way since we're at it, how did Carol even plan to control it? Didn't she need a relic to do that and both relics that can do so were destroyed?
yeah Carol blew a hole in it
it was destroyed because Ver messed it up I believe?
Yeah no, I have very little room to believe any goverment would just destroy it instead of slowly dismantle it to make use of whatever it has
because I would be absolutely livid
>they somehow remove the vambrace from Miku
>it falls to a pit by the Chateau
>Sugita cackles
how mad would you be?
*Oversoul*
they mutually destroyed each other because their whole gimmicks were complete opposites or something (Durandal and Nehushtan)
no it wasn't
unstoppable force and immovable object clashed, deleted each other
ninja on standby or something <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
they seem to get relatively free retreats anyway
But now that Fudo's also in... I dunno
Previously it was just gag strength for Gen
Custodian-esque lineage or something
in the top dad season no less
I think he had that award locked in way back in GX, *without even showing up*
also his death makes for excellent drama and suffering
he's the mentor figure, he's not needed to shill CDs and status quo be damned if you're ending this
he's the easiest blood sacrifice
Gen will die this time if he comes out
the problem is I don't think they'll have the time for that considering basically god has just manifested and Fudou seems to be done with pretenses what with the evil laughter and whatnot
She's just tired but she can always recharge if Elf9 spends enough time with the direct feedback machine
CR (which is what HS posts) had that I believe
I would argue that they'd need memories to power them up but since Carol9 hacked the matrix with lolJustCopyPaste, yeah...
Since Gen was slimmer before the Zwei Wing incident after all
Also maybe whatever they have going on just determines how high/fast you peak with training or something, we'll see
Fudou is also over a hundred years old and strong enough to scare Millaarc
also Elf9 let them get away to save Miku, Carol was just going to pursue and finish them off
I meant before the Daedalus End
She was trouncing them so completely I was expecting some snarky comment to the geahs along the lines of "how come the ones who beat me had trouble getting rid of this trash?".
~~geah cheats with concert lottery tho~~
Fine has only been mentioned OP aside
~~please don't~~
reminder that the SG ghost was literally just "cool story bro" from Bikki to the rest of the team
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
yep
I would love it to
calling it now, Shem-ha retains relic killer ssj bs but has reduced effectiveness in defense mode of Amalgam due to the Philosopher's Stone part not counting as a relic or something.
S1 I believe he shows up?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Still doesn't beat Kirika's string of poor choices in G
I don't remember any mythology in Psycho Pass off the top of my head
also Ver called it out in G when they tried to use zesshou against Bikki
🍅
Kaneko thinks children are tomatoes
this has been said before
that's been a thing since freaking G
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
the one that ends in using the soul destroying scythe on Shirabe because she loves her
Without having to pull them from the treasure
Problem is, it doesn't matter, she'd be old enough to actually know how to make them
We don't have confirmation but that's been the theory so far
what was up with the Noise sfx in the middle of Shem-ha's henshin btw? She'll start summoning the vanilla variant or something?
she'll talk some, trounce them to establish she's the real deal, call them beneath even bothering to kill and fuck off to the moon
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
him being behind 70k deaths is more than enough already
it'd be really strange and contrived
and I doubt they'd pull the "Fudo actually was working with Fine" card
Fine was the one who arranged the conditions that resulted in her being dusted though
if it's resolved in a single episode what follows would have to be pretty amazing for me to not be absolutely livid
because Carol's return was already spoiled by them too
Carol trouncing the jobbers is unexpected?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ83K3nXv6M
ffs sake CR
oh yeah the Tsubasa CD release being strangely spaced and all that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
or they'll jump in the wrong season due to the naming of the seasons
wait what?
like if you're going to go wild with the spoilers at least finish the previous season quickly
CR's AXZ release is the biggest shitshow of all this if you ask me
em, how about using the actual fight for that?
dammit CR
fail
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
not actual Noise kills
and most were death by trampling
actually no, only like 5k died on Zwei Wing concert
what with that one girl being kebab'd  and all
~~well they kinda did both~~
just saying who I think came up with what
yeah, not interested in making any excuses for the lot
now how to actually zerg rush the place to maximize kills was probably Elsa and Millaarc's idea
I think Fudou told them to attack the concert because he's an evil asshole
the face of a big sister choking on her poor choice of allies

~~they're japan-only, oh wait...~~
lol
she wanted that and rule everyone else
Fine wouldn't have actually killed every single human since that ruins her plans
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
>dad episode
>takes out the only good dad
wouldn't that be a kicker?
slightly worried
the oh shit faces from bridge bunnies
him taking the field
no but seriously
"I have neutralized the wound with a martial arts technique"
so he maybe won't end up being killed off
I kinda feared for Gen at first but then I realizes pv pics never amount to much
I love how everyone is already expecting this to be bad because top dad showed up
looks like I was right and Shem-ha will fuck off to the moon
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
like Genjuro being killed!
then watch the chaos tomorrow about the rest
just say whatever is obvious
Why would he reveal the twists
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
emphasis on *try*
lol
I hate Akira as much as any other guy but I am strangely not expecting him to crash and burn the episode
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
now they're infinitely stronger
I mean I was certainly talking about battle ability but only taking G FIS into consideration
Noble Red is FIS levels of weak trash
this is the girl that was about to befriend the group that crashed that concert hall with no survivors
inb4 yet another flashback to a few moments ago to throw off the order of the pics
Nephilim was more just T-pose bodyblock than fight by the end
~~unless Fudou is actually a custodian of course~~
unlike whatever the custodians did which set pretty much everything else in motion in some way
he isn't behind anything but NR's shenanigans
don't see him as final villain even with the wild ride he has going on
either he'll play second fiddle to Shem-ha or will choke on his ambitions
he's not going to hijack the plot
no reason to believe the cannon fodder will be any different
Shem -ha will just summon some Noise, the thing even had a Noise sound effect in the middle of the henshin
how is that any different bottom line? <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
So it's just Shem-ha using the guy we know as vessel
Yes I'd be that fucking mad
Erasing itself from continuity through time travel is the single thing that retroactively makes the series 1/10 for me
and we all know last hit is going to Hibiki
The thing with Fudou is that he should be dealt with by Basa
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
well they already did that for AXZ
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Also I love how top dad showing up is all that takes for people to immediately lose all hope
I swear to ~~Shem-ha~~ god I burn all 3 of my geah nendos if he does something like that
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
there's plenty of blood where they were now
The only revival those 3 idiots deserve is as mindless puppets to be used as cannon fodder
that aside, anyone  has the gaijin chart for this episode? Only see the crap version with the blue screen joke in Carol's return episode in the current geah thread on /a/
or all 3 of them are dead and Shem-ha will turn their remains into minions or something, she's god so who knows
probably Vanessa is alive because head is intact, dogo and vamp are dead as shit
Dear Noble Red,
Redeem this.
Regards,
Shem-ha
Sure, local monster Fudou can't let her have her moment after that but still, good job
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
in other news, Maria slapping the seal away
~~that was terrible, I apologize~~
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
well they should've split when they had the chance
~~or maybe not, who knows~~
casually killed by Shem-ha
F for NR
F for Yatsuhiro <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
so he *did* pull that lmao
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
well we now know Fudou *did* get the sword he comissioned... kinda
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
but then again they're not the best at gambles
A fucking god was just shackled by puny mortals, it was obvious it was going to be beyond pissed
what were they expecting to happen when they released Shem-ha?
lol
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
though Yatsuhiro did a lot too
needs to make up for the shitty dads
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
also how are they even going to keep him jailed if he's such a monster?
so much for being the final boss tho
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
guess he's immune to anatomy
It's been clear for a while this fucker's not exactly a normal human
though beaming them might be a bit less personal than goring vamp and dogo
Vanessa's head will be taken and used as an enemy consultant or something
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"wait for BDs, please understand"
yeah
lol
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
just like I thought would happen back when not even ep 1 was released
I love how they were unceremoniously one-shoted by god
*literally*
I'm not going to play a mobage period, was just asking for the adaptation thing
don't give a shit about sidestories but liked Madoka, should I bother with the Magireco adaptation when it releases?
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
also nameless
nameless
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
inb4 extended version plays out like a recap in the next episode
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Clearly Shem-ha read the initial reactions to Noble Red and decided to entertain the audience
good, phone is just being dumb
On a completely off-topic matter, is my user image not showing or it's just my phone being janky with loading?
~~I'm mostly memeing, they'll probably get it while holding off whatever army of cannon fodder Shem-ha throws~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Because Kaneko got tired of being accused of repeating patterns
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289> <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
~~never because Kirika's song is faster~~
now about that Bikki side B... any bets on when it'll be used?
I want them to be absolute madmen and do it, but they won't
Tsubasa's arcs should've told you by now this show actively seeks to beat some dead horses
At this point we're only missing meme man as far as potential stuff that could crash the season is concerned
He's still a piece of shit, don't get me wrong
This is the fanbase cheering for the return of GENOCIDE, "not okay for the shit he's done" requires *quite a bit more* than what Akira did
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So far not even top dad has been able to crash us with mishandled stuff
makes sense he'd care about it
well considering it was basically a divine national treasure
and how he can use them to further that idea
just like Japan, he cares about the *idea* he has about the Kazanari clan
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
himself? Oh wait he just got screwed
yes, and?
yeah that probably
Elsa comes up with the idea of crashing down the entire hall to get away
so basically what we already knew anyways
cant into moonrunes, what is that?
their judgement is better than FIS at least, problem is plot is kinda stingy with plan success instead of handing it out for free this time
"we finished searching the Kazanari manor... we found this talking head crying about her family"
so yeah
I mean probably getting sliced in half is not lethal to her per-se
instead of something something estrogen something and basically I am just filler
yeah but you at least here have one being the one that does the most dirty jobs and the other one coming uo with plans
(AXZ)
it's not ep 12, therefore I can tolerate its existence
because I'm sure Gen wouldn't have stopped Tsubasa if Fudou were to be killed in a clash of attacks like Cagliostro/Prelati's "deaths" instead of an outright finishing blow after he already lost
disarmed and all I guess
they needed a reason to kinda justify him not getting killed
You can salvage it by arguing that with Kusanagi broken the guy was already beaten unlike Prelati and finishing him off at that point was unecessary, but that's a stretch given his punches and all
but even though I loathe Heavenrend, this was just funny
just saw this posted on a thread, waiting for YT for the rewatch myself
my sides location: high orbit
she'll get plenty of time to flesh that out now that Fudou's plan went south
I mean Shem-ha could still flex with some giant construct so that the rest of the team gets to do something while Bikki deals with her proper, it'd also be better than just mowing noise cannon fodder for the 5th time
yeah was about to say something like that, in fact I think 2 out of 3 magical girl anime I watched dubbed in latin american spanish when I was a kid featured that at some point, it's been used a lot for a long time
actually translate Ichaival to Yewfelle to keep true to the alleged origin of the misconception <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Gungnir to "Swaying One", can't forget that one
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
What about the new challenger, Heavencloud?
*Heavenrend <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
or am I misremembering stuff?
And the actual Philosopher Stone merge with Gear was done with the rushjob that was Last Ignition
Didn't that info just help with speeding up the process of cleansing?
~~I literally remember it being a bunch of magictechnobabble beyond my comprehension~~
something something macrocosm microcosm something
~~Gen fight notwhistanding~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Tsubasa fan guy really hated last episode
*ChaosFlameWrathSlash.gif*
I already read the whole thing
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
what the hell is this shit even
to be fair in this fanbase in particular you don't even need to be cute for people to like you despite being completely irredeemable as far as your actions are concerned
don't excuse the cute dogo for being a cute dogo
yeah I feel the same way
yeah no, all 3 of them deserved being lightsaber'd
"well she felt bad for bullying Elf9"
Yeah and one episode later is fine with unceremoniously offing her after she's of no use anyways
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I love how the article says Elsa has a "kinder head in her shoulders" when her position as strategist probably means the plan of using the noise to crash the hall with no survivors before leaving was her idea
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
"At the very least though, my heart will be pained if anything but a happy ending awaits Elza."
Yeah about that...
just checking zoid's twitter right now I'm tempted to just watch the commie release in the meantime because the CR script for this episode seems to be especially shitty <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
well between messing up an already very poorly executed arc and CyVer... I'll take him living rent-free in Maria's head (you know they wanted *some* way to bring meme man back in AXZ anyways)
yeah right
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
he redeemed himself... by ruining the world destroying plan that he himself set into motion like an hour earlier
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
you will see Vanessa's head as a talking bridge decor and like it dammit
well now it's too late and Elsa will probably remain a filter on whether someone read keywords/bios or not
yep
unless they actually lived which in vamp and doggo's case would be kinda odd
so don't expect them to come back as characters
that's the only reason I can see
mindless puppets as cannon fodder
is more machine than person so cut in half proably is just a flesh wound
Vanessa
we can also assume she can do the negate all damage with an expy from another reality thing
~~more like for most seasons it was otl or nothing iirc~~
"A small price to pay for the conservation of the Heavenrend meme" -Commie, probably
it'd be just "ouch that hurt kinda, let me undo the damage.... there, let's continue"
it wouldn't even work
it's Hibiki's version of Gungnir
and God killer is not Gungnir by itself according to keywords
yeah but why would shem-ha even need that
lol
the only one that bothered me was literal blood fountain because of how pointless it was
sudden moon activation aside it's the least cliffhanger we've had in a while
~~or I guess Nehushtan Fine is a more appropiate reference in this case~~
Millaarc needs Piccolo-tier regeneration to survive being Shem-ha'd the way she was
CR translated this as "the foulness of humanity pleases me" lmao
well the brain is still Miku's, isn't it? DFS exerts control over that
and also if the system works on its own after installed or Shem-ha would just chill there until Fudou tells her what to do
like if it needs commands to be inputed in a console or just barking orders works once it's completed
now that I think about it, it probably depends on how the control mechanism works
yup
she wakes up after this
and Shem-ha woke up
they were in the process of rebooting the direct feedback thing
actually watching the commie TL of the scene, that's the impression I'm getting
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Maybe the system needed a full reboot to switch admin rights and Shem-ha just jumped in that short moment or something
omniscience will be dodge spam festa, everyone but Hibiki and Kirika will miss <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
dammit solo I already cried with that yesterday
it would've been had they not decided to cut with the start of the apocalypse
though really since they broke *some* patterns maybe they throw a curveball at some point
*cries in S1 and G*
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I knew it was something like this but still
people like that do exist, thankfully their numbers are small as far as I'm aware
and they do jack, if the site itself doesn't give a shit, then why should anyone else
seriously how long has this been going on? like a month?
I can see it being higher than the other seasons when this ends unless the ending is terrible, but this is just more proof that MAL ratings are a shitshow
probably
to be fair they've pretty much uploaded half the episode with all the small clips
no matter how many times I watch this I still don't get wtf is up with Fudou's arm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kaW5xJ8WlI
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
clearly Shem-ha was feeling creative and the nearby pile of limbs was available
>Slap only succeeded because the source of the seal was half dead
>Get sucker punched by Fudou
>Finally trounced by giant NR abomination
Dammit Maria
yep, they get to clean up that monstrosity I guess
oh shit
what does it say?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
random thought: what if Shem-ha simply didn't equip the Faust Robe?
his smirk pretty much implied that anyways
he assumed they died
Yeah but didn't Shem-ha absorb Miku *before* equipping Faust Robe?
like what if she didn't?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I ask again, were they seriously counting on Shem-ha equiping it for the whole plan to work?
to show her making the NR mashup
prolly flashback
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so that's where the giant NR thing comes in
inb4 it's just like that one from Basa when she mentioned Kanade and Genjuro just looked with concern
preparring for moon mission maybe?
yup
ikr
look on the bright side: Yatsuhiro might be ali- ~~he's dead because previews are liars~~
Shem-ha:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkpS2Sdu2io
wouldn't it?
well the coffin would've just chilled there
I can just imagine the spirit of whomever designed the system to keep Shem-ha buried going "No you fucking dipshits what the hell are you doing, even Satan was scared of this shit ffs"
So I guess that's as good of a job as any as far as trying to keep it sealed is concerned
I mean, they literally needed a team of 6 gears to get rid of the final layer of protection
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
She even made the monsters bigger
~~or Shem-ha reshapes it to something that enhances her instead since god and all~~
if it's just a restraining mechanism maybe it won't be equipped anymore
probably?
that things will be a-ok by the end of the episode instead of going to shit
expecting them not to be by now is akin to not expecting an insert song in an episode
previews are *always* bait
[ascended gag strength intensifies]
~~oh so he just channeled his chuuni side when naming a random sword?~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
he can mess with attack cards too
and then he'll realize the DFS is not active and switch to "I've made a terrible mistake"
He's going to gloat that it's too late, that the god is under his control and grorious nippon will reign supreme
~~thats the joke~~ <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
what if DMJii amalgam uses a Zababa mecha so we get a kaijuu vs mech fight?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Clearly Shem-ha's going to play Super Polymerization on then
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Does that make me a masochist if I have it as my most listened to song for this season?
at best a mini training montage while they get stuff ready to go to the moon
They didn't take the chance for a breather when NR wasn't cut to pieces, they aren't going to do so now
welp time to mute this and do something else to kill time until CR subs are out
on the topic of dads, I know Tsubasa's been suffering a lot this season even before last episode, but I'll be very upset if Yatsuhiro ends up surviving instead of Basa and Ogawa just carrying his body away in the preview image
even served as more foreshadowing for the Curse of Balal not being entirely a bad thing
top dad was surprisingly well used
now we might get to see DMJii's amalgam facing off against whatever Shem-ha does with the pile of limbs she created <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
since everything gets turned into bubble or weapon depending on the mode
Amalgam outfit is more plain giant Armed Gear aside anyways
all of their outfits changed
well everyone was shown using the barrier mode back in episode 4, it's just that they were buried in red tape immediately afterwards
~~though seriously wtf is up with the purple aura~~
tall words for a guy that had to pull the "kill me and I win" card at the end
Gen still has only lost due to hesitation
considering he got up just fine after what Fudou did to him
My biggest question is what are Gen's head and neck made of
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
per his own words, an Oni
curious about what meme man is upset about
remember that we also need to get Zababa Amalgam duet to kill the NR Chimera
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and then Shem-ha dispels the revive spell because fuck you I'm your boss
seriously those faces
Vanessa's just lost it
>lose rocket to the moon
>nevermind I'm stealing this tp ride real quick
>arrive to the moon
welp
OMG
Again completely irrelevant
but again, why bother doing so
I mean he probably could escape the prison
if it's game over in your eyes
Why even bother resisting
I mean as far as he's concerned they're boned
well it's CR
rofl
and Chris is wielding a bow that never belonged to Ullr
they just mixed norse with christianity in AXZ
yeah I know
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
something something name sounds cool something
for "Yggdrassil just makes everyone my drone lmao"
and whatever she said could be just an euphemism
em, setting everything back 5k years could mean a number of things
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
well she spoke of "current level of integration" so she may just keep fusing further
rocket lost, they got where they wanted anyway by hijacking NR's ride
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
oh yeah, Shirabe henshin still says "kill"
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
so basically: "I dunno what this shit exactly does but if you want it shut down then clearly I want them to stay on"
like the ruins are jamming whatever Yggdrassil is supposed to be doing
like if anything this is a "defend this location" mission or something
Isn't it in their best interests not to turn the ruins off?
yep
she has a female side and a male side
isn't that a literal yandere card spirit?
Yugioh Yubel?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
everything's fair game
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
clearly the ruins have an atmosphere thing going on
*don't jinx it*
~~low-key encouraging plagiarism~~
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
so basically same deal as Carol
she's using it for something else now though
it's also a verbal tic of sorts I think
so fucking distracting
*[screams in watching "-dearimasu" subs]*
well whatever
why tf did I write the wrong one
lol
why would she try to basically destroy the planet if what she apparently wants is an army of ~~drones~~ tools
"just push most of the impact to the B-side song, need more time for plot and fights" -Kaneko 2019
everyone in the main cast is immortal
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Actually if anything she did something even better, problem is securing a way back after everything's done
so fair enough
well it still did attract the dumbasses whose's ride they stole to get there even faster
~~I'm just taking a shot every time Kaneko reuses something, even if it's just mythology references~~
Some sort of scythe/blade with a really fragile looking structure <:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
oh yeah btw, the Yggdrasil is another wild arms reference
considering that wasn't able to break through the fetus defenses
well that power level comment pretty much implies that
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
why not
~~just looked it up, it sounds eerily similar~~
but fair enough
~~doesn't help that it was also a tower that was supposed to reshape the world or something in WA3~~
I think they're pretty much settled on that idea, yes
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
>livestream apple from the ruins since they're similar to frontier anyways
>gather planet-wide phonic gain again
>X-Drive
yeah it'll probably play out like that but with stacking Amalgam on top
(counting on them snatching NR's ride)
that plan requires pretty much omniscience to pull off
<:Ver:336656981144109066> <--- this dude
Yatsuhiro needed to stay dead, or else the b-side is meaningless
Hello Elsa-chan, Millaarc-chan? I think I've lost it
it's *Maria's mental image of Ver*
<@!99695384296701952> 08:56 or so
give me a sec
so apparently the percent part is a CR invention and she just said 1/10000, can anyone confirm?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
but you know, clearly da ze is the main priority
and kind of has the seal that was the main objective
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
so yeah cute doggo planned the part that killed the most people
Elsa is the idea girl
fair enough
do you *really* need to crash the whole stadium with no survivors instead of just flying away at that point though?
also doesn't help that SG's goal is "selfless" at its core while NR is you know...
except when the inspection happened
all the time
she was guarded
didn't they also blew up the place anyways?
unless turned into gear/faust robe
well the fragments themselves would lack any power
now we only need confirmation on Enki being the one Fine loved and we conclude that Fine unknowingly made a gear out of the arm of the guy she loved
oh by the way, Enki's arm totally was silver because Shem-ha turned it into that when she severed it on their fight
"What is soul damage?" -Shem-ha, probably
lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so power scaling is a 100 times less whacked than I initially thought, not like it matters at that point
it's not like it'd have contributed much more since the foreshadowing already had the subtlety of a sledgehammer
we knew that already since AXZ
they know that no one can make gears anymore
it's by gear
also that
but it's murica in geah
yeah
They blew up the place, I don't expect them to know everything that was outright robbed instead of just destroyed
ikr


everyone
oh great, the version without the shitty blue screen joke in Carol's return episode
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
people just stuck to the old names anyways
this reminds me of that one time a bunch of japan-only material got a bunch of localized names that people didn't like in Fire Emblem
~~by the way I don't like it myself~~
~~not liking it doesn't make it any less canon~~
~~they use Superb Song in engrish in-universe anyways~~
and she just morphs Miku's body to resemble her real body
inb4 just like Fudou being the endgame, actual separate Shem-ha body doesn't happen
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
yep
is she copypasting her body or just her power though?
~~I've been saying that since the whole god-killer thing being a conceptual weapon was stated~~
for it not to work Shem-ha would have to literally think of herself as not god anymore
that needs to be an emote
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
want to be free and human? kneel as monsters to me or die
"should've killed and used the weird old man that kept going on about being a Sakimori"
Imagine what Shem-ha will think if she teleports to the moon to continue her plan and she finds NR fighting the geahs: "maybe entrusting people a tiny fraction of my power can turn into a pile of limbs with an important mission wasn't a very good idea"
There were people actually believing that 2 weeks ago
she also made it clear that it hurts, there's probably a bunch of jokes on that alone
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
gather seven billion zesshou from people, then have Carol send her phonic gain as well for double the fun!
and profit
then stack Amalgam on top
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
just livestream Apple to the Earth and gather phonic gain
they also know that apple pulls phonic gain bs
they are on the moon, which resembles frontier
~~just don't do the roomba again~~
I wanted a combined Zababa mech, but this was honestly the next best thing
~~not exactly~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~I understood that reference~~

"this statement is false"
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
then yeah, if she wants it gone maybe it's so she can make everyone Shem-ha
I mean if the Curse of Balal is what prevents people from being vessels for divine power
~~I saw that~~
serving the power they wanted to control until they get killed
because they're trapped in the exact opposite position they wanted
since she completely lost it
no, going awooo and crying a river doesn't bring the 70k dead people back
cute doggo doesn't get a pass because strategist and Vanessa is the leader so cry me a river
as far as deserving it, all 3 of them should die by the end
~~That or just dispel the revive but that doesn't give "please kill me" pity points~~
So what are the chances that Shem-ha can actually directly control NR if they try to defy her given that they tried to control her first and she revived them in the first place?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
no need to blow up the moon, just beam everyone you see
actually working exactly like Miku's SSJ works in her favor since it erases the curse she hates so much
so she probably can now that some time has passed
she gets stronger by the minute since she's using the DFS to recover more pieces of herself
made worse by said god also having a relic killer equipment
And considering they're going up against literal god that's a huge problem
It's not just Hibiki, everyone will hesitate and be unable to go all out so long as she keeps using her body

(Hibiki's side-B I mean)
it's been out since like the start of the season lol
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
plot twist: it never plays
you know they have to keep """"""plausible deniability"""""" for waifuers
you can't prevent it, it allows phonic gain miracles and stuff
🍎
that's the angle they've been implying, yes
Carol's tingle below the belly
"name one season without a villain with some weird sexual thing" -The audience, probably
holy binge
zababa dorks were pretty good at the start of the season
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
pretty sure all that is on Kirika
I think that's only true in the case of the AXZ unisons
or at least that's what I've been told
it's also most likely an overly literal translation of every kanji used instead of the actual name
(the video)
Twin Heart I believe
~~I keep thinking about that one wolf boss from MMZ4 when I see that Elsa form, even though there's probably a million things that did that stuff before~~
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
they were clearly waiting for their return in XV
so you never know
XDU is a thing
~~watch her turn into something hideous as her final form so the geahs get to beat a monster for the finale~~
I think it's pretty clear she just means to remove Curse of Balal and have her revered as the god of the planet
I meant that pulling power level wanking statements of her only using a small fraction of her power doesn't mean she's literally omnipotent
(compared to geah I mean)
and that phrase would still apply
Pretty sure even the most OP combat character in DBZ is still not omnipotent
she did the same shit in G, I seriously don't understand why people think it was an asspull in GX
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
well she was foolish enough to throw song power at people who can absorb, redistrubute and channel it
seriously we're 60+ episodes in
Welcome to Symphogear
that was a few days before, she's had time to further integrate herself since then
I insist that all 3 of them deserve the same fate
She might as well be able to modify the faust robe and she has the maker of the robe working for her anyways
A fraction of her power is able to turn a team of jobbers into more powerful jobbers
~~including and most especially me~~
Fuck all this power level wanking, ~~Shem-ha please blow up everyone~~
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I swear I regret bringing DBZ to try to prove a point so much
Am I missing something? Is there anything in his treasury that should allow him to literally alter reality to whatever he pleases? Because that's what omnipotence would ultimately entail, among other things.

so get a hat and use that as a weapon?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So because she feels like it
I'd say to keep pretenses but she's clearly lost it anyways
She was mid-fight when Elsa got trounced though, why would she even put them back at that point
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
I liked how Vanessa's clothes grew back by the end of the fight
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
first they have to solve the puzzles of the final dungeon of this JRPG
Hey, at least they followed her into her stunt instead of letting her ~~suicide~~ go alone
a world of nothing but Shem-ha
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
then copy paste herself into every single human on Earth
remove Balal curse and turn them all into potential vessels
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
that actually kinda ties into the whole "Adam's perfect and thus completely static and incapable of further progress" thing
the one whose's arm Fine made a gear out of
that'd be Enki
like I hear the MC was much less of a generic goody two-shoes and stuff
prolly has to do with apparently the first 2 seasons making a bunch of changes that make the 3rd make less sense
serpent was right and you know it
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Yes I'm just saying that given Kaneko's record I doubt the angle is just people misunderstanding a good intention Shakugan no Shana style (can't believe I'm making that reference)
Why else would the entire old civilization go "this bitch's insane, kill her, then toss her corpse into a sentient coffin of death, lose the key and drop a shitload of ice on top".
And ruins are jamming it
I'm going to bet that thing's aim is to make everyone either be Shem-ha's drone or something equally creepy.
maybe minus the gravity anomaly causing havoc
neither did Fine
sure, you can make it sound sweet all you want just like Fine did, but it'll ultimately be the same shit
you do realize that in practical terms it's just her ruling everyone, right?
lol
yes, that's what makes it all the more funny
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Well we already got a similar version of them trying to break through the antispiral in the fight against the fetus
YTT's tl of the attack card
considering the absurd amounts they can harness without any issue (overloading them with a shitload of phonic gain just triggers X-Drive anyways)
I think as long as the energy is compatible (so either alchemy or phonic gain) I think you can't actually overload the gears
I'll add it to the list of things that'd make me commission a gold statue of the person responsible if they actually happen
so given the nature of offensive Amalgam that's just an excuse for another combined Armed Gear, isn't it?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so sure why not
I mean, members of the Illuminati in the geahverse have never been good on their choice of allies
"You know in hindsight using rare blood as fuel for a Faust Robe was not one of my brightest ideas" -Vanessa, probably
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

I love how they covered their tracks with the AU deal

>people in the comments calling Yggdrasil an Overlord reference
and even then that's the last person that would've even wanted to deal said damage
not like anyone but Bikki would've been able to do any actual damage anyways
She only "lost" because she got ambushed by 3 enemies that were juiced up.
I remember reading as such in some keyword, implying that only Hibiki's Gungnir prevents reset bullshit
Isn't the whole deicide thing a combination of the philosophical thing + Bikki's reach and connect thing?
and it doesn't work
she tries to reset damage
When she punches one of her arms off I think
Tiki giant
The divine weapon was also hit by Bikki
Yeah but then you have the keyword for the godslayer thing stating that it also relies on Hibiki's reach and connect deal that basically transfers the super effective damage to every single version
Which means that if say Maria hit Shem-Ha with her version it'd hurt but she can just reset lol
||MY ~~DRILL~~ SONG IS MY SOUL||
so naked fist fight against true form Shem-ha is the final round?
the scissors don't help at all
seriously everything should be killed by the saws anyways
I love how "I'm Kirika I'm helping" the Zababa roomba is
how would that work since they were created after the Custodians left the picture?
so Kaneko memeing probably
no prior reference as far as I know
segway noise were funny
~~until Bikki shows up, then they're just regular noise~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Speaking of Noise, for some reason when I watched ep 10 the first time my brain registered the teleport crystals as noise ones and thought they were going to deploy divine noise

comes with the job of being the throwaway insane evil scientist
something something curses may be blessings something
that's more than I expected tbh
you don't have to like him, but he didn't take anything away from the episode and provided some foreshadowing
I mean in XV everyone agrees he didn't cause damage at all
depends on how he's shoehorned back
calm down, top dad was fine
~~oh fuck, funny how I hate his guts but I spam that emote all the time~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~Bikki nendo should've come with Grape-kun instead of just the basic biped one~~

expected meme song, got sad one instead
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~I've actually been secretly expecting fist fight with god since the literal drill in AXZ~~
lol I was doing the same about a month ago
yeah, but how did they even set the whole thing up without her realizing it
but I guess that justifies the overkill layers of protection they shoved into her (kill her, toss the corpse into an automated and overpowered coffin that kills anyone who dares approach, then dump a shitload of ice on top for good measure) and Adam being so terrified
Shem-ha's actual power sounds so ridiculously overpowered I wonder how did they even manage to get rid of her originally
for real though
Something something story with the light god could not know something
>the Shem-ha keyword
So pretty much already telling us she's just going to reshape Miku's body to match her old self
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
by the way, given her alteration powers she could literally turn NR into humans but chose not to and she straight up lied to them as far as I'm concerned
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
mindless shem-ha drones could be basically zombies minus the undead part
depends on your definition of monster I guess
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
though wouldn't that be more like changing the file extension from xxxx.hum to xxxx.mon?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
remember what Vanessa said
*monster.exe
going to guess that Yggdrasil lets her whole words thing reach the entire planet at once so as soon as Curse of Balal is removed everyone gets turned into whatever she's planning
since you know...
it's not exactly hidden
The funny part was Carol basically going "guess these shitters still suck as much as they did back then... welp time to hand them the phonic gain *again*"
I don't give a damn of it having weight in the moment if Kirika's going to show up just fine in the bridge 5 minutes later anyways
so they don't even bother
I guess the show itself finally got the memo that we know zesshou is a paper cut at best nowadays
that they'd bully hibiki with miku I mean
yeah but that was already pretty much foreshadowed like 2 years ago
at least given the season so far
that's like not expecting something ridiculous to happen
>not expexting Tsubasa bullying in every episode
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
no, stay dead wubwub protocol
they even have apple to meme 7 billion zesshou again
~~you know it's going to be Amalgam X-Drive~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
probably the later
Now that you mention it, I wonder if he helped in getting rid of Shem-ha or just watched and did a toast when the whole Custodian thing collapsed.
it just means they're going to troll god as far as I'm concerned
and guess what she tries to do after that
and Fine couldn't just appear and kill them until she fully fuses with Nehushtan and drops the pretenses
Chris can't finish them off IIRC because she got trounced and had to flee every time
so it's not really an accomplishment
so really GX "fixed" a problem it created by itself
in S1 they can't, G is stupidity central but villains are outclassed all the time
because that would've been really stupid
~~at least we got confirmation that Basa activated it to not get killed and not because they gave her the ok at that point~~
of course then you have ReStRiCtIoNs but that's another thing
yeah, once and then Amalgam showed up at episode 4
"first half", they literally complained once in a single episode IIRC
yeah, that's the problem people have with the writing
so every time they could win they just leave and when they finally lose it's all according to keikaku
because the incredibly powerful dolls are made to job
Saint Germain: "We could kill them, but what the hamster said pissed me off so let's just leave"
~~for the most part at least~~
on either side
yeah but the gap isn't filled by every single braincell vacating the premises
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
https://pastebin.com/5Cyftq0j
this one's the one I'm talking about, it was still heavily implied in dialogue and with her whole turning stuff into silver deal
She will most likely just reshape Miku's body to resemble her old self instead of making a new body
Given the Shem-ha keyword I wouldn't have much hope of getting Miku back until Shem-ha is beaten for good tbh
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
minus Shem-ha being Fine before Fine
welp everything I was suspecting just got basically confirmed
OH FUCK
turns out the universal language were the biggest chains of them all
makes you wonder what would've happened if she succeeded
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
It's basically a misunderstanding turned into cruel irony given the Airgetlam gear
lmao
why would you wait if you turned off the defenses, have nothing better to do in the meantime and have them on moon call?
I think it's a pretty critical piece of info
why wouldn't they
~~why can't she hijack Hibiki then?~~

Custodians: "Hey guys thought we'd come back and check on y-"
>they see the shitshow Shem-ha just started
Custodians: "Nevermind, ~~ man, this shit went worse than our venture in the Koprulu sector with the psychic ones and those bugs we made~~ turn around helmsman, we're getting out of here!"
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
from too many buttplugs
since the connections fried
as in no matter how many she shoves in there, they won't operate
she literally can't
well I guess Kaneko is a JRPG writer and final boss that comes out of nowhere is a thing on some...
because some people think crashing the season is worth sugita cackling and memes
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
does any of this look like slowing down?
clearly they have their budgeting priorities straight
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
no, she wanted understanding and Shem-ha wanted to play being grail-kun
so apparently the TL of this was especially shit, been told it's supposed to say "I swear on the hundred thousand lives", referring to you know what, can anyone confirm?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
profit
delete god
livestream apple from the ruins, collect shitloads of phonic gain at a planetary level, send to chateau, set it to dissect language
Carol was betting on it and it's not like this show is unknown to having a miracle save things
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
therefore erasing Shem-ha forever
clearly she has to use the Chateau to dissect the concept of the universal language
I was expecting it to be the way towards the moon but given the current situation maybe it's the other way around
~~Noble Red sacrifice making a stairway back with Daedalus End, since length of the thing is moon to earth distance and all~~

so don't worry about them ptsd from now on
well it's the last time you'll hear it anyways
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
~~when they settle for being comedic relief instead of international laughing stock, seriously they can't do anything right, even going literally nuclear again failed~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
she can go nuts and ignore that big but
god*
and not fod
but since now she's language
but that would technically also mean she loses her divinity
before I've joked around how god could just not see itself as a god and avoid the lethal blow that way
philosophical weapons work because the target sees themselves as whatever it's supposed to counter, basically the reason why Swordbreaker stopped working and why Vanessa's arm exploded
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what if god slayer doesn't work because she identifies as language instead of god?
oh hai

well she is kinda dumb and she also rolls with being dumb to lighten the mood

~~she would turn all of them into kebab anyway~~
she's just jelly cuz DMJii dabbed on her at the start of the season
so dw
all 3 of them will die getting the geahs back to earth next episode
remember when I pretended to be cool instead of being designated jobber? good times

so long as she doesn't break outer walls it's cool I guess
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
Get a clue about Miku's feelings I guess
What were the Custodians planning to do with the human supercomputer before Shem-ha hijacked the project? ~~mine bitcoins?~~
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Shem-ha: "clearly the reason you're unable to say your feelings is because of that damned moon, help me take it down, nothing bad will happen!"
CuRsE oF bAlAl
Man it's so annoying that Fine's soul got deleted before she could learn any of this, her entire life's goal was to destroy what ended up being Enki's parting gift and given the similarities she probably learned the method to keep herself alive forever from the actual culprit of the whole mess.

why should I assume otherwise?
yes?
clearly the logical approach from them is just exterminating mankind
Probably because Enki cared about Fine or something

well what's better than attacking the virus conceptually on a world-scale?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
bam, she's deleted
or you can use the Chateau to dissect the concept of the universal language
they can't be all that bad if they decided to just flee the earth instead of glassing the planet which would've assured with 100% certainty that Shem-ha wouldn't bother them anymore
you mean like Shem-ha pulling that off?
so checks out
and the only one of the 3 that works on Faust Robe tech is Vanessa
which fits NR
it said something more along the lines of "that person is on its way to meet his maker", aka. half-dead
that was CR's TL being shit
keywords and implied by Fudou when he was talking to Tsubasa
~~beamspam is still better than Red Nephilim just T-posing btw~~

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
the one where everyone else is her puppet
the "back to 5k years ago" wasn't literal
why would she use time reversal?
of course for the sake of the argument they can just do apple miracles if they really wanted to
~~that's just me mostly joking, it's too easy and straightforward of a solution anyways~~
and we're missing the part where they'll obviously tell us either with the Shem-ha keyword or in the show itself that the method Fine used was learned from something that Shem-ha left
she only went batshit and did all the other shit after the balal debacle
yeah that's irrelevant, at the point Enki and the rest made the decision she was a human (a very important one sure, but still a human)
and wubwub protocol is not cannibalizing shill slots with the same song but worse
~~you can always sacrifice some of the EDs~~

OH FUCK THAT SHIT
it's not the same as the singles
at least not before they were actually shown in the show
unison songs were all BD bonus so they weren't announced either IIRC
so any guess for Chris' Amalgam?
it's not even close to "Carol's return"
tbh it's not really that bad? both thumbnail and name doesn't say anything
if that's what you're asking
they posted the Basa/Maria Amalgam
Shemmy can however feel free to surprise me
yeah a mirror mostly known when weaponized for its relic destroying beam

but yeah it's kind of a bummer that this final boss has the best excuse to just beamspam
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so gg
but Shem-ha can reconfigure it
its primary use was restraining
it's been said on keywords
actually it's not a combat unit
no one is going to go all out on the body she's using

yeah and then it just showed up on its own
that just told them where it would appear
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and everyone gets turned into shem-ha, even Fine herself
yeah then it eventually surfaces
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and the race most likely to honor their word is also the one that glasses planets
you can't trust anyone farther than you can throw them for starters

~~my headcanon is that the Custodians went to try again in the Koprulu sector... results were unfavorable to say the least~~
yeah it was just a funny thought given the imagery, and the fact that in both cases a precursor civilization/race that promoted evolution with a power hungry insurgent among them was involved
the difference being that Shem-ha is a hell of a lot more visually pleasing than that abomination
yup
ngl the whole imagery of humanity literally unified by the universal language and Shem-ha hijacking the thing for her ends gave me massive Protoss Khala vibes
🤔
given recent developments, does blamimg the curse of balal for everything make me a Shem-ha apologist?

We already had Carol using "understanding everything" as a fancy way of saying "destroy the world"
also zenkai boost upon zenkai boost because screw you if you aren't a saiyan you're screwed
well when ever the "fodder" combatants can blow up the planet you're fighting on that tends to happen
"oh that's cute, let me chuck this bundle of galaxies to your face"
aka. escalation: the anime
*laughs in Gurren Lagann*
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
*I'm trying ok?*
but anyways, wasn't SG's deal kind of liberating people from oppression? Sure she just ended up playing second fiddle to Adam and was doing mostly the same as other villains but it was still her goal
like if he had his DNA splicers crap at the ready I would buy it, but he only roped Colress in after the other plan failed
"Oh I'm the only one with mons! I rulez!" "um, you do realize OP white/black legend dragon right here is my BFF, right?" "Oh..."
real talk about that for a second, what would've Ghetsis even accomplish there? N could've just roflstomped his ass with his box legendary (the only reason he didn't do so is because you just beat him with yours)
we already have NR for our "redeemable" quota, wipe the evil language lady from the face of the earth
for any kind of "redemption" they'd need some sob story and we definitely have no time for that
just kill the bitch, fuck the nanoha pattern she just unironically wants everyone as tools for her war against the rest of her kind
>explosive AoE geah
>uses the attack to save everyone from getting spaced
so she learned after GX, neat
whomever was in the rocket bat at the time she blew it up
something something strategist something
no she wasn't, cute doggo is as rotten as vamp
(well, reverse of what I expected since it was to create the way back but whatever)
all 3 of them died the way I was expecting them to since they showed Daedalus End
>S1
you're asking just now this?
was a fine idea, too bad SSJ is BS
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so they're getting swarmed by Shem-has?
btw the jammer's toast
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so just regular Kaneko then?
why am I not surprised
lmao
or maybe earlier
from AXZ I think?
it was a keyword thing
then saw the title
I was like "wth did this got mixed up with something else?"
Ogawa clan leader being Dante
Destroy SSJ, then do whatever the heck Carolnein tried
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~inb4 they all died upon entry and these are valkyrie spirits~~
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
>Shem-ha tries to damage them
>attacks just phase through because you know...
~~just joking btw~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and these are spirits
all 6 of them died on entry
dude they're already dead
huzzah
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
tfw this is one of the times Kaneko felt like breaking patterns
don't be silly, no b-side gets to show up in the show unless you're bikki in post-GX geah
and it will be the Chris amalgam
in 2 hours or so
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and ruin her plan that way?
can't they just unplug the servers?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
inb4 it never plays
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's not a "theory", just a joke because of the hair I concocted in 5 seconds
we have a god pretending to be grail-kun when talking to Miku though
if any flesh wound is, welp, just a flesh wound to the immortal bitch
why would you try flashy
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
that keeps the language bitch away from mankind
spread all that trolling and discord online
of course the one time murica decides not to be a joke is to unleash the power of global shitposting
lol
I guess
you'd have to purge the universal language conceptually
lmao
she'll just hop into the next fool
even if you wanted to kill Miku
sure, they won't lose because why the hell would you do that, but my question is how
for real, how do you get rid of the queen language bitch of the planet now?
pick your poison
befriend the evil god or purge universal language forever
why in the fuck would he do that lol
is a better way to spend your energy
just bind + try conceptual dissection
ask SG & friends
using too much energy for your alchemy dusts you
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~we still have an episode left for that you know~~
not without the finale turning into rush central any more than it's already doomed to be
but as things are now
like if we had a double length episode or something confirmed (we don't) I would consider it a possibility
honestly to befriend Shem-ha they'd need a basis for a sob story behind her motivation to rule everything that's not "I just want to crush the rest of my kind with an iron fist" and we have 24 minutes left to wrap up the entire series, not sure how they'd do it
~~reminder that they died and then came back~~
but enough about that
that's a game where being a bow user is not a liability though
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
meh it was a solid weapon considering bows are shit in most FE
c'mon, she's a geah villain
>not actually shitting on the artist for not being kinky enough
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
that's amazing
rofl
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh look, more screaming
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
speaking of Millaarc, love how Maria and Basa had nothing to say to NR
would've been better had the alchemists not crashed the whole place down ~~with no survivors~~ before leaving which was definitely Elsa's idea given her role and how the seal was already placed
that's not much time to do much of anything as far as escaping is concerned
problem is the place got rushed and *crashed* in like 5 minutes or so
70k and increasing was the number given on the news the day after
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
that's it
so the 2 people that Ogawa picked up
Basa swore on 100k lives last episode
~~that's because doggo doesn't have it in her to actually put her mass murder schemes into motion~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
ib4 the end is just a random character instrospection because budget ran out and we need to wait till the movie for a proper end
I meant the X-Drive they needed to actually get rid of the T-posing red thing
or the moon coming down
or getting incinerated by Nephilim/Shem-ha coming back earlier anyways
well it was apple
just a quick reminder
G ending also had the final form of the monster just T-posing
that FE devs came up with to give to the weapon of a crusader that had a name that kinda sounded like Ullr
Ichaival is just a made up name
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
this is Ichaival
https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Yewfelle
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
yeah
but since the narrative requiring her to lose and SSJ being a thing
well she had an idea that could've worked
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
she didn't know they could fast recall through NR suicide
and then what
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
silly Cypher, clearly it should've been a JRPG
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
>Shem-ha wakes up inside Fine
"Oh, nice rig, thanks, Enki priestess-san"
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
too bad that means everyone is dead
I guess letting the genocidal alchemist win is an option
god wakes up
save the earth
god wakes up anyways
let the priestess win
the only winning move at this point is just not to play
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well at least the evil god runs out of vessels by definition in that scenario
>villain literally has a beam signature move
you're doomed
if anything, concert stage design has worsened
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
yes, the date of the concert showed that I believe
~~I thought for a second you were low-key using the age-old "I accidentally the economy" meme~~
he can even beat El Grande Padre Kazanari
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
tfw the real key to beating the evil language god lady is global scale shitposting
if :15min: were here or I had nitro I would use it more than :ver: ngl
meh, he's fine now, he didn't damage the season and contributed foreshadowing
I guess they could use it as part of the epilogue if they show some scenes alongside the credits
but alas, we have only 20 mins
everyone does
<:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
isn't it Carol's head to begin with?
but hey, they're *silver petrifying beams*!
thanks Frontier
I guess having her naked body livestreamed to the entire world has that effect
"how come no one realizes the blue one that uses swords looks just like Tsubasa-sama?"
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
imagine what happens if people actually find out the last concert was crashed by literal illuminati
"did one of the idols just declare war to the world and asked everyone to surrender their territory? wtf is this LARP"
as opposed to glorious dusting
so if I die crushed by people or by the whole place crashing down, does that mean I'm not worthy?
since they've all been death traps in a universe where you can be ambushed by invincible monsters that dust you at any point
clearly the animator was in dire need of some water
the price for keeping Shem-ha at bay
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
thinks revolver stance melts everything
she probably played too much Warframe with Mesa
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they can probably travel ridiculously fast anyways
they're in unlimited X-Drive Amalgam mode
so they all combine and we get a Gurren Lagann final battle?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
better idea, balal curse is gone, so now everyone can switch gears around
smol one pre-concert maybe?
of course activation hurts like hell
keywords say it lessens it
no it didn't
they just forced it through with Ignite since that reduces backfire
they were out of Linker
when they rescued Hibiki's team from Adam's sun
shit linker is still better than no linker
she wasn't on her dose with Gungnir I believe
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
actually scratch that, you could theoretically hand a gear to anyone now
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
since no balal curse and that apparently was what messed up with gear compatibility and stuff
technically the entire cast could switcheroo gears now
in AXZ at the end
she literally used everyone else's attacks no biggie
assuming a hypothetical scenario where Bikki's gimmick could work on a different gear of course
actually you could argue the Gungnir part is not even necessary, it just makes the fight one-sided because one shot
yes, it's Gungnir + Bikki's personal armed gear gimmick that allows her to screw over divine beings
but a god can just lolnullifydamagelmao
Gungnir just gives super effective damage
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
A P P L E
he's just that weird old man we were told to never let out under any circumstance that keeps babbling about sakimori and that songs are useless
a thousand years later... he's still in prison, he doesn't seem to age, and no one even remembers why he's locked up where he is
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
but him hijacking the plot now would legit crash the finale in levels only random sugita cackles could achieve
yeah he's not
another is hijacking the finale out of literal god's hands
because one thing is being a piece of shit or boring
if he does he'll legit be more hated than every single other villain
lmao
at that point why bother with that, just use a regular katana and use your Kazanari meme genetics to make it stronger
if it weren't activated he might as well be swinging a fossil around
which I guess it's also funny
and the alternative is a legendary sword exploding upon a single strike from amalgam
~~no, but it's fun to headcanon it that way because sad pathetic old geezer~~
:15min:
that was just a regular katana with a similar name because muh grorious nippon
but once active, it's less
gravity anomaly pls
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so it should push it back?
so long as the explosion didn't alter the orbit they should be fine
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
(assuming we don't befriend Shem-ha of course)
if you can destroy the problem at its source
why bother with the jammer
just recalibrate it and dissect the universal language
actually if you're using the Chateau
you can't deny their power and all that jank
and once literally god is destroyed with songs
sure he's lawful evil, but not *lawful stupid*
and his way failed catastrophically
because it got results
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
clearly they'll just repurpose Yggdrasil as a planetary shield
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
no need for epilogue for the dead
they actually died upon entry and are now literal valkiries
or the ultimate copout
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
*keywords epilogue*
it'll probably work a similar way than in AXZ in terms of how much is spent in fight/epilogue
brilliant
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so in this scenario her treating doctor is Ryoko who then quits and is replaced by Ver?
so what does FIS represent?
that's some really impressive practical SFX considering all the shit that happens
~~I pictured Bikki in that scenario but with Enki and Shem-ha taking notes~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
unless shem-ha gets her way of course
they still have free will and stuff
not to mention it's just an answer to how humans came to exist in that universe
awesome
so he stacks even more absurd ninja techs on his guns
because why the hell not
Dude my relic is the concept of the big bang, therefore anything that's defined as something that exists on some level, even as an idea, has to obey to it.
can we self-insert as an unknown Kazanari for a more edgy backstory and meme genes?
thanks, I hate it
lmao
but yeah it's probably the one to animate if you were to pick one
from what I hear most of the XDU stories are kind of bad so I was putting myself in the "this is going to suck" scenario
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209> <:Ver:336656981144109066>
better yet, it shows imagery of that one event
Basa & Maria: "let's just keep quiet, we have nothing good to say to these ones anyways, *especially to the chibi bat*"
just good leader and evil leader
13 episodes is a bitch, no time to show an entire pantheon if we also have NR and Fudou to worry about
that somehow resulted into the rebuilt gears
technically it was perfected due to an improv by Bikki and the bridge team
and she also can't make gears
so the same as Elfnein installing upgrades
not made it from scratch
Ver modified SSJ
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
*screams in Marduk being TL'd as Murdock*
realized that some time ago, thought it was a funny coincidence since many fans of shows dreaded reaching that number because it usually meant you're getting canned unless it's very successful
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
maybe they just don't wanna draw her for some reason
I already had my share of sudden tragedy for the rest of the year with something else this week, pls no <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
let that sink in, thinking murica in gear would not fuck up
you're assuming the muricans wouldn't have fucked up with the vambrace at some point
nothing beats the phone
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well their hair *is* on fire
preemptive, but still
F
thanks
oh I see
what does the burning X-Drive keyword say exactly?
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
and that's the difference between having a "filler" arc on your season or not, one character remembering to mention the one thing the mad scientist parroted a million times
Ver: "ThE sEcReT iS lOvE" x 100 times
Maria: "I wonder if I should tell someone else about this"
The audience: "OH COME ON"
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
and Bikki is lamenting she doesn't have the alchemist ghost to help her with the chemistry test
Shem-ha herself didn't deny the damage too so I assume it doesn't work in fights between divine beings
aka. pipe dream
unicorn as in, have you seen an irl unicorn? precisely
you're setting yourself for dissapointment with the lesbian couple part
No matter how this ends, just want to say that it's been an honor and a blast to have been on this ride with all you guys <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089> 
*sips*
or am I misremembering things?
like, since the promotional materials came out and stuff
Didn't they literally say out lout it's the last season?
~~should I post that doujin?~~
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so do I get isekai'd as an Ogawa or Kazanari secret brother with edgy backstory, bs powers and an op relic exclusive to myself like we were saying the other day?
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
should mute this soon
speaking of that
so tons gets left out
can't condense for shit
spoiled by having a shitload of time to develop a bunch of things
not really, that's just a consequence of putting a jrpg writer in charge
if anything you're stealing from them in their eyes

Shemmy, is it just me or your horn is gold *before* being hit by Carol's thing?
anon took some suggestions so have a revised and most likely final version
~~Custodians they went to the Starcraft universe and got an even worse result than with Shem-ha~~
~~kinda bummed about being right all along about no Kimi Dake Ni (to the point I think I jinxed it), oh well at least the melody was playing in the background of the last scene~~
yeah
no subs for the songs
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~don't thank me I'm just an /a/ lurker~~
in case anyone wants a hugeass image with every chart ~~including the S1 one with the anal jokes before gaijins became a thing~~
<:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
now that I'm checking it it's missing something in the GX and AXZ ones
I can post all the individual ones if you want them separate ~~including the S1 one with the unfunny jokes~~
<@!143450645637103616> reactions to each episode, they're a tradition in geah threads on /a/
<@!143450645637103616> they have an extra one for the ending scene in GX and AXZ as well
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
better than the alternative "Carol repaired a gear that was completely obliterated"
oh welp
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
yeah that was my guess, the thing is the activation chant is throwing me off
how did the SSJ gear even happened at the end? It had an activation chant so it wasn't a Faust Robe
nope
only people into the thing I know are people I showed the series to myself
I live in a latin american country, not really as far as I'm concerned
yup
apparently the spanish version of CR subs actually has the song subbed, also reverse Ai no Tame on top of Metanoia lol
on that front I mean
count your blessings, this is far more than I expected
lol
honestly what got me the most was the pose he was in all the time, not even giving the geahs a glance
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

I mean if we're getting technical and stuff can't Elf9 just prod into her brain again and see if she comes back again?

and then two shooting stars cross
denying at this point low-key is akin to denying the romance in Clannad because they don't show the kiss on screen in the anime
~~inb4 it's Cag~~
it's not like she has anyone else in that cameo central to talk to
yes, but maybe she actually took the chance to apologize for that or something
~~it's Fine~~
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Being a Faust Robe makes more sense but wouldn't surprise me if they go KiSeKi and call it a geah because of the chant
she just plays the harp
what?

*laughs in basa south park walk cycle*

eye change is when she says the song in your heart thing to bikki
after it

wasn't that line hinting at the Fine thing?
~~I was about to say that would be an option~~

they're always really good tho
of course, XDU will keep going for a while
anyways, despite what I said I don't expect it to continue beyond maybe some movie project announced at the live and even then I don't think they'll alter this ending
(yeah I know, more limited character choice and stuff, but still)
People are burned out on SW because of bad writing, you can't make the argument about franchise fatigue when people eat up to 3 marvel movies a year

Guys, I...
Unless you mean the fangame in which case I hope it gets finished at some point <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
No we won't, they already never licensed much merch in terms of figures for whatever reason, no reason to think they'll actually bother with a game that isn't mobile gacha.
that's more random, having Shem-ha with the Annunaki one was what made the thing for me

I repeat, you can't make this shit up <:Ver:336656981144109066>

>MAL scores mattering
you'll still get to harvest the salt with the weekly episode MAL chart

<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
SSJ is a mirror, clearly she just had a mirror image of herself yeet her
they feel tacked together just because
I agree, wouldn't even suspect they're two parts of the same song in the state it was released
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
em he said "world history", so the tree just displayed data for Enki
even as a hologram
well given the context it's not strange for one of them at least to think about the dude that infodumped them on everything a few hours earlier
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
They're just very vivid collective hallucinations caused by the tree
unless Kirika was wrong and Fine just went with the LARP because chance to nope out
well they couldn't be because Fine
>no Chris parents
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
since we know thanks to AXZ he lives rent-free on her head
So basically Maria is to blame for <:Ver:336656981144109066>
lol
It's gear, I'm always prepared for that
I could buy most, sans Fine because you know and Ver because "why are you even here?"
what is it?
Fine in that scenario: "Hey dumbass blonde descendant of mine, yeah you, the one who keeps going "dess" all the time, your scythe sucks!"
how's the salt on the comment section of that btw? can't check right now and it's one of the only things of some value MAL charts provide
Well that allows him to avoid flak from any side and leave the fighting about that (regardless of how obvious it was) to the fanbase just to see for how long that sticks
after Shirabe sniped that tablet thing Carol's plan was pretty much finished, there was no recovering from that
not even the accelerant, he gave also the source of the fire as far as I'm concerned
just because he felt like it
not gonna excuse GX on that front however, he literally just saved the world from the same plan he helped put into motion an hour earlier
AXZ did nothing that GX hadn't already in terms of that
how is that redeeming him in any way? all he did was modify that thing to mind control the user
Ver modified it and added the Direct Feedback System
she did make it
~~the real clever part was everyone else joining instead of watching that happen~~
and then welp
the best part was that I literally said I wanted her to snipe one of those a week earlier and lamented that it was never going to happen
to the question from <#336310266654490624>, Chris denying the teleport crystal, or Basa jumping in on their ride to the moon

yup, guy's getting hanged for sure

Supposedly the building normally had a security system that only allowed entry with a keycard, but it was turned off because there was a meeting in the morning. Yeah this fucker had things carefully planned, no way he got this "lucky"

he's getting hanged for sure
no chance, too many people were killed

I was going more from "the wiki edit actually happened the same in geah universe, since it's 2040-something enough people have bought into it to give you power"
"but I was using Ichaival before that was a thing?" <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
I just find it funny how they could bullshit it back into existence in Geah even if they went for the "was never actually a thing" route in-universe
and then someone with an edit slipped it into actual mythology and since the internet uses Wikipedia as source... <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
yup
A lot of stuff from Fire Emblem 4 (where Ichaival comes from) is straight up mythology references, what with the crusader that wielded the bow being called Ulir and all, they needed names for all the crusaders of the respective holy weapons and they had to sound myth like because holy blood mechanic
the made up part is the connection with Ichaival
nope, he's an actual norse god
sorry bout that
so Ichaival is a conceptual weapon in the same vein as the (AXZ Spoiler)||Gungnir's godslayer|| <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>

Yes but don't put the thing in quotation marks that imply the guy actually said the line, no need to weaken the argument with things that aren't true when McCarthy's position is dumb as hell to begin with (speaking about the guy who made the tweet here)

The one relief is that I don't have to worry about having to go to work today (I work near one of the places where there was looting and arson) as our boss just told everyone to stay at home if possible and suspend any hearings or trials we may have either today or tomorrow.
Meanwhile here in Chile things have never deteriorated so quickly since the 1973 coup and the most similar situation is from 1957 which ended with people being gunned down by the military... and we have military on the streets and curfew since yesterday, looting and arson still persisted during the night, things are calmer now but who knows when shit will start again.
which is why I plan to get the hell out of this city as soon as I can, there's no future here anyways, place will be a wasteland due to climate change in about 20 years

it's not just that (though this specific hike was the equivalent of $0.04, that means it was at $1.13 before this), it's a combination of a ton of previous things like electricity bills going up by 10% this year, general lack of social policies, the fact that the price had already increased by almost the same amount at the start of this year and that minimum wage is stupidly low ($422 a month, working 45 hours a week) despite the city being as expensive to live in as freaking Tokyo.
the entire handling of the situation has been the authorities trying to put out a fire with gasoline
doesn't help that upon the price raise one of the ministers said to the press "well they can get up early to avoid rush hour fare"
yes, as I said, straw that breaks the camel's back pretty much
not arguing against that, but no one thought things would reach this level
started as peaceful fare dodging 4 days ago, devolved into rioting for rioting's sake by the end of today
pretty much straw that broke the camel's back case
never seen things escalate to this level so fast, after this they started setting stations on fire and now they declared state of emergency for the whole capital
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/18/chile-students-mass-fare-dodging-expands-into-city-wide-protest
well today was a complete shitshow here alright
in case anyone wonders, this explains what caused the sudden escalation here in a concise manner (there was another similar image going around in Reddit, but it had a few inacurracies that undermined the points so it got cleaned up a bit).

That aside, geah being there at all still surprises me, also what happened with Dr Stone? It was hype central for it back when the season started but it's been missing for a long time in these tops already.

basically imagine you release a show that you gave it a budget basically consisting of a ramen and 2 onigiri, you pretty much sent it out to die

they literally needed an epilogue outside the show to explain the end of S1 and them being able to ||punch Ammy out of there doesn't make sense given how little energy Shinju had left||
explain being kind of generous
either ||got riced or didn't pray hard enough||
I blame Kadokawa, they really should've greenlighted a 12 episode sequel instead of half prequel half sequel
Tfw you pray so hard to ||ascend you turn into rice only for your soul to be consumed minutes later because fuck gods fuck yeah mankind. It was definitely not the Taisha's day||
Well considering ||Amaterasu got punched in the face/mirror a little too hard and decided to just fuck off and let mankind live and Shinju is dead,|| probably no sequel aside from maybe a SoL OVA/VN or something at most. ~~NoWaYu adaptation please~~
got you covered
kinda complex
1 Core + 8 additional processing elements
dunno, I've just seen some of the charts posted here or in the other channels
Also it's not really surprising that the sequels, if handled well, (which I can vouch for so far in the case of Gear) end up rating highly since people that will vote for those are the ones who already enjoy the show since why the heck would you be watching the continuation otherwise.
From what I've observed it seems like that chart wants to rate the anime episodes of its specific season whether they're sequels or not. People in it for the seasonal grind however will for the most part ignore most sequels aside from the popular stuff or stuff they've watched (see. anitubers and shit).
episode 19 at least which would be the previous week, still at the top if I'm eyeballing it at least
for whatever's worth it would be at the top of that chart if I just eyeball the average in the respective MAL thread where those scores are pulled from
which does mean the 2 cours from the past season are not included
it says at the bottom, *excludes leftover shows*
holy shit <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
>complaining about ridiculous premise on a symphogear server
I haven't watched it but really now
[insert snarky comment about near-slavery conditions of animators]
it's still nothing I'd call good regardless, but the anime just pisses me off
WN is just shit
LN was fine too in that regard at least
and the both endings for the WN sucked too
also the original death for Malty is also too much
can't find that one execution scene but it's really fucking bad
WN is too much of an edge fest
<@238855496797257729> stuff like that is part of what I meant when I said they sanitized him too much in the anime compared to the source material, but of course we must remove anything that might make him look bad even though the whole point is that he is bitter as fuck.
"are you really ok with killing this asshole?"
LN: "of course?! He'll keep doing this shit and ruin more lives"
Anime: "If I kIlL hIm Im ThE sAmE "
I dropped it after they changed the whole standoff with the fat slaver
but I was still mad at the sanitization of the MC in the anime
not gonna lie
it's not good
(in comparison to whatever point I reached in the LN)
anime made things considerably worse, dunno about the manga
no longer a slave due to plot by probably halfway through the second season tho
lol
it's on some of the older keywords I think
~~actually it's "Nehushtan fragments partly fused with her body as was visibly shown during combat needed to be removed" but that works too~~
which just makes me go "yeah ok I'll  buy it but why the BDSM imagery"
the more hilarious part is the actual justification
meh, it's just a "well that happened I guess" moment considering it's never mentioned again or anything
dunno her age so I wouldn't know how out of line it'd be really
or the part where she almost gets cut in half and then just regenerates
aside from that one part where her flesh fuses with Solomon's Cane and stuff
Honestly little me would remember jam and Kanade getting dusted more than Fine's shenanigans
-Takahiro, probably
"you will get blue balled by c-shadow suffering and will like it dammit"
~~I also want to see all the anime-only watchers very confused at Takashima's whole existence~~
I want to see Scorpio become the most hated Vertex and suffering
Give me a fucking NoWaYu adaptation
~~unless they're blatantly adapting the manga with its changes and all~~
I think LN is the thing that matters for this stuff
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
oh yeah, shield hero has material for like 4 seasons more lmao
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah but he wants two more announced at the same time
dunno, probably the streaming and merch bucks actually delivered since they were banking more on that than actual BD sales (the whole market for those has shrinked to the point if you're smart you're not relying on those anyways)
the LN I can at least use to waste some time as dumb entertainment
though yeah you expect generic as hell harem with the initial premise and all
Alto's a pretty cool guy
it's his favorite 3ds game
and now suddenly the one geah rec to a friend that worked makes sense
~~plus it gives me weeb points I guess~~
~~use whatever you want, I just refuse to use Swan Song for a bunch of reasons and the canon translation sounds off~~
manga I believe also has some stuff that's only explicitly said in keywords in the show, like how Fine purposely set up the concert for one of Zwei Wing to die including not telling them how to zesshou properly (channel it into an armed gear, channeling it as an explosion skyrockets backfire) and reducing Kanade's Linker dose, but it's ultimately not canon
No idea, this is anime original anyways so the canon is show + keywords
a lot of stuff being left out is what happens when you give only 13 episodes to a guy used to write for JRPGs
also adds this gem afterwards
"However, this course of action was also Fine’s twisted preference for punishment inflicted due to Chris’s mission failure, based on the philosophy she holds that “pain is the only thing that can create bonds between human hearts.”"
that's on the second part of the Nehushtan keyword
"During episode 5, a scene depicted Fine inflicting Chris with an electric current. This was a measure taken to shock the fragments of the Nehushtan into a temporary idle state so they could be removed. When the armor was initially damaged by Tsubasa’s Superb Song, the fragments penetrated into Chris’s body during the regenerative process and began to multiply."
never trust wiki btw
<#337805317276565525> <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
and given the nature of them in-universe having them be in a different language than what's spoken by the characters actually works for the setting
the only part that could've gone seriously wrong in the dub (the songs) is still in japanese anyways.
That's a non-issue if the songs are passable enough
Is it worth watching if I was very underwhelmed at the way the series finale played out?
~~He was also pretty good at calling out attacks in the Gunvolt games~~
yup
I mean he wouldn't get the hax if it weren't for situations aligning so that he goes full edgelord
amusingly enough dude should by all accounts be in the luck side
yeah that's why I said it was dumb how no one in the freaking planet thought of doing that stuff
so wtf
but it's supposed to be a hardcore PvP game
I mean if it were a super casual game maybe I could buy most of the playerbase being too stupid, *and even then it's a stretch*
seriously, how the fuck did no one even think of performing those stunts with the lightsaber weapons
*laughs in GGO arc* tho
since he always hacks the matrix and stuff
but we're not shown much
we're *told* he works hard
Naruto is kind of a fun case, starts as hardwork, then is progressively revealed as the other team the more the series goes on
of course it'd be nothing for him
as Melua said, that dude is jacked up the wazoo in cybernetics
though arguing the specifics of it is kind of moot because it was never meant to be taken seriously anyways, it's basically the punchline of a joke
the running part is the worst of it right?
it's mostly a parody, I can buy it given the setting
who the hell knows, this chart means fuck all and the only reason I'm following it weekly is because of the salt it produces
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

MAL
but hey
not keeping carryovers is arbitrary and dumb as fuck, 2 cours get screwed as hell
Now to answer your question, because it's easier to alter a score of something with a low voting base, but that's going rampant on the overall score, not on forum polls
it's still just MAL garbage
~~it's not bots in this case, why the heck do I have to repeat myself every week~~
posting weekly meaningless chart

they'll keep appearing until a new trend to drive into the ground is found
I mean was EMT anything more than visual appeal?
darling made sure to kill it halfway through anyways
||so he gets to watch her wither and die?||
but without a LN TL I can't actually check for myself since I can't into moonrunes
only reason I can buy the excuse is because anime-original endings and tons of alterations to source material were commonplace back then
though that might have been a guy talking out of his ass
||as in supposedly he empathized with the denizens more and was less of a goody two-shoes from the start||
yeah
but as it stands on the anime
which is why I kinda reserve judgement on the matter
don't know how much of that was part of the sanitization
snake was right though
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
dude being a snake fanboi
Shakugan no Shana
or so I've been told
~~reminder that one had the final season not make sense because they sanitized the MC on the first seasons~~
you're sorely underestimating the numbers of that legion of fans
but I agree, since 2 cour is relatively common practice anyways it should at least include those
yeah but then you get people saying "why 2 anime seasons and not more?" and so on
draw the line somewhere and all that
yep, though maybe it's just a way so that endless shonen and the like doesn't clog the charts
yeah I know, I was just joking about how to game the system
regardless of whether it is or not
clearly the big brain play here is labeling your second cour as 2nd season
just write friends or comrades in the subs ffs
thought it was dumb in 2006, still think it is now
dunno if it's still a thing
but that didn't prevent every single freaking sub group out there to just leave the word as is in OP releases back in the day
yes
but then you have people arguing about not translating nakama
even though unintentionally so
~~that's actually at least funny~~
and endless TL notes, those were also fun times
why are you clogging the subs with that?
generally speaking I can put up with leaving that in, pet peeve of mine is with verbal ticks, *I can tell he/she adds that shit to everything he/she says for the audio so of course it doesn't mean anything*
also not consistent terminology usage because I got different sub group releases within the same season, that was fun
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
literally adding the "-dearimasu" verbal tick the maid had on the subs
also subs themselves on some episodes irritated me
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
incest duo didn't because they were pretty clearly throwaway villains that would get offed soon
I remember at least that much
I will say that the other love interest almost got me to drop the thing at some point however
problem with binge watching is that your critical thinking kind of gets dulled along the way so long as the start is decent and there's some good moments sprinkled along the way
kind of? I know I didn't keep going out of spite at the very least
so basically, call it a whim mixed with YT algorithm slightly manipulating it I guess?
nobody told me about it, just got the first OP on my YT rec feed for some reason and was just in the mood to give almost anything that fate threw my way at the time a try
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
except this one lasts for like 2 episodes
that's tame in comparison considering it lasts half of what a single scene of those other 2 going at it does
yeah it's a big case of "well that happened I guess"
but yeah that was wtf
~~at least they looted a dope sword from them~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~it wasn't a rewatch, I decided to watch that for the first time in 2019 for some reason~~
and yes I'm actually checking in real time this because I just watched this months ago and forgot to delete it from my hard drive so might as well
||he never showed up for the other girl so I think the choice's pretty clear unless I'm missing something||
||considering the sort of deal he made, I can buy he did actually show up and then vanished||
||then final shows he did show up for Shana, but immediately dissapeared when she approached him||
||pretty clearly implies he showed up for Shana, then OVA for II tells things went horribly wrong instead||
understandable, as I said, things just don't make sense because they jumped from heavily altered S1 and 2 into 1:1 LN
why do you think the world enlarges so suddenly and almost makes you feel like you missed a lot of background information in final?
<@87512939107450880> that's the problem, supposedly lots of things that make the transition into that beyond ||can't choose so let's just summon god lmao|| make sense are on the LN versions of the S1 and S2 events, as in it feels a lot less inconsistent/out of character
~~details, yep I fucked up meant final, dunno why I thought it was 4~~
||big bad in 4th season, Yuuji agrees to be his vessel, actually wins and finally gives a solution to the denizen problem||
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
long live the snake btw
at least that's how I see it
so you want out
*you* didnt choose to be isekai'd
yeah but that's precisely why you would want to come back, *you* miss them
which makes sense no matter how cool the new world is
for the most part on the older isekai the protagonist has family and friends he/she wants to come back to
if your self-insert appeals to otaku with empty lives why would you have him want to go back and all
~~actually nowadays with isekai wish fulfilment deal most of the time they either can't or don't want to go back~~
dulls senses and everything becomes a mush
could also be the whole binge effect I told you about doing its part as well
and considering my memory is usually really good, that says a lot about the whole thing lmao
I literally only remember a blur for the most part
||Don't remember the specifics (author of the source material died before he could finish it) but dude goes back to his world and brings Louise with him||
You made a wise choise
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~Shoot me I hate-watched the whole thing~~
yes
So long as it doesn't follow the Louise template, yes
"I King Dragon will strike y-"
*gets slapped, dies*
"I found all 900 pine cones"
*credits roll*
I like the "King Dragon saga" videos
yup, found it funny how that pretty much summed up my experience on the whole subject
and then you had literal walls of text as TL notes, because of course

it's brilliant, stop the cheat mode immediately after you don't need escalating sales for more seasons getting greenlit
last minute possible cancelations and stuff
and the BD came out so...
well they didn't announce a live at all
it basically serves as extremely cheap advertisement for the featured isekai
yep
there you go

the biggest is still proper planning and all that
yeah I know, it's only one factor
Japan economy being in a comparatively worse state overall and all
or at least that's what I've been told
anyways, back on topic, animation quality can kinda regress considering there's less money to throw at anime nowadays compared to those old OVAs with very high quality
X is a spinoff <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> ~~also didn't play it so I wouldn't know, Torna combat is better in any case~~
yep
well as one guy on a videogame that's basically an anime anyways once put it:
~~same~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Don't you know? Social media validation is the ultimate measurement of quality!
~~thank god I didn't like that one to begin with~~ F for the fans tho
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I keep hearing S1 pacing is wack tho
kinda hated M2 due to how many stuff it skipped from A's and I didn't have any issue with the later's pace
~~I watched M1 instead of S1 and then watched everything else, didn't feel I missed anything~~
like I'd watch it just to bask on the stupidity
I've read a copypasta that supposedly has some truth to it, let's just say that if even a tenth of it is true then it'll be legendarily stupid
~~Force really is the Mega Man X7 of Nanoha~~
or at least that's what I'm told
loooots of what you'd consider "filler" or "unimportant stuff"
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
~~S1 on the other hand...~~
I found the pacing in As fine as well
Can't blame them, it tends to dull critical thinking and thus people end up liking whatever they're binging more than if they had to deal with weekly releases
Man does Bayonetta 2's way of handling enemies piss me off sometimes. So much shit randomly parrying your stuff mid-combo even when launched or flat out ghosting through wicked weaves with little warning.
