Oh wait
I never ate pizza hut... I don't think it's even on my country
I once watched a hentai just for a pizza that looked so good

Good son

He made that Okita pic I share. Seems like he likes Okita a lot
#1 was Alter vs Berserker
#3 was Sakura's dream on HF2
#2 best scene in HF imo
That battle was epic

the one you tag me
<@!196268149723627520> look at the author of that pic
Noise Rider too
Noise Okita
Best king

Ah yes. Just what a need to keep living a happy life
You did but I'll never get tired of it
Oh, that's cool
I can't deny that
I was about to save that image. Not very thoughtful of you, pug!
I never used Patreon
Do I buy the $10 subscription and I can save all the art he uploaded to date and up to a month later?
So what
<@!279115815494877184> It's really tempting
F
I do
Dont worry. Support the artist is the right thing to do
He didnt catch the indirect
<@279115815494877184> <@196268149723627520>
That's because he's Fake Okita
Okita is Kohaku face

Thanks
It was anyway depending of the situation. Like it wouldn't make sense for a warrior woman to have little clothes for protection or if the person goes to a cold place in the same way
I showed a pic of Kainé from Nier Replicant to a friend and he said it was wrong because she had an impossible figure that idealizes and objectifies women. He also said it was wrong for males as well when they show men too muscular
Just a general question
What do you guys think about sexualization in media
I like this
The sexualization is real, no doubt in that. What I debated with my friend was if it's really wrong for it to be present in media
I think the problem is people unable to separate fiction from reality
All Praise to Yoko Taro
Oh yeah. I just used NieR characters because that's the first thing that pooped in my head when I thought about hot women and my friend doesn't even know them
I don't think it wrong to enjoy this media since it's fiction. And I definitely won't expect women to be as "perfect" as 2B or the same with men
Well I don't think that scenario is far from reality but yeah, you're right
I never had a weapon. I'm just showing an example of what I think it could happen in that scenario
You're twisting my words here. I don't think it's one or the other. I do agree, with more regulations there would be less incidents
It's sad what happened to that family. But I see guns not just as a murder tool, but as a defense one as well. I see people saying "guns are bad" or "remove them" but then I think, sure. You can make laws, you can "remove them" but what about people who gets them illegally. What about criminals that tries to go inside your house and rob you, hurt you or your family. And then you're in a situation where they have a pistol and you only have a knife to protect them
Agree
I sure do. Obviously, guns make the problem a lot worse but they are not the source
To stop blaming tools and start thinking that
https://tenor.com/view/we-live-in-a-society-society-joker-gamers-rise-up-gang-weed-gif-13919217
Oh no, just some random kid with a knife, sure. It is essentially better, but the problem is still there
And so this begins
Somebody has to operate them, I think that someone is the problem
But that's the thing. They're just tools
If somebody wants to kill a person they would do it, with any means they can
You can take the guns away, people are gonna start using bats, kitchen knives, take those away, people are gonna use sticks and stones. I don't think an inanimate object is to blame here. Sure, it wouldn't be as bad as with guns but you can still kill people with rocks lol
*Are the guns to blame or the people using them*
Sadly true. We are stupid by default
I don't think I've been clear about something. I do believe restrictions about guns would be great to avoid a lot of incidents. I just don't believe in blaming the object for the people using them. I know they escalate the problem obviously
I just can't help but think, what if even with all the restrictions, it happens anyway
I belive you, I'd feel safer too if this was the case in my country
Im pizzivore
Gee Barry..
<:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
I'll have my map and funnometer prepared for the next time
*Don't know if expecting to laught but definitely not expecting to escalate to this*
Gee I know this is the serious discussion channel but I didn't expect you guys to be so out of humour
You expected me to switch channels to make that joke?
I was

Facts

I have faith
> what is there to talk about ?
<@!114081181611458563> The beautiful SNK4 trailer
I find the lack of SNK talk in this channel quite disturbing
But yeah. It's very edgy
Enough to go right away to read the manga and read 50 chapters in 1 day
I like it
This is cute and sad at the same time. Mahou Shoujo Site
> If you enjoy despair for the sake of despair then mahou shoujo site is your type of show
<@195044406343106560> I confirm
> maybe this is why I'll never understand people who rate Sympho G higher than s1 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@139432096023183360> why not. I like it a lot more lol
I watch a few episodes but dropped it
> I always found the Date A Live anime to have really weird pacing
<@!195044406343106560> For me it goes worst on visual and better on story from S1 to S3

A cruel world
That's hell you're walking into
> all these spoilers tempting me rn
<@!676272618839605249> Don't do it
The one who|| eats Ymir||
> what happened to ||current Ymir||
<@!145705908716961792> She was ||eaten by Porco||
He'll probably will
I never really had problems like that but I can understand why other may do
I once confused Eren to Frida lol
It's how Kaguya said. This was all planned and would only make sense that way. A new character wouldn't have the same impact
She's one of the reasons of why ||Gabi doesn't think they are demons anymore||
Why would the ||little girl that Sasha saved in the forest hate Gabi for killing her then||
Besides... half of the things that happens after wouldn't make sense if someone else was in her place
But she's a fan fav
Everyone hates her tho
And that is needed for us to empathize with both sides
No, seriously. It was needed for ||Gabi's development||
So that Isayama could enjoy our tears
> ||Sasha didn't have to die||
<@!145705908716961792> It had to happen
> i will forever hate the author for something that will happen in S4

Now I want to watch the entire show again
Always being bullied
Poor little thing. She's so pure
She is really cute

||Founder, Attacker and Warhammer. Porco has Jaws, Annie has Female, Armin has Colossal, Reiner has Armored, Pieck has Cargo...|| I'm missing one I think
He has ||Warhammer||

<@!453836798796234762> I waited 84 years for that to happen
> fucking ||Ymir was jaw titan||?
<@!145705908716961792> Yeah
This is Porco
Fire don't see this
It makes sense tho
Personally I think this is one of the best arcs on SNK
> ||remember when attack on titan was about the titans? good times||
<@279341087494242304> it's even better now
Pieck? Nah, don't worry
> Pieck? 
<@202444817043685386> you'll know soon enough. Don't worry
I was about to say that the image below apply for Gabi too... Then I remember that I love her

Thanks for the HD

Jesus Fucking Chris Author-san!
Yuri is love

> What animu is that Niko
<@!160142617940590594> That's Mahou Shoujo Site
The author cut that story on chapter 55 and started some kind of prequel
This girls
After this I'm gonna go read the other mahou shoujo story from the same author
What's this To be continued man, well I'm not complaining. Arc 2 is good too
I'm sad for the OG yuri girls
I just did. That's fucked up
Did you read Sept?
The one with the ||snake tongue||
75
Especially after failing to get Okitan and reading Mahou Shoujo Site
Thanks, I needed that
Unless the episodes are longer than 1 hour he can. Who needs to sleep (jk)
It's all for pedos
Maybe they were attracted to the girls
Who cares how edgy is. As long as you enjoy it
That's the whole point right? If you like it or not
Good or bad for whom
> (I'm sad tho because I tend to prefer shows to comics, what with things like "motion" and "sound" and "bangers" and etc.)
<@!160142617940590594> It's a good anime imo. The anime hooked me up. After I finished I read 50 chapters in one day lol
I liked the anime tho. It's just that I like this most
You could.. for start... but the manga is way better imo
I wanna leave
Yeah
Like when you say "Holy shit"
More like a surprise expression
Not an insult really
Something like that
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
I'm argentinian lol
Yeah, sorry
You guys are talking about this? https://www.crunchyroll.com/es/yuki-yuna-is-a-hero
I've finished reading Mahou Shoujo Site. God that was beautiful

No, I never traveled
lol

<@453836798796234762> it's too much sugar for my breakfast

<@676272618839605249> if only we had the founder titan to delete your memory

Yeah, you could see how things are going outside Paradis since the end of S3
You will get it if you read that but it's a heavy spoiler if you don't read the manga
Well... this is spoiler... but without context you won't get it
And I love it
Leaks from SNK came out and all the fandom is like
DC animated films are great
lol
Snk



I saw Madoka for the first time last year. That stupid cat was very suspicious since the beginning. Too anxious for them to become magical girls
> It was kinda obvious
<@202444817043685386> not for me. Maybe I am smol brain
SNK S2 spoiler
Isn't Illya ||condemned||? You know, because she's half ||homunculus||?
Illya's love is Miyu
> Would she be like her sister
<@202444817043685386> I don't think so. She didn't act like her when she was a child
If they leave the magi path I'm sure everything would work out in some way
He's always speaking about being the perfect father. Well, yeah, for Rin maybe, but you forgot you had another daughter dude
> Tokiomi was thinking he was doing the right thing by give one of his children to another mage family
<@!202444817043685386> Yeah, because he always put the magi over his family. And that's why I hate him
Also fuck Tokiomi for leaving Sakura behind
https://youtu.be/QGskWZCuCXI
When Kirei and Gilgamesh are conspiring against Tokiomi it feels like that scene with Homer and Skinner
YARUNDANA? IMA KOKO DE!?
Is that Dora?
Anko is... Was top tier
Sadly
Yes it is
Just why
In case I cry, of course
Just in case
I'll watch on a TV in the living at max volume... I'll take your word on the tissues tho
Now I have to watch dxd
> When you start watching High School DxD and Rias starts talking
<@453836798796234762> now you see what you make me do
https://youtu.be/cgFQb6t9KWw
Watch TLR then
https://youtu.be/UCRMvRtkIuE
There's no way I'm reading that lol


It's only as expected of best girl from Naruto
Well yeah. She shares v.a with Tsubasa
Hinata is best grill
I just started watching again from ep 1. I'm on 33
Don't know about the rest
The third is fine again
The second is great
The first arc is fine
All for Hinata's happiness
Worth it
That's crazy, crazy!
It's not on CR?
What?
I mean
Your sister is in love with a girl that lvoes you? Just fuck them both
It makes you think how a lot of problems would be easily solved if people talk and try to understand each other
Thanks
Where?
> Now that I think about it, does Satania actually do anything power wise? I can't remember her really doing much lol
<@!171395487247630336> She gives a weapon to the worst person
I mean home
Mikasa is Eren's house
I'm used to Mikasa, maybe that's why
It sounds so weird
I hate the name Misaka
Wtf
Megumin panties are darker than black
Yeah, about best girl Megumin
Cgtranslations will start uploading it in 2 weeks I think
It's not translated yet tho > They released an other one ?
<@114081181611458563>
That's not the last volume
Then I'd just do that
I don't mind the incest. I enjoyed both seasons. I wouldn't say it's perfect but it's pretty fun to watch
I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't watch that anime lol
Boruto: Promise you will go to Himawari's birthday
Naruto: I promise
Me after seeing the movie: No, I don't think he will
No, she's not like that
Yeah, I figured it lol
Well, his sister is a tsundere that calls him by his name or aniki
Either with his sister or her friends
Pretty much the entire anime has scenes like that
That's his imouto's friend
https://youtu.be/cgFQb6t9KWw
This is from oreimo
It just happens that one of the girls is an imouto
It's like any other harem
I don't think it's a bad anime
> How bad is Oreimo really?
<@453836798796234762> I like it
Boruto 50: summary of everything prior to that episode
Smol brain Nico: rewatch first 50 episodes of Boruto because I don't remember anything
They destroyed my city and ate my mom
I saw it because the style remember me to Chuunibyou
I saw it one time. Never went back to it. I kinda remember some things but not too much
> Never forget seven deadly sins
<@279341087494242304> also never saw that and I don't intend to lol
It pisses me off
And the OP is used for like 30 eps while the ED is used for half of them
https://youtu.be/vneuc9OXWG4
It's so different in quality
It's just... Look at the ending of the same arc
> When I see shit like this I pity the poor animators that had to deliver something like this with a shitty deadline/pay 😦
<@114081181611458563> yeah. You're right
https://youtu.be/FBX11V6yObw
Look at this shit
Whoever anímated Boruto OP 3 deserves to be shot

> The problem is that they didnt actually end up together
<@279341087494242304> I like to believe they're still going out in secret
> Best girl won though
<@278860841485598720> indeed
Yeah, that clone shuriken was great
The animation can be great, especially on important battles... And the pacing is really good. Doesn't feel like they need to make original and boring episodes like Naruto needed so that it wouldn't reach the manga
See. Boruto is not really a bad show. It does some good things from time to time
https://youtu.be/RzClCJFpSoM
Boruto 65 is gold
I just love Kiritsugu, Kirei, Gilgamesh, Artoria, Iskandar and Waver
Funny. Naruto is hated by everyone at the beginning for no reason and after doing good things everyone start to love him... While Boruto has a brighter start but because he did bad things people started to hate him
I like Fate Zero as an anime... But reading the LN... I'm on the last volume and I don't think I'll ever do it again
A lot of exposition?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzOr_5bSdQU
Yeah I don't think he would still believe it after seeing that battle lol
They don't care how or if they're doing it fine. They just have to
A lot of media wants to introduce LGBT and other stuffs on everything no matter how
I just took the chance to say what I think about the subject
Nah
Even Jacob Frye from AC Syndicate I think was gay
Bill from TLOU was also gay
Kung Jin from Mortal Kombat X was gay. That wasn't the focus on his character
Let's say we have a game about saving a world and a random gay characters appears. A character who's only porpuse and characteristic is being the gay character. That feels forced to me. If it's just another feature of a character that's not the real focus on a game that doesn't have anything to do with lgbt then I'm fine with it
Are we making rituals here?
They are so gay and I love it

<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>
You know you're old when you remember the song of an anime ending at 4:3
I love the part with Kurama
I like that one too. And this one

https://youtu.be/cjbA7th2rWo
It's really meaningful and symbolic about the whole story
This is so nostalgic and beautiful

I read some chapters of the manga, it's actually good
But better
It's SAO
Well. I have a long way ahead then
How many manga chapters are now?
I'm gonna go read the manga as soon as S2 ends
Ishigami is king since day one
You're really dumb in this season hahahahahah
Wtf happened to you
Jesus Christ Kaguya
I'm so glad I waited to watch Kaguya sama. If I had to wait a week for every episode I'd freak... I still have to wait for the last 2 but still. 10 episodes are good enough

I know ep 10 came out. I just don't know if it's the last one
Anime
Did Kaguya end? I'm about to start S2
Is Goku a good character then?
Goku?
Beat
He
Can
But
The guy with red hair is OP tho

> That's exactly something someone in denial would say
<@203444794737950720> we all know they keep it going in secret
> The rest never happened
<@278860841485598720> that's canon in my mind
I don't think so chief

I like money

The whole family is great
Kei is also great
Papa Shirogane
Shirogane dad is fucking awesome
I've been cursed
Jesus
Not me
Yeah, no. I'm not going there ever again
The purple hair?
You've been cursed btw
But what about eromanga sensei
Ok. Real question. We all love Oreimo (not really)
Don't know which one tho
I heard one of the songs. A cover from Amalee
(jk)
Of course SNK is the best anime of all time and that's a fact
Let's agree to disagree
Never watch Re creators tho
I don't mind that. I love SNK and it has a lot of build up
Assassin's Creed?
Interesting
Medaka Box? Never heard of it
Is Superman a good character then?
Because I love Sangatsu no Lion
> So I just had a revelation that two of my favorite anime of all time- Sangatsu no Lion and Gintama- are essentially the same show.
<@454822882045067298> that means I have to watch Gintama then

Poor Chika

So this is what happened to the movie tickets. I was wondering about it lol
Spoilers from SNK4
> Caught up in Bakarina. It's good the episode with the dungeon and the maid wasn't in the manga. But great additions
<@471416654346321930> I want to read that too
You're right. I won't probably catch up until S2 ends
I don't have any Kaguya sama episode left...
I was talking about her
What the fuck are you guys talking about lol
I almost read that

Mwam?
Well... I don't know the mom
Why is she so mean to Chika!?
Kaguya has good waifus but the comedy is what gets me. I mean, look a this shit

https://youtu.be/UNWcfrkRwtI
> i wish more anime were like AoT and didn't use exessive fanservice and waifus and took themselves more seriously
<@302063351767498752> SNK is the clear example. You don't need fanservice to triumph
I don't think so. I'm reading the og manga, vol 3, chapter 27.5

Why they didn't animate this!?
It's great
I read a lot of people hate Chika. Don't know why

Ishigod
https://youtu.be/thXmxblqSXk
But that's not the important thing because the anime also gets a lot of cute moments
> Is this another one of those ones where the manga gets a kiss but the anime doesn't
<@160142617940590594> yes it is
> Maybe I should watch Mahou Shoujo Site
<@160142617940590594> and read the manga right aftet
You guys clean keyboard?
He mad boi
Even the girls from Mahou Shoujo Site had a fucking kiss!
> I just want more Openly Gay action romance yuri is that so wrong
<@!160142617940590594> I just wanted a HibiMiku kiss but apparently that's too much to ask
Nanami

How so. Can't you see how sad it is for the other girl?
"there's no way I'd catch up the anime before S2 ends" was what I said... But I'm on chapter 50 of Kaguya already
Stupid mc
I liked the other one more tho
What was her name... ehh... something with white... Shiro?
Autistic blonde!
I wouldn't surprise if WW3 launchs this year
That doesn't look like her arm
I love this
https://youtu.be/fHBSoR6j6I0
I don't remember
Of maybe one or two. But not like Symphogear or something like that
There are no songs
The story is basically the same but has a lot of differences. The anime omits or changes a lot of things and has a new ending. But, voices and animation
Because Manga > Anime but you'd naturally want to read the manga if you like the anime
Anime first
> oh jesus christ the manga is 12 volumes deep that's a lot of dough
<@160142617940590594>  worth it
I didn't need to know that lol
Just found the name funny
Oh great
Studio nut? Lol
Philia needs to be on the anime
I still didn't watch last season of SAO and I don't remember much of first part!
> And so begins the post end of anime season depression
<@196268149723627520> unless it's Kaguya!
Fair enough
But they're identicals lol
But why both kids looked identical tho
Best anime of the season imo
First of sadness... Then of happiness
Right after TLOU2
It made me cry all the episode
Kaguya-sama is so unfair
I find your lack of tears for Ishigami quite disturbing
This is cursed

If it's unidentified you can't say it's a table!
If it's a table, it's not unidentified
But that's contradictory
I'm imaginating that
Wait... That may be wrong since my abc is pronounced different from yours
> Never knew how i was supposed to pronounce it

You want to shoot a man but you can't because he's not black
Classic
It happens to all of us
I need S3 rn
I went from sad to angry to happy in 20 minutes
Finally. It took 3 days for someone on this group to say something about it
You damn right he did
Ishigami rolled 1 and died
That's something that happens all the time tho
Yeah. MC pretty much has worst luck
What is pointless to u
But it's not all suffering
Manga?
I started watching Noragami. Does it have an animated ending or it's to be continued forever?
Without reading first 4 lol
I keep reading messages about that but have no idea of what it is
Or some messages were Remed?
Is it just me
> my brain already failing me at 2129
<@237964037898502144> mine*s worse. I though you said 2129 as in the year
What about Annie. She's hot too
People also ship Ymir and Historia
Yep

Indeed. Poor Jean tho

Oh god
SNK 3 Spoilers
Ok then lol
It's basically a mix of every other OP
Especially the last one
Clearly your taste is the bad thing here. How can you not like S3 OPs lol
That doesn't make it bad tho
You don't know what you're talking about

Noragami Aragato has easily one of the best OP I've ever seen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZenmeRytEM

> we didnt know beforehand they would do that tho
<@152896851660505088> but we could certainly skip the whole thing except the last 2 minutes lol
You could've just watch that scene you know lol

Great, gonna go watch it. Thanks
Re Zero S2E1 came out?
My TV doesn't even run FLAC audio lol
Ryzen 1600 AF and RX 570 should be able to handle it
So... H265 is better than H264 even though the files are a lot smaller?
How would i've download torrents, I don't wanna live in that world
Imagine if qbit failed me
Then I did the right choice
Utorrent and Bittorrent don't respond for whatever reason
I now have the power... of a 3TB HDD

SNK S4
Why is Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0? Why not just 4? (never saw Evangelion)
It's different but I love it


DAL3 I liked it for the sci fi
DAL 1 and 2 are the same shit
Konosuba is gold
You are
It is
Seriously just read it from the start
Or... Well. You could just start from the funeral. You'd miss a few things but the story is pretty much the same till that point
It has a lot of significative differences
Read it from the start
F stands for Fuck no
Didn't read that one tho
Yes, it's kinda like a spiritual sequel or something
Yes
> I mean, gayer
<@!160142617940590594> Manga is gayer+
> kinda liking it
<@!160142617940590594> Told ya
Well, Babylonia too but that's from FGO
Zero and UBW only on CR
But I know people who step away from Fate because of the excessive exposition on Zero
That's actually what I did
Can' help to think... Things could've been a lot better if LE had 24 eps
Stay away from Extra Last Encore imo
The rest, watch however and if you ever want to
So... UBW - Zero - SN / HF
Fair point
Or Heaven's Feel from Ufotable... I'd wait for the third part tho
Then... If you want you could watch Stay Night from Deen
Well... UBW from Ufotable. Then, Zero also from Ufotable
Ufotable only
Jesus no
Zero is the prequel but has a lot of exposition
Start with UBW
Anyone having troubles trying to open Netflix on PS4?
Just go to mangadex
Who buys them anyway
But a worthy one
You'll figure it out the right time
When it really matters
It's actually important but you can read it midway
2 vols
a prequel
There's Mahou Shoujo Site Sept
Not only that
Yep
Anime covers up to vol 6/16

This guy never learns
So... Sinon huh

I know you're right but it doesn't make it any less sad!
Still sad
Fuck my life
Why is everything so fucking bright in Re Zero 29
SAO it's pretty much black and white till the point I reached
That's why I like SNK... That's why I didn't hate TLOU2
Yeah, that's another thing I don't like about SAO. I could never empathize with the antagonists in the serie. And if I ever could, then I don't remember so it's pointless
It's good... just... again. This dude has a problem with rape
I did see a few pics from the new season ... This guy needs to stop using rape as his plot device already and that lance in the eye... yeah, I don't know what's wrong with the author but it's time to stop
I only saw first half of Alicization, btw
> Is it just me or do y'all secretly like SAO?
<@!676272618839605249> I publicly like SAO. It's one of the first season anime I watched and it was pretty cool for that reason. The more I see it the more things I dislike tho... All the death fear from ep 1 goes aways really quickly when you realize no main character will ever die and if they do, they'll magically survive... The whole Aincraid Arc... it's just boring. Just Kirito knowing some girls and making them fall in love in within 24 hours... Only a few episodes are interesting imo... ALO... it's just ALO. I don't wanna talk about it lol. GGO I actually liked it. Mother's Rosario is one of my favs. That arc between those with that sword... I don't know why that thing exists but it does. Alicization it's pretty good as far as I saw
> Yuru Yuri, Hajimaru Yooo
<@453836798796234762> she so cute
I want to say Eren but he's not really an antagonist I guess
Yuru yuri would help
You learn that with time

RIP FC barcelona.

Fate/stay night Heaven's Feel 3 is about to come out and there aren't open cinemas in Argentina. I wanna cry

I CAN'T READ
*that'll make the site unreachable/unusable for several hours. Go outside, read*

F for Mangadex
Sorry, it's the covid
cof cof Last Encore cof
Mangadex still survives?
So

Well, not gonna lie. Despite a few things I'm really enjoying Alicization and WoU
Even worse
And that idiot used a code written on his clothes... which he left for everyone to see
I know it's SAO but really
Oh come on. You can't be that stupid
Sinon knows how to make an entrance
I'm starting current season now
I have a bad feeling about this
This was also unnecessary
||Killing|| ||Eugeo ||was a mistake
I feel like that whole build up was for nothing
I ask because I saw first part of Alicization and I know his destiny
So... is this retaked in some point or just forgotten? SAO Alicization

How do you read these. Left or right first?


NOOOOOOO HAYASAKA WTF
Wait, so tell me already. Why is Gabriel so powerful. ||Is it because of soul absortion, or it's image about himself or something like that?||
Nothing at all tbh
I don't remember the first thing about AW lol
With ||the image his friends had of him to reconstruct his fluctlight||
He thinks himself as a God, so he can be?
Imagination?
Just because?
No, I mean Gabriel Miller
Dropout?
Unlimited Plot Armor Works!
Unlimited Power Works!
So... he's in a war where a lot of people are dying
And what you think makes you stronger on Alicization
He thinks he can absorb people's soul
Gabriel is a mentally broken person
I've been reading on Reddit
I think I understand now
He shouldn't be able to do most of those things right?
But that's his GGO character
I mean he's basically a god
But can anyone explain me why Gabriel is so powerful on Alicization?
So... I didn't notice it at first
They really nerfed shirogane's stats here huh
That boy and that family made me cry so much
3gatsu is beautiful
ara ara
I'm actually gonna have to watch it anyway. I'm about to finish Hollow Realization and then next game is AW vs SAO
I honestly don't remember anything. I knew they were from the same author and that they might be connected but nothing else
Oh ok. I really need to watch AW again lol
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I've... reached last chapter of Kaguya-sama...
This week's episode was really boring
I always wondered... is Rebellion the ending or there are some sequel in some kind of way?
Btw you guys knew there are 2 versions of Rebellion. Homura has 2 records of her lines
Madoka wish won't make her happy so...
Hey, I got her before deleting the game. What's the deal with her anyway
I didn't care enough to finish it tho
Watching that scene again. That was a genuine uno reverse card moment

I hope some great people keep working on the translation
I didn't like the game but I was planning to watch the story on YouTube
Did the story finished before NA died?
Why do I think Madoka universe is almost as big as Fate one
I left in like ep 11
Never finished that anime lol
> i'm one of those rare creatures who was more than fine with the rebellion ending and left the movie quite satisfied
<@!279341087494242304> I'm with you on this one
So... which ending you guys prefer. Madoka anime or Rebellion
You can't unhear it
How cute
Is that an official thing?
WHY I KEEP FOLLOWING THE TOPIC!?
I think Homura was trying to do the best to make Madoka happy
Temporal rupture, yeah
It's even creeper somehow
I mean look at that shit lol
Quantum Break?
> What? You don't automatically trust fluffy aliens who promise you anything you want?
<@!181591926636544002> He was too fluffy
It was so obvious he was planning something the first time I saw it
He was so dense. Insisting on the girls to become mahou shojos so much
Well, I was watching the post credits scene of Rebellion. Eh... I didn't get it. Anyone care to explain their interpretation?
That's sad
I played a valentine's day event
I think I remember something like that
Justbern slept on the keyboard
Knowing that's only an introduction to the game's characters didn't help
F
Cinemas are closed on my country
I can't say I wouldn't do the same if I were her. But I think she did it for Madoka too
She even asked if she would be alright with her own wish and Madoka said something along the lines of she being alone or sad
F for fuck sake
This week's chapter
I mean 201
Any place to read last chapter of Kaguya sama?

Sorry, it was just shadows so I thought it was fine
Ok, I'm starting watching XY and Ep 0 is showing me a lot of events I didn't know. Is all this like a recap or something I will see on this season?
Hey thanks for the summary, I don't really remember much about Pokemon
So it's over huh... Konosuba
> So progressive is getting a anime
<@!202444817043685386> Finally Argo will get some spotlight?


I don't want to hate on any of them. I like both but SAO was one great episode after ther other. Re Zero I watch an ep and say "wait... that's it? I wait 1 week for this and now I have to wait 1 more to see what's next" and it never really gets good for me
I still watch it. I like it but come on. It's way too slow. Subaru tries different things and always ends up the same way. He doesn't even have a clue to move forward from that checkpoint
I can't be the only one who thinks Re Zero is going really slow. Like, I don't see Subaru advancing at all
Wake me up on 6/12
It's $2 here but we're dying haha

SNK3

Anyway the movie was good too
JC I mean
Yeah, they did the movie
Now that you mention
and S2 I think
Deen did S1
S2 was good
> JC Staff sure likes picking up a ton of anime.
<@!262326868366065664> I just wish they picked up Konosuba S3
Oh nevermind. I read the description. It's a game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPKYANVovNU What would this be?
The passing of Re Zero is really making me desperate
Just a random Rem

<@!278860841485598720> Dunno. Never saw a cyclops myself

Oh hey, 3DCG from SNK is back. Remember colossal titan from SNK3?
Well, they could use best girl ||Armin||
Seems like there's only one way

Yeah but this is what most of us expect lol


It was ok
I liked the anime. It wasn't anything special imo
> first time watching Titan?
<@!454822882045067298> It's like the fifth time to say the less lol
God I love this
Armin said the phrase!

I have the books. Now I need the time lol
Berthholdt watching armin ||fuck annie||
Best episode of this season was his first trial imo

I think the development of this season is really slow. Sure, it must be a lot more important but yeah. I think I'll enjoy it more when S2 is completed
First half of S1 concluded 3 conflicts
S2 until now didn't conclude any conflict. I feel like Subaru is almost at the same point where he was at the start, not knowing how to solve this problem
This part was really weak imo
and... we finished part 1 with Subaru getting to nowhere
So I just realized Re Zero went on a break
SNK manga



God I love small details in SNK
This breaks my heart

Erwin looks scary here
I wanna cry
I can live with that

Digimon with more dinosaurs
Yeah, that's the one. Thanks
I used to watch some show that had 3D dragons that people rode on races I think. I don't remember how it was called
I used to watch it
It was Dino Rey here, yeah lol
But they can finish on manga/ln
People are really into Genshin it looks. I stopped playing cuz I got bored

Are the last seasons that bad?
I kinda wanna watch Tokyo Ghoul
Now you have homework

<:umu:605541031731265558>
2 movies
2 OVAs

watch the specials?
you
Did
BUT
Would be weird if you didn't watch Illya spinoff
4
<@!196268149723627520> iirc you didn't watch Illya spinoff
There's more than 1 fullmetal?
I should really watch Fullmetal
I've never watched Fullmetal but SNK is easily one of the best animes I've ever watched... if not the best one

SNK is gonna end. That's all that matters to me lol
I don't really watch too much anime. I'm watching Yashahime only rn
<@!196268149723627520>
SNK4
The waiting for SNK4 is killing me

Nah, you should wait. You'll know in like a month or less
You really should
You should wait to know that
I hope people won't get into psycho mode

<@!196268149723627520> SNK S04E01 is out and is GREAT
Worked fine for me on PC
<@202444817043685386> you should watch the anime anyway. OST, voices and visuals are so good
<@238855496797257729> does it have release date?
Be careful with the spoilers tho
Welp, maybe it's for the better. So you can have more eps to watch
I watched it 3 times already. I loved it. Made me read the manga from that point again
<@202444817043685386> did you watch snk4?

It will look weird tho, with the different style and everything but probably they could do it
Probably, yeah

Does blonde girl ever appear again?
OP I don't like very much
No! No! No! No!
It's pretty good
Yeah
On another subject, I can't stop laughing every time they try to end an episode on a serious tone and that music starts
Makes sense
Oh god
They don't look like kids
lol that's so weird
At the start are like 13?
Phantom blood?
First one
I don't get how old are Jojo and Dio supposed to be
Ok, started watching Jojo. Never thought it was about ||vampires ||lol

I only follow Yashahime and SNK
It is JoJo's *Bizarre* Adventure indeed
My only question now is why does Dio say WRY so much HAHAHAHA
Besides meme, oc
I hope I can get why this is so great
When can I start hearing Jojo Golden Wind
<.<
SNK
P A T H S best invention
SNK best looping



It was at this moment, Inuyasha knew... he fucked up
There are recap movies

Is Demon Slayer getting S2?

Yes
SNK S04E03
What zombie anime again?
Discounted kohaku
I have to keep watching Jojo. SNK spoiler, btw
It's pretty good
Maybe watch it after HF3

Thanks!

Huh, guys where can I find that new FGO ova?

Just a theory tho
There's a theory where|| she'll die at the end||
||Just Mikasa||
Nah
It would be ending at 139, a perfect number
I hope it's true
and I want more moments like that one
I just think he's cool
I've seen none lol
When is it out?
Hmm what?
I need more of this

SNK 136

But sad boar is also fun
Yeah
Sad boar is so good


Higurashi Kagome
They really had to put a flashback episode of the merchant on the second ep of Re Zero S2 part 2 huh


CGI titans look really good imo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvCz4eN8A7U
Only watched the anime, it was good

Pick it up again

You saw nothing
It's actually good
<@!196268149723627520> <@!279115815494877184>

I'm only watching SNK, Re Zero and Yashahime
Oh god
I think it's the first ep I didn't hear any complaint in this season lol
Yesterday's one was great
Who teach you liying is good?
It's really good
Then pick it up again!
Does Re Zero S2 ever gets good?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dpyulDeV_w
I wish SNK had that too
Those were the 2 only eps I really liked
Oh and that part where Subaru does the test and see his parents
I never really thought she was a bad character
Tbh the only part I really enjoyed this season was the ep from Emilia's past
This whole season have been exposition and exposition followed by flashbacks and more exposition
Taking it's sweet time I'd say
It is what it is
But now she can have this (manga spoilers)
And we never heard of her again for like 4 years
I'm pretty sure the story won't end at ep 16
Are you guys up to date with S4?
Honestly, she looks great in each pic there
Obviously, the author
Not my man Isayama
**||*P A T H S*||**
Why would she still be frozen if she wouldn't ever come out. Might as well just kill her back in s1
She had to eventually
I mean

Hate is not the solution

It's still final season. Just... in another season of real life time (?
They need time to animate Eren's titan big ass

I nominate Grisha as best dad
And there was a problem between Xqc and everyone else because he's toxic and I started to dig in
I don't either. I just used to watch PewDiePie and he was playing with both Critical and Xqc
I knew him from Among Us and then I saw him destroying Xqc on chess. It was fun
Also a classic

FGO Camelot movie is on nyaa


So... I just watched Camelot. It was pretty good imo. Don't know why some people are saying it's bad


<@!279115815494877184>
<@!196268149723627520>
The heck is this?
I just said it lol
First costume
Arm too op
I love how Bedi is a third rate knight but ends up beating everyone in that movie
Very heavy clothes I guess lol
She flat on that costume in FGO too
Who is this?

It is good to say the least
I think it's the best CG I saw on an anime
Because SNK took all the stock
i


You're right. I saw that post but since it was in their profile I assumed it was them that posted it. I'm not so used to twitter!
For some reason they deleted the tweet but posted it again with a different text
Then you see Konohamaru with a video camera recorder for Naruto wedding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTzLUvkA29Y

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tczNFH9u0Zg
It's bad but not that bad
It is
You said the n word

Manga looks worlds away from anime lol
I really liked it
I think it'd be good without Ufotable animation tbh
That's why I waited til it was completely done. S2 was a pain for me
Yeah, here are 25 eps
Is this the moment to give S2 a third chance?
Anyone is registered here? I need this plz
https://hikarinoakari.com/zombie-land-saga-live-franchouchou-live-of-the-dead-r/


Glorious moment
God I love how they told Wilhelm story with small fitting flashbacks in the final battle. Not like season 2 spending whole episodes doing so!
I'm hoping to enjoy more S2 now that it's completely done
One of the saddest moments I've ever seen in this anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_R-o16Qkr8

Just watch Kill la Kill and Sangatsu. You won't regret it
Easily my fav ep in S2P1
So part 2 did have an OP... and it completely spoiled me the whole season LOL
THOT
While in emission didn't work at all
Well I'd tell you Re Zero S2 worked all at once for me
Finished Re:Zero S2... I'll admit I enjoyed it a lot more now that I watched all the episodes at once. Definitely not an anime that I'd recommend to watch in emission

That's a reedemable code in some platform. Im sure of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5-uSUZjbpQ
Celtic Hibiki dad
Really nice couple of people you guys are kek
https://tenor.com/view/jojo-anime-yes-yes-yes-yeah-its-a-yes-gif-17161748

I mean today
I'm gonna watch Evangelion for the first time in my life tomorrow

And that automatically makes it my fav pokemon
Still not enough
How could anyone get fatigued of hearing Aoi Yuuki's voice
Might watch it, thanks
What's that?
Yes.
Is this girl his sister now or was she in the other world?
And the demon king side is really good too
I think it was pretty fun to watch
How likely is for Kumoko to have a S2?
I'm just glad|| Astolfo survived ||
I think reading Zero was really worth it btw
*or worth to read at least*
But is it slightly better?
I need more Aoi Yuki in Fate
Yep
also Type Redline
I so want to see that animated
Afaik
The LN translation not
like the new Silent Hill game
Oh I wanted to read the ln to see if it was any better but the project seems to be abandoned
Don't remember much of it tho
I think I did watch it once after Ufotable's version
Did you watch Deen's UBW?
That's all you'll get from me
It was certain famous scene in S2
*tho I did start with Kaleid* ||I had my reasons||
I'd personally start with Zero or UBW
People love to think getting into Fate is complicated when it's really not. You can start pretty much with any series
Anyway as said before, you can't go without spoiling yourself with Fate so I'd say just start wherever you like, as long as you have context about the whole grail war thing
Afair Zero spoils Kirei's condition, Sakura's past, Shirou's survival and Saber's identity and 4th Grail War ending. But I don't really think that really matters because pretty much everyone knows Saber and if not, it's not such a big deal to know her identity imo, Kirei's condition, I never really thought about it until it was important in HF, Sakura's past the same. Shirou and ||Avalon|| the same. 4th Grail War winner is the only major spoiler imo but it isn't really that important for any of the routes. Sure, it's a motivation for Shirou to continue but other than that, it was never talked about again. If anything I think SN spoiling the 4th Grail War is worse than any of the other spoilers. You're basically spoiling yourself the whole Zero plot
Yes because the remake is not translated
I don't think that's such a big deal to be spoiled
The ||worms thing||?
Because of ||Kirei's heart||?
Well yeah, it's a prequel. I don't think it damages that much SN know the things Zero spoils
Makes sense, thanks
Also didn't think ||killing Zouken would help undo the damage the worms caused to her body||
Always thought, ||since the grail is corrupted, it wouldn't work for other things than to kill ||
With the grail?
But what about she|| dying because of worms||?
Also I don't remember well, but what happened with Sakura condition at the end of HF?
Ok that makes sense... but then again, why|| Zouken|| didn't make a move in the other routes?
Can somebody explain me why 
1) ||True Assassin only appears on HF||
2) ||Gilgamesh is killed so easily by Sakura|| (honestly why some characters are so strong in X route but are so weak in Y route)
I just love Kirei laughing inside while waiting for Rin to know who killed the scumbag of her father kek
I was wondering what you guys meant by 06, it just clicked now lol
Same
Yeah, I meant the climax. Which is imo more important than the things Zero spoils about SN
Yeah. That's exactly what happened to me. And apparently is what happened with a lot of people who did the same
Yeah, thats why I forgive the meme creator and laugh about it
*I'd rather have a conection with the world and the characters and know their relationships and context from the start than going with no knowledge and getting surprised by what would seem like stupid asspulls like "I'm the big sister" or "I killed your dad" or "you're alive because of Avalon"*
So it is 2 cours in the end. You guys lied to me
Well last time I checked the wiki it said something like she's the niece or something like that. I don't remember
Apparently some Rin descendant who looks, sounds and acts like OG Rin but she's blonde
Except she's not Rin but *Rin*
*~~and the fanservice oc~~*
I honestly just liked the Alice arc
Seriously what was the point of this character?
Ah yes, that one series that probably could've used 1 more cour, but instead even with just one cour, they added a new character that did absolutely nothing, never appears again and dies offscreen, we learn that in a Drama CD too
So... Fate Route by Ufotable when?
Okita is Kohaku
Yes
||*Because Yuuki is still alive*||
Best SAO timeline is gamesverse
Oh I thought I was the weird one, thinking S2 felt like a filler season
Alan seiyuu got banned for NTRing LiSA
Deku almost turned into Kacchan

I think the only thing that really got a development was Geordo and Katarina's relationship, kinda
Got bored
I kinda dropped it like in ep 5 or 6, I don't remember
They literally used the same idea of Katarina's friends being trapped in that dream world twice

Oh I like that
*I'm gonna regret watching this right*
What's with that~~ 8~~9
But what is the premise. I know is about killer girls
Oh no. *Other works?*
Is it worth to watch all this just for a youtube video of a girl beating the shit out of a bully with a chair? ||Y E S||
Found this one. Guess is the complete collection?
Oh god, it's Fate all over again
*So where do I start*
Alright, finished BNHA S5. Time to read the manga
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp5V7fmuvGA

B-but you said that yesterday, you jerk. No wonder they'll try to kill you later on
I don't know man, she kinda sus
Oh I like how they mixed the ED with the Preview
Finished ep 1. It was alright. A good amount of humour and suspense
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
*That's not the issue here*
So many spoilers tag I definitely won't read
*Alright, up to a great start*
Alright, let's get into this rabbit hole
*SNK is not trash tho*
Oh boy you're in trouble
I watched 13 episodes yesterday and I have so many questions. Hope I'll get some answers eventually but I'm really loving this
OH COME ON. DON'T LOOP ME NOW. I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS
*I'm so confused right now*
The phone call with "Shion" was scary af
Why is every girl crazy in this anime. They act normal but then they suddenly snap for a few seconds and then they go back to normal. It's so weird! <:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
https://tenor.com/view/izuku-midoriya-midoriya-new-power-anime-my-hero-academia-gif-21807453
Nah bro. That's Deku
That's Deku obviously
*This twins thing really complicates everything!*
Wait... *but what if... he was actually with Mion instead of Shion and now she knows he's a liar*
*Here we go again*
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
*So they did that and now they're gonna act like nothing happened*
*And why do they have weird eyes when they go all psycho*
What's wrong with these girls!?
Satoshi be like "Sorry I acted weird even tho you beated the shit out of my defenseless little sister"
Wow, ||Shio's ||really dropping in the liking department
I've been wondering for a while. Is that a gun she's carrying?
Ah yes, sweet sisters love
This one
2006 I think?
*Am I supposed to still be confused at the end of Higurashi 2006?*
She's good. *Makes me wonder if she's not the fifth aggressor of the first victim*
https://tenor.com/view/pew-die-pie-hmm-yes-gif-13081913

Ok, so summary

First timeline: ||Girls crazy for some reason, they don't want MC to know what's going on, Shion is no where to be found, detective is nice, Rena and Mion are crazy af, MC gets paranoid (with good reasons) and ends up killing them both. Then he kills himself saying something is onto him.||

Second timeline: ||Shion appears. Mion gets jealous, Shion remembers Satoshi, went crazy, fights Rika, she kills herself, Shion pretends to be Mion and kidnap and kill Satoko (who lives with Rika), jails real Mion and eventually kills her, tries to kill MC and *for some reason I don't understand she appears in the hospital like a ghost and finish the job. But at the same time she can't be there because she's too busy dying from a fall.||

Third timeline: ||MC is totally focused in save Satoko who's abused by her uncle *with whom she lives in this timeline for some reason* and apparently kills him... but it turns out he's apparently still alive and MC couldn't have killed him because he apparently was at the festival... but that can't be right because we saw it... unless we saw it from his POV and he had really gone mad... or there's a copy of him that went at the festival. Anyway, in this timeline Rika's body is found, Satoko thinks MC killed her and pushes him to the river. While falling MC wishes the whole village to die and then, everyone but him dies because of some volcanic gas or something.||
*And why is Satoshi so similar to MC*
https://tenor.com/view/simpsons-homer-3d-dimension-falling-gif-18243159
That's what I said in first case
Ciao
Lit
*Some even don't appear in some*
But is weird since characters act so different in each one
I'm confused.... I can see at least 3 timelines in this anime
Who, me?
https://tenor.com/view/boku-no-hero-academia-endeavor-shouto-anime-gif-9406281

Weird detail to add
Yeah I just saw it|| *when Shion falls*||
*I really hate Shion*
*There were even hopes at this point?*
There's a current airing season or the last one already finished?
Yeah I just read that in the watch order you guys gave me last time
Yes
Well I don't complain.
UNCENSORED. I DEMAND UNCENSORED
<@!205859030051061769> WTF
That link sent me here
Ew
Is she the most detestable character, Shion? or the great Mion?
I love how her voice changes  when she's serious, it's so funny lol
*hen*
<@!205859030051061769> *is this hen?*
Yes, yes. *Yojo Senki*
https://tenor.com/view/tanya-gif-19959621
*Yojo Senki you say?*
I was worried
*Is this Ochako's mom?*
Why not. It's really good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5BJVO3PDeQ&t=417s
Feel the moon?
||*What's wrong with japanese people*||
||*They're dead aren't they?*||
WTF
Wha
Wait <@!205859030051061769> how did we get here!?
We are in the correct timeline
You watched an isekai (?)
See, that's te problem
For academic purposes
I'll have to watch it
I don't know what you mean
*You mean it's ~~better ~~worse than this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMl3t0grrRA
<@!196268149723627520> they're talking to you
Ironically Fate Kaleid is the less dark magical girl anime I've ever seen
Hmmm last time the only survivor was ||Keiichi||. Now it's ||Satoko||. I wonder if it has something to do with|| the river they fell into||
Higurashi S1 is like the longest introduction ever. Kai is way better
So... is it voiced? the VN I mean
I'm gonna cry
That's how it ends? Then I'm good to go right? *right?*
Figured
That can't end well
Well what's Umineko about
Maybe that's why Higurashi is good. Has 26 + 24 eps
Why are them so rare then (?
*Why VN based anime adaptations are so shit*
*Can't I just get that with the anime?*
Im just in Kai. I'll cross that bridge when I get there lol
Its fate route all over again
I mean umineko
Whats like a spinoff?
I dont think so?
Now the good ending might be possible
Finally things started to look different
This last chapter was my fav one
Well I'm at 13/24 of Kai
Yep, just like in SNK hating the children for their parent's "sins"
The misunderstanding was justified kek
Well she was ||beating the shit out of a little girl with a chair even before Satoshi went missing ||tho
I do
Oh... so it was all a ||disease|| that make|| people paranoid||... well. It makes sense. Guess I judged Shion too early
Please, how big is this universe?
Wait, Umineko and 7th expansion aren't the same thing
I'm sure it has something perverse hidden somewhere
Yes, keep sending spoilers so I can avoid read
Forget Umineko, I wanna watch that
Welp, thanks. I'll download it later
They really did that?
Got it, read Umineko after Kai
Er... so this is the definitive experience, fully translated and voiced ported to PC?
*But would you say it's worse than the non existent Tsukihime anime?*
So it's fully translated?
B-but I mean. Emulators are a thing
Then why would I play the PC version
The PS being the one non translated I imagine
But mostly no I guess
Looks like a cartoon over a crayon draw
The contrast is way too much tho
Wait, mouth animations? That's neat
Yeah I kinda prefer PS3
And this is Steam right?
This is PS3
it's like everyone is horizontally stretched
Wish OG Tsukihime was voiced
Voices makes it more enjoyable
Ohhh nice. Thanks
PS3 you mean?
It's *shit*
Look at this shit
And one is ugly af
<@!205859030051061769> give me the definitive edition of Higurashi. I know there are at least 2
But this one isn't voiced right?
Ok then
So... Another question. Am I missing much if I don't read Higurashi VN just yet. Like, I wanna read it but I'd rather read something new before that like Umineko
I don't know if I should click that
Well I mean, I'm interested in Higurashi
So I should read Umineko regardless, not even think about Higurashi while I do so
But you guys told me I had to read Umineko to understand new higu
Wait what
So you don't have to read one to understand another but they complement each other much like with Nasurverse
*So there's a third one*
I was starting to freak out
Rika... not, that's not right...
wtf
"MY FINGER MY FINGER MY FINGER"
The over the top screams and maniacal laughs in Higurashi are killing me
The audacity
That was a real risk, imo. Making a story that most won't understand until they wait and have faith in the second season
If I wasn't interested at all in the characters and the mystery I would've dropped it
First season of Higurashi is way too many questions and almost no answers
or are anime onlies upset too
Are these upset people VN readers?
Basically saying it's shit, got it
Man SNK collab was so lame. Mikasa didn't even get a gear
Best pick for Mion
You guys just convinced me to do so!
or was I guess
What's that?
Yeah, PS3 > Steam
Ohhh
So we have OG version, PS3 remaster, Steam remaster and Pachinko?
Wait wait wait, I just read you said pachinko <@!205859030051061769> explain
I wish I were a manhwa character
She hot
So wait
Actually, she could give testimony of the atrocities inside
Dunno, Takano was pretty messed up when grandpa came for her. Couldn't they do something about it
B-but. They can't keep getting away with it. Why are governments and protection entities so useless!
How were they allowed to do all that to those kids anyway, did I miss something?
||f||
<@!205859030051061769> Did... did Takano friends got spirited away from this anime?
I still don't like her
Strike me down, Zeus. You don't have the bal-
I mean, you can never go wrong with Kirby right?
*Kirby has an anime?*
I get what you're saying btw. I feel sorry for what happened to her but she picked the wrong hous- path
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Well I hope she dies
Yeah but the thing is she's willing to kill innocent people for a personal grudge and to prove something with nothing good in the end
Oh god, I didn't even started sotsu and I'm scared now
Like, I can't even empathise with her since her motivation is so dumb
Knowing her backstory only made me think she's worse than I actually thought she was in S1
Well the society that rejected his investigation is shit but she still doesn't have the right to ruin so many lives kek
*I still don't like her*. She's|| killing a lot of people to make a name of herself||
It's really weird. I mean, Takano should be able to declare what the people at the orphanage did to them. She should be able to say there are other kids there being abused. If they're alive they should be able to declare as well. If they're dead or suddenly disappeared it would be weird af
Not even in the vn?
Ok, time to finish Kai
Well they did with Fate right? (?)
To make people invest time and then make them read the VN (?)
The teacher with the knife lol
Remember Another?
I like lore
Is that the one with gore?
World's end harem is not, that's for sure
Why it got delayed. Redo got away with way worse
Alright you made me want to watch that. Hope you're happy
Not out yet kek
That's P2
Oh no
*get it*
I don't know Lank, I don't think you have the pants
I wonder what would you think of SNK S4 (?)
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I need to watch that btw
https://tenor.com/view/it-is-what-it-is-it-is-eet-eet-iz-iz-gif-17896182
But as a matter of my own principles I'm gonna have to track your location and kill your first born now
Well, you're right there
I take you don't like The Simpsons either
*You're not suppose to not think about it. You're supposed to enjoy as what it is. A comedy idol anime*
*you also have a problem with the va?!?!*
Dont talk shit about Kotaro
Ban
Be careful on what you're about to say
Wtf. Zombieland Saga?
Ok today for real, time to finish Higurashi Kai
*But he didnt care about that*
You know Paradis is not just the walls right?
Well maybe he couldnt make the walls that big?
Why walls? Well, because Marley is sending titans to that island. How else would they survive
That's why when the warriors attacked nothing really happened with the walls
Ok, the thing about the walls is that King Fritz ||wanted to create a little place where they could die in peace. He said "If they want to attack us we will die because of our sins" and that's why every person with royal blood and the founding titan can't oppose his will||
Thats an spoiler
Sorry
Actually
He wanted to create a mini World inside the walls
Lanks, the thing about titans is that is just a threat. And the walls are to make it more believable. The king didnt want to fight. He just wanted to live in peace
And I'll be mad for no reasons
I thought it was pointless
Why if I can kill a guy I hate so much with a granade instead of a pistol I would kek
But it can still do the job kek
You mean why there are titans outside the walls?
I failed to see the problem?
Well they're there as a threat against they world if the fuck with Paradis
Are you talking about the titans around the walls or the titans *in* the walls
Hmmm
Wait
Well SNK has Sasha
S1 to S3 is basically know the truth and your enemies. The best part about S4 is trying to guess what's Eren thinking
But those things never stopped me from enjoying the story because the mystery is really interesting and well made imo
Like, if the warriors asked for help to Paradis, they could've fight Marley
Like I know a lot of things could have gone better if people stopped to think
Could you be more precise about what you mean? Like examples or something
You mean because they're causing so many problems about some conflicts they didnt even lived?
Well humans are stupid above all kek
How so?
Lots of people in internet saying stuff like that. Nobody explained precisely why yet but yeah, a pretty common opinion
I personally think that, aside from some first eps being rushed out, MAPPA did a pretty good job
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
Shame on you for not informing yourself
Actually mid game (?)
I mean we know that since what, 2014?
no (?)
Errr
Indeed
Well then you might be right kek
I didn't like Evangelion
I don't know about that
Look, if you think SNK is stupid and incoherent I won't try to change your mind. I just came from work, didn't enjoy my dinner and I don't think it's worth it. I personally think it's a pretty good story with pretty good characters, mystery and plot twists. If you don't think the same well, it is what it is
That was a joke btw
I think you're nitpicking and biased, I win bye bye
Dude, I don't know how to tell this to you anymore. He's chillin in their retirement of life
I mean, it is for the eldians that were with him
How so. He's waiting for them to die. If they attack, and they did, they surrender. But aside that, they're literally not doing anything to affect the outside world
To his eyes, them dying is improving the world. He thinks they're the culprits of the world suffering
That's his only goal with the walls


Yeah he bluffin
Well first of all, he wasn't living alone. He went with a lot of eldians to the island, made the walls to protect them from the titans and to use it as a threat to avoid the outside world to attack them while they live inside
How is that peaceful
Wtf
To not get eaten by the titans
Fritz is dead
Who is defending
That's Fritz will
It was a place to die at peace to begin with. They wont resist if Marley wants revenge for the past. The threat is to minimize the risk
Paradis was never a forever sustainable place. It was never the idea
apparently
Lose money
This girl is the first person that has that high class laugh that's actually enjoyable
Mion best character
Alicization is the best
The rest is meh
Mother's Rosario too
GGO I liked it
Like Aincrad arc was... Fine
Is not even the whole seasons
S1 and 2 are the problem kek
S3 was good
Bad bad
Ahh serious. I see you got triggered
What's next
Jk. I like it
What a piece of sh-
<@205859030051061769> finished Kai
Then wtf
No. They fight
I give my life so my friends surrender and you spare their lives
Nero
In S3
Cardinal I mean
Why the hell did she die anyway
Like Cardinal
Like Eugeo
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Pls
Make Yuuki fate in game canon
Also Mikasa seiyuu
Philia is best grill indeed
I bought it but never finished Hollow Realization DLC... So I never played it
You mean the game or the anime with the game inside
Sao is pretty shitable and I love SAO
Just fanservice
Sure, the characters and the technology appear later on but nothing big
The movie doesnt affect the story at all
Takano didnt get a tragic ending
I really really dislike
Also
Scene way too good
But why nobody shoots the cop when fighting the bad guys, Im gonna ignore that kek
Yes. Besides what the hell is Hannyu, yeah
Yeah well. Takano didn't deserve to be saved. Not in that World at least
SVTFOE was great
I hate you so much
Can't stop watching this
Is Grand Carnival S2 still not subbed?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Or you telling me they made floor 5 before 2-4
*But why*
Wait. Why not making it in order?
Would've been better to adapt more into a series
That's a shame tho
Well yeah since its just a movie
Wait what's new with SAO? Other than the movie
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
Probably a character creator
Someone told me character creators should have the right to punish fanarts creators who make draws of their characters without their consent, punished as in being sued or going to jail. Imaging going to jail for drawing a character you like so much
Actually I remember a few things about it
and something about electricity
Oh and big bugs
Oh hey, it's that one movie with the girl who had sex with the other girl because she wanted to be protected by her... or the other girl that had sex with the alpha male in the group. Yeah, that's all I remember about it kek
Why!? The anime is exactly the same but with extra content lol
One of my fav scenes in the movie of Kimetsu
As all things should be

I just did
Yes you were lol
I think I saw somebody saying the same thing a few months ago, probably you?
Ah yes, cant wait for people who hated Gabi and now loved Gabi|| hate her|| even more in a few days
Is like with TLOU2 but more realistic
I see no problem with this
Had to stop at first 30 minutes
The 2 after that are meh... and the spinoff that just came out was... ew
the first trilogy is gold
Well then that's good then. I'll pick it up later on
I mean, I stopped watching in season 1 since I was pretty sure I will never see the ending
So... does it really ends the story?
Will adapt chapters 131-139+extra pages+OG ending ~~+ Eren x Historia sex scene~~
Shingeki No Kyojin The Final Season Part 3: This Time For Real
Lol obviously
Magia Record managed to get 3 seasons?
I mean, part 1 was 16 episodes. They could've just done a 16-20 episodes part 2
Part 2 should've been delayed and longer
~~*unless AOE*~~
Well they can't do that much longer anyway lol

As a reward, we shall give them our seed
What a studio they are
Wait so they released the whole "season 3" at once?
It can gets much worse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAXKd8Z6X5g
She got a date with president
Who cares. Konosuba is back baby

*Suddenly nobody likes Konosuba*
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
DONT TALK SHIT ABOUT KONOSUBA

I'll watch it back home
I'm talking about S1 to 3
Didn't watch S4
And it seems story is getting better as visuals get worse
Always
Anything in there is hardly relevant
Movie doesn't matter tho
Yay I still haven't watched her spinoff tho!
CR uploaded Kaguya ep 12... and it was 25 min... and for a sec I was worried.. but then I saw ep 13 and I breathed again

"dad, how did you meet mom"
"well..."
When was the last we heard about Extra remake tho
I remember him being pretty boring
Oh... Progressive movie was released. Maybe I'll watch it tonight

*C o o o l*
Ohhhhhhh so that's Asuna's hair style story... yeah. She's not canon is she. I don't remember her from the manga
This movie is definitely not sponsored by Tekken
That's Kirito with a different hair style
Amogus Original Ending confirmed

I need S2 of Finest Assassin rn
Allows me to read Finest Assassin heh
And thatnovelcorner. Love you guys
Thank you Argentina
With taxes and all
Almost 50 usd a vol here
Sadly I dont think there are ln in my country. Not in spanish at least. Imported books are way too expensive too so I cant really afford them. I'd have to keep using thatnovelcorner kekw
I really liked s1
Welp. Hope we get a season soon
Yet they made a movie of vol 6
But... Why would they stop because of the hiatus and make a movie of vol 6 if we still had vol 3-5 back then
So we have material for at least 2 seasons
Glad I never went to read those then. The wait would be painful..
Wait...
You're telling me there's a chance we get S2 now?
Wow
Story isnt finished yet
*Sadder is No Game No Life didnt get a S2*
Sad the anime didnt get a S2
I shall read that eventually

You speak spanish
Oho
Can't blame you
Can't get the "maa kun" out of my head now, thanks
Close enough
I can barely believe that is a real concept
I can't believe this is getting an anime adaptation
I love this pic



Nice. I was just replaying it. Starting Route C
That crazy bitch

Coming, april 2023 I think
I love the friendship of those two

/s
James who
Best trans character ever
Here hoping for MAPPA to animate Fire Punch right after Chainsaw Man
First skeptical, then doubt, then love

Why it takes so long for Chainsaw Man 113 to come out!?
I still cant believe Bleach got a continuation after so many years
Never heard of them
Starting? I'm pretty sure you're the same person complaining about it like a year ago kekw
Why is the horse called Juan
*I don't know if you guys call that "chop" but that's what it actually means*

Suletta needs a chop
I don't get the one in spanish and I speak spanish lol
Okita?
wait what
Also the animation and music were great
I think it was great for knowing the characters better, and also how things ended the way they did
God Eater, anime adaptation was great but it ended like halfway the story.

Chainsaw Man S2, which will probably happen but just in case

Fire Punch. I really need this (but also probably gonna happen)

Fate route by ufotable

No Game No Life S2... Like I mean, come on. Release it already

You're definitely right about that!
Thank you, Yoko Taro

This some FGO LB 5 bs
lol no way they're cutting Shingeki no Kyojin The Final Season Part 3.... in 2 parts LMAO
Not from me since I disagree


Being Reiner is suffering
I really love this sequence
SNK The Final Season Part 3 *Part 1* (lol) spoilers
