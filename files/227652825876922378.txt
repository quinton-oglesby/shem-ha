something that's been on my mind is how newcomers sometimes post things at inopportune times in the fancontent channel. specifically, when someone pings community anthology shortly after another work has been posted. there's an 'unspoken rule' that you give the channel at least a few hours or more to discuss whenever a work is posted, but I think it would be really good to have that in writing somewhere
that or you're not complimentary üòè
sorry <@!205859030051061769> you have been demoted from snack status

obviously wholesome tickle fight
I thought it was more like the face she makes when she found out shirabe's been planning this for the past 6 months

But that may just be recency bias on my part
This convo just became suddenly very reminiscent of pratchett's discworld
> No idea what's happening <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
iirc for that one, they got sorted into two rooms based on the results of a linker test or some such? and they weren't told anything about their results, so this is their reaction based on who's in the room with them
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Ok I'm sure I'll be back to recharge soon
Tea time is good time
[**yes**]
Ok I must get back to my labors now I hope to see more good content when I return üôè

miku is such a good girl
Learning is never convenient <:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376> but it is still good
hello
sorry to interrupt
kinda exhausted <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313> 
may I request someone post something fluffy
~~plus I spend too much time on discord as is~~
I just was particularly tired today so it was good for me
I will say not yet
>inhales ur dmjii content
the colorswapped water guns on the dmjii pool pic gives me life
thank god for dmjii
ah
<@471416654346321930> that was great, thanks for posting that
But yes to each their own
Tsubasa and Chris is cute I will admit, but I feel like basa and maria have so much more potential for mature and complex development
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I kind of rotate on which ship I set sail on every few weeks or so
I've been really loving the maria x basa vibes lately... that breakfast tweet is üëå for my brain
amen
very neat

strong immune system means your body *may* take care of the virus before it proliferates through your system sufficiently to be infectious
which maybe isn't comforting, but recognizing and accepting that can be a lot less painful than torturing yourself trying to change who you are
but I'd also say don't feel the need to try and 'fix' things with yourself... sometimes it just be that way
well I'm glad to hear you have support there at least
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
therapy good
have you talked to anyone about it, or is there anyone who you could talk to about it?
but this sounds like anxiety to me
disclaimer I am *not* a therapist or mental health specialist
at risk of additional rant I'm just gonna say please don't be silent about your experiences, good or bad. your pain is real, and your joy is real, all your feelings are real, but when you need to share there's a time and a place. and as far as I can tell, there is no time restriction on this place
this channel has an explicit agreement that if you come here there may be bad times ahead. being able to make that choice lets me consent to that, which makes it better for everyone
anyways I've played emotional paramedic enough that I can't help but want to add to the conversation here. I think, lectric, that wanting to talk to people about your feelings is a perfectly normal desire which is regularly put down by societal standards (depending on your society, I'm speaking to my own experiences) because being a good listener is *hard*. it takes a lot of emotional energy to listen to someone have a bad time, because humans are compassionate by nature. that being said, it is not *illegal* to talk about your feelings, especially the shitty ones. it just needs to be consensual
haha don't feel bad, I knew exactly what happened as soon as it went away
üòÇ that timing was terrible
I don't have answers, just inconvenient information <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
One highlight: "The review  conducted  ... also   suggests   that   common   non-curricular  policing  strategies  have  no  overall  effects  on  measures  of  crime  or   discipline   in   schools."
disclaimer, this is published by a corporate entity which may have a conflict of interest I'm not aware of
here's a short review article which gives a brief introduction to the effects of law enforcements on schools: 
https://www.wested.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JPRC-Police-Schools-Brief.pdf
for example, if a student was suffering from a case of anxiety, seasonal depression, or something more rare like schizophrenia, those will all show up on a psych eval (usually) but are not necessarily correlated with 'being a shooter'
again, from what I understand the profile of "school shooter" is not easily defined and a psych evaluation doesn't necessarily hit everyone easily
because it's such an outlier in both these respects, it makes them similar to earthquakes: difficult to predict, and potentially devastating in places they aren't expected to happen
I'm no expert on the matter but my understanding is that "school shooters" is a phenomenon that is 1) not well understood 2) actually a lot less frequent than you might think
panic buttons are not a bad measure however, and having onsite police can increase school safety
(at least in america)
then black kids would get even *more* police harassment in the place they're supposed to be safe and learn about the world <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
(anyways could have gone a lot worse so i aint mad)
yeah I was practicing a chest harness and she was like "that sure is close to your throat" (it was not)
but yeah mom was just like "üëÄ uhh dont choke yourself sorrybye"
it's been a lot of fun so far, and I've only got myself <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but she was also way more embarrassed than I was ü§£
fortunately she was pretty cool about it
she now agrees that we should have locks on all the bedroom doors
my mom just walked in on me practicing shibari in my room üòÖ
your self awareness of it however betrays maturity <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
and they were cool with it and I think our relationship is better because of it
I have a similar situation with a friend who messages me a lot (and I think they also maybe have an unrequited crush on me üò∞) but I was like 'look you gotta be ok with me just not responding sometimes cause I'm glad you like me but this is a lot'
good fences make good neighbors and the same is true in regards to boundaries in relationships
it's true <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
being grounded in the present is a difficult thing to master
<:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
you're fine, I'm better motivated when I know people are interested in my writing unfortunately
Linking from <#357682999300718592>  tl;dr something unfortunate happened and I overreacted by drowning myself in visual novels and alcohol, and have done nothing productive recently
and while you're entitled to bad times... don't beat yourself up too much. these things happen, unfortunately
I've never enjoyed "I spy" or other 'searching/finding' type games and that extends to data recovery too
I'm also trying to recover some data... in my case it's deleted text messages from 7 months ago, because it looks like I'll need them as evidence in a case my ex wants to bring up
data recovery is a bad time
hope it gets better
