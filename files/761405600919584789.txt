Hey, its that guy who can basically get Fudo if he learns about what this bastard did
Joseph would just Nigerundayo while Maria is chasing him but little did she know is that he actually had a plan
Ah yes, that one, those proportions are weird

Aight this cafe probably had a weeb among the workers
A magical girl and a typical fantasy protagonist
I can hear Heat Haze Shadow just from looking at his face
Is that from Tamers?
*insert Spider-Man 60s intro*
Sadly there is no pop filter in my phone and I have no mic but I do have one attached to my headphones.
But I only used the recorder app which is my problem
My very first voice acting
Because it might fall of easily
This is good, but have you ever use a toothpick to hold on the joints?
That is...too much
That anatomy looks better tbh
I cant help but to imagine if a W figure is standing next to the Zababa duo
Does your dad help out sometimes when building a Gunpla?
Just a sketch in my notebook
Just a sketch when I'm bored in class
About to reply that because that's a well known gun used by Bond
Decided to move my VA short here instead of fancontent

Anyway, here's my second voice acting
I have to be honest, I always see the gauntlets as Hibiki's gauntlets
**NEVER**
Fried Rice?
What is that?
Then he just- *gets shot*
Are you also making a Death Star model?

Merry Christmas!

Here's the dessert I made!
I even have to use my teeth when nails aren't enough...
Everything is so hard

One small fuck up and you will have to fix the entire thing, BUT this means that you have to remove the piece one by one, which is very, VERY difficult.
I can hear that image
Yeah, I will try it again
Can it transform?
You really got some good improvisation here.
Saber Alter's hand?
Well knowing Makima, yeah I cant describe how much of a freak she is...
A certain Zenitsu cosplayer might panic if he sees you
But seeing her makes me remember that
Just remembered what sop mod ii did in the gfl anime op
Grown up couple

That's probably the result of being the new queen
Why did they look like they were playing Red Light, Green Light?
Release the Spyce?
And more development for the other girls
Or make it 20+ eps if they had a huge budget for the studio.
"KAZUMAAAA, MAKE A COSPLAY FOR ME"
"No."
Sopmod cutie
Is that from River City Girls?

The Trio of Aois
Just have Lancer and let Hibiki punch him all the way through and have the Fate witnesses say "LANCER GA SHINDA"

Bikki bout to moonwalk
Minus Shemmy tho
This is will be a better XV cover than what we got tho
Two fate variants
Gungnir Psycho 100
*Is that a Bikki mousepad?*
That reminds me of one Mafia AU prompt starring Maria and Kanade
Looks like Hibiki got infected with a symbiote
Imagine this will be the DVD cover for all the seasons
*remembers the Kirika isekai prompt when you mention landlord Chris*
*Punches Hibiki into oblivion*
I mean they did share the same VA so it made sense for Darkness to wear that suit....


||Hope Kirika doesnt see her true nature||
||Can somebody have Kanade in a Zack Fair's death situation and the aftermath rn?||
POV: You're Touma and you mistaken Carol as Misaka
And I go with the Kanade galaxy suit design
The artist just woke up and goes insane when making this sht
I could imagine the staff be like:

"Sir, we reach *that* scene. What should we do?"

*cracks knuckles* "My time has come."
"CUT TO THE CHASE!" Best lyric ever in this ep
Yall are cool if you know the reference
<:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
Shishio! What is that movie?!

I-I think I played the wrong movie!
This is damn cute ngl
She's my main inspiration to draw anime tbh
I watched her vids and checked her twitter long enough to recognize her artstyle
This is the first time i saw Emirichu in this channel
*checks the artist*

That mf
Need...more of them...

Anyway, art posting time~
Tomosato art is very rare tbh
Kanade bout to make the mother of all omeletes
I love how they put Delicious Party in this fanart

And this is why I decided to add shotguns in her arsenal in my fanfic, because why not?
How Hibiki was worthy with the hammer?
Oh right, I almost forgot
A crossover we never asked but we deeply appreciate

Oh yeah, since its Ryu, boy this man is gonna get a ton of fantasies
That makes sense because Shirabe also had the same hairstyle as Nanoha's
*Remembers what Gadget had done*
3_skip Combine the LycoReco art below, you get this
Carol looks like she is suffering fron allergies
When I see Nep, I hear Nep
FUK NO, NOT THAT
I wanna see Nanoha in that outfit
Vanessa as Ash Williams and Elsa as Naruto
You won't see Nanoha's classmates as much as the Beef Stroganoff trio hence why I said that.
Arisa Bunnings, one of the side characters that unfortunately got the "Stroganettes" treatment after A's.
YOOOO
Blonde Maria
Eggwaifu
Poor Maya can't catch a break whenever she sees crime
Oh hey, its the unlucky witness
Let me know if this comic got translated, Im curious as to what Aoi said to the character she voiced.
This is beautiful....

I wanna see each of them up close
At least its not worse than her poop dessert
https://twitter.com/LYCO_RECO/status/1602544506406309889?t=XnKu1XtmtVPJFrJGmX_weA&s=19
Im looking on that Bocchi x Chainsaw Man fanart where Bocchi became a Devil.
Artist finishing fanart when the official designs come out, as if they're on a speedrun.
"What the Bocchi doing?"
I dont think that would happen tho since it was destroyed alongside Fine
Im just wondering what happened to them since we never got to know more about the parents.
Where is the father?

Oh right, he went to buy milk
Speaking of Maria...
Im trying to do my research for the sake of my fic
Give me the American stereotypes that is very common to many
Ill just ask this question here just in case if this is something serious
That explains why i got two pings in this server
2020s was the year where many people we know died
Both men died at the same week
Judging from <#371105434771390465>
So there are chances many shows from Japan will be cancelled or delayed due to Abe's assassination.
Fck off, we manga readers know it
Also WatchMojo thinks that will Eren activate the Rumbling
Hahahahaha you anime only fools, the opening already spoiled you from the beginning.
Welp the new AOT op title is The Rumbling
Imma try writing a SG crossover fanfic about it when i finished the series itself
Boi the visuals were just *chef's kiss*
Welp as a DR fan, i tried to watch this
Wtf Jin
Blazblue abridge
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Did you say Yumi?
This is the perfect place for Kanade ngl
Just sayin
Episode 2 may appreciate the male protag bc he does something that none of us weebs can
I have read the manga
This girl views her as Paimon even though she's the one who isekaid her
Finally she wont do her usual shenanigans like she used to be
Im gonna continue at the ep ||where the gang faces off a strong enemy then the big lady who was voiced by fate's mother (fck her, i hate her since then)||
Wish me luck boys
Gotta catch up with TroPiPrecure before moving on
We got shonen animes that had gone on a dark path
Just gonna wait till MHA s6
First the author delayed the new volume then the anime delayed too
Isnt the second part delayed to march?
Tropical Rouge may have go back to basics but its straight up dark in the finale
I will only came for his anime season in a nutshell
Tropical Rouge Precure's final part was getting dark because ||theres a literal genocide and go as far as to turn one of the villains into a monster||
Toei being toei
What site did you order anyway?
Fairy Tail author had to work his sht out of Eden's Zero and FT 100 year quest
Boi idk if author san can handle both ongoing mangas
Welp if they fill the plotholes then ill watch it
In the movie, she met them in the sky while in the original, she met them inside her bedroom
Little details like Hayate meeting the Knights
And the ending, eh still the same, minus the fact that its timeskip and the aces are not grown ups yet
||I GOT SCAMMED THREE FCKING TIMES||
||GIVE LINDY A PROPER FIGHT DAMMIT||
HOWEVER, ONE THING I HAD PROBLEMS WITH IS
Anyway, its an improved version and i still gonna see nips again in Nanoha and Fate's transformation.  Fight scenes were the same as the first, but i like the final fight the most.
This had a bigger changes in the movie than the previous one, ||first is Fate was transferred to Earth along with the Harlaown family way early (if i remember correctly). And Hayate had to fend off by herself (in the original, she had a guardian) which i find it kinda acceptable to make some impact||
Now for my thoughts in 2nd Movie, As
||Poor Alicia||
We did see her mom's final thoughts tho
I had compared this to the original
Share my thoughts
I should say that it is much better than the original so i gave it 9/10
But i had some questions regarding showing nips in her transformation (who tf did this anyway?)
Fight scenes are much better and Nanoha's costume now fits her theme (the ribbon concerned me tho). Her device was much detailed compared to the og ver
They managed to improve the quality to give me some 2010s vibes. Though there are major changes like ||Momma Testarossa's thoughts before falling down||
Ok i should put my thoughts in Nanoha Movie the 1st
Its similar to Tomo's case
After reading the previous msgs, we got a person using Fate Testarossa's pfp and name but never watched the series itself
||Being alone while in a wheelchair is depressing||
||Im fine with that since it can make more impact to Hayate's character||
||Its Graham i talked about||
Yes
Welp if you watch the movie As, there are major parts that are removed/changed
Aight time to finish the lackluster Tropical Rouge Precure
Lindy Supremacy
For me is Zombieland Saga, I woke up, download the episode and watch the thing before I got spoiled by the internet
||The op says it all tho||
Bc all i saw in this page are female figures
And all waifus?
Realist Hero: Pocket Edition
Embrace the beauty and horny mah man
Spoiler alert in the manga: Ryuko ran away from the boxer guy in a Joestar way
Me and the boys when we got third partied.
Poor Senketsu, he got "tortured"
||And Satsuki had a sister||
She did something that will be shown in the future eps
Much worse than Fine
Just your typical strong guy disguised as a ordinary guy
This guy really like to show off his body
||Tbh the birds flying near Eren really foreshadowing in the end||
A Mako a day keeps the doctor away
Being a literal comedian without telling you're a comedian
That's the reason why I loved her
When you watch too much chinese shows that you tried to do it irl
I have to stare this to make fun of their poses
Gamagori's backstory if i remember correctly
Why do i get gta vibes here?
So yeh, while it was enjoyable, it lacks some impact that almost got me bored.
||The chemistry between the Florian sisters give a bit of an impact as they had their own beliefs that caused them to drift apart (mainly for Kyrie)||
||Just a lil bit of character development for Hayate and Fate since they became friends with Nanoha||
||I actually prefer this continuity than the OG continuity, because we get to see how much the gang has changed ever since Nanoha got involved with it.||
Time for my review of Nanoha Reflection
Ok so Tadano's mom name is....
you got my attention once i saw nanoha
https://twitter.com/project_brsDF/status/1492075950326128654?t=ZWaR2RrhT8S_mW8Pc10-Og&s=09
A new watcher i see
Fear not my child, no one gets impregnated
Just watch the trailer
Pls better be White bc that antagonist has a white color scheme
*remembers the sperm scene*
That extra cure leak is exactly what i expect to be
Oh god
Bout to say that
!
Yo <@717077859239460875> , your fav
Im watching that grown up BRS
Remember when Laura's cure form was leaked WAY before the body switching ep?
For like a year
I didnt update discord tho
For context, im on mobile

It looks funnier when his eyes pop out
Liked the anime ver tbh
Also here is a meme face for the day
I was like AYO WTF
That op got me when i saw Pretty Holic (the same shop in Tropical Rouge)

To add your explanation, StrikerS was now focused on literally what Symphogear does, had an organization, train newbies, and let the frontliners do the work.
She will dye her hair.....A LOT (from a commenter who reads LN)
But i watch the anime tho
Nah, im just too lazy to read lns
Poor guy never catches a break and hes suffering more than Tsubasa
Its just Touma's routine due to his bad luck
And Touma's teacher was an adult
I was a little surprised when Magnus (the guy who is 14 but is an adult) revealed his age
Its like asking Bakemonogatari watch order and scare them away with that
And worse that shtty quality
My brain hurts
Who knew that To Aru and SAO had the same imprint
I saw Misaka in a DB crossover game
Railgun is the first series i got exposed with To Aru tbh
She was speaking like she is in 3rd person novel
I only like LO bc of the way she speaks
Even the wiki wont save me from that explanation
Sometimes my smol brain cant understand sht about how the esper's abilities work like Accel's
Better be not like in One Piece for a couple years
When To Aru will end anyway?
That position is familiar for this young lady
||What||
Thank goodness
Does the dress had the same reaction when in contact with Imagine Breaker?
Be careful not to get touched by this boys right hand or get ripped
Your clothes is broken? Use many pins to hold them off
I think it was after he dealt with Index going berserk
||Ah i remember, he lost his memory many times||
Boy is this secretly filled with suffering?
Shes no longer the usual clingy teen i once knew
Yes
I saw the cover tho
||Jealous Kuroko||
She gave me some villainess vibes when i saw her
Her ability confused me tbh
I dont wanna question it even further after remembering anime moms like Masumune's mom
I was like "Why a loli is a teacher?"
Cya
Anyway imma go now, i had a couple things to do
Ok
Then rip
**What**
Does IB had an effect on a relic that can destroy gods like Gungnir?
That question wonders me in my head rn
||Guess Hibiki will be cryin once she lost her arm again||
||Hibiki be like: First time?||
The season where Touma's arm was ripped on screen
In Duke of Death's case, they wont plan to move the plot when their goal was accomplished
Fire Force and Duke of Death and his Maid is ending tho
Show us how that works on Switch
Yknow he likes to stay healthy thus he might lived longer for additional 10 or 20 years
I dont wanna imagine the length itself (aka the Eva 3.0 + 1.0 movie treatment)
Just why....?
What are the errors tho
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Ads
Also i wonder what the grown up Gotenks (or whatever their fusion name is) look like...
Is this from the new Super movie?
Keep in mind that StrikerS is almost being Symphogear before it became a thing
Will you go with thw movies or StrikerS?
Because its aimed for boys while Precure is aimed for girls (but some boys watch it)
Same goes for Digimon
Eh who cares, its aimed for boys anyway
Why can't we have at least one female protagonist in a long running shonen franchise?
Winning many times: I sleep
Balance between winning and losing: Real sht
A trope that Arc-V breaks: The parents' flashback being the main source of a protagonist's power up
The animators took the time to animate this face
We didn't realize that Vector was there the entire time and just straight up trolling Yuma and the gang (I won't forget Yuma going berserk after the betrayal)
Vector was one of my fav villains in the franchise
Welp idk if thats the first ever duel to ever involve thw MC fighting their own family member.
||Told you Ragyo is much worse than Finé||
It took me a few seconds to realize that twist
Did you see that plot twist?
And that my friends is why you never befriend someone who has no human background
And Vector is just being a literal btch and trolled Yuma the entire time
I like Zexal II's arcs involving Barians
I was disappointed when Arc-V didnt have the all the protagonists from the previous seasons come together.
"I'm a god btch"
Yugi because of how it reacts when he was possessed
Yuya because his hairstyle doesn't involve some strands to stand out.
I would pick Yuya and Yugi for their hairstyle
Favorite Protagonist hairstyles?
Probably like Tsubasa
Or a mouse if you know what I mean
Its a usual cartoon trope where someone has to kill a bug in a chaotic way
And another thing I liked is that he can change forms when fused with Astral
Yuma was just an ordinary aspiring duelist until the spirit just dragged him to a dangerous situations
If I were to pick the best protagonist in my opinion, it will be Yuma
Biri as in Believe
The op 1 was the only thing i liked
Fck i forgot to mention Zexal op 1  and Zexal II op 1
Believe Buddies
The only ops I liked is Zexal II op 2 (Aoi is in right?), Arc-V op 1 and  4
Fav YuGiOh ops?
I might gonna imagine Yugi and Yuma being buddies because they had ancient companions on their side
I mean just straight up dark
Can we get at least some dark moments like they used in the past?
I meant ALMOST
Welp the only problem is that Cloverworks wont nearly make another season
At first i thought it was Rent a gf until Lily mentions Madoka
I want Rosario Vampire reboot
Same goes for MAPPA staff
She needs a fcking break bro
Who needs talk no jutsu when you're already badass?
Let me tell you, the MC was fcking badass
Mine was May I ask for One Final Thing?
Bring a smartphone: Nope
Bring a cheat item: YES
And i almost got sick of villainess isekai tropes (except for the good ones and Hamefura)
Isekai is getting weirder as time goes by
But the question is, will she become a character that steals the spotlight?
Just wait till we get the vending machine isekai an anime

Just like that one Ukrainian guy who is a fan
Meanwhile, One Piece and DC author just kept milking their stories and we will die before we knew the ending
Welp thats a good point
Not counting Pokemon tho
Thats just an average shonen action kid who thinks shonen is the best
"One Piece has more chapters than any shonen series!"

Are you sure about that?
Netflix

No thanks, i hated the subs from some animes because of how they did the translation dirty
And ||We got the other homunculis here except Greed||
Kinda
||I still liked it but this is kinda messy in terms of accuracy||
Seriously? The first one ||skips the Scar arc yknow||

Fck fillers
And not an actual arc
Wait are you telling me that the movie's story is original?
||Wait till we see Vivio running around and Nanoha telling her to stop||
And this series is (NOT) sponsored by Sega because they dont hesitate to showcase an actual Sega console (I wonder if the author had the rights to use it to their own manga)
Or MC death (this is an actual thing in YT, it came from Anime Brain channel tho)
Just replace the Mario one with Dark Soul's You Died
We have guns equipped with grappling hooks and gauntlets with roller skates, which is very new.
Think the toys come to life
And after watching it gives the same feeling as what those who watched it as a kid.
Toy Story for me but its Toy Story 3 so got spoiled for the entire thing before watching the previous 2
Yes
These two.....
Also i just read Call of the Night and oh boy
Since its on PSP, i will play BUT my problem is that does it have an eng ver?
And 4chan does get weirder
Too lazy to put on bra and cant even cook
Marin is just literally every MC officer worker and loner weeb combined
I prefer this version of her than her TV counterpart
Just ask some anime characters who claims to be good at cooking but managed to fck it up
And pfp change
Am I right?
The Harlaown's moved to Earth way differently than the TV
This had a LOT of changes than the first
And Im fine with that
Arf shows some sympathy compared to being hostile to Nanoha and Yuno
I was forced to endure that sht when i saw the TV for the first time
Tbh i skipped that punishment part because my heart cant fcking take that pain of seeing Fate whipped out.
Will you go with the sequel movies yet?
Caution: Handle Peashy with care.
||Ho boy Subaru isn't ready to Ora Nanoha before the reveal||
||We get Nanomachines that hardens her body then||
||Just give her an Automail and she will be fine||
||Do you see Nanoha getting brutally injured in her last battle?||
||Well Yuri was just manipulated and we finally get to see the most gory injury ever seen in the franchise. Also everytime I hear the word Levi makes me think of Levi from AOT||
Pikachu is Kyubey confirmed

As expected from MAPPA
You mean the last ep right?
Yusei may have it worse
Wdym?
Even boys watch magical girl shows (including Precure)
And thats one thing i always remember
Also this ss was from a couple days ago
We have Spy X Family and Shield Hero

Dont make me argue about Erika being Erika because she is a meme material
I dunno if ill start Heartcatch or My Dress Up Darling marathon

Healin Good got delayed cuz of covid
Dont worry, Miku wasnt alone when it comes to hiatus
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT I HAVE TO WAIT 4 WEEKS JUST TO SEE THE LAST CURE OF THE TEAM?!
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
What does that mean?
Let the villain leave in defeat 👎
Roast the villain 👍

There's another S;G VN that was fully animated by the same studio.
You can play the VN if ya want to know multiple endings
site name?
Erika somehow reminds me of Mako from Kill la Kill tbh
About a boy born in a peach?
You mean that japanese fantasy story?
He will beat the Empire with his teddy

Ah sht i forgot to remind myself with this
||Hes a lucky dude...||
Will Animax care with the swearing? Idk
Looks like they let her swear
Um who is her EN VA?
Spy X Family shows what the new characters look like in anime

Yay, I hate those guys who hacked Toei....
Hah, Toei really delay the animes from them.
I read it before
-sees what's this story about.
Ah yes that one magical girl story where you became the villain right from the start.
Also lets appreciate the details like the effects when the characters attack and the moves in the game
Yeah i almost forgot about that
But as a Tekken fan, i wonder how they can handle this sht since he already had his backstory shown.
We never asked this sht
||Yumi Itaba approves this words||
AND NOT A BUTT PLUG OKAY
Eh its just connected to the panties

So they get the Nanoha the Movie treatment huh?
Also BRS
Shield Hero S2 and Spy X Family is the animes I was very excited for
*pretends Godoka didn't exist*
Whats the worst anime/manga live action adaptation for yall?

Its very screwed now
Vergil wants to have a word with you

Can we just live with Renge singing *that* song one more time so we can rest in peace?
Just why....
he completely butchered Dead Master
In terms of design
Huke nearly butchered my BRS
Did he focused on RWBY or BRS?
And i dont have Disney+
Speaking of BRS, Dawn Fall is coming
Wait....
I think its called Mato Seihei no Slave
Anyway, speaking of Akame ga Kill! I just read the author's latest work.
Yay more ||suffering||
Bc the anime didnt follow the manga's storyline
You mean the anime ver?
Yes
The question is: Will he win NNN?
He will win NNN, if he never seen Marin in her underwear and can't stop thinking about it.
He did use the eroge game for actual research and never fapped.
Gojou was a true chad
The animator probably might gonna end up like the MAPPA animators just to make the 7 sec clip of very detailed fight scenes.
Tbh i never did but thanks for the suggestion
But discord was like "fck you, the vid's mb is too much"
I still have all eps of Sono biqsue doll
Hey, anime is coming up.
I remember asking why Digimon cant have a female protagonist and Sam told me that this is the same reason why tokusatsu shows like Super Sentai and Kamen Rider dont have a female protagonist
Finally, a female protagonist in a shonen series
But still, its making some guys horny
Both her uniform and her casual outfit is the best
I mean, Ame no Habakiri uses lightning after all
Good point tho
Tsubasa: I suffered from my grandfather's ideals
Cole: I suffered from my girlfriend's death
Cole and Tsubasa might be good suffering buddies
Which anime based on a video game is the best in your opinion?
Question:
I mean, they had other projects going on
Time to make a list of anime characters who chose violence
She chose violence when dealing with the bullies ||(but not literally beating them like Rinna did in Vivid Strike!)||
Set this as my new reminder
Ah yes, the lady who wont hesitate to kick your a$$es when you flip her kill switch
I bet Eren told Isayama to do so
I meant characters who went a little too far
Here
He sure has reasons why he did so
Rudeus had gone worse because he had every horni men's nightmare
||Better not use her god powers to increase her sub count||
Oh no....
Netflix pulled off the Pokemon dub move but worse
🤮
Thats like the dub i pretty much hated imo
Isekais MCs that i like is Naofumi, Katarina Claes, and Kazuma
Can anyone give me the schedule for the summer anime 2022?
And she wanted to do the same thing again, but this time shes in her human form.
BRO HAJIME ONLY DID IT BECAUSE SHE WAS IN HER DRAGON FORM
Oh sht, I was going to listen to Shield Hero op (to prepare s2) in YT and noticed that it was taken down.
It got taken down, YT is gonna doom us all
Correct me if im wrong
The only sports that I know apply some real logic is Major and Haikyuu!
They defy some logic?!
Wdym?
This anime REALLY advertise anything from Namco
Well its from Namco so what do you expect
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
Oh fck
Chris
They cant stop milking out am i right?
Namco
Time for Shield Hero Wednesday
Its April 6 now
So apparently, i just watch Top 10  magical girls from WatchMojo and this is what i saw in Honorable Mentions
Ok boys, looks like Shield Hero S2 is here now
Wait till the best part comes in
Gogoanime for me cuz i usually download here than just watching it online cuz buffering
You can catch up with the latest Precure since they will return in 1 week
Spy X Family tomorrow
*coughs* superhuman *coughs*
If you want more Anya, here is a daily dose of her expressions
Me when I do nothing but to think new ideas for my next prompt:
Shikimori would join MK if she wants
Oh god i can hear Flawless Victory voice from Mortal Kombat
Just a cameos
None of the OG Nanoha cast get to shine tho
But dont worry, no dangerous incidents ever happen to them
Focusing on new protagonist while still having the Vivid cast involved
Spin off of Vivid
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Now watch Vivid Strike if ya want
Anya invades the internet
The Cute Peanut Anya vs The Cool Heroine Shikimori?
Now who will win between the two pink haired girls who dominate the internet?
Tf is that?
Just another incarnation
Dont ask
Ill watch that someday if im free
HER HAIR LOOKS SIMILAR
LN or WN, you name it
Isekai titles are getting weirder now
I wonder what are the connections between these two...
DID ANY OF YOUR BUDDIES NOTICED THIS EASTER EGG?!
YOOOOOOO
REVUE STARLIGHT?!
Oh shi-
Are those actual LNs?
Ladies and Gentlemen, she is finally here after her own spin-off
Does Higurashi use the same formula tho?
Yes
Its like playing FFVII remake for the first time
Time to listen the op
Lets do this
SPY X FAMILY
Just a friendly reminder to all Precure fans that they're back in business after the damages done by the hacking
He just caused it just for a single acorn he always chased in every single movie
Scratch was a literal walking running gag who just started the chaos that happened in some cases like Ice Age 4 where he caused a confidential drift
By the same guys who made Tokyo Revengers op
Depending on the series, it may, or may not have a bunch of fillers
Yuri is ||pretty much a siscon||
I honestly liked Yor more than Nightfall ||because Nightfall LITERALLY simps Loid (and only Anya knows this)||
Is Spider-Man 2 game gonna be delayed too?!
BRO WHY?!
Im a sucker for impressive choreography like The God of High School and some impressive visuals like MHA (All Might vs All for One) and Demon Slayer
Its like having to wait till One Piece ends for many years
And still no s2
The sad thing is that she will never break her character at all times
Sauce
||ep 1 after learning he can use magic then Menou stabby stab stab him||
Same reason as why Symphogear never get a dub?
Then bam, we probably got the XDU Global treatment
Not even the well known VAs will be saved either
Oh yeah that
Because it was supposed to promote the gacha game
That would raise a lot of questions for many
True
The animation in ep 1 was by far my favorite in the series
This Symphogear-esque animu got pretty decent in ep 1 then it downgraded very quickly
Its been like 3 months since it ended
That was the first time i ever seen an anime figure where their clothes are wet tbh
MAI SAAAAAN, SKIIDAAAAAAA!!! - Sakuta
You're talking about Sinon from SAO right?
Welp lets just hope its not the English censorship all over again
Is that the Super Sentai romcom anime?
The aftereffects of overtime
Me and the boys binge watching in 2 weeks:
Me and the boys after that:
This is just me after New Year aftereffects
Pls have Anya's heh face
Guess what? Spy X Family saturday
||Aaaaaand i will have to joke Maria from SG again||
That was a big brain move tbh, based Yor
Still watches him just for the season in a nutshell series
Ah right, i nearly forgot that this was a thing

Yes it is indeed good
OH YEAH, I ALMOST FORGOT
Me when school is over and summer is near:
Just a reminder that this man also got involved in FMA Brotherhood
Spy X Family ep 5
||THAT WAS FCKING INSANE, THEY JUST MADE ONE OF THE MOMENTS EVEN BETTER THAN THE MANGA||
||Let the "genderbent" stuff begins!||
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
"CUT TO THE CHASE!" My fav lyric
Aka the "No one knows I'm crossdressing" trope
An edgy sword wielding kid and a (kinda) crazy conman, yikes
And defies one trope by having the FMC ||being a dirty minded sadomasochist villain when she is in her magical girl villain form||
Rate all Spy X Family episodes 1-5

1. Ep 5
2. Ep 1
3. Ep 4
4. Ep 2
5. Ep 3
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
LNs arent my thing but for the sake of it being very well written, i had no choice
Got more
Anyway, Spy X Family ep 6
||THEY DID IT, ONE OF THE BEST MOMENTS IN THE MANGA IS FINALLY ANIMATED!!||
Noted
Where Tsubasa?
Ah yes, the "I want privacy" type of guy
Imagine making a Honest Trailer about this anime
||Is he doing hadoken or a rasengan rn?||
*Avengers theme intensifies*
*Wait...*
But hey, that animation is cool in some shots
Great, guess this is what happens when you dont read the entire thing
Enjoy the ride while it lasts
A female character is a strong lady until she lost to the mc
Thats just a common trope
Its just Kallen with long hair in terms of design
I kept seeing her as Kallen many times tho
And now...you're next *points at NGNL*
Now wait till this gets viral
Hes back and all HxH are happy
Or any Western cartoon channels
Anime back in the day isnt relatively safe from 4kids influence
Is there a Yor Forger one?
Guess Anya simps wont be stopped
Wdym?
https://tenor.com/view/write-that-down-taking-notes-school-universities-university-gif-17937210
Dirty jokes, as in some nsfw jokes?
More Star Wars short animus!!!!
YOOOOOOOO
Whos asking that btw?
She might have dry squeeze out some dudes balls empty and didnt have time to clean so she was like that <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Idk if its a compliment or an insult but ill just leave it be
As what END said, Japan is an island chain so a lot of animators decided to do the same thing over and over again
Dont ask the logic behind this
And still too lazy to catch up, just like the last anime season
Delicious Party Precure is at ep 12
Great...
Wait, you watch BRS for the first time?
||OMG THIS IS STRAIGHT UP FROM A HORROR MOVIE DEATH WTF||
How was the OVA tho?

Just go say it in <#377148557796442134>
You nearly got me hard
Time to send that version of Wrath with a hefty dose of suffering
Ayo, do I smell suffering here?
And still try to milk it by making a movie sequel
Edward's design is pretty cool then the Brotherhood version
I only like some designs from the OG honestly
Take the 2003 FMA and Soul Eater for example
Oh yeah? Why go with the fillers when you can just deviate the source material instead <:Ver:704169051391524875>
FMA happened on the same case as Bleach's except they got with whatever the staff wanted to throw at them
Speaking of Otachan, I just find it funny when i saw this on Otachan Show
Its the day of my bday god
Whats this manga about <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Hope those anime watchers will enjoy this one
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
OSHI NO KO ANIMU, LEZZ GOOOOO!!!
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Bakugan?
||Correction: He tried to save||
||Who also got reincarnated||
I just came here just for that one part ||where Miyuki and Kaguya *did it*||
FYI: Japan doesnt let students have access to rooftop very easily but anime might broke the irl rule
And also the first Ghibli movie that made you shed tears
What was your first Ghibli movie you watched?
You're not alone when it comes to seeing Yui spitting out grandma talk as a Kabuto reference
Probably to avoid suicides
Oh
Read that article not so long ago
Something John Wick would have done in a one on one gun fight
It is
Wait, when will the RWBY anime be released?
That manga basically shifts how the battles were done ala Fast and Furious, ignoring the logic and physics behind
If Honest Trailers react to this:

An anime sponsored by Raid Shadow- Oh wait, wrong one...
This anime is sponsored by Gundam, because Bandai is trying to sell more plastic in a non-Gundam anime.
Hearing english
Too used to watching the OG I guess
BOYS!!! RWBY ANIME ALREADY RELEASED WITH 1 EP 1-3 BUNDLED
At least they dont stick with what Shield Hero had done in S2
Good choice, unless if any of the volumes had flaws
It might take years before the author's new work gets adapted
Lets just hope this might be better or we might get another mess just like the canon
But why did they release it for free but not the other animes?
This is something they should have done but its CR so nah
Avoid spoilers until im done
FMAB "fans" go brr
MAL topic:

Kaguya-sam S3 surpassed FMAB with 9.16 rating

I think we all know whats gonna happen
First, a slime, then a villainess, then a literal spider, and some weird reincarnation into something weird like a vending machine or an onsen.
Isekais get weirder as time passes
But it still involves getting a bunch of girls
Its actually a thing
We shouldn't forget the actors as well
First, Tokyo Mew Mew's creator (correct me if im wrong, now Naofumi and Josuke's EN VA, and now this....
Since 2020, our favorites died one by one
Recycling some ideas blah blah blah, which is why i have to brainstorm some ideas that wont be very generic and cliche in my new isekai story.
Just like those isekai animes
Let me tell you, the fights are super done without relying on stupid magic.

Just pure intense blows that will make your heart racing and your spine shiver.
Does anyone remember Major (the baseball anime) and Hajime no Ippo?
Tbh Raiden's voice in Rising is different so I thought a different VA played him
The Metal Gear Solid or the Metal Gear Rising Raiden?
Is there one character who really you hate in FT?
Sounds like doing side quests before the main quest
Wait, its going to be the 4th of July
This wasn't the first time Marvel had a crossover with a Japanese series
Just an arrogant, bratty fish who is willing to do whatever it takes to become a queen
Episode 2 wont be another Cure debut so next episode, and the cycle goes on until the main team is complete
This isn't the first time Marvel ever had a crossover with other Japanese series franchises.
Oh, that one episode has better fight animation (which I wont say)
Fish and Lesbians, that all I would describe this show
I saw John Wick....

I should give it a try...if im done with RWBY animu that is cuz my storage is eating up
All the longtime animes are getting a comeback but i know one anime that will always say "S2 when?"
Which series are u talking about?
Whats that?
Basically One Punch Man meets Harry Potter
Also her voice is damn good.
Since Rie is gonna voice Tomo, there chances we might see a fanart of her wearing the outfits of Rie's anime roles.
"Sir? Sir!"
"Give me that girl."
"But sir, she's only singing the christian song-"
"Give me that girl, right now."
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHBqIS8yMcg||
(Kinda spoiler-ish)
Yes, that part might (kind of) break the internet
Then she had her man's head
Hey, niceu boat
Very detailed *chef's kiss*
Much more than the Precure franchise....
Just how many ep does the OG have?
*I should watch Tokyo Mew Mew someday...*
Oh boy do we get Miyu suffering?
Wtf is happening in this manga rn?
Illya?
*Hibiki, is that you behind Asuna?*
Imagine how the SAO cast would try the good old PS4 when PS5 became dominant
Anyone feeling the urge to cry after reading this oneshot?
Basically what most people did when finding manga or doujins.
The only thing that got me to read the manga is the vampire Toga, who fits my taste in terms of clothing.
I wont mind its animation style
I just realized that...how many manhwas the JP is gonna adapt and then the Japanese people will just trash talking it despite demanding that this manhwa gets a JP animu. 

At the same time, we enter the "old classic revival" era (aka, the old anime came back in the modern era) because of The Devil is a Part Timer, Tokyo Mew Mew, etc.
||Also, that baby's name is downright ridiculous||
||I saw baby, I say GAAAAAAY||
||Ah yes, the MC having supported by her allies before a new power up||
WAIT WHAT?! I NEARLY FORGOT
Ah yes, this is before digital animation is a thing
Isnt that lady whose problems she solved are punches?
The anime somehow confused me after I read the LN for one reason...

Flashbacks that is clearly from Vol 2 (AKA the Prequel)
Wait, a new ep came out?!
MUH CHILDHOOD!!!
I hoped that the mangaka gets wells because its too early and we already got the news.
Symphogear if Hibiki is in magical World War and German.
This wasn't the only time we saw an anime using an actual footage from the games

Isekai Ojisan had Sonic 2 title screen in episode 1
Much longer than waiting for a Marvel movie in 2022
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
And the only person who can take care of the hamster
"And Japanese cartoons played some part in that?"

Just loved how Otacon didn't just get offended by Snake's comment
I decided to watch Lycoris Recoil after watching Gigguk's Summer Anime in the Nutshell
Its either a coincidence or someone forgot that its set in the 80s
Just like Philip
Which is the sub that I first encounter when I watched W
||Thanks

Anyway, ever seen Akiko's slippers literally translated? This one fits her character well because she isn't a type of girl who wouldn't fck around||
||That park where the witch bathes in a fountain?

Also, give me the pic of that park that was used in many toku shows bc im not familiar with them||
Screw this! Imma watch Fuuto Pi, even if its going to spoil the original show
Oh hey, its Narumi's slippers
This looks dope in anime form
DUUUUUUDE
Lycoris Recoil ep 1 is FCKING LIT

||Chisato never kills people, even the enemies yet she dodge bullets like she's in a Keanu Reeves movie||
Lycoris Recoil just pulled a "They had us in the first half, not gonna lie" move in ep 2

I was shocked
So we have Chisato and Takina
It could have been better because we already learned about Buzz
Yeah, thats a shame
And that was the reason why I picked Woody to have his own spin-off movie.
If it was Symphogear, it will be like

"Hibiki punches god, but it was revealed to be her gf"
Best title clip
I have yet to watch that new ep
I have to double check it and yeah, the anime change the cat's breed
I love the Fuuto Pi ending solely because the entire gang ||including Tokime|| are dancing but I like Shotaro and Philip's dance more.
Fuuto Pi ep 2

||I like a ton of callbacks and nods from the first arc of the original (like when Shotaro shows the picture of the Magma Gaia Memory that was also used in the original) and the Henshin has improved||
Wait, did you say you watched it with CommieSubs?
And he even comments about Kazuya need to get his sht together and 200 chps of no development
I thought the same too
*Kung Fu Panda 2's finale still cried my older-self's soul because of that OST*
The Kung Fu Panda franchise just refused to move on after 3 and made a bunch of TV series sequels that is exclusive to streaming platforms (not counting the Legends of Awesomeness) 

Honestly, 3 is pretty much the end of the series tbh.
One more season and two part final chapter movies
I cant help but to agree with that
3 is the closing note
Same
||That's even better.||
YOOOO, Fuuto Pi just ||used the opening of the OG in the fight scene! Also, I appreciate seeing Luna's ability because I found it goofy everytime I saw stretchy arms||
So what is the best CGI animated series/movies in your opinion?
If you want to know the show, let me tell you

Its about a dude who is two-timing
The merging makes it even worse
This entire merging is getting out of hand
Imagine a Lycoreco game but has MGS gameplay
Fuuto PI ep 4
||Just a typical magical girl transformation scene in this ep except the ladies dressed the programmer into the mascot that was targeted, the transformation was so weird that I forgot I was watching a tokusatsu anime.

It wont complete without the female being shown naked, and I just wondered if YT will notice what naughty vid Muse Asia uploads

Philip, you chill down, your man will left bitches depending on the situation||
Fuuto PI
||That aside, apparently, I found out in the manga version that Ryu Terui was supposed to appear at the end of the Road and Toadstool case but he was written out in the anime.||
Those things are just as scary as the games
Resident Evil CGI movies were fairly decent while being scary and Damnation just shows Lickers who's the boss
Wait, Familiar of Zero's anime is different from the source material?
JUST HOW MANY SHOWS WILL GET BUTCHERED AFTER THE MERGE
||Guess I have to find out in the live action||
||Ugh, did someone copy pasted Tron and made it worse?||
Hey, its Kira Yoshikage
LycoReco ep 3 

||Chisato's ability to know when her enemies shot and dodge them on time, that's just basically Spider Sense||
Thank you for reminding this
Fuuto Pi Episode 5
||HERE WE ARE BOYS||
||Also, more Takina development!||
LycoReco ep 4
||Dude, that train gunfight scene is literally No Russian (even the bullets won't stop the knock-off Hazama)||
A genius hacker and a young homunculi research

A perfect mix
Aight, does anyone watch LycoReco dub, because the anime site I go there had one when I searched the anime.
Wait, so they have part 2 coming soon?
Shame I cant read LNs legally
Tbh, this sounds more of a porn dialogue
This one is fine compare to that translation imo
And just learned its still going
I just realized that instead of doing the usual 2 episode per arc in Kamen Rider W, they went with the three episode in Fuuto Pi
An isekai anime potential
Sauce
Fuuto Pi
||I love where Akiko literally used her slippers  as a weapon||
Since silencer aren't actually make the gunshot on silent mode
LycoReco ep 10
||Why the Vector, you know this thing had high recoil.

Also, that poor dude wasnt able to stop himself from commiting suicide after taking a pistol||
While we are waiting for the new ep to come out, enjoy these random screenshots
I managed to catch up all LycoReco episodes (with me continuing W)

||This...I cannot describe how much suffering she went through||
I accidentally read the wrong spoiler by accident but still gonna watch LycoReco ep 9 anyway
Well in my case when watching  Spy X Family, I still got pissed at the part when ||the Forgers are interviewed and this mf just pissed me off even though I read the manga beforehand||
It only works on anime originals so yeh
LycoReco Ep 8 (forgot to spoiler the img) ||Fuck, now we got Symphogear||
LycoReco ||Loli or not, Chisato's still scary||
||Nah, failed to find it||
||Lemme google that||
||Bulletproof clothing and the watch under the wrist, this is really John Wick||
LycoReco Ep 5
||So this implies Chisato had a heart transplant from the Alan Institute.

Also, Mizuki is just the living embodiment of those who stayed home most of the time and scrolled through our gadgets during the pandemic||
?
Send me an invite
Basically...
Animation staff and Corporate workers

Worked their asses off only to get a low salary.
Well, it is what it is Sam, gay power is too strong, even Akiko appreciates it.
Gotta be the episode I wont forget including that Chocolate episode
Where is that fanart where Hibiki and Miku recreated one of the scenes from the show?
||Why tf is Kirito doing here?||
And Yuuki Yuna also because of the XDU collab
This made me want to watch the OG, then the progressive because I'm curious about that potion scene you talked about.
Also, my braincells left the chat because of the watch order, I never knew this series would mix up other scenes and storylines together.
Does the Washio Sumi TV expand a lot of content from the movies or its just the same as watching a movie in episode form?
Can somebody give me a proper watch order of Yuuki Yuna, I'm so confused as heck
Washio Sumi make my brain go unga boga
I wad about to start Yuuki Yuna then I saw this
https://tenor.com/view/lycoris-recoil-chisato-nishikigi-gif-26283708
Another sequel that nobody asked (kinda)

It may be the "we didn't ask but its well deserved" or "we didn't ask and it sucks"
Fuuto Pi Ep 7 
||Then, how tf did her slippers changed different phrases everytime? Did she got a ton of them?||
Lemme guess what part you wanted to see
I finished Cyberpunk anime ep 1 and ho boy...

Lots of blood and two ||sex scenes, yikes||
LycoReco Ep 11
||Chisato finally uses a different gun, which is a freaking shotgun that has long range and...

CHISATO AND TAKINA VS MAJIMA LEZZGO||
https://tenor.com/view/lycoris-recoil-chisato-nishikigi-takina-inoue-kick-anime-gif-26286635
||Robota's gonna get arrested for distributing robot porn

Yeah, but Takina is desperate to save Chisato and she needed to kill Yoshi.

Note that in the final moments, it takes place in the sunset||
LycoReco
Do not call the FBI...
Oof
||WHY YOU DIDNT KNOW ABOUT THE USB?!||
LycoReco ep 12
||1v1, Chisato vs Majima, they will end this once and for all

Their response tho||
Until they finally fixed the issues
And the game that was based on was a messy one when it launched
Its just became the internet talk of the week because of Rebecca
Everywhere I go, I see her face
Me when Lycoris PV released in tomorrow:
No Lycoris PV today
Gosh, I remember the Detective Conan crossover OVA when I saw this
Have some Chisato before its over
||Genjuro would like to know your location|| (Lycoris Recoil)
||Tf is this poster XD|| (Lycoris Recoil)
The last card for LycoReco
||Yeah, like, he fell from a tall tower and still survived like it was nothing.

One question we never got an answer||
Because my mom watched the first two live action FMA movies (and when she watched the second one on Netflix, she had the audacity to set the audio to English, which I have to endure until she's sleeping.)
You mean the live action ones?
One reason why I prefer the movie Nanoha's design

I find it weird when she still had the red ribbon in StrikerS tbh.
Thats the one
Free Trials

They tricked me
Maybe I should watch Gundam IBO and Witch someday
So the Road to Naruto video shows the compilation of Naruto's iconic moments with the iconic OPs and updated animation.
https://youtu.be/yKELA1qBAKA
Ok, looks like I won't just sit here and watch an hour of new Switch games
Wait, so you're telling me that Direct will only show the Mario movie?
I have a love for gays but I must take a break for a while after Lycoris Recoil ended
Just blame my taste
My current anime watchlist this season

New ones
Gundam: Witch from Mercury
Spy X Family Part 2

Must watch
Sword Art Online
Yuuki Yuna Yuusha de Aru

(Will update if newer anime comes)
Never pause an anime moment
What's your favorite animated series/movie in terms of animation and visuals?
*SAO S1 and 2 is going to air in Muse Asia bc of the SAO anime's 10th anniversary*

So that was a waste of time downloading it....
Finished CP: Edgerunners
||The finale nearly got me in the feels...

Aoi Yuuki moment||
And Lucy ||being sad that she cannot go to the moon with him, and the music hurt me even further||
VPN is the answer
||Well that aside, if you know what happened when Shotaro gets bitches, then you know.||
Distracted boyfriend - Japanified
||The room is very Tsubasa|| (G Witch)
Which Setsuna?
Naisu
I happen to live in an Asian country so no resorting to piracy
So I can watch G-Witch on YT as long as I'm in Asia?
Please tell me this one takes place in the future because Lisa in the present timeline never wore a suit underneath her iconic shirt.
Sonic X is just a retelling of Adventure but add humans to the main cast, you get this.
*Me listening to Chainsaw Man OP*

1st listen: Eh, it's good, time to repeat it again.
2nd listen: It's better now
After a few listens: *bops to this song and watches Denji and Power sharing the same braincells when dancing.*
Welp, let's just hope Lisa didn't develop God Complex merely because her name started with a L
What happened tho?
So this will come out one month after Frontiers came out
||-Agrees with a guy whose balls you kicked a couple times||
Just read the CSM manga and ||DUDE, Power really needs some serious hygiene.

(Even Denji joins in)||
Ryuk looks like Bart ngl
Damn I want to watch it someday solely because Tachikoma's voice is annoying but cute.

And Togusa also (thanks for that collab of the game I'm playing)
WHY WHY WHY?!
This one...is the most cursed thing I ever seen
My teacher be like:
Liked this OP for three things

The song
The movie references
And Denji and Power dancing
27 chapters left for CSM manga, shit's good especially the bloody parts.
DUUUUUUUDE!!!

(CSM manga spoiler) Denji vs ||literally Makima and her gang of devils|| literally blew my mind with how gory this shit is.
LNs in a public library I assume
Is this a 4koma spin off of Machikado?
BECCA NOOOOO!!!
NOOOOOO!!! WHY DID YOU BUY IT?!
We would be sad if our favorite celebrities leave but our hearts will remember them.
Not all VAs can stay in their roles forever
Saying that after the Netflix live action cancelled, is it a coincidence?
His VA has played some well known roles
Also....
Mah boi Togusa is goated, why need a cybernetic when you got a brilliant mind.
After a couple people appreciated Bocchi, I might give this a try
Is it just me or did I almost fail to tell the difference between CGI and animated in CSM anime?
||That Terminator theme tho XD, a cherry on top for the comedy||
Because of you went episodes 6-8, then you're in for a ride but good thing you waited the anime to finish because episode 8 somehow shocked us.

(Not spoiling for the newbie)
What ep?
Wait till you get the good stuff in later LycoReco episodes
I thought of Blend S at first when I saw the letter S
*insert Metal song playing*
Other than Chainsaw Man's OP being my top opening this year

Spy x Family Op 1, Overlord IV, and Reincarnated as a Sword were my faves.
Maybe I should give G-Witch a try, got the prologue and episode 1 at my disposal
Give me at least one anime scene that is so disturbing/uncomfortable asf

First season of Nanoha
||Fate getting whipped by Precia, the sound and Fate's painful voice felt all too real for me, this scene is so fucked up, I skipped the same scene again when I watched the movie||
Kizuna Ai my beloved
Another lost media, bingo!
And now, we proceed with Jojo part 7, which Im still wondering how the studio will handle the horse scenes if they ever animate it.
Wait, the Megumin spin off already uploaded?!
Please put the title next time for Pete's sake
Speaking of Aoi, I never seen her doing live action/tokusatsu but we still see her very often in anime.
This is the first time I see her using the pistols in the cover art, usually its just her P90
Even Fujimoto's one shots?
Me urging to watch G-Witch:
Tournament in a multiplayer game that I haven't completed: Look at me, I'm your priority now.
Shit's go from 0 to 100 very quickly
https://tenor.com/view/johntron-i-have-several-questions-gif-9543284
Me when I got exposed to Oshi no Ko for the first time: This one's another cute idol journey.

Me after reading the manga: ...
Netflix again, I have enough of this shit
And it will always be fucking Norman Osborn of all people.
She didn't give herself a break from voicing many characters every single year
Aoi is EVERYWHERE
First, its Lucy, and now we got this?!
Speaking of Precure...

Did the franchise ever shown actual deaths before the parent complain to Toei?
The rap scene is fire <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Nice to see the RWBY gang in their current style

But for the JL...yeah, it felt unrecognizable
Chris only voice a villain in Tropical Rouge and thats it
Oh, Miku too
If you want Kirika, you got Delicious Party (aka the current season) but be warned, its a mess.
I recommend watching Heartcatch Precure because NANA WILLS IT
They did Sango very dirty
Wait, the entire DR 3?
Adapt the entire of Yor arc into an anime, its awesome asf

The movie should be a filler
Insomiac Spidey
Since it takes place as the og K-on!, I wonder if any of the K-on! characters will ever appear.
That's basically going through what Subaru went from ReZero, dying (in Touma's case, ||losing his memories||) only worsened his sanity.
||This man lost his memories so many times that he even forgot his relationships, which is an added bonus for his suffering||
MAL peeps really went to say "she's just like me fr" without saying "she's just like me fr"
This is what I could think of:

Fate/Stay Night First Route Remake

Rosario+Vampire, the anime deviated the source material too much

Soul Eater remake, same reasons as Rosario+Vampire.

Internet Explorer anime (the Merryweather version)

The entirety of DMC series starting from the first one
I have to remind myself that Toaru's order is more complicated than Fate.
Sadly, this anime suffers from "running out of material" category, they could've just ended the anime in a cliffhanger, allowing the manga can continue.
Good nostalgia

The older cartoon literally shows violence and we are chill with it.
Ngl, I prefer the OG look over this because his hair looks dope
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Based Muse Asia watcher
How come?
This is like the second time I saw an anime where they make a Guilty Gear cameo
Red Astolfo
It has the RTX levels of graphics ngl
Trigun Stampede might be one of the animes that used CGI very well, imo.

Second place goes to Black Rock Shooter (TV)
Chris approves
Wait, I can start a discussion about the VAs and their central roles.
Speaking of Nana, I realized that some of her characters often have one thing in common:

Suffering.
What do you guys think with the new Puss in Boots movie? (Just spoiler your opinion to avoid spoiling anyone who didn't watch it),
||Death should belong to Kung Fu Panda ngl because this man is intimidating asf||
Speaking of which, I can see Roman meeting up with Catwoman or The Penguin.
These two literally spent their lives in isolation
Guess Neo and Bane would get along
Thx
Oh yeah, that
I know the two (Hero-King and Onimai) but I forget the third.
The only episode I remember in terms of story is that one Master Shifu episod
"I wish I could go on a day without rusting in the rain~"
Took me a while to know what the acronym is and now, I heard that theme song again
Cloud Bread...
CLOUD BREAD?!
Lets see if they dont at least missed the mark like the last time
We got a new Precure Baton Pass and I have to start again after being burnt out from DeliPar

SERIOUSLY, I CAN HEAR THAT BLOODY THEME IN MY HEAD
Did anyone make a video comparison about Carol's voice in JP and EN?

Because this concept is cool
How dare they baited us into thinking we get some adult badassery from her
Lindy...
Lindy is what motivates me to keep watching then they just butcher her screentime
||Dreamworks copied Sony Animation's homework but still make it original enough.||
Search it up
Just search it up
I made a random Symphogear edit using one of the scenes from the movie, you can find it in <#357682999300718592>
||The whistle tho...||
Mine is:
||- Fearless Hero scene, the Spanish Splitter...ugh, I can feel that.

- Literally every Death's scenes and him saying that he is the real deal (memorized his introduction)

- The Wishing Star battle scene.

- Puss vs Death Final Duel.

And of course, Puss and co going to Far Far Away.||
What are your favorite moments in this movie, Ghostra?
LETS GO
Bro...BRO
I haven't watched it but I get a bad feeling that he will roast this anime hard when he sees those...ehem...reactions to tasting food.
https://youtu.be/il0VeFfKg7w
Please tell me they are not from the same people as those other delayed shows...
ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS
They better have some sort of BBs that explode into red dust like in the anime.
So she's basically working two jobs every week
Yep, LycoReco and the RWBY anime released the same season
Yuri is my Job if thats the title
Lets count how many Yuris we got this year
Just a friendly reminder that she also voiced the beer loving onee-chan in LycoReco, Mizuki.
||And out of all deaths in ZLS, Lily died of heart attack, making her different from her fellow zombies who died by physical means (not counting Tae as her death is still unknown)||
That's showbiz in general, child actors tend to get stressed out from the harsh realities.
We have the same opinion, I see
