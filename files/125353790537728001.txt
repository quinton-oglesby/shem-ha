Fucking ssj <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Made me mad Carol should have won that fight
Its counted alchemy as evil didn't it
I just assumed the scarf was more saint Germain leaking into her gear
Movies with them fisting custodians would be lit tho
If she kills shemmy they just locked her up rather than dealing with her
They might be freaked out by hibiki tho
Hibiki breaks ssj Carol splits miku and shemmy then shemmy gets fisted across space and time <a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746>
PHONIC GAIN
Just punch the God out of her
<:Dumb:356557505176010753>
Blame apple
Something would have  triggered it eventually
Add some FREEDOM to that hat and have hibiki wear it
<:MEGAPOG:594326322541756426>
Based naked hat man
Can shemmy beat Adam's comedic timing
It's probably gonna be them  trying to split them that's the problem
Gungnir will cancel her God regen wouldn't it
I wanna be shemmy grapekun
Turning humanity into her noise army <:bookaThinker:401008378601537556>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
But since it's gone they can just spam it
I thought the needed the gain to overcome the curse lock
But at this point hibiki is just way to deus ex machina for me to think anything bad will happen
After the fight or something
Farthest I'll go is all the gears explode
If anyone but shemmy dies I will be shook
I think its gonna be split shemmy and miku then hibiki punches shemmy across space time with another gungnir feature <:Dumb:356557505176010753>
Her slapping nana out of mind control won me over tho
I wasn't a big Maria fan till this season
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Look to wild arms for all your answers
Wild arms
<:bookaLife:462105541360091136>
Recurring hamster in the SoL version
Have her go around body jacking cats or other small animals
Turns out miku was dominating shemmy the whole time and stops when she wins 1v6 <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I'd sit through 5 seasons of it
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I would do illegal things for a SoL symphogear after
Fund symphogear strikers with gacha
<a:whalesiero:456365726270226442>
Sorry mom
Hibiki starts singing
Shemmy acts up
Determination to fist
Same
And I'll be happy
Gimme that
i got all my checklist crossed off this episode so im happy <:WewLad:233720076036079616>
i liked their character design thats all i liked about them <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
elf9 is still alive so she will fix em <:SatThumb:358456929250443264>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
after they all end in mass murder
idk who would go to a tsubasa concert
preferable with her hair sword
i want more tsubasa memes
im pretty satisfied as is so the shinais will just be extra
AXZ>XV>S1>G>GX but might change after i rewatch them this week
ver was there but my boy adam wasnt <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
they were talking about still not being able to understand each other so im guessing shemmy is still there if they ever go full apple again
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
wrong jam
<a:SourPls:393795773306765322>
you would jam out
join the gacha <:Dumb:356557505176010753>
but why

my new wallpaper tbh
<:WewLad:233720076036079616>
not gonna lie hibiki confessing was more than i thought we were gonna get
doesnt count as a spoiler if u dont know what it is until it happens you know <:thinkDerp:590805712834134016>
that makes it 2/4 <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
i lost count of the concerts she had
if u think about it they would all be shemmy mind slaves without top dad <:bookaThinker:401008378601537556>
to the dome
what if they let us buy tickets normally instead of a lottery <:WewLad:233720076036079616>
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
hibiki doesnt need math she just needs her fist
alchemy tag means you die in symphogear <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:Germain:421434126856486912> best part
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
miku can take biki and chris
i assumed it was enki died and put a curse on humanity but didnt tell fine why so she thought he abandoned her there and left with the rest of the custodians
she has to make shemmy look strong
shes fine
maria is a PRO at landing
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
KABUKI
2 years for xdu original source thank you based gacha
i forget when its coming out but magia record came out in 2017
<:bookaLife:462105541360091136>
we will get an xdu anime like madoka got one for their game
i believe in xdu
no giant robots yeah but especially hibiki's s1 transformation with all that wiring and shit going into her
i thought it was considered mecha because of the mechanical symphogears
<:WewLad:233720076036079616>
she got the SG look with her single end red scarf
<:KarenShrug:605495030127263764>
or people saying no one confessed but i still think hibiki telling sleeping miku she loves her was a confession
main complaint ive heard of xv ending is the no kiss
im listening
^
jp twitter is banging tonight with xv stuff <:WewLad:233720076036079616>
up and down basically
gets back wholesome breaks some stuff on the way
starts wholesome goes dark
<:bookaThinker:401008378601537556>
when i saw that i was doing some thinking
the main characters power up is pretty much hibikis fist scarf
<:bookaLife:462105541360091136>
yuyuyu is fun been on that since the start of it too
<:WewLad:233720076036079616>
it can be like the to love ru guy tier of lewd
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
why non h
chris could be hibiki and miku's third wheel
there was that game where all the harem members fell for hibiki
<:GWwhengoingPrivategetsatyou:391781752689000448>
robot exclusion
but they let the perfect monsters in <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:bookaLife:462105541360091136>
he stole that phone from fine
they did him dirty
what about my boy adam <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
based alchemy
alchemy
make a video with kirika dess ing every enemy to defeat
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

symphodess
outside of dmjii robots
i love you       i saw you grabbing chris boob
<a:whalesiero:456365726270226442>
with some XDU
<a:whalesiero:456365726270226442>
i see the magic words
she was wrong <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
she probably didnt think those toys would amount to anything more than that
didnt she say she made symphogears to keep people off her while she did moon breaking things
fine was probably fucking around
as tsubasa's pairing basically
i meant in zwei wing
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
well played maria you played the long game
XV maria is worth replacing kanade for me now
the tv version is tied for my favorite op atm
the nana parts were great
i didnt like the secondary vocals on it
i wasnt a fan of the full version <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
im hoping we get another metanoia version too
watching those is always nice
im waiting for those blurays
vengeance is evil purify it <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
im going shemmy since i dont think ghost rider has any god slaying spears lying around
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
its gonna be a whole new game in like 30 minutes
<a:whalesiero:456365726270226442>

gonna get bullied for worst sales since s1 <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
live tickets
or stuff like 4komas or something
be that in XDU spin offs
people still want more symphogear so dont expect it going away just yet
if they bring in new VA's for a spinoff and it tanks that would be something else tho
until those go down i wouldnt say its fatigued yet
werent the sales numbers really good for this season
that one is my favorite
she already has some of it down when she does her hand stand spin <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<:Dumb:356557505176010753>
id play a symphogear rhythm game
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Just noticed in the metanoia scene everyone else is talking about getting back the future hibiki just yells miku
operated and owned by the gov instead of private business
yeah
going to the government instead of private
that was me someone got taisha'd <:bookaLife:462105541360091136>
<:Wuuuuuw:356686212246929408> ill never get those people honestly
they were called the taisha hence the term <:Comfy:410890977343963137>
its what the overseeing body did in Yuuki Yuuna just wiping things from human records
wiped from history <:Dumb:356557505176010753>
Someone getting taisha'd i missed some shit <:lacS:516124114272911390>
<:GWwhengoingPrivategetsatyou:391781752689000448>
its just that sort of stuff that makes up the reasoning for my hot take
they actually didnt even care that she died
got bullied relentlessly and then the kids started a rumor that her ghost haunted that bathroom <:Smile:358456865379844096>
a few years before i went to highschool apparently a disabled girl killed herself in the bathroom
maybe ive just seen some real bad ones
only caring about themselves and for the most part the bullying is just insane to anyone even a little bit different but it makes them fit in so its fine <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
hot take but teenagers are all sociopaths for a few years
just sucks that they dont find a better system to help people who really need it
at those hours especially ye
sadly its probably like a daycare for the parents
being separated might just seem like the best way for them to deal with it or something kids are real fucked up
to be fair the kids in the classes like that were bullied relentlessly when i went to high school <:GWwhengoingPrivategetsatyou:391781752689000448>
Telling a coworker to hang it up as a joke is pretty <:Wuuuuuw:356686212246929408>
Personally i think its ok to joke about that ONLY if u know the other person is ok with it
u right
the lack of communication there is pretty <:lacS:516124114272911390>
^
goodluck <:SatThumb:358456929250443264>
i thought u were young too so its pretty much a learning experience
just seems like u gotta brush up on social cues and stuff
na i dont think that at least <:oh:356805568788168724>
when u were dating her
if hes ur best friend he might feel a bit ignored
id just ask him and if he doesnt tell u why it might be because u pay less attention to him
thats out
unless hes seen her fb profile or someshit
same
<:Dumb:356557505176010753>
i still think ur friend likes her
any friend that gives ultimatums is just shitty imo but u right
also ur friend sounds pretty shitty but thats just imo <:Wuuuuuw:356686212246929408>
<:oh:356805568788168724>
but u engaged the break up
i got no idea why he would get mad about it otherwise
<:oh:356805568788168724>
but whys he mad does he like her or something
hed got shot
he say that shit in my old neighborhood
killed in the hood yo
depends where he says it
<:lacS:516124114272911390>
HOLY SHIT <:bookaXD:462105539690889216>
but as a term of endearment
in a diff language
every time she would just say o here come my blackie
she had a tall black man deliver her medical stuff for years
my grandma was racist but not in a like hateful sense
old people are pretty much all racist

most big figures in the bible were dicks
badass
he SHOOK those 2 ladies

mc is pretty much snake tbh
they animated all 3 vns

it did get an anime
grisia
on a side note soild vs liquid yuuji was badass as fuck
dante won
he lost to liquid tho

Going to school so i can go make money to live the NEET dream after
Usually strapped for money but ye <:Dumb:356557505176010753>

precedent is a VERY powerful thing
i really hope it doesnt go anywhere
celebrating literal RIGHTS being taken
even if u agree or disagree with whats being banned
drawing a 2d picture is a victimless crime  but if u wanna project that its as bad as real flesh and blood children being abused then go for it my dude
pedophilia is a mental disease but fuck mental health am i right america
its going after something that isnt the problem
<:GWwhengoingPrivategetsatyou:391781752689000448>
and id be against it
they could bring down jesus christ himself to oversee this
telling people what they cant DRAW is insanity
im just all against it and nothing will change my mind on it tbh
the intention is being used as an excuse to literally take peoples artistic freedom away
to jail its bad for the kids
u smoking weed
its straight up just like when they did all that shit for the KIDS
its incredibly broad you are right
and that people are actually in favor of doing so
that they are legitimately considering infringing on free speech this much
its really fucking scary too
telling people what they are allowed to draw this always ends well
Also going on the record saying a trash bin is more deserving than vic
Im not a big en dub fan but i agree
compared to boobs
but its crazy how dehumanized we are to say gore and death
mostly in the west
we are at a really weird time sex wise
models boob bouncing CUT THE FEED
ripping peoples faces clean off is fine
the evo thing is a REALLY great look at that stuff tbh
<:AMAZIN:544390128764846081>
while pushing your moral values onto them

RISE UP <:AMAZIN:544390128764846081>
<:Dumb:356557505176010753>
neets and weebs aint gonna rise up as easily as say the NRA
they do it cuz its an easy target
same pretty much
glad u like em <:bookaLife:462105541360091136>
its illegal in some places yeah
servers in other countries <:lacEZ:516124129129267210>
<:Dumb:356557505176010753>
japan will put a bar on the loli eyes
yeah un is just a suggestion but again it sets the precedent which people with actual power can use to make real legislation
ive maxed my credit card a few times for pixels as well
u right
mobile games are a true enigma
to keep it on serious discussion i find it amazing how well gacha games managed to capitalize on people with extra income
<:alkKayo:351938258210390016>
she CAME HOME
on 1 ten draw
ye

i rolled my wife on a phone game so its the best timeline for me atm
or the mayan calendar thing
it was either the large hadron colider
everything they touch turns to shit
EA let it be good
^
EA making an actual good game
bethesda shit
nintendo safe haven
sony censoring
where the timeline is WAY off
and got pushed into a parallel universe
we all actually died in 2012
ive been pushing the theory
<:GWwhengoingPrivategetsatyou:391781752689000448>
i want a switch
it was that bad <:alkMoost:351938224517677057>
i repressed it
https://tenor.com/view/wwe-velveteen-dream-nxt-dream-has-no-memory-of-that-gif-12191857
i have no memory of that
whats that
leave em alone <:alkKayo:351938258210390016>
their birthrate is already down
fucking missionaries
like dont go to japan and try to push ur morals on them
the thing that irks me is they are doing this at evo JAPAN
<:AMAZIN:544390128764846081>
meanwhile little timmy is on his phone looking for minecraft boobies
its always for the children
<:bookaKotori:462105531314601994>
i know that feel
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
but most JP VA's are really good u mad lad
<:alkMoost:351938224517677057>
but dont fucking put em in a game i have to PAY to play
like if its f2p sure have gacha and or lootboxes
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
falling for gacha in a full price game makes me get mad at people
as much of a sucker for gacha that i am
idk if they made more
i only remember the puc puc game
remotely popular
there is a gacha for everything
<:lacAYA:516124119788421150>
ive also pavlov'd myself to be very happy whenever i see a rainbow
<:bookaWA:462105527669882890>
that goes to show u how our mind works and stuff
but its a pretty interesting thing
ive only taken notes from when i get hooked on a game
to get to that point
its interesting how they get you so hooked onto them
and then pay it off a month later
they also put themselves into debt to roll
<a:whalesiero:456365726270226442>
lots of disposable income
and then some on others
on 1 game
ive known some that legit have spent over 100k
whales are sugoi
im only up to like a few grand on 1 specific game
anything for my waifu's
and im damn proud of it
<a:whalesiero:456365726270226442>
This is why i always recommend using a credit card online banks will charge back no matter what
You can and just be done with it
Just don't engage them its only good for her if u do
For sure dont leave without the evidence for your stuff
Or wanting what you paid for
And shouldnt be shamed for not wanting censorship
U did nothing wrong from the looking in view i have atm
Best advice i can give on this tho is dont listen to her or the clout chasers on her echo chamber discord
I don't wanna make it more of a deal than u choose
Na its fine
Doesnt mean u have to like the person
You can like a persons work
I have a decent idea who but not naming is best so <:SatThumb:358456929250443264>
O ait
Should dm it to her if shes on this server
<:bookaXD:462105539690889216>
O ltg i thought she meant the artist
does he charge 5 dollars per line of text
LTG <:Pog:518902202132332576>
You would be surprised
That person seems like a trash human that will eventually slight the wrong person
And u can either post it somewhere or wait till they eventually make enough people mad and add to that fire
Go through catalog EVERYTHING
I would just stop posting in there u aint gonna get nothing but stress
U got way more patience than me
Talking to people in their own echo chamber <:WewLad:233720076036079616>
<:Dumb:356557505176010753>
Stop objectification of women pay me and ill do it for you instead
Thats ironic <:bookaXD:462105539690889216>
FGC is one of the most perverted communities around
Pick one
Being a pervert is wrong
FGC
Wait a minute
Don't let the people on that server get to you they are never gonna admit their idol did anything wrong
But if there is only proof for one side it turns into a skewed shitshow of manipulation and optics
Document all of it sane people will side with whoevers in the right
Fanaticism
ye trying to explain censorship to people like that is impossible
and saying see you next year
i can imagine her forgetting it at home
tbh i would just charge back eat the loss and move on cuz this might just ruin your entire evo trip if it comes back up again
<:bookaThinker:401008378601537556>
cant even be arsed to type out a label or write better on an international package
paypal should charge back easy
thats all on her
<:bookaXD:462105539690889216>
Could ruin ur entire evo weekend
Thats why it might not even be safe to meet her as well
She says go they march <:Ver:336656981144109066>
And i doubt her zealots care about the witch hunting
Cuz she's gonna get mad that u charged back
But make sure u have proof of her not delivering
If u can take losing the stuff id charge back
It doesn't seem healthy to actually meet in person after all the distress this caused
Im not up to date with this so im not gonna say much but i advise to take a step back nep and look at both sides ur just listing one sides points like a checklist
<:bookaXD:462105539690889216>
Twitter is great for drama like this
Ive seen them all even the uncensored one <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
U luck sack
Tread twitter carefully its full of jared nudes
Probably the pill version of chemo
but yeah twitter is pretty rustled over it atm
it was a clever use of the symbol tbh
