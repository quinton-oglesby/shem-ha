<@!98283721718763520> cheers
anyone here need just a little bit more mats? willing to give final kills away
anyone else have a bunch of raids that need clears?
oh rip
wrong tag lol
going to give 5 mins for people to tag <@!115964144120758280> 's body
you are deleting followers right
still full
<@!180486147821142017> still full
hdk, you need some space
omw
you guys want final hit, or should i just kill?
might've forgotten to remove some people
yeah
no more rice
also, i'd double check followers list to remove the old SANIC
i'll wait about 30 mins for people to tag
it's about to die
tag it if you haven't
all i see are ones with only 1 tag
personally, putting up too many raids prevents me from actually finding the good raids to hit
whoops

probably not going to touch ones with only one tag, not enough rice for that
i try only tag things with multiple hits
also ur ful
i add you
you don't add me
