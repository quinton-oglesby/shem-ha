putting a number after the command shows the corresponding page

and if you want to see your card list when you start collecting:
okay
you don't have to do three at once
every three cards you get an additional card.
you could pull one.
you can try tomorrow, you'll have 150 koins then
so 1000
for 100 <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> each
[rv_pull "AU" 10] would get me 10 cards from the AU list.
so, the gachas are AU, Grand Opening and Chris-mas.
you do those by typing [rv_pull "(gacha name)" *number*] without the []
to check your account

rv_gachalist
to check the gachalist, use
ah, good, you are already registered
<@180413641428959232> basically, you register by typing the command here, (when we get it), and then you type "dess_timely", which will give you 75 Kiricoins <:Kiricoin:495336831978569759> every 20 hours. every hundred you can trade it for one card.

oh, I see
tiny lesbian Serena? Why the "lesbian"? She is a gear character, it's a given.
I swear, if we don't get a Mariacon 2k19 I'll rage
100 free coins today
ha!
good afternoon, boss
They remind me of Sailor Moon villains.
Here is something happy
I kinda don't like how the pic of her sitting alone in the cafeteria is used... I makes my Maria loving heart sad
Serena, you mean
but is looks so sad!
ummmm.... guys. what is that server icon?
if we keep writing fics, it will stay
Canada is now Serena's and Kanade's ship name

Serena x Kanade, huh?
Smells like blood and burning
multiplied with itself
not double
Every Serenacoin is -1
Serenacoin when?
Basically, let's pay my workplace so it can pay me
Did anyone expect something else?
That's capitalism. It's about making more money, not spending it on the "small people"
The trickle-up effect or fountain effect is an economic theory used to describe the overall ability of middle class people to drive and support the economy
I got 100 today
this goofy animated gif of yours, Kramer
That's fine
Serena!!!
nep
making everyone lesbian. Having all the big sisters
I like that joke
only a few minutes ago I noticed the colors
I did not even know there was a restriction to access this channel
150 today
boom

so maybe
I love Maria
Merena?
Cags libido is so big it lives in a stadium
Serelua
Or is Serena the smaller, less fluffy version of Kanade?
So, would shipping be selfcest?


That's okay. Just an idea I had in mind
Hey, I am just making suggestions. I thought maybe that would get more people involved in discussions here and stuff
Hey, say, I got a funny idea: How about implementing an XP system for discord? The more people write and contribute the higher the level
Quick idea: With Kanade's birthday today I remembered that many discord servers change their icon for a day for the specific character. would that be something we could do?
and thank you
sure, no problem
<@!127644949884698624> I am not quite sure where to put it, so I will do it here: I did some picture edits already with photoshop and premiere for you guys and I am sometimes even asked on this server to edit some stuff, like memes, for example. I really like doing it and would love to continue doing it for you guys. So, would it be possible to get a role in that regard or maybe just an announcement for it of some sort, just so people know they can ping me for this stuff?
Can a feature be added to Kirichan so she can play mp3s posted in music?
probably
And that's when the Fire Nation attacked
like on September 21st?
<:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>
Not every song is on YouTube, so I just wanted to know if it was possible.
Wait, we don't have a Serena role?
You're welcome
Like this?
I can do it right now
best bear
Yui also has good videos. The bears, of the gif variety
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that
How about flipping it around? Make her source on command.
I read that in Cell's voice
if you are on PC, you can also rightklick an emote and choose "open link". It will open the emote full size in your browser
I never lurk. I will post. But let me see what's what.
I will do just that. Have myself a little look-around
Absolutely. I love her. Team mom
of course.
Hi, everyone!
oh, a new friend!
only worked over edge. same link
Oh, a new face? Noice!
Like me, in case that was not clear
Hello!
Likewise, Pats, mostly because it is scrolled offscreen for me, as I frequent the hobbies and arts channels way more
Maybe, should you merge her with Shirabe, rename her to Finé for a few days before that. Just as a joke
that's good.
But that would mean Ryouko would die a second time.
I see a Zenbu bot coming posting nothing but Zenbu.
You came to the right place.
smol Kanade
Stay a while and listen
Welcome!

Wait, we have geahs?
I've known Artistic Yui for a while now. Not personally, but the stuff he does. He is a great guy.
I mean please
please
I aim to pleasure

enjoy your stay
amen
Small world we live in
But still a pleasant surprise
I mean, not fancy, as you are a Gear fan yourself.
Welcome, <@!142136901602770944> ! Fancy seeing you here.

we had our little problems with the bots
It's a bot, if it happened, it happened.
oh, yeah, they are a bit tiny
oh, you're returning?
<@!102691114762371072> do your thang
Welcome!
oh, a bubs. Welcome
welcome!
Oh ,another new member
I reckon we move that out of introductions
okay, I guess that turns into a general discussion slowly
Oh, me too, I just like Maria a lot more
it's just jest, don't worry. We are actually highly against waifu wars
Saki, you know what who I mean
G gave us the best character
oh, cool!
oh

We hope you like it here. Look around and enjoy

where are you from, if I might ask?
Hello, and welcome!
welcome!
hm, same naming convention as the previous user...
hello, new friend!
howdy
welcome
because there is no reaction to users joining
yeah, I have to correct myself. happens there too. It's just not as obvious
but strangely, it doesn't happen on other servers I am active in.
what's with the sudden influx of them?
and another bot.
oh, hello, new friend!!

click on one or more of the emotes in the last message to get the character added to your roles. you can pick your favorite like that.
<@456226577798135808> well, you type "dess_iam Color Me (Character name)" without the ". this will give you a color.
Heh, weebs
I think we have a few other French people in here.
Oh, cool
no excuse. we should always talk about Maria
Excuse me, but why are we not talking about Maria?
Nice name! Nice color! Welcome!

A channel for discussing figures and any form of non-symphogear craft such as gunpla or writing. Spoilers allowed.
look at the top
yes, it is
Or Ambience: A Fleet Symphony
Ever heard of The Subspace Emissary's Worlds Conquest?
looks very good.
Ame No Habakiri is just one name for a ton of swords: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totsuka-no-Tsurugi
otherwise, any DAW with 8-Bit vsts does the trick
<@189146272865845248> FamiTracker is a free to use program for that, you can create NES sounds with that.
true, all in due time
thanks!
anytime.
the songs "Zoe" and "To Town" are used in the game I am composing for.


here are some tunes of mine, so you get an idea of how the music would sound like and what synths I use.
oh, there are different versions?
By the way, I am currently hired as the composer for a video game. If your game needs some tunes, you know who to ask.
thank you!
<@!102691114762371072> how do you do the dess remind thing?
I don't know.
that's always a good plan. visualization can help a lot
very good, in fact
that sounds good
what genre will it be? strategy?
oh, yeah, don't rush it. take as much time as you need to gather every information and to flesh it out
interesting concept to base a game on
Oh, yes, I know a bit about that opera.
and then you don't need to copy anymore
your style forms with experience
Everyone does that.
Oh, and don't feel bad copying from the pros at the beginning.
so, you got the love for it, and a goal. those two pretty much guarantee that you will become a great artist soon. Just keep at it.
stick to it, love what you do, and you have no other choice than to become better at it. it happens automatically
I'd say so. All of it is dedication and love.
I did something similar with my music. I feel my stuff became a lot better after I switched to synthesizers
but if you feel it would help you a lot to go digital, then go for it
I'd say keep trying with traditional equipment first, just to get a feel for the matter.
It's definitely more convenient, as mistakes are easily fixed and changes can be done fast.
anytime. Just keep at it! The play with the perspective looks pretty good
simplistic, but not bad. Better then I can draw, for sure.

Todokete!
Honoka!
thank you!
when it's in the game, I put the song on soundcloud, too
means I get paid
I hope the creator of the game thinks so, too.
I wanted to add a pit of playfulness with the turnaround, too.
thank you!
glad to hear
<@247701824335904770> maybe you want to give it a listen.
I got another song done yesterday.
Hm, I'd like some more information about the characters. One little sentence is not really saying much, especially when it refers to other things in the story we don't know about. But I reckon the story is still in early planning stages.
Thank you!
Edelgard!!
<@!209126772069892096> I like it.
That's some cute design
Interesting match-up
BYLETH
So, I was able to finally add a new chapter to a RWBY fic I am writing.
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12797682/22/Three-s-A-Crowd
I never go here
true. I honestly forgot the channel exists.
okay, will do so from now on
thank you
<@!176830925949108224> indeed. I like it a lot. Have it since Christmas
I've played for around a month now, so I am not that good yet, but thanks
so, I wanted to share some of my guitar practice. No amp, as I just want to practice the movements. I am trying to get a hang of the F Major chord, especially in a progression, so I came up with this.
almost 38000 words. wow
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12797682/1/Three-s-A-Crowd
thanks, Matt
indeed it is, Cypher
this is the finished version, yes
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880> have you two heard this one yet?
I don't know if I ever shared that here, but this little tune was created from a bassline of a friend. I liked the demo he sent me a lot, so I just did my thing with it.
this theme I'm writing for a character in a game is coming along. I am thinking of adding an additional part to it, as I don't like how it basically repeats the A section
Not yet done, still some stuff to add and mix
Cool
Found the progression on my guitar
I don't know if you saw, but there is a longer version uploaded a bit later.
Thank you.
but like I said, some effects, some mixing
thank you. I still need to bring the drums into the foreground a bit, especially the kick
<@!84811738653929472>
okay, basic structure is done, just some more instruments, some effects, lead melody, and it should be done.
She beat him??
I still need a lead melody, but I think I already got an idea
thank you, Loris.
the pre-chorus and the chorus, yeah. that was the part where I knew I had to turn it into something
thanks!
the money thing is not at big of a deal for me, anyway. for one dev I contributed songs free of charge because I love his game so much
no worries.
it's basically from person to person different
oh no
a sheet?
sure
I work as a composer for games, so, yes, that's basically what I am getting paid for <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
not mixed yet, obviously
new tune I am working on.
<@!84811738653929472> new more developed version of my latest track
(sharing it here. I accidentally posted it in general)
A little tune I am writing currently. Modal mixture of A Minor and A Dorian. I like how it sounds so far
a song I shared a while back. added a melody
thanks!
I couldn't even put a fucking pixel on screen, let alone this
yeah
nah, I am a sucker for that kind of visual style
for real, I am impressed
oh that looks really fucking good! wow!
still need a name for it, though
<@!84811738653929472> I know you like my stuff, so I pinged you for it
and yes, because of that the song got over a minute longer
version 0.9, I guess. Added a coda
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164> this
well, beta 0.8, I guess. It is getting there.
thank you
that's honestly pretty cool. thanks
some idea I cooked up while practicing guitar
a variation of the theme I wrote for a character who was never finished and added into a game I compose for
consider it a perspective change in a way
kinda like after a stressful event or something, you take a step back and relax
yeah, that was my intention. basically, what I did was, I changed the chord progression. it stays in G# minor the entire time, but the last minute goes to a i bVI bIII bVII progression, and the melody above it plays in a B Major tonality, which uses the same notes as G# Minor. It's the relative scale. The first few minutes use a lot of minor chords and chromatic movements to create tension, the complete opposite of the last minute of the song.
Thank you very much, Cy.
thanks!
<@!84811738653929472> new track I am working on. I like how it turns out so far
this is a mad old track I made in 2007
<@!87512939107450880> <@!84811738653929472> It's done, I'd say
https://soundcloud.com/outside998/drive
thanks
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880> New version. Added a (reworked) bridge, but I am still not happy with how the song leads into it.
I like it already, too. I wonder where it will go from there
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880> new wip
which is why I like working with weird modes and time signatures
indeed
Honestly, I should maybe try and write music one could write lyrics too
maybe
oh, the terms are a beast you can tackle when you know your way around the basics
the bridge is in Dorian sharp 4, by the way
that's fine
of course, that's what preferences are, after all
my latest track
cool
a Harley Benton, a brand exclusive to a store I bought it in, house brand.
I got a guitar recently, and that song's chord progression was written on it
thank you
everything you hear in my music is from a synth
thanks
yeah, that's one where I actually knew what I was doing
and a recent one, a few weeks ago as comparison
<@!87512939107450880> <@!84811738653929472> nothing big, just something I threw together in a few minutes
God, I love Lego. I had so much stuff as a kid
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880> an unfinished track I found on my harddrive
I miss Lego
I will finish it. If I got a good mic, maybe I will record vocals
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880> trying my hands on something different today. A cover.
Thank you both
Okay, the violins and the arpeggios are added by me, but that's not that hard
I am just copying an already existing song. This is a cover.
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880> revision 2. all it needs now is the B section
right?
<@!84811738653929472>
<@!87512939107450880> this has to be the weirdest song I've ever written. Was just totally in the zone at the end there. I don't feel it's quite done yet, though
I don't own any, mostly because their products don't interest me
got an audio interface, I can now record my guitar directly
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880>
tried around with my guitar effects a bit
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880> something a bit different. maybe I'll change some stuff later
thank you!
now I want to write a more fun, uplifting song
thanks
somehow I had to lighten the mood
gets weirder
that's what I meant
right?
you don't need to be an expert to say you like or don't like something. Especially music <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
<@!87512939107450880> <@!84811738653929472> so, I was listening to my own music on my way to work today and saw that I had this track I never did anything with.
The evolution of the artstyle looks really good
<@!87512939107450880> <@!84811738653929472> new thing I found on my guitar. could turn into something
oki
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880> another track I found I never finished. Maybe I should sometime
still a wip
I know
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880> it is getting there. Happy how to shapes up so far
just practice, but thank you very much
oh thank you
wizard level?
Finally, after almost a goddamn year, I updated my RWBY fanfic. Enjoy
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12797682/1/Three-s-A-Crowd
Thank you!
Thank you
<@!84811738653929472> <@!87512939107450880> worked a bit more on the song "dread". still not quite happy with it. But so far it's coming along.
oh sorry I didn't ping you
found that while jamming on my guitar
<@!87512939107450880> here it is again, sorry, posted it in general
forgot to put it in the right channel
and thank you both
I am trying to try different things, expanding my horizons, so to speak
<@!84811738653929472> new wip
<@!87512939107450880> new wip, trying something ominous
<@!87512939107450880> new version of the video game piece I am writing
is it something you are dedicated to? An idea you wanted to write for years? If so, do it. If it was just a "meh, I could." maybe see if the idea could be ported over to another fandom.
I uploaded a track of mine to YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD4bRPpl6xs
thank you for the kind emote. I am still figuring out how to go from there
this is the right channel
so, I started using my guitar in my songs. not perfect (I only really play for a bit over a year) but I like it.
I complied my recent tracks into an album. If anyone is interested, here is the rar archive link:
https://mega.nz/file/w2QSFZgA#hAgYeBoWgyXx_15doh2XcmwpPoTlybd4I4CBWXsFAjw
thanks!
new track!
https://soundcloud.com/outside998/eve
that's a nice style
I hope you like them
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
second one:
https://mega.nz/file/w2QSFZgA#hAgYeBoWgyXx_15doh2XcmwpPoTlybd4I4CBWXsFAjw
posting links to two of my albums.
first one:
https://mega.nz/file/N6IAiCKb#LEc5fkBfDQtXWvialdP3jbDTRedeHMHej622bmOEtM8
I am also working on this
thanks
<@331908049822547978> I don't know if you are interested, but I am working on a new tune
I should get a carpet
This is the song I was thinking of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlM4XX5XXls
thanks!
there is, yeah. for steam too, I believe
it's pretty good. But there is one track in the game your song immediately reminded me of. And I can't even remember which one
The way the chord progression of your song goes and the voice leading reminds me of Secret Of Mana for some reason
thanks
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
and while we are on the topic of music, I am currently working on this:
<@266379640069685252>I prefer your version. It's has this fun early 90s platformers vibe.
So, I finally got a new chapter for a RWBY fanfic I am working on done.
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12797682/1/Three-s-A-Crowd
This was supposed to be a theme for a character of the VN I am composing for. I think I kind of missed the mark there.
Interesting aproach. I worked a bit more on it today. It got a bit darker in the process
working on a song. I like how it develops so far
best of both worlds
best ship
I was blind, but now I see.
Point well made, but let me show you a compelling argument:
Literally perfect
the second one is bigger. not on discord. open the original link
they are cute and gay
Maybe I will take you up on that ping sometime
See you.
It does.
I uploaded a Maria wallpaper for Wallpaper Engine a few weeks back
oh, wow, that's... impressive
Classy vampire
Seems like I have to step up my game here
Impressive
could be more
I have like 60 Maria pics.
cool
Dude! Persona 5 is an amazing game
Seras Victoria is great. Had her as my discord avatar for the longest time. seras is also my account name on Funnyjunk




Oh, but of course.
two sumo wrestlers sizing each other up.
noise ain't no person
same here
The only person that would be taller than me is Adam.
Kirika is taller than Chris. Huh.
182cm
none.

the edge
and suplex that building
pikapika
Don't know the context, it just should
Hair style swapping should happen in the show
noise?
that actually looks really good.
all grown up
post.



Now that is a pic I can approve of
Maria too precious
not Maria!
you stop that!
NO!!
no bulli!
tasty maria
first one 764px × 1.024px, second 1.567px × 2.100px
no, they are different
I got some as well
but the original is great, yes
the german dub was total ass.

come here, Mio...
boo
that was disestablished when I was about to get drafted.
I know it from a buddy of mine, he is a soldier
same in ours.
(I never been in the military)
never bend the wrist
came to mind when i read dream
a hunter is a hunter, even in a dream
Cut my life into pieces...
I am the eggman
I wonder what she is singing


and hope


Worth it, it looks amazing
I love that edit


OTP

Shota Aoi did an amazing job voicing her, too
boop the butt
She is fun, yeah
Cag is the definition of that word
My reaction basically
I was so done after that.
"Tsubasa, where are you? I can't see you."
you wanna know what really fucked me up?
Genjuro can beat anyone. The only thing that holds him back is that he can't touch Noise.
Kanade in a kimono is very nice, I have to admit
looks like shadow
the lighting
<@!246146781832806401> I hope you like

I was at the age limit to get drafted back when they got rid of that. Pretty cool.
yeah
July 1st 2011
let me look it up
A few years ago.
Zenbu?
the only bot I see is ryouko
like me
I can do it too, I have all the files and photoshop
do it
We need an edit of an off-model Maria from G with "My city now"
And she found happiness, finally. Wife and daughter
could you imagine Fate in the Symphogear universe
It was there all along!
Being meguca is suffering.
They are magical girls, of course!
Kyubey told us from the beginning!
It all makes sense!
wait, suffering? OH MY GOD!
Who is more genki? Bikkie or Kiri?
Every look is a good look for Maria as long as she is not crying in sadness.
Protect
That smile bottom left, first picture
I have not seen them yet
Maria = Jigglypuff confirmed
because their fists collided
no survivors
The gut punch she gave Maria was nasty.
twin tail basa has to happen
I was just about to post that pic
yeah, looks nice
oh, I completely missed that pic
how about even shorter hair? like Hibiki or shorter?
not just a regular meme...
and get massacred
And then they find out they are geese
I like the last Jiirabe
now it's art
why is Maria so shocked? Was she unaware that Kiri can sleep?
look what I did
In case you were wondering what they said
"Maria, can I take it off already? Can I? Seriously, can I?" "You can't." "Wha..."

That's how Tsubasa claimed her. She just grabbed her and walked away


you're welcome
And the last one


and Airgethlam
Where is Ame No Habakiri?
no, just downloaded
Nude Hibiki spotted
but yeah, I know my way around it now
Oh, I had that pic before I downloaded your collection.
She looks like a little monkey.
oh, two of those are supposed to be her feet, it seems. That's weird
Why is that pic so cute? And why does she have four hands?
do it, embrace it. I did as well.

Some dude was interviewed about the extreme weather they were having, and he was out out with is girlfriend. He said that he liked weather like that because going out with your significant other gives him "that special feeling". That line was so unbelievably cheezy that his girlfriend hid her face in shame. And that's how the meme was born.



yeah, just like that
It's from a news broadcast about the fidget spinner craze. Some kids got interviewed and one of them stared into the camera while spinning his spinner with a blank expression. When it was broadcasted in Japan, the japanese internet went insane and memed it to death.
You guys know the story behind that pic?
"Damn, you live like this?"
<@279341087494242304> Well, Gen is Chris' adoptive dad, so we are two thirds there.
I'm thinking. I could write fanfics.... I love writing.
Symphogay, right?
obviously
I am a yuri fan myself
not just symphoyuri, mind you
I got a bit
I know. I am thinking...
Just pics
Yuri?
we'll see
hm, full of meme I can do.
I can't do anything, that's why Topdad would be perfect
I don't know!!
seems like I have to step my reddit game up
Well, Discord is a definite.
such as?
a practical joke
I still like the idea for giving me the Topdad role that does absolutely nothing
cat girl is fine, just this constant verbal tic thing
the sound
I never understood the nya appeal

will do
the reactions were gold
Me on Funnyjunk talking about Symphogear.
I was looking for that pic in my folder, ibu. you were faster


I can get behind that.
Berserk puppy Hibiki.
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>  Me like
You are right! Saddle the horses
Well, seems like I found what I am going to do the next few days
would that be something for the reddit?
and a good Maria
That's a good Kanade.

Man, Maria looks stylish!
Biki fall? The sun is falling!!!! Run!!!

oh, I got it. I made a similar pun, after all
That's a lot of echo.

And I meant it like it sounded
I wanna drown in Maria...
True, Hibiki gets posted a lot less.
Trust me, I will never betray the perfection that is Maria Cadenzavna Eve.
But I can't just post Maria all the time. I like all the gears, after all. I just love Maria a lot more.








right here

OTP



Those Persona outfits look really nice on them
Does someone have that cute little group picture used for the background of the subreddit?
Kiri mad! Kiri smash!
not enough
Well, over 500 Maria pics now.
I am afraid of what's coming.
whoever they are
4. The rest
3. Gungnir Maria
2. Maria as a child
1. Maria
For me it's:
wow, I am honored
I honestly am spending enough money as is each month
Received. Necessary steps taken. Picture saved. Status green.
Yeah, but no big deal. I had a rope
Maria was posted and I was not informed? An outrage! Outrage, I tell you!
at times? She is always adorable
Have a gif.
Whose footprints are these?
I should really fresh up my japanese
"What should I do now?" Is that correct?
Doushita monka dess.
that makes sense
right, the left one is mo
de?
yeah
or, rather,do?
To?
I can't for the life of me read the first hiragana. Is it su? Fu?
Stand name: Queen Of Hearts

or wanting to cuddle and squeeze it.
yeah, like wanting to pinch a baby's cheeks.
humans are weird
There is also something called cute aggression.
that's news to me
yeah, heard about that.
Oh, like viewing cute pics makes you behave more caring and stuff?
Well, Maki can play the piano...
On point.
Nico x Maki LL OTP
exactly
^ this
They are all cute
nothing weird here
Why? Maki is cute.
But oki ^^
did not think it was that explicit
you think? okay.
Chris x Spaghetti, never forgetti
There are actually fan discussions about the inclusion of a new character  simply to give Chris a girlfriend
She is a free spirit
colorized
as the pic name states
the party crasher
"I thought we were full homo!"
But honestly, I could see Tsubasa being dense when it comes to flirting
That must sting
Just in case
I bet she is wearing her sexiest underwear.
Sitting there, next to her girl
Maria looks so happy and excited. It's so cute
could be, never watched Kamen Rider. Yugioh was just the first thing that came to mind.
It's time to d-d-d-d-dddddd duel!
angry cat
lunch

you know it
Okay, real talk: Maria with her hair down is the best thing ever.
jaka jan
we are above those petty jokes
Well, not that could have made it any longer. It was a dumb little joke, after all.
It was fun
I did not write the fic for nothing


My heart

Shirabe.exe knows her stuff

oki, will do just that
cool
ha, gottem
I apologize
oh, I was unaware
<@!263983345669505025> He, Ibrahim
Okay, 700 Maria pics now

the absolute lass
<@!127644949884698624> That's that weird garbage with Windows creating the activation based on the hardware. Change too much and bam! windows yells you have to reactivate. It sucks.
My wallpaper
<@!246146781832806401>

for real? because I reckon that taking a lot longer than she needs to find source
Shirabe.exe is using the weird id thing that every image has to find the source, right?
Thanks, Shirabe
Here it is
I got one of her being super buff.

Maria gif? The one from the opening?
Buff Maria is my fetish, I tell you what



Tsubasa Eve
Oh, Maria's wife. Nice
and i have 710 pics
True, but I was more talking about it being anything but Maria.
What else would it be, right? Kinda obvious.
My phone background is this:
"I thought you said we would grind together."

>straight
She is the most mature one out of the team, honestly. So, if Maria is team mom, what would Basa be?
Hopefully we get more Basa. She is a great character.
damn
Weird, you're right. There aren't a lot of people in the Basa role in general, it seems.
yep. Tsubasa was standing there and I thought: Pats is a Basa fan, so why not
I know. That's why this exists:
yep
Oh, yeah?
new meguca material
I wanna watch it too.

but more so there
She is always adorable.
yawning Maria is adorable.

that's the name, yes
So, she goes simply by image? Interesting
the id does not change if one changes the filename, it's like a checksum. That's why I thought

oh, i get it
oh, okay
Pixels on silicon? I don't get it.
Oh, yes, Pierce being Chris would be amazing
There, I fixed it
I need a mod to swap the boss and Shaundi with Tsubasa and Maria
perfect intro to a game
the pic is just flipped
yeah, and head first
they are actually falling
no, but she is a sword. and a sword is strong all over
I reckon if she can grip the bike with her thighs her neck is strong enough to deal with this weight.
And lets not forget that the center of mass is below her hands.
Maria has to be stronger if she lifts her and the bike
Or, as a commenter on Dynasty Scans said: Maybe Maria's just lifting Tsubasa and the bike through Tsubasa's head, with Tsubasa holding onto the bike with her hands and thighs?
Don't worry, Tsubasa is doing a flip over her head, will jump of it in midair as the bike flies into a parking spot. And THEN in explodes.
who doesn't know Dynasty Scans? Quality yuri

That was a nice scene
But what about Tsubasa carrying Maria?
princess carry in general is nice
"waterfall in my pants"
I like the: "We've been over this." I can imagine that happens every week or so.
I love that conversation




I think so, yeah
But it just fits.
I know it's a reference.
Chris' reaction is so her.
very
oh, oh, busted!
What made her so angry?

while she ushers in a new world order
so she stops her from fighting to keep her by her site
the reason for that is that she honestly loves Bikkie and knows that her plan could kill her.
and why she still looks so young
She  made herself into an autoscorer later, explaining how she can run so fast and throw so far
Miku is actually German! She founded the Bavarian Illuminati and birthed Carol!
or it turns out that she was the mastermind behind everything!
No, she was manipulated. I meant legit villain, with motivation and all. Out of her own volition
could you imagine Miku turning into a villain in S5?


sleep tight
that should be a punishable offence

of course
If someone uses it, it should a pic of a gear giving the middle finger.
but with a twist
do we have a dab command?
because phones are weird.
I ruined everything!
damn

coot
^
Okay, I will now make it my mission to give pics weird and goofy names. Let's see how long I will keep it up
The kawaiiness shook the earth in its core
yeah, it looks like Miku's shoulder is somewhere behind her.
yeah, whenever I see someone draw, on stream and such... amazing what they can do.
but only for editing, can't draw worth crap
I use it too
nice!
what software are you using?



She just loves her wife too much
***CUTE!***
CUTE!
no biggie
<@!81815015224516608> Does this suffice?
her love juices
he ranted on his own server a bit about how he could never cuddle with Kanade
You don't have to yell at me...
Careful. I was asked to post that in nsfw, as Basa is groping

Hibiki the player

Do you think Miku would go on a rampage if anything really happens to Hibiki?


jk
party pooper
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752> cool

Blessed image
the styling and such
especially the way it's designed
her hair looks really nice, yeah

story of my life
it was bad
I was joking
That's not a lock screen, those are bagel bites
your default is Kanade
I am sorry for ruining your enjoyment of Chris eating, but it was necessary.

That Chris smile is precious.
This is my phone background
It's Maria, ain't nothing plain about that.
My phone lock screen.
Look at how perfect she is!


I'd love to see her like that in the actual show. Where my stronk grills at?

I reckon Bikkie is more raw power, and Basa technique
of course
oh, yes!
I honestly don't remember a training montage in G
thanks
which episode?
Really?
I'd love to see more of Maria power action.
I know

but where are the muscles? The biceps and stuff?
I would like if Hibiki was visually muscular in the show. I mean, she suplexed a space shuttle, for fucks sake.
I assumed she looks at pics, misses them and cries. I am too pure.
everything BUT standard? that's weird
why?
That gives me a story idea...
Maria fangirling is so cute

I like her clothes in this. Very casual.

Great minds think alike

cute

En garde!
Great team, great dynamic.
Because they compliment each other perfectly.
Why is TsubaMari so perfect?


Women are nice, yes

According to some weird study apparently 80% of heterosexual women have bisexual tendencies.
Or bi.


slap da bass
full frontal assault
Is she assaulting or getting assaulted? <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
That looks absolutely amazing
OH MY GOD I LOVE IT!
But honestly, the gif is edited. It does not look like that in the show
REEEEEEE<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>

How can she be so perfect?
What are the two fighting about?
Damn, that's cool.
cute


Kanade got guns, damn

Shirabe is drunk
absolute perfection

regarding Bikki's scar: I remember LL SIF having a similar mess up with Maki's eyes in one art work. They were blue instead of purple
maybe it's self defense
like, they adopted her in their early 20s as a little girl
I was thinking maybe a little into their 30s.
how old would Basa and Maria be?
with all the teenager antics and stuff?
so they take care of a 17 year old Chris?
I got the Momria AU conversation downloaded, by the way. I will do that.
Fanfic material. Mombasa and Momria taking care of Chibi Chris


but they could have done more with him
true
He had so much potential
the way they got rid of torchwick was ass
spoilers allowed ^^
top of the channel
Cinder is my fav villain, simply because she offed Pyrrha
Boring, whiny and irrelevant
the worst character in RWBY in my opinion is Pyrrha.
it's entertaining, nothing more
but, don't go in it expecting amazing shit
It's good
Yang is my fav in RWBY. I am wearing a Yang shirt right now, in fact
Why is Basa embarrassed? Should she not be used to have her pictures taken as an idol?
Everybody Loves Chris, thursday on CBS.
Because lonely otakus
That little typo in the picture of Basa and Maria brushing their teeth...
Maria is so classy, it's almost illegal


a hair problem Maria
a cute Maria

Midnight Club is Rockstar. EA would not get near it
I meant a new entry in the series.
who was talking about remakes?
yes
They should make a new one
mad old
carefully
Why is sword crying?
Carol?
I'd watch the fuck outta that.
shut
symphogear.jpg
here it is
If your source is on Pixiv, Nijie, Nico Nico Seiga, Pawoo, or deviantArt, she'll find it! Probably.
like deviantart and such
shouldn't Shirabe now look for other sources?
not that he was better in the early seasons
whiny angsty teenager
Chris has a bigger arsenal than some armies. Damn.
you are forgiven
Why was I not informed about a Maria posting?




the grim reaper?
Who is she marrying?

It's amazing. The only anime of which I own the BluRays.
ever watched Black Lagoon?

Have this then
let me shitpost in peace!

(I did not really)
I blocked him everywhere
My cousin watched the first season back in the day, by the way. He did not like the show
I don't know if that would work. The joke of the video goes over heads of people who have never watched the show.
best video ever
Perfect gif, Kerrik
man, now i want to see her playing the accordion.
would be even better if Maria was serbian
Now that I talked about her, I can't get Revy off my mind
her leg just falls off
with every landing you can hear the cracking of the bone.
the fall must have been really bad when they had to remove her leg
That reminds me of the MASH episode "Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind."
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Did Miku lose her leg?
I could see it fit her.
honestly, a symphogear that just lobs grenades would be awesome.
great argument enders, honestly
her backside, yeah<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Is Hibiki looking at her butt?
oh, leans over
how so?
His half-brother was treated like shit by his mother and her former husband. She beat him and stuff
Palette cleanser!
He could have had it so much better
His mother is a hoarder and the house he lives is is dirty beyond believe.
His father thought doctors would just put his son in a straight jacket. He did not know how autists are treated nowadays
Yeah. I blame his parents for everything that happened. If he got professional help everything could have been prevented
Oh, and while in the topic, there is a really interesting documentation about him, currently 12 episodes long.
That Chris-Chan image in inaccurate. She has no parents anymore.
recently bought Just Cause 3 with all DLC for 6,74€. Damn good purchase.
I only bought what I had interest in. I got some games gifted, though.
You know it
Me as well. I still have a load of PS1 games, PS2 games, X-Box 360 and PS4. And of course over 100 Steam games.

I also only own one manga series, and that's five volumes: Girl Friends.
I rarely buy that stuff.

Momria

Two kids fighting

unless there are roofies in there
Ship? SHIP? She is just handing her a wark drink!


They are holding hands in the second panel, by the way
I know what I said, that was the point
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
"each other's lips with your tongues?"
I bet she knows what's going on when she does not get a reply in five minutes
The next message from her will be "Message me when you're done inspecting each other's teeth with your tongues."
"Sorry, I got a sudden case of the gay. I'll hit you up later."



Still one of my favorites.


she is best
I only got one girl. The one that matters.
science babies is the greatest tag to ever exist
they have kids? New headcanon

Same, just reminded me
Remember this?
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Nah, don't be. <#336297808221044736> exists for a reason.
oh, okay, I thought something was up with the art or artist or whatever<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
you mean to nsfw?
why would they?
very good
I hope there is a Maria one
Done
Imma fix it
The extra T in "Schatz" still bugs me.
We just need more gears then
you know it
cutest Maria
DO NOT CAPITALIZE "VOR"!!! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>

the answer to that was in the pixiv link, by the way
yep
Taya*Ma*Tofu
Tayama Tofu. A manufacturer of Tofu in Japan.

having Chris as a cat would be very taxing

i remember reading a comment of a guy who legit thought the censorship was legit because of laws and not a joke.


REMOVE KANADE
MARIA STRONG
looks good, Saki
wait, you can customize that icon?
I only have a Maria folder

<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
that is not nice
Protective Miku is funny and great
Wasn't it "The Drill That Pierces The Heavens"?
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
and Nep on the right
headpat
only headpat
Of course it's small, Elfnein is tiny herself.
no, just posting
and people say perfect images don't exist

see ya
and soft
and very sensitive
that must have been a big knee
busted!!!
fideldeedee
That second to last one: "When your friends are not dead."
we pay her in Kiri pics, so she better



Ver was on drugs 24/7
I like this edit too

I made a horrible mistake
I think so
Look at this cute couple
damn, that's a cool Maria pic
it's beautiful
I love it
This is my favorite pic

I feel like there is a pun in there I am not getting



Wow, looks good

Mustang and Hawkeye are big shoes to fill.
Yuru Yuri was relaxing and funny
Alice should pin WFC's pic, honestly
can channels have avatars? because that should be it for sfw
Best ship
cool, thanks

I want that
A Maria Persona


Blessed image



tickle fight


look at this cutie
Ratchet
she had a bad dream and now needs her moms
still one of the cutest pics out there

Never quenched indeed
I live for it
that gay stuff
Beware the quiet ones

That image is cursed, wfc
Blessing
I am happy
I love menacing Maria
damn, R, that avatar is great
100% the truth <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Why is she so perfect?
Momria and her daughters

she is gay, yes

can't even remember
I have not played the game for a long time
oh
her abs are legit

While we're posting Love Live stuff
cute Harus
Won't happen again
Yeah, was just a stupid meme that just came into my mind as response to Kerrik's post
no problem
oki
want me to delete it?
Memes are great
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>


gentle femdom?

even smoler Elfnein
I wanna see family moments between Gen and Chris
cool collection of Carol artwork
Thanks, Saki. I forgot she could do it.
like this?

She would not be a sword, she'll be a fist
Maria wears a fake Ame No Habakiri.
Chris doesn't dess
gear
cosplay
or they switch gears
a cosplay episode
Chris looked really cute in the armor.
Chris, please. Think of the children
one of her songs, I should say
Good use of a line from her song, by the way
"Just get fucked"
I like Chris' message.
oh, yeah, I got them too
She is cuddly and cute
Maria more so
That Maria pic was lovely.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
wow, that's beautiful
Protect
Absolutely perfect
Finé was the f-word
I think so, yes, she is "just" sinless now
fanfic idea: Bikki is inhumanly strong even without gear, and she can't control her strength, leading to all kinds of funny and goofy scenarios
Hibiki never said fuck because she never had a reason. She just punches everything that annoys her, making it disappear instantly
Miku is a nice girl. Until she gets angry.
the experienced lion knows when to hide its claws
one of my ex girlfriends was that type. Well spoken, polite, but as soon as we were alone in bed and went down to business she had a potty mouth like you would not believe
how about in bed
Interestingly, I curse more when I speak English than German
I'd be in regular
Maria has hidden depts. I bet as soon as she is really angry she will curse up a storm. But never in front of the kids

I just *had* to do it.
natural fighters
Basa must be happy
Damn, Maria still looks rockin' 8 years from now
absolutely
Haru too pure

Haru x Makoto is kinda cute, even though I have no idea how the ship came to be. But that's shipping for you.
The one with the main six in their colors needs to be bigger. It would make for an amazing wallpaper
Hey, look, it's R!
toned Maria is a gift
oh, I especially like the last two before the HAT!
Real Maria hours
Maria Cottoncandy Eve
best girl every day, every hour
a VERY good time
it was a good time
protect that smile!
Maria is cold! Hot chocolate alert!
sure. hook up the hdd on a pc and mod away
Maria as Maria. There has to be a mod for that
couldn't tell you, sorry
found it!
it's a screen cap from a scene of the blonde girl holding two buns of what ever, and they have those words written over them
oh, the "satirical joke, offensive meme" girl
but it would be a crime not to do it
Not true, of course

wait! I forgot the obligatory meme!
new meme aquired
Troll Kanade
unlimited potential







build your own sun
is that a pocket Maria?
I can't understand all of it, but what I can read fills my heart with a weird, strange feeling. is it... warmth?
Far Cry did it amazingly
but flight controls in 5 with keyboard and mouse? Holy hell, no. How could they fuck that up so badly?
4's vehicle controls were wonky in general
imo
worst part of the game
gta sa. the flight school
flight school

Phrasing!
Spyro 2
it better
Bad memories, i reckon




I just want to make dumb jokes, not kill someone
look up a bit, I made a lot of those edits, making her say the most outrageous stuff
I'm curious what <@!246146781832806401> thinks about the meme
I will milk it for all its worth



Hibiki in One Piece
okay.
what is it even refering to?




of course I will
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Good idea
exercising Maria is tasty

preach it!
A fellow soldier
ah, super hero villain. no wonder I did not know him
Yori, I actually made a lot of those edits earlier
I have no idea who Drakseid is
maybe we are the same person, just different personalities
I will
ouch, that sounds nasty

never
what's your favourite so far?
this meme is a powerful weapon
Even Kanade knows
she is so adorable and lovely
No, Maria is number 1, dammit!
I mean, I probably count as ten fans, but still, not enough
But what about the best girl, Maria?
How many Kirika fans do we have on this server now?`
last one, I promise

Kiri, stay out of this!
maybe not outplayed, I just posted a lot today. let's give it time to calm down
trust me
I will run it into the ground with 200mph.

excuse me?
Fall?
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I just realized I made 31 different variations of this dumb meme
Well, maybe Shirabe should learn how to handle stress
I prepared something for a certain event
Gungnir combo
EVERYTHING!
I will break
you okay?

Variation of a theme


It was a joint effort. I posted a lot of memeage
So, what you're saying is Shirabe needs a nap
RED ALERT!
MAYDAY!
you know it

I was nice
a bit over 30 of those are just me memeing
oh oh
Oh, hi, Saki
wow, that outfit change looks very interesting
maybe you got some blank frames inbetween
<@!441163888382443521> ask him when he is online the next time
perfect
Hangar 16
no one is safe
soon we'll take over the entire internet
you're welcome
nice
He loves Chris now
I converted a friend of mine to Symphogear
Preach it, brother
<@!142136901602770944> new bear, of the Kirika variety.
has Nick seen it?
now it looks great
I'll take 40
oh god that's adorable
She is misunderstood!
Justice for Maria!


Maria's kids are well-behaved. Basa needs to step her game up

what perspective? the shadows indicate the two are directly at the wall.
and is it the same wall Hibiki kabedons Chris on? If so, why is she so tiny?
I wonder, why is Miku running through a wall in that pic posted by Kerrik a few hours ago? Is she jealous? trying to save Chris? Does she want to join?

best fic I ever wrote

BUTT!!
but I'd rather warm Maria than the other way around
maybe a bit
memes for days
oh, you know it!
that's even cuter
PROTEINS!!!
even more of an incentive to write the Momria fic
Child Chris is adorable
even better!
oh, it's tart
Give Chibi Maria her icecream!
It's not necessarily funny. You can't force that.
I just write stupid stuff.

spin to win
like a big goodbye? yeah, could work
no problem with 9 to 5 jobs, but idols don't work 9 to 5
I'd prefer at least one being home to give the child a proper home, love and childhood
you really think they would both still go on tour and stuff? I'd reckon one retires from the stage if that happens
actually. Basa having a child would be kinda cute
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
get that het shit off my screen!!
CURSED!
WHAT IS THIS?
Baguette
Senran Kagura fan. Good. Renka as daki. Also very good
life size plushie
& Knuckles
& Son Gohan
Do you expect a little child to have wine?
No, it was wine
I believe so.
Hibiki is like always: "Gohan?"
too cute
My reaction to that pic
I wanna see abs
Maria should be more toned in her sports outfit.
HAT! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
oh, Mama
cursed
Do you guys think Maria would be the violently jealous type?
Tsubasa with Child!Chris is so adorable
oh, tasty Maria
That's such a cute pic.
He really is. But that's why he is our dad.
Shoutouts, by the way
don't forget Oatmeal
It also was the only thing Yui related I could think of
People talked about Yui, so I just thought: "why the hell not?". Your stuff is funny and entertaining, after all.
I love his stuff.
On the topic of Yui: https://www.youtube.com/user/bulletproof750
you don't need a reason for HibiMiku
Meme material

The only road that I have ever known
God, I am starting to sound like wfc
I prefer her tall. better to hug and cuddle her
A tiny Maria?
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Maria is perfection
usually is not always. I can't blame you for that
Where did I criticize you? It's not like you make those pics
and those are just a few. Maria is very underappreciated
you see, that's the thing: I have all of those.
wallpaper sized Maria artwork, like 1080p, is surprisingly rare, yeah
no worries. they are really hard to come by for some reason
I'd love some amazing Maria wallpapers
Modding has come a long way
is that form CM3D2?
that "Maria is pregnant and Basa is the (other) happy mom" pic is cute.
She isn't forcefed. She likes it a lot, she just does not like getting her picture taken during.
That's the million dollar question
Dashing, at least
Who could this be?
I got 1038 Maria pics
No, strength and beauty > cuteness
My waifu is stronger than yours
I believe you posted the wrong pic
Yes, right here.
Hey, look who it is. It's best girl!
What a thrill
You know it
Those pics warm my heart. Make me want to write a wholesome slice of life MariBasa fic
Maria x Basa OTP
EVEN BETTER!
Much better
CURSED!
Don't worry, Basa, Maria will share her bed with you.
We will figure something out, like I said.
yep
I thought about streaming it, like in rabbit
no, but he lives in Albuquerque, and I live in Germany. Time zones...
We are currently working something out. Dropbox or something
He hasn't even watched the show yet, he just really loves her design
and another Chris pic for my buddy
Chris and Basa are fighting? The kids are at it again...

what about gears being fueled by the users blood or sweat or whatever? No, wait, that sounds like a fetish
would be a cool concept. Not traditional vampires, but in a way that they have to use some kind of external consumable source to fuel their gears. Like Kill La Kill with the blood of the wearer and stuff
safety dess
That neck biting <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
and pretty much the same in concept
Like every second part in a series: Not as good as the first one.
I've seen so much stuff nothing phases me anymore really
meh, whatever floats ones boat
that's Custom Maid 3D 2
you mean the gear models in 3d?



lewder
*wink*
for you
it can be
But cute regardless
Not Maria, so not best
Maria is too gay for this shit.
Magnum Opus!
Momria AU with Elfnein being her daughter. That's it!
Elfnein is a fucking adorable cinnamon roll
the imbeds worked for me
those are some really cute hairstyles. especially the one top left
best couple
oh, yes, the great waifu war of '93. There were no heroes. Only survivors
just jesting
we don't.
Maria is always my number one
~~not anymore~~
nothing
Oh, Maki! Very nice
sensory overload
too cute for Maria
Is that a chibi blob Maria up there?
good ship
Kerrik is the master of pics. Everything posted by someone else was already posted by him
make your own Chris
She is the favorite character of one of my buddies. Although he really likes Tsubasa too now that he started watching the show. Still weird to talk with him about it, as Chris' name is half of my first name.


Lady Maria Of The Astral Gay Tower

it's a yon-koma, updated one page a day
I hope so, it's a great read
http://mangakakalot.com/manga/tomochan_wa_onnanoko
Tomo-chan Wa Onna No Ko
Tomo-chan is a gift
Tomboy!!
not that bad
but you'd need a uplay account
I would love to give it away, honestly
like I said, I already have the game
if they do that, it's pointless.
it seems like I'll get a code after going to the site
hm, wait
the instructions told me to go to amdrewards.com
it came with my graphics card
nope
because I got a free code for Far Cry 5, but I already have the game
hm
Quick question: anyone here familiar with the site amdrewards?
some kind of editor role or what ever
Honestly, why not.
guess I need a memer role or something
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I maybe could have done it a bit better, but it looks okay
<@209896097026408449> Enjoy
I can, give me a minute
Kiri is rocking those glasses, damn.

you'll get it
was on the phone, sorry
<@!102691114762371072> you will get your Kiri, give me a second
Chris presents best girl


there you go, Latooni

It's perfect

hm, maybe
yeah
I know the 3D effect makes the boobs stand out.
No, PC version
I also like how she was very prominently featured in Pirate's Curse, so the player gets to know her better. I always liked Risky, but PC made love her
hell yes.
you could zipzoom and jumpyjump everywhere
I have to agree, Latooni, the movement in Pirate's Curse was amazing
I own every Shantae game and finished them too.

it really was
R with the good taste
you should see her in her space princess outfit
Boots
Both
Have I ever told you guys about the Queen of the Seven Seas, Risky Boots?
I always thought it was mainly a cartoon
see, I did not even know that it's something you can read as well
I never watched Homestuck
Who is most hated?
Momria can handle it

Top Dad is sexy, dude.
Means more Maria for me
Just jesting, you can like whoever you want
DON'T THINK I DON'T HEAR WHEN SOMEONE SAYS MARIA IS NOT BEST
WHATTTTT!!!!!!

hugs for wife

I imagine that happened during the little training scene with Genjuro in AXZ. He and the other girls are just looking at them all shocked. "Em... Maria? Tsubasa? You know we are still here, right?"
we all know how it is: you're goofing around with your SO and all of a sudden you check each other's teeth with your tongues
How long until they start making out?
Human (well, more human) Marina? Nice
the eater or the one eaten?
She's gonna get eaten <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

It appeases to me too
I see Maria there
pardon?
Basa is right, Maria is cute
B: "Maria, are you awake?"
M: "I am now. What do you want?"
B: "Let's have sex."
M: "Go the fuck to sleep."

Why isn't Yuudachi allowed to go outside during rain? Let her enjoy it.
Rotty is cool, but for me Risky all the way
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
And I like that they like each other
Nah, x intensifies is stale
I like that
*stares disapprovingly
well, "loaded"...
AND GAY!
EVERYONE IS FEMALE!
fuck it
make them female.

no problem, Dragon.
<@!99158582326497280> Hibiki and Kiri: "Solar Flare!" (the move from Dragon Ball, also known as Taiyoken)
Shirabe: "Gaah..."
Miku: "My eyes, my eyes!"
Chris: "What are you guys doing?"
Hibiki is Madoka's Stand? Okay, that's cool.
with hopefully more to follow
Kiwami is coming
Yakuza 0, yes
All of it!
Play it!
Amen!
Oh fuck yeah! Yakuza!!
"I just wanted to ask if I could..."
"YOU CAN CATCH THESE HANDS!"
and the Devil is like: "okay. Jesus..."
"Nope, not dealing with that dude."
being so pissed that the reaper is not coming near you
Man literally too angry to die
*anger fucktuples in size
oh, like calm down

<@!225771411833225216> SG represents

Wait, I got something for that.
Shirabe!!
Shirabe, give me source
But all the TsubaMari in the world would not be enough
I need more Maria x Basa
Maria is a player
When they say Maria is just okay.
She is beautiful
Just look
Perfect

I never liked Heartcatch
non-sympho, however
Suddenly her friends fight against her. They know her, love her, and know of her abilities
A Cure getting corrupted would be an amazing plot point
The Doki Doki team is right in the middle
I have a wall scroll of the second All Star movie on my wall
I liked the dynamic it created. Regina, the  "daughter" of the big bad, in love with one of the heroes who are supposed to destroy him.
I liked how gay it was. Nobody can tell me Regina was not in love with Mana.
I really like that season.
My favorite, and I know I may be alone with that one, was Doki Doki
burned out, maybe
over 40 episodes a season can not be easy to fill
Maybe the show is just too long for the plot
KiraKira just did not work for me
same here
that shows how much I have missed since Mahotsukai
man
Cure Whip.
looks familiar, latooni. where is she from?
absolutely
That was a good season
Cool!
Kanade from Suite PreCure?
She is honestly my first waifu
God, do I love Maria








Guys! I just noticed we are missing some Maria in here!

Good ship
She says something along the lines of: "Guess I'll have to use my imagination while eating this pot." She most likely imagines food.
it is
and that's all that matters in the end, right?
It was also really funny. I enjoyed it a lot
That was so real, it was really unexpected.
Her father named her, and he only told Yayoi why he chose this name. And she was very young when he did, so she hardly remembered. Sadly, her father died when she was 6. So, now she tries her hardest to remember what her father told her.
The episode where she found out why she was named Yayoi... Man, that was depressing.
Yayoi was cute.
Oh, yeah, you're right
Doki Doki had a lot of Kamen Rider references in it
Aren't they even being broadcasted back to back?

I like that she can break me in half with one hand
Yuugi is great. Especially buff Yuugi










I hope we get a lot more Maria scenes in season 5.

Boobies
flat
Look at this beauty.
Aufwachenschlagen is not even a word.
The fuck is this sub? First Commie version?
Which fits, as it's the wave that appears when a gear awakes.
It means "to wake up"
Well, aufwachen makes sense, actually.
"Aufwachen hakei?"
WHAT?
That guy is called Riddle Gourmet!!
Super Robot Wars has a character called Rätsel Feinschmecker.
You think that's bad?
I blame Hitler
For some reason, yeah.
We have "Verbotene Frucht", Bedürfnis", "Gift", "Schimmer", "Du gibt mir Halt".
The titles of the entries of the series are, however.
The artist isn't German, that's the interesting part.
Nice.
It is.
I assume it's by the same artist that made that one TsubaMari series.
There is even some German in there
You can live
You did well.

anone
Shirabe machine broke again.
I stabbed myself in the back with that one.
OTP
Yes.
I can appreciate good Basa.
Oh, that Basa is cool.
Everybody loves Miku. Every Thursday night at CBS.
Doggos
sure.
Really? I haven't watched him in years.
The Runaway Guys lost me after a few episodes. They don't do it for me.
I watched them almost religiously for years. It is. It really is.
That description is so fitting, it's scary.
All shit, all assholes, and all great
Super Best Friends are the Seinfeld cast of Let's Players
Woolie is great.
That's that good shit.
WHENS MAHVEL?
Or shorthaired. Oh, mama, shorthaired.
Ponytail or long and open, that's more my thing.
Well, twintails are not actually a favorite of mine, it just looks kinda interesting on the gears.

EVEN BETTER!
That's better. Her bangs looked unfitting in the first one, I find.
Bikki with long hair looks strange. With that style, at least
relatable
I'd rather serve her.
Maidria
oh, nice!
The song is called There, Right There.
The musical is called Legally Blonde
I requested the edit
It's a reference to a musical
It's Am I Gay And/Or European?

I love that picture
Oh, cool!
So perfect

I hope I'll find my own Maria some day.

I never wanted to be an animal so badly.
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
<@182683872062865408> Is this okay?
Thank you, Carol.
could do
<@!263983345669505025> Helped you out there.
A Tenchu like game with Gears? Sign me up.
hm, Elfnein template. Interesting.
I love this pic. I'd have it as a poster. Or the other version I posted in nsfw.




Don't mind me, just making some stupid edits
No one can stop me.

Because it show genuine love and affection.
How come there is so much of that for this show?
SymphoKids are always cute
I mean, that's just anime hair
Yeah, childish, I wanna say
you see, another point I have to disagree on. Ponytails, short hair, long and open. That's good stuff.
I just don't find it appealing.
Yes, it did, and it bothered me then too, don't worry.
If the show has a pointless ass/pantyshot in the first episode, I'll nope the fuck out.
Done right how?
I don't like fanservice, so I guess it's a no from me.
I don't know if I wanna watch it. Does it have a lot of fanservice?
Twintail? That weird magical girl anime?
Good girl? depends on who says it and how, I reckon.


meh, that's a weird restriction.
You can only use gif avatars with nitro?
Basa hat
Not enough hats in the show
Tsubasa thinks Maria is cute in it too, it seems.
nice
How's it going?
A wild Saki appears.




I mean, what can we expect from the internet? Original jokes?
Hey, it's new to me

I just posted some pics.
There is none.
you mean the chris pic?


A Maria & Bikki duet would be interesting indeed.


I could not even imagine how Basa would react if Kanade suddenly reappears.
Not if I have any say in the matter

Extreme sleep
What did Bikki do?
TsubaMari makes my heart go doki doki
Oh, yes, that pic is awesome indeed.
oh, really?
A grin that knows she can kick ass
I haven't. And I love it
Oooohh, that's a very good and cute Maria
Yeah, I can see the similarities in the outfit
My favorite boss.
She is the second real hurdle in the DLC.
No, she is a sword fighter. And an extremely good one at that.
The boss is Lady Maria Of The Astral Clocktower
The is dressed like a boss from the Bloodborne DLC Old Hunters.
The one in the white suit and hat?
YES! Thank you!


Symphogear bird yell
XV
Wait, I thought it was a bird yelling while closing its eyes really hard.
Typo, I guess. We all make mistakes.
All of them in suits or dresses
How about an entire episode with them dancing together at a ball? For some kind of undercover work or whatever.
Found the pic I was talking about.
Kiri in ball gowns? That ball of fire and energy?
That reminds me of that one really good Love Live pic where they all wore suits and looked like mafiosi.
I bet Basa would rock a suit.

suits
<@!166497592136564736> Yes. Yes you are.
I like the typo in the file name. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
"Hell yeah, motherfucker" pose
there it is
fisto
what was the command again?`
life
is
fist
even better
the gayest emotions
Because this scene is all emotions.
You know why?
no, I've seen lesbian porn less gay than this.
one of the gayest scenes in anime history.

brain fart, that's why


"Hibiki I swear to Finé if you don't come home right now. I am itching for a fisting!"
yeah, that's my headcanon as well.
I always assumed Miku to be the one to be porngent
wait, is Bikki perganant?
I mean, okonomiyaki is kinda floppy, if I remember correctly. It's been years since I last had some
kudos to her for holding such a big piece of okonomiyaki with two sticks
Remember:
What is she looking at to be this smug?
Gen's hair is just that way because it makes him look awesome. He one day decided that's how it should be, and his body was like: "Okay".
I wonder what Maria's and Basa's child would look like.
That Bikki/Miku science baby is cute. And they even have an older daughter!
wait, the hood. Is that supposed to mimic Maria's hair?
Chris being a mother... That thought never occurred to me.
Oh, that's even cuter.
Put it in the Chris folder and the science baby folder.
could be Chris taking care of Bikki's and Miku's daughter.
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Very good. Never enough Maria
Did I see some Maria getting posted?

Oh, I am following that reddit as well.
<@!231025503643893770> Did I see Uni being posted? She is indeed best girl.
Oh, Hanayo.
And then Maria can be there for Basa, and they will finally get together. <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
My fic explains what happened to Basa's mom. The show should too, goddamnit!
because DRAMA!
basa's dad cuck confirmed
true
Hope we get answers, but I don't get my hopes up
who knows.
oh, is that mini basa and her mom?
oh, 'tis a cool one.
Make me, you damn cat!
Didn't it start as an eroge?
"Call Homura, I want her to see this!"
casual Maria is nice
That visor looks cool.
A marine gear? Awesome!
<@!102691114762371072> That is some amazing Maria artwork




That law does not exist in Germany, maybe that's why.
exactly
Kawakami is still best girl.

oops
<@!263983345669505025>
God, that Nyaria! I want ten!
Very yes
That summer Maria is beautiful
Guess I need to read some more OPM
OH MY GOD YES!
That's the next level, where you are not using the gay powers, you *are* the gay powers.
Ultra Yuri Instinct

<@!102691114762371072> Check this one out when you're back online
I have a Matoi Ryuko mousepad somewhere
in her head
She is lewding Bikki 24/7
The first one is the best
I own all 5 on BluRay
A Good Day To Yuri Hard.
fan art does not follow canon. Hell, I read a doujin where she fucked Gen. Let's not kid ourselves.
She is rather clinging to her senpai
you could say the same about Chris.
She also never interacted with Maria, hasn't stopped artists.
Chris isn't
Because the trip to town is long. HAHAHAHAHAHA
It's Kanade we are talking about.
She'd do more than that, I reckon.
And where is Maria, acting shocked at first, but then pushing Kanade away and give Basa a kabedon?
I was sure Kanade would catch Bikki's hands.
It's a little thing between us
the file name even says happy_SHE
Oh, sorry. The Maria up there. Kriisa named her ***S H E***
what's wrong, Jac?
***S H E*** is precious. I really should print that out and put it on a wall.
Always those French!
What's wrong with realistic proportions?
That looks nasty, in my opinion. Like, it's just not nice to look at.
Oh hell no. That looks not good.
I don't know.
I don't watch fanservice shows, and rarely anime in general.
true. But still, for some reason I don't really pay attention to it.
bust and butt, I mean
I tend to ignore that, honestly.
That give made me aware that Hibiki has quite the bust.
Premiere can't open MKV, otherwise I would do it
God, that's a happy Bikki. You can see she is literally milliseconds away from hugging the life out of someone.
Oh, she looks interesting



<@263983345669505025> I got the show on BluRay.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>


Eli is cool too
When I think Love Live I always think pairings, no single characters.
I prefer... Well, I honestly don't know. Nozomi, maybe. She is funny.
Not fetishwise, but a cute little Nico, yes.
I honestly found her a bit annoying with her verbal tic, but yeah, she was rarely there in the show, compared to others.
You mean "Rin, nya."
I'd say
Rin
maybe...
Carol looks more like she questions her entire worldview and what the writers are doing at that point.
Hey, I am not lewding anything! I am protecting.
Maria is precious! I wanna protect her! Even though she is most likely stronger than me. Which I am totally okay with.
mine
too good
Too pure
Never lewd Maria!
NEVER!
How anyone could lewd the gears is beyond me, anyhow.
Where is the one that says "Shirabe is protection, not erection"
or you don't like them strong?
What if you DON'T like a bro as a girlfriend?
What is one likes having their hoddies stolen, because it's cute? What if one likes being felt needed and strong?
I mean, sure, worded a bit towards tomboy.
I don't know, I don't think so
Tomboy all the way
Yes

No! Just Maria being cute and perfect and lovely.
I hope in season 5 we get at least 12 episodes about Maria.
***S H E***
***IT'S NOT***
NO!
counter argument:
DOUBLE BAN!
HANDHOLDING?
*Kerrik was banned from this server*
Watch Black Lagoon. The most dominant women you'll ever see.
when you check your phone at night
She'd be Brightness
And that's an old meme.
She'd like it.
DARKNESS!
damn, that's something

That Carol emote is great
yeah, I see what you mean, bread
Tomo on the left, Carol on the right.
Very funny and cute Manga
It's from Tomo-chan wa onna no ko.
Oh, that makes sense then.
Cinnamon roll and all.
The comments for the pic actually tended to be more on Carol's side.
I just thought the pic was cute and funny.
Hey, it's from the internet. They like their tomboys. And made y a Tomo fan. Obviously you will find some bias in there.
I reckon they'd take Tomo's points as negatives
Trust me, I know a LOT of people who would never go with a tomboy, because "muh masculinity!"
I love it!
Thankyouthankyouthankyou
My favorite character from RWBY
Oh, yes! Yang!
Hugs are nice
And a loveable and adorable smile
Yes, HEADPATS!
Fuck, that gif is cute. I wanna pat her head.
A very famous song
Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto is from a song
pet and scratch behind the ears
I wanna floof her
miwol on deviantart is the source.

Oh, I spy a wolf awoo
For me, without.
Oh, two wings.
Isn't there a Touhou Discord?`
<@!246146781832806401> Did I hear someone call Yang best girl? Good taste confirmed.
With her way of talking and how she looks up to gear.
Hm, I always considered her a bit younger.
and best little sister?
How old is Nep Jr then?
Bartender Miku
Femdomed by Maria sounds nice.
maybe....
wait...
<@!263983345669505025> My opinion is: I love it a lot. She could drill me anytime.
At least that's how I see it.
She works in her "blandness" incredibly well because she is a foil to her incredibly hyper and eccentric teammates.
I don't understand the Yumi hate in the west. She can be adorkably cute.
Hyper baking
A mom you can headpat and give hot chocolate too
yes, she'd be older than me. Still, she gets hugs and headpats
46, says wiki
how old is she?
Principal or not, I would tuck her into a warm blanket and give her stuffed animals.
Who is that ball of cuddles?
Maria looks so fucking good in a suit.
Suit gears (Symphosuits?) are great
Large mountains

Noire a real cute
That's an interaction I would have loved to see.
Big sister Kanade
Absolutely
Those wraps around her chest look so great. I love this on Daidouji as well.
Damn! I like! <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I love the TsubaMari of that person on pixiv. They make somecuddly stuff.
considering it's just short for grotesque, it could just be a very weird doujin.
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Sympho guro
the good stuff
But dying from it?
Nobody would make stuff up on the internet
but the reddit says so, so it must be true
Here it is, Lat: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamindustri/comments/9cn4ei/congrats_to_neptune_for_being_the_first_anime/
Nep is drowning in her own tits?
She never made sense
But Nep can do that.
Weird family. Three of them are the same person.
<@!196360095485919232> That's her. From Neptunia <:Ver:336656981144109066>
It was rectified.
Bread did not know who Histy was.
<@!196360095485919232> That's her. From Neptunia
Two DIFFERENT ones, obviously
http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2001/07/egg-fertilized-without-sperm
The eggs could feritize each other.
Well, it's scientifically actually possible for two women to have a child.
Wow, that looks nice! Kinda like their daughter.
She looks cute!

cheese fries sounds delicious as hell. You don't get stuff like this here in Germany
sounds good
What is her go-to fry store/service?
check discord while driving
Break the shift key.
to get the commands to work, you have to think like Kriisa.
Kriisa and her scripting...
Shirabe to the rescue
I want more actual moments in the show!
TsubaMari is so great!
Man, she is adorable
~~maybe I could use it for one of my fics with overarching storyline~~
That could be something very interesting
**HM**
HM
Hm.
unlimited timelines with unlimited variations.
Theoretically, yes
I don't know what came over me
Sorry.
***YASSAI MOSSAI***
Oh, I like that one. That's evil
Yeah, I think that's one of the best Kanade artworks I have seen
but especially in this pic
Oh, hell yes!
I really like the Kanade with the cap. She looks fucking cool
Some very good Basa pics in there, Kerrik
I should be in bed. It's 1 am

if only
That's why her eye hurts, too.
She was just a bit too close to a fire source.
She is not dying. She has something in her eye
Cute
Fused Elfnein
Senpai love
I am absolutely okay with Basa x Chris
CUTE!
dedication
oh, nice
13000? That's like, what? half an episode?
But yes, Basa tasted the tomato. She got to the juicy core.
She should have a database with every frame of the show
Shirabe is lacking.
I was thinking more on the lines for her "eating" Maria. But vore works too
kinky
Well, Basa ate a tomato at the end of AXZ, so, is that a metaphor?
Oh, Maria is a tomato now?
Because she is perfect for Maria
Basa is easily my second favorite character.
which she would program to only trigger when you type HeLp or something
I remember we made fun of her once because of that.
She always was.
Ask R
Basa can'T aim
or
slap da bass
Kriisa decided against a list so you stumble over it by accident
I love it
That tiny Maria! I want her!! I give her cuddles!!
Cute! Two wifes are taking care of their kids.
Also called Satsuma
a citrus fruit from southern japan.
Because Mikans are a popular fruit in Japan
A predator in the sheets.
Maria versus a horny Tsubasa after seven rounds.
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Uni needs more love in general. Put her in everything!
On her "moms".
Where are Basa's hands in the upper pic? <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Maria does not want to have her soul sucked out by anyone but Tsubasa
"Mikan"? So, they are a bunch of fruits, huh?
I kinda like maid gears. Maria looks cute in it.
Her birthday? Let's not forget to change the server icon
No harm, no foul. Accidents happen


I love those pics!
Chris got some booty
Blissbasa
But seriously, the pics are adorable
true
Maria is mom
Cute either way
But, isn't Maria older?
HE CAN SHOWER AND POST!
HE CAN EAT AND POST
NOW!
<@!263983345669505025> The people are growing restless
Nope, never seen them
I don't read manga
The what?
<@!173112001684439040> WHAT?
But I guess he could
I don't know how
yes, a few hours ago
Kerrik is going all out. There is no stopping him.
Kawakami is best everything
Replace all with Kawakami and it's me.
I saw a Maria in the previous pic, so into the Maria folder it goes
Gen would be Garterbelt
I'd watch the hell out of that.
That Maria looks like she could be from Panty & Stocking
I have a poster of her on my wall
Oh, yes, Ryuko!

<@284390402210136064> Official art.
Oh, yes, the price. Holy shit, those things are expensive
And one with Zone-Tan on it
My living room's walls are full of posters from video games and shows.
I am, however, not a figurines guy. I guess I'll take posters, shirts and stuff like that.
I don't. I'd love to have more gear stuff, but I need to live somehow, as well.
I'd love to see the faces of people when I take out my phone.
I am maximum weeb when it comes to wallpapers.
This is my lockscreen wallpaper.
Well, I think it works with your current wallpaper
Yeah, Burt passed away a few days ago. A shame
Honestly, I think the filter your lock screen puts over it makes it look even better.
Oh, that's beautiful artwork.

I think it's adorable what a messy eater she is.
Hungry Chris
used the last page, so you could actually see stuff
that's mine

Oh, that looks cool
You can do it, Uni!
Give it to her too!
It gives me life
Thanks
Here she is with her wife.
Look how cute Maria is.

She knows me so well
I never added the Color Me role myself, by the way. Kriisa did it for me.
shame
yes
I am!
WORSHIP HER!
Are we worshiping Maria?
Her outfit has +50 DEF, it's fine
nice
how crap? Bon Appetit is not that demanding.
Bon Appetit is also on steam
Homura's story was hilarious. The only reason they figured out something was wrong was that Homura didn't yell all the time.
Oh, yes, poor Asuka.
SK7 needs it
I'm all for it.
Basically confirmed now.
LEGS!
I THINK IT LOOKS AMAZING!
AIRGETLAM IS GREAT!
WHAT?
My least favorite gear design is Shirabe's. It was always just there.
KILL JULIET
Her character design, you mean, or just her gear?
Her name is Hong Meiling!
You know, a few days ago, I pondered about Symphogear, like one does every once in a while. And that made me aware that Basa is easily my second favorite Gear.
I like the fanon that Meiling raised a young Sakura.
my favorite 2hu!
MEILING! CHINA!
OH, YES!
Reading glasses, but still
If you want a Chris with glasses I could send you a photo of me.
Oh, that's cool
Hypothermia would like a word.
I mean Y are they sleeping in the snow?
Y
Absolutely
Yumi is keeping herself fit.

Oh, just to be clear, I don't hate Shirabe's gear design, it's just the least appealing for me.
Zorro: "I am worried about Nami."
Sanji: "Why?"
Z: "Oh, you know, she has a weak chest, after all."
S: "A weak chest? Nami's chest is great!"
My reaction reminded me of a dialogue in the german version of One Piece.
not in my opinion
Let me get some pictures of them
character
Who is your fav?
Best Senran

I posted a Yumi preparing for exercises, don't know if you saw.
And yes, I feel better, Kerrik
I was making a dumb joke, sorry
My poor soul
Please stop
What if you are a gynecologist? Talks about pregnancy would be sfw.
4chan can fuck two miles off!
Maria is for hugs and cuddles as well.
That is true, Lat. She is precious.
I can relate, Lat. I also don't lewd Maria. I could not do that to my waifu.
I trust Lat when it comes to Elfnein knowledge
But if Lat says she is a teenager, she is a teenager.
She is a homunculus. she doesn't age.
Maybe she spilled a drink.
It's because her cuteness brings you to tears
I heard it was called AzuYui
Nep, nepnepnepnepnep nep nep nep.
So much art Discord can't handle it.
Not if they don't like each other or anything, b-baka.



She knows her stuff when it comes to this
keyword professional.
yes
pics, I mean
I have some more, but I would need to post them in nsfw.
In the OVA, she gathers money on the street by acting like a dog and letting people throw stuff at her.
If it's a battle like this it will either be the best food ever made or weapons of mass destruction.



I guess who ever wins, the world is done.
Bikki vs Daidouji is a tough one. Hibiki had God powers, Daidouji is the most powerful Ninja alive in SK.




Yuri is a gift
Carol really is, yeah
Oh, yes! Maria in armor!
This is my absolute favorite
Hell yes! It looks awesome as hell
NicoMaki is good
Gen is best dad
God, that's cute.


Oh, that makes sense
With the axe and all
I wonder what the implications behind the flag are.
It looks interesting.
Amazons.
Yeah! and I remember where! In the Bumbleby facebook group. RT apparently hid the flag's colors in the background coloring in a Blake scene
Oh, I think I've seen it already.
what are lesbian colors? I know the rainbow, and the transgender colors.
but cool
that's gay
Don't forget you are all great people too
happens. Nobody's perfect
no problem
I meant Jac
I am
as long as I don't misgender anyone.
same here, but than again, I honestly don't care what gender or preference anyone here has. For me it's all about the person.
they failed, of course
or rather, the government
The citizens of Lesbos actually tried to claim the word lesbian exclusively for themselves.
well, gays make jokes about straights as well. As long as it's in good fun and actually understood like that, I'd say it's okay. I would not make some jokes to strangers, honestly
what about the people from Lesbos? They are lesbos
Yes, Kriisa, same girl. Plutia from Neptunia
yeah, basically. And God help you if you drop the combo
Her fighting style is the exact opposite of how I play
She! I can NOT play her for the life of me

It took those politicians years til they finally got the memo, though, but it was a great day when it happened.
In Germany as well. They can marry and everything here.
no, again
Hey, it's fine, Lucifer, I get it. It's important to you and very personal.
I feel the word homophobic is used too lightly. It's like calling everything racist, which happens too often as well, sadly. We know Kerrik is not a homophobe.
No one girl should have all that power
She is really slow, yeah. I don't really have a problem playing her, but man, can she get rushed
fisto
oh, fisto!
who would deny yuri?
Or people who want to understand other people.
true

Neps everywhere
pretty sure it was cast again, wasn't it?
yeah, happens with interesting topics
Go for it, Basa!
Oh, yes!!


Absolutely
I kinda like it. There are better ones, but that's not bad

look at that smile!

YOU!
Isn't she adorable??
Kriisa, you don't know how absolutely close you are with that question
ui
The game is fun
Oh, Ryuko!
Me too


Not on the internet
And a meme was born
The new SMB has a powerup letting Toadette transform into Peachette. Ayyyk92 made a comic of Bowser using that powerup.
A new meme.
And they even have an explanation, as it's an official powerup he could use.
Hell yes
Here we go




OH NO!



it makes sense




NEPUGEAAAHHH!!!
cute nep jr.
I want to cover Maria is a warm, big blanket
Geez
That's what I meant
yes, dreams
thank you, bread
Oh, God, muscular Maria gives me good, long dreams.
Thanks
Please
Internet, love them!
IT SHOULD!
But the internet is exceptionally important, especially when it comes to influencing other media
I'd love to see them!
I'm not!
With how much the internet in general loves buff or muscular women, why are they not represented more in media?
I can see that, yes
Sorry, let's keep it sfw
like Maria, on her strap-on!
Tsubasa dreams of Maria!
Tsubasa's heart rate skyrockets

Like many great ideas, it came over night
Accidents happen
it seems
all the tales girls as well
I am not a fan of animal ears on anime girls, but that's kinda cute
new Mario Kart character when?


Restraint? No. I don't see Maria like that.
I have two pics of Maria's butt during her transformations.


It's just what they like, don't kinkshame.
see? now you get it
yes
it's just roleplay
Because Maria likes the look
I'll have you know she only does it for Maria, because she loves her
I am sorry, did you just call Basa a prostitute?

MARIA IS WOKE

but enough joking, back to the pics
she has the ***BIG GAY***
the gayer you are, the stronger. That's why Hibiki hits like a truck.
the power of gay
basically
I mean, we could start with what the fuck phonic gain is, if we want to pick the show apart.
^this
And that's all that matters
It looked pretty.
for the wires
one with ceiling
the entire stadium was a hologram. they were in a room all along
just joking, by the way
Wires in an open air stadium: not fine
three girls bringing a spaceship to the ground from outer space: fine
and ice is water. hard water
magic
how do you know? you can't see the ground
*and those legs*
Look how graceful she is
Beautiful
But with the added thing of what I just said
Same here.
Only questions directly related to your job you want to have are allowed. And if you are not working with spirit animals, no such question can be asked
Still, they are not allowed to ask that in job interviews
No joke
Did you know? In Germany, those questions are illegal.
A Yangbowsette by Mojojoj? Nice!

Oh, the other great Maria

hell yes!

sounds like funnyjunks random naming engine
if you lied to me...


Shirabe checks for GPH, Gay Per Hour. If not enough, she'll link you to yuri

Her intestines are beautiful, damnit!
Inside and outside
Every part of Maria is beautiful

and only two of them are the butt pics
I have 1800 files in my Maria folder.
Hey, I don't even know why I have them, honestly.
I want her do have a broadsword
Maria with sword is a nice idea
Don't let Maria see that

Mordred is fine the way she is!

How would that look? She'd curse at the audience?










Oh, Yang is my favorite RWBY character
The chorus is always "in your mind", according to the official lyrics
Don't lose your gay
oh, nice
oh yes! hello, phone wallpaper
Now, this, this is beautiful
But Satsuki is nice
Oh, Satsuki. I am a Ryuko man myself.
Samus is trying so hard not to just shoot Ridley

Cute!

***WOKE***

Skate maids

Oh, what's that? Father/Daughter look? Cute




I prefer a casual look on women
I'd say she has definitely tomboyish traits, but I don't think those are a factor in her wearing pants or skirts
SERENAAAA!!!!
I can see it coming: Kanade will take Maria's book for the tower, making her cry. Hibiki will pull the rug, making the tower collapse, making Kanade cry. And then Hibiki will get scolded, all all three are crying
Still beautiful pictures, even if upside down
She is looking at the beautiful pictures
Ann with open hair looks good
best mom

you mean this?
Little bonus the artist made



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvKbRuXwkRw











I also got a few Akko faces

Akko is a cute


considering toads are her fighting spirit animals it does not make sense
in the anime, she is scared of toads for some reason.
it's actually a really entertaining watch, if you can look past that weird Asuka trait they gave her in the show. It roughly tells the story of SK1
The Senran Kagura anime
I missed that
oh, you're right. I guess I'll put that in nsfw
oh, cute Asuka art!
I see a Weiss!

What pics do you want? I'm on phone, don't have much on here
That's pretty, yes!
Homura x Asuka is life
Basa's bride
UNLIMITED MAD
This one. Ignore the corruptions on the border, that happened because of a faulty external harddrive.
I remember I made an album cover a few years back with a lot of effects.
Did not think of that
Oh, that was a good idea.
<@400844698140409856> I hope you like it. cast made it
That's good!
<@!231025503643893770> here you go
Okay
I thought you avoid nsfw
<@284390402210136064> here is the Kanadouji pic I mentioned earlier.
Same
DMJii are at the bottom for me because I don't really like the cutesy characters with verbal tics and such. I mean, Symphogear handles it pretty well, as the show does not push it into my face and have them be cute for cuteness' sake. That's why I don't *hate* them, I still like them. But lowest of all.
I honestly have to say that Shirabe and Kiri are at the bottom of my list, sadly.
exactly. that's just normal, I find
There is not one I don't like
But they are of course all great
I just rate them based on how much I enjoy watching them in the show.
second is Basa
She is number one, hey!
*trumpet plays*
Number one for me. Always
Maria best
I love her
No making fun of my waifu...
Well, I have the picture somewhere...
It seems more like you are getting ideas
They would be scarred for life
oh, oh, they discovered the fan art!
hm, yeah, I could work with that
oh, that's a happy Uni
I don't know, I don't care for Fate. I just like her design
I like Morded. Tomboys!
Great, now I have that song stuck in my head again. Thank you very much

The artist should make another version with Diana added

No gear can contain him
By the way, some Maria so we don't derail too hard.
I kinda like Elfnein because she is the brain. It's adorable.
Same with Chris. I really can't stand tsundere characters at all, it's an old, stale trope, but Chris is handled *very* well in that regard.
from all the gaming she lost some eyesight
contact lenses
No!
But why isn't Maria sitting on her?
Chris x Spaghett
Chris can Spaghett with everything
at 5 am!
I bet the two didn't even ask her. They just kidnapped her, dressed her up and now force her to run
<@284390402210136064> https://youtu.be/L7QlCZz0jy4
No
He did in <#336310266654490624>
And Kiri is the grim reaper because she harvests oat for a living


I had to read the name out loud to get what you wrote

And rule 4 applies 100%
Weird, I think the same about Maria.
And I usually like Platinum Games games.
True, I was just really disappointed, because I heard so many good things about the game.
I REALLY did not like it
Don't worry, you won't get spoilers. I refunded the game, never finished it.
The DMJii artwork is good, tough, no doubts about that
I found Nier: Automata incredibly boring.
Can I be blunt?
That Kanade transformation video. God, I forgot how amazing her song is.
The face is still a little on the soft side, kinda clashes with the body
I wanna get bricked
Yang as Doom Girl
SATSUKI!
yeah, that one looks too "pure" and "holy". I prefer wild and untamed
I just wish they's be higher res
Don't be sorry, they are great
That hair
The one on the left looks cool and wild, I love that
thanks
Especially the one on the left looks amazing
They look like every single one of them could kick my ass twenty times without needing to catch their breath. And I love it


I like ponytails very much
JK, I will.
I will not
OH SHIT!!!!!
RIP, Chris. Died from a heart attack because of unexpected affection.
*muffled Blanc screams in the distance*
Samus!

Hibiki
How does Chris always get into those situations?
Dead girl walking
I'll cherish it
<@400844698140409856> Well, like this: 
1.Panel: Right: Serena, happy birthday!
middle: G...girls.
left: Thank you very much.
2.Panel: Kiri: Because it's your birthday today, I'll be your big sister for today.
Serena: I'm so happy!
3. Panel: Hibiki: Me too.
Miku: (no idea there, sorry)
Serena: Seems like I'll be covered in big sisters! (she actually says something like: My big sisters will be full, as if they are stored in a box or something.)
4. Panel: Maria, right: Do... don't!
right: "I am Serena's big sister!"
simply by yelling
Dai beat the Hanzo girls in the anime without them even getting near her
On the other hand, the Yoma in SK2 was deadly afraid of Daidouji, according to background material
Gen took on Fine, while she was in armor, and handed her ass to her.
I guess who ever wins, we lose.
Gen has superpowers. But Daidouji has superpowers.
actually really tough to say
oh, now you are bringing out the big guns
Gen: NAN DATTO!
Chris: "Cagliostro! My cute little sister!"
Cag: "You wanna get punched again?"
that implies stuff
Wait...
Where everyone is gay and everyone is everyone's little sister
Yeah, basically
I guess she got jealous that everyone likes Serena
Maria says "I am Serena's sister!"
I see RWBY, especially a Yang!
I bet Carol and her dad started the night
oh oh
I got some, just not wearing them right now
sorry
I am inane
no, it doesn't
The chart refers to insanity
insane, you mean
That pic is adorable
The M on the cap would still work
We need that Maria edit
Wait, Shirabe got a firmware update? Since when?
handholding?
Never let it suck
yawn cat
waking up the other floofs sleeping on it
Kiri is the hyperactive one who runs over your bed in the middle of the night
Two wifes and their little floofs
That's one show I will never watch
ew
Only one ***SHE***!
Impossible!
***SHE V2***?
I am unaware of that character
I have all the OVAs on my harddrive, I guess I could make some screenshots

YASSAI MOSSAI
Gohan to gohan!
Oh, that's a cute pic!
They are good screenshots
Veni, veni, venias
Ne me mori facias
That's the idea
Have some TsubaMari
sorry, sorry
oops
oh
It's more fun in public, honestly
are you gonna use it in public?
A "jump bean"
I bet Basa would be too
Every time she presses the button, Basa does a little jump
It's the remote controlling Basa's "massager".
It's Basa's
No



check the "see all"
it's correct


speaking of bikes
***BEST!!!!***
She is best!!!!
She can fly a helicopter and steer a submarine!
Because she does not need to!
ONLY ONE!

For me, there will only be one ***SHE***. No other can compare
Fight me!
ONLY ONE ***SHE***
Only available in the japanese version, the song

I like the little button nose she has in this episode
It's cags, she is always lewd
Oh, the Estrogen
"YOU'VE GOT TO BE SHITTING ME!"
I mean, that's just unfair. No one can beat Gen
YES! Maria kicking ass!
they like you
Knowing Kim, he'd keep the rice for himself
Jaka Jan
I love jalapenos.
oh, nice. Surprise mouth pain
she found the spicy one
HEADPAT??
Basa can't aim
Kiri could be 5, Prelati 10. Double the age
could still be siblings
Like siblings and their secret language
and no one but them understands what they are saying
oh, story, you mean
No one is stopping you
do it, then
very vute
that's cute
second try
GenVer
hm, yeah, I guess you have a point
119
KanaVer!
KanaGen?
Moooomm!!
You will get to bed without dinner now! Na, na, nana, na!
She started it!
I...
TsubaMari!!
TsubaMari OTP
Reject her! Claim your Tsubasa!
That's my Maria!
I will try
harshly
I have to disagree
Maria is for Basa!!
NO!!!!
Yep, Miku is the dominant one
in 11 minutes for me
only Nep is a big missed opportunity
Two girls gonn' die tonight
Chris a Kitsune
A symphogear AU in feudal Japan with spirits would be interesting
that's cute
Batista bomb kiss
okay
Wait, are they wrestling or kissing?
Yes! Broccoli! And she gets the biggest, deadliest gun of all
I'd be a Uni main if that happened
She looks too calm for having red eyes
Yuri marriage is great
Yeah, Jii looks like she wants baby Kiri for herself, And Cags wants to be in Kiri's place
That's Kiri, yeah.
that's so cute!
And poor Maria. Hibiki, watch it!
For some reason, the first thing that came to mind when I saw the "dead Kiri/Shirabe being nasty and marries anyone BUT Kiri" picture, was Kiri going: "BYE SON!"
Damn, how tall is Cags, anyway? I mean, sure, Chris is small, but that difference looks drastic.
absolutely

Risky, on the other hand...
please. Shantae is for hug
Yes!



very good
Thanks
Fuck y'all!
Big abort!
Big stop!
NO!
No!
Abort!
Stop!
That's better
But the sentence fits her
Carol edit when?
it's a difference of 2 cm between the two, I think heels can change something there
but Kiri is wearing heels. Hibiki isn't
And TsubaMari together. Lovely
and look at that. Adam and Hibiki are holding hands. Nice to see them get along
but still!
well, almost everyone is.
She is wearing high-heels!
Cags is cheating!
but wait a second!
I am more a Maria kinda guy. Tall, strong, no tsun stuff.
Chris is an ant compared to anyone besides Kiri, Shirabe and Elfnein. But Cags? She could put Chris in her pocket or whatever.
but yeah, Cags is *huge*.
average height for an european woman
170cm
I know it
She is.
impressive
what a way to go.
AAAHHH!!
Maria will protect me
please no
I don't like the last pic. I fear for my well-being
it seemed to develop over the chapters, so there is hope
I love that manga!
I hope she doesn't look at explosions
Oh, oh, Noire is going to butcher someone
Asuka knows what she did
true
Well, Shirabe has some plotful company too, actually
out of context? I was not referring to the thought bubble up there, but the pic above that. Basa's expression.
considering how she has the hots for the younger stoic girl
Especially Maria
Oh, I know
not if it's the wrong plot
Basa does not like it, no sir!
Uni beat Gear every time. So she asked Ram and Rom to help her, I reckon
so it's kind of a revenge thing
adorbs!
still, it's sad. Poor girl
I bet the others teamed up against her
poor Uni.
That's a pleasant surprise to wake up to! Maria!!
I felt Renka was the only one I could actually play as.
I don't quite remember if it's her exclusively, but you play the sisters a lot, yes
I am looking forward to Uppers for PC. Dai is a playable character in it
that's how I felt with Daidai. Leveled her over her story, and then thought: Why not?
But I remember wrecking people left and right online
it's a bit tricky to pull off, yes
her ultimate move in Estival Versus is amazing
Her best form
that smile is lovely
oh, that's a nice picture
would you play the pocky game with Chris?
I'll post some Bikini Dais in <#336297808221044736>, just to be sure
ha, could you imagine Daidiouji going "Nico Nico Ni"?
<@!246146781832806401> it's Daidouji's birthday today!!
checks out
Let's become the next B'z, you and I!
Good idea!
yes, I am equally as easy to please
I know what you did with that post, by the way
BEAUTIFUL!
you are so easy to please
A bit too revealing for my taste, but other than that, the design looks cool

I like her a lot, she is cool!
oh, nice! Miyabi!
perfect
Joel's dad is a gear user
Unigear is love, Nepnowa is life
cute!
This place is unclean!
*curses!*
Kriisa! This is not Mars!
Excuse me, this is a no-dab zone


<@284390402210136064> Dark Asuka, yes or no?
I am happy
I see some Maria
I remember there was this one girl with a ponytail and fang. I don't remember her name. Was it Hibiki?
I have to be honest, I have no idea about anything related to Idolmaster. I just like Mika's design
why?
she is part of a group that bullies her?
I'm sorry?
I love that hair
okay, what did you do to me?? Yukio posted a little birthday comic today, and I checked out the characters names in a comment after that. Apparently, the two are from Idolmaster, okay. But Mika's design has me fucking hooked!
No dess!
puns
OH NO! Here comes the Legendary Super Lesbian! She saw the TsubaMari posts!!
this is the lewd I like

Absolutely
especially not now
oh, gladly
***UNCLEAN!!!!!***
unclean!!!
it's "dess!"
Excuse me?
desu?
don't worry, Maria is there to take your place
of course, Kerrik got my back
recolored?
damn, girl, that was really fast
way ahead, it seems

cute!!!

I was quoting another song
no.
oh, okay
you don't know the song? wait a second.
why oh?
love that song
Do you see banana man
hopping over on the white hot sand?
Los Del Rio. Those dudes. Still very successful.


<@400844698140409856> The Homura/Asuka wedding pic is an official picture, yes
It was just what came to mind
I am aware
I was just memeing
you're right, it's a twitter
oh
I don't know nothing about it. I just like the pic
It's a good picture, Brent
Otokonoko wa
I did that with my cat too
nom
And let's not forget, Diana is voiced by Yoko Hikasa, and I just LOVE her voice.
DiaAkko is good civ
I remember now, I remember now
why they call it Thunderbird
looks good
also, hello, new wallpaper
Oh, I like strong
Maria knows a thing or two about tomatoes
talk about swagger
I mean, it shows a dream of many Senran Kagura fans, Asuka and Homura getting married. It is life and hometown, and should be shared as often as possible
It's official art
Homura and Asuka from Senran Kagura, both in the picture above it as well.


Absolutely
I love Asuka's face here

They are ultra gay

Highly focused Chris
Oh, that's cute! The wifes swap hairstyles!
oh, that Maria up there is great
gay is good
NOWA
oh, right
and that other one... I know it, but I can't remember the name
Nice Maria art, but those boobs... <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Great stuff
Her VA streams sometimes.
oh yes!
HA!
what's sopdog?
but Kirika kissed her too
strange she only pushed away Bikki
that would be concerning
hopefully, she does not act like her.
I can see that
I did not know I needed a pouting Basa in my life

Look, it's Nyan Gao Long!


basically
I am a bumbleBY fan, but damn if White Rose isn't adorable.
cute


that's cool!
Want!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Maria on a bike!!!
Never thought I'd see this movie referenced
Ha!
I really like this image. Casual is great
ah, I see
hm
unless you are living on an island
oh, by the way, can it be that your profile name is a Pink Floyd reference? They have a song called Marooned.
HA!
get it?
<@!176830925949108224> you could say, he is a... fan
lovey-dovey gay girls are great
God, that's cute

No, waifu
It's a perfect waifu!
Never!
***LOOK!!***
Look how cute she is!!!
that's true

well, she is meguca
And she is perfect
There is only ONE Maria!
oh oh. Maria doesn't like it.
Beautiful!
smol Basa is cute!
Her last name is also mispronounced, actually
not you, I mean Monty's excuse. He said that
that excuse is kinda halfassed in my opinion. "There is no Germany in Remnant" Why have a German word as a name then?
ß is a unique German letter, so kinda understandable
same pronounciation
I am German
no, it wouldn't
2B is meh
but okay
Which should be spelled "Weiß", Monty!!!
Uh, Weiss
I'm always like: "Oh, cool, Akko! Oh...."
The first thing I always think of with that brunette character is Akko from MWA


that's true
by definition, an antagonist is someone who works against the protagonist. does not need to be evil, just against the "hero", however you want to portrait them
yeah, Emerald just has no where else to go, because she has no one else
my favorite villain is Cinder
ice cream daughter
Mojojoj is great
nice
Let me post some Yang to get some actual pics in here
same, kinda
send help
there it is
jaka jan
jakka jan
slap da bass
I forgot that command existed
oh
pew
Aufwachen waveforms
well, how about something close to us?
nice
In Super Robot Wars a character is called Rätsel Feinschmecker. That means Riddle Gourmet
But Weiss is great, I can agree. She is probably my second favorite out of the team, with her character development and all
great way to die
by Yang
just saiyan
Yang best
anyway
but that's splitting hairs now
It turns into a profession as soon as they make money off of it, like Mel said. There are also amateur companies
Because it's fun
I don't think so, honestly. When did Monty ever say that? He just said "There is no German". And that was that
was just saying
no
oh, those. that sounds better
these
oh,
thise?
Now that you mention it, I remember a similar scene
I think you might be right.
why is Kirika outside and starving like always?
I am not on my PC anymore, otherwise I would send it to you. Maybe someone else can help out.
I already have that as wallpaper, META
fun fact: Even thought bumbleBY is my favorite RWBY ship, I find it easier to write fics centered on White Rose
White Rose is cute as well.
BumbleBY is great



I don't like this "halfnaked because fanservice" stuff.
I wanna buy her some pants
can she activate it at will?
is that the one with the red eye?
the second to last pic, I mean
why are the one on the bottom left and the one with heterochromia giving me weird looks?
what's with that happy emote? It's überhappy
I like the Team Skull Moon drawings
Right, her official name was Moon.
FemC from Sun and Moon is so cute
I'd be down
PS4? Damn, I only have the PC version
Boom
hello, new pfp
oh, yes!!!
"Fufufufufu!"
oh wow!!! Yeah, Maria does look great in everything!
<@!102691114762371072> I do in fact very much appreciate it. Thank you!






Only Kawakami for me.

best teacher ever. I can never betray her. every playthrough, only Kawakami

who has the greater harem powers?
Battle of the Gods. Kanade versus Germain
you can see on her face that she does not really like using her harem powers, but she learned living with them
She just needs her two girls to be happy. And she is a considerate person, unlike Kanade. Germain knows her powers and controls them.
Too gay. If she survived, there would be no other pairings besides Kanade x Everyone
Kanade is basically the lady killer of the show.
Maria does not know how to deal with her
cute
she is so lost
The dead christmas squad
okay
Yeah, that's good.
as if they did not know how to write the characters out of the situation otherwise
have to agree there
yeah, came outta nowhere and was kinda halfassed
yeah, was pretty solid
yeah
Which I will not go into detail here, because spoilers
Reminds me of the latest free episode
I believe it's from this: https://dynasty-scans.com/series/henceforward
isn't that Yang from an AU manga?
I prefer my Yang buff, but that pic is indeed nice.
nice!


Best girl
is that stracciatella ice cream?
which is the only foreign dub the show ever had.
Weiss even says: "This seems strangely familiar."
Weiss and Maria are both voiced by Yoko Hikasa in Japanese
This one is great


but now?
Weiss was a character that really grew on me. At first I did not like her at all
oh, Weiss!

why is that emote so **FUCKING HAPPY?**
how about a nice, shoulder free, red one, with sparkles.
Idea: Chris with a fancy dress
still good. I've seen way worse in terms of proportions
Maria and her evolutions
oh, lovely!
Oh, that Maria cosplay looks good!
That's why I did not mention it
I normally really don't like Pyrrha, but those legs, oh boy...
I know, right?
source is Mediamaster_127 on twitter

Breaks your pelvis
Neporu Neporu!
CUTE!
ZS, that is
Samus is lovely. My main since Brawl
but that butt

<@212254733925089282> JLullaby is their name, yeah. I like this picture because ***BUFF***
those are cursed words
<@231025503643893770>

the gears the girls in the second to last pic wear look cool
Maria, for example


by the way, I love Yang's face here
With kind of an happy end
Sad Chris will play a prominent role in my future fic


oh, and she could kiss other parts of you
kisses can be safe if it's without tongue
Garie: "Bitch, I'm adorable."
Look at that wink. Garie thinks she's cute.
nsfd
nsfh
Hey, it's not like she wanted to lose her arm
I have no problems with it
and here is Yang
right, lets go there
He'll reincarnate into the plane Yang played with
Like I said in general, the cartoony vibe really fits for the show
I liked that the lastest episodes dared to have some silly stuff in them.
yeah
in the latest episode?
but as soon as that buttrock comes it, the scene falls apart, I find
they help carry the scenes, convey emotion. it works
I like the music in RWBY as long as there is no fucking singing in it. The orchestrals are great
I am really not. At least not in that context
They could have just used orchestral stuff
Why?
god, that song!
when you mentioned the fight.
one thing I really don't care for in RWBY is the music
5 was not good, yeah
I never watched the show for the fights
But honestly
I enjoy the fights in vol 6
and the animation improved a lot
<@!302063351767498752> this is how the show looks nowadays. A screenshot from the most recent episode
she sells them to the r/Symphogear discord
oh oh, Tsubasa. What did you do last night?
**tea**
yes
too much tea
what's mori mori? What am I missing???
mori mori?
Is there a reference I don't get?
Chris seems pretty cute
<@!246146781832806401> you missed an opportunity to write "CATdenzavnyaa"
her face reminds me so much of Ryona, I thought it was her at first
Real name is Siuol
yeah
I could call myself Tim, would still be one
But, do they know you don't use aliases?
you don't really need weird sounding names, I am just goofing around
Imagine. All have interesting team names, except one
And JOE
All morph
"YameteTomete! Time to translate!"
Transformation sequence and all
for a symbol, of course, not to dood it
The German postal services still use that horn
I like those. The artwork is cute
Oh, yeah, that's true
I have a spotify account, but I never use it, honestly
okay
I can send them to you
I have the studio versions of Fuwa Fuwa Time, with Mio and Yui on main vocals
I only know the song Love, honestly
ye
I still got that one Death Devil single on my hard drive.
Miss Metalhead
Irish milk
Catria!
How does that spine work anyway?
yes


God, that's adorable
Looks good
oh, that's pretty

mojojoj is the artist.
Lillie/Lily was adorable
Oh, I never played X/Y
At least based on Japanese lore
Well, humans used to marry Pokémon.
I believe the US version calls her Hilda
Isn't Touko way older, actually? Around 16, I believe
They could be gay for other girls.
why are gay poké-girls not canon?
The truth
Komi-san is a cute read.
cool! thanks. Will check it out
yeah, I still need a name
hm, interesting
I don't even know what the show is called and what's it about. is it gay?
Oh, I do too
Every frame?
You call yourself a fan and don't know every detail of the show?
I am pretty sure we know. because we know Tsubasa's age at the start of the show, and the flashback mentions how many years in the past it was, I believe
wasn't she six in the flashbacks?
Perfect!
Ed...ward....
it's their daughter
yep, that's the story of my life, basically, Kerrik
A character I didn't like. But you all know my stand on the game.
2B has good... I don't know, a good OS?
Shantae has good games
"Hey, Risky! Come here and try it too!"
She'd be like: "This is fun! Yeay!!!"
Shantae is very bubbly indeed
Nice Maria art
cute!
Don't worry, Uni, you are perfect the way you are.
me too
could you imagine a Persona crossover with Nintendo characters? Like, what Smash Bros did, only with Persona gameplay?
oh, nice
I see Daidouji up there. That's always a yes from me

I see Noire, which is very nice
wait, that's not Maria
This is a cute Maria. I want to feed her.
Mecha-Maria
That character checks off all the boxes for me.
I guess I'll haveto follow that person. Wow.
Yeah, the design is great
Oh, wow, that looks awesome.
oh, sorry, the next one
or at least not give her the arm back in the SAME FUCKING EPISODE!
her eyes as well.
I always think that's Akko for a second

that's fucking adorable
damn, that's cool
but jokes aside, ship who you want.
*Maria REALLY disliked that*
true
Maria is also, according to the creators, one of the physically strongest gears, I assume right after Hibiki. Sadly we don't see it
Her fists aren't
I like how Hibiki is nice, but NOT SOFT. She can and will fuck your shit up in multiple ways if you try to threaten people.
We're lucky Hibiki is such a nice girl. With powers like these...
She punched a God to pieces. She has every right to be smug.
Yes, ma'am indeed! Those arms <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Me like!
oh!!
MILCH
for some reason, the fang in combination with her red eyes give her some yandere vibe
woke as fuck
I have the same issue with Kirika and Shirabe.
that's fine
what do you mean by that???
Hardcore squat
The art in those games is beautiful
Ryobi is a mood





I prefer her transformed as well
She is amazing







I like Neps. And Senran Kagura. Especially Daidouji.
basically, oversaturation
<@!400844698140409856> They do because she is extremely popular in Japan, to the point where she is on almost every cover of the games and advertisements.
I know Yumi gets a lot of hate from the Fanrans, but I honestly like her. She has a great dynamic with her team, as she is kinda the "straight man" who struggles to gain the control.
Oh, hi, Yumi. I hope you like Yumi
Badass Yumi
Oh, I like that one!!
Wow, that's awesome.
or acid jazz
That pic with the saxophone gave me the idea of Jazz Fusion. That would be amazing
leave it to wfc to have every Kanade pic to every situation possible
Polka, Hibiki on the accordion.
power metal?
what style would they play?
I could see Kanade being able to play the guitar in canon
I see
I would make it really AU. all older, getting together to jam, and then they start to form a band, and start really small.
that's just Gear S1 with instruments.
a fucking double-neck. She must go crazy on those strings
Yeah! just like that!
or she will be the kickass guitarist
Hm, I could imagine Kanade being alive and the singer. Perfect for punk and rock stuff
AU where the gears form a band, anyone?
That's a fucking cool Maria pic!
She is like one of those tiny dogs that bark at other, taller dogs when their bigger friend is around to hide behind.

That's metal
just came to mind
so I don't know
Well, I am an atheist, I never read the thing
but then, how long was a day for that dude? he was not on earth, his days should work differently. They don't have 24 hours
the seventh
okay, that's true
he didn't make anything on the seventh
he had six days
Wasabi is great!
The last one is "Wasabi is hot!" I believe
That's all I can ask. Thank you.
why was I not pinged when nice sfw Maria art was posted? <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
nice.
I honestly always forget she even had a sister
I want that on my wall
hell yes
Oh, Regina!
<@!256802531584376833> Maria in a maid outfit, you say?
casual Maria is cute
Uh, I like!!
I could say "disgusting" and "yuk" now, but I am German, so...
many artists are good when they don't draw weird stuff. but then again, define weird.
I like casual Maria a lot.
Oh, thank you! Looks lovely
Judging by the fanart, she has a rather large fanbase. Missed opportunity, if you ask me.
Why isn't Carol in XDU anyway?
Clever
Oh, I see.
what the fuck?
No, she is just concerned that Bikki may come home and the food isn't ready yet

<@!137113218173632512> Like this?
I know today is about dess, but Maria is adorable in that pic
absolute waifu for me
ohh!! Pretty indeed!!
source: https://tuanonna15.tumblr.com

noice, Shantae
dark times
the real Bikki
I thought Miku had the girl peen
damn, that's good
Kitsune Kirika? Kitsirika?

reminds me of this
it's the "I'm a handsome devil and I know it" pose
It's simply the pose for me as well.
thanks. I like her pose, how she brushes through her hair. looks cool
<@!246146781832806401> can I ask for the full version of your pfp, wfc?
also, I don't kink shame. never did, never will.
oh, Love Live!
Kiri ate well, it seems
Maria is just head over heels for Basa. I love it
Also, she does her cool scissors. I love it
I'd buy it



Or better yet, her hair in a ponytail. Oh, yes!
She needs to let her hair down more, like in the shower scenes.
Maria should wear a cap sometime.
That is a great image. And yes, long hair under hat is amazing.
you...!!!
<@!246146781832806401> can you help?
well, the first two are "my"

the legendary Super Lesbian


I hope you find that image, wfc, I kinda wanna see it

Maria is way better
that jigglypuff/maria comparing is not for me. no, sir or madam
still, point well made

yeah, that's pretty much why she has that hairstyle
Nyaria is cute

of course, wfc with the counter-argument
All of the artist's doujin's titles are in grammatically correct German, which I find very interesting and adorable
I love this artist's stuff
Well, I did not want to assume.
my otp

new gen of Pokémon


that's good
never watched them. was around the time I stopped
I felt the show worked better when it was just little self-contained stories. I believe in season 3 or 4 was when they put in some overarching stories, which I did not like.
Equestria Girls, was it?
that's a lot
I am pretty sure it is, yeah
I can't even remember a split. was probably after I stopped
I still watched season 3, which was when I thought the jokes just fell flat and it lost a lot of its former quality. Didn't even finish season 4.
damn, that brought me back. I used to watch that show. Season 1 and 2 were legit funny and good
damn, that's good
Kanahorse?




oh, that scene was beautiful
"This is not Harasho."
Eli in the back is like: You can't be fucking serious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoZwStzDuN0
"Kotori? Hwhat??"
and Nozomi
I prefer NicoMaki.

I see
she looks like the leader of a street gang in that outfit.
"Yo, Basa! You ready to get fucked up?"
you know, I think Kanade would be the girlfriend who can drink more than you and burps *really* loud after chugging down a whole can of beer
Kanade a butch? Maybe. yeah.
because her legs are in them
you love Kanade's thigh high boots.
um... what's happening there?
getting fed by the wife. life goals
nom
who ever was on the receiving end of that swing does not exist anymore.

DiaAkko is cute.

you could have just asked if you wanted some pics of me <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
just stick with it, your collection will expand, Ocha
Determination and time
definitely some dupes in there
I got 1800 Maria pics
Every time you post her I am surprised how many pics you have of Kanade
is she legit thirsty in the show?
Her handle, it seems.
@DreamSynddArt is their handle
Actually, checking their twitter, they have a lot of the two.
Found it
There is another one with the two from the artist. Don't have it on my phone, but it's great.
I only watched the original Love Live, never Sunshine. I'm not too familiar with its characters
right, Ruby was her name
she's from Love Live Sunshine, right?
oh, that's cool.
But she was controlled. That doesn't count.
What is it with the Miku yandere meme, anyhow?
like i said: made for each other
Momria and Dadbasa
something about 1 billion YouTube views, I believe
I kinda like
Maria giving her future wife sass?
I want a Super Maria now
Or rather, Super Maria
Super Saiyan Maria!
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Durendal's Faust Robe, if my Katakana is correct.
Elfnein is useful. She always gives her best
oh, nice
yeah, but that one, though. she is kinda like an angry kitten
oh, that angry Canade is cute
comrade
no raised heels.
That's valid.
Someone found a waifu, it seems.
yeah, Imma go download that nyaa real quick
Hm, I'll check it out
okay, that's a premise
hm
what's it about anyway?
No, I haven't watched it. and yes, I know that the girls aren't that buff in the show.
I see
"Don't worry, she likes it!"
"And Chris, *would you please stop drying to drown Carol?*"
"I couldn't find a sitter, okay? It was either that or no trip at all."
Chris' face is amazing
Poor Maria.

that Bikki and Kanade stuff reminds me of the "The original, the remix" pic
oh, Maidria
she will kill you and you didn't even know it was coming
I know. You're a trendsetter
we need the fluff hair back
Cags in sfw? Miracles happen
I played FES. I guess I will finish that version first before starting P3P with the FeMC
I got P3P now, and wanted to play that
P3, for real? Haven't finished it yet
but sure, go ahead.
Well, the thing I love about Kawakami is not that she's a teacher, it's that she's mature and her story is sad, makes me want to hug her.
I hope we get more scenes with the partners in P5R
Kawakami will still be my Persona 5 girl.


Oh, I LOVE Samus!








cute game

oh, and that Chris smile reminds me:
It's a legit good look on her
open hair Ann is good

It's good in a weird way

I noticed your avatar before, but didn't want to say anything. I have a fever and thought I might have imagined it
I just felt a sting in my heart
Basa has some really cool fanart
Oh, pretty.
The episode is over anyway
*everyone facepalms*
Hibiki: "You two are gay? I had no idea!"
"Thank God. I thought we had to get a bigger wardrobe, because there was hardly room to store clothes with you two still in the closet."
Shirabe: "So, Kiri is not my biological sister?"
Basa: "No."
*Shirabe and Kiri furiously make out*
That's the season finale, the groundbreaking episode that flips the relationships of everyone on their heads
"She is sooo dreamy..."
and no, that pun was unintended
Tsubasa and Maria being sink-or-swim parents is kinda interesting
Tsubasa: "Better than losing out on experience."
Kiri: "Mom, look! I'm petting a dolphin!"
why are you trying to make it a drama?
(laugh track, theme plays, fade to commercial)
Tsubasa: "You know, maybe you were right... It was a bad idea to bring the kids..."
the colors of the rainbow follow the ultimate gay.
I thought Hibiki was already there.
Dive to gay?
ah, there it is. I skipped over it for some reason
really? haven't seen the first one
Pretty sure that's Maria on the right there. She got the hair
That mad lad actually did it!! He hearted the comment I made about how great it would be for him to draw Yang.
compared to the manga, one or two scenes are even toned down for the tv show
there is a reason why season 2 was rated 18+ in Germany, compared to season 1 and the OVA, which were rated 16+
but some heavy stuff in there
it's good. I really like it.
which is weird because I watched a lot of other shows before that with winter scenes
the first thing coming to my mind when I think anime and winter is for some reason the Yakuza arc in Black Lagoon, where Revy and Rock are in Japan.
she should draw Kanade in comfy winter clothes then, with mittens
oh that looks cool
they could still transfer the data to another storage device
only download
they never said that.
"Call me... Deepthroat."
"Okay, that's just nasty."
Tsubasa would be Frank Jaeger, Gray Fox
The leader was Liquid Snake during that time
yep, Foxhound
However, shortly thereafter, FOXHOUND rebelled against the U.S. Government, holding DARPA Chief Donald Anderson and ArmsTech President Kenneth Baker hostage, and hijacking Metal Gear REX and its nuclear armament, with the threat of launching one of its nukes via REX unless Washington gives them Big Boss's body and one billion dollars
Elfnein is Otacon
FOXHOUND
"Finé?"
"Rrng, Alca Noice."
"Genjuro, I infiltrated the enemy base!"

isn't there a KanaChris image?
***ENTIRE CAST***
I just realized I didn't make a harem related edit of the pic up there.
it would always be Kanade x everyone
well, we also pretty much agree she had to die because other ships would not exist if she was still around
yep
because she was too amazing.
but she will not use it to crush her enemies, just to make an entrance
She looks like she rides a monster truck into battle
nice
can you jump over Maria and Basa too?
Alright, I can accept that
yep, but aren't you supposed to stand under it to get a kiss?
but if it's in your heart you can't stand under it
Kanade ties a mistletoe on her spear and just throws it over everyone
that's what I like to see. Happy in winter with hot drink to keep warm
sweaters are nice










"Mom!! Not so fast!"






Oh, right, it's Kanaden. Of course you'd be the first to see her stuff.
<@246146781832806401>
Astral Kanade

keep up your training, young one, and you too can reach peak shitpost performance
entire essence captured in one image
I was about to say that you forgot the best one
we need to compare the sp/s, shitposts per second
but does it make you more powerful?
Mesa was faster
HA!

no prob

because it rains pics
I see. I thought it was supposed to be like rainfall
I always think Titanfall when I read that, Kerrik.
oops, dropped something
oh, indeed. Thanks!


(?) Kerrik will remember that
Kerrik.... is that... ***DUAL CHANNEL POSTING?***
quack?
you'd find a way
also, that's a cute smiling Bikki
we couldn't stop you anyway
no, believe me, you *think* you are prepared. I made the same mistake in the beginning
oh, boy, you are not ready
Kerrik right now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POy09x79WRk
We got a system! We'll be stinking rich!
and then we'll introduce Hibiboxes, literal lewd boxes, which you buy with the Shirabucks. Those contain the spicy art
very good
1 Dollar = 2 Shirabucks
yes! the one you buy with real money!
I see the issue
true
you know, like the dollar has pennies and such
as such, they compliment each other, like in the show
maybe Shirabucks can be the currency, and the Kiricoins are a unit from it
yeah, understandable. would cause confusion.
Kiricoin was a great idea, by the way. I love collecting those little gay coins
Symphoru symphoru!
genocide?
He won't stop, will he?

world peace
Maria flying through
okay
are you giving Kriisa crap for the way she writes?
Oh, indeed. That's perfect.
I don't think I would ask her to do it, honestly. Would feel weird to pay a friend for something like that.
I know, right?
Or her power armor
why is there no artwork of Maria in Samus' Zero Suit?


we got a million dollar concept
and once in a while, we start special events which increase the drop rate by another 1,5%, and we call those events Chris-mas
maybe Maria could be a Mariplier, a multiplier which one can buy for Shirabucks which increases the chance of getting rare drops by 1%
hm, good question
Maria is the High Priestess. Very good
*sniff* "Is that... is that gay is smell?"
When it's about DMJii, Kriisa is lighting fast
Panty & Stocking with DMJii
understandable
Iris Heart? Do you want to torture your enemies?
hell yes
Unigear is good, because Uni
The Nep x Noire ship is even called NepNowa
Nowa Nowa
Happy Chris is good
Sailor Snow
Maria: "Hey, it happened in *their* room!"
Basa: "I told you it was a bad idea to let them watch!"
I wouldn't be surprised
Kiri gained, it seems
Everybody Loves Tsubasa, the new sitcom on CBS

Chris x Spaghett

Look at how adorbs she is when she's happy.
But why is she uncomfortable again?
That's cute.
Rock music
nice
<@!256802531584376833> That's awesome. I reckon she is a difficult boss?
The way Maria has to hold of an angry Chris in that chibi comic is adorable. Chibi Maria is cute
Kiri with big boobs is kinda weird
<@!400844698140409856> Doki Doki Precure is some good stuff
But Chris asks in the last pannel "where are mama and papa?" Maybe Basa should wait a bit before making assumptions
"Mama mitai" dess!
that's cute
official artwork
oh, God, that's cute
Those are just random numbers and letters!!
stop hurting me
Not you too
I am so angry right now
No!!!
cute Maria!
sweater chris. alternate skin.
indeed

thanks, shirabe




Kerrik is weird like that, don't worry about it
here it is
he wrote
"DON'T LURK!"
the Basa pic seems to be traced from that
that pic was attached to the very first message Kerrik wrote to me.



Kiri fell asleep in the chair. Too real

he has some explaining to do then
thanks for the explanation
the Japanese and their puns.
Nanoha is a very popular show, and manga, and radio drama, and video game series.
yep, but good stuff
that's the order

the Nanoha anime has five seasons currently, and two movies, which basically retell the anime
Nanoha and Fate got together and adopted a girl. Everything is possible
Symphogear, but with coming-of-age story like Lyrical Nanoha. Could that work?
zura

cute Maria!
Chris can pull that hairstyle off and live. She knows how to fight, and she has friends who know how to fight
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
well, now you know
I know, right?
In case you wanna read up: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yukkuri-shiteitte-ne
that "Nep face" is a Yukkuri, a huge meme originating from the touhou fanbase.
Cute!!
NicoMaki, by the way
Überfülle, in German
plethora: too much of something
I did not know of the music at first before I watched it
yeah, basically
I can ignore those. For me the action and interactions are in the foreground, not the plot
Symphogear is not a trap, it's the light at the end of the tunnel
that Gen Hibiki Chris pic is adorable
into the sky, and the title appears
where the camera pans past them
That Shirabe has that action magical girl show opening pose
that's dedication
you have an archive with her appearances?
man, that's a lot of episodes.
Eli spoils Nozomi
JJIIII
DEESSS!!
over and over
But yeah, I could imagine being a fan of Kanade and seeing those scenes could not have been easy
and no Maria
I was trying to find Maria, but then it hit me: "Oh, that's from season 1. The dark ages."
~~me too, obviously. I was joking~~
Y'all are nasty with that gay stuff.
Edge Bikki all over the shop
death by snuggles
okay, but why though?
thanks, shirabe












Chris enjoying some music is surprisingly adorable
they were more stylized
I kinda liked the s1 transformations as well, because they were quick and on the point, and not pushed butts and boobs into our faces
Nah, she wants to be pampered by an onee-san, I reckon
ara ara...

I have no idea how that works
how?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518798189982384169/579400224942981140/SPOILER_headpat_her.png
paired with her rather tomboyish attitude
the hairstyle
yeah, honestly it is
(I almost wrote "Kriisa" when I wanted to write "Kiri")
the look really works, but Kiri would have to grow out her hair a bit
hey, that looks cute
oh, that is cool!
my favorite character from RWBY
she is great
from RWBY
Yang Xiao Long

Uuum, am I interrupting something?
of course
Especially when it comes to Shirabe
Kiri's imagination is very active, after all. She is a little silly fool.
Because she misunderstood. It's Kiri, after all
It's all just a misunderstanding. Shirabe showed Ogawa the present she wanted to give Kiri, and Ogawa said that he has an idea for an even better present, but it's too expensive for Shirabe to buy on her own, so Ogawa comes with and buys it for her.
yeah
those are the ones I have










I got some persona 5 finishing touches as well on my pc.
A Gear RPG with Persona gameplay would be amazing
Yes!!
right now she is just his mourning ice cream daughter
Those images aren't even rooted on canon. We know Neo cared deeply for Roman, but we don't know why.
urban, I would say.
that's difficult
that looks awesome. can we get more gears in those kinds of outfits, like, I don't know, Maria, maybe.
A Maria so perfect you need to post it twice

falling Lesbians
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
indeed it is

The black-haired one was Alex, yeah.
Sam, yes. She was my favorite as well
open in a new tab
weird in that show
absolutely nothing
What do you mean? Totally Spies was not a fetish show whatsoever, in any way. No, never.


"That's me!"
"Don't talk to me or my girlfriend ever again."
I bet Kanade did that back in the day
plant it, and a new Kanade will grow
That's Kanade's base form
because of the feather?
she looks like a highly stylized Metal Gear villain, like in those old artworks from the PS1 era
but leave it, I love it
Ikxi posted already, not you
oh that is really cute. Ponytail fits her a lot
Oh, those legs are delicious

big think
Kiriisa
I don't think it's inflated. She is worth more than she thinks
It's absolutely beautiful
HAPPY SHE!!!
THERE IT IS!!!!
***S H E***
She got gun!
even beautifuller
she is so beautiful. Look at her.
she has every right!
inflated?
I am conflicted!!
wait, is that Maria or not? Do I save it in my Maria folder?? <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
largest Kanade pic in the world, with the brightest grin ever seen
those 2TB are the size of one picture, mind you
I 100% agree to this message
fun fact: the rating is not there as a joke. The way it's worded it needs an M rating to stay on the site.
yes the spaghet
Thanks. I was successful then
<@!182890099183190018> https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12939936/1/Together-alone
delet!!
Kriisa!!!
very short, a few hundred words
Have you ever read the Chris fic I wrote?
"So, you're ready to fight for your spot on the bed?"
"Not today, I have a headache."
every night? that's exhausting
if Chris gets a girlfriend they need separate beds
and I'm like: yeah... yes I did.
yeah, she was like
HAHA
You said
trans
your reaction to "transition" was the same as Nara's when I talked about transposing a song.


<@!246146781832806401> There is a cute Kanadrink up there.
hm, possible
the kanjis mean "draft", so maybe it's a reference to the concepts?
really? interesting
But, a fine Finé Maria?
but is it still Maria then?
The three should be careful not to write any names in there, as this is the Death Note.
Absolutely. Maria's design is amazing.
adorbs
oh, damn!
Yukkuri gears
"Nee-san is the big sister that supports you and gets into shit with you but still wants you to be your own person"
That's pretty much Kanade
yeah.
maybe
nowa nowa
Japanese is wild
I put it in quotations because I did not know how to word it
that was what I meant.
isn't there also an "old japanese" word for it? Big brother has one.
indeed.
true
I personally don't think it would fit her
does she go ara ara, or not?
She has this cool big sister attitude right now.
This artwork looks very in line with her personality in the show. That confident, but gentle smile, together with the pose.
Momria is the good shit
we must test it
was just saying, it struck me as odd.
I never heard of that artist, so no, I can't
I was just saying, because we prefer to credit the people who did the art posted here, that's why we have Shirabe.exe
I see
why?
<@!246146781832806401> That puts an image in my head: Kanade coming out of the shower, and dries her hair with a towel with such vigor that she looks like a ball of static red feathers.
The fight between Maria and Kanade will shake the planet to its core.
and hers alone
Basa is hers
***YES!!!***
thanks
oh, wow, yeah, that's a very cool design
ouch

oh, same. my nep stuff is all over the place
But I could be wrong
I believe it's in the event where they visit Lastation for the first time.
I'd have to replay it sometime
I am pretty sure in 1 she says it as well.
She deserves better.
I believe she says: "I only do everything around here."
Doesn't she actually drop that reference in Re;Birth 1?
holy shit, you are right
Noire is a prime shitposter, honestly
but... but... TsubaMari...
Wait, if that apple is in space, is it a 
Ringo Starr?
NepU was fun.

Neporu!
what was the timeline command again?
dess_timeline
I am pretty sure she is 16 there. Could be wrong, though
<@266379640069685252> to answer your question about Kiri up there more in depth: She is dressed in a Dirndl, which is a traditional garb in Bavaria. It is worn by the women who hand out the beer. So, she is most likely a maid in that pic. If we are looking at the Kiri from GX onwards, she could also be drinking it, as 16 is the legal drinking age of wine and beer in Germany.
that's that good shit
The manga is about the little bundle of joy in the bottom right and her crush on her massive, shredded, *really nice* colleague. It's cute
when she appears, she steals the show, honestly
She is a side character.
I like the tomboy
it's a really cute series
<@!246146781832806401> "idk who this is but she's fluffy and I like it"
Here you go, the source: https://mangakakalot.com/manga/senpai_ga_urusai_kouhai_no_hanashi
are the three doing a butt bomb?
Ah, cool. It's not yet done.
<@437292788611153931> my other, bigger fic is called "A Solo For Two". You can find it on fanfiction.net
sure, a second
It's a change of pace compared to the other story I am currently writing
it was fun to write, I have to say
<@237964037898502144> It's true, by the way, I can not write her character for shit
post.
sure
yep
sure
I wrote a fic once about the gears visiting the Oktoberfest. Hibiki got wasted
yeah, don't overdo it, Kiri. Imagine her completely wasted
if you visit, for holiday, you can drink at 16.
nope. it is legal
well, if she is in Germany, at the Oktoberfest, I am pretty sure she would try it at least.
I read about a girl in China who had to get her stomach pumped because she had a shitton of bubbles in it.
fluffy smol Chris
https://www.deviantart.com/thyblake/art/World-War-II-RWBY-Prepare-for-War-792247688
Yes! Finally!!
oh, Komi-san
Maria as an angel is interesting, considering the origin of her name
that's adorbs
awwww...
I love Maria's look up there in the pic with Kanade and Hibiki. She looks like she goes: "This shit again..."
oh, I saw that Nessa inkling drawing. It fit dangerously well






good stuff
you are absolutely correct. Kawakami is best
Yes, ma'am!

I think I just died a little myself
<@!102691114762371072> yes, indeed it is.
Mood, honestly.
still getting messages?
Again, like Kriisa
or just someone who has style and grace.
fuck, that works better
You've been hit by, you've been struck by.. a smooth DMJii!

Oh, yes!!!
yarhar, thar be booty to plunder
Excuse me, I needed to post my favorite Maria picture.
I need more fighting/fit Maria
perfect!
that second to last one. That look.
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
YES!
oh, god, I was not aware. Garbage shit then
because it's art
I did not know someone took a picture during that time
oh, what am I doing there on the right?
I am sorry, Nara, I tried to meddle in what is clearly your expertise.
sorry
A Miss Steak?
So, she made a girl meat?
Carol's face is great. She is so done with everything.
Oh, the Senran Kagura leaders up there. Very nice pic
Indeed
Oh, yeah, she is adorable. And fluffy.
https://twitter.com/RunningPigeon73/status/1144174600814616576?s=09
hey, she tries, okay??
Sport Maria is my religion
Yes!! <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
The SG one was your idea, Kerrik.
Yeah, I did those edits.
<@!246146781832806401>
https://twitter.com/akisuke06080608/status/1146417193623543809?s=09
true
that's the other
"Characteristic of the deliberately unpolished or uncommercialized style"
where the definition is just the work itself
I've seen definitions not using "major"
one definition says this, the other says that
that bothers me now
"not belonging or affiliated to a major record or film company". Hm
no it's not? it's short for independent?
be independent and not needing publishers and stuff
yeah, and that's what indie is.
And aren't Trigger still indie? They are not dependent on anyone else, are they?
<@220201140141162496> I meant Wayforward. I wrote crap
also, it's impressive that an indie-studio like Wayforward has those connections.
How will it look? Will we get more cutscenes?
yep. Shared the tweet yesterday. I am so excited for it
oh, that's pretty

Madoka and AVGN
https://twitter.com/TripleKyun/status/1145921230907691008?s=09
I also thought for a second that it was one of Lily's drawings.
Ara ara?
As Shantae once said: "I don't even like creampie."
that's not a name, it's a concept
Seele Völlerei means Soul Gluttony
The fuck kind of name is that?
Her name is Seele??
Yandere Basa?
that was one of the reasons I dropped the manga. that and it became a constant repeat, I found
I don't. At first, yeah, they were charming, but they lost their appeal for me as they appeared almost every single time
can't wait to see it
I love when her cape is used to create some dynamic in the pictures
Her black gungnir design looks so fucking cool
oh, yes!!
or does the mangaka not believe in their own skill to convey this information in the drawings?
If I can be so bold: Those boxes with arrows explaining what's going on bug me a lot in Komi-san. Does the mangaka think we are not smart enough to get what she thinks or what's going on?
could have guessed that
I see.
why is Maria confused? I don't like that.
considering Basa gets a face full
what would you think it smells like?
floof hair
the original tweet was deleted
pito_sh on twitter
by Pito
This is the original, if I remember correctly
oh, yeah, that Maid-ria
Chris is dead
HELP!
oh, god, she is purring water on my face!!
already have it <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
honestly, it would be adorbs if they got together, let's be real here.
maybe Basa fell and hurt her ankle and is now simply embarrassed that she has to be carried.
and we don't know the context.
(okay, still don't know about Chris)
not with the main girls, but still
I mean, they can still happen.
I didn't doubt they were added for humor, I just did not find the amusing
talking for her? doesn't that one boy do that already?
Oh, Nozomi!
Best Maria!
yes!
Fate!
かわいい
I really like her design

saved it.
lots of great Maria art today
Nice!!
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
Make her proud!
I don't have those skills to begin with, so you are already a few steps ahead of me.
absolutely
<@173112001684439040> also, is that Maki up there, with the car? Looks cool
Oh, awesome!!!
cute Maria
yeah, her side tail is what really stood out to me
Her design looks absolutely great. I love her slight tomboyish looks
I've seen pics of her, though
I did not know who the character was until yesterday
That Shantae crossover image is great
Still the second most pissed bird I have ever seen
Maria looked great in that suit and sunglasses
uh, that's nice.
lesbian ghost
Wifes call their husbands "anata"
"anata" means "you", in a very affectionate way.
I love how she essentially calls Basa "darling" without knowing
they compliment it greatly
yeah, her hair and eye color were chosen around the colors of her gungnir
cropped it myself from this image
my avatar currently
and even then, I prefer the yuri that focusses on the relationship and characters, not the sex.
yeah
I don't like Maria lewds in general, unless it's TsubaMari bliss with a romantic feeling
well, you are not the only one. In fact, Kerrik carries the number of his images proudly in his name
however, my collection is almost exclusively sfw. the only stuff going remotely into nsfw is TsubaMari stuff
just ask if you want more
I got over 2000 Maria pics on my hard drive.
Glad I could be of assistance

















here you go, some of my fit/training Maria collection

spoiler: ||yes||




tomboys are great!
Bikkiro?
Shirabe's hair looks great too. That casual pony tail really fits her
oh, hell yes. Casual is the best
I know, right? She rocks that look
"my kids"



Raneaa knows the truth.


Chris never struck me as a harem queen, but head canon is head canon


I dream of this day


Senran Homura is great too
BOI!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5_Pc1ZK7aw
I got the feeling she could put a bucket there.
over 30, I believe
PreCure alone has a craptone of main characters
the characters in the image are, yes. But that's not all of them.
Nagisa and Honoka are still up there as my favorite Magical Girls ever
Cure Black and White were awesome.
Marisa!


enjoy
aftermath

oh, that's cool!
*gasp*
especially with your comment.
<@!188714906143424513> Isn't that tweet an XV spoiler?
I want that Bikki to be canon
I now wanna see Kiri beating up noise with a bat
that's adorbs
<@!246146781832806401>
for a second I drew a complete blank there.
she's from Vivid
of course.
ah, wait
doesn't ring a bell. Where is she from?

God, I love Yang. Badass, fluff, and strong.
Cool, thank you.
<@!99695384296701952> could that be possible?
happens


good shit
is that best RWBY girl I see there?
*double gasp*

Fisto
that's a really unexpected crossover.
Blessed image
um...
docking?
Kyurin Hibiki!
Matoi Miku!
together with Diana from LWA, by the way. Same VA as well.
<@476058996315389953> in Japanese, Maria and Weiss share a voice actress
yeah.
good man
LWA and Love Live too?
You mean of the image I posted?

Hence the connection
Weiss and Maria have the same VA in Japanese.
with Weiss
I see Maria
she dropped her drink, though.
Chris don't like sudden hugs. No, ma'am!
oh, yeah, that can happen. In games like this stock sounds are just inappropriate.
I love stock screams
The scientists in the original Crash Bandicoot series use the Howie scream when they fall down a hole. You can hear it in Crash Bandicoot 1 in the level The Lab, for instance.
yep, it's him. Understandably so, as it looks really good.
<@!246146781832806401>


I am a Metroid fan, I did not expect Samus.
That's a ship I did not know I wanted
pretty much me when I found that Yang pic.




badass touhous are great.
Merryweatherey is the artist


bad!
stop!
no!
enjoy


Who the hell do you think she is?



but in the moment, she would assist in any way she could.
oh, yes, absolutely.
you know, good question.
If her wife asks for it, she will be happy to oblige.
that's why I said, roleplay

roleplay and all.
I wanna imagine that's Basa under her boot.
yep
Like this?
You: "Can I interest you in my religion?"
Them: "What's your religion?"
You:
good idea.

shame, they should all know about the waifu.

this was mine for a while
I have Maria in her gear as my phone wallpaper












TsubaMari is the best.






<@!247701824335904770>








this is my phone wallpaper
I have to finish my TsubaMari fanfic some time.
I love the second to last one. "Oh, no, she is hot!"
her hair is amazing.
also, Kerrik, what?
she looks fucking beautiful like that. look at the volume in her hair.

that's that good shit
I wrote some for the writing prompts we have every now and then
you know it!


I can hear the music she plays
you know it.


I love that Persona finishing touch.




it did. I just like bringing up old shit

Memes

the other one was when they already tasted the blood of countless opponents.
humble beginnings
people pointed out that it's basically the bisexual bob.
have you seen her hairstyle change for volume 7?
Weiss has some really good character development.

don't touch it, though, if you don't want to die





That's the reason Barbara said she does not really act like the others do when voicing her character. Because Yang pretty much is her.
When Monty created the characters, he basically just took Barbara and put her in as a character.
and not only voiced by her. Yang's entire character is basically her.
well, she is voiced by Barb, after all.
I love her attitude.
She is badass.
Yang, for example. BEST GIRL!
RWBY is actually really popular in Japan.
RWBY calls them volumes
which leads to this image
(that name will never not be weird to me)
Oh, and Weiss Schnee from RWBY in the Japanese dub.
She also voices Diana Cavendish from LWA. She is my favorite character in that show. Who would have thought?
The composition of that song is so good.
I love the powerful strings in Ginwan Airgetlám, paired with Yoko's amazing voice. That woman could read the phone book out loud and I would stick to every word.
My favorite song from the entire show is Ginwan Airgetlám.



OTP
I wish Basa was.
*snap*
It's still the same team, Monty is just missing.
they point they were trying to make with that statement was that not completely different people are now working on the show.
it was not just him.
same with writing.
sure, Monty was a director, but he wasn't the only one
oh, but that's exactly what it was. the statement came directly from roosterteeth.
well, the good part is, roosterteeth are independent, and a bunch of friends first and workers second.
as long as the show is entertaining and fun, I'll watch it.
yeah, same.
the smoother animation is also because of the fact that they are started using mocap.
The team was always that: a team. They are just missing a member.
like the team once said: When Monty died, it weren't suddenly different hands working on the show, it was just a pair of hands fewer.
exactly
one of the reasons I prefer vol 4 onwards
oh, yes.
It's not the same, obviously, but I still really like it.
But I find they found their footings again in 5 and especially 6.
and he is no more, so obviously it shows.
<@!247701824335904770> That's Yang's mother. That's where she got the red eyes from.
more focus on plot
but I can understand why they cut it down.
yeah, that's true
I honestly prefer the show from volume 4 onwards.
yeah, this, pretty much
I admit, the first and second volume were rather meh, but they are short.
The fights are what sticks out, though.
I'd say so. It's entertaining and fun.
oh, yes it was. Own all episodes on BluRay
you wanna see her mother?
Revy is amazing.
That happens to her eyes always when she is angry. Comes from her mother's side.
I like how she just smokes the entire cig with just one breath.
also, Revy.






Blake for comparison
Yang, though, over the course of the show...
people are kinda split on her change, but I like it
this is what she looks like in volume 7.
a second
I am okay with that.
those "pants" are cut dangerously low.
Chris when seeing her friends in the box.
"Hey, um, Basa, what is my gear doing?"
"Maria, why do you have *that*?"
"I don't know, it just showed up!"
Chris already found some of the hidden features with her armor purge
not sorry
sorry
a doubleheaded one, most likely
you got a point
the gears can adapt, right?
Ha, DBZ Abridged reference
"Maria... I seem to have a problem..."
considering how she teases her sometimes
She's fine with it.
Basa knows Maria has a crush on her.
Maria becomes daring
very pretty art
I commented on that tweet.
Roberta's Bloodtrail is no picnic either.
quite possible
Yeah, true, but Black Lagoon had that jokey nature to it in the first season.
oh, and then the second season comes around, and the first arc is *dark as fuck*.
Action, violence, cursings.
It's great.

(I'm not)
sorry about that.
I want that
we need it
Yang with baseball cap
Let me one-up you:
anyway, back to art!

Ha, yeah, that line
It's so dangerously catchy
that was the song that came to mind immediately
yes!
Did Monster Girl Quest teach you nothing??
awoo
oh, yeah, I have that gif. Good Samus content!
Yuugi is great too
Yes!! How she suddenly started to talk like Yumi and shit
Yeah, that's how Dai looks regularly
Yuu Asakawa, her voice actress, streams a lot on YouTube.
She is so fucking dangerous that the big yoma from the second part kept its energy level low enough so nobody felt the need to send her after it.
She is more very, VERY confident. And she has every right to be.
That is how Daidai do.
Hell yes.
Senran Kagura is a videogame series first and foremost

Daidouji from Senran Kagura

Girls with toned abs are good civilization
~~I want Maria to deck me~~
oh, yes! Action Maria!!
The wives in concert
new wallpaper
Cute!!
indeed. A fellow Maria fan I can talk to at a reasonable time
for me it was the afternoon
very good
oh, that looks cool
Kirika hit the gym hard
<@246146781832806401>
suits her
The M in MIB of course stands for "Maria"
Good stuff
even better

Oh, that coloring is amazing
nice!
okay, that beach Kanade's expression is great
Oh, I have that Maria already. It's lovely
I just wanted to post it because I like it
the one I posted?
perfect gif


beautiful


I don't recognize the kanji
Smiling happy Maria is a blessing
What the hell, Kiri?
because he said a line like that in Spongebob
I love the one where Maria carries Basa.
B: "So, what do you want to do now?"
M: "I... I don't know. I didn't think I'd make it this far."
Those images are good civilization
Everything must be saved
I think I have a problem. I save every instance of Maria in images, no matter how small (as long as it's sfw, with the exception of TsubaMari)
NICE!
"baaang!"
good civilization
That excited Chris, though
Whenever best girl appears, it's a good time
Thank you, wfc

Is that Gelbooru?
But she is not Jigglypuff
Cute!!!
I follow him on twitter. Already saw it. Good stuff.
it's good. I thought it was official merch
I didn't even notice she did that
ah, now I get it
I did not quite get it
you mean someone is the food?
okay
Are you making a joke on behalf of my name?
Chris x Food!!!
or, if you don't mean it, gomenasike
Gomenasorry
I believe I know that picture. I just love how it sounds.
arigathanks? I love this weird Japanese/English mix
she played herself
thanks shirabe
strange design
Pinterest is weird
gelbooru allows more "stuff", if you catch my cold
because Gelbooru is known for tagging EVERYTHING in the pic
oh, okay.

all their personas are named after musicians, I reckon
Okay, that LL/Persona thing looks awesome
A big part of the tree trunk lands on her head, but just breaks in two upon impact.
I wanna imagine Daidai rescued the kitten from a tree. By de-rooting it.
DAIDOUJI!
like that, yes
Or anything besides NozoEli
like when Umi is shipped with anyone but Kotori
so rare, that for some reason the ship seems "wrong" to me, even though it's not
that's indeed rare
indeed she is
Nico was great
NicoMaki was my fav ship in the original Love Live
well, I reckon people know which image I was referring to
yuri is good stuff
okay, just this once
I don't like any of you
she is cute!

AKARI~N!
Everyone was a freak, more or less, honestly
He was just ridiculous
Kill La Kill is some good shit. Ryuko is one of my all time favorite characters




the duality of mankind
likewise. Look at those arms
believe me, I did not name this picture "perfection" without reason.

indeed
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>


change my mind
Nico is their baby.
So this is all the more amazing to me.
I can't draw worth anything.
Wow, that looks great!
It just rubs me the wrong way
I mean this busty
I don't like Tsubusta
no, Basa is fine how she was intended: flat.
this is not right
Yeah, it's Setsuna, or Cure Passion, from Fresh PreCure, season 6 of PreCure.
~~Ryuko x Satsuki~~
cute!
that Uni hair is so fluffy!
Good shit!
you know about those comics, Raneaa?
dynasty-scans as them as well.
oh, even that artist who always uses German titles. I love their TsubaMari stuff
oh, you want the entire pic? that will be impossible without stretching it.
weird, the pic looks smaller
so, the picture is too big for your screen, right?
I could edit it to your resolution
do you have the image at hand?
1.080 x 2.240
never heard of that, let me look it up
which phone?
PC or phone?
too big?
she plunders booty
I love it
that Maria pic was my profile pic on Discord for a while
my phone background is this one:
<@!247701824335904770> yes, *singing*
she couldn't find it after the night with Tsubasa
*gasp*
when we get an HD version, I can rework it
good to hear.
if we find a high-res version, is will look better
the image pixilates, sadly, I tried to save as much as I could
how is this
just so I know how far I can stretch
what do you want to be visible in the pic?
I got Photoshop
I can cut it to what you want to see, but I can not keep everything in without stretching
Me: "Oh, cool, new Maria art!"
PC: "Are you sure you want to overwrite the existing file?"
Me: <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
👍



let me check
"my bullets hunger for flesh!"
Chris is fucking pissed!
I like that artwork. The face looks great. Weirdly deranged, but still in character

"I know who you're thinking of..."
that smug grin.
radiant smiles
lämö
yes! we did!
Discord sometimes needs a bit to buffer them
I can

the fucking suits, like, holy shit.

that pic of Chris, Kiri and Shirabe in suits and sunglasses reminds me of this one Love Live fan art
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
(I absolutely did not try to ping you with @Kriisa)
<@!102691114762371072> adult Kiri
Always remember: The thing we call failure is not the falling down, it's the staying down.
okay, that's her name now
Maria is just misunderstood!!
it's pretty!!
where she stomps the fuck out of her
sounds like fan art from the attack Bikki did on Carol.
the red claws sound like the ignite mode
I don't know anything about guns, honestly
oh, I know they are, but that's what the gun reminded me off.
That gun reminds me of the one Alucard uses in Hellsing, and now I want Elfnein or Carol as Alucard
damn
"Shut up, I have tits!"
damn, Chris, doesn't that hurt?
Good shit!!

that's probably the oddest interpretation of a fan "nickname" I have ever seen
***WHAT?***
okay, looking at this picture, one thing comes to mind:
Maria needs no pity. She is strong.
oh, a transparent ghost.
pretty what, Kriisa?
It's "I", right?
Maria and I? Shit
You are just doing it to make fun of Maria and me.
I don't have to prove anything. You know you are wrong.
the lies is what I see when I look at your chards!
that's not the numbers I have here on my desk
all the more reason to hug and love her!!
WHY?
NO!!!
Lies!
She does not cry all the time!
I love her to bits. And as such, I want her happy.
Ha. Ha.
I don't like crying Maria. No.
I don't like Maria being the butt of any jokes
okay
hum
um
hm
right, that's what it was
there it is!
yes!
She is just that fast
By the way, I love the detail that *Miku* is ahead of everyone else
there was a funny comic with Basa riding a Segway through a group of Noise
oh, no, we weren't, it seems
I know you do, wfc. I was referencing the comic.
Basa has a Segway
wait a minute, is that Nobu's hair? Holy fuck, that's a lot of hair.
wfc, where is the pic of Basa falling into Kanade's hair exhausted?
let me see if I can find it
That pic reminds me of that silly RWBY comic
Maria must have some damn good conditioner if her hair can stay like that when wet.
Miku is fucking thirsty as hell
I knew he would have them
there it is
Where is her beautiful face??
Thank you, you are correct
Angel Maria is a blessing
this is art

catbasa
<@!246146781832806401>
this is perfect
cool, thanks
what kinda software is that?
what basa does up there
the nose
always clean your sinus
"I AM GAYER THAN I THOUGHT!"
who would be top?
Kanade x Cags
hey, weird idea:
hey, Fudo went there first
fudo x Yatsuhiro's wife
sorry, but I draw the line at Fudo x Elfnein
Elfnein is hungry for icecream
Oney? Chris O'Neil?
I forgot about that
oh, right, she was able to smile
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Nowa!



"Quick, take my hand! We're doing gay shit!"
Ninryu posted Serena, Yukari.

Maria just rocking those shades
Fußball!
I have a pic of Maria cooking
I saw that the tweet has one more image.
A happy Basa is a good Basa
why is Basa crying??
isn't that how the first time always is?
Vocaloid Power Rangers
have you watched the show?
I mean, it's pretty obvious, I say.
Baby Basa is adorable
don't capitalize the "thanks"
thanks shirabe
I'd say a bit. They refer to a scene and are screenshots from the episode
||Do it!||
XV spoilers! ||Yeet the baby!||
akachanbe
I won't
hey, napes are sexy, let's be real here
you like what you like
hey, I am not kinkshaming
hey, I mean, you're not wrong
yet
no hairspray in the world can achieve that.
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Maidria?
wait, if she only knows how to fight, how does she know how to create a mess?
Oh, but I did
Kanade would probably tell Basa to clean her shit in the nicest way possible
"Bada"

That reminds me of that comic where a tiny Chris calls Gen papa
Heaven No Rend
Ame No Heavenrend
don't fool yourself
you mean *Heavenrend*
the scissors will just break
can't wait to have children myself someday
all those child gear pics warm my heart
*fluff!*
ah, that
asexuality is a thing.

nice!
Sucubus Kanade?
that's cool
I said you weren't drinking, Rany, and as such, still thirsty
still thirsty
Rany isn't, it seems
extreme thirst
she would
but it's a cute Maria pic, so I had to save it
same, never my cup of tea
same, I will buy some today
absolutely
haven't eaten curry in ages
I should have some again
curry is great
B: "Maria, I can take this off now, can't I?"
B: "Can't I?"
B: "***CAN'T I?***"
M: "Nope."
B: "Wha..."
*gasp*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epg_uZDHuAY
has a lot of fanmade stuff, even animes
you should look them up, they are fun
Attacks with knives, stops time...
Her move is even called "Sakuya's World" in the fighting games.
To be more precise, she references Dio.
Sakuya is probably the biggest JoJo reference in Touhou, by the way.
Deadliest maid
Sakuya!
I understand why Fate likes rain.
I prefer some older visual styles over the one commonly used currently
but yeah, you're right
"dad"
lütt!
Stand name: Alestorm
She becomes Hibiki's Stand or something
I don't know what kind of energy this pic has
either they are a girl group, or a gang

two degrees of "huh?"
good stuff.
I know this one!
and plays the hardest screamo known to man

Four Girls is better
why do these pics make me want to pet and protect her?
the last one, look at the mess she makes
Onee-sama!!
Misaka!
oh god, that's great
Misaka is great
Vierzehnmalschaun
Zwölfja
Elfwan
and a big smile
the third from the right has a *long* upper body
I don't. I love Kawakami the way she is
someone follows Senran fans on twitter, I see
Kana-eyes
now that I look at it again
for me, the picture looks like Maria is consoling a crying Basa.
hopefully they will
But she is crying. That's not good!
No! Maria!
spoiler tagged
Ninryu already posted it a few hours ago, anyway. It's up a few
oh, that was unexpected
lot of good stuff
Gosh, Ninryu, I wonder who you favorite character is...
<:minowhat:574753342593695744>
why, yes, thanks, that's exactly what's going on.
#Waking
this one
https://youtu.be/H8z4ICdh2Bw?t=203
I imagine their conversation being like that one scene from Plastic Nee-san
when your wife does not want to come to bed


indeed
this channel is for art, after all

<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
the lighting, Solo
Well, yeah, Helga is good too, but Leo is adorable
Is she cute or what?
I like the coloring
that's really good
Man, Gen is shredded as hell. Look at him up there.
or rather: ban!
bang!
One of my favorite pics of all time

maybe later today
I still have to watch the newest XV episode, I just remembered.
The pic looks cute, though
Chris is smol, and Maria is the tallest, true.
man, Chris is smol
When you walking

That twitter has some gems
https://twitter.com/NoContextKagura/status/1165830151885729792?s=09
what did you gain from posting this last one?
but not shared recently
It was shared, I have it saved
Don't know, never played it. I just stumbled over it on the eshop and loved how it looked.
It's from a game called Pantsu Hunter: Back To The 90s
Gonna post this pic here too, because this is art! I love the 90s style.
Blue woman viciously attacked by tiny marshmallows
Maria size is good size
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
and why is he looking away from her then?
and Maria will grab it and gently put it down. "There you go, little buddy."
maybe even on the taller side
if you are 177cm you are of average height
not 5'10"
that's 5'01"
Chris is 153cm, isn't she?
Maria is great. In character and height
they eat well
size does not determine beauty. you can be cute and beautiful.
headpat
like I said, headpat size
indeed it does
that's headpat size
she is a marshmallow
so, around as tall as Cags
I am 183cm
While I love Maria, I must admit that Chris would be the cutest daughter you could ever want
but why bulli precious? why not protec?
Poor little Chris. Why does stuff like that always happen to her?
Kanade does not use spray. Her hair just grows like that

I just meant I have never seen them as cat ears
I have that too, just sayan
Again, I never see it as such
but the hat is cute
it's just her hairstyle
I've never seen them as cat ears either, and still don't
She is of common height for a European woman, but compared to the other girls, she is a giant
just saying
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658> <- best
sorry, I had to. That joke jumped me.
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
it tightens up your shit?
very good, Aria
Drinking with Kanade?
and drinking.
her boobs are also bigger than Shirabe's head in that pic...
they are well-trained thighs
yes
neck long so she can reach the high hanging leaves
no, she smol, actually

basically, you call someone or something a cinnamon roll in reference to this meme if you want to protect them and consider them pure.

you don't know the meme?
yes
yuk
noice
yeah, no, thanks.
especially when it's a "comedy" or romance show
I hardly watch anime. It would probably just eat space on my hard drive.
can happen, though
ouch
bloodshot eye? yikes
I hardly see heterochromia used
Heterochromia is a nice touch on characters

~~friends share friends with friends~~
wow
Gee wfc! How come the internet let's you have *two* Kanades?
oki
your call, wfc. still want it? I got it

Commie's are not <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Oh, I have to watch the new episode. just remembered when you mentioned YT
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
only know the memes
I never watched the show
***ANONE, GODDAMN!***
if you drink it, would that be vore? <:ElfneinThink:611252684497879041>

too big is bad
Lots of massages by her wife, I reckon
Elfnein is too precious
That's cute!
Fuck, yeah, Gen!

yeah, you shouldn't
Abs are good civ
But hey, Uppers is coming to PC, and it has Daidouji as a playable character.
would be cool to play as her.
yeah, sadly
That's Marian in River City Girls, the new game by WayForward that was released  few days ago.
I know, right?

unless she takes a shower, it seems

the fact her hair stays in shape after being in the water is fascinating
and supporting her
simply by being there
also, Maria will make her days good.
Got ya
Just Basa, silent, empty eyes
I expected a Basa reply like in the "But you eat ice cream everyday" meme
That's fine, because they are meant for each other
Stop it!
why are you peeps thirsty in sfw? and for Maria??
yep. You didn't have those days?
the character seems pretty energetic
I see.
so, Nana Mizuki voices her too, I reckon.
hm, I see
ah, no wonder
Hm, Levi does not ring a bell. But I haven't watched all of Nanoha yet.
what crossover is that? Recognize Basa's gear, of course, but who is in it?
smol

Maria with revolvers. Interesting concept
They are all woke as fuck
Cute!
ninryu, she may be slavic, but don't forget that she did not grow up there. She was a test subject in her childhood
HEY!
I see Maria more as a light weight in that regard
"If I have to deal with her birthday, I'm doing it wasted."
Nah, she wants to get herself trashed.
Vodka
What does Kanade have there?
"Tini" is my nickname for my sister. Weird.
"I am not cleaning this shit up!"
Edge Bikki looks like she balances between screaming in anger and crying in despair
There is a legit deeper love and appreciation for the character
Because for you, it's not simply a sexual thing. You don't find Kanade just hot. There is more
Oh, yeah, that's what you mean. I get ya
you want to like them for who they are, not who they pretend to be
Yeah, makes sense
I think I understand
it's just not the real thing, right?
ulcers are a form of overreaction. Not everyone gets them from hot food or dehydration. I only get them from tomatoes.
I'd be down for fun, Rany. I don't drink alcohol, but I don't need it to go apeshit

oh, I remember getting hit by those things
The fights are often really drawn out, I must admit.
and I like that
To completely understand the entire story, you have to watch everything, pretty much
I enjoy the entire franchise
Chris doesn't know what to think
Same energy
Hibiki's face, for some reason, reminded me of the line "Aw, yeah! This is happenin'!" from Sonic Adventure
and still I hear sonic when I see the pic
Kerrik posted that in nsfw yesterday.
The idolmaster character sachiko koshimizu
Oh, no, whenever I see her, I can only think of those memes!

oh, okay
what?
That would be me, honestly
CUTE!!!
<:MariaSunglasses:611251941988892682>
Why was I not pinged for sfw Maria art?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>




<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
hey, i made that
anytime
Maria should be even buffer, if I can be honest

Yes, give me a minute
<@247701824335904770> Got it!
<@247701824335904770> no, but give me an hour, I'll be back from work then.

I never got the thing about thicc thighs
the head
I wanna headpat her.
that's cute
Das is fünf jetz.
5pm? you mean 17:00
that sounds kinky
I have the project files saved, easy to make more
Look what I still have


indeed
artist is ticcytx on tumblr

Worst is interesting
biribiri
I never watched Sunshine
nothing
Todokete...
NicoMaki, by the way
The anime was cute
I enjoyed LL.
People not knowing Eli... What world do we live in?
Cute!
Harasho


that reminds me of that little LWA comic
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>

it's a reflex to see her wife up close

That last one is pretty!
oh, that's pretty
Oh, interesting combination


this one is cute
for you weebs

Oh, this is a good one:
It's the time of year again


The thing she is cuddling with, called Little Birdie, is a cloned Ridley, the creature who killed Samus' parents and who she killed in Super Metroid

This image is blessed and cursed at the same time, if you know the story.











okay, Samus time
with sound
yep
That Maria comic is a reference to a video
That's Komi-san comic...
"This is nice in it's own way..."
*it's*
***it's***
time to go deaf!
At least Basa appreciates her fans
there is a first time for everything.
She'll learn to deal with it.
Maybe Maria will become better at it, as her confidence grows
quite possible
or, maybe Maria really has a much more... lively site to her, one she only shows in private with Basa.
and if Basa likes to get tied up...
Nah, Maria will be very shy about it, but she'd love to make Basa happy
Miku looks with pity towards Chris, imprinting her face into her mind, as it will be the last time Chris will be seen
Hibiki just about had it

T: "Ummm, Gen...?"
G: "Oh, for fuck's sake..."
punishment for being too cute
Chris is dead
so wholesome
okay, that last NanoFate pic is great.
That's a legit choice as well
There can never be enough Maki

Love Live racing would be awesome

Let me real quick post best Love Live
That Maria is so pretty
you could have said "Mary"
I didn't even see him there. (Like many other Nanoha fans)
walleyed Haru and spooki Nanohas. Nice
That would be a great idea
very good
Ryuko is easily one of my favorite characters. I love her attitude
considering the source material, not surprising
She is great
I love her
Ryuko!!
I got a higher res version somewhere, but I can't find it.
some art

true
ah, that shitshow
ah
And who is that favorite youtuber?
That's the thing
German military still uses it, because it is *not* Nazi
Witch Maria is good
ah I see
Jesus fuck, Discord sucks dick currently
if she is ww2, I am pretty sure her outfit needs more swastikas. But I can understand why they did not go with that.
so the character is a personification of a ww2 ship?
Considering you said "is", I reckon you mean the current one
<@!285794457033506816> Kriegsmarine?? I hope you mean the Deutsche Marine, because Kriegsmarine was the Nazis.
poor Chris
Meido Chris-chan
Knowing DDLC, all but one die
I love that song. I have the mp3 of it, full version
Ryuko is cute. I have a poster of her, and a mouse pad somewhere.
you wanna talk about that, Rany?
やさし
She does it for her kids
Who would be Samus, then?
Engage Ridley Mother Fucker
Rany, we seem to be siblings in spirit. Strong women are a big yes
Oh yes! CAPE!

Happy Maria is good Maria
oh, yeah, I know that one. It's adorable
I watched the first season. was cute
good Love Live emote, too
maybe you will find a reason to wear "girly" stuff too
just be yourself, Rany
australian bunny
could Basa be jealous?
I feel ya
I got both
Maria cold! Warm her, Basa!
I like how they have colored mugs. Kinda live a partner look
maybe Monster Hunter?
Maria, what are you doing??
that adult Carol looks cool
oh, that's a thing already. of course it is
they are not!
no.
true. same approach I took with my fics. Didn't find what I liked, so I did it myself
yeah, it's a bummer
That Maria looks great, Rany.
I like that Maria
Viel blau und rosa
really? She even posted it here
Rany does some good stuff
it's the result
TsubaMari, of course.
I am okay with that
okay, that Basa with Monster is great
goddamnit
I read that "bomber" as "boomer"
Do not make fun of Maria
Kriisa...
lots of good Basa
billion dollar smile
yep
she always does to every post by Shirabe.exe
powerful women are my aesthetic. Like, holy shit.
I don't know, I really dig the dangerous atmosphere in those pics. A woman you don't fuck with
because there it's save
great energy
I see ***SHE***
you know how they are
Young woman defends her wife against obsessive weebs, 2044.

the mobile game is legit fun, by the way
jii_skip
That's what got me interested
Trust me, I *know*
oh, I know
I want to, not yet
Maki Succubus will visit Nico tonight


you're welcome, sister
Maki is indeed the best
you have perfect taste
of course
easy trick
jii_skip
type in jii_skip before posting if you do
Daidouji, one of the most popular characters of Senran Kagura in the west, has almost no fans in Japan
not that marketable in Japan
the hat.
the bottom one is what I think of when I think Nobunaga
hell yes
fan, I believe
do you have the one where she stands in at a concert because Basa is sick?
hmmmmm
those eyes
wait
just to hammer the point home
I like how she constantly uses Kanade's full name, even.
"Tsubasa! Happy birthday!"
"Thanks, Mari..."
"Uh... Maria?"
"Nope! I am Kanade (daze)"
"You're Maria, right?"
"Nope! Kanade!"
that's a strange birthday gift.
oh, that's weird
I have a pic where she bends over to do it, and it's only betrayed by looking at the background

Glass No Hanazono from Love Live
Sexual Healing by Marvin Gaye
another billion dollar smile
From Lily, for Lily
"Guess where this will be going."
grumpy Miku
indeed

hey, that was not nice, Kerrik!
I will write a little TsubaMari fic today, I believe
I like it
sounds like shenanigans
Yes!!!
yeah, it's a great detail
oh, nice!
I don't even know why that surprised me, I do the same.
"Draw better"? I guess everyone is their own worst critic.
<@263983345669505025> of course!

source is van heist on deviantart. His stuff is great

she is receiving a signal
Spaghet
Kerrik, that Fairly Oddparents post. Holy shit.
or Zombisa?
why not Zombasa?
Ganbare, Kerrik-Chan
wow
Jyushimatsu Matsuno from Osomatsu-kun
She also appears in DBZ, albeit rarely
In that scene in the manga she brought a dead Goku over, I believe.
That's Uranai Baba from Dragon Ball
oh, really? the black and white one?
you don't know Shin Chan?
that would be cool
I think Maki is just adorable. She is head pat daughter material
Maki is cute
Maki is best.
Oh nice, I see BiBi
that's good
yurifucker. Now that's a name.
look at that hair!
look at the leg work
oh, damn.
Adult Carol has so much Ojou-sama energy
SakuMeiling is good civ
Tomb Nowaider
I have stuff playing non-stop
and I never would want my child to be an only-child. Siblings are fun.
I could not imagine being an only-child
don't beat yourself up over it
you are alright because that's all you know.
It's great. We laugh a lot
my sister is a force to be reckoned with, though. We love to throw verbal jabs at each other.
I have only a younger sister
That reminds me of a RWBY fan comic, where Yang gets picked up by Raven, because she was in a fight with a boy in her class. Raven picks Yang up, and gets the report card from her teacher. In the car, Raven sighs, rips the card apart and says: "He is a shithead anyway."
M: "We are not enabling this kind of behavior!"
K: "I am not enabling, I am just asking."
Maria and Kanade are like the mother/father archetype in TV shows. Their child was in a fight with another kid at school, and Maria and Kanade pick it up. In the car, Maria is like: "I am so disappointed in you."
Kanade: "I hope you beat his ass, though."
I like stuff like that. Kanade always had that big sister vibe to me
awww
I love how her being Scottish is just accepted by the fanbase.
oh, that arc
a very good Touhou artist had to remove his pic from Deviantart because it showed the character Kagerou with a Monster can
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Energy#Trademark_protection_and_lawsuits
They legit do that if they find out about someone using the logo
waiting for Monster to threaten the artist with legal action.
like a lot of obscure manga, really
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
hm, interesting...
SLANDER!
LIES!
YES!
<@!246146781832806401> Great gif! You go, girl! Look how happy she is.
Is it wrong to pick up Nowa in a dungeon?
Yukkuris?
Of course, Maria's black gungnir was amazing
I like Vanessa's design. She has this mix of classy lady and dangerous asskicker.
Elfnein, the friendly ghost
Marirabe
Hawwlloween
Everyone wants to floof her
That's precisely why she is angry!
the best one
if it's pair the spares, why not KanaChris, or SereChris?
because both are dead. that's the only connection
oh, cool
Yang best
Indeed
sure
I liked Odyssey. It's the only AC game I enjoyed, pretty much
<@247701824335904770> Oh, that's a great pic.
Pancakes



Their take on the characters is great


true, it is her birthday, but still
Ruby, what the hell?
I wanna headpat her
gunguni sisters is the best. Maria is so adorable in them.
I read that as "five eyes", and I was so confused

That DBZ reference in that Basa/Maria fusion




Nice
indeed

Ticcy is the mistress of DiAkko. She does a lot of it.
Draw all the Dianas



there goes Rany's money...
DiAkko are relationship goals

You're very welcome. Enjoy.
<@247701824335904770>
Those four are a very good start, I find
and the sequel to that one:
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12726775/1/MindLess
Another great one:
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12681765/1/MindFull
Sequel to the first one:
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13122014/1/This-Side-of-Paradise
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13101655/1/The-Magic-We-Share
oki. If you enjoy reading them, though, I can recommend a couple good ones.
It doesn't matter how good you are at writing, as long as you have fun.
create the Diana of your dreams
Write some fics, too.
very good.
stop lying
You are only tricking yourself, not me.
<@247701824335904770> Oh, someone has a Diana crush <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I like how Chris just boots her. "Get on with it, for fuck's sake!"
But for cats?
Also, from multiple partners, and all the same age.
Oh, I will give it a go

amen, wfc
Reminds me of "Birth by Sleep 249/5 days" or something from Kingdom Hearts
Under Night In-Birth? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
okay, good point
wfc, please
ヒルダさん
Nice. I love the biker look on women

that's true love.

Oh, I know. Still weird and without sense if translated.
Das ist Kanone?
Musashi's hair is great
Vanessa manges to combine ass-kicking and being a lady perfectly.
Onee-san energy.
they are spinning
motion, basically
That's love
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Why do I hear him going "Onii-chan!"


I really like short hair. I think it looks great. I don't mind long hair, of course.
so, kinda a "letting your mind float" kinda thing?
it's all a consent thing, after all. if you don't like it, there is nothing erotic or romantic about it
sure.
it's about trusting the partner, completely letting go
wfc gets it
Well, I guess getting stepped on by her doesn't blow you to pieces
People do not want to get punched by Bikki, but how many of you want Maria to step on you, huh? <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
She is the reason I name every playable female video game character Seras
Oh, Seras Victoria. One of my favorite characters ever
MALK
Great TsubaMari!
as in, she is actually part of the realistic scenery
the shader looks great. makes it look like Bikki is actually standing in the scene
yeah, you're right
Ah, I got ya
as you don't have to think yourself, so to speak?
but the "ver" in Verwarnung is pronounced very close to "fair", with a very hard "F" sound.
well, written, the connection is there, at least
(The Ver in Verwarnung is also not pronounced like the name Ver, by the way)
Warnung means warning, that is correct
Verwarnung actually means something closer to giving someone a slap on the wrist, or to caution someone
odd
okay?
<@!203444794737950720> Verwarnung?
alternate timeline where Shirabe died?
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>


PERKELE!
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
***RWBY volume 7 chapter 4 spoilers!*** But so cute!
Maria ***YES!!***
Oh, angry Maria. 
T: "Calm down, Maria, they are a fan and just wanted a handshake!"
M: "They touch my wife, they die!!"
I mean, the pic is cool, but why boob laser?
Like this one, where she dresses as a giant lizard and destroys Tokyo. Doesn't get wilder than that.
I like images where Basa goes all out and does something wild. She is usually very reserved
B: "Take that, tower!"
C: "What the hell are you doing?"
just for convenience, because of the link provided by Shirabe
the original
CUTE!
there it is again
It's her YouTube channel
<@354402389282783235> Fun fact: That video was made by Saki.
Awww! She's adorable!
I made a few more of those, but that would flood the channel


👍
I found this much
https://www.melonbooks.co.jp/detail/detail.php?product_id=587925
<@!247701824335904770> https://twitter.com/mugetsu_illust/status/1201803684188848128
You know her name? maybe you'll find it on pixiv
I know her from that meme scene
Okay, that is an amazing drawing
"Anyway, here is Wonderwall."
oh, nice.
Please drink responsibly, Maria.
nom

Mordred has some amazing design
I will get Hellsing Ultimate, too, someday
Black Lagoon is the only anime I own the BluRays of


yeah, indeed
I got the full version of the opening on my phone
The show is amazing, yeah.
look at her. One draw, and it's gone

Probably the only character who I didn't care was smoking was Revy from Black Lagoon, because she was batshit insane. Well, everyone smoked in the show, so it was kinda a "whatever" thing.
Yeah, I know, still.
tabacco
yikes. Smoking?
could be a little more buff, but that's nitpicking, really.
Rinko is an anime mom. She doesn't have the hair. She is save. Not from the porn artists, but save from anything else.
yeah.
oh, no. Chris has *the hair*.
"HibiKuri" is an interesting combination I don't think I ever read.
Nya
Chris is canonically a math genius
oh, that looks cool!
<@246146781832806401> Oh, that looks cool!
https://twitter.com/ChuuniOniika/status/1203201063425363968?s=09
for a second I thought Kanade was about to bend Godzilla's arm behind its back.
Yes! So cute!
<@247701824335904770> so cute!
They are going too far, as always.
That DMJii pokey comic with Maria looking on in shock is great.
you were going to sleep, Rany

Yes!
<@!193232244867858432>

"Everyday I go to work, the same crap..."
<@!247701824335904770>
oh, that is cool
Oh, yes!
Super Saiyan Kanade?
Kotori? HWhat?
and Sims 4
I have yet to watch the last three. Been busy with work and music.
That last image. They are about to kiss!
Dear Maria deer
wanna pet and give snacks
big birb Kiri and birb Maria and bird Shirabe? Too cute
Goddess of Justice who does wrestling? Hell yes
yeah, the right one got that energy
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
NOWA NOWA
Oh, Sakuya!
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227> That's why I don't drink
cute!
https://twitter.com/moiwool/status/1209496881249714176?s=09
Tony Glazer should be the one towering
oh, that's cute, Rany. Look at Diana and Akko!
<@!247701824335904770> great Mordred posts. Especially the one with her sword. Looks badass.
Tsubasa is like: "Okay, stay cool. Stay cool!"
wondering about what?
Braids, even. multiple. Powerful.
oh, that's cute. Look at that hair!
that's today, January 1st
yesterday was the birthday of Yumi from Senran Kagura

season 10
Doki Doki PreCure

indeed
Granblue had a Love Live crossover???
Excuse me?
Ah, okay
maybe you can find it under the tag on pixiv
<@!155150213445582850> if it helps, the character is dressed as Kagerou Imaizumi from Touhou
Also, what's with the smol Maria comics?
That Homura looks great.
Their shipping name ain't **D**m**J**ii for nothing
That he did.
Yang is amazing. I love women who can kick my ass
Yang is still better
It's what I do
Ruby, artwork from that one fighting game
normally, I mean
<@!264451306221993985> I'm pretty sure her hair is supposed to represent an eighth note.
A wide hoody can hide boobs quite well, ninryu. But who knows
okay, those last two are adorable
Homura!
The OVA that came with Estival Versus in Japan.
and uncensored
The OVA is fun, by the way
mood
smol Kana
Nice!
oh, yes, Maria!!

<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I love the type of woman who can kick my ass
I hope
Nice arms!
oh!
slurp
<@!247701824335904770> DiAkko

I am pretty sure there is


<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>


but Maria, though
sound and look reminds of late 80s, early 90s shows
what I love about Maria is how flawed she is. May sound weird, but I like that she falls a lot, but always gets back up.
what is the max amount of people in a Discord group?
I love Maria's character.

Maria is too precious
I don't like her XV sequence because of that weird bondage crap and the focus on her breasts. Just a no from me.

Maria is beautiful, indeed
I don't like her XV transformation, really. Maria's other ones were way better.

meh
leave the channel and reenter, it plays correctly
ah, now it loaded correctly
oof, that's funky


***SHE***

<@!203444794737950720> you can right-klick on the group name and choose "leave group"
sure it is
small but dedicated
she doesn't need to
ah, I see
it sounds consistent
I assume it's so she doesn't upstage the other people in the scene.
I was thinking more of Revy from Black Lagoon, Classy
no chant, she just does it
You know, for some reason, I see Kanade, striking a cool pose and saying "Let's rock." in English before transforming.
oh, that's a good point, wfc. Season 1 hardly had a budget. Imagine the hair animation on her in XV.
Tell me about it
she would
they are right
this is my favorite Maria pic

no weird "cute" vocal tic, no "kawaii" attitude, just a regular person
yeah
I also like that she is an adult. It's refreshing in such a show. makes her more approachable for me, and relatable.
why did I not know that?
have fun
An Abridged series could work of gear. there are a lot of plot holes to poke through. I also want Ver to go "Not dead jk lol"
That's so pretty!
Why isn't Yoko in Persona 5? Half the gear cast is in that game.
I wanna hear her talk about space and robots
I know, and I am jealous!
She just has a beautiful voice
Hikasa. I meant Hikasa
Hikasa
she can talk pure nonsense to me, and I'd eat up every word.
I was busy today as well
they are little kids, after all
exactly
they tried
the gunguni sisters!
And a Ryuko mousepad *somewhere*
from KLK
and a Ryuko poster
The only weeb shit I have is a PreCure wall scroll
cabbage hair
Oh! Nice.
Nope, Risky
The only badass pirate queen for me is Risky Boots
the vid was cute, too
noice
I like how Chris is shown teaching her baby stuff in that stitch. it's cute
Indeed.
Diana and Maria are both gay and european
live-shitposting is for when you want to post large amounts of art and such.
it's art, so it's fine
Why did he become such a badass?

I got some more
you know it
YES

The artist Ticcytx does a lot of DiAkko art
Little Witch Academia
<@!247701824335904770>
Rany has a foot fetish?
This may be the most cursed word you ever wrote.
<@!246146781832806401> I am not sure if you already know this pic.
Maki is, at least for me, daughter material. Cute, cuddly, worthy of every headpat in the world.
Maki is my best girl




She could rip me in half and I'd say thanks.
Oh yes!! And those arms!!

I feel like Fooly from Female Knight a bit
<@!247701824335904770> YES! ABS!
wild hair
Nice!
you know it!



Maria training is why German has the term "bildende Kunst"
That's fine art
Oh, that's a classic!





my name is not just for shits
You're welcome. I have a lot more
lesbian_flip




those maid outfits. Maria's feeling it


<@!247701824335904770>
Beautiful lady
Thanks
something for the TsubaChris fans
I am not sorry.
those empty speech bubbles have meme potential
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
MARIA
Oh, Hong Meiling! Cool!
That is what they say, pretty much
DIANA EVE????? YES PLEASE
thanks <:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I am not a fan of the animal ears, but that's not bad
<@!186660127825330177> Have you seen this edit I made?
Oh, cute!
oh, cool!
I just saw the face and attitude
Chris looks like a tiny angry child
angry child
cool Maria
can't tell if those are ears or a witch hat
Local Kanade has comfy sleep
I liked StrikerS a lot, as well. Nanoha was a fucking beast in it
A's was great
Season 2 is the bomb
<@!246146781832806401> That pic of the four girls with new hairstyles... I did not know Basa looked that fucking awesome with super short hair
<@!246146781832806401> you know about those?
Just wait until AU Basa hears about that.
That is a very good question
Of course.

<@!247701824335904770> For you, sister.
That tiny Chris going Yasai Mosai is cute
this meme is so strange
it's a meme
Look at those shoulders!
Yes! Thank you, sister!
if you got an account, the transfer limit will be extended
I can tell you a thing or two about MEGA, I use it a lot
you need to wait a few hours
oh, yeah, that happens sometimes
same. around that number
what do you mean?
my Firefox, with 20 tabs open, takes 1GB
open the tab, even more ram.
that's a lot.
see how much ram chrome takes when you simply *start* it
for Chrome, already very RAM heavy, and then downloading, preloading?
yeah, that's not a lot.
oh, is it a laptop?
and how much of that ram does your system allocate?
just saying
that's... not recommended
it goes 2, 4, 8, 16.
It's bytes
how?
The crashes seem to point to it. How much RAM does it have?
I am guessing RAM
technically, Chrome is the only browser that can load large files without external app. Firefox and Edge just throw up a warning. Seems like it's your system.
Mega probably crashes your browser because it exceeds the allocated amount of RAM when downloading, as MEGA is loading it all "in browser" before saving to harddrive.
mega has an app, MEGAsync. I use it myself, it's really fucking good.
firefox saves tabs and all without an extension, when you change a value in about:config

indeed
I actually said "aw" out loud
AAWWW!
keeping your hair tied up during sleep is also not good for your hair




Maria as Lady Maria

Aw, that TsubaMari is precious


oh, Love Live!
awwww!!!!
Ikxi, it's
Her hair and eyes remind of Byakuren Hijiri from Touhou.
Makes sense, really.
Chris doesn't dess
oof
https://twitter.com/hak3ri/status/1235853231818854401?s=09





She seems like an absolute lady
I got to know her today, as well. I am in love with her entire character. Her design, how she plays, her background.
He liked her design, I don't think he knew her before today. I just found another great pic I wanted to show him
<@!246146781832806401>
I don't like it, no, ma'am.
I hate penguins now
<@246146781832806401> Sorry I answer so late. It's Katalina from Granblue Fantasy.

handholding

<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326> "I have to tell Kiri about that."
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592> "... and that's why you should put a towel under you when you try it for the first time."
Basa's face.
The thing is, I could see Monika doing that, self-aware as she is.
I'm sorry to hear that, spidder
<@234130653346660353> is that Monika doing the ***default dance???***

Sorry, didn't see it. I posted it on multiple channels
Yeah.
Are they playing folk metal?
Thank you! I will consider it, then. Just need a plot.
<@!247701824335904770> maybe I should write a LWA DiaAkko fic sometime.
How Diana tella Akko to be careful. Very caring.
I like this pic a lot
Elfnein's trademark food is shrimp now?
no, during
She is a lesbian disaster, pretty much, in v7
oh yes
it's vol 6, I believe


no, you are not.
obligatory best girl posting because RWBY talk
I saw their name in the credits of the first episode. I was like "wait a minute..."
Did you know? Mojojoj was responsible for the designs of team RWBY for RWBY Chibi.
RWBY!
Oh, yes. Ticcy is a goldmine of DiAkko!
One can only hope
There is the scene I was talking about.



Same va in japanese
also



NO ONE TOUCHES THE HAIR
of course not.
oh, Kanaduck!

pretty much
Also, nice to see that Nora picked up on the development between Blake and Yang
There is this one scene in V7 where Yang makes a joke, Blake laughs, and Weiss throws them a look that speaks volumes.
There they are!

But my fav will always be the blonde brawler
Qrow is legit.
I thought the meme line was him yelling "What does she even see in you??"
Ryuko!

Part 3 is in the works, but only has one chapter so far
part 2
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13122014/1/This-Side-of-Paradise
this is part 1
Okay, so, the story I meant is part of a multi-part series.
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13101655/1/The-Magic-We-Share
let me look it up
it's rather sad, though
There is an amazing fic including Diana and Akko riding in a few scenes.
Indeed
DiAkko is good stuff
This picture was drawn by one of the people working on the show
They are basically official now
They are cuddling.


<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>



Sorry, Shirabe







Anytime, fellow DiAkko shipper
also <@!247701824335904770>
<@!84811738653929472> https://ticcytx.tumblr.com/tagged/myart scroll down a bit
actually a seven page comic
<@!247701824335904770>



Hell yes she is



also:
Ryuko!!!
Oh, oh, Akko will be so exhausted after that


and sleep very well afterwards
ban!
why so sad?
you are dead, dead, dead...
damn
Then I don't remember
If I remember, they don't even have names
thanks, shirabe
Forte
<@!247701824335904770> When they talk crap about the wife
I like how complex To Aru is.
Besides, she can take care of herself
nah, don't feel like it.
That face is a mood
Women in suits are on another level

Verschiebe nie auf morgen...
awwww
Flip!
Good!!
EXCUSE ME? TSUBAMARI WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE???
Siege dressed as Mordred
That's what Rany said
while I am not a fan of animal traits in characters, like the ears, I love the mordred look
who will be Ryuko?
<@!247701824335904770>

Amou the Kanade



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7_pVrIshxA
fan art of this one great video




gladly
sorry, I had a moment
why the fuck would you punch her?? Love her, support her, get *handled* by her.

So far, I am pretty much indifferent about Kasumi. But I only played 7 hours so far
Basa probably drank the bath water or something


<@!247701824335904770> I do indeed. I got a soft spot for tomboys
really? Why not?
<:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>




SHE'S ABOUT TO DO IT!!

<@!247701824335904770>
I want pizza now



<@!247701824335904770> Diana looking down at the Akko x Andrew shippers.



oh, don't worry about it. It's just a pet peeve
It's honestly one of the few things I absolutely don't like. Next to one dimensional tsundere characters and "gag boobs"
honestly, I think MHA is boring and generic. and I cannot stand animal features like ears and such on characters.

<@!247701824335904770> Nah, check out One Punch Man
look at them!
awwwww!


Oh, that Peach is great!
she's the mail woman, huh?
that's a lot of thought put into some pictures, I must admit
what is going on there?
oh, SK
cute! My cat did that sometimes!
MATOI RYUKO!!
coincidentally, we just had a lemon talk on another server
oh, that's where it's from? cool
<@!247701824335904770> now I have. Nice
look, she has to go on her tips to hug her!


<@!247701824335904770>
<:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
we all know Miku is the dom. Hibiki's attempts are fruitless
"Hug me, nerd!"


why did you remind me that thing exists?

<@!247701824335904770>

oh, yeah, I remember that pic. it's great
yeah, that's a great one!
reliving memories
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
Maria Tsukino
aww, cute
got ya, sorry.
you are the tech wizard, not me
with a lot of love, I'd reckon
by the way, those hearts look nice
there are ten there
That's because human eyes can't see ultraviolet and infrared.
I thought it was more gay^10

gay³
gay x2500
Diana is 100% the kind of woman who loves Akko teasing her deep down, because she knows that if she wants to, she will turn it around on her full force
I know, right?
sequel to this
<@!247701824335904770>
well, computer chips are made from sand
oh, suits. nice!
Cute Marias! Thanks!
I prefer Yumi regular
you say that, but people thought differently
This one
that reminds me of that Yumi art that had the entire Senran Kagura Facebook group go into a rant about
Aww, cute
There is our answer
so, who knows if she got the screen real estate for that
It's also 6840x4840
I'm not forcing her to use it.
<@!247701824335904770> have a wallpaper
very pretty
agreed
casual clothes are great
you'd be surprised. Just share art you think other people would like
Nice! Thanks, Rany
aww. poor maria
cute!
a little bit of teasing is the spice in a good relationship
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Artist is airisubaka

hm, I'm starting to see your point


sorry, but when we're talking chestwraps...
my fav love live character is Maki. She is adorbs
Love Live
Kotori, Honoka and Umi
yep
boy, I feel ya
I could see Umi kicking ass

In the meantime, have a Revy
I'll post it when I find it. I have it, I know that
I don't have a basa folder
Usually, pics like that always end up in my Maria folder
I know for a fact that I have it, though
oddly, it doesn't seem to be in my Maria folder
I have it, let me look

nah, Meiling can gladly punch my lights out
indeed




I was aware, Kerrik, don't worry
sure, I'll keep that in mind
okay
Really?



I didn't know there was a manga
oh, that must suck


still have a few

I just really like Uni
Yeah, I played her almost exclusively in 4GO
Uni is absolutely best sister.
YES
When artists have the dedication and resources, they can create amazing stuff
I don't know. I just liked the pic
Uni is about to shoot ya.
"Anyway, here is Eruption by Van Halen"
I don't really like her either, but that's mostly because I don't like the animal ears. I don't know how she is in the show.


^ this
I constantly go "aww" when I see a new Maki pic

if I remember correctly
was a crossover back then. There should be artwork for all the original love lives out there


still works

oh oh, busted chatting with the gf


aww
she is just totally cute
smol Yumi
oh, yeah, you're right
the characters are legit good, by the way. lots of interesting backstories and all
if you want to read up on Yumi (and the many other characters)
https://senrankagura.fandom.com/wiki/Yumi
they are indeed
because the series is really fanservice heavy
The thing is, most of Senran Kagura's artwork I need to post in <#336297808221044736>


she has a larger one on her back which she uses when going crimson.
three in each hand
well, she fights with six swords
here is more Homura
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
from left to right
Homura, Yumi and Miyabi
something like that
I believe that was promo art for the second Senran Kagura season


she is just too precious
that railgun pic up there, the first thing that came to my mind was the monty python and the holy grail scene. I imagine Kuroko singing:
"Bravely bold onee-sama, rode forth from Camelot..."
very nice
"Look, I am you!"
yeah, which is why I said there should be a story or something to add more to the two then "both dead"
no, but we could add more to it
give them some actual reason to hook up
hm, that could be a nice idea for a fic, though. but one with a lot more characterization and stuff. some slow burn.
There is no Maki.
cute love lives!
<:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>

yes, the most perfect smile

nom
just surprised me
I honestly don't see it
what?



Thanks! So adorable!

he knows the floof
that 80s Yang is by the same guy who does Space Maria
oh, happy birthday!

same
yep, it's a reference to the transformation sequence of Panty and Stocking


"stupid lady stilts"


That's canon
hell yes
it looks like she is some space goddess
I said the same thing, sister. Great minds think alike
I love that purple star effect
same, wfc
playing with a stick does not always mean success.
so? I never said she'd succeed
the right way to play a fighting game

no, don't think so, but it doesn't scan twitter, so maybe it's from there
that's pretty
please do not abuse gears
nice!

<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> "I am way too gay"
Edelgard is my absolute favorite

however:
Bernie posting
<@!246146781832806401> you might like her too
She also already has fanart
I just wanted to share <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
tired Nagatoro

Yo!! Nagatoro's big sister!
oh, that looks cool
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Basa & Kanade with Hibiki
well, mkv is a container, it could be anything in there, right?
<@!237964037898502144>
About a woman, Lola, and her lover, Tony, working at the Copacabana, a bar. One day, Rico, a mobster comes in, sees Lola, molests her, and Tony fights him. Tony gets shot, Lola lost her love, and drinks herself half blind over the years.
Kiri would listen to Copacabana by Barry Manilow and think it's a fun song, because she doesn't understand the lyrics
Kanade listening to Bitches Ain't Shit
For me it seems like she's thinking: "Keep it together, now is not the time for that."
of course
~~that "sandwich" was also posted not three hours ago~~
I honestly get massive Sailor Moon vibes from it
cute style
well, seems like you got a lot to enjoy right now
<@!102691114762371072> I absolutely agree. best of both worlds.
cute Weiss!

something always distracts me
With music it's the worst. I want to do more, but I just can't.
yeah, same. Happens with everything I do.
I have adhd, which is why I asked. It was really relatable
adhd?
tztz
Yang is confused or puzzled, by the way
I know. That's what I meant. both are moods depending on the situation.
Just like Yang's face here
It's a mood

yes!!
thank you!
Look at that smol Maria!!!
let it go, let it go!
Don't judge!
that's acceptable
do not catch! make friends and pet
Yes!
The first season was even aired on German television
shame
the tenth season of Precure was Doki Doki Precure
you are an uncultured swine
I love Doki Doki Precure so much

nice!
Regina is my favorite character, too.
> Didn't expect to find any other PreCure fans here. Glad you enjoyed Doki Doki as well!
<@!262326868366065664> It's honestly my favorite season. Strong contenders are Futari Wa, Suite and Smile.
nah, that ain't it, chief
goofy, maybe, that I can see. But dense? no.
nah, don't sell yourself short.
sure, she sometimes if a bit overzealous, and tends to forget stuff around her when she has her head in her work, but she is *clever*.
I like them smart, honestly. Which is another thing I like about Lara Croft, especially the reboot one: She is fucking smart. And how she sometimes gushes over artifacts is just adorable.
YES
yeah
yep. I like that tomboy active look a lot.

oh, absolutely!!!
one of the reasons I like Samus Aran and Lara Croft so much? (besides them being kickass badasses?)
Ponytails!
her hair ornament
I like ponytails a lot, and her having an unique one adds a lot
Like the hair
hit you with a follow on twitter, by the way
oh, I know the artist!
weird
<@!237964037898502144> it's literally outside
Oh, hell yes. Black Lagoon is the only anime I own on BluRay


Yeah, absolutely.
not saying she was bad, just not my thing
I found Velvet a very bland character. well, maybe not bland, but uninteresting. She just didn't do it for me
cheers!
Ah, yeah, the main from that one tales game. Honestly, with this I have to disagree.
she likes to tease
<:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>
yes!
oh, we will
if everything works out next year, we should discuss what I should cook
nice!!
because I could make a big dinner when you visit
do you have a big appetite?
sounds great
I like women with healthy appetites
That's a nice ponytail, seriously. very long
tinkerbell, because why not?

pineapple!!
YES! That would be great!
Yes!
I was a weird child
I did the same with cheese back then.
yum
okay
some fruit gums
for a little child
well, seems like I should buy some snacks then, when we meet.
cute
stupid English and its multiple words.
tripping is clumsy, not dense. but when we see each other, I'll be the judge of that. <:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>
remember, the really dense people would never say they are dense, because they don't know they are dense.
Both German. Mine was a northern German dialect
Appelköök!
CHEEEEEEN
The only person I can ever think of when I read Chen is the touhou character


I honestly don't remember the music from the first series
they couldn't really do that with the TV show.
Ultimate is the OVA, a direct adaptation of the manga
The OVA, yes. The anime TV show not so much
I wanna get the Hellsing Ultimate BluRays too sometime
Revy is amazing

Low German
Plattdeutsch
Great!!
or a bowl of rice

ENHANCE!
they are so gay. We need a new season with actual yuri
<@!247701824335904770> <@!400844698140409856> Higher resolution.
oh, I have a higher res version somewhere
The user Bloop on Nickireda's (<@!142136901602770944>) server made this, and I just had to share it:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678868505596264461/710932750005436466/BEARHEFUTURE.gif
very polite
Chris is about to knock a girl out
<@!247701824335904770> maybe Maria wanted her to find out
oh, and in no way am I saying it is easy. But it's something you will have to overcome sooner or later.
that's a personal issue, one only you alone can work on. If you let yourself be open again and just let stuff happen, you will go into a new relationship even stronger and with experience.
oh, I missed the "the" in your message, Rybo. Yes, finding *the one* is hard, but only because it takes endurance. There is no magic formula, you just have to keep trying
I have to disagree. just be open with people.
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
Oh, oh! I do! I do!!!!
I'd play that in a heartbeat!
I thought that Terraria fanart was Amalia from Wakfu at first.

Man, you really like that wolf girl, don't ya?
looks great!
very good
There will be no alert. Nice try, though
Ikxi, pings edited in do not work
Why was I not informed about that post?
That's some sitcom material
Oh, I knew I remembered her design from somewhere.
oh, Rany, new pfp?
Oh, wow, that's cool!
She looks so fucking sick of everyone's shit
Time for sleep, as well
Cute!
what is her outfit a reference to, by the way?
oh, that's cool!
Now, this is a crossover that was just waiting to happen.
Yes! Smoochy!
Üüf
oh, that's a pretty pic
so most likely cancelled, yes
on hiatus since 2013
Remember when Hayate was called into action in StrikerS and they had to *evacuate* the entire area?
that scene was something
Hayate must be an amazing cook, considering she cooks for four other people.




hm, who is that for?
and Shirabe so busty
yeah, looks like it
OYOYO
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Thank you!
<@!279341087494242304> I am seriously beating myself up. How the fuck could I forget about Signum?
and then just *kicks the everloving shit* out of the noise.
love is a beautiful thing
cute!
sorry, Rany. Didn't mean to make you mad <:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
I honestly don't know, I am just teasing you
oh, really? likely story <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
> also damn that basa ass
<@247701824335904770> Rany, please. Maria is being awesome and you only have eyes for her wife's badonkadonk?
Maria being a cool hero is something we need more of.

CHINA
Yes!!
<@!95698695701397504> "Chris is hurt"
Plot twist: It's not her blood.
Wow
wait, what?
MOM
nice!
yes!!


Maria in shades is the best


casual clothes Maria is great
very cute! already saw on twitter
Yo, that Nagisa and Honoka pic is great
oh, cool!
beautiful. enjoying ice cream in this hot weather
Indeed
süß!!!
Ryuko was posted and I was not informed?

This ship has a ton of fanfic potential
I saw some Chris x Cags showing up suddenly. I like that. A lot.
That Chris with child is cute
Oh, vibes!
cool
sure
yeah
um, I mean
~~(guess that date is ruined)~~
okay, I guess
well
oh
Well, we can make it together, how does that sound?
Basa is not bad at cleaning, she just never does it
Hey, don't sell yourself short, Rany.
I bet it will be delicious
Rany, can you make apple pie?
same
oh, okay. aw. I thought there was apple pie
wait, apple pie??


Vivio!

As a kid I had a massive crush on Makoto/Sailor Jupiter. I guess this is where my love of tomboys comes from.

Beautiful


<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
very lovely indeed
Okayu!! And Maria!!!!
my heart!!!
nice!
Beautiful
DiaAkko posts!!!
AWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this
Chris, you ass
They look adorable
<@263534352422404096> oh, do I ever!
I thought she was a pen for a second

there she is
smooch!!
Oh, I saw on twitter! So good!


Chris x Spaghett
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTV4JsET6OY
~~reminds me of Fubuki going crazy about american burgers~~
she just has a very big burger
the borgar image is cute
oh, I know what you mean
Suit!!

thanks
<@!237964037898502144> you know I love me some buff girls
BABYBABYBABYBABYBABYBABY
Thank you, Gwen
<@!247701824335904770>
also
Cute!!
Nanoha is a mech
smol
nya!
ART!
smooch!!!

aw! thinkin of wife
That's cute!!
that's canon, and you can't tell me otherwise
Cags is great
dbza reference
as picollo said: I suggest a 45° angle
angel

oh, yeah, that's some really good stuff
we have Maria speed
yep
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
She's feeling it
"Wait, Basa is cute?"
"Always has been."
where is the movie/series for it??
Best crossover of all time
very good
not a big accomplishment, really.






possible. I don't honestly remember
why was I pinged for that?

also, that Caroline and Justine cosplay is great
"Alchemists all over the shop. You'll be one of them, sooner or later..."
the "Bloodborne dude"
Oh oh
IM Hibiki's design is really cool, yeah
by that logic, every crossover with gear added would be only Chris
missed opportunity
if that's the case, why isn't Hibiki in Hibiki's gear?
oh, idolmaster?
what is this crossover?
NicoMaki!
wanna pet!!!!


jii_skip
jii_skip
jii_skip


god, that's cute!
so cute! I really like the artstyle
I stopped after a few strips
IMO
Komi-san overstayed its welcome, I must say. It's basically the same thing on repeat, with the only gag being "she can't communicate". Was novel at first, but got tiresome really fast.
<@!445783190976856065> Same vibe
DiaAkko is the good shit







Pretty much



wow!
NozoEli!



she is strolling

Yang just uses the glove to punch people





MARIA!
I never watched Sunshine

Good radar

She probably goes "nya" a lot
Already seen and saved
I appreciate it nonetheless
not a fan of the teeth, but nice muscles
and never dies of old age
what I know about it is the "it's joke" meme
that looks awesome!
yes
but it's still the 6th
beautiful
Oh!!!! Nice combo!!
yes
there just something about the syncopation of the first that clicks with me
also really good. doesn't move me as much as the first one though
I absolutely love the guitars adding a gritty something to this bouncy tune
Fuck, that's good
No, doesn't ring a bell
Cutie Panther is a legit banger
I want that
So cute!!!!
seen it on twitter already <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
The style of the Hibiki/Germain/Carol pic reminds me of that old Heidi anime
Yes!!!!!

<@!237964037898502144> If you post more Revy, could you ping me?
YO! Revy was posted and I was not informed????
perfect
fucking badass, love her

also, on the talk of Shantae and River City Girls:
Peach is my second favorite Nintendo character, right after Samus. Love them
Hell yes. Great game

I know what you mean, don't worry. I was just saying that I never felt that from games
haha, overactive imagination of a child
I mean, I played Silent Hill 1 when I was 13, and loved it
not me. I don't think any video game ever did that. But SA-X was a nice opponent

I also really liked Fusion. A lot

oh, yeah, Zero Mission is awesome
hell yes
yeah, they take a while. but the bonus stuff is worth it
nice. I played all main line Metroid games. my favorite Nintendo series
haven't played or seen any of it, to not spoil myself
I ordered Seven Sirens from Limited Run, still have to wait a bit
I still need to finish Metroid: Samus Returns for 3DS
hell yes
was fun
I once did a Let's Play of Pirate's Curse a few years back, out of boredom
Shantae also has Metroidvania in it
But be careful with Shantae 1. As WayForward themselves said: "Abuse those savestates, it's a tough one."
they are really fun
but they didn't fit, because, as Shantae said, they are "too roomy"
and Shantae tries out Risky's clothes
I mean, there is quite some jokes and such between them, and Risky seems to be flirty/teasing when talking to her, especially in Pirate's Curse
legit, where is the Risky x Shantae, WayForward???
Risky is my favorite character from Shantae. She is awesome

Yes!
that's a cute drawing
She probably created her own after the other brands didn't work for her anymore
Very good
God, I love Kill La Kill. Have a Ryuko poster on my wall
YES
Maria in gear at the top looks really cool
hell yes

that little Chris with Hibiki is adorable!!
Maidria
nice!

a phoenix, chutulu and a grim reaper
apparently, source is https://twitter.com/wooperfuri/
fanart of the new english hololive members

But... KotoUmi...
or watch this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQk1_4ctCy4
look up the translation of Garazu No Hanazono, Ikxi
*muffled Garasu No Hanazono plays in the distance*



it's a part of a two page comic. a second

she has a Stand now
well, I have another

oh, ikxi is a Nozomi person?

basically her catch phrase

charmer
Maki is hella adorbs
Maki
Eli
<:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>
eyes jitter, huh?
wow
same
Krank = sick. Kranker = the sick person. Wagen = car.
It's ambulance
Transfusion, schnell!

want me to give Rany a heart attack?
get it?
Umi is flat as the ocean
Nico as Chris is a good fit
MAKI AS MARIA
YES
WHAT???
she is cute
I know, I was joking, don't worry
nice
Kasumi? from DOA?
NICO NICO NII, MOTHERFUCKER!
I love their dynamic
NicoMaki is the best shit
ngl, not a bad look
Eli after the marriage to Nozomi?
at least with the ice cream I eat
they don't do substitutes, they just remove the lactose from it
but at least I can eat it without shitting blood, so...
It tastes no different
I have to eat lactose free icecream
there is
bad for those with lactose intolerance?
Samus!!! That artstyle looks great!
oh, nice!
That Doki Doki PreCure scene. oh god, my heart
YES!
always

The arc that pic is from is dark as hell, though
hell yes
God, I love that show
"I SAID KNEEL!!"
Fine as Balalaika!!!
Oh, God, YES!
she is very fun to watch
SHAAAAAAAARK
DiaAkko!!!!
Very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRYzW77m8To
We? Kiara is doing it herself
hic

yes!
casual cap Chris looks cool

I'm looking forward to the new volume


> and im surprise you guys like rwby.
<@!740195087895756820> I really like it. It's not perfect, but damn, is it entertaining.
BumbleBY for me all day.
YES
yes
Good stuff
https://twitter.com/ArkFordArt/status/1314956469750493184
Aloe. Never forget.
Perfect
<:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>
In my opinion it is
amen to that
left Hibiki, right Kanade
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336297674707828747/766745575365804062/83302752_p8.jpg
The two main girls from Suite Precure. ||Well, the first two main girls ||
especially Hibiki and Kanade
I liked it a lot. Fun characters
I do indeed. It was one of my favorite seasons
And Suite PreCure at that??
PRECURE????
she always is
boop
YES!
Oh, nice!! Thanks for the ping



Kiara is so gay for Calli (and in general) I love it

again, no
no
yes
she is the queen of my heart
I see Maria and Kiara. Nice

awww!

yes, all of it!
nawwwww! Look at smol dragon Maria on the right
Oh, always good!
Nice Marias!!
One of my favorite anime characters
YES
nice!

<@!504069701911969803>
be sure to not remove the file extension

I love that Maria pic. It's a classic
Nice!
also, the alchemists were great characters.
get it?
XV
The show ended with AXZ for me, honestly. I was so disappointed in the laughing bird season
I never finished the final season because of the pointless and annoying amount of fanservice.
Ah, must have blocked that out then
is that from the final season?
which is why I remember that
funnily enough, I know that because that difference of 6 cm was once reference in a fanfic I wrote
Maria has the biggest bust, actually. She is also the tallest, which is why it's not that noticeable
and Hibiki's dialogue was said by Ruby
yep
that "in my lungs" joke is actually from a RWBY comic
True, I don't <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
That's a cute look

her favorite animal!
Maria and the taller Maria
My second favorite after Yang
I love Cinder

seen it!
it's still english she is speaking
when did I do that?
I find english dialects fascinating
The welsh dialect almost made me try the game
That's a cool Maria!!!
indeed
<:MariaSmile:688836869550768233>
!!!!
indeed
I saw Ryuko!!! Good stuff!
ADORBS!!
YESSSSS


Peach is cute

true
uuuhh!
Sounds good, I'll check it out
<@457268466429329429> I should have the pic saved. When I'm home I'll check
Interesting. If it's not fan service stuff, I'll check it out
also <@!247701824335904770>
<@!457268466429329429> here is the pic I mentioned yesterday
MariKnight

Nice
aw
TsubaMari never lost its power on me
That's a good song
I knew there was a reason I don't like dogs
WHAT???
I love TsubaMari

Yes!

cool!
Oh, I see NozoEli. Very good!
Cute DiaAkko
Hellsing Ultimate

(by the way, in a fanfic I am writing Atlas is very based on Germany, with German even being its official language)
*shameless plug end here*
I mean, I don't even regard the name German, really, just it's own thing.
yeah, basically
Monty even said, in regards to Weiss' name being mispronounced and Yang's name being backwards, that there are no German and Chinese in Remnant. If so, why do they have those names?
has nothing to do with culture stuff.
Yang is goldylocks, Ruby is red riding hood. Cinder is cinderella, and so on
<@!400844698140409856> nah, not true. Monty said he did it because of the Snow White references, a German fairy tale. Snow White turned around, white snow, translated to german is Weiß Schnee. Every character has fairy tale roots.

Even if the names sound absolutely goofy in German, and are even mispronounced. As long as it sounds foreign, right?
why did you have to give them German words for names, Monty?
man, it's so weird looking up some nice fanart of RWBY on google for Winter, when her full name just gives me results of some German news if it's going to snow this winter or not.
Those two emote names stood out to me
couple goals
oh, good to know

the anime is hit or miss for many people
Senran Kagura is a videogame series first and foremost, though
holy shit, that looks cool!
Look at them!
Shantae x Risky is the best


Rhea? Oh no!
oh, she is. I just like Peach.
is there casual Peach?
the artist is Zawawa, who deleted their pixiv and twitter
That Takamori pic reminds me of this:
Kawakami!!
Ahoy!
TsubaMari is the best. it gives me life
oh, I love that design and coloring.
yes!!
Oh, god, the relics are almost touching!! way too lewd!
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585> oh my god yes
wait what?
shrimp daughter
hm
well, okay, aura
yes, part of her father's
I know, but still, it happened to her
and has a soul. she basically died
and was ripped apart before that
couldn't be any worse than what happened with her canonically.
I mean, it's not Shem ha kissing Hibiki, right? It's like a mother being excited for her daughter's first date or something
because funny
<@!237964037898502144>
At least it's not a spider...

It's really good, a very cute style
good
based on what?
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
That looks really good
OH FUCK YES
Her english is so adorable
I love Haachama

So lovely




NicoMaki is literally the best

okay. that's good
oh, that sucks. I'm sorry
why not? If you want to talk about it
I was never concert level good. I use it to record and compose degitally
but not type, it seems
Oh, nice! I can play too
indeed it is, Nova, and indeed she is, Dino.

I love her design

Nanoha and Fate both have one

Dislexia, play Despastioto
as its searches are limited to a finite amount each day, using it when it isn't needed means potentially uncredited pics will not have a source linked
it skips Yggdrasil's image search
TsubaMari is best ship, and if you disagree YOU GOT A DIFFERENT TASTE AND THAT'S TOTALLY FINE!


yes, it does


no, I stay far away from any Maria lewds
keep your innocence
the eldrich horror
Legit, mature Chris looks really good
"Your daughter calls me mommy too"
Did you know? Katsuragi from Senran Kagura was originally supposed to be the main character, but her design turned out to be too similar to Sonsaku, so Asuka was chosen instead


NanoFate is great
I think I just cringed so hard I pulled a muscle
so many spikes

American is actually the morphed and corrupted version
it's their language
actually, no
The UK was European. They speak English
I wrote that like that on purpose, just saying
we need #headcannon
and she has to do it
and only Zelda is left
no, kidnapping is an old head. let Link be dead.
yeah, but as a main Zelda title, with dungeons and puzzles and shit
Nah, have Zelda just straight up fight Ganon and his army. No saving anyone, just straight up asskicking
yeah, for example
Yeah, I noticed. The games where you can actually play as Zelda besides her being a sidekick are not made by Nintendo
A Zelda taking no shit from nobody and just being a total badass fighter would be cool
missed opportunity
I am not sorry
3_skip
Why can't Metroid crawl?
that would be my favorite Zelda if that happened.
Imagine Ganon reappearing, and before he can even do his usual shit, Zelda just claps him
This time, she won't hesitate, Ganon.

Prime is amazing

Guys! That's it! Samus with gun!
Why are there so many pics of Zelda with a gun?

I am German, I like to ruin jokes by being pedantic
and cybersonic shared that tweet before that
yes, I just shared that
here is the interview Lexi mentioned
https://twitter.com/SonicJPNews/status/929726114943111168
works fine for me
<@!623294686404149269> here it is, from Vinny Vinesauce's stream. Should start at 1:38:57

I am not joking, that's actual dialogue
actual dialogue
Oh, Rayearth. Originally a video game series. The first game for Sega had a hilarious en dub:
"It's time for a little child abuse."
and Harley Quinn is legit great, too. my favorite show 2020
like, hella
very gay
I mean the new She-Ra series. It's on Netflix. Very good shit
have you seen She-Ra or the new Harley Quinn?
I got She-Ra recommended, and Harley Quinn I saw some clips on youtube and liked them a lot
true
over saturation
though I can understand where you're coming from
isn't that more an issue with the people on the site, and not the shows themselves?
indeed
anytime
I know, was just saying
american TV stations are not something I am familiar with
no idea.
but:
https://watchfreenet.org/series/harley-quinn/
only on HBO Max and DC's streaming service, if that's still around
It's called Harley Quinn
but they had to sell it somehow
yeah
All the characters in Harley Quinn are great. Joker was always entertaining when he was on screen
<@!722121666641133608> Wikipedia explains the plot of She-Ra better than I could
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Ra_and_the_Princesses_of_Power
it's amazing
I've seen the first two seasons
and the harley quinn cartoon is not for kids, let me tell you
yep
oh, no, I was talking about the cartoon show, on DC, now on HBO Max, nin
It's Hibiki, she is always about to punch
and is about to punch someone

she replaces her bodies, right?
Strand: to wash ashore, a string.
In German: Strand means beach, which is also a story element in Death Stranding
also, that line was probably accidentally very on brand. Everything in Death Stranding is about connections
Rice Eating

Fucking Kiri as Lou
nice!
YES
Wife and wife!
solid choice
well, have you seen Hellsing Ultimate? That's what the pic eludes to. Her outfit references Alucard
Nice!
or short hair
I am more a ponytail fan myself
Sloog has a great drawing style
Kawakami and Shantae? Good day
yeah, because there are no games that are Japan exclusive or something.
another
Maria as Lady Maria from Bloodborne
BotW Zelda was also pretty good.
I like how she is in this game a lot
Not looks, character.

Sailor Moon!
It's all media, not just cartoons
Doesn't matter
aw
it's so media cannot sexualize minors by going: no, no, they are actually 400
fun fact, in Germany we have a law for media to stop this train of thought.
I doubt Nintendo will ignore the millions of sold Switch
you are hopefully aware that none of that is confirmed. No one even knows if the Pro is even a thing and not just a different build that doesn't use a specific chip any more
Switch Pro? I am not getting another Switch
I need a new Metroid for Switch
Samus! Hell yes
CarolJa
so, every character in a show is a fictional character.
every media is fiction, unless it's a documentary
seems this is a cultural difference thing here
nudity is just nudity. we are all born naked
and that's weird
if you think nudity is sexualized, then yeah, I can understand how you think that.
nudity is not sexualized, and never was
you apparently don't understand what "sexualized" means. I am not talking nudity or stuff like that. I mean sex and shit.
so, here should be fine, yeah

well, I've seen her post her artwork here for quite some time now, I am probably longer on this server than a lot of people here.

oh yes, very nice

well, she killed Ridley dead.
I played all main Metroid games
oh, yeah, Fusion. Great game
she chillin

In the Prime series, which is set before Super Metroid, you can read messages by the space pirates being scared shitless because Samus appeared
the fact that Ridley killed her parents is the reason Samus viciously hunts Ridley and the space pirates down to the point of complete extinction in Super Metroid
no worries, I had to read that sentence two times as well to make sure it was correct before sending
english hard?
she was 5 years old, when she was found, I believe
yeah. she was picked up by the Chozo, an intelligent bird like race, as the only survivor of space colony 6 when Ridley attacked with his pirates. The Power Suit is Chozo invention, and only works with their DNA.

Death Stranding is weird like that
Maria is being a BT, the souls of the dead. when they move, they leave hand prints, so she is doing a handstand to leave them.
oh, I just saw the Death Stranding art. That's cool!
thank you, but I don't like that weird "cat girl in bikini" art.

I prefer short hair. not only on Ryuko, but in general. But it looks fascinating
Ryuko with long hair? interesting
And I was not pinged for Maria. Sad.

the indentations on the top of her shield are for her to be able to use a spear or blade to attack while taking cover behind it.
oh yeah, the boss whooped my ass. I almost had it, but at the end it went crazy
In German those shields are called Tartschen, this is a so called Setztartsche. They are made out of wood so arrows and blades get stuck in them. <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
she is my favorite character so far, from my half hour of demo play, in terms of fighting style

I'll get it on sale, probably
oh, what a coincidence, I tried the demo today. was fun
that's a cool design
Aw, Maria is so adorable

don't know which type. maybe the confident, strong type?

the true power couple


Hibiki just transports rice all the time


Nanoha is also not really the focus of StrikerS. There is a good reason why she takes a backseat and only steps into action when shit hits the fan. Because the season would have been over after three episodes otherwise

But Superman is boring. That's my point. It would just be an endless loop, like DBZ
She is fucking insanely powerful, I guess that's more the reason. How can you write an engaging story if the main character is the Ace of Aces?
I want more adult Nanoha fights
we need a new season
It makes sense in the story, though.
Yeah, Nanoha is a bit out there

That last one was my avatar for a while
okay, that's cute

absolutely
those two are so precious together. such great chemistry
those are good things to become your things
absolutely
Same. I read every released chapter in a few hours. Didn't even know the comic existed until yesterday.
I know, but a JRPG tends to have a lot of nongameplay in the first few hours, anyway
I try to avoid it, honestly. Pirated games often don't get patches and stuff. and it's not like I can't afford it, and I played the demo. I just didn't really like other Tales games I played.
I see Samus. Good shit. Also, goddamn, I kinda wanna play Tales Of Arise, everytime I see fanart. but 60 bucks??
yeah, absolutely
I can see it working really well.
okay, that is a good ship I did not consider yet
yes
I know Mumei has her moments, and the creepy face she drew in passpartout is an emote now. but this??
I meant the comic
okay, what?
in anime, I mean
yes
also, cultural differences. In Japan that's funny, in the west it's no no
well, she is a fun character, ignoring her touchy feely side
maybe because of her... physique?
The item she got is from PreCure, by the way
understandable. I didn't like that aspect of her either, she was way better when she was just a friend

also:
amen
I do too. Oh, boy, do I ever


aw



May sounds silly, but I watched the show as a kid, and Makoto was legit the first character crush I can remember. I guess I always liked tomboys
I love Sailor Moon. Makoto is my favorite

They always do
Samus!
sure they exist, but they are disregarded by the government and the people. there are no laws supporting them. you were born male? you go into the regular cart
but I guess if we kept going it goes into serious discussion
that's still ingrained in their culture
Trans people are considered a joke, something to make fun of
Japan doesn't do that
what do you mean?
the "josei sen’yō sharyō"
also, being groped is legit a huge issue in Japan. Why do you think trains have carts only women have access to?
if you don't want to think of jokes
that's what passes a humor there
that's why you see it so often in them
the style looks like artwork for a whimsical 90s cartoon
YES!
very cute
oh yes, I did
don't think so


the second one has something TVTropes likes to call ceberus syndrome. starts simple but gets rather dramatic later
The first one, finished: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12788812/1/A-Rosy-Evening
(also the first fic I have ever written)
and the second one, in progress: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12797682/1/Three-s-A-Crowd
two, actually. a finished one, and one I am currently writing on, a continuation of the first
strong Ruby is my head canon, honestly. In my fics she also is really strong

I am more a bumbleBY fan, but White Rose is cute too
yes
I have only played the demo, but she is my favorite so far
sure, but still
I kinda hate it that I cannot post a pic of her without people making Ultimate Abridged references. She is one of my favorite characters in anime, and legit awesome in Ultimate, but the gag dub is all people remember

never heard of that
the artwork looks familiar
cute atrwork
very good, in fact


nothing more
I just wanted to clear up what Nevis was talking about mentioning the Cure and that it's a band
I thought you were serious, sorry
I answered this.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure


Sailor Moon walked so PreCure could do a running kick into some bad guy's chest
yeah, PreCure is a juggernaut in Magical Girl shows, and anime in general
every ship is valid. It's PreCure after all
remember, the movie for Doki Doki was the first time PreCure showed blood

yeah, before A La Mode
I've seen the first 13 seasons. after that I just stopped for some reason
Good point
shame, I thought maybe Ygg knew the source

and idols are an extension of music, after all.
I guess we just have our go to theme, it seems
but yeah, music theme is how one would get me
The characters are also very cute, especially Hibiki. Voiced by the same woman who voiced Matoi Ryuko from Kill La Kill, another favorite of mine
Hibiki!! God, I love this season.
very yes

I feel she would rock any look

I feel called out
3_skip

oh, nice
The eyes are a dead giveaway

And I very much enjoy it
I know this, in fact
can't wait for that game to go on sale
oh pretty
The character design in that game is great
Ryuko!
seen it <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
indeed
good observation
oh, very nice!!!
Top Dad
I should check the season out, I think
yeah, her!
I heard the latest LL series has a chinese character, actually voiced by a chinese woman. That character is very popular in China
yes! very good. daughter
I thought that was Pomu for a second
also very badass
my kind of car
the original from which the gif was rotoscoped
I think it is, yeah

oh it gets a second season? so it's basically a new series, not a season then
considering the VA is chinese, she would prevent that
Nice
Idol idle animation
hm, maybe
why is Lotte taking care of her and not her wife Diana?
<@236944855828398080>
The hell are you talking about? Kerrik was the one who toldyou to use the command. And if you cannot use it, don't post
nice
If the phone doesn't allow you to rename extensions, no.
remove the "large" at the end
I think I'll get Splatoon 3 when it comes out
the formula doesn't get stale in Crystal, as it moves rather quickly without tripping over itself, so to speak
as a casual fan, I think it's good
a very good thing, I find.
it is. basically a one to one retelling
depends on if you think cringe is funny. if so, watch the 90s dub
the 90s show was full of fillers, by the way. For example, Makoto was introduced in the 90s anime in episode 25, in Crystal and the manga she shows up in episode **5**
it's basically a retelling of Sailor Moon, following the manga, without any fillers.
Crystal is from 2014
3_skip
I like the style of the old show. Crystal looks closer to the manga
Makoto is always cute
you mean the drawing style?
I don't think I understand
oddly?
have another

thank you for the ping!
KAWAKAMI
absolutely, yeah.
oh, massively. especially the mother. good god
I still remember vividly how people shipped Ryuko and Satsuki, and how abruptly it stopped when the show revealed they are sisters.
Well, mostly stopped.
oh that's very good
or just them kicking major fucking ass, like whenever they are needed. But please! More NanoFate!
a new Nanoha season that actually focused on Nanoha and Fate would be swell.

I can't anymore. emulation would be an option, but the last time I played it on Dolphin it ran like ass in the trilogy
That reminds me of the fact that I only played Prime 2 once
SA-X? or Dark Samus from Prime?
I still need to get that game

FE Three Houses spoilers, just in case. Still cute

Revue Starlight. I had that on my drive
torrent
don't remember deleting it
seems I don't have it downloaded anymore. odd
not yet, no
I still need to watch that show. I have it on my hard drive
she looks petrified, I'd say. as if she can't believe it happened



god, your life must be bland. I pity you. Don't you know what fun is?
you must be fun at parties
of course it is, we never said otherwise
and you lack fantasy to ask yourself what could happen after the show
if you honestly believe that, you have never actually had a trauma or dealt with someone who suffered from some.
you entirely missed the point of the conversation. Never did we say the show shows it, only that she definitely has to deal with it later
also, no, why should we stop? Characters having believable and human traits and events they have to go through makes them interesting
you know people deal with the same stuff differently, right?
oh, she is traumatised, absolutely. the shit she went through leaves marks, no matter who you are
and she has genuine friends now, too
now she has her sister, so maybe she will support her
maybe
yeah, that's how that goes, usually
best character in that show. Not biased or anything
I am surprised how much I like it
the show is very fun
3_skip
I am also slightly near sighted, so this I only noticed after looking closely
I was only passing over it
I know. again, second glance
again, you point out details you only notice at a second glance. it was only at first I thought it
you don't see the teeth in the pic Ikxi replied to
it's not my fault their color schemes are similar!
for a second I thought that was Kronii. Vtubers ruined my life
that is correct
I love tomboys, I have no shame admitting that
fuck no. Tomboy all the way
very cute
yes
yes
women in suits

There was Sammy posting??
interesting
No character in Crystal kept the original VA from the 90s except Usagi (which is also true for the German dub, by the way), which is why I asked. Yeah, I figured it was Crystal. No wonder she sounded familiar.
also a great character
also, Hibiki from Suite Precure should be in there too then, I believe
I read that, yeah. Is that true for the original Sailor Moon anime, or Crystal? I assume Crystal
<@!222517038042710017>thanks for the ping! <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
wow. my favorite characters from all three shows. My birthday came early
Aw, cute!
that's cool!
Sammy!

I have so much Shantae art

oh, yeah, the one made by Trigger. So good
Understandable, she is my second fav. The best scenes are when she and Risky are bantering. There is just something about their dynamic
My favorite is Risky, though, I must say
I love her too. Great character, great games

it's cute, too. She has an adorable dialect
yep.
Maho from D4DJ
best girl
Yes!
big think
hell yes. 100%

Shantae x Risky
that reminds me, I never hung up my Shantae poster

parfait
gay indeed
NozoEli!
Chrisquée
I heard, yeah. I'm not that much of a fan of the anime artstyle, but I can look past it if the gameplay is good
Other than P&M, that is
Okay. I noticed people talking more about part 1 than 2.
So, I noticed that people post a lot of art of Pyra and Mythra, but not many talk about the game they are from. How is it?
also, Kyoko looks so cute here
official art from WayForward
3_skip
I was on phone, and me typing takes ages
yeah, I meant more game 1 and 2 in the series
oh that's rad!
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889> : "... the fuck?"


I need to start

depends on the mood
Banjo then PD or BK2
I would say same, absolutely
When the game came out for X-Box Live Arcade, I played it so much, especially the multiplayer. It's so good.
oh no
Coco and KSon? Nice



some things are built to last
wait, it's ten fucking years old already? Good god
Cute!
considering she is the daughter of a very arrogant and self-centered dickhead, I could see him actually selling merch of the family.
that's awesome!

Oh, right, that was a thing
Question: Why isn't that canon?
White rose!
don't remember  which event it was
remember the crowd's reaction when Ruby was revealed as a guest fighter in BlazBlue?
indeed. could not have said it better myself, Ardania
I'd say the flaws add to the charm. it's honest
it has a charm, in my opinion
but it's very fun
don't expect the greatest show ever.
I enjoy it. It's flawed, but fun
honestly, yeah, kinda
that's her. my favorite character
3_skip
it's a season 3 spoiler, nothing people don't know, but just making sure
Yang Xiao Long, one of the main characters. She got ||her arm cut off||
just like Yang
lost an eye and arm
ah, shit, forgot the command. Sorry!
<@!722121666641133608> that's her. Cinder. After she got majorly messed up
that was my point
Adam was fucking weird, but really?
with a little robot girl? what?
µ's look good in suits too
for now
somebody help her! She's drowning!
lots of potassium
technically, it's Banananananananana
powerful combination
source, because Ygg is out cold:
https://twitter.com/porougon/status/1480988588774813696

at least tastefully
hell, in media in general
it's honestly a very interesting character development. One that is, so far, hardly ever brought up in cartoons, I feel.
that's good.
maybe it's different if you watch the show yourself, all episodes
but then again, like I said, I watched people watch it on youtube
One thing I found very underdeveloped was the development of Snapdragon. I felt the "resolution", so to speak, came a bit out of left field. Not unexpected, but underdeveloped
I was about say
oh, yeah, those two. If they ever do a second season, they should definitely develop that relationship
some art, because channel

from what I saw, Thyme was really fun
oh, yeah, right. Because people were complaining that crunchyroll didn't support "muh japanese animu" with the money, but made their own thing.
odd choice, really. why produce it and then do nothing with it?
and it's not like the creators wanted to change the animation landscape or something.
I guess people just expected the world from it or something. Or the opposite, they wanted it to fail badly, and picked it apart. Sure, the jokes didn't work for me, and some VA work was really dodgy, but like I said, many people involved were amateurs just trying to make a product they put their heart into. Can't really fault that.
I've seen people who honestly enjoy it, and good for them. Let them have their fun.
90% of the internet
I watched people watch it. It's a mess, yes, but not the worst shit ever, not at all. I found it had some really good ideas, just the execution was wonky as hell, and some stuff rather predictable and cliche.
Nanoha is also a cartoon
indeed
good point
Tom & Jerry is anime, too
do you want to say that German cartoons are not actually cartoons but Zeichentrick?
"not a real anime" really? That's just the japanese word for cartoons.

the thing is, the idea behind it is not even that bad, but the execution is fucked beyond believe. most people involved were amateurs, which is fine, but you'd expect SOME quality control in some way
I watched people watch it, if that makes sense. The show was done in 2019 or something, but even crunchyroll was so ashamed of it they stopped all promotion and just silently released it last year
very not good
crunchyroll's own anime
^ this
true

she knows how to use it, too
oh very cool. Signum is a very underappreciated character









nice. yeah, I read her fighting style was inspired by him
cute outfit!
22 in the final
officially
she is 21 in G
also, yes, Maria is another example, but there is no show dedicated to the concept
21 - 22
The adults there are sadly not really in the spotlight, but yes, that's a very good example
I always said, a magical girl show with adult women can work really well. let them be moms, even.
I played the first Atelier Ryza recently. Pretty fun. Especially the alchemy system. Extremely generic anime so far though, which I am not that much of a fan of. But Ryza is cute.
it's an easy way to train fix it
there still is. it helps with posture
Oh hell yes. Thanks for the ping
Chris' face is mood
cute artwork







gains
nice!
The grea-dess game of all time




interesting, really, considering the amount of choices the player has
the one true pairing from that game.





Looking forward to it, the first part was already fun
If I remember correctly, she is playable in River City Girls 2

That's a game screenshot
oh oops. sorry, Ygg

Here's hoping we get a sequel or something
it's an amazing fusion





that's a cool pic. Love the bats
I found it on dynasty scans. Love Live, Eli and Nozomi.


how does that even work? aren't they like two halves or something?

Momozono Love, Cure Peach. From season six, Fresh PreCure.
Interesting. I don't actually ship all that much in PreCure, so all is fine by me
and they are all the leaders of their groups.

quick! spit in it!
she looks like she is two seconds away from resetting the world
to both of you
sorry!!!
it's the wives


extroverts. yikes
yeah, honestly, that's true. I'd say watch the show if you want, and stay away from the fanbase.
There was RWBY posting. White Rose and some BumbleBY. Very good

Her indeed


the wife
yes!

Japan is fucked with their copyright shit, and YouTube is automated.
but we'll see
the youtube page said something different
it's not cancelled, the creator just has a lot of life stuff to go through.
oh yes, I love that image series
very yes
oh yes
yo, Shionne! Best girl!
cute!
so cute!
wait a minute.
little bit of down time. Me time.
I like the gap moe.
Yes, she is a bounty hunter who kills for a living, eradicated the metroids (except one), fucked up the space pirates who killed her parents...
But now, she makes candy.
Beautiful
Pretty okay
yeah, yikes. I really did not like her transformation sequence in the final season
hm, pretty okay. prefer her regular outfits, not that maid fetishizing stuff
aw, Ryuko is so cute!
oh cool


Hayate with the Wolkenritter enjoying a round of ice skating would be cute
you're posting Samus and don't ping me??
Hell yes
that is indeed rad art
very very nice
Of course that meme is referenced
yes, very good!
okay, that design is cool
<@!761405600919584789>
On the left is Marian, from Double Dragon. Specifically Double Dragon Neon.
yes. a screenshot
3_skip
oh yes, Ma'am.
yes, very good!!



strong Maria is my Maria


But that goes into theory work
she was also in love with god and built the tower of babel and shit. Which leads us back to catholic. I don't think she would want to be the one worshipped, I think she would want her God to be instead.


highly doubt it
she also did not have a normal childhood, that is also a good point to make
but then again, Gear is set in the future, who knows
both are common there
or greek catholic
well, she is Ukrainian, right? so she would most likely be catholic




3_skip
but I can check
I got my start with his collection, so I am sure that what I have he most definitely also has
while looking for that one I found some others that I thought look really cool.
<@!331908049822547978>




it is indeed
Maria in armor is a good look
very nice

oh, wait, that was Megalovania

but yeah, we got a fuckton of different bread
and beer, as I hear
I am German, so you know that I am productive by default
So am I
nice. Good artwork
how to spot someone who doesn't watch hololive.
is that dad?
it's just... strange
a sweater covers the torso, at least the ones I know. and no, it's not rolled up, it is actually cut off at the chest
the sports bra, okay, yeah, but what is that weird fabric she wears over that?
and still, very weird outfit
and there she is again. Still, very cool design
She probably thinks something like: "We really need to check if we locked the door next time"
the character, I mean
weird outfit, but cool design in its simplicity
borgar
she scares me a bit

I remember that Ryuko. That's a nice Ryuko
and of course Hibiki and Miku are gay as hell
Looks very classy
Oh that's nice
Sammy!!!
Ryuko is one of my favorite anime characters
cute!
source is in the top right

yeah, in a way. I mean, I can actually see her doing that as a profession later in life.
it's a new spin on the character, but not one that completely changes her.
maybe because it is not deviating too much from her established character in the show? She is the calm type, which would fit well with the think before act sciency profession.


very gay indeed. and we love it




nice!




Diana and Akko from Little Witch Academia








oh, whoops, forgot the skip


(also, she is wearing something under it)
it fits, and it's on the outside. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
That is true. There isn't. Also, nice
rare to see nowadays
well, the picture is from 2016, so...

Pomu!!
I think I have that one
I haven't watched the show yet, I always put it off. I know that ship because it's by far the most popular.


"Best friends"
The other Atelier games I have not played yet
I only played first Ryza game so far. It's fun.

When the perception is sus
I would try it. I like spicy food.
I thought that was Pomu for a second. She had a deskjob


nice!




Now, Splatoon? Oh, boy
The thing is, though, that Metroid also looks that way. The games always have a gloomy atmosphere and setting.
Yeah, Metroid's lore is pretty fucking dark
For real, though. Mario and Bowser? Peach kidnapping. Kirby and Dedede? I don't know, stealing food, I guess. Fox and Wolf? Two different sides of a conflict. Samus and Ridley? He killed EVERYONE she knew and loved and she just survived by some freak coincidence.


Also, this black suit looks great

hell, society in general needs that
Video games need more buff ladies


I see
ah, that's where she's from. Never knew
yeah, that's the scene. She just fucked her shit up right.
I disagree there. I really liked the show. I feel the movies sometimes trim down too much.
3_skip

like, damn. that scene was brutal
Also shoot to kill if someone touches daughter
sorry
ah, shit. Sorry, forgot about the skip thing.


hey, look, it's the gay ones!
nice!

"best friends"
still, thanks for the ping regardless
there are a million better strong female characters for me
it's not that I *hate* her, I just don't like her
hell, her design is not even really all that and a bag of chips for me
Maybe because she is a brawler. but I don't really care for her at all. Her character is very meh at *best*.
FF in general with the exception of maybe 9
I don't really care for FF7
smol witch child
they are clones, so...
it looks like Basa is standing there in the background going: the fuck is her problem?
well, I would disagree. Tsubasa has a character. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
stabby stabby
no worries
I hated it. a lot
that's predatory behavior
the one girl throws herself at the other without her consent.
that's not what predator means
for real.
citrus is ass. that again depicts the "gay people are predators" trope
but ey, at least they noticed
that's Japan for you
Like, asexual people can of course love. The note said otherwise
Then there is Death Stranding and its notes about asexuality, which had an editor's note edited in in the Director's Cut how the content is not founded on facts and stuff like that. It was supposed to be a commentary on Japan's declining birth rate, but it was worded in a way that made it seem that asexual people are just unable to get sex and relationships, instead of literally not needing or wanting sex.
there were two gay characters in Persona 5 who are creeping on Ryuji hard. They are depicted as absolute joke characters, gay guys with makeup and all that. The dialogue was rewritten in the western version of P5 Royal to make them way less offensive
look up General Blue from Dragonball. That's a whole can of worms
yep
but again, there is a shift going on
Japanese also have that bullshit view point often that homosexual people "disregard gender for love". As in, they are not gay, they just love this one person so much that they ignore the gender. Which is total bullshit.
granted, there is a noticeable shift nowadays away from that.
Japan has that issue with homosexuality in general, but ESPECIALLY with guys. With women it's considered cute and a "phase", with men they are often depicted as predators and joke characters to laugh at
I feel ya
yeah
hints, but no resolution
you know, typical japanese game
it's in the story, more talk than show
Klaudia is legit crushing on Ryza. It's adorable.
pretty much
"best friends"




nah, you are just passionate about a very personal topic and tent to then say stuff that is a bit aggressive, which I just want to point out, because I feel being called out on something like that is very helpful.
you're not. no one here hates you.
everyone does it, it's not bad. that's how you form opinions and relationships with people
that is judging. It's not a BAD judging, I am not saying it, but it's still judging.
And you said you don't like it when people have a negative opinion about it, right?
okay, I agree with what you said about homosexuality.
the talk about "correct opinions" is judging par excelance
judging is not bad by default. you can judge with good intentions
you are absolutely insane if you think you don't judge
you are
yes
you are currently judging Stage
you do too
that's human instinct
always
everyone judges
no there isn't
but still, would have been cool if they managed to control the extreme power of that state
It makes sense they got rid of it, considering the berserker is when the user loses control of the gears, and as they gain more experience, they control it better
3_skip
maybe, but still a nice look

horns?
nice





someone said they prefer maces over swords



isn't the manga even gayer than the show?




Anytime, Irina



it's great. and cute




sure, but I doubt that's why I like her so much. Maybe it's that she is rather awkward in social situations. I think that's adorable.
nah, I just think she adorable and I want to give her headpats. The fact that her parents are rich has nothing to do with it


I don't know why, but Maki triggers my paternal instincts
indeed.
original doesn't exist anymore, sadly

cute!
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>

I am sad. I was not pinged.

Thanks for the ping!
yes! I like her

I need it!
There should be a new season focusing on Nanoha! Please!
Nanoha is awesome
I mean, it looks cool. Thanks
don't they all only have one eye with two pupils in it?
yes



they do indeed

Nice!!

so pretty
happened to me to sometimes
possible, and you maybe just saved it
or embedded
try has image

Hey, remember her?
that gay shit

good time
absolutely!!
Can't wait for Marian in RCG2
completed the game on hard and everything. was fun
Me too. I got everything in the game
WayForward are great, and that game is really good. Can't wait for the sequel

Persona 5 had that too
yeah, it's "haha gay people and trans people."
bitch, go outside! touch grass! stop making anime!
There are legit people getting into creating anime because they want to draw "cute girls"
weird, right?
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
honestly, one of the moments I felt the game could have dropped the anime tropes
which she also didn't like, yeah.
probably. He never got laid, considering his background. And Ann is a HUMAN!
at least nowadays
I am pretty sure everyone knows that.
Morgana is thirsty as fuck for "lady Ann"
The game really forces you to get the story going at the beginning, and uses the cat for that. so people don't like the cat
basically, "go to sleep, asshole" and simping for Ann, I guess.
the games didn't take off until 5
not really



we have to be careful not to be too thirsty. this is sfw

Becky Lynch could break me in half.
indeed
I liked muscular women before Maria. A shame that she isn't ripped in the actual show.
and Maria is, according to the show runners, the physically strongest member of the gears
muscular women are great.

ha, nice
the US manual of Metroid 1 still calls Samus "he"
and the rest is history
In the original Metroid. She was actually originally just a robot, but someone in the dev team said: "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if she was a woman?"
Samus Aran, my favorite Nintendo character




her slimmer physique would make her way more flexible, though
she is slimmer, so I would say her muscles would not be as defined.

let me retry
wait, that was maybe a bit too nsfw
I guess that's us right now
happens to all of us. like posting text in hiero

Nintendo will never do that
emulators
now, the ||Metroid stuff|| in Dread? Yeah, that seems to be more severe.
it's only a handprint
Not much, just a tiny bit
she was never a factor in their calculations, and she wanted to fight. and fast
it's more complicated than that
nothing special, no
yeah, it's just a complicated finger print scan or something
unique is just that their technology requires that genetic hand print to work. Only when the Chozo DNA gets recognised, will it function. So, for her to use the suit, she needed the DNA
Hell, in Metroid Dread, because of stuff that happened in Fusion because of the X parasites, she ||turns out to be part Metroid||
the suit uses technology only usable by chozo. so for it to work, she needed to have that DNA, so they basically genetically modified her.
here's the thing:
trained her, and gave her the suit
they raised her
they adopted Samus when they found her as the only survivor of the attack of the space pirates on her colony. she was 6 years old
a highly intelligent spacebird race
she has Chozo DNA inside her, maybe that keeps her hair healthy.
true. When Zelda 1 was about to come out, one magazine thought Link was a girl and drew artwork for it. You can imagine the internet when they discovered those pages.
it's not really that tight, from what we saw in the games
that's actually a Japanese manga
Samus has it in a ponytail, so she probably can just easily put it to the side or something
In Prime 3, where she is corrupting over the course of the game, you see a black vein running over her face, getting longer and longer as the game progresses
fun fact: if you shoot your charge beam close and into a wall in the Prime series, you'll see Samus' face reflect in the visor.
She gave him permission to shut up

she's making valentine's day's chocolate. I wonder for whom?
thanks
which I would not be surprised if it happened
unless, of course, there is a major plot twist coming up
no, but I know that this is basically the ascians face mask thing.
well, I played base ARR so far
true, yeah. flying is great. I also like that you get it after basically 100 hours of playing. So, I really noticed the difference
so, there's that, as well
and I know about Shadowbringer's fan name
Can't wait
I heard. I also heard it gets really fucking good. And I already liked base ARR a lot.
yep
I just finished ARR's 2.0 story recently
I am looking forward to the stuff after 2.0
I like her a lot. Her German voice actress does an amazing job selling her character


Carol is an ascian? I would have never guessed
3_skip
reminds me of the miner's hat Y'Shtola wears in one scene in FF14. It also has space for her cat ears.
that's cute

very gay
oh that's cool!

I hate it when you give reasonable responses
I know, that's why I said I know they do it to sell pulls. But still, it's so unfair! Put the designers in games with substance!
How come gachas most of the time have pretty sick character design? I mean, I know why, because they need to get you to pull and spend money, but still.
Peach!

the cutest!
Damn it, I am damaged. I thought the two in the sand were Kronii and Miko, and the one on the left Korone.

I prefer this look.

But yeah, I am looking forward to her in RCG2
technically, the top screenshot is from RCG1
Lady
I always peek into the group chat I am in, I just don't respond.
Oh, Videl! Nice
I must say, I am pleasantly surprised by XBC3, from what I saw
oh, the cool and insane one.
oh?
as I mentioned
She is my favorite
Also, this color scheme. Damn.

That's Shameimaru Aya from Touhou
so, the crow

Okay, yeah, I like Mio. She is neat

but that's why we have fanfics
sadly. just stick to a pairing and develop it!
of course, the intend behind it is to give all shippers something, but if you try and please everyone, you end up pleasing no one.
Anime tends to do yuri bait. it annoys me, honestly. Times have changed! Show it!
Goddamn it, Symphogear!! Give us the kiss!

Feito-chan
I assume so as well. Looks very much like how official wallpapers used to be
oh neat!
Thank you!

cute
May be weird to point out, but I really like her physique here. Doesn't look too thin. It fits her.
Daidouji!!!
her German voice actress adds a lot to her character, I find.
I know people's opinions about Minfilia are... mixed, but I really like her

absolutely. I dig the urban style
That's the kind of stuff I like
damn!

I haven't played the game, but I like her attitude
I kinda like her


I remember reading the comic. It was fun


3_skip


very cute!


I feel they could have still done a lot with those two
Understandable
But yeah, the picture is big. And lots of detail in the background. The artist probably didn't want to risk losing detail.
like I said, 24K resolution
just checked. Yeah, the pic is massive
That's cool! Women in gear are great
26 mb??? Either the pic is in 24K resolution, or someone doesn't know how to compress

Oh, nice. That outfit fits her
thanks for the pin! Awesome Makoto art
Looking forward to Ryza 3. But I need to finish 1 and 2 first
So cute!
Eunie's the bus
Ryza a cute
Yo! Seras Victoria!
Right, Yuna has the higher base stats, right?



She would have.
the character design reminds me of PreCure.
very gay
"Here's your food. Choke on it, you dick."
Goddamn it, Akko! Focus!
Weiss! nice!
had to, sorry
I'm a frayed knot.
She is the Legendary Super Symphogear
"Miku's power is... maximumer!"
maybe there is a reason she hasn't used it yet. Maybe it is too powerful and would just obliterate her target
ow
true
I see Daidouji in there
No bulli the cinnamon roll!
and I have to admit, I forgot this was the xv channel
I just looked into it was memeing around a bit.
I feel it works better when I experience it for its intended purpose
that's the intention
don't want to hear the music outside the show.
oh, I avoided anything regarding XV
the word does't ring a bell to me
what's Metanoia?
why, what happened?
you're welcome
Like I said, I have this one
seems like I can't find it
Just post away
I had one with the regular face, where they just start to crawl away
The one where they are on the back of her head?
I found a version of it, but not the one I meant
Does anyone have that gif where Bikki's eyes turn into bugs and run away?
Symphogear XV episode 666: Elfnein fucking dies!
take a guess, Fran.
oh, yes, I did!
if that was a joke, I'm sorry, it did not reach me.
that does make no fucking sense.
just noticed I did not make that clear and just wrote into an existing conversation
of XV, I mean
promising start
was good
Just watched the first episode.
quack
HEY!
Can't wait for Maria's transformation sequence
that could make the camera pans work
Maybe they even used some 3D models in a few frames. With the right tech it looks identical to 2D
can't do that rotoscoped
yeah, you need the motion and illusion of speed with the in-betweens
Maria's outfit was amazing!!
The concert was so beautiful!
a lot heavier
yeah, true
But that's minor, considering it's just the opening
I really liked the episode, I must say. Only slight issue I had is that the opening for this season sounds and looks really generic
"Miku, where is my super suit?"
Just finished episode 2. Very good stuff. The antagonists really made an entrance
I like how they used her trauma from S1 here
her fear? I thought she used the other people's fear
Yeah, the vampire girl really doesn't fuck around
I'd watch it
Probably make an hour long concert
poo!
I wanna know how Tsubasa will handle what happened.
the more rounded look
I liked the looks of the scenes with Chris at the beginning.
we need a middle finger edit of that Kiri
that looks familiar
That would have been horrible
you could have said Batman
they seemed to up the service every season
no
I did not know Kiri was a Bayblade player
cya
And suddenly, meme
I didn't even think anything of it when I saw it in the episode
Curse you, internet
And so quickly
How is this a meme??
But I also have no real opinion about her yet, haven't seen enough of her
I have no problem with her design.
"Do you remember how many shitposts you made in your life?"
oh, I see
I won't, I was just reminded of it because of what Kerrik posted
you know how it is. Tiddy distracts.
I remember it was a No.1 bestseller on dlsite. People absolutely adored the creator for all the blood and tears he put in the game
yeah, basically
Carol is the small bad witch
Gif is from the eroge Wolfgirl With You, by the way. The animation in that game is really good.
Liru?
Miku gay? That's a massive spoiler!
the important questions!
I want this!!
Maria should also be more buff. Isn't she supposed to the the second strongest in physical strenght?
the one the Persona is based on, apparently
yeah, once. but her arms are still not as muscly as they should be
by whom?
YES
yes
why isn't she buff in the show, by the way?
but then: Tsubasa already had negative sanity from Kanade's death, so it underflows and makes her super ascended
One you can't defeat, because you cannot fathom its form
I thought that was a bunch of dried out banana peels
I see what I have and post it in <#336297674707828747> Raneaa

but then they can't be stereotypical cute moe girls
Fit/buff girls in general give me life
Meh, they could give some some buff gears!!!
so?
And he is buff as hell
She also trains under Gen
ai desu yo
Miku should run more
I'd prefer her alive.
you eat your wife?
that's usually just rule of cool.
It's a cartoon.
oh, that it bad
Or Shenmue
yeah, I prefer them putting one complete plot into one season
And I said I disagree
I disagree.
that's your opinion.
I thought is was rather neat.
My weapon destroys swords. You see yourself as a sword, as such, it can destroy you.
I kinda like the idea that the autoscorers basically destroyed on a philosophical level.
and gay
don't forget the music
love and music, kerrik
yeah, agreed there
just like that
you live, you die.
that's how it is sometimes.
every death flag in the world
I mean, would that not just make us expect her to die? Random character shows up and says that
This will never happen <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I don't really care for her singing, for me it's more the composition as a whole that's important. And maybe because I expected something different in terms of sound.
yeah, I think it sounds too generic, or maybe not too "mechanical", if that makes sense. I feel the guitar is way too prominent. I prefer the more electronic, synth sound of the other openings.
I honestly don't know what to think of the new opening song yet.
Okay. Weird. Wonder what the connection is.
what does that even mean?
that was the name of the opening song for XV, right?
oh, yeah, if they dedicated time to the pairings, it could have worked out.
true
are there any connections between them in terms of interactions?
besides the points you mentioned, what other reason was there to pair them like that?
I get what Melua tries to say
yes, protect!!
yep
People like different pairings, which is fine.
by the way, no actual shipping wars here.
It gives me life
Hey, TsubaMari is great!
Ah, I get ya.
You like her voice?
"by the way, here is your best friend dying in your arms again"
I mean, makes sense that Basa would be traumatized by it, wouldn't it?
oh, wfc lives for Kanade, pretty much.
"People loved that!"
yeah, I figured you wouldn't like it.
yeah, you're right. I did not even really think anything of it.
oh, yeah, good point, wfc.
But Crunchy fucking the translations up would not be a first.
Commie's says: "No audience life signs"
sorry to hear that
oh, damn
here we go
oh
The first thing I thought during that attack was "Beyblade" as well
I like that she so fucking extra.
Cags I like, but I can understand how you don't like her.
yeah, he was more of a pragmatist.
I liked him *because* he was such a shit
I liked his cocky, arrogant behavior.
Really?
if they are well done
I like them too
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
done, it's fixed
A second.
the wiki seems to be worked on by CR staff.
so much this.
this
yes!
yeah, CR are very bad.
aight
Same region
And if they are in any relation to the Bavarian Illuminati, it would make sense, as Elsa is a Scandinavian name, Swedish, to be precise.
so, if it's Erusa, I would say Elsa is the name they were going for.
yep
Za would look like this: ザ
Erusa
oh, yeah, you're right.
so, both are wrong?
that's what it actually says.
Erisa
dess
But Maria is for hugs and protecting.
on main?
why is everyone horny?
you don't notice that in the actual show
good stuff
Well, I'd say Commie's is a more casual way of translating what she said, which fits the way she behaves, with her smile and wink
yeah, she didn't. At least I am pretty sure she didn't. My Japanese is not that good
explosion and all that
well, maybe she was really exhausted? and we did not see the evacuation process
This is the Commie version.
or rather, assumed
I expected as much
Commie used a line which pretty much conveys the same tongue-in-cheek way of her saying that
Maria is for Basa to snacc
(That was not in the subs I have, by the way)
She is perfect!
"For my age"? Lady, we need to talk!
by Basa's or Maria's blade
he dies like a dog!
no, no seppuku! that would restore a part of his honor
I hope Maria is tear him to pieces
TsubaMari is good.
and a character
It just gives them a motive
what even is there to jiggle?
Miku fucking dies
(was a reply to Nara, just to be clear)
of course not
muh homies!
I can see where Yasuo comes from
but not really xv related, is it?
I needed to wait days for a patch to drop
I remember Jak & Daxter had a severe bug in a cutscene that always crashed on PS4. You can't skip cutscenes, and this one is needed for 100%.
I never played 3. I believe you can download it for PS4
I only ever played 1, back in my youth. I enjoyed it, but never finished it. The German translation was bad, though.
I remember
Ah, of course.
What is a Newfoundland Tricolor?
GX flashbacks
again?
I hope angst and disaster will happen
well, they will be forced to stay low
then, in 6, we get the calm episode, which focuses on the interaction between gears. then, in 7, the big bad makes their move, then the gears lose in 8, in 9 they get a powerup to fight the bad guys, and then we get the prep and grand finale
next episode will be the infodump, with one fight, because we need those in every episode.
of course we will
there was a lot of weird shit in this episode, honestly.
I think lunch
well, I'd say, easy paycheck for the others, then. Let Hibiki deal with it.
Did they have lunch?
yeah, that was one of those weird moments. Where were the rest of the team?
the episode played out pretty much how I expected it
I was no hype.
I am a little bit on the fence about it
just watched the new episode.
wait, what the fuck?
I didn't like her transformation (a bit of a personal pet peeve of mine, because of that one segment) and her song sounded mediocre, I found. But I felt that about the entire soundtrack of this season so far, especially the opening. Listening to it for the fourth time, I kinda got over my distaste for its generic butt rock sound, but it's still not nearly as good as the ones in the previous seasons. I reckon something similar goes on with Maria's song for me. The fight was good, but very short.
I was bothered by a few things. I wouldn't say the episode was bad, far from it. Just not as good.
*one* of the weaker ones
definitely one of the weaker episodes of the show
like, how the rest of her team disappeared when the fight started and such
her entire fight was a bit wonky, too, in my opinion.
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Didn't like the transformations this episode, really. Maria's really rubbed me the wrong way. I found the entire episode was just okay.
bringing them back from the dead would be the biggest asspull
I find, Kanade should stay dead, as should the alchemists
they will not be able to shove stuff in. Much will fall flat.
If they have time to give her a transformation that completely goes against her fighting style, they have the time to scrap that, and give her a transformation that works
also, they do have time
if they don't have time, don't do it. Don't shoehorn shit in.
give Hibiki something that fits this style!
yeah, so give her something that blends into that.
give her a transformation that makes her faster, her attacks more elegant and powerful. Don't just give her what are basically hammers to blindly swing around
she was just standing around
Not there
no. Hibiki fights with style, speed.
"Well she no longer fights with her actual hands so it obviously doesn't fit the character that insists on holding everyone's hands"
that, right there, is critical misunderstanding of the basic designs of the characters from the writers.
but the ignite had a build up in the season. Elfnein explained what she used, how she used, and why she used it. In XV it was just like: "Oh, new powerup. Boom."
oh, I know of that. yeah, there is a connection, but still, it felt forced. I also felt the episode introduced stuff and wrapped it up way too quickly. Either dedicate more time to it, or remove it, I say. Like Hibiki's self-doubts. And the powerup could have come into the show maybe a bit later.
or rather, Saint Germain was. We haven't seen the others yet
I felt the alchemists were the ultimate deus ex machina. It was okay, just felt unfitting.
Basa will be manipulated by Millaarc or something. She did that weird eye thing.
Chris tries to bring her parents back, loses friend instead
and eats it too
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<@!263983345669505025> it's done, by the way
It's a multi purpose format

give me a minute
Friday, gotta get down on Friday
still Friday
In Germany neither
I am looking forward to it a lot
That reminds me of that weird album Joel from Vinesauce made, wfc.
she bust a cap in that ghost
On that day, Miku figured out how to kill a ghost
in my opinion, that's canon, and Hibiki and Miku will have many lovely children
how could you?
nice Hellsing Abridged reference
honestly, there is a lot of stuff I found hit or miss this season, but this is the one thing I can honestly give a big fat nope to.
rubbed me the wrong way
I did not like her animation.
Don't know. I assume they take the speed out of the episodes when dealing with Basa's issues more in-depth.
yeah, it's a slow burner, definitely
was pretty good. I enjoyed how they mentioned Basa's mental breakdown, and I liked the scenes with Elfnein a lot.
oki, just finished ep 5
literally best girl
isn't that how basically every season after the first happened? they wrote a crapton for the first season, but could not use it all, and then designed the rest of the seasons around the unused concepts.
And Elfnein yells: "I'm coming for you motherfuckers!"
"Run, the small girl has a gun!"
and go berserk too
Elfnein will taste blood. Literally
definitely
I expected Tsubasa attacking some survivor with her massive sword attack.
"Mutter, uhuhu..."
that pun hurt me physically
If they altered the rhythm and measures of the songs, it could have worked.
I could imagine the ignite remixes being pretty much an afterthought. None of the songs were written with the hard wubs of the remixes in mind, so the entire structure of them works against the remixes.
I reckon we would get a scene that makes Hellsing Ultimate look like Kemono Friends.
can you imagine how absolutely apeshit she would go if that happens and she finds the people responsible?
she did

Cags can Ara Ara everyone
NO FEAR
Symphogear XV 6 preview
ONE FEAR
ONE FEAR
I could imagine that she agreed to voicing Kanade because she dies in the first episode.
she doesn't want to do it anymore, if I remember right
Totsuka No Tsurugi
In fact, Ame No Habakiri is just one name of a mythological sword from a family of other mythological swords
there is no "right" way to spell it that stuck over centuries
it's made up anyway
Well, they are all, besides Ichiaval, actual mythological weapons
that was actually the way it was written in season 1
no
I never understood the big deal about the name of her sword, really.
heaven no rend
that's the best part
yep, like I said, she is hardcore
I prefer Kerrik's version
Asumin's fucking hardcore, it seems
The way he avoided the missiles was great too. Just drive up the wall or whatever, flip the car.
Symphogear is a mod for Wild Arms
Proto Bikki
Hibiki was already in Wild Arms
you wanna talk about that aggression?

in a dream or something
I doubt she'll return. And if she does, she will not speak
I thought: "hm, that's not okay"
A normal one. Why?
sorry, not sorry

I wish
she'd do it when Basa would hurt someone
doubt it, it's not her style
"Today I suplexed my wife"

always yeet


Like, I watch it, enjoy it, and done.
I watch the episodes in a "in the moment" mindset, if that makes sense.
I don't know. I have honestly not speculated about anything.
not my cup of tea. I don't like high-phantasy stuff.
It does not interest me
I know what's it about. It was literally talked about for years nonstop
Even though I don't care for the final product, his dedication and eye for detail is recommendable
but I am a fan or the process of writing and the mindset behind it
Never read or watched any of it
No, I don't care for it.
Wasn't a manuscript discovered a few years back?
that's unfinished
That's what I meant, the stuff besides that Middle Earth stuff
and yeah, Symphogear is fun because of its goofy flaws
some are still unfinished
Tolkien also had a shit ton of time to write. He took years to finish his books
because you know every person, Armados, and the scenarios surrounding them
it's a problem with any publisher
no
sometimes you have to do it to get shit done
there are also deadlines and such
rofl
you could also watch stuff besides anime, or read a book

What you described is pretty much a trope, like a generic Hollywood movie.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
DMJii
ALL THE TIME!
***PLEASE!!***
TsubaMari couple
Steamed Hams is timeless
If that would ever happen, Melua, I will reject this reality
but let's get back to xv discussion
The only reason Yumi gets so much hate in the west is because she is very popular in Japan. Which is odd, because her entire design is a *parody* of the cutesy waifu stereotype.
screw the haters
Yumi is honestly good
bikinis are clothes
in a bikini?
you don't?
A talking Yumi head. Huh
Maria is still best
Trust me, I can't. *hahathiswasareferencetomyname*
Hey!
Maria is best everything!!
it should end like the other seasons, in my opinion, just without cliff hanger
no
It's Basa. No one but Maria can reach her!
She better
Eisnein
or rather
Icenein
which, however, if you remember Carol's background, reference a lot of stuff from her past.
loved this wall of random German
well, the latest episode was fun
Commie uses a similar wording to YT
not yet, but after that episode I can see it pick up
I just meant that they can easily come back, not that it would be a good move in the narrative
Unless I missed something, them being broken means nothing
She still returned in XV
Melua, remember that Garie was cut in half by Maria and exploded in GX
like the effect with her outfit in the number, like some filter or window
that looks cool
for whatever reason
the german translation of donald duck stories uses Taler and Kreuzer, by the way.
I see, sorry
makes sense
but, considering how rather obscure that fairytale is, that mistake is understandable
Commie caught that, and translated it correctly.
The German name for The Star Money, in case you want to look it up
it's Sterntaler, actually, which is a fairytale
Taler
KonoScorer
I don't watch YTs subs, that's why I'm asking
to you have a screenshot?
hard to read?
what do you mean?
She'll blasting when she's done eating
very good
knowing how Chris eats, can you imagine her at a burger joint? Like, Wendy's or Burger King.
and shoot stuff. well trained with firearms. fits
now you can drive Miku around
pinch pinch
the worst thing about JoJo is not the absolutely bullshit show itself, but the annoying fans that try to push that garbage into everything
let Elfnein be yeeted in peace
no, they really shouldn't
YEET

I got a video of Elfnein being yeeted
Of course JoJo finds its way in here...

do not go to nsfw then
night
nah, that's weak
I did not, Dino
and considering the things I have seen, it's still child's play
let me just say one word: Orca
you poor children know nothing
oh, you think that's weird?
well, she is a professional opera singer.
how?`
"What do you mean, yeet?"
just for hype
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
well, if you have nothing good to say...
I don't see them having any reason to return now. But who knows
I always liked Carol
genocide?
Maria's song in GX is still my favorite from the whole show
GX is good
shut up!
amazing song, and by a villain
*roblox_oof.mp3*
weebs can rise?
yes, of course

yeah, Maya, you're right.
None of you are free of sin!
but I understand Kriisa's reaction
y'all weebs!
obviously. I don't want to guess what they are saying
No, I don't even look at the preview images, Solo
and I am no hype. I hardly ever get hyped. I enjoy the show, but I am not one to go crazy over stuff. Never was.
I have no idea if that even happens. I don't look anything up about the new episode and like to keep myself in the dark
I have my go-to sub group, and I stick with them. It's just a personal preference
I download it
Never
at least one more day for me. have to wait for subs
I never use CR. Never have
Thanks!
oh, that's good to know.
I can't wait to have 500 Kiricoins again for a new drop

you get tokens when you get a copy of a card that is awaken to max
I want all the Maria cards!
oki
we can't check how many we have yet, right?
No problem here. Give him his waifu
would be cool. For example, you could turn your Chris token in a Kanade token and get a guarantied Kanade
but then again, we will most likely be able to change them into different tokens.
you know, I still find it weird that we get tokens for characters we have so much of that we get the tokens in the first place
damn, that must suck. I think I have three

but how? and why? A cyst? Can that happen?
what? you okay??
What do you mean?
<@!246146781832806401> "The bible is right." Whenever I hear people say that, I say: The bible forbids hair cuts. It says that if people get a divorce the woman has to be stoned to death. The bible states that if a woman is raped the rapist can buy her and own her. Well. (moved to serious discussion.)
Monster Boy Quest
Antient greek must have been a fucking party nonstop.
like what?
One son cut of his dad's balls and threw them into the ocean, creating aphrodite.
damn
Leda, not Helen.
Like, greek gods are hardcore
Zeus turned into a swan and raped Helen.
and give money to the church
you know what puzzles me? Why does christianity even have hell if, according to every priest, God forgives everything?
agnostic means "not seeing". an agnostic believes that a greater power can not be proven or disproven
I am an atheist, but it pisses me off to no end when people misuse religion.
^this
Luckily, in Germany religious schools are forbidden.
but the context is the important part. EVERYTHING can be aggressive or offensive if used in the wrong context.
They are. trust me
<@456226577798135808> It can, at least in German. There is this very aggressive "Hallo??" you yell when you believe the person you are talking to is acting out of line.
<@!337316978098176011> Oh, for as long as I can think of.

The word itself (Fräulein) is not offensive, but is used by parents everywhere here towards their daughters whenever they misbehaved that if you call a woman "Fräulein" nowadays, they take it as offence.
Like the word "Fräulein" in German
I have to take pills for my chronic disease. They are called retard pills. Because they react delayed
No, I was more refering to sexuality and stuff. You brought slavery in this, and I just made a dumb joke. A member of a former band of mine and a very good friend is gay, and people gave him a lot of shit because of that. He will get offended if you make jokes in that regard. And understandably so.
I mean, you can chose to have slaves, so maybe?
I mean, I can understand how it would effect people, like, let's say you had to live with oppression up to a point because of what you believe in, what you like or similar. Of course a slur in that regard will offend you. I understand that.
I also never got offended. I am German, and we not only hear slurs on the internet, trust me.
I could say one, but nah.
We have
sorry, misread
oh, i get it
how so?
I think it's more that you don't see what you don't WANT to see
a little bit higher and it would have hit his aorta
He was goofing around with a friend of his and for some weird reason his buddy pulled a knife on him and tried to fake stabbing him. Only, it wasn't quite as fake as he accidentally got stabbed. 1cm deep and 4cm wide was the cut.
My best buddy almost died yesterday.
Same here, it's just irresponsible. Let's hope he learned his lesson.
That's the scary part
But the thing is, it was pretty serious. A bit further and his aorta would have been hit.
They were. He told me about it.
I don't know what he is going to do, haven't talked to him since then. I know that he was just as much doing bullshit at that moment. We will see. I am also pretty certain they were drunk.
Well, Alice, he lives in Germany, we have no hospital bills.
A big one
I don't know
yeah, that's what I meant
he is, so am I.
I saw pics. He bled like mad
In fact, humans are the only mammals to still drink milk when not infants. Lactose intolerance is actually normal in grown mammals.
hm
How ever, the thing with your family reminds me a bit of what a very good friend and former bassist of my old band went through. He is gay, and his family was very, very NOT fond of that.
I can't even relate, if I can be honest. I've never known any trans people personally.
hm, that is indeed difficult. Wow. I don't think I could give any advise in this regard.
reasonable
ah, say no more
how so?
true, there are different kinds of happiness. The long term happiness is the one that requires dedication. And even then it's not easy to find.
be what makes you happy and feels right, I'd say
customer service 101, it seems
support
Thinking back on it, it was obvious, but I ran around with it for years.
I've been through depression myself.
It's okay to be sad, angry, happy, mad... it's just when you can't feel anything else you should seek help.
god, I butchered that sentence
I honestly don't know how I long I had to take mine before they took effect. all I know is that I don't have to take them anymore.
oh, so you took them a while already.
They can take days to take effect
antidepressants take time to actually do something. Just keep taking them. You will feel better soon.
I love playing around with the switches and variables to create the most complicated stuff
RPG Maker games are rather easy to make, actually. I suggest writing everything you want and need down first, like mechanics, items, quests, and such, and just work the list down.
bullshit is bullshit, does not matter how long someone is somewhere
call out, Saki, call out.
that's how it should be
better save than sorry
and OR
I broke my hand once. Needed ten weeks to heal
Good. I hope the foot, if it's broken, is not too badly broken.
or is there a problem?
well, do it.
Go to a hospital quickly
Fucking hell
You okay?
What???
And honestly,if anyone here thinks I am not allowed to speak for a group I don't represent, should I get my best friend in here? He's gay. He uses the word "faggot" left and right, as, how he says it: "I'm gay, not a fag."
like 80% of it
Really? Sorry, that's not how I read it, in the very least.
When I say that you can go fuck yourself, do you interpret it as "please leave me alone"?
Where?
Wynne told me to shut the fuck up, in a round about way.
Wynne never said: "please don't"
That's not what I meant
No, I just tried to make a point that it's just a word in a dumb show
Man, I am not awake yet
I misread your comment
SORRY
I'm just saying that banning it may not be the right way of approaching it. Sure, using it against someone should not be, but discussing it should be possible.
And then the people who are gay embraced it and went with it and now it's cool.
Oh, you mean like the word gay was an insult for years?
As such, Carneg's point of the word itself not being a slur, is solid.
So, if it's used correctly, there should be no problem, right? As in, not use it to address you guys, for example.
This article talks about how the word is misused to label people who in fact are trans.
so it seems so
Carneg, according to the dictionary:
Noun

slur (plural slurs)

    An insult or slight.
Again, Carneg, context
Well, you aren't one
or rather, can be one
EVERYTHING is a slur then, really
there are people who call themselves geeks and are proud of it
It's the context.
Don't worry, Alice, I would never call someone names here.
Traps and trans people are two different things, I thought
That did not even come to mind
oh, trap
exactly, Kerrik
It depends on how you use it, really.
you mean trans? Isn't that just short for transsexual?
sure, if you wanna slap too
Sticks and stones
Ain't that the truth, Carneg.
that's good, at least
You don't have to tell us what it is if you don't want to.
I know, I am sorry.
I never knew that.
That's the name of the song?
Bark At The Moon? The  Ozzy Osbourne song?
Let's not forget the video get more and more red.

Yes, the part

I consider shipping more phantasy and talking about it then trying to get them together.
Is that shipping, or hooking up?
it can be. Depends on the person.
I know we can all take a joke, but keep it in mind.
Shipping with fictional characters is fine. Real people shipping is awkward and can be very insulting to the people getting shipped.
EU
The former bassist of my old band is gay. I never felt an "aura", as you put it, Kerrik.
that's human nature in its most basic form, sadly.
in fact, I reckon it's the minority of gays and lesbians who do it.
Now, it's of course not everyone who does that
Kinda hypocritical, isn't it?
Yeah, that's what I mean
That's just the exact oppression many homosexuals experience.
I think it's coming. How could they not touch on that subject. But I also think it's a good move to not make Bert and Ernie gay, as they haven't done so for many of years, and now simply saying "Oh, yes, they are gay, by the way" would sound really insulting. Like token gay, if you will. Having them just to say you have them, not because it's important and explained.
yes
But I also have a friend I meet often, who is trans as well. I want to understand him more, you know?
Yes, of course.
No, no, you are correct.
oh, right
I don't know if I have a small voice.
I have some homosexual friends, and two transsexual friends. When I see them, I want to ask them about their experiences, see how they see things. If they want to, of course.
I think I understand your defensive nature regarding that topic better now.
That sounds horrible.
Twitter ripped the channel to shreds. It was amazing
Interestingly, the part "fat or pregnant" was apparently cut from the TV broadcast, but not the other segments
Seriously, I thought this was 2018.
Sorry if that is not suited for this channel, but I had to get that of my chest
Okay, rand time! Is German TV absolutely shit or what? Seriously, there is a show in German Television where people are put on a podium and then a "comedian" should guess one of two things: Is the person a businessman or need welfare? Is the woman pregnant or *just fat?* ***IS THAT PERSON HOMO OR HETERO?***
What the actual fuck! I know why I don't watch TV. I hope that prick's show gets canceled. It already caused a shitstorm like none other.
Seriously, they would eat that stuff up. The subreddit was even shut down because of what they write there.
incels
sounds like a dictatorship, almost. Do what we want or else
Trump is the biggest fucking idiot I have ever seen.
Like I said, 1940s
Yeah, and then they give themselves options to extend that change to other groups they don't like
but yeah, it reminds me very much of the 1940s Germany
I thought I said something wrong
oh thank god
what do you mean?
Maybe your parents should stop taking a book literally, that was written hundreds of years ago, for a time that does not exist anymore, and was filled with metaphors.
That was shit Hitler spouted.
"wrongfully"
I would call the German government, but no one understands them
never?
Or start an revolution. would not be the first time that happened.
that's great to hear
man, religion, I tell ya...
Oh, wow, heavens forbid someone feels loved.
If my child, son or daughter, came out to me, I'd he glad they did. I'd be happy they trust me enough to tell me that. And I would want them to feel save at home, able to live their life how they see fit
how can you love a being no one ever saw of has prove existed over your own child?
There is a difference between being religious and that, I find.
I can't understand how parents can not be supportive of their children
wow
that is a massive difference.
I live in Kiel, the biggest city in my state, and pay 412€ a month for my place
Man, that's really tough
too many people for not enough places, I guess
I see
stopping the owners of property to inflate the rents
Rent pay brake
We have laws against this, the so called "Mietpreisbremse"
See, that's another thing.
1200 for rent??
Jesus
I knew the town was expensive, but I did not know it was this much
but I don't live in New York. That's a totally different ball game
And I live fine
I make around 2200 a month.
wow, that's steep
you need 4000
oh, now I understand
hu?
you make less than 4000 on retail?
I think I misunderstand
wait
So, less that 2000 a month, I reckon?
damn
what's living wage?
I always find it surprising, how low the pay is for retail in other countries, for example
and I know how to handle people, so entitled customers don't stand a chance
just last month I had one entire week off because I worked so many hours overtime
so it evens out at the end of the year
and if I work overtime, I get those hours back by getting free days.
I got 30 days I can spend over the year
good pay, lots of days off, lots of rights and laws regulating stuff
In Germany, it's hella chill
I just really love interacting with people and helping them
you have to be made for it, I have to admit
sorry
I enjoy my work a lot
capitalism is what it's all about
I work in retail
But just be warned
sure
I hope his winning woke a lot of people up
Yeah, I thought it was crazy and will never work
Be the change you want to see in the world, as the saying goes
That's very good. Stand proud for what you believe it, and fight for it
I really do
Hey, hope dies last
With all that's happening currently.
I hope for you all here who live in the US that socialism comes through.
So, no party will have absolute power
our politics system is complicated, by the way. for example, it's separated in chairs around a table, and no party can have 100% of chairs, even if they got, theoretically 100% of votes
Ah, I see.
yeah, I only ever read about Democrats and Republicans
Ah, okay
damn typos
It baffles me that the US only has two parties, by the way. In Germany there are 42
I mean, it's Fox
that was me faceplaming
I don't know if you heard a slap
/sarcasm
Oh, wow, yeah, of course. That's the devil right there
Seriously, that still puzzles me about the US. How is this bad?
yeah, that's horrible, of course. God forbit people can go to the hospital or get their medication
oh, you mean like it is anywhere else?
oh, that I understand
So, I would not really know what Sanders was all about
I did not really catch the election and the candidates, i have to admit. The German press is not that in-depth with it.
Oh, wow. I was unaware that it was that hard there. I knew it is expensive to live there, but reading about it first hand...
^
I thought socialism was "let's try it a different way"
but I can go to a doctor whenever I want
yeah, it's pricy
we have taxes and stuff for that
Not being able to sue them is illegal in the EU.
I got the message about my Windows being not activated as well
<@456226577798135808> It was fixed the same evening
if they think it's dangerous, for example
Doctor's can deny it, though
and even if it isn't
Everyone can sue anyone if the reason is valid
how can someone disagree with that? being gay is not an opinion, it's a way of living
best of luck
I remember I had a depressive phase as well. It was very bad. My mood brightened up almost instantly when I moved into my own place
as long as gay people ACT like they are straight, homophobes can ignore they are gay
again, Kriisa, what you said probably fits into my ignoring theory.
oh, that crap. "Don't act gay". That's just dumb
I've seen it a lot of times. People who claim to be open about stuff mistake "being open" with "ignoring". As soon as they can't ignore it, they get weird.
I think it's more a "I am okay with things as long as it happens far away from me."
fuck evolution. Be you.
there is also no evidence that people are born straight
<:DMJii:458047433067200512>
I know it does not have as much value as hearing it from a family member, but I support you, Kriisa
oh, wow...
Honestly, I would not know how my mom would react. I will not say she would react differently, Kriisa
not wanting to sound like an ass, but that makes me glad that my mom is very openminded about that stuff
a way of being
so are you
When I was born I could not breathe on my own
understandably so
I will never take my health for granted again
Oh, damn, that sounds horrible
damn
but that's all I say
it can also be very bloody
it can be
chronic disease
I suffer from ulcerative colitis
Probably because of my attitude and behavior. A lot of people think I'm younger than I am.
I'm turning 31 this year as well.
I have regular bleedings in my colon. Not fun either
Because the NRA has power
true
Yeah, but it was not completely canned.
The US is the only country that still uses the original founding constitution. Every other country changed theirs at least once
what times are we living in when you can use something like this as an commonly understood example?`
wow, poor american google. I just looked up if I used the word "cowered" correctly, and as an example it gave me a sentence referring to school shootings.
wow, imagine my shock
I have to agree, Mel. If you find the right person, a relationship will feel like a relieve, and not work
my longest was two years
sure
no one is 100% stable
absolutely. I don't need another person to deal with if I don't even have my own shit sorted
The reason I don't have one is because I want to concentrate on me now. Career and all.
Oh, God, I hate that
the important step
but still, one of you made the move
imagine she didn't say anything
See? That's the best example right here, Mel!
but that comes with experience
oh, yeah, same
and a friend of mine still wastes them
trust me, I wasted some opportunities because of that
^ this.
no way
No one bleeds wine or poison. No one is above or beneath anyone
absolutely. That would have been the right way to handle it.
unless she was really sick
but vomiting at that IS a shit move
^
"she would have said something" is a bad approach.
wrong. you should have. it was a good move. she was just immature.
Man, wfc, I really want to help you out now, be your wingman, you know?
Much success, Lectric
damn, wfc, that fucking blows
I can only speak for Germany, but here you can NOT be fired for your behavior outside of work, if you do it without mentioning your work.
I wanna say that's highly sketchy
not at work, but outside of it
but yeah, just try and be yourself, wfc, no matter what others might think
I understand his problem, though. For many people it's very hard to shed off the persona they use at work.
See, that's completely different from my and my buddy. The hours he chewed my ear off because of his failed relationships might be around a hundred now. We support each other a lot
by "only friend", I mean the only one I do stuff with regularly
my best friend, and really only friend, is pretty chill in that regard. but I've known that dude for 18 years now, would be weird if he wasn't
that's a good approach. Stay true to yourself
I don't feel lonely, as I don't want a girlfriend right now, I am focusing on myself currently.
how do you know no woman wants you if you don't ask?
how do you know that if you avoid interacting with people?
I am 30, and my last girlfriend was 7 years ago.
you can always learn
there is no such thing as missing the time to learn
oh, and good luck, Sketch!
That's fine
Haven't had it in ages
Sauerkraut is delicious, absolutely.
Thanks for reminding me. Time to eat Sauerkraut and Bratwurst
No, I forgot.
you know I was joking
Don't pull Kriisa into this.
Nah, don't really like lists or spreadsheets
probably
I never got the appeal of figurines
because power and money
it all makes sense
Damn

you have to break a few heads to make a job
it was a lucky egg
Very nice
go for it
if you start to slur your words, seek help
pay attention to your way of speaking.
you can totally get a concussion from that. I would wait and keep talking with someone
^
Never say what you don't mean
everyone fucks up in relationships, that's why people have multiple
just keep in mind for the next relationship to not ask that again
oh, nevermind then
she told him her side of the story, that you suddenly dumped her
maybe
or
probably
we don't know the motives, I would not judge his friend so quickly
Considering you asked her, no. She was not the one who did it.
That's what I think
"if it's okay with you" is never an answer to breaking up. It's either a clear yes or no. The way she replied seemed like she did not really know what she wanted.
let them get sick and they need medical attention. then they will BEG for science
was surprising, really
I remember when I told my mother I'm an Atheist. She said: "okay."
holy hell. some people are just looking for reasons to get angry
My entire family never really gave a shit about religion, thankfully.
Damn. I never had to deal with racism in my family. That sounds like so much shit.
didn't he also turn into a horse to fuck a woman
he also had a cane that made noise
fun
I can't get a flu vaccine.
whoops
yep
<@137113218173632512> I did not give a shit when my father died. Still don't. Never cared for him.
It did not yet pass. They still have to vote again.
That's the main concern
Keep in mind, upload filters will NOT be required by law, but some sides may use them. And the issue is that those filters can and will be faulty.
And those who don't already remove their stuff
YouTube already acquired music rights and stuff, and video game companies encourage the sharing of gameplay footage
and no, YouTube and shit will not suffer from it.
The thing is, that it gives copyright holders more rights about their stuff. Now, if they actually want to use that right, is a different matter.
A13 states that website hosts are responsible for what their users upload, basically. And they have to keep an eye on it. That scares people because they assume those sites will now use upload filters and such. Either the website has to acquire the licenses for the stuff uploaded, or has to prevent the uploads.
yep. There it has to get a huge majority of votes, and if that does not happen, A13 has to be reworked and everything
oh, the irony
no, it was a misunderstanding, it seemed. *everyone* was shocked. The ones who posted the announcement, the guy himself.
yeah, that was my reaction too
seems like mods jumped the gun a bit on that one. Good to know he is fine, though
okay, what the frickeldifrack? We were all being sad about him, because of what happened and stuff. He posted a LOT of worrying stuff about him taking his life. We were talking about what happened, and slowly got back into the groove of posting normally, when all of the sudden **that guy we thought was dead posts: "tfw you're not dead."**
yeah, for real. I never talked to the guy, because I just joined the server a few days back, but it still hits hard.
holy shit. I just got a notification. a mod on a discord server took his life.
Good to hear you're okay, Hana
I don't know how I would deal with even the thought of *possibly* having HIV.
my immune system is ass
I get colds a lot
colds are ass
Nara, you mean the paragraph that states that you could only reissue a demand to change your legal status after three years if it did not come through the first time?
really? Let me check again
but like I said, I will read it in more detail later.
I just scanned through it, I did not find what the person in the post was talking about
I have to read up on it in detail in a few hours, after work.
<@!102691114762371072> I have not heard about that, no. This is news to me.

PBG is pretty good

I have to remember that. "algorithm bubble."
we have the algorithm, which keeps feeding you those videos
then, if we stay with the YouTube example

what do you mean by that?

second hand "knowledge", it looks like.

Also, considering it's the 4th of July, a *very* important day.
just most of the time
Hey, we are not always angry.
I'm still figuring that stuff out, by the way, that's why I said that I "might be."
While on the topic, even if it is a few hours old: I think I might be demi. Almost everything I read about it fits.
But then again, we can speculate about the motive as long as we want, that doesn't change anything about what happened.
Who knows?
Maybe something similar happened there.
One guy took people from Domino's hostage because he thought the Noid was created to make fun of him. His last name was Noid.
remember the Noid?
Hm. Now the question how true that is.
or was a pyromaniac
I want to link a wikipedia about our fkk, but I don't know if I can here, because of images in it. I'll put it in <#336297808221044736>
Ever seen our fkk beaches?
or even just equal to sex.
Because, for example, nudity=/= sexualized.
We have no problem with sex or nudity here.
why should that be offensive? Yes, you're right.
If by sex work, you mean prostitution: Here in Germany, it's legal, and a legit profession, with taxes, insurance, health care, and all that, and it works well. Well, as well as any other legal profession here.
that reminds me of a song
Jeffrey Epstein commited  suicide in jail
If it's about your mental wellbeing, being self centered is reasonable. You only have this one go.
if I can be bold:
sounds like an anxiety disorder, fig. Being concerned about stuff is one thing, but when it troubles you like this, it's unhealthy
no, no, I understand. That's one of the conflictions for me
I honestly am still conflicted. I will wait and see what will happen.
okay.
watch if you want, I mean
Watch the video. He addresses those things as well. I wait and see what will come out of it.
if all parties were fine with it, there is no harm done. I am still watching the video, though, haven't reached that part yet
That's the thing, apparently the people said they were adults
I am conflicted

Some girls? Maybe try and see what exactly it is that makes these girls so attractive to you. And maybe this is something you see more often in men. Now, I am not one to talk from personal experience, but I know a few bisexual people personally, and while they can be attracted to either, they still have a preference. Maybe that's the case for you too, dunkek.

some dumbshit videos to human lives?
are you comparing "copyright nazis" to actual nazis, fig??
don't hit back? What about self-defense?
They would have not done anything because "the community"
The only reason the reduced the ban, for example, was that potential and already paying costumers jumped off.
They are a business. It's about keeping money and making more, nothing else.
Owning any restricted or banned game, movie or music is completely legal, as the selling is the part the law refers to.
<@266379640069685252> okay, so, on the topic of games: games were restricted for excessive violence back then, which means an ban on advertisement and openly selling them on shelves. That's why there where "German" versions. Nowadays, since a law change in 2003, this restriction is almost never applied. We got games like GTA uncut, Mortal Kombat and all that. And yes, cery rarely games were actually banned. Manhunt for example. Banned, meaning: not allowed to be advertised, broadcasted or even sold in Germany.
it's all up there. read their conversation
<@!302063351767498752> I am only assuming here, so disregard me if I am completely wrong, but I reckon you feeling like a creep when feeling attracted to people you personally know may be two things: Your upbringing, I reckon nudity and sex was not something that was discussed in your family, which in turn leads to my second theory: that you may not know how to properly deal with the attraction, and how to talk about it, which creates fear that you may say something wrong, which in turn makes you think you are a pervert for liking someone. Which you are most definitely not.
my mom did that too, when I was a child. I hated that.
everyone is their own worst critic. Stop doing that, it's not healthy.
She gets paid for her voice acting. She has no involvement in creating the character, and as such, doesn't get any money from merch

go see some places
enjoy a walk.
You can be outside without spending
But not all the time
I like to do stuff every now and then, be it on weekends or any other day.
Aya, I'd advise you not to go that route
A person who prefers to be at home than to go out and stuff
basically this, yes
That's honestly not that many. More people die from the flu. Sure, people should keep an eye on it, but I don't think people should panic.
Oh, yeah, advanced stuff is wild, honestly
What music theory basically teaches you is the relation and function of notes and chords in a scale.
It's *not* a rule book, and should not be treated as such.
and yes, Melua, what you said is absolutely right. Music theory is not needed, it just helps and tells you: "Okay, this is what usually works."
I didn't have that pitch memorize stuff in school
My own fault, honestly
didn't learn shit, though
I did, too.
you are not born with it
It's practice
sure, but that's practice
if you needed an ear for pitch to compose, we hardly had any composers.
Especially since you are learning the english terms for it. The German ones are a pain. Terz? None? Quinte?
<@!302063351767498752> Intervals are easy peasy. just look at a keyboard of a piano and count the steps. You do a wholestep? a second. You do a halfstep? Minor second. You do four half steps? Major third. Three halfsteps? Minor third, or Major second depending on what your "standard interval" is. It's like learning how to read: practice, practice, practice.
<@!272035441312530434> you are right, music theory is about intervals.
That's conditioning by the government
> In current year they're horribly archaic and undemocratic
<@357594748023734273> so, like entire constitution of the US.
I still find it wrong that, if you are attracted in any form (not even sexually, just thinking they are adorable of something) to a person below the age of 18, you are labeled a pedophile, even if, by pure definition, pedophilia is the *sexual* attraction to *prepubescent* people. Hell, finding teenagers attractive is actually the most normal thing in the world. It's society that labels it as wrong. Mostly in the US, it seems. In Europe, the age of consent is way lower than in the US, in Germany for example it's 14. As such, sexual attraction to teens is not considered "wrong" here. It doesn't mean people turn into predators or anything.

And then again, Megumin is a drawing. And she is just plain adorbs.
Yep
Weinstein got 23 years
and talent does not exist, it all comes down to practice and training
the issue you have is one many people have: they look at musicians and only see who they are now, not that they went through the same shit as you and me.
just focus on your current state of knowledge.
pop bands don't do it, composers don't do it, I don't do it.
don't beat yourself up over the fact that you can't create new stuff. Almost no musician does it.
The whole reason music theory exists is to show us that usually works, so, point A to B
> because music is about trying new things and experimenting and I just go from point A to point B
<@!302063351767498752> 
no. trying new things and experimenting is something for people with a lot more experience than you and I
oh, they are massive assholes.
laws exist for a reason
"You can say anything you want" is absolutely wrong, by the way
they shouldn't, maybe, but they do care
oh, you have no idea how the real world works
moving to a new country is not as easy as changing your haircut. There is a LOT you have to consider
Not trying to discourage you to go there, I am just saying that you should be careful. And "just because" is not a good reason to move, in my opinion.
Did you know that the Japanese embassy in France has to fly Japanese tourists back home regularly because they get a culture shock, because France is not that amazing thing Japanese TV and such make it out to be?
Your mindset is a guaranteed way to get a culture shock
> Just because, everything I hear about it is splendid.
<@!266379640069685252> Yes, because people only talk about the good things. Norway has a lot of stuff wrong with it, too. Simply because it's a country with people in it. I could tell you a hundred things that are great in Germany, for example, but a thousand that are just shit.
sure, but I believe the law explicitly states the president
also, isn't it illegal in the US to demand the president to be killed in any form?
criticism itself is also freedom of speech.
amen!
oh, sure, freedom of speech has its limitations
Isn't freedom of speech simply protecting you from the government, not other people? As in, the government can't shut you up, but other people can.
but yeah, finding counter arguments can be rather tricky, if basically everyone around you is screaming one thing only.
still a lot to learn
also, you are still young, anyhow.
Ah, okay. That makes sense, actually.
watch, when 2021 comes we will realize 2020 was just a midboss
interesting how stuff can differ
I had one with 14.
well then
https://www.pcgamer.com/the-witcher-3-director-has-left-cd-projekt-red-after-workplace-bullying-investigation/
hell yes
that guy tried to act like he was crazy and shit
it doesn't matter if it can't be equated, you cannot equate one human life with another. I am just saying, don't fucking do that. It's wrong either way
that's what I meant
yes
no, I just don't really like shit like that.
as in, not yet equal
not yet
I am just saying, it started somewhere.
I know
and sexists exist, and they acted. I am just saying, posting a meme "as a joke" about extinction of a gender and ethnic group as the same drive as the woman in the video making fun of native americans and calling it a "joke"
yes
it's easier than you think
if you think that
can't happen, okay.
The issue is not him not being serious, I know he wasn't. I am just saying that stuff like that can cause attracting the wrong croud.
give shit like that time, and it will turn into a majority. you know about the saying that when people try to act dumb they will attract the attention of actually dumb people because they think they are in good company?
I don't know, posting a pic that calls for the extinction of one ethnic group and gender is racist and sexist. Reminds me of the Nazis back then.
I don't, because one dumbfuck is not the measure for all. There are a lot of fine people no matter their skin color and believes, as much as there are assholes, no matter their skin color and believe, and you agreeing with what <@!84811738653929472> posted makes you a racist too.
hm, I don't really think I can get my point across in a way that would not cause an argument again. not because you wouldn't understand it, but because I feel I could not word it correctly
I also admit that I am especially sensitive when it comes to jokes about women
again, maybe I overreacted, and for that I apologize
the first thing I really thought was: Oh, that is trouble
not really that, honestly, I must say. I was just raised that way. Maybe my parents had that in mind when they did it, but while yes, I brought them up, it was not my first thought.
I guess it was a point made from a different perspective. I was talking in general, they were arguing the US without neither of us making that clear, really
not really. I was talking in general
my argument was just that I don't like jokes like that in general
in America maybe
exactly
not yet. that's my entire point
like I said, enable it, and it happens
you are blind if you don't think it exists
there is
and there is black surpremacy, asian surpremacy.
yeah, that's what I meant. making light of it is what enables it, you know. I am just saying, don't do jokes like that in general
So, after I read your comments, I understand where you are coming from, and I didn't want to make you angry. My point was simply, that any form of racism is not okay, no matter the target.
and what makes you think I don't do that already?
Also, don't know how I can say that so it comes across correctly, but I really fucking hate any implied violence against women, even as a joke. I've been with women who suffered greatly from stuff like that. Call me overly sensitive, but this is one thing to tick me off. Maybe I overreacted, but god, do I hate it.
Lily make a good point.
the thing is, no hate is impossible, unless you control people dictatorship style
if everyone is dead, no one can be mean <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
my mother told me something like that when it happened to me back in elementary school. "ignore them". Doesn't work. It makes you seem spineless. The only thing they understand is fighting back. not necessarily physically, just engage and counter.
for me the choice is not using any of those cloud services
like I said, I get it. I just don't trust them one bit
and I really don't, no
reminds me of that guy who lost everything because Google banned him for some reason. Everything was gone
never did
I just don't trust Google
email
sure, convenience, I get that.
Why use at all, really? That's what I don't understand
Maybe it's the German in me speaking, but no way in hell will I willingly upload any documents to a google drive
who the fuck uses Google Drive in the first place? The agreement gives Google access to everything you put there.
oh wow
In Germany, we get told from day one: Don't trust corporations, especially big ones, and don't trust the government. I guess that's where it comes from. Part of our history with the DDR/GDR and Nazi Germany and stuff, I guess.
again, like I said, maybe that's the German in me. Because I have yet to learn of one company here that uses cloud services outside their own internal ones.
It's just my personal preferences
this is legit good advice. Not having friends irl you can do stuff with must be hard, but having fake friends because you forced yourself to do something you don't really enjoy just to have some company is even worse.
I love the winter
but hey, each their own
I like the dark
damn
what is that character development?
This is actually NOT what free speech is. Twitter is privately owned, that means NO ONE can say what they want and get away with it. Freedom of speech means you can criticise the government and the government can't shut you up, nothing more.
should, but it doesn't. that's the point here.
those are pulled from a database of million books, actually. wouldn't be surprised if there are even worse words there
It's so weird how they can just do that in America. It's disgusting.
Considering how big twitter is in Japan, Mel's assumption is probably more reasonable than Nintendo telling him to delete his account. That would be like your boss telling you to not use your phone at home.
Isn't it illegal in the US to take pictures of you voting and stuff?
maybe something like anime cinema or something?
Alice just woke up
What else should it be called? Anime watch sounds like a prevention squad
I should really make it a habbit to read the channel desc in the pinned comments. It's all right there.
uh, I did not know that, that sounds actually really neat.
oh, so like a movie night?
what's with K-On? New show? Concert?
Or maybe you are just easier to please. It's not a bad thing
honestly, I watch very little anime. The ones I watched in the last few years you could count on two hands
okay
the one with those weird gem people or whatever?
what show?
Chris x Spaghett, never forget
the other main girl practically forces herself on the mc.
it's weird
it has
Just playing
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
if you want gay, how about Valkyrie Drive Mermaid? It's yuri porn
not me, I wanna go to bed at least one day on time
She really played it for hours
those timezones are going to be the death of me
oh, nice
which episode are you on?
They keep the englishmen around for a reason.
Make Scotland great again!
Ye tyrants!
I knew the entire premise of Madoka without going to subreddits simply by browsing different websites. It's sometimes unavoidable
But this person must have the time of their life watching it now
yeah, I read about that.
Is Hellsing Ultimate on the agenda some time?
oh, right.
I like it, but prefer railgun
yes, I know
My Firefox eats 2,5 GB with 24 tabs open
why does that look like trouble?
It was extremely catchy, but so confusing, I just had to check the show out.
I don't remember when I started, but I know that GX was in full swing back then. I got in contact with the show through Funnyjunk, as a user used the Beef Stroganoff scene in a comment.
that's moe

I don't like that overly cute moe style
I never got into Girls Und Panzer. Tried it, but it's not for me.
as in "to move forwards"
Panzer for means "tank, advance". just in case you were curious.
did the same thing
Well, I'll figure it out eventually
I even create a new layer with a solid color to see if I missed something
the weird part is, that I don't see the green borders on photoshop, only on the rendered pic
when you say invert, you mean the selection, right?
guess I'll try that, thanks
this green border, I tell you
still needs some work
first draft, like I said
thank you
first draft
oh, that's good stuff
those chans are strange
maybe i fucked something up
I love P5. It's one of my favorite games of all time
The Persona 5 anime is not even that good
He fights Finé and doesn't afraid of anything
haha oops
I remember when PreCure had "regular" ending sequences
PreCure has some pretty ugly episodes, don't deny it. And those CGI ending sequences...
I would not be surprised if that was indeed the case, Sketch
Me whenever I peek into the anime-club channel
wait, are we talking Dokidoki in here?
apparently, january 29th is the date for it in Germany
I'll see it sometime down the road
I tell you, Twinkle Nora Rock Me will be a laugh
the soundtrack on vinyl playing along
of course
We should watch Twinkle Nora Rock Me.
too much ugu
I tried two episodes of Girls und Panzer. I did not like the extreme "cute girl" stuff.
PS&G's dub is great. Hilarious stuff.
okay, how can someone fuck up a pronunciation so badly? I don't even watch that show and I know how to say it.
still, she does it.
Also, Nanoha can't befriend without shooting the shit out of people.
because it's scifi Magical Girl. Nanoha is basically a battle mecha.
the visuals remind me of Zone Of The Enders 2
but considering I watched over 500 episodes of PreCure, I am accustomed to it.
a spin on the monster of the week mechanic. Again, I had no issue with it.
Also had no issues with the characters
I quite enjoyed the show.
that's why the anime was made in the first place
it was successful before
yep
now you sound like an elitist
nope
oh, yes. good example
did you really ask that?
happens everywhere
have you maybe, just *maybe*, considered, that animation costs money and takes time, both are not endless? So, of course some corners need to be cut sometimes.
also
that explains it, really.
so, you knew they'd mess up? So, your opinion was already formed before you watched the show.
also, what other people say you should use as maybe guidelines, to form your own opinion, not as facts
you compare what you expect to what you got
no
Don't deny people success or make them look stupid because of what they like, simply because you don't like this thing.
"low quality" is just your opinion
I didn't watch it yet, I have no opinion.
you don't have to
they still like it
so?
because people enjoy accelerator, maybe?
"who was at fault?"
why are we even pointing fingers?
oh, boy
but you kept bringing stuff up to prove a point that never was one
I know it was pointless, I wanted to drop it two times.
oh, yeah, that's true
deadlines are not set by the animation studio
this, basically, Millhi
and bitching about how people are dumb for watching it, don't forget that.
you know, I actually wanted to drop that discussion. But you just can't let it go.
I am having a blast here. The stuff that guy writes...
oh, here it comes.
different moods
different scenes, different lighting.
I know, right?
Let me quote you: If you say so.
that's just the most nitpicky shit I have ever seen, sorry.
wow, no fucking difference
yep
and that's the elitist crap I mentioned before
Anyway, I guess I'll leave it at that.
somehow, with how you argued up until now, I doubt that a bit, but okay.
again, you are so focused on your animation quality and sound that you lose any appreciation for the reason *why* those shows were made.
that's pretty much the idea behind the entire thing.
one punch man is an average anime
A friend of mine is like that with movies. Buys stuff that looks and sounds interesting just because. I could never do that.
I also don't buy shows or movies I never watched
I would never buy shows I am not 100% convinced of.
or BluRay, rather
I own a few shows on DVD, but Black Lagoon is the only anime.
Nothing like that with me, really
in fact, I hardly watch any
A show has to really interest me for me to spend any money on it. Doesn't matter if it's anime or not.
Want to get Hellsing Ultimate sometime
I own the entirety of Black Lagoon. That's the only anime show I own.
you mean a one-take
I love how it just throws everything conventional out of the window
Inferno Cop is one of my favorite shows.
Know that one
but 99% of the time, I look in this channel and think: no.
sometimes, you find the very rare gem, that really stands out.
I only watch gear.
And in fact, I don't
it has to appeal to me visually if I have to look at it
because visuals are a big element in animation
that's all that matters
it's expected
every magical girl show is gay nowadays.
It's basically Madoka viewed through Akame Ga Kill glasses
there is nothing making it stand out
that scene looks exactly how I expected a show with that style to look
I think it does.
and when it looks really crazy and stylized, even better.
I love weird, corny stuff
corny can be good
I just think it looks like every other generic kawaii anime, I find.
Nobunagun has interesting visuals, the other one looks really generic.
and never heard of that one you mentioned
I don't compare Nanoha and Gear, honestly.
guys can like butt stuff too
people survived with broken necks for weeks, even years
I love Hellsing Ultimate
This Kyousou Giga also does looks good. I love those overexaggerations in the movements and streches
I know Redline
One element I love is when characters are intentionally drawn "ugly".
Oh, that does indeed look interesting
I love Teekyuu. It's absolutely unhinged
<@238855496797257729> I heard about that one. Pics look interesting
Ghost Stories is great
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jun/16/health.society
I don't know how the intro cutscene is in the PS2 remake, but in the PS1 version of Wild ARMs 1  the music in it was incredibly beautiful.
damn
where does it say that?
XV for me
Indeed
Aren't anime just cartoons? <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
really? No, it has a manga.
I read the manga a bit. interesting that this got an anime
but yeah, it's not a good entry point
I liked Hacha.
Nagisa and Honoka are the best. Good old fisticuffs
that's what makes Saitama so special: He just trained like mad
I think they do
Don't worry, Nanoha will wait for you.
<@!476058996315389953> okay, the hair of the one on the left looks wild. Those colors are great
A Crétin Magical Fuckup
he also voiced Kiriya-sensei from Senran Kagura
One of the reasons Diana is my fav
May I just real quick: We need a new Nanoha season.
I meant the ping
WHAT
Looking forward to the rest of Railgun T
probably my second favorite anime character overall
Started Railgun T. Watched the first episode. Misaka is still an amazing character

I already really liked Index, Index II, Index III, and absolutely loved Railgun and Railgun S.
Kinda back in the swing of it. So good
I could go with a new Nanoha season
shame on you
you could for a few days now
I just watched the first episode of the OVA Angel Cop. Cool shit. I love the anime art style of the 80's.
I watched all up to 13, I think
Just watched the first episode of The Owl House. Fun. I think I will enjoy the show
I can understand it, honestly. A show that ran for years, with every season having some more or less yuribait subplot or little scenes, and the one time they actually kinda commit it's a straight pairing. It also came directly after Doki Doki, which dialed the gayness up quite a bit.
unless it's with their PreCure partner, it seems
that, if I remember correctly, doesn't go anywhere, really
It's often called HapCha Precure in short, or, mockingly, HetCha Precure, as it has a straight romance subplot.
yep. I enjoyed it
it has one of my favorite songs in the entire franchise
I liked it too
I liked Doki Doki a lot. One of my favorite seasons
Doki Doki was a good start. Go full force!
PreCure with actual full on Yuri?
how about a PreCure season where the family knows from the beginning that they are precures?
Battle Royal PreCure!
nothing worse than having a favorite and they hardly do stuff
honestly, I prefer having fewer Cures a season, but giving each enough screen time and development
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTZgJgloo40
that's where I found out about her
on stage, the perfect idol, off stage, just anger
that would be amazing
I'll deck ye cunts!
nah, make it your trade
Ye shite bastard!
Scottish idol
I guess I must check it out
Apparently, Keke's VA speaks Japanese with a dialect, which the Japanese fans really like
still nice
on the big screen even

she is the best
How is Maho so adorable?
okay, I watched 10 episodes now, and D4DJ is like the cutest and at the same time coolest shit ever, man.
also, Angel Cop is very fucking anti-semitic in its original version
I like that old artwork style
oh, I saw that on the official channel, I think
I mean, the show has yuri undertones in such a way that you can interpret different dynamics in there. It's a form of idol anime, after all
could be
sure, she does, but it doesn't feel like a harem to me
nice interactions
also, yeah, that sleepover episode was cute
I never saw Rinku as the "harem mistress", for me the dynamic was clearly Rinku x Maho. Sure, she is basically the group leader, but it didn't feel like the others joined because they like Rinku so much.
I like that
so there is a reason for them to form a group
composer, hypeman, VJ, mixer
that is true. I also like how every girl, especially of the main cast Happy Around, every girl has their job besides singing.
for me
absolutely. Maho best girl
the original composer actually worked on the remix for D4DJ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzcm_awsZeQ
ever heard the original? That ED is a cover of a song from 1995. sounds very different, but very good
that's light music
funny you mention that, Lily. I just wondered if we ever get an anime with cute girls doing metal. With all the female metal bands Japan has currently
good
sure, some stuff is very complicated and in-depth, but that is stuff you wouldn't really need for composing
music theory is easier than one would think. you just need the right teacher
I thought you meant DAWs as well
I see
yeah
this
text you about music?
knowing music can help tremendously with your goals
and yeah, that show always reminds me of the fact that I absolutely suck at mixing
Nice to hear you liked it. It gets better the further you watch
oh, right, that was a thing
can you imagine??? They show up and play this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26aMuahxz8c
you know, just cute girls forming a band like Nemophila or something
yeah, but that's not the focus
power metal, focused on it
oh, that is cool!
It looks interesting

I also wrote a song that entirely syncoped (is that a word?). It uses Syncopation. When the drums come in it feels like the song jumps backwards
that was on purpose, don't worry. I love stuff like that.
yeah, most of my tunes are simple. I focus on a basic concept most of the time

yeah
I can sing high, like, very high, but those notes are somewhere between chest and head voice.
I can sing the entire thing, with the exception of the high notes in the corus.
How about Hymn by Ultravox, ibu? That's an amazing song
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>

That's Mic Commander
FLIGHT FEATHERS is my fav Basa song, honestly

How about a little spice and sing You by Bad Religion
do they have to be from anime?

ambiguous is absolutely an amazing song, agreed.
Ryuji is hella bro!

It's the best JRPG of all time. Of course it is.

This song is beautiful, but extremely heavy if you understand German.

little hint: don't turn the song up too much

Aw, shame
Just something that came to mind, as you wrote in swedish the other day when you called me Sauerkraut
swedish!
<@!263983345669505025> I think you will enjoy this goofy song. It's by an Austrian band called EAV, or Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung.
thanks, Cypher
<@209896097026408449> I use FL Studio
A song I composed back in 2009
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51q_tK3j8tY
Weird, but good.

True, Scrmz. Very true.
But yeah, why is that? Everybody knows at least one Weezer song, it seems, but no one knows Weezer.
Many bands lost their heart when that happened.
I mean, better than them being too mainstream.
As soon as I started "Say It Ain't So" and heard the first few notes, I knew I heard that song a lot back in the day.
I know all of those songs beside Undone - Sweater Song. Damn, I never knew it was Weezer all along.
WAIT! I know Buddy Holly! That song played a lot in radio back in the day.
You know, Saki, I have to admit that I never really had weezer on my radar until they covered Africa, so I could not answer that question, sorry.
Are you ready for the swing of your lifetime? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbQgXeY_zi4
Oh, enjoy your dinner, Scrmz.
Better do what she says, that sounded like an order.
Starting over is great too. About addiction. Very nice
And We Danced is good. I like the lyrics.
I'll check those songs out, Saki.
Jimmy is not about subtlety. I mean, MSI have songs called "Stalkers (slit my wrist)" and "faggot". The first one dealing with the pressure of being famous and in the eye of the public 24/7, and the later about the discrimination of homosexual and bisexual people. As Jimmy being bi himself, I bet he experienced a lot of that.
Jimmy, the composer and singer, I mean
I love how completely in your face he is with his stuff. Goofy stuff, social commentary...
Amen
How about this one, one of my absolute favorite tracks of my favorite band: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhPpCSToKtY

It's not important how long you listen to it, only that at a specific age you will stop looking for other types of music

Oh, you wrote watching.
My favorite album is We're Only In It For The Money by Frank Zappa And The Mothers Of Invention.
A track I made a few years back.
There is also this one, an older one. I wanted to reinterpret it for a while now. With better samples and stuff.
<@290431224596660224>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDcWhhC7Jaw
<@!102691114762371072> Here is your blast from the past.
Another, very good track by the German punk band Die Ärzte. I can write a translation if needed.
Yeah, I figured
<@!176830925949108224> That's the verse I meant. I don't know how legit it sounds, as I don't understand a single word he is saying.
I can one-up you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJy8bycfAK8
the ban is lifted nowadays and the song is "legal", so to speak
Here is another one by them. This song was actually put on the "index" for 25 years for being "harmful to minors". That meant the song could never be played in radio or TV, the LP could only be sold to adults and could not be advertised or sold "over the counter".  If the band played it live (which they did a lot of times), they needed to make sure all people present are at least 18 (they did not).
I missed that part
I made a tiny mistake, the second chorus changes the line "Who could anticipate her reacting like that?" to "you could say I am a bit confused".
<@290431224596660224> Here it is.
I'll translate line for line
Alright, give a few
By the way, the lyrics are hilarious. Ask for translation
How about a song by the most successful German punk band?
I think my fav would be Daidouji's theme from Estival Versus, the game's title theme, or the theme of PBS. Depends on the mood
Senran Kagura has very good music in general, I must say.
One of the most successful german musical acts is a punk band
I'd say yes, as punk is more about a state of mind than anything.
At the time the song came out, Germany was hugely in the Neue Deutsche Welle and New Wave, and punk rock was pretty much boycotted back then and not "mainstream", as it is now.
I know "I love Rock'n'Roll" by her, but that's it.
Yep, never heard it before
Joel from Vinesauce tries his hands on German techno.
Oh, I know that song, I believe

all written by him
That guy is weird, trust me. He is also part of a very famous and successful German punk band called "Die Ärzte". They have songs about eating people, about a woman having sex with her dog, and incest.
basically, he sings about how he wants to be treated like a pet, crawling behind her, wants to get kicked and stuff, and how much he loves her for doing it.
it's S/M music.
not really
With the exception that Sonic music usually isn't about wanting to get beaten up by their lover and bleeding like a pig
<@!246146781832806401> Found the song I was talking about. It's hidden as track 0 on the artist's second album.
banger alert
One of my favorite songs ever. It's in German, but I can give a translation if wanted.
masterpiece https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynQsDFxTSU4
One of my favorite songs by the EAV, an Austrian band. I can make a translation of the lyrics if wanted, but let me warn you that the song is heavy. The first verse alone will probably make you gasp in shock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKe_mok2gOQ
that sounds actually pretty good

good song
good night
here it is
I have the official mp3 even. bought it a few months ago

Do you know "Brotherman Bill" by Terrible Tim?
Tally Hall are amazing. They should come back from hiatus. Now that the internet knows about them, their music would be very successful
<@!176830925949108224> this one
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
You peeps up for some hyper german music?
I just mentioned you because of the title
It's a pretty silly hymn to Sweden. As you can probably tell by the style alone, it's totally off the mark
<@!263983345669505025>
the music video actually has a censored version for broadcasting before 10pm. The censorship is hilarious, typical for the band
The game was very fun, I found
that's a rigging problem.
That was a bug in version 1.0 with old graphics drivers
The Scarface game? I own it.
so they say
I only know snippets of it, never watched the movie fully. My sister loves it.
I came in contact with the song through GTA3 back then
I love LEVEL 5 Judgelight. The pressure in the chorus is amazing. I love the syncopation of it.
you could unlock it in game.
god, that's so mad old
I like the composition more in Day Of Fate. The song "Alexander Anderson" is well done. The orchestral sound is captured really well.
it's the scene where Gohan finally snaps and unleashes his full power in DBZ, shortly after Cell crushes the head of C16. You know, the scene I mentioned yesterday
better
also okay.
i'm not a fan of that kind of music.
oh, okay, that one
btw, if anyone wants a translation, I can write one, but keep in mind that it's really not as fun as the song sounds
This song is *dark*. Like, really, *really dark*.

hey, they are great songs, and were hits for a reason
Tallyhall are really great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yModCU1OVHY
Probably one of the best title themes I have ever heard
I have the mp3 of that song. Amazing stuff
Not my thing. I find this constant monotonous synth really grading, sorry. If they removed that and swapped it out with a less dominant sound, or maybe mixed it down more, I bet it would appeal to me more. I also don't like the singing. Not the voice, but the melody that's sung. I assume the song is purposefully dissonant. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, but in this song is not enough variation to make this dissonance work, I find.
doesn't mean they're bad, though.
Pink Floyd never did it for me. But I am not a prog rock/classic rock guy, anyway.
Perfect Girl is a banger
She has a lot of good songs, I find
This song is one of few where I prefer the cover version (the Kim Wilde one) over the original (by the Surpremes)
oh, nice, Kim Wilde
thanks!
okay
I was so confused.
<@!302063351767498752> Uploaded a new track
https://soundcloud.com/outside998/calling
the melody is based on tritones, and at one part the song uses a polyrhythm
it uses 3/4, 4/4, 2/4 and 6/4
The song also changes time signatures a lot. I wanted the song to disorientate, in a way.
Thanks for your feedback, though.
It was a rhythm guitar with a lot of phazer effects on it. I wanted a really gruffy and sinister sound.
oh, thanks
huh?

It being sparse was the point of the song. and I tend to stay away from reverb. I really don't like the sound.

by the way, I finished another that is not yet released, as it's not in the game yet. do you want to listen to it?
She is shy
The "guitar", pianos and violins, then.
it's the sound I wanted
I think it sounds fine.
odd, though, never had that with any of my other songs

it seems like soundcloud put a limiter over it
the distortion is weird, though, seems like a soundcloud issue.
thanks.

yep, seems she liked my music
Wow, thanks, Shirabe...
https://soundcloud.com/outside998/number-2
I don't like the whole "wall of sound" and "loudness war" shebang
If so, that's because the song is in minor, movement has to be careful in the chords, otherwise it sounds like major
Unless you mean the chord progression.
It's how I always did things, honestly.
I don't want a "full" sound. I want melody first and foremost.

PADORU
Yep
Like this. As you can see, many songs from the soundtrack are in there. Some aren't even uploaded yet.
The cover art is chosen after the "album" I compile the songs in.
Not for the game
No, Nightmares is just a song I wrote for me.
the players help us with bugfixes, give us ideas and all that
community
We, the dev team, also have a discord server.
yep. Trust me on that one.
Research Into Affection. *VERY* not safe for work.
Most of the songs for the game are character themes. The game itself is a visual novel.
"Zoe" is one of the game tracks
the ones tagged with soundtrack are for a video game.
I don't recommend those.
yeah, old stuff. Very old
my soundcloud has a few more songs, if you want to check them out.

<@!203444794737950720> 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yModCU1OVHY
that works too
It's not important what you use, but how you use it
or a little midi keyboard
get a guitar, learn a few chords and record them with a little mic
oh, you can
paper and pencil also cost money.
you know that an actual instrument often costs more? Many people play because they like to play.
you never know if you don't try
if you turn your hobby into your job, you'll never work a day in your life.
I make money with it.
well, then turn it from a hobby to a job.
now, if you just want to start really quickly, try MAGIX Music Maker. It's cheap and easy to use. around 80€.
there are different versions, though, in different price ranges
the version of FL Studio I have cost 800 buckeroos
makes sense
the trickiest part about music software is honestly getting started and finding your way around them
<@!203444794737950720>
Maybe check some retail stores if you find something there, or amazon
and expensive.
Honestly, they are all rather complex, and highly dependent on vst, virtual instruments.
oh, that's a tough question. I use FL Studio.
<@!237964037898502144> thank you
yeah, soundcloud does that shit sometimes

probably the soundcloud compression again
I don't hear what you mean, honestly
what key?
in what way?
the focus here was completely on the call and response main melody.
<@!302063351767498752> maybe you want to give it a listen? Some modal mixture in this one, like picardy thirds and minor plagal cadences.
Uploaded a new song I wrote for a video game:
https://soundcloud.com/outside998/mother-and-daughter
I still have the mp3 of that song
You have to hit the mood and the character.
the issue with writing music for a game or similar is that often you cannot do what you want.
thank you
I get what you mean. I didn't do it because I wanted to kind of give the music this floaty feel, as it fits the character. This lost kind of feeling.
It's a tune for the game, so it's quite calm.
In case you want to give it a listen:
I am curious what you will turn this little demo into
I happen to have finished a song myself just today.
anytime
<@!302063351767498752>
it has potential
Keep going
simple, repetitive note sequence, easy to expand.
not bad. simple, but catchy. the triplets the bass drum plays breaks the song down quite a bit. could be used for a nice drop. I like it.
oh, it is, absolutely. Carry Me Off is great as well, check it out
Carry Me Off was also planned to be used, but ended up being cut. I have the song on my PC
Nice. Conor from Conor & Jay works on the soundtrack for GTA. This song was used in GTA3 on Head Radio.
Only uncultured swines don't know Crazy Taxi
Can't listen to the video right now, I am at work, but will later
But in the end, it depends on what sound you want.
For bass, I would say a fast attack with slow release in 1:4 or higher sounds nice. For the kick drum, use a slower attack with fast release, and try around with the ratio.
What settings?
Do you use compression?
Do you have bass and kick drum on seperate channels?
Just "sounds off" doesn't give me anything
Is it peaking? Too flat? Too wet? Too dry?
<@302063351767498752> what is "off" to you? Where do you want to go with it? I can't look into your head. Talk to me.

It took me two days to finish GTA3 on PS4 100%
I still know the positions of all 100 packages in GTA3.
yeah. GTA3 is set in 2001, and the only 3D title to be set in the same year the game was released.
but hey, at least for PC we have custom radio stations
yeah, sadly
GTA3 had that classical music because of that cartoony, stereotypical mafia image
well, I guess there are some more factors in it. For one, the music is licensed, and Rockstar wants to sell the soundtrack. That works best with mainstream songs. also, a mainstream soundtrack in a game adds to its mainstream appeal
sadly they don't do that anymore
amazing stuff
yeah, from pop, to reggae, over hip hop to classical.
GTA needs more classical
Oh, funnily enough, Rise was one of my least favorite stations, next to msx. I loved listening to Head Radio, Flashback or Double Clef FM

yeah, it's basically the unofficial theme for the PS1 and PS2 GTAs
Rockstar actually used it more than twice, besides the uses in GTA1 and on Lips 106 in GTA3. The riff is used in the Rockstar north logo for GTA Vice City, the pager in 3 uses it, GTA4 has the option of setting your ringtone to the riff of the song, it plays in the background of a radio add in GTA2.

growling is not something I really enjoy, honestly.
also, of course, this song is about drinking beer

Have you heard of Equilibrium? German Metal band. They use German Schlager (folk music) in their compositions, like this one:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzVlBHMb2Tk
okay, that's a mix. wow
synths are usually not that present in their songs, though.
Aldious are amazing. I have four albums of theirs
the first thing that came to my mind hearing that synth/guitar fusion was Show Down by Aldious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS9gWmp6e_E

<@!171395487247630336> <@!87512939107450880> there we go, now it's complete. Translation of the song I posted earlier
sorry, give me a second
it's really good
disregard the ping
missed a part
sorry, made a mistake
I loved it. It's a banger
obviously, with how Italian is structured, it would be almost impossible, I figure
fuck me, the synths. Nice!
sure, hit me with it
it's a banger. I could write a translation, if wanted
I think I have the mp3 somewhere
The song is about alcoholism
<@!87512939107450880>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBAeq0EyD9A
you wanna hear what was playing on German radio in 84?
he also wrote Stranger In Moscow for Michael Jackson, which is why that song sounds similar, too
the guy who wrote ice cap zone wrote the song Hard Times
in that case, it was the same guy
oh, possible.
yeah, that happens sometimes, sadly. I can't imagine how many songs are still on the cutting room floor
oh, nice
if that song sounds familiar, the composer of that song used it as the basis for Ice Cap Zone in Sonic 3
unreleased for years, but still 80s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9sdsclDwas
but sounds great
never heard that song
nice!
from 83
Neue Deutsche Welle had some great songs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlxrXK_moCc
(Some maybe know it from the Joel Vinesauce Schnappimeme)
<@!87512939107450880>Another song Herbert Grönemeyer, the same guy who did the song Alkohol:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSPbWaT-XmA
of course, that is a classic
I just never heard that song or name
it's good
never heard that one. Don't even know Den Harrow
that just means you're passionate
he really did everything, it seems
nice
hm
But I am not sure myself
I think it was "the light"
so, all songs in GTA3 on Flashback FM are written by Moroder, the lyrics were not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CW-J71mJUI
no?
Every song on Flashback FM in 3 is from Scarface
was it any different in GTA 3?
such a great song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfkJT0rra-8
I like that one. Very nice
never heard that song. pretty good
Oh, great song! Pet Shop Boys have some amazing stuff. Gotta listen to it when I'm home
by the way, the lyrics to that song are wild. Absolutely dark humor
I figured, I just mentioned it because that's what we mostly share
I see
<@!237964037898502144> do you know this song? <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
<@!87512939107450880> Not synthwave or such, but I thought I'd share one of my favorite songs of my favorite German band. Punk rock!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaTNLPSXgKk
I remember you showed me that before, mentioning that.
the bassline is mint
that is a jam, indeed. they have some really great songs
but I thought you might like it
a lot heavier than what we usually share
<@!87512939107450880> 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26aMuahxz8c
wait what the fuck? Biz Markie is dead?
okay, that drum solo at 2:07, goddamn!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHpuEqMAcDg
very nice
I only know final countdown by them
very good
I figured, from the flag you posted
wow
oh that's good
it's amazing
hell yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26aMuahxz8c
I didn't want to say I like pure rock, because that would sound like the genre mixes spoil it or something, which they don't.
if that makes sense
yeah, heard of them. not my thing. I guess I just like it more... don't know how to put it, not pure, but more straight rock, I guess?
ever seen Band-Maid? they have some bangers, and live they are wild. An example, with amazing drum solo:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHpuEqMAcDg
no no, I just meant like all experiments, which Babymetal pretty much was at foundation, it can succeed or fail. they succeeded more than they failed, but they did both. I mean, there must be something to them, after all they are the first Japanese act since the 60s to chart in America
like all experiments, really
they are not really my scene. they have a few tracks I like, but they don't hit it for me
Babymetal? for real? that's unexpected.
oh?
the singer sadly had to leave the band because of depression. really bad
ah, nice. I should really write down which I have shown you already
<@!87512939107450880> have I ever shown you this song from my favorite Japanese band? The synths, man!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS9gWmp6e_E
Really nice. I know maybe two songs by Judas Priest. This one is good. I dig the riff after the intro
Will listen to it after work
That's an amazing song. Reminds me of Saints Row 2, the song was on the radio there.
Gave it a listen just now. That is a banger of a tune. I need to get myself some of those synthesizers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEQr-SMo3h4
not every track can be a winner
hm, don't know, doesn't hit me as well as other tracks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEe_yIbW64w
that's also a great one
you wanna hear a song that is considered "harmful to minors" in Germany?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH9R2jxijOc
German punk rock!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRtuPB5p7nQ
it'll be a challenge
not accurate in the slightest. but that would be really fucking hard to do in CGI
oh, that's really nice
Live gigs like this one is why I love the band. They can make fucking up their own songs so entertaining
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B85H84DBG8w
that little variation is just bless
oh, I love the little eighth pause at 2:31
oh, Love Colored Master Spark is such a beautiful composition
a goddamn classic
oh, and this one, good god, when I heard it the first time I got goose bumps:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlPnZ2T4fA4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWy8GnDelu4
nice arrangement
well, she is the oldest being
Yukari goes "ouch, my hip"
right? it's amazing
so graceful
this one is one of my favorites:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9wtoIaTHBQ
I know, but based on his music
ZUN knows how to write music
oh that's nice
that song is very good. Did you know the band hated it?
I have the full version with reprise.
it blew me away as a kid already
the chorus, those synths, are magical. I need to look up the notes for that
hell yes!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v74kHajcus
I can't do that. I feel covers are uninteresting and even lazy. That's just my opinion, though
I feel more often than not they completely butcher the original's intent
I am really not a fan of covers. Never was.
I love this song so much. reminds me of my childhood
one of my all time favs is this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9zUBNikp3U
yeah, I like the song quite a bit
yeah, has two versions, french, the original, and an english version for international release. Interestingly, in Germany, the French version was the bigger hit
oh, Kylie has some bangers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfCvX2pJsps
it reminds of another song from the 80s I cannot name. It's a vague memory of a tune.
that was really good
you know, I like the chord progression, because the cadence throws me for a loop every single time. I always expect it to go different, with the fifth. It never does
that's a flute. I wanna say pan flute, maybe?
okay that is a banger
oh, that vocal synth. fuck yes
I don't think I have ever heard that song
that's nice
uh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=morjGZ40WOc
That's lovely. Nice arrangement
that's cool
can't play it, not available
Aldious are amazing. I own four albums
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hraBdfH2xfI
maybe it's because the German one is the original, and it's the one I grew up with.
The way the song is structured in its melody works better with the German syllable count, I find. some stuff sounds way forced in the English one.
I have to disagree.
but you would need to understand it
The German version is far better, also in terms of meaning in the lyrics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbEkEDMqGjs
I Hate Jimmy Page is fucking wild
my favorite band of all time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-om3htENS6s
I watched them as a child too
my sister is too
haven't heard the soundtrack in years. wow
wait, Oliver Onions??
I like quite a lot of genres, like punk, electronica, power metal, synth pop, synth wave
my sister is a Oasis fan
my best friend likes Toto's music a lot
Like I said the other day: not a rock fan
I always liked Africa more
it also had Queen Of Hearts
I only really liked one station: k-rose
wasn't too fond of GTA SA soundtrack.
Vice City has an amazing soundtrack if you are an 80s music fan
no issue, was just saying. that's where I know it from
was in GTA Vice City
also a nice track
the guitar solo works way better in the full version
the video is the shorter version, by the way. the full one is over 4 minutes
it's a very good song
yes, but they said that back then that song was all people gave a shit about or even remember
talknig about it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCM4_5uB1ww
The Fixx with Red Skies was the same
yeah
over and over
because that's the only song people cared about. Imagine writing a lot of tracks you are proud of, and people only want one of them
thanks
yes
<@!87512939107450880> this was what I was working on.
and no worries
thanks
sorry, composing right now
so, A Minor and C Major use the same notes
fun fact: the sixth note of every major scale is the first of its own minor scale with the same notes
basically, you use a different note as the root
honestly, it's easier to understand when you hear the difference, I find
you could also take any Major scale and lower the second, third, sixth and seventh note a half step to get this scale's parallel phrygian scale
and if you play that, you will notice a drastic difference in sound. the one we are hearing in the second song you posted
now, if you raise the third of the Phrygian scale a half step, you get phrygian dominant.
so, instead of E F G A B C D you get E F G# A B C D
E phrygian is E F G A B C D. that's the same as C Major
so, the third note in C Major is E.
so, phrygian is the third mode of major, so if you start any major scale on the third note, you get this note's phrygian scale.
C D E F G A B is C Major, for example
the scale?
basically, you know Major, right?
Phrygian dominant is the fifth mode of harmonic minor
no worries, that's just what I heard in that song
and pentatonic melody.
oh, phrygian dominant. very nice
not bad. interesting, refreshing take
it's good
similar. Not really my style. Symphonic Metal doesn't really do it for me. the bass solo at 3:35 was neat, though. if the entire song was like that, that would have been cool.
not really my style, I must say. There is nothing more annoying to me than christmas songs. Maybe covers. But arrangement is solid. This type of music is generally not something I listen to.
That's good. Nice mix of genres. wasn't a fan of the screaming at first, but it grew on me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF2nxgLxqW4
yeah, same. not my thing
a very good friend of mine likes techno a lot, too
I can't stand it. Techno focuses a lot on steady beats, and I prefer chord progressions and complex melodies, stuff that is typically not the focus of techno. there are exceptions, of course.
I don't like dance and techno in general, really.
also, that song fucking annoys me as it was played constantly when it was released
don't like his stuff
one of my favorite songs by one of my favorite bands
<@!87512939107450880> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRsIi-4iS1I
Banger. I own the mp3
nostalgia. I always loved the bassline of the song so much
that's a great tune, holy shit
yeah, I noticed the views. not even a thousand
oh that's really good
I thought you watched D4DJ. Must have mixed something up
<@!722121666641133608> you know that one, right?
okay, this cover is a legit banger, what the fuck?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8iiD5EVlWI
oh, nice
for real, never heard that before. or if I did, I was very young
<@!87512939107450880> this is the second time I am listening to it now. it's stuck in my head. Thanks
fucking catchy, though
never heard that song
I love this band
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1ZbBnl_WBw
<@!87512939107450880> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJLHF20TrBE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1ZbBnl_WBw
oh yeah, this one is great
this 7/8 time signature. very good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg67mxCA2ZI
was amazing
I've played drums in a punkband in my youth.
I got the song on my phone. Punk is very important to me
it was. we played and wrote the weirdest stuff
the fuck?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJU0ZT072LA
That song reminds me so much of Vice City. It's almost connected in my brain
shilling one of my favorite bands again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcRTLC_D3r8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSXjbC_wj6c
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSXjbC_wj6c
I think I know this one
nice! Touhou remixes are what the internet was made for. That and cats.
not bad. very smooth stuff
yeah, it's amazing. great composition, too
I got that song on my phone and PC. classic
The opening song has no reason to be as good as it is
you're right, it's D4DJ.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W8t15TKXAk
The drummer of the band Aldious (of whom I posted a song further up the channel) is Marina Bozzio, stepdaughter of Terry Bozzio, one of the best drummers in the world. He played with Frank Zappa. The world is small.
I have the BuRay this recording if from. Amazing stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uyyc2OeQ3Y
you can also always hear the bass in the mix. it's great
<@331908049822547978> The bass in this track is insane.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpAYnVJX9CY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGEJOAsQX2w
And I still only really like live stuff of bands I like
Didn't like live all that much before.
Happens. When you're a fan, you prefer the more personal live stuff.

I was in a similar boat. I started to prefer live stuff when I started listening to Die Ärzte and their live stuff.
nice. The founder of the band, Yoshi, the guitarist with the shorter hair in the video to Sweet Temptation, grew up with Metallica and Iron Maiden. Their song "We Are" even interpolates "One" in the intro.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfkJT0rra-8
<@331908049822547978> sorry for the constant pings, just this one last time.
One of my favorite songs by them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hraBdfH2xfI
good god, that brings me back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKYnHV7Ks_s
I thought that was Tommy Wiseau for a minute
I have an album by them. Great stuff
They are the most successful music act in Japan
<@331908049822547978> I don't know if you heard of B'z
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUPG9ScNE78
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dAekw2FGU8
catchy as hell, even if it is an unusual sound for them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy90PTIG1Xw
One of my favorite bands
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRcwS-XvOOk
Oh, wow, Samantha Fox. Good shit! The dream of every teenager back in the day.
this song is so good. Fits Maki's voice perfectly
<@331908049822547978> Aldious, one of my favorite bands, uploaded a new clip from the concert they recorded for the BluRay release earlier this year. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si8gQ37XJeE

They are crazy live
Yup, they are. I have two albums of theirs
I have only watched 1 and 2
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
that begs the question: how does Maria know that, hm?
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
OH GOD!!!! <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
DMC is Kirby's Dreamland compared to Ninja Gaiden
and everything
Those damn rockets, am I right?
it's really been a while
oh, maybe that's what I was talking about. Nevermind then.
I don't even remember that move. It's been years since I last played that game.
simply press Y/Triangle, I believe it was, when a guy tries that move. You cut them up instantly.
you can kill them from across the map with a press of a button
the ones where when an enemy attacks and his arm glows red.
My actual name is Chris, so I guess I'd be Chris?
you know about the instakills, right?
Advice? For Razor's Edge? Practice. May sound dumb, but that is honestly the only advice I could give.
I can't even play Razor's Edge if I wanted to nowadays. I did not think this through when I gave my X-Box away
I only have a PS4 now. A shame as the games are either PS3, Vita, or X-Box.
no shame, I did the same at first. It is really unbelievably difficult.
Yes, it's harder
Razor's Edge is the good version.
The original Ninja Gaiden 3 or Razor's Edge?
yeeehaaw
I believe so, yes.
Playing as Kasumi was fun in 3. Seeing her go crazy was something different
ah, I played on X-Box
They do? PS3?
Dude, I love Ayane in this game.
ah, so my memory is not completely messed up.
a lot
oh, it will
aight, sleep tight
that's true, yeah
and has fixed shard positions and stuff. it is impossible to upgrade two weapons to max in one playthrough
I had +10
oh, yes, of course
I don't do that. I finished DS1 on my first playthrough back then on level 80, I believe, and jumped right into NG+. Did not hit the softcap on any stat back then
but still, I had a good time.
of course, BBs gameplay has a lot of differences from DS
I played every Dark Souls multiple times, so I kind of knew what I got myself into.
maybe a bit of both, yes
Nope. I just collect them where I find them.
I did not feel the scaling to be that bad.
I like pain
why what?
I am currently doing that. On my second playthrough, by the way
I had a lot of trouble with those two
I needed to many tries.
Reminds me of Ludwig from Bloodborne. Screw that guy. Or Maria of the Astral Clocktower
But you beat it.
I can not type today
I own rebirth 1, 2, 3, U action unleashed, four goddesses and hyperdevotion noire.
Nep is always good
Dragon Quest XI is getting a release this September on PS4 and PC
I know you were
it can't come close to the game, trust me
fuck the anime
Same here, 5 was my first
Play Persona 5. best JRPG
The doc is good. But my waifu in the game will always be Kawakami
was totally worth it
I bought my PS4 like a year ago and already have 20 games for it.
in fact, the twins are the only female confidants you can't lay.
well, besides the fact they are like 12
Ha, there is actually a good reason that you can't, but that would be spoiler
no
I love this game to pieces
I beat the game three times already
Did I hear Persona 5?

good game, hu?
don't have it
same here
Dubstep <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
This was a triumph, I'd say.
I like potatoes
Black Mesa
and proud of it
but we knew what you meant
shadman?
God Of War does not interest me in the slightest, honestly
I bought the GOTY when it was on sale. Totally worth it
Ah, okay
if you nabbed it for free
And you could not play it without plus
Me neither.
I tried the free month for bloodborne, but that's it
I did not buy it on PS4 because it was coming for PC. and you don't have to pay for online
can't wait
oh, yes, same
god.
And Shadow of the Tomb Raider
The Spyro Remaster is also September.
I hope you played on console
aim support???
I liked it
but thanks for the little info there
you are one hour late. but so am I.
I enjoy my work a lot, honestly. I have no problems with free days in the middle of the week
I work in retail. my weekend is usually Thursdays. And sometimes Saturday.
good sleep time, yeah
what time is it over there?
Looks like a beautiful place
noice
We are surrounded by water. Five minutes of walking and you will see the sea
I live in northern Germany. We know mountains only from tales.
I never went hiking
I still have to get two trophies in Persona 5, have to finish Horizon Zero Dawn and a ton of PS2 classics that I downloaded.
I heard it being way worse.
That's not so bad
battery life, i mean
I heard the Switch has a short runtime portable. Is that still the case?
understandable
It gets a PC version too. Might check it out
sounds interesting
Never heard of that
What would that remaster be?
Well, I got until September 4th to decide.
Exactly, that's why I am still unsure
Square Enix themselves, apparently
Me too, I usually do not pre-order. But I love DQ to bits. However, at the same time, it's the first time a DQ game comes to PC, so who knows how the port will turn out.
on steam, that is
I wonder if I should preorder DQXI...
yeah
It is apparently very good, but I never played a single game from it
what is that game series about even?
if that blows your mind, just wait
jep
persona?
WHAT
so why do I get tearing on 60 but not over?
fps is the drawn frames, hertz is the refresh rate
^ this
but it's noticable.
like I said, not all 200
No, I see a difference.
Doom has this dumb thing where whenever an ingame cutscene is going on, it locks down to 60, making the screen tear like a bitch
BUT!
nah, I could see the difference easily. maybe not all 200, but it was obvious.
Doom is a blast to play with the Vulkan API on PC. 200 fps constantly
stealth games are great.
On console. you are forgiven
I hardly play FPS, so I suck at aiming regardless
ah, okay.
pc or console?
it gets better. way better.
very nice! sleep well
oh, nice!
I remember playing 1 on PS2. Great game
as soon as money is involved, they are fast
yeah.
Let's hope for the best
for me it sounds more like Steam knew what kind of shit they stirred up with it and now talking about "re-reviewing" for damage control
So, what does that mean?
bakuhatsu?
GFL?
Well, killing undead and abominations is cathartic.
The characters in Stardew are what makes the game, in my opinion.
hey, you can have multiple
It's like a way better Harvest Moon
Oh, it's amazing. Unbelievably relaxing.
I think it looks good
I like it. It also has a hint of silver in it, which fits her gear.
Hey, waifu for laifu
<@!98541382393688064> Stardew is great. Who are you waifuing?
I am so hyped for the Spyro Remake and Dragon Quest XI

Shining Resonance I might check out.
is what I would call them
DS are action rpgs
Dragon Quest XI is coming in September. That will be great
Best JRPG I ever played
Persona 5!
Final Hallway XIII
ffxiii is not good. no wonder you haven't played much
Yeah, I can see the timer maybe being a problem.
or do you mean the store Penny?
cents?
Machine translation, huh?

Or, a third possibility: the source code was edited in-browser, making it appear only on the users end
or it was never a real revision, as you can edit and then preview the page.
The Todd one? It was most likely completely axed from the servers
The living meme
Ha!
oh, did his page get vandalized again?
Somehow the urge came over me to install Gothic 2 again. The game may be mad old - 2004 - but damn is it good.
And now we are married with a kid. Funny how that goes.
I had a similar thing with Haley. She was nagging about the village life and how she hates it, so I thought: Why not give her a reason to love it?
And that's why I love this game so much. You really start to sympathize with the characters
But she has by far the worst life in the valley, with her alcoholic mother and living in a trailer
Penny was too cutesy for me.
I don't know, I like my girls with attitude.
She is great. She goes from nagging bitch to adorable lovable puffball if you romance her.
I chose Haley.
damn, I am blind.
I even scrolled up to see if I made a comment somewhere
oh, duh.
you see, this is my fetish
nothing personel, kid
oh, cold steel is good
but she came first
she may not punch
But let's not forget the original LB
Lesbian biker
It's not my fault that my mind is corrupted
Still, same abbrevation
Whenever I see the abbreviation TitS I think about Tribulations In Tainted Space. I can't be the only one.
And choices that don't matter.
it is, apparently
http://www.thosegamers.com/bravely-second-censored-layer-and-the-downward-spiral-of-localization/
The job system has quests attached to it, and you can fail those quests. In the Japanese and American version.
apparently, because innocent people die
okay, bad endings for jobs were removed. All of them
let me look it up real quick so I can show you what was changed
they removed story elements
not bikinis
If you're living in europe, do NOT buy second. The game is censored to hell and back.
Bravely Default, you mean?
super asterisk three
Ah, neat
yeah, Idon't know how to bold letters in Discord
where is that SHE meme even from?
This smile melts my cold heart
well, with a name like Treehouse
Because fuck your fun, apparently
oh, nice
but Kanji? Oh, boy
because Hiragana and Katakana are no problem
I don't know how heavy the game is on kanji use.
I reckoned neither would you
I would not want to play half a game
No problem.
If it was not censored so heavily
The game series could be a huge hit here.
Oh, absolutely.
Illusion Of Choice V: Skyrim
could be
It's kinda like Kawakami in Persona for me. No other woman in the game compares
ha, waifu for laifu.
interesting
so, kind of like a company fund then
that makes a lot of money
cha-ching
That's good to hear. So we can be sure that when it's out of beta it will work fine
is the multiplayer out of beta?
because a lot of people say that it's pretty good
I just wanna try it out. honestly
meh
But I got part 3 on my pc. I wanna play it sometime
I played a demo on steam. Did not stick with me.
() Loot boxes
I played the "first" Ace Attorney. Was fun
But that's just a theory.
I have nothing against VN elements in games, but just VN bores me. I need gameplay. But that's just me.
Well, DDLC is more a deconstruction of VNs.
I never got the appeal of VNs. But if you enjoy them, go ahead. Like Alice, for example. She isn't doing anything else, it seems.
Kaliks' second comment
look at her going crazy in the gif
Jesus, Basa is gonna explode
could be, why not
got a thing for orange hair, huh?
Futaba "if Hibiki was a neet" Sakura
I have to admit, I did not like the guy, but it still is horrible that he died. How old was he? 33?
Tiddies can be grasped, understood, observed.
but that was when they were: "Uh, yeah... we messed up, kinda. Oops."
I heard they did. At least the developer was noticed
because of nudity in it
oh, great
`this thing?`
Oh, they even flagged Witcher 3
apparently not
'so, this?'
how do you make those funny boxes? is it quotes?
same
<@138131889142628352> Look up #waifuholocaust on twitter. It's because Valve apparently cracks down on VNs and stuff. But they actually backpedaled and said: "Disregard that, we will re-evaluate."
I thought of Ritual Of The Night.
oh, you were talking about Curse Of The Moon
or is there a beta?
Wait, it's not released yet, is it?
A very handsome sword, I have to admit
Ayane is great in Razor's Edge
The games are all about catching the wave, so to speak.
very good.
the claws in the game are amazing, in my opinion.
oh, nicely done
Playing some nice classics after years and getting lost in them again is a great feeling. Currently again sucked into the world of Gothic 2.
Because this game has the gimmick that you could expand your attack as long as you wanted if you pressed the A button to the beat of the battle music.
so, in a way a expanded version of the fighting system of Mother 3?
I got Crypt Of The Necrodancer recently after it was on my wishlist for years. Good game, but damn, is it tricky.
ha, it's great, isn't it.
Now you unlocked Kasumi, right? I like playing as her in the missions
Hell yeah! Great job!
oh, god, that sucks
Don't remove Zero Suit!
I am sad for I do not own a switch and therefore no Smash Bros for me. I wanna beat dudes up with Samus again.
I did not even know they stream in the first place
Especially the DLC for Crash 1, which adds a level that was removed from the original because it was too difficult.
I've beaten it. Everything, 100%. Every single trophy. It was HARD.
Have you beaten the N.Sane Trilogy, aka Dark Souls 4?
It's still not really hard, IF you can keep an eye on him. But the moment you lose sight of him...
Dude, fuck Hunter.
Kinda like Wrong Side Of The Tracks from GTA: SA
likewise. It's really not that bad of a mission.
or they put airhorns and REKT in big letters on the screen when you fail it and he says the line
Will probably be an achievement or something
Hell, yeah, Saki. Not that you need to, the ost is amazing.
September
Not yet, Sketch
but I will get DQ for PC
Spyro for PS4 is a must-have, 100%. Together with Dragon Quest.
Love me those little indie titles
Or King's Way.
Crypt Of The Necrodancer is amazing as well.
oh, you're right, I did not even notice
I had to stop after 30 minutes, the nostalgia was too much, almost ODed.
Yesterday I got the urge to play some Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 again. The nostalgia hit me like a truck.
and when you have enough, kill it and presto
if you then just stall the turns it will throw away cash over and over
Mementos. If an enemy is confused it will throw away items and money, just like your characters
especially is you use the confusion trick on bosses
that's why she is bae. BAE!
she really is.
go to a dungeon, get a massage and still get shit done in the evening
her massage is the best.
I chose Kawakami because I felt so bad for her. She is so adorable.
and christmas
exactly. there is no gameplay benefit for dating
yeah, you can max all of them without dating
what do you mean, ibu?
My one and only will always be Kawakami
She will find a way
you can hang out with your gf in hawaii
Noice.
Do you have a girlfriend already?
good night

And have you seen their stats?
You have to damage them enough to force a phase shift before every sixth turn, otherwise it's over. You have to beat them at the same time, or they revive each other. AND you have to beat them before turn 22, or it's over.
and you wanna know the real kicker?
they *will* go for weaknesses
but their AI is improved, I found
oh, yeah, that yes
well, no.
they are a bonus boss you can only fight when you have beaten the game once already.
And the Grim Reaper
I have beaten the twins in Persona 5.
I'm not either. I just really enjoyed the trilogy
But damn, was it fun
Still stands as my rarest trophy out of all my games. It's that hard.
I got the gem and the time relic.
She was like: "Let's fuck shit up"
I also liked how her awakening was handled. Shows her rebellious site
Makoto has most badass Persona
damn
wait, Makoto is also bro
bros before hos
I am missing two trophies for the game, by the way
true, later you'll have Personas like crazy
is piccaro's strengh really that high?
^true
I don't think so, they are balanced to the rest
I find the DLC don't really add anything. Just nostalgia
boo
and trust me, you better be fucking ready when you face them, because they do NOT fuck around
they are a bonus boss
it be the best girls
oh, my friend
because I now have Satanael, he is pretty much useless
I only used Morgana at the final boss and while fighting the twins.
and who covers healing?
same.
her outfit looks dope too
She is a great character, and a good fighter.
fluff girl.
you will find out in the next palace
The girl sitting by herself?
After that is Okumura
directly after futa
that he is not supposed to be there
or rather
I like how they need a minute to even check that he's there.
but only if your level is not high enough
true, yeah.
Honestly, I never bothered. You get more than enough money.
Anime janai
I don't understand it
I have Yakuza 0, where you can play it.
I never got Mahjong.
I had a similar playtime my first time
I have 189 hours in it, finished it three times
I played P5 like mad too when I got it.
moemon? cute
cool
It's great
you guys should watch Hellsing Ultimate one time.
Sleep, wake up early tomorrow, be productive!
go to bed!!
Saki, isn't it hella late at your end?
I don't know, I prefer the discovery
I finished all DS games and Bloodborne too. But I don't have nearly this many hours in it
okay
Is it your first Bloodborne playthrough?
Bloodborne?
put a fridge next to the bed
Man, if I did not know better I'd say I'm drunk
trap card in defense?
wait
Trap Card NO U in defense mode
Never played it. Looks interesting, though
that was extreme 3, not DOA5
doa5 western ban? what?
the DLC came out 2015
correction, 12 years.
the game was 14 years old by then
The game was released in retail in 2003. When it was rereleased on steam, Running With Scissors made a DLC for it, expanding the story.
and I was like: dude, have you played Postal 2?
A friend of mine was surprised that the game still gets dlc´
the octoling DLC is coming, isn't it?
oh, yes, it was great
skate has a very dedicated fanbase
of course
octoling amiibo will come
which is why everybody is flipping shit
Didn't EA put the Skate 3 servers back online?
Guess I just have a thing for women kicking ass
I am a huge Samus fan
maybe if I see a Zero Suit Samus one.
Still not my thing, to be honest.
Just a glorified paywall
Amiibo are stupid in general, I found.
I still have to finish Samus Returns, I realized.
I am scared that if Skate 4 actually happens it will have DLC out the ass and cosmetic shit you have to buy
The most australian man to ever live
here it is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIRT7lf8byw
just a second
<@!81815015224516608> He actually does. I've seen the full vid
but other german players who do not speak english will be so lost
Not that I need the german version, I play all my games in english, simply because I am so used to it.
And that's just the first one.
Like, they mistranslate the word "dash" in the pause menu. Instead of "dash" as in dashing away, they translated it as the symbol "dash", /.
the german translation for Wild Arms 1 is fucked to shit
guns that are boats?
boats with guns?
coke & cheese
was that booing I heard for a second?
She is talking so slow because she would not understand herself otherwise
FastStart? Really?
Battlefield 5 was of course there
I mean, Forza Horizon 4 looked nice
that one guy in the audience: "They got a new truck!"
poor X-Box One
"brand new 60fps mode"
of course they push sea of thieves
RIP Zolgnein. He never awoke.
Kinect 2: Kinectic Boogaloo
They'll announce new Kinekt games by Rare
But good to see RED trying something else
That Cyberpunk game looked meh. Not a fan of cyberpunk as a style in general.
Hibiki is too fast
that is true
Maria as Jetstream Sam
Zol was faster than me
Metal Gear Rising Revengence but with Tsubasa
A character action game of Symphogear would be amazing
what happened to the "of war" part?
Gears 5
because pay to win, Saki
fuck mobile
Session could be interesting
you don't need to. it's Battletoads
BATTLETOADS!!!
yeah
Jump Force
weeb fighter 2019?
DMC5 looks pretty good, yeah
Cuphead DLC
DMC 5, huh?
Rise was really good.
Shadow Of The Tomb Raider I am honestly looking forward to. I enjoyed the other games since the reboot
Never preorder!
I wanna learn Mahjong
So, N. Sane Trilogy is getting a new level on June 29th.
Just spend hours playing Yakuza 0. I forgot how good that game is.
so, more like I would have saved 10%
Well, I bought it when it was on sale.
but I could have saved 80%
It's absolutely amazing
with DLC
sadly, I already own that game

very nice
please tell me this is legit
you mean A Hat In Time? No, it's a platformer, like Mario Sunshine or Banjo Kazooie
oh, little witch academia
LWA?
I mean, maybe some one wants to test if the other code works? I already have the game
the pre-order key is still not redeemed it seems like
I only used one
Anyone knows what is going on? I pre-ordered A Hat In Time a while back (2013) and jsut now realized that I have two codes for steam.
oh, boy, Vinny from Vinesauce spent one hour on Ludwig, one and a half on Lady Maria, and now he stepped into the fight against the Orphan Of Kos (or some say Kosm). Buckle in, boys and girls, it's going to be a wild ride.
I had no problem with it
but that's the best way to play it
at which boss of Bloodborne are you right now?
never played it, but looks interesting
even out of her charge attack. two quick hits and she tumbled
no, I stunlocked her with ease
yep
just killed Lady Maria in NG+. Way easier than the first time
Cauliflower is delicious
Caulifla?
broccoli head
nice, Shirabe
"we've achieved galaxy brain"
He is just some dude who was talking shit
Well, Papa G is not even a boss fight anymore at this point
I hardly parry her, mostly only in her first phase. later I just stay near her
she is somewhat, yes.
<@!263983345669505025> In case you want to see how Maria is in NG+ https://streamable.com/czk29
she should see a doctor
Or some say Kosm, of course
Orphan Of Kos is no more
persistent
I think I will try it
I never played that
the intro sounds like it was voiced by a 16 year old student
I remember King's Field having this laughable german dub
I play Daggerfall and Fallout 1 frequently. Those games are amazing
I know that game
I will never stop!!
the final bosses in the base game, I should say
the bosses in the dlc were the only really hard ones in NG+. The final two bosses were a joke
that will happen
Bloodborne finished a second time. Now in NG++
I don't like VR. It's a gimmicky concept. Like 3D TVs
amen
I got my 2DS because Pokémon Sun was preinstalled
The GameCube had 3D, Luigi's Mansion even supports it. It was just that the peripherals for it were way too expensive to manufacture and sell. They would have cost more than the console itself
regular
I got a 2DS. I like it a lot
Wasn't the same technic for the 3D build into the Gamecube?
Firmware is always a risky thing
I meant the installation itself
just the launch. It's my first and only DS. Too risky to fuck something up
I used the hole myself
I got the latest update from Nintendo. Pretty sure that fixes the leak
oh, are you using the leak in the audioplayer?
does the firmware run parallel to the original, or does it replace?
wow, neat
sidescrolling?
I sadly never played them. They are fighters like Street Fighter, right?
I heard Renewal was rather... meh.
7EVEN is where shit seems to hit the fan if the teaser trailer at the end of PBS is to believed.
right, it doesn't. And neither does PBS, which is a direct continuation of EV.
Now, Burst Renewal is a remake of Burst, a 3DS title
I am looking forward to 7EVEN. But Honey Parade should include some new gameplay stuff to spice things up, honestly.
I had not problem with the story.
In my opinion, it's EV. Gameplay solid, runs smooth as butter, looks good.
Estival Versus is a blast
smarty pants
you know what I meant
On NG++
All first try, I might add.
okay, beat the Cleric Beast, Papa G, the Bloodstarved Beast and Vicar Amelia today.
thanks, Saki
Honestly the only SoulsBorne game I even cared about getting every trophy
after that, cakewalk
the first playthrough was the hardest.
was not that hard, honestly
Well, Seymour, I made it.
Estelle don't play
you can stealth, yes. but no archering anywhere
archer? In Fallout?
Want to be a slaver? sure. Pornstar? Okay. Childmurderer? Go ahead. Want to help people? Why not. Want to not give a shit and just run around and amok? Oh, yeah
they are amazing. Really difficult, especially at the start, but man, the games give you a lot of freedom.
just like I like my RPGs: Complex. With a lot of stuff to do in a lot of different ways. Which is why I love Fallout 1 and 2
I like roguelikes too, especially when they are really complex
That game is hard as hell
Crypt Of The Necrodancer, anyone?
hm
DLC, or stable game
oh, wow
same
is the PC version of Nioh good?
remove
The boss is a virus
it just checks the tags after all
Most likely
but it was not the discovery queue, it was the part on the right that showed my why this game was relevant to my interests
oh, right
damn, touhou is hitting it big lately
the what?
sounds great
Ah, yes, Neptunia U, the game with demons and difficult bosses
Like how steam shows at the side: Similar to games you played: Dark Souls 3 and Hyperdimension Neptunia U
Pokémon Sun was rather... meh? Shirabe, what?
but it looks really good
Set it on wishlist. don't have the money right now.
thanks. the steam search function showed fuck all
where the fuck is the game on steam? I can't find it
how does it work on 10?
bigthink
and they have their viewers too
oh, you'd be surprised. ever watched speedrun attempts? hours of resets on end.
neat. I hope you guys will enjoy it.
cool, thanks <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
<@!127644949884698624> I wanna go back to streaming again when my graphics card gets here on saturday. would it be okay to post a link to my channel when I go live in this channel?
Persona 5 is the best RPG I ever played
Bloodborne NG+5 started
Bloodborne NG+++ now
Tennis Aces looks really cool, but is supposed to have a nasty difficulty spike.
or maybe even have an account there?`
any of you know how the side amdrewards works?
it's a bug. It will get fixed in an update
Doggo can't hit you if you are directly under it
Need nip paper.
Hardest boss
New card arrived, runs like a charm
go to bed
Not German ones. There are strict laws and shit against what the BBC does here in Germany
It's the BBC, what do you expect, really? It's the Fox News of Britain
Of course not. There is enough scientific evidence that video games do nothing if you are not "damaged" beforehand. And if you are, anything can be a trigger, not just games.
I bet you searched symphogear merch up some time in the past with that browser or device
cookies, my friend
not my thing
did not like the setting or the gameplay
both
Don't get the hype, I found the game seriously not good
Can I say something controversial? I played Nier: Automata, and really, REALLY did not like it
uh
adds?
Seriously, I am that hyped for it
I get Spyro on release
I am waiting for Shadow Of The Tomb Raider, Dragon Quest XI and Spyro
Far Cry 5 is now given away, just fyi.
Kingsway by David Cage. We are screwed. A bad GoT. And GoT was already not my thing
so, does that mean you want it?
anyone with a uplay account interested in Far Cry 5? I already own the game
Oh, yes, the nostalgia feels great
never preorder
only one, huh?
that's a shame
Oh, so there actually is a Maria in Nioh? Can't wait to see her.
I like how the weapons behave and that you get more familiar with them
I started playing it a few days ago. actually really fucking good game
I guess I have to
<@263983345669505025> got the PC version. Looking forward to it.
Rom can be a bit of a pain because of the little friends it brings
honestly, the bosses become laughably easy in later NGs
By the way, Kerrik, I am in NG+5 of Bloodborne
I think everyone has troubles with BSB the first time
that sucks, Kerrik.
I like Nep's reaction when she sees the pictures: "Look, that's Noire, and that is Noire too. They're all Noire!" How she delivers the last sentence is gold
No writing could do it justice
While on the topic: The dub for the anime is amazing as well. "Oh my, how lewd."
Uni is adorable with how insecure she is sometimes
agreed
Uni a cute
I love it
especially jokes and references
I prefer the translation over the japanese version.
and take jabs at weebs, otakus and anime culture as a whole
but to each their own
Well, Neps are actually a parody towards waifuism and moe stuff
later in the video series the dialogue is even replaced with lines from the Neptunia games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W4KtnfsdYk&list=PLhL3-d5KVxCHEFPBV6sxfHFVIYUystYns
shows how good Nep is
it's hilarious
More games need Nep mods. There is a video series of GTA SA with all characters replaced by Neptunia characters and other.
oh, black ops
body odor 3?
nethack, not a bad idea
anyone know some good roguelikes?
the best experience is playing fallout 1 and 2 with low inteligence
absolutely
Still good games
Those games were seriously messed up
I am not kidding
In Fallout 1 and 2 you could kill children, capture npcs for slavery and get raped.
Grittier than Fallout?
I need a new Xenoverse with Caulifla playable.
dess
amen, Doxe
or the human form of a jigglypuff
those are just similar faces compared. It's not like Maria is supposed to be a knife or something
Moe anthropomorphism, or anthropomorphism in general, is something I never liked, honestly.
and I never will
I didn't
Metal Gear Rising Revengence
Bayonetta.
yeah, rubber banding is really bad in NFS 2015
The reason it has to be there is because AI is fucking stupid. It needs the edge
exactly
There is a reason why it exists, and it's a good thing, if done well. But in NFS 15 it's not
you mean NFS? Need For Speed?
don't mention it, my friend
ATATATATATATATA
I'd had that if I had the money
Well, map awareness is something I think I got down rather well.
tank controls and such
looks pretty good, but the controls look wonky a bit
I would emulate it most likely
I only have a PS4.
isn't the game made by the team now known as Platinum Games?
<@!263983345669505025> RETURNED
sure. I only know it from streams, though.
can't, I believe.
Gotta go buy some groceries. Will be back in a few.
Yeah, what was that about?
In comparison, yes. But 3 was too, before the Razor's Edge remake
Likewise
It's been years since I played 3, not to mention 1 & 2. Hardly remember anything.
And made Ayane playable for the first time, I think.
And Razor's Edge added Kasumi.
yeah.
P5 is the best JRPG I ever played.
Persona 5
Just Cause
because they are GOOD
Binding Of Isaac
Crypt Of The Necrodancer
have fun
Ever played Daggerfall?
I think New Vegas is the best 3D Fallout by a hundred miles, but it does not hold a candle to 1 or 2
New Vegas should be played on PC, Kerrik. It's a whole different world
Bethesda's fault. Obsidian had to use their old ass engine and they had to make a game in a few months
You can't play New Vegas without community patches.
Solidus ass, even
New Vegas was good, but not because of the combat
yeah, I played Dogma, and Fallout 3 and 4 were boring
I am so hyped for Kiwami for PC
same
Let us dig deep enough. Maybe we will find something
I got it cheap, so why not, I thought
alright.
I still have to play Witcher 3.
Still don't get tired of it
well, I finished BB 5 times now
Yeah, Razor's Edge was a ride
The fights are fast and brutal, but it has some downtime in between to make you catch a break.
I think Bloodborne is the best example for that case
oh, wow, flavor? Now you're putting me on the spot. I like the ones with challenge, really. They don't have to be hectic, just forcing you to stay on your guard.
Yes, that's a game
How about cat girl without salad?
Tiny Tank had an amazing soundtrack
for PS1
Tiny Tank
Tiny Tank
no!
So, I am fine with them removing Nazi imagery from games. I don't play those games anyway
The thing is, even those right winged assholes here can't pull half the shit the Nazis pulled in the 40s, because of our very strict laws regarding this stuff
yep. That is the reason
It does not matter if you shoot them. "Oh, but you shoot the Nazis" is bullshit, as the imagery is banned, unrelated to the context. Because if they would allow that, developers will find other excuses to put them in
only games
not media
„Smørrebrød, Smørrebrød røm, pøm, pøm, pøm“
the swedish chef is danish in the german version
the violence is unchanged
different laws
that's because of the nazi symbols
Like Doom 2016, uncut
It isn't nowadays. The law changed
was back in the old days
The german version is censored, it seems
Never played that. PS exclusive?
the gamecube game?
Darkness?
thank god
you can get it on PSN, by the way
I played that like mad back in the day
Hell yes!
Maybe not that far off, as the game was made to parody console mascots
My fav is this one. JAZZ ALERT! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tzvF5WuMWw
Glad you like it
The soundtrack is absolutely hype.
How about Xenoverse?
The music!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxVt0rKqmC8
But still, that keeps it turn based, which I am fine with
And it did work already.
I mean, sure, stuff like that can work.
Hm.
What do you mean, latooni?
Persona 5 is the best RPG I ever played. And that's turn based. I love it!
Give me turns. Give me full control. I don't mind waiting for the enemy to attack
but still, then we still have the problem with the battle system. I really do not like it.
yeah, but that's it, basically
XII was not my thing. Tried it
The only good FF in my eyes was 9
and that's why I prefer turn based.
That's also something I do not like in RPGs: AI controlled companions. I want to decide what they'll do
Yep. I also don't like RTS because of that reason. Too much at once.
It's not an RPG. It's straight action. And you only play one character, not an entire team you have to manage.
That's different.
But thanks for the info
Don't worry, I don't like Xenoblade in the first place.
yeah, it's when everything happens at once.
Nep's is okay, as it's more about positioning, and you still take turns
Oh, my God. So, this game is not for me. I don't like Tales fighting system.
it looks like the Tales series
Question: Shining Resonance Refrain, what kind of battle system does it use?
There wasn't
nope
Like I said, I may not have that much of a problem with grinding
Yep, even then
Like I said, I never felt slowed down anywhere
Can't wait.
Well, I will get Dragon Quest XI for PC, absolutely.
I sometimes skip words. It's bad
fixed
maybe I am not so bothered by it
I never felt that way
and where was it random? you mean the drops?
I never needed to grind
Hell no
I love Dragon Quest
I am absolutely excited for it
Are you insane? 8 was amazing!
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417> I'm sorry ***WHAT?***
anyone here hyped for Dragon Quest XI?
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
That Jackbox idea sounds great
AAARRRRGGGG!
open chest, uncovered legs.
That's not heavy armor, that's just a metal dress!
Maybe I am alone on this one, but I don't like the "fanservice because fanservice without reason."
I think it weird. A team of soldiers and fighters going against monsters and the like? Yeah, let's put them in bikinis.
What's with the habit of japanese games to put their characters in swimsuits or maid uniforms?
is everything voiced in SDR?
I remember the file for the complete japanese VO in Persona 5 was 2GB
well, filesize?
because fans of japanese rpgs prefer the original.
Oh, like in Persona 5
neat
Does it have english dub?
BIRTUAL YOUTUBER KIZUNA AI DESU!
DOMO!
Ha, joke
The Legend Of Korra in steam
no, that's the opposite of physics
how does that work?
That's not how armor works!
Tell me about it, Pats. September has three great games for me in store.
With a lot of lube, R.
oh, nice
what are you studying? Hacking or netting?
Get it!
Hacknet is great!
Nope, doesn't ring a bell
You have that often, that itch?
Uh
Oh, I know <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I feel if I make an assumption beforehand I go into it with a clouded mind.
It's just something I don't like doing.
Oh, sure, it's just that I don't want to do that for myself, you know?
If I say now: "It's crap!!" and two weeks later I tried the game and I like it, I'd look rather stupid, in my opinion
I am just avoiding it because I never played it. There are games that are better played than watched.
It's just that pure online games never hook me for long.
I reckon the game being rather enjoyable with friends.
That's why I will not throw stuff around like: "It's crap", and what ever.
Keep in mind, by the way, that I can not speak from playing experience. I have, however, watched videos of it.
The building of stuff should be limited heavier, like recourses and stuff.
I mean, you make some solid points, all things considered
oh, yeah, that's true. Fortnite goes the Overwatch route with its clear and distinctive visuals. You can glance over in a moments notice and recognize immediately what's happening
I mean, how much can you do in BR?
I also feel that the genre itself may be what stops those games from being truly amazing.
it's mediocre. And that's something people can still enjoy
I personally find the BR genre unappealing.
people can get addicted to the weirdest stuff.
yeah, it was BAD!
Never seen a game crash and burn so hard.
The Culling 2 was an event, huh?
***HAT!***
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
You're right, they aren't really that good. I assume it may be the approach on the genre itself, not that the games are just flawed. But that's where the "Let's see what worked" comes in.
Even BR games were created because someone saw how well the hunger games in Minecraft fared and just focused on that.
That's basically how the genres we have now evolved.
That analogy is not even that far fetched. Happened often enough. One thing bombs tremendously and then someone comes along and goes: "Okay, let us check what worked and use that."
Because they have to milk a trend until the cow dies.
nice
sounds like fun
It was actually planned for the main character to be a custom one early in development.
yeah, sounds like Witcher 3
So, a bit over a year
December 27th, 2016 was the date of purchase, says steam.
yes
for 15 bucks on steam
I got the GOTY like a year ago, maybe.
I played Witcher 3 for the first time in months again. And got hooked immediately.
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241> Saki is mean to me
It's called thinking two steps ahead.
just hit ctrl+v and bam
I had the punchline written and copied before I wrote the line before that.
***ZING***
Oh, wait, you wanted intelligent discussions, my bad.
Consider going into politics.
I am live on twitch! https://www.twitch.tv/outside998
a system partition, maybe?
Oh, you better believe it. I feel like I could fall over at every moment
I once worked an entire day with the flu. So it's not that bad.
Can get some sleep later
I have to deal with it
happens.
early phone calls because of job, and I have to go to a appointment in a few minutes
even if the sun shines in my face.
I can sleep until midday if I'm tired.
The sun wasn't the problem. I had some stuff to do.
I had fun, yes, but that wasn't it. I just could not sleep until 5am, and had to wake up at 9.
I have 3, 4, and DmC
Oh, both
But it's amazing when you're good at them.
Oh, I know the games are difficult.
That reminds me: I still have to play DMC
Never watched him, though
As soon as I saw his face
Oh, yeah, I know him!
Hm.
Was he the one who went through all three games without taking damage?
Rings a bell.
Oh, wait, yeah, maybe.
LobosJr? Never heard of him.
It was great.
He was so done after that. He needed to piss so badly.
He also played Desert Bus and finished a trip. 8 hours of the same screen. And he made it work.
on stream.
Joel is a massive Dwarf Fortress fan. He once played a session for 9 fucking hours.
they have their full stream channels and their compilation channels. You can watch some short 15 minutes clips from streams there if you want an appetizer.
I am a huge Vinesauce fan, especially of Vinny, Joel and Rev. God, Rev is great, with his dark and dry humor.
Not today, 20th, I believe
Vinesauce do the same.
Oh, HellfireComms, yeah. They are great
That's what I want to keep with my streams, really: The heart. I play to interact with the viewers and to have fun, not to make money.
It was not about money, but about the games.
ProtonJon and stuff.
I guess so, yes.
I like it when people stay real.
That's cool.
Or to start, rather. Have around 15 hours in it. That's not even the beginning.
I also still have The Witcher 3 to finish.
Because Gernim had a fucking hardon for Maria
Why was it made?
What about the doll?
You think?
Kerrik sees innuendos where there are none.
And Basa is stuck in her own personal purgatory because she just can't beat her.
I'll name my first wife Maria
I really need to.
I know
Lady Maria
But if you are in a NG+, good fucking luck with the first boss.
The DLC of Bloodborne is great.
I haven't beaten HZD
Bloodborne is the easiest Soulsborne game to platinum, honestly.
Both plated
Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy and Bloodborne were a blast.
Hell yes.
It does, but Persona 5 disables it.
Finished the game 3 times already.
Need to get a capture card, however
Persona 5. Now there is a game I'd love to stream!
So I guess Andromeda would not rub me the wrong way that much
Honestly, I never felt blown away by the main titles either.
And interestingly, almost all of the bugs and glitches you see are from the console versions. I have no idea how the PC version behaves.
Honestly, I don't know. Never played Andromeda
Witcher 3? That's more yours?
Or Bubsy 3D
Oh, great idea! After the ME Trilogy I'll be streaming Andromeda. For shits.
Gonna keep an eye on those then
Sure, I would not have it in my shelf, but still
Digital would not be a problem
PS4?
I only have the PC versions.
Yeah, that's what I mean
By the way, I am thinking about streaming the Mass Effect Trilogy.
all of them
Nope, I have it for PC
3 is the special edition
Don't know how they name their stuff
DmC is, I assume. All DLCs.
So I heard
I guess most of the complaints were fixed
So, I just tried Mass Effect Andromeda for a little over two hours. Version 1.09. So far, not bad.
Maybe we even play another game after DS3.
I will of course inform you tomorrow shortly before I go live.
I wanna put out a little announcement ahead of time: In around 24 hours I will stream again. Dark Souls 3, continuing where I left off. You can join me at https://www.twitch.tv/outside998
Germany banned preorders without release date.
Live right now
Shame
You forgot? <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Dark Souls 3
https://www.twitch.tv/outside998
Alright, a bit later than I wanted, but I will stream in about 10 minutes.
Fuck loot boxes
amen
Belgium and the Netherlands banned lootboxes already
Can't be sold? Why? No one owns the rights?
What the hell? I just found out that the game The Movies from 2005 is apparently abandonware.
And trust me, you want that thing. It's really good.
Unless you want the eternal lockpick, that requires grinding a bit.
And the ingredients for the picks are everywhere.
the rest you can ignore
The only infiltration tools that are honestly really needed are the lockpicks, I found.
pretty much
I farm because I want the remaining two trophies, that's all.
But you only unlock the levels that enemy appears in after you beat the palace.
Red phosphorus has, in the palace I am in right now, a rate of 0,5%. In Mementos, the same enemy has a rate of 10%.
And in Mementos, the randomized dungeon, the drop rates are much higher.
You don't need those items if you don't want to make all infiltration tools.
3 per week.
But you can at least buy mercury.
I needed 34 mercuries.
I am glad that I got the liquid mercury out of the way, at least. Dropped by Anubis, an enemy type that has two fucking instakill moves, and a drop rate of 2%, I believe.
And need 13 of them
I got 2
It's hard
only two types drop them, and both have around 0,5% chance
No, low drop rate in general
Farming red phosphorus in Persona 5 is a nightmare.
Same with the books.
I just never bothered with the tools until now.
I finished that on my second playthrough, I believe.
My rarest trophy, by the way, is the one for the time relic of the add-on level Stormy Ascent in Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy. 0.3%
All infiltration tools.
Craftworker.
Guess who just got the platinum trophy in Persons 5.
<@138131889142628352> The problem with the requests in Persona 5 is that you can miss some by not checking your messages soon enough. The phone only saves the last 50, and you have to read Mishima's message before you get too many messages that it gets deleted. Happened to me too.
granted, it would be the player's fault, but still.
<@138131889142628352> That's good, but you can miss quests if you don't, which can be a real kick in the teeth.
Ain't that swell?
They made it f2p now, and reverted back to day 1, which does not have linux support anymore.
However, did you know that The Culling 1 was the only BR game with Linux support?
That no one wanted
thank you
dess
Kiri, play
This is so sad.
Culling 2 is completely dead.
I saw some of it. Had to get out early today, so couldn't keep watching.
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
By the way, if someone wants to add me on steam, go ahead.
seems like it
didn't hear any of that.

What happened to steam chat?
That looks good
I mean, not *that* bad. One can see what you were going for.
Have you fought Pikachu and Snorlax yet?
https://youtu.be/LEAQSc_lICI?t=43s
he will swing at you a few times, but you should survive that.
The trick is to get him to follow you to the gate
if you have already aggroed him before, as in it's your second or later try, you have to run to where you picked up the item and then back to the gate.
I missed a step
just stand directly at the gate, and he will jump at you and miss. He can not hit you.
As soon as you walk through the door, he should aggro by itself and walk towards you.
Just wait. You aggroed him before, right?
If you aggroed him before, just wait at the gate after you entered.
Okay, Endless Unload will become aggro if you pick up an item on an altar in his room. As soon as that happens (his energy bar appears) run back to the fog gate. He will attack you, but miss, and will grab onto the ledge with his hand. Attack the hand a few times (he will not attack during it) and he just straight up falls and dies.
If you want, I can tell you, Zol. Just say the word. It makes the fight a joke, however.
you know the easy kill with lava buddy, right?
Oh, yes, the nonstop cum
Now far?
Oh, nice
Or games like Combat Amphibians.
Pulverize-It Pete
like Demolish-It Dan
Oh, I am not new to those renames with similar meaning.
you are cheeky
GUYS!
Kiki the monkey
What game is that, by the way?
Watch, or Kiri will shoot
big money
777
I bet she slept well, though.
That's adorable.
Looks very interesting, even thought we don't know much yet
I am looking forward to Cyberpunk 2077
Saki likes the button.
Stupid clothes just to be "sexy" without reason.
you know, that is unappealing to me.
is that what you wanted to hear?
wow, what an ass.
likewise, Saki. Only a handful JRPGs really hook me.
I like a good ass, but that's not why I play as them
Watching a woman go from nobody to powerful, famous monsterslayer is great.
Especially in RPGs, with tons of options.
I like playing female protags.
backstabs don't exist in BB
HA
Remember Me? I hardly remember that game
Backstabs are always the secret against humanoid enemies in DS
But the skeleton boi hates me.
when it's colder. I am hardly awake in those temperatures.
I will.
Oh, Farron Keep. yes. Bad memories.
it's a meme now.
No, not really, Saki, is just lagged like fuck on console
what other shithole is there?
But you aren't in Blighttown.
The rage of the Kerrik
You should, Zolg, you'll get the lord vessel, which allows you to warp between selected bonfires.
Ornifex sounds like an Asterix character
and Smough
Ornstein
But the item you get is absolutely worth it.
I beat them on my sixth try. I was on level 99 for all of them.
Oh, and their fight is brutal, by the way.
The twins share a VA with Yui from K-On.
I still hate Goro
Right? Now that I read it, it's obvious, really.
Shinji Ogawa and Akechi Goro share a VA.
Found another!
Fought the twins yet?
Oh, very nice
how far are you in P5, Ibu?
Not any that I know of.
Yeah, Fox and Ver have the same VA.
Was only a matter of time, really
I wasn't. Nana was already a huge Persona fan.
Yep
Yes. Very Hibiki
If you play with japanese voices, you hear them call her Navi.
Oracle is her western name. It's a reference to Batman.
yes, it's futaba
Noir has the most stylish HAT
Those are cool designs


sounds like a blast
Great!
yeah, no. It's still too much money for a game I am really uncertain about.
Maybe if it's on sale I nab it.
And the steam reviews are looking better nowadays.
So, in a way it's like a Bethesda game: Pretty okay, but mods is where it's at.
Hm. You know, the thing with those games is that they can't hook me for long. Like Minecraft. I enjoyed playing it. For a few hours. But with no end goal (which now exists in MC, mind you) it just loses me quickly.
I also don't know what the point of the game is. Is there a bigger goal you work towards?
No, the backlash was enough to make me not buy it, honestly.
You mean the coop now actually works as advertised?
I heard it got a huge update.
They actually fixed stuff in NMS?
Better late than never.
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Oh, those are always great.
Kawakami is where it's at
No, I don't like Futaba that much.
Granted, I was making the game way harder on me by missing a certain point in the dungeon.
The final dungeon.
Yep.
I broke my hand over Persona 5. Was the dumbest shit I ever did.
No, never done that.
At least not on stream.
Luckily I am not a rage guy.
Oh, I believe I remember hearing about that.
He just really likes to catch you rolling
He not that hard in general
I am looking forward to the nameless king.
I know I would fail, as they are a nightmare.
If I had the DLC, I would try.
<@!263983345669505025> I made the highlight of the first try with Iudex and showed it to my buddy. He was impressed
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/289917628
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f49ELvryhao
I am currently on my fourth playthrough of the game.

I still got the iron nails that were in my hand to fix the bone.
I had fun, let me tell you. My hand was swollen, it was numb with irregular stings of pain. Had to get operated on.
yep
Anyway, I was dying constantly, and got so pissed off that I punched my door, and broke a bone in my hand.
The actual final dungeon, 12/24
The steam version is split in part 1 and 2 for the collection, so I assume it's similar
Sadly I don't have a Switch
There are some great games in there.
I considered getting the X collection.
I am, yes
Yeah, I remember my first playthrough of X1. A lot of those game overs.
good
I am talking about the music played when fighting common enemies.
another? could be. The game has a few.
wait
You mean the best battle tune ever?
WHAT?
and amazing battle music

And the question is "what happened?"
How can you not? He looks like a question mark
It is
Skull's posture makes sense later
it's a bit tricky, if you don't have the charger for the subweapons, though
Or Spark Mandril's.
which one?
That's what I did. For me it's the best JRPG ever made
Cease your jests!
Are you insane?? Have you seen those ratings?
Enjoy the best JRPG ever made.
Hell yes!
when you wanna fight the boss is up to you, if you do it in the time limit, of course.
very nice!
The gathering and creating for Personas is fun. You can make absolute powerhouses.
memes never die
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q9SXJZRNCE

Did they seriously reference a meme?
but not on my first playthrough
maybe for shits.
I don't kick doggo
I mean, I don't like dogs, but it's not their fault
why would I do that?
I like when a game can kick me in the balls emotionally
I am very interested.
Apparently Haunting Ground has multiple endings? Well, color me intrigued.
And it seems I have to stream Silent Hill 3 soon.
I think I have to play the game for myself now.
fuck this dude's username
by the way.
I think I heard of that.
see? not dead
Kerrik, seriously, play through his confidant arc.
He is the broest of bros.
Honestly, I never really cared for male NPCs in games, like, I could name maybe two characters that stuck with me, but Ryuji is so fucking great.
Ryuji is biggest bro, by the way.
besides some cutscenes.
There are no benefits for getting a girlfriend in P5.
here is the good part: You don't have to. You are not missing anything.
PS: Don't date them all at once, bad things happen
ALL OF THEM!
But in P5 you can date all the waifus.
cool. I think P5 starts really strong with its first big villain. What a colossal asshole.
Fuck you, cat!
I'd say so.
P5, I mean
Where are you in the story, Kerrik?
Have you played Persona 5, Kriisa?
Nice! Back to stealing hearts!
Because life energy!
yeah, redux was the one for 3ds. It looks really good.
I love that mechanic. Boss is an ass? Well, here are the tools to be an even bigger ass.
That's good
As TVTropes captioned the pic: "He is not joking"

I don't want kind. I want the real deal.
I played the one for SNES. It was brutal. The new one for 3DS looks cool.
Oh, trust me, I want to.
The game's balance is on point, I feel. I never felt like I suddenly got steamrolled by enemies going from one dungeon to the next.
And I never used a guide.
I don't remember having any trouble with any boss in this game, really.
That's good, because this boss is often considered to be the first real hurdle for players.
You really should never look up strategies for the bosses in this game, I find. It spoils the experience. At least for me.
Did the boss give you trouble?
Oh, very nice!
it's 11/13
yep
and fast
If you are near the mid of the game I can tell you an insanely easy way to grind levels, by the way.
and winning, of course
well, I've seen a video of some dude fighting the boss with just Joker.
any time. losing does not mean a game over.
The boss you can fight as soon as you enter mementos
yes, the boss is amazing
Fun fact: The strength confidant is the only one you can finish in one day.
You need a lot of money and the strength confidant at 10
Oh, they are NOT easy. And getting those personas is not easy either.
Not if you damage them enough before 6 turns are over
nope.
The bonus boss? well, if you fuse two personas right you can be immune against everything.
And get the omnipotent orb!
You have to fight the bonus boss!
You will!!!
have fun fusing the persona you get when you beat the game.
yeah.
This will help a lot: https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/#/list
yep. Oh, and if you have a Persona that in immune against physical (I had one at that point, it's not hard), the boss will be a breeze.
Try fusing a Persona that repels bless and/or curse, if you can. When you meet the enemy Anibus, you will know why.
<@!263983345669505025> by the way, you want a little tip for the fourth palace that makes your life a lot easier?
ain't that nice?
Yeah, you now finished the tutorial, so to speak
Stardew Valley finally has multiplayer added.
Like the N. Sane Trilogy. Every game platinum
not in Persona, I found
I got all trophies!
booh!
Hey, it could happen.
yeah. I blast through every dungeon on the first day.
only if you raised them before.
and let's not forget: the confidants level faster too.
because it's so much fun!
Sorry, my first playthrough was over 200 hours ago
oh, right. I did that with a skill.
oh, and he blocks bless and curse, good for palace 4
But you can get him early, and he is immune against any physical, so I was like: "Why not?"
He was at 81 at the end
you can level your personas, you know.
well, "carried" might be a bit too much, but it was helpful
The persona that carried me through the first playthrough was Shiki-Ouji, by the way.
and then have fun as he shreds you.
yep. try staying still for two minutes.
She is lovely and needs support
NO!
Look at her! She is adorbs!
Seriously, what was that reply, Kerrik? Don't tell my you don't like Kawakami.
I think she is adorable
what's wrong?

My choice was Kawakami.
I love that guy
Ryuji is the fucking broest bro.
By the way, Kerrik, do you have a waifu in P5 already?
Hey, they need extra cash
Wasn't Atlus discussing putting P6 out for PC as well?
No spoilers for Kerrik
I would love to play P4 Golden. Why is there no emulator!!!
I know, I wanna play more SMT
The true ending in P5 is not hard to get. The game warns you pretty much.
yep, pretty much
oh, very good.
trust me, you'd be fucking surprised how crazy the story will become. It blew my fucking mind the first time
yeah
Oh, that dude.
What makes you say that?
<@200927407736094721> Like this
Kawakami is just really adorable and cute.
Never, Maria is my number one.
👌


Sorry, I am hooked on best teacher now.
Don't mind her, she just needs her vitamins.
He had some cool shades, though
The one were Hitler was hilariously censored, because of changed japanese laws.
Yeah, that's the one, did not remember the name
A complete story arc removed and the entire first part of the story (as in, the first release of P2, it came in two versions) was never released.
Play the japanese one with a language patch. The english version is butchered.
The line Welcome To The My Palace is what a character says in Persona 2. It became a meme.
Welcome To The My Palace!

yeah, the combat was weird
Oh, I played P2, the original ps1 version, with Hitler in it
It's a bot. It has a low chance to put together random parts from previous comments and post them.
that's an interesting fact, Shirabe.
oh, yes, this person. Did you know that the character was written as a member of the thieves, but was changed during development?
Interesting how everyone is all over Makoto where ever I look. I find her uninteresting as a dating option.
I am a 30 year old baby then
Honestly, it's a good idea.
I believe I know why they did that, same with Kawakami: Because there are players much older than the MC, as such, they would prefer women their age range.
There are even leftover files with love confessions of the "investigator", to avoid spoilers.
Would love to see how that would have worked out. She was supposed to act as a foil to Makoto
<@!263983345669505025> Oh, the Shogi player. Yeah. She was planned as a full member of the team, by the way
Must buy. I love Ryuko. I have a poster of her on my wall
I AM STUPID, IT SEEMS
OH YES!
A fucking KILL LA KILL game!!!!
WAIT!
Yakuza is worth it for the minigames alone.
Yes
Oh, yes, that's a good deal. I payed around that much for the PS4 version.
I don't remember if the game even has multihit instakill moves.
No, but when they hit Joker you're done.
You will meet him again in Mementos.
Anubis has two instakill moves.
Very good! Had any trouble?
Yep, pretty accurate gif
Yeah, that boss can be tricky if you don't expect it
Oh, not bad
What's your opinion on fluff-chan?
oh, wow, you are already there? Not bad!
You have to make them yourself
Oh, by the way, in case, just in case, that maybe, possibly, you wanna play NG+ and go for all infiltration tools, do NOT let Kawakami make them. They don't count towards the trophy.
Protect her.
Kawakami is precious.
good.
Rule of thumb is: The later you get the Arcanas, the easier they are to level.
Tower does level always, I believe.
Moon does not level every time. I remember that much
only four level over the story: Judgement, Justice, Magician and Fool.
Unless you mean automatic as in levels whenever you go to them.
sun isn't automatic.
She is cute, yes. You get her social link after the palace and the corresponding events
<@!263983345669505025> Damn, very nice in both regards.
Nice
Enter his fight, and if the message "The flu brings despair" appears, guard for three turns. If not, escape and refight.
Yeah, too late, I think. You can beat the Reaper easily during flu.
Because of the Reaper.
What date are you at, Kerrik?
You don't have to beat the cages, only play them once <@263983345669505025>
Ha. Too tedious, huh?
Oh, damn. Very nice.
I am a 100% player anyway. So I will do the dungeons.
Not bad.
ah, so it's a choice near the end I make, with the option changing if I completed those dungeons.
I also wanna play Dragon Quest and Spyro next month
very nice
Hm, 8 extra bosses sounds good.
We'll see. If I really like the game I will play it multiple times anyway
But not a hot dateable one.
romance I can live without, really.
points three and four are why the game is a must-play for me
Manual, as any good JRPG should be
NEVER! One save only!
hit me with it
I will stream it, so you can be there live.
downloading the game now. Let's see when I beat it.
When I ask for it. I like to figure stuff out.
Sure, why not? Should be fun
sure
I wanna see how fucking hard it is.
I'll emulate, don't worry
I really want to try Nocturne out
I still have to play it.
oh, boy, imagine that.
visually, I mean
but kinda monotonous. A shame, really
More a labyrinth than a puzzle, yeah.
have you been in the parts where you turn into a mouse?
the running around and figuring out is done, cutting down the time needed to finish the dungeon.
you know how the puzzles work
yep
Especially on your first playthrough
Yep. And annoying, I have to say.
sorry
tomorrow
still at it. And I won't stream today. Too tired
Nocturne? Nope
oh, I can imagine
I am wondering if I should get DQ on PC or console, by the way.
not bad
I'd say strength now
don't know, quite honest.
In fact, I kinda like it
I play Disgaea and DQ, I am no stranger to grinding.
NG+, huh? Hell yes.
I'd still try to do everything.
B2, you mean? Yeah, never got the hype about her either.
Never played the other games in the series.
I never liked the gameplay and setting in Nier Automata.
nice
I am kinda crazy when it comes to Persona 5, by the way. Beaten it four times, over 200 hours of playtime, platinum trophy.
Oh, really?
Btw, I never got the appeal of Nier. Tried it, was meh for me.
Not for long
By realizing that Persona 5 is amazing and the best RPG ever made
Nice
Can every demon evolve, or just Pixie?
Good to know.
I'll stream earlier tomorrow, btw
Very nice!
<@263983345669505025> I really enjoy SMT3, I have to say. The fighting is fun.
<@!263983345669505025>
Streaming Shin Megami Tensei 3
https://www.twitch.tv/outside998
yeah, in around an hour
understandable
EA is a business. They do what's most cost efficient. So, if they do that, it IS efficient
Aren't those totally different divisions?
what does a guy from EA Sports have to do with Time Splitters?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWlmE51efA4
amen
I will never buy EA, no matter how good the games might be.
Everyone hates them, but still buy.
Like EA
He will fall flat soon anough
SHAUN!
He should have stayed with composing
It's apparently Cage's best written work
I still own IP, or Fahrenheit, as it's known in Europe
as in, destroyed
I meant the world
Automata could play in Detroit. Looks the same, really.
2B, yeah. I don't even know her name
live now!
https://www.twitch.tv/outside998
I'll stream longer today, jump in anytime.
good
17:00 for me
one and a half hours
Very nice!
<@!263983345669505025> How's your internet today? Ready for SMT3 in a few hours?
That Gungeon mod has to happen
DON'T!
Well, hostage is dead, that means no leverage. Not a bad idea.
Special announcement? Excite!
<@263983345669505025> look what I got.
But trust me, in NG+ that little rascal gets easy. Even if Kerrik says something else.
Scream boi fucked me up a few times the first time too.
I think I see your problem
