on hard raids 5cp is the most efficient
lol
makes it faster basically
you deal 1x/2x/3x dmg for each tier
guess I can snipe 3rd place on this one without much effort at least
Seriously lol
oh my god these people

where are my g i g a s
oh yay
9point
half..?
teemo hit yours for
guess we'll see if they hit it
my last carol is up
giga miracle #10 /o/
wasn't one of the hackers korean?
I don't think it's separated
banned
I think I'm at 9 now
oh1 from 9point as well
giga miracle x1 D:
mine died also
thanks pie
12x giga miracle now üëÄ
400 gems is 22 rolls
that's avg 1/105 or something
chance is .8%
guarantee
ü§î
true.
where are my melodies heeeeck
*yes please*
i won't even be using them for ages
wish I could give you my crystals 9point lol
is that really worth it
@_@
grats
cause i'm not really running power/int
yeah im not even getting mats i need atm

I saw something worse earlier
got 5 giga melodies
finally
rip me I guess
I used a bunch of gold earlier because I didn't think I would be LU'ing anything soon
thinking

winwin
/o/
if i get banned i can quit
been like this for like 20 minutes
but no friends
I see a bunch of randoms
filter is off
I'm not seeing raids from friends anymore when I refresh
oh wait
w t h
>109 giga melody
~~and gold~~
I actually can't max awaken mine because I'm missing the other type of shard
yea lol
unity shards free
MLB 5* never
wonder how long until I get something to use these mats on lol
@_@
26 giga melody
then I guess maybe I'll just have them for ||xd chris||
They're mats for all the xd units right?
I still don't know what I'm gonna use these on.
I got a 5 drop earlier also
Lol
cheater
hmmhmmhmm
2 giga miracle
d e d
she's at 10k left on my screen
dunno about adds
1.4
yay
I should be able to get hunt bonus on this shinku one
carol is being bonked
somehow it actually showed up for me
this shinku one?
oh
im blind
those are mega
ü§î
more hackers?
~~can be hard not to though~~
~~or if you have more integrity than that, don't take advantage of them~~
start your own too
hoping you'll get one the hackers kill
and tag high HP carols
or if the hackers come back you can take advantage of them
it'll be easier later in the afternoon (US time)
at this time yes
starting your own raid, if you don't do dmg, no one is gonna want to help
just snipe raids that are low hp
no
hm?
f
of hp?
10%?
on my list
I don't have any of these low hp ones
dang
if you do get the bikki LU'd
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
esp when 9point is back on
people will be running them here in a few hours likely
you can snipe raids too
you don't "need" them for raids but they help
in the future? no
right now? yes
yes if you want healers
30-40 on a 3 star is probably like 50-60 mil or something
:x
25mil is not much
but I just don't have enough XP for it
as far as mats go I think I only need 2 more giga melodies
to be cancer in pvp
I'm in the process of ULing all of the healer shirabes
I'm more gated by xp than crystals
at this point
w h a t

I deleted some
guess teemo is too, that makes sense
NerfMe is here
scrolling down my follow list
oh god
I'll make some space
uh sure
with it being so low
usually you would have more people chipping in.
I wonder if they only have it open to friends
though
I've just been using natural stamina on it but if the time goes too low I'll refresh to make sure it dies
it's pretty low now yea
if they didn't get it
I would feel too bad
I wouldn't even try to snipe hunt on this
wonder if they're doing 3cp
31k per attempt
I kinda feel bad for them

need more
I only have two
no
yes
so a 45% heal becomes 60% heal
it adds on to the heal %
banner ends in 9 hrs good luck lol
and you can get a high streak no problem
til you start seeing 3ks consistently
just refresh a bunch of times
if you're in top 100 and you only see high ranked players
I can get my streaks to 20+ without seeing them too
pretty much
,_,
always run into hard counter level 70 erenbikki
I wish I could get to 30 point streaks
because no one is actually playing
i mean, it barely qualifies as pvp in the first place
all ladders are like that in gacha
yea lol
with a level 70 5*
you don't *need* healers to do well in arena atm
I'm assuming the 5* memorias from the gachas come with stories?
no I mean
gotta grab those memorias
you miss the *special events*
if you don't roll every new banner
but
i did not
f
lucker
5 melodies
it is
last time i checked
how well does master do on pink now
and rip pink
lol
to 1 attempting it
you're halfway
yeah ofc
@_@
is that 10cp or 5cp
you do 800k per attempt now
9point i can't believe
ffff
where are my gigas
pretty sure he's asleep ü§î
nice
i managed to hit it when it had 2k left
oh lol
I'm on a random red raid with 450k left
could not :(
one of the first things i tried to do was change icon
I want something that's not >XD
when do we get new icons
she ded
carol is?
if i make rice it'll be with curry though
idk ask the geahs
i'm on turn 18 and everyone is still alive
i decided to eat rice
don't feel like eating rice atm
guess i'll whack it later
the damage was all from the one person though
sry i mean getting obliterated by
im poking that person in pvp
unless I misunderstood
i thought they said you get those refills by using AP though
because I don't have anything to use the mats on lol...
and I'm not really limited by raids
afaik AP is needed to farm challenge cups
uh
it's probably better to use all the arena medals on tea than rice bowls right
hm
f
,_,
I couldn't beat adam
yes
but I need 1 more giga
because I'm busy grinding stones
I'm just using natural stam on it atm
could
gg
hacker :x
r i p
i have 18 miracles but i was never getting heart lol..
about this
rly happy

yeah she's basically rip at this point
i just opened slots if anyone wants to add me
thanks
got it
ok
<@!197516016488677376> can you make room?
red carol drops mats for ignited units
green carol drops mats for XD units
ya
sure, if you have downtime between skills
rip
so i guess i'll just grab hunt on that
mine's at 90k
bullies
all this carol bonking
couldn't think of a reason to have a third one
~~i did limit break on a tree memoria earlier~~
ah
what, was someone attacking it?
no
if you really want lol
im not clearing it
this is so funny to me

got 5 more giga hearts
yay
doesn't always change CD though
the first LU on a character always changes their skills
after that it doesn't change
the increase is on the first LU
xd characters use the miracle crystals
even if it wasn't she'd be bad though
oh right
she'll do like 3000 dmg in one hit then die
Even with the heal down?
I can put some up
are you running more or going to bed
having this problem
is anyone else
i solo'd a normal carol raid for regular miracle crystals and didn't get any
oh lol
@_@
you have a shirabe to LU?
:D
and only got 1 extra chris from 1000 gems
so sad I couldn't break the game's rng
yeah it does
chris x-drive actually looks great tho
*bounce*
Chris tho
and then I solo'd 4 normal carols and I'm still just at 50
I got like 24 total with 19 or so giga miracles
it's dumb
they still won't drop
i've been soloing normal carols for the small miracle gems
???
because i did 225k the attempt before
which is so weird
i only did 125k
rip
nah I missed it
shoulda waited I guess
I'm having some bad rng here
huh, I wonder if I can even get hunt
wonder how long it's gonna be before I can use these mats
chris didn't... :(
kanade dodges wallet
op
gg
hunt pls ,_,
90k left on my screen ,_,
150k
260k
9point's green carol
carol at 356
idr if s1 or s2
bye bye lullaby, uh
~~but go to hell~~
i know xd
where else would they get the phonic gain?
ya
guess i prolly don't have to leave then
i think i've done 150k
how much hp is carol at
and go back in
I never know when I should leave raids
op
~~but someone asked about tsubasa~~
who needs hunt anyways.

is not for that
that time limit
although
I can't check because I finished all of them
I'm just wondering if they have a timer on the mission screen itself
do the MA-1 free missions have a timer on them?
both
atm global is in the position where you either coordinate raids or find randoms that are already at low hp though
yeah that sounds about right
lol
the amt of time left doesn't matter
but as far as publicly visible,
i don't know if there's a way to switch groups or not
without adding them
you will never see their raids
and if someone isn't in your group
that you get arbitrarily assigned to
there are absolutely "groups"
so you have 2 weeks still
the 2/27 time is for presents in mail
yes
teh quest time limit is the one at the bottom
üê≥
They were talking about a boss they don‚Äôt think will die
Highest damage is only if it dies
Contribution always gets rewarded
Those only matter if it dies
But tech is weak to heart ü§î
that was the T one
:D
i misread
oh wait
35 minutes left 38 minutes ago
that dex ended
~~yeah lol~~
whenever her banner re-runs
chris eventually
and nothing to use them on
I now have 30 of these things

if you're lucky maybe you can find it
there's a random dex raid sitting at 150k currently..
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
but if you do hard raids you end up with hundreds of the stuff easies drop
nothing decent anyways
easy doesn't drop anything?
but
sounds about right
would you die earlier on auto battle
do you have to manual that
Yea looks the same to me
"hey please don't do this"
I like how their response was just
did they ban any?
I haven't seen the hackers as much recently
I just joined mousy's with 37k left so i'm like, guaranteed to last hit
rip
maybe I'll do that this week
she's been MLB for a while
I do need to finish my other blue jii
nice i got burned on turn 1
just the two bikkis?
your maria isn't LU right?
lol
thanks /o/
do you kill her before the add goes down
p
2
f
heh
not like i'll ever have a use for them as f2p anyways : )
none
I have decent stockpiles of most things but no magic crystals
oki
ping me next time you do them so I can leech
lol rip..
I never see yours up
rly
I feel like I need giga magic but no one does red carols
the burn really hurts
thought it was only raid you started yourself
didn't know
oh huh
they shouldn't?
for the weekly?
do last hits count?
your damage is miserable in easy raids?
i basically can't survive at all against red carol so rip
didn't ask nicely
they actually

they asked so nicely
:(
they said not to cheat, sanic
b-but
the heck, these emotes are ~~gay~~ cute
if anyone in here wants to follow me
I just removed a bunch of followers
uh looks like it did die now yea
int the worst
send aid

I only put it up 'cause 9point asked, if he decides to bonk it it'll probably die
Yeah I'm going to bed now
also deleted some people <@!197516016488677376>
adds too strong for my sad team
ok red carol is up.
maybe I should ||üê≥||
Gosh I actually do no damage to red carol
I just entered a raid so it'll be a bit
uh sure
kk
I could put something up
I thought they said the cheaters have been dealt with :(
wait
and then today they put out another one that said "hackers have been dealt with."
seems like they're only banning the accounts that actually cheat
and just hope they can find the raid
it's possible they don't even follow the cheater account at all
time to open a bad raid
and they're all 5 hrs left full hp
when it's normally at least 10 lol..
setting filter to all hard gets 2-3 results
like
mfw can't even join in on raids atm because hackers killed literally everything
I'm sure it's someone who saw the "hackers have been dealt with" notification and took it as a challenge
and the chris cards are different levels anyways
you need a bunch of accounts to find all the raids (there's hidden groups, if you're not in the same group as someone you will never see their raids show up without being friends)
doubt it's name changes
so it still counts their damage once they exit but they actually didn't contribute to the death of the boss at all
the other people's damage comes from them being inside and not submitting their scores before the cheater killed it
so if you start it, and then they enter, it's impossible for them to do more damage than what they did
right, the damage counter won't keep going up once the boss reaches 0
i don't put things up normally anyways
guess i'll refrain from putting things up
they're definitely still aroudn
oh yup
Why
Heck
yea some hacker is going around kill things, dunno if they're still doing it
and hexa isn't going to be up 100% of the time right?
but once you finish story and stuff, outside of hexa, awakening dojos are like the only thing to spend stamina on
i've had them drop but it's not common
did you run into me lol
she's cute
wait why
spooky
chris strong
her strength is the tankiness
but yeah, her damage isn't *amazing*
or in raids
you mean for advent?
everyone else barely does damage zz
guess i should kill it now huh
:D
You get more rewards for hitting highest dmg anyways
<@!177328724759281664> I do kill them eventually it just takes a while because I wait for natural stamina
got it
oh ok
you need to make room
<@!177328724759281664> what's your ID? looks like i need to follow you to find it
giga melody?
i don't really need the rewards
start one if you want, i'll pile on it'
grats
trash game tbh
