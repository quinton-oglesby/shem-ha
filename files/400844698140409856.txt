Perfection
you understand it because you've already seen the series, but no one who has seen it could understand something of that
is flip flapper, a series that is not known until advanced episodes, and this image only showed cocona, papika and her mother without any understandable context
nobody who has not seen the series would understand
it's a gold anime
it's a anime from three years ago...and don't have much context so...

"In Japanese lesbian culture, the top and bottom are referred to as „Çø„ÉÅÔºàtachiÔºâand „Éç„Ç≥Ôºàneko) respectively. While theories on the etymology differ, a common one is that is that tachi refers to Â§™ÂàÄ, a type of Japanese curved long sword. So in a way, sword lesbians are a thing in Japan."

I'm not saying they are bad series, in fact I think they have good reviews.

yuri anime pages spam them so much that they take away the desire to see them.

Earlier, I had seen that they shared this image but I don't know if the context is understood.
This image is a reference to the end of the game's last event, LOST SONG 3.
where the last guardian of the multiverse, Amaterasu, makes all the users of alternate worlds gather to help AlterBikki. the original Hibiki is there because she went to find her alter to help her and make her understand that she doesn't need to be alone.

I will never forgive the brain-reset that they did to Jack in the second half of the series
idk...the heterosexual ships fanart about 5D's are good,i suppose because are not kids like the other yugioh...
yeah,Maria drink but the others finish drunk because the ambient and that affect the next day
i guess is a bowser minion.that's who shot hammers?
so,if Maria is mario,Kanade kidnap Serena?
hey! this it's not a bad idea,now i want a saint seiya crossover

overthinking an anime inventing traumas to the characters surely it is
no fantasy is needed to see it when you have an epilogue that shows it to you, to think that there is beyond it is just fan-canon
showing that she has already overcome that stage of her life and is ready to start a new one
I doubt that, since most of her problems she solved, ||both in the series and at the end of the ova, where she leaves her sword and cuts her hair watching how everything his mother did sinks into the sea||
And where are these "traumas" seen in the anime?
And where is she shown to have these traumas?
they should stop thinking of fictional characters as if they were real
I don't agree,satsuki is not a traumatized girl,and think that is just reduce her character and that's more a head-canon

the name of the dead custodian can be "Enki".
the creator of humanity. According to the mythology, it was the only Annunaki who did not want to destroy humanity.||

if I'm not mistaken
Miku and "mirai" (future)
it is pronounced the same or something like that
"To You Alone

The sun begins to set, the wind begins to change
The streetlamps quietly come alight

Anxiety and loneliness
Trying to distract me

I'm afraid now, I'm scared of being alone
The past stares back at me in the dark of night

My hand, my heart, my everything
All for the future

But all I can do now is destroy

The ache in my heart slowly envelopes me
I try to see the night where I'm not lonely anymore

As the galaxy falls around us
I squeeze your hand tightly

I know I can't cry, but...

I'm a tattered, uncool weakling of a hero
Whenever you weren't in danger, I failed to notice your tears

Just by saying that I'd return soon, I was hurting you
I didn't even give you the chance to try and protect me

You thanking me for being born,
All of your spirit, gave me the courage to stand

Now I have to respond to your love

I'm no good with difficult things
I don't know how to say this, but

On this star out of all the ones in the sky
Let's live out our time together

Just joining our hands is a miracle!

My hand, my heart, my everything
Were all for the future

I want to promise an eternity to you
The time that's engraved into your name

Those days where we could just say "see you tomorrow"
Standing in the sunshine, a flower was able to bloom

Let's make our dreams sound out

Let's live our lives together

Being a tattered, uncool hero is fine
As long as I can protect the single person in front of me"
the lyrics for "kimi dake ni" is just scary....
"My lesbian friend was kidnapped" <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
Arc-v has potential but konami prefer sell cards before a good story
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>

<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
for me these discussions with this guy no longer make sense
the same for Nanoha and other fantastic series
I've seen many series that handle the same, for example, the fate / stay night franchise handles the same concepts
"beliefs affect"
you do not really need the keyword to enjoy the series, these are just a glossary, notes that help to better understanding.
but you can see and enjoy the series without reading them
^
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
With love?
I don't know...is really dificult and complicated situation...
those things are ... masks?
that's not the problem, the problem is that they tell you that the characters have a synchronization of the same level as kirika and shirabe from one minute to another without real development
literally in the same chapter add the concept and later they do it
in addition, it feels like they learned to make unison from one day to the next
even in the memories of XDU have more interaction between them
personally the UNISON if they felt very forced.
Maria and Chris hardly interacted, never felt a true "connection between them".
with Hibiki / Kirika, they just said "they can do it with all"
Why do you keep arguing with the same guy over and over again?
FIS was an organization of Fin√©.
the Illuminati were against Fin√©
the three new ones were subject to tests, but not for gear users, but for the Illuminati to find "immortality" or something like that
I like the miku song,
Eiai promise and Wakyou shen shoujing
you should not make an effort to argue with him, he will not change his opinion, say what you say
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
that you do not find the sense to act of a person because it does not match your line of thought, does not mean that it does not make sense

and everyone said it was impossible.
in your damn face!
sorry...i'm excited...
I KNEW IT!!!!! I TOLD YOU THAT CAROL WOULD BE BACK !!!
TWO YEARS SAYING THE SAME !!!
THE BEST FUCKING CHAPTER IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!
XV best season? for me....yes
exactly
a detail,when carol is defeated in GX she no longer has her relic
she comeback
"lulu amelu" is the ancient humanity
for me Tsubasa in this chapter have a big mindbreak
is the next event in XDU <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
literally
No,look the old comments
we already discussed that  <@239893407122718721>
Other discussion with the same guy? And in this channel?
Obviusly
Tsubasa is mind broken
i suppose is because she don't have enough power to transform the body
Carol(GX)
Carol(XV)
my bad so...Dur dabla doesn't burn memories, right?
Dur dabla doesn't burn memories, right?
the Carol's awakening is fault of Millaarc?
no,the second part from Cross ange
i hate the second part
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1162821362387472384
but it's not necessary,i supose
but it is not necessary for Carol to burn her memories, right?
only if she wants more power
<:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
i can't imagine the feeling in the Elfnein character song....
The alchemist power burning memories
The power i suppose
Carol adult body have boobs <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Is the Carol body so...i suppose
She make the pose because she is the antenna
metanoia?
next chapter preview
The amalgam is combine two elements? In this case the symphogear and faust robe
For me,yes
Elsa is the only will have redeption,but i think she die soon...
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>

The situation with miku and hibiki feels like the ShirouXsakura in heaven feels movie
Dr. Jail scaglietti
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
miku and hibiki end up dying and ascending to another existential plane
They are besties
that's sound like a shipping name
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
Because Elfnein
choice a one channel! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Kazanari's DNA
good bye this channel and twitah
XV in a nutshell

LEWD!!!
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
AHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I like the Ca-Rol-Oh with elfnein
Imagine that The 13th chapter it will last 40 minutes
Is more like similar the aegis gear
gay and lewd
I'll go
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well...Edward Elric make it that too
someone translate the asumin comic? i don¬¥t find it
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
i repeat.
Miku and Hibiki become in a concept and live in a diferent dimension of reality.
with love forever
it's hard think than XV is the last season...is much to explain in only 5 episodes!
"b*tch,I'm Fabulous!"
Fuudo would not seek the power of God because for Adam
Adam reveal the power of god to the world and Fuudo
extended final with 40 minutes chapter when?!!
is diferent make a computer than repair or add something

is the SSJ,because the patron
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I remember The simpsons
Where?
Wath censorship?
STOP THAT!!! Miku CAN'T DIE!!!

Tsubasa really enjoyed episode 8 <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
For some reason,Shem-ha's voice is similar to Miku...<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556> 
https://twitter.com/miyuki708/status/1165324445369565184?s=09
||Miku: Hibiki,why don't respond me...Hibiki...why i' crying?!||
||the end of XV is very similar to Devilman||
<:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
let's not be pessimistic, let's have a little faith in Kaneko and Agematsu
Exactly, so far they have done well but I hope they don't end up ruining everything
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Hibiki sacrifice?!
Hibiki will kill her but she won't
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
time to save for the XV unit in the game,if start now can be easy take al the units!!
I have a question,XV(15) will be "mikusan"?
XV will be "mikusan"?
In Japan gambling is prohibited, that's why pachinko is so popular.  and currently gacha games too
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
damn you,CR!!!
Why? <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I've seen several doing that
"secret melody" in FINAL COMMANDER?
I saw 3 documentaries about the Anunnaki, where they explain that they are aliens.  symphogear I think it combines both mythology and "science"
In the first chapter reading paper
Same
you have the live version
Fuudo vs Gen?
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
She did nothing wrong
Protect Elsa!!
Chris parents
Discussion with thesame guy
It is always the same discussion with the same guy.  and keep answering, just ignoring it he always generates stupid debates
I think something similar, like the "curse" is not really a bad thing, but a desperate measure of Enki for us
?
other thing...The kazanari's family is desendant from demons
but noble red don't have Blood so...
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
and other thing...Noble red is dead?
It's a long thing but one of the things I said was that the "curse of Balal" was not really a "curse"
I just watched the episode and it seems that the theory I had is being real
https://www.facebook.com/SymphogearYuri/photos/a.202082649915373/1201440563312905/?type=3&theater this is my theory,if anyone want know(use google translate-san)
"give Hibiki her sunshine back!!!"
the only line in this chapter
poyo <:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
on i see,thanks
the Ame-no-Habakiri and murakumo isn't the same sword?

<@468591607332208641> ,He died before she won an award for being a great singer
*insert Yaranaika face here*

<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Where are Carol/Elfnein in thus chapter?
fly...me to the moon~ ‚ô´  <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
maybe Enki left a message engraved on the moon explaining his reasons, I bet
"no,is just a simple sword design" <:Ver:336656981144109066>
One guy said it was a simple design for a sword.
A GIANT BLUE FIRE SWORD
what do you think of the design of Amalgam Tsubasa ?
To all this, where was Carolnein?
Damn...Kaze No Anata Ni lyrics is just...so much for me
And Nanoha
fu**ing cliffhangers!! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

she's making a chimera?!!
personally, I can't think of any context for this episode...
GOOOOD!!!! the geah in the moon?
Carol is sleep again?
i love yubel
*rocketo panchi*
Shem-Ha smiling is cute
that's crazy :v
a tattoo on his forehead that increases his powers?
literally,the same thing :v
the end will be the same as kill the kill, the gears will disintegrate upon entering the atmosphere.
Elfnein: Carol wake up, they are destroying the world!! <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241> 
Carol: 5 more minutes... <:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
It is more than clear that now "the curse" was for some benefit of humanity or to protect it from something related to what Shem-Ha wanted to do.
Enki rebelled at Shem-Ha and that's why she wanted to kill him
reminds me of the problem of homunculus of FMA
yes
Vanessa is now a Swiss army knife
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
is an Annunaki arm
an then,the Airgetlam is literally the Arm of enki
I feel that the curse of balal was something to weaken Shem-Ha.
And how powerful was Enki?
I hope they give us a kind of flashback about all this
One is a Relic and other is a gear
Chris does use de Nehustam and the Ichibal
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
i never see that
how?where say that?
When they say that Kirika can kill souls?
They never say it's forever, she simply decides not to revive.
but Carol maybe can create Faus Robes
My theory is as follows:
-Airgetlam is literally Enki's arm.
-With that arm Maria can control / activate the lunar base technology.
-Maria will use that to avoid Shem-Ha's plans. (May die)
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i know
no,its the truth
is not "very familiar to a lot of stories"
a lot of stories are very similar to the gilgamesh story
it's not a "generic".
is the original story
the story tells the friendship of gilgamesh and enkidu and how he suffered his loss.
Hibiki is a descendant of Gilgamesh?
inmortality
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Gilgamesh relick when Kanako?!!!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
nice
i think "climax" is best
dude...that's hurt,I'm surprised she didn't break his neck
Hibiki like bondage? <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
<@204501539308568577> yeah,i know. But everyone knew that she like the "Gohan and gohan!"
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I'm waiting that shinais
i suppose...
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
i love the smell of the new emotes in the morning
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
LOVE...IS THE ENERGY!!!! AAAaaaaAAHHH!!
yeah,the abnormal ship in symphogear is a straight ship
depend the series i suppose
i think Fujitaka is gay <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
reforcing the friendship
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I Don't think that need an explanation
She's the most powerful character in the series. She's GOD
i suppose that line refer to this:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shem_HaMephorash
why not? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
tecnically,thats count like an UNISON?
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
i'm waiting for this
Tecnically is world domination
Shem-Ha Miku's smile is cute too
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
||and is best||
the amalgam is the replacement of ignite
Aoi have nice draw
Exactly
I guess it is because her brain is still in need of blood, I doubt that gasoline is a good replacement
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
is a saint seiya reference!
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
agematsu said it would be the last season of symphogear ...
And if there really will be another season, but this one won't be called "symphogear"? !!!
<@284390402210136064> is the power of symphogear combined with the power of filosophycal stone
If cross ange have.
Symphogear should
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm scared
XV chapter 10:
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
I remember when yoko-san shot balls of the grapekun noise
thanks for making me feel bad
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
for me,Miku was like that all the time, since her songs sound like a Yandere
my problem with Adam is that he was a super powerful monster but he did almost nothing, he spent it in his bathroom with Tiki when he could obviously have easily killed the users
the different is Shem-Ha isn't a horny (i think...)
Goodbye this channel
Shem-Ha vs Hibiki:
- Give up Hibiki, I'm stronger.
- never! You killed Miku!
- No Hibiki ... I am Miku !!!
- NOOOO !!!!
What if Shem-Ha cheated Fin√© and turned her against Enki, and as payment for her help Shem-Ha taught him about his method of "resurrection"
stop bullying....
i watched the chapter...Shem-Ha is waifu ‚ù§
ADam hates custodians and was looking to do an army in case they (eventually) return.
not against Shem-Ha specifically, I think I shouldn't explain something as simple as that
that you can't read between the lines?
because Adam hate every custodian,not only Shem-Ha

Tiny Millaarc! <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Shem-Ha for XDU when?!!
i lke the Maria's amalgam suit
the sound that Nana made in that scene was very funny
Tsubasa: Maria,you wanna F-...?!!!!
Maria: NO!!
LOL
and frontier was for the Fin√© dead
yeah
lol

<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
really,Melua?!

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
it's a funny scene

i prefer this
look the tweet
https://twitter.com/Story_terrorV2/status/1172909335489331200
...that is a "NO"?
yeah the 11
someone have the clip with Maria hitting Basa with sound?
but unfortunately for Shem-Ha, fine did not achieve his goal
I think Fin√© was Shem-Ha's "safe play."
so if she died, Fine could destroy the moon and if she succeeded, Shem-Ha would revive.

easy


because Enki could not explain to Fin√© his plan and so he must know that Fine would feel bad
tecnically,TRIGGER don't have power over FRANXX,they only did the animation,not the direction
i want play WA Xf for psp so,is good game?
technically, the power of alchemists is similar to phonic gain
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
most plots in light novels are all same plot
Fin√© have good taste

IKEMEN ninja clan!!
I guess it was the only one of the Ogawa brothers who left the clan

yeah,in the keywords and the game
chibi Millaarc

my little child <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
better?
ironic
i...don't want....
<@293701259599544323> hibiki
what if...Enki is alive?

the main story of the XDU with the serpent "jormungand" and the alter Fin√©/bell
of pure luck they hold hands
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
But now she have a Maria

When are the advances coming?
Exactly,i hate the AXZ arcs
The last....
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Enki can't use the regenerator power in the battle with Shem-Ha because was a battle of gods?
i'm expected something like this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ZjTUy-gJc
someone have the link to the symphogear radio?
That never was comfirmed
i'm ready
goodbye this channel
the gears was destroyed?
other series without the name "symphogear" but in the same universe!
just beautiful!!
goodbye symphogear ‚ù§
i suppose is hard fix something you don't know
The gears were destroyed?
i'm expeced the shinais
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
i'm wanted the amalgam Maria in the game
It seemed strange to me when I saw it, but for some reason they subtitled the "metanoia"
Never foget
garupan is so low because some reasons about production and cost...
that does not mean that she did not feel something for Fin√©, remember that she cried with her death
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
*hibiki...*
Is more simple and the character are make it for be stereotypical good girls and because that is more popular
love live is more "mainstream" in a comercial way
Now they stop saying that Kirika "killed" Fin√©'s soul?
?
Airmaster
Aoi as Okita souji is like Hibiki+Tsubasa fusion
Kaneko say that?
like Tsubasa in her attack?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Nana is the most powerful character in the world!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*japan is weird*
xD
so...symphogear was a mistake?
Shem-Ha
no,she have the God power
If the first BD has already gone on sale, does it mean that there is already a first XV shinai?
i wonder,what happen with the Enki's body?
yeah,that CR is an horrible edition
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
"you're stupid but are MY stupid"
Yeah but is interesing
Yagakimi final and XV promocional
?
but that pics is not make it by Asumin
The characters watching TV pictures
The other images don't have TL?
YT have already updated the keywords?
according to the episode, it was found in the Vostok lake of the Antarctic
Was the scorpion inside of tiki?
Maria and Serena country was a war zone
Tiki was an "Special" autoscorer,is different to the Carol's autoscorer
Is the alchemic gold of AXZ supposed to be a "previous" version of amalgam?
Babylonia Gilgamesh is vest gilgamesh,i wonder how is the symphogeah gilgamesh? Would be interising
i suppose is a suit like power rangers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Code Lyoko
i watched one called Bdaman
<:CarolBullying:816901978432733194>
fuck,hillarous show...i'm old...
in my country was called "Kid Muscle"
I stopped seeing her since I knew it would not be yuri.
I didn't even watch the second season and I'm not going to.
The most discared kyoani anime
"i was a boring salaryman and now i'm the demon king"
"i was a otaku virgin and nini but now i'm the legendary hero with a harem"
literally, a self-insert
that's secure but when the major part is a shitty and waifu/harem generator they end up dragging the goods
the problem is the modern animes
"7 childrens are transported to a different and unknown world where they learn and explore how work"
digimon is an isekai too and is good
more than "Hate" is tired of a lot of shit animes about a "i'm reincarnated as the most weaked but later i'm the most stronger in this generic JRPG world"
idk, i just hate actual isekai anime
<:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>
the worst part is how affect the fantasy anime
log horizon has good start but in some parts is boring
and we can forget the last trending: made the JRPG isekai but more "edgy" with blood,gore,rape,etc because is more "mature"
so far,the only isekai who has done something different has been Youjo senki
