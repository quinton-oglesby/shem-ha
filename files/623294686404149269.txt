<:Ver:704169051391524875>
my evil plan is working

Until she gets hit by Chris
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
The gay pact
but will they let you? I don't think so
~~Tsubasa wishing she was in between~~
oh... I thought Chris was bigger
yes
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
em... phyrra?
<:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
Kanade proteccs people by stabbing them with her gear
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
_ohno_
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
that explains why Tsubasa was so fixed on her during s1
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
time to burn like Carol's dad
> don't we all have that type
not me <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
yep
Shirabe's like Tsubasa's little sister
I haven't inmersed into the whole lore because I was in extrem mode watching Symphogear due to uni starting
idea
thanks for the info though I had no ide
"hello darkness my old friend"
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Kirika's a robot?
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>  did I miss something?
robokiri?
how lewd they're touching fingers
> No, I cannot, UH. it was gore and I blocked the guy.
oh...
uh... no, but you can share whatever thing you just saw and make us all suffer with you
<:ChrisEmbarrassed:738167509869527060>
pog
that looks like the op of Fate carnival phantasm
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>  nuuuuuuuuu
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
I'd rather Chris but pog
> This because Hibiki talk with her in her mind,like Tsubasa with Kanade in the first season
_ohno_ I just imagined Kanade appearing in Tsubasa's mind while she's doing the iddly diddly with Chris or Maria, Idk both ships work for me
is the event/part still not over?
so it's an unknown status?
or just dissapeared?
but that Miku from edgebikki really commited dead?
I differentiate by the hair lol
Yeah, longer hair
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
And never will
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Uh... let's see...
I-
Yeah, no wonder Basa goes after females <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Yeah
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
Which makes me wonder where the hell was her mom? Did she played dead and won?
I think it's because Basa just wanted love
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
> Basa's uh- dad isn't that bad
Sure, I,traumatized my daughter by mistreating her but it was for her own good
Pog
I blame the entire Kazanari family except Genjurou and Basa
I blame Fudou
Basa be like "I kidnap Miku, but then I save Miku"
> The one where they're children is the saddest one because that nearly happened if it weren't for Fine
Well at least we have the au
Dess
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
And I'm... 
1. Lazy 
2. Studying
That'll mean I'll have to either play the game or do an extensive search for that specific moment
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Now I want to see that
eventually someone will do it
nah too much work for me
time to write a fic about it
my dreams have come true
yay
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
pog
they could've raised Chris together and ship her with Basa
that was sad <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
I really felt like Ryouko was in love with Genjuro
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
agreed so much
yeah it looks like it
Maria be enjoying having Basa clinging to her lol
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Having fun with sword girl
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
If you talk in code it's safe... _maybe_
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>  not a fan of that but if you add the "other type of sword" I'll let it pass <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Metaphorical enough to be in nsfw
<:ShemHaTilt:729980149529051156>
Yes
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
"Sword"
Wouldn't the swordbreaking hurt tho?
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Or just love?
Her shirt says "Chris lover"?
Awwww
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738> <:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
Same tho Idk if I can just let it slip <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
I mean... given how she was treated I'm surprised Gen didn't took her away from Yatsuhiro in the og
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>
For real? She ran away?
Well it makes sense lol
What
Wait so that means Gen took Basa away from Yatsuhiro?
So even with that trauma, she still got to experience love
Yes but Gen gave them stability and all
Since Gen raised them both
True
Specially with Chris
I mean she trains with Chris and Gen to gain stamina
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
Zenbu
The difference is that both will punch the living hell out of their enemies if disarmed
So normal Basa is going to use a stick/sword and au Basa is going to beat her with her fists?
<:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>

so... puberty hit?
<:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
Basa went bad again?
I'm saving that one
~~I thought it was implying to be her kid~~
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>

I'm pretty sure Shirabe wouldn't mind to get on a bike with Basa
Maria needs a father for the zababies
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>

<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Homura don't!!!
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
happy Chris is good civ
yay
"we're not here to discuss your issues"
when they're training in the beach in GX
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
that was cute
I like it when Maria put her glasses on Basa
producer Maria
_cries in the corner_
I felt so blessed and it's an edit
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
god damn <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
lol
I'm saving that one
oh Maria, you are so stylish
hahahaha
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
so you want couple stuff for valentine's?
when your dork of a gf gets surprised by everything
her brain is parted between Tsubasa, and the zababies
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
_I am the bone of my sword_
the rest of the time everything's fine
the bikes only get destroyed when they're used as weapon
can't say destroy other things because it's sfw
it's Maria
lets destroy a bike
they're outside the school waiting for the zababies
plus she had her eye on Basa before
and didn't want Kirika or Shirabe to take that risk
cuz she's the older one
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Maria and her seduction techniques
on a date with Basa
nah
now I'm hungry
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
DESS
just like papaBasa
she will still find a way to have an accident
lol
googled it, I hate it
yooo, those exist?
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>  "buy training wheels for those motorcycles, Tsubasa!" 
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>  "but motorcycles don't need..:" 
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>  "do it now" 
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>  "yes honey"
because she thinks the zababies don't know how to ride
Maria makes Basa buy bicycles with training wheels
she gets to keep those motorcycles
then Basa still wins
she'll be like "buy bicycles"
she'll send Basa to give those bikes back
Maria wouldn't allow that
she had crappy parents <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
not her fault tho
Basa is the irresponsible parent
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
that or I spend it going to the arcade
well yes
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
smh
and Basa said nothing about it
she bought candy
remember when Maria told her not to buy candy and what did she do?
also I wasn't expecting Maria to be the eldest one of the gears lol
I swear the first time I saw them I thought they were like 13
ain't gonna risk anyone else taking Basa away from her
waka waka
lol
_ohno_
you broke the bot
You killed it
Yeah do it
No one judges in the nsfw
Awwww
What's name?
Now I need to see
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Why haven't I seen those memorias?
Well damn, we now need confirmation if Maria is like Chris and likes Basa or not
No?
Uh...
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
And Basa is an airhead
Chris is in love with Basa <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
You mean you don't do it?
Yes
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Tfw she really has feelings for Basa
And scored super high?
So she thought of Basa
Bruh
Bruh hahaha
So she's practicing for Basa?
Ah I see
Bruh
What memoria?
I'm saving
_producer-kun_
Yatsuhiro be like "this guy's gonna be your papa, your mama, your bodyguard, your nanny, your pet, and whatever else"
why... also thanks for the info lol
they time traveled?
what the?
so that's how Fudou used to dress in his young days
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
now I see
yeah doesn't ring a bell
bruh
edgy emo characters
ooohh
you ruined her
yeah
you know you want to search for it
like in his twenties
oh I imagined him as young but not a teen
yes
I imagine young Fudou having the same VA as Kirei Kotomine
like Gen but woman
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
she was related to Kanade
<:FudouSmile:672848303632678942>
yeah the mother of Yatsu and Gen was probably a pro wrestler
waifu
Gen looks like his mom
and the samurai aura
I think it works for the shitpost or hieroglypsh
eh Basa is hotter, pretty, handsome (sometimes)
but male
yeah I was going to say he might look more like Basa
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
imagine Fudou being super handsome in his younger years, then you'll be conflicted about it
what, did you want a young Fudou?
Yes
Fudou will be pleased
Basa getting so many ships <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Finally
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
Too bad, now you'll ship
Would you rather Basa x edgeBikki?
Maybe something happened in Lost Song?
It*
Just embrace ig
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Maria and Chris should hug Basa
lol
holy shit
maMaria being a mama and a pillow and a gf
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
why is Basa crying?

<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>

A fated girlfriend
And got the girl of her dreams
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Kek
Aka Vivios' fated partner
~~yes I am aware of the entire plot, let me dream~~
That moment when their love created a kid
maMaria
Awwww

<:ShirabeHeart:738932033635483738><:KirikaHeart:738932018116821034>
Happy family
And their kid, Vivio!
Fate!
Nanoha!
makes sense
such a wholesome way to wake up
I wonder what they're saying
Tsubasa is a senpai and a kouhai at the same time
it's TsubaChris sunday?
TsubaChris is like that super cute couple, while TsubaMaria is that mature couple
Guess their love really bloomed
RIP
She broke her wrist
and then realize they are sisters
what's the sauce?
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
ah yeah, 10032 is the little sister that's jealous when someone else talks to her big sis
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
I hope she pays on dates tho
She asks MaMaria
Ah so that's how she cleans
<:TsubasaDere:768545990495961129>
nooooo, that means none of the gears were born
uh....
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
given that Serena is even older than Basa
ok but in all fairness, wouldn't it be a safe couple?
_when someone bullies Fate_
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
damn they lookin' good dressed like that
I do wonder why Basa and Maria wore pants, and the others wore shorts
apparently not
She probably didn't believe her
Lol
Oh right she believes in Santa
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
It's MGLN tuesday?

<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
it's not Fate's nor Yuno's fault that Nanoha got so fixated on Fate
if Yuno can't get the Nano, he'll get the Stern
lol
figures
I think so
_I am inevitable_
she has so many roles
lmao
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>

the fact that she's with Maria there tho
wouldn't Basa be the commander tho? Since it's a family business?
I love how that image gives the vibes that Maria is the one that leads the relationship and Basa is like "silently nods"
apparently so
didn't she lose the left one?
and she lost the wrong arm too

yeah, but it would be spoilers to tell you about Vivid so....
Vivid and Vivid Strike follow different stories in which Nanoha is not the MC
those 3 I mentioned are the ones that follow Nanoha
well.... you can watch Vivid and Vivid Strike, but honestly meh
season 1: Magical girl Lyrical Nanoha 
season 2: Magical girl Lyrical Nanoha A's 
season 3: Magical girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS
as in:
you can watch the 2 movies that animated season 1 and 2 or just watch it seasonally
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
watch Magical GIrl Lyrical Nanoha
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
oohh based Saten
<:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
I recommend watching the anime and then watching the movies
yeah I guess lol
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>  I honestly don't know, I think those are based off the game
and 2 other movies with a different type of story
yeah
the mangas for the movies add some bonus stuff and explain some other things too
the official ones are more like bonus content
yeah that's pretty much the order, you can read the mangas and spin off later on if you want
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa I c
you missed the 1st one
smh

can't she pray?
lmao

||You mean because of V?||
<:Gilthink:675222235216347147>  shit good question
wait, is this comic implying that Tsubasa is at Maria's (and the zababies) apartment?
fuck yeah Bazzet!
Dante knows da wae
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Maria got more aggressive with each passing time <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I mean Tsubasa probably forgot to pay child support for the zababies
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
or maybe Tsubasa hasn't paid the child support
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
or probably because she got a call from school, regarding the zababies being bad students and now she has to punish them
because Tsubasa is dense
fair lol
lol
but still why
ah didn't read that part
why is pup Maria flustered?

I wish it was as you say tbh, they both know I'm not smart
But I tend to make my problems small because I tend to think other people have it worse, so now I'm feeling stupid for coming and ranting here
I want to pass them all so I'll have only 1 year and a half left
Yeah, the exams for the end of semester
My parents have me super fed up, like it's as if they don't care if I pass my exams or not. My dad is not talking to me and my mom annoys me with every little thing she can, and she knows I have to study and put double the effort, but it's like they don't care
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Ranting about irl life
Wat. But ok
So question, how serious can the convos be here?
There are some sketchy dudes outside my apartment, knocking at our neighbors' door. My dad doesn't want to call the cops in fear they might do something to us later
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>  gonna wait till it has more
so uh... how many episodes has so far Kumo desu ga?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

Someone will have to continue it with a fanfic maybe lol
Why did Force got cancelled?
Unless you didn't ship NanoFate, then watch it to complete their story
Now watch Strikers so you can complete the ship cycle
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
tbh I'm waiting for it to have more chaps
but it connects to the next work Zetai shoujo
plus the manga ending is trash
||Chikane the psicopath and the raping ||
<:FudouSmile:672848303632678942>
lol
the manga is brutal tho
lol
Kannazuki no miko
this one still makes me cry from time to time
the time has come, time to start watching Kumo desu ga
agreed
spider Bikki

<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

latest Egg episode: <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
didn't he learn about the truth in HF? the VN I mean
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
the Kumo desu ga ep left me with so many questions
I guess it's because of that
And now they look the same way they look in the manga
Cuz WIT made them super handsome and all
same

<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>

<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
||then who lays eggs to produce more spiders? ||
ahhh
||the other personalities of Kumoko die? ||
nooooo why!!!!!
<:TomosatoStare:688429724233629772>
||like why does Demon lord has Kumoko's memories about the classmates ||
doesn't mean I don't have brain farts about it
I do know
I have so many questions regarding spider isekai <:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
it
dew ir
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
||so she first is half spooder, and then she's full human?||
||will we have that tho? ||
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
so she really did say that
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>

Ikr
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it was all good during the times Shun and the others didn't appear
welp I just watched Kumo's new ep
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I'll keep bonking you
<a:TamaBonk:718865514058874930>  no crab here
Yeah
Makes sense
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Is he even walking?
she talks like a spooder talks
a mutant cockroach
but the opening for 1st season and the ending were awesome
it got worse when they reached earth
Terraformars also got into unlimited hiatus
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
and i still don't know ||if Nobara died or not ||
oh no
that's really gonna hunt me in my dreams
fuckin hell
lol
Idk, should never googled Terra formars in images
and apparently later on they made mutant cockroaches mixed with humans
<:TsubasaShock:689705053401251867>
God damn
no way! Is it finally releasing as a full manga? Or it's just the one-shot?
same bro
gonna do that after watching the last ep
yeah
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
the worst part is they don't know when it will air
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
what the fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Oki, thank you. Accept this fish as thanks <:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
And pretty cure is like magical girls?
Aahh
Because someone is confusing me in another server and they won't stop chatting about pripara and I wanted to add pretty cure to my watch list and now I'm like <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Y'all, someone explain to me in simple words, pripara and pretty cure, are the same thing? Or different things?
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Welp after I read what you wrote I'm not even hyped up for the final ep
Ah lol
I think you're referring to Tokyo Ghoul?
Tbh sometimes is the problem of creating og content and then stick to the source material for a next season and you have everyone who only watched the anime confused lol
Imo, maybe they are just trying to play it safe with creating their own og content
unless they don't plan on doing a 2nd season
that's my point
yeah, but why change the story? I'm not saying you can't adapt something that already exist, but why change the story
just make an entire different show then
I get it, but why bothering with animating a thing that already exists as a manga, and then be like 95% loyal to the source so then you can go and change it?
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
and skipped some important stuff
they went with og content
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
they also managed to ruin Shadows House so....
wat
I'll just forget it entirely
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I want the time I spend watching it, back
Man
So we're left with nothing at the end?
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
I swear to god if they say they're gonna release another ep to make up for this I'm going ballistic on them
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Bruh
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
They didn't like the ending?
They already published the preview
Oh damn
What?
Looks like Pop Tem Epic style
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Ah
When does it air?
||We'll finally know if Nobara died or not|| <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
does someone have any opinion on Ergo Proxy?
time to finally watch it then
so I have time to read the manga before it airs

in game Rin explains it better honestly
||she's still some sort of a vessel at the end of HF, so she's like a super source of mana||
honestly Idk, I'm just recently playing the game. Maybe the odds weren't in his favour like in HF
I hope that explained your 1 and 2 lol
||because here Sakura is literally the holy grail/Angra Manyu. And in this route Zouken also makes his move ||

Nah jk. I'll just have to cope I guess
I'll prepare my guns to bomb them if it's a bad ending
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
Will it have a good ending or a bad one
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Jesus christ
Why can't they let them have happy endings
Smh
Yet again another Homu case
She's gonna go Homura and become obsessed
Why they want Takina to suffer god damn
