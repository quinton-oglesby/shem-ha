Will do, you have a good one.
If you put it that way, I respect that, I'll put my vote towards putting the response out there. And of course I'll let you know what I think after reading.
Oh and I will give it a read over myself if you wanna drop a link, it's been forever since I've indulged in any fan writing for anything it should be fun.
Just keep in mind you can't please everyone all of the time and you don't *need* to justify yourself unless you really feel the need to.
Well. I haven't read your stuff admittedly but I've seen you talking about this and just to share as a fellow person who likes to write stuff. Obviously these are pretty sensitive subjects and worth some consideration, which you've clearly given it in spades. It's really up to you if you put a statement like that out, it's a decent hardline to put out there to show you care about it but at the same time people will no doubt pick it apart if they find an issue with your stuff in the future.
