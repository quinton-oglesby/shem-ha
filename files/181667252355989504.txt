ya know?
either way its cool
based on some theorycrafting i just did
shes probably 20 going on 21 in G
we have no way of pinpointing marias age
no
^^^^^^^^^^^^
REMEMBER?
SEASON 1 HAD A TIMESKIP
BUT WAIT
american school has 4 years of highschool not 3
yeah 2nd year sorry LOL
o wait no nvm
she graduated in G specials
i think she was in 3rd
k
i thin
they said so starting s2
yeah
a year? 8 months?
how much time passed between S1 and G
start the timeline in a year that fucking makes sense
ok?
for kicks.
just
...ok so lets say season 1 was in 2014
oh wow only a 8 months between g, gx, and AXZ
o.O
he said so in an article i believe
its like only 3 months or something
what is that
we have a time between season 1 and season 2

I mean really it doesnt matter
just that it might be a bit cooler
i never specified winter
i mean over all its not really that big of a deal
:)
more like september weather
so its probably colder there in august
symphogear takes place in japan
japans weather is different than ours here in america
marias birthday is in august
ooo
i remember now i was thinking "hm chris has been in school a while.."
OH YEAH I FIGURED THAT OUT LIKE MONTHS AGO
shes graduating this year
^ chris's birthday
https://i.imgur.com/ixFFH7e.png
so shes same year as bikki
er
(2nd year)
chris is a sophomore i thought
it makes sense!
HA
then season 3 she turns 19
shes 17>18 in season 1
tsubasa is turning 18 in season 1
but during it it was correct, start of season 1 she was 17
the END of season 1 is july
HAAAAAAAAAAA
AHAHHAA I DID IT
I HAVE A TIMELINE
so end of s1, july (2014)
season 2 ends same year (november-december)

6 months, gx (june 2015)
and then 1 month (august 2015) is AXZ

TO G
3 MONTHS FROM END OF SEASON 1
CONFIRMED
OK
i believe
she turns 19 in GX
? basa isnt 19 in g
now when does season 2 start~
late june early july
sooo that puts season 1 around late june

blahblah
"i cant believe its only been 3 months"
and bikki goes
so they joined lydian and miku and bikki were talking
miku said that
and it was about 3 months from them joining lydian
i...think..so? it was like 2 months
theres a short skip between that and the final cut of them coming back
the event of her activating gungnir and the time of their "death"
i've been playing it since early 2011 :D
