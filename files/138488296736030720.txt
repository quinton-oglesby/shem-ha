Happy birthday sword
From the XV team:

http://www.symphogear-axz.com/news_181210.php  

XV has been delayed to July
Kinda late, but here's Kanade's birthday
https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/06/28-1/symphogear-xv-and-symphogear-axz-are-coming-to-crunchyroll?utm_source=community_cr
Crunchyroll has announced that they will be releasing XV subs ~~For better or for worse~~
XV is going to be the grand finale of Symphogear
`TV„Ç¢„Éã„É°„Ç∑„É™„Éº„Ç∫Á¨¨5Êúü„Å´„Åó„Å¶Â†Ç„ÄÖÂÆåÁµêÔºÅÔºÅ`
if they don't know, they probably don't need to care
people should be smart enough to know
like I said
people *should* be smart enough to figure it out themselves
you want it to be `YameteTomete(Subbing group that did the shinais)` on the sidebar?
what...
also Yamete Tomete the the line Bikki shouts at Miku to stop hitting her in the first shinai afaik
YT became a thing
and boom
***might aswell do it ourselves***
*shit, nobody is going to sub the shinais*
one day half of us were like
hmm
the origins
we're a subbing group
mate
it's been there since it was made
`@YameteTomete - Members of [YameteTomete]. Has the ability to post in #announcements and nothing else.`
it's already a thing <:GarieCute:255583678757863425>
<:DEDEDESS:230494351560540160>
It‚Äôs on the other server but nobody really pays attention to it anyways
Level up notifications get annoying fast
<@400844698140409856> what‚Äôre you after
For the sake of categorisation they should be there own two seperate channels
Every time I open it up I‚Äôm either very interested or very disappointed
Me personally I‚Äôm not very interested in the fanfic talk in the channel but heavily interested in figure conversations
Is there a reason <#458060276550336522> is a combination of two completely unrelated things? Every time there‚Äôs activity I‚Äôm never sure if I‚Äôm going to see stuff about figures of fanfics
I can‚Äôt wait to rep my favourite pancake
Sign me on once it exists
Elfnein has a role
<:ChrisShocked:398799223052566528>
You can somewhat read it
Just use a aqua blue
Lol light mode
We cover all time zones
Remedy the mod problem by giving YT staff ban powers for emergency situations, none of us will actively police people but we‚Äôll have the emergency powers
Put subs at the end of @ YameteTomete so normies stop asking what YT is
Saki just refrained from using it on Joe and I's wishes
this has been a thing for a very long time
<:Thonk:475840588583796736>
I've had that one since that came out
Yeah the *one and only* alright <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
Hey. I know you <:15min:346838673096048641>
We won‚Äôt get to see the poor bloke‚Äôs response
Best to move channels now
I might get the figma
Dw mate it‚Äôs k
<:ChrisUpset:231430246983794688>
Is this ment to be an indirect bully?
Coolio
oh Yoel is here now
Pretty sure all the shinais were done by H&D or commie
GX was done by H&D
Under the yamete tomete release
Just search up shinais on nyaa
Ugh
<:40wave:425688663939219476>
I don't use USAGS but I usually here good things
hmm weird
The guy who owns it reply‚Äôs to emails afaik
Contact usags
I got my hobbystock chris shipped after a whole week after the release date
Don‚Äôt worry
Detolfs are only like $90
what're you after Zio?

Soon ‚Ñ¢
I could barely fit it in my detolf
it's worth it by sheer size alone
Bottom shelf is reserved for fun stuff <:15min:346838673096048641>
Thanks discord for not going in order



Oh lemme take a pic of mine in a sec
If you didn‚Äôt know I love plamo and figures
This channel will be on keen eye though
Nah I‚Äôm just having a giggle
Magnificent

So another server where we‚Äôre tucked away <:15min:346838673096048641>
Also if you know how to paint
<:15min:346838673096048641>
lookin' good

i feel like it's lit fine
Why do your colours look hella saturated?
and I learn from them
because i'm a plamo nerd
My Twitter gives me lots of rounds in the chamber <:LewdWitch:359596294626607104>
<:LaciaSmile:402678631425638402>
Oooooor this~

Or this


Or this
Or this
https://twitter.com/0508bk201/status/990476794980544513?s=19
The nsfw tag is for stuff like this
now I gotta sift through fanfic stuff to get to my plamo
Never forget
I got a yukari figure from the claw
The rush of doing it at the claw machine is worth it haha
can't wait to drop 5000 yen because I suck at claw machines
looks good

Just look at the garbo bellfine kirika
Dude gks can look much better than pro stuff
I‚Äôm 95% sure the place I got it off said it was a fanmade gk

Organising paints gives me a sense of bliss
back to square one
my local hobby shop starts to stock Mr Colour
just once I had every colour tamiya had to offer
so i have conflicted feelings
it's $5 a pot
maybe a tiger I
so I bought sandy brown
my heart told me that sometime in the future i'll wanna paint a hetzer
but now I have no idea
all i wanna do is paint a tank
There's too much
Kill me now

missing Ichiban and Murasame though :/

These two look so good together
if you had the time it'd be a fun project
Painting zoids in general sounds like absolute hell
The sheer parts count on that makes me shudder when thinking of painting that
I love it how the Gatling Chris takes up a whole shelf in a detolf
Any nendo day is a good day
Tfw your doujin gks are better than belfine‚Äôs ‚Äúpros‚Äù
https://twitter.com/Ruru_Berryz/status/1021125333112827907
considering I have a huge amount of things to display
I need more detolfs
that celestial being display <a:2blaugh:462099958862970880>
<a:2blush:462100016010493952>

belfine coming back with the overpriced prize figures
Virgin killer figure incoming
Openaired shelf gives me anxiety
Way better than my detolf
cleaning dust off metallics would be the end of me
whole reason I have them
Detolfs are perfect
just not doodled to do it
I may or may not have stuff to make a candy green too <:chito_eyes:383687871699222529>
I have the msg scythe and tons of pla plate too
I was wondering if I should custom my pretty witch into a kiri
It took me a week to colour match a geah colour
The pink is perfectly colour matched!

*hetzers gunna hetz*
Yay üê¢
I‚Äôve done some pretty repetitive shit with plamo but that takes the cake
And I thought road wheels on my tanks were hard
Fuck my life
hoping the contents are fine
damn that box looks beat
majority of fanart you see of her paired with Poi
Yuudachi's sistership
Shigure
GSC doesn't disappoint
<a:BeefStroganoff:393778449862492164>
That picture feels like it was taken at 400kph
*sprays water bottle*
No shilling
Bad sugar
Going to have to buy another detolf if I want her though
Pretty tempting to grab another bikki
<:springthink:488561382921601025>
Nice thrustmaster <:ShutenHehe:359666564628480012>

Livefire
You‚Äôre yet to read the best bit of gup literature then
Oh honeycakes honeycakes
`The fact nobody dies in GuP is reason to believe magic is at play`
I kinda prefer it since it makes it more presentation
My kancolle ones have stationary knees
Nendo with bendable knees <:MikuShock:391808765009068035>
could be exclusive
pretty sure never
He has 3 detolfs strong + cabinet
A man‚Äôs collection is measured in detolfs
Kanade gear designs
>.>
that's alotta gifs you haven't shared with me <:MikuPout:271482281229680642>
Jesus Christ Honeycakes
well you cannot blame me for when as soon as you join you make the whole thing a dick measuring contest for how big your art file is
It's shifted from being pissed off to concerned
I hope you‚Äôre fully aware I browse here too
*that Chris chap*
Casual saint germain makes me happy
probably took him an hour or two
the eye details are really nice
sanding things like those thighs will be hard
One day i'll bust out the resin and do up a mecha musume kit like him
<:MariaShocked:273278132184940544>
that bloke's sculpting skills are really good
that FA girl GK is beyond my sculpting ability

Easiest way to not get lost if <@!127644949884698624> could help us and pin the message <:LaciaSmile:402168967415726089>
Send me your best military girls
I‚Äôm bored
<@&425667771699822614>
Risky is my business
Mate I use highly flammable paints on a daily basis
I got a headache
Ok I should get out of the bath
Hibiki with an94
<:RikoLewd:356699965130801152>
I need my little armoury fix
Mmmm
We‚Äôre getting warmer
Honeycakes <:MikuOverjoyed:273395118982299658>
None of that chair force business
Ones with guns
I need more military girls
I feel swindled
you give yourself that title pretty easily huh? <:evildia:230289694984765441>
Honeycakes
`Welcome to my life as an emote maker
`

Made a fun 5 minutes
Bored in class and doodled some latewar tanks
Any shigu with rain is a good shigu
a rare thigh high Shigu <:ShiguNani:481075699470565386>

Personally i'm a fan of the whole Shiratsuyu class with Shigu on top
I've been pingeth
<:ShiguNani:481075699470565386>
I kinda just had it there
Buster
well yeah regardless she's nice

*Oh wait that's a thing these days, I forgot*
i'm missing a joke here
lol
but enjoy my backyard
<@456226577798135808> it's an oldie
<@!445783190976856065> can you not ping all of us just for a TL
the costumes are an infringement on my eyes
The lyrics are amazing
the rip I have is mildly ok quality
It's pretty good
been listening since this morning
<a:EreshJerry:570317123948118036>
```i cant join the live rewatch
cuz its 3am
```
not my fault their service sucks <a:15min:490152475098349574>
Crunchyroll is ass where i'm from
It'll be shite no matter what
damn someone from NZ?
Maria is the new wing
Kanade is old news
I‚Äôm watching tv
Kirika‚Äòs transformation is getting more and more nsfw <a:blobsweat_gif:396483843688759297>
It looks so bad lmao
Maria‚Äôs face just potatoes half of the episode
Her headphones are pretty nice
Holy shit
Best zababa combo in all of symphogear
Oh fuck shirabe song
She does things
Elsa exists
The whole episode budget went into Kirka‚Äôs transformation stripper pole dance and snap
Facial expressions look like potatoes
The budget is gone
XV is canceled
Tsubasa ptsd time
<:BasaHeadphones:401783031989272596>
THIS ED IS A BANGER
She visually stabs her through the chest

<:KagaZOOMEDLUL:586065291046551554>
The fight animation has increased threefold but the everything else has regressed so much
I‚Äôm in japan watching in tv
Concert attack again
Yay tsubasa ptsd
Some parts are amazing
It‚Äôs really on and off
The animation is good now
If fine was going to be a thing, they‚Äôd set it up in axz
She is for like 5 seconds
All the budget went into the fights
It‚Äôs just some potato faces in dialogue scenes
Painting that would be fun
I guess there is somewhat motivation now
~~it's coming back to haunt me~~
<:NotLikeMesser:574161168957046787>
or an hommage
idk if it's just lazy
I like it how they re-used SG's Spellcaster sfx for the revolvers
I need Chris to become a magical girl version of the sazabi to be appeased
I need CCA flashbacks if there's going to be funnels
needed to dart around more i'd say
for the first half
the camera work is good, the movements kinda suck
I think it's the opposite
what i'm watching has no dimming
I don't think they're going to change the transformations with the BD
the ribbon bondage shit they were going with Chris's needed to slow down
Shirabe's one was fine
sometimes you gotta let the rule of cool play out
Chris's one would've been better if they slowed it down a bit
didn't expect two transformations this time around
It‚Äôs better than the weak ass laser bolts
https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm35440890 ready go
you got the idea of what they're trying to say <a:15min:490152421964775424>
`they're really braising the steaks`
it's like `A barbie in winter?`
insult them
because you got the idea of what she was trying to do
I wonder why bother
most of the time
Also joe‚Äôs pun is glorious
I applaud the effort for something only a small few care about
Who made that lmao
<:KagaZOOMEDLUL:586065291046551554>
they'll never
oh yeah that discography torrent
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>
it's probably because the song is spoilery
probably won't happen
all wishful thinking
shit gets old
if we go through another hibiki internal struggle I swear
But it was Galaxy cross, Axis and now eksivu (as an onomatopoeia for sneezing <a:15min:585535790889697290>)
Idk about G
now I wonder where you read that
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>
keep it in your pants
that's what doujins are for <:15min:495770478678638593>
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the script got changed just because he saw some cool new fantasy shit in the new fire emblem <:KagaZOOMEDLUL:586065291046551554>
The real magic is whatever kaneko pulls out of his ass
Even for symphogear
This is so much shit
<:Concern:511755328128286730>
I heavily doubt we‚Äôd get a game with geah as the focus
they're the same person
it's a Homura/Hikari scenario
so we can move on
tbh I was expecting Carol to pull out the spellcaster and dink the three of them in the head
thanks joe

`I wonder if everyone heard the Amalgam duet or they just heard Bikki not sing some of the lines randomly
`
I never thought of that
<:jerry:502697491616235520>
people from Belgium are weird I tell you
Millhi since the start?
<:jerry:502697491616235520>
<:KagaOMEGA:607897275687239690>
<@!246146781832806401>
you'd have to ask wfc for that
anyone would get sick of things after a while
I've been following this series for 3.5 years now
I'm already kinda sick of this cast
I just want this to be over, the songs come out and the whole thing is done with
people who stock the stuff ain't very tight lipped usually
we would've gotten art for it or something already
It's probably all going to be BD anyways
<:LUL:444063183465086976>
couldn't care less tbh
but I forgot what it was meaning
someone figured it out
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Miku is the BBEG
worse
with lasting song
the montage is the real stinger
<:Heiki:388829562676576256>
>spoiling the ep in the thumbnail
<:KagaZOOMEDLUL:586065291046551554>
<:concern:506965543157366809>
weird tangent
<:mega_mane:242818717115744256>
GX was pretty bad so it makes sense people weren't as hyped for AXZ
My money is on Gen
They about to pull a fast one on us this ep and kill a kazanari
only Lasting song and Final Commander
tbf I haven't even downloaded any of the songs
this is a thing? <:Jerry:595629002866163714>
<:M14:576384217446088704>
‚ÄúPeople die when they are shot‚Äù
To quote space patrol luluco
<:Pffft:434210712185995266>
<:mega_mane:242818717115744256>
`been waiting for Symphogear wiki to translate it
`
and then that leaves room for other songs
probably DMJii duet
we're not not going to have a quiet episode atleast
Last time I checked, there are SOL shows that have drama that I can definitely tell ain‚Äôt healin‚Äô nobody
It‚Äôs shows that are meant to make you feel calm and good
<:mega_mane:242818717115744256>
Ryuki
when have they hinted that it's romantic
HibiMiku probably won't happen
i'm prepared for the ending to be anticlimatic as fuck
<:mega_mane:242818717115744256>
how else do we sell BDs <:15min:495770478678638593>
maybe miku just needs to keep her hair down
all begins and ends in Shemha
only Shemha
I support that
I still remember at the end of AXZ people were saying Fuudo x Miku was going to be a thing
~~Basa x Ogawa is the real ship~~
we're already at the moon
is where we're going
but whatever line of cocaine kaneko takes
it doesn't sound very plausible
<:KANEKO:601295616001441812>
symphogear is just a mechamusume show that's a silly excuse to sell music after all, I don't see them putting so much effort into making any kinda romance work
it's something you can see
I'd say nanoha was more realistic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulteZYyWAA8
<:Pffft:434210712185995266>
fear the a man who's old in a job that men die young
if you want symphogear context
`gathering clouds`
amazing names
`new grass`
`old grass`
<:mega_mane:242818717115744256>
especially some of the older places
Japanese naming convention is pretty bad sometimes
or anything of the sort?
did you never hear Christmas carols?
Kissanime only uploads horrible subs anyways
I thought mg training was only for the biggest guy in the squad
<:MikuShock:391808765009068035>
You actually served with one?
<:KagaZOOMEDLUL:586065291046551554>
Solopy do you have a fetish for the imi tavor
Some people have... extreme fetishes
Why I like this show
I‚Äôm into mecha musume
I didn‚Äôt have the balls to walk in, it was that intense
I remember there‚Äôs a cafe in japan where they serve you in full Knight armor
the boob missile thing reminded me of that one im@s scene
Too late for any of that anymore
Smh not gas operated
`I didnt know I needed Chris with some pump-action action until now`
Is this what the kids call porn these days?
scarecrow tribal would be a dess thing
<:homeThonk:484732324198744097>
<@269655454957830144> what does a demon tribal EDH deck have to do with symphogear
all points in strength and constitution
he's strength spec
the use of penlight and bowl killed me
that shitty opening is great lmao
Life is good
By the doomsday blend
Brought to you
‚ÄòVer‚Äôy good day today
I really feldt her role
yeah
I remember she did a girl in Inazuma eleven that was fun
she doesn't have a role more prominent than yukine
anyways, it's already done it's job I think
or is it 4 years <:SpringThink:595928212597374992>
it's over 5 years old
I feel like the series has run it's course
getting to japan from here is pretty easy these days with direct flights
for winter comiket
i'm going round newyears time
It'll probably be in 2020 after the olympics
already a magical girl because i got bit by 50 different spiders
I can't be a magical song fighter
i'm Australian though
so is mine
think of their future
but not your children
naming your pets weeb things is pretty cool
i'd name my child christopher just to fuck with people
implying any of us will even have children <:mega_mane:242818717115744256>
it's not like you're forced to be together like school, y'all came here out of your own free will
you guys genuinely like eachother and not just because we all like symphogear
I can tell that this place will be the same
Ping me with any plamo talk <a:BeefStroganoff:393778449862492164>
I see Plamo too
<:BikkiPeek:360093069925941248>
oh i see
aren't you a guy?
?
Something about a scorpion always being a scorpion
*cough*
I was under the impression you got kicked but I realised you left on your own accord a while later
It was pretty much a year ago so I can‚Äôt really remember it
I was still fresh back then and knew pretty much nobody besides R
It was after I think
Well you‚Äôre clarifying it now
But it was quite the impression
Tbh not really
It was shocking
That all happened like the first week I was there <:BikkiAwkward:359767379451838474>
The fact that you just left the valk server after telling someone to die didn‚Äôt slide well with my first impression of you
I‚Äôll be frank here since you wanna know
Sorry I‚Äôm a really confrontational person so I just say whatever
If he‚Äôs upset then ok I‚Äôm being a cunt
Hey fastcars isn‚Äôt getting upset so it‚Äôs fine
Just stuff I‚Äôve seen
I‚Äôll state that it isn‚Äôt towards me atleast
<:ChrisShocked:398799223052566528> just putting in my 2 copper
But I‚Äôll keep it to myself
I could say otherwise tbh
How bad am I at spelling
Gay
The fat is overwhelming here and I‚Äôm trying to resist
I‚Äôm trying to keep straight here
I find the gay levels of this channel so intriguing I can‚Äôt look away
I remember that
He was also into hitting women
Just raised in a bad way
I wouldn‚Äôt say yes disabled or anything like that
Didn‚Äôt expect him to come
He‚Äôs all >>>>reddit about things
Oh wow
He tried to come here?
If you manage to get banned off the 4chan server you‚Äôre doing something wrong hahahah
And he begged his ass to come back after being so condescending
They interrogated him like one to one
Oh no don‚Äôt get me started
Nothing is going on
Hahahaha
You were banned off r/gundam
Atleast 3rd
This‚Äôll make it the 4th server he‚Äôs been banned off with me on it
Is langou going go get banned on another server?
Sorry we had to give him to you after we banned him on the other server
He lied to be he was 19 though
Yeah lol
He‚Äôll get what‚Äôs coming
Just let him say whatever
He‚Äôs a 16 year old teenager
He‚Äôll get banned off the next server he‚Äôs on too
It‚Äôs a good one
the second I read that i knew you'd gush here
but in the end i'd like to ask to keep the gossip and talking behind backs to the most minimum
I guess that's the kind of people we are
That's just you then
it's just the difference in tolerance
In my opinion what you guys find shitty is the norm for some of us
I try to keep good relations between and i'm pretty sure Joe, Kali and Sugar try too
it'll never change how people feel in truth but I find it really distasteful
times have past but i've seen gossip about the valk server here and it irks me
I know the reason it started but I don't see why you guys have to be so hostile to eachother
It's been apparent that there is some kind of divide between userbases
I'd rather you not take the piss out of my mates
I don't know if I should be pissed off but I damn am
```they're not worth it
```
especially since it's always used in my society
I don't like that attitude
4chan is it's own beast I stay away from
me personally, growing up in a country of `my way or the highway, fuck you mate` these kind of situations are common
I guess that applies to more fights now
removing yourself from the situation is always a good way of getting out of dangerous shit
I just accept and move on
not like being an asshole could change someone's true nature
I could say the same about the trans community here but i've come to accept that it's their choices
that's just life for me
hey there are people I don't like but I deal with it
I'll dm you one no prob
but that's probably the way I take it and the mentality I have
I find Saki's comment in-context like he was bashing the community
so just don't shit on eachother because it makes me feel uncomfortable we have these kinda hostilities
and personally seeing the split and the aftermath I can say that these are two distinct and different communities which are both enjoyable to their own merits
I'm on both sides
the rest is just your shitpost style tongue and cheek
there's only been two examples I can think of as true hate
what example can you give?
I don't see much hate there anyways
because I'm apart of both communities and rather not see either get shat on
if anything is a slur
going by Outside's way of thinking, pretty much anything Alice doesn't like is a slur
I'm legible for the firing squad then
calling Ibu a pommie is a slur then
calling em a tranny probably
Pick something that has a ring to it
My dad calls me from time on time and it only brings me anguish
Saki I know how you feel
I do have the too wide problem though
Can‚Äôt imagine the size 13s
I‚Äôm size 12 and I find it hard to find shoes
Jesus lol
Damn what shoe size are you?
Lmao I wish
My last name is literally a popular music genre
I have a super unique last name so I‚Äôm scared shitless if I slip it up
Don‚Äôt be the idiot on the other server that wanted to name his son 
‚ÄòDecade‚Äô because it sounds cool
Don‚Äôt try something out there
4 syllable or 1 syllable names are good
One syllable words are good
Rock etc
Like king, hunt, rosa or something like that
Do we still call you dr?
Still same field?
What‚Äôs going on?
Just do it, if you‚Äôre not going to do it now, you‚Äôll never do it
There was a big controversy then
There was one instance where a student remote accessed a teacher‚Äôs home pc and leaked the contents of the next assessment
tfw
we can be pieces of shit to eachother and still be friends
something about that makes me love her
but this girl i'm with is the biggest and sweetest piece of shit i've ever known
I have the same problem
Letric
annoys the hell outta me
on r/gundam, I keep banning these chinese people but they keep jumping internet cafe
IP bans don't matter sometimes
It's just like that I guess
I once wanted to be a girl too, but it was easier for me to accept that it's something I can't change
Just gotta keep grinding through work
I've kinda always seen it as, 'you gotta open the door yourself, nobody is going to wipe your ass'. So I keep telling myself not to be a total bitch and kick down the door
hope he gets life in prison instead
death penalty is common in asia
they could flip the whole world on it's head if they pull a move
the real threat is china
trust me, NK is the loud apparent threat
I still know a lot of people with theirs still
it'll just be like how the bumpstock got banned
there's zero way to completely remove guns from America
we don't have guns here but there are still many deaths with people using cars and knives as weapons
not always the tools that they use
It's the people who's at fault
it's pretty scary when you go to the supermarket and your what used to be Aussie made beef is now __Product of China__
Been the same for 30 years
They don‚Äôt give a shit
It‚Äôs the Chinese police
A joke
Moped or scooter licences are like
Or you‚Äôll be losing out on money if you‚Äôre a artist or tradesmen
Also depends on job, if you‚Äôre not pulling your wait and leaving work for others. There will be problems
Lots of people do not mind unless you‚Äôre doing something to actively annoy them during the day
It depends on a very wide range of things
What ibu said
The special treatment got to his head
I tell you there was this guy who was so over his shit
But he personally hated he got special treatment
We probably could‚Äôve did better for people who needed it
Nobody really cared for whoever‚Äôs feelings
Taking the piss was common place
It‚Äôs just how highschool was for me
But I usually meant well
I did give my mate a bit of shit
Well now that I think of it
<:AoOops:586762578013716483>
Real people won‚Äôt give you shit for trying
I‚Äôm sorry i shat in your cereal but it‚Äôs how I view it
I‚Äôm saying to try and take steps to try and improve on it
Just because we‚Äôre normal doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre magically super tolerant
Personally in my circles, we have people who suffer from autism. We try our best but sometimes is really hard to accomodate something different
Be it overexcitement or lack of patience
Lots of kids who‚Äôre different cop flak when they barge in or intrude on a situation they don‚Äôt belong in
The name of the game is reading the situation
He wondered why he was excluded
Once you think you‚Äôre hot shit because you‚Äôve had it good in primary school
It‚Äôd make sense the preferential option is the easy way out
so interesting to see how prices go up and down
I'm pretty invested into the magic the gathering economy
well game economies are very interesting
video game economies are very interesting to look at
economy gon
i'd of thought overwatch is going strong
I didn't even know if that game was alive
well when public enemy number one is taken out, of course it's natural public enemy no 2 becomes no 1
it keeps the balance in the universe
if he's still a dick, why is it he can still fit in the group?
his clone popped out of the wood works
And it never hurts to buy a pack or two to support your lgs
In mtg we use packs to draft
Gotta learn their lesson somehow
I recently bought a 90d sub for WT and I feel guilty still
pay to win is where the real scum is
where premium gives you better grind
any kinda WoT, WT
FFXIV and WoW <:chito_eyes:383687871699222529>
would you rather a subscription service?
cosmetic lootboxes are not as bad as people make them out to be
people should probably cash in their csgo inventory
it's fun to play atleast
bfv disgusts me
as someone very passionate about the military and history
besides apex, pretty much all faith has been lost in EA
all i care about now is that they've realised how much shit they dug themselves into
I have a good handful of hours
if they were interested in showing empowered women in ww2, the eastern front is full of it
instead they tried to appease investors and show that they can be good guys
blast some commies on the eastern front
throw satchel charges in Japanese machinegun positions
I wanted to hit france like a lightning bolt from the clouds on june 6th
retell some stories and plant you right in it
is what they did in BF1
all they had to do
undermining real people's deaths for the sake of spinning a story of an empowered women
but, EA had the dumb idea of revising history
some countries like russia had a lot of success with women in the ranks
a good chunk of that historical accuracy is that women are fighting in the first place on the british side
it was
out of all the places they could've tried to show how progressive they are, pretty much anything past the cold war would've went well
now that they've picked their shit up, people are starting to like bfv more now
attacking women etc is just bashing low hanging fruit
the game is very inclusive for a time that was very not inclusive
it's understandable why people are mad at EA for bfv
it's that or whatever the weird ass south american mercenary force was in ghosts
russia always is the token bad guy anyways
I just think it's an alternate reality
Lmao
```I feel this is inappropriate. Halloween isn‚Äôt a social service or a charity in which I have to buy candy for less fortunate children. Obviously this makes me feel like a terrible person, because what‚Äôs the big deal about making less fortunate kids happy on a holiday? But it just bugs me, because we already pay more than enough taxes toward actual social services. Should Halloween be a neighborhood activity, or is it legitimately a free-for-all in which people hunt down the best candy grounds for their kids?```
so all you'd have to spend spoons on is pills, bathing, studying, planning, school, doctor, exercise
if the theory checks out, half of each spoon cost can be covered by another person
but this just screams at me that people need the support from others
without support of another person <:SpringThink:595928212597374992> 
you could maybe get by
you have 11 in a day
eat meals takes up atleast 6, so you have 5
but then you can't go to school because you don't have enough to study
and can't exercise because you can't bathe
no matter what you choose, something will be sacrificed
that spoon theory is interesting
this is an interesting test
<:SpringThink:595928212597374992>


You guys had similar thoughts to I
Would the world be a better place if all of humanity spoke one language to eachother
Just wondering about other opinions on it
Recently I was faced with a question and wanted to see the answers
thanks
<:mercy:543986582554935297>
wew lad lots of responses to that question
it's hilarious how every single user is afraid it'll blow up in their face
If anybody's seen the plastikov
that's what happens when you try to load meme sites like Kissanime or 9anime
I‚Äôve never actually watched strike witches for the mecha musume junkie I am
where you upload your own file
oh I thought you used cytube
[YameteTomete] GuP <:15min:346838673096048641>
put it where it happens chronologically
just make sure to not watch the end part
I still think we should watch it in the middle though
i just watched it and never knew it was there
hahaha
well in order it's in the middle so why not
done <:youSmug:356700473257885697>
GuP is going to be a riot
Honeycakes you forsaken the British for the Russian bias
<:RosehipHappy:436608907381833729>
When are we getting the gup watch
here's the first one to start it all

Sugar made the Mariaspam somewhere
trying to remember where the basa one was
they were made on the original server a year ago
you don't have these?
not everybody has time to do stuff oozing out of them <:15min:346838673096048641>

or just aren't interested
too busy to keep up with another server
everyone wouldn't wanna come here
there's only basa, bikki, Chris and maria
you're a bundle of fun <:15min:346838673096048641>
can't wait to hear
and everybody streams it
I don't feel the need to post fanart on the subreddit for karma <:15min:346838673096048641>
because it aint mine lol
Just making sure I don't contribute to the clog that is my subreddit feed
~~ibu I swear if you post this on reddit your door is getting kicked down with angry men with torches~~
Makes you feel useful saki
<:GarieCute:255583678757863425>
Saki pass me the role
I wished there were more spgs in gup
Aaaaa
Panzer vor!
So I asked the group
I wanted the general consensus between a few people
You should be comfortable enough in jp to not feel like it‚Äôs jarring
The consensus is to just leave it senshado anyways
As the `do` means road or path
He said the most accurate translation would be `way of the tank`
Rofl
I‚Äôm pretty curious
Gimmie a sec
I‚Äôm asking my jp warthunder friends
It‚Äôs like translating zesshou to swan song
It‚Äôs senshado or nothing
Tankery is dumb
Commie knows how to have fun so I like them
They keep it shenshado
The no fun allowed track
Track 2
Use the commie subs
Der film must be watched in 1080p
Yes please
We could just load up a torrent and we‚Äôre ready
I wonder if he‚Äôs got the cytube stuff working
Would we use the German meme sub or the no fun allowed track?
I hope ibu decides to use commie‚Äôs subs
I‚Äôll be calling out every single tank I see
You‚Äôre going to have to put up with honeycakes and I‚Äôs tank spotting skills
Or this week?
So first episode is next week?
12am for me <:15min:346838673096048641>
I wonder if I should brew myself some darjeeling tea for the coming festivities? ü§î
I‚Äôll be grinding warthunder while I wait
<:GermainOnFire:457676909455736840>
Yeah that‚Äôs like 12am for me
so I can go for whenever
I'm on break now
hahaha
2 eps a week?

Can‚Äôt wait to see glorious nippon tank action
Gup hype

so how far will we be off schedule today?
i saw a firefly
they show clips from the show
yeah
so they're like a .5 episode
as they go on they talk about the tanks in the episodes
we can watch the first one
they show clips from the show too
I think they're reflections on what tanks are what
i'd say it's spoilers for who they face
my body is ready for the tanks
Today gup watch hype
the M3 lee is a shitty tank
I don't know how the 1st years did it
Not asking me~ =3=

Strike witches pretty much
this easy8 isn't going to pay for it's self

Let‚Äôs see aot flop and production ig could actually do it
From all my copies of weekly jump I feel like haikyuu‚Äôs art is my least favourite

It‚Äôs like one of two sports series in jump atm
beatless is freaking messy
So we Anzio OVA tonight?
Yohane best

Der film is a must watch
Just torrent
Jay has used more fullstops in that hour than I have used in my entire stay on this server.......

Wobbles is that a Maria ver of <:TougouKek:234037929465479179>

Good designs
They‚Äôre google friends
I like bruise mechs
<:BikkiPeek:360093069925941248>
Did I just hear plamo?
This person named ibu on 3 different platforms
Ibu sounds good
I‚Äôll remember
I jest I jest
screams don't make it all the more wholesome either
the giggling and jeering of the goblins makes it fucking terrifying
It's executed much more terrifyingly than the manga
ay
She looks like a sperm lol
topical
can't wait for der film
Strike witches
What will we do after
Only der film left!
<@284390402210136064> I'm here

I've been watching resh since i was a child
lots of people on the fluidanims forums are like my childhood heroes
i hear things about him from time to time
one of my mates went to highschool with him
damn how far has he came
also all the otogames are great
Kancolle arcade is so bloody fun
Anybody here in the girls frontline train?
pay no mind till something real is announced
It just makes a very convincing clickbait video
there's an official thread
```Hey all‚Äîplease note that Serebii did tweet this, but is also listing the info as unconfirmed right now. It is indeed unconfirmed, so please take it with a grain of salt!```
r/ pokemon is completely quiet\
pretty fake tbh
do people even use the üòÇ emote ironically anymore?
lol
grab that galgun game
Switch is <:feelsadmiral:362383296132546561>

~~despite being part brit myself~~
I feel left out
Aw man you pommies
Mate it costed me $400 aud
How?
Unfair hour?
It‚Äôs a $300 piece of hardware I would not wanna mess with
The switch *is not a psp*
Oh man ftl would be dope
Leave it to the people who know what they;re doing
Switch cracking is really risky and not worth it
Octopath traveller is already on the list
Smash and Pok√©mon will swing really hard in sales
Most households average 2 switches
They sell like hot cakes here in Australia too
Atm
Switch is in a really good place at,\m
God of war, Mhw and persona will though
Ps4 exclusives are really good
And besides the switch
I have all consoles
Play station is pulling hard with exclusives
Xbox is dying
If anything
Our newest member <:LaciaSmile:402678631425638402>

Lost Mines Of Phandelver
and i'm sitting here with a party that takes ages to get throught the LMoP
probably a sign i'm going to die soon
the fact I just got 2x in a row
my luck is horrible
dw
the grind continues
i'll need to get 2 more
to get 5x iirc
just give me another 416 game
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/276679210653712384/447981590824484874/image.png
thanks for the two 416s in a row
ok GF
that's why it made me shit myself <:BikkiCrying:359780350542741524>
Inazuma is one of the most timid and kind ships
actually gave me shivers
`ok you hit and do xxx damage`
`yeah`
all we've been doing is `you want to hit him?`
what is combat
the bare bones
like
initiative then what?
like
so how does combat tend to roll?
oh
CR?
I think i'm doing it very wrong
it's messy and I feel like the encounters are too easy for my paarty
I'm still cloudy about combat actually
hmm
all us players are in an acting school
i've read like 3% of the phb and have been following the guide line by line
how do I git gud at being a DM?
I think i've peaked in life
alright
GF just gave me another 416
well
lol
that's like a year more than the age of some of my players
planning on squandering his pride <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
thinks he's hot shit
my Cleric has main character syndrome

I'm dming it for the first time and it's like my party doesn't know how to fantasy

Okay <:YuunaNotes:238466199724228608>
I have the book physical
Erm
Quick sec

What do I do?
From start to finish
Say my guy wants to hit a gobo
Ah ty
Don‚Äôt ya just love it when you get four 416s in the same week
So I guess I gotta embrace it
She‚Äôs not leaving me
I have 5 spare 416s

maxed my comf
don't think so
Desync was crazy
when I first tried it
I‚Äôm hoping for more xenobladr characters
When I blew all my gold in packs
I had a peek in goro
Oh I actually played some of the jades
anything new?
I stopped around WotOG
5k
scratch that
I have like 50k dust left over from a long time ago
i'm not really bothered grinding for a standard deck
I'm waiting for something big to happen around HS
Phew I pray
You probably figured that one out by now
<@!102691114762371072> super late but z is prone
my all time favorite anime movie
the movie is a must
oh hey I think even Honeycakes and I would join if times line up
you can see it's working because i'm playing WT right now <:ChrisOverjoyed:392965313215463425>
it's the reason for my obsession with tanks
GuP is really good
<:Altera:396295298391212052> Wriggle Wriggle!

Disgusting <:blehh:417424171824316427>
that thing was over 2 metres tall
haha reminds me when I saw this in the paper one morning
but yes it's true! <a:HCxSKSqueeze:405740103298973696>
it doesn't show the footage where the roo scrapes my cheek off with it's foot
if they're gone you're gone
they're binded by their little drones called ghosts
in destiny the guardians are just reanimated corpses
his ghost got shot so he's perma dead
Nathan Fillion's character
Cayde
they just killed the best destiny character in the freaking dlc trailer
those sadistic fucks
oh my god bungie
Wow you look fun at parties
good
<:feelsadmiral:362383296132546561>
well you can play AL
I can't see it past a Chinese ripoff
just jpgs on a screen
It's like WoW
KC is like living and breathing
but once you get past a certain point
the inital climb is hard
I feel comfy in the office
KC is the most calming and rage inducing game i've ever played
I bet they're great
`game`
actually playing the game makes them even better
half of KC culture are doujins <:15min:346838673096048641>
it's just a pure ripoff in my eyes
going from KC to AL
you just don't interact
there is a game
just not the signs
you can understand all the spoken language
there's plenty of subs though
It will never
~~Not like there's much to even play in KC~~
but AL is just pure design chaos with names strapped on
with history dictating their quirks and designs
what KC takes pride in is keeping all the kanmusu authentic
AL kanmusu are just cute girls with ship's names strapped on
they're all just horrible renditions of what they're named after
The designs
and the idea of kanmusu in general
I'm less about the game
I can't look past AL just taking the idea
but
KC isn't even gameplay haha
out of pure principle I hate AL
the higher ups aren't bothered
it's not that they don't want to localize KC
it's just a cheap ripoff
AL doesn't have the authenticity of KC
nope
but I really hate the practice of chinese companies flat out ripping off japanese games
I don't mind if you don't play KC
please don't support azur lane
no really
Saki don't play the heretical chinese knockoff of KC
vile creatures
the dutch
best doujins are ktkm doujins and suzuya doujins
majority of shimakaze doujins are juicy trap doujins
I feel like i'm going to get thrown into 3 levels of jail watching her
ro is queen of doujin police
she's great
~~after the whole inazuma class got wiped out~~
Hibiki's russian remodel?

Veirny?
oh wait the one with Hibiki?
or the Kamikaze class
the Inazuma classes' fleet right?

DesDiv6?
aha
Iowa is the most American thing i've seen out of japan
revealed then
Iowa was in the psp game
oh wait
thankfully AL has caused KC staff to get off their asses now
because it has to compete with AL now
later designs for KC feel the same
one feels way more designed to sell merch
between
just the stark difference

lots of the GF artists did AL stuff too

It's more fanservicy
also a freaking theme park collab
I'd prefer KC more because the preestablished community and memes
hoo boy

the other tank blade user is my best girl :^)
I dropped hana quick
so much stuff
It's a meaty ass game
I'm playing through persona 5 now
it was a fun game
Zeke's quote at the end is freaking gold though
the ending was pretty bland
it was the peak i'd say
brought me to tears
the best part of XB2 was hana's speech to rex in the inn at the start of one of the chapters
not a fan of FEH's IV system
imo FGO battle system is more interesting than FEH
Based Nintendo
I just knew 2b was a thing
I went into it with no knowledge of any hype
It was a great game
I cried playing nier
It's chinese kancolle
4303
feel free to add me Alice
Guncolle's story is surprisingly really good
with the game setting in russia following American weapons
and the game is most popular in korea
they just used jp seiyuus
That's why there are a ton of chinese artists
yes
that's why the chinese community gave everyone nicknames
with the anti material AR
I also have my russian meme echelon
also RF RF HG HG HG
I go SG SG MG MG HG
they just need to stand there and eat shots
shotguns don't even need accuracy
Just like me and 416
all but FGO do
Fgo doesn't have a slash in it anyways
speak the queen's english
frontline is one word
I do not understand why people call it GFL
Were we talking about resource consuming echelons? <:Germain:421434126856486912>

*now you're making me play gungeon*
Enter the Gungeon or FTL
remember the false reports and misdirection <:15min:346838673096048641>
I get G41 more often
I have 8
Plz
Why does it have to be this way
I got 89k manpower
I only got like 9k
I‚Äôm pretty sure that one of the quests for phase 3 is to spend 30k rations
No love for .40 s&w smh
the GvG -> Grand Tournament era was amazing
I stopped playing around Old gods
jesus really
the fuck
2mana ez silence
just chuck in an owl
especially when you had a loaded board
because it always was something spicy
Piloted shredder was fun
Gimmie Sharpsword oil
just vanilla
Like
I wish there was a way I could just play vanilla
I played a good amount of time during GvG
oh I saw those memes
too much shit going on these days
Lol ff
That card looks fun as hell
I'm 5.7 on both UK and US

gbf don't do this to me
they're fun but I still prefer American
i'm at 3.0
I'm working through german tanks atm
I got really good at using the sherman
I loved American tanks
No tanks with explosive filler is suffering against the ones that do
UK tanks are suffering
as fun as they are
tanks
WC4 never
when can we just get it to be more simple with WC3
