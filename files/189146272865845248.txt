To Mel's point, the one we already have is used like, maybe 2 or 3 times a month. There really isn't any point in further fragmenting what little use that one channel gets.
~~inb4 they sue us~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I'd say wait and see if someone could make a better one, myself
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
THAT'S NOT THE SAME
for it is not an emote I can use
but I cannot
I want to react to your headpat emote with headpats
adorbz
your pair will get their chance someday
I'm pretty sure there was a DMJii server icon shortly after I first joined
including to other pairs
the channel icon changes on a fairly frequent basis
I mean, if you're the artist....
and if you suck at drawing....get rich and commision someone else <:Cag:423197445644615711>
you can always DRAW Yandere <:Cag:423197445644615711>
*cough*fanart*cough*
somebody make a good Yandere emote <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We need a good Yandere emote
I feel like with all the random commands we have for Kiribot already, it might be a bit too much
do we need it?
and never funny to begin with
VERY overdone
you could always grab the screen yourself
What's a "manual", dess? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ok, but y tho?
~~also, I would suggest having more to spend coins on than just custom roles, but I don't have any specific suggestions atm~~
everyone I know is dealing with issues they've never had to deal with before <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
IRL seems to be kicking everyone's ass especially hard this month, even more so than previous years
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
<:PadoruElsa:648632796944007189>
ELSA PADORUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
~~host another server rewatch!~~
and they should also still be somewhere here in this channel
Mel posted an archive of the padorus (except for Hibiki) in general earlier this morning
am I tho? <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Until I pay for Nitro just to harass you <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
we just need to animate them
<:ShirabeCheer:661042424570708037>
the spoiler rules for emotes expired a long time ago
we kinda do, but it's mainly "don't spoil in general chat plz"
<:MillarcPlead:663522911067570176>
we need more Milaarc emotes
<:MillarcPlead:663522911067570176>
~~I will never *not* read "Tomosato" as "Tomato"~~
~~I should really download the Milaarc emotes and add them to my personal server so I can at least still use them~~
<:MillarcPlead:663522911067570176>
soon, no more Milaarc
I just now realized that
and then we'll have to get rid of all of them next month when Whiskey's boost runs out <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
oof
They're Saki's daughters. You don't just adopt out your children like that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*cough*<#336297387863703552>*cough*
I argue it isn't fun even when everyone knows its a meme
^
like, would we honestly discuss the cooking all that heavily in a seperate channel?
while we have several people posting cooking stuff in shitposting, I'm not sure it gets enough activity by itself to warrant an entirely seperate channel
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain
<:ShirabeWow:724034356192215081>
<:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
Tsubasa's hair is in the way
too dark, IMO
a lot of people don't read pins, but at least that's on them
yeah, it's hard to know about those commands until someone else tells you after you fuck up
this isn't <#336297387863703552> or <#407060923078017026>
I think that's enough, guys
we need 10,000 more boosts and then to perfom the secret ritual to unlock it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah, it stops at lvl 3
from what I see, no
and yeah, more bayonet representation would be good too
because we don't have room for both
we don't need what we already have <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
we have enough DMJii already
no we don't
we need more HIbimiku
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
rady and Mel took over the server with DMJii emotes
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
we don't have enough Hibimiku
absolutely!
yes!
I wouldn't care too much about a quad animated emote being added since we'll probably never use all this space :B
yeah
we have **no** shortage of space for animated emotes
like
a ton
~~speaking of which, I need to fill up more of my server's slots~~
that's fine, since they're using up their own emote slots
well
oh
the 4 slot emote, Rady
otherwise it just looks broken
the quad one **only** works if you use all 4
the dual emotes IMO are fine since they also work fine using them seperately
4 slots for a single emote is kind of unfair to other emotes
and yeah, I get you and Mel **really** like DMJii, but that 4 slot split emote is too much
does it though?
<:ShirabeStare:675011731801767956>
unless you mean we should add more (which we totally should!)
I think you meant "expendable", rady <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah, I've literally never seen <:KirikaChant:663568587310628892> used outside of discussions about cutting it
can't imagine why <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
especially ones that aren't used
similar faces are probably a good place to start, yeah
it really isn't <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yes!
^
wat?
threat rating?
**SPARKLY**
animate it to make it **sparkly!**
> Limit should increase by 50 every X boosts over lvl 3, you can't change my mind
<@!203444794737950720> I agree, but that's for discord to decide rather than the server's mods <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
if no one uses it even in the channel where it belongs
and to the point brought up awhile ago, I think we can do without the <:SongStone:688213224012644370> emote
it's kinda crazy, actually, that this server has so many emotes that we're even having this discussion even after hitting max lvl O_o
I'm kinda against removing ver, but at the same time I wouldn't miss him if he were removed
I should clarify that's **if** we remove that emote at all
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~so Mel will remove it~~
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Kiribean exists because of Shirabean
pretty much
pat the bean
touch the bean
Miku
because
REASONS!
for
we have bears
but they're there
I'm not even sure what started the bear emotes :B
<a:ChrisBear:605209466409058324>
<a:MariaBear:605209620478427140>
<a:MikuBear:605209676224921630>
not beer
bear
they aren't used much, but it doesn't really hurt anything keeping them
removing them won't really free up much needed slots
teh bear emotes are animated
not all the time, but it's used
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377> is used
yeah
if someone animates it, sure
we already discussed the song stone
AYAYAY
Kiri got chopped
oof
we have 2 slots left for non-animated emotes
I think we've suggested enough emotes
there she is
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I like <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>

two persons
leave Bikki alone
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
oof
have fun discussing emotes all <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
welp, time for me to leave
and it's awesome
but it's the one I know
I don't know if that's the meme
AYAYAYAYA
WE ARE A PART OF THE WILDERNESS
HUNTING IS GOING ON
AYAYAYAYA
And I will continue working on moderating myself
Thank you
I’m just asking to be a bit friendlier D:
Then again so could just about anything
Something like that can be easily misconstrued as hostile
I can tell you right now telling me to “calm down” won’t calm me down
:/
True...
—an animated one so we don’t run out of slots—
I was suggesting some sort of emote
I can attest to that
Mods do intervene
Maybe some sort of friendly “calm down please” emote?
And that just alienates me further
Very often when the mods do confront me, they seem a bit heated themselves, though not as badly
One suggestion I can make for the mods is to find a way to let me know I need to calm down without being mean or confrontational
I did eventually leave to cool down on my own
haha
literally the entire purpose behind it
<#407060923078017026>
we do
if we made a "containment zone" for every spammed meme, we'd have way too many channels on the server
<#407060923078017026>
from a Fate meme
<:PadoruHibiki:516438720082346004>
padorus are this:
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well you're not a mod so...
the ruling was "no"
I fell like <#407060923078017026> works just fine for that
<a:KirikaWham:738960540126150717>
I think Rady did
they lowered it awhile ago, IIRC
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
menu says 31 for me
31, according to the icon
seems to work well on PC as well
<:MillaarcPlead:663522911067570176>
<:MillaarcPlead:663522911067570176>
oi oi, don't ignore XV
I still think it's crazy that even with 250 slots we have so many emotes we feel the need to have this discussion at all
Maria's cape
pink
because
though I'm desktop way more often than mobile
it was for me
Either that or <#407060923078017026>

<a:PetTheToastedLily:764371216378626049>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
like....an official emote server or what?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I shee I shee
I shee
what server you keep that one on? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
oh
<:PoiStare:674513626295435265>
<:PoiStare:674513626295435265>
but no Phanta pet
all the pets
for the mods, no
for the "everyone", yes
especially since only nitro users would be able to use said emotes on the main server
I feel like having official emote servers would be more work than it's worth
<a:HibikiAniDisgust:777593803342610472>
remove right <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:SongStone:688213224012644370>
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
who's paying Lily for all this? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
yup
<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
yeah, it's virtually the same
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it does?
we used to, IIRC
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
we put them on the other server

<a:PetTheMiku:752962965405302876>
don't think so
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Kids can easily lie about their age
I don’t think the mods can really do much more than what they already have
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
from my understanding: hard to moderate
<a:Floof:856315780470931466>
<:ShirabePlease:929758873844350976>  is back!
I don't remember what it's called, but I think I know what anime you're talking about
that's certainly another issue
I think about the only way #books would work well is if all manga/LN discussion was moved there as well. And honestly? I don't think that's the best solution. At the very least, it would take a **lot** of effort on the mods end to keep moving the discussions as everyone gets used to the change
<:ShirabeStare:675011731801767956>
you can also always use strawpoll or w/e as well.
I do the same thing, especially for active servers like this one. Having discord **constantly** dinging at me while I'm trying to do something is flat-out annoying, especially if it's a conversation I don't even have any interest in. 

Frankly, I feel like it should just be the default option, instead of something I have to manually change every time I join a new server.
like, you might get ONE person to check out your stream every few months of posting every stream....
I've only really seen evidence of people looking at each other's stuff here and there and only on Gaijin Goombah's server
and yeah, I agree
ah
talk about each other's fanfics? (which we already have channels for)
talk about each other's streams?
well to be fair...what else would you use the channel for besides it's intended purpose?
~~speaking of which, I should really do an actual bio at some point~~
and I've only really gotten as many viewers from posting in them as I probably would have just sticking the link in my bio and casually mentioning I'm a streamer now and then at appropriate times <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
same
A channel dedicated just for posting personal advertisements would really just add to channel bloat, and the mods have already rejected quite a few new channels suggestions because they don't want channel bloat
If people are interested in seeing your stuff, it'll be easier for them to just click on your name and read your bio than to try and dig through a whole bunch of messages.
and yeah, probably also use your own bio
well, <#357682999300718592> for specifically Symphogear stuff and <#458060276550336522> if you do non-Symphogear stuff as well
<#357682999300718592> is probably also a good place already for that, albeit you'll want to wait for a time when people aren't in the middle of discussing someone else's post
also...I feel like we shouldn't be using this channel to tell the mods who we want banned from channels <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
watch Akiba Maid War with me
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~Akiba Maid War is peak anime~~
my interest would largely depend on what animu we watch....and we most likely won't watch the animu I wanna watch with others <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I'mma let this thing be discussed before I bring up anything else
but not now
also, talking about this has kinda brought up another thing I wanna suggest here
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
polls
true
I guess the 2 biggest issues are 1. How many are interested in group watches? and 2. how will we keep group watch discussions from interfering with the regular anime discussions?
also I don't think I was around for the group watches, so I don't really know all about the "og" use
just....asked a question?
I wasn't getting riled up at all?
uh
and where would we discuss anime outside of group watches?
shush you <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
though that would be a bit of work...
I suppose they could move the emotes that the padorus would replace over to replace the padorus on the emote server
~~I switched to the cheapest plan the moment they released it, lol~~
somehow I forgot about that...despite that literally being the only reason I pay for nitro <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
oh, true
~~which most likely means they won't return on the main server this year~~
<:PadoruMiku:781002161223499776>
padoru year-round!
join the emote server, kon
<:PadoruShirabe:781002159692840981>
and honestly? I hope this server never gets big enough to warrant a strike system....because those are the type of people that would most likely be joining in large enough numbers to grow the server that big <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I don't think we really want super neo-nazis proving themselves to be beyond any hope of salvation to be given a chance at a "strike 2".
the users I've seen here that would really even warrant a "strike" system are the type of users that are generally bad enough to just be perma banned immediately regardless <:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
||and also make the Serena con tickets much less secret <a:ChrisShifty:744677308631089162> ||
typing in the command is annoying for users...but adding in emotes to react to for each and every color we have would be....kinda much <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
I think a lot of people also just are too lazy to remove a color role when they add a new one <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
yeah, a **lot** of people have multiple...but that's not really what the staff intended at all. The reaction roles are for repping all your favs. The color roles are for repping one person specifically with a colored display name. ||and also to get a ticket to Serena con, but shhhhhhhhhhh..... <:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109> ||
<a:HibikiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
I'll let you figure out what that even entails while I bow out of this convo
~~my knife of FRIENDSHIP~~
I will "cope" with you with my knife <:BuckyKnife:668165801563389963>
sometimes in life...you just gotta deal with things
honestly? Even if Mel **was** crazy enough to make this server all about me....it still wouldn't be 100% perfect in every way, shape, and form. Hell, me creating my own server and running it myself still won't make it 100% perfect in every way, shape, and form.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so....I deal with it and move on
exactly
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and move on
so...I deal with the parts that I don't like, but are still reasonable
which I'm not egotistical enough to demand
if we banned everything on this server that I personally don't like....that would just turn this into a HimaAria server instead of a welcoming Symphogear server
I just never brought it up because well....*points to posts above*
I personally kinda had a problem with it from the very beginning, tbh
other people might have stronger opinions on it than I do...but they can be the ones to argue themselves <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so....I'mma just deal with it like I always have been
and that's the problem. There really isn't any fair alternative. At least, not that I can think of
so not even a "fair" alternative, tbh
well, that would still be unfair to the people who find it enjoyable
I personally would like things to be different, but I understand also there's a **lot** of people who don't
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so....I'm basically just defaulting to what's already in place
as for the liveshitposting stuff....I'll kinda have to just agree to disagree with Mel, tbh. There's honestly not a really great solution to that at all that *doesn't* piss off a decently sized group.
as long as the spoilers are marked and we're still allowed to talk about other anime as well, I'm ok with them
kinda my thoughts as well on the <#371105434771390465> stuff
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so...I just kinda scroll past and move on
I don't really like them either, but I would dislike them just as much in the other channel.
and I don't know if trying to move them to <#371105434771390465> would be worth the trouble for the mods
I don't think the anime lists are breaking any rules being posted in the shitposting channels
<@263983345669505025> while we have a mod here to ask....are *marked* spoilers in <#371105434771390465> technically ok as well?
they probably just saw all the spoilers for older anime happening and thought spoilers for newer anime would be ok as well
and I don't entirely necessirly blame that one person either, per se
one person doing a bad thing doesn't really justify joining them
I don't really care who started it, and I'm not sure it matters all that much to the mods, either
~~speaking of which, I still haven't watched the latest episode <:HibikiShock:726645026725167114> ~~
I hope I didn't ruin anyone else's experience with the show <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
admittedly, I forgot to mark my spoilers at first when starting to discuss Akiba Maid War :B
I'm not sure if spoilers are technically allowed in <#371105434771390465>, actually, but I'm personally not really bothered as long as they are marked
if you don't can't be bothered with posting it in the proper channels....you shouldn't be posting it at all <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
not only does <#377148557796442134> exist, but so does <#371105434771390465>
like, I can understand it when it's someone playing through a decades-old game, but when it's a **literally just released** anime...it's annoying
it is annoying how spoilerific <#977744682035605514> has become lately
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>

Anyone know a good program to use for composing 8-bit music? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
'course, I might come up with some ideas while modding. Or maybe even get the skills to pull off one of  my medium-scale games
apart from doing mods, anyway
I've got quite a few game ideas I'd like to do myself, but they're all waaaaaaaaaaaay too big scale for me to pull off atm, and I'm having a hard time coming up with something smaller to start off with :B
game devving ain't a very quick job to do.
Sounds good for a game song~
still with some enemy variety, just so you can still do new mechanics with the enemies, and also avoid overusing pallette swaps
and of course, AU versions of the other characters
A platform game like Mario with different worlds and whatnot, but instead of being just another level each "world" is actually an AU version of the same world, with you playing an AU version of your character through that world
"world 7" kinda made it sound like a Mario fanfic. I held off on saying that joke because I thought it was a bit mean-spirited, but it actually gave me a cool idea for a game
alternate worlds, I'm guessing?
World 7? World 9?
~~I have no idea how subbing for VT channels works, so I don't know if anyone ever has any clue when things'll get done~~
any time estimate on those subs, by any chance? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Her Home Sweet Home playthrough finally has English subs?
OH?!
oh?!
oh?
she's still adorbs AF, tho
I don't watch Kizuna anymore because the English subs take forever, and the videos I want to watch most seem to never get those subs at all <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
much pretty
I would say landscaping is ok

made the main Torii a bit taller and added a tunnel to ze bridge
other than "super fancy place Inari would like"
I still haven't quite figured out what exactly I want to do for the main shrine building
the shrine hasn't been built yet <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm probably gonna make the Torii taller later on, actually
~~island smol, so I may need to make it bigger~~
And here's the Torii!
here's the bridge leading to the island where I"m building the shrine
building an Inari shrine in Minecraft
nep nep!
that works too

even then they'd disappear immediatly
<@!457268466429329429> I'm playing in creative mode on peaceful difficulty. literally 0 possibility for creepers
especially as they became adult foxes
I'll probably make the "house" bigger later to accommodate more foxes.
next the Inari Shrine I'll be building later
I built a place for foxes~
and I also planted TREES in the fox pen
I'm almost definitely gonna change them later, but for now here's mah fox statues~

Literally just saw that same Basa a few minutes ago while browsing recommended artists
Her closed eye is a bit lower than it probably should be, yeah

I was just making a passing joke about shipping culture. I don't really want to devolve into some heated debate over it
mate, if you want to discuss this outside of the "lol, joke" implications, take it to <#336297840529899522>
~~maybe that's why they haven't kissed yet~~
....actually, if Kirika's underage, wouldn't that technically mean Hibiki and Miku are too?
if you want some 20 or 30-something year old fucking a 16-year-old, go for it ~~also, seek help~~
fantasy is fantasy, after all
and since when have shippers cared about the legal implications?
~~the legal age of consent in Japan is 16, so technically not unless I'm remembering Kirika's age wrong~~
People ship whatever two characters they like
~~she looks pissed about it~~
Is that....is that adult Carol taking care of child Bikki?
<@237964037898502144>  the <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249> emote?
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Kirichan can do reminders?
Wait

I can't believe you both viewed and commented on the Bikki photo in the time it took me to get the Chris one xD


This is an art channel. Let's get back to the art
if you guys are gonna continue arguing over this, could you take it to <#336297840529899522> please?
<#336310266654490624> and <#431914167826382860> are separate channels for a reason.
still better to be safe than sorry
which is a direct reference to the Grenadier homage in Ep 3
Every geah in Lydian uniform ~~poor Serena~~


who are these chicks and why is the blue haired one in the air getting hit in the face like that? xD
uh oh

Forgot Shirabe doesn't like twitter pics :B


Foxgirls are BESTgirls :3

d'awwww
~~perfect first picture for her~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Horay! She's back!

Shirabe broke <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>


But otherwise, cute 'rabe~
It's kinda weird seeing adult-sized thighs on what is clearly a young girl of like....maybe 8 years old or something?
is she....cutting herself? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>

And probably take credit for doing it if it somehow happens by accident <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>



Not every cis joke is an attack on trans, poi. And to be fair, the fate series already fucks around with people's gender.
That gun is so manly, Saber's hand changed gender just by holding it <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>

Kerrik new Shirabe? <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Thanks, Shirabe

headpat
overworked Shirabe <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I've never looked at my measurement in cm, but I could probably easily figure it out
Cags is taller than I am <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
||please let me not be smol!||
so now I"m confuzzled
but I seem to recall also being measured at 5'10"
because I think I'm exactly 60 inches
I need to measure myself again
I
WAIT A MINUTE
no it's not
hold up
wait
5'10 is 60
Everyone's been saying that's Smol
now that I learned I'm smol
I used to like headpats
but "smol" is news to me
I mean, I never thought of myself as being particularly tall
I didn't realize 5'10" was "smol"
Is this....is this *normal* for Japanese?
But apparently I fucking don't <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
I THOUGHT I HAD AT LEAST 5 INCHES ON HER
Shirabe is *barely* smoler than I am
I didn't realize the geah's were all so tall <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Miku's taller than I am
omg
I wanna be *beautiful* D:
I...I dun wanna be cute
....I'm smol....
that....puts me around Chris's size....
uh...
Apparently I'm around 152-153 cm
no, I mean the notch for 1 cm is only half a cm from the tip
which is especially strange considering it *does* start at 0 for the inches
it starts at 0.5
....for some reason my measuring tape doesn't start at 0 cm
Her hairstyle fits her personality perfectly <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Why would Kanade even try?
~~so is Basa's music note hair~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
hehe...embarassed face...
thanks, shirabe
but the hair is styled kinda like cat ears
well yeah, not literal cat ears
Saw a twitter post talking about her cat ears, was all like "what? she doesn't have-" Then I took another look and "HOLY SHIT! MARIA HAS CAT EARS!"
literally just found out last month, I think
you guys have no idea how long it took me to realize Maria had cat ears <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
Gen's the only one who can headpat me <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
but only slightly
tall ninja boi
Ogawa, surprisingly, is taller
...probably a cm or two shorter
so I'm more around Fujitaka's height
I'M NOT SMOL
60 INCHES GOES TO MY NOSE
YUSH
I've got my tape right here.
either way, it's a really good Hibiki
I guess it's more "alternate costume"?
yeah, but the wings
That's the best alternate clothes Hibiki I've seen in awhile <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I think so
~~tfw I forgot what "doujin" meant and looked it up only to feel stupid~~ <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I see that armor set in fanart alot, so I'm quite familiar with what it is and where it's from
not a unicorn horn <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
so
according to this wikia, they're classified as  elder dragons
well sure, it *looks* like a unicorn, but does the game officially classify it as such?
I'm not super familiar with Monster Hunter, but I don't think the Kirin is technically a unicorn?
yeah, Dino showed us that last night
~~though technically, I don't know if it actually reloads the config or just gets Shirabe to say Ready Go~~
Just because I see an exploit doesn't mean I'm gonna abuse the hell out of it like an excitable small child, dess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
uh....no thanks. I'd rather not abuse the bots, thanks
~~that seems too easily abusable~~
....wait, we have permissions for doing that?
all the more reason for me to default to NSFW <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
some servers consider any bikinis to be NSFW, for example, while others will allow it in SFW channels
Especially since I don't really know *exactly* how far you can push the definition in this server
I kinda just default to the NSFW to avoid that
I guess someone posted those two pics, but then deleted them afterwards for some reason?
ghost pictures <:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
~~yes~~
Coincidence? I THINK NOT
Fluffy Dess~

Mash's armor is awesome
I'm *very* familiar with Mash's armor
I would know if it wasn't <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
in case anyone's curious, here's actual Mash <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the rest of it
but yeah
and the armor is definitely Mash
I just saw her armor at first
god, I haven't looked at the other two, and now I'm afraid to D:
that is one strange chimera mecha
lots of different pieces
and uh...wow
including a piece of that Shield Hero guy's cape
but also a lot of other pieces of other characters
well, bits of Mash's armor
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and that name is Mash Kyrielight
that purple girl has a name
that is a good pose
this is good dragon
I like this dragon

Fang needs more fanart love <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
...or on Pixiv <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>


...not a lot of Fang on danbooru D:
Fang~

speaking of Fang I should post some Fang <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~plus she's usually deployed behind Fang, so Fang's the one that really needs the defense~~
her base defense is already pretty high, and I have pretty good healers to deploy beside her
I pretty much never really even need her defense skill <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Liskam good shield dragon
yush
high defense, pretty good attack, an attack range of two blocks instead of one, and can block up to 3 enemies at once
Liskam is also incredibly useful in game

shooty shield dragon!

but still a good dragon
not a punchy dragon
LIskam is another good dragon
normally I have Estelle deployed with Fang
or Fang with her spear
and she's just as good with her fists as Amiya is with her arts
lolyeah
generally when I do see the rare crocgirl, it's a pretty good design
indeed
~~her tail made me think she was a crocodile at first <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~
with a skill to raise it up further
she's got pretty good attack power
she punches
but this is punchy dragongirl <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't think I have any diagrams
I uh

punchy dragon girl <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
God, even the guys in this game are cuties
one day I won't even be able to seperate Ch'en from Estelle <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
God, there are so many good characters I like, my mind is just blending them all together instead of trying to remember all these names <:UsedToIt:675014173352132627>
his main design anyway
but yeah, despite not typically liking manly men, Matterhorn is actually nice
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
omg, I was thinking of like, 3 different characters at once for some reason
*his
haven't interacted with Matterhorn much yet but I like her looks~
this is actually one of those rare instances where **none** of my favorite characters (at least that I've met so far) are foxgirls <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
especially all the non-infected operators that work for the same company as infected operators?
how do you even avoid the disease if it's so easy to contract? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
the disease in the game
and yes, Amiya cute~ <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
<@!237964037898502144> IIRC, I think those "rings" are the crystals from her Oripathy?

I think that artist just drew the tail wrong
no, but she can still smack you hard with it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
reasons
because
but **I want her!!!**
Never met this chick in game

Speaking of XDU, they could probably also do an anime version of that
Of course, all this would also require new villains and such for said users to fight
IIRC, at least some of the information regarding the Symphogear system and how it works has been released to other governments, so it's very possible for us to even get an international Symphogear force with users from different nationalities.
Like, an older Tsubasa could take over Genjuuro's role, and send new gear users on missions and such.
Basically, the main characters age, and move up the military ladder to more leadership roles, and the series moves to focus on younger, new characters that join under them
One thing I'd like to see, if they can come up with more good ideas, is to do something similar to what the Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha series did
like, maybe they'll do some recap movies, or a spin-off series or something
I'm curious if they'll do anything else with the series after the main story wraps up
if they were super common and oversaturated, I'd probably be wishing for an anime where it happens like it does now xP
The fact that they are so rare is a large reason why I think it would be an awesome idea
~~watch that fan be me when I work on one~~ <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
a Symphogear transformation sequence that doesn't give goosebumps is a Symphogear transformation sequence that was probably made by a fan that doesn't know what they're doing <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
~~then again, this IS Symphogear we're talking about~~
would be pretty weird to see a innocent bystander bump into her in the air <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Like the middle of the air, for example
and bikki is normally either right near the battlefield, in the middle of the battlefield, or in an area where there's no one around her.
most people would be AVOIDING the noise at all costs xD
....and why would random bystanders be walking in on her transformation to begin with?
that would be too mean!
like, imagine if Tsubasa had to fight with only half her gear and no sword because a noise threw a boulder at her partway through the sequence
forcing them to be smart about when they do it
and of course, the possibility of getting punched in the middle of it
Like, transforming in the middle of the Sahara desert would cause the girl to sweat a lot as she's transforming, for example
And now that we're talking about it, I would LOVE to see a Magical Girl anime where the transformation actually does affect/is affected by the world
or like, happening in a pocket dimension or something
Most anime treat the sequence like as if it's all happening instantaneously, as far as how it affects the world around the girl.
it's actually quite rare for the sequence to have any real meaning to the world at large, apart from maybe some symbolism.
Seems like a weird thing to be jarred about, TBH.  The most important part of a Tenshin sequence is how awesome it looks.
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
(also, this probably belongs more in the <#336310266654490624> channel, since it's more franchise discussion than XV discussion)
That was interesting in the original airing, that the people didn't come back
Radiant force for me
~~yes you do~~ <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
join uuuuuuuuuuuusssssssssssss~
yes
Although I feel like it'd be a bit harder to make as a series, honestly
So you're saying the corpse is significantly less corpsey than initially claimed? <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
"Corpse significantly less corpsey than initially claimed" xD
ok, so 25% of the world is Miku
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
oh fuck, you're right <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
for I am not Hibiki
Sadly, I would not be in that world
Imagine a world that's nothing but Hibiki~
There's literally no such thing as too much Symphogear
but then I remembered
I was gonna say that's too much
~~I'm gonna laugh if that's literally true~~ <:Ver:336656981144109066>
they had plans for it all along!
The beef stroganoff song was actually a summoning ritual for Fine
~~Carol confirmed Fine~~ <:CarolShock:430939013235474432>
but she's not gonna be some AI that Elfnein develops
She's coming back, for sure
I doubt Carol will come back as just an AI
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Sing about how much you love food enough, and eventually you'll feel more comfortable singing about how much you love your ~~gay lover~~ friends!
I wouldn't be surprised if they were graded off of that song
especially since you'll often have little warning when you need to get in gear
get you used to "singing from the heart"
singing about random shit you like in random situations would actually be a good exercise
If they're basically training them to potentionally become Symphogear users
The beef stroganoff song actually makes sense
and the kind of the school it is
Speaking of Lydian
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
~~make them Symphogear users~~
What are these "table manners" you speak of? <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>

Constant yelling and calling each other dummies? <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
world peace
everyone is Hibiki
why would Hibiki bully Hibiki?
that's another good poitn
wait
and the 25% of Hibiki's that have said Miku would go around seeking out the edgebikki's and trying to hug them all
oh yeah, I guess I forgot about the activation songs
Why is Gungnir 100% ok working with Shul Shagana, but completely against the very thought of working with Shirabe?
Why are they picky with users, but not other relics?
them being picky about certain songs is all the more reason it doesn't make sense for them to be able to do a group song
possibly even "remembering" songs from previous users
and I'm sure Gungnir influences the song to some degree or another
but Bikki also had some of the same heart as Kanade
Well yeah, sure
and it still doesn't quite explain how a relic with a different wavelength can resonat well with other gears, but not attune to other gear users
wavelength's aren't songs, though
and how could anyone of them do a duet or group song?
and if it has it's own specific song, how can Hibiki have a new character song every season?
I know you can't just attune with any relic you want, but if the song comes from your heart, how does the gear have it's own specific song?
and wait, I thought the song came from the user's heart?
to be fair, alcanoise are A. created through alchemy (hence their name) and B. probably sold on the black market, meaning you wouldn't necessarily need to create them yoruself until the supply runs out
including the one in your bathroom!
every single one
they're all made from SSJ fragments
man-made mirrors are actually magical relics that reflect literally everything <:Ver:336656981144109066>
it doesn't make sense to me
and if it's pure itself, how would it be destroyed after being purified?
How could SSJ even shoot off such a beam without being pure itself?
Isn't it's beam supposed to "purify"?
I know they showed the fragment breaking apart, but I don't see how it's even possible for Shenshoujing to destroy itself.
AND WON
he fought all the gear users all at once in the training room
~~why would I lie to you, though?~~
but I want him to be custodian, damnit!
he most likely is more along the lines of "support character Saitama"
HALLELUJAH
THERE IS HOPE
YUSH
albeit with HEAVY consequences
But yeah, I think the linker drug is more-or-less a way to make pretty much everyone compatible with every gear
Genjuuro confirmed custodian <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
~~then how is Genjuuro still alive?~~
Hibiki specifically mentions forgetting, IIRC
exactly
just put up a recorder and record the song xD
that makes no sense
....so what are they doing if they're not saying it? xD
or is just a matter of no one ever actually thinks to memorize the activation song, and just rely on it coming from the heart?
still, how does a gear decide who's allowed to use that activation song?
~~and they barely had any screentime of being alive~~
~~just look how much people still love Kanade and Serena~~
And frankly, you can kill of a MC and still make money off their merch
Probably not to the degree you're thinking it is, though
but it's not the driving force behind the story that you think it is
I'm not sayign merch is completly unimportant
It's not just some souless marketing machine made to sell merch.
Symphogear is as good as it is largely because it has so much HEART in it
and stop being so jaded about everything
Seriously, read the interviews
but to say there's literally no such thing as a story made for the sake of story in anime is complete Bullshit
In the end, sure
no they didn't
and there was a point to those duets in AXZ
That's XDU, though
they've blatantly stated such in interviews
Symphogear was never designed to sell the CDs, for example
well I don't think they're caring much about marketability, TBH
ESPECIALLY with this being the final season
they can kill off a gear user
not necessarily
they'll kill someone off
but Thanos is the villain....
"small bit" being the keywords there and whatnot
Ver did redeem himself a small bit at the very end....but if there's any character in Symphogear that's pure villain, that pure villain is Ver
what purpose did the terrorist attack serve outside of setting up Maria's character struggle?
why would they need to declare war against the whole world to resurrect the frontier?
and most of them fighting Japan was just the fact that the frontier was in Japanese territory, IIRC
they barely even fought any country outside Japan
but they never USED said military to...you know....do war stuff
they had a military technically, yes
standard Symphogear non-military villain stuff
and then boom
like, they declared war against the whole world like as thought they had a military
especially with how little they did with "warring against every nation" and how quickly they seemed to drop the whole terrorist act
like....who would still be around to worship Ver as a hero?
the thing that confused me about his first plot, though, was the fact that pretty much everyone would die in that scenario
I thought you were just straight up bringing in a MHA villain into the discussion xD
Ver?
oh
....wat?
and why would Kanade fake her own death to give Gungnir to Hibiki?
like....what would her goal be?
I.....don't think it really works to have Kanade as the villain
although with that stuff in AXZ, I guess it's possible
~~I don't think Hibiki would actually become Godoka, though~~
she's already "died" like....at least 4 times now
my heart can't take more Bikki death Dx
not Hibiki
nononononono
they all lolnoped
and was lolnoped
Hibiki also technically died in S1
if/when someone DOES die, I'm gonna rub it in your faces so damn hard
but just know this
let's agree to disagree
Well ok, fine
you are talking about a different scene xD
oh
wait
I mean, it was basically just Fine messing with BIkki
yeah, but the battle wasn't really fast-paced for that part
it's also not really heard in a battle setting xD
it's out of place for Symphogear overall, but still a good song in and of itself, IMO
One of the things I love about most the Symphogear songs is their upbeat tempos
I won't argue that point at all
That is true
and slow tempo =/= inherently bad tempo
but then again, I'm perfectly capable of enjoying simple songs
I don't really find it all that boring, either
The melody is similar to a lullaby, but the lyrics kinda aren't
lullaby's aren't normally sad and depressing <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
"lullaby" doesn't quite fit, either
wait
~~I consider it more of a lullaby, though. The melody makes it sound too solemn for a folk song~~
A folk song was more fitting to the situation than a character theme
~~though I'll admit it probably wouldn't work that well for combat~~
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Apple is an actual song. Change my mind
Lot easier to kill someone when you don't give a shit about them
She doesn't necessarily have that same level of connection with LITERALLY EVERY HUMAN EVER
I mean, to be fair, she has an actual emotional connection to Cag and Prelati
but he doesn't come across as someone who cares about saving us, either
probably not
Politicians do that kind of shit all the time
Maybe he genuinly does care about protecting us, but it could also just be taking advantage of the situation to look like the hero while he furthers his own selfish goals
TBH, the whole "protect them from the gods" bit sounds a lot like an excuse to justify the "conquer all of humanity and make everyone my slave" bit
With Adam occasionally calling them on the phone to be a dick
and even after appearing,  everything was still mostly being handled by <:Germain:421434126856486912> and the others
He didn't even appear for a good portion of the season
yeah, we didn't get to see near as much of Adam's character as we did Ver's
80% at the lowest
Ver is like.....probably around 90% evil
I don't believe in the concept of "pure evil", but there are villains who are like, 99% evil
~~it's so smol, it doesn't exist~~
Though her body was apparently being researched on that ship that blew up, so maybe she'll have more use this season
save for her infatuation with Adam
and that was basically her ONLY purpose in the series
HOLY SHIT, YOU'RE RIGHT
I think that "opposite poles' thing was what they were going for
Fine just isn't my "own"
well, to each their own
the whole BDSM thing wasn't my fetish, either
I was actually turned OFF by her nudity
not even her being nude
I honestly didn't like Fine's character designs at all
but it was still Miku "calling it out" in a sense
there was also Miku being embarrased about Chris not wearing underwear
they wouldn't necessarily know if they're sleeping like the custodian in the coffin, though
or at least there's something on the moon that leads to wherever they are
I think it's pretty likely most these "gods" are on the moon
gotta let everyone know that Miku does, in fact, have breasts
~~also, we should probably get back to XV discussion being this is the XV discussion channel...~~
SOMEONE GIB LINK
THERE'S A MIKU HENSHIN SEQUENCE I HAVEN'T SEEN YET?
wait
where Ver was?
the tomb place?
And once Carol has everything she needs to enact her plans, why would she wait?
so they still at least had to deal with them
and still doing shit
sure, but the autoscorers will still around
and agian, not everything can be done under the radar
again, once you make people aware of your existence and your evil plans, they tend to start  doing everything they can to stop you
I mean, to be fair, they needed Elfnein for a lot of things
so she could read their movements well enough to know when it's time for another distraction
Remember also, Carol has a "spy" planted
hard to raid a secret base when you don't know where it is, and hard to look for it when you're busy dealing with everything else
They couldn't be, for the most part
and if she went into hiding with them knowing she's still aroudn,t hey'd go looking for her?
and her plans?
The fact that they are now aware of her existence?
eventually, she would've needed those songs
but not everything can be done completely under the radar
for HUNDREDS OF YEARS
She was
People rising up wiht the power to stop her plan once she started enacting it gave her a time limit
The Symphogears gave her a time limit
Sure, but that's IF memory combustion works that way
so she wouldn't be able to use Garie to gather memories
There's also the fact that by the time she REALLY started using that power output, the autoscorers were already all dead
So, burn the memories you don't want first, then when you run out start using everyone else's
Sure, but if she resorted to using those other memories, FIRST, her own would stick around longer
as well as the fact that she gave many of them to Elfnein
Her song kinda implies that she doesn't want those memories
I think part of it was Carol wanted to get rid of those memories
and technically speaking, she and Carol are the same person (hence why they merged to begin with)
just more advanced
Elfnein is technically as much a living doll as the autoscorers were
all the more reason the "possession" theory makes sense
Right
Probably also during some climatic battle
possibly by "possessing" Elfnein
And once she's finally figured everything out, she'll come back in some way or another
My theory? Carol has been around this whole time. Just kinda staying on the sidelines for now as she sorts through her memories she had stored in Elfnein to try and remember who she is/was
and Carol VERY CLEARLY merged with Elfnein at the end of GX
I'm pretty sure I remember reading a character bio for Elfnein on one of the official sites that mentions her doing some sort of research to try and find Carol
I can all but guarantee she will
even the GX autoscores had more to them (and they still weren't super well written characters)
useless Tiki
welp
maybe not all of them, but for sure a lot of them
THEY'VE VERY BLATANTLY STATED THEY HAD THESE IDEAS AHEAD OF TIME
INTERVIEWS
THE
READ
also
albeit, usually with an anime adaptation rather than the other way around
but retelling's are done by different artist's all the time
again, I don't know much about the manga. I don't know who wrote it
it could very well have been another artist's take on retelling the story
sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean the team that wrote the anime also wrote the manga
but I don't know a lot about the manga to begin with
I don't think the manga was entirely their story, though
I don't think it did, but I'm not 100% sure on that either so
so as far as they knew, they only had those initial 13 episodes to try and explain LITERALLY EVERYTHING
well, by your own admittance, they didn't know the series would continue past S1
If you have good ideas for a sequel, keep those ideas around in case your series actually does take off and you need to come up with ideas for a sequel
and sure, they didn't expect Symphogear to get popular enough to use all those ideas eventually, but that doesn't mean you just give up on the possibility and toss them out
They very blatantly stated having a lot of ideas from the very beginning they weren't able to fit in S1
Read their interviews
which is one reason why it's the final season
from what I read in interviews, XV is more-or-less them finishing up all their ideas they had
but they already had a LOT of ideas for XV that they had from the very beginning of the franchise
maybe not every detail
They've already planned ahead, though
that would give them enough time to get Kirika her much-needed development without sacrificing screentime for whatever else they have planned for SV
honestly, with as much popularity and sales as the franchise gets in Japan, they should be able to give the show enough of a budget to give it a 24 episode season instead of just 13 episodes
Character development would be more-or-less a requirement for her at that point, unless she just kinda gets sidelined along with Shirabe
Imagine Kirika having to fight while Shirabe's out for 6 months
or hell, even for the other characters that have to deal with fighting without them
and it also leaves a LOT of room for character development as they're recovering from said injuries
They live, but still adds to the suspense
again, just send them to the hospital
Character lives on for merchandising, but the songs are still dangerous enough to be suspenseful when someone's getting ready to use them
just do that
Tsubasa survived doing it in S1, but wound up in the hospital with serious injuries
but really, you don't HAVE to kill a character to make it so dangerous
sadly, it is still just a small possibility
With this being the final season, there's a small possibility they'll make the <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> dangerous again
And with this being the final season.....they're running out of time to make it happen
but anyway, yeah. I'm pretty confident Carol is coming back at some point or another. It would be weird for them to mention Elfnein looking for Carol in one of her bios (pretty sure it was for AXZ) if it wasn't going to become a major plot point later on.
*shrugs* lets just learn from this mistake and make sure we're in the right channel next time
I should've pointed it out sooner, and been more adamant about switching channels
partly my bad too
We went waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long with this GX talk
this channel is meant to be *exclusively* for XV
general franchise talk goes in <#336310266654490624>
it's all GX talk
Unless the Chatteu reappears in XV later on or something, this has nothing to do with XV
we're discussing you're issues with GX
but we're not discussing XV theories at this point
Sure, her character might become relevant
if you can't handle ridicolous, wtf are you doing here?
Mate, it's Symphogear
all of this talk about Carol has to do with GX, not XV
Also, this should REALLY be taken over to <#336310266654490624>
^^
That's villains in general, mate
Generally speaking when a villain has everything they need to enact a plan, they fucking do it
But again, why wait 100,000,000 years to enact your evil plans if you have everything set up RIGHT HERE AND NOW
not to mention they would DEFINITELY be looking for Ver after his breakout
and Ver's not exactly someone to keep his fucking mouth shut
oh yeah, and remember that scroll thing she needed? It got destroyed, and she had to use Ver as a backup
Also, you're assumming that Carol also has infinite patience and is perfectly willing to wait another 2000 years when she can do her plan NOW
it was NECESSARY for her to eventually get that scroll
she needed a relic from there
she had a purpose there
Though there's bound to be a moon or two similar enough to our own to act as a backup
Jupiter/Saturn might be less a storage of backups and more a dumping ground for failed experiments
and it's not like they all have the exact same size, either
many of them are classified as "irregular satellites", after all
Well, taking the theory seriously, most of those moons probably wouldn't actually be viable as backups
79 is probably the most accurate, since more are being discovered
like, make up your damn minds, guys!
all this in the same article, mind you
I think this article on moons is poorly researched. It says Jupiter has 62 moons in one place, 67 in another, 72 in yet another, and 79 in yet another place
like. that's a LOT of overcautiousness
especially if the first device has lasted so damn long
even if they created that many back up moons, I doubt they created that many back up devices
and if Jupiter also is used as a storage....that's 72 or so more
Saturn has like, 62 moons. That's a fuckton of backup curse devices
Especially since the backups may not necessarily have the....whatever it is that causes the curse
Considering how the moon affects the ocean, among other things, they probably wouldn't necessarily want to destroy all the backups as well
theory fixed :D
there we go
~~Saturn ring system confirmed storage controls~~
wait
Saturn's prettier, tho
or Jupiter, I guess
~~Saturn's probably a storage depot for backup moons~~
and lol, backup moon
~~but then how will the world deal with the rising ocean tides?~~
Gen being god and punching it to end the curse he created
That is literally the only way it could be more epic than Hibiki doing it
Maybe the series end is Genjuuro seeing Fine's point about Balal, and ending the curse.
and the custodians were the good guys all along
Then again, maybe this whole "custodians are evil assholes" thing was just a smear campaign by fine and Adam
That would be even less feel good
Is the end of the franchise gonna be Evil Genjuuro taking over the world and ruling with an iron fist?
Yeah but, if my theory proves correct and he wins....what then?
BUT I DON'T LIKE HOW POSSIBLE IT IS
still probably not what will happen
THAT MAKES MORE SENSE AND IS MORE LIKELY THAN I CARE TO ADMIT
Finale is her having to face him after learning they were being used all along <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Genjuuro using the Symphogear users to deal with Fine and all the others who are trying to kill him
that actually makes so much sense
Oh god
~~Gen was god all along~~
<@486087033652248576> <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> ~~so forgotten~~
~~but they already know why~~
almost everything we know about them comes from their bios on the website
Although to be fair, they haven't really done anything yet except appear, spy, and say "we wanna control the thing!"
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
~~first episode and they're already forgotten~~
Hell, we've barely even talked about the new villain trio at all
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh. So hard to predict what'll happen when it's only the first episode and so much is in the air
It would actually be quite hilarious if God was the one who ultimately pushes them into marriage
God: "FUCK THE ENGAGEMENT, YOU'RE VERY CLEARLY A COUPLE"
Maybe even giving Hibiki that ascension someone else mentioned earlier
And god proceeds to fix everything in some manner or another
"This is the thing we're trying to do" "This is why that's bad" "OH SHIT, YOU'RE RIGHT"
Like, the gear users fight and defeat some high-ranking custodian right in front of whoever "god" is, and then Hibiki is able to just discuss things with God and clear everything up
especially since there most likely would be some sort of climatic battle beforehand
And while it wouldn't be the most exciting ending, it would still make so much sense in the Symphogear universe
I mean, that would fit in PERFECTLY with her character
~~I still think it's legit gonna happen~~
We've joked about <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740> being confirmed custodian several times xP
So let's see....I've pretty much already discussed my "Carol returns" theory
before I piss the mods off >_<
I need to stop >_>
I seem to be getting in the nasty habit of getting involved in long-winded off-topic discussion on this server <_<
If you guys really, really, really, REALLY want me lecturing you over this some more for whatever reason, take it to that channel. Otherwise let's move on and discuss more XV theories
also, this is starting to get into <#336297840529899522> territory, so it's best if we just drop it now and move on
the world isn't black and white <_<
and there are PLENTY of writers in the middle
"IF this guy lied, I wouldn't believe him!" is a poor way to prove that someone else is lying.
Also, "IF this guy said a thing" isn't a very good example if he never actually said that thing. Though I'm not a DBZ fan at all and thus have no familiarity with what he did or did not say, so maybe it is a thing he actually said
I'm gonna be real with you dude, I trust their interviews a LOT more than I trust some random guy on a discord server that refuses to even try and read said interviews
"oh, I don't trust these guys, so obviously I'm inside their heads and know their thought process perfectly"
your doubts doesn't make it truth
Serioulsy, don't go spouting "we'll never know what they were thinking" BS when interviews exist with them telling us what they were thinking
though everyone talking about it has spoiled it a bit already
I'm avoiding it because spoilers <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
I'll give the podcast a fair shot later, though
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
>anitubers that aren't Gigguk
but yeah, between that shrine (which, BTW, they went OUT OF THEIR WAY to point out at the very end of that episode), the priest at said shrine, and apparently him having an apperance in XDU, this can't be something they're just planning to ignore entirely
I thought GX sounded wrong, but AXZ also sounded wrong to me :B
ah, right AXZ
and the priest joking about having a daughter about Shirabe's age or something
Tsukoyomi Shrine?
remember that shrine place?
They dropped some pretty big foreshadowing back in GX, IIRC
I can all but guarantee they will
*shakes excitedly*
also
so unless they're liars, it's pretty likely that they do, in fact, have different goals from Adam
I mean....they blatantly stated they have different goals
While Kirika isn't a particular favorite of mine, I would be very sad if she got literally no background story reveals whatsoever
Hopefully we get at least some hints towards Kirika's past as well
but holy fuck
I figured they were gonna do something bad with the concert (and making the other gears late)
fuck Thanos
ENOUGH
BLOOD
D:
fuck you
blood enough
then why are the humans bleeding it too?
sooooooooooooo much <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
I'm having a hard time forming coherent thoughts about the rest of the episode because OHGODOHFUCK
and fuck, the alca-noise even bled when they suicide bombed that support structure
It was bad enough that the alca-noise bled when killed D:
THEY TURN TO FUCKING BLOODBATHS
BECAUSE THEY DON'T TURN TO DUST
AND IT'S WORSE THIS TIME
so much <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> incoming
in other news, I finally got around to ep.2
poor Tsubasa D:
ohgodohfuck
thsi means zesshou's are gonna be dangerous again
Oh god
WHO SAID WE NEEDED S1'S SUFFEREING ALL OVER AGAIN?!
what the fucking jesus
Fucking Jesus
Jesus fuck
even if Enki's dust was still in the frontier, though, I doubt anyone would really notice without the show specifically pointing it out
maybe that's why the Noise in S1 turned people to dust
turning to dust when you die?
like, how do we know this isn't a think common with custodians?
very possible Enki's body was turned to dust, and then simply got swept/washed away or something
exactly
and then America fucked it up <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
or it just turned to dust like this body just did
~~Enki grew another arm with the power of the armlet!~~
And even if it's not, Enki's bound to be important in some way
I think that's the general theory most people are going with
does it really matter what gender they were, apart from speculation on who it could be?
Fine uses genes. This guy uses jewelry <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's pretty likely
well, not quite a guantlet, per se
~~until someone wears the guantlet and snaps him back~~
I think the corpse is a bit more dead now
well then
*finally watched ED and epilogue*
~~then someone coughs and fucks it all up~~
~~just make the entire world completely silent~~
and now this whole thing sounds weird
no new noise
no old noise
I mean, no more noise of ANY kind
They should just stop having concerts until there's no more noise/alca-noise/this-noise/that-nose/whatever-noise
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
so
I had litereally just finished the episode
Gungnir is cursed D:
YOU'RE RIGHT
oh god
unless there's some big reveal incoming
but not in XV
:D
so
and Fine wasn't here for this concert
not Maria
Shirabe was fine
OHGODOHFUCKOHFUCKOHGOD
also
no Maria at Zwei Wing concert
so
and Maria wasn't there for S1 in any scene
Bikki didn't arrive to the concert in G until AFTER the noise and FIS showed up
exactly
along with everyone else
she was late
except Bikki didn't go
maybe they'll come up with some excuse like "Carol dumped the body" or something
or they didn't add Enki in because they hadn't planned for him at that point
that being said, it's honestly more likely his body was moved
Shirabe threw a bunch of saw blades at some noise that were surrounding two soldiers
I don't think that's neccesarily true
Again, no singing. At all. From either of them
Maria wasn't thinking 100% straight, either
~~think of all the money Marvel would've missed out on!~~
100% rational thought, and Endgame would've never happened
Thor could've EASILY stopped Thanos just by aiming for the head, as Thanos himself admits. He doesn't aim for the head because he's emotionally charged in that scene and wants to see Thanos suffer rather than just die quickly.
~~sorry for the mini-rant at the end, but it is getting pretty annoying~~
Seriously people, stop expecting every character ever to always think 100% rationally under any and all levels of stress.
So no, she couldn't have just used Thousand Tears to take care of it. She wasn't thinking properly enough to even contemplate the possibility of doing so
You can't tell me she was of rational thought throughout ANY of that
Tsubasa slashing into the sky at random until Maria holds her back
people dying, structures getting destroyed, the vamp girl attacking
then the everything else that was going on
And again, no singing even after going in gears
You could already see Tsubasa panicking quite a bit just from the appearance of the magic circles in the sky.
I doubt they were 100% sound of mind at that time
Even after the vamp girl appeared and targeted Basa, no singing
But yeah, there was a distant lack of singing throughout the whole noise attack
so they probably assummed all of those 100,000 seats were filled
and the concert most likely sold out
the concert hall's max capacity
The 100,000 was likely a max number
Note how neither her nor Maria were actually singing after they went into gear mode
and thus not thinking straight
Basa was at least partly panicking
so I doubt they're getting 129,000+ deaths unless tens of thousands of soldiers died during the carrier attack
They stated that the concert hall held 100,000 people
I"m pretty sure we all agree it doesn't make sense
I don't think anyone is arguing the hall's architecture not making sense
then you'd have the other gear users to deal with said ground noise
and killed a large portion of them before they even hit the ground
who probably would've started attacking the alca-nosie as they were falling towards the concert hall
for one, we'd have AA-gun Chris
the situation likely wouldn't ahve unfolded 100% exactly the same way if the other gear users were part of the audience during the attack
you're using IRL logic in the Symphogear universe
that's the problem
and how much of S1 repeated already
because writers
Not if there was a hostage
traffic jams will exist as long as traffic itself exists
~~otherwise we'd have another Kanade sacrifice~~
Also, I'm glad Hibiki and the others were late
BUT AT LEAST THEY LOOK COOL
....which it usually is, actually
The nice thing about anime is that we can have these architectual death traps and they'll never actually cause death unless it's part of the story
Honestly, I would probably believe it without question if the show mentioned it
~~the alchemists built it~~
Just jump up and wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
I would love to be able to FUCKING FLY while singing without using any wires or anything
awesome as the shows are, almost none of the concert scenes in Symphogear would actually work IRL
that moment in the first ep is probably the closest we'll get to a true sniper Chris
I'll accept the gears are autoaiming for them only if the writers come out and say they are
Chris the "JINX YOURSELF NOT ME" sniper
~~and we'd be calling BS on it~~
If she had used Thousand Tears, though, I'm pretty sure the writers would've had it hitting only alca-noise
~~or blade dodge into a crowd member~~
actually, came fairly close to causing debris to land on that girl even before the vamp got her
She came pretty close to killing that random girl the vamp took hostage
Realistically speaking, she probably would've ended up killing people inadvertently
^^^
But the gear users overall seem to be in pretty good control of their aim
that does play a huge factor
true
and neither soldier got hit
IT'S SPREADING
GOD
OH
It 100% did
It did
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
THAT'S NOT FUNNY
wtf is "toof of heaven"? xD
oh yeah, that floating text reminds me
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
THAT WASN'T FUNNY EITHER
<@95712223212601344> THAT'S NOT FUNNY <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
yay me
it's......I forgot the word, actually
As someone mentioned earlier, it's not blood
also, please stay away from me <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
~~ryona fetish confirmed~~
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
but was it worth it?
the one positive about the concert massacre
lots of good <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> reaction faces
lol
~~and crush them in the debris~~
or practical
"sweet as hell" isn't always safe <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hanging above water
only 2 exits
I ain't no architect either, but even I can tell you wouldn't want to build that thing IRL
awesomeness aside
Show of hands, who here thinks the concert hall makes 100% perfect sense?
11 is the number they won the lottery with <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm guessing that rich person's last name begins with "M"
you're seriously gonna remind us of that everyday? <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
that's LITERALLY a gun-shaped building
.....that's a gun-shaped building
As someone who lives near fault lines, I don't like the idea of being anywhere near that thing
and you have to work in said office everyday
god, imagine having an office on the very top of that arch
also, why?
wtf is that thing?
oh god
and pretty popular ~~in Japan~~
Symhogear is currently airing
~~Fine took out the aliens~~
I'm gonna laugh if later on Emmerich comes out as a Symphogear fan
~~mostly because I generally don't care~~
Actually, even with KC characters I mostly don't know where the names come from
I generally don't pay attention to ship names ~~outside of Kantai Collection~~
you just never said it while I was around <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I do
that's probably literally true
oh god
Independence Day confirmed Symphogear canon
~~I was warned, and ignored the warning~~
~~I forgot about the title 3 minutes into the show~~
<@440138597539119114> MOTHER FUCKER, I WILL END YOU
meanwhile, ya'll should be ashamed of yourselves and think on what you've done
now's a good excuse to play some racing
I'm getting the fuck out of here before I make any more not funny jokes like that <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
THE NOT FUNNY IS SPREADING
~~was he named in the credits?~~
clearly, he has motive
AND he was unhappy with Tsubasa's rehearsal
lolnope
until she ends up killing someone
violent and impulsive
and she ain't coming back
it's a random girl
not happening
lol, no
and again, growth spurt
similar, but not same
the eye color isn't 1:1, though
just gotta watch a girl your age get brutally murdered in front of her favorite singer
super small
him/her/they/whatever
you've doomed him
that poor kid
getting murdered at your idol's concert is one thing. Getting murdered right in front of your idol while she's pointing a sword at you is quite another
I think I would've preferred that
I thought for sure she was just gonna get crushed by debris Tsubasa loosens
although not on quite the same scale
We've seen death like this before
~~I don't like how easily someone can edit the liquid white~~
I don't like that screenshot
Daily reminder that AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
but that still makes a huge roadblock for new fans
sure
200 episodes means I'd pretty much have to devote all my focus on it to catch up
It is if you still want to watch other series as well
especially for someone who's BRAND NEW to the fandom and hasn't seen a single one
that's a lot, mate
My problem with trying to get into Jojo is there's so many episodes across all the series
And why can't they just do it now?
how is it too late?
unless, by some act of god, they actually make an official one (which I doubt)
I'd probably make a Symphogear tarot deck if I ever decide to actually practice my art
but we can at least get somewhat close with some of them
well full meaning, no
I mean, the arcana have actual meaning behind them
apart from her gear theme?
Does she fully fit the death card, though?
So which one does Kirika fit?
~~Is Hibiki the fool?~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
especially since some probably share an arcana
although it would probably be difficult to find a proper arcana for all of them
There will be <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~Symphogear tarot deck when?~~
I'm actually waiting until I learn how to use tarot properly before I open them up
I have a Fate/GO tarot deck I haven't opened yet <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so many different names <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
or maybe I have and just haven't payed attention
but I've never seen coins used as a minor arcana
well I figured that much out
coins are tarot?
but I'm not super familiar with tarot
I didnt' really, either
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> is good too, but not at good as Garie
sadly, there are
and thus, hard to catch up on being brand-new
but there's still the fact that it is, in fact, a long running series
and sure, it's not much for a "long running series"
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921> best autoscorer
*waits patiently to be proven wrong*
Hibiki can't break into my home and give me a huge hug
~~In that case, I better get my art skills up to snuff and capitalize on this market!~~
and me, so that's 2
there's 1 sale
Like, let's be realistic here, if there was a Symphogear Tarot deck announced after the end of XV, how many here would actually be interested in buying it?
better suited (hehe) for a Doujin artist
The merchandising potential is probably quite limited for a big-time company
Tarot decks aren't exactly a super-popular thing that every anime series does
that's a huge "if", I'll admit without issue
but if they wanted to, they could
I realize it's unlikely
I'm just asking "why?"
you're the one who said it's "too late"
What, exactly, would stop them if they do, in fact, want to do it?
forgot about face
oh yeah, face
if you can't yell about life loss, yell about structure damage
the fact that there was an attack at all
even if the death toll was 0
any reason you can get to yell at Genjuuro for not doing his job properly
well, they'd probably have *something* they feel would be a better use of the adapters
Fudou's the stereotypical unpleasable Asian father
Damned if you do, damned if you don't
"Why are you wasting our resources like this?!"
Although then you'd probably get yelled at for having them on security if there's no noise attack
and realistically speaking, they probably should've been on security detail if they were gonna be there at all.
for better AND for worse
with actual, human feelings
Now we have an actual human
Robobasa is gone now
exactly
After Bikki, she's allowing herself to feel feelings again
in S1 she was more-or-less trying to make herself into an emotionless robot
I'm talking about *why* she woudl be angsting instead of being edgelord
I'm not talking about her angsting
also, who put "and maria" in the channel description? xD
She's not the same Basa as back in S1
Because character development?
NOT FUNNY <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
meme
boom
and when they find such a moment
some people watch anime specifically looking for memeable moments
it's called "Engrish"
They do
the more valuable you are to potentional employers, the more wage you can negotiate
I'm saying they would cost more in general because they would have more skills that employers want
that's not what I"m saying
you're completely ignoring cost here
and again, expensive
sometimes that sounds just as bad as Engrish
and then there's that accent thing meuths mentioned
~~well, two lines for two languages, but you get my point~~
are you gonna pay the thousands of dollars for that ONE line?
but if you only have one line and it would cost you thousands to hire someone to do that ONE line
sure
and the ones that are there are either are probably pretty fuckign expensive because of it
There's not enough VA's that speak both languages fluently, though
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
~~jerk~~
that edit changes everything I just said <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ah, ok
you'd either have to pay for them to move, or pay for their hotel
as long as said VA is living in the US
that would still be way too expensive
Though they might be able to get something in place someday where the companies can hire English VA"s and have them do their voiceovers entirely via internet
and English VA's probably aren't gonna move there when pretty much all of their jobs are gonna be here in the US
we'd need a lot more English VA's living in their country for it to be reasonably feasible
and that's why they don't do it already
~~they learned their lesson from S1~~
a total population of 1,000,000,000, and people would still not be happy about a terrorist attack killing 100,000
100k people dead is a big deal regardless of %
unless they become an important plot point later on
And we'll probably never know what political deals went on behind the scenes regarding Maria and the rest of FIS
the Americans have no dog in this particular fight
Either way, this is 100% on the Japanese government to save face
That being said, it's unlikely the American populace knows of/cares about Maria at all
So her failure would either be seen as the Japanese government's fault, or "what you expect" from her
If anything, Maria would be a traitor to the American populace
She's no longer with the US, thus the US is no longer responsible for whatever terrorist attack she fails to foil
So the US would no longer have any face to save with the attack
Is she still officially a US agent, though?
Maria?
wait, which agent?
and this season has been a...."pleasant" reminder of that
We're pretty much all aware of how much of a dickhead Fudou is, especially towards his family
That's what everyone's worried about, yes
most likely
politicians love their faces
guitars are WAY cheaper
but "actually decent"
not even "cheapest" quality
but you can still get a decent guitar for that much money
well yeah
They easily go for thousands if you want any amount of quality
and that's at CHEAPEST
enough to buy a new game console with
I think the cheapest I saw was like, $400 USD?
even students ones are hundreds of dollars
Problem with that is Kotos are fucking expensive <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'd be playing Koto instead
not with singing, though
I actually do want to do anime covers
(although they probably start off with musicaly-inclined roles)
they get roles outside of music franchises as well
so maybe I should start up a youtube channel and start doing anime covers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I have noticed a lot of anisingers on youtube getting VA roles lately, though
especially since my vocal range sucks atm, and vocal range is pretty fucking important for a VA
It's gonna take me at least a few years more to get good enough to even TRY for a job
and with me already being 30 years old.....I feel like someone younger than me would get any "newface opportunities"
(that's how it is in the US, at least. Not sure if it's different in JP)
There's a reason why your favorite VA has a long list of voices they've done. It's because they're the only ones getting all the opportunities
Biggest thing that holds me back is the sheer amount of competition, and the fact that studios don't like hiring new faces
I've considered being a VA myself before. I was told I'd be pretty good at adding emotions to voices (and with how emotional I am in general, I can totally see that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )
Being one of the VAs that help make all this a reality
You know what would be cool?
yeah
Might even be that an American studio tries it with a character that needs a JP VA, and starts a partnership with a JP company that eventually leads to the JP company trying out hiring an English VA.
So it's much more likely some small startup will try it first. Then (hopefully) they see success and bigger companies look at that success and say "hmm.....I think I want in on that money!"
Japanese companies are NOTORIOUS for never taking risks
but it's more likely to happen with a smaller studio taking a risk, TBH
well obviously
so your example is completely lost on me <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
no idea who tf you're talking about
Gonna be honest with you, dude
so it'll be easier, and more cost-effective, to hire out English-speaking VA's if you have an English-speaking character in your anime
What we really need is more partnerships between JP and NA studios
"in studio" is industry standard
if any at all
I"m not sure how many don't
pretty much every VA does it in studio
VA's usually don't have the same kind of gear in their homes that a company has in their studio
and I think part of it is audio quality
it's just not really used
well, technically it is all there
but like.....what if we have better in the future?
I think we're all pretty aware why things are the way they are today
when we did stop talking hypothetical and start talking reality? <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
And then, somehow, the convo got dragged back into present-day without me knowing
where technology is fucking amazing and we can hire VA's over the internet and shit
but I'm talking about the future
well yeah, right now
but if you want your American President to sound....well, American, it'd be cool if you could hire an American VA
crazy thought, I know
maybe you'd want to hire an English VA for an English-only role?
like....I dunno.....President Trump?
but what if, and I knwo this is a crazy thought, but what if there's a character in an anime....THAT ONLY SPEAKS ENGLISH
Another thing, you're assuming dual language for EVERY role that has English at all
I like the memes, but I really hope he doesn't just get shoehorned in
He'll appear for one last meme
somehow
someway
I can all but guarantee he's returning
More a "well I guess I'm dead anyway, so might as well let Maria play hero in my absence"
I don't think Ver was really even trying to "redeem" himself
yeah, Ver's "redemption" was more of a deathbed confession than anything else
and if she is ally, it'll be largely due to memory loss
at least, not that we know of
Carol wasn't turned ally
~~but I want to like her!~~
Maybe we'll have singing villains that aren't future allies for once
~~or XDU~~
~~you never know when you're gonna add in new villain songs for the Live concert~~
I mean....singing is pretty fucking important to the series....
~~usually until I've hit 10 or so~~
~~my thoughts do that a lot, TBH~~
We went off on like.....3 or 4 different tangents <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
~~there's still plenty of time in today!~~
*shakes fist in air*
one day
one day, I will get used to using the proper channels
~~also, I'm pretty sure none of this is <#431914167826382860> anymore~~ <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
point is, I wanna play Koto D:
THAT'S ALL BESIDE THE POINT
ANYWAY
you live in a very different place than me, than
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
~~I'm talking stereotypes, here. stop disrupting with your "actual life experiences"!~~
that's probably not even strictly an American thing
and plus, what American *hasn't* dreamed of playing lead guitar <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
but don't produce as beautiful as a sound
~~been wearing it for several years now~~
~~I already ordered my relic fragment pendant~~
imagine Symphogear leads to being a really fucking good singer <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and that's as far as I'm conversing with you on that subject
people are way too damn quick to cry "pedophile" in anime communities
so
and like, I haven't seen too many IRL 16 year-olds with thighs like that
a FANTASY CHARACTER THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN REAL LIFE
is like
Kirika
ok, but keep in mind
While I agree they should've placed less focus on the fanservice, I won't apologize for enjoying what was there.
oh yeah, and there was some pretty good Kirithighs in that scene, too
~~also socks, apparently~~
sue us
some people like pole dancing
yes we did
yes
"yet" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
~~you have a sock fetish?~~
although it's always nice when they can do a good henshin without gratuitous amounts of fan service
~~I enjoyed the pole dancing~~
I thought you were talking about the noise at the concert <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
wait, which noise scene are you talking about?
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
exceptional?.....
nothing....
*twitches*
if you still don't like it afterwards....feel free to drop it after all
Because again, that's where all the interesting stuff happens
in all seriousness, though, give the rest of the episode a chance when you have the time
~~no it's not! he must be properly shunned like the scoundrel he is!~~
the interesting part happens in the last half of the episode
probably
ROOSTER REASONS
for.....reasons
Kanade roosting like a rooster
(and of course, he's coming back)
time to drop it and move on
me too, but still
Even I took it a bit further than I should have
convo's over
dude
so adorbs~
dess
anyway
I don't need some self-righteous jerk calling me a pedophile just because I enjoyed adult proportions on an anime character
which is why I didn't engage outside of "I'm not apologizing"
I could tell right away they weren't going to listen to reason
I don't
not my fault they're so judgemental
~~sparkle confirmed writer for the show~~
just remember this: very many "underage" characters in anime have adult proportions
I'll forgive you then, poi
Well alright
~~and by "enjoy" I mean AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA~~
~~enjoy the <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> ~~
later guys
anyway, now that that's cleared up, I really need to get started on this fanfic of mine or it's never gonna get written at all :B
<@!302063351767498752> thank you for apologizing, and I hope you can learn from this experience
and neither are a lot of other anime fans deemed "pedophiles" by so many
I'm not the slightest bit attracted to anime chars that have the characteristic of an actual IRL child
~~Genjuuro gets Vanessa~~
We've seen almost NOTHING of Vanessa so far
I agree
No need to attack my "fragile manhood" when I don't even have any, mate
I have virtually NO masculinity
This isn't about my masculinity
<@476058996315389953> excuse you?
~~technically we don't know that for certain~~. But yeah, it's most likely not their intention
Dx
it's hard
but
which I'm trying to learn to get over
maybe not, but it does feel that way
*sigh*
because men are inherently flawed
of course
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
OH RIGHT
OH
who's trans again?
trans?
wait
she very well could be
That, and Chris has a whoooooole lot of personal issues to deal with before she even *considers* the possibility of dating
I find her stomping attack a little weird too
but *shrugs* it's something I'll just have to get used to, I guess
I just don't like her clothing style
She can be as "chuuni, but actually legit" as she wants
It's not her personality I dislike
and we just saw it's first use
The gimmick everyone else is talking about to justify her outfit, IMO, is a gimmick that wears out after first use
at least from my personal tastes/preferances
and I'm right on that
I was saying that her supposed gimmick had worn off
that "appeal" was from everyone else
it didn't
I....did?
I didn't like it from the beginning
no
Unless they plan on changing her clothes from now on, it's gonna be far more than two episodes
I just don't like the whole "contrast their actual personality" thing in general
eh
like, the gimmick's worn off, and she's still wearing it
it's just....ridiculous
except now that we know to take her seriously
y tho?
but
probably
~~not through a child's heart~~
She looks like she belongs in a children's book
very out of place for the kind of villain she is
like some 5 year old kid drew it
Her design looks.....I dunno
~~Eliza next hostage taker~~
~~she won't do just one hostage next time~~
well, she wouldn't do it exactly the same way
I feel like vamp girl is gonna do that *at least* one more time
~~don't forget hostage situations~~
~~and hostage situations~~
~~it's an important distinction~~
not bat
vampire
furry
not the Eliza thing
wait, Maria was there for the Millarc thing
And I"m just saying "dude, I know."
raiden was pointing out my subjectiveness like as if I was somehow unaware of the subjective nature of my subjectiveness
I hate fortnite myself, but if someone else plays it and enjoys it a lot, I'm not gonna come in like some fun police and order them to stop
~~she does have nice thighs~~
crazy as it sounds, I'm even ok with people liking Fortnite
I'm ok with that difference of opinion
and you know what?
you do
I don't like her outfit
but I'm not so selfish as to *demand* that you do
I mean, I guess I'd like it if you all just agreed with me
Like, I'm saying *I* don't like her outfit. I'm not saying everyone else should hate it too
And like....I don't *think* I was trying to make my opinion out to be factual?
'cause it aint news to me
like.....is that news to anyone?
I mean.....yeah?
Would ruin too many good surprises <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'm not sure I really want to be able to predict the future like that, either.
If I already knew how it was gonna be followed up, there'd be no point in speculating about "ifs"
that's why those three statements of mine started with the word "if"
I mean, if we already knew everything we can expect, we'd probably also already know if vampgirl is a shitty character or a good one
So I'm holding off on making any final, ultimate judgements until the end of the season
if they follow it up with something good, though, then she might actually be a good character
If they follow it up with some garbage....then yeah, she's a shitty character
If that *one* scene is all they have for her....then yeah. She's a shitty character
'cause ultimately? What makes you a good/bad villain comes down to more than just one scene, no matter how evil you were in that one scene
I wanna know how they're gonna follow up with her
but eh
and Maria gets stuck with herself <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
...pacito!
Dess they are
Dess
<@431656503490117632>
bot versions of Shirabe, Kirika, and Maria
in short, they're the bots we have here
order now, and I'll throw in me, coming in to light it ablaze everytime you crash it!
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Basa with detachable ~~and destructible~~ bike!
Where did I imply that wouldn't be my first? <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
incoming vamp in bikini <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
~~I could always 3D print my own~~
money will break through to them eventually!
~~Maria, Shirabe, Kirika figmas when?~~
you know full damn well every Symphogear girl is gonna get a bikini figma eventually
hilariously, no I"m not <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~bikini figure when?~~
she still hot no matter what, tho
(I'm only half-joking)
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
mah waifu
but
~~then again, Fine's wasn't super great, either~~
I kinda want a redemption arc for her, but DAMN it'll be hard to write a good one
yay us! <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
and hey, we even managed to do it without killing each other first!
as long as we come to an understanding
it's alright
~~millarc bikini when?~~
time will tell what the rest of her character is like
I think her outfit is ugly as heck, but the vamp chick underneath is still hot, at the very least
you can hate someone's outfit while still liking that someone who's wearing the outfit
there's quite a large difference between an outfit and a personality
I said I dislike her *outfit* and am holding off on judging her *character* until later
because I didn't say I dislike millarc
You misinterpreted what I said, then
but looking back at it now......eeesh
I actually kind of overlooked his creepiness the first time around
I like his memes, but I can't say I'm a huge fan of his character
opinions are opinions. only facts are facts
it's a way for them to be able to keep adding more and more content to the game
~~at this point I'm almost wondering if I should just stick exclusively to emotes~~
I'm doing my very best here, so please help me out a little <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
if it were something I could figure out on my own, I would've by now
but I *need* someone to teach me
I *want* to get better
I know I suck at communication
I don't understand what I"m doing wrong, so please stop assuming I'm just some asshole tryign to start fires or w/e and teach me how to do it right
but I'm trying, damnit! >_>
And yeah, I've been around a LOT of assholes before finding any less than assholish communities, so I might be a little slower on catching genuine kindness
sorry that I"m not 100% perfect at communication, but I'm trying my best
why is asking for clarification such a sin to you guys?
I'm not demanding <_<
don't assume I'm just out to start fires everywhere I go. I'm giving you space to clarify, so please clarify
if that's a miscommunication, clarify it
That sentence, to me, reads as "I feel like you guys are attacking my opinion"
so maybe stop assuming I am?
I'm not trying to make this personal at all
not mine
those were your words
"While I agree with those last points, the impression the overall message gives me is that there is a "correct way" to enjoy something"
let us clarify our point without taking it as "I'm right and you're wrong"
I just ask you give us the same courtesy
I'm giving you space to clarify
so don't go trying to point out the sin in me unless you're gonna look in the mirror first
you jumped to conclusions about our perspective first
Maybe not your actual intention, but it's not our actual intention either
It kinda feels like to me like you're the one who's trying to make out some "right" way to enjoy something.
and guess what? that's just as valid as anyone that tries to critisize as they watch
I'd rather think about and process everything after the fact
especially if I"m being critical as I'm watching
I find that being critical ruins a lot of shows for me, personally.
if you can nitpick details and still enjoy it, go for it
we're not saying there's only one way to enjoy Symphogear
I'm not gonna enjoy *any* anime
but if I sit there nitpicking every little detail they've fucked up
it has many
I'm aware of Symphogears flaws
^that too
but sometimes you just want to relax after a long day and let your brain rest while you enjoy some fun
sometimes you might want to think about what you're watching
not every series has to be a flawless 10/10 masterpiece with deep symbolism
and you know what? That's ok
some series actually are better enjoyed with your brain "off"
it just lets you enjoy a series that has flaws without being nitpicky and ruining the experience for yourself
turning your brain off isn't necessarily just shutting your eyes to the flaws
~~someone find us that XDU relic!~~
or a reboot
of course, that would require either IRL AU shenanigans
See what it'd be like, and how it compares to the Symphogear we have now
I'd be interested in seeing a version of Symphogear where each season is given 24 episodes instead of 12
but it tends to be higher when I go into it already knowing it's gonna have some BS in it
for me the limit kinda varies series to series
*cough*topdad*cough*
even when she's not in nice mode, she's in nice mode
always
literally
Hibiki is literally always in "nice" mode
Except Hibiki
I'll still spot some flaws here and there as things go along
that's not to say I turn my brain off completely, mind you
That's how my brain tends to work with anime and such
It's kind of like a "wow, I can't believe the series was so good even having all these flaws!"
and when I do start to think about the anime (including what it did wrong), I find myself appreciating it more
For me, personally, I like to think about it more after the fact and give it time to sink in before I make absolute final judgements
free hugs for anyone that wants one <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
well, there's a difference between using it as a reason and using it as an excuse
~~I did justify my actions. "being around assholes"~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*offers hug*
<@279341087494242304> sorry for the argument earlier, poi
yet another thing to work on
.....and on that note, I"m not sure if I've ever actually properly apologized before.....
and forgive each other
it feels nice that we can apologize to each other
like dunkek earlier calling me a pedophile, but then coming back later and apologizing
for the most part, I can get in big fights here and we can ACTUALLY WORK THINGS OUT
One thing I will say I love about being here, miscommunications and all
~~but if they take all my sugar, I'll be able to lose weight easier~~
but at the same time, I *need* to move
like, move to an IRL neighborhood where people are nice, but end up acting aggressive towards them
I'm kinda scared about moving for this very reason
~~and then paraphrase myself 100 times~~
but instead end up cause more
because I'm attempting to clarify my point as much as possible to avoid miscommunication
it's heavily ironic
I tend to overexplain myself
which is a good thing
and while I haven't seen much moderating going on, I think that's less "mods are lazy/don't care" and more "mods haven't needed to deal with too much BS lately"
but that's why we have mods
an open server means less sensible people can join without issue
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
....can we do group hugs?
so....is everything all calm now?
although sometimes I fuck up there, too
I tend to try to avoid sarcasm, unless I'm confident it'll be read as such
I'm working on it
I will tell you this right now. 9/10 when I appear to be mean, I'm not actually trying to be mean
I think a lot of people would've hated topdad less if the writing behind him wasn't so atrocious.
And I wanna see an update on how things turned out, damnit!
The writing behind that whole thing was one of the biggest flaws in the series, IMO
....Chris needs lots of hugs D:
it's....actually kinda messed up Chris is the fanservice character with a past like that....
I'd rather them not bring it up at all than bring it up and handle such a sensitive subject matter poorly
~~which is incredibly unhealthy, but merch sales!~~
Chris is just bottling it up and not dealing with it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I was already uncomfortable with Fine's sexual abuse
yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh...I don't think that's something we need constantly shoved in our face
like, the WWE kind of wants us to forget about motorbike Undertaker, but he's still official WWE canon as far as I'm aware
forgetting about somethign isn't really a retcon, IMO, since it doesn't actually change whatever it is we're trying to ignore
~~at least by my definition~~
anything and everything that changes any previous element in a story is a retcon
that'd be another AU Symphogear series to watch xP
well to be fair, they never knew until AXZ that there was going to be another season
and every season also had parts that felt like they weren't giving enough time to flesh out the idea
*shakes fist in air*
one day
One day I will memorize it's name
I"m glad now
ok, not plauisble
unless they somehow appealed to that. Though that would be difficult to do without him calling Bullshit (and being 100% right)
alrigth, true
I hate how fuckign plausible that is
....
~~Fudou's secretly an American spy~~
mostly likely though, it'll be the US government yet again
~~watch as he becomes the main villain instead of miku~~
especially not with how much they've done it this season already
there's no way they'd miss an opportunity like this to show how much of a stereotypical Asian father he is
and I'm not changing my mind on that unless something else actually does happen instead
they are 100% going that route
Although he doesn't really cover anime outside of the popular shonen series that literally everyone makes videos on if they do anime at all
~~this is what Matpat is for!~~
which is, honestly speaking, probably the vast majority of the fanbase
As solo said, it' s a minute detail that adds nothing to the narrative, and very little entertainment value to people who don't care
and hey, more content creators getting money!
then if you care, you can go watch said youtuber
it's better off being left to some youtuber or something figuring out how it works
very rarely does anime explain the science behind *anything* unless it's some sciency show meant to be educational on that very subject
~~not to mention all the additional time it would take up to explain said science~~
like, it can be interesting to learn, but do we really *need* the scientific details of how everything in the series works?
I don't think it really needs any sort of explanation beyond what they gave it, honestly
it's probably more or less a "find a scientist to explain how it's possible"
They probably didn't know enough about the science of genes to come up with a full and proper explanation for it
I don't think so?
He was a terrible dad less because of walking out on Hibiki and more because of "I literally only exist for this plot point"
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
I hate that I made myself think about that <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
It's not funny anymore
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
that's how they're gonna shoehorn him in
Oh god
~~for <:Ver:336656981144109066> ~~
~~and foreshadowing~~
2 more days until the next wave of suffering <:Ver:336656981144109066>
like....what would be his motive?
Why is everyone dead set on Fudou kidnapping Miku?
XDU already has AU shenanigans going on
and give them songs there!
make them playable units in XDU
better idea!
ooh!
~~maybe an OVA?~~
But damnit, I want an autoscorer quartet song!
~~apart from maybe merch shilling~~
would be hard to come up with a valid excuse for it
they most definitely should **not**
but at the same time
I kinda want them to bring back <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I don't think they would've put that there if they were completely done with Carol
I very clearly remember Elfnein's character bio from last season mentioning something about looking for Carol
I'm pretty sure Carol's coming back
~~including fine?~~
I hope to be surprised by that
and we'll all hate them for it
They'll find a reason
/flee
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
I don't wanna rewatch the episode
......goddamnit Saki <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
don't do it! D:
don't D:
That reminds me....I still haven't ever completed Ar Tonelico 2 :B
I don't think you could even give them such an order
they wouldn't give two fucks about Nephilim
and yeah, noise target ONLY humans
they're not treated as relics at all
but I'm pretty confident the black market was mentioned in some conversation
I'll have to rewatch, because I could be remembering wrong
that's what I remember
but the gear users had been dealing with alca-noise summoned at other places by other militias
The Val Verde were the only ones with the illuminati connetion IIRC
but I'd have to watch the episode again to be 100% sure
I'm pretty sure I remember them mentioning various militias in various regions buying them off the black market
they're being sold on the black market
I mean
just wondering if anything *official* has been said
and what I've more-or-less assumed
seems likely
With Carol there was an explanation so you didn't have to think much on it
I'm talking about all the alca-noise that have been appearing since AXZ
well I'm not talking about htem, anyway
I got confused
ok
wait, they're still spawning out of the sealed treasury?
Technically, the alca-noise could probably be made by just about anyone with Carol's recipe and the necessary materials
So...did they ever confirm where all these noise are coming from? Like, is there a finite supply that's running out, or is there more being produced somewhere?
~~only during the release?~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you might want to mute this channel tomorrow, then <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and no mention of the black market, so either it's in another episode, or I remembered that bit wrong
"Doing the math in my head!!!"
also
ah
right before Tsubasa did her own to kill it
A giant alca-noise was summoned....and did an attack with an attack card
oh fuck, I forgot the alchemists sang
I didn't recall any noise having an attack card!
oh fuck, this alca-noise has a fucking attack card :O
~~all this just to look for a line I may not have remembered right, lol~~
I forgot just how freakin epic this battle was
~~Genjuuro attains godhood~~
I love how movies are a valid training method in the Symphoverse
"Watching that movie about fighting tanks last night really worked!"
hahahhah
I doubt it
although I don't see how they could attack Nephilim in a manner that would kill humans, unless to like, piss it off and have it lash out or something?
They can probably technically target *anything* so long as the intent is to kill humans
I'm pretty sure they can target buldings in such a way if the intent is to make it collapse and kill humans in the collapse
humans, or human structures that could potentially fall on humans,
they only target humans, even being controlled by the cane
I'm just playing them straight in discord
That was definitely the best one
it was probably overlooked the first time for a reason <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and they'll probably honestly fix the date if they notice later, but who knows if they'll notice
they'll for sure fix that
just saying
or they could...you know...fix it in the XV blurays
Love the new emote~
<:KirikaSpook:602224871585480776>
also
It's probably something they'll fix in the blu-ray release <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
2045 has it on a Wednesday
and yeah, 2044 should be a Tuesday, not Wednesday
which season is that calendar from?
hence the name "archives"
and usually are
2045
Also, two transformations this episode~
I've seen at least one deny it
WHO SAID FUDOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE WORKING FOR THE BAD GUYS?
WHO SAID IT?
HAHHAHAA
can't have guys being redeemed in a magical girl anime
he's a guy
Of course there won't be any redemption for Fudou
after being boosted by Hibiki
in mid air
yes
And her sniper attack was pretty awesome
Horay for Chris!
Also, we got an actual sniper moment for Chris!
"and the number is expected to grow"
probably more
He obviously has some personal issues against S.O.N.G. and the Symphogears
he very blatantly stated "songs can't save the world"
I mean
especially after she finds out about Fudou's involvement with the new trio
She'll have issues, but I don't think she'll end up turning
I don't think Basa will turn
For once, the Japanese government is the bad guy <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~inb4 they fix nothing~~
of course, we won't know for sure what they will/won't fix until the blurays actually do come out
being how many I've seen in anime
I would be shocked if they didn't exist
Everything doesn't makes sense to him, it seems
~~also, why is it literally everytime I see you in a convo, you're trying to disprove something?~~
so hey, any chance you took a screenshot of this archive, Armados?
that would actually explain his insanity, TBH
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~he got Nephilim as a newborn~~
ok, that's true
oh
I doubt he learned everything he needed to know about Nephilim overnight
and it makes plenty sense for him to have it for over 30 years, quite frankly
that's just speculation and assumptions on your part
That doesn't 100% disprove the archive thing
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I don't know too many anime fans who haven't at least seen that clip
I think we're aware who did it first
~~boob. reload.~~
~~too little time to appreciate the cleaveage~~
and they ultimately beat them by resotring the budget for the final attack <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
As much as I enjoyed Kiri's thighs, I'd have to say hers is my least favorite henshin so far
but again, bias <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Shirabe was a close second
Bikki's was my favorite, but I'm a bit biased on that, so....
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
~~don't forget the boob reload~~
could also be foreshadowing a new module, I guess
but it feels like there's a reason they're pointing out "normal operation"
Well maybe it's just a random detail
Either that, or Maria's forced to do hers right after Basa
Maria is probably next, with Tsubasa's failed attempt after
I feel like that's what they're leading up to with that detail in every henshin
and then for the first time, we won't see "all green. Normal operation" on the gear
I think we might get a basa *attempt*
literally always
~~maybe he sides with Milaarc because he's a vampire too~~
~~maybe he just can't see well in bright lights~~
Yoyo ice skating, pole dancing, martial arts, BOOBS
~~they wanted to take it to the boob reload~~
Pretty much, yeah
~~sexy as she is, I don't think I'd want her coming for my blood anyway~~
Milaarc won't be coming for my blood
so
I'm A+
~~I can assure you my blood is not soil~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
RH soil or something like that
only the rarest of bloods can touch her lips
she's a vampire with very delicate tastes
my blood's not *that* special
Millarc would have no reason to raid my house
night, dess~
there are numerous attacks a normal person wouldn't survive being done throughout the series
It also mentioned her not being able to use ignite module
~~we need that as an emote~~
both of them have good outfits
~~Watch as Kirika turns out to secretly be an oracle~~
I thought Adam was "perfect"
~~and the boob reloads~~
have fun with the suffering <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
well I"m off to napz
~~BOOB. RELOAD.~~
we don't need him
fuck fudou
The way Henshins should be
I liked Shirabe's transformation. Showed off what makes her amazing as a character, with just a sprinkle of fanservice.
~~chasing down a motorcycle gang~~
Vroom vroom, motherfuckers!
~~inb4 pocket dimension boobs confirmed canon~~
~~inb4 that's literally his reasoning~~
"Those young millennials were fucking our country up anyway!"
Someone contact Kaneko and ask him where Chris's ammo is coming from!
yeah, that's true. She reloaded the gun multiple times in that scene
Like.....does her symphogear just make them out of phonic gain or something?
It is an interesting question to thing about, though
~~there's a pocket dimension inside of them~~
her boobs have infinite ammo storage
obviously, her boobs
I'd like to see someone try to reload a revolver by just throwing the bullets at it
~~BOOB. RELOAD.~~
and yes, there was oppai during a lot of it
it was at least half the henshin sequence
Chris was showing off gun flinging for more than just the very end
Chris's also focused a lot more on Chris's character than Kiri's
Too much focus on how sexy she is, not enough focus on what her character is
I"m just saying even Chris's henshin felt less sexualized than Kirika's
I'm not saying that
of course not
and of course, her "bang" at the end
but there was still a lot of her gun slinging and whatnot as well
so yeah, lots of oppai focus
and Chris....I'm pretty sure *she's* supposed to be the fanservice character
I barely even noticed Shirabe's butt, because they did a really good job with her ice skating and whatnot
sure, but they focus on much more than butt and boobs
maybe
and keep in mind the animator had to redo it because it was too lewd the first time, and even after that they had to cut out 10 seconds
That feels to me like fanservice was the intention
and when the camera wasn't focused on her feet or her thighs, it was pointing down at her pantsu
I mean, she was pole dancing almost exclusively upside down
~~when was Kirika the fanservice character?~~
with her upside down
yeah, as much I liked Kiri-thighs, there was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much focus on the pole-dancing
well yeah, but it had an official name
which I guess *would* be more powerful than Red Hot Blaze
the hex.....soemthing or other
then again they were using that.....what's it called again?
although probably more useful against the coffin in Ep 1
~~worth it~~
~~how did he come back, tho?~~
Just ignore him guys, he's only here to pick fights
I'm just gonna completely ignore you from now on. You're not here to discuss Symphogear with Symphogear fans, you're just an attention seeker, and I'm done giving you that attention
and are just here to pick a fight over literally everything
you're incapable of admitting you're wrong
oh, that's right
Seriously, did you even watch both ep 2 and 3?
No she isn't
which, guess what? Even villains have!
just means you have **human emotions**
Doesn't mean you're "right" or "justified"
And you can be a mass murder and also love your family
All I'm saying is don't treat her as a one-dimensional villain
No one is saying Milaarc is a good person, Armados
I doubt it. If there's going to be only *one* redemption, I feel like Eliza (or w/e her name is) is more likely
but don't treat them as one-dimensional characters only capable of one feeling
then don't
random civ expendable. Family not
random civ =/= family
Milaarc is sexy af, but I don't think I'd ever want to meet her IRL
If they were worried about hte briefcase being stolen, they could've just flown away with it no issues
especially since using the Alca-noise meant alerting the Symphogear users to their position
though I am still a bit confused why vampie and wolfie felt the need to try and kill the biker gang
with the two goons being all "not worth the trouble. Let's go"
then caught and fucked
biker gang just kinda there on their own, possibly planning a way to steal the drugs they thought were being dealt
I finally figured it out later, though
then that line about them being "expendable", and I was all like "wait, wha?"
and they were like, trying to set up a trap or something
At first it seemed like they were with that biker gang
That part confused me a bit
but still
well yeah
....I think I just accidently spoiled episode 11 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
They're probably being used, too
no wonder he's working with the remnants
He's basically like a one-man illuminati
Shit, that kinda makes his character worse.
or is he like, officially a civilian but treated as an official?
Like, is he officially a government official of some kind?
Do we know his official title?
So it's less "government official" and more "knowing the right people"
In fact, it kinda seems like he has more power over them now than he did when he was part of Div 2 himself
~~though he very much deserves that~~
like, he's obviously not some unemployed smuck calling his fam from off the streets
resigned or not, he still has a lot of control over them
including spying on them
So he would absolutely have all the power in the organization he would need to do whatever the fuck he wanted
He's essentially their head authority, IIRC
And genuinely feels disgust that they didn't
you know the worst part of it is, though? The fact that he probably was genuinely expecting S.O.N.G. to prevent the very attack he helped the remnants orchestrate
Fudou being Fudou
G3FA Hexa Revolver
that
yeah
and yeah, fuck Fudou <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
unless she suddenly goes into "survival" mode upon revival, which I doubt since death would let her be closer to Adam
Tiki has literally *no* reason to work for S.O.N.G.
again, they killed Adam
again, why would Tiki agree to this?
They might have use for her remains, but they're not rebuilding her entirely
and then those remains blew the fuck up
yes
and Adam didn't exactly leave a parting message of "Hey TIki, help these guys out plzkthnx"
they killed her beloved Adam
not to mention, why would Tiki join forces with S.O.N.G.
~~and look how well that worked out for her last season~~
and I *highly* doubt they're gonna bother, either
or Fudou
if anyone's rebuilding Tiki, it's the remnants
what reason would Elf9, or even Carol have?
sure, but why?
but I doubt she's coming back
though I guess we don't know for 100% sure yet
I...think she is, actually?
Season one, or season 0?
The power of friendship is in a *lot* of anime
~~it kinda is, even without the dub~~
Pokemon is capturing every animal you come across by throwing a small ball at it
and Yu-Gi-Oh! is literally saving everyone's souls by playing a children's card game
oh absolutely
"SINGLE PUNCH TO THE FACE!!!!!!!"
where you're also calling out all your attacks
especially in anime
lots of people scream while they punch
Punching people while screaming is less "weird" than punching people while singing
either because it's weird, because it's pervy, or because "cartoons are for kids"
Western folks that aren't already anime fans are mostly heavily biased against anime
~~and Ar Tonelico~~
and that's why Symphogear is so awesome
they don't
The gun's cool, too~
that's cool~
huh....3D printers have come a long way since I looked at one last
~~or am I way off on that?~~
3D printers use a form of plastic for their printing, right?
Absolutely
they also need people to buy CDs
Getting people to watch isn't enough
Bring up the idea to your shareholders, and they'll probably laugh you out of the office, then ask your boss to fire you.
From a business perspective, there's no fucking way it'll work
From a fan perspective, it'd be nice to have an amazing English dub
yeah, that too
people won't buy it if the dub fucking sucks
It's a huge fucking risk, and making a mediocre dub only makes it that much harder
and spend money on it?
will Western audiences actually watch it?
Even if you gave it the budget and do everything perfectly
Since who knows if a dub would even sell well
It wouldn't just be expensive, it would also be a huge risk
Funimation had a license to stream S1 awhile back, but never did anything with it
CR struggled to even get the license for streaming
Symphogear doesn't
Madoka also has an official English dub
so more time to garner attention
And Madoka also came first
madoka wasn't released "these days"
the style of storytelling it was going for, it *had* to be slower paced at the start
yeah, Madoka was slow by design
and S1 a couple months before that
Looks like I started watching GX  a few months after it aired
but then again I wasn't around until I think just before GX started airing?
I, surprisingly, have never seen S1 compared to Madoka
Further DM discussion should be taken to that channel. Meanwhile in this one, back to XV
and yeah, to Melua's point, we kinda went off-topic for this channel
I dunno, I feel like Seto Kaiba more-or-less remains the same the entire series
~~except he's still evil~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I don't think so? Unless I missed something
especially with the very first mind crush victim recovering from it no problem
the mind crush thing was used as a throwaway gimmick that didn't mean anything real in DM
and Yami's personality was much more extreme
The thing that gives me "bootleg" vibes is all the different hair colors and whatnot
or that
They'd probably think Season 0 was made by some Chinese bootleg company
Like, if I showed a brand-new anime fan the two different shows, they probably would think they were made by two different people
To the point that Season 0 looks like another company's attempt at a dark rip-off
there's a reason they were willing to change the direction of the entire series
It *absolutely* became so popular because of that parody
IIRC, Season 0 was the original vision for the entire series. Then, again, MTG parody took off and they expanded that parody to become what we know Yu-Gi-Oh! as today.
basically was what Yu-Gi-Oh! was meant to be before he did a Magic: the Gathering parody that took off and made the series change direction
0 was an entirely different thing
yeah, it had darker moments
Oh, the original series as a whole
<:KirikaChant:587018932985004034>
You're trapped, in dess heaven
"Just ignore all the yuri fanart!"
"Don't worry traditionalists, they're totally just really close friends!"
I know the reasoning behind it. I just think it's dumb to write yuri characters, but then act like "they totally might actually be straight!"
It is interesting to see so much anime being afraid to show two lesbians kissing unless it is specifically a yuri show
the only way it'll happen is if them confessing is needed to save the world
It may not be "officially confirmed", but good luck convincing any Symphogear fan Hibiki isn't madly in love with Miku
If they have to kiss for you to know they're in love, you're not a good romance writer
why do we *need* confirmation, though
Unless I overlooked something
Well yeah, but I don't think it ever really went too hard into Yuri territory, even within that same season
And it honestly wouldn't surprise me if they made her straight just to sell her merch to thirsty male weebs who want her to be their girlfriend
That's a possibility as well
Not everyone *has* to be in a relationship *now* in order to be happy
Chris can look for love when she's ready to look for love
And that's ok.
Chris also hasn't shown much interest in love/dating, though. Outside of being embarrassed when the others are doing lewd things around her
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
~~would be interesting to see more Yuri relationship woes outside of Bikki/Miku~~
Well yeah, but that wouldn't straight-up break her the way 70,000 dead fans did.
They had to fuck with Tsubasa somehow <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
~~is that why the American government is always the bad guy?~~
It usually goes together because people (at least in Japan) usually want to buy the merch if they enjoyed the anime
Lots of popular anime go without a 2nd season for that very reason
~~watching other people suffering is a good way to deal with your own~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~I'm surprised they worked~~
for texts and such
I shoudl make it my notification noise
And I've been in this fandom for just over 3 years now
I didn't know about zoid myself until just a month or two ago
Just because someone's the "biggest Symphogear in the world", doesn't mean literally everyone's heard of him
noice
~~he's done shit like that before~~
the episode itself is just over 36 hours away (for CR subs, anyway)
probably
Basa does that one a lot
or even Symphogear
and it doesn't have to be Kanade
I'm not gonna apologize for thinking that's an awesome idea
Ok, now I want to see a dead magical girl transformation
That would.....actually make for an interesting henshin
~~being fucking dead~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
And here I was thinking it was just a matter of getting rid of their "normal" clothes to change into the magical girl clothes
That makes so much sense now
nekkid = purity <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well hey, I learned something new today
ah
but that henshin seemed pretty lewd to me, especially compared to previous henshins
I'm aware nudity =/= lewd
but at least we got some good thighs from it <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
IMO
My only gripe with Kirika's was that it focused too much on her ~~amazing~~ thighs and too little on what makes Kirika, Kirika
^^^
~~inb4 redemtion arc next episode~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
And of course, lots of people would *love* to see more Kanade
I'm not a fan of Serana, personally, but I would like to see her character get developed more
Definitly could be good to have some more focus on other characters
I wanna see a XDU anime where they're fighting together using each other's moves
~~Kanade/Tsubasa duet when?~~
~~next time it's Maria 1 v 3~~
also, like your new DMjii pfp's <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
who knows, I guess
well no, but Germain apparently can
and yeah, I loved the Hibiki fight, but why were the other 5 trapped in the golden shield?
~~I'm gonna laugh if the reaction board is the 4 guys getting taken hostage~~
also, HAHAHAHAH, SUCKAS, INCOMING MILAARC REDEMPTION
I though for sure Fudou would wait at least a few more episodes before making his move on SONG
Well damn, that was fast
uh....where are you getting UN
I can see Genjuuro and Ogawa saving the bridge, but if Lydian's in danger....that's a completely different story
I'm more worried about Lydian than the bridge crew, TBH. I feel like Fudou is smart enough to take more than just the bridge hostage
Well they probably can't do something right away with the bridge crew at gunpoint, but I imagine at some point or another the bad guys are gonna drop their guard around Genjuuro
I don't recall seeing Fudou in that scene
And those guys had assualt rifles
AXZ, episode one
Ogawa's taken out soldiers with guns before
~~where's the ninja?~~
I know I wouldn't
~~inb4 Gen's been a custodian this whole time~~
oh yeah, we're getting an explanation
I'm kind surprised Fudou's making such moves so early in the season. Makes me worried what they have planned for the finale
guess who has that blood? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but I am saying he's behind it all
I'm not sayign he's dropping pretenses
it's Fudou
yeah
so
Fudou has influence in the Japanese government
not even close
at all
like
not the same thing
clever
I wanna do something Symphogear in minecraft as well, but I'm not sure what, exactly, I'd wanna do
CHOO CHOO MOTHER FUCKERS
welcome to the pain train
We've been "madoka" since S1. We just took a hiatus on it for a few seasons
~~another fangirl with her hair done up to match Tsubasa's~~
It's almost definitely another random
It's possible it'll be her, but I wouldn't place any bets on it
If they're gonna kill a gear user, they're gonna kill her in the finale
I honestly doubt that
and it doesn't seem like they're breaking up the team
being on the same base and all
they probably all still bathe together
so of course hibimiku will find time
I mean, you don't really stop taking baths just because bad stuff is happening
especially considering that part of the preview with Tsubasa and blood.
Considering the hostile takeover in Episode 4, I sincerely doubt episode 5 is just gonna be fluffy fun times.
~~he's got 2 more episodes~~
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
also goddamn, that's some amazing photoshop skills on the heads
I like the second pic better
How does Elfnein have more plot armor?
Kinda feels like they were trying to get us to hate the guy as much as possible in one episode so we won't feel bad when Milaarc kills him
I'll be surprised if it's anyone other than smugface, honestly
~~it's some rando that stumbled onto the scene off-screen at the last second~~
and frankly, I don't mind "borrowing" if you at least put some effort into it.
same person = same ideas
And medias borrow from each other all the time. Especially if they have the same people working on the different projects
and it's not like they've repeated it 100 times
I'm pretty sure most people won't even notice unless it's pointed out to them
he doesn't need to be shoehorned into shit
Ver gave us plenty of memes as is, and they have XDU for giving us more
I like the Ver memes, but I don't like them ruining the narrative for the sake of meme man
They shoehorned him in AXZ, they'll do it again in XV
There's an almost 100% chance Ver is hijacking the plot
That would be hilarious, but also a terrible ending
No way he's surviving and getting a redemption arc
Fudou
You know who's *definitely* dead?
Though I'm not sure if mr. politician will actually die unless there's an actual hostile takeover of the entire government or something
Yatsuhiro set off at least a couple death flags this episode
I doubt they'll kill Gen
And with Milaarc trying to capture Elf9, I doubt she'd outright kill Elf9
Though none of this really matters because let's be honest: They BOTH have plot armor
Miku is more helpful to Hibiki than Elfnein is to all of SONG
The team was fine without Elfnein for 2 seasons, and she barely did much in GX
All the foreshadowing with Miku, and you're telling me Miku has *less* plot armor?
Revue Starlight was good
Hard to do a Symphogear copy without singing <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I"m talking about all the songs
I'm not talking about the OP
there's also the fact that you have to write songs....but that's probably not super difficult considering all the idol animes....
and there's probably not a lot of pre-existing manga/LN's that copy Symphogear to adapt from, so an anime copy would have to be an original IP, which studios don't like
VA's that cost money
Oh yeah, and there's also the fact that at least a portion (probably almost all of it) is due to the VA's
I mean, I haven't really seen too many other music-powered mecha magical girl series
~~what's Utazukin?~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
don't live in Japan
no money
I can't
Nana who? <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Only reason I remember Nana and Aoi is because you guys won't shut up about them <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Though I can't really name any, since I rarely pay attention to VAs and have forgotten most the ones I learned about
I have
takes work
expanding your vocal range is very possible, albeit difficult
Men can do female voices too. Just typically takes more vocal workouts
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So....are we gonna get an army of autoscorers next episode? <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I feel like they're important 🤔
All those doll bodies
Soon
oh god, I can actually see her doing that
There have been plenty of other "philosophical" weapons
I thought it's purpose was not to destroy relics, but to "cleanse impurity"?
I still find it weird that SSJ could destroy itself
<@185949743321579520> I wasn't referring to your comment, I was referring to Nikson's
They're not gonna suddenly remove everyone's Miku cards just because something happens to her in XV
she'll remain a gear user in the game
Miku's gear from back in G
Shenshoujing
calling it now
SSJ's coming back
Symphogear is the one universe where magic fucking sucks <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~actual, normal science~~ <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
not unless they hate themselves <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I thought it was already released?
Noise attacks are the official explanation and no one can convince me otherwise <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
SAWBLADES
so "dess" is just an anime thing, got it
does dess actually mean "death", or is just Kirika's weird way of saying it?
and then right back to Micha
like Micha randomly being Mika for no reason
meanwhile, I get to lol at CR subs
I'm waiting to rebinge the series with YT subs after it finishes airing
also, Micha was awesome
couldn't decide if Micha was "MIcha' or "Mika"
Also, lol CR subs
~~SSJ ignite form~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I guess we'll find that out next week
is it like.....linked to her mind or something?
Also, Miku isn't actually inside the God power thing or w/e, but it still has her color scheme
Poor Bikki, tho :<
also, Carol's back
Jesus fucking christ, the autoscorers were WAY cooler in this one episode than they were in all of GX
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
at best
Hibiki with a gun would just be her pistolwhipping
~~unless it shot her fist or something~~ <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
There is no fucking way Hibiki would ever use a gun, though
BUNNYGIRL SAWBLADES
We just don't get to see him at all because of the whole "being fucking dead" thing
Chris's dad was also a good dad
there are multiple lines throughout GX where she talks about killing miracles
She's referring to her entire motivation in GX
With this being the final season, I think they will deal with the moon thing in some way or another
yeah
like some sort of eternal being that just reappears once the right conditions are met
Nephilim to me feels like the type of monster you can't truly kill
Ver is coming back whether we want him or not
Gaijin = foreigner
so you wouldn't necessarily need to destroy the entire moon. Just find the evil curse base and blow that up
or something along those lines
IIRC, it's a facility on the moon rather than the moon itself
so I'd say a Nanoha ending is much more likely
although there's a lot more Nanoha than Madoka
They're very different, sure, but there's still bits and pieces of Madoka
so....inb4 depression <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Symphogear also takes at least some amount of inspiration from Madoka
~~OR WERE THEY?!~~
and they weren't even living dolls or anything
Technically, Tsubasa and Chris were both 100% dead in S1
and hell, they can even just come up with a new life-giving relic
They very well can
again, living dolls. Just shove them into a new body
and there were a LOT of doll bodies
the autoscorers are also living dolls
the flashback with him screaming about the coffin
tentacle spider?
those GX villains were recycled in the best way possilbe
well, besides "dead"
and we don't know anything about Shirabe's or Kirika's dad
or at least summoned it with alchemy
It looked to me like Carol created her relic from alchemy or something
Then they all come back to life because the devil is fucking SCARED
Everyone teams up to kill Fudou, then they all die just so they can go to hell and beat up Fudou again <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
<@!260863818735943680> NOT. FUNNY.
just Gen
no Tsubasa
no
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
@bird NOT FUNNY
make it happen!
Gen v Fudou
ded trio or not
I mean, Fudou's showing up at some point regardless
literally Symphogear
from Symphogear
Anime wouldn't use so much fanservice if people didn't watch so much fanservice
Tell that to the consumers that buy said merch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^
^
I'm just saying it seems unnecessary to me, since loli Carol is her default form
I'm not even denying that they probably did loli Carol just to attract lolicons
Plenty of figures out there have alternative outfits that don't exist in the series at all. And yes, some series do have random alternate outfits shoved inot the anime just to sell said figures
I'm just saying they don't *have* to
Bruh, I'm not saying they never do this in anime
and an upcoming Angel Hibiki I've never seen anywhere else
I mean, we have bunny outfit Chris
but they still could've easily made those "loli carol toys" without having her in the main series
loli Carol is her "standard" form
we didn't get adult Carol until she used her relic
literally 95% of GX was loli Carol
We already had loli Carol
We've yet to see how much/little Carol cares about saving Miku
A lot of what's she's doing now is less "save the world" and more "save Elfnein who's body I'm in"
I would say we don't really know for 100% certian yet
just not as much
<@!400844698140409856> I'm not digging through HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of old messages just to find where you guys discussed it before
but she's definitely getting a gear
Miku is 100% getting a gear. Whether that's SSJ or a new one remains to be seen
....why is Shirabot here? xD
I'm pretty sure the Wikia lists their dances
I'm pretty sure Micha does have a dance
I kinda liked Carol's new henshin....but I still wish she were adult Carol instead of loli Carol
DANCES
and her overall demeaner. (did I spell that right?)
Not only because of her loli body, but her voice kinda sounds younger to me
Though I'd have to say she's most likely underaged
so determining her age is difficult.
I don't think they ever gave a specific date or even year she was created
being created by Carol and all
Elf9 is much, much younger than Carol
And now she has her same personality back no problem
The very end of GX had her not even knowing who she is/was
I imagine Carol has at least some of her memories if she at least remembers the "miracle killer" thing
That's not even a "NOT FUNNY" meme. That's just straight up not fucking funny.
<@!260863818735943680> Dude. Seriously. WTF?
Carol literally just showed up. We have no idea what her thoughts/feelings/motivations/etc are yet
Carol might even actually want to save Miku, if for no other reason than because Elf9 wants to
~~like turning into a godmonster and attacking Elf9~~
unless Miku gives her a reason to be
I don't see Carol being outright hostile
At worst, Carol is indifferent towards Miku
I don't remember the exact words, and I'm going off CR translation for them anyway, so
<@114774843114651653> Maria mentioned something about her ancestors taking that song when their home or base or w/e was destoryed
Hibiki and Miku are 100% fighting each other
and she is 100% going to be at least partially villain
They've foreshadowed Miku too much to **not** do anything with her
"What if I'm the one hurting people?"
They even flashbacked to what she said to Hibiki ep. 1
yes, but they're still VERY different from each other
they are not interchangeable at all
no they're not
no
~~everyone forgets Tiki. poor Tiki <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> ~~
Tiki would never forgive Adam if he forgot Tiki
don't forget Tiki
and Tiki
"YOU THOUGHT IT WAS THE EMPORER, BUT IT WAS ME: CLOUD OF DARKNESS!!!"
I really hope they don't pull a "main villain that only shows up as the final boss at the very end" trope
It'll probably be more like the Yami/Yugi thing
I doubt personalities will fuse
and I would have no idea how that even workds
So it'd be incredibly shocking if later they come out and say "Carol doesn't have any memories from before"
And of course, Carol *just* referred to herself as a Miracle Killer when the last time we saw her she had no clue who she was
Elf9 has some of Carol's memories, and Carol fused with her
but either way, that's beside the point
although I feel like Elf9 could've done her job just as well without having any memories
oh, right. Job efficiency
Carol very blatantly gave Elf9 certain memories, even though she didn't really *need* Elf9 to have memories at all
I woudl be shocked if Carol wasn't sharing memories with Elf9 at all
I'm surprised Tsubasa remained calm this episode
headpat for genocide!
headpat
*spirit bombs headpat energy into Carol*
"Everyone give me your energy!"
I am headpatting the genocide
I am
me
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
WHY IS THERE NO HEADPAT EMOTE?
....I'm not seeing a headpats emote
headpats for Carol
similar =/= interchangeable
it's a pretty rare occurence
at all
that's not how it works
Like, I'm not gonna flip a switch and suddenly fall in love with someone who I've despised for 20 years
goddamnit basaharem xD
right now
in gear
and together
too soon? They're literally in gear right now
Noble Red already did it for him

cue final battle with geahs
Fudou dies of old age, and his soul possesses the godpower
oh god, I can actually see that legit being what causes Basa to fight Fudou
inb4 Basamom shows up to save Tsubasa from her mental distress
not a "younger Tsubasa" personality
she very specifically went into Kanade personality
I doubt it
imagine a character actually walking around with eyes like that
Micha's being micha <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
It woudl be weird if Tiki came back and referred to Carol as "master"
it would've been so amazing to see them **really** face off against Noble Red
I'm kinda sad how quickly the autoscorers died off, especially with how epic their comeback was
just stab her and be done
her purpose, IIRC, was to kill elf9, so I'm not sure why she was digging into Elf9's mind to begin with
Elfnein: Uh....we need to send the signal out somehow to-
Micha: I got this
that's even more hilarious
"stabby stab!"
and if no one lets her, she'll just photobomb them with her own pose <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
like, she's got her own, but if she went to an anime convention she would totally find a Jojo cosplay group and do Jojo poses with them
and she's the type to do the Jojo poses as well
She is 100% the autoscorer that makes all the jojo references
DEACTIVATION POSE
video call too boring
didn't want to join the video call
She just straight up posed out of boredom
literally no one even looking at her
Micha doing her deactivation pose for no goddamned reason was such a Micha thing to do <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Garie still best autoscorer <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
anyway, back to XV discussion in this <#431914167826382860> channel!
with how off-topic everyone went, I can see how you thought that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
XV channel, yo
.....we've kinda gotten off topic here <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Although ironically, the conspiracy videos are technically more relevant. I do watch a lot of Game/Film Theory
*slighty*
slightly better than all the conspiracy videos youtube used to recommend to everyone
I have 0 interest in them, and have never engaged with them in any form, so I dunno why the algorithm thinks I *really* want to see them
I don't know about any mechanical voices in said videos. I literally never click them. Ever
"Teachers, what's the most fucked up excuse a student came up with for missing homework?!"
Lately I've been getting a lot of videos about reddit posts
I might want to turn them off. *sometime* I get a good video, but usually it's just BS that's unrelated to the video I'm watching, or videos I've already watched and don't really feel like watching again
YOU CAN TURN OFF SUGGESTIONS?!?!?!
I've just been ignoring them
didn't know you could block channels
huh
that return was way too epic for them to just die so quickly
they fucking better
Can I buy one to just pose in my room? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
First time she used her relic
To give Bikki her gungnir in a manner that gives the story good drama?
they're fully aware of Symphogear's marketability by this point
also, that was literally turn 1, before they even had any idea the franchise would be marketable at all whatsoever
and every "death" since then has been a fakeout
I don't think they'll actually kill anyone merchandisable, though
then more <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
then RIOT!!!
then <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
in fact, everyone will probably assume it's a fakeout if they legit kill her on-screen until the series ends without her coming back
so it wouldn't really be that surprising if they did it again <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they've already done a fakeout
I mean
which isn't something they necessarily need to kill for (see godmonsterbikki)
If they legit kill Miku at any point, it'll probably only be to bring her back as a godmonster
Garie best autoscorer <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
so again
anyway, we're kinda going off topic again
and sometimes, companies make terrible business choices that drives customers to their competition
so? Even a business that has been strong since 1929 can be fuckign dead by this time next year. Markets change
plus livestreaming removes a lot of possibilities. Filming a music video across multiple locations that aren't immediately next door to each other, for instance
My problem with the current options is that they're focused almost exclusively on livestreaming, which I'm not currently comfortable doing
then again, there will probably be another good platform to replace it by then, too
I'd love to be a youtube idol myself, but by the time I get good enough to have any chance at gaining an audience, youtube will be fucking dead <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
also, I want these new "imperfect" autoscorers!
She fucking better! <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
particularly the version from Yakuza Kiwami
I actually wanna hear Genjuuro and Hibiki sing Iji Sakura
I've got XV art, but no XV fluff
better fluff?
Fluff :3

There you go
hang on, I"ll find you fluff
Even if the series left it with Hibiki being just dead, people would assume there's gonna be some future spin-off series or something that brings Hibiki back
Everyone would remember the S1 ending, and be all like "lol, obvious fakeout"
and probably not worth it, since it wouldn't have *near* the same impact
It would be incredibly difficult to work it in a way that makes sense
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
In heaven
They will be happy!
we only got to see it for like, a few seconds <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
that was an awesome dress
I hope we get to see more of that dress
That Miku dress tho
"might as well!"
wasn't he basically trying to stop/destroy Shem-Ha himself?
makes sense
We'll probably find out more next week
also, holy shit fanartists, slow the fuck down xD
It looks kind of similar to SSJ, but also different
So.....is Shem-ha the name of the new relic, or she still using SSJ?
what does feeling bad about killing have to do with trusting Fudou again after this?
It'd be a pretty hard sell for Fudou to continue to try to use them and them just continuing to go along with it
Fudou has officially abandoned them, and they're fully aware
I doubt they're gonna go crawling back to him
they're pretty fucking aware of Fudou fucking with them now
"unexpectedly"? It's pretty expected after today's episode, TBH
Don't think Noble Red would randomly get geahs, either
and no signs whatsoever of it outside of *possibly* MIku, but that likely won't last
we have....5 episodes left?
yeah, not really enough time to properly add in evil geah users now
though I doubt we'll get it again
technically, we actually did have that for most of G
~~evil geah users!~~
~~inb4 Miku loses her gear again~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and thirdly, just because it's a bad idea doesn't mean Kaneko won't do it
Well first of all, this *is* the final season, so it's plenty possible for someone to get killed this way (we all keep speculating about who's gonna die like as though it's 100% guaranteed someone's gonna die....another thing the fanbase is strangely deadset on)

Secondly, they've added new powers to the gears before, and it would make plenty of sense for SSJ to get new powers from the bracelet.
not anymore <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
why can't she just....reverse engineer the technology?
And wait, why can Elfnein repair and even upgrade gears, but can't make them?
godpower seemed to have no issues
and again, other mirror pieces
no *person* can make a gear, but what about godpower?
that implies other pieces
they're *fragments*
I mean
not really
Like, we have the mirror fragments surrounding the bracelet, the waveform showing up, but people are still all like "NOPE, NOT GONNA HAPPEN LITERALLY 100% IMPOSSIBLE NO POSSIBLE WAY NOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPE"
Is there some sort of SSJ hate in the fanbase I'm unaware of?
I don't know why everyone's so deadset on "SSJ can't possibly return ever"
kinda sorta?
Option E) Fuck you <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
unless she was awakened by Fudou or something
and Carol wouldn't be awakened
If Noble Red joined up with SONG, they wouldn't have tried to kill Elf9
Carol only awakened because Noble Red tried to kill Elf9
the fact that they *ever* thought Fudou would keep his end of the bargain after getting the power of a God
Noble Red is pretty stupid, TBH
Hibiki doesn't always get what she wants <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
there's still the other gear users, there's still the rest of S.O.N.G., and Noble Red themselves may reject it
again, though, it doesn't necessarily mean they'll be redeemed
especially when she already tried
I don't see why Noble Red would be an exception
point is, Bikki befriends everyone, regardless of sins
they came back afterwards...but she still killed them
oh, and there's also all the people Carol killed
but more
well, maybe not WAY more
and Hibiki still befriended her
Germain killed WAY more people
esp. basa
nor does that mean the other gear users will blindly go along with it
though, that doesn't necessarily mean they'll accept said friendship
And to be fair.....Hibiki's still gonna try to befriend them
whatever the fuck they can
you don't have to repent to decide not to follow the bad guy's orders anymore
I think dino's just talking about his fanfic ideas again <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
uh......science?
the geahs aren't gonna just sit there and let Miku destroy the moon
we need the fucking moon
Humanity would die out without the moon
and IIRC, it's not the **moon** that's the source of the curse, but a **facility** on the moon
yes they would
the moon is pretty fucking important to the Earth
why would the gears *let* her destroy the moon?
Why would Miku destroy the moon?
when did we have that conversation?
wait what?
The way they pointed it out at the end of the episode back in AXZ, it seemed like they were gonna make it an important plot point later on
oh yeah, and they still havne't brought up that shrine again
Speaking of Enki, we still haven't learned shit about him since that brief Ep 1 appearnce
I'm curious what, exactly, would *force* Enki to activate the curse
communicating with song is a main point for much of Symphogear
I mean
Apple definitely has something to do with something
F) Everyone dies, including Fudou
Franxx
but then again
it could
I'm pretty sure we would've heard about "alien" gods by now if there were, indeed, alien gods
especially this late in the series
and I mean, Symphogear *might* do that, but I doubt it
so....keep Kaneko's influences in mind over your own
ok, but Kaneko's the writer, not you. And Kaneko seems to mostly be influenced by Mecha
I don't recall anytime in the series where they referred to "other gods" that weren't custodians
^
I thought the custodians were the gods?
probably another Enki flashback at some point
I'm pretty sure we still have some flashbacks incoming
and also keep in mind how little we actually know about Shem-ha and Enki
I'm just saying don't get set on any explanation just yet
I mean, speculation is fine.
and any conclusion you might come up with could be **completely** shattered literally next week
because a *lot* of thing are in the air right now
well, wait for XV to end before you do that
For all we know, his plan didn't work out at all
Technically, we don't even know if the curse actually did what he was expecting it to
or maybe it was just a final "fuck you" to who/whatever killed him
he very well could've had some plan going on
and we don't actually know his motive behind it at all
I mean, he could've been forced to (which, IIRC, you're the one who originally brought up that possibility)
we don't really know anything about Enki either, outside of those couple minutes at the very start
and I guess the bracelet is also called Shem-Ha
other than the fact Miku calls herself Shem-ha after being possessed by the god power
Because we really don't know fucking anything about Shem-Ha atm
true, and vocal ranges are a thing
If they're the same entity, it's very likely Shem-ha doesn't actually have its own voice
Do we actually even know if Shem-ha is a separate entity from the bracelet of the same name?
hmm....
Then again, Carol manages to have her own, separate voice from Elfnein.
Probably also because Shem-ha is using Miku's body, and thus Miku's vocal cords.
hopefully never. We don't need more anti-America BS <_<
She could, and I think Kaneko is more likely to go that route than have the other geahs kill her
She's hiding her feelings because that's what she thinks a sword is supposed to do
Tsubasa's faking
Tsubasa's betrayal is gonna be really interesting if it quite literally *is* a custodian bloodline.
~~you mean the custodian bloodline?~~ <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
~~I need to brush up on my science~~
but you get my point
well, I think it woudl actulaly take more than one atom to make water
a single atom of water is still a separate entity from the large group of atoms that make up the cup
just because you don't wanna admit that tiny piece is Carol, doesn't mean that tiny piece isn't actually Carol
A tiny fragment of a separate entity is still a separate entitiy
Even without mindjumping, Carol was a separate entity. An entity you couldn't access, but a separate entity nonetheless.
I'm arguing that Carol existed regardless of it, even if not in the same form
I'm not arguing who started it
asleep, but there
sure, but Carol was still there in some form or another
Elfnein wasn't the one doing the copy/paste stuff. Elfnein, as far as I could tell, wasn't even aware of it happening
well ok, but there was still a "Carol" to do all that to begin with
Carol blatantly states this
2. Elfnein tried. She couldn't because forcibly removing Miku without reversing the ritual properly could kill Miku
1. Carol didn't technically reconstruct herself. She just "woke up". She was there the whole time
I'm still amazed you can apparently reflect literally any type of laser or beam with any standard mirror <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
well yeah, but apparently the ritual can be reversed
but I'm pretty sure Miku would survive
I mean, it probably won't be easy to just simply remove it
~~or they just remove the damn bracelet~~
can someone explain to me the "15min" nickname? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
uh
poor Bikki <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I need my Milaarc pose <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
why DROWNING?
but....
....why do we have a "elfneinDROWNING" emote?
unless your powers are tied to faith, you can still be a god without followers
A god without followers
like, *her* specifically?
D:
THEN WHY DO YOU WANT HER DEAD?
.....why do you hate Shirabe? <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I don't think they've confirmed any movie
wait, did Kaneko say somewhere it's gonna be a happy ending?
I'm hoping for a happy ending, but I think we're gonna get a bittersweet ending <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
If it were that easy, it probably would've happened already
and we all know (much to our horrors) that <:Ver:336656981144109066> is coming back
everyone's come back save for her and <:Ver:336656981144109066>
although I wouldn't be surprised if Fine came back *somehow*
sure, but there's been no indication that's what happened
and Fine's not a software program
Shirabe's not a computer....
Fine has a corpse?
~~both~~
we have concepts? :O
but then again, I don't read every interview
I honestly think Shem-ha's most likely a sentient relic
assuming, of course, Shem-ha had a body
but it could be Shem-ha's original body
I don't think we have anything on the mummy at all
as far as how he's relevant.....who fucking knows? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
according to the credits
Enki
"No, this is Patrick"
what if that dream Hibiki had of Miku leaving her was Shem-ha trying to summon Hibiki?
I just had a scary theory
so
I can't wait until I can read Japanese and don't need to wait for translations <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
jamming the curse? what?
If he did create it, it likely wasn't him by himself
We only know he ACTIVATED the curse
we don't know Enki created the curse
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
gods
because
I'm pretty sure it was "the dark continent" long before brexit
it just made things fucking difficult for us
technically, the curse didn't "doom" humanity
or has Shem-Ha's power or something
so it's at least a bracelet that belongs to Shem-Ha
hmm
We do know for sure the bracelet itself is called "Shem-Ha", right?
Shem-Ha might have some evil plan to initiate on the moon
well, maybe not "retreat" per se
it does seem like they're gonna end up on the moon one way or the other
actually, Shem-Ha retreating to the moon is fairly likely
that's....pretty fucking hostile, tbh
Shem-Ha literally transformed into gear the moment Hibiki entered
uh.....
I'm sure there will be at least some conversation between Shem-Ha and Hibiki
although it's certainly a good possibility
we don't technically know the mummy is Shem-Ha
Shem-Ha may not even have a body
of course not
I doubt the blood has anything to do with the Symphogear system
considering that this type of blood exists IRL, I doubt it's gonna be "primitive Linker" or "something Ver invented"
"hey, these alca-noise seem weaker than the ones we've fought before"
I'm sure they would've brougth that up if that were the case
yeah, there are a LOT of Alce-noise still left in the world for having supposedly lost the recipe
Wasn't it the activation of that one relic that caused the noise to attack?
~~other than not fucking killing them~~
I can't think of a better way they could've done that
the best callback so far was the autoscorers
is the kadingir that cannon thing Fine was trying to shoot the moon with?
He uh....didn't really research Persona very well *at all*
like his Persona 4 video
I mean, I *really* enjoy MatPat's videos (one of my favorite channels, TBH), but you can tell there are videos where he doesn't put as much thought into it as he should.
which he probably wouldn't for a series like Symphogear :|
Assuming, of course, he does proper research on it
He'd probably do one of those analysis episodes where he talks about the concert tickets and the VA's and whatnot.
how it managed to get popular enough to get 5 seasons <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
like
I wasn't being serious
there's a reason I used ~~strikethrough~~ text when I first mentioned it
Literally all I'm saying with it is "that'd be hilarious"
and I'm not even arguing the "Fudou punch" thing as being a very likely scenario to begin with
it's literally *just* starting
uh....the fight isn't pretty much over
especially since that'd be the point where he'd likely do it at all anyway
why can't he show up to punch Shem-Ha in the face late into the fight?
why would he *need* to insta teleport at all?
again though, highly unlikely
and hey man, he has the resources to get a chopper or w/e he needs to arrive on scene
It's extremely unlikely, but I'd laugh so hard
~~punch Shem-Ha in the face and demand the power manifest correctly~~
I'm sure he'll play a more active role later on regardless
whatever. it just seems a bit weird to me
Well yeah, but before he was actively orchestrating things. Now he's still putting things in place, but much more passively.
and he also showed up at the Chatteu, but didn't do much there apart from "Here's a new base, here's some blood, go do stuff"
showing off his power a bit to Milaarc
and showing up at the Noble Red base when they first got the bracelet
I'm surprised Fudou is suddenly doing less. He did a fair bit in the first half, but now he's just sitting back and watching shit go down
the relics Fine had were most likely relics created by her people
That isn't even something that would happnen in a gag comic. That's just straight-up fanfiction <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~and then punches Trump~~
sounds more like something that would happen in one of those gag comics or something
I'll laugh if it does, indeed, happen, but I'll believe it when I see it and not a second sooner
at all
what about Symphogear is "realistic" at all?
like
this isn't real life
What reason would Shem Ha have for doing so?
Why would Shem Ha resurrect them?
but
true
but I don't see Elsa or Milaarc surviving
well ok, Vanessa *might* be alive
how are they supposed to survive being cut in half?
like
they're fucking dead
uh
~~that was a really stupid way to kill off Noble Red~~
I mean, we don't technically really know what Shem Ha can do besides shoot beams and use a beam sword thingie
and again, is Shem Ha even using Miku's mind at all? Body obviously yes, but I"ve yet to see Miku's mind in this at all
if they're gonna go with omnianything, it would definitely be with Shem Ha, unless there's another "god" in the last episode or something
when?
Shem Ha was in AXZ?
but is Shem Ha using Miku's memories at all?
Probably
this is all assuming Shem Ha *can* resurrect to begin with
and why would Shem Ha care to resurrect her
Why would Shem Ha be aware of Kanade's existence?
what reason would they have to know Kanade exists?
so
which Shem Ha is
which would be all the more reason *not* to resurrect Kanade if you're a God
and it'll likely be how they ultimately defeat Shem Ha
Miku will almost definitely be coming back
Miku's getting really fucked over by current events
poor Miku. Even the fans are reducing her to being an object <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Which, frankly, I kinda doubt she does
and this is, again, even assuming Shem Ha has that power
and if she needs just mindless puppets...why would she target specific people to resurrect?
except as mindless puppets
I fail to see why she would res anyone
Just because Noble Red wasn't expecting them, doesn't mean Shem Ha wasn't
She had to fight the gears to destroy the rocket, though
and again, she could've easily destroyed the rocket right after it exited the Earth's atmosphere (and thus while it's out of range of being protected by the gears
I doubt a rando would survive against those energy blasts she was launching at Maria
well sure she's not "all powerful" yet, but Maria wasn't some random human with no protection whatsoever
blow up the rocket before it even lands
I mean, she could've killed them before they got *any* observations at all
but for some reason she needed to avoid them showing up at all at all costs?
Like....she could've just easily slaughtered them no problem the moment they showed up
why was Shem-Ha so severely concerned about random human researchers showing up at the lunar ruins?
So...one thing I'm *very* confused about this episode
I mean, she could be lying, but I don't think she was
and Shem Ha already said they can't return to being human
alchemy is part of what fucked them up to begin with, wasn't it?
I don't think alchemy can fix them
guess we'll find out later
I honestly can't tell how sincere Shem Ha is being
It does also seem a bit like she does legit care
but *shrugs*
so them potentionally dying after carrying out her will probably isn't an issue to her
I doubt Shem Ha cares as much about Noble Red as she claims
and Shem Ha seems to want to get rid of said curse
the moon base producing the curse is on the moon
probably destroy the base or w/e
to do whatever dirty work she needs done up there
^
I think Shem Ha herself is probably there
Shem Ha can't be particularly happy about that
all that effort to keep rando researchers away from the moon, and now the geahs are there
I wonder how Shem Ha's gonna react to Noble Red fucking up and bringing the geah's to the moon <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ohey, new Kiri command discovered
calm down
like, seriously
All I did was ask a question
no need to take this so personally
I'm just putting out possibilities
lolwut?
Back in S1, IIRC
<@125322423355703296> they've fought in space before just fine
"Never forget about kindness"
especially with those last words from Shirabe and Kirika
It does seem like the series is pushing towards a redemption arc
and people will probably be even more afraid of them afterwards
illusion shattered
and boom
but like....all someone has to do is take their hat off or w/e
not easily
they still have their monster parts
not really
"MAKE EVERYONE ELSE MONSTERS TOO!!!"
Technically they still have hope. Just a very different hope
and again, I'm pretty sure it was alchemy that fucked them up to begin with
if she is "lying", it's only because she's unaware of how it could be possible
exactly
or even just in Mahou Shoujo
not just in Symphogear
90% of the time a villain is redeemed, their sins are more or less just magically forgotten
Anime very rarely handles redemption arcs for villains very well
ultimately, the person still has to make a choice to try and be redeemed
having fundemental good in everyone doesn't necessarily mean everyone gets redeemed
Most people get upset when someone else does a bad thing and then shows no remorse
most, I'd argue
a lot of people
uh
~~I mean, we haven't seen much room for redemption for Fudou"~~
being angry doesn't automatically give a villain a redemption arc when they fail to carry out their revenge
a pretty damn good portion of villains become villains at least partially out of anger
that's pretty fucking standard for evil
like
lots of evil people are angry
not being pure evil =/= "redemption"
<@125322423355703296> It's Symphogear. They'll pull something out their ass.
"I'mma just sit here and let this person kill me"
I mean, at no point in the series have they randomly decided "lol, let's just sit here and do nothing while the villains win"
They would likely go into special mode if needed
the whole point is basically just "Ya'all are fucked the moment I go 100% on your asses"
yeah, I don't think the *exact* number really matters
Elsa? Not Vanessa?
I think she would've been fine with 10k so long as Tsubasa was affected
Milaarc was out to affect Tsubasa. I don't think numbers mattered that much as long as Tsubasa was traumatized from it
not Milaarc herself
since the Alca Noise did most the killing
and on that technicality, that still makes SG a bigger murderer than Milaarc
People only call Milaarc a bigger mass murderer because she killed those people all in one go
he couldn't legally do anything to stop the inspection
and we don't know where they got the data, either
I'm pretty sure what they stole wasn't *just* data
and it could only be set up right in the chatteu, I guess?
They probably legit believed they held no real power because the relic needed to be set up right to have any real power
~~inb4 Maria's possessed by Enki~~
Gods tend to have pretty high self-awareness
not just because of her being the concept of understanding, but her being a God
It would be more confusing if she *didn't* have self-awareness
but as a God in Symphogear? Absolutely
which is what confused me
it just kinda sounded for a moment like you were talking about the concept IRL too, though
true
I'm really not sure how *any* concept would inherently have selfawereness
I....don't think it would, actually
with those being CR subs, though, I also question the accuracy of what she's actually saying there
though if she's being literal, that brings up a lot of other questions like "how are *words* taking over Miku"?
her literally being words would explain why she might not like the curse so much
especially if she means it literally
and yeah, that's *got* to be a fucking important line
full-power Shem-Ha is probably a Shem Ha that can snap half the universe out of existence without needing any infinity stones or any gauntlet to help her
yes, but did that data contain info on how to make more Symphogears?
and stealing nonSymphogear fragments isn't hte same as stealing Symphogear fragments
considering the only person who knew how is **fucking dead**
it's unlikely
but I don't think they stole the very specific fragment that Miku used
if they had stolen the specific fragment that Miku used, and they knew about that, they would've probably made a point to keep Miku more heavily guarded
anyone can use a completed relic, too, IIRC
best case scenario
doing anything about it would've basciallly kicked SONG out of Japan
or at least not for any longer than for like, 2 seconds
....so basically she literally never has any souls ever
Fine/Kirika duet
Fine-possessed Amalgam scythe!
but for now, she's dead
I mean, I wouldn't past Kaneko to bring her back again anyway
from everyone
suposed to be, yes
it's something they'd have to rediscover themselves
I mean, maybe someone will figure it out someday, but the info on how to make them isn't available
why have we seen no new gears, or hints of new gears?
ok, so if they supposedly have publicly available info on how to make more Symphogears
uh
by acting like I'm taking it SUPER SERIOUSLY when I'm actually not <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Harem responds to humor the same way I do <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I still haven't read the actual Gilgamesh epic
I just don't bother translating it and just stick to "Zesshou" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
though it's hard to change something that's so deeply ingrained into your personality
yes, I've learned that
can't wait to see the fanart <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
almost definitely
uh.....
otherwise it probably wouldn't work at all
she just kinda knocked it out of their hands
I don't think Tsubasa chopped it, though?
Shirabe's new attacks were amazing this episode <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
it'd be weird if Shem Ha programmed that...vial thingamajig to scatter them across the moon base
the entire group was teleported
well yeah
or are they not separated and we just didn't see the others because the room is so big? 🤔
NR included?
Why *was* Hibiki and Chris in an entirely seperate room from the others?
that's something I'm hoping for an explanation on
something we kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinda already knew from the whole "their signals disappeared from the planet!" thing
the drama was "WE'RE OUT IN FUCKING SPACE NOW!!" drama
As it turns out, though, Chris was simply staring out the window and going "WTF?!?!?!?"
like, Chris being mind controlled or something
the way Chris's back was turned to her, it kinda felt like they were gonna do another Chris betrayal.
I was honestly scared for a bit after Hibiki woke up and saw Chris
MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE MOON
but that's going into <#336297840529899522> territory, so I'll stop there
well, discriminatory in general
Humans in general are sexist
not by a long shot
it's....not just Japan
I love magical girl shows, but they are really hard to watch sometimes for that very reason
I hate shows that tell me I'm pure evil simply because I was born with the "wrong" genitals <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
and frankly, I hate that
and I think Ver, but I'm not 100% sure on that
IIRC, Hibiki did try to talk to Adam at least once
except they still would
like, I don't think Shem Ha brought it up just to have a cool base to live in
or dangerous
there's no way it isn't somehow important
and if it doesn't get destroyed while they're on the moon, they likely will need to come back down to fight it
Well, there is that Yggdrasil tower on Earth now.
In fact, the only way I would really find that believable is if they didn't go to the moon due to Shem Ha destroying the moon before they had a chance.
I honestly would've been shocked if they *didn't* go to the moon at all
If you think about good places for a final FINAL boss fight in the Symphogear universe, the moon is an obvious top 3 choice, if not outright #1
The moon is the source of the curse, after all, and the curse has at least been mentioned in every season
Like, the moon was pretty fucking important in S1, and it remained pretty fucking important in every season since
I mean, it was pretty obvious to me that they would end up on the moon at some point or another clear back in S1
~~inb4 that's how they fight off Shem Ha's alca-noise in the final episode~~
though it was pretty....interesting how the autoscorer quartet kept getting killed, and coming back over and over
the guys they were fighting in my dream weren't even Symphogear villains, lmao
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and failed
My dream *tried* to spoil the latest episode
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Symphogear
because
imagine gods suing people <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
who, exactly, do they think owns this copyright?
~~inb4 Yggdrasil waits to do its thing until the movie~~ <:Ver:336656981144109066>
and this *is* meant to be the final season, so I don't think it's gonna be a plot thread that's put in place for a future arc
No way Shem Ha sprouted a giant fucking tower out of nowhere just for the lulz
Yggdrasil for sure is gonna have *some* importance in future episodes
but who outside the studio really knows at this point?
I think it's more likely Yggdrasil will just act as another monster like Nephilim than for Nephilim itself to come back
because if she's hating on it, it's probably because she literally has done better
Hibiki's the ONE person who could hate on Symphogear and I'd accept her for it

HIbiki *is* Symphogear <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
just blowup literally fucking everything <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
then we can kill off the curse *and* humanity <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
shoot the moon
the more you talk about your fanfic, the more it sounds like one of those cringey self-insert power fantasy fanfics that give fanfics such a bad stigma
but like
I'm trying not to be mean
I'm not convinced your OP self-insert is gonna be interesting
the thing is
Never heard of this "Vandal Savage", so can't comment
minus the worship
so you claim, but the way you describe him....gonna level with you, he sounds like a God
you're gonna find them again
you're a god
but like
I mean, I guess they could escape?
it's not like they're gonna kill you while you're not moving, being that you can't die
I mean, if you're immortal does it necessarily matter if you exhaust yourself mid-battle?
~~inb4 fanart Shem Ha~~
~~inb4 AU Shem Ha~~
which, if handled well, could actually work
~~inb4 Enki arm~~
so I'm not quite ready to get into a full discussion on the games right now anyway
and plus, I haven't beat the game yet and don't want to be spoiled
I'm just saying in relation to dino's fanfic and interesting villain ideas
right right
I mean, I liked the Joker better in Arkham City
so far, I'm really liking them
the villains in Arkham Knight
but man
I'm not really a superhero fan at all
I haven't even watched Endgame yet (and probably actually never will)
I can't really comment much on Thanos myself, because I've only ever seen the version of him in Infinity War
^
if they're not the same, then the same characters may not necessarily work the same way
also keep in mind the kind of world Thanos exists in, and the kind of world your character will exist in
and why he works so well in the MCU
I would highly suggest you fully anaylze Thanos, then
even some that are fairly OP
there are plenty of big threat villains that are actually interesting
not even a gag character, but just a gag?
are you writing Zino to be a gag?
Saitama isn't actually an interesting character *at all*. He works as a gag when handled well, but otherwise he's incredibly boring
and uh....I don't think that's gonna work
you're basically creating Saitama, but in a serious story
especially with the big reveal
yeah, "puppetmaster" villains can be quite difficult to pull off
and of course, a lot of this is my own opinion anyway
rather than a complete stranger that you don't know well enough to know if they mean well, or if they legit just fucking hate you
and a friend is the best person to hear that from
a big reason I want you to mainly get advice from friends is because a lot of what you probably need to hear are things that are....less than nice, but necessary
for both my own sake, and yours
I just....want you're writing to be good xP
and I don't want to discourage you from writing
Again, I don't mean to be an asshole to you
analyze what they do and why they're good fanfics
GOOD fanfics
and also, read other people's fanfics
and start off only asking for suggestions from friends who know the best way to word it without being too mean, but still getting the point across?
maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe just write it for yourself and don't release it?
but like
and I get you have to start *somewhere*
sounds like it's doing wonderful things to him to me <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
anyway back to XV stuff
yay laziness! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I was originally going to write my fanfic as a "alternate season 5", but I've waited so long to even start that I might as well wait for the season to finish and see if I still want to do an alternate version of it, or do a sequel like I was originally planning
before the spoiler policy goes away for XV <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
though you'll have to wait a month after the final episode
it would be annoying to have to spoiler tag a large chunck of the convo, but I don't think we should be overtaking this channel with it, either
good point
oh
this should probably be moved to <#357682999300718592>, yes
Mel's response was fucking **perfect** <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I'mma say it
ok
*cough* <#336297387863703552> *cough*
Shem Ha dies and Miku lives the rest of her life in Shem Ha's body <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
"Trust me, it's a thing she can totes do!"
Though I'm curious how she managed to *literally* turn herself into a language, of all things
~~I doubt it, tbh~~
she wants power and authority for the sake of power and authority
Or perhaps those two reasons are the entire explanation
I thought I was watching the wrong anime at first <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
XV is the season where they found the setting to turn the cards off for random encounters <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
no she's not
wat?
and there very clearly *is* something of Miku left
that looks like S1 Miku
||as gay as they can get away with||
it's just the show trying to mislead us
and of course they don't spend time charging up. We don't have the budget for a full season of just yelling <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
only an hour?
a HAT!!!!
hey man, Adam also threw a hat
I doubt she was literal, and there's no way they're ending the series with "lol, the bad guy destroys the world"
The only way we're gonna see time travel is if A. Shem-Ha was literal with "5k years ago" and B. Shem-Ha wins
crunchy spoils all the time
Red Nephilims entire fighting style was to assert dominance!
my guess is we'll see hers next episode, then everyone's together for the finale
Chirs is taking too damn long to Amalgam
THOUSANDS of years ago? we're going that far into the future for our epilogue?
again....how?
'cause like....they're gonna need food, among other things
unless you're talking about them being sealed away or something?
how uh....how would they even survive on the moon forever?
~~inb4 fine breaks Miku out~~
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Fine would be Shirabe's stand tho
I can't wait until NR gets redeemed, and everyone gets pissed <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Bikkibooty is indeed best booty
HPYE?
<#336297840529899522> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Global warming says "hi"
"can't change nature"
I played it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
watched?
uh
...by having Hibiki casually move her sword beneath her while falling?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
also
finally managed to watch the latest episode
~~we got something kind of similar with NR~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~I missed the "in Gotham" part~~
though I misread your original message to begin with, apparently, so <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hence the <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
and you talked like what happened in the show was the same thing
I mentioned what happened in the game
yeah but
where's the sword casually being moved underneath him, tho? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
but I found myself really loving the gameplay in the Arkham games
I'm not into batman like....at all
because I've never seen the show
well I guess they borrowed elements from the game
the fanbase is finally starting to grow
lots of people are late to the party
I want to time travel to next week <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~probably~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
always wants to climb random things
that's a cat for ya
HOW DID IT GET SO BIG?!?!
speaking of flies, I have a fly in my apartment that's like....3 or 4 times the size of a normal fly
perfect for someone that has to travel <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they live for like, 24 hours
get a pet fly
~~'cause I feel like I'm being ignored here~~ <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
are we?
He doesn't even care if I pet him while he's trying to eat <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
literally whenever I need
My cat comes to me for pets and lurves whenever I need someone to cuddle
cats are awesome
I'll probably look for more Symphogear servers to join once XV ends <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
told me servers exist, but no one was kind enough to give any links <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
I tried asking in a Symphogear group on facebook, but they were **very** unhelpful
I was looking for at least a month for a Symphogear discord to join
it took me a long time to find the server
Dx
during the final season
uh
~~inb4 epilogue movie~~ <:GarieWink:336657101273169921> '
EGO?
now why would you think that? <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
the curse of Balal is the closet they can come to killing her off
they couldn't technically kill her, so they would've had to seal her away instead
I'm pretty sure that's actually what happened
in the end, Shem-Ha has to travel to wherever the Custodians fucked off to, and buy another Yggdrasil OS off the black market <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
You go through all that trouble to boot up Yggdrasil, only to have to wait another century for it to finish updating the firmware <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Imagine having thousands of years worth of updates to install before you can take over the world <:Ver:336656981144109066>
inb4 that's how they beat Yggdrasil <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
and are the ones (spurred by the Japanese) calling for the world to come together to fight Yggdrasil
it's nice that the Americans **aren't** the villains, for once
first roll was a 3 <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I tried getting consecutive 6s the other day
Voy, I happen to know for a fact you can't keep your composure <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
something gay is almost certainly happening <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
in fact, if anything that just makes said duet all the more unlikely to happen
the world doesn't have to be destoryed to get your HIbiMiku duet, dude
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
"fucking Chris" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
nein dess theory?
uhhhhhh
UHHHH
~~okbutytho?~~
he's gotta take them ALL on <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
nah man
like we got in AXZ
I wanna see more Gen training
who, FYI, has Shenshoujing
purifying Earth woudl require purifying Shem Ha
Shem Ha is Earth in your fantasy ending
how?
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Hibiki for sure would be benchpressing
~~and then the next villain appears and successfully takes over the world because there's no one who can stop them~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
Is that something the gears would even be willing to do?
and you think the best way for the series to end is with the Gear users destorying the very planet they're fighting to protect, after making such a huge deal out of "our home!!!" these past 2 episodes? <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
<@506219877724454929> so....you them to blow up the Earth to get rid of Shem-Ha? <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
ah
what's SoL? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but some things are better off in fanfic
which, it's ok to think "hey, I think ___ would be awesome"
in all seriousness though, you seem to have a *really* bad habit of projecting your obsessions onto the show
yes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^
^^
^
which would make TopDad a demigod
Hibiki being demigod would open up the possibliity of it coming from her genes
keep in mind
I would totally speedwatch anime at 2x speed if I could still understand what's going on
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so
you didn't say gear
I mean
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and Maria
and I don't think Kanade necessarily had "god-killing" properties
even knowing how to use it
having a different weapon doesn't make you stronger
speaking of Fudou, what's he thinking about all this now that he's watchign from jail? <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
how would Ep 1 of XV turned out if Elf9 was never around?
well Ignite is far from Elf9's only contribution
she was, in fact, the one who gave them the ignite model, and that's been pretty important ever since
if we're being serious about it here, the gears would've lost quite a few key battles without Elf9 being around
~~inb4 she burned her memories on which coffee flavors she likes and has to experiment all over again~~ <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
At absolute least, she recognized the Gears as they were reentering the atmosphere
~~she also very clearly still had memories left over afterwards~~
those are probably the memories to burn <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean, if you can pick and choose which memories to burn
if it's a general narrative trope across all media?
well sure Mel, but how does that make it "DC logic"?
not any American comic book logic
Symphogear is its own logic
uh....what does DC logic have to do with Symphogear?
they act purely on orders and not on any semblance of personal thought
I'm pretty sure that was more or less confirmed?
even though they're not really actually creatures of any sort
they're weapons designed to look and act like they're creatures
~~I remember~~
like....how would they even manage that?
Of course, it woudl be hard to get rid of said noise **without** killing them
killing noise doesn't count, apparently <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~so basically, Batman's a magical girl~~
I never hated her
Smol Millarc was awesome and you can't convince me otherwise <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and that significance is MONAH!!!!
there is still significance, though

~~inb4 <:Ver:336656981144109066> face~~
poor Fine
just a reference
not even a flashback
So now Fine made her XV comeback, but only as a reference <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
now I remember
oh god
noice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Would've been nice to get some Kirika backstory, too
then it fucking wasn't <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712>
they zoomed in on that "Tsukuyomi Shrine" sign at the very end of the episode like as if it was gonna be a big deal
I'm still wanting that Shirabe backstory they hinted at in AXZ
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
~~the whole series was Shem-Ha's dream all along~~
but before I do
well I'mma go nap

blame Solo
who tries her best, but doesn't know they secretly hired her only because they couldn't legally just give up <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>

Miku made her jealous, so she imagined Maria and the two children they're gonna officially adopt later
Tsubasa's still in the hospital after <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> , and all this time she's just been coma-dreaming about Hibiki actually being a good partner, and Chris being friends.
What if...this is **Tsubasa's** illusion?
What if this isn't Hibiki's illusion?
~~and then I wake up in an empty black void, looking up to see my cat in a lab coat writing stuff down~~
if anything I'll just get charged with animal cruelty AND sent to the physce ward.
If I decide to start experimenting on my cat, and the police find out about it, I'm not gonna be able to get out of jail by claiming he's "just a dream"
A rat in a lab isn't any less real than the rat that's living on the streets outside
that still requires the custodians to...you know...ACTUALLY CREATE A WORLD THAT ACTUALLY EXISTS
that is very different from just imagining everything
Not only is it lazy theorizing, but it's also undermines the story. "it's all a dream anyway, so nothing you're writing actually matters!"
I'm getting tired of all the "IT'S ALL A DREAM" or "THEY'RE ALL STUCK IN PURGATORY" theories.
really though, it'd be nice if fan theories could be more unique
The way they act in the show....they would totally be burning in hell <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the theory were true for South Park <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
'cause, you know, CLEARLY the only way a show could be from a child's imagination is if that child is burning in hell
especially shows with worlds that work similarly to how a child might perceive things.
but it's still ridiculous how many shows people try to stick said theory onto
"actually set in purgatory" theories usually have a bit more weight to them, IMO
which is one reason the theory is so prelevant
and we still, to this day, haven't gotten any proper explanation behind that weird faceless squall thing
I've mainly seen them with Pokemon and FFVIII ("Squall is dead, guys!!!)
let people be pissed off about it after the series loses all relevancy <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
at least, not for a long while
probably wouldn't even ever mention it in interviews or anything
they probably wouldn't mention it at all in-universe, even if it were 100% true
but it also feels....I dunno, lazy?
I mean, it's kinda fun to think of what each person might represent
I generally don't like these kinds of theories
And Shem Ha is just Hibiki wanting to communicate her gay feelings to someone
OOF
So Miku is fake and is just Hibiki in denial of being gay
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
We'll have a perfect ending ~~in the movie~~
~~besides, has anything on MAL ever actually recieved a perfect 5 rating after more than a few votes?~~
and that's enough to kill a perfect score
there's 100% guaranteed to be that *one* guy who doesn't like it, at the absolute least
I doubt it
ytho?
why do we want Miku to be villain in the first place? <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
it's not gonna be "hey,  your feelings" "OH SHIT YOU'RE RIGHT TIME TO FIGHT MY FRIENDS AND KILL EVERYONE LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL"
There's is definitely at least one thing in Miku's heart for Shem Ha to exploit, but it would probably take *years* of subtle work to actually capitalize on.
which, again, we have exactly one episode left for
and when it's a very weak reason....it's usually something that needs to be built up to something bigger first
though not always a whole lot of reason
and technically, there's *always* a reason to turn villain
yeah, not a lot of canonical evidence on that
it's a *very* common villain trope to try and weaken the hero's resolve
Just because a villain says "this is *totally* what you're thinking and what you meant!", doesn't mean that's actually what the hero is thinking and what the hero actually intends.
mind games, essentially
Shem Ha was twisting Miku's words to justify everything with "you totally want this, trust me!" in an attempt to weaken Miku's resistance.
that conversation with Shem Ha was her trying to break free, not her changing her mind
period
at all
She never had **any** say in the matter
she was **forcibly kidnapped** by NR and was unconscious the entire time, only "waking up" in that mental place
at **no** point did Miku want to be taken over by an evil custodian
Shem Ha was essentially twisting Miku's words
"it's ok, you actually want this, trust me!"
that was just her trying to justify it to Miku
Shem Ha forced her way into Miku from the beginning
when did Miku even have any say in the matter?
when did ShemHa trick Miku?
uh
especially with only one episode left to give her a reason
I feel like there's a reason Kaneko made a point to specifically use SSj
I"m not sure the "flesh to flesh" thing is gonna be it, but I'm not gonna rule it out entirely, either
how that happens remains to be seen, though
it's pretty likely she's getting her own body back (or at least her own physical appearnce)
running away isn't a good solution, but ok :|
^^
that doesnt' mean you give up on trying, though
ever
you'll literally never become perfect
fun fact about life
well
no one is perfect
everyone makes mistakes
then strive to improve in the future, dess
and then proceeded to discuss your comic book stuff
like, there are several times where you've blatantly stated "I think this is what's gonna happen"
you talk about them like as if they are, though
but please please please *please* stop pushing those ideas onto the main canon
I don't care if you wanna make a Symphogear fanfic based off of comic books
I don't care if you like comic books
and that's the part that upsets me
you're not making comparisons. You're pushing comic book-based fanfic ideas onto the main canon
or "this thing that happened in a comic books is totally gonna happen in Symphogear!"
yeah, but you talk about those comparisons like "Shem Ha should totally do this thing that this comic book villain did!"
Shem Ha isn't Ego
Also
**one**
we have one episode left
and again....evil Miku isn't happening in canon
especially with anything that involves DC or Marvel stuff
you do a lot
but don't push your fanfic ideas onto the main canon
you can do whatever fanfics you want
don't push them onto canon
but again
have your ideas
and again, ideas are fine
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
so uh
ok, you weren't really talking about evil Miku that much, but you did mention wanting to drink Hibiki's tears
you mentioned nothing about space adventures during this whole "evil  miku" discussion
"not me" says the guy who's been pushing for it this whole time
but keep it out of canon
I mean, if you want evil Miku in your fanfic, go for it
if anything, that just makes it more unlikely
and how is Miku being evil supposed to be facilitate the kiss?
First you want HibiMiku, then you want them to break up
armor is not that bad of a fetish to have, dess
just because you don't know yours yet doesn't mean it's not there
literally everyone in existence has a fetish, dino
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
yes, let's see the funeral Tsubasa missed out on!
~~let's just ignore the fact I was supposed to be writing it from episode one~~
speaking of fanfics, 4 more days until I start writing <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but for now, I'd rather not
maybe I'll get more comfortable in the future
I'm not really comfortable writing that kind of stuff, dess
~~BECAUSE GOD~~
~~it'll probably be my one and only fanfic with sex in it~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~i'mma write an AU fanfic where Miku becomes god and no one can stop HibiMiku because GOD~~
because MIKU IS FUCKING GOD, BITCHES, AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
and no one can stop them
and then they kiss
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Miku becomes God
so what you're saying is....
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
and *that's* how Shem Ha is defeated
SSJ purifies Yggdrasil
nononono
although that'll probably happen too
not "holding everyone's hands to power up the beam"
no I mean, "handholding" as in Hibiki befriending Shem Ha
but you know full damn well Kaneko's doing it <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I really have no idea how that's gonna work out
~~but not before Hibiki handholding~~
so it very likely is capable of a **much** more powerful beam
I mean, I think the SSJ we have now is more "complete" than the other one
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
what happened?
wait
dino and I pretending nothing ever happened <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
more theory crafting
dino freaking out <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
me getting upset <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and I don't think it's gonna be limited to just "Miku's using her old gear again, guys!!!!"
even if there's no laser, SSJ is almost for sure getting involved somehow
....I think I missed that one...
oof
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<@486087033652248576> Ogawa. Discuss
I'm staying out of <#336297808221044736> y'all can just keep guessing
<@115744398997716995> no, but that would actually be a fun fetish to have
y'all can know about my fetish for foxgirls <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
my main fetish, anyway
I will probably literally never mention my fetish on this server, or anywhere else <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
not my fetish, but that still sounds like a cool cafe
~~and then get dirty all over again~~ <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
probably for the best
Mwahahahahhahahahahah
I will kill you with thrist!
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
knowing people's weaknesses is fun
Just start spouting about quantum mechanics the moment you're out the womb.
hell, it's anime. You can be NEWBORN and be a top scientist
~~that's 100% exactly who I was thinking of, but forgot her age~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you can be 9 and be a top scientist
I want my <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I'm ok with that
I hear "deus" all the time but never "Diabolus"
oh, that's an actual, seperate thing
Deus Ex Machina?
I don't think we really have a full and proper explanation
probably something like that
it's far more their personality, and probably a huge dosage of Hibiki's influence
so honestly? I don't think their age has much to do with it
Even little kids don't forgive trauma too easily, typically
young or not, that shit is fucking traumatizing
I mean, that fangirl Milaarc killed was likely younger than both of them, and I don't think she'd forgive Milaarc that easily even if she somehow survived
stop assuming the worst in me, Saki
I'm not saying your feelings are stupid, I'm saying your expectations for the anime are wrong
NR shouldn't be a shocker to anyone
we've had 5 seasons of villains being redeemed
<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
but you watch anime
you don't like anime
~~friendly reminder Elsa's the one that likely masterminded the concert attack Milaarc launched~~
~~friendly reminder Shirabe was the one who told Elsa "don't forget kindness"~~
welcome to Magical Girl anime
Mel ninja'd by Saki <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556>
we're safe?
so
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
according to google translate, yes
I feel like that's probably a pretty serious medical issue <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
maybe discord is afraid we hate normal form Millaarc too much <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
reasons
because
~~inb4 blu-ray changes~~
I mean, it's a bit late for that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and no one ever even tried to correct me from using "Milaarc" this whole time <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
goddamnit Dx
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME IT WAS 2 "L"'s THIS WHOLE TIME?!
smolbat
basically
I'm not really disappointed they were ultimately redeemed, but I *really* wish there was more time for them to....you know...actually **earn** it
no time whatsoever to actaully resolve anything outside of "oh ok, I guess we're sorry now, lol"
there were only 2 episodes left, so the whole thing had to be rushed
the biggest problem was how quickly their redemption happened
couldn't actually hurt Chris, so just blocked her vision for like, 3 seconds <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> \
watching her "attack" Chris was hilarous
and yes, Smol milaarc was adorbs
I sincerely doubt Symphogear would go out of it's way to explain the irony like that
I would think the Mark almost certainly does something along those lines
They were made into "perfect monsters"
How would they be "too human"?
memes are extremely important, dess!
~~and also with how little I woudl actually use such an expensive program~~
photoshop is too expensive for me, especially when a good free alternative is available
I think I've only dabbled in photoshop like, once a longass time ago
it would take me probably at least 10 minutes just to learn things <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I don't know how to do *anything* in it
I'm a complete and total noob with GIMP
~~not me, I'm too lazy to mess with colors and shit~~
someone's gonna try it, atleast
100% chance it's getting emote status later though <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
sadly, no
yeah, saying otherwise would be a pretty difficult argument to make
I'm assumming Smollaarc counts as a spoiler <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I've got some time. IIRC Mel isn't adding any XV emotes until the spoiler policy is over
eh, I guess I"ll give it a try later
I know, I know
~~I'll bug Rany for it~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I'm not good enough at art, Saki
in fact, I'll probably suggest that once the spoiler policy is up
~~we need a smollaarc emote~~
smollaarc!
Uh oh
hah
I'm not sure they'd pull her VA just to have her react to a thing in a single episode, either
that sounds like something they would save for the specials <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I base this on literally nothing, but I'm totally right!
Guys, it's *obviously* Shem Ha! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~inb4 ShemHa's the scorpion~~
Hibiki will be SAFE, DAMNIT! <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>

FUCK YEAH
~~inb4 team america world police storm Yggdrasil~~

then pray to the devil!
and once again, Dino is pushing his DC comics fanfic onto the main canon <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I can't wait to see this awesome, new attack by Shirabe <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
same reason you would, Dino
don't do that to her again <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> '
Bikki already lost an arm once
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
disgusting
while repping Hibiki
~~inb4 it's Ver~~
Shem Ha's gonna die by fire?
~~if Bikki dies, I murder Joppy and dino~~ <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
<#601872369660854272> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
14 for me <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
~~live 2020 announcement when?~~
and now my cat won't GTFOff my lap
~~he probably got shoved into that underwater jailcell Ver was in~~ <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
I wanna see his reaction to songs saving the world, damnit! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and lol, the series *completely* forgot about Fudou in this final episode
~~but WTF was Ver doing there?~~
Loved how all their dead loved ones came back during that song
I'm pretty sure Sham Ha was, yes
and in other news that surprises literally no one.....
~~maybe MB will do a "what's in an opening" video and tell us~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean, we don't really know wtf the scorpion is either
like, there's not a whole lot of room for doubt
I mean, they still didn't explicitly state anything, technically, but....
I doubt it was just an "artistic choice", considering the girls were also reacting to the images
~~and like....their spirits visiting Earth from said afterlife~~
~~there's also the possibility of there being an afterlife~~
so Voy could get his thirst <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean, they were too far inland for the sub base
and also 100% Hibiki
It was fucking ridiculous
Hibiki's final attack was literally just a fucking hug
time to wait for YT subs and rewatch everything <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
2022 would be a bit too long of a wait, though
give me more time to save up and whatnot
I think I would actually prefer a Live 2021, TBH
that's the annoying thing about the Live 2020...it's still technically not 100% guaranteed to happen
13 episodes weren't enough for the awesomeness of Symphogear
I mean, the season as a whole was fairly rushed
it was 100% Hibiki
<@!486087033652248576> <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
We at least got group effort win against Yggdrasil
but the OG noise are gone gone
Alca-noise maybe
<@183270924701794305> They've already confirmed XV to be the final season. If we get another season of Symphogear, it'll be a new series entirely
Has that twitter thing ever been officially confirmed to be from an actual staff, though?
<@270093671779663873> that's why they put him in that underwater jail thing <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
uh....how is it even available for legal download?
it's probably technically canon that they're destroyed, but they left it open to be easily retconned just in case
left ambiguous in case they decide to do a spin off series or a movie or something.
and yeah, Mel's probably right
~~inb4 that's an animation glitch and they add the pendants in the blurays~~
We technically don't know for sure, but they don't have the pendants anymore so.....
After that ending, the fanartists will give us our Hibimiku kiss <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
elf9's body with Carol's memories
actually wait
<@263545619426181122> That's Elf9, not Carol
<@87512939107450880> I'm pretty sure quite a few people predicted that
Carol was **born**
Carol's a human
wat?
....build Carol?
then BOOM. MECH
at first I was like "eh....Maria's attack isn't that cool"
that mech was awesome
it wasn't a perfect ending, but I still liked it
that was....weird
oh shit, I almost forgot about the Chris thing
something is almost definetly off from CR subs
although I don't know if they actually called him a witch or anything like that
they did burn her father for his "miracles", after all
pretty much
I don't think her GX body could be the original, since the original wouldn't live that long
^^
though I think she did create more homonculus bodies apart from Elf9 to live for the time length she did
Elf9 is the homonculus. Carol was born a regular human
~~and yes, I'm fully aware it's highly unlikely~~
<@!99695384296701952> LET ME DREAM, DAMNIT
time for Kiwami 2!
anyway, I've chatted about XV long enough now xP
Though if they *do* release a NA version, I"ll 100% be all over it
and even then, it's not 100% guaranteed
XDU will release in the West **only** if the series gets a much bigger fanbase in the West (which is kinda of happening now)
XDU will probably die out when and only when it stops making money
XDU isn't going away just because XV is done
well yeah
though that remains to be seen
and we might technically get a different ending with a movie later <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the Lulu amel or whatever
one of the ancient humans
Fine was human
yes
They could actually explicitly have sex on-screen and the deniers will *still* claim "they're just really close friends!"
at this point, Hibimiku deniers are just straight-up in delusional denial and can't possibly be reasoned with
though I don't think Miku would actually call Hibiki's fist "cursed"
~~are you sure she faked it?~~ <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I'd say pretty high
I'm not really counting on that, but I woudln't be surprised, either
and even in the case of A, they would likely either hire those animators well before the final episode, or afterwards
There's absolutely no way any anime studio would hire more animators right in front of the final episode unless A. they're already planning on doing more and need more animators or B. something disastrous happened.
TL;DR, I'm not holding my breathe on anniversary Lives
And maybe like.....8% sure there'll be a 10 year anniversary Live
I'm 99% sure there's gonna be a Live 2020 (or 2021, at the latest). I'm maybe like....5% sure there's gonna be a "5 year anniversary" concert
geah is better than love live <:HibikiBlep:605209109284782090>
Let me dream this time, Mel <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
~~inb4 world tour~~
ohey
wait, it was for sure confirmed that it's happening?
~~and now they're engaged!~~
So.....XV is when they propose? <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
~~We did get some awesome robots out of it, though~~
and we didn't even get the yuri bait! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
DMJii probably did their confession off-screen sometime in the middle of XV
the main series is 100% done
it'll be a recap movie or a spin off series or something like that
Either way, they've already confirmed this to be the final season. If there's going to be any more Symphogear, it's not gonna be a season 6
they can't animate a whole episode overnight <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
like....if it's gonna happen at all, it's gonna take some time, you know?
the 5th season literally *just* ended, and you're asking if there's a 6th?
yes
yes he is
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Carole
~~it's called "hell"~~ <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I mean, she'd be playing plenty of Minecraft too
Fortnite, obviously
Why wouldn't wholesome strike you as wholesome?
because it is?
~~boss~~
So Shirabe's her editor <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~Female Japanese Jacksepticeye~~
Kirika's energy would be fun to watch in basketball
either that or an athlete
haha, I can see that
~~Hibiki would be an awesome counselor and no one can tell me otherwise!~~
whether that be nursing, counseling, or even police work
Hibiki would be doing whatever job she thinks she can help the most people with
Wait, was Dino locked out of posting in <#357682999300718592>, or is he just worried about XV spoilers?
Mate, you have no right to condemn them for changing the wiki if you don't even know yourself
"I think?"
~~inb4 they answer it in a future book~~
they're not obligated to answer just because we want it, unfortunately
though I kinda doubt they'll 100% confirm the destruction/survival of the gears either way, tbh
well, we'll see I guess
because I feel like they're probably done with the keywords
like, do we even have an accidental soft confirm from a VA tweet or anything for that?
yeah, have they even said anything about continuing the keywords?
what's happening tomorrow?
....why tomorrow?
I think maybe that *was* the ending he wrote, but the producers wanted to leave it open, so they gave evidence to allude to his written ending, without actually saying "yeah, this is 100% what happened"
yeah, but Shem Ha didn't necessarily repair their Symphogears
oof
they left that ambiguous
To be fair, we never saw the converter units survive, either
this isn't the goddamned MCU or DC comics
just....no
no Dino
no
SONG takes care of other things, too
even if all the alca-noise are gone, I doubt they'd just completely disband the organization
and yeah, SONG would most definitely still be around
not necessarily because of the community, but because the gameplay was too boring to keep my interest for very long
but didn't play for very long
I mainly played League for a bit because Ahri
~~but she'd be fine with Overwatch?~~
^^^
and whatever other game she can run around yelling in
mst is BESTst!
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
stop living in weird timezones, Ninryu!
Ninryu just lives in the wrong timezone
you don't stalk the right channels at the right time to catch the elusive Ninryu <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Now if you *try* to edit the mistake and the admins block your efforts...then yeah, you have a right to be upset there
if you have knowledge that says "this is wrong", don't just keep it to yourself and fume at the Wiki
Wiki's are typically a group effort, relying on everyone to come together and share knowledge
and even if they are wrong with the change....become an editor and change it back yourself
not wanting to die **painfully** isn't the same as not wanting to die at all
living is not enjoyable in any way <<
fuck living
not living
oh no
but that's just me
I'd rather die in a much less painful way, hot girl or no
~~not as sexy as Millaarc, though~~
~~genocide girl is also sexy~~
Millaarc is, in fact, pretty damn sexy
I'm not complaining, mind you
I dunno man, they screamed pretty hard at the "MIllaarc is sexy" posters, too
From a few, englightened fans, sure
While I'm just sitting here like "I thought Millaarc was sexy before it was cool."
I love how the fanbase has gone from "FUCK NR I HOPE THEY ALL DIE A HORRIBLE AND PAINFUL DEATH WITH NO REDEMPTION!!!!!!!!!" to "Actually now that I look at her, Millaarc is pretty hot."
so I'd say no
acceptance is the last stage
and if there's not, you're just gonna stay silent? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
them being a part of a group doesn't mean you're not allowed to have personal preferences anymore
well yeah
and like...you're allowed to like certain personalities and hate others, even if they do exist in the same group
sure, but they also have their own personalities
she killed only because "I have to!"
She never killed for fun or anything like that
The difference between pre-ending Germain and post-ending Germain was realizing those sacrifices **weren't** actually "necessary" after all
it was
even when just standing around all "Mwahahahahaah! Evil plan evil plan evil plan!"
Millaarc had a shit eating grin at pretty much all times, outside of when things weren't going her way, or when her family was hurt
Am I the only one who remembers her character bio from before the season even started?
I mean, we kinda knew from the very beginning that Millaarc didn't enjoy it
be careful in Japan if you have dark hair <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

it's pretty clear whoever gave it the translations doesn't speak *any* of the languages
google is woefully innaccurate
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
That episode with Mirai trying to steal Hibiki from Miku, though
Not as amazing as Kirika herself, but still amazing
Kiri Kiri was amazing
Clearly Wind Wings is the better idol duo <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>

of course
don't you guys all have sex with your very close **friends**?
anyway if we're gonna continue discussing fanfics we should move that convo to <#357682999300718592> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
are you kidding Dino? The bad  needs an excuse? Bitch please
I mean, true, but it doesn't hurt xD
and of course, fanfiction
it was a good ending. The destruction of the gears is heavily implied enough for a true ending, but juuuuuuuust ambiguous enough to leave room for a future sequel series
and yeah, this is still <#431914167826382860>. If you wanna discuss XV here go for it but if you wanna discuss your personal life either DM someone or bottle it up for a few more days
you're stuck in purgatory specifically because of your constant posting of spoilers outside of spoiler-friendly channels
I didn't think that was even part of the discussion
nor am I trying to imply such
I mean, I'm not telling you you should leave
though I still wouldn't be surprised if we get another Symphogear series down the road
rather than the show itself, per se
Thing is, the show will most likely be making money due to XDU
NO
S1 retcon movie!
~~they probably will, lol~~
^
pfft
even if it is ignored entirely for the rest of the series
it's a pretty big deal in S1
....did you seriously not know about that, Dino?
**especially** with her history of sexual abuse that's never actually properly addressed
I think it's the latter
she could be asexual, bisexual....or just not ready for that kind of stuff in this point in her life
she hasn't shown much interest in women, but she hasn't shown much interest in men, either
we don't actually know if Chris is straight
they shouldn't *have* to
sure, but when you're shoving your "right" way down everyone's throat and insisting you know the writer's intentions better than the writers themselves do....

channels about to die
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
and my screaming
WE'RE STILL ALIVE, BITCHES!!!!
I woke up before Mel did, apparently <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh cool
I agree it's still fucked up
But of course, church members "conveniently" forget about that part.
Hell, one of the leaders (don't remember which one. Might be Monson again) even states that being gay is NOT a sin. The sin is only when you ACT on those gay feelings and have sex with someone of the same gender as you
President Monson actually did very blatantly state that you're supposed to still love gay members, sinners or otherwise
That's another thing about the church, they pretty much ignore their leaders on anything that deals with loving people that aren't LDS
And man, what good christian could POSSIBLY love a monster from hell, amirite?
Apparently being born mentally disabled means you're a monster from hell
Hell, even when I *was* attending church and following the rules, they still only faked kindness to me, at best.
and I'm not LDS
I live in a city where, if you're not LDS, you're viewed as some kind of monster who's unworthy of God's love
Sometimes my cat helps, though
And trying to talk about it with strangers, no matter how nice they may be, just ends in frustration
Buying anything to help with it (like therapy or sun lamps or self-help books or w/e) costs too much money, which I don't really have any.
Anyone I have who's good to talk to is rarely around when I need them to be around
"sleeping it off" is about the only way I have to deal with my depression
I'm feeling better now~ <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Trip to McDonald's work
hopefully I'll be in a better mood to scream about Symphogear theories when I get back~
Actually, I'mma just walk over to the nearby McDonald's. Exercise is also good for depression, and also fuck paying almost $10 in delivery fees/service charges/etc <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
counseling tomorrow's gonna be fun <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Hopefully Hibiki can lift my mood back up
aaaaaaaaaaaand now I"m too depressed to function, but I've already literally JUST woken up from a "depression nap", so I guess I'll try dealing with it with food delivery and Symphogear music
and I'm already losing all the strength I have left to keep fighting
Symphogear means too much to me
and If I"m being 100% honest, I'm not sure that's a heartbreak I can survive
because's there's a 0% chance that I"ll be able to come up with the funding to go in the time leading up to it, and that's going to be absolutely heartbreaking to me
and that, quite honestly, scares me
Which also means it's very likely the next Symphogear Live concert will be the last
:|
And this is supposed to be the last season
right now, Symphogear is about the only thing keeping me going
and amongst all this, I'm still also doing my best to help others, many times at the expense of my own needs
literally every second of my life, I'm reaching out someway somehow
anything and everything I can
my freakin' dick
my hair
when my legs won't do, I use my head
when my right arm got tired, I reach with my leg
when I couldn't reach with my left arm, I reached with my right
That's literally my entire life
literally my entire life
I have
as much love as I've put into the world, even when people didn't fucking deserve it (*cough*mormons*cough*), I think I deserve my fair share of happiness
Just ONE thing
*sigh* I just wish SOMETHING would actually work out for once
but then again, if I'm gonna end up killing myself regardless if I stay here
once you become homeless, it becomes almost impossible to rise back up in life
especially with all the discrimination towards the homeless in most cities
and living on the streets isn't exactly ideal living conditions
it's MUCH harder to get a job, especially if you don't have any place to shower and get dressed and such for an interview
the problem with being homeless is I won't exactly have constant internet access outside of maybe public wifi, which will make watching Symphogear kind of hard
Actually, at this point, I might almost be better off homeless in another state than living in my apartment here
If only moving to another state was a simple as deciding you want to, and then just packing up and leaving
monster from hell
boom
joined the church, but aren't following every single rule perfectly?
once they realize you're not swayed, boom. You're a monster from hell
Highly compassionate, but only towards their own kind, or a non-member they think they have a really good chance at converting if they shove enough "love" down that person's throat
so on and so forth
and then care for another month or two
and probably drive someone else to suicide
then they'll just go right back to being the piles of living trash they are
for a month or two, anyway
And MAGICALLY, they'll suddenly start caring about all the shit they've done to take me to that point
they would genuinly be sad about it
If I actually do kill myself
That's the funny thing, though
Idaho Falls is basically SLC, but WORSE
and literally NOTHING is working out on trying to move out of this fucked up place
Growing up in this "oh-so-loving" community has done nothing for me but push me to the brink of suicide more times than I can count
How can this possibly be "God's one true church" if literally NONE of his supposed followers are incapable of even the most basic love?
if they know you have gay feelings are and trying hard to not act on them and be a good member of the church, they still hate you
at all
which members don't
but it at least leaves room for you to love them
although I don't care enough to yell at you if you keep referring to me as a "he"
well, he biologically, but I'm super feminine and prefer "she"
She
~~but boy did I unload some heavy shit the other day....~~
not long enough to really know anybody here yet
possibly 3
been here for....2 days, I think?
I wasn't around in March, so yeah, clueless <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
an apology from the artist, you mean?
normally I don't care much about grammar so long as I still understand what you're saying, but I couldn't really fully understand what you were saying
because it sounds like you're talking about two different female persons, but your grammar never properly indicates any switch?
are there two different "she's" in that?
uh
~~doesn't help a lot of people purposefully hide their intent~~
and there's a LOT of miscommunication in the world
A good majority of miscommunication issues arise from not fully understanding the other's intentions
in fact, it's actually pretty damn common for others to midjudge your intent
People can't always read intent
from my experience, anyway
Most people will take "do as you please" as a way of saying "I don't want to feel bad about it, but I'm telling you to do it"
or at least, that's how it's usually interpreted
It's kind of an implied "go ahead and do it".
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
*totally*
I'm *totally* being serious
nah, man
"I don't like the law, so I'mma declare myself immune to it. That's *totally* how society works!"
sovereign citizen farce?
(and why are we still getting our shit from China if we have such a large company to make our shit?)
that's a pretty fucking big company
The entire country as a company?
and I drank more water than I usually do when I got home, so there's a healthier choice I made~
as long as I remember for next time
but, not a whole lot of point whining about it now
a side salad still would've been a good choice. Healthier, and would've improved my mood just as much
I totally forgot I could've replaced the fries with a side salad, too
<:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Mcnugget meal with large soda, and one of those stroopwaffel mcflurrys
good, but not very healthy <:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
Thank you Kiribot~
<@431656503490117632>
also
Best I could've gotten in any court case would be getting him to buy me a new bike or something. And hiring the lawyer to get me that money would cost a lot more than just buying a new bike myself
my bum hurt for a bit, and that was it. That was literally the full extent of my injuries sustained in the crash
especially with no actual injuries save for what my bike went through
it wasn't much money (only $100), but I'm a pretty forgiving person, and it would've been more hassle than what it was worth to actually take him to court
later on the older guy's son came over and offered money + an apology in exchange for not pressing charges
the crash was serious enough to break my bike's front tire and severly damage my helmet, but I managed to suffer only a hurt bum for a few minutes
well, husband and wife. I don't remember any kids
luckily some hispanic family saw the whole thing happen. They pulled over in their car, and the mom called the police while the dad came out to check on me
Some older guy hit me with his truck, backed up enough for me to drag myself back onto the sidewalk, then fucking left
a hit-and-run <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
I've only been in one other major bike crash
and this was back when I was.....I dunno. 7? maybe 8?
well, fortunately I've never had anything like that since
huh
I was able to walk almost the full length of a street, put a bike away, and go into my bed before it finally happened
doesn't it normally happen IMMEDIATLY upon injury?
although it's still weird to me that it was so delayed
that's what I figured
yeah
just straight-up unconciousness
not deep sleep
then I went to bed....and unconciousness
I crashed my bike on the other end of the street where I lived, and was basically fine while walking it and myself back home
and it was pretty delayed, too
I definitely lost consciousness for a short bit, whatever it was
if it was, it wasn't a very serious one
maybe?
I....MIGHT have experienced a coma?
heheheheh. "coma section"
~~and me being a fucking fatass~~
Although I guess that's kinda expected with Rachel being from a relatively unknown anime
People liked my Pickle rick. Nobody cared about my Rachel <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I was also PICKLE RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!! for a bit on Sunday
Rachel Gardner (Angels of Death)
actually, I straight-up did a female char cosplay last October at Anime Banzai
There's also a lot of female chars I wanna cosplay
<@173112001684439040> One day I wanna wear a beautiful Kimono. Not one of those male ones, either.
Well I'm glad it's working out
let's talk about dicks another time <:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
but still
well, not entirely unprompted
true, but also <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
.....that explains so much.....
(and once again, I'm trying to use KC server emotes)
I have a penis
I mean
Which, BTW, you'd better be willing to kill yourself, too. Because guess what? Genocide makes you a fucking asshole yourself
Or you Hitler
So either you change their hearts
repeat ad nasuem
and then when you get rid of that other tool, they'll find/make yet another
and then when you get rid of THAT tool, they'll find/make another
and if they can't find such a tool, they'll MAKE such a tool
getting rid of the tools they use to be assholes will only lead to them finding other tools to be assholes with
the only way you're gonna solve the "people are fucking assholes" problem is to either A. convince them to stop being assholes or B. genocide
and again, punishing the tool for the sins of its users isn't going to do jackshit to solve the issue
just because a tool is abused, doesn't mean the tool itself is inherently evil
and it DOES have its place
that, again, is a tool
which is to say, I pretty much don't post at all unless I'm retweeting something :B
I don't post as much as I feel like I should
I mainly just use twitter to keep up on my favorite content creators
Take away one method for being an asshole, and they'll find another
getting rid of the tool won't solve the user problem
that's a user problem, not a tool problem
but again
well yeah
and getting rid of the tool (or punishing the guy who made it, for that matter) won't do anything to solve the issue at all
they just tend to be abused
blocklists are a good tool, though
~~and it's not like this world doesn't entirely deserve it~~
and yet, being an asshole seems to be the only way to actually get ahead in life at all <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
but I don't want to be that kind of asshole Dx
see if I can actually fool people into giving me monthly tithe
I'm half-tempted to make a twitter account and start proclaiming myself God from it
good luck finding them in the system
so
well again, I don't know where TF ANYONE is getting these documents
If I start tweeting out about how I'm God, will people start paying me tithing? <:Ver:336656981144109066>
but where is this "moonifest" person getting the document?
Also, lol @ anyone taking this self-admitted troll seriously
And where is HE getting the scripts
so I couldnt' tell ya
I'm not even sure where you're grabbing these scripts from, nor am I super familiar with public records laws
nobody likes facts, unless said facts agree with their pre-conceived worldviews
They almost for sure are
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Star Wars is a much longer series with much more lore behind it
well, most the important bits, anyway
Kinda like how I know *most* the story behind Star Wars, despite having only ever watched Rouge One
and any plot point I happen to not know about is most likely completely unimportant anyway
There's probably NO plot point I DON'T know about
and I have watched youtube videos on it as well
I never watched the show/read the manga to begin with. I just got the full story from everyone else who won't STFU about it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That's the problem with Asperger's Syndrome. It makes it almost impossible to properly communicate what you mean to others <_<
and I guess I went a little overboard with it
pointing out how it's just as fucked up IRL as it is in the anime
I was mostly just using Death Note as an example because it's an example people in an anime-based server are more likely to be familiar with
My hate for Light's philosophy has little to do with the anime
Mind you, I don't fault neither the creator nor the series for this
whether the creator intended or not, it spawned a LOT of angsty teens agreeing with Light's philosophy and bring death notes to school and shit
And another thing
Sure, but the series acknowledging him being an asshole doesn't make me hate him being an asshole any less
Killing innocent people to keep his secret safe and whatnot
Oh yeah, and keep in mind this is even ignoring all the stuff he does after the police start investigating him
Unless he just gets rid of all laws and make it impossible to commit crime since nothing is a crime, but I don't think that's what he was going for at all
Which means he can't claim he actually made a crime-free world
Thus, his new world is 100% guaranteed to have at least one criminal in it
but yeah, Light was willing to kill all the criminals, but afterwards he was also going to rule the world as God, despite having turned himself into a criminal
well, there's other MAJOR issues with his plan as well (such as the fact that new criminals might be born even after you get rid of them all)
By killing all criminals, you become a criminal yourself
That's actually one of the biggest problem I had with Light's whole plan, even before he lost all sanity
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
"kinda a weeb" is still a weeb <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
because you have no right to do so
well that's good
and then they act like they have any right whatsoever to whine about how much the world sucks
everyone's either apathetic, or wants to burn the whole world down
and again, that apathy is the problem
or there's one person running unopposed
there's a lot of local elections I end up not voting for specific positions just because there isn't any information on the candidates for a lot of the positions
I did my research
that's why you do research
I'd rather say "I tried" than say "I obediently bent over and spread my cheeks"
I voted Libertarian last two elections, and I likely will again this upcoming election
and then the young people whine about it on social media like as though that actually will make a difference
and then the old people get to control everything unopposed
all the young people go aroudn thinking "my vote won't make any difference anyway, so why bother?"
and that's the problem
probably still misspelled her name but w/e
....watch the upcoming race be between him and Hilary again....
~~don't reelect him, plzkthnx~~
well, hopefully now you know not to trust people so much
but really, why would you expect a madman to have commited exactly zero crimes?
~~and also madmen~~
problem is, that requires the population to WAKE. THE FUCK. UP.
or at least become a big enough threat to the presidency that the other two parties start to worry more about pissing the population off
we need a Libertarian to take office and fuck up the other two parties
and I'm fairly confident Hilary would've done the same
~~there was a time when it wasn't relevant?~~
(which I'm still not 100% convinced on, but I'm not exactly 100% convinced otherwise, either)
And I'm not just talking about the whole Trump/Russia thing, either
we're so worried about accidentally electing a spy or some BS, but then we have "pure American" politicians who have just as many interests/ties with other countries
doesn't really matter when it was written
I can understand not letting a Canadian citizen be President, but a Canadian-American should be allowed to run
which is a stupid law, considering we're supposed to be a country that celebrates diversity
even if they have US citizenship, IIRC
Sadly, Canadians, by law, can't be US president
~~maybe 20~~
we definitely need a third party president in office for a term or two
I doubted they wanted him to begin with, and.....
can we stop using "blacks" or "whites"
nicer than the FUCKING GHOSTS
And a black that was pretty black, but was super nice
I've also seen FUCKIGN GHOSTS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
crazy, right?
I *have* seen people
why yes
they're like FUCKING GHOSTS
actual whites are fucking scary
and actual whites
I have seen actual blacks before, tho
and most blacks I've seen are a lot more brown than black
it's like....pinkish white
most "white" isn't even white
white is white
poor white people are supposed to work at McDonald's, apparently
Even the people behind the counter taking my money and making my food are mostly caucasians.
0% criminals
70% white guys
walk into KFC
I'm supposed to avoid going to KFC 'cause that's where blacks eat and blacks are all gansta criminals and whatnot
hence why I have such a hard time taking them seriously
Makes it hard for me to take stereotypes seriously
Y'all are supposed to me tempting me into some freaky orgy or something, and so far I've yet to recieve any such invite <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Funny how the groups of people I'm "supposed" to hate the most are usually the people that are the kindest to me
educate the future so they don't repeat our mistakes, but don't just keep making said mistakes meanwhile
and in pretty major ways
people are getting hurt NOW
cause like
but we also need something more.....immediate
Education needs to be a part of trans rights, sure
it is what it is because people make it what it is
Trust me, I would LOVE to move out of Idaho to a place with more youth action
anyway, I have to go help my aunt run errands now, so I'll have to continue later
and have found none
I've actively looked for such groups
Hell, the US doesn't even really have the best democracy anymore
the US is no longer the great, amazing country everyone continues to exclaim it is
and people are happier in other countries than here in the US
Well yeah, but I'm not trying ot move to Russia or Korea
Plus, other countries are constantly being ranked higher than the US for various standards of living
but some counties have action in addition to the whining
sure, every country has whining
all I see the youth in my country do is whine and cry on social media
I've seen youth in other coutnries actually taking action to improve their country
because frankly, why live a life that is 100% punishment and 0% reward?
and if it's just 100% impossible....then suicide really is the answer :\
I deserve to have at least *some* joy before this world just ends
I've suffered enough for 3 decades
all the more reason to get out of the country NOW Dx
so
and I'm no good at rally cries
and everyone who actually wants to make it happen, has given up
And as much as I want my own country to do that, I can't make it happen
Like, there are countries out there that are actually changing for the BETTER
and some of which I've already mentioned anyway
too many to list here
I mean numerous things
*sigh* why I can't I just be allowed to live with individuals who are as capable of love as I am?
so basically, I'm just fucked
so beyond any student/youth exchange program Dx

~~big reason I won't move to Japan, despite how much I love the culture~~
I don't think I want to be on the recieving end, plzkthnx
I've seen how we treat minorities
side note: anyone know of a good way to move out of the US with no money? <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
read it differently the first time
I get it now
"reductionist"
"reducing"
oh
at least not while I"m still here
plz don't
reductionist?
<@284390402210136064>  not by American standards <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ah
also, POC? I don't think I"ve heard that term before
~~I promise to stop using ghosts :B~~
or like....any color?
a bunch of people made him out to be an entirely different kind of guy
someone murdered a chick
to try and push some "anti-men on the internet" agenda or something?
what do any of these people have to gain by making him out to be some random internet dude who got jealous?
Jesus, even legit murder stories get twisted
I really hope someone closer to this guy reports him as well
The problem is gathering enough evidence for them to actually be able to do anything about it
but then again, this is the internet
I'm pretty sure he is
Like Hibiki, I try to help people in need whenever I can
And again, I don't like seeing some bad thing coming, and then being unable to prevent it
I know at least some of what he's going through, and I know how fucking serious it is.
I've mostly overcome them, thankfully, but it wasn't by bottling it up and pretending everything's fine
This is especially concerning to me, because I've struggled with similar thoughts myself before
I guess I'll gather the screenshots and look online if I can find the state police
it would most likely be a .gov site
~~and I forgot the Russian cities anyway :B~~
but this guy isn't one of those Russians
well, a couple of the Russians have mentioned their city before
~~or this one, for that matter~~
I don't think I know anyone's city in that server
just the state
I don't actually know the county, though
~~and tries to apologize so he can get back in the server....and piss people off again~~
~~and then there's this other guy who goes out of his way to piss people off, then wonders why he gets banned <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~
I don't like knowing he's dangerous and being able to do nothing about it Dx
And of course, even with that there's the possibility of him lying and giving me someone else's name instead. Or just straight up making a name up
Unless I can somehow convince the guy to give me his IRL name and whatnot
And most likely, the police would arrest and charge me without doing anything with whatever info I find
which I'm 99% sure would be considered a crime, righteous intent or otherwise
well I don't really know how I would get more information short of hacking into his IP myself
well I definitely don't have this guy on facebook
I don't think I like that <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
So basically I just have to sit here and hope that whatever he attempts is unsuccessful?
and they can't get that warrant based off of chat logs sent in to them?
well sure, but I think they should be allowed to do it in cases like this
can't they look up the discord ID and trace it's IP or something?
Well, I at least know he's in California
Anything I can do about it at all?
And I'm extremely worried no one around him's gonna get him that help either until *after* either a suicide attempt or a serial killing attempt
Like, it's clear as day this guy needs some fucking help, and he's already stated several times he's not gonna seek it himself
and in pretty explicit detail most the time, too
talking about how he's gonna kill himself
Talking about how he's gonna kill this person or that person
Because there's a guy in another server I'm in that has some.....rather disturbing chats recently
So hey, is there any place where I can send chat logs to report people to the authorities?
Heck, maybe I can even get a job with an airliner and use my employee benefits to travel the world a bit
and with all the job opportunties I'll have in Boise that I don't have here in IF, I might even be able to eventually move out of the state altogether without having to rely on government or family assistance
it'll still be Idaho, but at least it won't be Idaho Falls, ID
The best I can hope for right now is that the government gets off it's slow, lazy ass, approves me for the group housing funding, and then move into a group home in Boise
and everything I'm trying isn't working out
money I don't have
problem is, that costs money
~~This is why I don't watch the news at all anymore~~
And they *totally* reported on the **facts**, right? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so we try for 100% anyway
but it's ideals that change the world for the better
the world will never be 100% ideal
and again, "ideally"
Hence why we have no agency and just agree as individuals "This company is corrupt, so I'm not gonna watch them anymore"
hence "ideally"
And yes, I'm fully aware how unrealistic this all is
Have a set of guidelines we agree upon as a society, and then pay attention to which companies are following those guidelines
let the company simply fade from relevancy
Actually, the ideal situation would just be people realizing a particual company is unethical, and simply not vieiwing their news anymore
but small-scale
Kind of like a civilain government, I guess
but there needs to be an agency of some sorts that they have to answer to if civilians report them and say "we think these guys aren't following ethical regulations
I'm not saying government controlled, per se
and also HEAVY regulation on ethical journalism
If there's going to be News at all, we need laws against them being for-profit
money
and that's what it's ultimately all about
"LOOK AT HOW MUCH THIS CHANGE IS GONNA FUCK US UP, GUYS!!! 10 CHILDREN DIED IN THE PAST 100 YEARS BECAUSE OF THIS!!!"
The world benefits from change, and "News" is there to actively fight change.
Exactly my point. News doesn't really benefit society in any way. It claims to inform us, but in actual reality all it does is chain us down to old, outdated viewpoints
Honestly? News in general needs to die. It's all about making money rather than actual reporting, and making money means sensationalizing literally everything
And I don't like this BS either Dx
It's not my fault I was born in this country vs another <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Don't blame me for US headlines
The most convincing lies are the ones that are 99% true
IT GETS WORSE?!
we're EASY MODE?
oh god
~~and here I was hoping it was just an American thing~~
Just UK news?
Just.....ugh
Even if you happen to be writing an article on something I agree with
When you use that many buzzwords in one sentence, I automatically can't take you seriously
Ugh, I can't stand articles like that
like, he was an actual IRL friend, but for some reason people want to push the story of him being just some jealous discord dude
like...one state between us and the ocean
Although It's not too far inland
Idaho gets fucking cold
~~TRADE. PLACES.~~
~~let's trade places!~~
And it's a pretty state, from what I've seen
Oregon, maybe. I do like visiting my family in Oregon
Even ignoring the people there
In all seriousness, though, I don't think I'd be very happy in a state like California
Stay away from water, got it
or have money to pay for an uber, I guess.
I have two feet to walk on, and that's my transportation unless I can succesfully bug someone into giving me a ride
I don't even have a bike <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
0/10. Would not recommend
I've been homeless before myself.
I can't stay here, but moving in and of itself isn't going to be some magical cure-all.
And it's *really* hard to improve your lot in life when you're homeless, even in the best of cities
but....well, that's not exactly ideal living, either
at this point I'm almost wondering if it would just be better to sell everything I have and be homeless somewhere else
Same
So gib money plzkthnx <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I just need some funds from you guys to like....I dunno....buy weapons, I guess
On that note, I'm *totally* gonna save the world, guys!
Why save the world when I can just promise you all I'll save the world and get all those gofundme donations to my cause? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
taking actual action is hard. promising action is easy
Which politicians prefer, anyway
So instead, you have to promise it
And if it's almost reelection season, you're not gonna have the time to actually pass a law to make yourself look good
laws take time to take effect
especially if those laws don't actually pass while you're still in office
so slap on some fake law as proof of "action" and boom. You've got them controlled all over again
Well, sometimes people are juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust woke enough to require action.
"Also, it's the FCC's fault that the laws didn't do anything, so be sure to support my bill that would punish them!"
"look guys! We fixed the problem! Be sure to reelect us in the upcoming elections!"
Put the law in place to make yourself look good, but leave loopholes so your buddies don't actually get hurt by it
That's true as well
and while *you* might not be making a law like that without also making another law to require apologies, governments make mistakes like that fairly often
~~then again, people can be fucking stupid~~
And once everyone knows you're the bad guy, it's gonna be hard to do it some more and get away with it.
which makes you the bad guy
Apologizing for doing it is admitting that you're doing it
And without laws to make them apologize, they ain't gonna
sure, it's great if the apology is required to be noticeable, but that ain't gonna do shit if there's never an apology to begin with
But what's requiring them to apologize to begin with?
I love this video already xD
"continues typing backwards of epidemic"
Much as I love the guy's work, he's not a philosophy expert and I don't want him pretending to be one
and occasionally MatPat when he does one a more philosophical theory, which thankfully is rare
most my philosophy type stuff comes from Wisecrack
no I don't
then no
ah
uh....is that a general term for philosophy yt channels, or a specific channel?
you might want to look at Canada then
Ironicaly, the LDS faith places probably the MOST importance on family out of all the rest of society
yet if that same person were just some rando off the street, society would probalby take your side and say "yeah, they're fucking assholes. You shouldn't be around them"
The problem is society demands that you love your family no matter what, even in cases where *they* don't lvoe you
That, and fans of whatever future work I do
I'm at a point in my life where I've finally decided to only care about the opinions of those who can love and accept me.
So being related to me by blood doesn't get you automatic love from me, nor an automatic pass for your behaviour towards me
Blood ties have never really meant anything to me
If she can't accept and love me unless I conform to her religion, then she obviously doesn't actually love me and thus, her opinion is irrelevant to me
My mom for sure isn't, but again I'm leaving her so fuck what she has to say about it
Plus, my Dad is the type who would probably actually accept me for it.
My dad lives in Louisiana, and I'm leaving Idaho Falls where my Mom lives.
Society is fucked up >_>
Plus I am still male, so I'm less likely to be attacked/assaulted over it. (God, I hate saying that)
might as well allow myself to be happy with who I am instead of hiding it in hopes they'll magically love me someday
people are gonna discriminate against me no matter what
I don't care about being noticed, really
and for self-defense, I have martial arts classes I can take!
I'm a feminine guy who wants a feminine body, so muscle building is a no-no outside of what I need to be able to defend myself if someone tries to attack me or something
and I don't really want to do anything with weights, or at least not a whole lot
I know a pretty good stretch routine already
I'm eating a lot healthier now, but I"m still nowhere near where I realistically need to be
That's basically what my diet was like as a child/teen, and I let it carry on too far into adulthood
dieting is hard when you're used to a diet of like, 90% sugary nonesense
I probably won't cosplay any of my fanfic OC's :B
Not the Symphogear one
I also have an OC character I'd like to commission someone to make me a cosplay for as kind of a reward for getting in good shape
and plus, that gives me motivation to get in better shape
I'd just rather be skinny before doing a character I love as much as Hibiki
And yes, I know you don't *have* to be skinny to be allowed to cosplay whoever you want
but I wanna do it when I'm less of a fatass Dx
I wanna cosplay Hibiki at some point
post pictures!
do eet!
Asking for a friend <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~would a feminine guy be a witch, or a wizard?~~
Did he call on you for all the questions? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and some of the teachers were actually nice
I gave myself an A, and it stuck xD
I remember one year we got to give ourselves our grade
Although it wasn't all bad
I remember my mother forcing us to take institute classes during high school
fuck sunday school
ugh
Pretty much every church does, as far as I'm aware
"this one"
unless, of course, they're fanatical and can't possibly conceive that notion at all
everyone doubts themselves at some point or another
It's more of a human thing
Doubting you're doing the right thing isn't necessarily the result of religion being shoved down your throat
And the Book of Mormon is a fanfic sequel
of course it's just a phase! If they shove their beliefs down your throat enough, eventually you'll convert right back to Catholicism!
not a lot of atheists here, and the ones that are keep their mouths shut about it because of the mormons
like atheism!
I'll be glad when I can move away from this LDS community and can experience religions that *aren't* LDS
and yet, they're often the ones who are MOST unaccepting of family members who are outside the "norm"
.....what's the difference?
especially in a country like the US, where sexual talk of any kind is a big taboo
convincing society sex work is a legitimate business and is deserving of being legalized
yeah, that's another problem
Don't really like most of it, but I'm not gonna go around policing it
As long as neither party goes too far, I'm ok with it
My two biggest issues with it are A. customers who think boundaries are allowed to be broken because "it's their job!" and B. Sex workers who go too far in taking advantage of their customers.
So long as it doesn't get out of hand
I'm not against sex work.
Please don't D:
I mean, it's fine as long as neither party takes it too far
Eh....my opinion on that is rather mixed
I'd rather love someone for who they are than love them because they have money
It would be hard trying to repair the building and then have people going back in to work knowing 34 of their coworkers died there
So I've read, and can't say I really disagree with
Dead obvious they're just trying to capitalize on tragedy for the money.
That's what makes the article so hilarious (and also sad)
To no one's surprise
And not everyone thinks about letting the fans know what's going on
Not everyone wants to be on social media when they're in the middle of a tragedy
Yasuhiro could be keeping quiet simply due to mourning
If I get the opportunity to visit Japan someday, I'll probably visit myself and leave some flowers
A monument also gives the families, and the public, a place to mourn
not exactly the healthiest work environment
and I *definitely* don't pay much attention to behind-the-scenes drama
I barely pay attention to VA's
And since when do humans need a *sane* reason to do anything
there are plenty of reasons why she would
Death threats aren't as bad as being branded a sex offender and having your entire life ruined. Not unless people actually carry out those death threats
Which messes things up even for actual rape victims
She doesn't even need to be telling the truth or have any proof. Just mention rape and let the white knights flock in to "rescue" you.
All a woman has to do is say "this guy raped me" and boom. You're 100% fucked.
oh far from it
A drug scandal to them is like a sex scandal to us
They take drugs far more seriously than the US does
How could you possibly get bored of Bikki face? <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

Because BIkki
uh....unless that law is still in place you don't have to worry about medieval laws
~~that's what VPNs are for~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
There's probably a crime you commited today without knowing it's against the law
Everyone is commiting a crime, whether they realize it or not
There's a lot of BS laws in the books
~~depends on what you're hoarding~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
welcome to life
No one is perfect
Everyone has faults and flaws
literally no one should be blindly trusted, but "not blindly trusting" someone and "accusing of lying" are two seperate things
It's perfectly possilbe
no you don't
or to ask the other side for their part of the story
You don't have to accuse someone of lying to ask for proof
I mean....we've existed for how long? And we're jsut as far away from doing it today as we were from the very beginning
I'm losing faith in humanity's ability to ever do that
That's why looking at the full story is important
but not literally every time
there very often is fire where there's smoke
*isn't an inherently true statement
that doesn't mean I need to have them shoved in my face everytime
I make mistakes now and then
*please* stop attacking me over it
I suck at communicating my feelings properly
I have Asperger's
Look, I made mistakes
what are you guys accomplishing with it?
like....at all?
but is there really any reason to be bagging on me for bringing it up?
and yeah, maybe I shouldn't have brought it up to begin with
I'm allowed to get tired of a conversation later into it
like, seriously guys
And frankly, what does it even matter who brought it up?
There was vic talk before I came in
and I wasn't the one who brought up the Vic stuff earlier, either (although we don't know yet if the accusations are false or not, even if some of them were foudn to be lying)
I just said "a drug scandal to them is like a sex scandal to us"
no I didn't actually
I feel like there's never going to be any progress made
and it gets rather tiring
Everyone just wants to yell and accuse each other
I generally don't like discussions like these, because neither side is willing to listen
Like I said, everyone assumes the worse in everyone else
but we have that mentality anyway
It doesn't
Everyone assumes the worse in everyone else
Guilty until proven innocent. And even then, you're still guilty
but then again, wtf does society care?
And of course, it's not like everyone's lying aobut being raped, either
which makes them angrier towards future woman that make accusations, even with proof
Those death threats tend to increase in severity if/when you're proven to be full of shit
And yeah, like I said, these false accusations hurt actual victims as well.
We do a *lot* of things to hurt ourselves for no good reason
we're the most self-destructive species on Planet Earth
like, at all
We shouldn't go around assuming every man is a rapist because he's a man and someone said so
And those judgements are almost always assuming the worse in someone
People are WAY too quick to make judgements of each other
^^^
I do see where you think you're gonna lead me, yes. And I'm still gonna disagree with blindly taking sides without actually knowing anything
but still a lot
not as many
Again, a lot of factors
That depends on a lot of factors
if you think someone's a racist, and you have pretty good reason to belive so, it's ok to say "I don't want to hang out", even if you don't have definitive "no doubts whatsoever" proof
and if it's proven right or never disproven....then feel free to conintue thinking they're assholes
But if that evidence is later proven wrong or false, be willing to admit your mistake and forgive
and if the evidence says "this guy's a rapist" then yeah, cut them out of your life
Wait for as much of the story as you can get, *then* form an opinion based off that evidence
Don't side with the accuser. Don't side with the accused.
and don't form an opinon wihtout any evidence at all either way
but if later on it was proven that that evidence was actually wrong, be willing to forgive
and if you have that preponderance, then sure, cut them out
I've never heard the term before, so no I'm not familiar with preponderance
Us vs Them doesn't help anything
that doesn't help rape victims find justice
that doesn't reduce crime
that doesn't help us progress as a society
and there's nothing ok about that
facts be damned
they care about their opinion, and defending their opinion
Nobody cares about evidence or truth
I''m complaining about how this stuff destorys lives because we're destorying lives by taking sides without even knowing anythying or caring to know
and that's not very helpful to anything
All taking sides does is create "us vs them"
but until we have that full story, we shouldn't be taking sides
And yeah, authoriteis should give us the info on the story when they actually have the full story
society cares about forming an opinion, then defending that opinion to the death, even if proven wrong
Well society doesn't seem to care what the court of law has to say
Why shoudl society be getting involved into every alleged crime? We can help, sure, but most people get in the way more than they help
while society stays out of it until we have the information
I'm saying the authorites should be asking
I'm not saying all of society shoudl be asking
*cough*DonaldTrump*cough*
but now that some time has passed
Since i couldn't immediately think of an IRL person to use
I only brought him up as a quickie for an example of giant ego doing stupid/bad things
~~and we should probably stop the Seto talk in this channel~~
it's funny, because he also could've stopped the card from being used against him by simply using it himself and never risking it in a duel
*cough*SetoKaiba*cough*
giant egos do lead a lot of people to do stupid/bad things
<@238855496797257729> If it's a con no one's heard of outside the local area, it's probably a small con
Then again, maybe I'm just not seeing those controversies because they're not as newsworthy
Never to anyone who's up and coming
It does seem suspicious to me that these controversies almost always seem to only happen to the BIGGEST names.
Nice thing about smaller cons, I don't have to worry about controversy from the names too big to care about said con <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Let Vic know it's not gonna help his case if anything happens
And they need to make sure of that, too
I hope so
because what if he's not 100% innocent in every way? What if he's 100% guilty in every way, and now he's around young girls?
Even if he's 100% innocent in every way, don't go waiting to let everyone know he's gonna be right in front of them while the courts are still figuring things out
yeah, announcing Vic last-minute in the middle of a controversy like this is not really a good idea, regardless of the true nature of it all
I don't believe in the inherent need for a good, valid reason to do anything
I've seen too many humans do really stupid shit for really stupid reasons
I disagree, but to each their own, I guess
Honestly, I was never really talking specificlaly about Vic
and please don't assume the worst in every man that has accusations brought agaisnt them, whether Vic is proven innocent or guilty
but please be willing to support Vic in the future if the allegations are proven false
and yes, there's enough evidence to maybe not want to support Vic anymore
*everyone* should be waiting on more information
There should not be any "court of public opinion" right at the start of an investigation
How many times do I have to state that I'm against assuming the worse in literally eveyrone before you understand that I AM AGAINST AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMING THE WORSE IN EVERYONE
You're assuming that I'm part of public opinions, when I've stated over and over I'm against that
waiting for the court to shift thorugh this shit
I'm waiting on the sidelines
Except i"m not asking for proof, Melua
Depends on the circumstances, Melua
And Saki, I think you know full damn well that's a completely different scenario
They won't draft just for Iran
The fact that militaries even exist at all is fucking dark
War is dark
every military needs cannon fodder, but they'll never say that out loud 'cause that makes the military sound bad
so you can go die in place of someone more "important" than you
and honestly? With a guy like Trump in charge you'll be the *first* to be drafted
I'm pretty sure you can
The military will want anyone and everyone they can get. If you're not trained, you can be cannon fodder
Other big countries who think you overstepped
I'm not married, I don't have kids, and there's no one I'm really close enough to to say "this person should have all my stuff when I die"
I have nothing for anyone to inherit, and no one I can really say should get it even if I did
Well yeah, but that's for our kids to deal with, so it's ok!
Sides do benefit from war. It's just that those benefits come at a massive cost
Wars are "needed" because humans are fucking stupid and can't possibly fathom the idea of getting along with people that are different than them
Unless you're a contractor supplying the weapons or something, of course
Wars are FUCKING. EXPENSIVE
and money
<@!102691114762371072> but....but that's cannibalism <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
Another example of giant ego leading to bad decisions. Rich people burning thousands of dollars just to piss off the less fortunate
Rich people burn money all the time just to piss poor people off
although that system still has drawbacks of its own
That's why I like the idea of 4-year terms
There's no one I can trust with that sort of thing that isn't someone who would be ok with my trying it
If I'm gonna get high, I wanna be able to do it without risking my brain
I don't know what it would do to my brain, and I don't want to take the risk without some form of "undo"
how many ^^^^^^^ can I put in before I break discord? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Drugs laws punish people with the harshest sentences over the smallest, stupidest BS
All without me telling my LDS mom "oh BTW I commited a huge sin that your religion hates today"
and go to jail for a long time
Like, if I bought some meth today, then later on my Mom took me out to dinner and we got pulled over, she'd go to jail
You can go to jail just be being around someone with drugs in their pocket, even if you have no knowledge of anything drug-related going on
other than how ridiculous the punishments tend to be
I know next to nothing about drug laws
Since you can't do anything about the nukes, might as well live your life as best you can meanwhile
I don't know about dunkek, but there's plenty of shit to worry about in my own personal life. Worrying about world-ending events I can do nothing about regardless is just a waste of mental health I don't have
and the draft ain't gonna do shit to stop that, so no point really worrying about it
Like, the war they implement the draft for is the war that ends in 30 minutes because we all launched our nukes at each other
Not really. By the time things get that bad, it'll be the end of the world regardless
I'd rather die happy next year than live for eternity worrying about all the bad stuff that's going to happen
Just because you're going to die in the future, doesn't mean you should fuck your life up meanwhile
getting a prosthetic is only going to make your life worse, and do nothing to stop it from ending.
but it's not gonna stop until said war happens
I don't like how we keep inching closer and closer to nuclear war
And in that case, literally everyone is cannon fodder, because humanity is gonna go extinct
They'd draft if/when it escalates well beyond Iran
any amount of second hand smoke, and you've hurt people around you
or hell, jsut lighting it up and then *immediately* putting it out
Smoking hurts everyone around you literally every time you light it up, even if you only smoke for like, 0.5 seconds and then put it out
on top of that, weed doesn't really hurt everyone around you, unless you use too much of it
cigs don't cure or treat shit
cigarettes cannot
weed can be used for medicine
and I'm glad
Yes it is
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~I drink soda~~
If we're gonna make weed illegal, we need to make cigs illegal too. Cigs are far more dangerous, and they affect everyone around you while you're smoking
I'm not gonna go into full on college frat mode the second I step into a bar
nor do I mean drinking 20 cans of the stuff
and when I say alcohol I don't necessarily mean "beer"
one nice thing about living in a LDS community: not much second-hand smoke
I don't care about it killing me, to be perfectly frank
Like, if there's any chance whatsoever they won't stop me from taking "one more shot", they ain't who I'm drinking with for my first time
and any person I trust to go with me would be someone I can trust to hold me to that
I would probably only do one or two shots, at most
but *shrugs* it's not like I *have* to do it
and there's no one I can trust to be around me as I find out
I've wanted to try drinking alcohol for awhile, but I don't know how my body will react to it
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
~~and hope everyone forgets this convo~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so uh....I'mma just crawl into my hole and continue work on my fanfic now <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and that wasn't fucking it
Because I *do* know the definition of second hand smoke
yay me
Also, I just now realized how fucking stupid the "even lighting the cig and immediatly putting it out" thing is. Something I should've realized even with my misinformation
~~this is what I get for relying on what the people around me have taught~~
disregard everything I said in this current convo, I guess :B
that being said, off I go to write more
*shrugs* I guess I just shouldn't be talking about drugs and cigs at all
I legit did not know that
....weed produces second hand smoke?
if you're only ever focusing on the worst the city has to offer, you might as well not even bother looking to move at all
And frankly, you're never going to find a perfect city
sometimes you have to be in a shitty city to be around good people
I think everyone needs it to some degree or another
well that I can't do Dx
I'll do my best :B
and was more to fix it than it was worth fully repaired
then it got wrecked
I had a car
Dx
and expensive
I doubt it'll be a one-country war
~~and fucked up travel plans~~
unless, of course, we're talking about sociopaths who view themselves as gods
At the very least, I've yet to meet someone who isn't
I think literally everyone in existence is too hard on themselves
good luck, dess! <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Plenty of reasons to be scared of that in this world, unfortunately :\
but I don't really feel "female", either
I identified as just a "feminine male" for awhile, but I don't really feel like I"m necessarily "male"
like...within the past year recently
I haven't put too much thought into it until just recently
I'm not sure what my identity officially classifies as, tbh
no daily dess with Kiri-chan
awww
<@431656503490117632> Dess!
I prefer hugs, but headpats would be nice, too
unless they're patting a dog or cat or something
funny enough, I've literally never seen anyone headpat IRL
~~I ask for a hug and Saki gives me a headpat~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
WHO WANTS A HUG?! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which are still nice
well, outside of virtual hugs, anyway
I don't really get any hugs unless I'm giving a goodnight hug to my mother while sleeping over at her house
~~I need hugs!~~
and the LDS church doesn't like men like me
I don't think she'll be nice about it once she fully understands. She's very strongly LDS
Well, I've told her I'm feminine, but I don't think she knows just how far that goes
I still haven't come out to my mother, and I'm not sure I want to while I still live in the same city as her
~~stay away from Arizona. Got it~~
Anyone happen to be in UT? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
There were kimonons at the convention I try to go to every year, though
problem is right now I'm too goddamned fat to fit in anything
God, I wish I had an opportunity to try one
not 100%, of course, but a lot of it was *very* similar
I remember a youtuber did a video about her journey to transitioning, and I felt a lot of the same kind of stuff she did
~~which'll take awhile to happen regardless because those clothes are fucking expensive~~
I have no problem letting people know how feminine I am, but I'm afraid of how people will judge me when I start wearing dresses and kimonos
I'm not really scared about "coming out", per se. But I am kinda scared to start wearing the clothes I wanna wear
it isn't
(I'm pretty weak myself) :B
All that does is validate their fear
Well don't do that again D:
VERY afraid
Chris probably isn't the right girl for me, and I'm probalby not the right guy for Chris
but I don't know if I'd necessarily want to be "dating" her
Going on a date with Chris would be fun
I don't think we're really talking about "transcend" or "transhuman", though
~~yet~~
though not quite as dependent on just one person
I think I most identify with Shirabe, as far as Symphogear characters go.
I have a very basic understanding of the term
To be perfectly honest, I"m not even 100% sure what all "trans" even means
part of the reason I'm still discovering myself is because I'm not familiar with everything enough to know if it's "me" or not
I'm still unfamiliar with a lot of all this
well I don't know the right language
or maybe it won't
so maybe it will be "right" for me in the future
but I'm also still discovering myself
I've kinda considered becoming trans before, but I don't really feel like it's "right" for me
that explains why I can't self-insert either despite not really being trans
If I ever become a big youtuber, my catchline will probably be "#bestwaifu" or something xP
So basically, they were just watching it to jerk off
and *only* for waifu reasons
but they usually liked it for waifu reasons
And like there were guys who liked some of those shows too
and other "girly" shows
I actually enjoyed watching Sailor Moon on the rare occasion I got to
Same here
I think I would've discovered my feminine side without the internet, but I would've had to keep it closeted  forever without the internet
there's the dess xD
(hey! it works!
||helping kill 70k is a good reason for Fudou to get punched||
but yeah
~~I forgot how to spoiler too :B~~
||**and already has**||
He's definitely planning on killing people
Fudou's gonna end up getting punched
*anyone*
I don't believe anyone is 100% incapable of change
Are you thinking less of me because I want to try love?
Just because I disagree doesn't mean I think less of you
I'm not looking down on you
if they start trying to kill you, then yeah, beat the shit out of them
I'm saying punching peole for the sake of punching people isn't the answer
I'm not saying stay silent
is it worht it to create even more prejudice against your trans siblings?
is it worth it to convince other people to join the nazi?
is it worth it for other people to see that the nazi wasn't the bad guy?
is it worth it to give other people a reason to hate you?
is it worth it to give that nazi more reason to be nazi?
but if you beat them up simply for saying "I'm a nazi", you're just feeding into to their hate and proving them "right"
if they hold a gun to you or something, sure
Solving hate with hate only creates more hate
You shouldn't be punching *anyone* for their beliefs, no matter how hateful they are
resolving hate with hate only leads to more hate
heh
like, how to set up my character and start with other people and whatnot
I've thought about doing an RP blog on tumblr, but I have no idea how RP on tumblr really works
~~someone RP symphogear with me, damnit!~~
although there is a few Symphogear-related accounts I follow as well
I mostly follow youtubers on twitter <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
which is ironic for me to say considering I dislike mountains <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
MST is **BEST**ST
~~sometimes I forget 12 is when am/pm changes, too~~
and it's kinda nice, since it's late enough that I probably won't sleep through it, but early enough that I'm not waiting around all day
3PM is later, so
12pm for me <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
let alone anime like Symphogear
it's hard to find someone in Idaho Falls who likes anime at all
same Dx
just pointing it out <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
not upset
Also, you don't really need to ping me when I'm already here <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it's funny that the generation that told us to not believe everything we read on the internet is beleiving everything they read on the internet
*totally* legit
but infowars is "entertainment" and he's "just playing a character"!
it shouldn't be working well enough to offset all the dead virgins
even with their propaganda
but if they're all dying out, the population of nazis in the world should be shrinking
If that's true, where are the new nazis coming from?
got it
right
Do we need a Hibiki?
Or I could do Hibiki, if we really need her
~~we need more Shirabe emotes~~
incoming Shirabe!
alright, so between us we now have 3 RP accounts
~~dibs on Shirabe~~
~~you at least have one right here~~
I see
do you use tumblr?
Where do you rp? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
that's where a lot of our problems as a society come from, IMO.
Sadly, too many fail to put themselves through the same rigor
fortunately I haven't come across too many in this server so far
those people are annoying <_<
At least you're acknowledging the mistake. I know plenty of people who would continue to insist they read it right and everyone else is the one reading it wrong
eh....it happens sometimes
I'm pretty sure tehy would take into account the margin of error
If we think it's gonna hit on the right, we won't be pushing it towards the left
true, but I imagine we'd be able to at least figure out which direction is further away from Earth
It would go from a near miss to a total miss
We wouldn't be stupid enough to divert it closer to earth
~~Divert them all into the sun~~
even a simple "divert it off course" has issues.
~~and crash into our moon instead~~
and you're not gonna make any further progress by whining about how little was made
you're not gonna change all of society overnight
A start is a start
People are excited because it's at least a "foot in the door"
<@!263983345669505025> They've elected an openly gay government official and.....that's about it so far. Time will tell what actually comes from this
This isn't the channel for making jokes
especially in a place like <#336297840529899522>
*Always*
*Always* think before you speak
This isn't your personal echo chamber
if you're gonna post your thoughts on a public discord, people have every right to criticize them
almost $8.8 million USD in donations. KyoAni touched a lot of lives.

I don't think I like that
....that's fucked up....
I don't really consider "individual spiritualism" to be the same as "religion"
It is. I still typed i out
Worry about all the anti-homosexual groups. Not just the one that's a big deal in someone else's country
focusing on just one enemy that isn't even a huge influence in your country isn't going to help you against the opposition you're ignoring that *is* influential.
and as Kerrik said...there are non-christians that also hate homosexuals
but I don't think it has a particularly large influence in Japan
in some
The christian church isn't everything, you know....
They got a foot in the door. Now they work on the other foot.
~~why do you think we have so many alien invasion movies?~~
Although I do still try and help people out every now and then
Honestly, I've gotten so sick of being taken advantage of, I'm at point in my life where I"m just like "Fuck it, selfish asshole time"
SO MUCH YES
YES
Well if that's the case, I would've liked it if he prefaced his article as such for new readers not familiar
that story sounds awesome
wait, where did he tame dragons? I wanna fucking read that story
Jesus was 100% radical left
I agree with the point he's trying to make, but goddamn does he do a terrible job of making that point
Like....was he even going for satire at all? Because I don't think he was going for satire at all. I think he's just legit an idiot who's full of himself.
Sure, but making some idiotic interpretation just to "prove how stupid it is" without actually writing a satire article just makes you out to be an dumbass
That would be an interesting religion, at the very least
^
There are plenty of ways to show how messy the book is without purposefully misinterpreting it. Purposefully misreading it just makes you sound like an idiot that doesn't know what they're talking about
two wrongs don't make a right
Ok  sure, but that doesn't make it ok to do it yourself
Like, I don't get the "other gods are real" implication from those verses at all.
That article sounds more like a purposeful misinterpretation of the biblical text than an actual study of said text. "I hate religion, so lemme twist these words the way I want to make the church look bad".
I sure walked in at a fun time <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~both~~
dreams don't follow logic
And, in fact, usually just ends up encouraging them to piss you off even more
Well, I could always yell at people too, I guess, but that's usually not as helpful as you think it'll be
I don't really have any outlets to unleash my rage except sleep and imagination
I also sleep it off a lot
although nowadays it's mostly internal
I do a lot of crying myself
Then think stuff :D
other than being boring <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
but I don't know if it's necessarily a problem, either
I....don't think so?
There's basically one one member of my family that ever really loved me, and she's dead <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I haven't had to cut my mother out yet, but it's a pretty weak relationship atm and once I start embracing my femininity more and start wearing dresses and such.....that'll probably be the breaking point.
It's not a fun feeling :<
Especially with this being the point in my life where I've needed him the most
Right now I'm most likely going to have to cut my father out of my life, and that's not a fun thing to deal with
One of the main reasons I don't have many relationships is because I'm always the one doing all the work, and eventually I get fed up with being used
Friendships, dating, marriage, parenthood, even employer/employee
Every human relationship requires work
"true love" isn't the magical cure romance media makes it out to be. Your life isn't going to be magically perfect just because you found "the one". You're still going to have arguments. You're still going to have fights. You're still going to have to work hard with it.
this is coming from a super emotional guy, btw
your feelings are not a valid justification for being an asshole
two wrongs do *not* make a right
one person being an asshole to you does not justify you being an asshole back
I didn't realize I had to specify armed attacks in a conversation revolving around armed attacks
I wouldn't use the same techniques against an unarmed aggresor that I would an armed one.
The law is pretty fucked up if it says you can't use martial arts on someone who's pointing a loaded gun at your head
If the shooter's on the other side of the room, martial arts probably won't help you much unless you can find a way to close the distance
not EVERY mugging/robbery happens at close range
Of course, there's one very obvious drawback
And a lot of muggings/robberies happen at melee range anyway
Learning martial arts is arguably the best self-defense. Discipline is part of the teaching, most will also teach you how to *disarm* an opponent, and it's hard to take away your weapon when your body is the weapon.
And the fact that I *did* specifically mention an armed attack in the last piece of that info dump of mine should've been a pretty good indication that I was talking about armed attacks the whole time
I didn't specifically mention an armed attacker in my first sentence because I was continuing a discussion about defense against armed attacks
No, you were starting a pointless argument over a ridiculous schematic
I mean, it's pretty shitty to refuse to listen to the other side at all so....
No one's trying to "win" the argument, unless you are
it's a matter of Saki not wanting to waste her time
It's not a matter of Saki "not wanting to lose"
Naraa isn't even in this convo, so I don't know why you're trying to use their words to justify your argument
and even then, you'll probably still have rebellions
at least until someone owns all of it
And there will always be a desire for more territory
human lives are too worthless for that <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
We're America!
and we can't *possibly* be the bad guys
nononono. If I admitted that, that would make us the bad guys <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
one reason why we're trying to improve diplomatic relations with them
and the US would likely get dragged into it
actually firing at a country would almost for sure start a war
N. Korea, for now at least, is just trying to prove they *can* attack other countries
not at the US, no
I'll believe North Korea wants a diplomatic solution when they stop actively fighting against a diplomatic solution
Actions speak louder than words.
Ironically, pretty much everyone knows this, but somehow still think prefacing your sentence will make it ok
there, that's a bit better
ok, thank you discord formatting for ruining that sentence
If someone starts a sentence with "not to be  [         ]",  there's a 100% chance they actually are [        ],  but don't want to get called out on it.
Glad the police jumped in before the guy actually tried anything
Oh "good". People are trying to copy the arson guy now.
Don't ask questions you don't want answered
If you didn't want an answer, why did you ask?
I participated, but I never started it
I'm not the one who started the discussion
Ok, then why yell at *me*?
and instead yell at me for not understanding?
And then refuse to even tell me what I'm even doing wrong?
why attack *me* and leave everyone else alone?
so again
So was everyone else
So....why attack *me* over that? I wasn't the only one in the discussion, and I wasn't even calling it pandering to begin with?
I can't atone for my sins if I don't even know what my sins are
Why are you upset? What did I do wrong? What should I be changing about my behaviour?
simply pointing and saying "you're missing the point" doesn't help me see the point
Saki, please spell it out for me
nor was I saying they shouldn't?
Um.....I wasn't attacking them for featuring trans in a positive light?
I'm not trying to be an asshole here, I'm just legitimately confused. :\
because I have no idea WTF you're offended by
So....you're gonna have to spell it out for me
Well I have Asperger's, which means I can't read social cues very well
Should I be attacking the show for featuring a trans character?
Ok, but why are you offended by that?
I was never asking that. Only answering and saying "does it matter if it's pandering?"
and like I said, I don't think it is pandering. But even if it is, it doesn't hurt me
I don't have the context
I can't really comment on how well or how poorly the representation is
I feel like you're taking this too personally, Saki
Even if the pandering is overboard in it....so what? Doesn't really hurt me
especially over a show that I never had much interest in to begin with.
but *shrugs* I'm not just gonna blindly attack the show for it
of course, the clip is entirely out of context for a special I haven't seen, so it could be way worse than It seems
This pandering feels less like they're trying to cashgrab and more like they're trying to say something
If it's way too overboard, yes. If it's done tastefully (which, as far as I can tell, the clip is fairly tasteful), it's not really an issue
I mean, technically speaking, *everything* is pandering to *something*
Like most harem anime <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Pandering in general has a negative connotation, but I think it's only ever actually bad when it's done overboard
Eh, kinda yes kinda no
especially to transphobes
taking a clip out of context isn't really good proof for me. Any clip featuring a trans character taken out of context will seem like pandering
If it's pandering at all, it's pandering by Murray rather than Netlfix. And frankly, I'd need to see proof that is pandering before I'll believe it
With him being involved, he likely had to approve the change before it happened
Then I highly doubt this is "pandering"
Was the original creator involved? I didn't even know this special existed until now
only reason I was willing to give him a chance was because I had already worked with him before when he was a PSR worker.
It was a fucking miracle I gave my current therapist a chance with all those wrong therapists
more times than I care to count
many times
I have
especially with how many shitty therapists there are out there
Therapy isn't a be-all-end-all "works for everyone" magical cure
Those of us where therapy doesn't work?
and if that's a selfish thing to do....then be fucking selfish
It's not about being selfish or self-centered. it's about taking care of yourself
If therapy doesn't work, try medicine. If medicine doesn't work, try meditation. If meditation doesn't work, try art. If art doesn't work, etc etc etc
I would strongly recommend you look into ways to process your emotions in a healthier way
I mean, you shouldn't blindly lash out at everything either, but bottling up isn't healthy
bottling up is never a good idea D:
Just once I'd like to have a serious discussion without people screaming at me over one thing or another :\
I'm not sure I want another discussion of people yelling at me for wording things wrong or not reading social cues or whatthefuck ever right now
so yeah, I'mma pull the victim card
and trying to make me out to be some sort of bad guy
You're getting upset with me over....I don't even fucking know what
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
I haven't actually looked into any records on how much revenue the site earned, but I doubt they came anywhere close to making back their initial investment. With how cheap their letting the site go for, they might even be making a loss on the revenue now (again, I haven't looked into the records, so take my speculation with a grain of salt)
Even taking into account any profits they made off the site between then and now, that's still a substantial hit to your bottom line
Yahoo/Verizon's the one taking almost all the loss here. From $1.1 billion to almost nothing.
On the bright side, the new company only has $3 million to lose on this investment. A lot of money for us poor folks, but quite little actually in the business world
And now this new company is looking to keep that mistake going to the fucking grave.
Not only did they fuck up, but they refused to rescind their decision in any attempt to repair their fuck up
I saw that tweet as well. The fact that Yahoo promised to not fuck up makes this fuck up all the more hilarious
It'll be interesting to see how they plan to keep the platform afloat.
As if that's not fuck up enough, the porn ban was a large reason Tumblr fell so far to begin with, and this new company has said they're keeping the ban in place
They fucked up <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yahoo originally bought it for $1.1 billion
I'm reading tweets saying that the amount they're buying it for is less than $3 million
https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-to-sell-tumblr-to-wordpress-owner-11565640000
I don't, but I usually travel alone nowadays
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
money I don't have
travel costs money
I'm not either
Obviously Tokyo's out in that regard
I would like to use a Japanese bullet train....but I'm gonna have a hell of a time finding one that isn't too overcrowded <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~all the more reason to travel!~~
I keep forgetting monorails are trains too <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Well, a train that isn't a monorail, anyway
One day, I wanna ride a train just to see what it's like
It's easier to "think" when you view the whole world in black and white
And in the rare instances you get someone to see more of the spectrum, they still only see one other point. The **exact** center
those categories being "my idealogies" and "every evil scumbag piece of shit that *dares* to disagree"
They like to group things in only two categories
Humans have a hard time seeing any sort of spectrum, politics or otherwise
I'm glad they got said glass out
But man, does it fucking hurt when it happens
Nobody really expects a piece of glass to go flying into their eye, usually
very few authors actually bother to put any research into their heavy subjects, even when they are trying to say something meaningful
I mean, try sure, but make sure you've done everything you can to learn all you need to learn before you try
the problem with that is you can actually do a fair amount of harm if you fuck it up.
if you don't know how to properly handle a heavy subject, you probably shouldn't try at all
not sure I wanna try reading the manga
"joy"
which means we never fucking will <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
but still, no mass shootings in Idaho
and frankly, it makes me uncomfortable
I've seen people carry guns around in Idaho a few times
And being Idahoan myself....I think I would fucking hear about a mass shooting in Idaho
and I don't recall any Idahoan mass shootings
Idaho also has quite a few gun nuts
I often hear people talking about Texas being a "gun nut" state and claiming that as the reason for all the mass shootings, but I question that
'cause I'm not convinced it's even possilbe to have a location on Earth with human beings and literally zero major issues
you can make that argument, Melua, but you'd better have a pretty convincing argument
exactly
In fact, that isn't actually love at all. That's nationalism
Loving the place you live doesn't necessarily require you to claim it as flawless
any state in any part of the world
Name me one state that *doesn't*
like, where can you even find tolerance if you're despised even in your own community?
even other autists hate autists
so common, yet we still all hate each other for it :\
indifference, then?
They're the ones that deserve it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Instead of hating yourself, try hating them <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"lol, who cares? let our kids deal with it"
anger and fear are both *very* powerful motivators
or both
or pissed
it's really easy to get people to agree to stuff when they're afraid
too overwhelmed by my own country's bullshit to be worrying about everyone else's
and.....that's about it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
some friends of mine live in Europe
I...don't think that's necessarily a good idea either, tbh
I think we fucked up a *lot*
I think we fucked up
:|
hair that the hats cover
Like, I have some really awesome hats I want people to see, but I also want to show off my beautiful hair
I like to wear hats, but also don't like wearing them <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
especially the way I tend to wear them
but hats don't always hide the eyes
that does make sense to me, tbh
nobody gives me rude glances, and nobody else takes *their* hats off
meanwhile, literally no one else cares
My mother is so overreactive with it, she even wants me to take off my hat while we're sitting down eating food at a resteraunt
To this day, literally no one has been able to give me a proper reason for why wearing a hat is disrespectful.
actually, I don't really hear too much about other states in general here in Idaho
but that could just be because I hear about it mostly from the South
I think the South hates the North more than the North hates the South
either that, or just kick said rebels out
ethics aside
I mean, that kinda is how you preserve a union when there are rebels
it was whites who thought slavery is bad vs whites who thought slavery is ok
like, 99% of the human population seem to think the brain is just there for interior decoration or something :\
which is really where 90% of our problems come from
most people would rather let someone else think for them
humans are lazy
"racism" is also often used when discriminating against religions
although I think that's largely from being too lazy to use another term for it
and from the way I've seen the term used, "racism" is also used when discriminating against people from a certain country
you're judging an entire group based off of what country they live in
You say you don't like reducing every issue to racism....but then you proceed to be racist
so.....not really the best wording
and now Americans
I mean, that wording makes it sound like you're being racist towards Russians
and numerous other factors
and the love of attention
including fear of the unknown
well, it's multiple factors
drama is more exciting than "everything is fine and wonderful and nothing has happened!"
humans like drama
Kurwa being?
remind me to literally never try to learn Polish <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
...
~~and even then, I still make quite a few mistakes in English~~
so I highly doubt I"m very good with Polish grammar, unless it happens to be the same as English <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I know literally *nothing* about the Polish language
I tend not to care too much about grammar, so long as I understand what you're trying to say
partly because of my autism, but also partly because of how fucked up English is as a language
I struggle with it too
and yeah, I don't necessarily blame you for struggling with wording
is probably still not 100% perfect, but closer
"Wasn't Thou singular?"
in which case the wording you used is a little confusing
unless you were talking about how people used to say it, but now don't
"used to be singular" implies it is now plural, dess
I haven't ever seen anyone use it as plural form
....when has thou ever been plural?
~~let's get rid of all gender pronouns!~~
like, a state or two Westward, I think
Idaho is pretty close to being right above Texas, though
pretty far
so
and Idaho borders Canada
Texas borders Mexico
well
uh
I never hear them say "yee haw"
but even when I come across someone from Texas
mind you, I'm in Idaho
I too, have literally never heard anyone use that term ever
and yeah, cowboy movies are really where the "yee haw" comes from
other than Utah and California
fan base makes noise about it, he takes a look and finds out that they did, in fact, bad mouth him once, decides "screw you"
in fact, that's probably the biggest reason right there
I think another big reason he's pulling back from the ADL is the fact that they called him out once
assuming he is being genuine at all, of course
He really needs to hire a new team that can do a better job managing this stuff for him, or he'll *never* separate himself from it no matter how genuinely he tries
honestly? you're probably right Mel
like, *really* poor
I think Pewds is genuinenly trying to seperate himself from right-wingers, but is doing a poor job at it
I haven't looked into it much myself, but I didn't see anything immediately obvious about it
And honestly? I do think “I made the mistake of picking a charity that I was advised to instead of picking a charity that I’m personally passionate about,” is a valid excuse, but I also feel like the only reason he's questioning the ADL is because the Nazis are screaming about it
and is allegedly looking at another charity to donate it to instead
It doesn't look 100% like the iron cross, but it looks pretty similar
I'm sorry, but that is unreasonalbe
fuck that
NO
and I never wanted them watching me
It's not my fault that kids are watching me
why should I be forced to start playing "Elmo's Alphabet Adventure" from then on?
and then kids start watching me
if I'm doing let's plays of rated M anime games, and making all sorts of adult jokes
Fine
if your content is never meant to be for kids, you shouldn't be forced to make kid content just because kids are watching withtout their parents doing anything about it
"hey, a bunch of 8 year olds found your porn videos, so you should start dressing everyone"
I'm gonna be real with you Mel, that sounds like censoring
hence why it's called "**parent**ing" to begin with
They can all help, but ultimately the job of parenting is the PARENTS responsibility
not society
not church priests
not youtubers
not teachers
Parents are responsible for their kids
^^^
Like, if I'm making a show aimed at teens, but my content is mostly watched by 8 year olds, I shouldn't be **forced** to change what I make to appease to the audience I never wanted to begin with
that's far more on the parents than it is the youtubers making the content
and frankly, youth shouldn't have been watching that content to begin with
I mean, a lot of them also start with adult humor
Just because someone says a really offensive thing, doesn't necessarily mean they're malicious
and what's obviously really offensive to most people, may still not be really obvious to others
I mean, when your ENTIRE INCOME relies on clicks, you kinda *have* to "keep clicks rolling"
<@!263983345669505025>  <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
whether they're assholes or not
Humans make mistakes
even with editing being a thing that exists
no one is perfect, Kerrik
all it takes is *one* slip up in a video
even then, you're not gonna be 100% immune
You can do a lot of good in Pewds position, but you can also do a lot of harm.
Ideally, I'd like to be big enough to make a living off of what I do, but not so big that I'm a "household name"
I don't want to have to worry about this sort of thing
That's another reason I don't ever want to get super big
Me running around this server screaming about how the jews are all evil most likely won't actually influence someone here to go out and attack a Jewish business. Pewds doing the same on his channel, however, almost definitely will
and when you're influential, you *do*, in fact, need to be extra careful about what you say, and **especially** what you do
I mean, I do think Mel is being a little too harsh on him too, but we can't really ignore the reality that he is, in fact, *really* popular and influential
so why should only kids entertainment be allowed to exist?
and they need entertainment too
adults exist in this world too
especially ones like me that don't really want to censor themselves to appeal to kids
more youtubers in general
I wasn't even really talking about Pewds, tbh
I'm not saying we shouldn't do anything at all whatsoever to help parents out and take on some of the responsibility ourselves
you can't, Saki, nor did I ever say we should
PDP should be doing better
but yea
Because, again, parents are supposed to be parenting
Well yes, but I don't think he should be taking *all* the responsibility for it
and I don't usually go looking for drama, either.
I honestly don't know much about what PDP does/doesn't do with his videos since I have no interest in his videos and thus never watch them
and I will fully admit that he should
games that I may not really be ineterested in at all
especially since part of that requires also only playing certain kid friendly games
not really
still a bit reaching, IMO, but not really too hard to do
ok, that's much more reasonable
especially when you get as big as Pewds is?
like seriously? you think responding to literally every fan mail ever is reasonable?
ok, that's taking it too far, Mel
youtube, **especially nowadays** is not a good place for money making
but then again, I wouldn't really be making the videos to get rich and make a career out of youtube
I, personally, would be
no they aren't
no
like, I'm sorry, but is Ford responsible for your wreck just because you drove your truck too fast on icy roads, despite all the warnings not to do so?
Except I can, because it legitimately *isn't* my fault
if the kids are getting hurt by it, they're being hurt by their own actions, not mine
that, again, is not my responsibilty
but sometimes kids find a workaroudn and ignore that
I can mark my content as not suitable
and yes, there are steps I can take
I can't control other people, nor should I be expected to
you're the one offloading their job of parenting onto me
I'm not even offloading
not mine
it's still THEIR responsibility
but guess what?
it may not be easy for parents to DO THEIR JOBS AS PARENTS
nuclear bombs, my man
I highly doubt it
so
the Earth has been envoking it's wrath for literally it's entire existence
well actually
The Earth is gonna be fucking dead by the time it envokes it's wrath
I wasn't actually joking
I uh
the best part about being Libertarian is the Democrats think you're Republican and the Republicans think you're a Democrat
you can't be a bigot if you don't exist <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
the only way it'll be balanced is if humanity is wiped from existence
~~so the solution is to never communicate with anyone, ever~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's the "logic", anyway
those bigots aren't bigots because "we're right, so how can it be bigotry?!"
if it's a group, it has bigots and those bigots hate bigots except for the bigots in their own group
right wing/left wing/christian/muslim/negro/caucasain/japanese/indian/etc etc etc
99% of humans think that way, regardless of what group they belong too
I'm referring to humanity
I'm not referring to any specific group
their  own bigots are fine
but only the bigots in the *other* group
bigots hate bigots
everyone hates bigots
IMO
"bigotry" is a much better blanket term
and it is annoying
it's not, but it's still used that way
~~we had this discussion earlier~~
instead, we just blanket it under "racism"
sadly, "religist" isn't a word
it's when you dehumanize the African girls that it becomes a major problem
I wouldn't say that's necessary wrong, though. People have preferences, and you're allowed to have preferences
technically, something like thinking that Asian girls are sexier than Africans is racist
Everyone's at least a bit racist, but not everyone's *extremely* racist
**especially** if I"m 100% in denial
and I fully deserve to be called a racist in such a scenario, even if I'm 100% in denial
I can **think** I'm not being racist all I want, but if I go around joking about how african americans are all gangsters without exception, I'm being fucking racist
Well, that's still on them
My argument was **never** that youtubers are 100% blameless. Only that we're placing more fault on them than they actually deserve.
And if selling your intergrity is what's require to make a career out of it....then maybe you should consider other careers
and if you don't....well, even youtube having the best systems in the world can't stop your willingness to sell your integrity for a quick buck
it's largely on youtube for not having proper systems in place, but you should still use what *is* there
and you know what? I'll fully admit that's fucked up
And yeah, a lot of them don't because "money"
content creators can't use age restriction systems that aren't there
<@138380189741744128> and that's on youtube, not youtubers
plenty of things have existed LONG before we found proof
<@!217896572954869761> that's saying that if we can't prove it, it can't possibly exist, and that is objectively false
and technically, yes it is evidence, albeit not particularly strong evidence
it's not just conjectures, Mel
"plenty" is more accurate to the point I was making
and actually, "strong" is kind of the wrong word to use
strong, but not irrefutable
and keep in mind I never said irrefutable evidence
look into metaphysics
not a 100% confirmed fact
a belief
but in the end, it's just that
it's what most people *believe*
That's not necessarily true, dino
Like, there's some pretty strong evidence that an afterlife *does* exist
and frankly, you can't say for sure it's all pointless either
~~just China?~~
but not outright impossible
difficult, sure
not really
and now it's even more so
It was always highly unlikely
<@138380189741744128> I'm not saying it was feasible at one point, I'm saying it's even less so
it's actually pretty amazing to think about. All the technology we have in the modern world, and global domination is actually **far** less feasible today than it ever was in human history
nuclear deterrence
all because somebody else also has a button
but so far everyone has been sane enough to stay the fuck away from that button
we're always one button press away from the end of the world
that's the irony of nukes
and the fallout that will result from **global nuclear war** will be quite a large amount
nuclear fallout is....pretty fucking devastating even to the planet
and when we kill ourselves, we'll take the planet with us
and I assure you, the man-made one will be **far** worse
none were man-made
all of those mass extinctions were natural
God gives us trials to "test" us
A large part of mormon belief is that we're here as a "test"
especially after said snake got used to it
but God allegedly had a reason for making it impossilbe to not sin in that scenario
....actually, I forget the exact explanation
allegedly
free will
~~INCOMING TAMAMO NO MAE, BITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~
assuming you repent of said sins, of course
the atonement is for all sins we've commited in the past, all the sins we're commiting now, and all the sins we'll commit in the future
essentially, it's for every sin, not just "original" sin
yes they did
and yes
And while I do see how it could work, I'm gonna need to see some solid proof before I go preaching it as gospel
and that's why they needed that convenient excuse that's juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust possible enough
yup
though that doesn't necessarily mean I believe it
I can honestly see how Adam and Eve can fit in with evolution, actually
that's how they justify the whole "we've never found it" argument
Some of them legit believe that, FYI
~~just above the Earth's molten core!~~
~~it's underground!!~~
a lot of them I've recognized as being complete BS
but not all
Some
like, still an active member?
what do you mean?
uh
I'm pretty familiar with all their teachings and ideologies
<@!217896572954869761> if you ever want to know about mormons, talk to me. I've lived in a mormon community my whole life and grew up in the church
~~TAMAMO NO MAE, BITCHES!!!!!!!!!!~~
~~being God means I get to choose whatever body type I want, right?~~
though I wonder what kind of God I would be in the afterlife?
Man, that would be fun if that were literally true
~~you fools! I was secretly God all along!~~
Deism isn't a term I'm familiar with
ah
especially if he's the one that created said reality to begin with
like....if God exists I highly doubt he's just completely ignoring our reality
I mean they probably do, but we don't recognize it.
oh yeah, and Trivia games exist
Like, I'll probably never use all the information I looked up on all those symbols and such in Assassin's Creed, but I still had fun looking it up
I like to learn just to learn sometimes
y'know....since there were parts they didn't agree with
though our version also has the "Joseph Smith translations"
it's also the version the LDS churches uses <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
lol
he might even give you free weapons!
you place too much faith in heavenly government <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
2 months
bitch please
2 weeks?
Hey God, this person pissed me off. Can I murder him plzkthnx?
not a very fun community for folks like me <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
not all mormon, but most who aren't mormon are at least Christian
it's like....90% religious
but once you're a member DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE QUESTION ANYTHING EVER
like, they'll tolerate questions from people they're trying to convert
they *really* don't like you questioning anything, even if you're just a curious member who still fully believes everything and just wants to know more
it's nice to be able to call out the stupidity of the mormon religion without getting yelled at by said mormons
gotta cover up all the bad stuff!
of course, you won't hear about that in church history
I wouldn't doubt it, Mel
it doesn't tell the full story, but it's pretty truthful about how ridiculous the whole thing is
serously though, you ever see that South Park episode where Stan befriends a new mormon kid?
that's because it is
Mormons have some of the most interesting and most fucked up explanations for things
and that's where demons come from!
apart from the 1/3rd that never even came to Earth to begin with because they sided with Satan's plan and were cast out along with him
apparently, you could do things in heaven before coming to Earth to get punished with certain "special trials" when you're born
oh, and you should hear their excuse for all these "special tests"
for a long time, those folks weren't even allowed to hold the priesthood and receive priesthood blessing.
"You're a descendent of that dude that killed his brother literally millennia ago, so lol get fucked."
I don't know if they still teach it, but I know they used to believe people of darker skin (what's the proper term to use for those folks? I want to be able to discuss them properly without being offensive D:) had said darker skin because of Cain's curse.
like, even when I kind of sort of believed in the church, I thought that was pretty fucked up
"Don't worry! god will *totally* get rid of those feelings for you up in heaven and then you can be happy forever with your hetero family!"
then again, is it really that much better?
And very few Idaho mormons will even be *that* accepting
I can't wait until I can move to a place that's not Idaho or Utah Dx
oh, and follow all the super strict rules they have
but yeah if you don't want to just blindly do whatever the church leaders tell you to do and let them think for you, it's not the right religion for you
well....most churches aren't
It's not exactly a good church for the LGBTQ community
but if they don't like you enough and/or you commit a big sin, *clearly* it is 100% your own free agency and you're a monster from hell
if they like you enough and the sin isn't too big a deal, they'll see it as Satan's fault and forgive you
and actually, it depends on the sin and how much they like you
or at least, Idaho/Utah mormons
but that's now how most mormons actually judge others
Well, that's what the scriptures say
and yes, Idaho/Utah mormons are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY worse than everywhere else
I've been in Idaho since I was 5
You most definitely did, Mel
Ironically, it's supposed to help us "love the sinner, hate the sin"...but mormons still hate on the sinner
that's *totally* how it works, right?
So give Pewds a break, Melua! Clearly he was influenced by Satan and thus it's the devil's fault!
If something bad happens in the world, it's either Satan's fault, or that person who did it was influenced by Satan
which is hilarious consdiering he's "*totally* to blame for all evil"
I've seen that argument used way too many times in MMO forums
same "logic" behind "you're gay if you choose to play a female character in a game, and staring at her ass proves that you are, in fact, gay for men"
yeah well, when you *really* want to accuse someone of something truth be damned, you'll use any stretch of logic you can
not a particularly sound argument regardless
<@189158439316881408> my best guess is that it's something along the lines of "you're just drawing them as adults to justify fapping to children!". That's the closest thing to a logical explanation I can think of, anyway.
so uh....what's breadtube? ~~I'm gonna regret asking that, aren't I?~~
....do I dare ask?
only chance you have at being treated right by your employer is to go indie and be the damn employer
I love video games, but the video game industry is garbage
it's amazing they actually expect consumers to buy that shit
EA excuses are just......ugh
oh yeah, those EA excuses
so hard
they do
honestly? I feel like some companies actively encourage it
and by "kinda" I mean "extremely"
yeah...lootboxes are kinda predatory
but yeah, mostly religion
I don't remember
I dunno
or at least you were the one who posted the news story, I think?
wait, you were here for the youtubez I think
YOUTUBEZ
oh yeah
and uh
you missed RELIGION
it's always frustrating (at the very least) when someone acts like they know you better than you know yourself
yup
that....kinda sounds like a word that doesn't have a whole lot of polite usages
I see
this is my first time hearing that term
what's "egg"? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
so uh
which is...pretty fucked up
but of course, people can't possibly figure out how a male can wear female clothes <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
wearing a dress isn't the same as identifying as female
**especially** if you have *any* mental health issues whatsoever
very few places are
~~so basically, don't be a fucking asshole~~
~~how many payed attention?~~
not "different"
not "special"
we just want to be treated the same as everyone else
fun fact about Autists (and mental health issues in general, really)
well yeah
"meaning well" is a piss-poor excuse for attacking someone with mental health issues for not improving as fast as you think they should
I can 100% assure you they **absolutely** will
yes they will
yes
but there's only so much I can do
I have been my whole life
literally no one would have autism ever
otherwise the diagnosis wouldn't even exist at all.
you can't just ignore your disability and **magically** know how social interactions work
at all
like
As an autist I can tell you, that's **not** how mental health works
"Just read the situation like a normal person and pretend your disability doesn't exist! That's totally how mental health works!"
if only life were that easy :|
~~fuck my life Dx~~
and the end result is "we don't know wtf we're even yelling at each other about"
If I'm being brutally honest with myself here, I think a lot of our convos are you miscommunicating your ideas to me combined with me misreading everything
...I mispelled that so wrong
~~fuck my life~~
especially fun when trying to communicate with other autists who also can't communicate!
~~that's not how you presented it!~~ <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
society is not fun when you're "different" :|
yeah.....plenty of asshole teachers too
elementary kids are fucking assholes
ok, but like
one way or the other, you're going to be forced to face your faults, whether you want to or not
Think about running away is....you can't
but giving up and running away is **never** the solution
maybe you need a therapist. Maybe you need some good books. maybe there's a youtube video out there that can help you out
but not on your own.
And despite what you think, it *is* possible
It just mean there are aspects of yourself you need to work on.
you might annoy us, and we might even yell at you sometimes, but that doesn't necessarily mean we hate you
One more thing I will say, Dino. I don't hate. And I don't think anyone else here does, either
that sounds.....strangely ominous
"human damage accident"?
uhhh
let me pretend, damnit! <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
let me at least *pretend* there's hope, damnit! <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
yeaaaah...there's pretty much **no** chance of anything positive coming from this, unfortunately
this is probably just a ploy to try and get some sort of boost from Trump haters for the upcoming election season
It's *never* going to actually happen
it's not gonna actually happen.
The dems were "super duper serious!!!" about impeachment near the beginning of his term too, and probably several times since.
Even if they're 100% serious and actually legit go through with everything, by the time the process even completes someone else will have already been elected anyway.
especially this close to the 2020 elections
literally nothing will come of it
though if someone wants to offer me free food just for being disabled, I'm still gonna take it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
just "human, like you are"
I'm so used to friends just randomly deciding to unfriend me, I've all but given up on ever actually finding any friendships that last <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
~~please halp~~ <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
can't wait
very lovely
oh yes
I don't know much about politics outside the US, but **this week** sounds completely unrealistic, regardless of how serious they are about it
I went through that garbage about a decade ago, and my Aunt just recently got through it herself
So in the end, it ends up costing both the government and the beneficiary more money.
and of course, a lawyer will take a cut of that backpay
except you won't get all of it, because most people need to hire a lawyer to help with the process
And then if you **do** appeal, they end up owing you backpay for all the money you *should've* received from the beginning
Here in the US, they try to reduce costs by denying a large majority (I heard about 90%) of claims hoping you won't appeal so they don't actually have to give you Social Security
I know nothing about the DWP apart from what was just said about it in this thread, though, so I can't really say how the UK system compares to the US system other than "they're both shit"
We do have a "department of Health and Welfare" that does a lot of this, and social security does a lot of it as well
It's pretty bad here in the US as well, but we don't have any "DWP"
depression comes in more than one form, and more than one intensity
In fact, I'm pretty sure *most* people who are depressed aren't actually suicidal
You don't have to be suicidal to be depressed
so again....it's just a constant reminder of how useless I actually am to the world
or even really go out much
except I don't drive
So instead I just get to sit there and feel like a fucking asshole <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I get told about this evil thing in the world that's happening like as if they're expecting me to do something about it, but I'm not in any position to actually do something about it
So I"m just sitting here like "How tf am I supposed to help out?"
I actually hate when I get amber alerts, because they're always for alerts in the Boise area, which is the opposite side of the state from me.
though I will agree their reaction was over-the-top
Again, time and place
I"m not just gonna take PR's word for it
they *claim* China money didn't factor into their decision....but I question that
Again though...I question if that's actually Blizzard's intentions with this at all
it's extremely stressful and unhealthy to have to worry about everything 24/7
like, they're important issues to discuss, but htere's a time and place for everything, and I really don't like it when people think they need to shove these issues into literally everything ever
I just want to watch some damn sports
When I watch a Sports broadcast, I don't want to have to listen to political/social issues
While I question if that's actually what Blizzard's intentions were, I have to agree with the statement.
honestly, we would have a perfect utopian planet if perfect utopias were the most profitable business model
building a community of players to give them money
ok, maybe "at all" wasn't the right terminology
gotta get dem chinese moneyz
I doubt blizzard actually cares at all about "building a diverse and inclusive community"
although I'm 90% certain it was due to the backlash
they did reduce it
**was** being the keywords there
6 months is too severe a punishment for it
It was, indeed poorly handled
Shoving social issues down everyone's throats at every opportunity you get isn't going to get you the "peace on this god awful planet" you want. All it's gonna do is piss people off and alienate people who might've otherwise listened to you.
you guys *do* realize there are other outlets for voices to be heard outside of sports and esports matches, right?
"pride of our country". Oh boy
I'm sure at some point there will be some form of controversy on the other side of all this. We'll see how serious Blizzard is about being "unbiased" when that time comes
I have a hard time believing this "our decision was totally unaffected by our China friends" BS
I'm betting Blizzard would just causally slap them with a one month suspension for that, at most
It's good PR, but would you **really** have overreacted the same way if it were a player praising China?
"If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same." <--------- this part of the statement in particular I have high doubts with
and I *do* still have my doubts about their backpedaling here
Not too many people are gonna buy your product if they don't even know it exists
Isn't **every** character in fate made for the sake of one fetish or another?
~~that's why I only ever play offline singleplayer~~ <:Cag:423197445644615711>
yes
"objectively" is a pretty strong term that I don't think you can actually legitimately prove
States literally get charged a big fee if they don't arrest enough people to fill the cells
Privatized Jails are absolutely horrendous because privatized jails are businesses that make money by arresting more "criminals"
Best part? Even if you *do* objectively prove there will never be a positive, unexpected development in the future, you still haven't proven you're **objectively** worthless
Even if you plan for a specific type of success, and obtain that exact success, it's almost guaranteed you won't get it exactly the way you think you will.
Fun fact: the future almost **never** works out the way you expect it to
"Uh huh, sure. Nice fantasy world you live in there, buddy"
If you went back in time to right after his very first video upload and told PewDiePie he would one day be making millions posting videos like that, he would 100% roll his eyes and scoff at you.
**nobody**
Nobody who posted Let's Plays on youtube back when it was a "no name" site thought they were gonna do those Let's Plays as a career.
I 100% guarantee there are skills you have that you don't realize you have. And even if there's no job for those skills now, you can't guarantee there won't be new jobs in the future that do
at best, you can only prove **subjective**, and even then I'm not gonna buy it that easily
If you can't prove there will literally never be an unexpected miraculous development in the future, you cannont prove you are **objectively** worthless as a living person
Everyone memes when The Simpsons is right. Nobody memes when The Simpsons is wrong.
Simpsons has actually predicted a lot of the future accurately, but it also fucked up a lot of predictions. You don't hear about those times, though, because those aren't memeworthy
even "experts"
People fuck up predictions all the time
and if you say you can do that, I'm gonna call major bullshit
also, in order to **objectively** prove you are 100% worthless alive, you'd have to **objectively** prove that the future will literally never change in a way you're not expecting
even if we don't chat much, and don't always agree when we do
one more person to talk to
and again, "objective" isn't even the right term to begin with
yes I do
probably shoudl be asked in <#336297387863703552> if it's just homework questions <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I know a few Katakana, but haven't practiced very much
I can't even imagine what it must be like to deal with that bullshit on a daily basis <_<
which is fortunate, quite frankly, because the times I **do** hear it from them it pisses me off and I hate it
I live around some pretty anti-trans people, but they almost never talk about trans people either so I honestly don't hear too much of the anti-trans language
I'm still pretty damn new to the world of trans and trans rights, so there's still a lot I don't understand about what's offensive and why
I'm not upset at you at all myself. I understand people come from different walks of life and may not have the same experiences with certain terms as others
I've yet to ever see the term used in any sort of positive light
don't use it at all
mostly because of those "traps are gay" memes. The term just become so cringe to me that just.....ugh
Even before I knew how offensive of a term it was, I never liked the word "trap" at all
and I hate how common such memes are
I've **never** been a fan of "hUrR DUrr TrAps ARe GaY lololololololololololol"
the funniest ones I've seen still only manage a chuckle out of me, at best. Mostly they just fucking annoy me.
memes involving Astolfo are almost exclusively derogatory
If it's anything like 90% of the other Astolfo memes I've seen, it's a meme that was either calling Astolfo gay for wearing female clothing (and being a "trap"), or calling people who like Astolfo gay because "you know he's a dude, right? lololololololololololol"
see if you can stay around other people so there's always witnesses, for example
so.....take some steps to protect yourself
and even if they decide to beat you up, I can almost guarantee they're not gonna outright kill you as you seem to worry
I mean, if they're as set on the notion as your paranoia tells you they are, they're not gonna give up on it just because you skipped a single day of school
because you did the **right thing** and reported them?
why feel bad for **them** threatening you?
I see too many waifu wars here. It's almost always done tongue-in-cheek at least, but it's a conversation I don't want to happen at all
and it's kind of annoying when you can't even talk about waifus at all without it devolving into a waifu war, either as a joke or as a serious flame war
Waifu wars are so annoying to me, I don't even like doing them as a joke <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
and I'm doing a fairly good job of not getting upset myself if someone disagrees with me (though I'm still not near as good at that as I'd like to be)
which I'm extremely grateful for
this server is admittedly much kinder than other places I've been in, and I *do* manage to get some civil discussions here
*most* times
not jsut "sometimes"
but it still finds a way to blow the fuck up in my face
I try that too
No I dont', saki
pretty much every discussion I've seen where two people were on opposite sides of the spectrum they've basically tried to verbally kill each other
your experiences are very different from mine, then
civil discussion is pretty much impossible unless you both agree with each other at least 90%
Everything is "us vs them"
well we live in a world of extremes nowadays.
and then you're left with two options: Lash out, or suicide
eventually you're gonna break
being an empath is just straight up impossible in this fucked up world <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
so either I turn into the monster everyone seems to view me as being, or I turn into a living doll
which....isn't really a very good option for me, either
but the only alternative I can see is to just become a doormat and let everyone else abuse me
"Narcissist with a savior complex are *dangerious*" 

and that's one of my more recent reasons for being suicidal. I can see myself slowly turning into that very monster, and I don't like it.
you don't have to be full of yourself to hate others
lots of incels are narcissists, but there's also lots of incels that don't necessarily fit that label
^
even the kindest, most loving group of people you could possibly meet has at least one narcissist
literally every group in existence has narcissists. Not just the hate groups
incels are pretty narcissistic, but it's **far** from a trait that's exclusive to just that group
And while it's rare, it is still *very* possible to be a narcissist even while being willing to challenge your own beliefs
having that inherent bias can feed into narcissism, but it isn't narcissim in and of itself
including the ones that supposedly hate narcissists.
Can't really be surprised by it, though. Pretty much everyone's a narcissist on the internet
TFW when that list solo posted describes 99% of your relationships <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
and that's a scary amount of anonymity for anyone to have
Like, I could just straight up blow up on everyone, shout the most offensive things posssilbe, get banned, then create an entirely new account and rejoin and no one would be the wiser to it
anonymity is indeed powerful
^^^
far easier to be an asshole to someone when you can't even see them
well yeah, but it's *especially* exxageratted on the internet
<@238855496797257729> and that's the biggest problem with the internet
This server is one of **very** few places where I see actual, legitimate, civil discussion
hence my "90%" statement
yeah well, I've been aroudn a LOT of people who think their way is the only possible way
literally been fighting for 2 years to get these services
took way too fucking long to happen <_<
I'm hoping I can finally get at least *some* progress with it
Well, one more month and I"ll finally have more services coming in to help teach me life skills and how to handle my mental illness
Saki needed space, like we all do at some time or another
I've tried that before, but it still doesn't work
and the other person ends up with the exact same false viewpoint of what I'm trying to say
even when I clarify, that clarification is as woefully misinterpreted as my original statement
I'm apparently quite fucking terrible at describing my emotions to others
Clarification is nearly impossible for me
and it's not like it's hate speech or something much more serious like that
of course, it's not my place to police it
hahahhaha, no
and bug her to go out to eat with me like she promised <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
time to call my mom
oh shoot, it's 3:30
actually, that toy was the main reason I was so thrilled to randomly see your Veemon emote
I know what character he is, at least
the Veemon toy thing I have and don't remember what it's called <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
and now not knowing the name for it is bothering me <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and has a clock thing on his Digivice
I forget what exactly the toy was called, but he's the kind of toy that can move his eyes and talk
I never use him, but he's sitting there up on my bookshelf with all my plushies
<@238855496797257729> I literally went out of my way to buy a Veemon toy because of how much I lvoed it in my childhood
God, I haven't watched anything Digimon in so long
VEEMON
I never ask what people's opinions of me are because I'd rather not hear it <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
^
the only way I could get away with making an alt account and not have anyone know it's me is to never say anything on said alt account and just use it to lurk instead <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~I'd like to think I'm perfect, but in reality no I'm fucking not~~ <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
even if sometimes that moderation is directed towards me <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I also **really** appreciate the work you do moderating this server
one of the reasons I fought so hard for so long to get the services
<@!99695384296701952> I'm doing my best to learn how to control my emotions so I never blow up to such an extreme measure
especailly if you do nothing to control it
anger is a very powerful emotion
and emotions aren't very logical most the time
we're emotional beings
humans aren't logical beings
humans also do things for no reason whatsoever
and sometimes....there is literally no purpose
a good portion of what humans do they do because of their egos
Ego, I guess?
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
that I'm also making her pay for <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
that sounds like a pretty lousy birthday present <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
....have her pay for her own birthday present?
too expensive
the bright side to all this is 3rd party candidates are seeing more and more support as time goes on
....I think I talked too much :B
God, I am NOT looking forward to the 2020 elections <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
but chances are everything will stay in the shadows and Trump will get away with it all
It **MIGHT** happen
**POSSIBLY**
**MAYBE**
the only actual benefit the American people can get out of a successful impeachment is **maybe** Trump will get tried in court for the crimes brought to light by the process
They don't want Pence any more than they want Trump, but as long as everyone says "fuck trump" and votes Democrat, it doesn't really matter whether the impeachment is successful or not.
The end result (at least what they're hoping for) is a Democrat in office
Who cares that impeachment fails if they're the ones that win the election?
I highly doubt this is anything but a ploy from the Democrats to try and draw support
they're not hoping to get rid of Trump through impeachment, they're hoping to get rid of Trump through getting their own guys in office next term
in fact, I doubt they're even serious about the impeachment at all. This close to election season? They're not doing it to impeach Trump. They're doing it to try and draw support for their own candidates in the upcoming elections
nononono, the elections will happen regardless
By the time Trump is impeached (assuming it even happens at all), and Pence's presidency term starts, his term will already be almost over
and impeachment takes quite awhile to actually happen
the next elections happen in 2020 which is....pretty fucking soon
the bright side also is that his presidency wouldn't last very long, unless he has a successful run for reelection
totally
yeah sure, we'll only use "a few"
lol
just
lol
"a few nukes"
nuclear warfare
then yeah, sure
unless you're talking about the outright extinction of our species
I honestly doubt it'll be "nuclearly so"
which....I'm not counting on
not unless ALL OF HUMANITY suddenly and magically becomes enlightened and we all transform into perfect angels that are actually capable of loving and respecting each other
I can believe that the US will last awhile longer, but I don't believe for a second everything will improve without any form of civil uprising whatsoever
if America stands the test of time, it won't be without **massive** conflict and change
oh
AHAHAHAHHAHAHA
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA
move to Japan, watch America fall, wait for New America, move back home~
and it will almost for sure get **way** worse before it gets any better
things are gonna change one way or the other
move to the Eastern world and *then* look forward to the end of the Western <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
though it's not like the rest of the world is without their own problems
preferably one less fucked up
I wanna move to another country
yet impeachment comes up with literally every Presidency ever
IIRC, there's only like....one or two successes?
impeachments pretty much always fail despite best efforts anyway
and while we'll never have **perfect**, we can still work for **better**
though we can certainly find one less fucked up
I mean, pretty much **every** government system is fucked up in some way
at this rate, we might even have a LIbertarian president here in a few more cycles
there will always be wars between two countries
it may not
nukes are simulatenously putting us on the brink of extinction and saving us from extinction
Nuclear detterrence is a thing, whether we like to admit it or not
I agree with that point
but unless there's only like, **one** country left to beat in said war, I doubt there will only be "a few" nukes launched if there are any at all
it's unlikely, but I can see it
like, I can legit see us going through WWIII and never actually launching nukes at all through the whole thing
~~a plan that will still most likely fuck up to some degree or another~~
unless they go truly insane, or have a **really** well crafted plan
which is why it's unlikely anyone will use any nukes
and even as an ally country, it's hard to ignore you might be next
sure, but it's hard to ignore when you're being nuked
especially ones involving more than 2 countries
I feel like you don't understand just how complex wars actually are
yeah, and when that communication is "hey, we're being nuked"
and that magically means allies don't protect each other anymore?
and like...are usually obligated in some form to protect an ally if said ally is nuked?
and like, you *do* realize countries are allied with each other, right?
especially since such a war would most likley be a *world* war involving more than that many countries with nukes?
I mean, maybe I"m wrong with the whole *every* nuke thing, but only 2-4?
I imagine you're being overly idealist and that's not how reality would actually work
and I'm just saying, maybe be conscious of when and where you're telling those jokes?
but there's a time and place for it
I don't either
and then you just gave them a huge amount of unnecessary anxiety with your joke
someone might think you're being serious because....you know....**serious** discussion
I mean, it's fine if you wanna discuss it "for fun", but maybe don't do that in a channel literally called **serious** discussion?
like, it's not even worth discussing, IMO
<@256945399338631168> I'm not particularly concerned about something that has a 0.00000000000000000000000001% of happening
and....quite a bit of other steps
and gain security clearance somehow
said monkey would have to gain access to the facility
nobody uses **any** nukes at all because they realize using **some** nukes would almost for sure escalate into using **all** nukes
if any world leader thought they could use "a few" nukes without the situation escalating and ending the world, there's a 100% chance someone would've
otherwise we would've been using nukes already
the whole "it's in nobody's interest" thing is the whole reason nukes wouldn't be used *at all*
<@472513526393602059> you don't, and that's the point
the govnerment doesn't want the public to get upset over what kinds of nukes they've been working on
especially when it comes to nukes
there's all sorts of weapons the military has we don't hear about
<@379633671897874433> while I appreciate the comment, I feel I'm too emotional to be called the "voice of reason", even in my calmer state
and if not, we're working on it
if it's a weapon, chances are pretty good there's a nuclear warhead for it
even the smaller ones are scarier in their own way
and they've gotten scarier since
~~most people considered a Trump presidency highly unlikely, and look where the fuck we are~~
unlikely stuff *does* actually happen from time to time
like, maybe I"m right and it **is** more likely that all nukes will be used....but then the future war happens and we use like, 10
and hell, just becasue something is "more likely" doesn't mean it's "100% guaranteed to happen"
we could even end up using exactly 50.3% of nukes, instead of either launching only a few, or literally everyfuckingone
that still leaves the possibility of "most" or hell, even "some"
my argument was "it's highly unlikely only a few will be used"
my argument was **never** "literally any amount of nukes used means all nukes used"
just because I think something is "more likely" doesn't mean I think the other thing is "literally fucking impossible"
believe or not, I AM actually capable of thinking on a SPECTRUM
seriously guys, fucking stop
"oh, Aria said this thing, SO OBVIOUSLY SHE'LL NEVER ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANYTHING LESS!!!!"
and I'd appreciate it if you and everyone else would stop assuming the extremes in literally any argument I ever make ever
I never said using nukes 100% guarantees nuclear apocalypse
<:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
what if ALIENS?!
what if the sun falls from the sky?
what if one of them accidentally nukes the ocean?
what if they both just wipe each other out?
what if no one wins?
what if India wins?
it does *significantly* change the political situation
while that doesn't guarantee another nuclear war
nukes that, again, they've already proven to be willing to use
with nukes
desperate enough to make threats
and desperate for said aid
it 100% does
and this is just one example regardless
but again, the possibility is there
so I don't know how likely it is they are to actually threaten other countries
or even their relationshipo with India
now, I don't know enough about Pakistan politics to know what kind of relations they have with US or China or Russia
and if Pakistan makes threats towards other countries....you have to assume those threats are backed by nukes
Pakistan at this point has already proved they are willing to use nukes
say Pakistan wins, for example, and then one of the other 3 countries feels threatened by Pakistan
it would largely depend on the end result
not even those two
by any country
again, I doubt nukes would even be used at all in a India-Pakistan war
that would almost certainly drag more countries into the war
oh, I highly doubt nukes would be used in such a relatively small scale war
there are still wars between jsut two countries
but again
and thus, we inch close and closer to world war
but the more other countries get involved as well, the more likely that still more countries will get involved
jesus christ, the goverment will come up with ANY bullshit reason to accuse someone of being some major criminal
and that's somehow legal?
tf?
wait, why is that a word they care about?
oh
I'm going through a list of words the NSA might care about in my head and I'm not finding anything that ryhmes
I hope I don't use it by mistake, because I have no idea what you're talking about :B
uh
and when that doesn't work, FIND SOME CONTROVERSY
they talk about whatever they think we want to hear to distract us away from what they're doing
nuclear weaponry existing at all is a problem nobody is particularly excited about, and the only ones that want MORE of it are the ones in charge of deciding whether or not we make more
and for good reason
and really, the public kinda gets pissed about nuclear weapons in general
which would *definitely* happen with having to drop the grenade at your feet instead
the issue was the soldiers killing themselves along with the enemy
but that wasn't the issue the public had with it
well, they might not be throwing the grenades
and that's assuming we convince the governments of the world to do that to begin with
IIRC, disposing of nuclear weapons isn't a particularly easy task
even if we manage to convince to government to stop inventing any more new weapons....we still have all the old ones
nuclear technology being used for weapons at all is a problem, but what can we really do about it?
~~the problem is that they exist in any form other than "useful daily life stuff" form~~
they could call it a nuclear lamp if they want, and there ain't shit anyone can do about it
so if the military wants to say "hand grenade"....the fuck you gonna do to stop them?
sure, but you're not the one coming up with what definitions the military uses
and yet, we still consider them to be two different things
what's the functional difference between a monitor and a tv?
what's the functional difference between a lamp and a ceiling light?
sure, but the procedure for arming a bomb is different than a grenade
IIRC, standard bombs don't have a pin you have to pull before dropping them out of the plane
the pin, for one thing
I mean, that's the standard use for most types, but it's still not a part of the definition
throwing them isn't a part of the definition
grenades can be dropped and still be grenades
I forget the codename for said naval exercise
fun fact: the "dangerously sexy" bikinis were inspired by a naval exercise involving dropping nuclear bombs on ships
many medical equipment
your microwave, for example
and to be fair, nuclear technology outside of weapons is actually extremely useful
the military found a way
and yet, it exists
how would a shotgun nuke even work?
and you're probalby gonna kill yourself as well using it
but it's a nuke
literally the same way as any other grenade
easily
I'm pretty sure they exist
allegedly
so the government allegedly stopped working on them
apparently the wives didn't like the idea of their husbands blowing themselves up to take out a block
as soon as the public found out about it, they got PISSED
I remember watching a documentary on the manhattan project that created nukes to begin with. Shortly after said nukes were made the government started trying to make nuclear hand grenades
well I hope not, because you just said it multiple times <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
*backs away slowly*
cool
oh
**especially** online gun nuts
yeah....there's a reason I don't really like being around gun nuts
(ie. almost never)
I think we should be fine here as long as we don't use the term any more than we already have been
all the more reason to look into context before raiding someone's home
it has all sorts of meanings
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
I swear to god if that literally happens....
inb4 Krika goes to jail
well, and that thingiemajic for the PS3 move controllers meant for games like SOCOM
the only guns I have are the "guns" on my Kancolle figures <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
server flagged <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
"We'RE prOTeCtInG thE COuNtRY FrOm TerRorISts!"
like I said earlier, the government will find *any* excuse to call someone a criminal and throw their ass in jail
of course, the FBI never cares about context unless your lawyer forces them to care
because it's also a fucking 80's dance movie and said dance movie also gets memed fairly often
but still, check out the context before raiding someone's home
I mean, if the phrase is, in fact, being used for "shooting law enforcement" memers, then I can see why they would be concerned
~~time to move to Africa!~~
how's the FBI gonna fuck them over?
what happens if someone who lives in, say, South Africa uses that term here?
preferably the latter
it needs to either just happen already or just fucking die
~~I'm legit half tempted to seek asylum away from the US~~
what are the requirements for asylum in Germany?
and therefore, we don't wanna do it
it costs money
of course, the **real** issue is money
there's not any more ethics to it, but there's at least a bit more logic
I mean, it's not any less fucked up to forsake illegal immagrants either, but it's at least *slightly* more understandable why they might choose to do it anyway
hence why I was askign about it
but it's not necessarily 100% guranteed to be the case, either
that's generally how the term is used, yes
That's not as fucked up as making it illegal to do so, but still pretty fucked up
and the EU just decided "we don't want to help make sure they can get here safely"
If I'm reading the article right....these are people coming to the country mostly legally?
~~link article so I can look into it~~
wtf was even their reasoning behind that?
why?
wait, sea rescues are straight-up illegal now?
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
I can if I don't do both at the same time!
So if I successfully recieve asylum from Scandinavia, I have my choice of 5 countries to live in <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~how about Scandinavia?~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~what's the requirements for seeking asylum in Switzerland?~~
though balance is hard to achieve when everyone thinks in extremes
balance is usually the answer, tbh
Even the current US political system would work out alright if humans were actually capable of being decent to each other
but we still strive to get as close as we can
every good idealogy is unrealistic
even I don't know a whole lot about communism, which is why I never really use it as a valid form of argument
cold war era Propaganda really did it's job
....and yeah
so you mention communism in a political argument at all
pretty much NOBODY knows much about communism outside of "THE REDS ARE COMING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD OHNOEZ WE HAVE TO STOP THEM"
well yeah
and some are less bad than others
though there's also more than one form of communism
communism has it's own problems
"better" by how much, tho?
As much as I hate loud-mouthed bigots, quiet politicians aren't necessarily a good thing, either
like, I was talking about WORK CULTURE but you yelled at me like I was talking about every aspect of Japan
<@256945399338631168> if you truly know what I'm dealing with (and I find that incredibly hard to believe since you don't even know me well enough to know what exactly I'm dealing with to begin with), then maybe you could show me a little more compassion for the struggles I"m going through instead of assuming the worst in everything I say?
which, news flash, I wouldn't want to do that either if I truly focused on the negative as much as you think I do
hell, I even implied that I woudl still want to live in Japan making money as a content creator
and just because I mention how bad WORK CULTURE is, doesn't mena I think Japan as a country is terrible
as well as the complete apathy from those around me
my attitude comes from my mental health condition
totally
totally helps me out
thanks for condmening me for it
SOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYY that depression makes it hard to think happy thoughts
well SOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYY I can't just plaster a fake smile on my face and **pretend** everything's fine
we weret alking about work culture in Japan
and we weren't even talking about Japan
I'm realizing the reality of how the negative affects me, and how the positive may not be enough to be worthwhile
I'm not focusing on just the negative of a counrty
and currently, they're fucking shit
so IDGAF if things "are progressing". I care about how they currently are
NOW
not LATER
I need that hope NOW
and putting myself into a situation that's almost guranteed to make things WORSE isn't a good idea, even if there some hope in the FAR off future.
it's something I'm suffering through NOW
me having suicidal thoughts isn't some future event I have to plan before
regardless of how distressing or how hopeful it may or may not be
either way, the future is irrelavant to the job I woudl get TODAY
"is less" and "progressing to be less"
"progressing" and "is" are two VERY different things
and frankly, American culture isn't that great for me either
that's still working for a company in Japan's culture
lolno
make money as a content creator and I won't have to worry about finding a job
that's why I start making money from my music first <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
....maybe I'll seek asylum in Japan
I'll just seek asylum in like......10 years
most famous youtubers got where they are by a fair bit of luck
lucky breaks *do* happen, after all
but I won't know unless I at least try
it's very possible I'll die without anyone ever listening to my songs outside my social circle
and again....this is all assuming I make any money off of my music to begin with
as with pretty much everything else in life
both paths have pros, and both have cons
but so is working a standard job when you have mental health issues like mine
I realize that
and depending on how well that does, I could look into the more expensive options
I'll most likely not move to Japan at all until I actually do make a living off of content creation, if I can do that at all
and again, it's an option if I wanna live cheaper
but the apartment I live in is already pretty damn small
or higher
maybe even right up to where American prices are like
and yes, I realize if I want a "decent" size I"ll have to pay more
I realize a lot of them are pretty damn small
so it could still be more expensive overall
and of course, I still haven't looked into the prices of other things like food, public transit, clothing, furniture, etc
Mind you, there could very well be expenses they "conveniently" don't mention, even on top of the ones they do
<@!102691114762371072> https://apartments.gaijinpot.com/en/rent/listing This is the website I was looking at. Sort by "low to high" and it shows numerous apartments in just about every area for around 20,000yen/month.
but still!
mostly hostels and capsule hotels, of course
and if you just want dirt cheap, there are hotels with **really** good guest ratings for as little as $15-20/night USD
I can stay at a luxury 5 star hotel in Japan for literally the same prices as an "ok" 3 star hotel in SLC
but man, have you ever looked at hotel prices
though these apartments weren't necessarily ones right in the city center, mind you
it specifically said monthly, yeah
as far as rent, anyway
yet Japan would still be cheaper even without that assistance in many places
and understand most my current rent is being covered by government assistance, which I wouldn't have in Japan
even in Tokyo I can get a bigger apartment than what I'm living in now for CHEAPER than what I'm paying
anyway, life in Japan. I looked into apartment prices just for the lulz the other day and....they're actually surprisingly cheap
jesus, claim you're showing me compassion but you can't just shut the fuck up about how much you hate me and my mindset
mate, just drop it like you claim you're gonna
that was you
"like I don't personally see the point of focusing entirely on a negative aspect of a country"
all caps isn't the only way of yelling, mate
no, I'm not wrong
whatever helps you feel like you're the good guy
you think whatever you want, mate
and accused me of "only looking at the negative" just because I didn't immediately mention all the positives
....a bit late to the party there <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yet here I am
I'm nowhere near 100% perfect myself
it's unreasonable think you're only allowed to communicate with other humans if you're 100% perfect at it
and if everyone was killing themselves for saying stupid things, you wouldn't have even been born into the world to say stupid things yourself since your parents would be dead before they even met, let alone made you
mate, if that was the right answer for saying stupid shit, literally everyone would have to kill themselves
Like, *of course* the law is gonna give leeway to your legal guardians when you're underage
**not** the same thing
that's
yeah
an adult's personal info is gonna be worth WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more money than the personal info of a child
like, why would they **not** sell an adult's info?
especially the bit about "under 18"
that sounds like a conspiracy they came up with to feed into your paranoia
and specifically under 18?
but therapists?
Like, there's a lot of personal info selling going on with major companies and whatnot nowadays
^^^
like what, there's some law or something that specifically allows therapists to sell children's personal info, but not adults?
guys, it's over. drop it
~~I'm tempted to make it my new PFP~~

NEW SERVER EMOTE
one small, but super nice thing that helps, though
and even if there is yet another goddamned roadblock that I'm fucking sick of....I have a case manager who's working REALLY hard to deal with all this hoop jumping
and again, I have more services coming in next month, assuming there isn't yet another roadblock in the way
I have my counselor I talk to, Kerrik
but that's one of the many issues I'm working hard on
and yeah, maybe my viewpoint is rather fatalistic as I'm constantly accused of
~~as it is, I probably share too much, actually~~
A large combination of issues, many of which are deeply personal that I don't feel comfortable publicly sharing
and there's not much I can do about that except work my hardest to improve
but for **now**, it's not really in the cards for me
maybe I'll even find one that I can be happy in
and someday, I may even be in a place where I actually can go and get a "real" job
I am **hopefully** getting more services starting next month
I am working on my mental health
but it's for sure not something I can do with where I'm at *currently*
I'm not necessarily discounting the possiblity of a standard job
and thus the most likely to try and put an end to it
those are the people most fed up with their BS
at all
like
most youth I know of don't vote
distractions
propaganda
money
and even when they do....the government will find a way to "fix" the problem that doesn't involve them losing on their lobbyist money
which, admittedly, is rare
sure, but they still listen to the citizens if the citizens make enough noise to outdo the money
well
ah
the government isn't going to give a shit until the people start yelling at them about it and won't stfu
the people need to give a shit before the government will give a shit
"but they totally do!"
because no one has to
and that's why we're in this mess to begin with
^
absolutely
it would
....and the further damage we're gonna continue to do for likely quite  a long while
yeah well, we also need to undo some of the damage we've done already
you never know what technological breakthrough we could have that could completely turn things around
heck, even climate change isn't 100% set in stone
or they coudl launch a nuke....literally never
someone could launch a nuke right freakin now
and like I said in that debate "most likely" doesn't necessarily mean "set in stone and will for sure happen"
the debate was over how many nukes would be used
the convo wasn't over what was most likely to kill us
but like
well yeah
since...ya know....moving ain't easy
but also working on trying to improve things here as well in the meantime
Hence why I'm working on moving
That's absolutely the case for the environment I in
hahaahahahah
but even then it's mostly less "controversy" and more "Lol, memes!"
apart from the issues with bugs and such, anyway
I actually haven't even heard any horrible controversies abotu Bethesda until just recently, actually
EA is way worse than Bethesda, IMO
yet people still give them money
but I don't think I've really ever had the opportunity to play BFV. I don't enjoy shooters enough to buy them at full price
and can look at it's case right now and say "yup, I own that"
I *know* I've play BF1, since I have that on PS4
I don't remember if I've ever played BFV
Fuck EA <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
but before I go
anyways, I'm off for some church and FREE ALL YOU CAN EAT PIZZA
that meme
oh yeah
*totally* sounds like a great guy to be around
oh boy
surely there can be no such thing! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
BLASPHEMEY!
What? A super famous musician with a god complex?
I know what Kanye West does for a living, but that's about all I know
~~who?~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
EA owns the company, for one, and with as much money as they threw around....I doubt they just left everything up to DICE
true, but you can't say EA had nothing to do with any of the nonesense
Disney themselves literally stepped in and told them "hey, stop fucking our IP up"
read up on that fun stuff
Battlefront II, mah dude
oh man
ah
hahahah
I wonder if watching cybernetic athletes will still be as fun as watching regular athletes? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
though that's still a hilarious thought
by the time we get **that** far, we'll have an entirely seperate Power Olympics
hah
if you're scoring a touchdown literally every time you carry the ball.....someone's gonna have some questions
oh absolutely
....so in the end cybernetics will probably just be tossed in with the controversies we already have <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Though they also ban steroids and steroids are still used a lot
yeah, and Sports leagues pretty much already ban those, so they might just toss in cybernetics into the ban no issues once it becomes a thing
~~I'm guessing that's a satire site~~
that's....one way to look at it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"Brexit renewed for another season"
and hell, we can argue all day about how likely or unlikely this or that is, but in the end none of us can really prove our points
and yeah, how fast they set in will affect how much controversy they stir up
oh yeah, Military is pretty much guaranteed to be a *massive* fucking issue even if there's nothing controversial on the Sports side of things
it's not like sports leagues are coming up with policies pre-emptively
that's why I'm saying it *could* and *probably will be* an issue in sports when it's first introduced
especially with all the legal, social, financial issues that would most likely be invovled
I don't think cybernetic enhancements, as awesome as they sound, are gonna be a widespread thing immediately upon introduction to the world
but I did pick one
thought I typed that out properly the first time
but those few athletes that were the first to get enhancements will still want to play
and if cybernetic enhancements aren't immediately widespread upon being introduced, there's a pretty good possibility there won't be enough athletes to justify making a seperate league right away
but athletes can be pretty fucking full of themselves
maybe
I think the latter is *far* more likely, quite frankly
true, but will they immediately create a separate sports league for cybernetics, or will there be a big social issue behind cybernetic athletes before they're **forced** to create a separate sports league?
oh yeah, and then you go into whether to allow them to participate in sports and such....
etc etc etc etc etc
what civilian uses?
Is it being used for military purposes? is it *only* for military pursposes? what military uses?
Like, how is being implemented? What is being implemented? what are the laws governing it? What are the potential side effects? Are patients informed of these side effects?
especially since many of those factors are subjective, and a lot of others depends on still more factors
For me, it's too complicated an issue with too many different factors to really say for sure "I'm 100% with" or "I'm 100% against"
I get the relation to the earlier cybernetics conversation, but shouldn't this discussion be in <#357682999300718592> ?
how does a city being big or small prove that being smelly is inherently evil and always related to bad hygiene and never anything else?
uh.....how tho?
like, the way the convo was going, it seemed to me like he was trying to make some counter point to my arguments
I get that, but it still feels like it was in the wrong channel if that's literally all he's saying
I'm not trying to be mean or anything. i'm just....confused?
that uh....that's a nice fun fact at all, but I don't really see how it's <#336297840529899522>? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
.....k
ok so.....what are you trying to say with this 1565.562km city of yours?
the city website? wikepedia? some old wise man?
where did you get that number?
ok, but where did you get the population density of your city?
~~and yes I know I put too many commas in that run-on sentence. shut up <<~~
I still want to know where you sourced your numbers, see your calculations, and most importantly, know what point you're trying to make, or if you're just pointing out a fun fact.
and what do you mean by "same population density"? Do you mean global population density?
also, where are you sourcing you numbers, and how are you calculating them?
....and?
and it's equally as much of a stretch to soley credit good hygiene for all the longer life spans in modern history.
also there were a **lot** more factors than just poor hygiene that caused the black plague to be so devastating
and then catch a disease anyway even though you smelled so good
and hell, you can have poor hygiene and still smell good in some circumstances
you can have proper hygiene and still smell bad
I mean sure, poor hygeine, but poor hygeine isn't the only source of being smelly
like...at all
smell had nothing to do with that
Like, if it's really **that** big of a deal to us, we more than have the technology to *not* smell bad
Not to mention all the products we've created since then.
and yet, we somehow managed to survive as a species in this horrible smelling time
I mean, there was a time where bathing wasn't even a thing that exists
I mean, if just want to know how many people are on a flat piece of land, then yeah, sure
how is it useless? 2m living in a skyscraper is significantly different from 2m all standing on top of each other in an empty, undeveloped field
I'm just saying it tells more of the full story
I'm not saying it should be *required*
<@472513526393602059> I'd honestly rather you ask a mental health professional than me. They can explain the general diagnosis better than I can. And as far as how it manifest in me individually...that's *deeply* personal and I don't quite feel comfortable publicly sharing those details
like, why limit yourself to just that one measurement if you wanna tell the whole story?
honestly? I liked to see someone measure a city's population density by *cubed* kilometers and see how it compares to the density by *squared* kilometers
or SPACE
otherwise, why stop at just your room? why not measure all the air above your house?
like....I'm pretty sure modern day skyscrapers are built with some sort of method to access upper floors
which uh....we almost definitely would
I mean....you could always build stairs or something
we'd probably just build it as big as possible, and then whatever density that amounts to is the density we're stuck with, unless we wanted to cram ourselves tighter than necessary for w/e reason
but again, I don't think we'd really be able to build to a specific density to begin with
and with fitting the entire species onto a single city, I'd argue measuring in cubed would be *way* more important than ever
just because it's always been done that way, doesn't mean it always *should*
which would, essentially, be the same as a popluation density of 1 per squared kilometer
like, if we build 2,000,000 floors in the building, each person would have a full squared kilometer to themselves
so....cubed is still important
countercounterpoint: we might not build just the bare minimum of "up" distance. even in the same squared area, 2m across 20,000 floors is quite a bit different than 2m across 200,000 floors
no way we're fitting 2,000,000 people in a single kilometer without any skyscrapers
or probably even more up than around
actually, it's probably better to use cubed rather than squared since this megacity will almost for sure have just as much built UP as it does built AROUND
how about per cubed kilometer? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I think you would notice quite a large difference between a group of people who all showered that morning and a equally sized group where they all showed 5 months ago.
or is it just that not everyone uses those products?
is it though?
we have the technology to bulld a megacity, but not the beauty/hygiene products to deal with the smell? 🤔
I have Asperger's. my mind works differently than yours. I'm not gonna always see what you're trying to say
and don't condemn me for not immediately understanding
but don't condemn me for asking for clarification when I'm confused
whatever
if it actually does, fine
and that clarification sounded like it didn't belong in this channel
I began this by asking for clarification
which isn't much of a personal attack, and I'm not taking it too personally, but it's still kinda uncalled for
you accused me of dismissing rady
and why am I such a bad and evil person for getting confused? <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
why is that a bad thing? <@106866895076003840>
in a channel literally called <#336297840529899522>
and I was trying to have a serious discussion
and now it feels like *you guys* are dismissing *me*
and that's the issue I have
and that confused me
but they engaged me in my discussion about smell, then disengaged without any indication
and I'm fine with that
and I get rady wanted to discuss that
like, I get everyone else was discussing that
I was talking about how bad smell doesn't automatically mean bad hygiene
no I wasn't, actually
when I come into <#336297840529899522> I'm kinda preparing for...you know....serious discussion
"A channel for discussing things too heavy or explicit for <#336297387863703552>."
and like...we have seperate channels for "just for fun" discussions
I would assume we'd just build it as big as we possibly can, to reduce the density as much as possible without any regards to a specific number
but why would the utopia city necessarily have the same density?
I mean, he based this utopia city's density on his own city's density
Like, he engaged me with my convo about the smell aspect, then randomly switched to the city size aspect without any indication he was done talking about the smell aspect
again, not the convo we were having, so switching to that convo at random without warning is confuzzling <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
yes, but that wasn't necessarily the convo he and I were having
ok I see your point
uh....why *would* they?
uh....I don't think construction materials really affect a planets orbit at all?
and if it's an artificial planet, they probably originally come from an actual planet
like, there's intergalactic trade in that universe, isn't there?
well without knowing anything about it....my guess would be other planets?
I never watched nor cared for Star Wars so uh.....couldn't tell you
not that hard
just use the volume numbers instead of areas numbers
how can you not calculate density per volume? just measure the volume instead of the area, and calculate the density in literally the same way you were before
<@!203444794737950720> see, **that's** dismissing someone's point
both require materials that have to come from somewhere
I mean, that's gonna be an issue whether we build across more land or build higher up
uh....same place it comes from for building *around*?
~~inb4 down~~
so uh....that point against using cubed kilometers is kind of a moot point regardless
you still end up with more volume than you can actually use
also if you want to use the "I can't use that extra space" argument...a lot of people can't reach their ceilings very easily so....<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so uh....they may not have the same volume as another skyscraper even having the same number of floors and same area for each floor
**especially** since skyscrapers don't always have the exact same height for a "floor" to begin it, FYI
using cubed kilometers is, IMO, an easier way to explain it to some alien species than using squared kilometers, telling them how many floors there are, and then telling them how tall a floor is
you *have* to include those 3D measurements in some way or another
2D measurements don't make as much sense when talking about 3D
which would have the same total area, but a significantly different volume
give them volume, and they'll understand how much space we're actually living in. Give them area, and they might well assume we all have 1 inch walls or something
it also doesn't mean much to, say, an alien species that doesn't know what the standard height for a "floor" is
why have 2 separate numbers when I can have 1?
like, I'd rather the area be measured cubed, than have it be measured squared, and also tell me how many floors
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I wanna know cubed
I don't care if it's weird
I don't care if it's strange
I wanna know cubed
it's two different areas measured as one because humans
except it doesn't, really. that's just how you measure it
~~buy a ladder~~
but just because no one else cares about volume, doesn't mean I shouldn't be allowed to know
to the construction people, sure
but what If I wanna build a house that's different? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
which is fine for houses that are built with standard floor heights
and it's still listed in squared rather than cubed
for both of us
and that space covers the entire plot
My upstairs neighbor lives on the same plot of land that I do, but we still have our own space over that entire plot
I just wanna know how much space everyone has, INCLUDING space above other people's spaces
but I'm not trying to construct anything
for construction, sure
and I'm the type of person that wants the full story
which, again, doesn't tell the full story
every map I've seen just measure the area of land those skyscrapers are built on
I don't think I've ever seen a map that measures each floor of every building seperately
so what, you just measure the area of each floor seperately or what?
people who are curious about how much UP there is?
people who are curious about skyscrapers?
but what about people like me?
to be nice?
or like, use teh space for your drone
<@106866895076003840> you can ALWAYS use space for SOMETHING. ALWAYS. If you can't, get a ladder or build another building or build a bridge or....etc etc etc etc
problem solved
boom
then answer
or we can do the math ourselves and not be lazy assholes
again, huge difference between 2m in an empty field and 2m in a skypscraper built on that field
and like, maybe they want the full story?
I just said...maybe an alien species would want to know the density of our city?
you guys are just stuck on that for w/e reason
I never argued we should use it for construction
not for constructin, and I get that
but yeah, practically speaking, for this megacity we're gonna build as much as we can to reduce density as much as possible
which is what started this entire discussion to begin with, FYI
it was never practical to build to a specific density rather than "as big as can make it", but rady still discussed that
and why shouldn't I? Because you don't like it?
I can discuss whatever I want
I'm discussin possibility
but I'm not discussing pracitcality
it's not always practical
if you need something there, build it there
if something's in the way, get it out of the way
problem solved
boom
bridges exist
problem solved
boom
can't sleep on the wall? use it for decoration
problem solved
boom
2 buildings too close to each? know down the walls and extend them into each other
we can use 100% of the volume
lolwut?
and hey, just because you don't use the space doesn't mean you don't have it
I don't sleep on the ceiling, but I do still use that light that's hanging down on it
I don't sleep on the walls, but I still hang pictures up and such
just because you can't sleep in a certain block of air doesn't mean you literally can't use that air at all
<@183785454447886346> stairs, elevators, stepladders, etc etc etc
give me the numbers and I will! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
literally that easy
B. again, literally just replace "area" with "volume" in the exact same calculations you did before
A. that just kinda means people are stupid/lazy, not that the calculation is "useless"
either that, or the planet's about to be completely fucked in the next movie <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
obviously they figured it all out
I mean, we're talking about a planet that *currently* exists in this Stars Wars universe and is *completed* right?
they probably also made adjustments as necessary as they went along
I mean, the calculations aren't simple, but the logic of doing them is
unless they lack the knowledge to do so, it's literally that simple
if you know how to do the calculations and what the math is, it's literally just a matter of doing the math
SCIENCE
by calculating how the mass would affect the orbit while constructing
but again, point A
I get that
and B. it would take quite a large amount of additional mass to affect the orbit
but A. they probably calculated that along with their construction plans
and even if it doesn't exist now,t hat doesnt' mean it'll never exist in the future
just because you don't have a practical use doesn't mean a practical use doesn't exist
but I still wanna know for the lulz
probably not
is there a pracitcal use for that info?
calculate volume, then divide the population by that volume.. Boom, cubic density.
take like the tallest building in the city as the "height" of the city and go from there
I just wanted the population density of rady's megacity by cubic kilometers vs squared. And even without knowing how tall the megacity is, he based the squared kilomets based off his own city so....do that with the megacity, but with cubic.
I"m not gonna use this information for my own construction plans or to argue what construction plans this megacity should use
not for pracicality
yes, because I'm trying to learn things for fun
if you wanna know my parameters, ask. Don't just pull out a bunch of infinite parameters of your own <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
you were confused, but instead of asking for clarification you just made assumptions about what I was asking
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I don't fucking know
you're just choosing to ignore those parameters for....reasons, I guess?
I very much set parameters in my original question
you're assuming I didn't set parameters when I did
you're asking me about things I was never asking about
stop
Lily
...by how many people are?
or adding in some irrelevant parameter or removing a parameter you don't like
at this point I can't help but feel like you're **purposefully** misinterpreting everything I say just for the sake of telling me I'm wrong
jesus, guys, you're overthinking everything
if I ask for the area of Idaho Falls, would include the area all the way to Japan?
if I'm asking for the density of a specific location, I'm defining paramaters
legal issues?
insuffecient techology to build past the atmosphere?
lack of resources?
where we stopped building it
where does the height of Tokyo Tower end?
uh....when did I say infinite?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
whcih specific kilometer?
what kilometer?
it wouldn't be undefined
like....volume and area are both measurements of space
....literally the same way you measure it by area, but with the volume measurement instead?
practicality be damned
for the lulz
<@106866895076003840> population density by volume
there's still a **lot** about physics we don't understand, for example. Who's to say we won't have a use for cubic kilometers in the future?
also fun fact: just because you can't think of a practical use doesn't mean a practical use doesn't exist at all
problem solved
boom
use it for fun
then don't use it for pracitcal parameters
people who don't get bored still have fun
and how does being immune to boredom make you want to literally never do things for fun?
lowut?
what proof do you have there isn't an alien who wants to know cubic meters like I do?
and what proof do you have that aliens don't like random trivia?
because trivia games are totally *not* a thing that exists
god forbid someone learns a thing for **fun**
didn't realize that was a such a fucking issue
and hey, guess what guys? sometimes people like to learn impractical things just for fun!
if you know how tall each story is, sure
why is it such a grave sin to want information from people?
why are you so against giving people information?
~~maybe I just have too much faith in the people here~~
I doubt a witch hunt would necessarily take place, but still probalby a good idea to take it to DM's
they'll want to promote the server they like, and may even talk shit about hte server they don't
for example, if they're from the Valk server themselves, there's gonna be obvious heavy bias
that could be for a variety of reasons
I'm hoping things are just delayed a little bit and I'm not outright required to start the entire process over for a third time
the plan was due 2 days ago <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
apparently the company we chose to do the services can't submit the plan yet because it requires an updated physical
in other news, I have to go in for my yearly physical today...and hope the welfare office gave us a bit of leeway to get it done so I don't have to spend another year reapplying for the same mental health services I was already approved for <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
right right
just give me the metrics then <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
convo's not over until rady gives me the damn city <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
measured by areas and floors
yeah, we discussed that
or bus, for that matter
which....I"m gonna go ahead and guess you're not close enough to my city that I can just hop in a plane and go tomorrow for under $100 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and then fly to said city
I mean...I would also have to know who you are IRL for that xD
I can do maths
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
just tell me what city you live in and let me do the maths
height of the tallest building in your city <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I'll even calculate the Megacity numbers myself based off your cities numbers like you originally did
and if you don't want to do the math yourself, tell me the city you live in and I"ll find teh numbers and do the math myself
for the lulz
but regardless
and how hard would it be for Disney to just buy off a contact to help them out?
their 0 contacts would just make killing the industry even easier. no one to try and talk you out of it <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
We're talking about buying up the studios to kill the industry, not buying up the studios in some deluded attempt at saving it
if anything that just makes Disney's job easier. Less employees to drag into the manager's office to be fired <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
buy the studio that hires the freelancers...and then don't hire the freelancers anymore <:Cag:423197445644615711>
actually, if Disney kills the anime industry with the vault that's how they'd do it. Buy the anime studios out and put their IP's in the vault
~~inb4 Home Alone gets bought out and put in the vault~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
well yeah
"oh no! Marvel movies will show on Christmas instead of Die Hard!" I notice way more Marvel inspiration in anime than Die Hard so......
I mean, even if Disney is intent on killing anime, and *does* succeed, this whole "fox movies in the vault" thing probably won't even be a footnote
I don't see how Die Hard not showing every Christmas will do anything at all to the anime industry.
I'm not even sure how it would really affect the anime industry at all? Like, they can still use the movies as inspiration, and I'm pretty sure if they *have* to have a copy of the movies, they already do
it's gonna take a **lot** more than that for Disney to kill anime
and if they do, it won't be just the *one* factor of adding fox movies to the vault
I mean, they *can* damage the anime industry, but I doubt they will damage it as badly as you think they will
post me a link because I've never heard of that channel but it sounds interesting <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
....have you **never** researched holidays before?
including the most "Christian" holiday, Christmas
Most "Christian" holidays are borrowed from other cultures
not according to the Christians I've heard talk about it
but still
I mean, I can kinda understand the mindset
oof
Probably what I"ll end up doing for my kids if I ever have any
and a bit warmer, too
which makes a lot of sense. A lot safer, generally speaking
Yeah, people nowadays mostly just take their kids trick or treating at the mall or at a "trunk or treat" gathering or w/e.
I end up just buying the candy for myself, and if I'm gonna buy it just for myself, I'd rather wait one more day and buy it on heavy discount
This year I got 0!
I didn't bother buying any candy myself...albeit that's mainly because A. didn't have money until today and B. I only get a maximum of *one* group, anyway
they could've just silently kept their lights off or w/e, and no one would know his true intentions
and that's why it's fucked up
not wanting to celebrate Halloween is fine. Not handing out candy because "why should I help the poor?!" is pretty fucked up
I don't really consider anyone an asshole for *not* handing out candy....unless they make a post like that and make it clear specifically why they're not
and some just plain don't like the holiday
hell, some denominations of Christianity even outright consider it a sin
you're allowed to **not** celebrate Halloween
it's a stupid question to ask in general
I've never even heard of anyone calling Halloween a charity. It's a **holiday**
If Halloween isn't a charity, then why are you worrying about not participating? <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
if it happens at all, which it probably won't
I mean, they still can, but it's not gonna happen overnight and definitely not as a result of making Fox movies slightly harder to get
did I ever say this was all gonna happen overnight?
so?
and how is it impossible for Disney to create contacts if they want contacts?
how do you license Japanese anime without talking to the company at all?
and therefore, have anime contacts
sure, but people who sell Disney stuff probably also sell anime stuff
Disney stuff is sold in Japan, and *somebody* had to talk to Disney about getting that license to do so.
there's no way they have literally no contact with *any* Japanese company
yeah, India has a pretty large population
ah
where's "over here"? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but *shrugs* that's just being overly technical with it
language is more complex than "this is the definition"
I mean, it kind is a seperate language, in a sense
huh, I didn't realize those permissions were turned off until rady mentioned it
English isn't the only language that does this
that's why nobody is really born automatically being able to speak every single language
words don't have inherent meanings. Without humans coming along and assigning definitions, they're just meaningless noise
I mean, technically speaking they're not lying
including word definitions
humans are generally pretty full of themselves, and will use just about any excuse possible to look down on others
because everyone thinks there's an inherent meaning and that their inherent meaning is the "correct" inherent meaning
unless you argue that literally everyone is wrong, of course <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I mean, the lack of a real "inherent" meaning woudl naturally mean you can't be right or wrong
No it doesn't, but if those two groups want to communicate efficiently, compromise is necessary
and that's why I say we shoudln't just dismiss the meaning we've assigned words, even if assigned relatively arbitrarily
if we don't agree on what a word means, it's difficult to communicate properly
That's the reason we collectively assign meanings
^
that doesn't mean we should dismiss those meanings, mind you
words have the inherent meaning we as a collective have assigned to them
communication is a *lot* harder when you both have completely different meanings for the same word
and that can cause confusion when they're using those words around other groups
sometimes it only evolves within certain groups
that's the problem with languages evolving
I'm not at all saying we should disregard it
hell, it's not always "words" either
I have to agree with Nara on this. The only thing that really makes a language a language is a group of humans collectively agreeing "these are words and these are the definitions of said words"
~~it was inevitable~~
since we might still discover/create new things that need a new term
well, maybe not "non-evolving"
communication would be soooooooooooooooooooo much easier if we had a single, non-evolving universal language
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
damn ~~gay~~ straight
everyone in the past is high
high story
hi story
~~but not everything's a *good* story~~
everything's a story~
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
you should
<_<
well fuck you too
regardless of how everyone else discusses it. whether we agree, disagree, or joke around
does it? I've noticed dino tends to breakdown when he talks about these sorts of thigns
then why bring up the convo at all? this sounds like the sort of thing that would give you a mental breakdown regardless of what anyone says
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
classic villain denial
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
you're the evil villain
you're not the protagonist, dino
for being "not real" they sure do fuck my life up a lot
Miku's
it probably is
but still
not easily
I dunno, I've managed resolutions even in my emotional state
which makes it *very* difficult to control said emotions
I am emotionally involved in literally everything I say and do
~~cubed kilometers!~~
I should stay away from heated ones more often myself. I tend to take it a little too far, especially when I have a hard time properly explaining my position and get frustrated
~~me too!~~
I try to avoid "me too!" in this channel as much as possilbe myself
If anything, you're just helping to build an echo chamber
but yeah, simply stating "I agree" doesn't add a whole lot to a discussion
That's exactly what I wanted to say myself, but couldn't find the words for <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
but yeah, serious discussions aren't usually a very good place for joke emotes, and even more serious emotes can raise issues
I realized the irony immediately upon posting, but also thought it pointless to delete the message since you would definitely see it before I could do so :B
....sorry :B
in more ways than one
I can defnitely see reactions being misused in this channel, tbh
^
we found a way to add reactions <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
usually not. I kinda have a list of generic voices my mind likes to use for literally everyone
sometimes I still use their voice, sometimes I do
it kinda depends, actually
I mean....I kinda **have** to use a stand in if I don't know what they look like <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
pretty much
yeah
yeah
>>
maybe for the outsider that doesn't have to deal with the unpleasantness on constant basis
I don't need more unpleasant experiences in my life right now
you make it sound like an unpleasant experience
lolno
I've never really stared at my reflection for prolonged periods of time, so I couldn't compare
*shrugs* I dunno
it's not impossible for me to use IRL people in my imagination. It just feels **extremely** weird and I'd rather avoid it
and I don't like it
but it feels weird
well, ok I can
no
hahahhahah
They'll start off as having one aspect of my mood/personality, but then it just kinda takes on a life of it's own separate from my actual self.
and most times, those stand ins actually end up being their own entirely seperate character from me
I have several different "stand ins" I use for myself depending on the scenario/mood
same thing
~~though it helps with writing stories based off my life experiences since I'm already using different characters~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and I can't really explain why my mind feels like that
it is
like if I imagine something as family friendly as just playing music for a group of friends, it's not actually my group of friends. It's a group of stand ins meant to represent said friends
although it's not just sex, either. I just don't like using IRL people in any imaginary scenario
both just for fun and not for looking for a relationship
hell, I've only been on like, 2 dates my entire life
I've never actually gotten close enough to anyone IRL to consider sex, so I can't really say how I would handle it in an actual relationship
I even remember one dream where I was taking some chick from church to a room to have sex with. I remember feeling **really** weird about it and then literally summoned a stand in chick from out of nowhere, let go of the IRL girl, then went off with the stand in
if I do it at all, I use kind of a "stand in" for them instead of the actual person
but yeah, it feels weird imagining doing anything sexual with people I know
I actually kind of have the same problem, though I don't think to quite the same extent
In fact, there will probably be quite a bit of it you won't see simply because it happens slowly and gradually over time.
and if you can, get a second opinion as well. Other people might see results you miss
Give it at least a few months of *consistent* practice before you decide it isn't going to work for you
While it's possible it just straight up won't work for you, you almost definitely won't see immediate results regardless
another thing: give it time to work
let's kick his ass <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
the demon king
right
oh
WHO INVITED THIS TABLE TO MY RAVE PARTY?!
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
fuck the table
I flip the table
~~I don't move around IRL enough, lol~~
sometimes I can even "feel" myself pressing the dpad while moving around
like, I try to imagine it as me being "there", but instead it ends up feeling like I'm behind a camera or screen
not a "real" first person, per se
kind of
I'm glad you're willing to let the demon king know the dice in his eyes are your fault <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
good
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
and it's your fault
we're now at a rave
so it pulled shit out of thin air
then you asked what color and my mind went "wait, what? shit, fuck, I didn't prepare anything!"
didn't realize you wanted me to
I wasn't imagining any dice at all when you originally asked if I could
and then there's this dwarf chick that's just kinda standing there lost and confused
your dragon monk is doing pyrotechnics
my elf warrior is slamming his sword into a table and rocking his head to the beat
it's dungeons and raves
they're rave dice
like they're at a rave or something
right now they keep changing colors
whatever color I want them to be?
anything and everything I have an idea on what it looks like
AHAHAHAHAahahfhahahahahHAHAHAHAHAHAH
ahahah
aha
there is literally no dead end for me
I never am
I'm not
like I said earlier, my mind is pretty lazy with voices. I don't generally put too much thought into it
I just kinda default to my own voice, for the most part
but as long as I'm familiar with how the voice sounds, I can imitate it in my imagination at will
but I usually don't
yeah
why would he want to? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ARE YOU STALKING ME?!
Wait, how are you imagining throwing a chair at me having never seen my face? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
duh
me
laziness is a pretty universal experience <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~because laziness~~
hoo boy
"edge of legality"
writing it into a story is a way of repeating the beliefs. and the more you repeat them, the more you believe them
**especially** if you're coming up with justifications
also, writing stories about whatever beliefs you have can further cement those beliefs into your mind, whether you're writing for yourself or for profit or w/e
maybe the story isn't "wrong" (arguable), but you as the author certainly are
being a transphobic asshole is still wrong, no matter what fantasy world you come up with to justify it
and yeah, there's also the fact that authors will very often write their own morals into the story
this is *especially* true if you're writing to make money off of it
and realize they may not detach as much as you want them to
so you have to keep the audience in mind
the problem is you can't really control how detached other people will be to your work
clarify your point, then
trust me, I'm speaking from experience
mental torment is far deeper than physical torment
"the author concentrates more on the mental aspect rather than the physical"
completely wrong, but ok
got it
so it's only "deep" if it's physical pain
proportions are always weird
it's really hard to tell in anime style most times, tbh
....and my question is completely ignored
ok, I'm confused now. Were you talking about both ages simultaneously without differentiating between when you were referring to which?
what do you mean it's both?
which is why I brought up the 1000 year old vampire to begin with
but if you were talking about appearance of age rather than actual age this whole time....then you probably should've mentioned that because I thought you were talking about actual age
but that would still be an 8 year old body being lewded and lusted after
since you could easily draw an 8 year old vampire and say "but she's a vampire and she's 1000!"
if you're just talking about what age a character appears as, actual age doesn't matter
and yet, sick pedos still try and do it
now you're missing my point
I wasn't discussing any specific character
8
yes
you didn't specify appearance
that's the point I'm trying to make with that
with an 8 year old body
1000 year old vampire
and mentally prepared to handle it
like when they're biologically capable of mating
I mean, for the most part the laws are based off of science
just because the police won't arrest you for it doesn't mean parents are gonna be ok inviting you to all their kids' birthday parties
pedophilia is pedophilia, legal or otherwise
...of fucking course someone made a map
there's also plenty of fanart of child versions of adult characters
and then there's the ones depected as adults in the series, but pure children in fanart
in official media, yes
and then you get into the characters with child bodies but adult ages/personalities/etc
which is....kind of a flawed argument
eh...the only real reason that anime child pron is **allegedly** ok is because of the "they aren't real" thing
my opinion is that it really depends on the kind of lewding. Presentation and whatnot
~~not the exact wording, but I'm not scrolling back up~~
"is it ok for fanartists to lewd her?"
which is one thing Alice asked about
but it often is in fanart
that was just the one that is least likely to get Mel coming in here and banning you
that wasn't the "least generous" interpretation
you're reading everything that disagrees with you in the worst light possible
"least generous" bitch please
wtf?
I'm not accusing you of objectifiying
lolwut?
but it is to some
maybe not to you
porn is more than just bodies for some people
just stating facts
again, not trying to justify it
some people actually do jerk off to personalities, FYI
but I'm just saying
no it doesn't
I mean, you can put their personality in your drawings, too
we don't know that for sure, and it's rude to assume the worst in people
and try to remember some of us are below 18
honestly, the issue is something we probably shouldn't have discussed  at all on a server with minors around. I keep forgetting there are, in fact, minors. I'm gonna make a note to not discuss this sort of thing here in the future unless we take it to DMs
much "fun"
I will say this, though, simply condemnig it wholesale seems short-sighted
not opposed, but not supportive
right now I"m just...kinda in the middle, I guess?
honestly? I'm not sure how I feel about loli drawings overall
you can draw things that potray a character with a certain mindset/personality/etc
that's not necessarily true
even if it's with Miku
I straight up avoid anything that involves Hibiki having sex
Hibiki is a role model to me, not a waifu. I still look at lewds of her now and then, but I'm pretty selective of what lewds I approve of and download
Like Hibiki
**especially** for characters I get attached to
and it makes things awkward
it just....that's how my mind thinks sometimes
again, I"m not necessarily saying it's a bad thing and you shoudl all stop lewding
to me, drawing lewd fanart kinda feels like that
and if it happened to be 100% legal for them to be able to do it, that would just piss me off even more
but like, if someone were filming me having sex without my permission to do so, for example, I would be quite upset about it
again, not worried about the law here
just from the character's pov, I guess
I'm not even thinking of it from a legal pov
just.....feels weird to me
I'm not necessarily saying it's bad, mind you
even if the charcters are consenting to each other in-universe, they're not necessarily consenting to the artist to have their sex be drawn
~~also I identify as a woman, FYI~~
anyway, my main point is this:
seriously
lemme finish
guys
hang on, Anan, I'm not done yet
because they're not real
even if you're drawing 2 consenting adults happily having sex with each other.....they technically can't consent
that's one thing I've always felt a bit weird with any kind of lewd fanart
it's good that you got the right meds, though
that....doesn't sound particularly fun
so let's not
I've had Mel get on my case for that sort of thing before, and I don't disagree with her stance
well let's not
so
also, I don't think it's appropriate to name them
no
there was still that one person
mostly civil
and that's why you report it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
we're all aware, wfc
I once saw a guy get upset about being banned because the rules didn't mention them by name
of course, some people will look for any excuse to justify their actions to mods
though it's still stupid to jsut assume lolicon is ok just because it's not explicitly stated in the server rules
some servers still allow it, at risk of said server getting deleted by discord
I don't trust *any* method, tbh
so
A good portion of our labels come from our parents
~~youngling is literally a label, mom~~
The term millennial is closer to being "equivalent to the n-word" than boomer, but I think we can all agree it's still nowhere near as bad
this is very much an "Ok boomer" situation
love how 99% of the comments are just "Ok boomer"
ok then
ah
that also sounds like <#357682999300718592>
I *really* should've left that community long before I did
of course, this was the type of place where pretty much every slur was thrown around left and right over literally fucking everything
the R slur was used **all the time** on the AMV Hell forums, which I frequented quite a bit
of course, that changed quite quickly once I started chatting on forums more
I knew that one was a slur, but I've heard it used causally with little ill intent so often that it didnt' seem like that big of a deal to me for awhile
easy for me to avoid using the slur myself since it was never really in my vocabulary to begin with, and even to this day I tend to avoid the types of people that use it on a frequent basis
and it took awhile after that before I know what the actual word was
I actually legit didn't even know what the "n word" was when I first heard the term "n word"
someway somehow, my community manages to never use the term, as bigoted as they are
yeah, that's one of the problems with the internet
and how much power a word needs before it becomes a slur?
how do we determine how much power a word has?
I guess I don't know what a "slur" is, then. So is a slur more than just an insult?
is what I meant
well, they're often used as slurs
"ok boomer" as an ageist slur is just a Millennial's response to "millennial" as an ageist slur
or my whole life really, to a lesser extent
I've been needing that for like....a decade
~~does this mean you've fulfilled your quota for the day and we don't have to hear about it again until tomorrow? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~
and that purpose isn't to learn more about yourself
these things have one purpose, and one purpose only
and deliberately antagonistic
"hey guys, this is how much I disagree with you! Feel free to start treating me with the appropriate level of hate now!"
and I *definitely* wouldn't feel comfortable sharing my result, tbh
I don't think I'd be comfortable taking this quiz
I mean, is there really anyone nowadays that isn't?
pick up a hobby or learn a new skill or volunteer, etc
so....find some meaning
Life only has meaning that you give it
the bullshit some people come up with to justify their fucked up worldviews <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
"masochistic sexual obsession". WTF?
kids cartoons aren't kid friendly?
No one's gonna really know what exactly counts and doesn't count as kid friendly until the FTC starts suing people and the courts start making rulings
and that's the issue
and using the wrong one opens you up to fines
but a lot of people aren't gonna know which mark to use, Nara
but my example is an obvious, extreme example
granted, it's probably not very likely
see, but if the FTC decides that the video is still somehow "child friendly" because the game I'm playing is Minecraft, I could still get sued
Like, you seriously think parents would be ok with their kids watching something like that?
If I'm playing Minecraft, but I'm saying "fuck" at least 50 times in the video, making sex jokes, and using a mod that adds blood and gore to the game, marking my video as "kid friendly" won't save me from the FTC. That's just stupid.
Marking everything as kid friendly is just as risky as *not* marking it kid friendly,
And this is on top of losing out on the comments, ad revenue, community tab, and everything else
<@!472513526393602059> The problem is that if you mark your content as kid friendly but then make adult content, that still opens you up to a lawsuit
"I'm *totally* 80 years old, youtube, trust me!"
By relying on kids to tell the truth about their age during account creation
Same way they always have
~~seriously though, why do they think I want my video thumbnails to take up double the space?~~
It is kinda hilarious they're doing all this after the new frontpage "update", though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> Trying to protect the kids while also making sure their Grandpa can see it too!
I do like that the FTC is taking steps to protect children on youtube, but the steps they are taking are misguided, at best
Way easier to make everyone hate each other than to bring about any legitimate justice.
Same thing with pretty much every other government agency. Learning about the issue is hard, so why do that and make **actually helpful laws** when you can just throw something together at random and convince the public you *totally* did your job?
the ruling is intentionally vague. The FTC doesn't actually want to protect kids. It's just lashing out a random in a manner that kinda sorta resembles protecting children so they can brag about how much they're doing to save the children.
Although there's also major issues with how the politicians are handling it
That's what happened with Youtube itself, actually. Great platform for content creators. Becomes big. Gets bought by Google. Money is valued over content creators. Then this bullshit
once they make the big money, that's all they'll care about
and then it'll become Youtube 2
and then it'll get bought out
Another huge problem is that even if it *does* handle these issue well....it'll eventually grow to be pretty big
The biggest problem will be if this next new platform will be any better at handling this kind of stuff
Oh, people will for sure start abandoning youtube once their content creators start getting hit with millions of dollars of fines and are forced to stop making videos
And I *do* feel like creators, as well as youtube itself, should be doing more to distinguish between kid friendly and adult content
Hopefully I'm just misunderstanding that aspect and you actually can just mark it as "not for kids" and be fine regardless of what you post
The only good thing about this on an individual level is that the FTC likely won't sue small time channels that barely have any subs at all. But those channels will ultimately still get fucked anyway when Youtube makes changes over what happens to their money makers.
I think a lot of youtubers will want to use the "not kid friendly" label too, since marking your content as kid friendly means you lose out on a lot of ad revenue, as well as things like comments, the community tab, etc
Another example I'm seeing used fairly commonly right now is collectables.
Like if they decide it should be labeled as "kid friendly" even though you're saying "fuck" every few sentences because the game you're playing is Minecraft
It sounds like you can get sued even if you label your content as not for kids, but the FTC thinks it's family friendly enough to qualify as for kids and thus you've mislabeled.
This sounds like a very good reason to cancel my youtube debut <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
both being visual entertainment' is about where the similarities begin and end.
^
they didn't preemptively make all those laws ahead of time before TV was invented
it's not some brand-new thing old timer politicians have a hard time understanding.
and to rady's point, there is that. TV has been around a **lot** longer, thus the laws are more fleshed out
~~though those big networks are working on taking over YT~~
and not just big networks
being made by people like you and me
it's visual entertainment on the internet
and of course, the lobbying
and B. the laws are different
because A. youtube is internet streaming, which is an entirely different beast from TV
they just care about what fake villain they can "defeat" to look good
they don't care about who *should* be responsible
It's the US government
at some point or another, parents have to step up and **be a parent**
if the parent doesn't watch their kid and make sure they're not lying about their age, there's really not much youtube or any other website can do
the problem is that it's difficult to verify without parents being responsible at all
so
as for the "kids can still get into PG13 movies jsut fine" thing...that's not on the ratings being useless. That's on the law not covering enough
thus, ratings have a point
thus, R rating has a point
maybe a kid can get into a PG13 movie with little issue, but R rating still blocks them without ID
they are not
you said rating were completly meaningless
but that's not the point
sure, and we can argue about how they should make IDs for teens for PG13 movies
I've not been to a R rated film before where I *wasn't* asked for ID
that's why they require ID
and parents can't sue the theater if they take their kids into said movie with them
Movie theaters can't legally sell tickets to R rated movies to anyone under 18
uh, they kinda are, actually
but that's where it falls back onto the parent's
and yes, I know kids can make adult accounts
youtube could restrict the videos children accounts are allowed to watch
ratings would be relevant
literally none
and I have no issues with that part
well yeah
and just as it's on the parent to *not* take their kids to an R rated film, parents should be responsible for making sure their kids aren't watching similarly rated youtube videos
Movies have ratings. Games have ratings. I think youtube videos need ratings.
and there *should* be a better system in place for determing what videos are and aren't kid friendly
it should be on the parents
it shouldn't be on children
but I'll believe that when I see it, and not a second sooner
I would absolutely *love* for no harm to come from this
I **really** hope so
I hope so, Nara
and get everyone to hate each other so you don't actually have to think about anything
politics nowadays is all about lashing out at whatever group you can to make yourself look like a hero
it's not about protecting the kids. It's about making yourself *look* like you're protecting the kids
they intentionally design everything to be backwards
it's the US government
and that's why everyone's upset about it
it is bullshit
at least, that's the vauge wording of the ruling
even though you weren't targeting kids
if you target adults, but your content is kid friendly enough to be deemed as such, the FTC can sue you for not marking your videas as kid friendly
you're the one who's missing the point. It's not about what audience you're targeting.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
having kids requires having sex
I know I won't
~~and immature adults~~
I've seen mature kids before
^
yeah, talking to your kids is pretty important
The best way to take care of your kids is to never have any <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
who knows? <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
but of course, those consequences are *clearly* everyone else's fault!
and don't care about the consequences until the consequences actually happen
stupid
because
if the parents still want to buy the tickets....whatever horrors your child experiences is now 100% your own damn fault.
If they see a parent bringing in a kid and asking for 2 tickets to an R rated film, the teller will always let them know "this movie you're about to watch isn't for kids"
which I don't know how common it is across the country, but I know the ones here make a point of it
especially when the theater blatantly warns them
GG
literally the only fun I had was using the cheat codes to summon a tank from mid air and just use that for everything
it was incredibly boring to me
and frankly, I hated it
GTA III was actually my very first M rated game I bought
though fortunately for her, I was more into Final Fantasy games than I was GTA
my mother never payed any attention to what games I bought
~~fish make fucking terrible pets, I swear~~
if it's a fish.....uh.....look at it! :D
if it's a fox, give it double the pets!
if it's a dog, pet it!
if it's a cat, pet it!
if it's an anime figure, look at it!
if it's art, look at it!
if it's a limo, have your driver take you around
if it's a private jet, fly around in it!
depends on the stuff <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and people always want more stuff
having more money lets you buy more stuff
humans are, by nature, greedy
perfect financial sense!
it makes perfect sense
and didn't try to turn literally everything in existence into a product to be sold on shelves
Capitalism would be a *much* better system if it recognized the existence of other value outside of monetary value.
I mean, I like the ability to buy nice things and merch of my favorite IPs, but having my inherent worth as a living being determined by how much money I'm hoarding in my bank account is just.....fuck you, capitalism.
fuck capitalism <_<
including human lives
turning literally everything into commercial products
also, fuck capitalism
YT doesn't need targeted ads to make money. Regular ads would do just fine
If Google were to get rid of any and all tracking right here and now, they'd still around 10 years from now
Yup
I have to agree 100% with Saki's point. Money is meant to be actively moved around. It's good to hoard a certain amount just for emergencies, but beyond that it benefits no one but your own selfish ego. Even if you're not putting it back in the economy, per se, you could at least be donating that money to charities to make the world a better place.
~~research in how to hoard more money~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
humans have always wanted more
money itself is just....a thing
people's mentality about money is a **far** bigger evil than money itself
the problems that come from the rich have little to do with their wealth and almost everything to do with their mentality about their wealth
and I'm not saying it is
no it's not
but a fairly big portion nonetheless
and maybe not even most
not all of them, mind you
sure, but even a lot of the quietly rich are that way
The ones who are most in the public's eyes and thus, the ones who are most concerned with their appearance
This is especially true for the TV and Hollywood celebrities and the like.
but because **status**
not because they need so many cars
a lot of rich folks will have an entire *fleet* of expensive cars
where money (and the status that comes from having it) is the most important thing of all
especially in capitalist societies
a **lot** of things are bought for status rather than use
Private jets are typically bought for status more than privacy, tbh
and who doesn't want to feel better than everyone else?
and "better" than everyone else
and bragging makes you feel oh-so-"important"
and yeah, private jets aren't really the best use of the money, but you can *brag* about it!
like hoarding money just to brag about it
and sometimes what you do with those things isn't necessarily the best use
people do tend to hoard things they never use, or only use once
that being said
point is, there's always something to do with what you buy
anyway
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~I'll DM you the rest of the list, then~~
nevah
no
if it's just sitting in your bank account, brag about it!
if it's food, eat it!
anyway...
living fixtures that require only *slightly* more care than a plant
exactly
yes
if it's a company, run it!
yup
a millionaire will likely have more money than that they want to save
either way
oh, right
but for a millionaire
which for most isn't an issue at all
true, but the FDIC only insures up to $100,000
they can't just give you money unless they're making money themselves.
and it *is* going to be invested. that's how banks are able to offer any amount of interest at all and still be a business
seriously though, if that money is gonna get invested regardless, you might as well do the investing yourself instead of just taking a miniscule cut from the bank
and that's why savings accounts are bullshit <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
not by a long shot
but it still doesn't beat out investing
technically you can get a higher interest rate if you're saving more money at some banks
if it's even possible at all, it won't happen for a long, long, long, long, LONG time
don't count on it
define "fun" <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
isn't there ads on their youtube videos?
I can see them not charging, but I still feel like they would use ads
servers cost money
but even not caring about making profit off this streaming service, the server expenses would more or less force them to charge *something*
which is honestly quite fair, to an extent
the only way they won't charge is if they shove a bunch of ads down your throat
free service? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah
instead they'd have to pass laws against viewers
since those are Chinese and Japanese-owned platforms, the US wouldn't be able to pass laws against them very easily, if at all
would be interesting to see how the US government handles it if we all moved to bilibili or Nicovideo, though
T-series will likely be fine, though, since they're a big corp (IIRC) rather than an individual creator. And thus, more money and a better legal team to handle this shit
or, more likely, YT actually will take action against Pewds to avoid those fines, and thus Pewds is still affected
even if the FTC can't go after Pewdiepie, they can fine youtube instead for allowing Pewd's to mislabel his videos
YT is still a US company doing business in the US, and is thus under US law
by forcing Youtube to take action themselves
and any other platform that tries to let people who aren't TV networks/Hollywood execs upload content
they can't sue you, but they can still kill off the platform
and like even when it doesn't seem like I've broken anything, it's somehow broken anyway
there's various wires that connect the components to the motherboard
inside the laptop itself
no
but then I turn the laptop on and whatever component that was that I was tryign to plug in doesn't work
and they slide into place seemingly without issue
like, there's these wires in laptops that slide into a holder thingie, right?
and I can never figure out why
I break it
but again
but enough that I should at least be able to handle basic stuff
not extensively
yes I have, actually
I would have to just buy one someone else did
I don't trust myself with that at all
I don't know what it is, but I keep breaking shit no matter how careful I try to be
I'm not good with *any* DIY electonics stuff
though it might also be more expensive. I havne't looked at them at all so I don't know what their pricing is like
a smart lightbulb would still be more convenient for me
but I woudl still want my light on at all times
since I don't necessarily move around that much while sitting at my computer
but that would still be an issue for when I'm gaming and such at night
huh
I....can you buy one that works just plugging it into an outlet?
that way I could leave the light on to see while I'm getting in bed, then turn it off without having to get back up
it would be kinda cool (and useful) if I at least had a smart lightbulb for my lamp that I could turn off with it
yeah, especially with that whole "data collecting" thing
^
welfare income doesn't leave much leeway for expensive shit
so I couldn't connect them if I wanted to :\
but I also don't have enough money to have smart appliances
I don't
but yeah, I just unplug mine when I don't need it. Keeps google from listening in, and also saves on electricity
~~though I suck at taking apart electronics like that without outright breaking them Dx~~
oh, I should do that too
I also unplug it when I don't use it
that's basically what I'm doing with mine
~~they gave me my wiretap for free~~
....actually, is there even any company in the world this big with only one source of income?
big companies like that generally don't have **one** single source of income
like, they've been around for a lot longer than youtube I'm pretty sure, and they did just fine without youtube existing before
and I don't think anyone thought that, either
I mean, no one ever said they would immediately die out if yt disappeared
but are they opposed to the idea of making that extra money for pretty much no extra effort/cost to them?
sure
that's what I was talking about
there you go
free with ads
which so far, isn't a compliment I've received a lot
that's assuming others *do* like it, though
it's something I'd just have to tolerate it because others like it
it's not really something I'd get past without said surgery, tbh
Dx
but god, I hate it
I mean, maybe others like it more than I do
fuck that guy
how did he even get hired to begin with?
get that fucker off my radio
fuck the second voice
no good use of it
god awful
but the second voice?
I would *love* the first one. Especially if they were talking in a relaxed manner. That voice was fucking perfect for it
like, if these two voices were someone else's that I was listening to on the radio or something
not feminine like I wanted, but still a voice I woudl consider "good"
I was still ok with my voice from a few years ago
but my hate for my voice goes well beyond that
I mean, the only other layer I could really think of would be "I wish my voice were feminine"
I've started streaming on Twitch recently, but I almost want to stop because I really don't like my voice Dx
I don't like my voice for *anything*
but now?
like, a few years ago I had a voice that I thought woudl work **really** well for relaxing stuff. Like hypnosis or ASMR or something
but it got worse Dx
I used to have an ok voice a few years ago
nothing traumatic or anything. I just....don't like it
I just don't like how it sounds
but ultimately, it'll still be the same voice
well, sure, you can increase your range and such
but surgeries don't come cheap, and I highly doubt government health insurance is gonna pay for so much as a penny of it
I at least know the surgery exists. There's a trans youtuber I've been subbed to for awhile that had it successfully a few years ago
and there's not really much I can do with my voice without vocal surgery that I can pretty much guarantee I can't afford on welfare income no matter how good I am at saving
'cause even if I get good at it....I fucking *hate* my voice Dx
well actually, I don't think I'd actually want to learn singing
~~singing lessons are cheap, right? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~
if I spend money on developing a new skill, that skill is gonna be something that aids me with my music creation first and foremost
even if I can technically afford it
well it's money I don't wanna spend atm
which means $476 to put towards Japan instead
that's $476 of power and other utilities I **don't** have to pay for
this year I'm getting $476
oh, and I also get energy assistance aroudn this time every year
Idaho Housing, for example, covers more than 50% of my rent for me
and have more help than just social security
I live in a very cheap area
hotels are **amazingly** cheap in Japan as well
a roundtrip flight to Japan, assuming I go on the cheapest airliner at the cheapest dates, is around $400 surprsingly
but still
mind you, that doesn't include household necessities and such
I have $300+ of spare money each month after bills
I'm also saving for Japan, so I want to shove as much money into that as possible as well
I've just barely got in a position where I actually ahve spending money again, and there's quite a bit I want (and also *need*) to get with that money
at least not right now
thing is I don't want to be spending *any* amount of money on  this
Honestly? I might do it for fun if I had someone else giving me free parts to practice on
if I'm gonna try, it's gonna be somethign that no one cares if it breaks
but
I guess I haven't tried on anything bigger before
happened with my old (crappy, lol) smartphone, too :\
hell, even my plan to move to Boise will likely cut into my spendings by at least a small amount
meanign I'd have less help in addition to living in a more expensive area
different states have different state programs, and most states are worse off than Idaho
or a Dallas apartment or Baltimore or any of those big cities
There's no way in hell I would have this kind of money in a NYC apartment
with several state programs also helping out with expenses
I can only have the spending money I have because I live in a government-subsidized studio apartment in Idaho Falls, ID
and big cities cost big money
those are some pretty big cities
like I would go from having $300+ of spending money to being further and further in *debt* each month
and there's no way I could afford to live in any of those areas, either
nowhere near any of those areas
but I have my doubts on that, and it 100% for sure **won't** work here
like, it *might* change if I move to a different community before trying again
I've had nothing but bad luck with these "networking opportunities"
so I'm just fucked
and I don't have that other human
no matter how much stress management you have, at some point or anohter you **need** another human
we're social animals
humans aren't islands
well, even stress management only helps to a certain extent
no one to turn to when I need someone to turn to
that's the biggest issue in my life actually
especially since I have to struggle through everything virually *alone*
but they don't do me much good to handle the stress of actually having the job and actually having to do it
I've already taken all the classes on resumes and interviewing and confidence and whatnot
it's an issue of "I'm suicidal as fuck and don't have the mental capacity to handle the stress of a proper job"
but it's not an issue of income
I think we have programs like that in the US
our pay ain't that great either, for the most part
well, you're probably not gonna have much more luck in the states, quite frankly
I would *love* to be able to have a job, even if I'm making the same amount
and frankly, I'd appreciate it if you'd stop making it out to be so wonderful
and again, this life of bumming off the government isn't the luxorius happy paradise you think it is
slightly more
that's....actualy more than what I make
like sure I might be making more money than you, but am I also spending less?
there's also cost of living expenses to consider
B. this life isn't as amazing as you think it is
A. you live in a different economy
I would get fired before I got better <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
especially not in any formal sense
but I sure as hell don't have the socializing
I might have the emotion
I don't have the social skills for that
I'm terrible at that
oh god no
"client facing"? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
uh
but as far as having any amount of skill at all, I'm pretty good
I mean, I'm probably not "pro" level at it without any practice
it is for me <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I only recall one compliment on my voice, and it was less the voice itself and more the emotion I'm able to put behind said voice
trust me, it's something I've tried
with my mental health the way it is, I'm already quite well aware I can't necessarily go 100% right at the start
I know
that's more than just a few extra months of jail time
oh yeah, there's also the whole "welfare fraud" thing if I spend any amount of my benefits on this
plus the issues of even trying to start a business like that to begin with
they might come save me, but theyre also gonna arrest me for possession with intent to sell and I'll wind up in the prison for probably about the same length of time <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
"911?! These guys are trying to kill me for selling illegal meth on their turf!!"
it's not like I can really call the cops if a competitor sends a gang after me
too dangerous
I ain't gonna
what few customers are around looking for that sort of thing probably already have a dealer
it's a pretty religious community
though I'm not sure a no-name drug dealer would find much business in this area anyway
~~they can't help me become a drug dealer, for example <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~
actually, there's very little they *can't* help me with
and part of those services does including working on self-improvement skills
Assuming nothing else comes up to get in the way, my new services that I've been fighting for for so long are finally starting next week
actually, the stress of trying to work on soemthing like this will probably be easier on me from next week on
<@!102691114762371072> what resources did you use, if you don't mind sharing?
get out of my face, Finches <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
like he is now
especially when he's in my face
petting my cat is pretty easy
or petting this cat in front of my face
except things like being depressed
literally fucking nothing is easy
especially if it "sounds like it totally is!"
life has taught me very quickly that pretty much nothing is easy
I'm not expecting easy
I have my doubts, but if I legit can get a voice I actually like without spending big bucks, I'm not opposed to having my beliefs on the subject challenged
at least from what I've experienced
a lot of masuline leaning words are used also as gender neutral words by some people
I don't even know what command that is
so don't assume things work the same <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> \
your county's government isn't the same as another country's government
people don't like to **work** to make change in the world
and ones that require **work**
this especially true for big changes
no matter how benefiical that change would be to them
all change
Humans are inherently resistant to change
on the "too much of a headache" point.
anyways
.....wat?
it has always had a pretty negative reputation for assholes, and it seems like it's just gotten worse over the years with all the school shooters posting there and whatnot
and I have yet to be given any valid reason for seeking it out
I've intentionally stayed away from 4chan my whole life
someone does a thing, society decides that's a bad thing to do, new rule pops up to say "don't do that thing"
yeah, that's typically how/why rules are made
but we humans sure as hell do
eh.....I think if you were an angel lviing in heaven you really wouldn't even have any concept of "rules"
obviously, we are nowhere near that level
like, if we were actually all perfect angels with no ill will ever, rules would be unneccesary
no rules would be fine if people weren't assholes, honestly
4chan is AMV Hell, but worse
~~sounds like the AMV Hell forums I was a member of for a long time~~
they'll cherry pick only the best posts to repost
and yeah, of course you're only going to see the "good" stuff on sites with moderation
so the wording confused me
"all I see there" implies that you're seeing these 4chan posts on 4chan and not reposted elsewhere
not talking to you
if you don't go to 4chan, how are you seeing stuff *on* 4chan?
especially being in a fairly dark place myself. I don't want to make my mindset worse than it already is
**not** the type of people I want to be around Dx
dwelling on it and doing nothing to be better doesn't help anyone, least of all yourself
then change your behaviour
I think we're pretty well aware of human impact on environment at this point
you may not get a good reference, but future employers will still like it better if you give notice
unless you already have another job/source of income lined up, I would **highly** recommend you not do that
but not all businesses
for most businesses, yes
"hmm, I wonder if I should tell them immigration isn't open on weekends? ....nah, they'll figure it out"
isn't it great when the workers aren't helpful in the slightest?
awesome that they didn't tell you before
~~forced extended vacation~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well not ban but
so their way of solving cyberbullying is to ban potential victims?
wtf?
seriously
like
wtf?
jesus fuck
even if they're gonna force it onto you regardless, at least let your kid have time to prepare for it
still would've been good to talk to you about it beforehand
make sure your parents get none of it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
good
just....work?
like, you're not getting any money?
....that's a shit payment
~~all the more reason not to join the bandwagon~~
keep in mind it's just what they're saying. I haven't seen any proof of it yet, though I also haven't seen proof they're still doing it either
but that remains to be seen if it's actually true or not
Tik Tok is saying that they've stopped doing it
*totally* no one in severe medical debt in my country!
because that has worked out SO WELL for American citizens
though it's not necessarily viable to fix everything all at once, either
placing all the blame and trying to fix just one thing will only really lead to the other problems growing
well, it's a combination of factors, really
it's not people being stupid. It's young people refusing to vote because they think they can't change anything, and then their self-fulling prophecy comes true telling them that they're right and they shoudl just give up
and what are you supposed to be getting out of this deal?
I can see at least 2 problems with that, and that's without knowing anything behind this deal or the politics
produce brought in from another country
just because someone else has it worse doesn't mean your life doesn't also suck
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
and not because of some cursed memes, either
Every day we stray further from god
most accidents are gonna be like, one or two deaths or something like that
yeah realistically speaking, there probably aren't going to be a whole lot of death in each accident
The possibility of beating yourself up over a mistake you made isn't really a good argument
exactly
or some other random, unexpected event happens on the road
or there's a rockslide while you're driving in the mountains
if a pedestrian randomly jay walks without paying attention, for example
also, mechanical errors aren't the only way self-drving cars can get in wrecks
laws very rarely are
the law wouldn't be that simple
well that's the issue
not if the override wasn't activated
once every car is a self-driving car, accidents should theoretically be reduced substantially.
though I feel like most of these situations will mostly happen in the early stages, when the cars are still new and not many people have them
and some situations will be better handled by a human than a robot
sure, but that doesn't mean car accidents will be completely and totally eliminated 100% when you make them self-driving and take the human out of the equation
that being said, all sell driving cars should really be required by law to have an override of some kind.
Instead, you kind of have to generalize. And from the manufacturer's  and probably the driver's perspective, the car's duty is to the driver first, pedestrian second.
There are situations in which it would be better to save the driver, and situations where you would want it to save the pedestrian instead. The problem is that it is nigh impossible, if not outright impossible, to program the car to react appropriately to every possible scenario.
could be happening more often here than I realize
though they do struggle to stay in the lanes sometimes
fortunately my town doesn't seem to do that
and I can't think of anything else they could really use against her, but none of the others
I don't think it was any sort of profiling, either. My aunt isn't exactly the only Caucasian female driver in Idaho.
it's like the police just kinda pick and choose people to pull over at random sometimes
meanwhile there are cars fucking everywhere driving with way more snow on theirs, and no fucking tickets
my Aunt got a ticket for having a **really** tiny line of snow on the bottom of her windshield
and a lot of the times when they *do* enforce the laws, they enforce the really stupid ones
no one follows the laws because no one really enforces them
"A law that's not enforced is not a law"
supposedly we already are
good luck with that
HAH
it'll probably take awhile for them to become available to anyone at all.
and even then, you'll probably be wrong
that depends on a *lot* of different factors that are difficult to properly estimate without having a *lot* of insider knowledge
but even if I had the money immediately, I'd probably wait until version 5.0 at least
I won't even have the money for probably...another reincarnation <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
well you don't want to just automatically absolve them of any and all responsibility, either
which is certainly a difficult thing to do with new technologies bringing in new situations old lawmakers never had to consider.
the laws also need to try and find the person who's actually at fault, rather than just placing the blame on whoever's the most convenient person to blame.
and I don't think we should stop trying to make better, safer technology just because "people will have someone to blame"
I'm not sure how we can really avoid it
but damn do we *love* accepting credit for good things
humans don't like accepting responsibility for bad things
people will always blame someone else, even if they **don't** have someone to blame
No company wants their public image to be "We sell murder machines to crazed maniacs"
And I don't think manufacturers are as cold-hearted as you seem to think they are with no regard to human lives themselves. Sure they probably don't value life as much as you do, but their legal team is gonna force them to think about this stuff one way or the other.
I don't see how self-driving cars that are programmed to obey traffic laws at all times are gonne be **deadlier** than a car driven by a human with no regards to traffic laws or personal safety.

prove that people will be as pissed as you think they will be
prove it
I think you are vastly overestimating how pissed off people are gonna be, Yumi
I'm not saying they should be heartless monsters while creating these things
yes, absolutely. But you also have to be realistic
you can't eliminate the possibility entirely
0 deaths is impossibly, Yumi
he's still gonna do whatever he can to make sure his cars won't kill everyone and create PR disasters
also, Elon Musk still wouldn't his company's public image to be "we sell murder machines to crazed maniacs"
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and catgirl research
sure, but even he with his money has regulations to deal with
the government is gonna have a bit more to say about that
but mass produced for sales?
maybe he'll be able to get ONE PERSONAL CAR on the road legally
and I 100% guarantee there's regulation to deal with
especially if there's even the slightest amount of regulation to deal with
or at all, if he's by himself
I doubt that nerd will get them mass-produced
~~especially since I might want to be a truck driver someday and would like to keep my job <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~
*shrugs* I honestly won't be bothered all that much if we never have self-driving cars
and there's also the possibility of some other, better technology being developed
won't claim it'll happen really soon, though
but that doesn't mean they can't be made safer in the future
For now, at least
I woudln't be surprised if there was also a camera to capture license plates
**down**hill
but there's a thing that tells you what speed you're going, and it's placed right after a hill
I don't know if there's a camera, per se
we have that bullshit here in Idaho Falls, too
I wasn't aware of any such law here in Idaho either until my aunt got that ticket
I don't drive around a lot, since I don't have money for a car
Driver's licenses aren't all that expensive, IMO, but they still cost money. And if you have the kind of budget where you don't know how you're gonna buy food next week....any amount of cost to get an ID is gonna be an issue.
If the bank wants your money (and they pretty much always do), they'll let you verify your ID with other methods if you don't have a driver's license or passport or w/e
NK launching nukes at us means us launching nukes at them
News flash: We fucking won't
unless you think the US will just sit there and take it
and themselves
and kill their people
that "razed ground strategy" will raze their own ground too
but
maybe not 100% for sure
^
since...you know....we'd launch our own right back
I have my doubts on how serious they are about actually launching nuclear strikes
The threat is nuclear warfare but....
it was a perspective I wasn't ever expecting to see in a WWII game created by a AAA company
had you playing as a German soldier defending the homeland
Speaking of Battlefield V campaigns that last one was...interesting
(admittedly, I don't know how accurate the info actually is)
(from what the game told me, anyway)
probably didn't help Norwegians rebels were blowing up all their hard water, either <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so there's no way to create a nuclear weapon of any kind using heavy water?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
outside is gonna be so confused <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hehehhehehe
I ain't your bro, and I don't identify as male <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
also, don't call me "bro" <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
ah
hydrogen fatter?
in shirt?
....D20?
I actually came across a mission in Battlefield V the other day where you're trying to stop the Germans from producing and shipping heavy water, but never heard of anything like it before the game
speaking of heavy water and nazi germany, what is heavy water and how was it supposed to build nukes? 🤔
they leave behind radiation
nukes do a **lot** more than just raze the ground
Nazi Germany didn't use fucking nukes
"If I can't have it, neither can you!"?
....what? what would be the point of nuking your own country?
and neither is anyone else
and yeah, unless Kim is suicidal and willing to take the entire world with him, he's not using his fucking nukes
you're not gonna "raze ground" in one country without any retailiation against your own
and even without allies, just the concept of using nukes agains *anyone* is likely to piss another nuclear country off
and the countries that *don't* have nukes still have aliles that do
see thing is, **no** country with their own nukes is gonna just sit there and take it up the ass
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
I don't know about it
~~I'm pretty sure nuclear steam would just be a bad idea all around~~
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
STEAM
NUCLEAR
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
nuclear steam!
you could tell he wasn't as emotionless as he was trying to appear to be
and the look on that commander's face as his tank drove past German civilians....
They painted the Nazi soldiers as actually being human, like everyone else. Especially towards the end of the campaign where the tank crew started questioning "why are we even doing this?"
it was interesting to see the way they were portrayed in this game
either way
and it's very possible I have played a game from Germany's perspective before, but just don't remember
I wouldn't be surprised if there were a few
They did?
so basically literally be God <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
the only way to really make something 100% safe is to A. be 100% perfect and B. be 100% all-knowing
yeah, it's hard to account for **literally every situation that's even the slightest bit possible**
I'm pretty sure we do have shutdown protocols?
which is sad, because green energy also won't fucking kill everyone and everything around it if it fails Dx
except not build it to begin with <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
just explaining what happened
I don't think Mil was necessarily accusing you of pointing blame
Merry Padoru! (this message brought to you by the MST gang)
~~rip the symbol off before punching~~
symbol good, nazi bad
oof
and frankly, we absolutely should
just because bad people took over a symbol doesn't mean good people can't take that symbol back
but yeah, that's certainly a "I'm better than you" way of thinking
~~I thought it was "born the  winner"~~
there is also the German colors underneath that text, too
though the bottom text kinda sorta almost sounds Christian
again, not sure what, exactly, it's supposed to be saying
kinda
not sure what exactly it's supposed to mean, but it sounds vaugely like something a nazi might think
There's also that writing on the back of the hoodie
but but....the imaginary man in the sky says it's bad!
I am surprised it came so close to being legalized, though (at least in some form)
and the church is **very** much against weed
Idaho is a **very** mormon state
yeah, doesn't surprise me
especially if it passed **both houses of legislature**
we should make another go at it now that he's out of office
well fuck you too, Otter.
Idaho might even be one of those weird "legal to use, but not legal to obtain" states
so I'd need to check Idaho laws
and of course I ain't gonna make any attempts at it whatsoever if there's any risk I'll go to jail for it
I'll for sure have to move before I can. No way I'm finding weed in this community
I doubt Idaho is one of those states where it's legal, though
and frankly, I kinda want to
I've never had the opportunity to try weed
I haven't heard of them making it illegal
wait, illegal? since when?
and even then they'll probably still try as a 3rd party candidate or write in or something
unless the rest of their party tells them "lolno, fuck off already", they ain't gonna stop
politicians that want power don't give up easily
don't think so
the campaigning should start pretty shortly.
November
this year
but....Mars in in space? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
~~we haven't already?~~
~~inb4 Jurassic Park sequel on Mars~~
though would Mars even have any oil?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Mars oil
~~but I'll have spited you, SO THERE!!!~~
~~then invent an amazing alternate energy source that renders my oil invention moot~~
~~one day I'mma invent a way to seperate dino oil from all other oil just to spite you <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> ~~
I don't get what weed has to do with plastic or making companies lose money on it
<@!256945399338631168> and weed is some sort of alternative packaging? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
plastic is made from oil? :O
wait, what?
gonna be real with you here, I don't know what plastic has to do with oil either
....yes?
uh...can someone clue me in as to what's going on?
I've literally never heard of the guy until just now with Trump killing him
If this guy was "plannig to kill Americans" and is an "imminent threat to our national security," why wasn't he all the fuck over my timelines before this?
but we've been affected
maybe not to the point to where our country doesn't exist anymore
and we've been affected by those previous wars
it's incredibly naive to think Americans will just be able to live on like nothing's happening
oh, and some of us **actually give a shit about what's going on**
and spending so much money on a war will affect the economy, which affects literally everyone
some of us civilians are family members of those soldiers getting killed
also, just because we don't get killed doesn't mean we won't be affected at all
~~like increasing congress's wages~~
I mean, if we stop getting into senseless wars the government will have to find some other use of the funds so <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
no possible way this will cost us anything at all whatsoever!
yup, literally zero consequences for us Americans!
and I'm sure literally the entire world will be eternally grateful for us saving them from the evils of Iran!
and who's ever heard of soldiers getting killed?
everyone knows war is super cheap and costs no money at all
oh yeah, we won't be affected at all
you really think there's a **zero** possibility of alien planets run by alien morons?
are you sure about that?
uh
have fun with that, I guess?
so uh
frankly, any alien species willing to do abductions are probably *at least* as fucked up as humans are
bold of you to assume there can't possibly be an alien species as fucked up as we are
New game+ is a fucking horrible idea. We need a better species, not a fresh start for this one
we wouldn't fucking survive long enough to create any sort of society
imagine if we had nuclear bombs as **cavemen**
if anything, we'll just fuck it all up a LOT faster with all the knowledge of modern warfare technology we'd carry over
we'd be just as fucked up as a species in the new game as we were in the first
new game+ wouldn't solve shit
that's not really something you should be publicly announcing, Fig
stop reading so much into it guys
that's it
I'm just saying it's possilbe
I'm not arguing we should do it at all
I'm saying it's technically possible
or even ethical
I didn't say it'd be easy, mel
hard to keep a government going when there's no one to run said government
but if, hypothetically, you kill literally every government leader with air strikes....wouldn't that pretty much overthrow the government?
I mean, technically you can, but it requires a lot more
there will be riots even if Trump *loses* reelection
a youtube channel, I'm guessing?
no I haven't heard of that
I"m more than half expecting it
there would still be *some* ground action, of course
modern warfare is far more an air to ground battle than anything else
^^^^
^^
^
good luck getting millenials to actually pick up their guns and do anything, though
if not outright nuke us all out of existence
waiting until all the old people die/retire gives them more than enough time to fuck the world beyond any hope of repair
the violent option is the only one that's gonna create change before it's too late
~~damnit, rady, stop ruining my Doom fanfic!~~
~~inb4 hell energy~~
~~would a level 6 civilization be one that harnesses energy from different dimensions?~~
oh god, highlighting makes it *worse*
I see
are we even using tetonic forces at all for energy atm?
considering we're not even at a full 1 yet
yeah, we've a ways to go to get to 4
hell, I'll be optimistic and say we might even get rid of the word "war" from our vocabulary by then
if we manage to avoid nuking ourselves, which I honestly believe we will if we manage the current situation alright, I truly believe we will be a *much* better species by the time we reach a "level 4" civilization
I would say we are becoming more and more peaceful overall, even if there is still a lot of violence
we're nowhere near the same people today as we were back in the middle ages, for example
also, humanity **does** change over time
if we're gonna still be around for a **lot** longer after this, we'll *have* to become at least somewhat peaceful
what we are today is on the verge of wiping itself out of existence
well yeah
why would they make you their leader?
...lolwut?
~~and still do nothing about said shortcomings~~
well, not literally all of it, but a good portion
all the medicine that exists
the whole reason you guys want to be adducted is because of how fucked up humanity is, but you're ok with the possibility that the aliens are even more fucked up?
even if they're 1000x worse?
even if they're 100x worse?
^
but it's equally possible they're just as fucked up as we are
yeah, they might be better
humans are pretty good proof of that
advanced technology =/= rational thought
how can you prove they're more rational when you can't even prove aliens exist?
and we are talking factually
sure, but there's still a difference between functionally and factually
wait, we were talking about the inside of a balloon? I thought we were talking about the outside surface <:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
~~until it gets too big and pops~~
there's a reason we don't really create too many battleships in modern naval forces
seriously, no intelligent military is gonna create spaceships that fucking huge when a smaller one can output the same firepower in a harder-to-hit package
~~and unrealistically big spaceships!~~
ah
Roddenberry?
but that relies on the other civilizations accepting the offer
sure, we can do it peacefully
or at least threat of annihilation
again, that usually happens via war
I really hope we aren't that fucking greedy if/when we advance our technology that far
~~usually by war~~
we can't be using **all** energy in any given universe if there are other civilizations using a part of that energy
thing is, in order to become a Type IV or V, we would almost definitely have to genocide entire planets. And there's plenty of other logistical issues
particularly if there are other civilizations within those multiverses already using the energy themselves
though even if we gain the ability to access other universes, I feel like we wouldn't necessarily be harnessing **all** energy from said multiverses
except they very well may be possible
'murica
fuck US militarization <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
reality says no
propaganda says yes
always do your research
^
being treated like shit in say, Japan for example, won't really be any better than being treated like shit here in the US
and I'll still be treated like shit by these other humans
which means I'll still need other humans
I'm still gonna be human
a fresh start isn't going to solve shit
and I sincerely doubt moving to another place will magically change all of humanity
that costs money
and thus, I continue to be condemned and abused by "kind" people
but I can't bring myself to actually do it
I know I need to be
which, despite what many think of me, I'm not
the only way to be happy in this world is to be a fucking asshole and be willing to take advantage of others
too nice for my own good
because I'm far nicer than people realize
they expect me to treat them like they are human and deserve love, while continuing to treat me like I'm not human and I don't
the worst part is how everyone expects me to treat them
that's not even the worst part
I have yet to meet so much as a single person who didn't inevitably turn on me
**EXISTENCE**
**IN**
**EVERYONE**
**LITERALLY**
or B. the ones who only see the good in me because they want to abuse me
A. the ones who only see the absolute worst in me
because literally everyone in existence falls into one of 2 categories:
but reality is, I fucking don't
if I had at least one person I could turn to, I'd be fine
humans are social creatures
and there are way too many people on this very server that agree with him
it's especially painful hearing my own father tell me "You don't deserve to be loved"
it happens with random people online, and it happens with people I know IRL
especially after that twitter RP incident
I am **HIGHLY** suspicious of all of you here
Like, I'm gonna be frank here
Even in the rare occasions people **do** see the good in me, they take advantage of that good and abuse me
I'm at a point in my life where I can't help but wonder if I shouldn't just straight up be the monster everyone assumes me to be and just start treating everyone else the way they treat me
even the "super nice" people of this server have done that on several occasions
People only ever assume the absolute worst in me, and refuse to accept that there's even the slightest possibility that I'm **not** a monster
actually, that's kind of my life in general
but it always blows up in my face
I've tried working things out
which I'm just 100% fucked on no matter what
rping is only fun if you have a good group
though I have no shortage of people who claim they do
I have a very hard time finding people who have any amount of respect for me :|
it also helps if you actually respect each other
I've had chances, but they've never worked out <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
it's ridiculous how many people think that you have to be an all-knowing God about a thing in order to call yourself a "fan" of that thing
and know literally fucking everything about it
or saying you're not a fan of __ because you don't have memorized every random bit of trivia about it
in fact, I should probably be paying just a little *more* attention
I pay very little attention to people who make things, generally :B
I can't control how other people behave :\
that's not anything that's my fault
I just don't usually get that clarification
I do try to ask for clarification, tho
3 decades worth?
previous life experiences?
and again, a lot of people lie or even just dance around the question
I really don't want to have to ask that question in 99% of every conversation ever
not really :|
and I've been around a LOT of people who use "I was just joking!" as an excuse to be a fucking asshole
or even answer the question
except they don't always tell the truth
^
and if people aren't being serious most the time, they sure have a hard time letting me know when they're just joking
hyperbole is fanatical when it's taken seriously :B
and nope the fuck out when it goes too far
just be careful with them
Fandoms should **absolutely** be a part of the experience
so like
and it's nice to talk about stuff you like with other people who also like the thing
and as much as I hate the Undertale fandom, I've seen some pretty fucking awesome undertale animations from said fandom
this is very much a fandom server
like, you're *literally* engaging with the Symphogear fandom by engaging with us here on this server
and like....this discord server we're chatting on wouldn't exist without fandom?
fans come out with some pretty cool stuff sometimes
uh, fandom should be a part of the experience sometimes
ignoring fandoms is a good skill to have
:B
so
and actually, without Undertale I wouldn't have discovered Markiplier, whom is pretty much my favorite youtuber
which is good, because there's absolutely NO WAY WHATSOEVER I would've so much as *glanced* at Undertale if I couldn't ignore fandoms
I do a fairly good job ignoring fandoms
it's nice to have places like this where I don't have to mention Jesus at all and **can still have a fucking conversation**
if you discuss literally anything, you're discussing Jesus
so like, avoiding religion talk with people like that is 100% impossible
they can't talk about literally anything on facebook at all without talking about Jesus Christ
oh, and Idaho mormons are EXTREMELY religiou
so uh
and in the same ward
I mean, we were both members of the same church
HOW IS BLOCKING ALL COMMUNICATION A FRIENDLY THING TO DO?!
"but we're friends!"
and he didn't like how I didn't agree with his religion 100%
he 100% was
he was
that's being a fucking asshole
that's not "friendship"
and don't tell me we'll "always be friends" literally 5 seconds before you block me
don't sit there and ignore me, then claim we're "friends"
but don't sit there and pretend it is when it isn't
I'm ok if it just isn't there
and like if *I'm* putting forth effort in the relationship, is it really unreasonable to ask for them to put forth some effort as well?
I don't think I'm being unreasonable when I expect a friend to actually want to spend time with me every now and then, even if it's just chatting in DMs
friendship is more than just being nice, damnit! <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
even worse are the people who claim they already are friends with me just because they happen to be nice to me
my biggest frustration with making friends is how many people claim to want to be my friend, but then are completely unwilling to actually put forth any effort into being a friend whatsoever
though it's generally not the most successful route to take
well, you can also form friendships just by asking <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it just doesn't work out very often
I do try, True

Never call me fresh unless you're talking about my Splatoon skills <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>

I like scots. I just don't like their bagpipes or their kilts

I actually *do* want a relationship with my dad
except...I *want* to deal with my dad
oh, and wasn't even a part of my life apart from paying child support
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
but sure, I should *totally* have a strong relationship with a Father who called me a monster, told me I don't deserve love, and cut me out of his life
and I'm not getting said love
ignore the fact that I'm inherently owed love because I'm his BIOLOGICAL SON

but never say anything to each other about said things
and sometimes we see things at each other's virtual house
and since blood ties have never really meant much to me.....they're basically just random strangers that kinda just hang around my virtual house :B
I still have a bunch of family on my facebook who I don't even know and have never interacted with :B
I mostly just had him on my facebook list because back then I added everyone I knew when they sent me a request
we were never really "friends" to begin with, TBH
~~while we're the only ones there~~
before the stores open
I've started walking around the mall with my social worker at least once a week
obesity is a very serious issue
exercise is very seriuos
and I need exercise
it's FUCKING COLD
this is very serious
I broke <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
or shopping when the stores open
all the other younglings are there for their jobs
well, the youngest one walking, anyway
I'm always the youngest one there <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
feels weird walking the mall though
though there is a nearby mall for walking
I ain't walking in the FUCKING COLD
COLD
FUCKING
also, COLD
especially when you see it literally everyday
not dangerous or anything. just....not a whole lot to see
I don't live in a particularly great neighborhood for walking
Idaho Falls doesn't really have a whole lot outside of "food" and "more food" and "that one place attached to the resteraunt"

**Princess**
and yeah, I get what it's like when people claim to be "neutral"
these guys must **really** want to be friends with Scott
that's way too damn many
or, what usually ends up happening in my case, outright pretending I don't exist
I tend to be a bit overreactive myself, but I'd rather people try to discuss things with me than just "step on eggshells"
I don't think we have anything like it in/near IF, though
it was a fun panel to watch
and the other guy's sword still bent over a bit and hit the first guy on the helmet
I remember one move they did where one guy blocked a downward swing with his sword
~~also, swords are more flexible than they look~~
like, a *lot* of IRL swordfighting is a lot like wrestling
way more grappling than I thought there'd be <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
IRL swordfighting is **very** different from what I was expecting
ooh, I remember when there was a panel with that stuff at KuroNekoCon!
I know medicaid will pay for a gym membership, but I don't think they'll pay for classes

I'll probably sign up for some sort of marital arts class when I get into better shape
I've never tried alcohol before, but boy have I heard a **lot** of evidence of it not working :B
again, therapist
I already tried talking about it
otherwise my therapist would've solved everything already
talking about it with someone else isn't really going to solve the issues
and it STILL FUCKING HURTS
and it FUCKING HURT
because something *did* happen
I can't just pretend nothing ever happend
and probably aren't going to disappear anytime soon
and have been around *much* longer than me
especially since some of them are a *much* bigger part of this server than I am
it's a matter of being around these people without ever being able to resolve our issues.
it's not a matter of agreeing with everyone
especially with certain incidents that have happened in the past that were never resolved
and I don't see it ever happening
still a long ways to go for that
I assure you I don't "belong" here
there's quite a large difference
and "doing just fine" isn't the same as "belonging"
I mean both
even the places where I *should* belong I fucking don't
and I'm beginning to doubt I'll ever find it anywhere in this fucked up world
it's not fun
I've been without a place where I belong for literally my entire fucking life Dx
it's more people assuming the worst in others than assuming the best in themselves
like, for some reason people can't accept the possibility that others might suck at social situations just as much as they do
people tend to assume the latter, even when they themselves are the former
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they're probably not, BUT STILL!
~~I'm gonna laugh if these are their literal names~~

ball's in your court, dess
if you legit wanna be friends, you should have a pretty clear idea of what path to take to do it
you know by now what my expectations are
ok but still
both in this discussion and privately
we already discussed the issues I have with people just randomly claiming they're my friends, Aya

"buzzkill" is just slang for "person I don't know how to entertain" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah I was sitting here like "wait, 5th year is an *option?!*"
no one ever says something like that unless they intend to guilt
that is 100% guilt tripping
let him know you're willing to listen to him, but only as much as he's willing to listen to you
and remind him that yours are as valid as his are
tell him how he's hurting your feelings by making unreasonable demands
but I don't exactly have any hard proof on that
It almost sounds like there's some sort of ulterior motive. Like he's trying to manipulate you in some way or something 🤔
~~though still not impossible, unfortunately~~
it'll be a lot harder for him to say "your therapist didn't actually say that" when he hears it direct from said therapist
if your dad thinks you're just making up what your therapist says, let your therapist say it to him
will they legit let you attend another year just for the sake of attending another year, regardless of you graduating?
is that even an option at all?
"I graduated and want more classes, but don't want to pay for college just yet"
but just for the sake of more education?
5th year you just go to college <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and, as far as I'm aware, there's no option for a 5th year
US high schools are 4 years
oh, actually I was shocked you could go beyond the 4 years
~~I've been shouted at~~ <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
you guys are both defending your side of the argument so much, it gives the impression you have no intent whatsoever of even trying to change
see here's the thing
if you do intend to just use "they" from now on, why defend **not** using they so much?
and are vehemetly defending **not** doing
which you are refusing to do
we wish for you to use "they"
except your not respecting our wishes
"it's a non-issue to me, so I don't care how much of a problem it is for them"
and that's the issue with your argument
even if you have no ill intent, not caring about other people's feelings is still incredibly rude
<@!431214733463519232> I honestly would've just moved on if you guys weren't defending your side of the argument so much
"Just look at their pronoun roles"
well the discussion would go a lot faster
well sure, but it would be way faster to have roles than to have this discussion everytime a new person joins
there will be others who join the server later who will likley have the same issue as you guys
^^^^
ah
I don't see any green text?
greentexting? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
we're a different community from the others youv'e been in
"they" usually won't hurt people here
use "they" on this server and do your "he/she" thing on other servers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's all
we just want to be respected
^
and now Mel's jumping down my throat for wanting to learn <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
instead of just assuming that they're complete and total assholes
I just wanted to know what other possible reasons there are for arguing the way they did, so maybe I could consider that possibility in the future if/when this same thing happens again with another group
now I'm confused and feel like I'm being condemned over nothign <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I didn't realize it was such a personal question to ask
but there were serveral people in the discussion
why is it that I want to learn more about other people?
why is it bad that I want to understand, though?
or Hime-same
~~call me Princess!~~
Sorry I wanted to clear up confusion on my part
:|
got it
so understanding people isn't relevant
conclusion
and I don't really think anyone else is, either?
at least I'm not
we're not, Rady
that's what gave me the impression you didn't care
and then continue that argument no matter what?
if you guys were intent on trying better from the very beginning, why did you feel the need to argue it ata ll?
I do still have one question
my misunderstanding was why defend it so strongly
nononono, I understand the argument you were making
literally all the time in the world to try
I need to give it a try msyelf
never mind how fucked up most those norms are :|
anyone who breaks the norms is a bad, evil person!
different is scary, and is therefore evil!
being "broken" means your not normal, and society can't handle people being **different**
except to talk about how bad they are for being "broken"
and no one wants to talk about "broken" people
People associate having mental health issues with being "broken"
pointing the finger at an obvious scapegoat is sooooooooo much easier than thinking about a *real* solution
people in general don't like thinking
not just the media
some people can look at violence on a screen and say "this is just fantasy and I shouldn't do this thing IRL" Other people, on the other hand, look at that same violence and say "This is an open invitiation to murder literally everyone I see!"
it's much more to do with the mental state of the consumer than the media being consumed.
which sometimes it does, actually, but not anymore than playing GTA leads to violence
The whole reason loli art is condemned by so many people is because they think said art is gonna lead to actual children getting hurt
Society does care a lot more about protecting actual children
and I don't think it really is
thank you for clarifying
and that's where the confusion came in on my end
so either you worded things **really** weird, or you're condemning others for something you yourself have no issue doing.
You started off basically saying "literally no one should be trying to protect the artwork until we stop IRL child abuse!", but then you turn around and start talking about how we should protect the artwork
> I think the important thing is that we should be dedicating resources to saving actual human beings first before anything else. One man working on protecting fiction is one man less protecting a person.
I'm talking about what you said at the very start
for someone who says "One man working on protecting fiction is one man less protecting a person.", you sure seem to have pretty divided attention yourself.
ok, and now you're suddenly alright with someone also trying to protect art? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Also, people are capable of doing two charities at once
That's just incredibly selfish, IMO
but demanding **everyone** focus on it on the micro level?
Like, I'll agree we should focus our resources on the actual children on the macro level
and why is it such a bad, evil thing if *one* person wants to defend art while everyone else focuses on the people?
I thought we just condemned later
we ask questions at some point? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
It makes social situations *harder* for me, but there's also a lot of it that's exclusively on me
not an excuse
I use my condition as a reason
even worse that we're often isolated and rejected by **other people who have the same struggles**
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I...don't think you did anything wrong here?
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
us
you have
quitting an addiction of any kind is almost impossible without support
get some support
don't deal with it alone
like, humans make mistakes, sure. But **decent people** kinda try to actually learn and improve?
I honestly don't think Pewds is a Nazi myself, but I also don't really think he's a particularly good person either way
a little confusing for me, but not a huge deal
well like I said, it works fine as is
I can only really speak for myself
but I don't know how confusing it will be to others
because confusion
I feel like there should be a separate role for people who go by both, but for now it works fine.
ok then
ah
bigender?
why do you have both he and she pronoun roles? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
also
I thought his PC was broken before that tho
but a lot of the same social rules still apply
^
purposefully antangonizing people to learn their opinions is a **terrible* way to ask for people's opinions
but if it's someone who's been around long enough to know the roles are there....I'll be a bit offended
I wouldn't be offended if it was someone relatively new to the server
"in an orderly fashion?"
Sparkle speaks in the third person
what happened? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
now I"m confused
<:SadBikki:675027390870585354>
where is this even coming from?
hold up
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
but it's truth
maybe
there's no such thing as a good cop
therefore
"evil has no greater ally than a good guy who does nothing"
even the most moral, best cops are just standing by and doing nothing as the corrupt cops get away with everything
there's no such thing as a good cop
don't do it
good
the police are the ones ultimately pulling the trigger
and frankly, I would say the police issue is a **much** bigger problem than the legislation issue.
but we also need better police
we desperately need it
we need it
or they'll fire the officer, and then another police force will hire that same officer somewhere else
most of the time the police force will cover it up
the US doesn't give a shit
they aren't here
regular cops are just about as trigger-happy as the SWAAT
yeah
and it's not enough to just sue the caller **after someone innocent is killed when you could've avoided killing an innocent to begin with**
it is **way** too easy to kill a streamer "for the lulz" or because you don't like them or w/e.
if someone trys to swat a livestreamer, let the regular police go over first and see if there's actually any gunman at all
have other police forces confirm the threat before sending in SWAT
then they shouldn't be able to be called so friviously
they shouldn't be placing their own safety over public safety
Police are supposed to be there to serve and protect *us*, not the other way around
so they should fucking stop blindly trusting callers
well you obviously can't blindly trust callers anymore
shoot first, sue the caller later if it turns out someone innocent died
like, no effort whatsoever on their end to see if maybe the caller is just trying to swat a streamer to be an asshole
it's troubling to me how trigger-happy and eager SWAT are to respond to literally any and all calls with "guns blazing"
evil is raising it's voice louder than ever before
but
sure
quite awhile, yes
I can't just take anyone's word for it
because as much evil as I've seen
**good** proof
but I need to see proof first
I am willing to believe there's a good cop out there
and we won't fucking stop until we get it
and yes, we *absolutely* are fighting for reform
civilians who are fed up with cops
those people are people like me
those people aren't cops
so stop talking like you know everything
you don't know jackshit
so don't tell me it's weak
**very** strong
and it's a *strong* basis
I do have a basis
and stop telling me my beliefs are invalid because *you* think I don't have a basis for them
stop telling me I shouldn't believe what I believe
either prove I'm wrong, or back off
fuck off already
so
with even less basis
you're generalizing me
also
I see a **lot** more than you ever will
I'm **inside**
you're on the **outside looking in**
which of course you fucking wouldn't
just because *you* don't see that basis yourself
you're accusing me of having no basis for my generalization
**prove** I'm wrong
you're not gonna change my mind just by saying "hurr durr you're wrong because I say so!"
stop blindly telling me I'm wrong and **prove it**
show me a good cop then
despite public outcry
and several cases of it just being outright covered up and the cop never getting fired to begin with
I can pull up several cases right now of a cop murdering someone innocent on the job, getting fired, and then secretly being hired somewhere else
I have plenty of credible information
mate
if you want me to change my viewpoint, show me actual legitimate evidence
I mean, it's pretty telling when there's **literally no evidence whatosever outside of people disagreeing**
other than "nuh uh! you're wrong!"
I've yet to see any evidence to the contrary
just because *you* can't frame it in your mind doesn't mean my feelings on the subject are invalid
I have
do *they* not matter?
what about my thoughts on the subject?
good for you
you just told me it's "childish"
you didn't even really try to discuss why I use the term the way I do
and the thing is
just because you use it in a different way than I do
rather than talk about what I was talking about, you nitpicked my use of the term "evil"
well then you engaged me on the wrong thing
and you're using that view as an excuse to dimiss everything I say while using that term
and again, you keep telling me not to generalize while genralizing me
but I do believe "evil" is a thing
well like I've already said I don't view **people** as pure good or evil
who "they" are depends on the specific situation
just talking in general situations
I'm not really referring to anyone in particular
but if I can't, I'm not gonna just shrug and move on
LIke, I'll try to change their mind if I can
and I don't think we should let "them" act on and carry out their beliefs
but I do view certain beliefs "they" have as inherently evil
I don't really view "them" as inherently evil
<@!472513526393602059> thank you for once again generalizing and dismissing my feelings while telling me I shouldn't generalize <:ShirabeStare:675011731801767956>
self-esteem is arguably at an all-time low (though I haven't seen quite as strong proof for this one as I have for the other two)
depression is at an all-time high
suicide is also at an all-time high
and unfortunatley, that tactic is largely working
so evil has to scream as loud as it can to try and get rid of that
and evil doesn't like that
but there's also the fact that there's a lot more social movements than ever before
well there's that
either back to criminal justice reform, or if we're done there something else, I guess
I'll be a lot calmer when we move on
could we maybe....move on?
ON
MOvE
this is a dead end, and we're never getting past it
jesus fucking. LET'S MOVE ON ALREADY
can we please just move on to *actually* serious discussion?
all over fucking schematics you refuse to get over
and now the "evil" discussion has completely derailed the **much more important** discussion
that to me sounds very much like a person who's refusing to listen, and I"m not gonna waste my breathe giving you my defnition a second time only to listen to you define it your way yet again as a dismissal
you keep defining it your own way everytime someone else brings up another definition like as if we didn't hear you the first 20 times
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
fucking hell man
just
forget it
forget
just
but again
I have
everyone has been discussing it for so long at this point, and nothing has changed
and frankly, I don't feel like repeating it 1000x to someone who won't listen no matter what
you're just refusing to listen to mine, or anyone else's
YES I HAVE
you talk like my definition is unsalvagable
and why is it such a bad, **evil** thing to accept that maybe other people define it differently and that their definitions are just as valid as yours?
can someone explain that to me?
how is this **not** generalizing?
I just
jesus
people have told you several times in several different ways that there's more than one way to define evil
and it really seems like you're stuck on **your** definition
people have other definitions of the term, Anan
and not at all what I meant
that's not what "evil" means
not at all
no
and certainly not happen overnight
but it sure as hell ain't gonna be easy
I do believe it can be
I never said anything about how it can't be reformed
and again, please teach me how to do things right
you need to take a step back and look at my and Saki's entire history
yes she was, Likly
I'm sorry that I'm having a hard time understanding people
and Saki **outright was** attacking me. She has been actively hostile towards me since I joined
it *does* feel like I"m being attacked
frankly
and when people tell me I'm doing something wrong, but don't tell me how to do it right
that's not my intention
I"m not trying to
ok so what, I'm not allowed to discuss things at all now?
schematics I'll probably never understand
and once again this conversation is getting derailed over schematics
I don't understand what the intention here is
I don't understand what's being said
or point out why it's an extreme view, like it's intended to be?
so...I'm not allowed to disagree with the phrasing of things?
that's literally it
that's it
I was just continuing the discussion
I wasn't saying it as "hey fuck you for thinking this way, Emily!"
but still
I mean I was
so I don't really understand why point it out? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
literally just continuing the conversation
I wasn't telling her "fuck you" or anything like that
I didn't need anyone to point it out to me
I saw it
then why mention it?
...and that means I'm not allowed to disagree with anything she says?
Easy/simple =/= pure
"purest". That's not pure at all, that's just "easiest"
but we shouldn't get rid of the notion entirely
nor even **mostly** punishment
well the system shouldn't be pure punishment
and those people deserve some form of compensation
reality is, people were hurt
yes it shoudl
~~maybe I'll finally have some of my fanfic ready for release too, lol~~
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
meanwhile HUGS FOR EVERYONE
I hope that when I return, I don't make your jobs any harder than they already are
<@&336302034070536192> Thank you for all the work you do here. I deeply appreciate it, even if sometimes the banhammer was swung in my direction (justifiably so)
Before I go, though, I do want to say one more thing:
After chatting with Lily and putting some thought into it, I've decided it's best for me to leave the server....at least temporarily. I've been extremely emotional several times here, and that's something I need to work on with my counselor for awhile so I don't keep unintentionally hurting everyone around me over what have mostly been comparatively petty disputes. I'm gonna work on recognizing when I'm getting overly emotional more quickly, and how the calm the fuck down. When I've made some good progress on that, I'll come back and hopefully be able to converse with you all again without turning more anthills into mountain ranges
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
so even if you did understand it the way I wanted you tell, if you were to actually explain to me how you understand it I'll probalby think you misunderstood it
because so much of what I intended I don't know the words for
I honestly can't really tell you if you understood it the way I intended
but that vauge definition doesn't work adequetly for such a complex topic
at best I can just give a rather vague, basic version of the definition
that's my problem with trying to define reformation. I have a definition, but I don't know how to properly put most of it into words
but yeah, there needs to be healing from the justice system, or it's not actually all that helpful
speaking from personal experience here
and when someone is hurt, healing is the most important thing
it just creates a whole lot of hurt and absolutely no healing
eye for an eye doesn't work
well yeah
but I do *strongly* believe reform should be first and foremost above that regardless
because my definition is vague and even I don't fully understand it
I couldn't tell you
how much?
but I also feel like there needs to be some amount of punishment
I have a definition for that, and believe in it **very strongly**
the reform part is easy
which honestly makes the whole "reform vs punishment" thing very hard for me
well first of all, I actually don't really have a set definition for "punishment"
can I make another point about the punishment vs reform thing?
and....I still don't know how to continue?
ok so I took a step back and read the chat logs
It seems like everytime I ask for clarification, people condemn me for wanting clarification
instead of just telling me what I'm doing wrong and telling me I'm bad for doing them
and even if it ends up taking you 12 months instead....don't beat yourself up over it. Reevaluating goals as you go along is an important part of goal-setting
and again, have someone help you with this
and if you find you can do it much faster than that while you're doing it, then set another goal after the first song with a stricter timeline
if you can't accomplish the goal of "make an awesome song in 10 seconds", then make a much more realistic goal of "make an awesome song in 10 months"
it's you telling yourself "I can't" that sets the bad expectations, not the goals
since when are goals evil?
how is that a bad way to live?
and have someone help you with goals now to get to that later
then think about how awesome you'll be later
and honestly? people who have to **develop** talent tend to actually do better in the long run than people who are "naturally" talented
creativity is a skill **anyone** can develop
Then take Yumi's advice into consideration
this applies to pretty much everything, btw. not just music
if you're just doing it "because".....you ain't gonna accomplish shit
if you have the passion for it, you'll have a **much** easier time overcoming obstacles to gain the skills you want to gain
how passionate are you about music?
there is a **very** important question you have to ask yourself, though
creativity is a skill you can develop
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
hopefully they'll pull through ok
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
that's.....not good
you'll have to either wait until your own bank tells you you have a pending deposit, or wait until the IRS puts up the form on their site for checking the status (which I'm hearing is supposed to be up on the 17th)
having the link won't do anything for telling you about your own direct deposit.
I'm pretty sure he's talking about his bank account's website
Actually, I mainly filed my federal because the site I used to file taxes wouldn't let me file my state without also filing federal, and I **did** get a refund from my state taxes thanks to a super awesome tax credit I qualify for
I didn't get a refund, but I still filed my taxes to update my direct deposit information. Plus I'm on SSDI, and they're pulling our info from SSA. So there's 2 ways for the IRS to get my info
I see
O_o
wait, how do you know that?
From my understanding, they're starting to process the payments today, though that doesn't necessarily mean it'll be in your bank account today
schools can block emotes if they have to
why do people use zoom?
like, at all
that sounds....not good
oof
but sometimes you don't really have much of a choice
neither am I
People here *will* forgive you, but sometimes part of forgiving someone is calling them out, telling them their behaviour is wrong and asking them to change said behaviour.
If you feel like you absolutely positively just can't NOT immediately attack this person when you see him, then just block him and don't look at any of his chats
and lemme tell you from personal experience....no one's gonna take your side on this
I'm gonna level with you here, and understand I mean this in the most polite way possible: but you sound like you're passive aggressively *trying* to stir up drama in a way that you can make yourself out to be the victim
humans in general like to go where they are welcomed
Trans folk will naturally show up more in trans-friendly places
we don't have any real need to hide that we're trans
this server is very welcoming for trans folk
The Great Khali was woefully underutilized
of course, he does have a bad history with "monster" characters in general
It feels like Vince has some sort of personal grudge against Braun or something
I really don't like how WWE has handled his character
all those times he got screwed out of title shots he rightfully earned....
and Braun actually gets to hold a singles title for once now!
that was also a good match to watch
golberg ended up fighting Braun instead
I mean, I like Reigns, but let other people have a shot now and then too!
I actually liked watching Drew McIntyre take the title instead
especially when you have AEW PPV's doing equally good matches
and how good Wrestlemania was doesn't really justify anything
but definitely different
still fun to watch overall, imo
WWE is turning a lot of fans off nowadays, it seems
but now I mainly watch AEW and a couple indies
I kinda sorta do off and on
yeah, I barely keep up with WWE now
~~they can always go to AEW~~
I'mma bow out regardless, especially with how emotionally charged you're getting right now
but sure, go ahead and think that
that's not what I'm saying dunkek
and discussions like this with a minor is....probably not the best idea
yeah uh, I feel like that pic might actually get deleted by mods
sure, but isn't that still porn?
wait, what do you masturbate to if not porn? Just....do it for the sake of doing it?
then find a better therapist
I'm pretty my case is just depression, though
I didn't realize there were professionals that specialized in dopamine receptors 👀
oh right, I forgot about the Russia/opec thing
lots of supply, no demand
and thus, people aren't buying gas
people aren't traveling
not just political labels, but pretty much *all* labels
labeling in general does that
it's hard to have any positiivity when you go through a lot of hurt and not a lot of healing <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I've learned a lot and I'm still a negative person to be around :B
luckily I've had a few that have changed for the better as well
Dx
I hate it
most my friends seem to change for the worst
I have Asperger's Syndrome. My brain processes information differently from pretty much everyone else. And as such, there are some things I'm more sensitive to than most people
I'm not expecting a perfect relationship. I'm expecting my partner to understand I don't handle "friendly" bickering as well as most people
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
||<#407060923078017026>||
but I'm **not** ok with it in **my** relationship
I won't tell them they're not allowed to do it in their relationship if they're ok with it
it's fine if they're ok with it
especially not with someone super close
I don't like that kind of "friendly" bickering
If my wife ever does that to me....well I would dump her as my gf before we get married to begin with
that's the problem with the argument. It has validity in certain circumstances, but it's not used in those circumstances
or at least, not in my personal experience
sure, but again, those aren't the instances in which the argument is used
"It's ok for me to be an asshole. *you're* the one at fault for not being ok with me being an asshole!"
That argument is mainly used by assholes to justify being assholes
form religions around their political beliefs
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<#337805317276565525>!
this is no different from you liking Symphogear despite Ver
no it's not, wfc
I despised every second of rape in GS, but still enjoyed the rest of it
which Ver is a part of
but you still like Symphogear
^
You, for example, are a fan of Symphogear despite Ver being a thing
you don't have to like literally every aspect of a thing to be a fan of that thing
yes they would, wfc
I know plenty of GS fans who don't like the rape
you know, it *is* possible to enjoy the fight scenes and such in GS without also saying the rape is "ok"
with that said, I'll lead by example, so to speak, and head for the store now
I think we all need to take a step back and calm down before any more conversation
far worse than wfc here calling me a cunt for watching GS
and frankly, it really hurt me
I recall at least twice you've called me a hypocrite in the past to dispel my arguments
you've done that several times to me, Mel
one in particular late in the show was....particularly disturbing to me
there was actually multiple instances of it, Cocoa
probably for the best that way regardless
eh, I'm done with it anyway. I've already said what I needed to say and if wfc wants to block me w/e
they're name-calling worse than I am
and wfc's behaviour is acceptable?
and neither is anand or anyone else
I'm not the sinner you think I am
so go ahead and judge me. In the end it's *you* who will be condemned for it
I'm not the asshole here, you are
at all
I didn't come to GS for the rape
no it's not
the best solution to that, anand, is to recogize that as quickly as possible and just bow out of the convo
I'm seeing a scary amount of my own past behaviour here <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
well you don't have to be 100% Libertarian to call yourself a Libertarian
I'm also mainly Libertarian, for the record
so....basically Libertarian <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah, Twitch is used for a lot more than just gaming now
Amazon tends to use UPS anyway
I"m sure **that** will do *wonders* for our economy
over 600,000 new umemployed Americans if the USPS shuts down
one of the biggest employers in the US, for one thing
and none of the politicians seem to care about saving the USPS
if the USPS dies....we're fucked in more ways than one
that's another huge problem with this
:|
Trump is killing the USPS
oh wait you can't
go out and put your vote in the mailbox
yeah
or at least not very hard atm
nobody's really actively campainging
the elections haven't really even started yet?
not to mention actually winning elections when no one knows about your party
perfection simply doesn't exist
no one party is 100% good
that's true as well
I call myself a Libertarian not because I agree with them completely, but because they're the ones I agree with **the most**
just as you don't have to lean 100% right to be Republican
all language is hard to keep up with for me
I mean, aren't we all part of "**them**"?
people get too stuck in **their** beliefs and what **they** interpret the truth as being

~~inb4 they're not acceptable anymore~~
even just "standard" language
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
sorry, didn't mean to entirely derail the convo. Was kinda hoping it would go quicker than that
*some*
that's just being poor
that's not acting out of ignorance, as you said
they might have all the knowledge in the world about what foods to buy, but then see how expensive those foods are and realize "I don't have the money to buy these foods, even though I *really* want to"
well again, I wouldn't necessarily say Person B is being ignorant
I think you and I have different definitions of "ignorance"
or a **myriad of other reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with ignorance**
or because they have a disability
There are plenty of incredibly intelligent people who don't have jobs simply because society has deemed then "unfit"
sometimes all the smarts/wisdom/etc in the world still can't get you what you want/need from the world
and while being ignorant can certainly lead to having no money, there's far more ways than that to *not* have money
that's **lack of money**
that's not ignorance
some of those foods are fucking expensive
it's an issue of affording them
it's not an issue of researching the right foods
Just to point out, Person B isn't really being ignorant. As you put it yourself, they just don't have the luxury of worrying about the environment because poor
just as it's not mine or anyone else's but your own fault that you have such an extreme mindset
you can't be blamed for someone else' refusal to listen
not even close
no you're not
no
you can't just hug and talk things out all the time
this isn't a magical girl anime
and sometimes they *will* listen, but only after you **forcibly** remove them from their high horse
in reality, some people just don't listen, no matter what
but reality is, that doesn't always work
I adore Hibiki for that
everytime
don't get me wrong, I would *love* to just talk things out
and by "fun" I mean "severe dissapointment"
you're gonna have so much fun in the real world with that thinking, Lec
lol, good luck with that
I don't know how else to express **extreme** agreement
sorry but
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^
^^
^
not even close
it's not "sinking to their level"
ngl, that sounds like a terrible moral compass
you just stand by and do nothing while people suffer?
you just sit there and *let* terrorists blow up the hospital?
so you just sit there and *let* yourself and others be killed?
I would recommend not having such absolute beliefs. There are exceptions to every rule, and it's important to account for those exceptions
but it's still starting violence
I guarantee the 5 who die with you will condemn you in the afterlife for not being willing to endanger the 5 terrorists
and those are the 5 that would get away with it
5 of those people are people who **should** be endangered
"Evil's greatest ally is a good guy who does nothing"
non-action can be just as deadly to others as action
except you are
I'm kinda getting the impression that maybe you're just afraid of violence or something?
lec, are you really **that** hard on your belief that you'd be "stooping to their level", or is there something deeper?
if someone points a loaded gun at my head and refuses to "talk things out", I'm kicking their ass.
~~and technically that is still very possible with enough money and the right leadership~~
or any sort of perfect utopia
literally no one but you mentioned building some perfect gay luxury space communism or whatthefuck ever
and you yell at us about building strawmen
who even said that?
waht?
"We should talk things out" "That doesn't work" "STOP THROWING STRAWMANS"
we were all refuting the points you were bringing up
wait a minute, what strawman?
isn't that what you're doing too, tho?
wants people to talk things out, but responds to people not blindly accepting his views by running away <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
again, you're the one that needs to be more accepting. Hugs and smiles won't solve everything, but that doesn't mean all violence is inevitable and we should just sit there and take it
and there are times in life when things *can* change, but people are too stuck in your kind of mindset to try and change them
but hey, if life experience is the only teacher you'll listen to.....
just....trying to save you from yourself, I guess
not really
and you're gonna learn that *very* quickly one way or the other
you're the one that needs to accept you're not living in an anime
stopping a crime isn't "attacking others"
defending yourself isn't "attacking others"
if you guys don't like the convo, you can always leave it :|
if anything, you'll be called a coward
I can tell you right now, very few people will praise you for your decision
it's really not
it's not, Lec
"Evil's greatest ally is a good guy who does nothing"
which is just as evil, IMO
and also stood by and did nothing while others were hurt
sure, but you don't know that for sure
and it's just as valid as yours
sure, but it's still an example
you're forgetting about the 100,000
I really do
I do too
but again, that detail isn't the most important part
and of course, I could also be remembering wrong
I think it was the pentagon, but either way the point is the same
but again
and that's good
and sometimes, you *have* to hurt some people to prevent hurt on others
you're **going** to hurt people
even if you never intend to hurt anyone
it's 100% impossible to live life and **not** hurt people
whether you try to or not
you're gonna hurt people lec
you could always try to knock them out instead of killing
well for all you know, you might be able to save everyone **including** the terrorists you're oh so worried about
"for all you know"
if you stop them from killing people, yes it does
5 vs 100,006
100,006
wait no
it's still 5 people vs 100,000
and even removing innocence from the equation
well your moral compass is fucked up
it **absolutely** does
yes it does
wtf?
but if you stop the terroists, 5 **terrorists who are actively trying to kill people** die instead
if that device goes off, 100,000 **innocent** people die
let's say there's a nuclear device they're trying to activate while they're holding you all hostage
if you don't hurt the terrorists, the terrorist will hurt you, 5 other **innocents**, and probably a hell've lot more people than that
**who deserves to be hurt**
but if you have the ability to stop the terrorist from hurting people, you shouldn't just sit there and take it
most of the time you actually will need to just sit there, at least for awhile
sure, but if you have the ability to do something, you absolutely should
oh yeah, I can load images in my browser
Jesus chr- IT'S STILL LOADING
I press the button that forces you to just tell us what it is <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
good counterpoint Rady! ~~fuck you Discord~~
ah yes, the forever loading image!
and again, question things
talk with your counselor about it
and I hope you can work through it
I would say it most definitely has
If someone points a gun at my face, I'm defending myself. Not because I deem myself more worthy, but because they deemed me unworthy.
you don't have to think someone is "more worthy" to defend yourself
and yes, consider the source as well
and grow
that's how you learn
always question
and question ours too, quite frankly
you should **absolutely** question your morals if they're coming from someone trying to shelter you
it really isn't
no it isn't
morally grey requires "wiggle room", so to speak. Absolutes leave no wiggle room whatsoever. And thus, no morally grey
you're thinking in absolutes. absolutes are **never** "morally grey"
you're putting the world into a box to avoid putting the world into a box
pretty much as black and white as you can be
that's like, *incredibly* black and white
that's being black and white
that's not being grey
uh
you're starting to exude some "holier than thou"
what are you trying to say here, lec?
so we're all evil pieces of shit here and you're the only good guy or what?
"just as bad as anyone"
the difference is he knew when to protest, and when to revolt
and my point was he *did* defend himself at times
but those were different circumstances
Sure
and even he, as amazing as a person as he was, occasionally defended himself
Son of God or not, he was one of the best men to have ever lived
and it's not about whether Jesus was "special" or not
yeah, he threw a table
if you think you're better than Jesus...you're in for a rude awakening
Even Jesus defended himself from time to time
and here comes the "holier than thou art"
and frankly, it's quite rude
sitting there condemning other people for having a conversation doesn't help anyone
and again, if you guys don't like the convo, don't participate
you're seriously telling me 9/11 was "small scale"?
terrorism is never really "small-scale"
honestly though? If I were faced with that IRL I'd probably end up freezing in indecisiveness rather than following any sort of moral code.
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and of course, it's the fucking trolley problem
especially if you think they might be acting like a creep
like I said, try talking to them about how uncomfortable it makes you feel.
I don't really like it, but I don't block them over it
I have friends who sometimes randomly change their behaviour like that as a joke
then don't
tell them how you feel, and that you're thinking of blocking them
I think it might be overreacting a bit to block them over it
Ultimately, you can't help anyone unless they're first willing to *be* helped
you can't
it's honestly not that hard of a word to figure out
I think most people know what it means, Rady
and very few use "discriminative"
I hear almost everyone use "bigoted"
~~wait, that means I have to prove it to myself first~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
off to prove no one matters!
that makes much more sense
just because ONE person said a thing?
you would keep the same actions, but your thoughts behind the actions would completely do a 180?
like, literally *no* resistance to the idea whatsoever?
so if I said "no one matters", you would change your beliefs on a dime just like that?
also, why?
is it?
that's not the only political extreme you can take with "don't care about others"
not necessarily
with how complex humanity is, and how many **individual personalities** exist, I"m not sure a "right for everyone" even exists at all
and good fucking luck with that
in order to do what's right for everyone, you first have to define what's "right for everyone"
so you're not missing out on any free moneyz
I would recommend looking into it
and I do mean **constantly**
But seriously, about the only way to break a mindset is to **constantly** challenge it
~~start playing Sports games!~~
if he continues ignoring you and continues making you uncomfortable, it may be best to cut ties with him
all I want is for you to stop calling me "insensitive" when I *do* slip up
sorry I was born with Asperger's and don't know how to properly communicate all of my feelings at all times
calling me insensitive
and there you go again
the fact that you percieve me as being butthurt tells me you really are attacking me
and the whole "Christ Aria, calm down" really makes me feel even more like I'm being attacked
but I really don't know how better to explain it
well I"m sorry I used the term "weird"
I fucking can't
I can't right now
but I just
I'll be back, Matt
anyway, I"m gonna take another break from the server for awhile. This is the 2nd time *today* a **minor** argument got blown out of proportion and I am not in the mental space to handle it all right now
and I appreciate that
and what I was tryign to say
and that's the issue
except I can't immediately know that upon first meeting someone
and I don't like being hurt
if you use hurtful words, I **will** be hurt
I respond to honey far better than I respond to vinegar
don't even say "that can be taken as insensitive" Just tell me there's a better way to word it
I have a hard time with social skills, and frankly, I'm trying my best.
because frankly, that's rather insensitive yourself
~~and again, <#371105434771390465> guys~~
Nichibros?
:B
this discussion kinda went into <#371105434771390465> territory awhile ago
you know
but you can also go to jail for making a death threat against some rando who like, cut you off in traffic or something
it probably does
If I start talking about how I want to kill the President and start talking about plans and such, I'll go to jail even if I'm "lol, jk"ing
as far as I'm aware, yes
freedom of speech was **never** intended to protect assholes from being called out
even the President can legally say "hey fuck you too!"
people can still disagree with you
it's solely limited to *not* going to jail for saying things like "I disagree with the President's policies"
^
<@!193408538909868033> yes, and even then there's certain types of speech that the government can still shut you up over
I've met very few people that appeared good, and later turned out that yes, they are actually good
"good" people turn out to be assholes and assholes turn out to be.....assholes
I've seen this time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again
even the "good" humans tend to not be as good as they appear
Humans are inherently evil, with **very** few exceptions
**one** person being nice doesn't justify a million people wanting to genocide each other
the best human out there doesn't make up for all the shit ones
one good human out of a million does not a superior species make
<:ShirabeStare:675011731801767956>
foxes aren't the ones fucking up the world and being toxic, bigoted assholes to each other
look at foxes
and much better than humans
they are adorbs and cuddly and cute
Fennec Foxes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
or foxes
so now he's healed up enough that they can formally make the arrest?
I remember that
right
ah
or was it just that they knew who they were looking for?
did I just remember wrong? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
I could've sworn they had him immediately after the fire
so Trump then
~~was it Trump?~~
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
genocide all humans and let nature have her planet back
Make Earth great again
90% of what a cop does in an interrogation has nothing to do with finding the truth and everyting to do with getting a confession out of you, whether you did it or not
that's one of the biggest problems wiht the US system. The police don't care about catching the criminal. They just care about catching someone they can make *look* like the criminal so they can pat themselves on the back and say "we did our jobs! horay!"
worse than the US system, and there's no way he'd get a pass in the US system without being a damn rich celebrity or something
yeah, that's what I understood
yeah
this has all the markings of a solo job
not that we know of, but unlikely there's one hiding somewhere
and caught on camera carrying gas
way too much evidence of a way too fucked up crime
from what I understand of the Japanese criminal justice system, even a *really* good lawyer can't save him
and he won't really be "free" then either since he'll be on the run for the rest of his life either way
I don't see this guy walking out of a jail a free man ever again without breaking out or something
at absolute least he's a candidate for life inprisonment
that's why humans tend to be resistant to change, even good change
whether good for you or not
and can be very painful
change is hard
that's drama in general, really
I don't really like ripping into youtubers, but when you make money off a channel called "drama alert"....
the rioters are literally **hurting their very allies**
residents who had nothing to do with the murder, and who are even all about blacklivesmatter
but because of the rioters
not because of the cops
Oh yeah forgot to mention, a lot of Minneapolis residents are now **scared for their lives**
all while patting themselves on the back and calling themselves "heroes"
you might get the results you want in the end, but you'll do it in a way that causes far more damage than you needed to
**ever**
I understand the anger, but blind rage is **never** ok
totally no influencers posting on social media about it
oh yeah sure, no one is listening. Totally no one donating money to the memorial
the protestors just want to protest without getting hurt
nevermind the fact that it's the government at the root of all this
these protestors are cowards, plain and simple. The government is too big and scary to target, so they target the privlidged whites who can't fight back as easily.
unemployment does wonders for paying your bills!
oh, and I bet all his minimun wage workers who are now OUT OF A JOB are super happy about all this
because rich people aren't human and have no feelings, amirite?
it's ok because they're rich
oh of cousre
well, anyone and everyone but blacks. gurantee you won't see black businesses burned to the ground
people are just lashing out at anyone and everyone
don't go targeting random businesses just because they're less likely to use tear gas on you
so riot against the police
or the autozone?
The governor seems genuinely upset this happened as well.
it's how you fuel the fire to even more hate and even more racism
rioting/looting isn't how you make a point
either way, this whole thing is getting **completely** out of hand from both sides
https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/05/tv-crew-released-from-police-custody-after-they-were-arrested-live-on-air-in-minneapolis/
just pointing out there were 2 other victims
it's alright. I wasn't mad at you or anything.
and let's face it, the **only** reason they released him so quickly was because of the lawsuit CNN would've hit them with otherwise
> it was a single black reporter who was arrested on tv
<@!284390402210136064> It wasn't *just* a single black reporter. It was a black reporter and 2 other crew members who were with him.
<:SammyShrug:544660008441479179>
guess not
but I did think they at least owned the ships they were dumping the tea off of
I don't think it would've meant anything if they were just dumping their own tea
that I know as well
and the way I was taught it was....wrong
look, I know very little about the "boston tea party"
....I'm gonna be honest, I didn't know they broke into the ships
dumping tea in the harbor is nowhere near the same as burning a business down and looting
but hate is jsut so much easier
I've seen them work
peaceful protests **do** work
they just don't have **instant** effect
peaceful protests have effect
I'm not
and I'm sick of people saying I don't support blacks just because I think there's a better, more peaceful way to save their lives
this isn't protesting racism. This is blindly lashing out
and this is **not** the way to solve anything
I'm saying both sides are evil
I'm not making this about white persecution at allk
and the other path requires work and time
but no one wants to do it because they're blinded by hate
there's a **better** path
there's another path
I'm concerned with both
I'm not more concerned with that
and it's not okay rioters are using that racism to justify EVEN MORE RACISM
not in the slightest
at all
it's not ok
I knew going into this there was no way things were gonna remain civil, but I had to say it. I can't just sit by and let you all pretend your good people and that this is all ok
y'all are far more disgusting than you falsely percieve me to be
and everyone else in support of these riots
go fuck **your**self
lets attack all whites, including the ones that support us
all whites are evil
fuck whites
oh yeah, it's ok because they're white
and in various other places
and on discord
residents who've posted on social media
^^
^
but that still doesn't justify the looting
and yeah, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it's true
yes, I"ve heard that conpiracy
and using "the ends justify the means" to act like you're still the good guys
you're just hurting innocents
lashing out isn't the answer
those places had nothing to do with it
the Autozone?
but the Target?
sure they eventually burned the police station too
they are lashing out
no
the racists who are actually doing the killing?
the government?
the police, maybe?
like, I dunno?
and if you're so set on violent protest....why not protest agains the people **actually at fault**
blind rage is called "blind" for a reason
it's the **one** thing anyone can see
it's not the **one** thing that can be done
you think I can't see what's on the news?
it's not denial, Lec
which isn't even close to the truth
you've even blatantly told me I'm "more concerned with the feelings of whites than the oppresion of blacks"
You're all making very errerounous assumpitions about me and what I believe simply because I disagree with you
I'm really not
I'm not
I'm sorry you feel like anyone who disagrees with you is automatically wrong and evil
and I'm sorry that upsets so many of you
but I will **never** agree that it's the correct path
I'll agree that violence was inevitable
I'm genuinenly saddened that so many are so blind
sorry you're so offended by that
I'm just disagreeing with your path
I'm not at all downplaying
but this isn't how you heal
I'm well aware of that
sorry I don't give in to hate at the drop of a hat
sorry that I'm more compassionate
sorry that I'm a pacifist
honesltly, it's kinda sad you guys are so against my opinion, that you feel the need to consider me a bad person for having it
I thought you were fucking off, Emily?
they didn't keep the tea for themselves
also, destroying tea isn't the same as looting the tea
maybe also try some meditation
and if no game does that, find some music or a book or a movie or something
find a game that doesn't **add** to the stress and instead helps take **away** from the stress
well again, find soemthing else to destress with
don't yell at me for trying to provide advice you specifically asked for D:
:B
then find something else to destress with
well
<@!237964037898502144> I would recommend maybe giving up on PSO2 for awhile and maybe trying again later
well keep in mind there's also gonna be a*lot* of unconfirmed rumors and such
target should have **given** them milk
hell
I will say Target should've let them buy milk
I mean...they were wanting to **buy** the milk, correct?
which is fucked up
:|
and bad news is where the moeny's at
it's not bad news
it's not something the news would report on
I havne't seen that, but I'm not really all that skeptical of it either
and honestly, even if the burning is actually secretly being done by the cops, it's still being supported by the protestors and so many others
2 wrongs don't make a right
but so many innocents are gonna get hurt until then
and it eventually will
violent protests work when **and only when** they reach the root of the cause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
BUT FIRST
....I think I should shut up. I feel like I'm derailing the convo and adding nothing to it
~~fuck humanity~~
~~which I'm honestly rooting for at this point in my life~~
~~not if everyone's dead~~
I automatically love people and it ends up bad regardless :|
it's a popular meme largely in part because of how many people **geniuinenly** feel that way
but they also just recently made the vent channel so
well I actually ahven't vented in the other server yet
~~two servers, even~~
~~which is heavily ironic considering I'll vent on a public discord full of people I don't know that well~~
especially to talk about very serious/personal things
and no offense Mei, but I don't really feel comfortable dm'ing people I don't know that well
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
>  irregardless
I don't know about you, but I remember the struggles my friends go through
> it's not like it's someone's personal issues that are going to be easily forgotten. 
<@!213645184125239317> oof <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
well it seems like the previous discussion is paused/over atm so I'd say go for it
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I just fucking don't
I don't want to hear her justify the police's actions
I just.....I already don't want to fucking deal with it
and I already know what she has to say about it
and that means I'm gonna have to hear what she has to say about it
what sickens me most is at some point or another I'm gonna have to be around my Aunt
one of the largest reasons people are so enraged is because of how often the cops walk away
a slap on a wrist and a "you can't be a police officer anymore"
frankly, the punishment will likely be the same regardless of what he's charged and convicted with
not talking at all about the viability of any charges
I was also simply providing more info
also, there's apparently video of 2 of the other officers *also* placing their knees on him
from the court document: "Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."
and yeah, I've yet to see any evidence backing up the claim that he was resisting at *any* point
the force was excessive either way
even if he *was* initially resisting, he fucking stopped
"If convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, Chauvin would face up to 25 years in prison on the first charge and up to 10 years on the second." yeah, if the judge actually gives him the sentencing he would get as a civilian
according to this article, the officer is also being charged with 2nd degree manslaugther
I'd prefer a romantic relationship but really I just want a relationship PERIOD
senko-san is <a:MofuMofu:675012179036078103>
"MAN, I BET  YOU WISH YOU HAD A FOX WAIFU LIKE THIS. TOO BAD YOU NEVER WILL BECAUSE YOU DON'T DESERVE HAPPINESS, HAHAHHAHA"
"HAHHAHAH, LOOK AT ALL THESE NICE THINGS YOU'LL NEVER HAVE!!"
it's wish fullfillment to the point where it's really just God rubbing it in my face
honestly, this issue is one reason I can't watch Senko-san
it's the "be loved" part I struggle with
I'm already loving
just **one** fucking person
that's all I ever asked for
**one** person
**SICK OF IT**
**SO**
I'm **JUST**
but goddamn
and I'm trying so damn hard not to lash out (especially after condenming the protestors for that same thing earlier)
I'm fucking sick of it
I'm sick of it
I'm sick of being a genuinely good person, only to be told I"m an irredeemable monster from hell
I'm sick of sacrificing for others so they can be happy only to be told I don't deserve happiness
I'm sick of forgiving only to be told I don't deserve to *be* forgiven
I"m sick of loving people only to be told I don't deserve to *be* loved
and I'm sick of it
and yet, that is apparently just too selfish of a demand
**one**
all I ever asked was **one** person to love me
and I just
but this is a VERY DEEP pain that I've gone through my entire life time and time and time and time again
I"m sorry, I"m trying **really** hard not to make this about me
people sure seem to define me by my worst days <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
oh I"m not leaving, jsut shutting up :B
:\
and then they still think of me as an irredeemable monster later
TIMES
MANY
SO
I've heard that so many times in my life, Matt
it's only a matter of time
it's only a matter of time, Matt
I just want this to end before it gets any worse <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
no they fucking don't
no
it's more meaningful to people with giant egos than anyone else
or something like that
it's meant to show other people how special and awesome you are
I don't think something on this scale's gonna be done in a couple months
you have way more optimism than I do
I fucking need it <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
and that's all I'm gonna say on the subject for today. I'm gonna go get breakfast at a nearby resteraunt and then take the day off from social media/news/serious discussion channels/etc
both sides are filled to the brim with hate
here we are now
well
then the cops started tear gassing and shooting rubber bullets and
the protests started out peaceful
damn straight
and they want change
people want justice
"black guy killed by cop. Cop walks away with nothing more than *maybe* a slap on the wrist"
people finally got fed up seeing the same narrative over and over
"oh, those millenials will find something else to yell about. You're free to go, my guy"
I"m hoping the judge realizes he can't just pass a "not guilty" verdict and expect all this to just blow over
like oh I don't know....VIDEO EVIDENCE
the good news is: the prosecution has plenty of ammo themselves
if you want to fight it, you have to face it
denying the truth doesn't make it go away <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
hang on, lemme get the exact wording for you
if you can't see how that can make the cop "less guilty"....maybe you should take some law 101 classes.
and that there was "no evidence" supporting that he died from the kneeling
the preliminary report basically said he died due to pre existing conditions
"See?! It wasn't my client's kneeling that killed him! It was that meth he was smoking!"
and use it to argue his innocence
you know full damn well his defense lawyer is gonna bring that up
changes a lot, actually
hilarious that you think Trump cares about his actions being legal
no but seriously
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
play single player
~~and still get reminded of it by one of your asshole family members~~
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
mute this channel and stay the fuck off news sites/social media
racism isn't limited to just whites
so uh
also, for reference, at least one of the 4 cops in the George Floyd murder was Asian
then what you're getting is wrong
we need good police
<a:MofuMofu:675012179036078103>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
...
no me!
<:PoiGun:663684542984486912>
draw bitch
<:PoiGun:663684542984486912>
just sprite
nope
you'll be wet *and* sticky!
filled with sprite instead of water
jokes on you this is a water gun
ignoring hate speech doesn't make it go away either :|
and yet, sometimes you need to bring attention to someone so you can call them out on their bullshit
and the potential followers are the ones who are gonna fill up his echo chamber and amplify his voice
the more potential haters see it, the more potential followers see it too.
they get the good attention with it
that's the problem with giving people who don't deserve attention any attention at all, even bad attention
the more people that make fun of his list of "traitors", the more people take his list seriously
'cause there are quite a few ass shots
all those ass shots weren't enough for him?
wait, the kid was at your house thinking there was someone at his, or you saw him standing outside?
if you're trying to "win" an argument, you've automatically lost
all you're doing is stooping to their level
they'll continue to exist regardless
at the very least it doesn't sound like the cat got hurt
I hope
I *think*
I heard a cat growling as well, but I think it was after the fact and the cat was just growling at some kid trying to pet it
I hope she calls the police on his arrogant ass
and of course, upon leaving the scene, the jerk had to flip the lady off.
he doesn't like seeing/hearing other animals get hurt either <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
my cat is in the window meowing his "I'm worried" meow
drew blood and everything
from what I can gather, some jerk who doesn't live in this apartment complex brought his dog over to the complex, and that dog proceeded to fight another lady's dog
took a nap after my social worker left, woke up to the sounds of animals fighting and people yelling
yeah, pretty much
the SCOTUS ruling was a good thing, though
between that, the pandemic, the protests, and several personal things going on, this has not been a very good pride month.
like, I've always cared about this stuff, but now it's much more personal than it ever was before
it's especially bad to me now that I A. am identifying as trans myself now and B. have plenty of trans friends
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
like that BS trump did taking away Trans rights earlier this month
and I think I'll be pinging staff everytime I see you do it from now
it doesn't belong on the server at all
2 wrongs don't make a right
<a:MofuMofu:675012179036078103>
good luck fluffs!
I ain't got money for a gofundme <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
at the very least, physical affection would be outright impossible
but I don't know how effective it would be try something like this
:|
me
well
it would be nice to have someone who loves me other than
if not worse
I mean, verbal arguments can be just as bad as punching
that doesn't sound fun Dx
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
and thus, to most people, I'm a very evil person
it makes me **very** different
being both autistic and trans is not fun
very few people can accept "different"
and "different", to most people, means "evil"
it's "different"
:|
aaaaaaaand here comes Emily ready to talk shit about me
I'm pretty sure you would be more insulted by my meat eating if it was some moral thing for you
oh I know anand
I'm not a vegetarian, but I still want to respect the animals that died for my meal, you know?
like, try to eat *all* of it and don't let any go to waste
I'm trying to be more respectful when I eat meat products
I feel like a vegetarian would be against egging people for the same reason they're against eating the eggs, tbh
and especially if I still have to see them around
even if I stop talking to them and avoid them, it's hard for me to *not* think about the hurt they've caused
but it's not always easy
I wish I could stop that easily, Solo
I know that feel, anand
...why are you defensive about veggies, of all things?
out of the country
I wish I had the money to move
ugh
especially on tweets like this
I tend to avoid comments sections on twitter
I actually had no idea why the original tweet focused so much on the triangle
not the context of the triangle
now I'm gonna "OvO" everytime I see a chicken
hah
veg KFC?
I really don't like when people get into **one** argument with me and then make that **one** argument my one and only trait
nice to know you guys refuse any chance for forgiveness :|
I feel like a collapse is due for most the **world**
lots of other problems with living in India
India would be possible but....eh
not gonna fucking happen in most places
which is
whereever I go, I'd have to be able to live comfortably off of about $800 USD/month
since **Idaho** welfare won't work in other states, let alone another *country*
for example, I would lose my **Idaho** housing voucher that pays most my rent
especially since not all of my welfare would be available in other countries
anywhere that's **more** expensive is a no-go
and again, I can **barely** afford to live where I live now
so I'd have to bum off my US welfare
I don't have any job skills
that's another problem
oh
if you have a job, sure
and the only reason I really can at all is because I live in one of the cheaper areas
which I can **barely** afford to live in the US
the problem with Australia or New Zealand is that, IIRC, they cost more to live in than the US
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
CHAZ?
but some have less problems than others
well sure
Europe has it's own problems from what I hear about
maybe
eh
ok not Japan
JAPAN
like
I'd rather move further away
oh boy oh boy
oh boy
"yes"
being autistic and trans
especailly since I'm the type of person that will likely end up in said camps
I don't want to be here when the concentration camps are literally a thing
for most countries, you kinda do
I think about the only way I can move to another country is if I have relatives to move in with
the pandemic
and of course
between my lack of job skills, my lack of money
moving anywhere is probably gonna be next to impossible anyway
D:
I'm aware
they just blindly believe the government's propaganda about communism
very few Americans understand "communism"
that's not entirely inaccurate
but why does it have to happen while I'm alive? Dx
sure
regaredless of where
but again, not a great way to live
and depending on the laws, richer countries would probably also have more money for panhandlers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
since, why worry about rent expenses if I'm not gonna pay rent regarless
and actually if I'm gonna be homeless no matter what, I'd probably choose a better country anyway
I'm just saying
oh I'm sure
I don't want to be homeless *anywhere* D:
homelessness isn't a great option, either
and frankly
honestly, even getting in to just be homeless would be difficult
countries don't want you moving in just to bum off their people
and especially if if stays that way for an extended period of time
that's still way too damn high
I've yet to see any dissent in the military, but I'm also avoiding news as much as possible atm so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
~~why do I keep doing plural?~~
otherwise any revolution will just be wiped out
the only way a revolution will really work is if they someone secretly take over the white house before the government knows what's going on
which it almost for sure will
<@!84811738653929472> <a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
amazing how the police think we're dumb enough to fall for such a flimsy BS excuse
that's not a fucking pinata noose
and sad as it is, there's a legitimate chance he **won't** be voted out
elections aren't until November
:|
too early
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
except sit around and wait for society to be better <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
it really sucks when there's nothing you can really do <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
that's not healthy
oof
only reason I even gave my current counselor a chance was because he worked with me before as my PSR worker
it does suck when you can't trust the help you need, though :|
and trust isn't something you can *force*
trusting your counselor is pretty important
well, unfortunately there's not much you can do about it
it took me a *Long* time to trust counselors again after multiple attempts
I can't really blame here
anywayz, yes, I am here
...not the right place, Kiribot
dess
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
and if there's nothing for meal, tell them
then eat a meal
like, important enough that it's a concern if you don't
maybe you should eat? Eating is pretty important
<@&336302034070536192>
Take me with you D:
2nd biggest source is lack of exercise, but I'm already starting to work on that
biggest source of me getting fat is lack of water (dehydration) and drinking too much soda.
I just need to start drinking more water again
I don't mind cycling, but I'm too fat to do it Dx
cycling wouldn't be a big issue for me if I were in better shape
the Netherlands is pretty, from what little I've seen of it
Sweden is a good choice
....Japan is questionable, actually
or one of the better European countries
New Zealand or Japan
moving to another country costs a **lot** of money <:SadBikki:675027390870585354>
biggest problem is money
well, 2nd biggest problem
biggest problem would be getting the visa
that or *maybe* Australia

<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
<@!170641480791228417> <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
well, and a lot of my present too
The past has done nothing but hurt me, with the only positive experiences being pretty recent ones (Like Symphogear!). Anything positive about who I am today isn't because of my past, but are just aspects that have always been there regardless. But damn, has my past done a lot to make me a **worse** person.
My past has been nothing but pain and suffering, and I wish it would be magically erased from existence.
find it and put it away first!
come to Idaho Falls and I'll hug you IRL <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
~~close the store~~
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but to be fair to be fair, I don't trust her claims of having it
to be fair, I don't think you have asthma
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
a purse and a thin piece of paper that's "totally a doctor's note"
I feel like someone with extreme asthma should have medical equipment with them
wouldn't it be better to DM her?
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956> <@!472513526393602059>
he won't <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
didn't it happen a couple weeks ago or so?
<@!203444794737950720> <:DMJii:549819519082692608>
I only do it because I get a refund from my state taxes
legally I don't have to file taxes
yeah
which makes getting my state refund a bigger pain in the ass than it should be <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
but most tax software won't let you file federal if you have a $0 balance on it
and I **have** to file my federal to file my state
but I usually neither owe nor get anything from my federal
I get a tax refund from my state taxes every year
**filing** on the other hand
doing taxes is easy for me
we've still got over 2 weeks until the restart, so hopefully he'll clear by then and can join his team
I'm a NBA fan myself
oh jeez, hope he clears soon
"yay" capitalism!
pretty much
so again, you need fairly strong evidence that it's discrimination
and the business you'd be suing probably has better lawyers than you
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
also, lawyers cost money
keep in mind, though, that you need fairly strong evidence of it to have a case
<@!266379640069685252> you hire a lawyer and sue
and yeah, they'll also have that disclaimer from the ADA laws
so they have incentive for giving you a chance
They ask because they can get tax breaks for hiring folks with disabilities, FYI
possible? yes. legal? no
<a:MofuMofu:675012179036078103>
~~it's not literally called that, but maybe it should be~~
Idaho needs the same "wear a goddamned mask already, you assholes" mandate that Washington has
jesus christ, the nerve of some people. Willing to bring the virus from an area with a high infection rate to an area with a low infection rate (and spend money on gas and higher tax rates) just because she's too much of a selfish bitch to wear a fucking mask
"#sorrynotsorry"
I noticed Spokane was trending for some reason....and come to find out it's because some dumbass chick from Spokane, WA drove into Idaho to go grocery shopping just because she doesn't want to wear a mask
it's actually kinda funny (and fortunate) how quickly they changed their minds once they started facing even a little bit of backlash. It's like they were honestly expecting everyone to be 100% on board
and all it took was a lawsuit <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

It's been brought up before

very dick move

<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
As Kaiyo mentioned, it's a deeply rooted psychological issue that usually requires professional help, even after recognizing you need help
if eating disorders were **that** easy to solve, eating disorders wouldn't even be a thing that exists
it takes a *lot* more than just "realizing the error of her ways"
why tell us we have the subtlety of a brick?
then why call everyone out on it like that?
and us not being subtle is bad....why?
because politics, I guess
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
again, what point are you trying to make, Rady?
WELL NO FUCKING SHIT, SHERLOK. THAT'S WHAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS

<:KanadeAngry:672861874966233118>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
it's worse to actually go through <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

the *next next* chapter

~~have your roommate taste them for you just in case~~
also, I think the noodles are safe
I don't think jokes are explicitly forbidden in this channel, but they are kind of discouraged
parents do that a lot
Bullshit it can't get worse
I've been doing that my entire life, Cocoa
I need hugz D:
plus how do you like....hug on discord?
I have yet to get a discord date, so I disagree
but at some point or another you want to do something that costs money
which yeah I get that dates don't *have* to cost money
that, and I have no money to go on dates
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I can't even get a friend
see, that's why I can't get a gf
~~a bomber?~~
come your war xD
they're more for 1 night stands or w/e
bars aren't great places to find dates
and the ones I have met have pretty much ended a year or two later
I've met very few couples who first met at a bar
why u gotta hurt me like this? <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
not nice
that's
ow
if only "being interesting" was enough :|
*cries*
that's a good joke
"financial security"
hahhahah
I *need* someone who loves me enough that they're willing to help me through this
I *need* a potential partner to share my burden
so is mine, but I'm still sure of myself
I know who I am and what I want
I'm *very* sure of myself
I need mah hugz D:
I need physical affection
especially for people like me
though that's admittedly not as effective as actually meeting and hanging out IRL
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you could still do virtual dating, Em
if you guys want this to be private, take it to DMs. If you're gonna post on a public server, be prepared for other people (including me) to chime in with their own two cents
no need for Pharios to get on yours
I've been on *both* sides
trust me, I'm speaking from experience here
getting mad at Rady for being slower than you want him to be doesn't do him or you or anyone else any good
Everyone has their own journey, Pharios, and some people take longer than others
while I understand your frustartion, Pharios, being angry and hostile doesn't do anyone any good
and some can get over their anxiety when they're close to someone
some are just anxious no matter what
everyone's different, Matt
and being hostile helps.....how?
and yeah, social anxiety doesn't show up as much when you know someone well
wrong channel Matt
I'm sensing a *lot* of hostility here...
nor do I
I am 100% worse for it
when did I say that these magical cures exist?
when did I ever say there was?
don't you dare tell me I should be ok with keeping them
I fucking hate whateverthefuckelse I have
I fucking hate Bipolar
I fucking hate Depression
I fucking hate Asperger's
I fucking hate this
and still keep the **rest** of me
a **part** that I wouldn't mind getting rid of
it's a **part** of you
you think I like having people like Emily be triggered by my social skills?
you think I like not being able to function socially?
I sure as fuck don't
why would anyone **want** asperger's?
why would anyone **want** depression?
bullshit
and even many of the treatments
I'm well aware of the evils of the "cures" we have today
I'm more referring to magical cures that don't exist at all and never will
well I'm not talking about current "cures", either Emily
doesn't help when people just condemn me for being "wrong" and blocking me without trying to teach me how to do "right"
I've been trying to learn my entire life
and trust me, I've tried learning
I don't fucking know how to communicate my feelings properly
I'm sorry if my phrasing is less than 100% perfect Emily, but like I said I have Asperger's
if I could take a magic pill and be **cured** of either problem, I would, barring serious side effects
anything good in my life has been **in spite** of my depression, not **because** of my depression
depression hasn't done me any good
I would be 100% ok with having the depression part of my personality killed off
but I can't choose to be "normal"
I can choose to just present as cis
being trans is far more a choice than having Asperger's
I don't
I would fucking LOVE to be able to communicate with people like normal
how?
and Asperger's has no cure, either
depression this deep doesn't just magically go away someday
if I waited until I got my mental health in check, I'd be waiting for literally all of eternity
someone to cuddle with and talk with and help me through things
but I *do* need a really intimate friend, at absolute least
honestly, I don't even necessarily need a romantic partner or a gf or anything like that
I am
I'm **not** "less than"
I'm sick and damn tired of being treated as "less than"
that's the whole reason I'm frustrated about being silenced, being told my feelings are less important/valid than everyone else's, etc
just because others seem to think it, doesn't mean I agree
at no point have I ever or will I ever say I'm less valuable than anyone else
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^
^^
^
and I'm done letting anyone tell me otherwise
I'm allowed to have emotions
my feelings are valid too
my opinions are valid too
I matter too
I'm improtant too
and I'm fucking sick of it
I've been silenced my whole life
and frankly, I'm sick of being silenced
I have every right to my opinions as everyone else has to theirs
and fuck you
fuck that
<@!472513526393602059> so I should just shut my mouth and take it?
yeah, but you're judged pretty heavily for it
sure, but that doesn't mean women shouldn't be allowed at all
"This is a men's thing. Only men are allowed to do it. If a woman does it that's abnormal and therefore wrong"
it's "obvious" to them because they grew up with gender norms
because boxing is a "man's sport" and women aren't "supposed" to do it because gender norms
bigotry exists in very large numbers
society at large isn't as chill with it as you are, Rady
I am bigender, but I spend most my time as female
"Aria" is a pretty feminine name, with very few boys that have it
One reason I changed my name was to present as female better
I'm desperate too, but I still have standards
just because you're desperate for love, doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna automagically fall in love with the first women who's nice to you
which is....pretty common, actually
you just have different expectations for the relationship
I don't think there's anything "wrong" with you Pharios
'cause you know, OBVIOUSLY crossdressing is PURELY a fetish thing!
one reason I don't shop for dresses at Walmart is because I *know* people are gonna look at me like I'm some kind of pervert (though the bigger reason is because I'm fat and not ready to wear dresses yet :B)
and that might be the reason why (though I can't say for sure since I don't know her)
worst case I've woken up a bit anxious
I've had bad dreams before, but nothing ever super serious
so there's no difference? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
like...where's the line? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
what exactly constitutes a "nightmare" vs "just a bad dream"?
speaking of nightmares, I have a question
having autism yourself doesn't make the jokes any less offensive to others, FYI
I can't "stay safe" forever on my own
"sometimes"
video games and whatnot don't do much when it's deep despair
and all the things I have in my life I can turn to only help when it's minor
I have no one I can turn to
but I don't
and again, I wouldn't even care that much if I at least had comfort
it's other people not valuing me that's the issue
I value myself very much, Cypher
:|
unfortunately, I have literally no one and nothing
I honestly wouldn't even mind all the pain others cause me if I *at least* has someone to comfort me afterwards
who cares how much it hurts the other person? <_<
and ghosting is so much easier!
but then again that requires *effort*
god, I wish people would be curious about me instead of just dismiss me as some irredeemable monster <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
even other people with Asperger's can't understand me D:
last week
no, not yesterday
....yesterday even, I think
though we've already discussed this the other day
and it's mainly because of my goddamned Asperger's <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
people have difficulty understanding me, too
I *can* tell the difference when a loud noise is waking me up <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I don't think I've ever had a bad dream wake me up before, but then again I can't really tell the difference between waking up because of a dream...and just waking up
huh
at least here in the US
the government has resorted to just using the blanket term for it
well yeah
let's rename Asperger's!
^
"ok" "fine", etc
I mean, that's kinda the problem with the current name, isn't it?
obviously
rather than use a blanket term, why not just use a different name?
it may be a controversial name, but at least it's not a blanket term
my point is it kinda downplays our abilities using the blanket term
exactly
Asperger's, on the other hand, very rarely are affected too much academically
ASD is too much of a blanket term, and most on the spectrum have the disability affect their academic skills just as much as their social skills
<@!605753436763586573> <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
I can't really bend my fingers backwards at all
I think that might be too many proteins
that's a lot of proteins
gratz
I"m just
I'm tired
lifetime of experience, Rady
and yeah, I didn't try. I didn't try because I knew it was a fruitless effort
what's obvious to you isn't obvious to others
"So I asked you to clarify which one you meant", except I didn't know you were asking about which level I meant
you didn't clarify that until after the "you never even tried"
about the varying degrees and whatnot
you assumed I knew what you were asking
no it's not
Rady, you have a **really** nasty habit of assuming what's obvious to you is obvious to everyone else
Blatantly dismissing my entire lifetime of experiences like that is gonna trigger me everytime
then say that instead of attacking me with that "you never tried" BS
don't act like this single discussion represents my whole life
fuck off
and there was no need for that pointed statement, Rady
I HAVE BEEN TRYING LITERALLY MY WHOLE LIFE
I’ve been trying literally my entire life
BULLSHIT
Case in point...
I will literally never be understood <:MillaarcPlead:663522911067570176>
<@84811738653929472> : <:Zababies:672238628398956594>
so until it decides, it's just kinda alternating between the two atm
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
and on that note, my brain can't decide whether to be excited for the move, or STRESSED THE FUCK OUT
I'm moving into a "high support" group home a week from today, so I'm hoping maybe that'll help at least a little bit
I really am
I'm trying my best Mel
and damnit, I'm allowed to have *opinions* too, even if I can't always explain them properly
I'm just as valid as everyone else, and I deserve love and support just as much as anyone else
only when *I'm* involved does anyone bring up "this isn't a good place for seeking emotional support"
I see people vent for emotional support all the time here, and in general, but for some reason only *I* get attacked for seeking it
because you don't like me?
so why is it ok for Matt, as an example, to vent for emotional support, but only ever evil when *I* do it?
gee, thanks for trying to silence me
and attacking me over it helps....how?
already have
too late
~~that feel when even doing a diagram I'd explain things wrong~~
<@!84811738653929472> <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
don't shoo matt away <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
you're not the one who said that to me
it's not your fault, Matt
I'd rather people say nothing than dismiss my feelings or try to silence me
you've seen me try to explain things before. you've seen me fail before
and yes you have been, rady
explaining works maybe 1% of the time
and it gets harder and harder to keep trying
trying so hard and failing gets tiring
tired
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
my brain is *still* alternating between excitement and anxiety
Well another thing that will (hopefully) help is the fact that I'm moving into a "high support" group home in 3 days
who?
and I'm a lot better now than I was in the past
well I have to at least *try*
a....what?
which for sure won't be for at least a little while because moving and such
and I'm probably not gonna until I at least have the avatar done
I haven't started yet
you're also less likely to see what steps you need to take to begin with
if you're scared of taking those steps you're less likely to take them
and mindset **does** play a huge factor in getting a career started
"every long journey begins with a single step"
just the mindset of "ok, but being big means this bad thing will happen and that bad thing and these other bad things!"
more than lack of skill or lack of luck or anything else like that
honestly? I think the fear of the bad things that come with being a big streamer is probably gonna be what kills my career more than anything else
like, I don't mind seeing myself in a swimsuit once in awhile <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and it's not like I'm completely opposed to *all* lewds, either
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
don't wanna see it myself
just
I don't want to discourage the fanart, per se
pretty much
I'm sure I'll have the money to sue literally everyone fanartist ever
good one
copystrike the fanartists
HAH
The worst part about not wanting weird fanart of yourself is any attempts to ask people to stop will just encourage them further <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
anyway, back to the actually serious discussion topic:
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
welp, gonna end that discussion there then
....is this still technically serious discussion?
I'll probably just remain indie, though
I kinda also want to join Hololive someday....depending on what the contracts are like
you ain't gonna get a good avatar model for $5
unless you want shitty results :B
I wouldn't commision a cheap person to do it
I uh
~~or being a failure despite all the effort and getting depressed~~
but at the same time...working to become big means getting weird fanart :B
and I wanna learn Japanese so I can get a JP audience and do Koto streams <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
still have to make an actual live2D model for her, but yeah
*points to avatar*
Luckily it's not something I have to worry about too much until I actually become popular enough for fanartists to care
that's one thing I'm slightly worried about with becoming a vtuber/streamer: having people draw lewd fanart of me
"It's to pay for the research and development!"
I can't find the Lilypichu ones
my medicine doesn't seem to be doing anything, either
God, I can't sleep at all. My anxiety and depression are both **really** kicking my ass tonight <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
and it has me **very** concerned
my cat is getting close to the age where cats die of old age
I also didn't get much sleep last night! yay!
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
<:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
so I have 1:30 less time to pack
so apparently the moving guy is coming at 10:30 instead of 12:00
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
...what?
that is a terrible plan and I am 100% against it
"apologize to China" I get the feeling China won't accept the apology
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
mind filling the rest of us in? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
I get you find their ideals ridiculous, but that's no reason to belittle them
can we not laugh at others, plzkthnx?
jesus christ, Shemmy, tone it down
agreed
if you're an outsider and you're assuming things about what BLM means without doing any research, that's on you, not us
and as Mel said, that's fine, but don't expect everyone else to add the "too" as well
then the outsiders should perhaps actually learn instead of demanding we change?
I feel like we should worry more about fixing racism in America and less about adding "too" so other countries know what America is trying to fix
not for other countries
Racism exists in other countries as well, but again, the slogan is mainly for the American political landscape
and Americans are fully aware of the phrases meaning
especially since it's largely an American politics thing
I disagree that we need to add "too" to the slogan
I really don't think it's as big of a problem as you say it is
hence, Black LIves Matter
but not **all** lives are being treated as though they matter
most people using "Black Lives Matter" are fully aware that **all** lives matter
"Black Lives Matter" already is "Black Lives Matter too", is the thing
I know what comes next, and I think it's best we end the discussion here before we reach that next part
and now we've reached the "no you're wrong!" No you're wrong!" "no you're wrong!" point of the debate
that being said, it's kind of unfair to expect everyone to "get it". You can still sympathize with and care about someone without fully "getting it"
sure, but you can't "fully get" it
how can we fully and completely understand that which we never have to go through ourselves?
I mean....how can we?
<a:MofuMofu:675012179036078103>
I just....want this all to end already
and I don't wanna
I haven't even read up on the details of the shooting yeht
god, I'm not even in the mood to turn my PS4 on right now
*sigh* that's true
no one here has said the players should stop protesting and play
No one is saying that, Lank
God, why can't some deity descend upon the Earth and just wipe out racism and all this other bullshit already?
Jesus christ, I"m actually crying tears now for the first time in awhile
"I know it's not that simple," VanVleet continued, "but at the end of the day, if we're going to sit here and talk about making change then at some point we're going to have to put our nuts on the line and actually put something up to lose, rather than just money or visibility. I'm just over the media aspect of it. It's sensationalized. We talk about it everyday. That's all we see, but it just feels like a big pacifier to me."
~~and hey, I still have NBA 2k20 on my PS4 if I need basketball so badly~~
I hate the disruption in my basketball, but I think BLM is fucking more important right now
A lot of players feel like being out on the court right now is a detriment to reform. We have "Black Lives Matter" on the court and on jersey's, but then yet another black guy gets shot 7 times in the back and the lawmakers just sit there like "Lol, who cares?"
As much as I **really** wanna watch basketball, I think what the players are doing is a good thing
wtf is even going on in here today? <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
yup
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
a bunch of different countries with a bunch of different governments
and then we go right back to where we are now, basically
because eventually **everyone** will want independance
that defeats the purpose of a world government, IMO
*totally!*
Gee, thanks Tennessee! I was *totally* looking for a reason to be ashamed of where I was born!
there are *plenty* of legit reasons she could have canceled
it is a little weird to cancel last minute like that, but it's also not all that uncommon
<:AdamScream:688241618356404224>
I see
*cannot* or *will not*?
just not as fun
you *can* still do that online
again
it might not be much, but it's better than nothing
you can meet people online, at least
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
and isn't exactly a fulfilling lifestyle, either
"just chill" doesn't make any money, though
hence the reason I've been stuck literally my entire life
hell, just trying to figure out how to focus your attention is overwhelming
focusing on all of them is just overwhelming
the problem is trying to decide which of the many options to focus on
welcome to my entire fucking life Dx
I feel like this convo is starting to get uncivil
depending on who you ask, yes all presidents are bad
and if Trump wins, we "took votes away from Biden"
"you took votes away from Trump!"
The Republicans will blame the 3rd party voters if/when Biden wins
with all due respect Ardania, I don't appreciate you condemning me for not sharing the same opinion
I'm getting sick of people blaming 3rd party voters for this candidate or that candidate winning
for the love of God
we're not condemning the country
I'd rather go to hell on Earth than go to hell in the afterlife just because "Trump will win if you vote the good guy!"
plenty of time for a Republican president to get elected again and fuck that plan up
by 2050
fuck you
so again
which means yes, you **are** condemning me
I'm part of the group you're condemning
I didn't
versus the "lesser of two evils"
all because, god forbid, I wanted a **Good** President
fuck you for blaming me for your friends dying
well fuck you too, Ardania
are you seriously saying it's the independent voters at fault for Trump winning?
which, frankly, many people forget is also pretty damn important
you can take 20% of congress
~~honestly though, if I had the money I'd just straight up leave the country~~
then fuck you
and if you condemn me for that
I'm gonna vote my concious like I always have
anyway, I'm out
maybe not in this election cycle, but they'd become a bigger and bigger threat
yes they would
honestly, 3rd party candidates **would** have a chance at winning if everyone got out of this mindset
why would I want to make it easier for my opposition to win?
the 2 parties love it too much
of course, it'll never be redone
^
obviously I wouldn't win, but it'd be interesting to see.
I wonder how many votes I would get if I ran for President 🤔
so uh
same when congress goes agaisnt the president
wasn't arguing that?
I uh
the President also makes laws, Cypher
wait, who's even his VP?
different states have different deadlines for candidates to be put on the ballot
I mean 100% exactly what I just said
and his campaign....I haven't seen anything of it other than "I'm running"
he's too late to legally be on the ballot for some states
speaking of 3rd party, how 'bout that Kayne West presidency? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
won't visit **that** site again
crazy people writing about other crazies
I made the mistake of reading that article and hoo boy
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
yeah, those last names are kind of a giveaway
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
SUPPORTIVE HUGS
they can?
lots and lots of hugz
also, hugz
especially if they can't get any professional help
it's about all you can do
and being there for them
lots of hugz
hugz
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
everyone needs hugz
you're better off doing your own research
the debates aren't really even all that helpful for figuring out who to vote for
then stop D:
and yeah, push them to get help
well it's good things got better, at least
is this a different friend, or did their situation change, or am I just misremembering? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
also, super late but <@!84343454838030336> <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
oof
yeah, you're gonna have to be **way** more specific
for example, I"m a Symphogear fan **and** a musician
especially when you combine them with other words
you can be creative with those words, though
calling myself a musician gives me a role to conform to
calling myself a Symphgear fan gives me a role to conform to
you mean like literally every form of self-identity ever?
it's bad
yes
and **them** alone
that's on **them**
nor your identity
not on you
that's on them
again
and frankly, I don't see how it's even possible to get rid of any and all identities
people assumptions of identity has nothing to do with the indentity itself
without even understanding what identity is
at this point you're just against identity for the sake of being against identity
you identify as someone who *does* things
identity
boom
the identity itself has nothing to do with it
that's on them, not on the identity
and yeah, study it before trying to get rid of it
he still can, it just means he has no valid reason for it
you don't even understand the very basics of what identity is, lec
that's not what identity is
no it isn't
stop blaming the identity for someone's assumptions about the identity
**not** the identity
the assumptions are
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
virtual hugs are all I can do D:
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956><:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
I have a hard time believing **anybody** has recovered that quickly from COVID
came out after like what? 3 days?
especially if you train yourself to do it, which my guess is he would've
not as hard as you might think
<@!257970367732121602> <@!468591607332208641>  <:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
So...what really even changes if I vote Biden or vote Mickey Mouse?
This is a Republican state through and through. Even if we somehow vote Democratic...so what? We ain’t worth shit in the electoral college
My vote ain’t worth shit
I live in Idaho
It’s also funny how you think my vote even matters to begin with
The world’s gonna end before the system GRADUALLY changes
Gradualism would honestly be nice, but it also sounds like a fairytale to me
But there’s still the federal elections as well
Start at the local level, yes
Typing on phone is annoying
Freaking autocorrect
*Lec
You’re not even old enough to vote, Lexus
Let alone their policies
Not sure if I will this election though, since I don’t even know who said candidate is
I tend to vote Libertarian myself
Trust me, voting green is still a hard decision
and of course you don't see it iski. You're not on my side
so I'm **Not** just gonna sit there and take it
I've taken it most my life, and all that's lead to is even more of it
and I'm not one to just sit there and take it
I was attacked first
funny how it's ok for other people to vent, but god forbid I do it
not just one specific person
it was directed to **everyone** who's throwing hate towards me and other thrid party voters
that initial "fuck you" wasn't directed to a specific person
so of course you don't see it
you agree with what they're saying
you're a democrat who hates third party voters
of course you don't see it Mel
I targetted Ardania *after* they showed up, Iski
I'm ok with people being unhappy with my decision. I'm not ok with people name calling me and blaming me for trump
I've seen you do it
you've outright name called
you've done more than just criticize
and I see plenty of hate coming from you especially
maybe not with those exact words, but I know when I see hate
they said "fuck you" first
because again, I'm getting sick of the hate
and everyone else who does it, for that matter
then please stop Ardania from attacking us
Or better yet, yell at the people ACTUALLY AT FAULT
So why don’t you start yelling at the dems, too
I’m doing just as much as the people who voted Clinton
And neither is anyone else who voted third party
I’m not to blame for trump, Ardania
Getting real sick of the hate
As a third party voter: fuck you too
....not that it matters anyway. Even if my candidate won the state, Idaho only has 4 electoral votes. Nowhere near enough to make any sort of meaningful difference
but I vote by policy first, so I'mma take a look at her too before switching from Biden
she's the one I would vote for by party alone if I were the type to vote by party
I know Kanye will be on it. I saw a news article awhile ago about a judge ruling he meets the requirements to appear on Idaho's ballot
well, I'll just see who's on my absentee ballot when I recieve it and go from there
~~shows how little I know of Kanye~~
is that an actual person? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
"Lil Wayne"?
uh
....does Kanye have a VP candidate? Who would be VP if Kanye somehow won?
If I can remember his last name, I'm gonna look more into that Brock guy. As it stands now, though, I"m voting Biden.
I mean, you can still technically vote for him as a "write-in" candidate....but how many are gonna do that?
I have no freakin' clue how Kanye plans on winning when he joined too late to even be on the ballot in some states
I just know he plans on "winning" by hoping the election ends in a tie and he somehow convinces the house to elect him over Trump or Biden.
and the other guy Brock....something or other, I haven't read into his policies at all yet
yeah, I don't have much faith in a Kanye presidency
but then again I don't exactly go out of my way to find the latest celebrity gossip so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I haven't heard about him quitting
yeah, I don't wanna vote "the lesser of two evils", but I'm not sure a Kayne Presidency would be all that great
....does he even *have* any policies?
One of those, btw, is Kayne West
I probably will end up voting Biden, tbh. I only know of *two* third party candidates atm, and I know **nothing** of either of their policies
I am perfectly willing ot have my position challenged. It's the hate I can't stand
I don't trust anyone, Lank
understanding leads to resolutions, not silencing
sounds to me more like you just want to silence me and call it "resolved"
also, how do you expect to resolve this without knowing what lines I consider an attack?
words only ever directed at me
"calm donw"
"take a break"
of course
<a:LongFluff:734594540857458724>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Everyone be sure to give Gwen lots of hugs if/when she comes back
Yeah, it sounded scheduled
So hopefully she’ll be ok
According to Mei, she’s “safe and stable”
|| She posted a suicide note on Twitter, which is why everyone’s really worried||
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
and yes, I could use some hugz
I just barely saw the tweet and D:
now
doctor
that doesn't sound like something that's going away on its own
so whatever candidate "wins" tonight won't necessarily be the President
keep in mind there's also over 100 million mail in votes that'll be counted AFTER the 3rd
which itself will never happen because neither of the two parties will allow it to happen
unless they somehow win the election without entering the debate or something
and that's why there will never be a 3rd voice :|
things are gonna be bad no matter who wins
there's bound to be some Trump supporters as well who mailed in, and there could be more than I realize
but yeah, don't take anything for granted
mail-in voters will likely lean democratic, considering Trump's attacks on mail-in voting
by the time that happens, the country will be gone
no one at the moment
oh, that's what you meant
I think moving the votes after you know who's gonna win is a terrible idea and I'm glad we don't do that
so....the vote would just keep moving forever, or you limit it to just once and the loser always wins?
it's decently likely at this point fig, but still FAR from guaranteed
not yet
and make Trump win
and to think, before the election we were being yelled at because we were supposedly gonna pull votes from Biden <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
46 dems to 47 repubs
also, Senate is currently split almost 50/50 according to cnn
are you surprised?
Biden's leading
I'm not used to seeing **myself** purple :B
<a:MofuMofu:675012179036078103>
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
and he will be
I wish Trump would concede, but he won't
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
so
still technically a projection, but it's unlikely to turn out differently at this point
Hopefully
He has to live in the aftermath too, and everyone will know who the fuck did it
I wouldn’t put it past him, but I also sincerely doubt he will
the real issue is Trump trying to file lawsuits or recounts or w/e to swing the electoral college in his favor
I mean, it shouldn't be that hard to begin with?
yeah, until Jan. at least
<a:MofuMofu:675012179036078103>
and now ABC is reporting it
*someone's* gonna record that shit
it most likely will be

you might find out you're wrong!
of course not
you still haven't actually answered me as to when you become a professional therapist

he's not gonna get removed
I see
but if this is the 2nd time?
From what I've been told they're removed from office when impeached
so....what does being impeached actually mean?
You’re welcome here
to brag about how much richer, and therefore better, they are than you
I'll believe it when I see it and not a second sooner
I dunno. I think he might be half of all impairments, too <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but that doesn't mean shit without conviction
he is, yes
hurr durr "It was a joke!"
depending on the game/ruleset you play

them being terrorists isn't really new
I mean, they launched a terrorist attack on the capitol not too long ago
they 100% would
not necessarily. Though it wouldn't exactly hurt, either
if anything, your depression is only going to get **worse**

Some people have even decided I deserve the silent treatment for it
I ramble to clarify as much as possible, and instead I’m even more misunderstood
Same

problem is I don't have the supports I need
I've been there my whole life
"a little" being the key words there :\
people caring doesn't take away my pain
what are you gonna do if I log off right now and grab my knife?
you can't stop me
nor will I "survive" for the sole sake of survival
I'm not gonna live on for everyone else's selfishness
only reason I"m not killing myself right now is because there's a *small* possibility things will improve in the next few months
Saying that I'm selfish for leaving people behind is, quite frankly, incredibly selfish itself
I shouldn't have to suffer for a lifetime just so everyone else can avoid a one-time tragedy
but I still deserve to be happy
I love and cherish people too
I'm 100% ok leaving everyone behind if it means I can be in a better place
hugs of goodluck

I doubt YouTube allows sex Ed videos
there really needs to be some sort of online course (maybe there already is?) for adults like me who lived in sheltered communities
which, ok, but HOW THE FUCK DO I KNOW WHAT TO DO AFTER I'M MARRIED?!
it was straight up not offered at all at my school, and my mom's LDS so the only thing she'll say about it is "wait until marriage"
I'm 31 and I still haven't had any form of sex ed :|
so yes, they 100% can take your phone
at least in the US
technically speaking, anything you "own" before age 18 legally belongs to your parents, not you
Idaho doesn't exactly get very hot in the winter

I dunno man, some people are pretty crazy
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
not to mention that's a long distance to go for a job, even with a car

and yeah, you'd *defenitely* be sweaty after that

well, the alternative of demanding vaccine cards isn't a whole lot better, tbh
in this case, they're hoping that if you're going places without a mask, that you're actually vaccinated and aren't just a huge asshole
Basically, they hope you tell the truth

racism in the US is more personal to an American than genocide in some other far-off country
people care more about what affects them personally
~~the $5 is hilarious to me for some reason~~
and I grew up in the LDS/mormon church so trust me, I know fake people
I may not be "old", but I"m no child. I've learned a lot about how the world really works
32 years of experience
at all
because being fake doesn't help
perfect equity probably ain't possible either, but I'm still striving
No one said we shouldn't?
~~at least I wasn't the first one to say "fuck you" this time~~
Vyn, don't you fucking dare "holier than thou" us
and even then, I question if that's real
love isn't a thing that exists, except between two individuals in a relationship

I'll admit I took things too far, but you're taking it too far yourself, Max
<@&336302034070536192>
because you are fake. I'd rather be real.
but it's a LONG ways away from happening
equity is more achievable, IMO
funny how you assume I don't want reduced wage gaps and whatnot, but ok
"equality"!
fuck you too, buddy
I don't want to lower myself to your level just to agree
good
they just claim "equality" to sound like they're fighting for "justice"
what they really want is more inequality, but reversed
NO ONE
No one actually wants equality
"equality"!
because hurr durr majorities aren't oppressed and totally deserve it!
tl;dr: fuck capitalism

yeah, I'm not really 100% sold on being called "queer" myself
~~someone tell Twitter and Twitch to stop recommending them to me~~
I know one twitch streamer that called themselves a "**ap" for awhile, but recently has been calling themselves "femboy" instead
well, I also don't get out much :B
but I still don't like the term all that much
Interestingly, I mainly only hear the word queer in communities like this
unless they were innocent and that's why it gets overturned
**anyone's** sex assault conviction getting overturned is bad

tried that earlier
$65/month vs $50/month, and the internet will be WAY faster and, more importantly, WAY more reliable

at least until the pandemic's over and/or the EBB funding runs out
I'm gonna be paying less for it

nope
I think the reason I'm so manic is excitement to be getting better internet service this Friday

not really enough room to exercise (and also can't make noise that might wake up others)
my options are pretty limited for that, though
yeah, I'm trying to get myself tired
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
it's 2:30 am and I'm WIDE AWAKE despite not taking any late naps or anything

that's why news outlets primarily report bad stuff
people are addicted to negativity

I've been bullied my entire life, including my adult life
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!
and then you get bullied in your adult life!
the fact that you have the mentality to seriously consider doing it is greatly concerning regardless of ability or lack thereof
so basically the solution is "deal with it" :|
and how do you stand up for yourself **without** escalation? Bullies don't exactly respond to polite requests to stop.
It'd be nice if they could at least stop punishing the victims when they try to stand up for themselves

Plenty of people are unhappy, sure, but that doesn't mean no one is happy at all
then you haven't looked very hard
so I'm not a particular fan of "no nut november" memes either
most people I know would be VERY UNCOMFORTABLE if I suddenly started talking about how much I fap or don't fap
I don't think anyone was accusing you or going to accuse you of being anti-sex
I mean, there's probably not much they could've done to help, but continuining to perform just makes it feel like they don't care
I definitely agree with Freyja that performers shouldn't continue on like nothing is happening.

probably costs more money to add the material, too
so technically, the doctor's at a higher risk than you are
Plus, the mask doesn't really stop you from getting covid so much as it stops you from spreading it to others
so it shouldn't really be a problem
Doctor's usually sanitize just about **everything**

as big of a deal as that is, it's still nowhere near "if you get omnicron, you're guaranteed to die"
I was talking about the news media
fearmongering is how they make money
"there is no statute of limitations for filing a complaint". Imagine being fired for something you taught 20 years ago just because a parent decided they hate you
I already know my mother, who is a teacher, is gonna have so many goddamn problems with this bill
and it bans teaching that "Nazis are bad people"? Who the actual fuck thought this bill was a great idea?
god, this bill better not pass
"and the teacher will have to provide a different lesson plan for that child" HOW IN THE FUCK ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO HAVE TIME FOR THAT WHEN THEY ALSO HAVE TO TEACH ALL THE OTHER KIDS?!?!?!
I do it once a week :B
technically you're supposed to clean it after every load
I know my clothes don't dry as well as the filter gets more and more clogged.

I literally never even payed attention to dislikes
not unless the video was **really** shit
I mean, dislikes didn't mean a whole lot before disappearing, either

<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
that's why I'd like to see it challenged in court
I'd like to see that challenged in court

why Poland and Hungary?
wat?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

both were horrendous communities to be a member of, albeit for very different reasons
and I didn't leave the AMV Hell forums until they more or less died on their own
but yeah, it took me YEARS after realizing how bad the LDS community is for me before I actually finally left the church
<:PoiStare:674513626295435265>
I'm just saying, sometimes you actually do need to isolate
oh, I wouldn't say be a lone wolf
but I stuck with them because it was basically the only social interaction I could get at the time
I've been in two major bad communities that, frankly, I should've isolated myself from sooner
some communities aren't worth being around
that's....bad advice
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I"m barely above my lowest point

The KC server I'm on is kinda toxic too, but I only lurk the art channels there and use their poimotes
which I fucking refuse to ever do again
but that would require going back in that community
part of me wants to
I don't
the worst part of the LDS church is that they're so self-righteous, it's impossible for them to see it
Pretty much
"4chan sucks because they're hateful, toxic bastards" - hateful, toxic bastard

Mormons are secretly hateful. AMV Hell was outright toxic as all get out

oh, and the sponsored "trending"
like the current war going on
of course, there's also the world news stuff everyone gets
and sure enough, I do follow a few wrestling-related accounts
I almost always see this superstar or that superstar in the trending
not everyone gets WWE
if that were the case, everyone in the same location would have the same trending
~~I still don't pay attention to it~~
NFT'S, GUYS!!!!
and even when people were trying to help him
but no one helped him for quite awhile because NFT'S, GUYS!!!!!
he was trying to get help with his fanfic
ask technodude
We have rules such as the 1 hour post rule specifically to have room for each fanfic, prompt, etc to have discussion
My biggest problem is how it took over the channel to the point that having serious discussion was basically impossible. Technodude was trying to get help for his fanfic, but instead all he got was "NFTS, GUYS!!!! BLOCKCHAIN IS THE FUTURE!!!!"
~~also Elfnein tripped~~
it's this thing called "April Fool's Day"
that's a lot of threads O_O
I honestly don't think we need threads for **most** situations
I don't think there's gonna be a 100% perfect solution that works for all parties
but overall, the rule we have now works out well enough
especially since you'd have to define how much discussion classifies as "a lot"
*maybe* 2 hours if there's a lot of discussion, but....eh...adding that would probably be more trouble than it's worth
generally speaking
I think the 1 hour rule is enough
I'm not necessarily saying threads should be enabled in all channels at all times
letting people have their fun shouldn't ruin other people's fun
I think in the future we should take advantage of the "threads" feature. That way the prompt team can have their fun and we can still have serious <#357682999300718592> discussion alongside it
so of course I'm gonna read ill-intent
*always*
Matt, you *always* mean ill-intent
"This seems like a really nothingburger thing to be upset about, if I'm being honest."
"there's a lot to be said for using context clues"
and frankly, you're being a bit aggressive to people who disagree with your view
I'm not trying to fucking moderate, Matt
and there's a lot to be said for reading the room
how selfish of me!
yes, I'm so self-centered wanting a channel called <#357682999300718592> to be about FANCONTENT
that's fine, I"m blocking your ass anyway. This whole thing has really soured me on the prompt team
and then you started again later, and now you're playing the victim
of course, that would take a looooong time to reach
:|
that's the end of prompts
and can't make more
if we reach 1000
but
yes
I don't know if you can delete threads
1000
~~then again half of them are inactive/emote servers~~
come to think of it none of the servers I"m a member of currently use threads <:NelThink:674513359592226824>
"new toy" syndrome :B
I"ve seen threads blow the fuck up (albeit, this was mainly when threads were first introduced)
My problem with that suggestion, ahi, is that it's harder to talk about older works that way
good luck with work :B
charge people money to predict the future!
was just saying :B
honestly I wish Mel and the others could get paid for their work here or something because holy shit
which of course, means more work
plus adding a thread for each prompt means the members would have to be allowed to create threads, and the mods would have to make sure that doesn't get abused
some people do take a long time to read things but yeah, you can't and shouldn't keep threads open forever

only real reason to **not** loan someone who wants a loan is if you think there's a high chance they'll default on the debt and you'll end up losing money instead.
I mean, if you can **easily afford** it, then why not loan the money? It's a low-risk investment, and you stand to make money off the interest
and it's not necessarily the best system, either
just....not overnight

"Japan needs gun control!"
Some of the comments on the news from Japan are just....cringe worthy
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
if that's actually true, that's a LONG time to go without assassination attempts
I'm curious about the validity of that one Japanese-language article I saw that apparently listed assassination attempts of PM/former PM's....and apparently the last one before this was in 1960?
and yeah, I've left the twitter comments section. Probably won't return to it.

every Japanese citizen is gonna magically conjure up a gun out of thin air now

yup, Japan is *totally* gonna start having daily mass-shootings from now on
There's also a LOT of complete dumbasses in the comments who seem to think that ONE incident of ONE guy getting shot in Japan is magically gonna change the entire country's gun culture to be like America's <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
oh, and of course the fucked up jokes about it <:ranyangry:962818628896587866>

I dunno about other articles, tho
well, the article you posted isn't particularly fear-mongering IMO
Also, a lot of it **will** burn up in the atmosphere as it descends. Maybe not all of it, but a decent chunk of it, at the very least.
it's most likely, by quite a large margin, that the debris will land in the middle of the ocean somewhere
also, like Mel said, you're FAR more likely to like...I dunno....randomly have a drunk driver crash their car into your living room or something
the map will be more and more accurate as it gets closer to actually reentering the atmosphere and hitting the Earth
then it's woefully out of date
how long ago was this map?
according to the article, it seems most likely the debris will land somewhere uninhabited....so no.
it just blends in with discord's background color <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
lol, you can barely see the stethoscope
and for some dumbass reason, the government decided that these two facts means that they should REDUCE my food stamps
food prices are getting fucking expensive (along with everything else)
They raised my rent last month by a significant amount. Basically reducing my monthly "spending" money to about $40/month
I'm starting to get pretty overwhelmed myself
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Humans suck. Become fox <a:Floof:856315780470931466>
and with the democrats already not wanting to put more than bare minimum effort into their own campaigns....there's a much higher chance of their "strategy" failing than I think they realize
Like I can *kinda* understand their "logic" behind it....but dear god is it such a huge gamble with MASSIVE consequences should it not pan out
Like, I already have issues donating money to become a member of the DNC just because I don't really believe in blindly voting for whoever happens to be a member of a certain party. But the fact that if I *do* end up donating it could very well in up in the pockets of the OTHER party, and basically the WORST of it at that? Fuck that
that bullshit too
oh yeah
yay
so....if they win I'm basically fucking dead
even better? The republicans want to outright **get rid of** Social Security
but of course, the Democrats are only really doing what they think is the bare minimum to get into power....and I guess they think simply introducing the bill is all they need to get voters
now's the time you wanna get voters
and there **are** elections right around the corner
which....you would think they would already be trying really hard to push that through cause like...that would be a pretty big thing to brag about to voters, ya know?
the worst part is that my only real hope of getting any more money is either for **de**flation to occur (which...I'm not sure ever actually happens in an economy?), or for the democrats to push harder on that bill of theirs to improve Social Security (2 main things it would do for me is raise my benefits by $200/month and also change how the yearly adjustment is calculated)
<@99695384296701952> can I haz hug plox? <:ranygib:971530958685736980>
which are....not exactly great alternatives
and the other is to start stealing
one of them is fucking starve for two weeks
but like
well, technically I have two other choices
I fucking *hate* having to bum off food banks, but now I have no choice
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
so now instead of having food for the whole month....I run out by the middle
no I don't know
and your source for that is that **one** person said so?
exactly
no one's claiming the Soviets are perfect. Only that the nazis fucking weren't
and yours are?
let's please keep it dead
I get that, but there's a reason Mel stopped the discussion
it's dead
the discussion's over
circles, please stop
do we really need to bring it up *again* and have Mel end it *again*? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
and while there *is* a chance the crypto can actually gain more value over time.....there's also a pretty big chance it'll go **down** in value
You're gonna end up with significantly less money after fees and such when you try to sell that crypto for actual cash
like yeah, getting "paid" in crypto is...not really ideal in any scenario save for the scenario where you're a cryptobro yourself and you wanna invest all that money
My favorite line is "Even if somebody wanted to return the money they made off my work, it would be in the form of some shitty Crypto anyway."

~~new game theory episode~~
I honestly doubt it
...then why defend escooters so much?
you **do** realize you could've done that yourself, right? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
bigger and harder to store, sure, but I can easily justify the cost of a bike
and a good one is also WAY cheaper
a bike, I can see myself using WAY more often
which is yet another cost I would have to justify
that means I would have to pay for electricity to charge it
also, escooters require charging, correct?
a "craigslist junker" is still pretty fucking pricey for a guy on government welfare that is perfectly capable of just walking or using public transit
I don't see myself getting near enough usage out of an escooter to say it was worth the money I spent on it
yes, but when you spend so much money on a escooter....you kinda wanna get value out of it, ya know?
even my fat lazy ass can handle that just fine
McDonald's is literally just down the street a few blocks away
you're missing my point. My point is my journey length is always going to be well within walking distance, or well past the length your scooters can get me
that...doesn't sound ideal to me <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
going like, 30MPH on a highway
and on a highway
like, if I'm actually going 30 miles on a scooter...I'm wanting to go further than that, too
and I wouldn't do that **near** often enough to justify the cost of getting such an expensive scooter when it's literally within walking distance anyway
the only **real** use I, personally, would have for a high-end scooter is to like, go to Mcdonald's and back
that's....still a pretty fucking small range. And frankly, expensive
I doubt the company behind them is gonna bother investing in faster scooters with better range
and with how much they cost......why even bother? Literally just fucking walk to where you wanna go to.
And frankly, I can see why. Their range is basically "within walking distance" and their speed is basically "*slightly* above walking speed"
I've seen quite a few rental escooters in Boise, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone actually **use** a rental escooter
no
escooters can do less at a higher cost
which is still complete BS, imo
they're "equal" to each other
oh right
literally what are you even going on and on and on and on and on about, then?
....I'm sorry what?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
oh, but the scooter that **can't** is superior
even on a cheaper kids bike, I was fine
I've done it before
bikes can go up curbs
bikes are cheaper and are also extremely useful in urban uses
and that makes them superior to bikes, than can handle worse conditions just fine....how, exactly?
so in order to get a escooter that can handle anything more than the absolutely most well-kept gorunds....I have to spend money
they would need one they can sit on
those people would also have a hard time even standing on a escooter
so....still not gonna make up for the price difference of buying myself an e-scooter instead
that's honestly almost a non-issue for me. I'm not gonna be overly exerting myself with lots of physical activity before hopping on a bike.
an escooter is gonna have issues with hils, too <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
they *do* make bikes that can be folded up, and most of the buses in my area have a bike rack you can put your bike on while you ride
I should also mention that the bike is gonna have much better range than a scooter, being that it's limited by your individual stamina rather than any electric motor
and is **still more expensive than a good bike**
the $250 can only go 15.5 MPH
and mind you, this is apparently with an UPGRADED motor
I can buy a really good bike for $200 and go 25 MPH on it
and it goes MAX 18mph
$400
https://swagtron.com/product/swagger-5-boost-electric-commuter-scooter/
if this "low-end" scooter can't do it, I doubt a cheaper "entry level" will, either
and...also can't even really match the performance of a bike
it still costs more than a bike
uh...
and it's the higher end that apparently has all the actual speed and range.
or combined with public transport
without ever having to be plugged in?
....you're seriously gonna tell me a scooter that costs **thousands** is better than a bike that costs **hundreds** and can get me to basically the same places at the same speed?
bikes are pretty easy to learn how to ride, honestly. It's mostly getting used to the balancing
technically speaking, a healthy person could walk literally all fucking day. doesn't mean that's normal for them, though
and it certainly doesn't mean it's *normal*
just because you *can* doesn't mean it's *needed*
literally you just need like....30-60 minutes per day
even health-conscious people don't usually spend that long going for walks unless they're training for a marathon or something
because that's a fucking long distance?
most people don't go for 8 mile walks
that's not normal
then you must be in **peak** physical condition, because that's still a long distance even for incredibly healthy folks
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
also that's like, 6.21 miles which is....pretty fucking far to walk in just about **any** country
"walking distance" varies wildy by individual
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
also <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
some do, but that's not necessarily the majority
they not using these things to get around, they're using them to play
most of the escooters I *do* see being used are being used by kids who think they're a fun toy (and more power to them)
they buy their own **bike**
They don't even buy their own escooters
I'm in the USA. I'm surrounded by fatasses. And yet somehow, **magically**, all these fatasses are either **walking** to their destination...or using a **bike**.
anyway, further joking around should probably be taken to <#336297387863703552> before the mods get mad at us :B
<:tsubasa_smug:675028211125714954>
my tail is more important
and no, Matt, I will **not** just use my tail to sweep the floor. that would get my tail dirty <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
nothing said in defense of escooters up to this point has convinced me otherwise, and actually has further proven this fact to me
anyway, I'm gonna leave this convo with one last point: Bike are superior to escooters in basically every single way save for a few **very specific scenarios**.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I can sweep the floor now
oh cool
and that benefit comes at a cost. Not only in terms of electricity that has to do the work for you, but in terms of health
It's only an "inherent benefit" for people who are too lazy to use pedals
yup
is that benefit **really** worth it?
but like
because we're not?
they're only "comparable" in few, very specific ways
escooters have so many more issues and, again, at a higher cost
no they're not
even the best sources aren't always 100% factual and accurate, even if they try to be
actually, it's good advice in general to **always** do some amount of research, no matter the source
not to be mean but....it was kinda hurtful hearing that
<@411556790925393921> so I don't know what source you got your info from...but it sounds like a source that's blowing things out of proportion to perpetuate a super harmful stereotype, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't take info from such sources at face-value.
but yeah, even my fat, out of shape, lazy ass could ultimately make that walk just fine
god, I'm making so many typos today
luckily I worked the later shift and could just kinda hang out in the employee break room for a few hours until my shift started
I was tired when I got to work. Not physically, but mentally
but like
I was still incredibly out of shape back then...and I made that walk jsut fine
it was the one on the opposite side of town
and it wasn't the walmart right nearby either
I remember back when I got a job at Walmart while living at a homeless shelter
I feel that, tbh
haven't even started going for regular walks yet
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
I lost 10lbs in the past month
well actually less than that now
I'm 200 lbs overweight...and I can still walk long distances if I have to with nominal trouble
in fact, most health-consious folks are actually looking for ways to **reduce** the time they have to spend exercising, while still getting in shape
most folks, even healthy folks, *do* like living life outside of just walking all the time
how horrible
boo hoo. you have to sacrifice a **small** amount of happiness so others can be happy too
**ethical** hedonism takes others into account as well
First they try to get out of the porn industry, and then they try to take it over <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

~~Biden isn't more popular in Idaho, btw~~
who cares if Biden is more popular in Idaho if Trump is more popular in Texas?
popular vote doesn't fucking matter in the electoral system
I'd rather lose 1lb of fat than gain 100lbs :B
progress, even a tiny amount, is good
I will agree there
Yes, they are good results
sure....but is that because they care? or because they realized that the bar of "bare minimum" is actually higher than they first thought?
I mean, that's still **waaaay** better than the assholes *actively destroying the country*, but god we need SO MUCH MORE than just "meh....I *guess* I'll do a thing here or there"
:|
and nothing else
whatever they feel the bare minimum is to get voters and stay in power
the dems *do* do something!
but yeah, Idaho historically doesn't vote blue unless 90% of the rest of the country does too
which is....kinda discouraging
I'm seeing more red sweeps than blue sweeps overall though, especially in more recent years
lol, 1936 even more so
like, holy shit 1964 was such a blue sweep
https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/
last time Idaho voted blue.....so did almost the entire fucking country
California isn't as blue as Idaho is red
I think so? But IIRC it **has** been flipped in the past so....
nobody fucking cares about Idaho voters
If you're the Republican candidate, you're pretty much guaranteed to win regardless. And if you're the Democratic candidate....you have no chance anyway, so why bother?
because nobody really gives a shit about Idaho voters
even in local elections, there's *barely* any political campaigns going on
because I live in a state that doesn't fucking matter
in the end, my vote doesn't even fucking matter
so even, by some miracle, we vote Democrat here (which it WILL require a fucking miracle. Idaho is pretty strongly Republican).....who fucking cares if California and Texas and all the other big states vote Republican?
which gets **very few electoral vote**
and also, I live in Idaho
in the **extremely rare** circumstance you *do* find a half-way decent politician...they belong to a third party that has absolutely no chance of winning whatsoever anyway
honestly? I'm not sure if I'm even gonna bother voting at all in future elections. <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
and in the end....you're getting the fucking devil either way
honestly, so much of American politics feels like you're voting for Lucifer because you don't want Satan to win
well, "left-leaning" is probably most accurate. I tend to agree with Democrats more than Republicans, though I still have **many** issues with that party as well
I don't really agree with either party myself....but I don't consider myself all that "centrist", either
.....assuming our country is still around by that point
but I wouldn't be surprised if it did happen sometime within the next few cycles
fortunately it hasn't been exploited **that** badly yet....
so even if a state votes 100% one way, the electoral college can just be all like "Ok, but we like the other person so...."
Also, I think the electoral college can actually outright **ignore** the popular vote if they choose to?
I shee
can anyone explain this in non-lawyer speak? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I honestly have no fucking clue what this is saying. The wording is so damn confusing to me <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
they were specifically talking about what I said
except they weren't talking about the source
ok ok, I get it. You guys dont' have to jump down my damn throat over it. Sorry I don't have as much faith in humanity as you do
either way, it's not something they should've brought up out of the blue. *especially* with it being against the organization's policies.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I guess
especially without any more details
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>  hard to read their intent, really
I'd read more articles to see how fucked up the website is....but I don't want to give them anymore clicks than I already have
"These guys suggested suicide to a veteran. Also, THEY'RE COMING FOR YER GUNS!!!!"
I mean, the article is relatively unbiased....until the very end where it just randomly talks about cracking down on guns for no reason
I feel like this is one of those sites with an agenda to push
also, why is there a section for "North Korea" and "Middle East" but NO sections for Russia or China? <:NelThink:674513359592226824>
at the very least it doesn't seem very professional
yeah I'm kinda questioning the source
lol. underneath the "opinion" section of the website is "controversy"
yeah yeah, I noted the source
The photo used for the article doesn't seem to have anything to do with it, either
don't really see how it's relevant to the rest of the article, but ok then <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
oh, and there's a paragraph about cracking down on guns at the end, for some reason
I read the whole thing, but it doesn't really add much other than the VAC is investigating and *may* take action against the employee, and also the veteran and his family were shocked by the suggestion
kinda sounds like the employee just wanted to commit legal murder
that feels a little *too* "assisted", ya know?
I'm honestly in favor of assisted suicide in certain cases....but if the patient themselves never bring it up and you try and push it on them anyway....
If you make just *barely* enough money from your job to lose you benefits, for example. You might think that you'll have more money at the end of the day, because you're now richer! Guess what though? Taxes are a thing that exist
To be fair....Social Security is actually pretty difficult to get off of without really screwing yourself over.
I would almost definitely go the suicide route regardless. :|
well yeah
I don't have any family or anything I can rely on to bum off of for the rest of my life
and if that happens....my only real option is suicide :|
the Republicans are trying to get rid of my safety net. And there's a pretty damn good chance they'll succeed
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
my roommate, who has the same social security income as me and pays just as much in bills, gets $76/ month MORE in food stamps than I do
then again, I don't know if I'm actually receiving the full amount of benefits I'm qualified for
so I *do* have to worry "ok, where's my next meal gonna come from? The food bank? should I beg for money from my friends?"
I literally only have enough money for food for **half the month** now
but with the economy as fucked as it is now, and with the complete and total lack of effort to expand the program...
in the past, sure
they have programs to help, but it's still a pain in the ass Dx
like Das's situation from earlier
but it does suck how hard it is to actually get off Social Security if you **can** work
Social Security is a great thing to have
Republicans are actively working on "fixing" that, though
for now
<a:Wavy:734595755519508520>
lots of social security retirees will move to countries like Thailand and India because their money goes so much further. And if you're not looking to get into work regardless, local wages don't matter much :B
though to be fair, wages are also a lot more horrible in India as a result
while I'm **barely** able to survive by myself in the US on that same income
Anand has mentioned to me before that you can literally take care of a family of 4 in India on my income
it's not the best example, but it's the one immediately on my mind
well yeah
a lot of people in Yuma, Arizona will drive across the Mexican border to buy their prescription drugs in Mexico
literally cheaper to **fly to another country** if you don't have insurance :B
but yeah, in the US that same dental work would've been close to, if not over $10,000
just pointing stuff out
not mad
One of the staff who used to work here literally paid $35 for pretty extensive dental work...and the dentist was even trained in the US xD
but yeah, different economies will have wildy different prices. Just because it's free in your country doesn't mean it's free in much more expensive countries. Thailand, for example, can do dental work for $10's of dollars (USD) that a US dental office would charge THOUSANDS for
oof
how much food does your country have to import from other countries?
any US PC shop that builds PCs for free is either making their money somewhere else, or is about to go out of business
USA isn't fucking cheap by any standards
if it's cheaper to live in a country, you don't necessarily need to charge as much either for example
they can probably get away with doing it for free because they live in a **completely different economy**
not even close
no
uh
what store, if I may ask?
PER PART
Best Buy I think charges like...$75 per part installed
it's actually pretty common
I can see it easily
it's not enough to just get a job. You need to get a **high-paying** job that will account for the increase in taxes and bills
I understand, but the way Social Security is set up really fucks with that, unfortunately :|
so in addition to paying more in taxes, you're also paying more in bills. You'll have bigger numbers on your paycheck, but lower numbers in your bank account
You ending up losing those as well...and your bills increase as a result
It's even worse if you're also on *other* government programs as well, such as medicaid, housing payment assistance, etc.
Social Security is a pretty fucking popular program. You'd think the democrats would **love** to brag about improving it ahead of midterms, but I guess not
Now if only they would care about that Social Security expansion they introduced a long ass time ago <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
I mean, the truth **is** pretty defamatory when you're doing bad stuff.

Maybe just.....DON'T run over children? <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Everyone is just assuming there's gonna be a purge because "woke agenda" or w/e
there is currently no indication whatsoever that they're gonna "pull a Tumblr"
people aren't worried about that, Das. They're worried NSFW won't be allowed at all, blurring or otherwise
And just in case it isn't obvious to anyone: I'm not at all worried about the loli/shota stuff. If that gets censored but everything else NSFW stays, I'll be 100% fine
I am a *little* worried about possible censorship....but I'll believe they're gonna do it when they announce they're gonna do it and not a second sooner. It is 100% possible for the company to care about their employees behind the scenes without fucking up the website.
The sheer amount of people worried about pixiv censoring artists....only because they'll lose access to their loli/shota porn.... <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
oh no! the company is gonna start treating women like people now! **cleary** they're gonna start censoring artists!
supposedly
supposedly those employees are gonna find some art on the site offensive and have it removed <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
like I said, I'll believe they're gonna censor when they announce the censorship
neither do I, tbh
God forbid you show any amount of kindness whatsoever to people who aren't white heterosexual cis males
Waving hello to a black person you randomly pass by on the street is "woke"
Caring about humans who aren't you and who aren't like you is "woke" <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
sounds "fun" <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
oh, was that the whole Berlin wall thing?
uh....what? Last I checked Germany is still a country in the modern world? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Also, instead of trying to get the average German taxpayer to pay reparations for something most weren't even around for at the time, why not demand it from the Nazi party that was specifically responsible to begin with? You're not gonna get a single penny regardless, so why not villainize the actual villains?
ok, but why now almost 8 decades after the fact? Are they purposefully trying to get Germany to start WWIII or something?
chatbot doesn't seem to really understand the concepts it's trying to teach to the stressed teacher <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
facebook WAY too big <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
well yeah, but that law wasn't made as a cover-up/denial is what I'm saying
That's my understanding as well. They censor a lot of nazi stuff in video games and whatnot, but it's less of a cover-up/denial and more of a "we don't want to be constantly reminded of this"
I'm glad Kotaku blatantly calls him out as a "NFT psycho advocate"
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
just
I'm aware
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
"Isn't exploitation awesome guys?!?!?!?!?!"
jesus christ, doesn't even try to hide it
"there'd be less car accidents if we stopped making cars, too!"
you'll have to ask the ones making that dumbass argument, I guess
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
define "absolute marriage"
uh...
like, god forbid we stop FORCING ourselves into shitty marriages just to satisfy the status quo <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
but of course, that apparently is only because there are less marriages
also, divorces rates have been declining for quite awhile
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

I would like to visit Phoenix~
I think I was actually thinking of Arizona when talking about biking to Vegas :B
dum dum me forgot Nevada is right next to Utah and not just Arizona <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I would still have to bike across the vast majority of the state of Nevada, though
though that's the route I'd probably take in a car
oh, and technically I wouldn't have to bike across Utah
Cypher, I think you took me too seriously <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I'd have to bike across the entire state of Utah <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinda a long bike ride
I live near Boise, tho so uh....
I'd bike to Vegas if I could somehow handle it
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
no thanks
which, thankfully, we were paid for the travel to/from the jobsite, and I could slep in the van
NOT including travel time
I've worked almost 19 hour shifts before doing inventory <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
who was overrating it?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
that isn't 95% of the drivers on the road?
Oh no! moving your legs in a circular motion! The horror!
also still let you be lazy and sit in a car vs having to move your body and *gasp!* WALK
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
traffic jams are usually still faster than walking
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Until you get into a fucking car wreck yourself
"yeah, but those happen to other people, not me, so it doesn't matter!"
humans care about their own comfort more than literally anything else
ultimately worth it, but also ultimately won't happen because humans just can't be bothered with anything that might *mildly* inconvenience them <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
same, though to Vyn's point there would have to be a HUGE investment in changinge the infrastructure
In the end though....not a lot of the haters actually showed up. I only saw like, 2 counter-protesters at the event.

Had some fun at the Boise Pride Fest today~....but boy did we have a lot of bullshit to deal with on the lead up <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I mean, if there **are** any Nazis in this war....they most likely ARE in Russia
I can't believe some of them are still buying the "Nazi" bullshit <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
What's also kinda funny is how much the GOP misinformation campaign seemed to actually BENEFIT the very Pride Fest they sought the demonize. There were **far** more people in attendance this year than last, and while they lost a few sponsors that caved into the misinformation campaign, they also gained quite a few sponsors to replace them...some of which donated WAY more money.
https://twitter.com/ericearling/status/1568824410504839169
It was kinda funny seeing some Christian guy holding up a sign calling us to repentance being completely and totally surrounded by rainbows, especially with much more loving Christians in the event itself actively supporting said rainbows
are they saying Lockheed are behind the attacks or something?
uh....
but I DEFINITELY heard about the passenger revolt
I guess I just never heard where it landed
it was THAT plane
oh
wait, seriously?
all these years....and I somehow never heard of that plane that crashed into a field in Pennsylvania
or that the attacks were the resort of some sort of "problem" with the planes and nothing to do with the terrorists on board? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
let's hope this time it's a fake, at least
why can't the original copies still exist IRL alongside their NFT copies? <:ranyangry:962818628896587866>
why do we need to burn paintings to "turn them into NFTs"?
which....isn't necessarily the ideal solution <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I'm not sure what Ukraine could've done to end the war other than "give in to Russia and let them take over"
what could Ukraine possibly do beside cave in to a fascist and give him whatever he wants? Putin hasn't really been up for peace talks himself
but again
sure
yeah we can see that
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so
well we can't
well ok, they have a "trial" option for $1....but still
oh goody, a website you can't read without paying a bunch of money <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
....why is there a "X holdings I" and a "X holdings II"? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
the sheer amount of new infrastructure that'll require....
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Do you not like him because he hates foreigners and is a fragile baby?
do they even get paid that well?
considering that their job is literally to **save his life**, why couldn't he just let them stay for free? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:PoiThumbsUp:674513493017493525>
~~don't forget retweet~~
either way, there's a LOT of programming and such I have to learn before I start on anything game-related <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I guess technically you wouldn't actually be seeing much of the concerts if it's supposed to be an idle game
I dunno
maybe
actually I guess I could technically just do song names and never allow players to hear the songs
~~inb4 Evanescence cover idol group~~
and the songs I wanna write most aren't good idol songs :B
though I'd have to write WAY more songs and also get really good art for it
maybe I should start that "Idle Idol" game first. That's something I could probably actually make to relatively good standards without a major studio <:NelThink:674513359592226824>
~~or playing other people's games, lol~~
and even if I got that....all that time spent developing the game is time I'm NOT spending doing Koto music <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
it'd be nice if I could get a full studio behind my ideas....but what major game company is gonna pour **millions** into a game from some random no-name nobody?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
not unless I somehow come across a fuckton of money and spend like...100 years on the project
I don't want to release anything less than my grand vision.....but my grand vision isn't something that can be done by some indie developer
my biggest issue with making my own games will be tampering my expectations of the production quality I can put behind them (because no moneyz)
~~also, there's no way I can make the games I wanna make without a full major studio behind them :B~~
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Music I can do just fine with, but the art assets are gonna be a pain because I have almost no art skills
I kinda wanna develop a game myself....but I would have a **really** hard time getting all the assets myself since I would most likely have to create them myself
also, learn game development and develop a game <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
cover the game development of the game you're developing <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
I don't really feel safe here atm
like....what is she gonna do if I get super suicidal and grab a knife to stab myself with? Just sit there and watch me do it?
which is.....kinda fucking concerning
and all the while.....**our staff didn't do shit**
I asked him several times stuff like "are you okay?" and "do you know where you are?" and he just kinda stared at me like he knew I was making some sort of noise but didn't understand anything I was saying
and eventually sat down in my chair until the staff from next door got back from taking their own clients out and came over to deliver our meds
then he kinda shifted stuff on the floor around with his foot, picked up a couple of tuna cans and was twisting them together like he was trying to get them inside of each other or something
he was just kinda digging through my mail that I had on top of my dresser like he was looking for something, and didn't respond to anything I asked him
I went to go to the bathroom and when I came out I found out he went into my bedroom and closed the door behind him
he got up and walked around kinda at random before sitting down in a different chair
he stopped shaking after a bit...but seemed to not really be cognitive afterwards?
because my roommate was having a seizure or something and all my staff did about it was take his boots off
does removing someone's boots while they're having a seizure actually do anything?
so uh...
~~people still using Kanye's old name, lol~~
maybe Teslas would actually be worth buying <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
now I wanna see the alternate timeline where Elon never bought it. See what it would be like today
I shee
no, but the adoring fans your "genius" gets you will <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
wait, did Elon actually "invent" a flamethrower or something at some point?
....though he's probably still getting his account back
oh, seems like the statement from Trump was faked
aaaaaaaaand it's looking like Trump is getting his account back
and of course....bigots and nazis are coming out in droves to celebrate <:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
probably to be replaced with yes men
CEO and CFO are both also gone
tf is this dude doing bringing a fucking bathroom sink with him?
and his profile bio is now "chief twit". I had to actually double check the verification mark and visit his profile to see that it wasn't just some meme profile created to make fun of Musk
....dude has a video of him walking into Twitter HQ with like, a bathroom sink or something
I mean, there's a very real possibility he was fired for a completely unrelated reason.....but I have my doubts on that
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
off to a "great" start already
welp
https://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/1585796402784784384
💸
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
paywalls are ebil
especially with it being literally his first move <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I feel like it's probably the latter
I'd also like to hear his excuse as to why he fired those executives. Did he do it because they're evil scumbags who want to continue ruining society....or because they **dared** to challenge his ego?
the problem is he mostly does the latter for the bad ones <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Dude has a lot of good ideas, honestly, but he also has a lot of TERRIBLE ideas, and he's too full of himself to see the difference
I do like the ideals he's talking about.....but actions speak louder than word. And his actions thus far have been.....well, let's just say I'm not entirely sure Musk is the hero Twitter needs <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
it's not even so much "getting people to use it" as it is "having the infrastructure to handle people using it"
probably not even the main issue, tbh, though most certainly the source
google itself isn't necessarily the only problem in all this, either
oh yeah
stopping them from violating privacy accomplishes nothing for privacy protection? <:NelThink:674513359592226824>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
so the only way you're willing to admit they're up to no good and we should stop them....is when they've already taken over the world and it's too late to stop them
"it's not beneficial to them!!!" Except yes it very much is
the fact that you guys think Google never has and never will do anything evil with our data is....honestly **greatly** concerning to me
"The first problem is that often such data can be partially or fully de-anonymized using various statistical analysis techniques. The effectiveness of this depends on having a large amount of data from a variety of sources, but the result can often be breathtaking in how specifically it identifies actual people.

The second problem is structural. Whenever anyone (including Google) populates a large warehouse of personal data, they become a target for hackers. Although Google does anonymize data before releasing it, internally they store it in a fully identified form. What a juicy target! Hackers are thinking, "yummy yummy".

Before you respond by saying, "Naw, nothing as powerful and capable as Google could ever be hacked", just ask any of the 143 million consumers in the USA, UK and Canada whose sensitive personal information was exposed in a data breach at Equifax, as revealed last week, what they now think. (See resources below for more information)."
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
and no company ever has ever has any insidious malicious intents
artificial intelligence, for one thing
it's much more than just ads, though
"What this means is DoubleClick, Google’s ad service, will know which prescriptions you’ve searched for on Drugs.com, thus providing you with personalized drug ads. Meanwhile, Facebook receives information about what you’ve searched for in WebMD’s symptom checker.

“There is a whole system that will seek to take advantage of you because you’re in a compromised state,” Tim Lebert, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University told Financial Times.7 “I find that morally repugnant.”

While some find these kinds of technological advancements enticing, others see a future lined with red warning flags. As noted by Wolfie Christl, a technologist and researcher interviewed by Financial Times"
https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/how-google-stealing-your-personal-health-data
https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-sells-future-powered-your-personal-data-n870501
but I wouldn't put it past them
probably not
honestly? wouldn't surprise me
and you're incredibly naive if you think there's nothing evil being done
period
at all
advertising is NOT the only use
and google is willing to sell it
companies are willing to pay for that data
among other things
basically anything they **can** collect, they **do** collect and sell
your health data
where you go, what you talk about with friends, what you talk about with family....
even if it's **just** for advertising (which it **very much is not**), it's still pretty fucked up that google sells literally ALL your info to advertisers
it's pretty common knowledge now
they needed another method for making bank....and that method was selling personal data
not any bigger than Bing or Yahoo, at least
otherwise they wouldn't be big at all
they didn't get as big as they are by selling ads
not even close, bruh
and also arguably the largest reason privacy violation is a major issue in today's society
literally how they got so big to begin with
that's their **main** business
they.....very blatantly are
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
mostly the "selling your data" part
it's not because of how much money google makes showing you ads and selling your data
~~people like me not knowing they did it is probably why it failed <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> ~~
Though that doesn't necessarily mean they never did
I dunno. I've never seen or heard of them doing it.
Musk is about to lose $44b on twitter, so.... <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Meta has currently lost a LOT of money with facebook and that VR thing, so they're probably not in the best position for taking a chance on their own youtube thing
and I'm honestly not sure what big tech company is willing to make that competitor. Amazon already has Twitch that they **could** start allowing recorded videos on, but they probably won't do that until Twitch is dying out, if they do it at all
so.....youtube's replacement is gonna have to come from a company every bit as evil as google, but with better PR :|
and people will get upset about that and leave rather than giving the platform the financing to get better servers
and the servers won't be able to handle that
....and it'll probably fail once they do give it a chance because it'll be basically everyone giving it a chance all at once
and it's gonna be a LONG time and WAY more evil BS from google before people FINALLY give any smaller site any sort of a chance
any youtube competitor is likely going to have to either come from a company equally as massive (and evil) as google, or is gonna have to start really really really really **really** small like youtube once was but actually be given a chance by enough people to eventually grow as big as it needs to be.
oh yeah, I'll also mention this: Google isn't the only company selling personal data
reputation matters a LOT more in that culture
an American company trying the same shit in Japan as they do in the US won't necessarily have the same amount of success with getting away with it from Japanese consumers
cultures, too
international politics are a thing that companies get to deal with
true
they at least probably wouldn't piss off other superpowers by asking for their data, too
at least for American data
also, the US is honestly probably just as likely as any other country to pass laws that say "give us all your data"
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I don't like it
superpowers are fucking over literally the whole world
I don't wanna be a superpower anymore <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
well, the US and a few others
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
it'll be mine
god, Poland is gonna get fucked, and it won't be their government that does it
~~our foreign policy changes SO DRASTICALLY every few years~~
~~yet another major problem caused by political divisiveness~~
the republicans, tho?
The democrats might, sure
I doubt it's that much
but uh
not sure how much the US considers Poland a threat
last I checked, rady ain't Korean
ok....but that's North Korean
ok but....how pissed off are these other governments going to be?
Walmart is still VERY MUCH a store that exists
has yet to happen
people threaten to boycott Walmart all the time
LOTS of American companies have piss-poor image...but still somehow make money
I dont' think "good image" is as important as you think it is <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
er...pay you to display their ads
no more awesome clickrate means less companies willing to pay for your ads
no more targetted ads means no more awesome clickrate
protecting data means no more targetted ads
if your country signed a law that says "share your data with us"....google would happily oblige and continue on as normal. There's no money in **protecting** data
they care about money. sharing their data with the government isn't going to take away from that money near as much as pulling out of the country and no longer offering their services
what makes you think google cares about protecting your privacy?
not necessarily?
and the original subject has more or less led to this anyway
it was, but also this is important to discuss too
thanks for not showing empathy, btw
doesn't mean the rest of us don't suffer, though
well good for you. Glad you're country isn't as corrupt
well yeah
Google may have facilitated a lot of it, but it is ultimately other people doing the worst things
stopping the governments
that's actually a much bigger concern of mine than stopping google
they can easily pass laws to FORCE google to give them that data, too...or just give google money
the governments of the world are a FAR bigger concern than google
yeah, that's another thing
and last I checked, I'm allowed to have opinions, even if they disagree with yours
I literally *just* started talking about that, tho
I'm just arguing that yes, they ARE selling data
I...never said to stop using them? (although I do think people should look into alternatives)
people getting killed? TURN THE FUCKING MUSIC OFF
also, event organizers need to be better prepared for shit like this
if you see an EMERGENCY vehicle, you get the fuck out of their way. Even if it's just a random bar fight or w/e
I can understand to a certain extent not really understanding what's going on in a crowd that huge...but there's a reason they're called EMERGENCY vehicles
the worst part is I can see that exact same shit happening here in the US
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>

https://twitter.com/juwonreports/status/1586431901836800000?t=iJttpfCgn-aUScxYP1dJEg&s=19
it really sucks that such shitty people can also make really good media
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
and people still worship this guy
That excuses fucking nothing
How the fuck does losing his brand deal come even remotely close to being murdered by racist cops?!
I can never understand how a human being is even capable of being that out of touch
Fucking what?!
~~I can guess it's probably being written by people who know literally fucking nothing about online streaming, tho~~
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so can't really comment on how good/bad it is
I have literally no idea what bill is meant to say/do other than "something to do with streaming online"
we're not like, super close friends or anything, but we fucking live with each other so it's not like he's some random stranger I'll hear about on the news someday or something
I don't know if my depression will be ok with experiencing someone I know dying right in front of me
I'm just scared that a future seizure will get a lot worse <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
<a:Floof:856315780470931466>
and thanks for the advice
that's good to know
I'm curious about the science behind it
I dunno. I've never come across or heard about magnets being used for seizures before, either
basically a magnet that you rub on his chest to like...reduce the severity or something?
oh, one thing I **do** know to do with his seizures is that he has a....I think they called it a VNS?
and possibly call an ambulance to come check on him
I called the team leader just a bit ago (well, texted him and then he called me for more info) to tell him what happened. He's gonna call the on-duty staff and ask more details then talk to the QIDP (basically the person that would be the regional manager if this were a retail store) about it
the only reason the "team leader" knows about the history is because it just **randomly** came up in conversation with the nurse
oh, best part of this? there's **nothing** about his history of seizures in the training the staff is supposed to do on each clients that's **supposed** to tell them about all our needs
when I got out there, the staff was asking me to come over and help with something in the corner. At first I didn't see what that "something" was, but when I went over I saw my roommate lying on the floor
I have no idea how long it lasted. I was in my room in my bed at the time just barely waking up from a nap when I heard a "thud" in the living room that I got up to go investigate
and I still don't know how to tell when I should be calling 911, and when that would just waste their time <:AkashiConcern:663683896956944384>
this is the first time in my life I've ever experienced someone having seizures, and it's been 2 of them 8 days apart
but it's still kinda concerning to me
he got himself up after a few minutes and wandered into the spare room we have to listen to the football game on the radio, and now he seems to be alright
my roommate had a seizure again tonight (about an hour ago), and this time he fell over <:AkashiConcern:663683896956944384>
anyway, google rant over
and I apologize that I made it seem like I was trying to oust Google as like, the big bad demon king that we need the hero to defeat or w/e. It's certainly **a** boss, but not the **final** boss, to put it in JRPG terms :B
"Oh, Google doesn't want to sell data anymore? Fine, we'll just have the NSA do it or something"
and they'll likely replace Google very quickly
some of which are **government** agencies
even if Google were to like, disband as a company right here and now....there's still data collection happening by multiple other agencies
and I'll reiterate again: Google **does** sell your personal data. That being said, Google isn't necessarily the biggest issue here, and it sure as hell ain't the ONLY issue.
which is all the more reason it's on the government to pass protection laws than it is on Google to "just stop doing it"
sounds like a great reason to vote for someone else <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
expecting such a huge crowd would be all the more reason to find some way to police said crowd
you fall down on a downhill street in a crowd like that, and it's basically impossible to get back up even without everyone else running around
especially on bad terrain. I'm reading comments mentioning relatively steep slopes
if it's literally impossible to move without shoving people aside, it's 100% guaranteed someone's gonna die if something causes the crowd to get scared
but it still needs to happen
admittedly, that's a lot harder to do for outdoor events on streets
I can understand wanting to let as many people enjoy themselves as possible, but at some point you **really** need to be turning people away
if the crowd is too big for anyone to move anywhere without literally everyone else also moving in the same direction at the same speed....that's a fucking huge safety violation right there and needs to be prosecuted.
there also really need to be laws on events getting crowds this large
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
God, I'm glad I don't like in my birth state
<:HibikiDisgusted:675026015684395012>
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Musk worshippers are now going to start attacking activists because they're "trying to destroy free speech!"
the only person worse than Musk...are the people that worship him and believe every word he says
just because it's logical, doesn't mean it's not totally and completely fucked up <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
this guy sounds like he's either a cult leader, a terrorist leader.....or both
I mean, I can see his logic.....but also <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I don't think I'd be happy with a transphobic parent
~~and that's assuming there's even a Jesus to come back to begin with~~
we could literally have the second coming of Jesus happen and I'll still be suicidal <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
there's still a bunch of personal issues that are gonna be there no matter what happens politically
my mental health the past couple weeks has been the worst that it's ever been in my entire life, even outside of all this political stuff
or kill myself
and frankly, I'll probably be killed in a terrorist attack long before they actually get rid of my welfare
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and Satan already has plans on how to make that happen anyway even if Lucifer takes over so
Yes, I could technically vote 3rd party....but I'm not really too thrilled about the idea of helping Demon Lord Beelzebub *become* the devil, either :|
<:ShirabeFuckYou:675011643276525588>
Fuck anyone who thinks I should vote anyway
and in case it isn't clear to anyone....no, I am not gonna bother voting tomorrow. I can't in good conscious vote for the literal devil himself no matter how much every other demon wants to yell at me about how it's my "civic duty" or spout some BS about how there's supposedly still any hope whatsoever or whatthefuck other BS excuse you wanna pull out your ass on how I'm supposedly bad for not voting
this country is 100% fucked with literally no hope whatsoever
and it's only a matter of time before all you demons start killing each other for **daring** to have different opinions on stuff
y'all are getting the devil regardless
Everyone's arguing over whether Satan or Lucifer should have control of the country like as if there's any difference at all
worse, there's almost a 100% chance of domestic terrorist attacks after the results are released when people find out they didn't win
now it **has** to be 100% democrats or 100% republicans for either to get anything passed
I miss the days when **compromise** was a thing that existed <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
which is....not how counter**balancing** works at all
apparently his reasoning is "to **counterbalance** Biden's Democrats"
"VOTE REPUBLICAN EVERYONE!!!!" - dude who's *totally* politically neutral. Trust me, guys.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
https://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/1589815732170366977
of course not
then again he probably has enough worshippers that would gladly pay him for the right to breathe in the same atmosphere he does <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
just because you **can** charge for it, doesn't mean people won't immediately leave if you do <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
also get to hear about how Crapo won in every county in Idaho ~~ignore those 2 blue ones!~~
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
yay me
I get to hear my roommate and staff cheering and talking about how terrible Biden is
Idaho Republican as usual
probably
🤡
and boy, we can't have the awesome amazingly creative genius that is Elon Musk be limited by evil corporate shareholders, now can we?
shareholders means "people you have to answer to"
going public means shareholders
dude wants total and complete control
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
we're too busy crying
not really
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
"a healthy dose of common sense"
so we get to wait another month before seeing who gets that seat
From what I can see, looks like that Georgia runoff is basically confirmed
but yeah, congress and governor positions are the big ones for midterm elections
mostly local ones
and other positions
domestic terrorists are far scarier than any politician will ever be <:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
<:MikuFear:642799630605615114>
....and even more worried about how the people who don't like the results will handle it
I'm worried about who **did** win
I'm not really worried about who **could've** won
though that still amounts to a 0.5% difference across the whole state, so
Blue is losing the majority of Georgia, but is winning in the places where it actually matters <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
86.4% with less than 5k total in another
one of these counties is 80% Republcan.....with less than 10k total votes
apparently
I guess the very few blue counties are just that fucking huge in comparison?
the democrat is winning....but the majority of the state is showing red
huh...interesting
"CNN projects the Georgia Senate race will head to a runoff on December 6"
Georgia has estimated 99% of votes in, with the democrat winning by 0.5%
only an estimated 69% (lol) of the votes counted so far, tho
Arizona has the largest gap with only a 5% difference
jeez, all 3 of the battleground states (according to CNN) are almost 50/50 atm
<:SammyShrug:544660008441479179>
so
all I really know about Fetterman is "he's not Oz" and "the Republicans don't like him because he's not Republican"
there's actual bones in them
tails are more than just hair, Star <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
or the other tail is attached to her fucking arm
I've seen a lot of twin-tailed catgirls where one of the tails is in the proper spot and the other is just MAGICALLY floating in mid-air for......reasons
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
sometimes the AI has NO IDEA where the tail is supposed to go
anatomy with kemonomimis is even worse
and an anime character
no exposed bewbz. 0/10
but that's not really the main issue
especially the NovelAI art
some of it is good
they just want the fame
sure, but a lot of people don't want to make art
they also turn comments off so you can't call them out on their bullshit
takes away from the illusion that they're "real artists"
many don't even bother with the AI tags
~~mostly because I don't want to make it publicly visible what porn I'm looking at~~
I haven't seen it yet, but I also don't really follow artists on Twitter
probably
I also don't know too many newgrounds users who use newgrounds for artwork, honestly. They're mostly there for the games and animations
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
it's not really the place to go if you wanna get free fame as an AI "artist"
I mean....people don't really use newgrounds as much anymore
....too bad that still relies on AI "artists" actually marking their art as ai-generated, though
at least Pixiv lets you block AI art
'cause that thing I'm worried about happening that you're all telling me isn't going to happen? **it's already happening**
also....are any of y'all even watching the video I posted, or are you just blindly spouting "that'll never happen so I don't need to worry about it "
if billionaires cared even the slightest bit about a "sustainable economy", they wouldn't be lobbying politicians so hard to avoid having laws passed that might actually force them to sustain the economy
oh, and best part? this is all ignoring any possibility whatsoever of the Terminator plot becoming an actual reality. Which uh.....most AI developers honestly aren't doing too much to make sure that doesn't happen so....
hell, I would argue it's *already* too late
by the time we get pissed enough to do something....it'll be too late
no matter how pissed off we get
not us
and the billionaires are the ones with the resources to get whatever the fuck they want
if the poor are more desperate to kill the billionaires, the billionaires will get equally more desperate to...you know....NOT have that happen
we're talking about a world that's 10,000x more fucked than we're at today
but we're not talking about today's world
sure, it's not gonna happen in today's world
you can't enjoy your billions in heaven, so why stay on Earth and let the poor brutally murder you when you can live out your luxurious life just a little longer up on the moon?
hell, pretty soon they'll be able to move themselves to another **planet**
also......moving themselves and their wealth to another country that **isn't** having a revolution
also also also, poor people willing to kill other poor people on your behalf if you give them just a taste of your wealth
also also, AI weapons
also, drones
they will if they have to choose that or their lives and wealth, Cypher
also, nukes and unmaned drones and such are a thing that exist now. The elite are MORE THAN CAPABLE of crushing any revolution that threatens them and their wealth
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
and they'll move outside of France
or just enjoy the massive wealth they've accumulated while they still can
THEN and only THEN will they care about finding a solution
and they'll worry about reaching that point only AFTER we've reached that point
"why have $200m in 20 years when I can have $100m now!!!!"
and you trust short-sighted companies that only care about money to make sure the economy remains sustainable for future generations?
we can't even be artists anymore
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
robots taking all the jobs, and humans have nothing left
anyway, this video brings up a worry I have with AI, as well as automation in general
there we go
still no embed
nope
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKi8HfcxEk
lemme try that again
thanks discord <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
....
....if youtube will let me load more than just the homepage <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
speaking of AI....lemme find that video I just thought of
but that's another discussion for later
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm....probably not gonna vtube anymore
not really
good thing indie Vtubers exist in quite large numbers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
then again...there's also the very real possibility of him getting **even more entrenched** into his delusions instead
see how "wonderful" you think this war of yours is afterwards
just watch your men die right in front of you
doesn't even need to do any of the fighting
which is all the more reason I dead-seriously think Putin should legitimately join his troops on the frontlines
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
and usually it's not faced until one is **forced** to face it
maybe Putin should join in on the war
guess seeing all your men die really changes your perspective on things
Even the die-hard military professionals are starting to get sick of the propaganda, it seems
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
yeah ok, but y tho?
"we didn't lose it, we gave it independence!"
"let the military determine what is happening" Dude's getting sick of this "historian" lady's bullshit, lol
and now I"m at the part with the Roman empire being replaced by italy thousands of years later
at least this military dude is **starting** to come to terms with reality
I will literally never understand how you humans are even capable of being this fucking narcissistic <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
at least they understand "war has its own laws"
I know he's delusional, but Jesus fucking Christ
what, they just expected not just Ukraine, but the **entire fucking world** to just immediately bow down before the almighty Putin with no resistance whatsoever simply because "I want you to and I said so"?
"We obviously didn't count on NATO fighting us" WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU EXPECTING, THEN?!?!!
not even **trying** to be subtle
they sure do like the term "Hero of Russia" a lot
fucking what?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
what defines a "phase"?
"second phase" how do we know what "phase" a currently happening war is in?
I honestly don't believe Russia will collapse, tbh.....but I simultaneously won't be surprised in the slightest if it does
~~totally not biased~~
<a:Floof:856315780470931466>
Fox mom best Nijisanji
KKK
I doubt it
and his image along with it?
uh....ok. But how does that stop them from like, lying? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
"They wrote us a letter promising us!"
though one thing that **does** seem suspicious on their end in the article is the "evidence" they have that their suppliers aren't doing it
I **do** doubt suppliers for HelloFresh are doing it
I don't doubt that it happens
so there is some **small** possibility this is legit...but that HelloFresh doesn't know they're doing it
it would be one of their suppliers that they use
it wouldn't be HelloFresh themselves
not to mention funding **literal terrorist organizations**
and faked a LOT of "evidence"
PETA has lied about a LOT of their allegations
....it's fucking PETA
but uh
I mean, I don't **blindly** trust HelloFresh
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
how accurate are these accusations?
uh
well yeah
~~another punch to the face, but Poland punching Russia this time~~
"after I punched them in the face!"
"waaaaaaah! Poland said something mean about me!"
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
but yeah, sure. It's all Ukraine's bullying. Boohoo, poor Russia
also, how long has Ukraine been bombing Russia?

.....because Russia's been bombing Ukraine for like, what? 8 months now?
"Rules for thee, but not for me"
like how he apparently expects Poland to keep **their** mouths shut about the bombing Russia just did to them
I was just naming random countries that happen to be most relevant. My point is the general idea of Putin not saying anything about any accidental bombing in Russia
or even necessarily the US specifically
I"m aware, but we're not really talking about the Middle East atm...
<:AriakeShock:986203348296433714>
Oh no! Not things going in a way Putin doesn't like! The horrors!
"oh whoops. A US drone just accidently crashed into a Russian house and killed a small family. We still good tho, right Putin?"
you gonna keep your mouth shut Russia if you're accidentally bombed by Ukraine?
so Russia accidentally bombed Poland (or so everyone's saying, at least for now), and now they're whining because Poland **dared** to be even the slightest bit upset about it? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
shift is over
and now he's off
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
main staff is working his last shift before vacation right now......and might not come back to work after
<:ranygib:971530958685736980>
these services are costing **taxpayers** literally over $100k/year. If I'm not even getting my needs met with all that money....maybe it's time they don't get that money
the client next door to us knows the CEO. I'm gonna ask him if he can help me chat with the CEO, because I wanna let the CEO know that if he **doesn't** fired the scheduler guy and we lose yet another staff that actually fucking cares about their job, I"m gonna fucking leave the company myself and give the medicaid money to one of their competitors instead.
and frankly, I'm fucking sick of it. Both as an empath that actually fucking cares about other people, and a client that **isn't having their needs met because all the employees that are willing to fulfill those needs are quitting.**
but for some reason, the company refuses to fire him
he oversteps his authority all the time completely ignoring his higher ups
I fucking hate the scheduler guy. He's so goddamned incompetent at his job and **heavily** exploits any decent employees the company manages to hire until they break and quit.
"Hey, you know that vacation I approved 3 months ago and that you're going to right now? Get the fuck off the plane and come to work, fucker."
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
all but guaranteed the company's scheduler is gonna expect him to work tomorrow regardless
and on a related note....there's a high likelihood of that exact same thing happening to the staff at this house who is **hopping on a 5am flight tomorrow to take a vacation granted months in advance**
"you are from this country, therefore you automatically agree 100% with literally everything the country's government says and does and therefore must be punished for it!!!!!"
we certainly weren't friendly with Japanese-Americans once the second world war was a thing <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
because they're Russian
but they still get judged for it
most of them **do not want this war at all and fucking hate Putin for it**
I do feel for the Russian civilians in all this, honestly
<:ranycross:962818629437636650>
I'm gonna need some non-Russian sources on that
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
the only people I've heard saying Ukraine has a nazi problem is Putin, Russian-controlled state media, and Megan just now
and let's be real....a nazi-controlled Ukraine wouldn't have the military strength to take out a NATO-backed Russia
which, I get you don't necessarily want to sit around and wait until **after** an attack to retailiate....but in that case you would probably actually have NATO **joining** with you instead of threatening to stop you <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
and frankly, even if Ukraine **is** controlled by nazis.....so what? That's Ukraine's problem to solve. Not Russia's, not America's, not NATO's, no one else's problem. Only Ukraine's problem.

Only when those nazi Ukrainians try to invade Russia does it warrant any form of Russian "liberation".
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
they're being fucking invaded by nazis
well...yeah
I feel like there's more nazis right directly next to Putin than he realizes....
probably more like.....0.000000000001% of the population
I don't doubt there were nazis in Ukraine. I **do** doubt they made up the entire fucking country <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
certainly not as popular as Russia wants you to believe it is
it **is** possible....but I wouldn't exactly call it a very popular choice
"They're harboring the nazis! that means they're in league with nazism! we need to liberate Poland from the nazis now!!!"
and Poland taking in Ukrainian "nazi" refugees....sounds like an excuse Russia would 100% use without any hesitation
Didn't Russia at some point also threaten to invade other countries, **including Poland** after they're finished with Ukraine?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Ukraine who they currently have living at their house for awhile because of all those bombings
and Russians just fucking bombed Poland while also bombing another neighbor, Ukraine
"They just hate white people" Yeah, because white people just blasted fucking death metal in their ears
imagine playing death metal in the middle of the night and then wondering why your next door neighbor is upset at **you** for their lack of sleep <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
especially if you neighbor their country
Russia has given a LOT of reason to hate them
to be fair
being bombed by another country, accidentally or otherwise, will generally rile at least a few people up
hopefully Patrick isn't a fucking asshole and tries making him work during his vacation or something <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>

~~have they tried shooting it yet?~~
are they just kinda hoping that the sinkhole will eat the police station, gag on it, and then leave on its own in disgust?
I get that sinkholes are hard to deal with, but is it really a literal impossibility to do anything about it at all?
apparently they've been ignoring it for **17 months**?!
Still tho
it's a sinkhole, not a pothole.
not everything in life is a conspiracy, after all
I don't entirely dismiss all those "overthinking theories"....but sometimes the reason really is that fucking simple <:SammyShrug:544660008441479179>
probably not a whole lot better....
I'm curious what Myspace would be like today if there was never a Facebook or Twitter or anything <:NelThink:674513359592226824>
relying on just **one** platform means you're subject to the whims and will of that platform. Imagine if we were all **forced** to join the Metaverse because no other social media existed <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
and also have some **other** sites they do a bit of networking on in addition before that new site dies itself in the future
hopefully everyone is able to figure out a good alternative they can all agree on and start networking there instead
twitter shouldv'e never been an **only** platform for that. A **main**, sure, but never an **only**
unfortunately, that's the risk you take relying so heavily on **one** platform for all your business networking needs.
99% certain treason against the US is fucking illegal <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
"Trump should be reinstated because he didn't break any laws!"
probably a poll to see who to ban <:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
wait...IT'S ON FUCKING SPOTIFY AGAIN?!?!
another good choice <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
but if we all go back to MySpace and can use w/e song we want like in the old days....I'm doing Radiant Force <:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
it was pretty cool...but would probably require music licenses to make happen nowadays <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
one of the features of MySpace was you could have a song play when people visited your profile
for MySpace <:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>
what song you using for your profile page? <:GermainCool:736523122324275309>
I've also heard lots of talk about going back to myspace <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
right now this "mastodon" platform seems to be the one people are talking about moving to most....but that's no guarantee mastodon will become the next big thing
Vimeo itself could fall before Youtube does, or even get bought out by Google
so of course, there's still risk creating a Vimeo account as a backup....and then no one uses it even after Youtube's fall
Vimeo **could** be the platform people flock to if/when Youtube dies....or it could be dailymotion....or some other site that doesn't even exist today
and of course, it is **incredibly** difficult to tell which platform people will flock to when another dies, which makes getting in first also incredibly difficult
which isn't something we as consumers can necessarily do much about. Not like the average person has **millions** of dollars just randomly lying around to spend on a start up
and really...the biggest issue is that there tends to only really be one "big" social media platform at a time to begin with
and of course, the same applies to other sites with other businesses....like Twitter
you don't really want to be worrying about post literally every video and doing different thumbnails for both sites, etc etc etc
of course, you don't necessarily want to devote too many resources to this
but it's still better to have a Vimeo account already ready to jump over to if, in the future, your audience itself abandons Youtube and switches to Vimeo, as an example
I realize you can't just like, take your whole audience to Vimeo or w/e if you don't like youtube anymore :B
I wasn't trying to say that at all
"not sure I have the authority for this" oh boy! sounds like an amazing, promising job opportunity!
Trump made his own Twitter in the most direct, literal way possible
Also, lol that it's literally just Twitter with slight changes to avoid a copyright lawsuit <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
It also implies that literally everything anyone ever says is automatically true. <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
That implies a truth can be "truthed" multiple times which.....wtf is "truthing"?
I get it fits the name of the platform... but that sounds so fucking stupid <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
"ReTruths" <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
"Rules for thee, not for me"
even the middle 40% is barely doing anything
it's crazy to think that even if you make **no** efforts whatsoever to reduce your impact on the environment....you're probably still doing jackshit to the environment unless you're also rich <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
because that media is owned by someone just as disgusting as they are
as for traveling to other places for vacation.....plane/bus tickets
in fact if I had the money for said car, I'd probably have the money to just make that move now
I'm still working on moving into Boise proper, too. After that...I won't even need a car to get to Boise anymore, lol
neither of which are anywhere **near** worth the price of actually owning a car :B
only real thing I would need an actual car for is for traveling to Boise itself (which I have staff that can take me in their car, for the most part) or for traveling out of the area for vacation or w/e
but yeah, a bike is much more viable to me than a car even without caring about the environment at all.
<:ranyangry:962818628896587866>
I am insulted, but you're not wrong, but still I am insulted
I live in the Boise area
and yes, I do live in an Urban Idaho city
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
there you go
not even close, kon
that's
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I literally can't even afford to be **given a car for free**
even if I *could* get a car...how the fuck am I gonna pay for it's insurance, fuel, maintenance, legal documentations, etc etc etc etc etc etc
I have no hope of ever getting ANY car, gas or electric or otherwise
so I could definitely see it being both
everyone wants to change the world....just as long as they don't have to change too
I don't remember how well it moves
also, memes aside, I actually wonder about the viability of adding weapons to that gundam <:NelThink:674513359592226824>
well....flee as well as you can in a warship, anyway
guarantee any Russian naval soldier would flee at the very sight of a Umi Bozu
especially doing all this with piss-poor troop morale
good luck fighting a **literal fucking GOD**
There's also that water kami who's name I forget that protected Japan from Mongol invasion **twice** <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I feel like an invasion against Japan would fail even harder than the Ukrainian invasion they're currently failing at.
and that's ignoring any military aid Japan might get from other countries
taking over Japan is a literal uphill battle
for two: fuckton of mountains
for one: island nation
Japan is actually pretty fucking hard to invade
wonder how well that would've worked out
creative people like being creative. Imagine that :B
<:BuckyKnife:668165801563389963>
unless you're talking about Paul. In which case....I dunno <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
over $40 million, IIRC
<:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>
and was told to fucking pay it
he owes tens of millions in damages
not well
Alex Jones?
"a satirist" So the same excuse Alex Jones uses to pretend he's not actually responsible for all the harm his words cause <:HibikiDisgusted:675026015684395012>
I'm pretty sure Mel is just talking USA
....Montreal and Toronto are both Canadian cities <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
though I will admit, most of the Treasure Valley transit stuff is in Boise itself. Not as much in Nampa, unfortunately <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
sure, but it's still helpful for getting to work....and also it's **not** the only public transit Treasure Valley has. Just one of several options
while public transit **does** suck across America as a country...I think you're overselling the problem by quite a large margin <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
there's also a carpool app for people with similar work schedules, ableit I can't vouch for how good it is since I've never had a use for it myself and don't know anyone else who does
per month, FYI
I really don't think spending **hundreds** on a car is gonna let you live *that* much better of a life in Boise, tbh
I dunno. Boise actually has a pretty good public transit system, as I've said, and from what I remember SLC had even better still
there was talks about how they were "working on it" awhile back...but nothing has actualy happened
despite the fact that it **very much needed** when it was around, and the city has grown significantly since
now....Idaho Falls has fucking nothing
Idaho Falls was definitely WAY worse than Boise for public transit...and that was back when it actually *had* transit at all
<:stab:1041518603398299750>
cheaper to pay $150 for a bus once a year than pay $500+ for a car every month
nobody joins the KKK because they're **not** racists
you join a group **because** of the group's ideology
....which makes them more agreeable to extreme ideologies and more likely to consider joining the ideology....
people already don't want to take **any** action at all
how many people **without** such extreme ideologies are gonna want to take extreme actions?
but uh
I mean, I guess that's *technically* true
~~apart from angry social media posting/ego stroking~~
well yeah. Nobody wants to take **any** action at all if they don't *have* to :B
oh yeah, and this also assumes that society still survives in at least **some** compacity after the collapse....which it is FAR more likely we'll have to rebuild from scratch...and different ideologies are gonna compete as we're rebuilding....
and people who don't agree with that extreme and wanna change it again
there will still be imperfections
sure...but the society it creates still won't be 100% in line with that extreme ideology
extreme center isn't the only other option from extreme ends, you know
I'm uh....not saying it is?
agree to disagree on that.
we're never going to have a perfect Utopia...but there will also never be a perfect tyranny with no rebellions whatsoever :B
<:NelThink:674513359592226824>
so does it really matter how evil or not evil or "evil doesn't even exist!!! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>" any extreme is if we're never gonna reach it?
and realistically speaking....neither extreme of any ideology is going to be completely possible regardless
well to be fair, I wasn't necessarily **just** referring to idealogies
nor are they necessarily **equally** evil.
extremes in anything usually **are** pretty evil on **both** sides....but that's not necessarily 100% true 100% of the time
if I'm speaking in riddles....it's because I'm telling a story with subtle imagery or something. It's not a part of my normal speech **at all**
Period
I say what I mean
I don't speak in fucking riddles
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
and then you expect me to also be speaking in fucking riddles and you "solve" the riddle that isn't even fucking there
I never have, and never will understand how the fuck y'all are able to speak in fucking riddles to each other yet somehow manage to have at least *some* understanding of each other
If what you mean is "there's no **meaningful** movement, just fucking say that. Don't just say "there's no movement" and then get upset when I don't just add the "meaningful" part in my head when I read it
I'm autistic
I ain't fucking normal
also, I wanna point out: I have Asperger's Syndrome. I can't read the magical social cues everyone else can, so please don't leave out **important details** in your speech and expect me to just magically infer it like a "normal person"
but you didn't say that
exactly. If you had just said that, I would've understood.
if it has literally no relevance whatsoever....why do Republicans fear it so much and talk about it all the time?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
you could reduce misunderstandings by like...probably 90% or something just by speaking straight
why do they always have to be so damn cryptic?
why can't humans just say what they mean?
don't hide the "it doesn't exist **meaningfully**" part
then just say what you mean, Lank
I shouldn't have to fucking "get used to it"
you're discussing the 20%
which is still a lot, mind you, but you're not discussing the 80%
90% of this convo has just been you assuming I'm 100% in disagreement with you when I'm only like, maybe 80% or something
<:AkiRage:449029983088672768>
I am honestly getting fucking sick of this
THERE IS NO HIDDEN MEANING THAT I'M SECRETLY HIDING FROM YOU, AND I'M NOT AS EXTREME IN MY BELIEFS AS YOU SEEM TO THINK I AM
STOP READING MORE INTO WHAT I'M SAYING THAN WHAT I'M ACTUALLY SAYING
jesus fucking christ, I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IDEOLOGIES, NOT THE FUCKING MOVEMENTS
it gets really fucking annoying when 90% of a discussion is just me explaining "I'm not even disagreeing with you 100%, I admit to certain things"
but it still exists. Please stop reading more into my words than what I am actually saying
also....who's to say those 3 won't pop up again even after complete knowledge lost? We already came up with the ideas once before :B
we have all 3 in the US today
sure...but those 3 ideologies would still be competing with each other
as close as we technically are to nuclear war....I still don't think it's as likely as the news headlines wants me to believe
yup
so
also....people probably won't have their memories wiped
and we have LOTS of books in the world on building hosues
all it takes is a single book on how to build a house surviving...and we know how to build a house
...when did I mention "without knowledge"? Sure that's also a possibilty....but I never mentioned that and am **fully aware** it's even less likely than the total collapse in general.
yet we're still around, so that's saying something
technically speaking, we've been on the brink of total annihilation since.....the first warheads were made, basically
and that reason hasn't really changed that much over the years
there's a reason we haven't nuked ourselves already, for example
not 100% guaranteed, mind you
I would argue total collapse is more likely now than ever before
sure...but Roman society didn't have nuclear warheads or rely on global chain supplies or....
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
people aren't as good as you want to believe they are, unfortunately
but quite a large majority
not everyone
which is generally the very reason you're joining said group to begin with
and that generally happens **before** joining the group
people **can** change their ideologies and become more extremist, Broom
not necessarily
haven't watched any of the vids yet to get the details on it
which, by itself, seems sus as hell and makes me question the legality
...didn't know it was a **Chinese** company selling **Scottish** land
I was tempted when I first saw the ad on facebook, but ultimately decided not to
so....good on the youtubers I watch, I guess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
despite it being pushed by "every youtuber ever", I have yet to see it advertised outside of Facebook ads
so if you're one of those "it's an attack on my freedoms!!!" folks....stay out of Japan xD
Japan still requires masks literally fucking everywhere, and they're **very serious** about enforcing that mandate
:B
you ain't in the US
well yeah
but we should still **at least** wear masks in hospitals and such
we don't need to like, shut down the whole economy again (which is good considering the economy is already struggling to survive at all as is....)
mind you, we don't need to go as extreme anymore
except it's still way worse than the flu and still needs to be taken way more seriously
we completely gave up
maybe it's better in other states, but here in Idaho.....we gave up
and **if** they have a "masks are required" sign hanging up....it's an old sign that no one's bothered to take down yet and everyone ignores
even the receptionists won't do it anymore
even when I've gone to doctor's appointments
I haven't seen anyone wear a mask in public here in Idaho for quite awhile now
I haven't even seen anything about it from the feds in the news <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
It feels like, in addition to all the "it's an attack on my freedom!!!!" folks, there's also a lot of "fuck it, COVID's gonna kill us all no matter what we do".
we don't even bother with mask mandates anymore
it feels like the US in general has completely given up on taking care of COVID
He **genuinely** had to remind everyone that Hitler wasn't a good guy to be praised and worshipped <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
crazy that antisemitism has grown in the US to the point that the fucking president felt the need to post about it <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
These security forces seem waaaaaaaaaay too trigger-happy
That low audio quality makes it sound like small firecrackers rather than gun shots....but more importantly **why were they still shooting after everyone had left?!**
and see if I qualify for that new booster I've heard about here and there
still gonna wear a mask on the bus, tho
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
the entire world will probably be dead in 10 years, tbh
all I can do is hope it doesn't spike up while I'm visiting my family back in IF for Christmas
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
Idaho doesn't care at all anymore
but not Idaho
hell, probably even a state or two in the US
I'm fully aware there are other countries still taking COVID seriously to some degree or another
I'm aware, Cypher
Fate players spend more money on their PNG waifus than CoD gamers spend on weapon skins or w/e
as dismissive as "true" gamers like to be towards mobile games, the mobile games are the ones making BANK
that sounds about right
all dem boomers spending their retirements on gems or whatthefuckever <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Candy Crush honestly probably makes more money than CoD ever will :B
Gamers don't talk about Candy Crush. But something like CNN or ABC? If they're covering a big game, it's probably Candy Crush
because you're a gamer looking at gaming news
mainstream to gamers, yes. Mainstream to the general population, lol no
I've met plenty of such fake people, but I have come across people who genuinely care, so
that's not necessarily true for everyone. I can definitely see people just wanting to buy games "guilt-free" to **pretend** they're good people.

That being said....I'm not gonna make any claims on how many are fake and how many are not
only other way I could think of would be like....charitable donations from the richest
and yeah, it'd be hard to fund UBI without taxes
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
taxes are slavery or something like that
are they breaking apart like the Republicans are too?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
...this does not sound like something an actual Libertarian would say
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
because fuck the way my brain works
and I was taking the joke seriously as a joke again
I'd rather play games I **actually enjoy** <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I'm not playing them
literally nowhere
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
but I'm also not playing these shitty games on my phone so
I"m fully aware, Fenny
though the only important notifs I get generally are the ones from text messages, which works even without internet at all
so I still pretty much get important notifs when I need them
also, I'm home almost 24/7 and using my wifi
I don't really use stuff like whatsapp so
and I wrote <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
I do <:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
but you can't watch ads online and give the ~~horrible~~ devs money for their ~~not at all~~ hard work! <:AriakeShock:986203348296433714>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~time to make shovelware!~~
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and I guess it costs the devs nothing to keep their shovelware up and running ads
well yeah
I guess they have enough players watching ads to get that ad revenue? Or maybe it just doesn't cost much to keep the game up <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I've seen plenty of games on android, at least, that manage to stay around despite being no-names, basically
:|
or have a fuckton of ads, apparently
and if you strike dust as a brand-new company with no major titles to your name....you're fucked
you either strike gold, or you strike dust
oh yeah, but that's true of basically any "get rich quick" industry
~~probably why we don't have a Payday 3 or a GTA VI yet, either <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~
it would probably literally **hurt** the company if they made a CSGO 2
I wish I could make a game with so much staying power, jesus
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
and the fact that it's still going **to this day**
it's crazy to me how crazy people get with CSGO
~~I'm sure I could find some crazy article about that if I looked, tho....~~
I've yet to see any evidence whatsoever Valve is about to go bankrupt with Steam or something, lol
:B
and PC games, for that matter
we like our console games
lots of us are console gamers
Sure....but I don't think anyone here would argue that at all
who wants the try and rack up the high score for most ads you watched in my game? <:FingerGuns:675010756684677130>
~~tempted to make a low-effort cash grab myself, lol~~
which is...pretty much the majority <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
mobile gamers spend more on their microtransactions than console gamers probably ever will
💰
less money to develop, more money to make in sales
mobile gamez, yo
I wouldn't doubt it
IF YOU'RE NOT WINNING LITERRALLY EVERYTHING AT ALL TIMES, YOU'RE NOT A MAN!!!
yeah, that's a major factor
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
and that's why I will never write a dating book
that's probably at least a part of it as well, tbh
it's actually crazy to me how many things men come up with that will "totally get me laid!!!"...and then keep doing those things with every expectation in the world that they'll work no matter how long they remain a virgin....
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Then again probably not. They'd be too damn stubborn to read it
I feel like I could potentially make a lot of money helping men get laid....by writing a book about what *actually* impresses women.
"but the bros care, so **clearly** women do too!"
except I've never heard a girl say that she slept with her boyfriend because of how impressive his dangerous driving was <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
supposedly
supposedly teenage girls care about that
well, going by the driving example, I've seen a **lot** of teenage boys driving around in circles in parking lots (I think they call it "donuts" or something?)
I feel like a lot of men do stuff that impresses their bros..and then for some reason think that women are gonna be impressed by the same thing
90% of what men do to impress women isn't impressive to women at all :B
because all the males are showing off for the females....despite the fact the females are completely unimpressed
there most certainly is
probably would never reach exactly 50%, but you can still get damn close when you just hire good resumes instead of "the right gender"
also, I would like to point out that the ratio, while never reaching perfect 50/50, was getting closer and closer every year
except that example is FAR more common than you realize
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
because female programmers are discriminated against
somehow, tho, I doubt this really is "all part of the plan" as his fans wanna claim
If Musk is doing all this on purpose....I'd really like to know what his end goals are
and lobby politicians so they don't have to
we've already seen how billionaires react to giving up a small piece of their fortune for the good of the world....
which would be awesome but uh....probably not safe to rely on <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I don't think it'll ever reach 100% perfection, but we **can** get pretty close
there are certainly cultures where this is less true, but also many where it is **more** true
on a societal level....men are usually the ones in power and thus, the ones doing most of the oppressing of the opposite sex.
sure...but that's more on an individual level
don't assume literally the entire rest of the world is like your local community, Broom
<:HibikiShock:726645026725167114>
so
also, I wasn't even disagreeing or discounting your point
I would like to point out, once again, that I **have not watched boxing**
still kinda is, but less so and less obvious about it
WWE used to be **incredibly** sexist, basically
but sometimes even when you nurture a child to be the best person possible, they still grow up to be a serial killer or something
from what I've personally seen....nurture seems to play a FAR bigger role than "nature"
nature vs nurture debate
women wrestlers are just as violent as their male counterparts nowadays now that the WWE finally stopped viewing them as "divas"
haven't seen much woman boxing (or boxing in general <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ) but I can absolutely see that
And I will say this right now, Broomy. Just because **you** don't personally experience it, doesn't mean that's not how the world works
Men are more obvious about it, but trust me, women are **just as violent as men**
same with violence
also this
testosterone doesn't have as much impact as it's commonly believed to have, tho
no, but you shouldn't dismiss her personal experience, either
"both of you" being both genders, fyi. Not necessarily two individuals in this discussion
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
BOTH of you suck
90% of what men accuse women of doing, they are ALSO doing. 90% of what women accuse men of doing, they are ALSO doing
one thing about being bigender....sexism is very different to me. I can see both sides of the story easily and realize "you're both fucking idiots"
in a different way, but still **very** competitive
and yes, women are also incredibly competitive
BWAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
but here's the thing
everyone understands that, Broomy
tell me more about how we should be taking little steps to "reduce risk"
all in just 1 or 2 years
Republicans in our country have destroyed a LOT of rights that we fought for **literal decades**
5th, actually
obviously not, no
Aria be old fox
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
sadly, I am
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
33 is still quite a bit older than 18
I understand you're young...but please understand you don't have the world experience us older members do
the world isn't as ideal as you seem to believe it is, Broomy
except it very often takes that long, because again, people in power are fighting against you AND OFTEN WIINNING
and you saying it's not doesn't magically change that
It is
yes, but very often the alternative is "let the bad people win"
so sometimes to make progress....you HAVE to make BIG changes
the problem with that is you're fighting against the ones in power every step....and they VERY OFTEN WIN, causing you to go BACKWARDS.
we don't live in an ideal world, unfortunately
but uh
it's not ideal, sure
avoiding giant changes will also end badly....
it's also kinda impossible, tbh. For the most part you either move forward....or backwards....
stagnation is very bad, yes
~~is it legal to punch them in the face?~~
no, strive for 100% anyway. You'll never get it, but you'll get a lot closer than if you "settle for less"
though I honestly don't think it'll ever happen again before nuclear annihilation or something <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
no one knows what you're saying becasue you're being vague as possible
stop being so fucking broad
because if so...just fucking say that
do you j;sut want to genocide the human race or soemthing?
nothing?
you want to get rid of democracy because it's shit and replace it with.....what?
....then what's the point of this argument?
I'm not pretending to be blind, broom
we strive for democracy because it is, in our opinions, the best we've got
give us an alternative if you hate democracy so much
also
the problem with democracy is the problem wtih literally any human system....it only works as well as the humans in charge
but we very much are not now
and maybe we were **in the past**
sure, we **claim** to be a democracy
You don't understand democracy if you think the US is democratic <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
come up with a better alternative then
we've done it before countless times...
and I want proof that there was an alternative that would **actually work**
you have **way** more faith in humanity than everyone else here for someone who supposedly thinks the world is shit <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
sometimes that's the only hope
but guess what?
I understand you don't like, want full-out war
Broomy, you expect us to go up against **very powerful forces** with bare minimum resisitance
"enemy has a tank, LET'S TAKE IT OUT A BIT AT A TIME WITH OUR POCKET KNIFE"
because that's naive behind all hope if you genuinely think that
you really think we can undo everything the Republicans did in the past 2 years in like, 3 months or something?
ok, that's just straight up fucking bullshit
I actually never thought of it that way <:NelThink:674513359592226824>

Today I learned
this isn't a place to just dump your random opinions and then leave
the problem isn't you or I being offended. The problem is that you make vague-ass statements, then when disagreed with you just kinda angerly repeat those vague statements over and over and over and over and get even more upset when we don't understand you and refuse to clarify things to help us understand. This channel is meant for discussions, and frankly it's hard to discuss things when we don't understand each other and there's never any sort of clarification.
but that's not really the main issue
sure
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
why *are* you here?
so
and you clearly don't want to discuss
this is a channel meant for discussion
I'm questioning it myself
so...I think I'm gonna talk to Mel about your behaviour in this channel in the morning after some slep
and instead of getting it...you're just kinda attacking us
Still waiting on your clarification, tho
I'll admit fault here
ok, I worded it wrong
seems like you're forcing your own image of me onto me
quite a big difference
I'm pretty sure I said it **seems** like you have faith in humanity
you're still being vague as fuck for literally no fucking reason
why state it?
but why tho?
cool
I'm open-minded. If you're intentions were different than my assumption, **tell me what your intentions were**
and you've just ignored it entirely
I've asked for clarification from you **numerous times**
but when you refuse to clarify, Broom. assumptions are all I have
that's...no
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
and then strike that match and throw it on some oil
if you're gonna be bringing up random topics that you **don't** want discussed and then getting mad when people discuss it, you shouldn't be posting it in this channel at all
I feel like maybe you didn't like where the previous convo was headed, so you derailed it with that random tidbit to distract from it.

I'm just making assumptions here, tbh, but without you offering any sort of clarification whatsoever....
literally tho....why did you bring it up at all, and why are you upset at us discussing it in a channel **specifically designed for discussing**
this is a discussion channel, Broomy. Forgive me for thinking you were bringing it up to discuss
just to derail the convo?
why bring it up?
why are you saying it, tho?
you've said that 1000x
ok, cool
why interrupt the convo with that?
but like
ok, I see you were just saying "democracy is shit" at random for....reasons
so....
and also kinda pointless because it's mostly just a "what if" scenario anyway :B
but I mean...if God is the one authority, yours or mine belief system wouldn't matter :B
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
mine both is and isn't
not some human with a giant fucking ego that **thinks** they're "a god"
and I mean literally God. Like, Heavenly Father or Buddha or w/e
this would honestly be perfectly fine if that one authority was like, God or something :B
every movement of any type ends up benefiting the rich somehow, it seems <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
ANCAP SOCIETY, WOOOOOOOO
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
the problem is though....what system of government and **exactly** how involved should it get
though I think we still need **some** amount of government no matter what
I lean more towards a decentralized being closer myself
I don't think there really is an "ideal" system, tbh
but the issues of machines overtaking us or w/e is a seperate discussion entirely
they're getting there.... <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
I saw you demand the same from others in another discussion over and over and over and over....and yet here you are unable to provide specific examples/proof yourself....
I was born 1989
began in 1918 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
no, ended
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
this is literally within my lifetime
I was 3 years old at the time
Yugoslavia existed until 1992
off to wikipedia I go, I guess :B
fuck my geography classes <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
American school sucks
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
~~inb4 Yugo isn't part of USSR or something~~
all American school taught me about the old USSR is "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!"
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
....*did* exist?
I don't think I know **anything** about Yugoslavia other than "it exists" :B
strong gotta protect the weak....except we're also explotiting the weak after we "save" them <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
"it's our moral duty!"
"we gotta police the world!"
"we're the world police!"
oh God, I don't doubt that
like, how much power is too much and how much is too little?
and **exactly** what level of centralization :B
the biggest issues is figuring out the best system for those checks and balances
I mostly agree with anand here.
https://tenor.com/view/jjplushedition-jjpe-snoot-american-america-gif-22306887
ANCAP SOCIETY, WOOO
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
anyway
in the end, I'm not sure humanity will ever find the most ideal solution <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I actually literally do support that idea too.....though I also see some pretty fucking big problems with it as well
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Cypher would agree with me
~~get rid of all borders~~
<:BuckyKnife:668165801563389963>
and with that being said...I was going to bed 2 hours ago <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
hurts my eyes too much at 1am
I"m gonna have to read more later when it isn't dark out, tho
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
man, there's a **lot** of world history I've been learning about recently that feels like **hundreds** of years ago...but was actually within my lifetime
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
~~inb4 blue users get 10,000 word limit~~
personally, I feel like the ideal word limit would be closer to the original. Like...maybe 25%-50% up from the 280
I feel like the current word limit for tweets is too little...but bumping it all the way up to 4000+ is too much :B
even without watching that video, I know numerous ways that can fuck up
no we should not
no
and it's the airline companies lobbying the government to do that.
uh....She's the one advocating **against** that. It's the government that would be allowing one pilot in the seat
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
oh wait, they'll find a way to fuck that up worse, too
guess I'll save my money for a fucking ferry or something instead....if a ferry is even an option at all
Good to know the US is about to make planes 1000x more dangerous **right** as I see hope in having the money to fly to Japan in the next couple years <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
because college in the US is SO. AFFORDABLE.
"McDonald's isn't meant to be a livable wage! You're supposed to only have that job while attending college!!!!"
BOI to LAX, tho....
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~so LAX to Tokyo is safe~~
Semis are complicated. Planes are on a whole other plane (lol) of existence
though, it might be longer than a 1 year contract. Haven't looked into it at all, but I'm willing to bet pilot training is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY more expensive than CDL training
or at least do what trucking companies do and just have you sign a contract to work for them for a year if they train you or something
probably mostly theirs, tho
well, partly theirs, partly COVID
<a:Floof:856315780470931466>
Aria is now a pilot!
the problem is the airlines don't wanna spend the money on training....which is the whole reason they can't just train new co-pilots to begin with :B
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they take flight training school too, right?
I'm sure the flight attendants can land the plane!
don't worry!
I'm surprised there isn't a lawsuit, tbh
that isn't his twitter. He just made his "truth social" website look exactly like twitter <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I guess Elon won't sue because he doesn't want to upset Daddy Trump <:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>
pretty sure that's copyright infringement or something
it basically looks 100% **exactly** like Twitter
I don't even have an emote that properly conveys how much despair I feel about that
God, and after all this the Republicans are gonna shut the government down until the Democrats agree to get rid of my social security and medicare
he'll probably get it somehow, too
unsurprising <:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
drunk drivers will still drive the wrong way, tho
<:NelThink:674513359592226824>
Ok but....what about when two drivers crash into each other?
"she was also driving on the sidewalk" TIME TO BAN PEOPLE FROM WALKING ON SIDEWALKS!!!!
what's next? There gonna be a mass shooting at a school and then the city will ban children from attending class?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
then maybe enforce that law instead of making a brand new one?
oh, and the dude was drunk
how about making it fucking illegal to ignore the speed limit and bike lanes?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
the problem isn't just the legal age, tho. The problem is also how many households have guns but don't bother locking them up properly or anything to make sure kids can't just take the guns without the parents knowing
because young kid brain doesn't understand the severity of the situation and thus can easily justify doing it.

even bigger question still: where did the kid get a loaded gun? the answer is probably "from a house where no one cares about proper gun storage" <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
if the law enforcement actually cares <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
~~someone dox them back~~
as important as the issue is, it's kind of mentally exhausting worrying about literally every random joe-shmoe that might be doing the bad thing
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
so.....let's discuss the issue people care about instead of the twitter accounts we don't?
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
because making sure their car is always pretty is more important than their life, I guess?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
did HBO steal CW's writers or something?
This sounds like something the CW wrote
<:TsubasaUpset:672861878703357968>
~~brb. getting my virtual wife~~
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
just have the bot say "I am a fucking asshole. Please don't worship me" <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
still pretty fucking dumb
"Doesn't reflect my views at all!"
"Hey, you remember all those times I said I fucking hate Jews? *totally* didn't mean it!"
....did someone literally program a Henry Ford ai to deny everything anti-Semitic he's ever done? <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
do eet, cowards
"Hey, let's take a break from being openly transphobic and be anti-poor....which contains a lot of trans folks as well!"
Transphobes are the ones doing this BS to begin with.
....or actually probably **more so**
except the trans folks are suffering from this BS just as much...
~~guess we'll find out~~
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
and now that money is just....completely wasted unless they can resell the lights or something?
a rate they apparently had to **negotiate** for
why didn't they determine how little they actually needed those lights **before** spending $9k on them?
my advice would be to have the heart-to-heart talk with them that Mel mentioned. And if it still feels like this will never end....then you may have to end it
~~though frankly, maybe I should~~
I wish my friends would cancel on other people now and then to hang out with me...but I have yet to **demand** it from anyone
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
competing with literally everyone else (and literally always losing) is...not fun
it causes a lot of contention on my end not because I'm an asshole, but because **I deserve friendship too, damnit**
it fucking sucks when literally no one values your friendship enough to spend any time with you without you being added to another group....as a third wheel
As someone who's literally always at the **bottom** of the friends list....I have to agree with Mel here
and if they make you feel bad for having feelings that are different from theirs....they're the ones in the wrong
you're allowed to have your own feelings
I mean, good that they were willing to stay up until 5am talking to you when you're in a bad place, but holding it against you afterwards like this is....not actually how karma works
this does sound like manipulation
<:PoiOhNo:984481274716639232>
sorry Mel :B
I can kinda see where they're coming from but....I mean, you also need to be allowed to have other friends too, ya know?
it's a "lifting a foot up like as if they're *going* to take a step in the right direction"
it's not even a "step in the right direction"
does kinda feel that way, yeah
it is pretty fucked up, yes
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
also
sorry to be spouting my own frustration alongside Armis's thing....but god I'm fucking sick of this shit
not a single goddamn person in this fucked up world willing to spend time with me more than once in a lifetime
and again, this is in **literally every friendship I have ever had ever throughout my life"**
I've made it as abunduntly clear as I can without going full "dickhead" mode
you know what else isn't a good idea? Saying you value someone's friendship but then doing literally fuck all to prove it
<:ShirabeDone:688198954810474559>
they have yet to actually take that step, and I don't believe for even a second they're not going to just put their foot back down where it was
1 hour is long, but doable
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
it's too long by quite a significant margin
I hate her just fine as is
I'm not God. I don't need to know every single detail of literally every sin she's ever committed ever in the history of ever, ever.
why tf would I wanna watch the equivalent of **two** full movies?
I already don't wanna watch a **single** full movie about her
but like
I know it's more than just the twitter drama
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
literally just take a quick 3-second glance at her twitter or something
I dunno. I feel like I don't really need to spend 3.5 hours listening to someone tell me why they hate JK to know that JK is a terrible person.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
cis masculine men with guns
cis men with guns
because men with guns are somehow less ||rapey|| than men with dresses <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
like, I can understand needing more than "she said mean things on twitter!"
they're gonna have their heads too far up her ass
I feel like if you need 3.5 hours of details to convince the "common person" why you hate her....you're not actually ever going to convince them
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
suicide has a funny way of waking people up to major issues
until someone that made music with his software killed themselves
he did
while I agree they should've posted the source themselves, the source is still very much publicly available
then look them up yourself instead of blindly accusing the article of being wrong about said logs
link? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
of clips? not that I'm aware of
I'm waiting for someone to tell me a timestamp because I am **not** watching a 7 hour stream just to get the context <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I have yet to see any proof from either side about harassment or non-harassment
While I can certainly see trans folks bullying GF Reviews for playing the game....I fully admit I haven't actually seen the proof of it for myself outside of Cisgender-written articles about it, so....
oh god
*girlfriend leaves* "Y'all done did it now"
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
"Super alt-left group of people"
"I know we could be doing better, but we're not fucking gonna try so plz stop hating us"
Dx
it's not fucking working
I have adblcok
god, can't pause and resume or rewind WITHOUT A FUCKING AD
I know I'm just nitpicking here, but...
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
blowing off the racist caricatures like people are overreacting thinking that they're racist caricatures
"and, despite questionable things with house elves and goblins"
"pfft"
jesus, all the ads
<:PoiHug:954390202862952448>
you are already ahead of like, 90% of the human population
recognizing the need to change is the first step in changing
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
your favorite anime sucks
<:BuckyKnife:668165801563389963>
I'm gay, I crime
"God's" rules don't apply to me anymore
I left the church a long-ass time ago
TIME TO SHUN MELUA, EVERYONE
obviously
obviously you are an evil scumbag and deserve to burn in hell
nope, you forgot to do your rounds checking up on your assigned relief society sisters
"Of course I care! That's why I came to knock on your door to check up on you exactly one time!"
"Of course I love you! Just look at this service project I did for you and all the praise on social media I got for it!"
the LDS church is FILLED TO THE BRIM with fake-ass "Christians" who think they can **earn** their way into heaven and convince God that they're good people just by going through the motions that the checklist from the bishop tells them to
But yeah, I've dealt with people like this
and only in the vein of "this isn't gamergate"
though it was only once
someone here did <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
this is just some dude who wants to pretend he's a good person by going down the checklist of "how to be a good person" without any regard to what actually makes you a good person.
unless the spam was a slur or something,  that isn't really the level of harassment he was claiming to be receiving
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I'm pretty sure other chat members would be saying "hey wtf man? that ain't a nice thing to say" rather than "DON'T LISTEN TO THEM, WE BLINDLY LOVE AND SUPPORT YOU NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!!!!!"
I'm pretty sure I would still see the responses to those really bad comments
I saw disagreement....but they were about as polite as you can get with that disagreement
also....did **not** see any form of "harassment" happening to them
too disgusted to hear what other BS excuses they pull out <:HibikiDisgusted:675026015684395012>
closed out of the stream
I am about done myself, tho
just because **you** no longer like the discussion doesn't mean we aren't allowed to discuss it anymore
Then stop screaming at us to stop
call the mods to stop us, then
call the mods to stop us, then
no matter how good they are at **pretending**
yeah, this is not a "wholesome" channel
his excuses
I think I cleared my browser stuff the day after <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
"conveniently", however, I am unable to find said article again
I saw an article earlier where the creator apparently actually thinks ai needs to be regulated
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
I hate how common pedophilia apparently is
Ok, so I probably haven't seen ViVId yet
I'm pretty sure my last season was StrikerS, though
it's been awhile since I've watched any Nanoha
I...think? I don't actually remember the order of all the seasons
I still haven't *started* ViVid :B
or more ViVid
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Symphogear rewatch, obviously
the sequel baiting may suck, but the retconning would suck even more
They don't want to just close the anime's story after a single season, then get surprised with sales numbers and have to retcon the ending for the greenlit season 2
especially since they're almost always an adaptation of source material that likely has more than what a single season of the anime covered
sequel baiting is quite common in anime
likely
so I guess 2 years ago
final episode aired
June 21, 2017
this year is 2019
2017
oh
it was released just last year, apparently
or not enough time
so no 2nd season
according to MAL, there's a sequel, but it's basically just an episode 13 bundled with the manga
never even heard of it, so I couldnt' tell you fi there's a S2
ViVid?
....what series are you watching?
ah
what do you mean? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
poi?
~~just watch it in 480p~~ <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
since they're already illegally streaming
Don't think they'd be able to legally get away with charging for accounts
Unless they changed it recently, no
no spoilers <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
haven't even looked over the season chart yet to decide which ones I wanna try out
I haven't started on ANY anime this season outside of XV
but the "SUDDENLY, ALIENS" certainly did a lot to fuck the show up
I enjoyed Frankxx, even after that "SUDDENLY, ALIENS" bs
the creativity they put behind the costumes in those real life tokusatsu shows is amazing
and I was impressed
I learned a lot both about Gridman and the shows it pays homage to
I watched MB's video on gridman detailing the show and what it does
the whole "animated like they're actually just a dude in a costume" thing is actually pretty sweet
and I can at least appreciate it for that
but I've seen a video on the amount of love it shows for those tastes it does appeal to
Gridman doesn't really appeal to my tastes at all
I've at least come across a screenshot with that other dude
which I know he isn't
would be pretty fucking boring if he's literally the only person for the entire story
I would hope the anime would have more than one character in it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
all the marketing and hype, and literally nothing about anyone other than Dr Stone himself (at least, I'm pretty sure that's his name?)
funny enough, I've heard almost nothign about any other characters the show might have
I just hope Stone doesn't piss me off
in all seriousness though, I probably will give it at least a first episode try
well, maybe less arrogance and more self-importance
Dr stone looks boring, and the MC looks liek the type to piss me the fuck off with his arrogance
nah
~~forgot to do that last season, too~~ :B
off I go~
that is all
SYYYYYYYYMMMMMMMMPPPHHHHHOOOOOOOOGGGGGEEEEEEEEAAAAAAARRRRRRRR
so I"ll be out of the convo for at least 30 minutes xP
anyway, I"m gonna finally get around to XV ep 2
that sounds fun
oh boy
......slowly....
which I am working on
it's better to just understand the language yourself
translations aren't always 100% accurate, though
I probably would seek out all the Symphogear side content if I could understand Japanese :\
ALL THE SIDE CONTENT
and Gegege no Kitaro
because right now my focus is pretty much exclusively on Symphogear
make it happen after XV finishes airing xP
I'm gonna need to rewatch the series from the beginning once XV's over
God, there's so much about Nanoha I've forgotten
woo
~~5 best game in the series~~
~~Osea best country~~
figure out the rest on your own <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
somewhere
"Idaho"
~~like Milaarc~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
My next one will probably be something Symphogear-related
someone posted it in the art channel on the KC server, and I immediately wanted it as my new pfp
My current pfp is one such pfp
or when I come across a picture that makes me think "That would be a really cool pfp!"
I just change it when I'm in the mood for something different
I'm not really changing my pfp for attention
I don't really care either way, though
and usually, so does the KC server
funny enough, my friends almost comment when I change my pfp
but there are a lot of mediocre anime out there that I'll watch to completion, and even go as far as to say "I enjoyed it"
and honestly? I gave it way more watch time than I probably should have
but I still found AoT too bland for my tastes
So am I
surprise surprise, the titans are secretly human all along. who could've ever seen that coming after Erin transformed?
too slow pacing for a story that just wasn't worth the wait
I lost interest after about ep 12
Because catching up at this point would require you to literally devote yoru entire existence to the series
If you do, just watch whatever episode it's on now and don't worry about the rest
So I can definitely see her having watched and enjoyed TTGL
We've seen drill bikki several times
~~Tomato!~~
~~also, you can look up their names on MAL~~
Fujikata
~~and probably yells about how inaccurate it is~~
Ogawa watches Naruto, for sure
Bikki watches whatever <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740> watches with her
~~DO EET~~
~~and I would love it~~
We'd be seeing her fucking Naruto running if she saw the series
Bikki hasn't pulled off any ninjutsu moves, so I'mma go ahead and say "no" on her
Yumi for sure watched Naruto
**don't**
I should probably go ahead and finish watching Naruto, since I got so close
I actually liked some of the dreaded filler
Naruto had it's ups and downs for me
Ice shield <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
~~someone RP Symphogear with me~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and screaming about something you both love
It is nice having fun chats with people
People only seem to ping me when I'm around, ironically enough
~~I could give you an excuse if you want~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~keep it all hidden in a safe~~
~~wait, wouldn't the entire server technically be anime fans?~~
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
....where's my ping?
I don't even remember what alternatives there are (except for maybe anime planet), so I couldn't tell you if any of them are better
and then rated it like.....5 or 6/10
Like, if it were as long as Symphogear, I probably would've finished it
not a whole lot, tbh, but enough that I probalby would've finished it if it were a much shorter series
kinda enjoyed it
I did watch some One Piece
either that, or going back in time and starting on it while you're younger
I actually haven't finished watching GX, either
haven't seen 5Ds outside of a couple episodes yet
~~girls can be knights in shining armor too, damnit!~~
And then a guy duelist who's main purpose is to job for her to save <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
instead of just "lol, holograms"
He actually admitted that magic exists!
His character had grown so much
I loved Kaiba in that movie
I loved that movie
Luck is rarely a good long-term strategy
setting him up for failure from then on
Yugi set up the luck gimmick
and then there's the whole "lol joey" joke throughout the series
He gave Joey the time wizard so he can age opponent's monsters to death, while conveniently leaving out the knowledge that doing it against the Dark Magician will only turn him into the Dark Sage and make him more powerful instead.
Joey lost because Yugi set him up for failure
especially if he can't make it look as cool
but again, just because he kills one, doesn't mean he has to kill them all
Well yeah
and also, just because you kill one guy in self defense doesn't mean you have to kill literally everyone else that glances at you murderously
and THE SHADOW REALM
well most didn't have flamethrowers installed on their dueling stands
lots of "self defense" argument there. He did try killing Yami, after all. Yami just turned it around on him.
~~there were so many one-off villains that arc, I can't keep track of them all~~
or a different one?
Is that the guy that tried burning Yami after the duel?
~~different Yami~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Not to mention Yami would be doing a lot more of it if it actually worked that well
We don't see any of the other mind crush victims coming back all like "hey guys, I've changed now! Lemme be your friend and help you defeat *insert current villain here*
That could be the result of mind crush, but most likely it was just plain old character development
combine that with having to fight multiple battles with no chance to heal/save.
and your lifepoints carried over in between fights, so winning one fight with 100 LP left meant you're basically fucked in the next fight
attack points be damned
you had to REALLY pay attention to the elements in your deck, since opponents could automatically destroy your super powerful monster with a weak one just by fielding the right element
yeah, Reshef was a difficult game
~~at least until his next gimmick~~
slightly similar in spelling to Rusev, but Rusev is a WWE superstar, not some egyptian god or w/e <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
RESHEF
YES
My mind is saying "Rusev", but I know that's fucking wrong
it was.....someone of destruction <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I remember playing a game where you were the MC
Of course, I haven't played TCG games in general for quite awhile
speaking of duel links, I haven't actually played it yet <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
noice
"Which games do I buy? Which ones are even good? Are any of them good?"
and honestly? I'd rather them update one game over and over than have them release 100 games in the span of a few years
well maybe not anymore, but they still update Duel Links on a fairly frequent basis
Hard to keep up when they release so many Yu-Gi-Oh! games
I think I gave one or two of them a try
not all popular things are bad, either. Something that is also forgotten by a lot of people
"I only watch what's popular, because popularity is *always* a direct reflection of how good it is!"
I rarely agree with ratings, even when they're given seriously.
And that's why I don't pay any attention to user ratings <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
"oh no! not that card you've played 100 times before! I can't *possibly* imagine what it does! Please explain its affects to me!"
and one of the villains main personality gimmick is sassily pointing out tropes/cliches
and the heroes, outside of the MC, all just kinda draw cards like normal, sane people
Where the villains all have a unique gimmick in how they draw/play their cards.
If I ever get the chance to, I wanna make my own TCG anime
~~do you have to sing to activate the relic cards?~~
Funny how we came here off a tangent, then went into another one <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
You waited like...20 minutes for an answer. Not everyone's on 24/7, you know <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I really wanna go to an idol concert someday, but I also really don't wanna support the industry <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
yeah, idols are amazing but damn do they get treated poorly
I like the idea of music being more than just pretty sounds
especially to a huge fan of Symphogear and Ar Tonelico and whatnot
the premise does sound interesting
it's been on my "plan to watch" for awhile now
~~maybe I should watch it next after XV~~
....so what your saying is AKB0048 has really good music?
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
noice
hah
"accidently"? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Catch up on Gegege No Kitaro with me tomorrow <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
~~Yu-no watch party~~
*cries in forever alone*
ha
ha
hahah
I find anime more enjoyable, personally
I haven't even really watched any anime this past 3 months outside of Symphogear XV and a couple episode of Gegege no Kitaro
I have so much anime to catch up on :B
grammar, dess
too little, then
just skip the series entirely and don't worry about finding a way to read it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
someone told me it does, but that someone isn't always correct
actually wait, does a windows smartphone actually let you run normal computer .exe?
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
~~buy a windows smartphone~~
literally any human workout regime would seem like shit to him
Genos is a cyborg
I 100% guarantee OPM's regime isn't supposed to be realistic
like, who runs for that long literally every single day?
I mean, they probably have, but haven't tried that **very specific** training regime
including my own
I think that's most people's opinion, Mel
and that means there are going to be parts that are **gags**
and I 100% assure you OPM is, in fact, a gag anime.
If literally everything is 100% serious....then it isn't a gag anime at all
because being a gag anime means there are parts that are not meant to be taken seriously, even if it does have serious stuff in the series as well. Saitama's regime is one of those
that doesn't stop it from being a gag show
plenty of gag shows also have serious discussions underneath their gags
sure, but that doesn't change the fact that it is, in fact, a gag anime
y'all are taking it waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too seriously
OPM is a **gag anime**
Mob worked better on both the comedy and the serious themes, imo
I want to be at my absolute best when I'm representing a series that I love as much as Symphogear
I 100% want to do Symphogear cosplay, but am holding off on even attempting it until I'm skinnier
and she wasn't even the MC
Yuudachi's a better MC <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I tolerated her only because Yuudachi
but that's just because I don't like Fubuki as a main char
I do
yeah, it really helps if you have direction
One problem with taking away the focus from Fubuki is it also takes the focus off her division, which means less focus on Yuudachi as well
I'm hoping S2 will be better now that they're taking away the focus away from Fubuki, but I'm not getting them up *too* high
had a few good moments, but overall was just bad
KC movie was alright, but the anime itself was just.....awful
People only pay attention at all because boobz
with or without boobz
AL has a plot. It just doesn't have the kind of plot most people would pay attention to
that would be my guess
I hope (but honestly doubt) it's going slow because they're making it good
but we haven't heard much from it since
yeah, S2's been announced a long time ago
God I miss purpleeyes
GO TO THE NEXT AISLE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE AT SOUP?!?!?!?
It just tells you they've detected you're using a VPN and tell you to reconnect without it
IIRC, Netflix doesn't even work with VPN's
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
buy more totes
obvious solution is obvious
I need to buy some totes myself eventually
totes are nice for that
and **money**
that requires **effort!**
actually care? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
of course there's gonna be wasted potential
it was made specifically to cater to the lowest common denominator
That sounds like it could be a good "guilty pleasure" show, but also sounds like an incredibly easy cash grab
^
and Nanoha's childhood friends are never heard from again <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yup
still wanna finish it someday
I played a little bit of the PSP Spectral Souls, and I liked what I played
sequel to a Spectral Souls game
that's why Blazing Souls sounded familiar to me
exactly what they were banking on
*spends the next 3 hours screaming in terror*
the.....there's another game with....with those item skills? <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
disk drives are pretty cheap if you really need one, though, and nowadays you can even get ones that are USB
and I haven't exactly had much reason to pull it out
my computer just came with a disc drive
...up to that end part
and I honestly did like Franxx and even consider it a good anime
I can never afford anime, even when it's on sale <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I don't actually remember if it was subbed or dubbed, though
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so I wouldn't know
IIRC, I watched the dub of Cross Ange
and Nana, apparently
~~and some vore <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673> ~~
Cross Ange also had dragons
IMO
Cross Ange was a bit better about it, though
it was two seperate anime series shoved into one for some reason
~~what's Ginga Bishounen?~~ <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
...there are other mechas piloted doggy-style? <:KirikaSpook:605209108827734017>
and when I get Christmas money, most, if not *all* of it is going to my internet bill that I haven't been able to pay yet
I have literally 0$ for anything atm
y'all really like steaks <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~they are a "farm", I guess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~
State Farm Steak? 🤔
"STATE FARM" "STATE FARM"
one day he's gonna snap the ball with "steaks"
I'm watching basketball because of basketball <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I"m not watching basketball because of Curry
STOP TALKING ABOUT HOW OH-SO-AWESOME CURRY IS ALREADY AND COMMENT ON THE DAMN GAME!!!
I only know certain NFL/NBA players by name because they're the superstars who's name gets mentioned every few goddamned minutes
for better or worse
but yeah, names are a lot easier to remember when you hear them ALL THE DAMN TIME
bruh
Hard to watch a bunch of videos on a channel called "Markiplier" where the guy starts every video off with "Hello everyone, my name is Markiplier" and not know who the fuck Markiplier is <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but other than that, I can't really recall too many names of people who've worked on things apart from youtubers where their names are basically also the product.
of course, those are two names that were also mentioned quite frequently back in the day
and the music
and that's just because of how much I loved Final Fantasy 7
the only two "credits" names I've ever really sought out and tried to remember without it being mentioned all the time were Sakaguchi and Uematsu
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I mean, when you go through as much hurt as I have with no one to give a shit...yeah, you kinda become a villain at one point or another
no wonder I didn't know <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
super hero
ah
....who's rdj? xD
I don't pay attention to credits in general, mostly because there's too many names to remember and I am fucking terrible with names <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
"oh, this guy sounds like Izzy from Digimon!"
when I do recognize a VA...I don't actually recognize the VA at all. I just maybe recognize the voice
and the only reason I know Nana's name is because of her name constantly being brought up on this server
I rarely pay any attention to VA's, tbh
but I wouldn't have recognized Nana regardless
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
dunno
uh
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
yes you do
yes
<:PadoruChris:648632748134891524>
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
WHY THE FUCK AREN'T YOU WATCHING IT YET?! <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
right this second now
right now
watch it now
watch it
Flip Flappers is amazing
and I'm behind on Gegege no Kitaro
I still haven't watched anything from last season <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
mine was "I haven't even fucking started yet" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I started watching the OG, but it's been on hold for a long while now
there's a director's cut coming out?
yes! beauty!
I mean, there's always gonna be low-quality anime made <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
I wanna attend that <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
awww
wait, there was a Nanoha Live?
I think I watched it after seeing an AMV, lol
5 whole episodes!
yup, Macross Zero
it was only a few episodes long, IIRC
I only ever watched Macross.....Zero, I think it was?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
that's not entirely wrong
I mean
probably because of that youtube symbol <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I still need to finish GX and watch 5D's
Yugioh's awesome
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but did you guys know that Digimon are the champions?
ok cool
this is coming from a guy who also doesn't like mecha much, FYI
100%
yes you should
yes
though it does pick up again a little bit towards the finale
yeah, not a whole lot of "mecha" action once you get past that initial space battle
there's a *dub*?
wait
Flip Flap Flip Flap~
I have a small collection <a:PrelatiLewd:424299050364567552>
and it's one of my personal favs, along with Symphogear~
Symphogear has a lot of Nanoha inspirations
If you liked Symphogear, you'll probably also like Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha
Flip flap, flip flap~
it's got a little bit of yuri tease, but yeah I don't think Harukana really counts as Yuri
haven't seen that one yet
oh, that one
GEGEGE NO KITARO
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Gegege No Kitaro
<:KirikaSmug:607742561414676517>
watch Gegege no Kitaro and I'll watch Arte
watch Gegege No Kitaro y'all <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
but again...literally no one talked about it except one cultural youtuber.
and that's a series that's been going on since the 1960's
like, Gegege No Kitaro was FUCKING AMAZING, but literally no one talked about it outside of Gaijin Goombah and his community
sometimes I like popular stuff too, but often I find myself enjoying anime others either hate or don't know exist
I find my tastes differ too much from what's popular to really rely on "what others are talking about"
I go through the seasonal charts and see what looks good/interesting

Nekomusume
<:ShirabeStare:675011731801767956>
and still no one watching Gegege No Kitaro
man, this channel sure is active tonight
better?

Nekomusume is one of very few Tsundere's I can actually tolerate
get some meat, girl!
and it's a normal-sized skirt
her skirt is almost double the width as her waist
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
#watchGeGeGenoKitaro
apparently not
~~I kid, I kid~~
why y'all mentioning me? <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it's also a comedy
it is super serious
and even be *good* at both
anime *can* be both
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
friendly reminder y'all need to watch Gegege No Kitaro
There's also quite a few I liked as characters, but would **never** want in an actual harem
shoud've just gone through and done all the ones I know first, because now the "I don't know them" row is so large, I have to scroll up to place anyone anywhere else :B
and Lelouch
~~it'll only take me a few minutes since I just have to drag the few I do know around and then shove everyone else in "I don't know them" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ~~
there's a "I don't know them" tier
oh lol
ok probably more actually, but still
and I would probably only recognize like....5 or 6 of them :B
that would take hours to go through
<a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
that too :B
so many good anime releasing each season, and so little time to watch them all
flip flap flip flap~
and the battles are actually pretty good, IMO
The movie focuses more on the battles than the series does
Watch the movie
||probably more||
||maybe more||
||Elena be as crazy as her sis||
just finished ep 3.
it's nice to be nice, but do you really need to cry over every bad thing? <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>

so we'll see
only on ep 2 tho

the nurses don't wear pants either because it's easier to make "no pants" standard military issue rather than specifically for the witches
underdog stories are usually better than child prodigy stories

sadly, I don't have her anymore
Charlotte was my first Dakimakura <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
I definitely need to catch up on Witches <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
so much pantlessness!
heh
I still need to watch Brave Witches myself
||everyone realized pants suck and no one should wear them!||
oh yeah, I forgot about that
Vividred at least had pretty good transformation sequences
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
NOT ANYMORE
it's anime. You can get away with breaking any military rule so long as you still technically do your job

~~probably should be using spoilers since this is a currently airing animu~~
and I definitely need to look up a version of the OP with lyrics at some point
le poker
might as well continue on to episode 2
I was right about my doubts about her being able to back out at this point
In all that craziness, I forgot she mentioned "living and working here"
~~feel sorry for the poor girl trying to run away now~~
and so far it's damn good
it's a subversion anime
true
somehow I doubt that's an option now
also, lol @ new girl wanting to quit her job already
not really my type, personally, but so far neither are any of the others so :B
this was certainly an interesting first episode
but yeah
and they don't translate the lyrics for the OP/ED <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
which....there's a LOT of signs
one thing I find annoying, though, is the subtitles trying to translate every sign
kawaii song to mature maid girl shooting all the bunny maids
<@99695384296701952> I think I reached that "best part" you were talking about
it's certainly an interesting premise
I'm guessing that random blotted out face is gonna be some big reveal later on or something
speaking of the OP
new girl tries to process the shooting by talking about the paper apron getting dirty
just barely got to that "bunny girl maid shot ded" part
so far I'm enjoying it
I can definitely see this being an edgy shitpost show
bunny girl maid gets shot in the head and somehow the bullet wound starts bleeding in an arch specifically to get all over the new girl's outfit....and then starts up again at random 2 more times just to get more blood on her
you mean Akiba Maid War, right?
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I might give it another go at some point

~~is the anime better now that Ash is actually good?~~
only reason I knew he finally became champion is because of how huge of a meme it became
I was just sayin' I don't really watch the anime anymore xP
oh I'm not disagreeing or anything
was never big into the anime, tbh. and what little interest I had in the beginning died out as I started watching other, better anime
I wouldn't know. I stopped watching a long ass time ago xP

Ash is **actually good** at Pokemon now?!
wait wait wait wait wait
right after Netflix apparently canceled the live-action series
they just....start fucking singing in front of the bad guy
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
uh
Donkey Kong Country had a TV series? <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
||~~inb4 the manager wastes the money and they're still in debt <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>~~ ||
||I'm also curious if the money they got from the sheep cafe will play into the next episode at all. Like, will the Beast Group be glad they got the money. Find out about the sheep cafe shootout and get pissed? Or will it just not even be brought up at all and the manager will somehow be in the same financial trouble as always?||
||I feel like eventually they're gonna be taking on the whole group. It kinda feels like it's slowly leading to that point as the manager (and Ranko, honestly) get into deeper and deeper water with the group leaders. At some point the leaders are gonna actually want them dead dead...and the maids of Ton Tokoton will fight to defend their store, as always||
Akiba Maid War is getting good <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
<@99695384296701952> so uh....||what are the chances the pig maids start a war against the entire Beast Land Group after fucking up one of the affiliated stores?||
Mob is airing too
oh shit, yeah
and now we wait another week <a:MikuQuake:605209236082786355>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
||well....at least she didn't have to kill her sister after all....||
||Oh god, it's even worse now. They've formed a sisterhood bond right in front of a major war||
||Nogami gonna have to kill her friend soon <:HibikiSad:738234648509022368> ||
~~didn't think I'd ever look forward to each new episode of a edgy shitpost show, but here we are~~
I'll have to watch it <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
oh shit, did the new episode drop today?
ok...why is fucking Big Zam sitting in the middle of the ring? <:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
...why is there a fucking UFO in the ring just watching this happen? xD
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
"INNNNNNNNNNNNFFFOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GGGGGGEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRR!!!!!"
now I'm imagining Hibiki wearing glasses and screaming at a text book
info gear <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
wait....you have to pause mid-season to read something in order to understand the story?
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
oof
<@99695384296701952> so..||what do you think the chances are of Nagomi dying at the end of the season? :B||
<@99695384296701952> have you had a chance to catch up on Akiba Maid War? <:PoiPeek:733780388765237309>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
and then they made him black so you can't call them out on it because otherwise you're a racist!!!!
looks like whoever designed Shaggy figured that Shaggy's entire existence is literally just "generic green shirt"
the designs are not a whole lot better
the art style is <:HibikiDisgusted:675026015684395012>
I ain't seen nobody read a book like that unless it was a demon summoning book and they were summoning a demon <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure
...but when in the series did Fred read like, a demon summoning book?
Fred comes kinda close, I guess
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
they all look like low-budget cosplayers
literally **none** of those characters look like they're supposed to be the actual Scooby-doo characters.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
do these folks not realize Jesus Christ is the most woke person in history?
this is especially hilarious coming from a "Christian" community
how dare we be woke
and of course, being "woke" is a bad, evil thing
being a decent person that cares about someone other than themselves is "woke" <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
and "anti-woke" folks
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
"I can't be racist because I have a black friend!"
"see?! We *totally* care about diversity!!!"
probably why they randomly made Shaggy black
anti-woke people pretending to make a woke show
<:HibikiDisgusted:675026015684395012>
it takes awhile for them to release a single episode
Glitch doesn't have the resources to make "bingeable seasons", lol
Netlfix, Star
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>
and making it financially viable
good luck building that home
<a:Floof:856315780470931466>
I used to own the VHS
I think it was the first one I watched
I remember zombie island
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
forget what exists?
different in any way, shape, or form
Nagomi's VA sounds almost like she's never voice acted before, especially when making "shocked" noises
Ranko's VA does **not fit at all**
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
the voices are all so awful
I hate it
trying out the dub for Akiba Maid Wars
<:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
you're not wrong
I mean
I mean, I **love** Symphogear, but if they announced 20 more seasons of it all at once.....I'd be greatly concerned <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
which is gonna stretch any creative talent well beyond their limits, regardless of who they are or how ok with it they are
the network signed on for a ridiculous number of seasons all at once
of course, it was always gonna go downhill at *some point*
it really went downhill after they turned it into a franchise
then again, with a new creative lead maybe they'll take it in a different direction
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
and I shudder to think about how much worse it can get
it got **waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayy** over the top with it
but like
Like, I get one of the main draws of the show is its meta humor
and like, no subtly at all whatsoever in how they felt about having to keep coming up with new episodes
one of the episodes very blatantly had a self-insert
tbf, this last season felt....well
I'm assuming this is the original series and not the recent series <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
watched a few episodes as a kid
I remember Ultimate Muscle
HERO TIME!!!!!!!
~~mostly because foxes~~
This one's of my favorites of theirs~
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK3NMZAUKGw
Also, I'm already a fan of Amaranthe~
That isn't babymetal
as much as I love cats, I would **never** let my cat on top of my expensive Koto like that <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
~~not enough Koto, tho~~
it's pretty good~
I found that video while just searching for Koto music
hmmmm
Ikxi's link has that dot between the u and b as well and still has a preview
wait, no
I think it's the links you're using

World Order are fucking robots and no one can convince me otherwise!
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I was sad
I wasn't able to make it to their concert last month
oh goody. youtube previews are broken again <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!302063351767498752> here's some power metal I personally enjoy. Don't know if it's too heavy for ya, but here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMne2jBQo1Y

El Ragna is a pretty good song~

SAILING ON A SHIP IS THE LIFE FOR ME
<:PirateChris:828645245544824863>
