anyone got a pic of kirika doing the thigh high thing in the henshin scene for xv?
is game any good?
Was watching that, that styles on point
i swear ive seen this hibiki like 7 times in the last week
YO
for the awakened dudes
claymore had a lot of rad designs near the end
had to double take thought those were monsters
acc rt'd porn and deleted it few mins later lol
lmao did u see amelias rt few mins ago
is op this week
I hear they sell a lot of stuff really well though
man symphogear must cost a pretty penny to make with all the songs
one of the seasons iirc they said they didnt do it because there were a bunch of idol shows on
ya no idol concert scene thing this first ep
get that in my veins man
i had to rewatch that 1 for all shit
ep 1 was dope
Cant they unlist them and link to em externally
but ya ur right they can go wherever with it at this point
could get a prequel to do with the custodians based on how this season plays out
wonder if they could do a prequel with the red-haired girl
come back in few years with symphogear shippuden lmao
lyrics screaming hard to beat
man that last bit of the group song feels nowhere as good as the ep version
they put up cd previews for the 2 songs from ep 1
p a r a l l e l s
yo that was an ep eh, the op felt pretty lackluster but it might grow
doesnt really have to be the past, more a state of weakness
nah think they will, the villains power thing seems to do with it
a scorpion that looks like a scarf
it could be a really strong scarf
isnt it the scarf
round 2 for these lads
comeback henshin
its fairly significant tho
good shit
man that little beat into the ending always gets me
thats illegal
they cant really kill miku tho
yeah but its to do with family this time innit
big laser time?
yo that preview
man thats a good ep
u need an acc tho i think
i think u can still download off sites like kissanime
just play off a usb is what u want?
no way to hook ur tv up to pc or something?
u can use it on mobile cant u
üëç
lmao that was mad
man vivids the 1 with that bully scene right
yeah doubt ull find it on youtube but u might be lucky
is the yu-no remake thing any good?
yoo cross ange is a mdoern masterpiece
