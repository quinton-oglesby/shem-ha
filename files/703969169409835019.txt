oh wow I didn't think about that, when I buy my digital tablet I should encourage myself to do something like that
although I think it would hurt a lot if he saw how Tsubasa made a dish with rice
they would have the same fate as Genjuurou <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
good question, maybe he would use a clone to simulate that he eats it
but not enough to withstand Tsubasa's dishes
The suplex did not kill him plus the stabbing his father did to him, but a dish made with love from Tsubasa
Or maybe she will create a dish poisonous enough to kill even a full-grown bear instantly.

Exactly, and to think that they would put a kind of femboy in the game, if they know how to improve it
Understandable, more so with those clothes, but it's not like he officially doesn't wear women's clothes either.

Hibiki being Hibiki, not for nothing Miku loves idiots like her
Also that it has some yuri
I recommend it, it does not have a great plot but it serves to pass the time
Yes, quite good and apart from the fact that it has a somewhat good opening, it's a shame that it is not well known
Sora no Woto, it's like a slice of life but with some action and post apocalyptic


When I saw the first image, this came to mind
Poor Chris üò©
Hibiki super mode berserker
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/99334192

But it will be worth it

<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>

ü§î It sounds better that way
Sorry, the last part would be "will do"
I think it says something like: "Yor-san, (I don't understand the middle kanji), let's go back"

üòî
It is beautiful to see how Hibiki, even knowing that he will receive a severe beating, laughs until the last moment
Oh true, sorry x,v

The more I see Maria in that way, the more I fall in love with her, too bad there aren't many similar fanarts but from Tsubasa
<@331908049822547978>

<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

Curious question, would Tsubasa have a similar complexion?
since she practices martial arts it shouldn't be weird
magnific
Oooohhh I hadn't seen that one before, it's pretty cool
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> definitely

<@277145490087215105>
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
although Hibiki's arm is not a reference to Evangelion?
true, apart from the fact that they used the same formula until xv and it is not so bad but there are many other ways to show a conflict between two opposing parties
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>

I guess I should take this to another more suitable channel
And if they have ~~sex~~, is it masturbating or something normal?

since it always intrigues me when this type of situation occurs between several versions of the same character when they meet
Serious question, if both loved each other (in a loving couple sense) would it be incest or self-love?
