<:HibikiPadoru:516438720082346004>
careful with the suggestion box, gays and girls :v

I'd say to only address it if it is an actual problem in the future
akin to a new game launching, people will be commenting on it for a while
far from meaningless, these are celebratory desses for the bots' return
exposed
<:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>

From the shinais
not that I've found so far, am digging a little
there's this happy Chris if anyone can clean it up, my mouse is not happy with me trying
I don't think it would pass spoiler rules ü§î
he's done it
I saw Saki using it, isn't it from the xdu comics?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/391790928408346634.png?v=1
you know the saying, the more gay the more better
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
pfff, happy basa isn't a thing
just don't have nitro and you won't have that problem
<:GWvictoriaNotLikeBlob:384871121893195776>
rush b, rady
b
I thought it was lightning too
bad Rady
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
there used to be a miku peek, I think
chibi is cute and all, but the current is better
would it replace hibikiHi?
how would a multicolor role work?
aren't all channels opt in channels?
unless conditions have changed, no luck with that one
you give the internet too much credit, Lily
followed by something like "you're getting too heated"
how about the bop?
something simple, like @ aria bop
Says Rady, with enough emotes to fill all the slots in one night
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
You mean remove more dmjii emotes?
there's this
https://twitter.com/discord/status/1055182857709256704?lang=en
who's akira?
I suggest Rady leaves the internet from december 1st to january 7th :v
just click on the link, you lazy blimp <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
that's just pixiv
if you post source, doesn't discord preview the image?
yes, but it wasn't properly working, it seems
just looks like mobile caught up with the age system
to make space for another kirika emote, yeah
come on, it's not a monstrosity :c

people did it before
shinais make everything slow
I know, it's cool
hmm yes pet miku
like?
considering that, what, besides spoilers, do you have to talk about a show?
then probably general
spoiler is anything after the trailer
isn't <#377148557796442134> for that?
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
dud is the maria rn
:v
destructive pet
but you can find that info on <#739277869124943964>
this isn't a suggestion, so probably general chat
ctrl r server pls
is that a serious suggestion?
a role can only have one color at a time
when it was uploaded
what was the emoji's original purpose?
but for real now
*assuming Rady hasn't already done that*
Emperor Radyjko continues his attempt to expand the DMJii Empire
I'll need evidence on that
upgrades, people, upgrades
but it is now fulfilling its original purpose
we all know you have nitro options, mr vertical peek <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
it's the Gwen of the cute name

a message with all the emotes as display?
I can't quite recognize the expression in the smol form
probably overlaps <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Kanade would be the one getting bonked
Yggdrasil System v0.2: Kerrik is now fun
<:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
but fish does approve of dmjii
excuse me, that's not your card to play
Voice chats as ‚Äúemergency meeting‚Äù and ‚Äúbody reported‚Äù
but then only nitro users will be able to use it
yes, you make a static gif
If not, bad idea on discord‚Äôs part
If so, just put the icons and people can decide for themselves
Is there an option to disable the icons client-side?
Not good
I see that as just more visual pollution
what is the advantage of that?
the opposite as in keeping all the color mes?
I think I know what the actual obvious flaw is
So you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs already bad enough for them to moderate chat and you want to make it even worse by allowing streaming?
Not only this, also streaming forbidden stuff like a pirated movie
I bring Melua of the past to answer
as many times as you want
so nothing to lose
people that mute announcements seem to be the people that don't actually read announcements
I'd say go for it, since there was a regular here that fell for one
even if they had, there can never be enough teaching
there might be some that haven't seen the previous
what's the influx on new people here?
do a lot of people use old reddit?
more like omni gay
bi is just double gay
considering it does get filled with messages, would people actually scroll up the channel to see them?
or is a bot needed?
does discord have the capacity to log?
they're usually bound to be incomplete and broken; moderation nightmare
there is the recommendation of not using something that is still new
can I ask you all to not fill <#336299268107403274> ?
What does removing suggestion box accomplish?
I can recommend Dyno bot, records edits, deletes and voice chat join/leave
Channel is made for debating suggestions, good or bad
But who cares, it‚Äôs suggestions anyways
Given that you usually don‚Äôt think much before sending messages, that‚Äôs expected
Achieves the same amount of bloat
2: more general tech will be discussed and will turn the channel into a dual theme, alternating between one drowning out the other
1: creates a correlation of tech only being discussed in terms of gaming, which I presume is what already happens
One of two things would happen
so I don't think anything else will be done
last I remember, ZGundam was unofficially designated as the "reposter finder" for Kerrik to blacklist them all in bot functions
The symphogear, of course
Neither the name nor the character related to Symphogear :v
HELLO
<:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
is mispelling the name a meme?
Kerrik pls :v
I was about to ask why I was the last one to get a welcome message <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
A Symphogear discord ain‚Äôt no place to lurk
I have choir in a few minutes, but won‚Äôt be long til I come back

I have no idea what they‚Äôre saying :v
Welp
Just saw the link being deleted
I didn‚Äôt have enough time to read
What link was that
it very cute
:3

3 seasons worth of Dess frames
well, there isn't a lot in one episode, so I guess it's kinda fine
there are plenty of reasons to keep them
sources deleted, privated, edited, no connection, some times hard to find
keeping them on your own folders allows you to find them way faster
I disagree
I could not understand what you said
what
can I pick all of the categories
Good stuff
it's quite a view

I don't think you can discipline a cartoon
but it shouldn't, because those are not the clothes bad thing had <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
those clothes remind me of bad thing
I did not sign up for this straight
what you mean "wife who's patiently waiting for her husband"
otherwise she can't fight
she probably just found Miku's pregnancy test
the sticks are just moral support for those nearby
she's holding it with her mouth
her face is so smol
I‚Äôll put it there then, just for the record
Is serious discussion or nsfw better to post that?

Kanade sacrificed alone, while Germain did with the other two
The gayest harem

Then jii_skip just turns useless
As far as I know, <#407060923078017026> is for everything
Precisely why the suggestion of another channel specifically for art dumps
If that‚Äôs what it is for, then why are people complaining?
Just as a suggestion, what if a spam channel is created?
Isn‚Äôt the point of this channel to post art, tho?
I‚Äôm one person that can digest image dumps
Anything symphogear
I‚Äôll accept dm dumps as well, if you can :v

you probably would like to do your thing in twitter

then I don't see the point of letting them follow you

Chari's explanation does make sense
what I don't understand is drawing a canonically alive character being dead
that's not what I mean, drawing a canonically dead character being alive I understand
but just "hey, here's a dead character" is very weird
if it's for a greater context, like lore, it makes sense
if someone can explain it would be cool, but I find it weird to draw dead characters
do the characters actually die?

3_skip I feel like this would do a perfect reaction image
so if something is subjectively nsfw, it should be put in nsfw chat, right?

does that sound similar?

like a what now
does seeing the inside of the skirt of an invisible character make it lewd?
now I'm confused, that was posted in nsfw
Gudako
also, the best guideline is people bonking you when you get it wrong
for the example of swimwear, it would depend on each swimwear
the guideline is "if you have doubts, it's nsfw"
~~reeeeeeposts~~
there's an artist here, Ferrous, that does a lot of that content, and it's always posted appropriately
hyper muscle is something that is spoiler tagged or moved to nsfw

<@!266379640069685252>
not only that, it was the person you tagged
trauma is not solved by seeing it sink into the sea
why use embed command for only one picture? ü§î
the first image is a jpeg, which Ygg doesn't do
I think these warrant a 3_skip
those look too big
cute
what's the catch?
then <@!266379640069685252>
bad ping
aaaaaaaaa
dis Samus?

Sana is beeg

source says it is dad indeed
isn't that Carol?
they were made before Lui's debut
left side I can read most of it but I have no idea what it means, but Chris starts by saying pachinko again
right side they're all saying pachinko
do not tag
baby Lui and Matsuri were cute
if you have source, do 3_skip
saves the bot a query
you are what you eat, so Chris probably tastes like spaghett

ty Kerrik
can you remove the source link too?
<@&336302034070536192>
also, no one seemingly not care then doesn't mean they don't care now
can you link the message?
it's even tagged as R-18G on pixiv
I wouldn't call that one sfw, Phantom
such is the law
if it's a liquid, it's drinkable
but you did express concern about the description, so that's what I'm weighing in
in case of doubt, nsfw is the place
I just need to get through winter so I can see her heart events
I'm thinking of marrying her, she's a cute bean
haley!
haley?
deleted?
Chris' barrier looks awesome
Why would you use that system tho
wot

no love for Miku
*corpse raising*
they're clearly christmas lights
swan song doesn't kill anymore
Hibiki would've melted the vampire girl before she could have killed that girl
wot
when I saw that thing, it looked as safe as the thing Carol was building
I wish she had an actual sniper moment, would be 10/10
isn't gear technology as well? Aiming probably comes in the package
no way I'm working in that thing
"have to" are strong words
classic
can't she now?
Kinky Fine
YES
ELFNEIN GETTING HELP FROM KANADE

death to the old man <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
abnormal operations
Bikki isn't even in her second form
~~yes the lewd details~~
Bananoise
so the reverse of what happened last season? :v
Hibiki will kill him before he succeeds
good shit on this episode
I‚Äôm not big into drama, so I can‚Äôt agree or disagree
But I mean, why kill any character turn 1? :v
You say that, but Kanade was killed turn 1
Don‚Äôt hurt my Miku
*no*
<@!263983345669505025> I don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs a good prediction <:GWmythicalFeelsSadMan:374568771421208577>
It was at least 2 buildings

Now you guys are talking the good stuff
keyword?
It didn‚Äôt give you what you wanted, but what you needed <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
but how is Fudou going to succeed on killing Miku?
just watched 8 <:GWnkeHYPEREYES:373159877931171860>
the final boss is the friends we made along the way
which means Miku :v
a lot can happen in the last 5 episodes of the anime :v
I must share the pain
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
he said that XV could end up with the reverse of season 1 end, which was Miku on Hibiki's grave
about last pic on <#601872369660854272>, my friend just made it worse
well, you read it now :v

with Shem-ha already possessing Miku's body, I don't think it can become unpure
Who was the evil mimic robot?
do they believe Fudou holds more power than the gears?
question
basically
especially after "the car is falling, that's your fault"
I don't like Vanessa
Can the gears get hurt by bullets? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
was happy to see that
those 3 are dead <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
high five o/
they'll come back dead <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I hope they're dead
or the god will use you for something, so you're not dead
when you get stabbed/slashed by a god, you're probably dead
that neck
when Bikki offers you The Friend Hand‚Ñ¢ and you don't take it and keep being a mass murderer, you definitely deserve it
it was deserved
if nobody ever gets it, why do you use it?
*he's dead, Jim*
Hmmm watchu saaaaayyyy
can Shem Ha resurrect/summon dead people?
a thing I thought about for this last week
but if that were to be on Shem Ha's side, it would be difficult
Kanade also holds the god killing weapon
I mean
precisely
it's Shem Ha resurrecting other dead people
but anyways, Shem Ha resurrecting Noble Red is not my concern
can she regenerate when almost dying by lack of blood?
god was outdone by tech?
so both the device and Shem Ha were fighting for controlling the car
what worries me about the god power level is "let me casually mind control a god"
6 gears vs 1 god and 2 gears
but I also wanna see Serena as well
I'd be happy if it happens, I want to see Kanade again
trauma
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
now that you jinxed it, it can definitely get worse
it's chill
I like slice of life
so she can resurrect people <:GWimmoThreeC:396057766793576458>
did Shem Ha empower them on purpose?
black panther has twintails
nice pfp, Millhi
might as well be randomly disregarded
and where did you get that from?
why would it be a spoiler?
oh
what foreshadowing
a Very special time
<:GWsiraSataniaHAhaa:398886125873135616>

I don't think Carol will be back again
You can basically download them from the internet
smol Millarc was cute
just watched the episode
what about smollaarc
open ending?
the ovas will probably make it easier to move on

I waited 2 months to check my grades on my last semester :v
go eat popcorn, just wait some time
how recent?
you're having transgender feelings?
it's a great explanation already, thanks you
oh
to this day, I still don't know what being left or right in politics means
left? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
ibu, were they ok with it? no bad reactions?
that wasn't the case for me, with the exception of one person who read me like a book
Thanks for the talk
Gotta attend to an anime event, I‚Äôll be back in 8 hours
So it ends up being the same
But it‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou‚Äôve never done this thing, but each make a mistake will deduct 20% of your grade‚Äù
He doesn‚Äôt try to fail us
They wouldn‚Äôt accept if it had been
It wasn‚Äôt exactly half
Literally half the class failed that one
The class we had with him last semester was the same chaos
I hope that can be true
If he doesn‚Äôt accept it, I‚Äôll just ignore the rest of the assignments and work at my own pace
I‚Äôll have it done by next class (friday)
But I won‚Äôt go there until tuesday, so just dying for now
I can get it working by next class with the backup I have in school
I sent a tiny text explaining it
Fuck, we don‚Äôt even know how to make audio effects/songs
Things we have never worked with before
‚ÄúI gave you enough time to do this thing‚Äù
That‚Äôs the entirety of my college course
Would need to ask him directly just to hear front row the same ‚Äúyou should have planned better‚Äù
And the system only accepts the file until a certain date/time
Plenty of people have tried
Yes, unity
I'm actually crying
it pretty much went from 0 to 100 in a day and back to 0 in 3 minutes
but won't get any grade for it, the teacher doesn't accept anything late
the project can still continue, it's saved at the college's computer
guess I'll fail then
the game just gave up on working
welp
my semester's grade kinda depends on this
is anyone here familiar with Unity's collab system?
eggs? <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Tiny Miku is not pleased
and the fact that he makes me drive while saying "can you go fast please? I'm late" and sitting on the passenger seat instead of driving there and just asking me to drive back
which is a freaking 10~15 minutes walk from home
I can talk about my dad wanting me to wake up at 5am to drive him to the ferry boat
I gotchu
is there a report tool ingame?

just tag me whenever and I'll respond as soon as possible
sleep tight
I had the same thoughts about masturbation before, but I crossed that line long ago
yes
got some other shit do deal with first
yes, but I also didn't start yet
what about me
new checkpoint reached \o/
most definitely
sure, some people don't get the same, but if you do, nothing wrong with that
I'll point on top of that, you just do it because it feelsgud.png
oh, that's rough :c
do all the dirty things
I can definitely recommend doing the dirty things
but did things actually change or are you just perceiving them differently?
I have no idea how autism works, so I can't say much
do share
That‚Äôs op

also I got the best gif frame
makes me very happy to read those nice HRT changes
gonna drift to sleep, cya nerds

hope so too
*well played*
E?
I'm really hoping that Miku does something next season to get me to cry
**and I still can't**
I *always* listen to Chris' swan song followed by bark at the moon
Chris' swan song gets me emotional, but even tho I really try, I can't cry
more of a reason to cuddle
I want cold
but I legit can't bring myself to have a happy cry
I only managed to cry in the time I was working at the US, because of a girl
jokes aside, I actually have wanted to cry for a looooooooooong time
Tom Holland is the new spider man
lol no :v
he is the new spider man
I didn't need to reply, he was already crying at that point
I didn't get eviction threats, but I did get a screamed "I'm not gonna spend a single penny on this" from my father

slowly getting there
1 year later my mother got me on a psychologist
<:GWqlabsLove:392307831363076096>
for the record, <@!246146781832806401>, I was just joking there, mb :v
never heard of it <:GWossuKannaSip:395627468276367370>
confidence?
I has ramen
you called?
I‚Äôve never gone over 85 kmh
100 miles sounded like an actual death wish
R u guys ok
But then I remembered ‚Äúwait, they talk in miles, not kilometers‚Äù
I was reading the speed parts thinking that driving at 80 on freeways was pretty ok
but it is calm now :v
pardon me
oh <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
a joke as a joke is fine, but he tried to make an argument out of it
in the way you put it, it's very bad
it's clear that you want them to think the same as you
there is a fine line between "exposing a point of view" and what you're doing
I keep forgetting discussion is a false cognate, thought Alice wanted to fight :v
and that's bad
but ye, if you sleep too much, you'll feel like sleep much more
there is a good scientific explanation for why that happens, but I can't remember now
is she going to act in the movie as a woman or a pre-surgery trans man? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
makes me want to throw my mom out my window
"I know about trans people but you don't know about yourself"
fourth, my mom used similar lines
headpat
third
WELCOME TO THE PARTY
second, YAY
first, that's what the Kriisa means then?
ok so let me get some of the feelings out one at a time
where have I been since I joined this server <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
wait Saki is trans
what are those, those are new to me
then proceeds to everyone using trans girl after that
"hi I'm trans
MtF of FtM?
MtF"
like
I just use it for convenience
do people actually call themselves MtF? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
sometimes I just imagine the stupidiest shit
"boom, perfectly done"
and I imagine someone going like "ok so we delete this one, ctrl c that one and ctrl v here"
I always think of "Gender Replacement Surgery"
so in 3 weeks I might get some tiny progress on the run
the week after that is the trip
next week I'll talk to her
I don't have depression, so I knew what my feelings were
and lots of feelings flooded last night
"how the fuck will I solve this without solving myself first"
but now it's hitting me
wanted to solve my social phobia problems first
meanwhile I'm one of the most patient people ever
Saki is freaking speedrunning transition
aye aye, captain
latooni knows the good stuff <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I'll be right behind you Saki
I'll probably talk to my psychologist to start things right after I get back from recess trip
that reminds me I never actually told my boss back in park city about it <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
F
and actually, names are very powerful knowledge
knowledge is power
don't ask, I don't even remember :v
like me, at some point I was "Ostrich" in the internet
well, things change
oki
will you keep Sakimori as internet name?
noice
how's it going so far?
bad things aside
well done
oh
starch?
good night, my potatoes
gonna drift to bed
like William "Scarra" Lee
because whenever you see those, it's for professional gamers' names
I've never seen any like that
probably "first name - how many middle names you want - last name"
but I mostly only use it when talking to myself
I even have a third name
but it's not Tiny Miku :v
heck, I might make it my last name when I get to that
I could actually use my online name irl
that will probably save you from the insanity
remember that some verbs can be written in 72 different ways
if you do get back on learning the portuguese
I see, I see
I'm curious about any person wanting to study brazilian portuguese
may I ask what brought you to choose that?
do any of you speak portuguese?
don't forget the fisting girl
you just need to know how to have a young mind
better to learn irl or internet?
I'm kinda far from canada and france :v
wot
any tips on learning le french?
might not be so serious, but gonna ask here anyway
That sounds bery vad
I‚Äôll probably get started soon, so I may need to step up my pill swallowing game
But I feel like it may be with the estrogen
With things like fever medicine or some casual shit, it‚Äôs not a problem
Because I‚Äôve only swallowed whole pills like 3 or 4 times in my whole life
Not properly chewing, but just dividing them into 2 or 3 smaller pieces
How bad is chewing pills?
Heck, I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible
Oh <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
What are patches, tho?
Is it pills?
For transgender purposes
Patches? ü§î
Pills? Liquid? Shots?
How is estrogen taken?
Question
But I‚Äôll try that neutral party thing
My sisters always take the wheel on father‚Äôs day
I don‚Äôt gift anyone unless I 100% feel like it
I‚Äôll probably just start doing to him what he does to me
Any tips on this?
My father is slowly becoming more aggressive when we point things like these
My father did the same thing today and tried to throw the blame on me after I told him to not do that
Going straight to the point won‚Äôt hurt
But it‚Äôs so stupid and annoying when people do that
Rip
And I asked her how was I supposed to eat hot food and if I should just wait ages for it to not be hot
Instead, she almost screamed and complained how I should not blow hot food
An example, once my mom wanted to tell me to stop being loud when blowing hot food
Does anyone else‚Äôs parents try to teach something but word it as something else?
Getting sick mid-trip is a blessing
‚ÄúDeal with it‚Äù
‚ÄúDad, what do I do if my ear starts to hurt in the middle of the flight?‚Äù
I see
<:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>
>nature will transform excess male into female
well, let's say you can have a lot of "first thoughts"
like thought 1, then thought 2
but from what I get, you mean the literal second thought?
I don't think I understood your point correctly
try me <:GWossuKannaSip:395627468276367370>
*yorin the fuck are you thinking*
<:GWqlabsLove:392307831363076096>

smooth skin is quality skin
because the country is too big
not even Zolg lives close to me
I'm just stuck here alone
there's an entire ocean between us
where do you live?
meet me in the pit
so following the heart needs precaution
but my mind knows I'll probably get arrested with that
my heart says "go and randomly hug girls"
yuri on ice is about yaoi on ice
that's literally it
rip the yuri on ice dream
here, we see the wild Alice in her natural habitat, recruiting more transgenders
But that‚Äôs what I said :v
On cuddling too, I want to be both the one playing with the hair and the one getting her hair played with
‚ÄúSee this bigger being here? It‚Äôs mine to toy with‚Äù
It‚Äôs a best thing
The taller being dom is common, so the opposite is quite the appealing shock
But I also see myself being the sub of a smaller girl
Since most girls here tend to be kinda embarrassed by being smaller than me, being dom will be ez pz
When I do get mah boobs, hugs will usually be smoothening
I can easily just tower over most girls
I‚Äôm tall, so being the dom is easy
Well, obvious stuff first
Let‚Äôs see how can I put this into words
Oh, I see
What do you mean? ü§î
Being a switch, the situation of having a concealed vibrator in public while giving the controller to someone else is *very hot*, but the opposite is just as *hot*
what's wrong with the chinese mythology skin pack?
my closest family (parents and sisters) know about it, but still
me around everyone
too short to not be the gay you want to see in the world
<:GWfroggyAngryEyes:398570363237433354>
here, use this, Saki
turn down for what
you derp
I don't mean a literal race
"boy glasses"?
wot
I'm racing Saki, ibu :v
already got them glasses
I'll race you
damn right the right one
You‚Äôll be busy with your eyes rolling up
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
It‚Äôs much more exciting in the dark
Inb4 Latooni is actually Latinoo
Kerrik‚Äôs demise
LOLOLOLOL
You can‚Äôt unprove summer is too hot tho :v
But damn is it hard
I‚Äôm trying to get a girl to cuddle with
It‚Äôs winter here, so cuddles are extra good
just tell them how propaganda works and say that things say "for boys" because it's way more common for boys to play with those
(usually)
children won't care
but guys
hotwheels is the real shit
teaching of the genders will be ez
if they learn respect, and you respect them, everything will be fine
it's better to teach your child from the start to respect anyone
but me? no I don't know about anything
can still remember my mother saying that older and younger people than me could say with certainty that they were trans
my parents did the same thing
people being "fine" with it until it happens to them
that's common
shit will hit the fan when I tell her <:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>
she doesn't know about me, and I'm like her favorite grandson to hug
interesting point, my grandmother doesn't agree with anything lgbt
<:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>
even if I told them I'm trans
I'm one that really doesn't care about people calling me boy right now
But I‚Äôm getting dragged either way
But I still want to study to git really gud at them
Like the middle of the week
But I have 1 matrix list to solve, 2 calculus lists and 2 assignments to be done online
No
Mom already left the threat saying ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt wake you up but you‚Äôre coming with us‚Äù
I don‚Äôt want to go to this trail and I want to study
what do <:GWpinkuSadOtato:393081466176667648>
I just want to study at home
my parents want to drag me early in the morning to some random trail
In the path of knowledge, there are many mistakes to be made
although my problem person will mostly be my mom
I get what Saki is saying
deleting it and apologizing seems sufficient enough <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
and then the comment was deleted
sounds more like "sorry about that other person being allowed to post this, we don't want to offend anyone"
and the one who wrote the apology is a different person
not really, the account is probably run by more than one person
looks very polite
I don't think it is a "sorry you got offended" apology
I won't hide anything, dun worry :v
might be able to on wednesday <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
I will have to check that
she didn't exactly position herself in the matter
butt
cause she's straight
and I did tell her I will transition in the near future, so at least the "losing a planned future" won't happen
I did talk to one girl about it already
I see
deets?
I always confuse the two terms
ty
dat
and all of them are just so cute and loveable
but I think I fall more to the polygamous side of love
I will tell each of them about it, sure
not simultaneously, ofc
is it bad trying to go out with multiple girls? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
which is a great game
and these are the devs that made The Witcher series
you can also analyze on the other side of the coin, just because a game dev is super nice doesn't mean the game will be good
to me, it still looks like they did acknowledge it
you can never know for sure without playing it
but the game itself doesn't have that kind of joke in it, does it?
what does non-stance mean?
I have taken weird route choices and they are absolutely fucking working
ALRIGHT BOIS AND GURLS AND GAYS AND NERDS
*slams hand on table*
I think she will understand it all
we did agree to talk about everything that happens between us, as part of the deal of being together
but it does seem like she understands what is going on
I did not talk to her about all this part, but will as soon as possible (possibly today, in 3-4 hours)
on the other hand, smol girl certainly saw me and cute girl's interactions in the trip, but still wants to be with me as I want to be with her
she's still confused about it all, but did thank me for the talk, and we will talk more until we she can figure out what will happen
I did tell her I want to be with her as well as with smol girl
I did tell her I would provide her love and attention, no matter who she decided to be with
I talked to her today after lunch, we did mention all the things that are taking place in all this mess
she does like me, but has a lot to think about, including her 10 months boyfriend
and at the same time, since we first time we met we felt something in the air
they have had arguments before, which she also told me about, but they still like each other
when we got here, around 9am on saturday, her boyfriend was waiting for her in her place, and she told me he realized he had done wrong and wanted to talk with her
she told me about the argument she had and all, I talked to her and we snuggled to sleep
I took my place by cute girl's side and asked her what had happened
smol girl wanted me to stay there with her, but understood I was also sleepy as fuck
me, smol girl and some of the others were singing (as usually happens on trips) but we both noticed her
by 1 am, like 30 minutes into the bus ride back, she went to her seat
they were arguing back and forth, apparently he didn't like the fact that she left for the weekend to take part in the choir
it was with her boyfriend
and here's the other big problem
now, on the way back to hometown, cute girl had been messaging on her phone since friday
dinner happens, more interaction between me and the two of them
after we finished singing, both girls and 4 others kissed mine and this other choir friend's (who also had a solo part) faces, we were full of lipstick marks, it was a nice feeling
even with so much help, I was still crying on stage but managed to keep myself together while singing
and after this talk all the way until we got to stage, both cute and smol girls were helping me stay calm, holding my hands and hugging me
takes me to a talk, she told me how she went through the same thing, helped me calm down and all
so this one contralto, who has been part of the choir for like 4 years
I thought I wasn't up to such responsibility and yadayada
I was just disassembling right next to everyone
the amount of responsibility involved and the whole situation brought me to tears right after the last practice on stage
so it was me and my other friend to sing the bass line
the other had to leave 1 hour into the trip because he was not feeling good
one of my veterans (we are the bass voices) had to leave us the week before, he graduated and work was taking a lot of his time
while there, everything about the choir hit me, how it was my first time traveling with them, how it was such a huge deal, and the fact that, for the first time, I had a solo part
but cute girl has something about has that just attracts me
I was already engaged on something with smol girl, so it was a given
on the time we were there, resting after leaving the bus, eating and getting ready to the big play, I was either talking to cute girl and/or smol girl
cuddling happens between us, always making sure the other wouldn't be uncomfortable and wake up with a sore neck
so overnight ride, everyone would sleep besides their partners
we got on the bus at 11pm friday
she accepts, all gud
so I asked cute girl to be my seat partner
smol girl already had a seat partner (which happens to be the choir girl I was talking to when I first met cute girl)
everybody was excited, choir travels are a HUGE thing, and as always we went by bus
our choir took part in this country-wide choirs meeting, and it happened on the other side of my state (533 kilometers away)
fast forward 2 weeks, aka this weekend that just ended
after about a week, she checked her time availability and did manage to come back
we started talking through messages, and I incentivized (does this word exist?) her to come back to choir
about a month back, we met properly for the first time when I was talking to another choir girl and cute girl happened to recognize her
so cute girl had been a part of the choir before (all three of us are now), but had to leave due some heavy personal things
(both of them are cute as heck, but this is just for referencing which one is which)
now, for the second girl, and for reference she is the cute one
hugs and kisses already happen
but until then, we'll see where it goes
she is straight, so it will have an ending, at some point
and we agreed to try something
it was a very deep conversation, but she totally supports me, said she will be there for me as a friend whenever I need
I told smol girl about my feelings, the fact that I'm a transgender
I talked to the first girl, and for reference she is the smol one
anyways

live footage of Kerrik
ok? ok
me, the tallest tiny miku, am a transgender
SO
and you all need context, because we're not together yet
the three of us know that communication is *the biggest* variable to assess
this includes several variables and not just "hentai with senpai harem"
trust me, this is nowhere near a visual novel
and that means I may have two girls to love in the near future
<:GWqlabsLove:392307831363076096>
Now both of then know I talked to the other, and both will still follow through this
But she did assure me that it was because our relationship has a time limit, after all
As with cute girl, it was a lot to take in at once, even if I did talk to her about liking more than one girl at once, she let some tears out
Talked to smol girl, she understood my position and is willing to understand it all
Update on situation
OK SO
thanks you
I have 3 thousand lego pieces, walking on eggshells will be ez :v
now, to break the heavy mood
and yes, I'm being very careful, hence the usage of "I think this will work" a lot
jumping to conclusions won't do bad, as long as you understand that all of these are still just hypothesis
gonna take a bath, brb
current me is on the next dimension
therapy and the meds I'm taking allowed me to take this many decisions at once without overthinking
"Me: Never had a relationship before and the first time will end up being two at once? Sounds dangerous.
Also me: hold my beer as I platinum this life stage"
I am also telling myself that
and I will not regret a single second of all this
I will make the most of all
be college, be family, be love or myself
but now I do feel ready to assess anything that happens
I have given up on expectations long ago
my current life is walking on very unstable grounds
I do think it's weird of me feeling ready for this and on the other hand not feeling ready **at all** about carrying some heavy responsibility in choir
I will nurture that, and, on this first moment, smol girl will get an extra of my attention, if so needed
both of them told me I give them these love feelings that mess with one's head
not only I will not cheat on her, *and for more than just that reason, obviously*, but even after our relationship ends, I will help her with her future
she had a boyfriend cheat on her before, I want to protect her from that
so I will do my best to make her comfortable as a lover while I can
in the end, me and smol girl will break up, transition will take place
by with Y, well done me
she did say that she will like me no matter what form I assume
btw, smol girl is straight as I mentioned, and cute girl is bi
and she does seem to still want to be with me until she draws the line on my transition
and that includes smol girl
well, I don't think there is a single person who didn't notice the interaction between be and cute girl
if it works I might just implode
but I'm just so happy with all of it
I know, I know, still waiting for all pieces to take place

I'm just
and if all comes out in my favor, my first time there will be two
I have never had a girlfriend before
"*there's no fate, take controOL, BRAIN POWER*"
damn, that was a lot of typing
*end of story time*
so it looks like I may have 2 girls to love in the end

that is nearly impossible
I understood her side, I don't want her to have it bad, so we just agreed on it
smol girl told me she actually doesn't want to be with me because she'll get too attached and breaking up later, when my transition takes place, will be too painful for her ;-;
I have come to give a report on the situation
I'll need polyamory if I want to reach an "end"
what do I need to compromise with?
I don't know other schools and I have like 1 day to choose
and now I just got the notice I need to choose another school to do the observation because the one I picked doesn't have available spots anymore
I just want to love and be loved
I don't want this to happen
smol girl is imploding
I'm close to exploding
I‚Äôm scared
But it‚Äôs unsure
There are a few moments where she doesn‚Äôt need to hurry to work or needs to do an assignment or something and I can meet her
And I have classes at night
The problem is that she studies in the mornings and works in the afternoons
It‚Äôs not of me to think of people this way
But I shouldn‚Äôt think like this
What if she does this to me too
But what if I‚Äôm wrong on this
Whenever I catch myself thinking ‚Äúoh, what she is just taking it a tiny bit further only to end up in the same as others‚Äù I try to stop myself and think that she is too perfect and too good to do this
I know I shouldn‚Äôt apply this ‚Äúlogic‚Äù but my brain does it anyway
My problem is that, like almost 100% of the time, if not for sure 100%, this kind of thing has gone south the way I thought it would
I will appreciate any advice
And can‚Äôt think properly
And since I have too many emotions bottled up (basically an entire life worth of emotions), I am very concerned for myself and how will I proceed
And while my reasoning tells me I shouldn‚Äôt worry too much, because talking is required to go through the entire situation, my emotions are making me worry that things will go south really quickly
And now cute girl (we are kinda going through with this, she broke up with her boyfriend but is still trying to understand her feelings, doesn‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll date me or go back to the other guy) is telling me we need to have a serious talk
But I didn‚Äôt want this to happen <:GWpinkuSadOtato:393081466176667648>
So now I‚Äôm facing a point where we might never be able to be friends again and that she‚Äôll implode in sadness
And also said that smol girl has kinda bottled her feelings, even from her
Friend said that both reasons apply
I asked friend if all of her sadness was because of this or also because I asked her to be part of a ‚Äúdouble relationship‚Äù (calling it this way because it was just double for me, neither of the girls want to date the other, so isn‚Äôt polyamory)
So dating me would go against that purpose
I asked her best friend, who is also my friend, about it, she said that smol girl didn‚Äôt want to get too attached because it would be too painful to let go later (as she herself told me) but also that she was the kind of person that wants to find her true love and be with him forever
The smol girl (the temporary one) went through a lot of crying
But I don‚Äôt know how much of it is on me
I‚Äôm still trying to gather enough information
I think I might have done that, actually
do consider that, even though I'm trying my best, I have never been in a relationship before, I know I'm doing some wrongs but I can't fully recognize what they are and how to address them <:GWpinkuSadOtato:393081466176667648>
pls tell me
<:GWpinkuSadOtato:393081466176667648>
that one tryout not working really got to me
my polyamory condition is kinda eating me from inside out
all that adds up to a life of less than 0 physical interaction if cute girl decides to step back
even choir was hard to fit in because my sister (that joined choir before me) didn't want me to hang out with her friends, saying that I had to make my own
sisters that I barely talk to because they have their social circles and I won't fit in
parents that didn't want to play with me because they "had to work to make more money". Great, money is useless to me if I have no family
I had to make friends multiple times only to end up cutting ties due to communication problems, internet wasn't big at the time and I just talking through the phone wouldn't be enough
parents moved a lot, had to go with them across the country at least 4 times
I'm the same lonely little shit that couldn't gather enough courage to ask a girl out due to social anxiety, and has never been asked out by one either
I'm alone
but at the end of the day, after all the maths, after all the games
we have fun singing together
I'm part of a choir, it makes me happy, I can bond with people irl
my social is online, I have fun with games, can talk to my friends across the country
my professional life is on the way, learning to be a math teacher, almost 100% guaranteed work
I need someone to give the same things to, to make them feel loved and safe
I need someone to hug, to hold hands with, to sit together in the couch to watch movies eating popcorn, to play video games, board games, to talk to, to wake up next to me so I don‚Äôt feel alone in the morning
I‚Äôve grown*
I‚Äôve with parents working most of the time
I need someone for my personal happiness to be complete
I have used that thought of ‚Äúif I wait, it‚Äôll work‚Äù for my 21 years of life
But it hasn‚Äôt come back
I do that
How do I make myself interesting?
but all the extra stress might get to me
math and teaching (the point of the course) are easy for me to learn
the other 2 are fine too
algebra is like highschool, just practice the exercises and that's learned
I know how to calculate the stuffs, I just don't know what they mean
calculus 2 is easy
it's going good
the 3 distance learning are a mess, 2 because of the shitty system and handling by the teachers, the other one for a few different reasons
but only the ones that are attendance disciplines
the only thing I've been properly managing, and this managing quality might drop if this goes on, is classes
I'm getting too much stress
I'm just sad about all this
but I don't know, I'll just try it
she'll probably not agree on being with me if that's the case
it'll be better for her if I just say I will love more than one person at once
I need to tell her everything
we're not in high school
I won't force anything
nor that I want her to stay with me forever in polyamory
I'm not saying I will stay with this girl forever
nono
what exactly is a platonic relationship?
learned enough from my parents what means to be abusive
already being a polyamory, breaking the norm again won't be hard
if abusive relationships seems to be the norm, I'll be the exception again
I'm not everyone
I wouldn't let myself fall in an abusive relationship
but that's my point, you "need" that person, which makes you not divorce
the need for someone causing you to stay with them, even though it's abusive
isn't that the opposite?
what?
<@!102691114762371072> how does "I need someone" mentality cause divorces?
I forgot to ask
the only one I've met so far that will love a person even mid-transition is cute girl
furthermore, the transition itself will be a lonely part of the road
greeting hugs are fine, but after that? too lovey dovey for friends
friendships aren't cutting it because girls don't accept the long hugs and cuddles
but it's not doing good to me
I know
might be crazy to say, but I'm willing to build love and friendship with a girl at the same time
so that is going to take a while
I'm making some friendships on my current city, but since it's college everyone is too busy all the time
they are on the other side of the country
I have friends
and waiting won't bring me someone
I won't allow myself to be alone, otherwise it'll be a snowball
to want
I can't say this for sure, because I don't know that much, but what makes me not be depressive is this will
I can't just stand waiting
back to step 0
I currently don't have a girl to love
so, new update
he's very depressed
she needs to help her ex-boyfriend
she just sent me the messages
there it is
acceptable, maybe
but even if I do it, it won't come out great
it's a small assignment, can get it done quickly
I have an assignment due in 1 hour and 20 minutes and I'm getting anxious and stressed with other things
but, as of right now, I'm not doing college properly either
but if I do drown in games, I won't do college properly
games are my reality escape pod
sure, I can survive without relationships if I drown myself in the world of games
if one takes me as "too clingy", I'll have another to be with
I'll learn about different people
I'll learn to love in different ways
that's why I want to love more than one
and then I'll eat myself for ruining it with smol girl, because I could be with her right now if I hadn't tried to be polyamorous
why no brain?
thank you
you are very interesting to me overall, Alice
I'm interested
but that sounds a really sad way to find out
I need pets and hugs constantly too
why primary?
why a really bad one?
I just can't carry on with it anymore
I have done too much pretending in my life
I can't keep on pretending I'm not looking for love as a first
the way I am, they'll keep hurting
didn't work
did want it, just didn't take action
until like 18 yo, I didn't worry much about finding romance
"no" is pretty much the answer I've always got
What is an azunyan?
<@!127644949884698624> 10q for the story
I‚Äôll only see them on thursday, so I‚Äôll just do whatever assignments I have to do and drown in games until then
I‚Äôll try asking out a few choir girls
She gives me hugs
I do have one friend coming to visit on october
But I‚Äôm still trying
Most of the time my matches don‚Äôt even answer the first message
I do have dating apps
Wikipedia is the best starter, I usually go there first if there isn‚Äôt a school website on the first resulta
If I do talk it out with the person, that won‚Äôt be an issue
I just avoided one
Not something I can ignore
My 20 years of being alone tell me otherwise
I do, because it won‚Äôt happen if I don‚Äôt
Guess I‚Äôll have to find someone who‚Äôs willing to talk to learn each other as much as I am
That‚Äôs an avoided joyride for ya
I agree in not being sure if it‚Äôs abusive, but also definitely agree it‚Äôs not healthy
And she claims that‚Äôs not abusive, but necessary
So both keep checking the other‚Äôs phone
And now they agree on that
But that‚Äôs because she did that first to him
Her boyfriend doesn‚Äôt let her talk to certain people, now I‚Äôm included in such list, because he fears she‚Äôll betray him
After a lot of chaos, me and the girl talked, she told me how her current relationship works
I avoided an abusive relationship
So
pls no
"it must be like this because it has always been like this"
current teacher wave is very conservative
big gay
I'd say both, I'm in that position too
I‚Äôll consider that
I‚Äôm curious if he‚Äôll follow the plan and what he will do
He also mentioned going to choir practice to ‚Äúsay hi to me‚Äù
Butt, dude lashed out, seems a bit insecure for me
I‚Äôve always done it that way
I like to talk before I try something
A casual date was my plan
Both the pfp are Kiri :v
Thanks, Kiri-duo
I hope she does
Dude even told me to cut my hair and ‚Äúbecome a man‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äù
I was just like
Got called ugly (by audio message) and blocked
I couldn‚Äôt apologize
And lightly threatens you
What if their SO answers instead of them
Should I ask a girl if she has a boyfriend/girlfriend before asking her out? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
Question: what are such not nice things?
*fat*
Night is a billion times better, you can properly see things without this fat ass star burning your body
I never cheated either, and sometimes I remember I don‚Äôt know how to cheat, so I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to :v
Yesterday she literally ran up the stairs when she saw me arriving at practice
Only reason I was able to talk to her for 1 minute was because she had to unchain her bycicle
She‚Äôll stay far from me too
As fas as I can be while in the same choir
No, the only similarity is that the two girls are studying the same thing
Lightly threatening me and stuff
No, the girl with the dude who answered my message instead of her
We‚Äôre gonna be ‚Äúcool‚Äù
Girl doesn‚Äôt even care if dude was rude
Update
With kind words, of course
And they had to be told by my psychologist that it‚Äôs stupid decision making
Took them almost 22 years
My parents will stop dragging me around random places
**Finally**
it's loading for me
I'll just wait and see what happens starting next year <:GWossuKannaSip:395627468276367370>
And I really don‚Äôt want bad people teaching
Not for them not knowing, but because the course graduates teachers
People on math college being bad at math is making me angry
Surgery is always a thing
Don‚Äôt fret, tiny potato, you‚Äôll do it
a lot of languages do
precisely
but if you bend time, you're fucking up the entire timeline
when you bend space, you can bend a paper
you can't compare time with space
I don't know how big pubg is, but if there's team division (programming, designing, creating), that kind of argument is invalid
do they have a big dev team?
In the ‚Äúbetter prevent awkwardness as much as possible‚Äù case, just ask when you‚Äôre about to leave
Everyone has something up their sleeve
No one plays an empty hand
They didn‚Äôt talk to you because they assumed you would have if you were interested
<@!246146781832806401> that‚Äôs wrong, there are people thinking the same as you
That would never work, someone has to do it
Imagine a situation where both people are interested in each other, but both of them think ‚Äúif they are interested, they‚Äôll initiate‚Äù
Pretty much
Why not?
Or ‚Äúif this happened once, it can happen again‚Äù
Like ‚Äúthat was the worst case possible, so it can‚Äôt get worse‚Äù
There‚Äôs quite a few thought lines you can take
Bad of her, but that hurts a lot
Didn‚Äôt last a week because I was too honest
I have confessed a few times, only one of them worked
From my experience, that‚Äôs how it works
Give‚Äôem the old one two
U got dis
With hot dog
I had it last week :3
Sauerkraut is op
just because "we're your parents"
instead they scream asking for respect
no, I'm saying they should respect me
I don't think so
by my own family?
she was like "your cousing is already in college" and some shit
the bitching about being incompetent one
guess who asked her to do that
later my sister asked me if I had blocked her
I blocked her and didn't even apologize
my mother was still an annoying prick through messages
I spent 10 weeks working in the us, college program thingy
still in college
almost 22
and that's all he knows to do
I just need their money to pay college
I will tell them to fuck off any time I can
said parents have thaught me that lying is better
"Don't interrupt me and respect me because I'm your father", he said, while screaming
and I'm in the 1st
but well, I'm already better than most people at 7th semester of math college
I also try and use the rage as motivation to do better in classes sometimes
ranting here or somewhere else is the best way
but it becomes harder and harder everytime
I had to develop a meditation thingy to just mentally put it away
I did look, but there isn't a rage room near me
or in jail
otherwise, someone would end up in the hospital
I have 22 years of rage bottled up, I can't let it out
that's the reason why I'm still here
bitch, I should be the one crying
and he was crying
I still remember when I told them I was a transgender and the conversation ended with my father screaming "I'm not gonna spend a single cent on that idea"
I know they aren't capable of respect
no, they won't get better
divorces happen all around because people can't agree
people don't live that because they're bad
they still try to hold their superior "parents" ground
we sat down to talk things out with a psychologist
brazil is shit
moving out isn't a viable option in brazil
and I'm just ranting here, I know I won't find an answer
not gonna miss them
I 120% mean it when I say they can jump off the bridge
and I'm treated like shit because they wanted a perfect child
that's the problem, they always taught me about being a decent human being, respecting people and all
if that's average, they can fucking jump off the bridge
my parents always told me I shouldn't settle for being average
what the fuck kind of parenting is that?
and now that I'm talking back she cries about it
recently I my mother told me that she had always wanted me to talk back
because I knew that talking back would be worse
I was a child that never talked back
Noice
not the best places to
chess, math, choir
tbh none of my activities allow me to release rage
so it's not all bad
my mental condition also contributes to making me bottle things up
I do talk to the psychologist too, weekly
my sister doesn't mind if I don't go
but I don't like formal things
said sister is currently the only person at home which I consider talking to in the future
I don't dislike my sister, but I am busy
I didn‚Äôt even go to my own high school graduation
Because ‚Äúit‚Äôs an important date for her‚Äù
Now my mother wants to force me to go to my sister‚Äôs middle school graduation
Op
Bryce too?
https://youtu.be/CfG_qg8KN_E
David is noice
I'm more than ready to unleash almost 22 years of pure rage
these vacations will be me or them
it's there
‚Äú(But) someone might still be trans, but may not fit a particular DNA pattern. No medical or genetical (sic) test is perfect. And so everyone's experience is still valid.‚Äù
don't worry
https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australian-scientists-find-possible-genetic-link-to-gender-dysphoria?fbclid=IwAR0riWbuoTXYxHxNFBQeXf-t_LpXld3ImKyd0bsVM1sO5nK9IQYr69NzTyw
or maybe someone who was taught that with wrong context
the one thing schools should do is teach people to be decent, yet they don't
but also especially easy to be taught the opposite
children are especially easy to teach this
historical salt <:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>
but such good hand may hold malicious intents
they will embrace whatever is taught on good hand
young people are knowledgeless people
of course there is a scale of things that "things should be kept the same way" and "things shouldn't be kept the same way"
yes, but today that's history
"can't be gay because god said so"
which is why religion is usually the opposition
most of these values are also based on old as shit arguments
which goes side to side with monogamy
bi people get hated on with the argument that "they will eventually choose a side"
and they'll do anything to protect these values
people never get hurt, only their values
that's just it
namely, the terfs
lgbt has these radical feminists that hate on other lgbt
every group has its sub-groups
what's so wrong about quoting people with screenshots?
I'm just gonna ask and go to sleep, will read everything later, but
Wot
Problem with playing defensively is that you‚Äôre at your opponent‚Äôs mercy
Defensively
And dodgeball, a ball
Chess is just a matter of having the pieces
Ye, that‚Äôs one thing
I‚Äôve never done snowboarding, wish I did
The only sports I can truly enjoy are chess and dodgeball
I couldn‚Äôt be more bored than with soccer and carnaval
I could enjoy another culture that isn't brazilian
no, it was a bad pun with import :v
that's very important of you
What to do when you just had a sad meal?
You must have had it but, that wasn‚Äôt a pattern in my experience
how so?
sad high five
I got 0 understanding from my mother, checks out
because almost every parent is busy working 100% of the time
usually just plays the role of daycare to any child, really
or at least it's meant to be
school is the birth of knowledge
it's just a plain bad recipe
logic is not in the ingredients list for those things
because we are different and they can't understand us, since they aren't
the people who have "right minds"
can you opt out?
even worse
is it for asperger only or other types?
not how asperger works
how do those work?
there are special classes for aspergers?
It‚Äôs a command, it has to be
Well, the whole phrase
Oh, no, it‚Äôs tied to bed
What happens normally?
I think
The c form is archaic
Family was supposed to be nice
The only good family left is younger sister, who is heavily influenced by parents, and my cousin, who shares the same feelings as me, and I know we‚Äôll always get along
Didn‚Äôt have parents, now lost my sister
But now she tells my mom everything I do
We could do things parents forbid and be secretive about it, being proper siblings
And my sister was the friend
I was bad at communicating because of asperger
Parents never bothered understanding me
And even though all you guys read is my anger, I‚Äôm very sad
But I fucking will if this keeps going
The only reason she doesn‚Äôt start fights is because she knows she‚Äôll lose
Bitch almost starts a fight when I eat food that I didn‚Äôt know it was hers and now this
And she was all bitchy ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see a name on it‚Äù
So I just joked about it, ‚Äúyou used my sticks‚Äù
I was ok, because I had dinner after her
And she used today to eat dinner
I got this bowl and hashi from my godfather when I was twelve
Not even my sister treats me like a person anymore
That would need to go both ways
I don‚Äôt like calling them parents
Just a matter of preference
There are targets in the way
Reflects reality
They are digging their own grave
Me being in the computer
Guess what my parents hate
Because I can feel happy when doing stuff in the computer
What keeps me from doing it is the computer
And it‚Äôs not gonna be pretty
Some day I‚Äôm just gonna blow up
It‚Äôs just stupid
But she wanted me to fight back like a ‚Äúnormal teenager‚Äù and kept fighting me
Mother literally didn‚Äôt understand me fighting back
It‚Äôs like my parents
It‚Äôs highly illogical
But they just settle
The majority is not fine
And keep voting on shit people
People just keep complaining over and over again
Everyone knows it but no one ever does anything
The system here is so bad
Starting at home all the way to politicians
But like hardcore rampage
Is this normal
Honestly, some times I feel like rampaging a lot of people
I‚Äôve seen several negative posts from my grandmother and uncle (son of said grandmother)
The larger family will soon be a problem
It‚Äôs happy to see couples
Seeing you guys interact does lighten the mood a bit
So it was just cold and sad :c
Family has this police of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat today‚Äôs lunch leftovers, they are going to be tomorrow‚Äôs lunch‚Äù
I wanted to eat something hot, but I couldn‚Äôt
It‚Äôs sad because there was no cooking, I ate something cold (cereal)
I‚Äôll just dive into Dairy of a Wimpy Kid to share the sadness
And my parents hate those 3 and constantly try to get me away from them
Things that keep me happy are internet, games and hentai
Didn‚Äôt try to ditch them by staying in the usa, when I went to work there, because I followed the rules too well
I can‚Äôt even leave them because the economy is shit
Because not even proper diagnosis for being asperger made them understand
But now I can only cry or rage about it
Sometimes I wish so much that what I had said was truth‚Äù
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs ok, they are my family‚Äù
Since I was 8, I saw wrong things
But it was more and more of a disappointment
It could have been nice
But I lost that
I was always taught that family was the one group you could trust
Because friend is now extra mad
It‚Äôs actually pretty <:GWqlabsMonkaSs:393085114403389442>
If you guys don‚Äôt know why you broke up, that‚Äôs a problem
you definitely have to talk with her about it
Did you talk about it?
üçø
Are you moving just to another house or moving out of your city/state?
Moving does suck
Best of luck <:GWowoKannaBear:358701785617268738>
Ask about everything you aren‚Äôt sure of
Never assume things either
You need this information, do not proceed without it
-talk about break up, was that actually what you guys wanted?
-find out if you guys should get back together
-find out why friend is extra mad
Make a check list
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when he knew, he fucked up‚Äù
And Lectric has no idea why
The world is upside down
Tbh the old people behave like fucking children
Talk about maturity
This grandmother is still young compared to the other, can‚Äôt wait for that
Good
Imagine how nice it will be when I tell her I‚Äôm a transexual lesbian
My grandmother doesn‚Äôt support gay marriage either
Grandmother too? That‚Äôs a bingo
I feel you
That‚Äôs good
It‚Äôs full of shit
Not even the religious people read the bible
If god is what people say, hell yeah I‚Äôm rooting for Lucifer
Shouldn‚Äôt it be good to look at holy people?
Palms sweaty
But why
Punishing someone for wanting to be more
Such a good god
What happened to him?
What is he again?
I forgot to comment on the satan part
If it exists, zeus has fucked it
Rule 34 of zeus
Both look very similar
Spider-man‚Äôs uncle
Yes you have
<:GWossuKannaSip:395627468276367370>
There are different versions?
Inmate?
Is Satan actually the one who punishes bad people or is that also misinterpreted?
what is that?
what thing
probably safer in this chat, my friends think this is related with youtube demonetizing because of comments
https://youtu.be/O13G5A5w5P0
and you're fucked
and if you fail one single time, it'll fall below that bar
than instead of congratulating you, they just up the bar
then you do more than needed
parents set a bar they want
let me put effort into something that everyone knows to be completely useless once you get to college
let me put effort so you can fucking ignore it and just say that not failing classes is nothing more than just obligation
oh sure, let me put effort into the shitty school system
"go outside to play with no one because they are at home"
my cs teachers were always like "you either make it super clean or you just describe the code at the end"
that's hurtful
<:GWactionSmolConcern:407619081894887454>
Saki too op
please, join us
no at all
and forget about all the economical crisis, impending 3rd world war and the planet being sucked out of life to provide, that's fairy tail
because they lived in a time where shit was simpler, so it must be too easy to do all that now
because your parents said so
why?
but you're supposed to spend your entire day at school and have fun
there is no "fun" in school
no no no
extra credit: have a perfect mental, physical and psychological health
I don't know where you are going to find enough hours in the day to do all that, but parents don't fucking care
also, have a job
and also remember that you're supposed to get perfect grades, have a social life, play a sport, go to the gym, take extra courses, learn a third language and have a good sleep schedule
remember kids, it's not ever the teachers' fault, get fucking good
and my parents blame it on me for not getting good grades
which happened to me
that is if your teachers don't fuck up the grades system
only a person who studies 24 hours a day can do that
but tell me who the fuck goes straight As through college
and my parents say I should work hard to get only 100%
I'm good at math, and got into math college
it became doom for me
and who knows how many more he has done
she told me two things prior to this
this fucker has a bad history
and I could almost feel her tears coming out
and she was almost running, directly to the bathroom
I didn't see them talking, I just caught a movement with the corner of my eye
in her own party
made her cry
this literal piece of shit
and this motherfucking asshole
and lo and behold, I saw, for the first time, the guy she is dating for about 3 months
being the girl I love, of course I accepted
and it's this girl's birthday, she invited me
(yay for leaving the house to do something other than classes)
I went to this karaoke bar today
boy am I about to break a fucking nose
despite my numerous attempts, I never cut myself with paper
that's right
as someone who never had a papercut, I am curious to how one feels
Why would she hate you over this?
if there is a person who I hate more than my parents, it's this guy
I‚Äôll celebrate when my parents die
that can get out of hand real fast
>no matter how horrible they are
it's a "can't win" situation
I've found that to be the best solution so far
can you avoid having conversations with her?
what is an au pair?
But me not going meant I wasn‚Äôt a good enough of a friend
She said she was counting on the 10 select people (her bestest friends) and that I was included
I told her before the party that I wouldn‚Äôt be ok going
Which is exactly what happened in said party
I usually end up just being on the phone
Mental health being I don‚Äôt do well in parties
It‚Äôs a new friendship that started off great
Should one sacrifice mental health to go to a friend‚Äôs birthday party for the sake of friendship?
The brake works less in neutral
She‚Äôs the literal definition of ‚Äúif no one‚Äôs looking I won‚Äôt follow laws to my desire‚Äù
Yes
Just because ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way one could tell I‚Äôm doing that‚Äù
She also breaks another law that says you can‚Äôt drive with no gear set (translation pending, don‚Äôt know the actual terms)
My sister has claimed she is conscious of what she is doing so she drives over the speed limit ‚Äúwithout being a threat to anyone‚Äù
What a time to be alive
What is a take over on the blind bend?
You‚Äôre to drive anywhere between 50-100% of the speed limit
As far as brazil‚Äôs laws cover, that‚Äôs legal
How hard is it to avoid a slow driver if you‚Äôre going at a decent speed?
People driving over the speed limit are a danger to other people
It‚Äôs the limit, not the only speed allowed
It‚Äôs safe driving
Everyone doing wrong doesn‚Äôt make it right
You‚Äôre legally allowed to drive below he limit
Because it‚Äôs the limit
Why
Wot
New motto
‚ÄúPeople may honk at you, but the police surely won‚Äôt‚Äù
In a road full of cowards, everyone makes it out alive
That‚Äôs an ‚Äúabandon ship‚Äù situation
Holy shit
Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the same across countries ü§î
<@200030864497704960> I believe it‚Äôs 10% over the speed limit
If the police set camp there, they would be bloody rich
People constantly drive at 80 there
There‚Äôs an uphill followed by downhill in my city, with speed limit of 60 kph
So that‚Äôs our example
Our father drives at 150 kph on 100 kph speed limit roads
But seems like I was the only one to actually learn driving
I was the last one in this house to go to driving school (save for my 15 yo sister, eventually it‚Äôll be her)
Car achieves greater speeds and that makes it harder to brake
But so is something below it
I literally cannot understand why driving at a speed that surely won‚Äôt kill you is being an idiot
And those who aren‚Äôt, aka drive slower, are blamed because they aren‚Äôt doing what everyone is doing?
So everyone‚Äôs an idiot
So while there is no minimum speed limit you can call anyone who isn‚Äôt driving at the maximum limit an idiot?
What?
‚ÄúAbout to crash on a car, better not slow down‚Äù
You don‚Äôt need a reason to go slow
Don‚Äôt blame who isn‚Äôt doing anything wrong
That‚Äôs the reckless person‚Äôs fault
Why?
Can you go at 50% of speed limit?
What is the law there?
No, he said going 30 on a 60
You‚Äôre calling people who drive slow ‚Äúidiots‚Äù
That‚Äôs literally what you are saying
Are you literally telling me that people who break the law driving over the speed limit are less of a danger than those who don‚Äôt?
üéâ
Being impatient is a hazard
‚ÄúOver takes without properly looking‚Äù there‚Äôs the reason
Can you not prepare for in in this one mile?
You can see someone in a freeway like a mile ahead
it's really easy to differ someone refering to a word and someone throwing the word at another person
it's literally an act for the sake of children
censoring a single letter doesn't censor at all since everyone reading it knows exactly what letter goes there, so your brain will be reading the word at full whether you want it or not
self censoring is childish because it's used to avoid showing it to someone who doesn't know what it is, aka children who don't know swear words (beeps in videos, full censoring of words like **** or black square)
what's josou?
that's where you could draw a line differentiating trap and crossdresser
would you like an explanation?
then you have been enlightened
it was prior to your first message, so you should have seen it
<@103920342916952064> I hope this all has enlightened you about trap not being just a male that looks like a female
what happens if your grandmother can't take it?
calling the police could be a thing
does he live with you?
you got what?
then call the actual police from the city
family is supposed to be more than blood, but it isn't
I support that party

have you heard of

*oh jolly, it's just like a game*
what we should strive for is making the classes more balanced
execution time
but I don't particularly agree
"money doesn't buy you happiness, but it's better to cry in a mercedes than to cry in a bicycle"
there's the original version of that
money doesn't buy you happiness, but it's better to cry in a comfy bed
Minimum wage doesn‚Äôt take that into account yet
young people can be very deceived
<:GWqlabsDuck:398950896416849950>
problem being that it is very broken

that's scaringly similar to brazil
I wish it was actually on fire to kill some people

I was never violent, my parents taught me to be violent by being violent
those exist?
knife them
Think of the children :v
The imperial system was literally someone going ‚Äúsee my body part right here? It‚Äôs a measurement unit now‚Äù
But not meaning that you hope Kerrik doesn‚Äôt get the job, just that it is a smooth process
So saying ‚Äúbreak a leg‚Äù would be ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt have to worry about it‚Äù
What I learned was that someone originally said ‚Äúbreak a leg‚Äù to another someone who was about to take part in a theater play, and breaking a leg would mean this person wouldn‚Äôt have to play their part, meaning they wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it
You have to make sure all 4 people are okay with that
You 2 have boyfriends but you‚Äôll date? ü§î
<@209036464900538371> we‚Äôre together in the lonely boat
no you don't
you should definitely contact the authorities
when it's something about people being different, they'll hate it even more
people already cry about not knowing differences like your and you're
that's the break up reason, but doesn't look like there has been an official breaking up
there isn't something to believe, it's not religion
a lot of things can be used for escapism
God sent the raw file and humans are editing it
Cheesus is coming Soon‚Ñ¢, don‚Äôt be gay, kids

Which is probably why I haven‚Äôt succeeded in dating someone, I talk a lot about it and the other person just doesn‚Äôt want it after hearing it
Things need to be talked
Not even a monogamous relationship is just ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs try it‚Äù
That‚Äôs why talking a lot about it is required
But it‚Äôs a point, maybe they don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs an option
How do you get ready?
Ask if she‚Äôd want to date both of you :d

I won't say to not be scared, but just know that it's normal
but don't worry too much about it
your mind actually is stronger than you can imagine
Your mind knows anger and Melua and Saki. Even if those aren‚Äôt tied together in reality, your mind will do it
It‚Äôs not weird, dreams are just a mix of everything in your mind
Try not to yell at people

that's exactly what we think
have people been trying to sell your information?
If you wanted an answer to why not use volume of buildings instead of area, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not practical
If you‚Äôre talking about people living in space, you should think about practicality
I said shouldn‚Äôt, not can‚Äôt
Discussing possibility shouldn‚Äôt be your focus
Everywhere?
Now do that above the streets
We can use 100% of the area, but not 100% of the volume
When you have 2 buildings close to each other, you can‚Äôt build a third in between then
It means you probably won‚Äôt use it
But not in the volume
But take any random point in the area, and you can sleep there
That‚Äôs within the specific parts of the volume you can use
Only specific parts of the volume are used, which is why you don‚Äôt use volume for that
You can use any space within the area, but you can‚Äôt use any space within the volume
Not that easy
Rady, do you have the numbers?
Please tell us the parameters again
Please tell us the parameters again
Don‚Äôt feel like that, because we‚Äôre not
How is that overthinking?
Then why did you say ‚Äúpracticality be damned‚Äù?
So we take that height for the entire city?
Where does the height of a city end?
Catnip <:GWimmoThreeC:396057766793576458>
Radyjko, do you have the area, height and population numbers of that megacity?
here's to hoping people aren't as shallow
*originality*
ye, God is the christian god
so they don't feel guilty about it
it's not that they choose, it's that they say god "chose" and it's in the bible
theism
what is "yellow star"/"pink triangle"?
yo, that's rad bro
radical anything is usually bad
it is
trans exclusionary radical feminists
O
Don‚Äôt both words exist in other languages as well?
Kek
That‚Äôs why the scientific definition is there, to decide what is the correct use
So the group that uses it correctly can teach the other
Which is why the scientific definition is there
That‚Äôs a dangerous thought process
o, I don't think we're there yet, at least I haven't seen anything about it
maybe it's some anomaly in the science that causes a disconnection between birth gender and identity
yes :v
brain could answer the question of "what gender am I?" with "no"
not necessarily
but some people are born and the brain goes "this is not optimal" and identifies as something else
well, thinking of the common, brains should agree we body
o, that is an excellent question
what do you mean with model? ü§î
May you survive through the fire and the flames
what's up

well, that kills my hopes
happens irl too?
at you least you saw the person prior to leaving by car
probably more quotation marks needed
you can "be" in a relationship with someone you never meet
you can let it go or report to discord
if one of them blocked you, it's not worth your time
do emphasize the "completely unacceptable" part
from the discord guidelines
it is to be done asap
"they seem to be deleting" is not good enough
what is their take on it?
yes, that can absolutely get them banned
couldn't you answer "both"? ü§î
abandon all rules, ask "are to gay?" and roll with it :v
but it really depends on who you're asking and their current mood
"are you into guys or girls" is probably the best
varies from person to person
point in case
probably a severe lack of communication
oh, then they weren't on the same page at all <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
just to make sure, what does "pop the question" mean?
nothing wrong with stopping after 3 years
seems like they were on the same page
It‚Äôs a very unorthodox request to make

Big head, definitely a child

If it shouldn‚Äôt happen, then porn of it is a no no for me
Well, if it‚Äôs rare, it‚Äôs because it shouldn‚Äôt happen
Question, is it normal for an adult human (real life) to look like a child?
Because the public will take it as lolicon porn
And if an artist draws a 30 yo with the body of a child with the genuine intent of being an adult, that artist is in the wrong for releasing it to the public
So if an artist draws a 30 yo with the body of a child lusting after the body, dead wrong
On the theme of things being real or not: characters aren‚Äôt real, what is real is the lust of the artist
They want white characters to be played by white people first and foremost
Because people don‚Äôt want a good actor first and foremost

what is social housing?
this time it was my star wars flip flop
once again, my mother donated one of my things
Pro tip: don‚Äôt ever throw away/donate your child‚Äôs belongings without their permission first
In my case, I‚Äôll start properly teaching after 2 years of college, from a total of 4
But a good job where you know exactly what are you doing will require study
There are jobs where you don‚Äôt need college at all
In your resume, you put relevant experiences for the job
To prevent exactly that
Tbh, you don‚Äôt need to put asperger on your resume
You‚Äôll also think about that a lot more, but don‚Äôt hurry on getting a job
You‚Äôll get better at dealing with people
but I guess that idea is thrown out of the window
supposedly, I have ownership of my things
I'm 22
how will they track who is a child?
if youtube wasn't a shit with ad things, this would be easier

I don't think there is more to it than just chauvinism (is this the word?)
but all the jokes are about making fun of women
it's the thought of saying that something "is just a joke" would give it a pass to be ok
but on his view it's "jokes hurt"
like gen z, millenials
which was "generation 'jokes hurt'"
it didn't matter how I approached it, the first thing he said would be the same regardless
what be this
But they don‚Äôt english, so won‚Äôt affect them
Tbh I could only remember this
Nah, this could escalate into reportable content
From my uncle‚Äôs part
But honestly, violence would have if it was in person
In which there are only males since grandmother left, except my 13 yo cousin who doesn‚Äôt even speak there
Bottles aren‚Äôt flying because this was on the whatsapp family group
Boy I‚Äôll tell you who‚Äôs lacking respect
They are both homophobes, have agreed on gay marriage not being actual marriage on a facebook post
Now he‚Äôs mad af
Uncle said I lacked respect towards the person who changed my diapers
Said that a comment my grandmother made showed how disgusting a person is
Yesterday I called out my grandmother and uncle on them repeatedly posting hateful jokes about women
she's 70 already
ye, the only place grandma is going anytime soon is the grave
nah, I just cut story, you're good
the reasons came before it
but digitally and leaving the group
it was exactly like a child saying "I'm not terrible" and stomping their way to their room
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
it got her out of the message group
I've carefully observed the family for 22 years
it's not assumption
depends on who's using it
oh ye, attached question, how is peepo in the scale?
is pepe bad like "should be avoided if possible" or bad like swastika?
ok, this following question is meant for me to acknowledge the people's view on the matter, because I'm not good at social cues
moderation in 4chan, that's a funny sentence
it's literally an attempt at counter-measure made by humans for other humans that are less
rules only exist because people do bad shit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVZsbE4E68w
you can learn how to do good instead of bad, what to avoid and what not to avoid, all that good stuff
you can't cease to exist and dying is not an option
also, self harm by telling people they would be better of without you will not help at all
accept that you've done things and learn from them to become a better person
don't dwell on things negatively, that's regret eating you from the inside
there are more realistic alternatives :v
you don't need to go to the moon for that
it teaches you to measure actions on a greater scale
knowledge helps you know if you are actually guilty or not
because that's not what it's supposed to do
knowledge is power
you gain knowledge
Just find that someone, ez
You can do that while being with someone tho
Good thinking
Oh
6ft under?
There‚Äôs the loss

Loss loss situation
Full time job would mean no education or not taking care of the baby

Double rip

but noice knowing you mostly can in the us
you can't have a taser in brazil, only that thing that shocks that I don't know the name
I don't wanna do that e.e
ye
can one own a taser? ü§î
do get out of there
o-o
what's up with it?
Not while we‚Äôre alive, at least
I actually think self driving cars won‚Äôt be a thing
If someone jay walks, that‚Äôs their own fault
Ye, are they programming cars to make that situation?
Where‚Äôs the reset button
What a dumpster fire of a world we live in
It‚Äôs a suggestion
Basically the chaotic approach to the problem
Just read on that
That ‚Äòtheoretically‚Äô is the problem
I want actual people on the streets arresting people for not following stupidly simple laws
That ‚Äòsupposedly‚Äô is the problem
In that time, the people could be educated to drive well
That‚Äôs also another problem, when will they be globally available at a reasonable price?
So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs happening in 10 years
But that means a lot of time
It‚Äôs rigorous tests I‚Äôm counting on
But if that were the case, driving laws would be hella enforced
What I‚Äôm saying is that people should care about human life a lot more
Because people don‚Äôt even care about obeying driving laws
I don‚Äôt think it will happen like I say
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying
But I‚Äôm voicing how it should be
I‚Äôm not overestimating
It‚Äôs a whole different matter now
Because it wasn‚Äôt self driven
Realistically speaking, the situations considered for these are near impossible
You can‚Äôt create a self driving car and say ‚Äúyeah, at least one person will die‚Äù
But that‚Äôs how you have to think
One death is too many already
Is it mandatory to vote?
What the fuck
A threat is basically empty if everyone knows you won‚Äôt do it
Does it serve any purpose?
Nuclear won‚Äôt happen, it‚Äôs a suicide move
Cry
Why?
Well, here is a meme that explains why I don‚Äôt watch documentaries on shit
Oh, shit, I forgot Kirichan responds to that
I don‚Äôt think anything should happen ü§î
Oh, phone
You got antivirus?

Then why say it again and again? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>

To radically change a system, a lot of people need to cease to exist
What is a level 4 or 5 civilization?
Well yea, give an infinite amount if time, all possibilities exist
Aka tending to infinity
Isn‚Äôt it finite, but constantly expanding?
Any specific discord server?
Mine is mostly facebook ü§î
Where in the internet are you seeing so many ww3 memes?
Smarts‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
this is the very right channel to vent
both, really :v
how old are they?
it probably won't last long
let them live their lie
in case things go south, be ready to get a restraining order
if talk works, it will be your prime time to experiment on the balance
you also shouldn't just do things based on schedules
you can't predict urges
you have to give it time
why?
not talking to them about it will save you from some stress
they think their system is flawless and you should follow it religiously while under their roof
yes, they will think you make things up, aka they won't listen to you at all
noice, dunkek
<@!238855496797257729> nah, welcome to the team
contagious naivity
could probably call child protective services or something
how old is she?
oh, mental hospitals allow phones?
how are you guys communicating?
you might want to call a different police station
or mental hospital?
hospitalized for her bruises?
just in case you want to prevent anything :v
you could use majesty
How fast were you going? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
oh noes death is coming on cold
There‚Äôs plenty of good people that want to be parents in the world to keep the human race going
Pretty much
People **really** underestimate the difficulty of raising children
The amount of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a poor single mother and you have no idea how hard it is‚Äù or something along the lines is off the charts
<@238855496797257729> you can pay a visit to r/choosingbeggars and feel right at home
the link in the tweet doesn't work for me <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
So your family is gud
I don‚Äôt know about eastern
Western culture bends more towards ‚Äúfathers work while the mother raises he kid‚Äù
what personal reason do you think that?
so I tend more into "just build a 3rd bathroom" than "just make bathrooms genderless"
I don't actually get why gendered bathrooms are still a strong thing besides "women have a private place where (usually) there are no freaky males in"
nice story, but that doesn't add or subtract on #2 tho
but unisex/3rd bathroom when
thread very carefully
D:
I can't access any of these starting with apps.
will what? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
that's pretty gud
what does that mean?
You‚Äôre more than right
They‚Äôre technically the same thing
yay for 3rd bathroom
pc?
ear for pitch?
the risk vastly outweigh the benefits? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
is this still in the category of "boomers are dying so they're fucking shit up"?
what happens now?
you have music theory in school? :o
but what is an ear for pitch?
he still composed when deaf, didn't he?
isn't texas the designated pvp zone?
that made me laugh, thank you
someone's gotta do it, man
they are probably addicted to discord
send them to rehab
sounds like a hardcore parent to me
are you sure they are not a parent?
but really, what were the arguments?
everyone hide
a parent on discord? o-o
let me guess, parents
oh
is that like comparing?
conflating?
noice <:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
gud
do you need it?
it's not about me wanting, it's about you needing it :v
want the break down? :v
I can break it down if you want to be sure
yes
Competitive coin flipping \ovo/
I remember learning it when I was 13 and immediately understanding how bad it is
The stupidest voting system
yes, it's diminishing your work output

Is it his server? ü§î
Pedophilia means sexual feelings, so no
letting them down because you quit drinking? <:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
just practice
not a very good way to do
it's easy, just open a profile and use any pronouns there
what makes you say that?
why?
Or you‚Äôll have to study to know how to fix by yourself, and that will take a while
That‚Äôs a barrier you‚Äôll have to cross
Also, they don‚Äôt care about what you have in your computer, they don‚Äôt scavenge for stuff
That makes it easier, tell the techs that and they‚Äôll look specifically at it first
Because you need to get the computer fixed
That way you can process it better
Would be good to find out why
Why not?
Did you take it to fix yet?
<:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
self reflect with care
I'll just recommend you to not make decisions out of the blue
if you put good logic to use, it's okay
we may not be the best people to make decisions alone, and self reflecting might lead to pointless overthinking
at least on the self reflecting part
would I be able to convince you otherwise?
how long of a break?
do they act like they don't want you there?
have they actively pushed you away?
It‚Äôs not that you rely on the pc, it‚Äôs just that the pc makes it easier for us to go about fun

what's this
what exactly does a pro-gun person vouch for?
not everyone needs parenting classes
not parenting licenses, but heavily advised parenting classes
Who‚Äôs her
best thing I know so far is this
hmu if you find an answer
how will that goal be achieved?
that goal is what I would call purpose
what is his purpose?
Just leave those places for good
Don‚Äôt go there, lectric
But since it doesn‚Äôt exist, it fails quickly
Feels like there‚Äôs an unspoken agreement they have to follow
Tons of couples just agree on dating but never talking about the relationship‚Äôs terms
so I don't partake on it, rather dread it
the ideal romance just doesn't exist
even a step down, asking someone to be your boyfriend/girlfriend is a bit off for me
I used to be that kid that liked the idea of marriage, but it died
and they broke up even before the baby was born
one choir colleague even had a baby
I never actually witnessed someone proposing, but the people I know have proposed here and there
it has killed the emotions of a marriage/proposal, in my view
it's too common
it's not just "sometimes"
and so quickly sometimes
but it's far too common for people to divorce
yes, there are people who will honor it without a problem
I am very much on board with marriage as taking the responsibilities of raising kids
which we all know that it isn't, life isn't magical like that
like "marriage is love for life" as commented
it does break a lot of set-in-stone things
makes things clear
so making marriage more about raising kids then anything else, ye I'm on board
and the conclusion I reached is "just to divorce later"
I'm usually on the side of "why the fuck do people even marry besides money reasons"
if it changes internet that badly, the ones who voted for it will be eaten alive
I vote for worrying about it if it actually happens
what is that?
very suspicious
and they haven't taken you to test again
so they'll talk to a vpn and vpn will tell them no
not to be worried about it yet
but don't put your thoughts onto that
then they will, eventually
nice
are millenials the ones buying tons of toilet paper?
it doesn't add to the convo
please refrain from using ^
holy shit, that's so brazil
what?
they absolutely do this on purpose
hypocrisy and stupidity is engraved in them
this is their normal behavior
I refuse to believe a person is this stupid
there has to be some brain damage hidden in their histories
both of them said the two things
it is
and a fucking single minute later start complaining that I "need to ration food"
"this isn't a panic situation, you can keep eating the normal amount of food you eat"
my parents are fucking idiots
300iq, just take what defeats you and make it illegaal
a random teenager downloading a game/song isn't a threat on the face of a major drug dealer
and if they did arrest all of them, they would start with the most dangerous ones, most likely
how many people would they have to arrest?
that's why guillotine comes on play
guillotine!
and nothing but thinking of how much longer I'll have to keep doing it
probably the only reason I'm not having a breakdown is the ability to detach from real life, only like autism allows
but it made me realize that I'm still fucking lonely at 23 years
and it's really calming and comforting
literally the asmrtist hugging the microphone to record their heartbeats
and it's heartbeats
I have realized what kind of asmr I've been looking for
I think I have to thank my autism
everyone would lobby against
yes I highly recommend that
and I love it
karma is feeding me ammo
oh boy **oh joy**
and my mother comments "like anyone has anything to do with that time in the current situation"
he said a lady was complaining in a store trying to get compensation for her lost time trying to fix something that could have been done in 10 minutes
this also crosses with something my father told us at lunch
oh boy oh joy
and she is profusely mad about it
and here we are, in the middle of a quarantine, where *no one in our home has anything to do except classes*
mind you, whenever the teachers send something, we get an e-mail from the system saying there is something to see
but because she "was done with her college activities by that time", she couldn't have known
she said the class was originally at 9am, but the teacher sent a message at 18:45 of the previous day saying it changed to 8am
class was at 8am and she showed up at 8:50
today at lunch (just now) she said that she was late to her online class
for not studying, doing school work, missing classes and whatever else
my mother has always been of the opinion that "students have no excuses, they only need to study after all"
may the hypocrisy eat her alive
I'd like to thank the pandemic for providing my mother with the gloriousness of online classes
well, inducing panic is a crime
stopped as in quarantined
followed by "brazil stopped because of 6 counties"
just saw my uncle reposted something saying that only 6 counties in brazil have confirmed corona virus cases
basically invalidating them
it's an argument for themselves. Trying to cope with the fact that trans people exist, they try to convince themselves that, actually, there are no trans people
like "being depressed is just a trend"
it's a bad argument because it's thoughtlessly overused
it isn't wrong to pick opinions from other people, you just need to not blindly pick them
why don't you want opinions?
I myself am able to put the overthinking to good use by analyzing opinions
if you read multiple stuffs, you will know about multiple opinions and their reasons
not exactly
we're filling the bingo bois
ok, 4/12 so far
and that different is not sexist
it just is different
US voting system is busted because it‚Äôs based on states, not individual votes
you telling yourself you can't do things is also bad and also sets bad expectations
it can be about putting two things together
creative is not only about making your own
or C and E?
what if you mesh B and E?
then a teacher tells you about E
if you make D out of B and C, you have made your point D
what if you were to mesh them together to make a D?
for example, you know B and C
sometimes, trying new things requires knowing other things already done
or make your own point B
then you need to work on not giving up
do you know point B?
how do you know that's not right for you?
I've seen people in music college who can't even count 4 beats properly
you can get into music later or start some basics now
maybe not yet
some of us just aren't cut for creativity
parents in general tend to do that
sounds safer than getting an account stolen
is skype not better than that?
that doesn't sound much like moving on
yet
yes, let's head to gaming
gimme
what are these?
<:GWchadThinkeyes:366999794117246976>
ye
<@!302063351767498752> if you're abouot music, try crypt of the necrodancer
and after hitting that limit he'll want to play more and it'll go down his brain
setting a limit in lectric's language means scheduling
Scheduling games will attack his brain again
Scheduling should be done for his chores
I remember where that idea took you last time
how long of a very long time?
I don't know about talking to people destroying dopamine receptors, but indeed it wasn't the best idea
well, good thing you got over it
> I used to have a lowkey block against dating a trans woman
<@!472513526393602059> I meant this being a specific woman or in general
I'm back
a specific trans woman?
even if it looks like, looks can be deceiving
nothing will be an obvious and straightforward solution
you just need to gather some good arguments on things that might work
remember to not make instant drastic decisions
Kerrik just used The Gold Pocket Watch
a lot of other things
which is why our online classes usually suck
my university is all about group projects
remember to teach him without lashing out on him
while Lectric is wrong by openly saying that rl friendships are objectively better, he's not wrong by saying rl friends are better for him
just don't overfeed yourself with things
for us, listening to the same thing over and over confuses us sometimes
Death penalty for what?
Remember all those times people said to not treat teens like children?
‚Äúmaking sure that the under 18s are protected from decisions that they could make‚Äù
try cutting her off too
proper employers go after qualities, not traits
and yet again, you won't go around saying "I'm autistic" in your resume
it does
and anyone that "learns" through memes is not worth it either
if anyone refuses you purely on the basis that you're autistic, the job is not worth it
why?
it'll bite them in the future
let them think that
I've seen we think alike in a lot of situations, so I can shine some light on you
I can have an extensive debate with you about morals, if you want
you have time
and a lot of it
finding a partner requires decision making
but that's why teenagehood exists, to train decision making
yes, problems do come from making decisions
<@!302063351767498752> let's hop here
your father is crossing that limit when he tells you that
yes, chores do help you develop responsibility and other stuff, but there is a limit
Kerrik has the point, your father is distorting the truth to get you to do stuff for him
that's a self sacrifice, which will fuck you up
and when you only do what others tell you to do, you're only existing for others
but you're also not supposed to exist just for others
people usually go by that
the phrase "if you want something done perfect, do it yourself" means that only you can do something perfect in your conception of perfect
so there will be conflict
problem being, people don't articulate or know exactly what they want
no, they are doing exactly what is told to do
there's a subreddit, r/maliciouscompliance, where people follow exactly what they are told to do, and those that told still find a way to complain
even if you do exactly as they told you, they will find a way to complain
that's the problem
so they will disagree with you
if you only do what people ask, there will be something not perfect in their eyes
"if you want something done perfect, do it yourself"
if you only do what's asked of you, you won't be happy
you don't have to play life on singleplayer
you can always come here and ask us about decisions
like drugs or being part of a mafia
there is some basic stuff that will fuck you up that you can avoid doing
you might as well live life while you wait for that thing
but that impending doom rarely arrives
you're having a feeling of impending doom
but what makes you think otherwise?
yes, necessarily
it's way easier to evaluate physical harm than mental harm, se we would definitely know
if it did cause hearing loss, we would know already
which bad decisions, specifically?
so let me ask you directly, what are you worried that won't be an option later?
There are only a few things that won‚Äôt remain as options once you take another path
They both have a stable job, but wanted to get back on mathematics because they both said it‚Äôs their dream to teach math
One is 40-something and the other is 50-something
For example, my class has two older people than the average
A lot of people try new stuff at a later age
You‚Äôll probably have the other options later
one thing that works for me is literally saying "stop" out loud
I just say something and she talks like she knows more
it's not even arguing
how do I deal with someone who still thinks they know more than you despite you repetitively proving otherwise?
don't do that
and pride takes people to some questionable places
for some people, driving is about pride
yes, but unfortunately not everyone thinks like that
so ai is not going anywhere
people won't even give up driving for ai
this can quickly turn into "it's the victim's fault for being raped"
nope
that only works with people that are willing to talk in the first place
"precisely" or "I definitely agree"
the channel is specifically to build points, not to point messages
Aria, don't do that
you're not sinking to their level
what
how would you stop violence without violence?
I'm lost
what does throwing strawmen mean?
or, at the very least, we should try to change things when necessary
we can't go utopia, but we can definitely change things
what do people need to accept more? I didn't catch that
usage of ^ is not recommended on this channel
blacklist them
Do trolleys even exist anymore?
just wait the 1 hour to see what happens
is it dm or a server?
maybe just wait for this one hour
<@!302063351767498752> if it's about a bad time with parents, talk here
this isn't a serious topic, might want to check <#680064219449917497>
I think Rakhi likes the word bigoted
discriminative
who have you heard about adulthood from?
where did you get that?
it's not the only worthwhile part
never too late to start
the only thing I have to do these days is take the trash out
should one bathe every single day?
baseball is cool
it's all about trying stuff
it goes a long way to break "I must checkmark this thing as done"
wouldn't say it's a threat, but I can't classify as safe because I don't understand it fully
I can agree with relationship not needing to be the extensive amount of bollocks, but I also don't understand what he wants
tell him it makes you uncomfortable, and always make it clear you don't want anything
when talking about relationships, there are a lot of types
you are in a relationship, just of a different kind
seems like he didn't get the memo yet
also, do clarify that it is indeed not the same level of affection
might be intereseting to ask what he means with "partnership"
as far as I know, a partnership doesn't involve love/affection
was that word used before?
that's a new word for that context
partnership?
possibly, but wait for him to respond before conclusions
ask what were the labels
people will want to interect
for some things, it is, but mostly it isn't
then she'll be more mad for nothing, she can't just make you magically get a 10 instead
just a parent getting mad that their child isn't the perfect child they wanted
just let it happen, you probably won't be able to convince her otherwise
usually helps to just say it out loud something as simple as "stop overthinking and do something else"
it's all a matter of just stoping yourself or making yourself do something else instead
there isn't a "solution" for this situation
that's all I posted
send me what you see
I didn't delete anything
instead of the 100% back then
for me I can say I overthink like 2% of situations nowadays
won't exactly fix, if you mean completely stop it, but it can get a lot better
were they running or fighting?
looks pretty clear to me
if you press down on one's neck and one says "I can't breathe" what do you think is going to happen?
what means third degree?
if soldiers are meant to be expendable pawns, I for one wouldn't be proud of them
"family member had to serve on the war because the people who started the war didn't want to die"
do you also find christmas annoying?
then keep the annoyance for yourself, don't be petty about it
that's called supporting
where are you even seeing it being shoved down people's throats?
2020
reconsider that friend of yours
which is a load of crap, both are about equality
saying Black Lives Matter is about black superiority is the same thing as saying feminism is about female superiority
it won't, which is why the topic shouldn't be brought up again
don't make this into a fight
use constructive words to agree
refrain from the use of ^ on this channel
bohemian rhapsody is the current bgm of the world
bad people also contribute to that
whenever you get to class again, take a paper and write something like "I'm socially awkward but looking to make friends, talk to me" and leave it on your desk
the idea just crossed my head, but I see nothing wrong with it
communication is key, don't leave anything to be guessed
it's like a videogame, there has to be feedback after certain timeframes/events
ask her how's the relationship going for her
starting with the line "I know you're in the best of intentions" or something like that seems pretty good
but yes, I was ok
after I came back to my senses, they fed me skim milk (I only drink whole milk) so that also tasted bad
from a single sip
not only it tasted horrible, I passed out
I also had an episode of tasting beer as a kid
Or does?
So a lacto vegetarian doesn‚Äôt eat milk products?
What is lacto and ovo vegetarian?
Brexit isn‚Äôt done yet?
Kerrik has the right idea
"accidentally" cough on them
who even is churchill
just sounds like a troll
uh, is that a pridefall attack?
some time frames with nothing on them also count for good
they don't need to constantly happen
there is time for things to happen
when you block your own vision, yes
Oh
Gru memes?
canada for sure
"death promo, masks 100% off"
put up a sign that says "mask off if you want to die"
ask your manager if you can go the angry route
is it you the kid in question?
kinda surprised it even needs to be asked
no

hell yeah we need a hard shift
this world is doomed to shit if it keeps going like this
we would need a hard shift to be able
no, we can't achieve this "good" world
greed wins because "I don't care about anyone else, I can just kill them"
because only the bad people are in positions of power
the question answers itself, greed
yes
veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery far
that's a worry for the very far future
ah
what does tha mean?
live through you?
parents don't take no for an answer when they don't want
pressure him, that's exactly what she's doing
call the police
nice
socratic?
a major part in learning to be a teacher is learning what to *not* do
low money -> low education, even the most obvious shit passes -> easy to believe promises or not even understand what the promises mean
poor people voting for the stupidest candidate seems common for me
no, dating app is shit
things don't work out and you don't even get a answer for what went wrong
also, ghosting
probably better that way
also, people are bad at relationships
well, love could take a fucking plane to be here faster
"love will come your way"
that's what people tell us to do, but it's a large amount of bullshit
what is a social system?
financial security is a big yes
then you are not to be the one to try and help him
social anxiety does not apply in friendship
I need to know at what extent are you joking
social anxiety?
costs patience and good will
it's the opposite
that usually isn't the problem
helps with logic a lot
I'm good with my asperger's
transitioning could be considered treating trans
that's how
"I can't breath in a mask"
just say "yes, that" or some words
Aria, do remember ^ is not constructive
Sub, you sparked some of this with your words, better just stop
imagine invinting gamers, who are gaming to mostly escape reality, to go experience a reality that can kill you
I find that disgusting
what
military recruiting on twitch?
meanwhile usa is likely to not get a second wave because everyone will die in the first
they're walking time bombs
those that purposefully don't wear a mask aren't doing anything else either
dying for the country?
what's the selling point?
what the fuck, they recruit in schools?
it makes me angry at the education system
enlighten me
white fever?
I asked about marvel movies, she proceeded to say "it's too much marketing" with a small rant about joker and "I think you can see why I don't like marvel"
it adds up to other things in the conversation

is bad grammar/syntax a dealbreaker?
that's good
then he's a prime person to talk with about it
but you do have the option of not saying anything unless necessary
if it does anything other than helping them understand, they're bad
do you let them know?
that's interesting

General chat is usually just memes
Where lies the line between preference and fetishism? ü§î
what is hunky dory?

early bop to take it easy
here we go
what?
people here can provide that
if you want just good words and hugs but no understading, do tell us
so, if you really don't want to be understood anymore, don't even put yourself up to be hit
because it always ends like that
that's why I recommend not coming here
it doesn't
coming here only to say "I'll never be understood" only makes it worse
then why are you in this chat?
just don't give up on being understood
where do these people get their facts from?
bitch what
"that mask is killing people"
oh the sweet irony of corona actually making it difficult to breathe
Don‚Äôt do gacha, kids
about being a sponge, his two videos talking with Lilypichu are the ones
he explains things very well and in various ways
I very much recommend watching stuff from him because he tackles very important problems that streamers have
in short, he's a psychiatrist that helps streamers/gamers
https://www.youtube.com/c/HealthyGamerGG/featured
have you heard of Dr K?
on the other, trolls and haters will get the best out of you
on one side, it's good because you go ham on good feelings
a sponge, someone who absorbs all the feelings easily
which is very much detrimental for a popular person
sounds like you have a sponge personality, Aria
isn't that for every age tho?
Is it illegal to play after that?

Now you know
On a lighter topic it would be fine, but ‚Äúgrooming a girl‚Äù is a about pedophilia
Serious discussion might not be the place for that
Nuker, this is not the time for gay miku
‚ÄúGrooming a girl‚Äù has a very special meaning
For safety of all, do specify it‚Äôs a dog when saying that in public
Be scary enough that no one dares mess with you

who the fuck sees sexualized children and thinks of making a movie about it
article says there is inspiration for the film
there's such thing as a private subreddit?
excellent, thanks <:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
a question sparked from general chat just now, can a non-plural person have a headspace?
but what is it about? Money, personal relationship vs professional relationship, privacy or something else
a basic answer would be "advise them"
why would a bully care about reading/watching it?
sounds incredibly unrealistic
guilting bullies?
I am having a very hard time understanding the revenge part
suicide revenge?
what's the catch of 13 reasons?
Because if we‚Äôre talking about different definitions of conflict, we can‚Äôt go forward
But I‚Äôll need you to exactly define ‚Äòconflict‚Äô
Yes, you can do that without conflict
So you want to be important?
What kind of conflict do you want to solve?
I first need to know something
Ok stop
What do you want conflict for?
that's more good than bad
and you can't say you never will
you haven't made a major impact on anything *yet*
if you're saying you don't want to do stuff, then you won't make any impact
it's about doing stuff
"climb the tree" here isn't a literal climbing of a tree
learn what in the world needs significant change and go after it
then study that
you want to solve conflict, go study psychology to know how to do it
find out what you care about and go after it
then what do you care about?
so just find something that is significant
what isn't significant?
without*
well you haven't done it yet
that's for you to answer
get started anywhere
literal tons of trial and error
you know what that means?
there's your objective, to find something significant
now people do care, which is good
I agree with that, but we can't change the past
that's 100% a good thing
people are caring about deaths
but why do you care if it's hypocrisy or not?
is it bad to follow a good trend?
and?
should we just keep not caring?
if people do care, why is it a bad thing?
if you don't think everyone has it, how do you know who has it to avoid them?
there is absolutely a need to know what he enjoys
do not confuse
nonono don't say that
-you don't need reasons to enjoy
just enjoy things
as we have told you before, you don't need justification
how do you learn to live with permanent damage from covid?
the 'few' 3.8 million people
if you're saying you would rather have 3.8 million deaths
it sounds like you don't care
looks like you aren't caring about deaths now
not just people dying, people not being able to work anymore because of permanent damage
better to just leave now
if you're just mad because people didn't care before, you won't think logically
because that's a spiral you don't want to get into
is this "oh no, the economy"?
mars?
where the fuck do you live?
too early?
if anything it will strengthen the relationship, it will be assured that you are appreciative and mean it, no matter how hard it is for you to "tone" it
you could open up to them about this insecurity
rip
or confront her
you just explained why, so avoid her
uighurs?
is that a cute name for conversion therapy?
re-education camps?
I just wouldn't understand the music scaring her off, the rest seems regular
no logic thought, but I would really just rather not have to move, they're forcing my hand
I would say it's more of an instinct
but my autistic ass would rather stay where I currently am
apply as math teacher anywhere and profit
I absolutely can, I'm studying math
I really fucking hope the country burns to the ground
and in a country filled with corruption, there is only one use for a briefcase
which means double the money can fit in a briefcase
I thought this wasn't going to be, but brazil now has a 200 currency bill
if your parents aren't ok with it, you won't handle the burden of having told them
I usually go by "does complaining help change?"
you can work on that
why are you guilty of x thing?
I'd say thinking logically
can you worry about something you have no idea about?
for specific posts
I think you can set who is allowed to view things you post
ye, those two situations are a lot different
freaking kids first
starting with kids, then proceeding to teenagers
one state here in brazil is going reopen schools
and I haven't seen many people saying which one they are
some people like going out first, some people like talking a lot first
do remember that dating is a lottery
about love or the general art of not giving a fuck?
so you can sink down the time it takes
corona virus will only stay around as a large threat for so long
but I would need to hear more about how the current state of the world plays in that part to get a good grasp
if you mean the "dating someone" kind of love, that is
saying "i wanna feel perfectly content without anyone else" is like a direct opposite of "i still cant stop thinking about love constantly"
you seem to have a lot of things to sort out
where I then get to you, smol Lectric
but I don't want that, so not going to walk that path
I could go live a very good life by myself, mostly going to a job field where I can absolutely win (math teacher, easy competition)
but not having someone? that's nope from me
so I'm just fine not having them
I didn't feel like having children to take care since 10 or even earlier
the same for having someone but not children (like me)
if you fall in the last category since early ages, it's very easy to be good by yourself
with the first being the crushing majority
have someone and children (human survival standard -> have someone but no children -> not have someone nor children
I think of it like a scale
but for a few people, they don't feel that need
for starters, the human mind and body is made for being with someone
ye it's both, but I'm biased towards difficult to accomplish
a loooooooooooong way
that goes a long way
> Talk to people on your terms, when you wantt, how you want
this is just one sided
talk to the other person about personal space and time. It's a two way street, don't leave them hanging
oh ye, that
sometimes it's not that someone won't put effort into online, but that they aren't able to
there is such a thing as a love language of physical touch
> People who can't have successful online relationships can't have succesful in person relationships
this one because I seem to be on the same boat as Sub and Lectric
about the online/offline topic, do not generalize
so they want to kill the virus with cops?
is virus relief dollars the money used in case it goes very bad?
having a punching bag or a pillow can help let out frustrations
kick a pillow instead
pls don't kick a puppy
and I don't suppose it's ok to go around asking women for their sizes
I haven't even started hrt, but I want to know sizes to see what it will be for me
the first one seems to be kinda it
is there a website informing/showing boob sizes? trans reasons
people are just flat idiots
logical thinking is not covered in the us education system
churches having any power still gets to me
I'm curious on that vs brazil
do a lot of women consider leaving india?
is domestic violence commonly overlooked in india?
and why the fuck was he not arrested often?
‚ÄúMy brother-in-law often used to beat my sister for giving birth to five daughters,‚Äù Anita‚Äôs brother-in-law told The Times of India.
or am I being fed lies by potential date?
but does oxygen play a part in it?
I mean is the oxidation of cells the thing that actually happens?
is oxygen what makes us get old?
the truth can hurt, but it is necessary
maybe there isn't one
if you, their friend, don't know this answer, we probably can't help it
in case some guilt tripping happens ("you won't help a friend in need?" or something), you'll be able to dodge that
you just have to tell him, some people just aren't built to deal with that and you are one of them
also,
> he said that he wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it
there's your chance to also speak about being uncomfortable
in that case, asking to spoiler tag would be just saying "I won't read it"
but is it a situation where you are always uncomfortable with it?
psa: don't make the same joke about your children for 20 years when they constantly ask you to stop
do you need to abolish gender?
we communicate through words and signs, how can we deattach from those?
do develop that thought so we can understand you better
people make assumptions based on literally nothing
then you'll need to stop existing
to me, you sound like "I can't deal with this problem so I want it gone"
not just "what if this incredibly unexpected thing happens for the sake of the argument"
think about the "what ifs" if they are a common problem
that's the major part, you need to find the meaning before doing anything to it
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
what don't you get?
don't ask that before answering what gender is
study something before trying to delete it from humanity
because, if you don't know what it is, you can't want to abolish it
do you know what it means?
literally came from "you have a penis and you don't have a penis"
dick
this argument is literally inside out
like, what?
> if I said "i'm a music fan" and someone assumed I was not accepting of other music tastes
"this person said they like music, so they must not accept certain music"

I'm not helping her
One is the flip, the other is the flop
I refer to them as a unit
yes
if I ever say "I'm going to prison", she is why
and she fucking donated my second flip flop
said flip flop was drying because I washed it
today she also complained I'm walking around the house with a sock instead of my flip flop
I didn't expect anything smart from her and I'm still surprised
this is the person that also cries about the sink being wet
it's drying next to clothes
and she actually washed it
it's a one-time use mask
but we're in the middle of a fucking pandemic and she wants to reuse a mask
this bitch complains about me using a napkin a second time, which only comes in contact with clean food and table
"it didn't get in contact with the virus, so we can use it"
she said "to use it again"
my father saw a disposable mask on the drying rack and asked why was it there and not in the trash
like massively missing braincells
ok, my mother is a fucking idiot
also the flip side, what if they are wondering if you just tolerate them? then whoops, you went away
I have no fucking clue why she uses the disposable ones
we have regular masks to wear
Does china want hawaii or something?
don't generalize people
Then what does ‚Äújust let hawaii be in china‚Äôs hand‚Äù mean?

you take things overly jokingly?
just takes a lot of time
it is, but you can get used to not doing it
each one can have their valid problems
from the beginning of the topic: do not put yourself down because "others have it harder"
how the fuck do you progress backwards
it was legal and now it's illegal?
just vote, no specific candidate?
what does it mean to get out the vote?
400k viewers is insane
what is a circuit breaker lockdown?
it's very common to have them, but you are a good person for mentally shooing them
intrusive thoughts
there is a name for those bad thoughts that happen
"second time"
how long did you think about to make that decision?
both sides have their goods and bads
Weren‚Äôt divine things seen as scientifically important?
> maintaining imperial over metric will eventually become a bigger deficit than actually replacing the system
or why this isn't the case

you got sources for those, Desszilla?
talk about judging a book by its cover
Both are changing and evolving
what defines an (un)interesting person?
for me, at least
usually, staring at a wall isn't actually paying attention to the wall
staring at a wall allows your mind to wander around many thoughts
you'd be surprised
especially with autism and hyperfocus being a thing
addiction is a strong word, you would need to make sure it's that
I'd trade people smoking cigarettes for people smoking weed any day
ye, other countries are busy making stupid decisions
What is that way?
I‚Äôm all for helping people find other ways to decrease anxiety
Basically capitalizing on death
I see cigarettes packages with all the ‚Äúyou‚Äôll die by smoking this‚Äù but they are still sold
But major part of my problem is money endorsing cigarettes
Don‚Äôt know about heroin
Yes I did
And especially so when they smoke in a place with hundreds of ‚Äúdo not smoke‚Äù signs
But I have a problem when people decide to smoke cigarettes not considering the lots of others they‚Äôll be affecting
I‚Äôve seen articles about medical use of weed, so that also makes me ok with weed over tobacco
Also, if somebody could explain to me what people find so good in smoking, I‚Äôd appreciate it
I don‚Äôt feel the quick embrace of death when smelling weed
Yes, I‚Äôd rather have people not smoke anything at all, but since that‚Äôs not going to happen I‚Äôll root for weed > cigarettes
the latter
you could start researching that
you said you wanted to solve conflicts, that could branch to psychology
you got tested?
that'll be better for everyone
move the us to mars
delete the system <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
those 49% won't matter for the final count
the major problem is when you have 51% of the state go for a candidate, they other 49% is completely ignored
I think either someone wanted to get fancy with voting or someone realized they could win with the shit system
and it was my first time hearing of it
I was 14 when I realized it was crap
can we nuke us voting system yet
what did he use as reason for that?
trump actually said to stop the count?
I'd guess terran play in starcraft
what does it mean to call it?
is it officially over?
biden officially won?
you focus on the thing you've made the decision
thank
o, it makes you lose weight?
wondering thought, can smoking make you fat?
if it doesn't happen anymore, that's good
is that true?
when I read your first message, I see a present tense, which means you still consider yourself gullible
so a different question from "why am I gullible" would be "why did I believe them"
something like "there's an external link, so even tho I won't look at it, it feels true enough"
a basic one would be "I believe them because they have evidence", even if the evidence isn't true
just realizing you're gullible but not know why is probably bad for you
a good thing to figure out would be why are you so gullible, to tackle the problem at the root
you can't argue math with no math
show me the statistics
right here, right now
I want to see the math
show me the statistics
wait
kek
then how do they think it's irregular in any way?
and no hard evidence, as pointed out
then go advocate for that, not something a few people think is irregular
bruh the electoral vote system literally is irregular
so we should investigate any and everything that is suspected?
come on, hard evidence
show us the proof
and obvious
I'd say the wall is very open
where does this 71 million come from?

because danger for me is a life threat, and I wouldn't say a life without life threats is boring
define danger
also, why is not being scared directly boring?

it'd be really funny if that link went to a page that just said "No."
new one for the list of "totally not slur", along with karen and ok boomer
also very great, so many benefits about that
so it'll spread more
psychology is especially very good because places like schools are starting to think about getting it done seriously
and by normal salary I mean an average job
that could total 16k per month, when a normal salary is about 2-3k
my psychologist charges R$100 per session (1 hour)
for the monetary aspect of career, psychology is very good
there's that thing of solving conflicts you mentioned that could be looked into, study psychology or something
how much time do you have until they do that?

what is parler?
social inability comes in autism
then objectively false
do you know everyone?
but 'wrong' is a bad word to describe that, the better one would be 'incompatible'
for relationships, doing things wrong depends on the person you're trying to date
punishment for?
I remember that person, not that parler was advertised ü§î
but do consider asking why they never invite you
you can go lonewolf for a period of time while trying to find new friends
a lot of things do, don't just accept and give up
and?
good news is, when you do get a relationship, you'll be good at keeping it good
not lifetime, you just take longer to learn
have you grieved already?
if you're venting to like 2 people, better do it on dms

just get the idea and leave the person to rot
shit people sometimes have good ideas, and that's fine
I have no care for references or authors
stuff like this is why I don't care in the slightest about who wrote what
maybe they didn't actually see
the fuck you need a wall for?
is this trump
one less thing for me to worry about
bless his face
on an incredible turn of events, he was able to close my account even thought I had 74 cents on it
so that solves the problem for now
but the guy who took my call said I won't be charged if the account is dormant and while corona is a thing
turns out I can't access the account without a valid us number
not even my phone company is answering wtf
I'm trying their twitter support
but even the numbers for outside callers that is supposed to be toll free isn't working
I can't call them, I'm outside the us
"We cannot verify your entry. Please try again"
but I can't get a password reset, which I did before
I'm pretty sure I remember the user
can't connect to my online account, nor recover it, and I am not being able to call their toll free number
I'm having real troubles now
does anyone in the US use Wellsfargo?
willing to go further on this?
do any of you have such values?
why?
this is what I want to know
I mean about organ donation
what in "this"?
what doesn't sit well with you?
I usually don't hold social values
or taking your organs isn't desecration, but from others is?
that's even more confusing, you don't think your own body is sacred but others are?
then I can't understand that
what does desecration mean?
what if they don't have a spouse?
guess starving is now on the list
lunch was 4h30min ago and I was just done exercising
"didn't you eat enough at lunch?"
my mom just tried to terrorize me with a one liner
stupid parents topic?
and goes on and on about it
but he comes with basically "you could have killed us"
just saying "you left it on overnight" would be more than enough for me
I'm not either
not cool
don't terrorize your children
so I'm pretty sure I'm being terrorized here
and I've seen the thing turn off by itself when it goes too hot
and a whole lecture about it
"the house could be on fire when we wake up"
and he came with the same shit from like 10 years ago
because I did that yesterday, my father saw it like 30 minutes later
if it's accidentally left on overnight
what's the likelihood of a george foreman grill setting a house on fire?
to the guillotine with them
and I hate it
o
I'm not gonna tell people that we're fucking going to die because of a grill
no I don't
but he'll be butthurt about it
and I just want to scream "fuck you I got it already"
more lecturing
then the next day, does the same thing

it's a famous post
1. how dense the population is
2. how dense the population is
not unpredictable, just stupid
I don't know about you, but a lot of people predicted this
did they really?
"Thomas had never seen such bullshit before"
easy solution, just have someone else solve it for you
do not generalize
some bad teachers don't define the whole group
aren't trump supporters unruly kids?

move chat
done to or done by trump, actually
I'd say anything done to trump will incite them more

guillotine <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
at least until they're dead
is that a hint that they won't stop?
ATT will not support people who think there is a fraud in voting?
I almost know what this means, but I need to confirm
if they did, they wouldn't be trump supporters
*this* is the circus fire I wanna see
what is the qanon?
that or they'll pitch in on everything he does
what is martial law and "deep state"?
if the international standard says otherwise, it's fucking stupid
I don't want anyone who actually commits crimes to be on charge of anything
presidents should definitely be allowed to get criminally charged
who else was an actor?
never forgot the name again
I failed a question on a history test about it
hey I remember that book
it is used to play a game called Truco in brazil
but while people are in the past, there is already a deck with only numbers
still having Q and K is weird for a new deck idea
or no king/queen at all?
I'm missing something, is there a new deck of cards in the making which the sole purpose is to rank queen higher?
wait
you'll need a better catch phrase for serious discussion
there isn't a sacred text that says you can't change card order
you can always say "queen is ranked higher for this round/game"
54 would be 6x9
56
one of the spanish speaking ones, don't know which
but if I recall correctly, deck doesn't have origin in brazil
they're not
it goes from 1 to 12, missing 8 and 9 (I don't know why)
"attack on titan makes people genocide supporters"
this line of thought will reach "video games make people violent"
there are passive enemies as well
not every enemy tries to kill you
it's the same story
because consistenly killing enemies in games is fictional genocide
do you play games where you kill enemies?
and their problem is supporting real genocide
that's what you think, but what is reality?
if it's fictional genocide, does it really matter what they think?
"if you watch romance, it says that you like something in romance"
I meant that in the more open, obvious sense
np
correct
if you don't care about the punching bag, why should you care about the pixels you are looking at?
you watch them get attacked all the same
a character in attack on titan could be the same as a punching bag
everyone feels anger, for example, and there are many ways to let it out
people pay to smash objects with all their strength to let rage out
if you do not perform the actions irl, it says that you care about real people
everything says things about you
some people know that they can't do it irl, so they are satisfied with the fictional
on fiction, people can engage in the pleasures of death and genocide
should you be guilty of something you didn't take part in just because, like, your father did?
I find that weird
what is guilt by association?
yes
at least in brazil
it is when it's no longer a hookup app
I see plenty of girls on tinder with the first thing in their profile being "I'M TRANS"
not all
which people?
We don‚Äôt actually know if cis people are more straight
why is discord among them?
what does that mean?
you only do not talk if they do something harmful *after* knowing
speak up and get them to help you
which is when independency happens
when you put someone in this world, all their problems are yours until they say they aren't
your parents *are* supposed to help you
some people need time to sort stuff out before learning
speaking as a teacher, you're not always in condition to learn
read all or read none
don't skim through serious discussion
being someone who understands next to nothing in these questions, what's the purpose in seeing/sharing results?
what punishment solves something?
money good nothing else matters
we are monke
aren't humans just cruel and primitive on the inside?
also¬≤
also, people don't look at memes seriously
I don't think it's advertisement if there is no brand name
which flag is that?
the rest of it can be thrown in the "bad ideas" trash can
and that's it, as far as I know
many breaks is healthy
I'll argue in favor of the many break times they have
I think it'll be easier to point out what *doesn't* need a change
Hello ladies and lasses, I'm here to ask maybe complicated questions for you. This knowledge will help me with my transition, as I have been thinking about these things, but I don't feel like I hold all the answers, so:
1. What do you feel that is the most feminine thing in you?
2. What makes you happy about being a woman?
3. What dreams do you have that can only be achieved by women, not by men? (This one might be too black and white, but anything you have for this will help)
I would also like you to inform me if you're a trans or cis woman. For now I don't think this specific data will help, but I'd like to put my hands on all the info I could get.
You can answer on pm if you don't feel comfortable sharing any particular thing in public.
Thanks all that answer this :D
So she knows what she‚Äôs doing is wrong
nothing more than her obligation, no bonus points awarded
did you take a picture?
didn't happen, but feels like it did
because that's exactly what deja vu is
record what she answers, most likely will be more ammo for you
tell her to do jump off the bridge
if you keep thinking that it can't, you aren't changing, so life won't as well
a lot of things can still change in quarantine
that's not the one defining factor
it's a parallel of "life is trying to change, but you aren't, so it doesn't actually change"
I think life has to change with you
odds are it will be difficult later as well
what situation involves all 3.8 billion people?
this seems good, is it good?
it's too unrealistic for me to care
not being extinct sounds pretty cool
exactly my point, oil companies can die for all I care
so efforts will be in the future gen, not the old one
we die
exactly, you need more young people
why not?
the lack of a future generation existing would probably be a bigger thing than keeping the old one alive
the current young people mostly wouldn't care
stay alive first, the economy can come later
it's not
I don't think economy would be the worry of an extinction threat
I'd bet people are way more scared of not being able to have children than dying
I say hypothetical "ifs", which also create pointless anxiety, are not serious
outbreeding is becoming the problem nowadays, so that would warrant a serious question
your question is answered by humanity literally fucking away the problem
and since humans don't care about the covid happening now, which is 100% a fact, no one will care to answer the hypothesis
for the human race to die in 1 century, it would need a very good reason for it
let me put it this way
and since humans are horny af, that won't happen
that would be answered with reproduction
too hypothetical of an "if" to think about it
that's cool, I don't know if those exist here
more practical knowledge instead of all the theories in school?
what is a trade school?
if you didn't read the serious discussion, don't comment in the serious discussion
that's my question, what area doesn't have one party consent for parental problems?
in rock paper scissors, parent defeats logic
not against a parent
because it's very weird if it's "show evidence. No you can't record without consent, even if telling your parents that you are recording makes them very angry and tell you not to record"
isn't the law always "you can record your parent fucking up on you to help your case"?
everything is relative
remember to not give in to the absolutist view
which one is this?
I searched sanction meaning and got 1: "approval" and 2: "penalty", which I feel like are complete opposites
with that, vaccinating these future teachers is a hell of a justification
because low amount of teachers and crappy education
that's a lot of people who don't know shit
consider that a state in brazil is the size of a country in europe
the average math score for students after finishing high school is 22/100 in my state
and said old teachers recognize they can't keep up with tech
especially when current math teachers are 40+
so I'm not willing to sacrifice any of them
not much different in other colleges, because math is a nightmare
in the entire college
and currently, in my college, there are a total of 10 students on the way to be math teachers
math teachers are scarce here
you want context?
or not, depending on how shit the situation stays
so we will get to classroom before graduation
colleges here have internship starting halfway through the course
brazil
wrong
or maybe already teachers, if they scored a job
future teachers
why would it be a legal nightmare?
why is a vaccine age-locked with such a high age?
those and the students in college learning to be teachers
I hope it can extend to future teachers who are learning now
there's talk here about vaccinating education people like teachers
considering the elders are getting vaccinated first, we have to wait longer inside
but it'll exist
will it be destroyed because most people don't actually care about properly learning their own language? probably yeah
considering the stubbornness, people will definitely speak it
just like people that speak the language die, more people/content will be produced
if the internet stays here forever, languages will be preserved forever
get a few school books and there you go
all the words in the dictionary, not ALL the words
don't you just need a dictionary and a recording of all the words?
wouldn't preserving the language require not adapting it? like the gender problem
all that "I wish to travel around the world and meet new places" but won't learn english to save their lives
people don't actually want to learn another language
that's one of the problems
you also get to learn a second language, which is good for work
instead of changing the word, speak a non-gendered language
but my solution is very different
coming from the portuguese language, same problems
my point would be more like "are you suggesting something for a terrorist attack?"
"why haven't they done x thing" about terrorist attacks is a very weird thing to ask
that's a jump and a half
that's a new one
do extremist jojo fans sentence people to eternal hell?
the other, angry part would be very angry
one part of brazil would be very happy, the ones with sense
depends how much money is in the equation
he's pretty much sinking the country
if someone could deck bolsonaro without bad consequences, I'd be happy
what did she do?
how does femboy relate to nazi?
time to throw Arkansas in the trash can
if I ever hear someone say that I'm probably sending them to therapy
how has that ever worked
can I read the article without having to subscribe?
and since they can't ditch discord as a whole, they are probably forcing devs to roll with this update
because apps that have nsfw are bad
what desperation for "free" money does
If a cop is ‚Äúpanic shooting‚Äù, they probably need psychological evaluation and need to not be a cop
reduction surgery is a thing you could do
do you hate breasts?
and also ask specific questions to help you think
you could wait and ponder about the changes before continuing
terrified as in "I don't want them to happen"?
what is manslaughter?
highly unlikely that she'll suddenly start dating and that it'll last a long time
if you don't know enough, you shouldn't worry about her flirting with someone else
if you haven't confessed, don't take it for granted
it still might be just casual flirting
aka maybe she thinks you don't have an interest in her if you didn't say anything
2) if you didn't express fondness back, she went to seek the next one
1) she was giving out a nice compliment, no further intentions
also, since she has expressed that you thought you were cute, I'll name 2 possibilities
harsh wake up call does not require a punch in the face along with an insult
but I don't get what the paranoia is about
can't start something serious when you don't know the person
one purpose of going out with someone is getting to know them

I missed that part of NFT, how does it output CO2?
But then it‚Äôs about general relationships, so it falls short on helping your case
If the argument is ‚ÄúI hate gay relationships when they‚Äôre abusive‚Äù, you should just cross out the gay word
not the lasagna
I think the end of a friendship comes with grief, so take your time
1: she realized she was being bad and left for the time being
2: she went mad mad and you should just let it go
I'd say 1 out of 2 options
she Jen or she Lily?
but that doesn't seem to be the case
that someone should hate being mean to you too
cut her loose now, accept her later if she gets it together
I'd give her a prize for doing that
eggcellent
how long has this been going?
"When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die"
it was that person
Less assholes going around without masks and less deaths
It is a whole lot better
That seems bad
What is the honor system?
do you enjoy moderating it?

I thought the systems were explained in easy terms ._.

where can I find answers, then?
how does socialism work?
what's the alternative?
the idea of "you get paid relative to your amount of work" is appealing to me
I'd say don't replace capitalism, instead tone it down
What does it mean to be patronised by people?
does it required knowing what is leftism?
vet time?
and if you can't blacklist the tumblr recommendations because they don't have tags, the only logical option is not using tumblr, as I see it
talking to random accounts on tumblr is literally the same as nothing, so save yourself
isn't Texas the first place where pvp is legal?
if there aren't concrete evidence, you're just adding wood to the fire

This comic doesn‚Äôt mention tomboy
What comic gave you that idea?
No, they don‚Äôt have to be
why abolish schools?
cool, thanks
how do I politely ask?
yes that, how do I tell apart fictives from people who are just role playing?
like an anime character
how do I tell apart role playing from plural people who are a character?
my mother is basically forcing me to use this while everyone else use a new sponge because I "destroy" sponges

what's UKIP?
<@!379337518371307522> are you still up to elaborate on that abolishing school thought?
are churches still exempt from taxes?
remember to play nice
I think the intent of the post is let people know that the school is using this "right" and to not consider it
not a good call
because lying is like building a house using play doh instead of cement
for me, bottomline is "lying is bad"
on the example you gave, don't you have the option to say "I don't wanna talk about it"?
I go by the basis of "everyone should be seeing a doctor for mental health"

who is pressing you to go with your mom?
Oh, I just remembered
I personally advocate for people learning english and circumventing the problem
It will take a lot to reach anywhere useful with non-gendered terms
Latinx/latine aren‚Äôt actually used
Unless the group is all female
That also happens in portuguese and spanish, if you‚Äôre referring to a group, you use normally male gendered words
Oh, that‚Äôs true
I just don‚Äôt know why not just ‚Äòlatin‚Äô
English is not gendered, so I think latino works for both
Personally I think e is better, because you can actually pronounce it (even more so for blind assisting tech reading stuff)
To fight this gendered norm, some people advocate for latinx (I think alluring to the unknown variable ‚Äòx‚Äô) or latine (words ending in e are commonly not gendered, like ‚Äòestudante‚Äô, which means student)
Latina is female, latino is male
In spanish and portuguese, a lot of words are gendered, and latino/latina is one of them
but I can imagine the horrible pronunciation
I don't watch them, so I have no clue
one r
it's 'obrigado'
so bike and show are the only words that are not modified
I also just remembered we use the word bike
Because of that, I think people learning english would be the faster route
I think Academia Brasileira de Letras and Academia das Ci√™ncias de Lisboa would be it
I don‚Äôt know if people would actually accept any borrowed words
It‚Äôs very common to hear someone pronounce ‚Äúthink‚Äù as ‚Äúfink‚Äù
People have this weird concept that ‚Äòth‚Äô makes and F sound
Secondly, ‚Äòth‚Äô for a D sound wouldn‚Äôt fly
Only the borrowed word ‚Äúshow‚Äù has w, no other word features them
For one, y k and w are not ‚Äúlegal‚Äù letters in portuguese
No, they would modify they/them
Like ‚Äúenjoy the show‚Äù
I think the only word that has never suffered from that is ‚Äòshow‚Äô
Regarding to this, people tend to modify borrowed words to a portuguese manner
Eleven = onze
You don‚Äôt say ten-one
No, it‚Äôs like english
Because stupid, that‚Äôs why
The others are not
And numbers ending in those
Both one and two
Um/uma
Even one is gendered
Only if you circumvent using ‚Äúthe person‚Äù
Correct
‚ÄòEles‚Äô is for male, but we have a rule that, if the group is mixed, you default to using male terms
Not exactly, they them is directly non-gendered
The plural form ‚Äòeles‚Äô though, can be used for an unknown group
No, ‚Äòele‚Äô is heavily gendered
So some people want to use ‚Äòelu‚Äô for non-gendered
For pronouns, we have ‚Äòele‚Äô for male and ‚Äòela‚Äô for female
depends on the person, I don't consider strange to be bad
are gg and f the same word?
gg and f are the same?
what is the gg word?
if enough people use it as good, a person trying to use it as bad won't do anything
that's what I want to convey
what is dilution?
what is connotation?
but you're sounding like "only the Evil can taint things, the Good cannot purify anithing"
when you change the meaning, it stops being a slur
regardless of price, I will question the necessity of reading news to find out that "illegal thing has been banned"
isn't the premise of the black market being illegal?
not my choice of reading
exactly, free stress on the news
doesn't make sense to be both
it's either good or it sucks
and I can't do anything about it
when I read stuff like this, all it does is increase anger, stress and anxiety
why not?
so I will recommend that to you
the certainty of find stupid shit on the news is why I don't read them
cool
so we just need to wait for only fans to die the exact same way tumblr did?
Then people are weird
But then it ends up here anyway and the talk is the same ‚Äúdream bad, but we keep talking about him‚Äù
Same for me
I just don‚Äôt get why people that don‚Äôt like him interact with things he does
His rep definitely goes down
There isn‚Äôt a head on ‚Äúfuck this group‚Äù, but it‚Äôs the message being read
it's related to the last tweet
what does it mean to "be exclusive"?
don't tag me, unless it's been a long time from my message
should be better than a rapist parent
If there is no abortion, also
And it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a male or female doing the thing
I say that the kid goes to foster care. Rapist isn‚Äôt parent material, like Chris said, and the other parent didn‚Äôt consent
What is a chaser?
Do you know why has she become hostile?
The problem is that misinformation leads them to believe that vaccines are the problem, not the solution
They probably do want to see their children live, but are just too stupid and misled to know better
And the close mindedness
I think that‚Äôs because of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt believe the government‚Äôs lies‚Äù
With all the ‚Äúmicrochips and autism‚Äù stuff included
I think public sex is illegal, so that‚Äôs a whole other deal
I would also like to ask what entails pda
I‚Äôm usually in my own little bubble when I‚Äôm outside, and I will recommend you do the same if it bothers you
Me, for example, I don‚Äôt go around paying attention to people, especially not looking after pda
If the people publicly displaying affection don‚Äôt mind the surrounding, why should the other people around mind what they‚Äôre doing?
I agree with the showing off part, but that would be directed at a specific person
to me it feels like that's a mentality of "I can't have this so you shouldn't either" and it is very bad
how so?
why do you hate it?
I don't think it controls anything, it's just prevalent
probably someone sends facebook your death certificate
Drawing conclusions only from what you see isn‚Äôt the way to go
Then there‚Äôs a problem with the single person and they should get help/knowledge
How does it reduce to that?
"don't come closer with the knife or you get shot"
the best defense is an offense
what is the kkk?
can we get the guillotine now?
and considering the role parents should take, it's even worse
from my experience with parents, that's giving too much credit to them
and also the problem of work + house chores
to me, looks like copper expressed the resentment really well
parents sure do paint the world gray

Also, if online friends could easily meet irl, you can bet they would
Internet makes it easier to communicate with people far away, so you find people who enjoy the same things easily, unlike irl
One thing to note is that online friendships are only online friendships because you live on opposite sides of the planet
what weird shit?
they do need an adult
I read that as "an internal adult", and while I did question my reading, I didn't question it very much
the logic does not apply, since it can affect adults and elderly. Kids will interact with their adults and the adults will go to other places infecting more and more people
what is 'cede'?
sounds like mental health
really good mental health talks and there's a plethora of subjects you can search on the channel
since I don't know your specific problem, I'll just recommend Dr. K
https://www.youtube.com/c/HealthyGamerGG
technically not permanent, but straying closer to being
from what I read, they are very likely to self perpetuate, especially with global warming
and if they agree to try, it can probably help you understand yourself better
to be honest, if the friendship is strong, you will stay friends even if they don't have feelings for you
is there a difference between lolicon and pedophile?
I don't know much about the body resisting tumors, so I can't comment, but please don't tag me, I am following the channel closely
precisely, if we let it happen we will end up with nothing
symbols, terms, words or whatever, even if it has to be slow
humans are not apples, we can take actions to stop the spoiling, aka we can fight to reclaim the symbols
because it is what enables the bad people to take over the other side
the mentality of "one bad apple spoils the bunch" needs to stop
indeed, this guy knows what's up
do watch the video, it's good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iflcK39wJ2M
most people don't know their walking speed
time is much better because you can plan around it
if you feel overwhelmed by the small problem and not by the flames, this could help

for sleep there's this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2RhXCugEW4
the meditation they do here is to get your mind to only focus on the meditation, it basically forces the focus because it's a balance meditation
I can recommend the end of this video, the meditation part
https://youtu.be/UUC8qF5iDag?t=6192
best of luck finding the group
sounds important, but your in-the-moment decisions don't have a good track record
what happened?
nothing weird about feeling that
people that act in movies are usually prepared to be very pretty
why did you get uncomfortable?
people find actors/actresses hot or not
given the lack of context, there seems to be no right or wrong
this doesn't look like a serious discussion
weird, thanks
what is FNDM?
because those are complete opposites
apart or a part?
doesn't look very serious
given the theme of this channel, when I saw the post I thought you were going to comment on the actual problem of the title, but instead you linked a comment of "you're bad" followed by "no you're bad"
venting is highly recommended with 1 person only on the other end
then it's not overworking, it's overwhelmed with waiting
so 1 hour total of commute
schools usually start at 8, right?
how much can you shave off?
if it's school for 12h 30min, ye you will have a problem
are you already in that situation or are you expecting to be overworked when it happens?
so I don't see how it is public
as far as I know, public is about being free to use and private being paid to use
don't you still have to pay to put your stuff in there?
what is shovelware?
You could try some dangerous hobby to be unstable
Not having to worry about making it to the next week/month/year is great
For some people, stability is all they want
a question for everyone here that has autism, would you rather not have autism?
no problem
for me, since I don't do speculation, it's just fuck it
so it either becomes speculation or "fuck it"
it really sucks because you can't even get closure, trying to know why they pulled away to know if you should try another strategy or something
if they cut communication, trying to communicate again will have the same result
moving on is the best option
people that ghost are the ones failing the communication
akin to ghosting, which is also absurdly common
something that could be happening is they are pulling away and not telling you why
a lot of people don't know how, I speak from experience
or they need too
that's one thing you could mention in the communication
then they're the ones not communicating well
further communication is establishing that you still wish to keep the friendship, even if they can't help
at the basic level, I think a "can I vent to you?" and "do you think you could try helping me with any of this?" after the vent can help a lot
relationships are usually ruined because people fail to communicate what they need
communication is the key here
do not tag when I'm here, I can see when a reply is made
because regular people aren't equipped to help with most problems, so you just gotta find the one
the latter would be just "keep trying", to eventually find someone that can help the right way
so kind of a loop in itself
the former would be tackling the problem of "getting help at getting help"
so, by observation, you think the result is "I can't be helped"
another possibility is that the people who tried before didn't know how exactly to help
I met someone like this on a certain game's community, and it surely does make people pull away
one possibility I think of is that you truly don't think you can be helped and in turn push away other people's attempts to help
when you say that nothing can be done to help, it certainly seems so at first glance
lending help is not a waste of time
are you just venting or do you want some help to come from the people here?
neither one or the other, I think
why are you apologizing?
if wanting and needing help is dramatic, I have lost sense of the word "drama"
but with this, it makes sense
you were tying hostile to controversy, me thinks
that's making assumptions, you will only know that if you ask them directly
if two people think differently and there is a space for them to discuss peacefully, that's nothing but perfect
I also don't see a problem with a space for controversy
friends or not, that's not my place to decide
if they are disagreeing peacefully, I see no problem
why would the world be fucked because of disagreement?
I don't see the problem on disagreeing without being hostile
you can also disagree without being hostile and dramatic
it's basically what I do here
and also without making friends
you can discuss really specific things without being hostile
that makes more sense
I used to have a friend group where I could just leave suddenly and people would be like "oh, that's just Yumi"
in certain groups, you don't even have to say "I'm leaving"
but also, irl, you don't have to say why you have to leave
which is why it feels easier to just stop talking, people don't know what you have to do irl
I don't think social media has different rules, just different expectations
Pressure doesn‚Äôt get to me
Nowadays, whenever I want to leave, I just tell people I‚Äôm leaving and that‚Äôs it
You can, but there is pressure that you don‚Äôt
please do not tag, I am following the messages
what are antis?
they don't mention the word "controversial", so I just take the face value that they mean hosility

What is a wojak?
that makes more sense now
looks like you agreed with Iski's point, just longer text
or sometimes "be 6' and fuck off"
tinder for guys is basically "be 6' or fuck off"
nah, I didn't see it as you implying it, you're fine
I'm all in for abortion
you can still have fun without worrying about babies
oh, I didn't mean types of prevention, more like anal and oral
you can still have sex, only one type is for conceiving a child
if you're gathering people for protection, that's not isolation
I think there is a misunderstanding of the word 'isolate'
isolating from toxic people is the wrong approach, you have to isolate them from society
if so, you can try learning about it from videos like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUrkfSzpt20
is it social anxiety?
akin to teaching any subject, it cannot be done in a quickly manner
takes a long time, yes
regular people are not equipped to deal with this, so get someone that is
your parents should take her to someone that can help with mental health
I never considered those as validation
because the only thing I can imagine is someone saying "I'm validating you" and I don't think that's it
actually, I need to ask, what form does the validation take?
what in not being validated makes you feel like shit?
maybe this interview has some thoughts you could use
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZXV0nNfdsw
I agree with Nevis and don't exactly understand what "I don't have a myself anymore" means
‚ÄúNo scawy things for my baby uwu‚Äù
‚ÄúNo scaring the player‚Äù
China is looking like a helicopter parent
I don‚Äôt want to be run over by ‚Äútechnically no one‚Äù because capitalism
I really do hope the government steps in to supervise driverless cars
So the average person is just gullible?
Shouldn‚Äôt someone know that?
In this case, it‚Äôs ‚Äúgetting sued because someone died‚Äù bad
If you release something bad, you lose
Doesn‚Äôt it work by selling good products instead of concepts?
That sounds like a terrible plan
Better to let everyone know that auto driving is not nearly ready
I‚Äôm trying to figure it out, why would they not want people to see the video?
What is the serious nature or overall context in this post?
Fair, the question is implied but I‚Äôll make it explicit
‚ÄúRandom character smoking‚Äù doesn‚Äôt look serious to me
I‚Äôm trying to understand the context from Copper as well
Is there a serious discussion to be had about this or is it just ‚Äúanother thing to smoke‚Äù?
What is a bong?
about the drone strike, don't people who decided it need to be arrested or something?
that's enough for me, thanks
so only tiny overlaps
like "domino effect" of incredibly distant?
is this all connected to the thing where people are killing each other for the "promised land"?
so I read this as "the government put the government in power"
I thought we were referring to the 'us government' as just the 'us'
I am confused about that answer
what is "authorization"?
are civilian deaths by drone strike not an act of war?
why isn't it up to other countries since it's affecting other countries?
I'm proposing to arrest the drone strikers
do people that decide drone strikes influence world economy?
because I hear about old people being shits
when are old people dying?
I'm wondering that too
and I'm also wondering why doesn't the UN or the entire world do something to stop the us
it's not about drone striking, it's about the us not giving a fuck about anything that isn't "kill bad guy"
is it not a crime if it's other citizens?
as long as the us thinks "let's kill 10 people to get 1 bad guy", I find it very likely for it to happen in its territory without drone striking
that's enough for me to not live in the us, don't want to fall under the umbrella of "might be a threat here"
what is a kerfuffle?
I'm appalled by "not as per us law"
when you kill 7 children because "it was a threat for sure" but not really, don't people come at you?
can't that kind of threat be taken to court?
Dr K has some interviews with people focused around impostor syndrome, if you guys want to check it out
Not everyone, I can confirm
how the fuck are people this stupid in 2018?
wait, I've seen this before and thought it was like pre-2000
or maybe they don't mind one mistake
if anything, they should be checking orders and contacting you
I don't think you can get in trouble for a mistake on their end
contact customer service and say what happened
what is subpoenaed?
money talks
I hope there's protection, but we know nothing will work
some humans have gone too far with technology
it's just pay cut, no positives
and it's not even "hey, camera dinged this so we would like to have you work better"
at that point you just quit the job, no discussion is worth it
"we will constantly monitor you (but not really) to decide your pay"
all the research people do about creating a better environment for workers so they actually work better and amazon pulls off this
I don‚Äôt want apple producing more idiot-port headphones
I hope that spreads to the rest of the world

what is deplatforming?
if they offer virtual learning, vaccination proof just dictates if you learn from home or not
what exactly in health privacy laws?
what would legally prevent them?
without proof, it's just free shit
your university looks Officially Dumb
It talks about suicide
Someone probably needs to watch this after this motivational speech about ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt get better‚Äù
https://youtu.be/AC3AmMIlNbw
for an example starter, if you're concerned about being seen as fragile, do you think you're fragile?
like seeing a professional, but unprofessional
I mean we can talk and see if the discussion can take you anywhere
but if you want, we can try something here
my first recommendation is seeing a professional
if that's your concern, there's probably something to be said about how you portray yourself/how your image is seen
considering all the social anxiety we have, probably the second
or they see themselves as a burden already and it's not specific to you
they think you are "too fragile" to deal with their problems or something (probably not the right words, someone help me here)
so I see two possibilities
and it doesn't matter how much you need to be helped, you can start helping people if you have the time for it
therefore, even the most helpful people need help
you can analyze that not one person has everything set up, everyone needs help with something at some point
one doesn't have to exclude the other
why is this serious?
happy to help
by the way, dr k is a very good source for understanding a lot of things about mental health
dr K explains it on this part of this interview
https://youtu.be/86JoC1PTmnE?t=2960
problems with identifying emotions
the other one, because of "I'm really not in touch with my emotions at all", is alexithymia
one is that you yourself wear yourself down on the attacks and someone else doing it only confirms them, makes me think of low self esteem
I have two thoughts
and what is a personal attack, for that matter?
why are personal attacks so strong on you?
oh, I understand now
I don't think that's the direction tesla is taking
I can see autonomous cars working around 1 or 2 rogue elements, but I think there will be a lot more
how little is that "few"?
that would be the utopia, but I don't think people will give up the ability to drive
what is the root issue?
do not tag me
if I was in the market for self-driving cars, I'd want to buy the one that has been thoroughly tested and that can prove it
but transparency is good
or is that only in games?
also, aren't beta testers supposed to break it in all the ways possible so you know what to fix?
a self-driving car that needs a beta tester sounds funny
ah yes, the privilege of having front row seats to the first ever AI car murder
do they not realize they are paying to work?
why would you ever pay to be a beta tester?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iflcK39wJ2M
because the first step of change is acceptance
have you accepted the cringe?
having the positive or negative answer will serve as a sample to analyze what is flirting and what isn't
but the only way I see to practice that is to literally ask someone "are you flirting with me?"
we are bad at understanding social cues, so it would benefit you to try and get better overall and not just flirting
that's where the problem comes from
you have autism, right?
what does it mean to default on it?
or is it like "eh, some day you can pay us" and they never pay
I need to ask, is student debt actually enforced to be paid?
Maybe some people really want to be friends with you but don‚Äôt know how to approach you
Communication is key
‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling not very friend with some people‚Äù and ask about their thoughts on it
I recommend saying that in the server itself
"Games can't distort facts", can we classify China as a game and delete it for saying gay people don't exist?
bad emotions attached?
but why do you not like it?
sounds and smells are very strong in emotions and nostalgia
not a serious topic
a bot that sometimes replies to a message
<@!807461216384712745> this bot?
I will add that being a good bean is already a special trait
You mean how they store the passwords?
Why won‚Äôt a password change help?
it's Texas, where *wouldn't* he get a gun?
what is the requirement lock?
good to know
so people say that giant corps should fix their shit up but people also behave as guinea pigs for them
and does windows not have a bunch of beta testers to test things out before launching dumpster fire to the public?
I wish for more people to see that fresh updates on anything comes out to total dumpster fire
my number one rule is "don't update until it's at last 1 year old"
I am appalled people actually update that fast
how old is windows 11?
if you got the time, something in here might help you

a whole ass talk about existential dread
there are definitely extrovert people and people who don't depend on technology, you'll need to search for them
I will agree with Armis, you'll live in this echo until you can achieve independency
I did, it's all verify@twitter.com
good, thanks
is there a twitter option to log out of all locations?
e-mail password is so old I don't even remember, I only login through authenticator
yes
e-mail is microsoft, therefore the authenticator
yet the password was still changed
nor did microsoft authenticator inform me of a login attempt
I didn't receive an e-mail to change password
but I'm concerned
so I changed it again immediatly
however, 55 minutes later someone managed to get in without the code (location in Istanbul) and changed my password
I received an e-mail about unusual login, but the e-mail said the login could only complete with the code in the mail
because someone just did it to my account
can you change a twitter password without access to the account's email?
1 hour talk on suicide by dr K
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC3AmMIlNbw
then the problem is approached already, by the group itself
so it's only one guy instead of "they", that you put there
what does that mean?
you can point it out or ask directly
still bad
there is no option for my problem and I can't send as another because it says they won't respond if it isn't related to the chosen option
apparently, the "Contact Us" section on twitter sucks
just enabled 2FA, thanks for reminding me
I will contact twitter support right now to know how the fuck does one change password without e-mail access
Agree, not dismissive
Asking people ‚Äúshould I worry about this‚Äù or related questions can help slowly help you by having them answer good things and chip away, little by little, the negative thoughts that you have
Not only worries, but also things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a good person‚Äù can be changed by hearing people say the opposite
Directly answering this, one way to learn is absorbing from other people
It takes time, but you‚Äôll get there
If anything, you‚Äôre learning more than a person who gets things right all the time
Learning from mistakes is actually more meaningful than otherwise
and educational games could be used to teach mental problems, so they would need to be added as mechanics
sometimes it's not for the fun
okay, less dystopia dictatorship in this chat
Probably better to read it
Start of convo is about ~130 messages earlier, with outside‚Äôs message
Matt, please explain
I also don't see Lectric expressing that
I'm not sure, I don't think you expressed fondness for an abuser
good
yes, agreeing in everything would be weird
and, like Fenny said, you can have disagreement without being mean
question is more directed to Lectric
what is this depth that comes out of being mean?
It'll do you better to think less about ideal worlds and realities where you are the supreme ruler
I do agree that schools have to do more about bullying, but you're 20 steps too far into revenge to be able to discuss this
"everyone is nice" but you choose to kill people?
Do not commit the tag
People that do give the second chance end up getting hurt again
A parallel example is cheating, you just don‚Äôt give a second chance to a cheater
It highly depends on what it was that you said to them, could be something that they‚Äôre extremely uncomfortable with
accepting that you did wrong is a good start
it'll probably bother you for longer
both go "wanna try mine?" and good things happen
but maybe person A gets drink 1 and person B gets drink 2 because of minor conflict
conflicts like war, hell yeah do be gone with those
you have to separate the two
a conflict could be as small as two people disagreeing on drinking the same thing
conflict gets people to think
conflict doesn't have to include abuse/being mean
the light hurts
I hope the light windows don't actually represent light
physical hugs, tho
I need hugs
and they are currently on the other side of the country
friends are unavailable, unfortunately
yes, but I don't think they will help this particular case
how do I recover from a shit day without an emotional support person?

I mean do not tag me
what is the content of the video?
I recommend you stop
DramaAlert is actually stopping and this isn't another drama post in disguise?
it's just not feasible to trial every user
anyone can go to any discord server and cause problems, there's no way to prevent that
I didn't point out a moderation problem, it's more of a global problem
I'm not wishing for a purity test, just pointing out the problem
I can agree with solopy, I feel the server is too open, allowing anyone to freely put stuff in this chat, making it unstable
this made me laugh, good one
he talks about talking about boundaries, which are very important in communication, mostly what I saw lacking on the Vyn-Matt interaction
good video from dr K about understanding people (title is a little weird)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bAEuX2w2Ow
I dislike the added difficulty in life, but I don‚Äôt blame it
chances are they sent someone masked and the person just took it off after leaving company premises
useful information: the rich people that "are christian" aren't actually christians
money is one of them
a lot of things guarantee you a spot in hell
what do they get from talking about it?
it's probably actually worse to not masturbate when you want to, because it will take up a lot of space in your mind and body
it essentially just gives you more time to do other things
there's no nirvana clarity or whatever it is that these people look for
as someone who had their random libido killed by hormone inhibitors (I think it's the inhibitors' doing), not masturbating for a month doesn't do shit
is it considered a holiday somewhere?
I also don't know the source of the anxiety
nothing is about to happen
as in "if I'm happy, why am I anxious?" or vice versa
never had this before
what does it mean when I'm anxious but happy?
you still say what you mean, but differently
so translating literally your irl speech to here will cause problems
I'd have to say "it's raining swiss knives" to get the same understanding in portuguese
think of it as translation between languages. If I say "it's raining cats and dogs" in english, people will understand that it's raining a lot. If I translate one to one to portuguese, people will most likely answer "the fuck you mean with cats and dogs"
if you're being perceived differently here than irl, there's something you need to do to be the same
quite the opposite, actually
you can use that to learn
we are here telling you that you were snarky, pointing out some specifics
you learn how
for example, I put extreme care into my messages to make sure they aren't bad
there, we are in agreement on this part
there is none in text, it makes it different to convey
also consider: tone of voice
might be the answer to why you're so snarky here
if you talk "amost one to one" as you do irl, there's something different
what misses in the "almost one to one"?
and passive agressive too
almost all the time
yes
when you say "I literally never said this" comes out as if the person is stupid for thinking you did or assuming or whatever
"I don't mean twitter tho"
if someone makes an assumption, you can explain what you mean instead of saying you didn't mean what they assumed
"I literally never said *insert anything here*" is just bad in general
the way you put something like "I literally never mentioned Twitter and was not even slightly talking about Twitter." comes out very bad
and you really could use less snark overall
if by "multiple people" you mean Maria, one person, I can agree
if he goes by the dictionary, that's fine by me
I'm actually searching for some sarcastic jokes you made in this channel to give them as an example
I don't make jokes on serious discussion
define "snide"
define "snarky"
let's go to another path
I'm saying our perceptions are different
no, I'm not implying that our definitions are different
I need him to give me an example of snarky so that I can then link to himself
if I did that, I would put his own messages, like I did yesterday
I'm asking what other people type that he considers snarky
it won't be an example from his messages, I know
do you have an example of what you think is snarky?
may I ask what did you mean it to sound like?
I don‚Äôt think being rebellious for the sake of being rebellious exists, there‚Äôs always a reason behind it
Venting might not be okay in this channel, it‚Äôs better if you make an effort to make it a discussion, like how to approach the little brother or something
and also ask others to express more or differently
we need to express a lot to start understanding others
because being on the same wavelength isn't natural
yes, there are some cases where absolutes are better, but most of the time they're not
and that's an autism problem, we default to absolutes
you need to be less absolute, it'll help you
I also see that you're thinking in absolutes. "I need to be absolutely direct" or "there is absolutely no other way to be direct"
it'll take you a lot of time to notice, looks like
you don't notice, but we do
so you need to understand when you are unintentionally snarky
seems like you don't understand because it's too "normal" for you
but you send so many of these that I think it's leaking into your normal messages
exactly

examples:
do you recognize that you make a lot of sarcastic jokes in this channel, Matt?
It would only get easier if there was no attachment, which isn‚Äôt the point of having a pet
"once they stop being lazy, they'll do good in school"
that's what most family members get wrong, "once we stop their addiction, they'll be fine"
I'll say that addiction/apathy/laziness are not causes, they are symptoms
that's an important point
it is intentional
but the wording is exactly as it should be
I can explain if someone wants me to explain, preferably zmand
if your focus is only getting her to do homework, you're doing it wrong
I will doubt hard that you and your family have tried everything
you don't brute force solve any of these, you need to know the root cause
does this mean NFTs are literally illegal now?
You can also tell your mutual friends these concerns and that you‚Äôre not gonna talk to this person anymore
I want to add a perspective here: if someone was faking something, wouldn‚Äôt they just lie and say ‚Äúyes I have a diagnosis‚Äù? Can this person ever find out if you‚Äôre lying about having a diagnosis?
what does fungible mean?
there is no point
and unfortunately people are very prone to support hype
do not tag
so if someone only gets enjoyment from card games, there is no other option than a computer
exactly
and multiple copies of them as well
you'd need all the cards of a game like hearthstone printed out to actually play hearthstone irl
like card effects that summon random cards
you can also recognize that video games can do random effects much better than board games
time to see wumpus as nft
there's no "I know it and I hate it" option
correction, buying/selling the receipt of a pixel art
I will not put people past buying/selling pixel art for millions and billions of dollars

unfortunately, that is entirely possible
If the dislikes aren‚Äôt shown before you click on a video, they don‚Äôt seem very useful for measuring if you want to watch the video
%
What is 90pct?
90 what?
Then I‚Äôm saying being public is useless
I think public is what GoRider meant
If you have 1k likes and 10 dislikes, there is no clue why people disliked it, you need proper feedback from comments
Like and dislike only show feedback if one is way bigger than the other
cool
we could use less sarcasm on serious discussion
thank
oh, I thought the actual spelling was segway
what is a segue?
so names are not relevant reminders?
sounds terrible to me
what I hear is "I'll place you as a minor statistic and find reasons to say that your wish is unreasonable"
your points being?
it's like nobody actually reads
you usually take terrible paths of thought about consequences, so I'll tell you to steer clear of those
be nice
do not tag
or else what?
seems like you still need years of professional help
do you actually want to discuss?
how much professional help have you gotten?
I predict that it doesn't
let's see how much that helps
ah yes, tumblr tags on discord

and would people listen to the media saying "vaccines work" when professionals said the same thing and it didn't work?
so talking about what should be done would probably end up in people just not consuming the media, in that train of thought

Because my understanding is that the body goes in a coma to avoid very bad days, conserving energy and taking time to repair
Nothing dark just sleeping in or being in a coma, at most
What makes a bad day better than a missed day?
You‚Äôll get to a better day on both options
my question was more general, not about this situation specifically
what is "the whole thing"?
is it better to live a bad day or to not live a day?
addiction to dopamine rush, which companies have been exploiting for quite some time
As far as I know those are mutually exclusive
is it strange and normal?
mathematically proving that any legal job is better than that
minimum wage gives more than that
also, as far as I have seen, headsets are still too shaky
when *that* is properly made, we might step into "too advanced" territory
haptic feedback technology still has ways to go
not too advanced at all
there are some videos that help you see weird colors just by manipulating your eyes
what exactly is it?
that's some morbid curiosity
people don't give 10 seconds of thought and just click stuff
also, the overall speed addiction going around the world has made scams more viable
seems like just people giving out, discord post says "goal of posing as Discord in order to obtain personal information or money"
happens everywhere
hence people being bad at their own mother language
because "you don't need to study if you were born with it"
because there isn't much teaching going around in schools
the rest are very susceptible to anything
those who migrated are less naive
those who can't get into it (mostly old people), those who migrated to it in the early stages and those who were born with it
I remember once someone talked about three groups of people relating to digital technology
it's mostly naivety
It‚Äôs not a curiosity, it‚Äôs a need

I've seen that in a few comic books

rain doesn't cut me
for me it makes as much sense
which, for some reason, means it's raining a lot
one we have here is "it's raining swissknives"
but regardless of language, expressions usually don't make sense
still doesn't make sense why you'd say "wear the heart"
what is "a lady's favor"?
yes
I cannot link those two together
the fuck does that mean
like this one
while some questions are very hard, others are very on point
an ambiguous test for autistic people doesn't sound very good
that makes more sense
oh, I thought you were apprehensive of something happening after it went through
I didn't get it yet, why are you apprehensive?
Makes sense to not let pathogens get freed by random bullets or explosions in the middle of a war

Got a link?
something about discounting tax pay
I don't know about where you are, but here we get government help to go to therapy
money may be a gatekeeper, but everyone needs help
and wanting to improve alone only works on specific contexts
regular people are not equipped to deal with their own stuff
do you get professional help for that?
ideally get both
unless the government there is fucked up in the head, it's better to get therapy than games
I recommend thinking for at least 5 seconds before sending a message
And punishing yourself for learning is really fucked up
It‚Äôs ok to make mistakes, the mind even learns better from mistakes
You have a strong case of not forgiving yourself, you say again and again that you want to punish yourself, be it now or in the past
every step of the process can be done with help
if needed, ask for help for looking into it
gotta start somewhere
but if you can, try it out
I only heard of it recently, so I can't give a good opinion
you have something going on in your mind that you don't like, and, unless you're a professional in that field, you can't solve it yourself
that you look into it
my psychologist does remote, should it be needed, for example
if physical limitation is the case, you can get online professional help
has he firmly told you that?
why this limitation?
if they worry about you, they probably worry more if you're not getting help
how's that professional help going?
I do think mostly in english and I'd rather speak it more, but very few people here know it well
learned english so much that I feel like it's a second native language
all three of them sound completely different, very recognizable
portuguese/english speaker and learning japanese, portuguese as native
since text doesn't have tone of voice or expression, you may need to add a few words to let people know that you don't mean bad
there are some things you can say to make it easier to learn, like prefacing things with "hey, I don't know if it's the right thing to say, but I think this"
that's a reasonable fear
also people have different boundaries, the way you talk right with one person may be completely wrong with another
there's really only one way to know how to talk, and that is by talking shit and then learning
what makes you say that?
which is generally bad
that's an absolute statement about therapists
and, in the end, you will still be the one doing the work to fix it, because they can't do it for you or force you to do it
ultimately, your thoughts are biased, a third party will analyze without bias
they can help you think about and dissect better
do you think that won't happen if you get help for it?
what does pride do for you?
what makes you feel like you can solve it?
For quite some days you have come back and again to say the same things, and that would mean you aren‚Äôt making progress
Also, ‚ÄúI can potentially work through‚Äù isn‚Äôt your best argument
The mathematical interpretation of that would be $16,25/week, and that sounds cheap
You discarded it without even making sure of the value
It‚Äôs good to make sure of it
is this $65 for all 4 weeks or $65 per week for 4 weeks?
And that is being exiled
If fear of being exiled still won‚Äôt bring you to get help, I think there‚Äôs only one thing that may do it
Being angry at small things at work won‚Äôt be a good experience
Do consider getting therapy to help you not be angry before getting a job
they'll just be an extra braincell
works for everyone
"I decided you are to blame, so you are to blame without evidence"
no, unfortunately that's just standard managing procedure
you just can't communicate the problems efficiently
I think getting the "free upgrade" makes you a worse beta tester
more on this here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iflcK39wJ2M&t=1s
and regret isn't acceptance, so it leads to not solving issues
the first step to change is acceptance
and people seem to focus on that so much that they don't work to fix the problem, akin to "if it doesn't happen, I don't need to fix it"
as I understand it, regretting is wishing that whatever happened never actually happened at all
I feel like regret is usually a problem
how do you define 'expression' and 'communication' to separate the two?

if windows explorer isn't running, you don't see anything
windows explorer, not internet explorer
not having even a task bar could be that
is windows explorer running?
you're a good bean
no
but I never tried doing it, so I don't have any feedback on it being good
since we can sometimes just shut down, they would serve as backup communication
like your example, a smol paper saying "I'm overwhelmed, I'm not ignoring you"
the next thing I'll say is not professional knowledge, but I always think about carrying papers that say specific things
very few people in the room, sometimes just 2 or 3, including the teacher
you can probably find some, I had a great one when I was 13-17
also, there is the option of taking an english conversation course
directly asking will likely get you that feedback, which seems you need
"if that makes sense" is more reserved than "does that make sense?"
since you put it in a way that isn't direct, you may not be getting enough feedback to learn more
I use that a lot when I'm teaching, to see if people around me are picking up what I'm putting down
asking if things make sense is a good conversation skill
Denial is one of the steps
But if you talked and nothing came of it, there isn‚Äôt much to guess
Good communication will get you that info
When you lose someone, you grieve
Since they don‚Äôt seem to care much about you anymore, it‚Äôs like you lost them
Mourning your loss
If that‚Äôs the case, then grieving is the next step
Have you communicated this to them?

I've seen computer talk here back and again, what is there about it that makes it a serious topic?

ah, I usually refer to that as energy or mana
I don't think something will happen that will change my mind about leaving family once I can
that's my goal, and I'm getting there slowly
spoon theory?
bad people are bad people
that's where I don't fit, family means nothing to me
I just don't fully feel the latter because parents still give the light of the day to these bad people
I already don't talk to them anymore after a certain incident about rape jokes
the rest of father's family side is also pretty homophobic and sexist
accepting any thoughts on this
maybe both
so I don't know if it's good or bad that they didn't
my two immediate thoughts were
1: they haven't accepted enough to tell the rest of the family
2: it's my father's homophobic and sexist mother
but, today, when my father's mother was here, she addressed me by birth name
mother has been calling me mostly Yumi
my parents haven't shared with the extended family that I'm trans
I got a situation that I would appreciate some help thinking about it

very different situations, but mine has a program to help students
I don't know how far the idea will go, but maybe you can find something for free in universities
are you with a therapist as of now?
it's off
so here I am to say that you aren't wrong
it takes some time to get the perception that you aren't wrong, and people can help you do that
society does that to people
The whole system has to change before we get actual special ed
One teacher can‚Äôt take proper care of 30 neurotypical students, even 1 being special ed makes it unfeasible
However, the lack of investment in, at least, a second teacher in the classroom makes it almost useless
Special ed is supposed to be like that high school experience of yours, everyone in the same class but each person at their own pace
some suck less than others, and Europe has a lot of different places, answers will differ
Also don‚Äôt tag
If you know what‚Äôs on the news, you do
Most of it is just tragedy and death
I do recommend not watching the news if that‚Äôs your experience

also recursive
also didn't define "being on the same page"
recursive argument
Define ‚Äúthings at times‚Äù
I see people saying back and again that the world would suck without disagreements but they never say how it would suck
I want to ask for the definition of ‚Äúbeing on the same page‚Äù and ‚Äúthe world would suck‚Äù
Money do be gatekeeping a lot
‚Äú-What we have is good.
-I agree.
-How about this thing that can be better?
-I can also agree on that, let‚Äôs try.‚Äù
Fenny got the same point as me, we don‚Äôt need conflict to move forward, just creativity
if you are this angry about, I won't comment further
what question does that answer?
Self understanding is good, I just don‚Äôt feel it fits the topic at hand
Because it seems to be that it takes one to understand another
Pairs as in other autistic people
So, for any other autistic folks out here struggling to be understood, I‚Äôd say to look for pairs
Besides my psychologist, I only have one person that fully understands me (friend for all my life) and one that is understanding more gradually (friend for 12 years)
I‚Äôll also share that sometimes I feel the same as her, neurotypical people just don‚Äôt seem to understand at all, except those that graduated on something that involves learning about autism (like psychology)
I‚Äôll try reaching her, thought I had her added already
I was about to reply to Ella, but looks like she left
I was about to ask about EU too
so you either get paid more or your have less time at work because commuting is part of the job
if it's in the US, isn't there something about the commute time being part of your work time?
Is there a precedent to abortion?

therefore, you become a light sleeper, having restless sleep and being very prone to wake up because of the slightest stimulus
that is precisely what stress does, makes your body more alert
Don‚Äôt even start
Also Greenland
North america isn‚Äôt only the united states
Also wrong
Can‚Äôt ever say I‚Äôm american and get a proper question of ‚Äúwhere in america?‚Äù back
Poisoned an entire continent with that
Saying ‚Äúamerica‚Äù to refer to the united states is the worst
do replace that with golden beads or a calculator
very counterintuitive
an abacus in 2022?
Neutral news
I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs just expected
what is trads?
mind you, sexist on the men's side
having a sexist grandmother does things
that just sounds normal to me
Isn‚Äôt 2024 too much time to do that?
Not just some guy, he plays The Flash

Apparently it‚Äôs money that expires
I saw a post about this in another server
making up scenarios isn't a good way to debate
kill guns
so I'd rather not leave the possible shooting there
also, from the words of Dr K from healthygaming, you can't ever know if a person is fully fixed
fix society, sure, but guns still have to be taken away
what is the end point of your argument?
and that is a lot better
school shootings won't happen with knives
well, you can't take people away, so guns it is
takes a lot more effort to do that tho
should we blame objects that are made for killing when they are being used to kill? I'd say yes
searching gynosexual gave me this pdf

I know gynosexual is attraction towards women, independent of your identity
wrong chat?
the tweet makes it sound like it goes for everywhere
is it only about military?
since the pentagon thing
I'm not understanding the words
can someone explain this to me like I'm 7?
I'd rather not refer to it as the entirety of america
then the system is very dumb
how is it illegal in any way if it was protected?
that makes less sense
that sounds stupid
so you can't trust any federal protection because they could retroactively fuck you over?
so much for "united"
now I see it's up to the states to decide
I thought that the overturn made abortion flat out illegal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVk7D4pwlfU
Imagine not knowing what you‚Äôve done when you did it for the last 3 hours
isn't it a good thing to know this?
is it normal for teenagers to be in the fbi list?
And I‚Äôll request it to be explained, if it exists
Updating myself, I feel like there‚Äôs a bad implication
I feel like there‚Äôs an implication in your phrasing, but I can‚Äôt understand it
still bad
yes
I got the word ||rape|| today and I don't know how to feel about it
should non-english websites worry about english words in their captchas?
what law enforcement requires that?
I'm more curious about the part of "law enforcement purposes"
can you talk seriously or are you just memes?

Can they really deport people for having abortions?
And what‚Äôs with questioning people on abortion?
First she was transiting, now she is IT-ing, truly a wonderful job
speaking as someone who is mostly an outsider, I do not see any tangible gain in pretending to like doing something
doing something only to fit in is not going to lead you to a good mental place
therefore, no one specific is required to answer
since this is a public server, most posts aren't directed to someone specific
I'll offer a perspective
Will take a look at it, thanks again
I‚Äôve got some skills on that, have been reading up on a language called rust
Oh, programming?
Lila?
Data analysis sounds nice, thanks
Any kind is fine, I wanna see it all
Does anyone know job recommendations for someone who‚Äôs good at math? (No teaching children/teens)
looks like they're more worried about your health than a vacation, which is good
can he still be elected? like can he take the job with such a crime in his record?
Murderer vs thief, is what people were calling it
It went from terrible president to bad president

who here liked Dragon Maid?
wassup nerds
it is indeed 5 times cuter
I have watched the available gotobun episodes
Overlord
in portuguese, 8000 sounds better than 9000
they are still summoned, aren't they?
Mmmm yes
I watched that one
Kaos-chan?
thanks for the recommendations, I shall try all of them
I'm looking for something not music related, but I'll try it
like teenagers going to school, falling in love but no drama, preferably
does anyone have recommendations for cute anime where things go fine?
preferably soft and light
I need gay in the girl direction
is this true?
promare looks very action oriented and plot heavy
watched Sakura Trick and Kase-san already
can I get some Very Gay‚Ñ¢Ô∏è recommendations?
I shall be back for more in about 2 months
found some more good things on google
looks very gay, but not into light novels
thanks much
yes, manga works too
too much drama and heavy plot on my life already
I need more of this to exist
adashima is on my list already
thank
anyone knows the anime that this gif is from?
https://tenor.com/view/hug-cuddle-anime-cute-anime-hug-gif-18960633
they better do
gonna start looking for spoilers if nothing happens on episode 2
it's just bad
there wasn't even a singular one of these
and nothing
I just kept pressing forward on the 12th to see if there was anything
and I spent 11 episodes waiting for the very gay
I literally search "very lesbian animes" on google and this was one of the results
I feel like I've been baited
adachi to shimamura was not worth it
GOOD GOD
thank
you know any more?
even if it was just once, I regret it
some serious gay
<@!171395487247630336> you did me a major solid with that recommendation
what's wrong with aoi yuki being popular?
what is cgdct?
do not tag
I have been seeing a lot of gay art of it lately
is K-On gay?
any gay?
girl isekai? üëÄ
thank
is volume the same as chapter?
I guess I'll try the manga then
good stuff
Hana ni Arashi is looking pretty gay on chapter 2 already
sad
the last on the list is 151, but a few pages in there's 400 something
I am confuzzled with the number of chapters
which one?
read the gay
looks like it's time for a re-read
volume 4 chapter 47, me thinks
that is from 2 years ago
OH YES THE NEXT CHAPTER IS BETTER
this page is great
the power move tho
probably spoiler for Hana ni Arashi
*again*
they're being socially pressured to spend time with everyone instead of alone with each other
damn it
should I read or watch it?
what is mature drama?
is that true?
I've been told yagakimi has drama
heart would be very warm if I didn't have so many troubles right now
caught up with Hana ni Arashi
sounds like bad
no interest, but still part of the story?
the panel looks gay, but I'll probably ride on Fenny's words too
the only major thing in adashima was shimamura's density
what be that?
it doesn't say if it's gay :C
Maple will find a way
bofuri 2? <:KirikaFish:717138469381734471>
what's the difference?
wha
not gay?
does Tanya count as female protagonist?
what is abo?
oh god

gear is the last music anime I watched
not enticing for me
is healer girl a music anime?
it's something to watch, which I'm running out of
I'll try executioner
sad
girl gay btw
is there any gay anime this season?
oki, ty
or just partially?
||so the locked memories couldn't even be accessed when they connected in episode 6?||
don't they both know? ü§î
episode 7 made me confused
I like visuals
I don't think it'll do for me
ah, this is what a light novel is
never read a light novel, me thinks
how do I go about reading it?
will there be more anime of it?
and way better too
executioner's lore is a lot deeper than I expected
got recommended My Next Life as a Vilainess, it berry good
What be this?
what is this best otome isekai?
around those lines, yes
is there anything similar to My Next Life as the Villainess?
thanks for the recommendations, I'll try some of them
yes
bery cool
finished the first season of pecorine
Are we getting season 3 or a movie next?
She has to get through Geordo first
read it multiple times
what's happening with tokyo mew mew?
Ash will be ||the next pandemonium sacrifice||
kek, google search returns illegal site before crunchyroll for citrus
cool
now I understand step relatives more
or is that half sibling?
as far as I know, stepsiblings share one parent
do they share genes?
so it's not actual incest
because that's what domestic girlfriend does
or is it just parents (re)married, no blood relation?
bound by blood
true stepsisters?
or is it like domestic girlfriend?
is that true?
I've read citrus features incest
any more gay anime lying around to be watched?
miss me with that
schools confiscating phones hits too close to home
bitch deadass talking about being a good girl wearing a fucking umbrella on her head
with the school? everything
with them? I have no idea
went on to watch spy x family, much better
ok, citrus successfully pushed me away with only half of the first episode
I hope I can agree on the treasure part
I don‚Äôt know either of those
Rental girlfriend didn‚Äôt do it for me
Then I‚Äôll give it a shot
Is the Kaguya-sama anime cute?
Hello
I wouldn't call it cute, but it's definitely interesting
watched 3 episodes of kaguya-sama so far
Ty
It‚Äôs kinda weird
Are princess principal episodes ||in random chronological order?||
I'll try it
I did watch dragon maid already
girls und panzer is the tank one, right?
what's good on cute girls animes?
princess principal was really good
I have come to ask for more recommendations
hello
isn't it Bloo?
I don't remember the bunny's name, but he's got the same aura as the inspector from spy x family
I still remember the scene where he was signing a crap ton of papers and he was signing "Bloo"
instead of Blu
cool
it's on netflix?
what is it called?
that's what I meant :v
dungeon run?
**be purged**
*Too soon*
and a spell that fully heals and draws 5 cards
he got that double double life twice :v
he's the boss now, I guess
<@!127644949884698624> while you got all your cards burned, my cousin did this
hers is "Zero" power
hero power won't work if yogg kills you <:GWshizuWanISee:395626868944142347>
then heal, yes
or are you planning to trade with your face every time?
do your minions have decent health?
are you Tess?
is it up to 8 bosses as dungeon run?
THE COMMUNIST DRUID
we're setting camp here
get the food
what does it do
<:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>
>69 attack Kingsbane
>underwhelming
<:GWshizuWanISee:395626868944142347>
is that a 0 cost echo oil
no charge for hunter <:GWqlabsCatGlareSip:398950916960550912>
just blow his board
I bet that one with the cannon
AAAAAAAAAAAA
4 TIMES
9 mana summon 7 minions that died this game
how can I defeat this crap
get everything related to cannons
noice
do you play pvp alot?
<@!127644949884698624> are u a hearthstone addict
<:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>
Tyler1 tier A
Because things like kai‚Äôsa and non-standard builds happened
Their main point was dealing physical damage, but that is no longer true
The problem with ad carries is over-tuning their abilities
and IE change
also the upcoming item
8.9
*balance?*
are you seeing this
anyone here plays league?
that's so bad
lemmesmash
what is that?
Ah, that card
Which one is worgen greaser?
Freezing is also annoying as shit
And blizzard keeps making cards that sustain it :u
Exodia has set roots in standard
As long as exodia mage never comes back, I‚Äôm fine
I blame blizzard <:GWossuKannaSip:395627468276367370>
Even with 3 expansions per year
Hearthstone took forever to change the meta game
I'm back
My internet is dying and choir practice starts now, I‚Äôll be back later
It was annoying as shit
I support patronless warsong commander
What do you guys think of rush?
Just asking :v
What‚Äôs the weapon‚Äôs mana cost?
Cubelock still lives
Nah
But now hunter is dead
Wot
Oh
I don‚Äôt remember such card
Healbot? :D
Turn one druid yeti
All these filler cards would be awesome if the game was just classic and basic cards
The truest pack filler
I think you can call this a top down shooter
uuuuuhhhhhhhh
does anyone play Zombie Assault 4?

remember when runners were exploding?
which is disgusting
that's standard marketing in games
I just need a recommendation on the last Zerg upgrade on Raynor's campaign
any starcraft 2 player around?
Yes, Malorne

Also
Like the druid legendary that goes back to your deck
As far as I remember, reincarnate doesn‚Äôt work with that type
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/159020861708435457/473885623334469632/unknown.png

blizzard is getting lazy
one thing I have just noticed
can't even count voltron
does any mech have that?
it's a good setup card
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/159020861708435457/473853824935788554/186a9bafeb90c16039d900a45a50782d.png
Another one
Sprint that tutors? :v
But there‚Äôs that new card that reduces cost by 7
At least that
Is aviana + kun still standard?
Blizzard knows no limits
Remember shudderwock?
Where‚Äôs the bingo
Aka pack fillers, powercreeps and completely unbalanced cards
All the missing cards
Today will be the final reveal
By that time, druid probably has 55 mana and 7 10/10 on the board
Or a 5 mana 5/5 that draws secrets, at the most basic zombeast
Could become a 6 mana 5/5 charge that draws secrets
And it‚Äôs a beast
Hunter might do it
Not anymore
Rogue isn‚Äôt running this either
Because it‚Äôs more opportunities it‚Äôs not going to have
Neutral only makes it worse
And the fact that almost no one plays 5 secrets anymore
Compared to mysterious challenger
This card is actually bad
pagles are everywhere
but then you'll need a good legendary roll
easily spammable and discarded
could do with murlocs and totems
the way it's worded, it should only be the board
it's face or fall
rexxar doesn't have plans :v
we have to see if token shaman will survive
shaman already has a collection of the strongest cards in the game
consider this is a shaman card
however
so you can still have spells to back up the randomness
the difference being this doesn't affect spells
shit's too good
turn 3 kappa the board to americas
this looks like a better sacrifice than discard
I don't think you care about an 8 mana secret in your hand when you have a 1 mana 10/10 tirion with blessing of kings on turn 5
1 mana tirion
you could exchange a secret for a tirion
how could it be the opposite? :v
it can also speed up a good card in favor of another
draw 4 cards?
wot
https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/nSZ04UjGN_dOi4f3Y8N623P1typu1t6J-zC6c9YarAA/https/media.discordapp.net/attachments/159020861708435457/473928624031137795/prisma.png
And he will combo your ass
Druid has 20 high cost minions in his hand
Oh, it has way more oh shit factor
Oh shit factor?
Thaurissan? Never heard of it
It‚Äôs a minion that gives a stupid value instantly
<:GWqlabsKek:393085130219978752>
which one is your case? :v
rng in competition is demise
rng in fun is fun
and is a better card
here's a common that does the exact same thing
legendary cards? fuck that
fucking shit, blizzard
