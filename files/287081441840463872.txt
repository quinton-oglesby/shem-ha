Hello!!!! <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>

i think this is more for actual child porn rather than everyones precious lolis anyway so i think yall are safe
le shrug though
lol i wouldnt go to mental disease but its fucked up non the less
personally i dont think child pron is artstic freedom. Now not all "lolis" are meant to be sexual. But I think this U.N thing is going to focus more on _actual_ child porn that isn't "lolis"
well, i can see why they might say this. but i reaaaaaaaallllllly doubt this is gonna ecompass loli. plus lolicon is often child porn so taking neseceray precuations isnt wrong. Do I think this will work? no
give the horny people what they want
blocking the whole thing???????????? ouch
im fine with like......blocking the nip and something bc i expect that but also..............
whats the point in having that if you're gonna block almost all of it
some censorship is fine but like..........whaaaaaaaat
wow that censorship is........much
"here we attempted to mass genocide you and drove you off your land heres some salmon and wood!"
lol japan "recognzing" ainu as idegenious people just for a good name for the olympics
would buy the 1/7th scale bikki figure
