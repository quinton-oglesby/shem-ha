Hmm what can we call these emote candidates tho
oh well
:(
just a suggestion
but hey
probably ain't gonna happen
Hmm...how bout multiple colours for usernames?
So what
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Aside from that?
Scroll up to see
What do you think about my candidate
Hmm
Is that Kirika one a new emote?
Wait
Guess that's a deal
Okay
<@99695384296701952> <@106866895076003840> what do you two think?
The whole screenshot?

I think I have another emote candidate
Hmm
<:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
--ship pen apple
Or
--ship Hibiki Miku
So example
Tho what could it do
I mean maybe
Some merit
Yay
gosh darn it I can't make good emote suggestions
So more of a neutral face?
Like :GarieAngry: or something
Now what to potentially call this...
Hmm
Thx mate
I went with something a bit more unique
Eh
I'm possibly thinking of this...
Now I'm thinking of a Garie candidate...
Hmm
Thought I could've made two new emotes today...
(sigh)
Yes it is
Yes
MEME GALORE
oh well
(sigh)
Yes
Scroll up
Yes
My candidate is a no-go then?
I called the Ghostbusters
Uh no
Doesn't really work that way either...
Eh
Damn it Basa
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Cocoa Beans
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Thx
I understand
Okay
Idk
At least I sent emote candidates with high potential...?
Well
I just kinda want to contribute to the server
Why can I not do this
I can't come up with anything else that can work
Darn it
Oh
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498> already exists in the same screenshot but I'm testin to see if Basa could work too
Imma try one final thing
Hmm
Nothing really can work here I found...
I also tried experimenting with something from this screenshot
Doesn't really work well...
Here's one of the tests
They just don't work
I also tried experimenting with a couple OVA screenshots
But it might not as an emote
I want to believe this could work
oof
yeah it looks too similar to those
I so badly want to call it 9ball now
So I'm out
I am a creative person for art but not for names or anything
Who wants to take the fish to the grill then
Hmm
<:Znombu:701464491132453034>
Then what bout this
Good question
True true
Possibly
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
For some reason I'm getting dizzy from looking at it
Oh lord
Looks like she about to hurl
This is gonna be a spiral of planning isn't it?
Oh lord
This was his master plan
Rady planned this all out
Naw
how
nice
So emotes are like MMOPRG characters now?
A vents channel would be one that've have to be maintained almost 24/7
Yeah
That sounds pretty good
I suppose in the end there's not really a clear cut perfect solution
We don't want a person's vent to go too far
But at the same time
We wouldn't stop her
I'm still not quite sure myself
Well...
Larger channels cannot due to larger number thus more ways for many to interfere and distort the vents
Smaller channel can work with vent channels because there are less people hence less of singularity
Yeah
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Careful bout what you say
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Now off to hopefully lighter suggestions (emotes)
Good
We good?
Okay
I can't see
Oh whoops
NanaPog
Then somebody gotta boost it at least once
Oh no
It doesn't really express anything
Hell ya
I can see someone using this Ayahi face for the "Dame Da Ne" meme
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Somebody pull up before the ship crashes
That increases competition more tho
Competition is necessary for growth
We sacrifice one Kiri for another
Even if that murder is to a newborn
A murder is necessary to allow the rising of a species
We gotta sacrifice one
So which one
Good biki
That a lot of handmade edited emotes
Holy mama mia
Kirika is incomplete without Shirabe
Let the fish partners prosper
Ignore what Rad said
Do it
I think the chew is fine
Naw
Yeah the timing looks about just right
So at the speed of light
It's even harder to time it just right
You know animation takes hard work right
> Excuse me strimmer, actually there are 5 drawn frames
I was talking about *keyframes*
I think with only 3 drawn frames it's a bit difficult to tell if this feels natural yet fast enough
> A state of war has existed between the Blimpans and Mattian Empire.
This is what's happening
A state of war has existed between the Blimpans and Mattian Empire.
She already has it covered
> I will pay money to have Matt smacked with chair
You don't need to pay her
> Melua I will pay you money not to add more DMJii
This is a declaration of war
You have just triggered the Rady blimp nation
Uh oh
!!!
Naw I think the bite frame on the first one's too fast
I'd say the second one feels more natural
I meant after she nommed the cake
I mean I could say I'd slow it down before the chewing
Sometimes speeding up is all you really need
Try to speed up on the first frame so more time is for the mouth opening
Although I would say for Phanta
You could just use three or four frames for that sped up version and there'd hardly be a difference
I mean
But that's just what I think in terms of timing
So I could be wrong
I'm no Miyazaki or Shinkai
No thank you 🛡️
> I'm gonna punch you
Who?
Not a phoenix
He's a blimp
Petting nice
<:KirikaPanic:644235681677180958>
Discord is breaking
Is this turning into an episode of Shark Tank?
uh oh
That and Discord seems to be glitching out or something
Oh wait...
Even more god than Game Master God?
...yeah definitely too minor to include
Yeah...
Yeah I had an inkling just wanted to make sure
....no I'm not?
We discussed it in <#357682999300718592>
Cocoa is now put on Red Alert
It will ||cost your goddamn life by even merely suggesting that||
I can tell you
Do it
Her
Yes
> Based
Base based
Fish is nice but a full seafood diet is not too healthy
Yeah maybe cut down on the fish
I can half Rad come to you with his legit green
Oh wait
And no I'm not talking about the blue-green
I can at least spot you in those colours
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Come the hell back here Ooga Booga
We must put a stop to his ambitions
~~Everyone let's dive in~~
What should we sacrifice?
Good point
Now we need to see if enough people want this to be an emote
That's pretty good
Ayy
Yeah I thought this one looked pretty good (probably too obscured by all the text tho)
That they think Kirika works from 9 to 5?
Where's the Dur da Bla?
Aight that's it
Is you sacrifice Chris the next thing that'll happen to you will be that your face is gone
Imagine whaling on Discord
> Our emotes are so good they give you choice paralysis. <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Apparently not my friend when I showed him some
I blame DMJii for making Discord go to its limit
~~SHE WINKS AND STARES INTO YOUR SOOOOUUULLL~~
Wait you complete the joke
It's time to
Winkrabe
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I feel it's a bit too similar to this
Dunno
Hmm
There is *never* a thing known as "too much Zenbu"
Probably because Rider x Gear fics are *extremely* common
~~Banish DMJii fans~~ <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
That's kinda what <#377148557796442134> is for
That actually sounds good as a name
I put the file as KirikaSad
This is shrunken down so that it could fit emote size

So I would like to suggest an emote candidate of a GIF I made earlier today (either for the main server or the emote server)
Heyo
Shocking
No objections here
Thx
Looks like an expression when you pleading for somethin
Let's go KirikaPlead
Hmm
<@!99695384296701952> Is this good?
Anyways
Probably was leaked in here
Must be that Anti-Linker
Y'all gettin confused
KirikaPlease
Let's go with that
Yeah
(at least from what I've seen)
There's also the fact that there are a lot less active artists than writers here
Also I feel like the prompt thing works more for writing
Maybe
I mean
I think he's asking for server invite <@192432957946855424>
Ah so Chrisnein is canon now
That ain't her forehead tho
~~Wouldn't it be better on Miku's?~~
The bane of all adults
Children are evil
I think we're safe for now
Not at the moment I don't think
I'd be down for it
Yeah
Wait did we check if those would actually fit the channels
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
I am not a leader or a good ruler by any means
Do not choose someone with slight mental instability (like me)
Welp crap it's spreading
Or perhaps someone with prior mod experience like Das
The king of suffering is surely a worthy ruler of a kingdom
Sometimes, but not all the time
Of course if she's comfortable with the role
Yeah I can agree
I was here after XV and XDU Global's launch
So who's good with tech
Will this involve a interview session
So who can control a crowd the best
I am usually not particularly involved
I am a mod on a few of my friends' servers but
Isn't it Tsubasa's birthday now in Japan
Speaking of which
Well that's one problem sorted
What about the potential leaking source to all of these?
I don't wanna be like against anyone but tbh
I'm in agreement 
Everyone's been told not to engage, and yet they persist to be deaf
We should also remind the person who seems to link to them the most to double-check their sources
It's quite NSFW
Let's just say
Just don't look at them
Don't look at their posts
And uh
The channels were all mixed up *and* corrupted
What if next year
~~I'm a joke~~
Oh wait
You'd choke
You're technically touching it by putting your lips onto it
Even with food you've never eaten before
I mean technically he's right
Especially when you upload it without credit
Tracing art is almost worse than just straight up stealing it
Just realized the file was way over size limit so here's a 100 x 100 version
~~I didn't even know that was similar to Megamind~~
(oh yeah here's a Non-tro version for them Nitroless folks)
You can take the new one then
Alright then
The original or this remake
So mods 
Which one of the two we taking
After this it's either the original stays or this new one will be the replacement
Aight this will the final mod
~~or should I pretend you two are a single person and take both~~
So whose advice should I take
What do you mean
Aight how's this
I can go ahead and fix them now
So clearly's there a lot left to be desired
The old one or the newer one
So which do you prefer
I also have a "Non-tro" version for people who are Nitroless

I would like to suggest an update to my KirikaSad emote
If any of you do not mind
I'm fairly certain that isn't the case in majority of cases
~~Also don't want to be mean but I do having to often mute the liveposting channel because of the nonstop posts~~
Please don't get salty with a mod
Maybe a few points in the episode and/or game?
Perhaps like
I was technically referring to the one who was posting the anime lists but sure
that was mainly caused by a single person doing it
technically
WHY YOU DO THAT
We'll be sure deletion won't be a thing
Don't worry
we still mates right?
hi

Heyo
Well I mean their pfp was of the Mad Dummy
Welcome!
There's still a high enough percentage left to assume otherwise
Is that an accurate percentage or just an estimation?
Guess who's back
Welcome!

That was certainly an unique individual
Welp
Uhhhh
Heyo

🐔
Heyo nya
Welcome!
Hey just in time
Welcome!
Welcome
Welcome
Welcome Jack
Nice choice of character for pfp btw
No
But it is a candy brand that made Pokémon candy
Heyo fellow artist
I think they only watched up to like
AXZ
I mean you don't want to be like joining into a furry gang and the first thing they ask you is "which animal do you want to be dating first?"
Just that it'd be better to like ease them into it
Okay I didn't say you shouldn't do it
ain't that a bit too direct for a newcomer to answer
~~Normality is ded~~
Choosing to abandon would mean to erase the good memories I've had along with the bad
I was almost ready to leave completely until a friend reminded me that sometimes even if you're not 100% invested anymore, you can still be with people
I just made a very rash decision over emotional BS and I apologize if my sudden short disappearance made anyone concerned
hi
I hope you're feeling better now
Heyo
Welcome
Welcome mates
Oh heyo
I'm sure it's fine
twitter is basically dying isn't it
oh right
I know them from Twitter
oh hey
Heyo
Heyo
Yooo lit
what happened
uh
heyo
Lava ocean
You know what's the opposite of Iceland
We have frozen grounds again
Welcome back
That doesn't live up to its name
Welcome :D
~~Some rebellions just die off quick~~
~~I left that place long ago 
Last time I checked it's basically become a wasteland~~
What the hell's going on here
Ooo doppelganger arle pfp cool
yejello
Probably made a MOC that's better as statue then a posable thing
But l...
I could show an image
So um
Back onto the MOC
Anyway
Hurray
Or a shinkansen
The one where prime is a train
I meant about Transformers Go
I don't mean go
wat
Oh no Go
THAT one
You don't mean...
Oh
I essentially build my own version of Optimus Prime as a Shinkalion mecha
Anyway
Cool
Yep
Shinkalion
Got inspired off of another Takara IP
And made it into something else
I did eventually break it down
Anyway
Or I made physics my beach
Trust me I had no idea how that giant sword is holding up
Here's an image of the final ver.

Though of course my one went through quite a few stages of improvement
And decided to build my own
Got inspired off of some guys Lego Optimus Primes
So yeah
Back to what I was saying
Anyway
Kewlio
Oh
Nice
BIONICLE was definitely one of a kind for Lego
Yep
Nice
Awesome
Ooo you had the Bohrok?
Nice
A classic
Ooo
Yep
I still can
What's the oldest set you have?
Since when did you start getting BIONICLE sets?
Yes
You ever heard of it?
Also me and  <@449754840445353994> were talking about BIONICLE (on another chat accidentally)
Cool
Power of love is real
Damn
Like how long
In fact somebody sells files for instructions of his models
It was and still is a really popular software
Everyone's does
Don't worry
It just hasn't been updated in a while
You can still download it
Yes and no
You mean LDD?
Then both can come together to create this form
Each of which can upgrade the bot
It's actually made up of the base robot and two other components
But you probably don't wanna pick it up
This thing looks cool
Yeah
But it is a bottle
Well no
KABOOM

Here comes mine
Welp
Welp
Nice
More people?
Oh my goodness
Maximos and Spinax?
So
Is the guy red?
Ooo
Anyone you don't know the name I'll try to guess
Okay just tell us through text then
You can just post set pictures online
Perhaps
Oh right
So  <@486087033652248576> Wanna share your first BIONICLE sets?
I think it looks pretty good
Okay maybe more humanoid dragon
Dragon to robot
Damn
Care to share your history with BIONICLE sets
Oo
yes
THE BOXOR
DAMN GOOD
THE RAHKSHI
OOO
And time definitely didn't help these guys
Unfortunately those were the only two G1 sets I got
Yup
This guy

My dad also built one with me once
Cute
That was a good set

Though I did remember my first set
So I didn't grow up with BIONICLE as fast
I was born in 2004
It was brilliant marketing
To kick-start a fresh new IP with that game
Not gonna lie
Yep
You should've played MNOG
Those ones
nice
oh i see
nani
What'd you think  <@449754840445353994>
My attempt to match up bonkle and sympho
Yep
There's my best guess
Onua is left with Shirabe by process of elimination
Gali would work well with Maria
Pohatu would fit well with Hibiki
Lewa definitely matches up with Kirika
Kopaka could match up with Tsubasa
Tahu could match up with Chris
Hmm imma see
In terms of character
But who of the original Toa Mata match up with the Relic Users
Also don't mean to go on a tangent here
ouch
Although BIONICLE the Game...
Yep
Until Mata Nui showed up
I actually liked what they did with it
2009 was rough
Yep
And it ended almost as soon as it came in
Welp there was one
Who heard about the BIONICLE reboot
Wow
Seems like songs are not the only things connecting you together
Oh I see
You can scroll up to see which sets I got
Haven't built one in a while
Hmm gotta get some more gunpla soon...
I can see those shoes are trying to assert dominance
nice
goddamn that's an army
😦
not very fortunate for Riders...
actually i do have quite a few Figure-Rise Riders
sorry, i couldn't resist
IWAE!
IWAE
ok that's a good one
MAGENTA DA
pink janai
i just like teal in general
naw it has nothing with this anime
hey you just said my favourite colour
looks nice
noice
or something
now build a ww2 bomber
nice
build a cargo jet next
hmmm.....
does it work
nice
Hmm...
Holy bananas
That a lot of kits to get
Holy hell
Nice
GIGA DRILL BREAK!

Gran Cross!

now.....
it's a bonus
but hey
tho the accuracy to the on-screen counterpart is debatable
You can make Tengen Toppa Lagann

with some additional pieces...
there's also one more thing about this guy
Oh yeah
i just looked at reference photos at based it off from there
thanks
https://youtu.be/1OpSGlkObYg
Also I am not the first to have made one and not the one who has built the largest...
tho I might be flexing a bit hard right now
Here's a better shot of it at the front

I decided to build one myself
I figured since not many people attempted to build one (at least haven't seen many people do it online)
Well from the TV series
Uh huh
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
More specifically
Uh huh
Guess which mecha that is
Uh huh

Size comparison
Time to compare to a creation of mine
Welp
This moderoid is somewhat small
I see
Well it is essentially Gunpla but mini
Tho obviously not as good as minipla
Pretty good
Also the Shinkalion design
Can't resist it
That green and pink combo
Uh huh

Dis be it
I got one delivered today as a belated birthday gift
speaking of model kits...
don't put sword to shame <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
that a load of blades
Especially Shinobi
The Miriders rule
Like...8 directors in total
Zi-O...has a lot of directors
Takahiro Ikezoe for Shinkalion
Might be down to the director...
Good question
Kento Shimoyama
Both shows actually share the same head writer
Anywau
Yeah his one is better
My ears are blessed
The Grand Zi-O jingle tho...
Yeah he's cool in my books
Hayato?
What about the shows?
Well yeah...

Find a relation in between these two
that P E R F E C T I O N
all those kits
all that money
i can just imagine the madness of it...
god damn
Can't imagine what the 20-30 combo be like...
Quite a combo
Which kits you be needin?
Anyway
Sword > Einstein
Okay back to brains
me hafe nol indea whit mee siyange
Speeling aunt me stringsiute
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
There we go
"basic essentials as their"
Um...
That's pretty neat
Ooo
Could it be possible to make a Symphogear Gundam team
Now I'm thinking...
:(
anyone?
anyone wanna share their recent model kits?
I haven't done pixel art in a long time if at all
nice axe
Who has Kuuga
So...
Pretty nice
"So, count up your sins!"
I was just talkin bout Precure on another channel
cool
ah I see
How did it go
<@449754840445353994> Your exam done?
Oh
Kay we will
The other three Miriders at least make a valiant effort to disguise the original suits
Even his suit design is lazy for reuses
Back to Ginga...
Okay
Sayonara
Should we actually move this conver to <#377148557796442134>
Really spoiled the Kiva arc
And the less said for Ginga the better
Welp I think it definitely paid off
that looks impressive
goddamn
The army continues to grow...
hmm interesting...
anybody else have Rider kits they've assembled?
who else has this Faiz
dead or alive intensifies
(proceeds to hug enemy)
screams into battle

Might as well show of one of my older kits
Welp
bringing swiss army knives to shame
them blade man...so many of em...
call me back in if you need me
i'll go knock myself out
now we need 'concrete' evidence that mojang studios will add them
nice shrine
RUN FOR YOUR LIVES
it'll take over us all...
The army grows
how
-chiaki minami
-ika musume
-mako mankanshoku
-madoka kaname
she voices
in the english dub
about nepgear's voice actor
wait
it's the best crossover
fanfic right now
more than we originally thought
not comfortable ||having a dead 13 year old bash the prime minister like that||
hell she ||even addresses it in one of the Blu-Ray CMs||
well it's more that ||she gets more lines/screentime outside of the show than in show||
yeah
They both made memes ||that may or may not be official||
Also
huh
"||Flowey|| taught me that"
"In this world, it's kill or be killed."
||jam/conquest||
they made some of the darkest moments
oh yeah
their sister's hair colour are pink
younger sister
long hair
i guess these two do have a lot alike
huh
same va?
wait
parallel universes...?
hmm
A LOOOONNNG while
that gonna take a while
welp
nice men
nice snipers
nice sniper
Watch em go
You've done some good stuff
Go take a good rest
NEPU
you've done plenty good already
have a good rest
ooo neptunia art
Guess they're all petrified
Welp
look at that fleet
that actually looks pretty damn tasty
Where Precures are known as a thing
That 'fanboy' part sorta reminds me of Happiness Charge Precure
Hmm
Oooohh
Also we did already do the back and forth thing
The other can be Vulcan
One of us can be Zero-One
How bout we do a Zero-One dual henshin
Actually
Hmm
Already did that once before
Um
Like what?
*web shot SFX* SPIDER-MAN!
HERO TIME!
Kamen Rider Zi-O!
RIDER TIME!
Hmm..
Not to mention the suspiciously shaped antannae
I'd say the eye sections give it off the most
lmao
I can see a Zi-O vibe from the suit design now I see it again
They're in the same genre of shows
20th Heisei Rider
Kamen Rider Zi-O
Zi-O...
Oh
...kinda?
Noice
look at all these guys
Nice setup.
That's a thing
um
Damn that cape
Damn that armor
Also the OG Amazon and Hibiki combo definitely works
Sounds interesting
Kinda like the sound of the Faiz x Riderman form
Hmm
Tho using the combo Rider forms is pretty cool I must admit (since it was an unused feature in Build)
Tho sounds just a LITTLE too similar to Decade's Rider Cards
Well the Fusion Cards is kinda cool
Oh
Okay
It's okay if you don't
Would you like to show us some of your models?
Noice
<@730341708243533835> so...what model kits do you build?
Most combiners can barely balance with the hand-foot-guns in more than a couple poses
And tbh I wish more combiners used those hands and feet
And the feet are the most proportionate to the combiner
They fit the best
That's kinda why I used CW Computron's hands and feet for my Bruticus
Yeah
FoC Bruticus' toy was just...bad
Did it really? I genuinely felt CW and POTP combiners were the best combiners we've ever got


I can show you a WIP shot if you'd like
Still waiting for Blast Off and Brawl to arrive
<@64565434468282368> I still need two more figures to complete the set
Bruti-time...but not quite yet
You already know the answer to that
Welp
Just a simple repaint
Vortex now be silver
Welp
The jetbike squad is growing
Nice
Nice jetbike
Thx
And thx for liking it
You're welcome
I believe it's oil based
But it's more for paint
Well it's sort of both
Also since Blast Off and Brawl haven't arrived yet I'm just using spare limbs
Good ol' Gundam Markers
Done a little painting for Bruticus
Matt, your best friend for all programming needs <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
Weeb for something that's at the tip of my tongue that for some reason I can't think of
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
In fact it made the issue more apparent
POTP didn't really improve
Not to mention they mess with the propertions as well
Missed opportunity
The better
More firepower
Nice
Hmm
Still debating about that
Hmm
Might as well throw in a sketch https://twitter.com/HadrianLeong/status/1283798188374327301?s=19
And uh you know what
They can turn into drills
His hands?
I guess there's one thing
Hmm
Yeah basically
Although sometimes he can react to stuff quite over the top
And he basically only focuses on situations where he needs to
The spacey part is fiction
Tha laid back part is mine
I'd say it's somewhat half and half
I'd say...really spacey and laid back
Thx
thx
https://twitter.com/HadrianLeong/status/1283708017108754432?s=19
Then you'll have a safe haven for your foxes
Welp
Ah I see
unless for some reason you wanted to spawn them in
true
||Unless a creeper somehow gets in||
A place where all foxes can be safe
Nice
Uh hello
Nice
Also cool birb
Been good
Heyo
Bladed mania
Ikr
(unless you're absolutely terrified of spiders)
It's wholesome
But hey
Yeah I know

welp
Thx
It's a thing now https://twitter.com/HadrianLeong/status/1284065926040760320?s=19
Welp
Night night
Yup
Since it's past midnight
But I will do it tomorrow
Maybe I will
Which I happen to have one
Easier is you have a friend/schoolmate who also does art
And learn techniques from those
I usually just look at other art
Well...
Nice
I was thinking since he makes RPG campaigns that's he's the RP guy
Uh
Yeah I just kinda thought you were an RP guy
Yes
You're the RP guy
Oh right
whose is cooler
Noice
You'll never guess who this is underneath https://twitter.com/HadrianLeong/status/1288243187857973249?s=19
Those designs look pretty nice
Heyo
Nice
It's an egg in a mech suit
Purple and white is a good combo
Nice
thx
https://twitter.com/HadrianLeong/status/1288888012445757441?s=19
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
I would ax you a question but I'm afraid I might chop you down the wrong way
Nice ax
Perhaps
I would want to learn a few things from you but that's not my field of art
(in the good way)
Damn those look sick
smug all round
yup
Meme generator do your magic
Also night night Cyph
Meme possiblities abound
That pose tho
I can see how these can make it into a JRPG game
Nice
You do 3D as well?
Trust me I had difficulties even trying to draw one character
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
You are welcome
I'd say better than me
You're very good
Oo nice
Them wings are majestic
Niiice
Nice robo
Nice and convinient
Hope they can last
It also hangs a bit of skirt armor flowing down the front
Wait
🟡
And
⚪
🟣
Hmm
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
The robo is complete
Nice
Need some time to refuel my imagination
I think I'm gonna take a few days before I start any new ones
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Thx
No u
Nice
Did a little update https://twitter.com/HadrianLeong/status/1289109693462466562?s=19
🇯🇵
Oh?
Nice human
And the nice combo of purple and white continues to show
Nice
That looks creepy and I love it
Well that was a *crabby* end
The blades also come from it
Also the head piece comes from the arachnid drone from the Hero Factory Black Phantom set
Cool
Woah
Noice
You gonna make it into a 3D Model?
Nice
Noice
Although I must admit the outline *does* look a bit rough around the edges
Thx <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
Eh somewhat
https://twitter.com/PrismStar2/status/1294573773820174337?s=19
Noice
Nice

<@84811738653929472> good news
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Geminus is currently asleep. Please call again later. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Niice
I would show my slight repainting of my RKF Metal Cluster Hopper but it's just painting bits silver here and there
Nice giant arm blade
The handheld blades I mean
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740> <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740> <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>

You know what
That's *nice*

Nice jet squad
So tiny tho
Nice
that a tiny piece
damn
Black, gold, grey...
Hmm
These look good
Why do the stars look like somebody spilled jam on all of them?
Very sp00ky
Yes
Probably gonna be the most controversial one for this month
https://twitter.com/PrismStar2/status/1318904662762946560?s=19
I tried to see if I could incorporate all the parts in the set into one form (without slapping all of it on the back)
It's the Shinkalion Movie mecha
Yeah
This was what I came up with
I was messin around with one of my mecha figures today
So uh
Not too shabby
An anime where kids battle each other by making their little robots fight each other
Seems similar to LBX
I think it's some sort of kid robot anime
Ooo nice
Quite stylish
That's a *nice* looking image
Kewl
nice

Here's it in truck mode
Lego Nemesis Prime 2.0
I present
So now I have presented all the past incarnations
Unfortunately I forgot to take any images on this guy in truck mode
This guy does quite a lot different from 1.6
I also like to call this guy Hyper Nemesis Prime
Version 1.7
We're at the final one
Quite a bit more compact compared the previous incarnations
Here's it in truck mode
Quite a different beast from most of the other ones
So now I present Version 1.6
This is now the point where the updates started to get heavy
Here's it in truck mode
Version 1.5 just adds some new stuff while having the wind vein as one piece now
The truck has a wind vein (due to the shield and shoulder missile launchers)
(New weapon, new shoulder launchers and shield)
Added quite a few things to it
This is Version 1.4
With that out of the way
I should also note that the first version was actually made in October last year
At this point I'll skip all the .5 versions to save on time
The front bumper is larger, the windows have a different shape and it's more compact
The truck mode also changes quite a bit
The chest and hips were the main differences
As you can see this version changes quite a bit
Here's Version 1.3
The next one is gonna bring some bigger changes tho...
This is Version 1.25 (which mostly changed the shoulders)
Truck mode is largely the same tho
This also included skirt armour and more tiles to clean up the look
This is Version 1.2 (which cleaned up a lot of the colour scheme)
Needed some fixing
...yeah
Both their truck modes looked like this
This was Ver 1.15 (which just changed a few things around)
And it was made somewhere early last year
I'll call this Version 1.1
This was kinda a mess
(watermark at the corner because I didn't know you could turn that off at the time)
This was the first version ever created
And
And so I patched some parts together
One day I wanted to build a Lego Optimus Prime/ Nemesis Prime because I just wanted to
So
Gundam go vroom
It's probably gonna take a while to find all the right pieces for it

I started work on building something
So uh
Damn
Noice
~~Also this totally isn't just a shading style test or anything naw naw~~
I bet you have the light tolerance of a 6 year old
Oh really?
<@!279385193045819402> how bout you stare into into my eyes instead of into outer space
This is what happens when the universe decides that rules are to be broken
Like within the final hours (according to Japan Time)
I finished her *just* in time for her birthday
PreCure has an equivalent to this sword <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Yes

https://twitter.com/PrismStar2/status/1322688721901203456?s=19
Tho I kinda intended it to look like a turtle head
Thx
https://twitter.com/PrismStar2/status/1322574066201595909?s=19
Welp <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Nice
Oh
That's a big ball Noise
Giving what is essentially G1 Optimus Prime a belly is like giving Popeye skinny arms
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I'll fix that once I get back home
Yeah I will admit the grille is set pretty far in
I'm talking rubbish
Oh wait
Otherwise there'd be no room for it to sit at the front in truck mode
It's necessary for the grille to stick out slightly
And yea
Thx
I think this updated version looks a lot better in truck mode than the previous update
Decided to give him even more chonk
Did a few minor tweaks (mostly to the colours of the arms)
Here's the robot mode compared to a First Grade Age Gundam
Also just for a sense of scale
Thx
(Here's where the new parts end up in truck mode btw)
We all can't be perfect
But hey
It does mess with the transformation tho
Decided to do a little update on him
You are a human
Aight then
And did you react how a normal human would react?
Then have you stepped on Lego?
I think Phar has nightmares about stepping on his Lego creations
Transform into this big boi
It can also
But that's not all
<@!84811738653929472> car
Car
Soon enough I'll be trying a ~~Hololive-branded cutting board~~
I never thought this would be my first piece of Vocaloid art
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
And what were the results?
Oh
And your lunch break was how long?
Huh
15 mins or so spent on drawing this
Ok good
That's Prism wearing Hatsune Miku's outfit
Also just so you haven't figured it out by now
I have no idea how it isn't
Don't judge me Ievan Polkka does stuff to you
This is what happens when you're bored
These look pretty damn good
Ooo very nice
Thx
Yeah I'm somewhat dying over how cute he looks
He's also not wearing his headphones
Decided to sketch Prism with glasses on
Nice Miku
Because apparently all crossover fics have to include OCs
tbh most of these crossover fics are
Cute
Are they not able to sense which universe the katana has vanished to?
And do those enemies have the power to access other universes?
What constitutes as a 'completed task'?
And the prior user is granted partial power of the blade for their good will?
So the katana disappears off to another universe once the job in one universe is done
I've seen worse from DeviantArt
Eh
Kewl
Nice creature
Nice puppet
Quite the booming Noise right there
Thx <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Little low energy today so I sketched Star
Nice car
NOOOOOOO
....right?
Surely nothing can be worse than that, right?
Nice
YOOO VIDEO UP ON HERE
Oo nice
So Zi-O and Ryuki *were* destined to be after all
Onore Metsuboujinrai
Fun
The anonymous messaging app
Oh
Then where did you find it?
Nice and hot
Ooo nice
Dig the enormous unihorn
Noice paint scheme
To explain why Star's shocked
Just pretend that the sock puppet came to life
He has a sock puppet
Isn't there like one character they keep reusing in all their games?
Similar to the Pixar Theory?
Honkai and Genshin are by the same developers
A sign of experience
Nice
Also Land of the Lustrous
Cel shading is nice
Nice
Cute
They look quite detailed too
Ooo Nice
I am thinking of some OCs which use these particular headwears tho...
It's just a thing I did in my sketchbook
Naw
Hmm
Thx
These two pieces of headwear just came into my head suddenly and I thought of drawing them
Nice
Only occurs within the 2040's
Ah yes the Gaynado
Maybe
I mean she has fired off lasers in the sky so
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Cause she ain't into *shady* gangs
She ain't got no shade
Apparently not
Kewl
Noice
Some proportions issues here and there but eh
Yes I did say piece twice
Sorta a companion piece to an earlier piece
Nice
I did sketch out a reference sheet on paper
You probably can't tell from the image but they are wearing a tophat
Decided to draw an OC I thought up for a few days
Nice
Nice
I haven't posted anything on my art Twitter account for like almost a month now <:SerenaDizzy:736605371912945736>
Speaking of which
Who wouldn't be excited to see their creation be finished?
<@237964037898502144> 🗞️
Usually in anime it's either a full smile or two small strokes representing a smile
Cute faces on the objects
Ooo nice
Is this girl on the gay list too?
The best combination
and cool
Cute
Noice
Noice
Omae wa Mou Shinderu
:d
:D
You shall now taste the blade
Well probably not but that's besides the point
I knew you well
Ikxi
Welp
Sick dab yo
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
Good luck doing it without having a blade-sized hole in your chest
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Nice :3 face
Noice
Look at this cutie
Oh damn the full look is badass
Cool design
Ooo
I think I'm mixing up my lefts and rights
I kinda prefer the one of the left (the one with more shading on the face)
Now in terms of the rest...
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
Also cute
Oh I see
Nice collection of eyeballs
AHHHHHHH
<:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
That look great
Damn
Omae wa moe shinderu
What could it possibly be?
And it seems the weapon of choice has been filtered by the question mark sign
This is quite the murder scene
Welp
(Here's the two together)


These two images basically describe the mood of 2020
*"DIMENSIONAL TITLE Page"*
Oh
Damn what happened to her eyes?
Nice stuff
Perhaps thin out the boot a little bit?
Maybe thin out the boots a bit
I think it looks fine
Decided to edit some of the lines (mostly in the legs and hands)

I also used a part of a Flash puppet I created
Oh yeah
Sugoi
Kewl design 🙂
Thx
I did change up the timing once more for the final animation a bit (especially towards the end)
This second one's for a more detailed sketch to show the facial expressions in each frame
(Half the video's empty since the final "Merry Christmas" bit wasn't in the original sketch)
This one's the first initial sketch for setting the initial frames
Imma show a couple of behind-the-scenes stuff
Now
Not too bad
So yknow
But I worked on this for 3 hours
Although I'd say it's a bit rough around the edges
Thx
Here it is
The animation's done
So
Thx <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
That's definitely one tiny pilot
Here's the sketch for it (with the audio)
Anyways
~~I swear it's not because I'm lazy~~ <:MariaBully:689614085452464318>
I recorded every sound effect with my voice (minus the thud sound)
(I chose a bone just because it's the first item that popped up in my mind)
(Yes I used my voice)
Boop
Started off normal then descending into madness
It kinda felt like reading a DDLC poem
That was spooky
Welp
Love the hair strand going all over the place
Nice
I win in meme factor hands down <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
No reaction <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Definitely true art....but not true enough!
Kill it with fire
Curse Gunpla parts
Oooo
**expand content**
Also I put my Shirabe puppet there because I needed someone for him to interact with
I didn't do too much with the animation because the focus was the lip sync
Boop
*doing a lip sync test*
It's New Years and what am I doing?
Niice
Nice ~~bag~~ pouch
What a scene
Welp
His right sock has one half of the Gemini constellation on it

So here's all the different angles
I have completed my puppet
Hmm
I see
~~FIFA 22 JP EDITION CONFIRMED~~
~~Fifa 22 JP~~
Guess we now know what game this is gonna turn into...
Welp
Nice skull
Reminds me of a specific type of cartoon style
YOOOOO
I am but I'm not sure about her
Nice wings
Or lose em
Good job
How many of these exist in the world within the fiction?
So does their outfit also attune to their assigned role/personality?
Sorta like a machine program for everyday convenience
Interesting
Nice black-armoured Gundam on a nice big white horse
Too much for this world to handle
Look at all these clones
Time to double the amount of views for my puppet
Nice *eggsplosion*
Seems interesting
Talk about rising up to the challenge
Aight that's it where's the pun police
~~Mario Strikers 3 when~~
~~Spend a load of money on microtransactions and lootboxes for an achievement~~
Or yknow
Cute look
Good choice
Decided to do a pose test for the revamped puppet
Alongside their personalities, do their clothes also reflect on the role/user they're assigned to?
Also about the personalization of these Buddies
Interesting
You know just call the snek "Big Boss"
Pink hair senshi vs giant snek
So
This is what pain looks like
It's meant to be swept back being beside where the 'strap' would connect
Decided to try out adding a headphone spike onto one ear
Thx <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
They look cute
Not bad for not using these in a while
~~Make it so tall she's barely visible~~
Nice
That is lit yo
Either that's the baby or it somehow shrunk
Thx <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Added some subtle gradients for the ground and sun(?)
Did a little silly thing testing out shade masks
Never bothered to change it
Just like this
I used masking for the parts so that I can realign them depending on the angle and position of the light source
Decided to do shading on the puppet using some masking
Have fun with that
I can see this artstyle of your's taking off
That's really cute <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Ooo
And now I kinda regret doing so <:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
Welp I did a thing in 1 minute
I suppose
I have no idea why I chose to draw Kuuga
NO FEAR NO PAIN
So being able to spread themselves faster than the anti-virus can keep out
Very cool lookin
Oooo
I really like the design
You're welcome
So I drew one of them
I really liked one of Amiya's Buddies
Hmm not bad
Just did a little animation test with the new puppet upgrade
<@340979591864909834> <@84811738653929472> You both did a nice job
Aite Gwen off to the Calm Down Corner with you
That is one badass outfit
Damn
Nice
I mean some aren't human-looking
By different
Tho some of the others will look very different
Yeah
They're their own thing
Well no
They are one of the eight "Elemental Creators"
I call them Kira
Concept design for a new OC
Cool look
~~Yeet it~~
Pen outline + pencil shading combo let's go
Noice
Interesting designs
Dem long legs
It doesn't have as much expression as the real deal
However that *perfection* comes a downside
Being more friendly, prettier and more attractive/perfect-looking
The more round one (left) represents the beauty of creations
Being messy, unfocused, rigid creatures
The more edgy one (right) is meant to represent the nature of natural humanity
So there is kind of a metaphor in terms of the way they're drawn
Here's a comparison between the two forms
Interesting
Or is this a different OC?
Yes
So from a digital creature to an alien?
Reminds me of the old Lego logo introduction in older Lego games
Fun
Are all those Lego studs?
In both he's a human
Well
Whoops
Oh right
The personalities are also reflected in the way each one is drawn
Nice
Not as happy and cheerful
This default form of his is a lot less bright
It allows him to change into his alternate form
Or rather half a mask
It's a mask
Well
Workin in a new version of Prism Star
Thx <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And now I feel like one of those edgy 2000's kids
Tried out a different style here
~~Although it reminds me of Yu-Gi-Oh for some reason~~
I think it looks pretty decent for a first try
Give him some slack
People this was his first try at face sculptin
I dunno who it looks like
Let's go with gembutts
Got a little Shinsha sketch for you gembutts
~~Make it Yugioh hair~~
Oooo <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Nice shoes
Spoiler warning for Land of the Lustrous

Kinda wanted to paint him up since the original figure sorely lacked paint
RKF Grand Zi-O
No
Doin some touchups to an old repaint
*CONCLUSION ONE.*
And one in 12FPS
One in 24FPS
But I made two versions of it
Also decided to make another animation test
I just decided to draw Bowser
Ah I see
And kinda fitting for them
Spooky
The belt having a split black/white design
Here's Prism Star with headphone spikes similar to Hibiki's and a waist cape attached on with a belt
Boop
Here ya go
This should be better
I probably should've circles instead of stright lines
Yeah kinda
Have some minimally-animated snow
Then again I'm not a huge Maple Story fan
I wasn't aware one of them was from a game
Ah I see
Kinda love how one of them has a dragon head gauntlet
A Final Form
Interestin
Ooo
Apologies for not getting your question the first time
They still feel like they are the same character
Tho there are some differences
Well I can see some similarities in the outfit
OH
Cuuute
Ooo
I sketched this out pretty quickly last night
(spoiler tag for KR Saber)
||*Primitive Dragon!*||
That means we gotts build shelters incase Noise become real
Uh oh
Run
Fiction is becoming reality
That's it
Welp
*~~Was it this thing's doin?~~*
Discord on my laptop crashed then restarted
As soon as I clicked off of this channel
Uhhh
That didn't last long
Welp
Nice, nice and nice
Looks pretty cool
Ah I see
I sense a MMSF reference with that dragon hand
Cool lookin
Oooo
~~Well kinda because Riders *are* based on insects~~
It's aight
I only just uploaded my thing less than 20 minutes before yours
Uh
I swear I have a thing for drawing Rider berserk forms
*HAZARD ON!*
Niiice
I see
Kinda sounds like something you'd hear in a RPG Maker game
Nice and techy and groovy
Have fun with that
Kewl
Shoutmon X5/X6/X7's faceplate
Yes
I recognize that X-shaped faceplate
(Tho the major stuff's on the right half)
Followin someone's advice I redid Twin Star's hair
https://twitter.com/PrismStarMain/status/1369219888217272320

Pretty bangin drumline
Hmm

The train mecha are cool tho
~~Gee I wonder who got you interested in that one~~
Swordception
Big blade good
Ooo blade
https://twitter.com/PrismStarMain/status/1375601769133277185
Ooo robot
Very cool
https://twitter.com/PrismStarMain/status/1372626302537191424
Cool
Good luck soldier <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
Nuuuuu
<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>
The ED is a banger tho
Damn those look cool
Noice
Imagine wielding a sword taller than you
https://twitter.com/PrismStarMain/status/1380574751362519041
All I know is
I don't know why I did this
There we go
Crud
Oops
Oh
Buying what
I can't be the only one noticing this pattern right

Hmm
https://twitter.com/PrismStarMain/status/1379123972009246730
Ooo nice
Then again I wasn't bothered with the fact I didn't get seen in the first place
It's almost luck honestly
No luck :(
But 24 hours later
I tried
*WE'LL GET THEM NEXT TIME*
*MISSION FAILED*
Mission: *Noticed by Death*
https://twitter.com/PrismStarMain/status/1378361832772096000?s=19
https://twitter.com/PrismStarMain/status/1378311641859813378
An intentional nod to their shape-shifting abilities?
Well definitely captures the inhumane nature pretty well
Ah I see
Also that face is creepy with a side of cuteness
Like the puffy sleeve ends
It's a nice mix and cute and cool
I like that look
Ooo
It also looks pretty cool
It also kinda reminds me of Cyberdramon
Kinda looks like if a Xenomorph and a Dragon fused
That do be a AmiRex
Ooo
Low def
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Come on now
It'll tickle a bit
*Final Form Ride: A-A-A-Amiya!*
Hmm
Does this mean mecha like Abaren-Oh and Kishiryu-Oh?
So going by it saying dragon-esque dinosaur
Hmm
As in like Super Sentai/Super Robot Wars-esque mecha?
Mecha?
OOOO
Flows with AmiRex a lot better
Nice
The head's much more in proportion to the rest of the body
Definitely prefer it to the previous design
SUGOI
Nice
So it would read 5000/5000
I think just omitting HP would make it cleaner
Nice
~~Probably cause I was watching the Metsuboujinrai film while making this~~
I kinda did base it off of Thouser/ZAIA
Yeah...
<@!740195087895756820>
https://twitter.com/PrismStarMain/status/1387293823446011905?s=19
Outfit kinda reminds me of something a biker would wear
CUUUUUTE
Nicu
Diary Milk huh?
Ah I see
Honestly I thought it would've been a bit more pink?
Proportions I'd say are better than the last version
Like the helmet with the massive 'bunny ears'
Lookin pretty cool
Nicu
Imagine it irl
Like that looks like it's almost as long as the box itself
A big sword
That is
Or at least the idea of an English Symphogear dub
https://4kids-entertainment-fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Warriors_of_Symphogear
Because of this
All of this came into fruition
Basically
So
Absolute adorbs
Ooo nice
Subarashi
Nope
Noice
It's the ultimate challenge of everyday life for an artist
Now put the Decadriver on Hibiki
Nice
Hmm
That's how they get ya
We do *not* talk about Boss Baby thank you
Not a bad start
||Yeah I know||
I know you said you wrote it on a joke
I felt the pacing on some bits were a bit off
But it could do some refining
It's a decent concept
You read my mind sister
Just post it in DM
Don't think I have
Yeah I guess
Those some giant horns
Some Puyo Puyo art
Oh hey
Get ready for some carnage
Pretty creative parts usage
Huh
Nice
Uh huh
We've went a long way folks
https://twitter.com/NovaKirahoshi/status/1400409443410628608?s=19
A bit tough around the edges but I'm calling this done
Time to make Saikou Shadow a little more 'colourful'
這很好！
Cool
Confused as hell
https://twitter.com/NovaKirahoshi/status/1399788009923428366?s=19
Mogu mogu
Nice wings
https://twitter.com/NovaKirahoshi/status/1398658526659203072?s=19
Y'know she went through some tough stuff
Sugoi
Dang that's cool
No that applies to here as well
You're supposed to wait at least an hour after someone posted something to post yours
You kinda broke a rule here
Wait sir
I think I know where you're going with this
And the colours are green and pink
And some Joycons
I see some spray paint
Why not let me decide that one?
Uh
Gettin a Cross-Z vibe from this design
Cool
lmao
I did
Oh right
I believe this is my first fanart of a VTuber?
https://twitter.com/NovaKirahoshi/status/1401189930920034305?s=19
Yeah the Odin design is so sleek and menacing
LIT
OOO
Definitely quite the shelf presence
Tell me your hype level
DESS
~~You'd have to sell your organs just to balance costs~~
Yup
And how much would that cost
~~Combine them all into one giant mecha~~
I'm sensing Shenshoujing vibes from the colours
Omegamon (Omnimon) and Lilimon (Lillymon)
Yes
I guess it counts
Now you doin the Pro Controller

Let's get frilly then

Huh
The tuning keys?
~~I would too~~
Don't worry
Minor design update
https://twitter.com/NovaKirahoshi/status/1406928232218304518
Surprised how distinct these two look from each other
https://twitter.com/NovaKirahoshi/status/1412820322500464641
Along with her 'Blanket Form'
Slight update on Ghostie's design
Thanks
I call her "Ghostie" for now
Just decided to design a ghost girl doll thing
Cool
But for right now I'm still needing to test stuff for the rigs
I plan to in the future
Care to elaborate?
Oh thanks
Idk but I think you are too
Mood the hood smaller (the original hood size made the head look too big)
I see
https://twitter.com/NovaKirahoshi/status/1414992400720748548?s=19
I'm not omitting straight lines altogether
And don't worry
2. It's my own personal choice
1. You probably shouldn't mention any **banned** members in here
Okay
Decided to try a mix of curves and straight lines this time
Shaaaaark
You can call Pumpkin the first person to add years to lives
If you actually did get 50 years
It's still so bloody cute
GOOD JOB
👍
BEST FRIEND
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
That's more IwI
THAT'S SO CUTE
AWWWW
BIG BOO
Yeah same thought
I'm having way too much fun posing this gal
Like it was from a Gameboy Advanced game?
Cool
Are they currently functional?
Noice
It's blue
Ah yep
That's what it looked like from the concept art reference
I will say this is front view done for now
Sort of
I present my ~~new original OC~~ <:Ver:704169051391524875>
You fell into the trap yourself <:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
It's a VTuber's
Hint
Of course not
Pfft
You'll never guess who wears this outfit
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Makes reusing it a lot easier as well
Option 2 it is
Aight then
Something like this?
Here's the laughing expression without the 'eye shadow'
Anyways
I did start this sort of thing during my...MLP days
I guess you can say that
I guess I just wanted to illustrate that there is an eyelid there
Expressions test for the Gura rig
You're gonna be a star man
If Fubuki retweets this as well
I still want Dice-Oh's theme released...
Why not
We already had her do Gurren Lagann so
Cmon Kaiya do us proud
~~Somebody draw that~~
Y'know what have them do a combo attack
Yandere Amelia
Yknow what
I mean it's Amelia
Here's some expression tests for Ame

Going by your YouTubr channel

I'm innocent
What you mean
Join us anyway
I see a challenger has arrived
Sorry bois
I have fallen in https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1431371122969387015?s=19
Here's the almighty nerdy edgelord
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismCasual/status/1430492652009558017?s=19
*Oh my*
Here is Prism's first three angles along with the sketch for them
Here is one of my OCs, Prism Star, with a *slight* stylistic makeover
~~For the last time I don't want Amber~~
...and?
Nice!
If anything *he* should be apologizing
Since the song dubs it over
Well that part doesn't matter for the clip
Most anime openings' aren't longer than say 2 mins max
Also I feel like it could've just been on part rather than two
I just feel the song doesn't fit with the actual clips used
... it's okay?
Well can't judge it since I can't access it there
(as they should)
All of them supporting the Ichaival Gundam
5-10 minutes together
Well I did do these in like
I see
Sorry for that
Yeah I'll try next time
Although now you said it it could be a good thing
I don't think I have
I believe in Getter bois
Mmm tasty
It's sweet yet spooky
What can I say
It's literally a pancake with spider legs and blueberry eyes that's literally drooling maple syrup everywhere it goes
Here's a really weird creature concept I'd like to call "Cakecrawler"
Ah
That is certainly a shield/blade combo
Cool
Noice
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1438184217666543625?s=19
(unless if it doesn't give you all the correct colours)
Less stickers on a kit is always a pro
That looks great
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1446808429767581696?t=UMSYfYEtiebMyHlbwSbwTQ&s=19
(Yup the tail's an alien now)
BOO
Peek-a
We gettin some lore? <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
These sorts of month prompts can be used to experiment with different things
I love it
So much good time gay energy here
It has a living mouth as its tail and can shoot spiky crystals shards from its body
Time for big kitty 🦁

I present...the evolution of Colour Bright/Prism Star! <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Guess who's back
Back again
Not too into it tho
I Def know it
So twice
Probably because it is
Yeah it's definitely very cute
Just wanna put something behind
Yeah I know
Unblocked you on Discord
Heyo may I request to be unblocked?
... it's just a standing pose
I was bored last night so I just made a simple Arle one angle puppet
Fancy
Ooo
Apparently so
Who says you can only do one archetype when you can Frankenstein them together
Maybe XDU will deliver
Feels good to be working on it again after a bit of a break from it
(speaking of which I better save up for Hibiki Act mode)
It also tastes of AWESOMENESS
It's a little rough but it gets the job done
UPDATE: Painted up the Driver with the Genius Bottle
And here are ~~everyone's favourite Final Forms~~
Thanks
Original for comparison
Just did a bit of a paint job on RKF Build Genius
Yeah same
Can't really judge too much since it's still a sketch but it looks pretty cool
I'm sure some of you have heard of her https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1457369324574887942?t=9HC-dg_9XHdSTzkJodiWaQ&s=19
That is dedication
Then take an image
Hold down the D E and S keys
Now
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1461777317567598602?t=usx6hB8U3UTjgdYR3zStNg&s=19
With a lot of extra detail
Kinda reminds me of a design from Trasnformers Animated
So whatcha thinkin
I shall use this test scene of lighting with backgrounds as the basis for my next project
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1459830255426932736?t=d9fzu47-IkupsLIdwA90Og&s=19
Clear plastic used for joints on the other hand...
Okay good
And I have mixed feelings on its longevity
That's a lot of clear plastic
Wait is that who I think it is
I can't believe you're making anime girl Dr Robotnik
The longer you stare at your own artwork, the more flaws you find and the more times you call yourself a baka
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Can't forget about style
(and possibly to be stylish)
Coolio
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1464941145809637377?t=op_HC1NUgiyqblcMoluxSg&s=19
It literally looks like a skyscraper on each shoulder
Look at them shoulder spikes
Oh no they're still multiplying
Liked it btw
Here's a comparison between the original and this new outfit
And after some time 
Here's a full body shot of the final outfit
Nice
Welp I just found a potential reaction image
...would you like a jelly baby
(you can also go to this Twitter poll to vote) https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1466765780574515205?t=ZLKdmF38SmjeNnqANYxwOA&s=19
Which one of the two do you people prefer
The second concept is meant to mix both the scientist look and the space themes of the original look
The first concept here is meant to take the "smart" aspect and sort of increase it
So 
I decided to design two concepts for a new outfit for Nova
Each one with a slightly different design idea 
(Here's the original for reference)
Doesn't help that Ultraman would basically make a Gear user not much taller than their foot maybe
Somebody make this into a meme
Doing that pose the cool kids do
Can Def tell how accurate it is to the official design
Is that based on an IDW design or is it original
Hmm
...nevermind then
Still an egghead
Whenever I think of twintails I just think Miku
Idk
SEKAI DE ICHIBAN OHIME SAMA
~~Turn her around~~
peace was never an option yo
I like it too
You have done your grandparents proud
That pink hair smells suspicious
She's hiding something I can tell
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1467455209756626948?t=Pfbp52raBsT3p7kcutxgMA&s=19
Damn straight
Organization is king and queen mates
Yes
Big bulky mecha good
And/or sword sizes that give Cloud a run for his money
Gotta love anime girls with big swords
Gotta love mecha with big swords
Cool!
Here comes the airplane
Mario is a damn chad
IT'S THE SOUND OF THE POLICE
🚔
(I was kinda proud of this one too but flaws are flaws and flaws need fixing)
Back to the drawing board
Aight then
Yikes
Ah
So whatcha all think?
COUNT THE MEDALS 1 2 AND 3
We got Gwyn out here making a game controller
~~Steal back then~~
Plus it's always a nice chill side thing to do so
Art is not a test
It is a journey
Oui, mon ami
Exactly
great meme
YES
Don't listen to what people say on the internet of how references don't make you a real artist
It's for scientific research
It's for science but it's also for decency
And gives more of an organic feel
Not to mention it helps with defining the character/personality more
The new one has a more fluid form with more curves
Realized something somewhat incidental when comparing these two
Yeah
They charged £100 when I asked to cancel a subscription on an incorrect account
Yeah 
That happened to me when I cancelled my sub
You are charged with a £100 fee
If you cancel your subscription
And I learned the hard way that
£20 per month for Animate
Welp Adobe seems to have no problem doing it
I do not feel comfortable paying over $100 per month
Although Harmony Premium is cheaper 
it's a subscription
And essentials' like less then $100
Mama Mia that is a super spicy price
So like how Toon Boom has Essentials and Premium
Ah
Actually it feels like a combo between Moho and Opentoonz
With meshes and weights
Interesting 
So it's kinda similar to what I experienced with Opentoonz
I'll check out some videos on it when I have the time
(Tho tbh anything is better than Flash/Animate's bones)
Never heard of that one
(Also Animate is a 2D program so yeah)
If you're looking for bone rigging stuff Toon Boom is majorly superior
You would have to like
Create different symbols and drawings to simulate such
You can forget about it cause it doesn't exist
Weight painting tho
Unfortunately it does lock you out of other ways of animation
Inverse kinematics are there too
But they extremely basic and are a bit...meh
In older versions (and possibly this version) there are bones
She be a pirate matey?
UCHU KITAAAAAAA
Yeah that's what I was thinking
Ah
I probably already know the answer but just to be sure
Wait what programming language is that
I did show this to another server and they told me that it looks 'jank'
Sorry it doesn't really look the best
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1479946468500946945?t=RflM9hrB2BlpQSVmz73v2w&s=19
So this is why Fine wanted the break the Curse of Balal
Any shots of it?
When you can't think of designs
Lego it is
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1477621022912401411?t=Eod_tVBE9aycgixx_0pjRA&s=19
Imaging taking a random you you have laying about and making something terrifying out of it
Hey you
Did you steal his limbs
Oh noes what happened to his limbs
I guess it's an illusion
So
Does the cannon straight up replace the arm
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1484599448122576897?t=tM5AyXa_bBfRW1KwpN0FAg&s=19
Aight we chuggin with this
This current WIP of shape language in class got the approval from my teacher
Noice
Feelin the Red Riding mood so here's another character reimagining 

We have a robotic wolf bounty hunter who is armed to the teeth
Potentially
Hmm
Ended up designing a version of Little Red Riding Hood as a robot with my current project for school 

It was a lot of fun
I just left off those stickers
I just decided not to bother
Black stickers on a black piece
Also
Due mostly to the stickers
Gotta say Decade is easily the hardest of the sets I built
And here are all of my Figure-Rise Standard Rider kits altogether
This is my preferred pose for Decade
And here he is Bois
Hmm
Now I wonder what a cybernetic Hibiki custom figma would look like...
Ah I see
How did you manage to attach them legs?
Okay okay jokes aside
I guess this is a sketch then
Groovy as hell
That's a great cover
Wait what's wrong with motion blur
Cheeky and cynical whilst keeping a childlike sense and is playful
I imagine their personality being similar to a mix between Garie and Micha
So here's a concept of a robotic character
And their hands can do multiple stuff
Yes very
Did this like over a week ago but I painted up my Saber Brave Dragon figure
I recognized prebuilt functions like print and the IF and ELSE statements
It ain't mining rocks
It's mining souls
It ain't mining
It's killing
Yeah
This new bot tho?
I did my best to recreate the model as best as I can
So I saw someone make an alternate fan model using the Lego Space Mining Mech set
Here's what was the best result
Welp I kinda worked all day yesterday for a redesign
Extreme smug
Here are a few of the first concepts I came up with
So following some constructive criticism on another server I decided to redesign Solartist
(btw if anyone wants this hat here you go)
Ah I see
Whose legs
Mine's gonna for 2D reference
Mainly for drawing purposes
Here's the sketch I'm using for reference
I'm doing a back view (tho more on a side angle)
In fact this is only half of it
I'm doing a similar thing actually
Welp have fun for that
Woo
Nice
But this is only one of the puzzles
And now the puzzle is complete
This is how robots truly hop mates
Oh noes how can he run now
Ngl was kinda thinkin that too
I think he needs a hand
Okay I was expecting a more sinister answer
Why do you have 5 disembodied heads
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
...I don't like the implications of 'riding' going on here...
Very pretty
What did Optimus Prime do
Why
So Ikxi is apparently into that sort of thing
She can now hear all of your ~~sinful thoughts~~ delightful memories
Hurray she has ears
Also I guess I just have a decent eye
I guess I can just look at a design and know how to translate it into a build
I don't even have an engineering background
I guess inspiration and creativity
Idk
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1490655338361765888?t=mqJtRQxima1FX6BhYZj4vg&s=19
Decided to draw a Towa cause I like her outfit
And here I go into this hole again
Custom limbs FTW
I mean you could lengthen them with friction adders but then they only have a ball joint connection
Aside from one or two pieces that are shorter
Those joints are slowly becoming more and more extinct
Yikes
I'm surprised you still have intact 2008/2009 sockets
Looks kinda cool
Why is she not yellow?
Wait a second
What it's good
Why is this one of the first things I do to my new sketch pencils and rubber
Look at this bloody gremlin
You're gonna have to
Get outta bed rn young lady
3 weeks man (first one was made on 25 Jan)
They grow up so damn fast
Nyan
Just practice and you'll get better
I know the feeling
That look pretty decent
Guruguruguruguru
And voila
Double of doubles
Yup
It's alive
Decided to take my little puppet for a test
She got the drip
But still not quite functional rigs
As in they look fine now
Welp got two scuffed angles done
There can never be too large of guns
Hey if you know Chris
Oh they're crossbows
But can she handle them both at once
Uh oh
I see violence is at play now
The legs have now been added
They may not have legs yet but their tamashii already strong
Would you trust him to take care of your sibling while you're away
C'mon you can trust this boi can't you
Try to do this with your Miis
~~Also good luck finding a full DX GaoKnight for any of you~~
That one mecha that was kinda cool ~~until it got caught offguard~~
It's almost half past 1 in the morning
But that's for tomorrow
Gonna use these for something later
Thanks!
Whatcha think?
Welp I got some angles done
Hope that it doesn't bake your PC
Nice
I present the edgy OC recolour
Dang that's metal
She got that cocky smirk
This is what happens when you cluster all of your transparent/lucent pieces together

Poyo
I also decided to sketch this during school break
Much more rough and 'edgy'
So last night I decided to try a somewhat different style
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1503287828775673861?s=19
HE GOT THEM ANKLES
Her bgm is really soothing
Ngl
Let's hit it

~~amogus~~
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1500800517223636999
Aight yeah that hair piece Def looks like a banana
Workin out a colour scheme to give this moon guy
Def gonna need some revisions tho
Designed a hero-type character for my universe
Noice
Coolio
So I might need to Collab with someone if I eve decide to persue that
Tho obviously game design is not something I have a particular strong point in
And it could work
They think it'd be a cool thing
<@84811738653929472> <@331908049822547978> So I discussed the thing you suggested yesterday on another server and general consensus seems to be the same
That is certainly some gold
More specifically the modern term Adobe Animate
Yup
I'll consider it
Hmm
A YouTube version is also now available! https://youtu.be/YfxM2nftgh8
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1505128615926763523?t=3gYb-WL_nHIREzTqN4yRdA&s=19
Well the clip has no audio yet, but the animation part's basically done!
I skipped one WIP clip but now here's round 3, with SPEED
Now that's cool
So gotta bit of a WIP here
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1504358251663605762
This is just a couple of sketches (including one I have posted previously) along with some lore
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1504028316801683458?t=hINNoB3l81eZkC7WnjinKg&s=19
(gear, sword, bones forming three points)
It's meant to be a 'trident' made out of stuff that's considered ancient or old
I guess you can say that
WAIT I HAVEN'T HAD DINNER YET

Have some more of these lanky bots
Was playin around with some proportions today
So have a lanky sunbot

Bruh those are legit great drawings
"don't draw very well"?
Look at this cool mask-masking guy
Look at him
So cool
Haven't finished the full sketch phase yet but here's a start of another thing
Good for those cool kneels
She has knee pads now
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1517396429085589506
Kinda short but it's mainly just a test
Thanks! :)
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1517264539762503681?t=Zh_bWLKJLU3j2ofp3GdxKQ&s=19
Magical girl knights? REALLY COOL
Knights? Cool
Magical girls? Cool
Although I think she does occasionally do some gaming
Yeah
Unfortunately I do have a few not-so-minor problems
You know I think becoming a VTuber could be an interesting thing as a side thing
derpaty derp derp
\fwoosh

I assume they're just as stable in a battlefield
Oh okay
So...not illegal?
How old are they canonically
Just a question
He seems to be eyeing her
~~is this love~~
A baby alien creature head
Maybe like
I mean c'mon the button looks large enough
(alien creature head pops out of belly button)
KIRAKIRA
~~no horny in this house gang~~
STYLISH
Very nice
Ooo
New animation out!
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1518859745104470018
(Also probably very untimely for the weather but)
For a clip just over 20 seconds
~~This is nearly 20MB of stuff~~
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1518548515496026112
So here's a WIP of my newest creation
And here's the complete sketch phase (minus some possible timing readjustments)
Just a simple animation test this time
Nothing special
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1523348469527629824?t=-6dpvQbup6adO_cZwjVyNw&s=19
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1522350139721068546
A neck so long it expands beyond the realm of the universe
Wait no that's only reaching the bare minimum of the stratosphere
What in the heck have you done
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Main four angles are almost done
Kinda looks more like a frame for something
But hey at least it looks cool
A jacket so spiky you have to potential of it cutting into yourself
The most amount of sharpness into one packet
JK he has limbs now
No limbs get him
It's time for the rigging takeover
I don't even know how you got that
I
(outfit's based on one of my older OC's)
Aight got this colour scheme what do you think
P I N G A S
This character was created from people's details from a challenge
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1520823247264264193
~~pink hair girl with a scythe
Gee where have I seen that one before~~
(summons giant sword from the sky)
She not lookin too happy
B A C C
Whatcha think about this
Decided to add back some elements from the OG design (tho in different ways)
I'll probably do a revision of the redesign tomorrow
There was a lot more on the original
Yeah I can see
(oh yeah since this is a redesign I'll show the original)
(Just imagine as thinking all the synthetic skin has somehow all rotten away)
she spoopy and thin
Aight time for another character redesign what do you think
Mecha final form has been achieved
Engineering at its finest
I have built a robo dog that can turn into a leg for a mech
Perfect combat duo
Gotta have mecha fodder
I have upgraded this thing even further and also now have given it a 'mass-produced' version
~~Tho the kinds we each do are kinda different~~
Who wouldn't want to mess around with virtual better-than-figmas
I guess we're the same then
~~Imagine this in the actual JoJo style~~
Now with loads of eyes on the body
Welp I guess I went ahead and gave the mech some upgrades
Idk how but I just started putting pieces together and got this mecha thing
Holy mama
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1523450234700910592
I'm kinda bad with left and right
Tell me which colour
Look at all these babi bots together
That looks cool
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1527343348020760586?t=8l15rUTlkShcU_h7v6ZmZA&s=19
WAH
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1526864080203571201
I didn't think you'd be into the style
Wow thanks you two
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1526544061523435521?t=5Vfyslnd36eaJA8LQ7b6-g&s=19
A few more angles and and it'll be onto expression stuff
Guess what she now has limbs
No limbs but still as crazy as ever
Probably because of the whole "robot on treads" thing
Kinda reminds me of Getter-3
She shall stare into your soul with her eyes with eyes
Got me a Lego super robot
~~and possibly make even more pairs~~
I hope to eventually expand upon this world and eventually create an entire universe of characters

So anyone else got any favourites?
Still the old one eh
Rig ain't done yet and he is getting impatient
Three tones is better than two
Guess what tho
Thanks :D
Whatcha think of these colours
I am trying an old approach to making this rig: kitbashing
Y'know what this doesn't mesh too badly so far
He has now been partially digitized
Got some new fun mini sketches
I think I achieved the look of a Chinese robe well
I guess it's time to show you a preview of this new kid
But yeah if any of you wish to support me
Perhaps more aggressive advertising
No hope so far tho
Trying to get some traction for my Ko-Fi page
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1532804638163992576?t=YmnR_Ntkjn4DGuD7ma3bbw&s=19
And here's a thing I've been brainstorming for even before secondary school ended
Been trying some colour stuff with this rig
https://mobile.twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1539160533449965568
And guess what the feesh herself found it
Yup
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1538946775280672769
insert obligatory dark evil doppelganger
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1538328565598539776?t=r3BKRGNDDu7PtHCNAKe0vg&s=19
The martial boi now has a cane
2. Make it more of a cane/walking stick
1. Middle one but more streamlined
I had shown off 3 of these designs to a server before and they suggested 2 things
These are the first few concepts
Have been figuring out some staff/cane designs for Jade all day
There are 10 ones in 10
MATRIX EVOLUTION!
similar vibes
And you'd be right
He be doin some martial pose now
(fake tho)
He has a tail now
Aight apologies for sharing so much in a short time but here's another test pose (based on one of the sketch poses)
He can speen now
I'm actually in awe over this holy mama
Time for come colour tests
What about you then
Those lines aren't the only thing thicc about her... <:KanadeLewd:690470896174891008>
Strength shall now rise
Why do I see only around 30% pink overall
~~Faker~~
(they're also the tallest members)
Two more members will complete this team
A five-person team of robots and humans
Yes
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1543336621470355457?t=cc2HWWNJqcp1iqdCKnv_bQ&s=19
Noice
Or rather appeals the most
Which artists' styles generally interest you the most?
Tho probably can't say much since I don't do NSFW stuff myself
I think the art is pretty well done
Yeah what he said
Oh dear god what have I done
She with dat cool pose
Haha secret surprise
Bunny May Cry
Nice plastic chair
Thank you you two!
~~and somehow it's already doing better than the last two I posted~~
Have 2 seconds of animation done in the span of two days
New short form animation up on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXoi8FwHZ34
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Aight here's an extra couple of sheets for the character (second one in the reply below) https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1544854532735336448?t=AZKSWVBDm4cjLf2CpKdvFg&s=19
So whatcha all think of the final design
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1544469320503369730?t=u2Q7q5L5DlR4r0Ly2D4ObA&s=19
Don't drop that mech it's precious
them eyes
Hmm I wonder if this is an eye
Hmm I wonder who's wearing it
uwu what could this mean uwu
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1543560037087559684
Cuuuute
Perhaps one of the crudest things I made but goddamn if it isn't a mighty cutie
A starting setup for....something idk
This must be like
The 3rd or 4th time I gave a character a semi-realistic firearm
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1548641654583746566?t=CKZZQNT8bWOzlxLENg0Bjw&s=19
and i'm taking five bucks from you
No five bucks for you either
5 or 6 other characters with weapons
I also have like
🔫
Okay no five bucks for you
What's his name then
Okay
Five bucks for anyone who remembers this boi
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1547358704147767296
But def the first to deal with the individual bots in the sets
To my knowledge I'm def not the first to dabble into rebuilding this set
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1554511947747545092
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1552818909396467714
Imma just share this one screenshot

Putting this head together as this angle was a nightmare
They have this nice fluidity and smoothness that most other Sentai mecha can't match with their blockiness
Gaoranger's mecha are probably some of my favourites
*'"Complete! Gao Icarus!"*
Exo-Force was the jam
Ah yeah
And Neo Getter 1
Oh but do I see a Gunbuster
That's a lot of plastic robots
~~This is what happens when your creativity starts spilling out and you can't control yourself~~
Used the Cyberverse Shockwave model for reference
Or I guess closer to Galactic Man Shockwave given the colours
Yup big ol' Shockwave
Oh oh yeah
I also built this yesterday
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1551305575132282881?t=tudD7ukFU7ZiV4O3KC3pfg&s=19
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1551137137415831559?t=LC1rw4WmtGlc5EcUgIww2A&s=19
The hand are also glued to the hips so the limbs hold each other up
I used glue to hold it together
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1549692240817168384?t=h3-fP9TQdq0ezLAdXXCB7w&s=19
I haven't seen or eaten many so I can't judge
technically but basically yes
(oh yeah they have a sentient mechanical watch belt now)
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1557377150071750656?t=c9HiL-IjeTA6eDRtkfvDOA&s=19
Welp this is coming along
In the future I'll probably find some way to do the hair in one piece
Okay and I think that'll do for today's class
Still kinda rough but it's def coming along
Oh yeah progress update two more 'strands' of hair now
Trying to model something on my own the first time
Just like
I'm currently learning atm yes
Welp hair's def coming
Aight time to level up
Welp there you have him
Welp I'm followin tutorials and I'm certainly making some pants
https://mobile.twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1556200537036562434
Aight let's see which one of these four attracts to your heart
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1555869040425435136?t=_sfi6m2pFMpFYJ1SPUE8hQ&s=19
One of the best characters in Tamers hands down
Also got this guy updated
Kre-O MOCs in general are not common
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1562578071793725443
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1561483185887891458
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1561313862930124800?t=6Okg826cWMmb5XwlA-Bhqw&s=19
wait it is?
I mean it's okay?
ehhhhh
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1561118677063405569
This one's for one of my old OCs named Gli-X
Oh yeah and redesign time
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1560208648508514304
Probably the only time where the head's not like wider than the shoulder line
Welp here's one digitized
Really?
Somehow I'm now turning more to badass and cool Nova rather than shykid
Welp haven't done one of these in a long time
It's handdrawn Nova :)
Glow in the dark eyes on robots/dolls, the next innovation
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1558233009899323399
yikes
And I didn't save any of the progress so
Unfortunately
That's gonna be a no
I tried some other options but Blender ended up crashing
I was trying to actually model a face of a character
But when using sub division + smooth shading 
I ran into a few....shading issues?
Like
Something kinda major
Anyone willing to help me on something on Blender
So
I'm thinking some kind of umbrella that can switch between melee and defense
She'll also be getting a weapon like Jade
A goth girl named after the gem Ruby
Yup a goth girl
Time to reveal a character I've been working on in secret till now
One step closer to the ultimate Rider System
Looks very nice so far
||I don't think he's quite there yet||
||You gotta remember that at this point he is a man driven by insanity and vengeance against his daddy||
~~My dad just got me Den-O from his short trip in China~~
Very nice
Damn your baby starting to object you now
Okay so they weren't being douches
If he was being an ahole then just screw him
What did the judge say
Dang you be with someone cosplaying one of the best Rider forms in Zero-One
nice meme
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1567532595239424001
Very nice design of a belt
Cool build
Of course he would choose this, cool drawing tho
I'm sure this is a mood for some
Aight speedround time
~~You have now surpassed all Riders~~
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1566186016368496640
Probably one of the first times I did this sort of design
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1565791019508965377
It fits
The suit had those as decals too so
~~oh hey its yurusen and takeru with a random red-armoured girl~~
A *very slight* colour change here
Probably a few more things in the future to optimize this for animation but we're basically done here
AYO THAT IS LIT
~~When they give you the yellow glowy eyes you know something gonna go down~~'
I made some new leg components so his legs can point perfectly forward as supposed to inwards
If you thought the weapon was big before...
Welp the details are back
~~He got them Infinite pointy shoes~~
So you like the one of the right because the legs have more detail
It's time for a design battle
Okay I have been workin on this since this morning so imma so that's it for today
Not bad
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1569965744154382337?t=cyowhOQtiZBZjYJbwK3S2w&s=19
This is one hell of a smile
Starting the character sheet
After solidifying the concepts on my moodboard and sketching it to my liking here's the new design for Ghostie I came up with
He has to put the lance somewhere whilst not holding it
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1576541258553573377
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1576237843449786369
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1575627764878561280
Yeah that looks better
Big ball looks like an eye
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1580995909306830848
That VTubers are covering almost all the time
The songs from Kanaria
Y'know
Have her cover either song then
Okay
king or queen
Jesus this thing's gonna need an additional layer of paint when I get home later
This is probably one of the only characters created last year that I have multiple versions of to do an evolution sheet with
uh oh take cover
I am not gonna start it tonight cause I have other work to do
Aight the sketch is all done
Aight time to start on this then
I think I've reached the apex here
Once my schedule can free up a bit
I will
what
Does this look quite... interesting
Oh my
So I decided to set up another "Let's Make an OC" challenge thing and um
the yakuza are superior
what can we say
Gotta be the Stacheplier huh
From a far away shot I almost thought her smile looked like a stache
Lemme know what you think
Aight concept 2
Just added a few things to link back to previous versions of the character
This is just me shaping up rough ideas
Just trying to figure out what to do for this redesign
Still in the concept design stage
I've been prepping for next month in advance for a new project
Guess what
yeah many thanks :3
ah
and thanks :)
when was the last time you looked lol
Decided to test out the new Asset Warp Bezier handles for Animate (only on the hair tho)
That'll so perfectly
That'll do
Y'know what
Make her like
The size of a cat
It's a natural part of the process
That's what we all feel
not bad
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1591036729917837315
seems a little darker now
First version started all the way back in summer 2021
And just for one comparison here is the legacy wall
And NGL she is turning out to be my favourite
It's another redesign of one of my characters
Yup
I shall give you all the first sneak peak into this month's project
Or is that like
Nothing we a model
That's a lot of tris
how big
Even in its home country
And it didn't do too well
Yeah
i thought you meant a 3D fantasy online game
oh
Phantasy Star or something
Is it like
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1586858000161116161/photo/1
I didn't tell anyone but
I made a MOC over the last few days
That's some motion blur alright
I was joking
you have the Bandai logo
There are legit like a ton of things I probably could've improved on
Welp I got this thing I did
I think I did pretty well
So I basically told myself to make a jester MOC while making the thinnest build I could possibly muster with only technic and CCBS pieces
Tasty
Sorry for late response but thanks!
And possibly blend in with others better
At one point he decided to take over an armless and headless robot so he can have that can stand more stably
Him being like a pile of sentient goo
So this one's origin is that this Prism was an experiment in creating a unique form of lifeform
And this is the concept design to represent that concept
Well around last month I decided to reinvent the concept of the character again
so idk how many of you remembered but my main OC is Prism
3ds max
She also told us not to do anything with legs so we could avoid doing walk cycles
So we could actually focus more on animation rather than design
Also why she told us to keep it simple
Part of the assignment
Sorry for the late response but yup
There even is like the non-functional flash
The design concept was literally "Camera that can waddle and punch on fists"
exactly
It's a rather simple design but the instructor did tell us to keep it simple
Thanks
yup
Aight so imma show a little bit of what I'm working on for college (cause I can)
That's a very clever bit of parts usage
Ah
Pretty good bulk
I see a Knights Kingdom helmet on top
So in the progress of a winter redeco for her
(no specific lore for this btw, just got this idea after doing the pose)
Was making this whilst watching college mate's art stream
Boss character from Cuphead
Dang I didn't know King Dice has a skeleton
Yeah
I have now learnt how difficult faces are to do
Thanks
Apparently I'm one of the furthest people ahead with this
So I guess I'll provide another update for my character
~~An oven is just a larger, more spacey microwave when you think about it~~
So I have a comparison shot of these two versions of the same character
~~i cant believe sonic has finally died for good~~
Ngl they lookin kinda cute
piza
Oh yeah I've also been working on this as well
Arms with no hands but arms nonetheless
They have arms now
Long legs, tiny little torso
I had to remodel the legs entirely cause the previous attempt's geometry was so messed up
Okay I'll share one for now
seems interesting
hmm
I swear to god Android 18 was not in my moodboards
Oh yeah my instructor also said it reminded him of Dragon Ball
And I guess if that was my first attempt I guess it can't be that bad
I have become very accustomed to character sheets and turnarounds
Yeah
I could like 
Try to do a proper 3D model for an OC if I want to
Well if I still want to do 3D stuff
I may switch back to Blender once I finish my course
We only could use tools like push/pull, flatten, relax/smooth
Gotta say, fairly impressive
Though I have seen videos of such
I only have like
Limited knowledge of Blender sculpting before I switched to 3ds max for the course
3ds max
Nope
Luckily the hair might be a breeze in comparison(?)
Took a lot of freeform shaping and nudging vertices to get it to this point
It was the part of the course I was most looking forward to
TADA 
ISN'T THIS SO COOL
~~my god am I a zoomer~~
uh oh
6 fudging tries but i did it
dang tentacles with eyes
That actually looks pretty good
oh
Okay close enough
Chocolate cookie dough?
oh
my mind is thinking of something that it should not be thinking of
...
the monster truck that can bite your booty off
are they
crisis averted
okay good
uh oh
It's a finger excerise
That's what Lego does to you
Why is he threatening to shoot me
And oh yeah he can spin now
Cool
ouch
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1608990437439856640?s=19
This is like
Anime version
These proportions are not ones I'm used to drawing
Legit tho once again
T-pose on y'all
I underestimate how much my normal character proportions are so...deformed?
Lemme tell you these proportions are not quite what I do often
Is it weird I have barely drawn anything with this close to human proportions before
More like creativity
All the details are captured perfectly
So I did not expect her to actually show up with this
That didn't work out
Like one time I showed her a reference sheet and said like
I was showing it to a plush maker
It's legitimately perfect
It's a full sized figurine of my OC (Prism)
So this is what my mum brought back for me as a Christmas gift
They sell a bunch of offbrand Lego sets at Hobbycraft
So imma have to mess around with stuff like morphers
(took us long enough)
Next week our class is going into rigging our characters
Oh yeah that reminds me
ooo buff
Actually wait here's a better screenshot
This is a screenshot of the AE timeline
I shall give a piece of evidence of how fudgin much I want this college project to sound good
Milk
Like I said
I have a lot of ideas in my mind for storylines and plots for series
But there ain't no way I'm getting it done any time soon
Same thing here actually
I'm probably just making a bunch of excuses but
This design kinda stemmed from the figure
Keeping the essentials whilst condensing the design to something more manageable
I do too
But I did kinda want to simplify this design to something more manageable for the eye
The old one wasn't bad but there was just too much detail
(btw this is the actual height of the two rigs next to each other and not me putting on dramatic effect)
jesus christ since when did he drink all my milk
Yeah you'll need all the ventilation you can get there
Okay good
I hope it isn't too cold there
||Just make sure he doesn't get his head shot off||
~~it's almost like it was meant to be~~
the kid and grandparent
YEAH
Oh hell ya
||Both look really good as well||
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
a fellow HnK fan hell ya
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1615822065273298944?t=vahrifrVCJWS60t-3GFpYw&s=19
It was kinda technically a major disaster
I doubt HasTak would be so willing to revisit the Aligned continuity to this extent
Also I know about the Legacy line but
And it is done
Yes
Let's see who recognizes this
So I got bored and made this clay model today
They look kinda legit
Haven't bought any of them but
They also make like tanks, other planes and other types of craft
I think another one's a Voltswagen or something
Which all are kits to make legit licensed vehicles
sounds pretty good so fat tho
that is a lot
Not sure if I should upload it onto YouTube tho
Copyright's getting trigger sensative these days
I can also do some lip syncing practice as well
With an actual vocal song
Maybe I'll try to do audio alignment for my next animated thing
The essence of it was good enough for me
I couldn't be bothered lol
Y'know what here ya go definitive version
welp here it is then
Or maybe one hour
One sec
Welp um
I animated him doing a kazotsky kick dance cause tf2 music gives me brainrot
This is like your entire room
Wait so
where's the bathroom
where's the kitchen
Guy's really livin the minimalist lifestyle here
So after several passes 
I finally got to this version of the walk cycle
welp i made a walk cycle
The Nova you drew for me was absolute 1000% adorbs
Also c'mon you are good
Never crossed my mind but upon second glance
Kinda does look like it
May or may not remake her old rig
Big head and big eyes lookin a bit dated now
her design's still one of my favourites
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1617172358946590720
Very nice
https://twitter.com/KiraPrismArt/status/1622725170577264640
Weapon: GIANT LASER GUN THAT LOOKS LIKE A GIANT GUITAR
Sounds cool
Basically from the ground up
Yeah I kinda spent all night rebuilding Jazz
That means you *can* rebuild models to your liking 
Such at this
Luckily because of Kre-O's more fluid approach to models
But they did still have a long ways to go
Kre-O is much better than BTR in a bunch of ways, like not trying to force a transformation and both models genuinely looking better for it
This robot mode kinda makes him look like a metal-plated penguin
Welp car mode done
Okay I know this was one of Kre-O's first year sets but srsly these sticker placements suck
That's a lot of silver
I'll like 
Build it like how it is intended first
Then attempt to rebuild it using the same parts
Welp got a decade old not-Lego set
I always kinda had a heart on for design styles like these
thanks :D
quite in the early stages but he lookin dapper now
huh
Sick
You either like Transformers or you don't buy it
For both Kre-O and BTR
Acquiring a crap ton of videogame franchise licenses
And for a while now
Yeah Mega Bloks kinda fills in markets that Lego could not
So they join forces
And now Hasbro has just given up to try and compete with Lego
Yeah Mega Bloks look really good now
All they were are attempted cashgrabs on Lego
They kinda never did lol
Yeah that's
Kinda a low bar
That's why probably one of the most common things people do with these is rebuild them
Like this one's in the third year of the brand

it didn't and it never looked much better
Hasbro print of approval and everything
yes
yikes
Still some of them are...
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Tho I guess they didn't have much experience and they were likely using different inspiration for the robots so
Yup
(I've already dismantled this btw)
Looked better than the original build
It was...kinda successful
Like over a year ago
I actually did try to make a devastator using only the parts in the kreo set
Menasor's combination is probably easiest to construct cause like
The limb bots kinda just plop onto a frame rather than became part of the frame
well kinda
Modified Dragstrip by a lot (to the point of complete rebuilding) and modified his connection to allow for Scramble City combining
dead end's the wrong shade but I had like no maroon pieces left
Which eventually led me to building a deformed Menasor
Welp I decided to take apart a Lego TF I had for a bit and rebuild it into something random
Or confidence in my body to pull off anything
don't have the courage or guts
just one problem
cosplay seems fun
hmm
Now go slice some of them dust people up
Bloodeh epic
An absolute duo
Yeah I built Dragstrip and Breakdown earlier this morning
Welp I am reassembling this team into proper transformers this time
oh bloodeh epic
Probably the only time I've made a semi-accurate version of a Ferrari car
This one in particular is named Wildrider/Break-neck
Welp I tore apart my Menasor but decided to rebuild one of the Stunticons as a mini
how do you add friends?
okay
sure
and only if the enemy is 20% or lower
I can really only complete normal raids right now
time to see what i can for raids
alright here i am
i am because of my overload of memorias
who here has pulled in friend gachas
hmm speaking of gachas...
maybe but they cost a lot
also about storage...
They seem to not be in plentiful amounts
also not related but isn't it a bit difficult getting enhancements? (ATK, HP, DEF)
oh i see
which slot did you put her
oh i see
ah i see
<@!676272618839605249> also dude slightly rude
i need two more copies of some cards then i can get them to lvl 60
should i save the 5* tickets i can get
(sigh) the world just keeps punching us in the gut, doesn't it
i was in a situation where i had to choose between EdgeBiki and Bridal Miku
yup
alright then
yep...it happens to everyone sometime
then again i don't have many duplicates so...power it is
Hmm...probably Intel
anyway onto raids
welp
i didn't know much better at the time when the game first came out
so...what should i do with my AoT cards then
probably pretty bad moves
Bride Maria and AoT Hibiki
yep
well the other two 5* are cards from other events
hmm what to do...
oh i see
although i can get three more from daily
welp i only have 37 stones
oh damn
i have enough gold balls to buy a few 5* cards
maybe if my luck is good
weird name i know
Yep
got it
lemme go clear that up really quick
oh whoops my friend list is full too
is it bad to let the ai do the work in a raid?
i think..
doing okay for the raid
anyway...
(sigh)...this game is starting to feel like it's taunting us every which way
i'll just leave it in the charger so i can join back
dont worry
oh huh
my phone just died
oh crud
SELLING SOME OF SYMPHOGEAR CARDs
you know what was the dumbest decision i made
oh i see
who is
let's go people
time to do this
alright
and it was only because of the 5* ticket
i only got one copy since the first time i got her
...i feel like i'm severely behind everyone else even tho i started at the game's launch
well at my current level it's the best team i've got
i'd say my heart team is doing the best
right now i can only defeat the easy raid solo
is it bad that i can't do much even in a normal raid?
...i can barely do 200,000 damage to a normal raid
back to raids
okay people
should i keep all the 1 - 2* memoria cards?
i mean it also makes it easier to get to 30 card gacha mission
uh...nani?
where do you put all the others
daily song stones
I meant i can't get the stones because all the cards I have are maxed and i have no duplicates
i meant ATK, HP, DEF
not those enhancements
and i can't get enhancements
it's just all my cards are different from each other
i do
because all my cards are maxed out
okay so i can't get my daily stones
also did i already say sp quests are kind of a joke (except for 5* ones)
wait till they do it
kay then
oh
if somebody robs it imma explode
uh hold it until i'm finished
these sp battles are kind of a joke now
i should be done in 5 min or so
sure i'll go do it
Time to do my daily stuff
Alright then
you can thank me for completing it
to make my first lvl 70 possible
at least 5
I need 5
Hey I got a good number of Giga Rainbow Crystals
D.O.N.E.
wait which one you doing?
i got this
don't worry
i'm alllmmmooost there....
okay then
Okay...I got it down to red
alright then
okay
you can hang in there while i deal some more damage
okay then
can't you use recovery items
okay then
let me handle this power raid then
okay then
but i shall keep fighting
i am struggling at this raid
so anybody else joining Kat's raid
gotta try the raid two more times
died
and i just dies
*raid gacha
i think you have to gacha the rain gacha
died
me XD bikki just dies
crud
oh right whoops
actually how do you earn tix
i got some more duplicates
okay i've got two to spare
time to use regular gacha tix
alright
nice
and i got a second ingnite kirika
Yay i got another Ignite Chris
I got a new Maria P card
oh
and i've got a few regular gacha tix just in case
okay i have 3
but there's no guarantee i'll get the same cards
hmm maybe
hmm should i use my gold rice on 5* tix and spend them or keep the tix
nice
alright then
who's ready to do another raid
anyway
she's still at lvl 30 without lb
don't worry
why not
i was forced to spend some after my 3* were all maxed out without limit breaking
yep
yay i got the stones
so i can do this
omg i finally limit broke a 3* card
crud
I'm a baka
Oh wait
also i don't whale
i already cleared out the whole store in that event
which miku
yes and I can't enhance any gear cards because no duplicates in my possession
i am trying and failing to make any effective progress on cais' raid
mate my username may not suggest it but i don't have a western name
the only thing i find racist about koreans is bts
naw
imma do cais and kazusa first then
okay then
have either you or kat set up raid invites yet?
alright people let's do this
gotcha
wait real quick
you followed me
Uh.....
uh.....
yay
okay mine is 724640356
nevermind
oh wait
how do you check for your ID
wait
minute
uh hang on a miute
alright kazusa imma help you with this raid
gotcha
yup i can see the struggle
wanna make a space for me too
i might shuffle between the two
imma do cais' one now
but uh can't find the carol one
yay we a squad now
uh sure
<@!127991170201681920> uh where
let's go raiders
okay then
i don't even have her yet...
<@!140931012061298688> I think I already said this not too long ago but I haven't spent a single penny since the launch
cais' one is getting close to completion too
i suppose getting this far without spending money isn't too bad...
hmm i see
not one
i actually haven't spent even a penny on this game
...
but i've been playing the game since the global launch
yep that makes me the worst here
i have 5 at lvl 60 sitting in limbo
0
cause i have NONE
then im the odd one out here
?
but overall
both
has everyone here got at least one lvl 70 card
not very impressive compared to most here
loads of my cards are stuck at lvl 60
but i'm going up against carol
look at some of my scores on some raids
i'm pretty sure i am the worst performing player here
i haven't even done 50,000 damage
right now tho
i see
okay then
but i wouldn't exactly say my performance is stellar either
well she doesn't
all she needs is some giga melody and i'm good to go
my maria is almost ready
omg
Did Cais'
i got it
me too
THE MORE YOU KNOW
<@!192432957946855424> welp i've been using 10cp this whole time
well i don't think i'm gonna beat
oh
imma do cais now
reawrds
you can check the reawrds
yup
since i'm not gonna beat it
um there should be less than 300,000 for kat for anyone who needs it
trying to complete kat's right now...
i paused it to the yours
you never know the day you will need them
welp might as well have them
https://discordapp.com/channels/336297387863703552/680064266539499535/700057583582445682 Too bad I cant do anything with them right now... ;-;

So RNG CAN be good...

the first time
i had to rely on revivals to get me through
wow you doing better than me
How many lvl 70's do you have

i'm open to start any raids if you want me to
who's joining me
ok imma grind for some LU material
my goodness this is hype for me
oh my god this maria card can counter now
<@!174272493777977344> Uh okay then
What's this all about?

wait
but i just wanted to have a lvl 70
maybe...
Finally did it

It is time
or so it seemed to me
nope he increases in attack power
yeah
Okay whoever beat it thanks
Sorry if this raid was too much for you to handle
i couldn't attack for like 3 turns
yep same
yup
yeah i use different usernames
aw thanks
i could help as well
wish i could say the same...
imma try to bring it down a bit it further just as a little aid
although I kinda need help on my own raid right now
considering i have no XDs LB'd yet
hmm im not exactly in a rush to get them
Uh do you need it?
Sorry I'm currently doing one
i will help you out a bit
i can see you're not having much luck taking it down either..
You can go
Okay
You people wanna do the honours?
Not the best but I'm sure you guys can beat it

okay i'm gonna need ignite bikki to get more powerful
although don't be too impressed when i finish my three attempts
you get to finish it off
imma do a raid
now it's time for me to return the favor
okay i've been able to finish your raids
gotta love the power
Giga Power and Giga Rainbow
Yeah i did
and i got some giga crystals
it dead
yep punched it
time to beat crow human guy again
sure
a crow with a human body?
also i know these bosses may have came out later in the japanese version in different quests but what the heck is the Gram Buster boss meant to be
Oh right
So Int
Actually which class is the best to get 70's for
Oof
Oh
Well I have a 4* Miku at lvl 60
Now I don't know which banner to roll for
Biggest regret in my gacha life
3*
Cause she barely feels upgraded at all
Okay now I feel making my P Maria lvl 70 was a bad idea...
although im not sure what i got for rewards was worth it...
Goodnight raiders
Imma go to sleep
Anyway
Yay we buds now
Okay
you have too many followers
i can't seem to follow you
um
goodnight raiders
imma go sleep now
anyway
and basically all my prior decisions in this game
just like the lvl 70 maria i made a thing today
yes
i think it's because i roll lots more 1 card rather than 11 card
ever
that never happened for me
oh
wait dupes?
"i think i might be cursed..."
anyway
my luck is unfathomably bad
annnnd only giga rainbow and power 😠
alright time to see what i got
got it
okay let's go

and hope to the RNG gods that i get good stuff

Right now my Int Team needs major improving

i kinda need to refill my giga melodies again
that sucks
oh
<@!114081181611458563> hey can you save it till the last bit of health?
i don't have him as a follower or am following him
I can't beat it on my own even with 10CP
Can somebody bring down Cais' one enough?
Okay then
can somebody do the power one again? I need some more giga melodies
i need to refill some
speaking of which...
that's a LOT
my goodness

yay got her
and xd bikki has been lb'd once
Ignite Biki, XD Jii, and Maria
3 5* of my current team

4 5* on my team
i'd say my P team is decent at the very least
my first solo normal raid
welp then
i think i can probably solo this round
wait
ok then
then how bout leave the final hit to me
oh
i don't really know rewards work
that should be all right i think
ill let you know when it'll be open
imma start a normal then somebody can wack it
hmm better do one of those then...
I keep getting giga miracle but no mega and regular

emphasis on 'try'
i'll try and beat her

kazusa get in quick

Heh Pokémon

i think this morning i got over 1.3 million
damn
what score so far
<@!114081181611458563> yay we buds now
me?
Lemme come as well
okay now im convinced i have bad luck 24/7
considering how many i already have
definitely not a ripoff
wow more rainbow stuff
don't mind if i do
okay then
no pausing?
wait now
okay then
Still no luck
I even used some tix
I rolled twice
Well I'm never getting anywhere
only got one copy from the first roll
tried getting xd maria
i seem to have horrible luck when rolling
although if the boss is at lower health
i'll go then i guess
sakimori/sword
not what i meant but okay
...
no
yeah...
yep
you know quartz isn't a made up thing for minecraft right?
we don't talk about minecraft
in here
the hell was that guess
wait really?
Also
I was even worse
Yeah
So it was still cruddy
Even then it was a 3* base
The only lvl 70 I got was maria
Even my 5* ones
Most of my cards...are cruddy to say the least
As a result
Without consideration of LB'ing them
I rolled to try to get all cards
guess what I did?
go look at my old self
if you wanna see a bad player
along with many others
this guy a champ
yep
try to pause before the battle
tho to make sure more people get the reward
you can get the 'hunt' reward
if you get somebody who got the boss down to a slither of health
that way you know when they will start a raid and when they will be open
try to friend more people in here
how many people in here do you have as followers
well try to
you know what sniping is?
ok
?
<@!255902541466828801> you good
yeah that
unless you use tix
EVER
DO NOT DO SINGLE ROLLS
whatever you do
doing rolls at the wrong times
which brings me to my next big mistake
and im saving all my stones for xd serena
Tho I have to rely on others' lvl 70 cards to get through levels
Progress is slow but steady
Trying to learn from my past mistakes
I made a brand new acc
In fact
God I'm just terrible
And I played this game since launch...
Couldn't do it ever
Welp
Not yet anyway
Now raids can't be solo'd
No easy mat for me
As a result
I ignored it
Yep
Guess what I did for that
That made raids for first week dead easy
There was a bug you might have heard of
I ignored the first week for raids
Also
God I was rotten
imagine the amount of stones I wasted for revives...
I played all the replays right after finishing the first run
Yep
Welp guess what I did
Do you still have replays for the main quest?
A
H
C
A
G
Well here's one answer
(X-Drive Shirabe)
You mean XD Jii?
and i barely poke these guys
and i haven't spent a single penny
i've played this game at launch
don't worry....you're not alone...
plural
PS4's
yes
some people here spent PS4's
a lot?
how much have you spent
> Got myself new cards from the Miku event (I may have spent a bit more money then I should've)
<@!170720313619775488> uh about this...
i am an idiot
oh whoops
then you will know when they will open raids
follow some people here
well here's something that might make your life easier
yup
raids are how you get LU material
ill give you a guide
uh sure
im not really of much help
well you can ask these guys for help
okay then
tho we should carry our discussion here <#673253184885489696>
if you can consider this home
make yourself at home
nice to meet you
hello ppl
The dragon is a major pain in the ass
jerk is an understatement
I can see bonking raids has become somewhat of a lingo now...
You can refresh
Time to find matches you can win against
Yeah that too
Many people here can tell you how much of hell it is
And trust me
pvp is basically hell
And pvp
Yup
That's the magic formula
Self-control
Got nearly 2000 stones for it
I'm saving up for the Serena event
Yeah
And I ended up for 5* cards that aren't LB'd at all
Yup
...I spent no money on that acc either
By many more banners
And amplify them
Take your reason for your cards
Well...
...I ended up restarting from scratch and making a new account a week or so ago
Wanna know how hard I learned my lesson
I learned this the hard way
Then go crazy
Well try to save up for a banner you actually want
Ah I see
I'm looking forward to getting XD serena
That's basically how most of the banners work
Tho the first time will always guarantee at least one
...yeah basically
It may take you over 10 rolls to get enough copies to MLB her
Tho hope she has a good guarantee
That's just about it
Yup
Wait
Yeah that's her
(possibly more to come)
Well yes and no
ok nevermind i killed it
Okay who wanna whack it

You can only bonk bongos or potatoes
Besides
Too....c-cute.... can't....live....
I see a parody of THAT ad
we need more bayonet charge fanart
load of precure art
shuffling between Precure and Symphogear art I see
we need more riderformers
I'm seeing that ZABABA W art again
<@186660127825330177> (sigh) fine...do what you have to do
You trying to go 10,000 pieces an hour or something
<@186660127825330177> mate slow down
I'm not the youngest here
oh look

weirder
no that's going backwards
weirder
no way they be weirder
come on
why does this exist
Well I don't really have as much of a liking for it anymore
oh right
right
it's natural
hmm might as well do sord next
the last thing I want is to do art I'm not proud of
yeah I'll try to space them out
okay I will
just maybe
maybe I might make the others
hmm maybe

You're welcome <:ShirabeWink:672661604319363103> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So they could be wrong
Again they're rough translations
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> "What a big discovery-dess!"
<:ShiraBean:736607747834904667> "Ah, this feels cool."
The second image roughly translate to...
<:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830> "Giving myself shade-dess!"
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604> "What are you doing, Kiri-chan?"
So the first image roughly translates to this
Apparently the first line Kirika says roughly translates to "This'll help for shade-dess!"
Gimme a minute
Hmm
idek why they're doing this
Look at those stag beetle pincer-horns
That's some nightmare fuel
Yup
Time for fanfics to go wild

Knives won't work
Exactly
And there even further than that!
Why leave the knife at 170° when we can turn it to 180°
Why leave it mostly edgy when we can sharpen it *just* a little bit more...
Let's take it to 20

....I just said I don't have a favourite
In fact I don't really have a particular favourite character
But again Elfnein's not my favourite character
Yeah
I only chose Elfnein's colours because I like cyan
I only like her
I wouldn't say I love her
Uh
You mean *she*

Kerrik's a human being not a mathematical term

Hey
Too bad the show basically gave up on them after GX
Her role in 06 is just straight up confusing
(Aside from Miku)
Did Iguchi play any magical girls?
Hmm
Still tho
Not Madoka Magica
This is a reference to Healin Good PreCure
What
Probably not but
Should probably invest in a production plant
These two have the perfect friendly rivalry duo relationship
Clearly deserving of those over 1K followers

Oh wait the brand usually associated with *that* S?
How come even as Puffs they still look badass

Interesting crossover

Cause Hibiki's his surname
Yeah
It's way too much wholesomeness
I can't even
~~Probably because he's been turned into nothing more than an edge joke~~

Anyway
Tbf it's about as thin as string
Kronii has a chain
But Garie has a white headband

But Kronii has fangs
Garie has ~~Bae~~ sharp teeth
Fair

Starting to think they don't actually know *how* to post stuff here
...okay
I don't know if I can trust myself but I at least can trust you
(not including me cause I am not great artist)

GAMMAMON 
PRECIOUS BABY
Magical girl and mecha with singing really go well together
I guess this series proves
And it's still alive
Yup
Which is like a lethal combination
Is it that or the fact it's Chris cosplaying as Akane
Wait what
Like it's in mid-transformation
I think it's supposed to be coming together
https://twitter.com/ignitemam/status/1479108417575071749?t=cCc5JVLSmgrz1LF1nqPUmQ&s=19

No HibiMiku
No TsubaChris
No DMJii
And that's why she couldn't live
Kanade the harem protagonist
<@222517038042710017>
Maybe Kerrik has one tho
Not as far as I know
Where's the compilation shot of *all* the girls in suits
Okay look I like this post but
I'm not totally convinced you know what this channel is for
Bananium
Time for a new element
But rather a game
And he didn't even originate from an anime
There's literally like
Only 1 well known character with the same birthday as me

With one thing which uses relics and two being relics of their time
Quite the crossover
That is um
Coming in 2023
The Magical Girl Who Is Also An Average Worker
What can we say
Being a Magical Girl is a time crunch
You misposted stuff into here so many times I've lost count
Okay
His suit design is immaculate

birb
They'll be in Season 2
She'll trick both sides into collecting relics for her own nefarious ends
But secretly has Carol within her
Elfnein joins the good guys
Halfway through the series
And Tsubasa's loyal servant
He'll be the villains' ninja/spy
~~And have Chris turn human to fight alongside them~~
Taking the power all for herself
Overthrows and kills Maria at the last second
And then Miku being the second-in-command
The villain aims the revive Shem-Ha
Assisting the team
He can be the male supporting character
Maria as the overall ruler
Hibiki and Tsubasa as lower rank lieutenants
Then you have the evil faction
This is 
Actually really goddamn cute
I just straight up did basic analysis
Almost to tell that she has now risen out of her scared and often conflicted self to a hero full of courage and strength to punch through anything in her way
In direct contrast to the bright whiteness towards the top and at Neo Biki's side
With the black and red 'berserk' side being on the bottom and towards S1 Biki's side
I guess this is also reflected in the composition
Okay now it makes sense
And probably a bit less creepy
UM

I told him a bunch of times
I've been trying to tell them almost every time they post a series of non-art in this channel
Welp
You somehow untangled a knot
Cool
Kirizilla
1. Sorry some one beat you to the punch
2. WE DO NOT NEED COMPLETE FORM'S AESTHETIC ON ANYTHING ELSE
Ah hell no we ain't lettin her beauty be consumed by this

That's what I meant when I said red

I'm also seeing a lot of green
Interesting cast ngl
I mean I don't think restriction on movement is a very good thing for a sport that requires expert balance
Of course you would say that
Besides if you're gonna armour up go all out
It's for protection
Just because they had a good run in one XDU event doesn't mean they're a thing now
To be honest I really don't since they started making art of it

Oooooookay
I did not need to see that tonight
So why do people here more often refer to her as a hamster?

Did y'all start posting SM art because of the trailer for Cosmos
~~cough NOT ART cough~~
OMG I see a young Basa with her older self
Quite a bit of MariChris in the source link I found
YES
In the source
~~Don't break my heart like this...~~
Everything else in the collection is equally cool as hell
The "passing of the torch" theme is cool
I love this one
~~But oh no you have to pay extra DLC for the complete story~~
The source seems to be a compilation of pics
I'm not sure
Actually
Magic Knight Rayearth
Okay better
Also people need jobs and need wages to survive
Don't hold your breath
I don't have any images of them all
You could have them all in *one*?

Oh lord everyone is starting to look like everyone else

It's okay
I get that
So what's the problem
Or at least some
Don't most artists do redraws of older pieces?
I mean
How bout NOT breaking the rules for a change
Do it somewhere else then
Trust me it's hard looking back on that show without that thought
But Idk
This feels like Amu X Ikuto all over again
Honestly don't wanna judge too hard on someone's fictional romances
*S H E E S H*
Mikhris shall be the only thing that matters in this world
She'll be fine
But dang imagine Chris with a Dominator
Not a crossover I'd thought of
And apparently the artist really likes Chris
If that isn't obviously a Zi-O reference I don't know what else will be
And a Ziku Driver
There's a Ridewatch

The special thing about 5D's is that there's tons of bikes
Okay then
...Do you even know the thing about 5D's?
Then Kamen Rider or Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's better fits
And?
Is there any connection of the two that warrants fanart?
...
You keep a text file just for recommended pings?
Wait
I hope you like the ping sound then
I guess I just can't find the time and dedication to be concerned about other's interests, when I'm already stressed enough about mine

If Hibiki's going up Miku's going too
Y'know what here's the solution
Why would Hibiki wanna kill Miku
Wouldn't that be a bad thing tho
Nobody would live with that much goodness multiplied
I mean that would do better but like
Gotta find a way to take down Noise easier
And then they destroy the universe whilst still trying to outgrow the other

The shiny one with them thicc eyebrows
~~Don't blame me I am naturally dumb-founded~~
I was dumb and looking at the consoles it was on
Oops
Huh
Oh
Seems a bit counter-intuitive to have two franchises from the same company rival each other
But was developed by Nintendo
Yokai Watch is clearly meant to be like Pokémon
It's odd tho
Idk
Never had my 3DS with me long enough to experience any of the games
Yeah that happened
As long as Alien X is available
None of those watches could ever beat the Omnitrix
Still
Bruh
~~What is this Japanese Ben 10~~
Rather than having Yokai sidekicks
The one where they change into youkai
Oh right
~~I legit thought the franchise died before the 2020's~~
~~Those still exist?~~
Ngl
Been missing Whisper in the later issues
Isn't this just like
The coolest thing

Sunny side up
The tone of a mob boss
~~But the body of a young girl~~
I'm getting a Roger Rabbit effect from the Yokai models
How was it
Oh
~~Now to wait for the probably to never come Yokai Watch live-action film~~
"Nice try"
<@222517038042710017>
~~(which is something not many of us have the luxury of having on a consistent basis)~~
~~I wonder how it feels~~
Hmm
This dude I swear to goodness

From masks of power to simple helmets
2009 felt like more of a reboot than a continuation
~~Only for it to go all hocus pocus once they actually did it~~
Well if you didn't know any better you'd assume these were completely new characters
I think the big problem for me was
~~He's better than Gali Mistika at least~~
bruh
Oh right he was
Wait was he introduced in G
~~too late~~
https://twitter.com/Kaasknabbelkind/status/1547668144197550084
Until they saw that Subaru had boobs
~~I love one of the replies where someone said they thought she was Venti~~
Didn't recognize them as first ngl
Oh
Nice standees of...whoever they are
More gear VAs in Bandai stuff
Ah yes
(everyone dies of geeking)
~~You wonder why almost everyone I created has eyewear of some mind~~
https://twitter.com/tbsr_not_found/status/1548376282953818112?t=vCHnlgpaOOl-irQHqOM7ew&s=19
We need more art of these girls honestly
One of them's enjoying it
The other...not so much
You had a problem with Mari*addiction*?
I guess you can say
I did not realize you have now ~~betrayed the Maria clan~~
Ohhhhh
He's playing Xenosaga
Wait what about Das
What happened here
Yikes
~~Oh hey it's animation error YoungBasa~~
It's definitely 90's looking
What could've been...
~~No offense child but true Fine Maria is the bomb~~
how this crossover has never became we'll probably know but pretend we don't
It's not that Miku got killed
Miku killed Hibiki with cuteness
And Nabe really likes Carol so
it is Nabe art
Crossover art
Right
oh
I don't get it
I don't know her so I don't love her per se
She's either preparing for a small impact or checking her Twitter feed
That's a nice Turahk
(also never let Phos into Minecraft ever)
~~That'll be the least of their worries believe me~~
It took me a couple seconds to recognize that this is Gear art
Look cool
Tho I do have to ask
Why those two Riders for those two specifically
~~makes more sense than it there were hamsters tbh~~
~~It's definitely not Kamen Rider no~~
~~I legit thought the chain was actual chains until I inspected closer~~
https://twitter.com/nananichibonze/status/1566017657551212545
Interesting crossover
Both the FE protags and Bae's colours do match a couple of Build forms
Funny enough

who
This is like a very old case of where people saw Mario's face in Marble Zone
I'm fairly certain that's just like
The colouring style used for the image
Somehow just found this fanart when googling about the collabs
About that discussion in <#336310266654490624> ...

It's not like kids were the crews were thinking about when watching it
I mean they're both kinda unique takes on the mahou shoujo genre
thanks
ah
or rather is
actually who was the artist for that pic
~~or Yuri fans~~
~~Do not underestimate them gundam fans~~
Oh my
Hibiki legit looking at her awkwardly
A true legend
Oh damn
Wait so this guy worked on promo art for Halo 3?
Flexing on your senpai now eh
Also one that makes a lot of sense given how they're both the "little sister"
UCS stands for "Ultimate Collector's Series"
So what's with the "Ultimate" on the side of the box
Is it not
What she's currently playing with is something I'm fairly certain isn't in the set
So I see the box for the UCS Millennium Falcon
https://twitter.com/kiraki217_jpn/status/1201876237616140293?t=TVrYfNTQZIFl8fT7j0BFJg&s=19
Or I guess the orientation would be white and black in this case
Black and white
That's a big boi
Aight then lemme ask you three things then
Why is Lego still:
A) the largest toy brand in the world
B) a hobby thousands still partake in
C) something they would choose to do over 3D printing despite the fact 3D printing's cheaper

The dark haired duo
Oh that's a very good Carol
A half on half
That technically is how the Geats system looks like
Well I mean
We're gonna have tons of combos then
Oh god
Welp I guess this is your answer

Not to doubt Bikki's artistic skills but cuts that round and clean?
Who carved the pumpkin
Gotta ask tho
Her head isn't just the pumpkin y'know

You're gonna shove it in her mouth hole

<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
really excelled at that one
wow
How appropriate given the conversation we were having last night
Gotta always love more variants on Miku wearing Gungnir
https://twitter.com/nananichibonze/status/1588940091875295233?t=sjbE8AEv-WFEuqZxnc1JFw&s=19
still only just recently
yeah then
we just talked about this yesterday i think
okay please
🔫 <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Yeah she's usually not quite as much of a hands-on fighter
but certainly a breath of fresh air
Well I wouldn't 100% say jewel in the crown
It's like a
And it's a finishing move
It's a move performed by GaoGaiGar
I assume you know what move I'm talkin about
They shall perform Hell and Heaven on you as punishment
~~I can't believe you already forgot that's what Maria and Kanade's Gungnir could do~~
~~Also this is making me go wild of the implication of Sonic x Sticks fics~~
Certainly a group shot
It's um
AI legit brought back Green Miku
Suletta as Cure Black looks very good
awwwww
what the
dang what the hell did i do to you
I don't blame her tho
Yup that's the face of someone who's just lost it
Might as well destroy the world that gave you so much pain
Tho probably the most fitting person to destroy the world would be Tsubasa
Okay that makes slightly more sense
~~like nfts and ai art~~
including ones the site actually supports
yes
especially on DA
yes
Just pretend like
Whatever affected her like this also made her consciously do this
As much as I do object against AI art
It sure can come up with some...interesting ideas
Their skills are definitely impressive
Ooo very nice

That girl legit has 7 fingers on one hand
Seven Wives in Hand 
That's the title for the NSFW version
~~seven wifes~~
Or y'know
Who's the innocent one here tho
is it just me or is it getting steamy in here
https://twitter.com/otokam1117/status/1596659594750988288?t=79pQkKQWI8jEXk5hFT01yA&s=19
Interesting look
Symphogear but if Miku was the true protagonist all along
awww
~~it's like the original concept art, only less of~~
Kanade nerfed
absolute adorbs
awwww
yeah
The original concept designs for the Gears had the armour over the clothes they're wearing
And I don't know how those outward layers are actually hanging on
A translucent layer of leg sleeves or something on top of tights with swirly detail
There's like
So either fanservice or fanservice
That is absolutely adorable and precious
Awwww
I didn't know if the art specifically is referencing that
I knew the Yuki was JP Lumine
at least i think it is
haha va joke
that poster (?) almost seems conscious of the situation at hand
Aight this works way too well
https://twitter.com/BixelsWixels/status/1601757592161636353
You might as well make it a spectacle
If you're gonna make a disaster
and that's what counts the most eh
at least it looks pretty
but hey
~~its magic dont question it~~
So this will be how Ace will finally lose the DGP
This fits so much better than it should
chingles
Hibiki, Hibiki, Hibiki, Kanade, Kanade...
~~oh god Miku and Shirabe aren't gonna stalk them again are they~~
~~oh god i haven't even watched this film and im already feeling it~~
miku please youre scaring me
someone take away the virus from the back of her head before she harms someone
Interesting crossover...
Huh
Now *THIS* is a Christmas miracle

Why not have Pyra in Momo's outfit
She's been a mecha pilot before
Wdym
Why not
Bigger question is
~~where be your xenoblade kosmos~~
~~Since when did Kos-mos steal one of Heavy's guns~~
The horse this gal is about (Special Week) ||sadly passed away||
here's some sad news relating to this image
Tahu cool
Would people be offended if I call her Blonde Pyra
oh nice
Just like most artists
~~All artists but me~~
💀
~~im sure this baby wont be of any importance~~
awww
Underneath the sweet, soft smile
She packs quite the roar
Ayo what they doin to her
No I meant the Chris one
She just went all purple
Also a real interesting change to Chris' colours
This legit looks badass

https://twitter.com/DremStir/status/1329737460838846466
What about Hibiki
She just went insane
She doesn't even have the Shem eyes
you've become too powerful for it
let go of the sword
it's the know your meme image about magical girls
oh hey
it's like an oversized mp3 player
~~that is some serious old tech~~
dont do it hes evil
but hey at least ~~neither of them are dead~~
Amiya!
~~probably because they are a precure team~~
~~omg they're cosplaying the guys from pulp fiction~~
scrapnik island was hella cool
~~don't take my image I'm in the middle of dinner~~
The AU outfit is really unique and cool
Even tho my favourite Kiri outfit is still a toss up between GX and AXZ
Ngl
~~now all you need is maria~~
awww
This artist does a lot of Asuka X Manatsu stuff don't they
Oh yeah
||Ghost is the goat||
||OH HELL YEAH||
I legit can't whether the normal or creepy eyes makes this more unsettling
Well this is quite the switch
kinda like the detail of the x is now on the hat
Only problem is that she can't make you roasted marshmallows
I heard she's great as a ~~*campfire* substitute~~
Yeah

It could've been

We can appreciate them from a distance

Please
Chill
||omg there's an animation error youngbasa in there||
died again
...yeah they don't look the same age
But appearance-wise
never played the event or saw translations
The age gap between Chris and the kid
What's like
Also i dont wanna get too deep but
because they argued about axia's 'ship'
one of the people i follow apparently had their friend blocked by axia on twitter
Apparently they have a *real big* fond for the 'ship'
The Durandal Gear XDU event I believe?
That boy from like
and i thought that cliche was fiction only
geez
To a full on romance
I just don't know why someone would interpret what's supposed to be more of a teen helping a kid learn
Straight up Robo Madoka
Looks like it
omg cat doll
tanuki duo
The Iron Condor
I only have one set with me atm
~~lego i want these types of mech back please~~

rv_gachalist
oof
rv_mycardlist
at least you recovered now
i feel bad for you
be thankful she exists
that girl is always there to help you out
cause your creator isn't even alive yet
did elfnein make a time machine
uh question
i feel sorry for ya
welp
they went THAT far
yup
and then dumped it in the river
last night i saw the news they people tore down the statue of George Floyd
My friends don't seem to care/like my art
Besides
isn't comparing art kinda essential
And realise that it looks completely garbage compared to theirs
And then look back at my own stuff
And look at it as a standard
Because I look at other people's stuff
I constantly keep telling myself that I'm a failure
That's basically how I feel
"I just feel kinda useless as an artist"
"Jesus these person's better at art than me"
And then after a little while I say
I usually look at some art by one person
So
Okay
honestly I don't feel safe anywhere now
apologies
yeah that one was the one i was referring to
i read it wrong
oh wait
no im not joking
and make something that I can I'm proud of
it's time that I sit back
imma have enough whining how my art isn't as good as other people's
imma now make my own art
you know what
glad to hear it
good job
Oh
what?
Ah dude that sucks
Also I've lost the files for them
Not to mention the bad stigma MLP artists sometimes get
I guess I don't really want to post those
Now that I'm out of the MLP phase
Simply because it's posted on deviantart
That's also another reason why my friends don't like my art
Just dying quickly
It ain't dead
Well I currently have 13 watchers
Unlike many others
I barely get any comments
The only indications were favourites/watches
Cause I didn't know if people liked it or not
But I've just kinda lost the drive to
Maybe
tho I may have lost my passion considering I haven't posted art stuff in months
then go for it
I often just...do stuff about something I currently like
in school?
so I just used Power Point
Back then I didn't even have flash
really?
So what do you think?
Oh
?
I also have a DeviantArt if you're interested
They're a bit old but see what you think
Take a look at Colour Star (@HadrianLeong): https://twitter.com/HadrianLeong?s=09
See what you think
Go ahead
this is a person I followed
Yeah... that's kinda what I meant
You can probably identify my posts in the comments
https://twitter.com/MewKwota/status/1269822924912947201?s=19
I brung all this up because I was seeing a person's art on Twitter (somebody I followed)
What did he think?
But what if something you do is something they don't really like
Cause they're the ones who support you
aren't friends often one of the best people to judge your art and see if they like it?
it's just...if the friends I have at school right now don't like it...who else can I turn to?
I use Flash as a vector program
well kinda
even though that wasn't the point...
my friends didn't like it because they thought it doesn't look scary
One time I changed my Discord icon to change it to make it more 'halloween'
how blunt of them
hell.
the.
what.
Uh okay then
Isn't this channel for serious talk?
um guys
Really means a lot to me
Thanks for the talk
Anyway
oy don't go there
I may be getting quite unbalanced
I would lose it all
Even just for an hour
That I feel like if I leave here
Even more than my current school friends
The people on this server has been so kind and friendly
It's just...
And when you realise it
A month worth of schoolwork is all piled up
And now
That I forgot bout my schoolwork
Well I've spent so much time on this server
You're in my shoes
Well...
What if you lost the balance of doing schoolwork and hanging out with people?
Well
Some of us have schoolwork
In this time
So
The fact that a teacher would even think of coming to check on me personally at my home when they probably have other students to deal with back at school
Yeah
And guess who was there with my parents and police?
Luckily I was found
The next morning
And basically decided to leave my house
I had a fallout with my parents at night
Hell one time
However we did agree that I would stay back after everyone else has left to discuss further
She's planning on having a Google Hangout with some other pupils in the same year group
When I was in school
Yeah
One of which being one of my teachers
There's really only a few people irl who can really support me
This virtually only feels like the safest place I CAN be
And the ones that are don't really care much bout what I do
I don't really have many friends
My real life interactions have been lacking
tho if I were to choose I would ultimately go with the former
hmm not quite sure yet
Or just go with one testicle for the future
Either go with removing the infected one entirely and replace the infected one with a prosthetic
So now I have two options
Doctors said my left testicle turned black and was shrinking
I didn't come out of it unscathed
And it was a testicle surgery
I had a surgery
So
Hi
Use them
A "dropping point" and a "point of return"
There are two things in life
Come to Scotland
Someone would think that their own life is better own not existing at all
Even if you don't know the exact reason, it still feels horrible someone would do that
It sucks to hear that someone would even take their own life
Holy mother of hell
When did this happen?
Oh crap
I just hope you can get through this without being too hurt
So you've basically went nihilistic?
That must seriously suck having to go through
God
You didn't know this would've happened
Yeah
Even if someone was awful, they deserve to live
Again like I said
No one deserves to take their own life, regardless of what they've done
So it's only fair I give the same appreciation to you.
You all are good people to me.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Imma give you one too
Good to know we're all learning
Well I'm glad you two are on better terms now
https://youtu.be/3Ztj_4fFJck
I do have this video for anyone who doesn't know much about Dan Schneider.
I'm still quite unsure about the intensionality of it all.
With Dan Schneider...I'm still kinda split on it.
what
uh
Protests everywhere
It like really sucks
I guess it evens out
Yeah
I'd tell those people to listen to the government but then again the government doesn't listen to people's concerns and send its residents a nice dose of tear gas and brutality which also let to the death of a black citizen which are now making residents angry at the government so...
AND DON'T GO IN AREAS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO GET LARGE CROWDS.
And STAY SEPERATED.
> There are those who can't seem to get a grip of themselves
Again
There are those who can't seem to get a grip of themselves
That's how the world works
Welp
At least not at home
No
Yeah
Swords are banned
Yup
Like knives for cooking are fine
We can only hope it will lead into the right direction
No one knows the future
Join us
He basically said that Scotland wanted to do its own thing
Me and my dad talked about the way Scotland has been handling
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I think so
Anyone who doesn't wear a mask in England in a shop could get fined
Just read the news
Welp
Me?
Probably all of us
Please tell me you're not mortal enemies now
I see
Oh
What was the first?
SECOND DMJii pairing breakup?
Wait
I honestly just feel somewhat disconnected from my friends
I hope you'll be able to move on
My condolences
I feel sorry to hear that
I hope you feel better now
I'm sorry about that
Ah
<@192304778938679296>
But I need to full story first
I am willing to help you as much as I can
Just tell me what's wrong
I'm listening to you
Calm down
Okay
You okay?
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
I don't feel wishing for people's death makes us any better than them
I generally don't really condone to wish death upon others
But I wouldn't say any of these types really deserve to die...
Like a lot
I do hate certain people
Okay maybe not THAT far
How were they reacting to this like it's news for them NOW of all times?
Good question
The guy is having a hissy fit over not being able to show a tan?
What a bunch of selfish bastards
Wow
Yeah it feels less like an "I'm breaking up with you because I can't handle you" and more of "I can't let you suffer through what I'm going through"
Oh
And hope you can move on from this
Well either way I will give my condolences to you
Huh
Did you think she really dumped you for her eating disorder, it was it something else?
Ah I see
Have you tried contacting her ever since?
Did you think that was her true intentions?
What were her exact words?
What exactly did she tell you when you broke up?
I am so sorry for your loss
I am so sorry for both of you (especially Ten) who had to go through that
The Thai did this...
what
It just means you have it
It doesn't mean you are worse for having it
Just because you have it
Let it be a part of you
You shouldn't let your Asperger's hinder you
I won't let it **define** me
Even tho it hinders me
It's something I have
But it's part of me
If I had the chance I would break it out of my system
Here we go again...
Oh lord...
And that's totally ok
You're just speaking your own opinion on the matter
You aren't
You definitely did
But trying to force others to have the same beliefs as you does not and WILL not make you any of a better person than the ones you try to push back
And at times frustration can build up from the absolute rejection of those beliefs
People ARE entitled to their opinions and beliefs
I for one wholeheartedly agree with what you just said
Then you should let them know that you aren't
Apologies then
Ah
It will never
Asperger's doesn't make you any worse than anyone else
I'll just let you know this
We should just halt this before the flames ignite beyond control
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
The only other person I can discuss about it first is one of my teachers
Because he stated that he could possibly have it as well
No
Back then one of my classmates talked about the possibility of me having autism
Cause I've only just looked up this stuff
And my teachers
My family
My schoolmates
I just don't know how anyone else will react
And I'm somewhat scared to
I haven't
I am 90% sure I have Asperger's.
After looking through articles of listings of its symptoms, this is what I've concluded.
I only started thinking about this because someone DM'd me about possibly having this syndrome
Every school year shares the same PST
Every year has the same
Yes
What about it?
Similar to Harry Potter
Each of the houses has a pupil support teacher
Sorta
Apologies for not thinking about my words first.
Yet I made such an insensitive joke.
I should've understood your struggles.
I still feel I'm guilty in all of this.
Both of you were also talking about Vocaloid and how it managed to aid you through these hard times
Oh right
Episode?
I shouldn't have been so insensitive to his feelings
I should apologize
No
I assume they was some other chemical which may have reacted to the explosives and caused a much larger explosion
One that's not associated with Nazism?
It's just the social skills that aren't there
We have the academic skill
If anything certain traits help them in a particular subject of their interest
Don't people with Asperger's have average to above average IQ?
Yeah that sounds better
That's not good
I just realized Asperger's was named after a guy who was part of the Nazi regime
Continue your path into the light
No matter the distance
It's important to realize that every dark tunnel has a light at the end of it
No matter what happens
We will be by your side
We're here for you
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<@84811738653929472>
You can continue this privately
Okay time out people
They still exist
> I don't think I realized that compassion had more value than being a memelord until like 24
There are people out there who are just looking for someone to understand
Off to your next station
You should just keep chuggin ahead
No matter what delays you encounter
Just keep going
But if the tracks are still ahead
And the journey is over
You make your last stop
If you stop
The tracks are still there
I wouldn't even have the courage to do that
You stood for yourself
It's natural to have a breakdown or two once in a while
And it's never too late to correct course
A youngster doesn't realise what they were doing could be considered wrong
Seriously it's scary to think how some people still don't know why it's an offensive term
At least do it privately
If you're gonna continue
I'll say it again
I said this once
Please people
If only if it was that simple...
I've heard of at least one school in the US that has actually banned the dictionary
Matt Stone and Trey Parker?
But apparently EA doesn't get the memo
It is 
This is only gonna be the final nail
UK is gonna be beyond saving at this rate
It's like Johnson in a new body
~~Seems like the UK is still heading into a dark age then~~
Oh yeah she apparently switched to supporting Brexit
And apparently on her Wikipedia page she has "moved to limit trans rights"
So um
New PM for Britain
The British are jokes
If not 2040's
So um 
I guess we'll be back here in the 2030's
He ain't got much time either
He's like in his 70's rn
The wiki page is already updated
Omg
Yup
Also known as the Duke of Cambridge
William
Apparently Charles has an elder son
No I mean like
Once Charles becomes king
So who's the current heir then
Probably like
Within the next 10 days
Itv just announced it minutes ago
I think she's gone now
Um
Um
I think Prince Charles?
Seemingly not much better tho
She hasn't
So um
I guess we should dress up in black too
Actually like
Most main channels news are live now
Talking about it
Welp itv news is live now
On the one hand it is quite the shocker
On the other I can't really relate to it much
One hour she was announced to be real ill
Next hour she's gone
It all happened so fast
It's not easy to do
You're just trying to process it
You're fine
Including us
I mean
No one really expected this so soon
yup
"we are all devastated" - lis truss
And then everyone returns to their normal routine
It will be thought about for like
A few days
If not weeks
And then we'll start the Symphogear age
One long-term rule followed by what will be a relatively short one
So I guess we have lost two queens
Looks like Packed Lunch went on for so long that they're skipping commercials for this day's Coutndown
Countdown?
They have um
Luckily Channel 4 seems to have a different idea
ITV fr gonna halt all programming for their channel for covering on King Charles
Then how bout for a trend that only seems to be growing more and more like VTubers?
So why do some Twitter fan creators I see do exactly the latter
At least that way I can fit in and not feel like a weirdo in the middle of a crowd
I guess I should probably just
Make all Gear OCs rather than anything on my own
I swear if that was a law at least 3/4 of the people in the creative industry would be on death row by now
All because I didn't follow their laws of fitting in with work
Skimmed over
Everyone moves on to someone's probably better piece
Even if a channel where art is the only thing you can post
It's almost the same muted reaction for me
Usually in other servers
I keep thinking because I only make OCs that people just don't give a crap because they're not familiar with them
I admit I sometimes am so absorbed in my own problems that
I do forget others have them as well
Like somebody making a big 3D music video for a VTuber
Or a fan developing on a VTuber agency game
I even started to almost break down internally because I felt that nobody gave a crap about what I make and are focusing on people who have done better, more relatable things
I can feel you 
In fact I was just thinking of that one thing
About how nobody cares about what I made and just swiftly moved on to other people's posts
It was um
Quite underwhelming
Yup
Welp um
That was a nice visit from the queen
Welp bon voyage
I guess she's taking flight
The plane is driving up the runway
Okay welp
All I'm seeing on the Tele is a plane on a runway with soldiers and people
I guess the Queen's flying abroad
So um
So um
How's Patreon been doing prior to this point
yikes
Just like every one of us
She's still a person
Royalty or not
Why should other people also dying that's not her should be thrown away like garbage now
Yeah but
For something that can kill them if not treated ASAP
They can't wait for five months
...some people don't have five months
Closing food banks amidst rising costs of bills and inflation of food prices is like
Also
That should not invalidate the lives of others
I get the Queen's an important figure but
Like c'mon
I guess we'll know who to blame if someone dies of cancer on that day
Welp
So they would let the poor suffer to grab all the headlines because a royal member died
... bruh
Preventing people from doing sports
But is this really the best way to do it
I don't think silencing people for doing something they love is a good thing
Okay I get wanting to like mourn but like
https://news.sky.com/story/despicable-amateur-football-teams-in-sheffield-face-punishment-for-playing-after-queens-death-12697344
Welp
Queen's funeral
Yeah
(to be continued ->)
My goodness it's only the second hymn
They drop any of those things and someone's in for a public execution
uh oh someone forgot to silent their phone
Holy truck
My condolences
More like Suckerburg
People like him do not deserve to stay loose upon the world
I'm glad you're fine
All I heard before this was that they were BuzzFeed deporters
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
It's an SNL skit but made to turn people away from going to America
First poor entertainment, now poor treatment?
My god
Who is the big bad that our main team need to defeat once and for all
I can't even tell what the Endgame for the series is anymore
Lost all focus from what I've seen
The recent volumes have like
And that in turn lead people to turn away from the series and fandom
It just felt like
RWBY's fanbase was (and still is) super divided
Apparently some people didn't listen to the advice of not making shows run on for too long
And their other projects are just...there
why have a social media account if you don't want to do the thing social media accounts do
so like
so what does he use it for then
Does he consider any repsonse harassment or something
So what like
or does he some kind of mental problem if his response to criticism is blocking
actually insane
is this guy like
~~Apparently they never saw any other big influencers and know bad PR can mean disaster~~
oh my god it keeps getting worse
My god can RT get any worse
So he's apologizing for calling them a slur
Not for the fact he's being treated like shit
Is this another case of "they're only sorry they were caught for the crimes they committed and not sorry for the crimes themselves" thing?
so he deliberately makes himself look worse than he normally does
wow
How he always looks like he just woke up in the morning
there is one thing we can make fun of him for
wait no
Truly the Lizt Trussworthy PM
Lis Truss be gone
Stv be live now
Welp
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
And I wish you the best of luck in your writing endeavours, just be sure to know that people can't hate you that easily
Thanks
But make sure to take care of yourself as well
It's okay to like mind those a bit
You shouldn't be so concerned of the opinions on others
Well I guess I can tell you what you've told me (kinda)
similar situations huh
huh
You sometimes have breaking points, like the rest of us
Especially I don't think to them
None of those sour moments have made you a horrible person
I know some people have probably already told you this but
I just want to feel like my stuff *belongs* and isn't just taken for granted
I'm not trying to make people like my stuff out of pity
It just started to become real taxing on my emotional self-esteem as I keep hearing applause for someone but dead silence for me
Or even just some stuff generally about the characters
And the crossover stuff
Like all the Shem-Has
It just felt like people no longer were interested in the stuff I make strictly because it's not Gear related
Don't want to keep sounding like a broken radio but
Also um
In my mind it was like "there's no point for me to be in here if I can no longer connect with the main topic of the server itself"
I just felt out of place since I'm not too invested in either anime or Gear anymore
I had a similat thing just now
Cause they're all clowns
Whoever is next to perform for a circus act
I think it's time for this to be edited
I can't really answer much of that unfortunately
GTA 5?
Like um
Can you believe the possibility of Johnson returning is actually potentially a thing happening
Rishi Sunak is now PM
oh boi
Almost time
We will see if a potential ballot is coming in half an hour
Oh boy
||#mymassivecock||
I present
And there's a trending hashtag about it
apparently boris' ||nudes|| got leaked
omg
Good luck soldier
Any attempts to fix the system shutdowns only create more problems and shutdowns
Until it all eventually comes crashing down
And now we are going lower and lower
We were a strong and powerful plane
Becoming an unstable mess
I'm here within the battlefield
And I'm just watching a monster grow larger and larger
Wow um
itv showing people complaining about how Sunak really doesn't know how the poor people live in UK because he has so much money himself
This dude literally about to become public enemy #1
I'm believing that's he's basically one of those guys who just riles up people because it's entertaining
And tbh after seeing these recent events
And he did it in probably the scummiest way possible
Like I get that you can opinions and that you can share them but
There's a place, time and way to express it
Remember when he interrupted Taylor Swift's award ceremony just to say he thought Beyonce should've won?
Thank god
I guess he went back for it
I guess twitter really is doomed doomed
welp
It's Astroworld all over again
omg
Oh boi
More ScotRail strikes
It's like not having a life sentence as a punishment
That is not going to end well
How are we gonna have our turkey
And it's getting big
New case of bird flu
Oh great
~~If you hear it out of Trump's words it's likely a really bad idea~~
bruh
Is this a good thing
GOOD
Of firing people
Basically about his defense
itv news talking about Elon Musk
Oh boi
I set up an emergency tweet
Aight
Imagine what shadowbanned numbers are gonna be like
My numbers weren't impressive before (and still kinda isn't)
But on the other hand
Without it there'd be no connection
Some of my mutuals only have accounts on Twitter
Yeah that's the problem for me
Thank god I have accounts on other art sites
Well that's fantastic ain't it
Cause I'm Slim Musky
Yeah I'm the real Musky
Elon Musk and the higher ups on Twitter or the UK government
I can't tell what's the bigger circus now
They ain't the greatest people
But this is kinda pathetic for Musk
Bruh
bruh
In 2022 when most places already rejected it by the turn of the millennium
At this point probably everyone's laughing at the UK
fail after fail after fail after fail
What's the election on
What's gonna happen if any one of them won
Wait so
fifa qatar workers died and their families are speaking out
oh shoot
In that case they could just be rogue experiments
Oh right
Hair just detached free from its user's will
Imagine
God 
These things have mutated more than anything in the wastelands of Fallout 76
They're cloutchasers
In other words
I haven't seen any case of it on Newgrounds tho
ok yeah that is kinda a problem
For me as an artist I have both Newgrounds and Pixiv
But different sites for different people
Well probably not any one site
is it time to call for migrations to other sites
right
is this an actual legit screenshot
wait
Yes cause when I want to spread my grandpa's ashes and I need somebody to take me there, my first choice is always an Uber
Did they get cancelled before deleting it
So they're doing all this ON TOP of still supporting NFTs
They'd have to manually set every single one to be unticked for AI prompts
Like holy hell imagine people who have like
Over 1000 things on their page (cause yes people do have that amount)
Yeah there's no way for you to do it all at once
So you'd have to untick the option for every single piece in the edit option
And it's set to tick by default
Every single piece's submission thing now has an extra option to be used for AI prompts
Worst thing is
I already retired from using the site but this is just hell
Like holy hell
I'm surprised he would even like
Backpedal on the thing
Y'know maybe should try to egg Sunak as well
i can't believe he would try to murder the king with salmonella
bruh
He could be just over on his head about the acquisition
Do I really want a "Twitter 2.0"
Well probably won't be dead dead
But on the brink of death soon
Oh yeah
This popped up when I went to my profile since we're speaking of Twitter
also apparently musk posted a meme tweet amidst this whole thing
They also talking about people moving to Mastodon
itv news talking about the twitter fiasco
oh boy
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
LMAO
All because of ONE player who joined a World Cup in which the country has issues with gay people
This selfish bastard decided to destroy the money that could've been for charity that were supporting those rights
Which he also said if Beckham had pulled out he would've donated the money to charities
And by some money
I mean 10 grand
In response to the whole LGBTQ issue
Hmm
Joe Lycett shredded some money this morning because David Beckham was in the Qatar World Cup
Why must this world keep taking away our heroes
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
It may be fake but I think the message was kinda clear
all the major news outlets already showed what he did previously
welp probably too late
Iger was in Disney when Michael Eisner was CEO I believe
Probably better for someone who's actually involved with Disney for a while before being CEO than a rando
Would that make Chapek the shortest stay as CEO at Disney
We should be expecting Bob the Builder as CEO
So one day
Is this good
Hell, a while since we even spoke to each other
It was a while since I saw my grandma's face before she's gone
I'm glad you're able to remember the happy times with him
that really sucks
I just feel
Empty
I don't feel either
I'm supposed to be really angry or be in tears right now but
In their case it was due to cancer
Another relative of our family also passed away a few months ago as well
Or even take it in
It's just 
So difficult to truly express it
My parents informed me around an hour ago that my grandmother had just passed away
But sad news
So um
I know people have been talking about deaths in here and I know the mood's already plenty low
Buzzfeed?
So like
In a video discussing pedophilia in Japan...
Symphogear
I hope she's dealing with it well
oh hey itv news is talking about it now
I'm so shocked I'm actually not shocked at all
not that I want him to
I hope he can still claim himself as the richest person after all this is done and dusted
If the culprit is no longer in this world
We might probably never know the true motive
There must've been something that has been brewing overtime then
Your own life?
And moreso
Is it worth taking your employees' lives over
I know managers probably isn't the most stress free job but
No
He literally *fired* them with bullets
Why is it always the people that hate on these things are the ones doing it themselves
Hitler's secretly the one controlling us in a simulation
Or maybe
Perhaps
Imagine if Hitler's the reason AI art looks wonky
Kinda reminds me of the way AI art sometimes makes things look well off
Yeah
~~So great job on Jimmy Carr for destroying one of his pieces on tv~~
Why implement a thing non-artists mainly use for exploitation when you have an art software
But who in over their team thought this would've went over well in the first place
I guess it's good that they stopped that
People already going the "the world is doomed" approach?
damn
That doesn't mean they should stop trying to help the people who need them
It's the patients
It's the passengers
But the people who are suffering for this isn't the workers
I know the government should also step up
People are *needing* their services
And they're preventing that because they can't get a few more tiny coins in their plastic cards
To millions of people who want to be with their families
But like
(although he also did make one comment about executing the workers)
Calling them selfish
Yeah he basically went on a rant in 2011 about train worker strikes
He kinda is
Like I don't wanna say Clarkson was right in 2011 but
and all at like the worst absolute time
Now we have ones for rail, NHS, teachers and UK border
Even more strikes across the UK coming up
So um
You realize how many people on social media get blasted on anything political right
I really just let my anger and low average IQ get the best of me again
Maybe I'm just a crazed lunatic who's just always mad for the wrong reasons at the wrong people
you win
...i give up
But these people are equally as oblivious at the whole picture
Of course I'd be mad at the people in power as well
And now the strikes have completely destroyed those plans
She was planning to come back on the 23rd
My mum now has to be stuck in China for months now because of circumstances
Where everything he does ends up backfiring on him in embarrassing ways
Musk seems like the comedy villain in a cartoon
This is the UK's biggest wrestling match
Well if they can beat Sunak's pushing to stop them by brute force
and the government ain't backin down
We gettin strikes from forces for land and air
The UK is screwed
6 sets
Actually scratch that
4 sets of strikes across the uk
Welp
Real concerning that it's gone this far
Still like you said
The fact that it's gone from an extreme to actually happening is just
Jesus Christ
And it ain't good
Shit's going down over here
Okay well either way
Should've just said 6 strikes
okay maybe 'sets' wasn't the right word
6 sets over the entire month
yup
#justiceforroyalmail
Like just because it may be doing better doesn't mean it's still struggling
~~also its kinda bad that ms may is denying that scot nhs needs help by saying that it's doing better than anywhere else~~
And probably their hubris
Rishi Sunak vs the World
Kanye's not 'slightly autistic'
is there any actual proof to what he's even saying
He's majorly unhinged
Yeah that's def Mandarin
Seems really divided
https://bleedingcool.com/comics/comic-book-creators-react-to-ai-artificial-intelligence-art-explosion/
I have recently read through an article about comic artists' opinions on ai art
Kinda feels like family drama so big its being reported by news
I don't honestly know what to think about the Williams/Meghan documentary series
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/16/world/europe/london-concert-crush-asake.html#:~:text=The%20police%20responded%20to%20reports,Britain's%20most%20popular%20music%20venues.&text=As%20a%20subscriber%2C%20you%20have,articles%20to%20give%20each%20month.
And 3 people are in critical condition
Apparently there was some sort of big concert crush in South London
Welp um
That's like removing the safety net in case something goes wrong
I know the difficulty of staffing but should we really just rely on one guy for a plane
bruh
Wait so
She's only allowing one pilot in the cockpit seat?
Surely that'd be costly efficient right
Just train everyone to be a pilot
You'd probably want someone else with you in case things do go wrong
Exactly
~~somehow I'd rather be in squid game than work in South korea~~
One is either "support our leader or die" and the other is grind hell
I guess both sides of the coin have issues huh
bruh
~~try me sunak~~
When it's still in development
Just like update it whilst keeping the old one on
Y'know
making any kind of living on youtube's going to be more and more hell
Exactly
This is just 
bruh
https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3p9yg/artist-banned-from-art-reddit
*Why* did this child decide to go on a shooting spree
Bigger question is
Is this just a weird attempt to turn Scooby Doo adult
So uh
well clearly someone's being defensive about his products
bruh
~~exactly~~
~~i thought politicians are supposed to be smart~~
~~We're in for a great year im sure~~
bruh
Not telling anyone on the team
Kinda messed up that the higher ups just
Pulled the plug like that without warning
(also a show with infinite seasons is just a terrible thing)
Imagine how incoherent that arcs would be
He really throwin away the diamonds with all the rest of the trash
Like I said
Elon thinks
He just doesn't think logically
Really dumb
He just thinks dumb
Elon can think
The goal is this announcement
What exactly is like
what
Basically the only thing Twitter was talking about for the past few days
bruh
But apparently holding and potentially using a murder weapon is fine???
So getting drunk is bad
bruh what
And even then 
It was like 
Days before the game actually launched
I only knew of the game's existence because I heard about the murder train on twitter
Unconsciously chuckle
Should I feel bad or just kinda
oh hell naw
To not let children weird weapons
You'd think that'd be like
Parenting 101
It is an AI program designed for conversations
those ai stans really comin up to terrorize
jesus christ
~~Using a Star Wars analogy isn't exactly doing them favours~~
i swear im a weeb
Nana also voiced a lead in a precure season
now i want nana as a good lead heroine that doesn't involve mecha
tho i do play roy and pit a lot
eh don't have a specific one
though not on a daily basis
yeah
just can't help myself
simon
castlevania
because

hatsune miku first appearance in anime proper
isnt it amazing
wow nice
and eva as well
yep
OHH YOU GOT IT
into shinkansen
the mecha do transform
oooo even closer
the series actually started in 2017
ooo not quite
then you might know
well look around for kid anime that premiered in January 2018
it is by takara tomy
but the toyline is not by bandai
mm close
and it's for kids
it's a mecha anime
well the crossovers are within the show itself
ah i see
dakimakuras?
the other chat question?
which one
<@!87512939107450880> same
or about dakimakuras
for my question in the other chat?
the cornerstone of any healthy anime merchandise
ah dakimakuras
i sense a mecha anime war coming up
uh oh
the op was lit
gotta say
well i did basically go into the series blind
it was...a gainax anime all right
just watched ep 1 of gurren lagann
hmm
then you guess which one im thinking about
i'll give you two hints about an anime i watched
also people imma make you play a game
tho i still have all of GL of watch before i can make a decision
well it was the only one i heard off before learning about magical index
A rival in shift of tone with EVA I see...
That's sick
Damn
Can anyone guess my first Mahou Shoujo anime
Back to my guessing game
Anyway
Nice
Tho if you meant YOUR first one then no
Yes
Ah swords of culture are banding together
Mmm not quite
2005, Junichi Sato
I'll give you two hints
But not one you expect
Welp I did
What's the first Magical Girl show you've watched as a child
Hey
well that's fun
oh
i am on kissanime cause there's nowhere streaming to series
yeah
is it required or not?
i see episode 5.5 of GL
hmm
i can see
gome
he is a fan of anime-based games like Persona and Danganronpa
tho i don't think he grew up with anime
tho from what i see he's not much of a fan of toku either...
he's not even heard much of toku
yeah...
well he said he wants to watch the same anime with me so...
he also really likes films of makoto shinkai
tho i think he is phasing out of mecha
even the Rebuild films
collects all the DVDs
well he watches EVA
he just doesn't
yeah i dunno why he doesn't like it
the graphics and craziness for me kinda works
honestly tho
he also said the OP is meh so..
i don't think my friend just...likes the concept
i think my friend didn't like it for a different reason
yup around the first time they gattai
now watched 3 episodes
tho they don't seem to like it that much...
with a friend
i am
I wanna hear your non-spoiler opinions about it
Gurren Lagann
also as i said earlier i am starting to watch GL
what about just about every other chapter of this franchise
uh okay then
well...at least we got the main protag with Jojo's JP VA
i mean with the way the plot was building up i expected it to be longer
yeah...but for me it was just too short for the narrative it was building.
Nice
Oh
Sorry if that sounded a bit stern
I could express my disappointment all to you but it's you who should make your opinion on it
Sure go ahead and make your own opinion about it
I was... disappointed
Imo without spoilers
Well...I watched it.
Hmm...anyone watched Dimension W?
Hmm nice choices
it doesn't have the 'impact' of the series
yup
who watched dimension w?
naw i won't talk about that
that had 76 episodes total
premiered in jan 2018
of a kids anime
that's just a recap
episode
i watched another
also speaking of recaps
did any of you enjoy death and rebirth?
uh yup
only touched the og series
nope
have any of you watched EVA death and rebirth
night
EVA death and rebirth
or rather
i saw death of EVA
uh nope
and ones that go on for too long
i already have watched way too many 'recap' anime episodes
someone REALLY wanted you to watch it
jesus
i definitely will try to
don't worry
i'd say so far it's pretty good
well they did just say
> you either hate it or love it
you kay?
my friend tho....not so much
i am definitely enjoying it so far
well i am watching it with a friend
definitely a breath of fresh air
wow
just watched Gurren Lagann ep 5
i can see why
mira good bot
yep
The hell are those files below
Uh....nani
who she
||this new character nia||
there was one other thing in ep 9
wait
im using desktop
to know
well that would've been handy
oh
isn't there supposed to be a button to turn the text into spoilers when you highlight + right click?
got it
how does the spoiler tag work
um
spoiler tag didn't work
fudge
and ep 9 is where ||simon gets depressed||
still hurts
yup
effectively rounding up what i call act 1
i've watched first 8 episodes of gurren lagann
welp
Boom I went there
Death Nope
Procare
then again i never watched any of the movies so...
oh well might as well make it a slightly belated watch
well crud
so first two madoka movies = death and rebirth of eva
so only watch rebellion if you want the complete original story
espcially the aforementioned rebellion
can somebody tell us if we need to watch the movies to get the complete plot
especially rebellion
but i don't know if the films are crucial to the overall story
hmm planning to watch magia record
but who watched madoka magica
hmm this might be a stupid question
I did see a video about it how the dub's voice acting kinda killed some tension in the scene
It's THAT one
OH
Hmm...lemme Google the anime for a sec
Yeah I know the file type
Oh
so don't worry if you don't get it
it's kinda obscure tho
imma make you guess which anime i watched as a kid
naw im not
who like 2005?
okay then
?
you like Mahou Shoujo
hey people
I KNEW IT.
As far as I can tell it's only on the favourite pirating anime site
No
Oh
con CR?
Fushigiboshi no Futagohime (Twin Princess of the Wonder Planet)
Oh right never told you the name
Also it is now 15 years old
But don't expect it to be like Madoka or Nanoha
You can go and watch it
So like I said
Ok then
No I do feel genuinely sorry if I interrupted what you guys were talking about earlier
...please what?
...I feel like I might've interrupted what you guys were probably talking about with my pointless interjection of my childhood
Just don't expect the type of stuff you find in stuff like Madoka or Nanoha
You guys can watch that one
they do share a series director
while they don't share character designer
funny thing
i've definitely never seen an anime which it's concepts were created in the form of a website
it was....an interesting find
that was basically my intro to mahou shoujo anime
yep
....wow you got it
now guess which one it is
it's one of those
yep
i can give you the series director
eh...how bout even more obscure than that
well except for one
unfortunately the schoolmates i have now aren't invested in anime at all...
also a....certain meme basically peeked my interest
it was from a reviewer who reviewed s1 in late 2017
then again the method i used symphogear was...odd
it reignited my passion for anime
i guess that's why i like it so much
for some reason
symphogear has a lot of 1st's for me
yup
and it all started with symphogear
and I'm 16
i didn't get to talk with ANYONE about anime until 12 or 13
probably cause all my schoolmates were never really interested in anime
welp i never get to do that as a child
ah i see
> yeah let's just say...I didn't grow up with the anime most people probably have
I may have just proved my point
....I feel like an oddball here
yeah let's just say...I didn't grow up with the anime most people probably have
holy hell
I remember watching the 2007 and 2008 films
Even then it's very sparadic in terms of when I'll watch them
I just watch the movies
Well now...
Those were the good old days
then waiting until an episode went up
Turning on the TV
Always going home from school
Mine those memories
Doraemon
That would also be a childhood one of mine
It was the first anime I actually completed in a long time
But Symphogear was the first anime that I actually got invested in in a very long time
> ~~don't say symphogear, nobody will believe you~~
<@453836798796234762> Now I know this
For a long time I actually basically jumped out of anime
hmm...
I was born in the mid 2000's
I was not born in the 90's
Yes
This one was my first jump into Mahou Shoujo anime
Yes
Yar har fiddle Dee dee
Rain of swords of culture
Yes
or has even heard of
I watch anime nobody likes
I feel like an alien right now
> ...I feel like I am talking an anime nobody likes
I feel like my point is getting majorly amplified here...
okay then
we talking about Classroom Crisis?
...I feel like I am talking an anime nobody likes
> Who's watched Assassination Classroom?
Uh people...
Who's watched Assassination Classroom?
Hmm....
but at the same time making it...uh...clear to me that there are loads of anime
and uh...making me question being an anime fan
thanks for summing up the stuff
....yep
about uh... interesting anime
loads of uh...talk here
it's a bit dated but kinda fun
well I like it
oh
around the low-mid 7
I mean it's MAL score isn't as high as AssClass but still decent
> Who has heard of this anime
 https://myanimelist.net/anime/505/Fushigiboshi_no%E2%98%86Futagohime
Who has heard of this anime
Ok then
> the show I talked a bit about days ago is even more obscure than that
 And it's by a popular series director
the show I talked a bit about days ago is even more obscure than that
uh
Then you'll see another obscure anime that I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who has heard of it here
well scroll right up
...why do I still feel like an alien for liking AssClass?
so I thought I might give them a shot
I watch certain anime because i usually hear good thinks about them
he...did not like it (or at least did not found it interesting)
the series
I showed one of my friends Madoka
welp
which one?
I don't know if I should laugh or cower in fear
...oh no
possibly because most aren't into or have never watched anime
Basically 90% of anime I suggest to friends
what was one anime you liked that your friends hated?
> Jesus you people really know what obscure means more than me
again my point somewhat proven
hmm...
Jesus you people really know what obscure means more than me
like at all
they were...not pleased
>  https://myanimelist.net/anime/505/Fushigiboshi_no%E2%98%86Futagohime
I showed this to my friends
hmm...
speed of sound
basically
Fun
oh
what sort of experience
it kinda is
so you're saying you expect to be disappointed with every anime
and I love it
biggest mistake was going into gurren Lagann blind
I mean that's what most people did for Eva and madoka
yeah you might as well go into every anime blind and hope for the best
then again I find that strategy doesn't usually work so...
always expect the unexpected
what can you expect
It's anime
0/10 too much blue
no yellow sky
this anime is now dead
and pray farewell
everyone get up in black
okay this anime is ruined
...tbh never seen many anime with foreign titles
... actually one of my friends got into persona before
but who here watched at least one Doraemon film
this may sound like a stupid question
...okay
which one
how did we go from obscure 2000's anime to debate over whether gear is yuri
I heard about it
O_O
I mean who knows if they'll do more anime stuff for gear
curse of balal dead and all
like I get it
tbh I'm just mad they didn't say 'i love you' to each other in the end
I suppose that's true...
what's the worst rated anime
hmm what trash anime is there...
it you w-want t-too
s-sure
I mean
uh...
nice
?
uh so we talkin about mecha anime now
still waiting for someone to sub the movie...
shinkansen that can turn into mecha
basically
just wonderin
who here has watched shinkalion?
hey
RIP
what
a villain using a crabstick
a crabstick
but they never focused on the concept being the main thing
in fact since the early days
well i mean transformers did do robots that transformed into trains
noice
if you can withstand just how long it is
and the anime series is great
the bluray is getting released later this month
back in december in jp
dammit blue why you do this
that some good stuff
damn that fight scene
who's episodes did you like the best?
they could've just concluded with 48
defnitely not much better here
it felt off with mahoutsukai
sigh....too bad about episode 49...
she's the greatest
but most improtantly
she's cute
she's enduring
and that is why milky is in top 5 cures
i grately apologize
especially with ||lala's last words as the human cures leave through the portal||
yup
can't deny episode 40 was one of the best in the season
still
coughEpisode14cough
Tho it kinda feels like she kinda hijacked the spotlight in a few episodes
So you like Hikaru/Cure Star?
My favourite green cure tbh
> Oh. Milky is definitely a highlight of the show.
<@262326868366065664> Yep great character
Anyway
Being fan is suffering
That warms my heart a bit
Okay good
Hurts...so bad...
Still bloody hurts..
Still hurts...
That is Lala/Cure Milky
Well at least I did find one more enjoyable than the rest
to me it was kinda the characters that blew it for me (minus a few)
I'd say STP is kinda....weak
> What you think of Star Twinkle Precure (if you've seen it)
Wanna give some opinions people
What you think of Star Twinkle Precure (if you've seen it)
Kay people
haven't seen too much in full for me
holy hell
with precure it's always between princess and heartcatch
tho unlike precure not sure which one you could go for
mm maybe
uh huh
sad that minase went from star baker to...whatever her character is in kirameiger
odd role reversal for aoi yuki and inori minase
good yellow
cure sparkle
oh yes
where as minase now is in kirameiger
also yuki is pink cure
oh yeah heard something about that
i mean if transformers are anything to go by
takara comes a close second
inpenetrable fortress
again
and they'll nuke you
attempt to get them
toei is an inpenetrable fortress
interesting...
ooo
other anime's CG just look...god awful
yup
that sound bad
i don't like the sound of that...
oh no
<@!297542051057238017> we talkin precure
just...greatness
the epilogue episode
also
it was alright for an anniversary season
yeah
best fight scene in the season
this just...perfection
damn that frame
remember in ep. 11...?
yeah
the animator should get a raise
<@152896851660505088> Please reply...
<@152896851660505088> You're concerning me...
<@152896851660505088> No seriously thanks for what
uh for what
Would Smile be a better starter for beginners?
Like a bunch of villain arcs?
Akibaranger is life
Akibaranger is love
this review is also legendary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWJMM7H5Zg
akiba is as meta as sentai can get
interesting choice...
uh huh...
pick one
Ryusoulger (2019)
Kyoryuger (2013)
Abaranger (2003)
Zyuranger (1992)
pretty sure it's 44 now...
they hell is that name?
in terms of artstyle at least
honestly comparing heartcatch to suite feels a bit...unfair?
dab on em hard
not by far
this aint the worst of milking a series
trust me
also more motw's made from items instead of people
i won't force ya then
okay
how much worse?
so kinda like you're hearing engrish
whenever they yell like that
basically inside your head you are saying "say it properly"
eh kinda
what is the reason?
I'd say Doki Doki is kinda equivalent to Kamen Rider in terms of writing
there's also certain characters which make it decisive as well i believe...
so yeah im cool with it
tho it has the va who later did nagisa shiota
well yeah
doki doki is also well known for being the most hated season
no you can still enjoyment out of smile
it's kinda....the most basic season
gonna say probably a tie between heartcatch and doki doki
might put a smile on your face
well it's the most....basic season
lucky i spared some life-returning pills
huh
oh look im back
X_X
have a good rhythm?
um...
oh no
please don't kill me
hah get it
listen to the melody all the way through
continue then
then there's ||the other cure...||
well at least we stopped anyone else
oops
||good antagonist turned hero||
yup
well at least there's Cure Beat after that to make up for it
not a fan of it lasting for quite some time in the first half
just okay
i'd say suite is okay
it scares me
but that thing
I fear no man
dunno whether to choose this guy or that thing from Steven universe
tho in terms of monsters
I don't even know what to say
oh
wait which season of Sentai is this
I mean I've seen some motw's but this guy tops them all
i'm at a loss for words
that....exists...
i meant that doki doki has a lot of plot relevant episodes like some Rider shows
the only thing i can remember from season 1 is episode 14
oh
wait who we talkin bout
dunno
As in...Makoto Shinkai?
A Shinkai film?
uh...
<@226789636989517824> that is a cursed being
nice choices
why you do this DEMON SPAAAAWWNN
and how it caused disasters in Japan
I saw a review of Minky Momo
so...
for what I'm about to ask
I want a show of hands
hello
More than half of you IS soda
Welp not like you need it
A specimen of a species known as dank memes
ah
You're a vampire aren't you
oh
what have you been...
yup you got yourself a great deal
And best magic user
best goddess
best sniper
hmm let's see...
2. Nana Mizuki
1. To see if I'm a loner/weirdo here
I only brought this anime up because...
> who has watched....
Shugo Chara
who has watched....
who would've thought
huh
that was a lot of oyos
oh yes
OOOYOOOO!!
it's perfect
also that colour
go watch it just for lala
ayyy it's lala
Saying about phrasing a sentence
"Why does it matter?"
But another thing they said is basically
Yeah I think I blew this way out of proportion
they did later say that they misphrased it
And for straight I feel it should be the same
A reason for this
I just want there to be a reason for it
And it only feels fair to let them know their voices are out there too
LGBT is a less-known group
I guess my only answer to that is...
I guess I just...got real mad bout this phrasing of words
sorry
(sigh)
so you feel for the characters more
It makes it more relevant and less jammed in there
If there is a purpose to a thing
Because to me
Good
if it's inserted tastefully into an anime and it actually feels like it belongs
(like is it necessary/appropriate to the overall story?)
without even trying to explain themselves
it honestly hurts that some people take anime with LGBT representations and claim it is why this is good
yeah that's what I feel
having gays is NOT and will NEVER be a deciding factor on whether an anime is good or not
cause in my opinion...
I honestly want to know
...is it just me or does this sound wrong?
therefore he claims that it is "automatically better"
and he because it contained gays
one of my friends said that it was "Gurren Lagann but decent"
I was talking with friends about promare
They really oofed up III, didn't they?
i like we're only talking bout the one cure
I already know of one
don't worry
Back to fun times
Enough heavy stuff
We can move on now
okay
The anime me and my friend were talking bout was Promare
Just for context if any of you didn't know
I think I just got quite annoyed with his comment
yeah
I guess I REALLY blew this out of proportion didn't I?
(and have it spelt correctly)
I just can't type fast
I made it on the fly
Uh
Bad people
oh those puns ain't giving you any Christmas 'carols' or presents this year
Magical Sentai
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
ooo
Tho they both have gems as a core concept so...
Naw
We were replying to Ikxi
I know
Thanks Akko
That just happened
Third Impact
I need to start watching a Precure season
It's like bumping into an old acquaintance you almost forgot about
Why is it weird?
revisiting this anime

yknow what was weirder for me?
Yay
||Get ready for nightmare fuel||
Technically you could say the ||flying island ship is kinda like Macross||
Movie do movies
...okay
||never trust the birb||
welcome to the gang buddy
if you do
welp
And each clip gets funnier than the last
Nichijou
Time for a high school anime more... light-hearted
I see you're into the idol anime
Poor rock :(
Now go soldier
Magical Girl
Yes
Oh I see
Soldier?
Got that soldier?
And come back to report your opinion
Of the MG anime
Go see the OP
Anyway...
But never got the attention he deserved
He was kinda badass
Uh huh
The ninja was Dororo
Also here's the OP to the MG anime my child side could not resist bringing up https://youtu.be/Yv3PGYY5cfw
I feel those days
Yup
He did
Yes
Seems he's also gonna be the director for A Whisker Away
Well for series anyway
His last main role was a series director for Hugtto Precure
Almost every year he found new stuff to work on
He did storyboard for EVA
Oh my
This
The girls transformed costumes were....well...
The show is... basically how a Toei Mahou Shoujo would run if it didn't have any proper combat
(Ojamajo Doremi, bits of Sailor Moon, Princess Tutu)
The chief director is Junichi Sato
Sun is dying, twin princesses must save blessing of sun, if not everyone will die
The story basically goes like this (without much spoilers)
I see
Oh
I believe I was the one who provided the screenshot
Well all you need to know is that it's a 2005 anime
They also made Aria the Animation
It was an anime made by Hal Flim Maker (Ex-Toei employees)
Yeah I didn't expect you to
Fushigiboshi no Futagohime
Also imma now talk about one of my (if not my) first peaks into the Mahou Shoujo genre
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Well they have a mecha that references the Getter Robo so...
It was just...a thing
I never said it was a bad thing
Effectively turning it into a PreCure thing
Making Magical Girl versions of the PPG trio...
It was an.... interesting experiment with PPG
PPGZ
Okay so... <@471416654346321930>
Digital is preferred over physical nowadays
Cause again
Nowhere for them to go
Without tv
Most run on tv
That kinda the reason why I think dubs are dying
Yeah
In my home region my channel is having a separate channel exclusively for dubbed anime
They probably not gonna last much longer
Yeah
(Minus English for obvious reasons)
Dubs are now almost a thing of the past
I cringed hard
I tried watching the Cantonese dub of the Mahou Shoujo anime
In fact
Uh huh
I see
Still trying to find Italian dub of a Mario cartoon
Italian
It's either Japanese or English nowadays
And I'm not jokin about there being dubs
Unless if you go for...other languages
This is basically the only way
If you wanna watch this show
Well
It's a pirate's dream come true
Yup
If you wanna watch it with subs
There is no alternative
Anyway here is how to watch it with subs https://kissanime.nz/Anime/Fushigiboshi-no-Futagohime?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bc6d65b0c80d162d6ab35268cfab39349b21c1f8-1593821360-0-ASXVpH9B6ID5fG2duybOs9l7xMDbtFjoq6410zspY6RMnx-rJCGUhPjfllJDcIVLCAOyWrzzQCPKJ-7pRbi_NwewlHI4wxEu442QKqNWnm2_sjrWA_xik3QICT5T3RN1zL6t-e2XJBP9EtkV313IZHaFcmDvEwzw3w8nwNRjWbCWEMh8TwcanMUjbULu8hRIlfLx2o9ovL6G6hWyeWaalOnAiBK3Yx6hAiduLVG503vHga9I63C-8749p3Csr6OmX0LJYHOI02X-WQXftF_53tdrdjdENOeX_JkvpeAQYIdjohhkY1YZTc4JHx8jbQr9KQ
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
It was 2011
Only a few break the mold
Most are pretty formulaic
Yeah
Tho I had an... alternative method to watching this anime
In Japan anyway
Cause it was aired in 2005
Yeah
Especially in the 2000's
This one is pretty standard for Mahou Shoujo OPs
Trust me
I assume it wasn't very good?
I see
Oh
rocks
Today is a good day
Man
Today is a certain Cure's birthday
About a possible Chinese dub
Now I'm interested
Hmm
Yeah the subs on these can often look like someone who was forced to learn English at gunpoint
"I found you, faker!"
Then again I have seen a Sympho XV one with Chinese so...
a Neptunia the Animation DVD set with Chinese on it
huh
(at least that's a kid would think)
It good
It shiny
At least it's good for a collection...?
You may as well take it for a test drive
Welp
It's one of those supposed tragic things that end up being unintentionally hilarious
Okay sorry
<:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
"No OTHER animals were harmed in the making of this video."
Possibly
Possibly
Uh
Odd
Huh
Works for me
This must be the beginning
https://youtu.be/C_9ob4FBXCg Yo what
Also play Symphogear: Detonation
And the game is obviously based off of the Grimm Brothers' fairytales
From what I've saw from googling it's an anime adaptation of a Square Enix game
Anyone watched Grimm Notes the Animation?
Hmm
https://youtu.be/jXeVYHWkQ2U
9_8ball should Hanabi play "The Safety Dess" on endless repeat?
And that's me being generous
0/10 no "all of the above" option
Somewhat
Relatable to some
Yes we are
Yes
Naw
I think I can still experience it in the best way possible
Time to yank you into it
Welp
Sucking up all the precious in that little girl
They're miniature black holes
Looks at cold eyes

Magia Record and the OG series don't really affect one another

How bout Rise?
> sonix x was my *jam*, dude
GOTTSA GO FEST
*resisting the urge to not make a Zero-One joke*
That arrange version contained none of that
The TV Version contains an electric guitar and drums
Yup
I remember hearing more drums when I first heard the ending
I think it might be the *slightly* different instruments
Probably
It's probably on the OST or something
Welp I have no idea
Oh
Unless you're talking about the final episode
I think it's Magia or something...?
🔥 🔥 🔥
The theme song is also on YouTube
As supposed to just being the same one
Also all the turtles are different turtle species
It is after all called RISE of the TMNT
I think it's because Rise was more of a 'prequel'
Yeah the show looked so good
(Rise of the TMNT)
that comes in episode 10
*oh* it does
it does
uh huh
Are those animation frames?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
but Madoka is a black void inside
Cure Black may be darker
I've heard Magical Girl Site could've been a Madoka clone
Uh huh
My favourite type of behind the scenes stuff in animation
Yay
I did watch this show
I have to admit
Okay
Oo
Which anime is that
Hold up
Practically everyone must've heard of Transformers in some form or another
But Transformers is no C-list brand
They were critically panned by critics sure
Oof
This applies to both English and Japanese VAs of the CPUs
Kinda helps that their personalities are quite the polar opposites
Shocking, ain't it?
Higurashi?
Proves Symphogear is as original as they get
Yup
Everyday is a <#407060923078017026> moment

Woo woo it's the sound of the police
Final Fusion theme is godtier anime soundtrack
Hell yeah
Assault Gear XDU Crossover when
I think I've seen someone react to that before
Oh god
They gonna be in trouble
Uh oh...
Somebody disproved those rumours
Naw
It's about time
https://twitter.com/evangelion_co/status/1316921806540996610?s=19
And people will literally give you death threats if you object to the majority opinion
So anime is now a ground to compare people's mentality, morality AND IQ?
Apparently you must say that particular anime is perfect otherwise you'll be called by everyone as less of a human being
Healin' Good, Star Twinkle and Hugtto
Oh yeah the main crossover film releases today
I just found this tweet while looking through PreCure stuff on Twitter
Well this is a thing https://twitter.com/oricon_anime_/status/1322131132419248130?s=19
Is this a guessing game?
Odd that the article went down in the first place
The article's down
Oh
Even the song doesn't fit the trailer at all
That's an insult to SFM
Berserk 2016 was better animated than this
This anime is probably gonna taint Ex-Arm
Yeah
"Hey there are great Anametics, so just imagine what the finished product will look like!"
Also I love one reply in the comments section
And I thought Kamen Rider CGI looked bad...
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Why does this director make worse excuses than EA?
How the hell can you have a director who knows little to nothing about animation without the aid of a co-director and expect a good looking product?
A team with little to no experience in anime
Wow
This girl has the bloody soul of Hibiki injected into her
Yup
Imagine an entire family that watches anime together
Amazingly terrible you mean
Also the OP's pretty decent
Also Cinnabar looks like she needs a hug
All good
The soundtrack's sounding pretty solid so far
The animation looks good
The concepts are shown pretty well
This was a great introduction
Jokes aside
I can already tell what ship they're gonna be focusing on
Yup
Just finished Houseki no Kuni Episode 1
How could you resist?
It has Nana Mizuki as the main lead
It's great
No
Heartcatch from what I've heard is good
Yeah
It's among the top for one of my favourite anime
I'm a fan
I love it
<:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>

Yes you do
Yes

Who knew Toku and Transformers would go well together?

~~there are no dreams~~

Oh wait
And I thought Half-Life 3 took a while
My idiot brain won't stop telling me it's all about idols and that it's lame
But I just could not get myself into it
If it seems like your thing yes
It wants dynamic looking stuff
It wants fight scenes
My brain tells me it can't *just* be about idol stuff
But like
No
Well
At least she gave us some room to inhale the next batch of suffering
Welp
Okay I can already tell presentation for this is gonna be a high score

Not sure if anyone's talked about this
I can't help the think the price on it might be sky high tho
That is one sexy beast
Oh no they subjecting anime characters to physical pain now
~~This is reality~~
This ain't fiction bro
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
~~I guess you can say they *crumbled* under the pressure~~
~~It doesn't have the anime appeal Ex-Arm has~~
~~Yeah people overestimate Land of the Lustrous' animation~~
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
Land of the Lustrous
(Although mainly on DVD's)
I remember one show I've watched as a child
~~Gee I wonder why~~
Coolio

Fun
Although I've heard there's a season 2
12 episodes
Huh
I probably should check out Yuru Camp
Y'know what
The trailer looks good
Holy hell
https://youtu.be/341PWaO9Ipk
Next month: *announces cancellation*
Like *really* good
I've heard it's good
Hmm
And the humans *become* Digimon
I heard how controversial that series is
Oo boi Frontier
Chest missiles
Uh
And
I only ever watched Savers/Data Squad and the first arc of Xros Wars/Fusion
*"talk about our new religion?"*
Yeah the Japanese pronunciations of the names are better
And the Fusion dub...
I heard about your bliss towards the manga
Which also changed up the formula
Then there was Xros Wars
Best girl
Nagisa
Ah yes
So in about two weeks time
https://twitter.com/comic_natalie/status/1372755240261324805?s=19 so this is a thing now
Then we can complete the trio
Takagaki better voice a pink Cure next time
Aight

https://twitter.com/rarararanze/status/1382236730846154752?s=19
Niiice
Ooo nice
Two days late but eh
https://twitter.com/YuGiOhCardEU/status/1389943385235013635?s=19
🤔
Yutaka you bloody genius
https://twitter.com/Th3VProducti0ns/status/1399637938707726336
The All-Star thing was used on one of the generals of the season
I do have one problem with those episodes
Solid Laura
I want the bunny
Who's ready to listen to some tunes
https://twitter.com/curehibiki01/status/1400768290977370113?s=19
All 5 together now
https://twitter.com/curehibiki01/status/1400785983516205057?s=19
Probably cause of 'Ange'
For some reason I initially thought the name of the anime was Angel Beats
Something in my mind just hit me about it
Dunno
Anime
Something just struck me thinking about that
Yeah that's her
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
So young too
Yikes
Uh huh
Then again Shinkalion Z has an ending theme performed by some Nijisanji members so
An interesting reveal
Well this is
<:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
Sounds like a certain hamster...
Then again it is a given
Good choice ngl
And I feel nostalgic now for some reason
Pretty good for a 90's anime opening
Pretty much expected for a film that knocked down a near 20 year old box office record
Considering it continuously aired until like 2010 or 2011
There's a lot of episodes
Oh and also the first
I think I rewatched the second and third movie earlier this year
They probably kept the JP intro and outro
Considering it *is* Funimation
Although
Never checked out the Funimation dubs
Good question
Nostalgia blasts through me
Whenever I hear the opening
Those were the days
The memories
Ah yes
I'd say even that's an insult to PowerPoint
Y'know what
Aight this is illegal
Like how Peach shouts Mario all the time?
What are his issues with Miku?
coughGurrenLaganncough
Yeah that's of her own choosing
But fighting Noise?
Yes the whole relic thing was out of her control
Hibiki could've chosen *not* to join Section 2
It's weird
So I'll just default to how most humans respond to each others' interests
Cause let's be honest I'm probably one of few people here who considers Elfnein my favourite character
And I'm not gonna say he has bad taste
(although probably of a different kind than most)
I'm on it too
I appreciate that your friend managed to find you something that finally brought some much needed happiness into your life after such a tragic time
This guy has not played enough Mario games
So the constant dessing wasn't a problem but Miku shouting Hibiki was?
...what
And that 'experienced' people just embrace that stuff
He probably was in the mentality of 'experienced characters'
Very very sorry
I did *not* know that
Uh
Oh
Binging eh?
Hmm
Hmm
Then again I do make puns every now and again so
I did not realize that was a pun
Oh uh
What a chad
Still smiles
Sealed up
Rikka Takarada from SSSS Gridman
Or if you want a more anime comparison
~~Mei has the same VA as Magine~~
Like the Orthogonal Diagonaliser?
Wait what
When you can have happiness
Why have suffering
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Sign me up
This opening damn
That's not my kinda show
I'm not watching Love Live
No
~~I think you may have brainwashed me into watching it~~
Cause it's a PreCure show
They're not the same franchise
It's a separate thing entirely
No
Tropical Rouge PreCure
I think it's time to start
I've gone on and off about this show
Aight
Idol dream is ded once again
I demand you all get a pay rise
I swear Tropical Rouge's writers
I already really like Laura like holy mama
Now I see why people were excited about this one
Episode 1 done
Just Gacha
Yup nothing else
Gacha
All I can think about Love Live now is
Y'know
But that's another topic for another time
(and/or predatory practices)
And that's Ep 2 done
Then any other season you watch afterwards could feel like a disappointment
If you think the same
Cause since it's the most popular
I'd say starting with Heartcatch is a detriment to your experience
Doesn't hook me the most
It's just from what I've seen
I know people like it
Rather than start from the beginning
It's better to start with seasons I think I'll be interested in
I think for me
I think that's better
I'm not sure about starting with that one
Ehhh
Absolutely
Yes
With Tropical Rouge
Can't wait to get more into the series
(literally)
Man is that true music to my ears
And that opening
The fight's great
Anyways
If you're not talking about Fate then yes
Manatsu and Laura really work well together
It was a *great* introduction
Well only watched the first episode and currently watching 2nd
Tropical Rouge PreCure and Space Patrol Luluco
Imma try to shuffle between two shows
I support her campaign for queen
Laura is the bomb
Yes
~~A purple secondary Cure whaaaaaat~~
Also
True
And goshdarn ain't she just a kind soul
Transformation and attacks aren't quite as good as Summer's but still really good
I can kinda feel Sango's bit of backstory there
Jokes aside
I feel like making PatRen #3 jokes but eh
Finished Ep 3 of Tropical Rouge
Noice
💸
You watch LotL
Nice
||I kinda forgot tbh||
||Oh right they were||
Only exception I can think of is Promare
THE OLYMPICS
Welcome in place of anime
Ladies and gentlemen
I notice her 'white pupils' more than Manatsu
Also for some reason
She makes just as many wacky expressions as Manatsu and Laura here
But no
Like I thought she was the calm one
Also I find Sango's expressions odd here
But as a civilian she's all about the o's and ^'s
Apparently as a PreCure she's allowed to smile
And with the story of the episode
I guess from the title of the episode
Dunno
Heyo
~~If she doesn't say Saber's catchphrase by the end of the series~~
Also I swear I kept making Saber jokes with Inori
She knows when not to be full of herself
I really like how Laura is portrayed here
3 down, 1 to go
Episode 4 of Tropical Rouge done
Mango-flavoured melon bread with sugar stars(?) is the only way
No
I'll pass
No thx
Okay then
That's mango-flavoured
Does it contain melon bread
It's a tie between Summer and Flamingo for favourite Cure design of this season
And now
But hey at least we have the full base team now
Was bread
And all it convinced her to join
Asuka is bloody powerful
Episode 5 finished
Aight
I guess I'll go for episode 5 with Asuka
Anyways...
You can have one Lexi
https://twitter.com/kasekyun/status/1408632908164657153?s=19
I still need to reach episode 21...
Oh right
Absolute mwah
Ayahi Takagaki as Jade
Also
Ghost Quartz
But you know who's my favourite gem for some reason?
AI KAYANO FTW
Give pats to Shinsha
Also
||They basically became a monster by the end||
||And then Phos went emo||
||And then we cried over their lost friend||
Yes
~~Phos would be more useful~~
If only Rutile was given the Medic's gun...
There's the medic
And oh yeah
And the toothpaste one
And the orange one
And the yellow old one
Like the twins
And then there's some other ones
...in a sense
Bort is cute
Seriously gems with glasses would look cute
And if the Wiki is to be believed some sort of eyewear
~~Then again they could use a lesson in mental therapy~~
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Humans are extinct by then so who cares what we think
Not like the gems are bounded by the laws of humanity
I thought you were still talking about Phos
Oh
Wait what
Depends on what you consider "heavy sci-fi"
||RIP||
||Absolute respect||
||They really animated that whole cannon team finisher just for a not so subtle jab/reference to its franchise's brother||
So wow um
Finished
Oh boi here comes the seal...
Watchin Episode 7 of Tropical Rouge
Are we talking about sci-fi or about Dr Stone
Then again I'm not an expert on sci-fi
Although I have watched something from the cyberpunk genre
I don't think I've watched an anime that is pure Sci-Fi (aside from Godzilla SP)
Hmm
Naw I'm joking
||~~Star Wars~~||
Here's my definition for sci-fi
To Neptunia
To Star Wars
To Dr Stone
Sci-fi
We shifted from
coughMagicalGirlClubcough
They either are powerfully traumatizing or just laughably edgy and dark
Naw
||Tasty rock||
Nicu nicu
Apparently people just can't take a joke?
||Gottsa go fest||
And people have definitely put this to good artistic use...
The anime does skimp out on a few details
You can just read the manga
Or alternatively
||Yeah just go from there||
||It's somewhere within the early to mid 30's mark||
Aight
Unless you don't mind spoilers
Cause it's spoilers
Nope
Patiently waiting for Ch. 96
And here I am
Then continued on the manga where the anime left off
Tho I started with the anime
Depends on what experience you want
||you wish||
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
~~They kinda doin nothin productive~~
Well I mean
||Mentos the Freshmaker||
||I wonder if they're mint flavoured||
It's what happened in Ep2
Look at Ghibli
I mean
Like how many anime do you know that have went into development hell
||Also she's one the mains so not gonna happen||
||PreCure dying is either an impossibility or a *very* rare occurence||
||Naw she's one of the mains||
~~I wonder what Madoka and LotL's development stories were then~~
Hmm
Aren't they both plays on established genres?
It would've been an automatic failure if it sucked at Ep 1
No seriously
WEP wasn't an Ohto-matic failure
At least we can say
Welp
Or at least Cyberpunk 2077's
I'm starting to think WEP's development must've been similar to more recent BioWare games
And then he made Ponyo as an 'apology'
Hayao butted heads a lot with his son
Apparently during the production of Goro's first film
Which means June is almost over
29th
Nope
Anthem
Or rather one game's development
It could be compared to one studio
Wait no
~~Yeah you can tell the animators definitely took their time~~
Like someone just forgot to push on the brakes and ended up veering off course
Kinda sad that this anime basically fell on its face as soon as it ventured too far
You ain't touchin them
🔫
Aight hell naw
https://youtu.be/DRUzKPD68W0
With the fist
She is one
Was she a *Borr* to listen to
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
The UK is spared of love live
Finally
Understandable
I did watch the original Eva series so
Then again
So there may be less restrictions on what it does for psychological stuff
This is also released in the 90's
Not sure if I'll be ready for this
Considering how much warning I have seen about watching WEP
It's the Almighty Goddess back at it again
I think NOT!
Coincidence?
But her sense of humour actually belong here
Seriously the All-Star films basically relied on her being the funny one
Erika isn't the sole comic relief this time
Finally
https://youtu.be/BBcK7f0fRl8
Also the trailer has dropped on the official PreCure channel
Let's just hope we're not jinxing ourselves
Tropical Rouge's pretty solid and Heartcatch's deemed as one of the best PreCure series
I'd say we got the best of both worlds here
Either way
Were there any relations between the two teams?
With this and Healin Good's movie
Wait
And now we have two teams (likely selected by plot) teaming up
We have All-Stars, current + two prior teams,
PreCure had been experimenting quite a bit with crossover films eh?
Loris does not share the same opinion
~~I recommended it to him~~
I guess it'll really be ||10000 years||
Welp
~~Beastars Season 3 in 2023~~
When they're done with all of Beastars maybe
Too much science and 'technobabble'
Same thing with me and Godzilla SP tbh
He certainly was not experienced in writing sci-fi
Considering Nojima's past
It became scrambled eggs
Instead of a pretty omelette
Like I understand getting out of your comfort zone to do something more ambitious
And the writing started diving
He branched off of what he does best
Like I think he wrote for an anime to avoid having to deal with controversies and sponsorship
The revolution
It has begun
The final one I think?
Season 3 baby let's go
Coolio
They just won't publicly release it
They have it
That's the thing
Gainax may have it in their archives
At least online
Is it officially considered lost media then
Well
What happens now
Soo
Good to know you shattered your own confusion
Inazuma Eleven?
So
~~I wonder who was responsible~~
Why'd you take it so serious?
That was just a joke
Also you can still engage in convos even if you disagree on something
No one said anything about that last point
But that doesn't the mecha genre is defined by that
https://twitter.com/discotekmedia/status/1420077709158359042?s=19
But they actually aren't
Perhaps
Like I wouldn't blame you if you put Optimus Prime in SRW
But it's not like you could differentiate them from Gundam or anything so
Again on the outside
Well
They basically look like giant robots
By aesthetics yes
They count as sci-fi for me
And don't require pilots to properly function
Since the Transformers are technically a living species
I think to me
I'd chalk Transformers up more as sci-fi
But that's a minority
Granted a few have displayed the ability to be controlled by others over the years
They're alive
Also the Transformers aren't just robots
And even that was chalked up to them using toys from that line
It was only in the early days
But Transformers itself is separate from Diaclone
Noice
It's MetalGreymon with more badass armour
Like how 02 introduced Armour Evolutions and Tamer doing Bio Merges
Honestly I just saw it as that this season doing something different
I would assume people would've quit Tamers during the second half
If that's the case
Probably because it's not like the typical Digimon formula
I mean that one's adapting from a song
Several standalones still manage to have good visuals *and* story
Yeah
The 5-star disappointment
But everything else is subpar
It's gonna be one of those anime that *looks* great
At least the art style's good?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I guess Gurren Lagann since it and Promare are literally the only other mecha anime I watch aside from those?
Twitter amirite
I hear Gunpla talk
And how long ago was that
~~Smash Ultimate anime when~~
Well if we're not counting Pokémon that is
Like....Fire Emblem?
I think Hugtto's kinda in a similar situation of 'anniversary' to Kamen Rider Decade
(like most Toei anniversary stuff now that I think about it)
It's a probamatic anniversary season
So
That is was too focused on Lala
I think one of the complaints was
But is not classified as one
The previous one had *Cure-like* powers
I think Hugtto was the first series to give us a proper male PreCure?
Also
But are not actually anniversary seasons themselves
Where both seasons hit a certain series number milestone
I will agree Hanabi (red shirt one) looks the most like it tho
Every driver is this series are Yu-Gi-Oh rejects I swear
Go wild
https://twitter.com/AniMeForLifeBoi/status/1440745402613985289?s=19
Okay how did SAO turn into Index
Well it is space
~~Probably will be~~
<@!87512939107450880> He did leave
Welp
Lemme try askin him
I heard the OP and it's quite catchy
I should do Ghost Game
You sold your soul to the devil
When you sign a contract to be Magical Girl
So you can say
Yup
Probably because you see it so much nowadays it's weird to see a show that's *not* like that
Keyword is *tries*
One opposes the typical Shoujo tropes while the other *tries* to convince they're okay
Cause both shows are quite alike and quite the opposites
Utena vs. Go Princess PreCure
I guess the best comparison would be
Really big in terms of anime breaking gender roles
I heard Utena was like
Yeah
Pre-Madoka: :)
Post-Madoka: ;-;
Okay so continuing the thing from <#336310266654490624>
My favourite Disney princess
Black Rock Shooter
Oh yes
The most a Cure season had was like
Or even Gaim?
Doesn't Ryuki have more?
How did you know
B-but ||Kouta...||
That's what ||God|| said
And all I can remember is Megumi's clashing outfit in ep 1
Isn't that season another divisive one among the fandom?
Oh boi Cure Ace was quite the hot topic
And then there's Cure Ace
Then again many people hated Doki Doki so
I mean some did complain in recent years of the oversaturation of isekai
Do you really want it to be like the Battle Royale scene where the market becomes oversaturated with them
7
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I can't believe someone who did work on Shin-chan would end up directing Devilman Crybaby
Eyyyy
Because you like sticking out from the crowd
It's anime-styled but it's a cartoon
I assume the manga will restart soon after Splatoon 3's release
Yeah 
It's also been almost a year since that happened as well
~~Besides it's been almost an entire year since the manga's announced hiatus back in December last year~~
Most of us do
And the vibe really is hittin me in the right ways
Also Gammamon is precious must protecc
I already am so interested in watching the rest
So I checked out the first two episode of Digimon Ghost Game
~~Not unlike them Bayformer films~~
So the "cool but unfocused" way
In the good way or bad way
You know something's wrong
When an anime is called out in an article for being a shoddy knock-off of Symphogear
Yikes
Then can it be considered a 'good' series
Or like a bootleg of some sort
Should takt be considered a knock off of Symphogear
Here's my question tho
||10000|| <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
And what's 100 squared?
I assume they meant it as a "we will still be thriving a century from now"
Well
Also that last sentence is a little
And then the ||Moon arc||
Might as well
Gotta do the ||Ghost arc||
Wait so
No nationality barriers?
That's rough buddy
Ouch
~~Watch as they announce Beastars S3~~
But c'mon
I know this probably doesn't mean much
Don't do this to me Orange
https://twitter.com/CGWjp/status/1463749336731369477?t=Ec0ylijcbk28NcS3aEnDzQ&s=19
~~Much like Phos did~~
You'd probably suffer
So effectively working there living on minimum wage would be impossible if not extremely difficult
Yikes
I can't believe Kuuga ripped off Hibiki
omg Symphogear invented the concept of songs
It's just a happy little coincidence
Seriously Ghost Game is like one of the only anime that I'm currently interested in watching
2010's anime ruined me
~~Let's just hope it isn't hiding a true dark disturbing nature~~
Ooo
So that's like at least 3 or so months
Whoop
Alright Alexis
Let's see if I am hyped for Gunbuster
Like have one memoria of Ohto and Gen with Hibiki and Noriko
That's gotta be worthy of a collab
||Alexis told me about it||
Yup
Mainly with S1 and G
Also also
Damn are the similarities with Gear quite strong here
~~Probably would also explain the training montage~~
Ah I see
It's like I swung through an entire character arc in one episode
Also Noriko is just amazing here already
Seriously I would want him as my coach
And seriously
Who is a better coach than Ohta
I love all the characters in it, the action while minimal definitely pack the punch
I haven't started on any mecha anime in a while 
And this was *definitely* a great place to restart
Okay so 
Completed the first episode of Gunbuster
Even if it says everyone is here
There's always more to come
Like Smash Ultimate
Who says they've used up everyone
Flaming boi Lio is the man
Yesiree
||kind of is tbh||
Congratulations 
You survived year 1 of ||10000||
https://twitter.com/HousekiCount/status/1474448718506172420?t=sMNowYwLZIIr-dthwR7VHQ&s=19
Yes you do 
You watch mecha
Isn't that one where the idols are like
Outlaws
No more idols until you finish your mecha collection
Then it's settled
Mel is a mod therefore
Domination points
No Loris you should listen to me and Mel
I'm sure Love Live can wait
I should
And you should watch it too
Also you reminded me that I *should* get back into Gunbuster
~~I mean isn't that the case with every S1 of a show~~
Well more so *was* a school idol
I have the final say
As his geographically-closest friend
OVERRULE
🔫 <:MariaNo:672658725986762764>
No idol until you finished all mecha
Remember
Have fun
What did you buy that was broken tho
I assume you're still scarred from you broken Shinkalion 500 Type Eva figure
I didn't say that
Does it work
Y'know what
Go for either Eureka Seven or Gundam 00
Watch Gunbuster
No
She knows her mecha stuff
Alexis can give you a suggestion
Actually I know
I'm sorry you're going down 🔫
I have never seen a phone number with letters before tho
Hmm
Actually has Nanjo been playing any major roles since Gear?
Where be Hikasa and Nanjo be at
Yuki as Cure Grace
Mizuki as Cure Blossom
Takagaki as a villain
Kayano as a villain
Iguchi as Cure YumYum
So
Hmm
Gotta say 
Pretty bangin
Oh yeah here's a preview for the OP song https://youtu.be/MzysfMb4vwg
Let's hope it isn't too charcoaled
~~And it's now outperforming Super Sentai in toy sales~~
Damn we got two Gear actors this time
**C R U C I A L**
Wait no
Let's hope they have learned some **crucial** lessons
So does that mean ||Seven times the suffering and trauma||
PreCure season themed around swords
Here's a thought
Cure Outside
Girls und Precure
Won't have to ask for outsider help
And like
In the English Dub Ladybug has Homura's VA
So why not
Welp the French are milking Miraculous Ladybug already
Like a final season or something?
Wait what's happening with AoT
I did not need to be reminded of Owen Hart and Steve Irwin's deaths
Hold up the Das is watchin KLK?
Thanks I can't sleep tonight now
I may need a little help confirming that
Uh
Even with monetary limitations
They still managed to hold it together
This is how you know a studio can work well
That keeps playing the wrong roles
So he's just a mediocre actor
Did he do something nefarious in the past?
Why tho
I thought OVAs like these are for a specific kind of story
~~Why are there so many Gainax OVAs~~
Thinking of giving original FLCL a go
Hmm
I can't believe they would have any doubts about Delta in the first place
Dang Ryu having the same VA as Saitama
Then again I haven't rewatched it so
I suppose it represents the game well enough?
It was okay
The original Persona 4 anime
The only peace of official Persona media I've dabbled into was
Like somehow everything about RWBY that *isn't* the main show is at least decent
~~You know it's bad when your Chibi spinoff series is better than the main show itself~~
Yeah the beginnings were promising
Basically depends on how you feel during a day
So
Would you say it's now better than SaBoH
So how much did you like Belle
~~I think my dad was even questioning how much you liked the film for you to watch it this many times~~
Okay that's essentially done
Back from your 5th watch of Belle I see
Oh hi
Or at least something similar
Apparently so
Just take a look at this https://youtu.be/DyabOcG8aeY
It's CG but
(or anything for that matter)
Do not watch the show and expect the animation to be decent in the slightest
I recently discovered this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naria_Girls
Speaking of CG in anime
Hmm
Only LotL for me
So far
I guess they should stick to minerals and/or anthropomorphic animals
It made following the plot feel worse than trying to solve an algabra question
That was my least favourite part
Yup
Orange did also collab with Bone to do that Godzilla anime last year
I say tries very loosely
I mean at least RWBY *tries* to make it work?
So two of those are from Studio Orange
List a few
Studio Orange this is not
I've seen the trailer for this
Ooo
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
~~(Shows a bunch of releases to anime no one has ever heard/cared about)~~
People really still be that spiteful of them eh
Oof
15 years after the anime's release
She for real doin the Gurren Lagann space arc
Speaking of Steins Gate
I think we all know
Oh the one where Aoi Yuki was the lead
But Heartcatch was arguably one of the standout ones
19 series in fact
Yes
Anime from over a decade ago which rocked the fanbase and genre by storm...new anime which has gained massive popularity...
Hmm
Welp
What a coincidence
Yup
And now I actually kinda wanna start watching the show
Listened to a VTuber cover of the opening
I mean the Imagin character from Den-O
No
~~In terms of character being milked she's basically the PreCure equivalent to Momotaros~~
I knew someone had to do this sometime or another
The anime where anything can happen
Ah yes
Not trying to alienate anyone into dropping the show
Just know that people are getting somewhat tired of the same old mediocre stuff
There's no ignoring all the writing trainwrecks
Like if you like the main show all the power to ya but
It's sad that everyone doing something of the series aside from the main RT team themselves can make something that is actually competent
Though that series' depiction of Miku was a *very* different character to the original
In the first series of Shinkalion
She already has a character in anime
Technically
Somehow I still don't get what this is about even after watching the trailer
Must be a Konami moment
A thing under the helm of Konami that doesn't credit people aside from the company themselves?
If Telltales couldn't even complete their series what luck does this have
And was a swordfighter
And if Sinon was a mecha pilot
It does that too
Yup
Well that's who I presumed the other person was talking about
Yup just as I thought
I assume dubbed
It was on Disney?
omg it's that cursed gif
dew it
~~Announces delay at the last minute like what Disney did with Amphibia S2's finale~~
At last
Rocklords anime adaptation
It just depends on context
Yeah these things can sometimes overlap
That's how it's normally abbreviated
I guess this is the closest to actually getting a film
So apparently for the 10th anniversary of Toho Animation they're screening all 12 episodes of HnK
Actually nevermind
Is that milk or is it
Who knew bullet trains can make for some cool robot designs
~~Ohei it's Jetfire~~
3 years before the show began
There was actually a line of toys from 2015
They did
Well not sci-fi
Welp
I guess this is sci-fi
Welp, there goes subtly
Kinda looks like if the character designer designed a Pokémon Trainer by themself
Makes me wonder if they'll eventually get it for its sequel and what they'll do for then
Probably might depend on both fan hype and if they can get the first one right
It's either another extremely dark series with a fancy happy exterior or just as wholesome as it makes out to be
~~I can't believe saying "Stitch is an anime character" is a fact now~~
Yeah
I found the beef stroganoff peeps
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
That shit did not age well
Probably the only person who has watched Twin Princess of Wonder Planet
List one anime you feel like you're the only one who has seen it
Aight mates
Here's a prompt
I heard about that VN/film
Is it really that gut-punching
Where the hell is this in
plot armour
So it's basically what happened with the start of Sailor Moon Crystal
Is it an adaptation or does it do its own thing
To be clear here
~~I can't believe Miraculous Ladybug lied to me about Paris~~
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Yikes
...the hell do you mean "much more"
What even is this thing
Not sure if you can call that 'much more'
Hell sometimes into the high 40's
Most of the series reach into the 40's
The one voiced by Aoi Yuki
I guess they really shafted us into this
Who's the one holding him tho
Wonder what this might mean for animated Nintendo projects...
Screw the recolour tho
10/10
The original form
Also his mecha
~~Yes better than Cure Passion or Cure Scarlet~~
~~Honestly Seiryu's better than like any reformed PreCure villain turned Cure~~
Yup
The enemy turned train lover
Ah yes
Things in the movie that were developments from the series
There are like
Good question
Um
The series is guilty of this too
Tbf
And then they had two super combinations almost back to back
2 minutes or so
Also the movie exclusive mecha's super form was shown off for like
||Hayato's dad becomes a kid||
And the rest of the film isn't much better
It's absolute nuts
yup
A large fanfic wet dream
It's like
~~agreed~~
I guess this is good news...?
So how was experiencing tripping balls for the first time
You finished it didn't you
Never went back to it
I watched up to ep 2 and like
Oh yeah there's also the sequel series
Turn down the volume on your device(s)
I have one piece of advice
Diamondbolt roasted his performance
~~Even tho I think he only played Devastation like...once?~~
Tho it's kinda odd since Galadima's own art on Insta looks relatively modern
Is it just me or is the artstyle very 2000's
How true is that statement tho
oh no
Did Discotek's Twitter just turn into a weather report channel
Oh crap I forgot it releases today
I just stop listening to anything Gigguk since 2021
I did not know there was a saint seiya 3d anime
hold up what
That'd be a combination too powerful for us mere mortals to comprehend
Like I get that they're supposed to be a kid friendly brand
Honestly
Kinda depressing that Disney doesn't want to do this sort of show
Basically I think they just wanna make more shows more like SpongeBob
I'm guessing Disney now wants to pivot towards shows like The Ghost and Molly McGee
Cause there's no serialisation and it's more of a kiddy tone
I guess like
The themes present in it didn't seem like something strictly for kids
The article stated "The Owl House did not fit Disney’s brand because it was serialized and attracted an older audience."
Probably cause they had made a history of films primarily about men and women relationships
Or at least that's what she said on a Reddit post regarding why the show could be cancelled
Apparently according to an article Dana Terrace (show creator) said it was about branding
OWL HOUSE DESERVED BETTER
How bout we add one more to that list
Yooo let's goooooo
So um
Why did they take them off in the first place
Then again a few months ago Disney had been under fire for the Florida bill
They're not treating it as story opportunities 
They're seeing it as financial opportunities
It's just kinda insulting tbh
Kinda depressing that LGBTQ+ stuff is like
Being shunned by companies because they're not big money makers
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Tho never ever watched it
I know of its existence
At least it's only for a month this time
Okay yeah no sorry
When tho
Cause there's at least a good amount of other people there
Although when it comes to anime films it seems people really also wanna see them too
Me and my friends had a few of those moments
Movies can run late, and I'm the dumbest in the world
Two facts in the world
Aight aight I get it
I know
Or this may be at a different timezone
I guess
Why are you there at like
11pm
~~Why do I feel like you're also telling me that as well~~
https://animegalaxyofficial.com/spy-x-family-creator-reveals-he-has-no-attachment-with-the-characters/
I have to get prepared for college the very next day
~~Too bad the eBay prices for all toys of the 500 Type EVA are like wallet-shattering~~
Once you've watched it
This is like
A crossover you're certainly not gonna forget
And now you shall light your torches and hold them up here
~~Owl House is what MahouTsukai PreCure should've been like~~
Also imma make a hot take for all you PreCure fans
~~Kinda funny Disney released two shows that are basically isekais practically next to each other~~
The Lord of the Rings
Are you telling me it's longer than like
Also gotta love Alex's little wink-wink https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/1570088456549969920?t=h64-6cd51L9OfVPHwk2Hbw&s=19
And I gotta say
No matter what Disney says
This is the type of animated show we kinda want to have more of
Well
Haven't sat down to watch the show in full but I've definitely seen bits of it
People were asking for a great game
And they did not deliver
CD Projekt at this point should not be the ones asking people what they should do
Okay imma say something real bad but
RWBY is literally one of the most popular web shows/anime
Not that that's an uncommon thing but
The buzz kinda just died over it as the series went on
Haven't seen it but
Polish be plunging themselves rn
Wait is like
Grave of the Fireflies super sad or something
I can't tell which team I'd rather be on if I were in Japan at the time
anotha one
Considering the games'...other issues
And I don't think people really wanted to play Rise of Lyric/Shattered Crystal after watching the show
Oh right
Does the Sonic Boom cartoon count as one of these
Wait
~~EA Ceo on H3H3/Impaulsive podcast~~
Official documentary series about EA headquarters and how their business is beneficial to the gaming industry
What's next
Official Overwatch animated Netflix show
Due to production issues or something?
I think it was like
The staff team *cracked* under the pressure
I guess you can say
And got pissed because they didn't get more
They wanted more
Because people really loved this series
Lemme guess
~~Besides other anime have done worse errors~~
You can't blame them for accidentally missing a small thing like that
I mean
When you have to work like hell for anime in Japan
It will definitely be horror alright
Probably not the type of horror the dude intended tho
And apparently a very popular VTuber animator/storyboard artist is working on it
So yes you peeps can watch the series on the Tube

This is the real OP
Child's play
Pfft
No we are Irn Bru
Wait no
Would you like some Irn Bru
Is that an orange mech holding a giant spanner
~~I swear to god if someone sneaks in a rickroll in an episode~~
So probably not enough people will be seeing it
Probably cause the franchise's too niche
I think to some companies 
They probably just don't find any financial benefits for a VN style revival
So the game has to be tied to them too
But the announcement was about the overall game
Would you really want to play XDU on your home consoles
I mean
It was one heck of a thing
i saw that one
oh lord
~~why the zababa colours~~
That's good but
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Sum up what the chat was all about in there
As all things should be
Perfectly balanced
Did they actually just put a meme into their show
Once you're used to animating one type of creature, it makes animating any other type of movement a challenge (tho there are ways to ease it)
Basically
This is essentially the reverse
Since they're so used to the more horse-like pony movements
I remember I heard how the MLP:FiM animation team were kinda thrown into a new experience animating bipedals
And horses' movements work somewhat different
The fact that humans are the most common things to animate
I think it's just like
indeed a classic
Someone already working on a knock-off
Damn
Okay yeah that makes sense
~~I envy/pity people who animate spiders without using rigs~~
Was it worth the huge financial push
But the question is
It may be costly
This is unexpected
whyyyyyyyyyy
How did they do in the following years
Yeah but
Or like one that works off of licenses
Wait is DR Movie like a big animation studio
Not quite sure how these two franchises are gonna blend
Certainly gonna be a thing
This is um
Or she probably stole from of the tech from the Tardis
It just seems like Burton's time in the sun has long passed
Or at least as successful as Nightmare Before Christmas
Like how many of his recent projects have been big successes
I mean nowadays nobody really considers Burton anything more than a joke so
You can speak of a psychotherapist to help manage it but that's basically it
And Ehler Danlos has no cure
Yikes
only one other anime broke the 10,000 sale mark
damn
welp y'all know what to do
yeah
Last time there was Gundam but no Geats/Donbrothers
Consider this week a trade off
I guess this is a trade off for not having PreCure/Kamen Rider/Super Sentai last week
oh
Just thought up the question when I was talking to someone else
No
and the whole franchise
What do you all think of Yuki Yuna is a Hero
Aight time for a question
In regards to art direction
They really know how to make each of their films feel distinctive
Gotta give them props tho
It's like the new big thing rn
For whomever else is interested in this, get some popcorn
https://twitter.com/glitch_prod/status/1593349556087160832
Speaking of robots
I almost read that as Ballbuster
I heard that it's gonna be releasing in June next year
Yeah
Probably all mostly different from the previous types in the first film
6 huh
You have Suletta with the Rudolph nose lol
wait what
At least they now made a reminder telling you it's never gonna happen
||Gotta say hearing Kurosawa's voice out of monster Phos is probably the weirdest thing||
There's also now a billboard trailer for Vol 12 with Tomoyo Kurosawa (Phos) and Mikako Komatsu (Cinnabar) reprising their roles
Oh yeah
Will I also need a projector
But will the anime be any actual good
cool i guess
But he's forced into it because of some Japanese heritage BS I don't fully understand
~~Unfortunately for his son, he ain't gonna be like Raiden~~
I can't believe Hayao's not fully in retirement yet
she's everything now
welp
~~If you count a lot of the final boss kills from both series and movies~~
We should rewatch Promare for our Christmas party
YES
Oh right
This is gonna be a thing
~~and yet he has barely aged throughout all that time~~
So about 25 years
The 1st episode of the 1st series was 1st aired in 1997
I guess so
They will turn anything into a mecha nowadays won't they
Like Skywarp?
She had like 
2 to 3 episodes to herself
And then she was about as relevant as a Season 1 crowd-filling Decepticon
https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1604414941544427520
wait what
God and I thought WEP's production was messy
~~I didn't even know KanColle had an anime~~
Toxic fanbases are pain amirite
What a day
Kamen Rider and Gear in top 10
Is it bad I haven't actually watched any of these anime this year
Imagine your manga baby being so bloody popular you need to be isolated from everyone else so you actually have room
~~I can't believe so many people can relate~~
3 or 4 other categories
I saw that Bocchi also won like
I would not think the artstyle and character design would even lend themselves into fanservice
Character designer for Monogatari
Huh
Most of us just don't have black holes in our guts
I never watched any
Idk
As a representation of the year of 2022 in anime
Does it deserve the title of Anime of 2022
But
I'm sure Bocchi is legit S rank
Ranking MHA in A rank tho...
(although I mean was anyone surprised)
Not surprised Edgerunners takes top spot
She even voices a PreCure
there's an *explosive* amount of anime with her
I guess you can say
She can either become god slayer or god herself
Oh wait I remember now
~~Does that mean Aoi Yuki can't transform anymore~~
Wait
Or even want anything new
What happens when none of the big players have anything new left
Like I get recognizable brands would probably attract more people but
And I am not happy of this trend either
Getting shafted left and right
New animation series nowadays are like
Then how is the very first leader black and another one's pure rainbow
~~gotta love a title that can be taken out of context~~
I did find a thread on MAL saying he accused Trigger of plagarizing his work for Gridman https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1753188
Oh huh
Can he send a flood down on humanity for our wickedness
Okay but why is he a god
So you want me to keep asking who
or am I offending someone by asking that
who
I assume the creators need a break or something?
Everyone's talking about this show
Well I mean
i probably should've expected the larger corperation to not care about pay
oh
Netflix or Glitch
Wait
THANK YOU GLITCH
YES
Since they keep murdering them faster than Formula 1s
They have virtually no more shows left
What is the Netflix equivalent of Spongebob tho?
And probably a bigger one considering Sega's much larger stature
That'd be a PR nightmare for Netflix
Ain't no way they cancelling Sonic Prime
I should
~~Makes me miss traditional animated films~~
one day film 4 was showing a film with the same animation director i believe
i heard of that film
oh hey
~~we do not and we will never~~

if it gets much worse then maybe
Did someone unleash a new covid plague there or something
Like holy hell
Apparently the new Nier anime is also getting delayed
it is an aniplex show
yes
probably a "delayed until further notice" thing
and who is the infected
what the hell is going on over there
dang
Welp
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-01-22/blue-archive-smartphone-rpg-gets-tv-anime/.194074
Maybe I should start checking out some other shows
I have only really known about the 2012 show, the bay film and Rise
~~all of the nick power rangers seasons tbh (except for maybe Dino Charge) are kinda bleh~~
ah yes that's a classic right there
I guess Samurai Jack is now a series about crossovers
What a way to bring it full circle
Someone's gonna make an entire YouTube series based on doing things that fictional media says to not try at home
From Venti to Iruma to Murasame to Cure Wing
Probably the quickest jump in terms of prominent roles
This will be interesting
claymation star wars short
huh
Like an occasional surprise
Yeah
But there are certainly hints of gay in there with some pairs
(because it is a kid's franchise that has to abide to certain rules)
Certainly not to the extent of Gear
Not saying it's unlikely to see it again but it isn't gonna be a common thing
It's probably gonna be like how DonBros' bold experimental thing is likely gonna be a one-time thing
Cause this sort of thing's not gonna be a thing going forward
It's most likely gonna be a one time thing
Now here's hoping they do treat him with much respect
Also when I first found out Wing being a boy my mind was kinda blown
Yup
man success career stories sometimes have the weirdest origins
Where's her watch
hold up where you watchin this
~~probably what you should also do if you want to watch RWBY V9~~
piracy
Def looks like a witch anime film
||Some of the fight scenes really reminded me of Spider-verse's animation style, and they looked so bloody cool||
Don't know if this is spoiler but I'll spoiler in just in case:
yaaasss
I don't know what exactly held me up
I might actually finally check out S1
Hmm
Time for Round 2
what the actual hell is going on over there
A delay within a delay
what
dang
Guess there's a new creeper in town
Nothing much has changed
Like my dad also watched Maverick and even he just said
both times my reactions were "welp this is def a top gun film"
I already watched the film twice
~~After over a decade chapter 100 is finally here~~
