Even using negative interest rates to boost demand in the economy
Japan has had major problems with it
Once you get in a deflationary cycle it is difficult to break out
Deflation is really really bad
Around 2% inflation is considered healthy
Maybe she‚Äôs still a ghost now
<:WowAlicia:257578456441815041>
i am aware yeah
that monster
don't mention fate
i'm just curious haha
very complicated

i already seen most of this
so much
yeah there is
<a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>

<:salute:670347183098167346>
i haven't seen kamen rider xd
....
Symphogear -> Nanoha
rewatching and stuff that is
earlier today i made myself a watch/read order for the future

yes i love magical girls
hello
yes.
<a:grabby:622497135178285086>
I need more
Nanoha content
Nah stern ship with dearche
Unbased ferret
Aka the writers said ‚Äúalright, yuri is the way‚Äù
Cucked himself
Eins >>
Weeeeee
*there sure are*
We do love some doujins
With all the characters fighting
It‚Äôs like a massive fanservice manga
INNOCENT/S I enjoyed a lot
<:KekWoof:818514251693031424>
They are perfect
Two doctors
Jail and the Florian‚Äôs father (forget the name) interacting in it
Vyn have you read INNOCENT/S
Chaos
Jail
StrikerS has the original doctor ver
Mmhm
Oh yeah yuri sells
Come back dog waifu
What‚Äôs more tragic is arf
Sad that the kid became less relevant
I hate for the meme
He is xd
<:AnnoyedYuuno:951260400748482590>
Stop cucking the yuri
Fucking ferret
<:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>
I am not a reliable judge
I automatically see it anyway
My mind wants yuri in everything
Which is good
It‚Äôs dark but not edgy
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Beautiful ship
I‚Äôd say probably yuri, and by StrikerS well definitely yuri
*we like idols
Hey I‚Äôll take it
Of all things there is going to be a spin off of INNOCENT/S focusing on the dark materials team (dearche, levi and stern)
<:PainNano:945413511813664770>
Doubt
<:toumasmirk:678130679099162625>
Wait geah is
I‚Äôd love to see it
The more the better
Really good
And movie 1st comics are
My favourite is movie 1st, shortly followed by detonation
Rare
Cg done well
<:ThinkingMaria:826013787801780224>
How did I see that coming
Movie or tv or whatever it may be
Which is everyone‚Äôs favourite nanoha entry?
Furries
<a:YuiHehe:870282075738087445>
‚ÄúDays‚Äù is quite grounded in reality for an anime
||i am sure she has no time looping powers||
[revue starlight] ||ah yes a perfectly normal character||
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>

art is really nice
I‚Äôve been reading the manga recently and having a good time
Nice!
Always subtextually gay
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Soothing music
Healer girl had a very nice first episode
Vivid manga > vivid strike > vivid anime
But
And vivid strike  > nanoha vivid anime
They gayed themselves out of existence
art is hot
<:Hehe:585924636504489994>
time to read the manga
nice!
<a:ayunodfast:927237054289559583>
it soothes my mind
best seasonal
blonde hair girl does not approve
F
not great, just good
its good
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
https://anilist.co/anime/7724/Shiki/
i was talking about
.....i may have just realised
Shiki gets better around the halfway point
<:KnoxGrab:853757364518518834>
Just finding the time
<:MisakaThumbs:935223929126125648>
I shall
<a:AzuLaugh:729034689251115088>
Yep
<:HonoEhehe:397831152582524928>
I‚Äôll catch up one day
I‚Äôm on Vol.3
The Ayahi chronicles
Yo I thought the same LMAO
Sugoiiii
Most shows can‚Äôt get it right
Feels natural like they‚Äôre actually speaking together / singing
It‚Äôs the flowy dialogue
And I think I realised
Aside from the singing and the characters I was trying to figure out what draws me in
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Indeed
I only score them if I give them a fair chance
<:XDLevi:257578459759509505>
It‚Äôs all they know
They will make it an ecchi show
I‚Äôm excited to watch it
It looks fun
Damn it
Romcom
What show is this?
<:mikohodo:693610040028037130>
Suffered a lot?
Loved as in
Watching movie soon
I love suffering
It was great
Finished made in abyss tv
Nanoha so good
Should have had Eve talk in Engrish the rest of the series
They didn‚Äôt even try
Lmaoooo
Gay golf
But pretty fun
It‚Äôs stupid
gay golf confirmed gay
the cg is eh
first ep was decent, feels a little low budget tho
Works every time
They made it gay
It‚Äôs easy
<a:PolicemanDance:501569394951061505>
Or the cops are coming
But can‚Äôt have sonata as your waifu
No bad choice
Yep
I stan kanata
who's your favourite girl?
very soon
<:SoonTM:611384640347045888>
space idols
<a:MenheraThumbsUp:803762848689815562>
very good time
finished AKB0048 season 1
<a:ShrugAnim:719416595935658046>
Doing comedy things
Angels and demons in Japan
Look it up sounds like you‚Äôd like
Have you seen Gabriel dropout?
Shamiko is fun
I thought it was good but not good enough to finish
Didn‚Äôt finish
I‚Äôve seen a bit
She‚Äôs realistic
Child characters are a lot of the time
Could have easily been very annoying
I do like her
Plays child characters so well
Misaki Kuno is great as ever
Nothing much happened to can‚Äôt judge
I saw it today
<:Kasunlimitedbreadworks:764162414731591780>
<:ChadShake:939332496938635274>
our top 2 are the same
Best seasonal it has to be
Was a funny first ep indeed
just speculation ofc
so sequel expected
it seems pretty well made and not a quick cash grab on nostalgia
i think that is the likelihood
Like 50, new one has 12
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Watch now
<:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>
So cute
<:Grabiki:967197765971107870>
I gotta watch
So beautiful
Uwroooaagghh
But when Made in Abyss gets going properly it‚Äôll be overtaken
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs my favourite seasonal
üõê
They‚Äôre so gay
It‚Äôs beautiful
same, its underrated by the community
<:ShirabePlease:929758873844350976>
Give new us a new nanoha season
This is going to be ridiculous
What in the heck is that
Mahiro is a cutie
Nothing amazing but good
It‚Äôll be good
<a:MariaSparkle:688839288082792462>
They made it look beautiful
But I‚Äôm so happy
IKR
They were running out of ideas
Mid
Eh
More so Orion
The modern ones
The GO series went a bit overboard but still fun
3 is my favourite
<:SarahPeek:742626863758966874>
