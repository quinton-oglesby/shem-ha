<:DaBasa:828483497982296094>
I'm stealing that one though
<:kekhands:795481916773236777>
Cursed
<:worrygibpls:439422999326621701>
<:Pepega:586019549669883915>
God bless
So I decide to try a Carol raid, and come back to see that some absolute legend did a million damage in one attempt
Forgot to put up a screenshot
Just started a Power raid if any one wants to take a go at it
Oh so that's what that debuff is
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
I think I only got an aid request for friends and followers
I feel like I have no answers for her until her lackeys go down
How do you guys approach green carol?
Doing a green Carol raid rn if anyone wants to destroy one
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Now all I need are the giga miracle crystal which never drops
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Found that out the hard way
Everyone that could help with the raids atm is currently grinding CC
At this point I stopped wasting my cp items on getting top score and I'm trying to law of averages my way into getting enough miracles
Anyways I've only got like 4 Giga miracles
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>  Saw that Haz <:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
Been grinding raids for like the last 2-3 days
I'll have to remember to turn on notifications around this time
Yeah I just going around attacking raids and noticed one that dissapeared after I attacked
Actually you know what I might have caught it on accident
Shit missed it again
Phara got a little less than a quarter of her health
Got a green carol up
Now I just need this type of luck on harder teams
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432> <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432> <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Give me your luck
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Oh wait how the hell did you get all the gigas b4 normals and megas
If you ever decide to do raid I can help get rid of the autoscorers
My team was just cheeks
I take it back
and damn I thought the dex boss would kinda easy after LU rnjii but the thing still claps my cheeks
If anyone wants to help smack the dex boss around i'd appreciate it
feelsbadman

👀
Is <@!123525331343769600> offline?
oh right
body?
ye
game never gives me giga ints<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Should i unpause when it hits 6?
That'd be nice
done
How does this work again? I saw the raid but it disappeared right as i tried to get in
just missed it
alright hold up
How do i always manage to miss these
👀
I wasn't expected xd jii to survive for like 15 turns on her own lmao
Though me doing 800k probably didn't help
Damn that shit vanished when leiur was gone
Leuir is gone so feel free to smack carol
Done
Just went with a team I thought would work but just ended up doing most of my damage to carol instead
I need a better team composition for getting rid of Leuir
Bruh
I'll keep you guys posted on when I get rid of leuir
Bout to start a green carol raid
Need to put burnbasa's face over the firetruck
No one really uses rage anyway
ah
Which ones haven't we done?
Could always use more giga melodies though
Thought there was only 3
I just killed it
Imma keep going
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
Getting dicked by my crappy internet
me
👀

Are only 2 people doing body?
ahegao is also apparently coming back in a couple of hours
I probably went a tad bit overboard on this raid <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
👀
That was the longest amount of turns I've ever spent on green carol
Bout to try and finish off phara
Go to town
Took care of Leiur
👀
I'll tell ya guys when Leiur is gone
Imma have a green carol open in a bit as well
It's only 1hp use 3cp
So 10 people?
<:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>
same
👀
I was just thinking that there really isn't a point to giving out carol raids where leiur/micha are still there since those who don't have LU 5* won't even try to attempt it so I wanted to keep it to myself until those 2 are out of the picture.
Alright cool
If you choose to keep a raid to yourself could you later change it so that others could join in?
Kinda don't need it but i like having giga melodies
so 13
bruh i almost killed it
<:AdamScream:688241618356404224>
LMAO
👀
Can we agree to not use more than one emote?
Well your killing it
Let's move on
It ded
bruh
rip #12
👀
3AM
OH BOY
Imagine getting sleep when this game exists
damn Muj is out for blood
row row fight the powa
9?
I only have it up for friends so you can *maybe* go to town on it

<@!291819980415041537> I've got a miracle raid up w/o leiur rn
I'll keep you posted on when I get rid of leiur
<@!291819980415041537> If you're still looking for gigas I can do another miracle raid
God bless you for this train ahegao
ah
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
^
eh fuck it ill do it
The first count was 5
Oh whoops
Was it supposed to be dex or heart?
uh
god bless ahegao
Oh nice got a giga miracle out of it
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
<@!400844698140409856> Probably went overboard

I'll bop it whenever I get done with the practice raid
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
👀
Ok so my plan for green carol raids once the autoscorers are gone is to stall the boss until the mid 20s where she stops using the heal debuff and then send out xdjii and go in for the kill. Any recommendations on what to bring? Also does anyone know the exact turn she stops using the debuff?
Oh you might wanna clear out some of your followers
Fuck that noise I'm stalling her out next time then
OH WAIT SERIOUSLY
Your code should be there
Go to settings->friends->player search
<@!149266030135345154> You should prob put your code up if you want people here to easily find your raid
Only got one giga miracle out of it <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
143 turn raid boss pog
Wow green carol refused to use the health regen debuff so rnjii just soloed her
Wasn't able to finish off phara
I was just in a green carol raid which kept my billion maiden silenced for like 10-15 turns <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Aww nobody finished it off
cya in 5 hrs
I'm bout to head to sleep
Phara is gone as well feel free to go to town
I'm not sure who else wants to hit this raid
👀
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
That's a strong argument for gen IV being the best
idk gen IV has explorers of the sky and HGSS
Cinccino
Welp you won't have to worry about grinding giga hearts for xd chris anymore
I'm not Cais, I don't have enough 5* 70s to leave the game on autopilot like that
Oh and to answer your question: no I usually don't leave the game on auto when raiding
When it comes to every other boss I'm doing 50k - 200k at most on a 5cp run
And it depends on how I attack green carol which determines whether or not I can solo her
Even then I can only really damage green carol
I was doing about as much damage as you guys b4 I LU xdjii
Just LU a 5*
<@!558134879900925953> Who? Me or Sycreon?
My reaction when i soloed green carol out of nowhere
You get like 1000+ from doing story
your best shot are the xd reruns
In general once you get your first 5* LU raiding should become much easier
It's prob mega deth party
Which unit are you trying to LU?
Hal stealing gigas like usual
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Man I'm so tired, just realized i posted this shit in the wrong channel
Might start doing poor man's sanic/ahegao raids in that case
Oh shit I didn't know that the game saves your progress when you retreat
<:HibikiSmug:672655850518609940>
And then everybody but you gets giga bodies
Wow Hal's actually sharing his mats
But she dies to a wet fart if you don't have her LUed <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
We're probably not going to have a good answer for the burn until xd serena
That dragon is a pain in the ass in general
What units are you trying to LU?
Spent the better part of 3 days gathering materials for xdjii
Just keep bonking, we've all been where your at
That's also a lot of rice
That shit hurts
So many giga dexes, but no units to use them on <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
He kills
Cais doesn't hit
ever
gigas never drop
2 gigas
Oh nice
Yeah I can see that happening
I'm hoping xd kiri will do the same for me <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
It just takes 100+ turns with just xd jii
I was actually one shotting it myself
Ok I guess I'll just finish it off on my end
Oh damn you got it b4 i did
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
I'm going for blood
Might launch a green carol in a bit
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Literally the only raid i need to grind is carol
Alright better start grinding raids for when I eventually get xd chris mlbed
and me after xd kiri makes her rounds again
Cais
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
👀
They never drop
I swear that megas in hard raids are rarer than gigas
Time to run a train <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
damn
kat put in work
Why in the hell do I not have a single good unit that hits for physical
That's a good yield
Have a blue raid up if ya'll want to snipe
Time to whoop ass
Oh fuck you have an hour left on int
Actually managed to get rid of Leiur and Phara b4 Carol went into the 6 digits <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Her ability to annihilate buffs is actually really good for this
Destroyed Leiur in one run
xd kiri is actually wild on big carol
Waiting for my macro to finish b4 I start hitting raids <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Wait what raid do you need?
Oh shit forgot
She's kinda the only one
blue jii
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Terraria did that to me first this year and then I took a break to play this <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
The sense of progression and getting stronger is fucking addicting
I was so use to doing Carol that actually forgot how much health the boss had <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Accidentally killed it
Oops
I don't want to wreck his hunt on accident
Are you going to hit it <@!127991170201681920> ?
I already used my rice bowl cais <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm just gonna get it down 2 10k-20k so you can snipe
<@!279115815494877184> Do you have it on friends or everyone?
Now down to 273k <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I'd say that's good time
Got the int one down to 660k in 20 mins
^^
Once you've done that hit me with an emote
Yeah so I'm gonna announce when the raid is open
Haven't had one in a while cause the guys who do it are busy
Yeah that's how we do it with hacked raid trains <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Since I want to get hunt as well
Since there are 3 of you I need you all to pause until that emote counter hits 4
We'll keep a headcount with emotes
Everybody gets hunt that way
Once everybody has joined, kill the boss
I'm gonna open it up and you guys have to join quick then pause
ye
Ya'll know the drill for how this works right?
Alright so im gonna smack carol around until she's at about 10k-20k away from dying
Once kiri's bday is over I'll change it back
ye
Are all of you following me?
ye
LMAO
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
melodies are normal and magic is for ignite units
The giga needed for xd units
I just need a headcount of how many I'm prepping for
<@!174272493777977344> you too
<@!279115815494877184> <@!368681228741640193>  Do Ya'll need giga miracles rn?
I'm going to be hitting some smol carol right when I'm done
It big
Dang
<@!263392442345193472> Do you need giga miracles rn?
Does anyone want any giga miracles? 👀
I'm going to have a big carol raid prepped for snipping in a moment
People are feening for 5* lv70 units
<@!368681228741640193> cleared some room
Big sad
<@!174272493777977344> You can unpause
ye it's fine
Just beat the boss
Fuck it
Oh there might be a chance that someone already snipped
Hope I didn't accidentally delete you
Are you following me?
Well shit
I don't even know what red indicator means anymore
I didn't want anyone snipping it
I only opened it to friends
big
Who's not in?
It's at 3
Is everyone in?
It should be out now
Alright so I'm gonna open it up
It's done
So you just have to keep xd jii off the field until the last one
She only throws it out 3 times
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Currently at 109 turns
xd jii alone takes forever
Next time I'm bringing in xd kiri
Alright so it's just 4
oh nvm
Still prepping
It's not open rn
<@!279115815494877184> Did you hit the emote above?
Not yet, just doing a head count
Hit the emote
Just do the headcount
^
That's cais territory
I can't slay P carol like i can D carol tho
Doesn't matter for me
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
<@!279115815494877184>
Whatcha need?
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
Don't need blue mats but I do need giga melodies
That raids been whacked by Cais already
No Micha or Garie to worry about
Can one of you guys slap this raid for me? Thx
Feelsbadman
👀
I have lv70 xd bikki following me rn <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829> They need to give me their unit
nice
What's your name ign?
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
I'm at 47/50 rn
I just freed
how tf
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Followed you to make up for removing you <@!676272618839605249>
I've seen all those names and never made the connection <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
<@!676272618839605249> Made room
Oh I got 6 giga miracles out of this
Lmao
Oh wait you were hentai???
You needed a P carol right?
If you need someone to destroy a raid quickly, ping cais
I'll prolly be heading to sleep soon
I guess I'll have enough for XD bikki whenever I decide to invest in her
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

uh
Boss has been bonked
Which halves your damage output
The boss also hits you with blind
Thought I had some bad rng but 400k on a run is pretty average
Her and basa
The one ignite I don't have a single copy of <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I need more good bold units, kinda wish i rolled more on edo
Alright I'll just smack it anyway
Did you send the friend request out to friends and followers only?
It prolly would have been better if i hosted if we were doing that
When did cais send out a hard int <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I can get rid of carol's auto scorers in 10 cp but I need far more to actually beat carol herself
Oh it was cocoa
Who pinged me?
<:HibikiPing:688397678421344268>
Guess I'll stop then
<@!127991170201681920> Are you smacking it rn?
Ye I just got done with my first attempt
First week of raids was rough as hell
We've all been there <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
36k per run w/o a dedicated 5* is pretty good I'd say
ye
Can you clear some of your followers list?
Also what's your code?
<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
<@!457268466429329429> Start up a int boss and I'll whack it
Give me about a half an hour and I can smack a hard int boss for you
I can bonk the autoscorers
If you enhance a 6* unit using another unit you can potentially increase a skill's level
^
Welcome to the grindfest known as skill leveling
Well nothing some more grinding can't fix <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Though you probably should've held on to some of those mats for a 5*
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
I'm switching around xd kiri
fuck
You had worse units overall but still did more damage wtf
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
She's phys
Burnbasa shouldn't even be good for this boss
What units did you even have?
What's this million in 1 attempt bullshit <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Damn satoshi
I'm not sure if green carol is easier than dex raid
It might be 3 i forget
It stuns for like 2 turns but 5* 70s can move multiple times in a turn
If you have a 5* 70 the stun is inconsequential
Whoever electech is, I just whacked your boss down to 500k
👀
Wow I can hit the dex boss for 600k now on 5cp
Front is dr jii, welfare kanade, xd jii and back is burnbasa, erenbikki and mikasachris
So it just added up the damage we both did
I retreated b4 i killed it
Naw
Wow wtf I did 200k w/o a dedicated 5*
It going to add up the damage we both did
I'll retreat then
Uh
I don't want us to accidentally screw up the hunt
I'm still hitting the boss so don't go in until I'm done
btw
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Can you clear some space?
<@!174272493777977344> I'm not following you
It's 3%, 5% and 10%
I'm not going to be too helpful this time around but I'll see what I can do
also <#673253184885489696>
blue
MDP and Burnbasa get atk that goes up into the quadruple digits
Welfare 4*s don't get a good enough boost
Which are irrelevant, yes, but useful for PvE stuff
They basically become lv 60 5*s
4*s get a decent boost
You can negate that temporarily with someone who can delete buffs but otherwise no
Even better if it's dupes
If your luck is really bad you'll eventually end up rolling multiple 5*s in a multi
Giga rainbow <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Oh
I'm in
Who are we waiting for?
Ready
Yeah I'm switching to my phone rn
What'd I miss
ye
Yeah i got 5 giga powers
I'm honestly thinking about replacing stardust foton with xd kiri to remove buffs
Nobody else is worth the supplies
Only the blue and red jiis
Lel
Specifically Testament
We're not gonna be able to breeze through these raids until HC
DeX carol just feels way easier to do anyway
I would use that
Might be wrong about the resistance tho
It isn't technically resistant to it, it just throws out a debuff that lowers phys attacks a lot
You should try for at least one healer and have the rest be at least semi hard hitting special reds or extremely hard hitting special types besides orange
Even if you don't need it you should probably always try for hunt
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
That was the emoji
I'd go for the P but do you not have any better units?
Blue would be more helpful
<@174272493777977344>
I might swap out one of my units for XD kiri early on to get rid of buffs
Only 100k
Damn I can't hit this fucker at all
I only ever go for the guarantees which is why I try to prep 2k for a xd unit I want
The avg roll for getting a xd unit LUed is 10 per 2 banners
And whenever I get xd bikki finished up, I'll have no reason to fight those as much either <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Power and Int is where I go to farm giga melodies
I mean I guess you can get giga melodies
Man Carol just destroys any need to fight the dex and heart raids
Oh did somebody beat your raid already?
Can you free up some space on your follower list so I can follow you?
<@255902541466828801> ye
<@255902541466828801> what's your friend code?
👀
You get 2 rounds of 2 times damage a rice bowl
It you want to be as efficient as possible use 5cp
I've done 200-300k b4 but that was when she wasn't powered up at the halfway point <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Now I get to see if I can deal 100k to smol carol
Nice[
<@!192432957946855424> ?
I'm still paused as well
<@!174272493777977344> is it fine if i kill it?
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Yeah I probably should've stopped after the first one @
<@!263392442345193472> Hit my raid already <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<@!263392442345193472> Can u bonk my raids as well?
Same <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Will keep that in mind
Oh that's a term i've never heard of
So I'm just going to keep collecting waifus I know I won't collect for a while in JP
Why bother participating in *any* service if you know it'll end eventually
Bisa put it the best
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
<@676272618839605249> I apologize in advance
I can solo it from 0
You can honestly just put it up after the first try
<@676272618839605249> done
<@676272618839605249>
I feel like I saw you hit one of his raids 👀
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Sure those will be quick
Calling it by tiers sounds cool asf
2
Probably?
<@279115815494877184> done
Dex, Bold, and Tech
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
<@279115815494877184> yeah I can solo
The only raids I haven't tested for is power and tech
Probably <@279115815494877184>
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Almost died at the fucking finish line
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
~~Somebody tell Hyouka that he posted this in the raids channel~~
#xdu-lewds
lewd
There was never any beginner bonus
I need yellows for prelati so <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Ahegao raids are back baby

My run I did is up above
Got very close tho
Even with meido jii
Even on 10cp, I still can't solo
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/655058014495047690.png?v=1
~~I wish I could solo the hard power raid~~
She also stops buffing herself then as well
no, this is most obvious with bosses like carol who are said to keep passing out heal cuts to make healers useless over the long term but Carol herself stops giving out heal cuts at like turn 19-20
Even then you can still win a war of attrition as long as you have enough healers and tanky units
The next time it happens is when the boss reaches halfway health
The damage ramp only happens up till like turn 20 or 25
ramp?
I put the raid up if any one wants to bonk
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Literally the only raid I can't solo and it's the one that has the least problems
This just in, I cannot solo the power raid
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Serena isn't immune to berserk
Wow
I should give hard power a try now
My b, was konked for a good part of the day
Luck machine broke
Yeah
Gotchu
~~HBS is me~~
Oh can we do yellow after power?

Oh shit we're getting nostalgic as shit in here
When you get in, pause then hit the emote to show you're ready
Bet
We don't know how many people are in this rn
Can we use the emotes so we know who joined?
BTW Nanoha when you enter you pause and wait for everyone to join
This is Hella nostalgic
I'll be getting in one the action too
You get a lot of sheets from the event shop, but you can also just grind MA1-1 for sheets
They advertised it on Twitter and never implemented
Fine won't fucking drop any ancients
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
That was fun
I think I jumped into like 50+ raids to get the gigas
You did that in 3cp?
I'm a big fan of cheese fries myself
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Sure I'll take a couple of Fines
~~Of course if they decide to just arbitrarily drop HC units like Tama then that'll give more reason to grind the Fine raid~~
Test uses the training mats iirc
It's a raid for mats for the alch units
I don't...get the question?
Test will make that raid easier
Maybe
Since they introduced HC units with the Unisons we're likely to see Test soon
Instant ko just makes that move dangerous
You can't avoid it which is the thing
Body raid alone already takes like up to half an hour on manual
Takes too long <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I think it was a player name that HBS came up with for a different game that stuck

I'm tapping out for the heart raids
<@676272618839605249> we're in the yellow now
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
But that's all I care about unless Cocoa wants another raid
I wouldn't mind some yellow raids
Thanks bro
Yeah you either overwhelm her with dps or you bring units that can deal decent enough damage but have immunities to SD
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Now time to wait on the those last copies of UB and Tama to never come
FINALLY
What did you roll on?
Wait Cocoa
I would just stick to yellow for a while. Tama and UB together are about 6.4k stones worth of guarantees if you're unlucky.
She gets around that last one with the increased damage on her normals
Really her only downside I've seen so far are her def (which can be accounted for with her sk2 and Tama) and the fact that she's a spec unit
Yes she's stupid as a unit
Guarantee is on the 3rd step tho
I could sacc her on the first roll which is very possible with the 5* unit guarantee which would make it 2.2k
But my current estimate will be 2.6k
I'm not done mlbing her yet
~~He's grinding for UB~~

baka gaijin don't deserve stories <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
That's dumb
Which means we would've had alchs less than 6 months into the game's lifecycle
Yo you want to know something funny. This was probably the schedule that they had planned already.
Man the alch event was the only one I was interested in too
I doubt it's getting translated with the current track record
doom there's a part 2 coming at the tail end of july
I think we're probably getting the Basa/Kanade unison during the sirius wing part 2 event
Won't matter since they've been jumping around JP's schedule since the beginning
In terms of HC units?
I'm half expecting them to drop random HC in july
Well they could technically just drop the units
We never got the adultverse so it's literally just Test
<@!301227758678179840> Serena can cleanse it, she just isn't immune to it
So I need about 15-20 cp to bonk the lion
🤔
We get gems during CC
Oh right
Only on step 2 of Test banner
I'm not going to be able to do it for at least another 2 weeks fam
That last part somehow lasted for 15 turns
Also put Test in the back with XD jii
Sent Adam to the back as a backup dmg inc in place of Caggy's 50% def down
Putting XD Serena back in did wonders
:15min:

So I'll probably need about 3.9m to LU and get them to 70 assuming I can get the mats
Took like 300k gold to get Adam for 60 to 70
Or the exp sheet missions if they give a good enough output
Looks like I might be grinding MA4 for 4* sheets
Hopefully this team set up will work slightly better

Test never buffs blue's atk outside of her leader skill
Oh nvm they'll "stack". Their buffs don't overlap
Test will probably overpower XD bikki's blue atk up buff
I think I'll switch out some units
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
That and my 50% def down dies to poison
I have a 50% def down but I'm lacking a hard hitter
I don't have Test mlbed yet
Or I could keep it to friends and followers I guess
Keep refreshing until the first person bonks it to collect highest damage
I actually have to start doing the JP strat now
Damn
Put up another one
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
<@301227758678179840> bonk my lion
I wouldn't mind some lions <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Reminds me of blue Carol except she takes 2 turns on 3cp
Need lions <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Everybody who's still playing is flocking to my fl
Btw gametripleml do you want me to free space so you can use my units
Got no gold for shit
I'm more so gold blocked
I'm actually not as XP blocked as I thought I was
Nice managed to bonk somebody else's raid when they were at 70-80% health
Need anything I can get rn
I'm 13 giga finesses away from my next LU
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
I know what I said
<@140931012061298688> You up for a train?
I'm never seen my gold get so low
I'm running out of everything rn
Honestly just having either meido kanade or Adam will let you body the rest of arena
Adam will make any and all healing a non issue
I'd like a round 2 of lions <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Everybody can solo
Both global and JP have the same problem with lions
Ahegao2
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>
So let's just just go ahead
Oh he said hit the next 2
Gotta look fresh no matter what you do
Alright let's slay it
<@177328724759281664> ?
<@676272618839605249>

I'm in
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Lion
She's too fragile atm
I probably can't solo from start until I LB Test further
I managed to finally kill that raid from the rando
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I'm one away from my next LU
Followed
I wonder if it would underflow back to 0 if you hit it then
I'm gonna kill it
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Then you'll be able to drink and sleep <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>

Missing the point of why ygg exists in the first place but eh
<:HAhaa:586779645936926760>
You can only abuse ygg so much daily
You're not supposed to drop loads in the chat anyway if you don't have to
Yes you would have to do them individually
And source yourself
Or just post them all at once and 3_skip
You could

There's only like one manga like that as far as I know
I would def love some more poly yuri
https://twitter.com/katwo_1/status/1401094575851118593?s=20
But I can't verify that <:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Betock tends to do OC art more often than not
Figured
I post art I like
I've never watched Im@s so I wouldn't be able to verify that at a glance and betock didn't upload it to their pixiv so I can't check the tags
Am I supposed to know whether or not it's OC art or fanart just because I posted it?
I wouldn't know

I don't fundamentally disagree with the take

ping Kerrik if you want the finer details on why ygg doesn't take jpeg files
<:AmeliaPepePoint:848349050506838037>
ygg doesn't recognize the not .jpg file
.jpeg
<:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
Or at least it shouldn't but it's pretty inconsistent
Were some of the pictures uploaded to twt or pixiv extremely recently cause ygg can't source those immediately
It's not like ygg isn't finding the sources if you check the ascii link <:LUL:503065035048747008>

Though MVD can probably testify to the conversations between him and D1 taking place
D1's side of the story for anyone willing to believe it
https://twitter.com/xD1x/status/1278694063059976194?s=20
It's like 2 separate things that are pissing me off rn. One is that there are pedophiles in the community and two is that there are people that stay silent about their actions. How can the community be safe to participate in if these type of crimes are entertained until someone with common sense outs them.
I'm really hoping that no one else allowed this to happen but I'm fully expecting more people to be outed
Tweek I hear was there with Nairo so he was complicit and I just found out that another player was complicit in what Keitaro did
There is a 0% chance that no one knew about the shit Keitaro and Nairo did
How hard is it to not touch kids or harass people
Holy shit
I've never been so disappointed for so many people at once
She peaced out without explaining what Zero did to her past the cringy teenage stuff
https://twitter.com/JisuArtist/status/1278844194623115266?s=19
Did you see Jisu's tweet right after that one?
Hell Anti has like multiple coming out about how he forced himself onto them
It could be something as serious as attempted rape or something as stupid as Zero trying to show her some hentai he found on the web and not shutting up about it.
The first 2 sound like the type of cringy shit a teenager would do to another teenager for laughs (and Zero was a minor at the time) but we have absolutely no context for what she means by harassed
Honestly
I'm not sure what to think of this one
https://twitter.com/JisuArtist/status/1278843558401675264?s=19
https://twitter.com/LocusSK/status/1278742853473062913?s=19
Anti and La Luna are getting exposed too <@676272618839605249>
D1 lying through his fucking teeth as MVD points out and another person came out about D1 harassing her and a group of people (D1 included) trying to rape another drunk girl
I've only grown more livid the more I find out about the situations
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
https://twitter.com/zerowondering/status/1278918706362486786?s=20
> people do not come out and make accusations about popular people for fun.
Which is why I believe there's more to the situation than she's letting on which is why it makes sense that Zero's making a formal statement about it
And he's now making a statement about this <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
https://twitter.com/zerowondering/status/1278850906063331330?s=19
Now if Zero comes out and admits whatever he did to her we have a different story
All it takes is an allegation to sway the masses
A lot of people in the comments want to take this seriously but she really didn't give enough fuel to light the fire under Zero's ass.

I'm really hoping she'll have more to say cause if she's actually a victim of something serious she's effectively protecting a criminal.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Puts a lot of things about Zero into perspective
<@676272618839605249> I recommend giving this a read

Jisu is about to run ZeRo into the ground
Pack your bags folks
https://twitter.com/JisuArtist/status/1279375209653403653?s=19
Agreed
I'm angry at ZeRo for doing that shit but now that I'm looking at the situation in hindsight, what he did was nowhere near as bad as the others.
Not that it matters since he's quitting video making entirely
Either that or 20
He was 19 iirc
Also people sending death threats cause there favorite content creator/button presser is being held accountable for their actions can fuck right off
Christ people
Jisu and that 3rd girl I can understand, but Katie is something you can't possibly defend
People still protecting ZeRo like he didn't knowingly ask for nudes of an underage girl
I hate it here
Wow there was a 3rd girl to this mix <:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
Took him 3 twitlongers to actually tell the entire truth <:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
https://twitter.com/zerowondering/status/1279363350997147649?s=19
I don't understand why he felt the need to lie about showing hentai to a girl around his age and just apologize but damn was lying about flirting and asking for nudes from the second girl knowing she was underage is damning.
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
Just woke up today to ZeRo probably lying twice about his involvement with 2 girls
The fact that I wasn't surprised by your story says a lot <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>

Man this reality is fucking sad
Funnily enough the victims can actually press charges against Ally, ZeRo, AnTi, Nairo, and Keitaro cause they all admitted to having a relationship with a minor which is all that a prosecutor needs in court.
Hell Katie still chose to remain anonymous knowing full well ZeRo, whether it be intentional or not, would sicc his fans on her.
Right. It's hard to get out allegations against someone when they're a really popular person too. The entire situation with Jisu and ZeRo was indicative of that.
Getting banned from smash is barely a punishment for raping a minor and sexually harassing others
The problem is people do it and feel like they can get away with it
If we hold people accountable, as in send them to jail, we'd see less of this shit.
I forgot what it was
I believe something did happen to Ally tho
If legal actions were taken we'd see less pedophiles in the smash community <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
The community banned him for a separate reason
Which is why I'm completely fine with Ally and Nairo getting banned
Obviously
He also admitted to manipulating Ally by blackmailing him in regards to the relationship and I believe what he did with said manipulation is what got him banned.
Zack was a minor who had a relationship with 2 adults in the smash community (Nairo and Ally)
~~Can we talk about how Zack manages to find himself in a lot of controversy in the smash community btw?~~
To add to that, Omni said it best:

We need to create a community that instills fear in everyone who wants to harass people or commit statutory rape with kids. Nobody should be able to come into the community, do their thing, and get off with just getting banned from the community which is effectively just a slap on the wrist. We should be holding these people accountable for all of their actions and not encouraging it by turning a blind eye like how Salem and Tweek did with Nairo and Zack's relationship. Accountability will do more good than exclusively age restricting events which misses the point.
Just ban alcohol at events and only age restrict in settings where that has to be alcohol around like bars or taverns.

I'd also like it if kids had chaperones cause leaving a kid alone anywhere just sounds like a bad idea.
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
Then proceeded to break down on twitch
Sky dead ass doxxed the victims when they clearly asked that they didn't want to be named while trying to explain what he knows about what went down in his house

I've looked into some laws regarding guns for a paper back in HS.  The 2nd amendment initially existed so that local governments can organize state militias to fight against the federal government in case the federal government overreaches but people reinterpreted the 2nd amendment so that it meant that anybody can bare arms. People also added an argument back in the 1900s for gun use that if the government were to take guns away from the general public, that would mean that only the police and people that own them through illegal means would have them therefore creating a power imbalance that would uncontested if the police or illegal owners decided to start doing shit of their own accord. 

It's funny that was the argument used yet these people got real quiet when the national guard and police started gunning down protestors who were just exercising their rights granted to them by the bill of rights.
https://twitter.com/LukeSnywalker/status/1280264313823989760?s=19
Man if anymore of these relationships come out in regards to Zack, I'm gonna start getting the ~~hopefully~~ wrong idea that Zack purposefully seeks out Adults to manipulate and blackmail
Also fuck Salem for letting it happen
How in the hell does he keep finding himself in these situations
That's 3 different adults that Zack been getting it on with <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
He knew about Zack's relationship with MattyG too
God fucking damn Salem
If the DNC wanted actual change they would've put Sanders in the runnings but they don't care. They want to maintain the status quo which is why they put Biden in the runnings.
I'll be voting blue but the vote itself doesn't matters if you want actual change. They're both puppets for big business.

Are you saying that because there are no androgynous characters in the show, the question shouldn't be asked or that the topic shouldn't be discussed?
I don't... understand the question?

It's sort of amazing in of itself how I grew up in this anime community that used it so damn liberally. I literally had to have someone spell it out to me that it had negative connotations <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I legitimately didn't know
that's how I felt when I first heard that the word was a slur

I still need to watch the show
The producers are gonna force a s4 and if they fuck up new testament...
Ugh
Was this a producer decision?
Director thinks it's a good idea to fit like 12 volumes of these wordy ass books into a season
~~No I'm still not salty about what happened with index s3~~
Yeah you can more or less ignore index. I think there's one thing railgun s3 doesn't explain cause the continuity is connected with index but outside of that it's fine to watch by itself
The anime for index is something you can watch but the anime is a piss poor adaptation of the books
<@!457268466429329429> If you're going to watch anything from Raildex I specifically recommend watching Railgun exclusively
I was so sure it was a recap
It's a bonus ova bundled with the DS game
It's not required
I'll look it up
That sounds like a recap
.5?
Holding a top spot in pvp is not fun <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I might have to stop playing XDU during that time I'm reading V3 so i can actually focus on it
Why'd you remind me that I still haven't played V3 yet
I'm not really a mecha nut so I wouldn't know much about mecha
Ah
Does GL dumb down things that previous mecha played up?
Tell him to watch SSSS Gridman and see if he actually phases out of mecha <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Ok
Oh
Is he a fan of mecha?
Oh well
Man we got some non believers in here slandering the opening <:YumiPanic:688429717174354012>
Now that's a spicy take
Tho KLK just started off stupid and slowed down
It's a slow burner like its spiritual successor, Kill la Kill
It's been years since I first watched it but I do vaguely remember it taking a bit to take off.
How far have you gotten in it?
I need to give that a rewatch at some point
Oh that's a fun time
GL?
I rewatched that arc recently and forgot just how amazing those 16 episodes were
Don't at me
Railgun sister's arc is the best thing to come out the animated adaptations
You can watch it on your own time
Accelerator is mid
I'm happy that railgun had a way better production than index did since that series always tended to look better
I should watch it at some point
I haven't watched EVA at all
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

I do remember a recap in there somewhere
And I wanted to enjoy that one <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Kinda tight cause I can't remember some details but I do remember the major story beats
I spent so long trying to stay up for PvP in XDU that I read through all the chapters of the Hamefura manga
Dont @ me
So as i was saying, Chloe is the best thing to come out of Fate/Kaleid
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
I had a blast watching it the first time cause so much effort went into this horny ass show just to sell a book
It's nothing you absolutely have to watch, but animation, directing, and choreography nutheads are probably going to love it
Also the soundtrack for this show is surprisingly good
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Reminder that Miru Tights is the most well made horny anime I've seen in a minute
When I hear the voice come out of Maria's mouth I always feel the whiplash but when I imagine her voice while reading the manga I actually struggle to imagine a light cute voice for her cause the deep cute voice feels oddly fitting
I'm on and off
~~I'd take a harem end personally~~
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
~~In hindsight the same reason why I like Catarina are probably why I like Touma from Raildex~~
But again the show doesn't seem to care as much about the romance as it does just focusing on Catarina and her antics in making the lives around her better which I find so cute
It honestly feels like a purposeful parody of characters like Ichika(?) from Infinite Stratos
They took the dense harem protagonist and cranked up to 11
~~I think another part of the reason is that the show knows what it is and purposefully makes fun of itself~~
That first episode was just so good <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
That's probably why I like Villainess so much
I just adore the type of protagonist that goes around making the lives of everyone else around them better
Is the light novel that much better?
Aka one of the most fun light novel isekai adaptations ever
Are we talking about mondaiji tachi?
Sequels always get a better rating
XV having a better rating makes sense
Pretty much the same way I felt about every season past G. For what I watched I always feel it doesn't do enough. Granted I've heard good things about what happens in the final episode between bikki and miku but I still need to watch it. I was never a fan of how the show loved to have its cake and eat it in regards to the yuri.
Is that ecchi anime bordering on hentai still above a 9.0 on mal or did it get review bombed?
There are exceptions to the rule like sequel seasons for example but usually that's the case i find
The scale is just so bloated toward the latter 5 numbers
It's just funny cause a 7 is "good" on like any other scale
It's basically a 5 point scale at that point cause the first 5 numbers on the 10 scale don't exist
I find it funny that, by MAL standards, a 6.9 is "bad"
I was about to say the former until you added that second line. I tend to drop any romance regardless of whether it be hetero or homo if there isn't any drama or conflict worth a damn. I'm definitely a big fan of the heroic yuri in the extremely few times we get to see it <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I'm saying that half jokingly. It's just nice to find somebody with similar priorities <:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Speaking of which, back to reading Kindred Spirits for the thousandth time
I actually found somebody worse than me about prioritizing yuri shows
Wow
~~What do you mean I can't have my cake and eat it?~~
My favorite part about G was when they had Kiri and Jii proclaim their love for each other in a way that could still be framed as platonic <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I usually crash on weekly shows
It might've been airing at the time
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
And for whatever reason I stopped right after watching that episode
From what I remember, it had one of the single best episodes I'd ever seen up to that point in 2015
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Fuck I need to watch Mai-hime and Yuri Kuma Arashi. Why are you guys increasing the size of my to watch list that I'll never get to
At most the only show I can recommend is Mai-hime since I remember that being a good time
My memory of the characters are hella muddy since I haven't seen past season 1 in years
Both of them were girls
I'm pretty sure one character is gay and another is bi
From what I can remember about ikki tousen
Kampfer is doodoo butter from what I remember but I'm still fond of it
That show was pretty wild too
That was Ikki Tousen
No
Oh wait
That show was probably my first introduction to yuri high key
I haven't seen Kampfer in fucking years
Going through this list just struck me with nostalgia
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
All of my favorite stories that have yuri are books
Man
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Just throw them both on there
lmao
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/676733306179420170.png?v=1
Netsuzou TRap receiving a 5.42 on MAL
I guess that one counts
I completely forgot about that one
Oh shit I haven't finished Mai-hime
The closest thing I watched that I would classify as heroic yuri was something I dropped twice <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Uh I take it back
I thought it was just me
I wanted to like that one so fucking bad
Oh is that the reason why I quit watching literally all 4 times I tried to watch/read it
oof
Am I allowed to cheat and say Kindred Spirits since the main protagonist in that goes around solving the issues of other characters in the story? I'm just a big fan of that story.

I'd have to give that one some thought, I swear I've read more heroic yuri stories but I'm drawing a blank atm.
Good question
I'm planning on giving XV a rewatch
I have a reason to watch gegege no kitaro
wow
I'm just now finding out where the fuck that purple haired kitty girl comes from
~~If you don't want to support funimation, sail the high seas and buy merch~~
What a concept
Man
I'm currently entertaining the idea of the moanercycle
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
no
lel
The motorcycle moans as it drives
I always loved that episode where lady and the lady first showcased their moves
I'm going to force myself through it one day for the action
That anime just didn't want to stop
I like it in spades. I prefer subtle sexuality way more.
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
She takes the moe voice and makes it unbearable
I'd watch it if it weren't for how absolutely ear grating the protag's voice is
Honestly
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Episode 4 was still fucking amazing
My dumbass self in 2015 couldn't pick up on much of what the show was telling me at the time
Alternatively I could watch Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid and suffer for a different reason
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/655058014495047690.png?v=1
I'll watch NTR then wash my eyes out with || Boku no Pico ||
I must understand every juicy detail
On a serious note, I'm probably going to watch it just to understand the fuss cause I completely ignored the show while it was making its rounds
Oh boy I get to suffer through 9 mins of cucking instead of 24 <:Ver:704169051391524875>
NTR seems like the type of show that I'd both love and struggle to get through
I'd say it still applies <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
👀
With all the implications that come with the term <:KanadeLewd:690470896174891008>
I did say she turns into a gigolette
ye
Correction: Just searched up some manga on dynasty scans. It's about as good for reading
They have any scans from any scanlators that choose to upload to their site. I haven't read anything on Dynasty Scans so I wouldn't be able to compare.

If you're looking for an official source, you'd probably be hard pressed. I don't think anyone has licensed Yuricam yet.
2/3 is yes
Depends on the ending
Two of the main characters are gay and one of the other girls among the 12 is implied to be bi
The manga is the epidemy of bonkers
Yuricam was manga that I had recommended to me that I had no fucking idea what I was getting myself into. The story focuses on a college girl who's father's company went bankrupt and now has no way of paying tuition to stay in school. So she's forced to become a gigolette and leech of the other students in her school for money. Thing is, it's an all girls school.
Steam like HotW and Highway Blossoms
Fatal Twelve focuses on a group of twelve people bond by fate due to dying at exactly the same time and they are each thrown into a survival game where the winner gets to change their fate and continue living a normal life. What I particularly love about the story (aside from the yuri) is legit just the interactions between those 12 and how they each learn and grow from interacting with each other. It becomes a really wholesome story which was the complete opposite of what I was expecting.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Fatal Twelve is a VN by aeiouKompany and a story I adore that literally no one knows about
Oh shit forgot to mention that one
<@!160142617940590594> Fatal Twelve, Kindred Spirits on the Roof, Highway Blossoms, Yuricam
When I find out
And it shocks me every single time
Every single time I always forget she voices Plutia in Neptunia
Oh shit
Her voice is always nice on the ears
Man I need to hear her sing <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Did she ever appear in Symphogear?
Speaking of
Just like Kana Hanazawa
Yuka Iguchi is everywhere
sakura trick
Oh wow she voices Yuu as well
Any Akiyuki Shinbo show is a guaranteed watch from me
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>
My favorite perspective fail is the one where the skirts are barely covering anything when you look from the front yet they cover the whole booty from the back <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
That perspective makes no sense and I love it
I've seen fan art of this girl around multiple times
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
~~I forgot to read the last few chapters of yuricam when they finally got translated~~
Pretty sure Digibro did an entire video on his history so I'll just refer to that
Need to recall the name <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I'll probably watch it at some point
I'm aware of that one
Shinbo binge tends to turn into "Shaft" binge in hindsight
Time to dig into this myself
I just noticed that it's basically a wiki <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Myanimelist does made the distinction between episode director and director so I'm surprised they didn't make the distinction there
I notice that he's a chief director for plenty of shows after madoka but he's still listed as a director for some shows like 3-gatsu no lion
I'll have to keep an eye on that then
Oh wait seriously?
i think
There are like 4 seasons of that
I completely forgot about Hidamari Sketch
Man this Akiyuki Shinbo binge is gonna be busy as fuck
Damn straight
I want to watch that one but the general set up is something I've seen multiple times at this point so I'm in no hurry to watch it
Pani Poni Dash has officially made me a fan of subtle fanservice
High key this dude mellowed out on his later works
Holy fuck
Pani Poni Dash is the most Akiyuki Shinbo fever dream I've ever had the pleasure of watching
Ugh
Out of curiosity, what trends did Shaft set that were bad for the industry?
That mass exodus was huge last year
Ah that makes sense
wtf
A1 and J.C. just tend to get a lot of shows iirc
I'm...kinda interested in what trends they set
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Good ol' A1 giving the anime industry the bread and butter anime face
Nux is...an interesting brand
> bit back to shaft, i don't really like them :15min:
You dislike Shaft? Or am I reading that wrong?
Can't really say I dislike him since he's the one that introduced me to anitubers, but after watching his videos for years, his brand got stale.
Gigguk is just broken clock at this point
Man
~~Fucking Mother's Basement~~
I don't really listen to Digibro much anymore, but he definitely seemed invested in Shinbo's history
I find him and AnimeAjay to be gotos
iirc Digibro mentioned that he was like Shinbo's understudy while he was still working at Shaft
Shin Onuma is such a weird director, he's like Shinbo if he reserved the creativeness/wackyness for key moments rather than putting it in everywhere.
I kinda want to watch Shin Onuma's works as a bonus cause I liked his work on Baka to Test and Ef
Oh nice
All these black bars <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Aren't they all adaptations of the songs?
The distinctions you mentioned just now sound interesting so I'll have fun comparing the anime to what I read of the light novel <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I haven't watched the anime in years so I'm willing to say my memory may be fucked in that regard
geez
FIne I'll watch the anime again
I'm pretty confident the anime started off like that
I'm just going off of what I read and watched where they both started off with the neet boy going to the department store for a new keyboard and got caught up in some nonsense.
Ok so I'm guessing that anime and LN just started the same way and their similarities end there
They follow the same plot don't they?
The first novel was a fun read from what I can remember
Oh right I should probably watch Mekakucity Actors too since it's on the catalogue by extension of being something that Shaft shit out. I'm probably going to hold off on that one cause I want to read the light novels
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Next we're going to start calling Super Mario Galaxy a retro game
Calling something from the 2000s dated
Man
Dichotomy of the fist
The manga was probably better i hear
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
The most mid mahou shoujo I've ever had the pleasure of watching
~~Magical girl Spec-ops Asuka~~
If we all forgot about it then there was probably a reason https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/655058014495047690.png?v=1
I can't remember a single thing from that show other than a cool opening and the burning hair of the magical girls
Daybreak Illusion
I just found one of the edgier post madoka mahou shoujos that I watched
~~Burn Kira with fucking fire~~
The more you know <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
*Neptunia counts as mahou shoujo*
<@!278860841485598720> When I was thinking of Revolutionary Girl Utena what came to mind was Cardcaptor Sakura <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I keep forgetting to watch that one
Bikki got a direct upgrade in G so it was a fair trade off I guess
I always found the simplicity of the designs in S1 oddly appealing. Tsubasa in particular I always felt looked the best in the simpler design.
Of course I didn't watch the TV version so that could be a contributing factor
At least on my first watch
I'd have to rewatch S1 cause nothing quite looked off to me
Are we calling it dated in the sense that it has aged poorly or that it's literally old?
Oh good, I thought I was losing it. That's some news to just up and miss for months
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Did a second movie get announced for Fate Kalied?
In the FUCK
When
On a substantially unrelated note
<:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
~~What the fuck did this show do to me~~
Symphogear's themes are so cute, it makes me want to keep writing stories using similar themes <:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
That's the reason why I felt she needed to be dropped earlier. Fuck it could've been fine if she dropped in episode 8 like how it was originally but they thought it was ok to incapacitate her and continue focusing on NR
^
I'm gonna give XV 13 another watch. Cause what I was typing out just now sounded like a reworked Fine
Cause she has a set of ideals
Shem-ha wouldn't be a force of nature character
Wait so uh
> >Adam ranked above Shem-Ha/Fine
> 
> by what metric
<@!155150213445582850> From being exactly what that season needed. Similar to Ver with team neopolitan, he acts as the negative counterpart to Bikki in terms of influence on Germain and her ideals which creates a sort of power struggle. Admittidly tho, a large reason for why I like him a lot is just the big dick energy he has going on everytime he's on screen. I'll always fuck with a character like that (i.e. anything Gilgamesh from Fate).

I'd like Fine and Shem-ha more if they just clashed with bikki more. On that note, I forgot to put SG above Fine/Shem-ha ~~whoops~~
A force of nature character with ideals that clash better with bikki deserved far more time on screen that those other would be antagonists
<:Germain:421434126856486912>
Basically more of what we got with Germain
Shem-ha and Fine both suffer from last episode interaction problem. They never actually interact with the protags too much until the end and both would've benefit heavily from butting heads with bikki more
If we're talking character, it's probably going to be Adam then after that Shem-ha/Fine
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
~~But it gave us the best villain design~~
That season is fascinating for all the wrong reasons
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/655058014495047690.png?v=1
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Someone who doesn't believe in the church of G
A heretic
Ooo~
Imma take a shot in the dark and guess that it was Tutu
Utena doesn't count as a mahou shoujo apparently
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I don't even remember Kiri's
It was the most GX character arc out of all the arcs in AXZ
Shirabe got that one arc that felt...arbitrary? I don't know how to describe it
I forgot about those 2
Oh fuck
They learned there lesson after GX for trying to develop every character and only focused on Maria, Bikki, and Chris in AXZ, but Maria got hijacked by the cockroach in an arc which technically shouldn't be necessary for her already and Chris' arc was...weird. Bikki was back in her element after GX so she got the best deal out of the 3
Part of the reason why forcing 6 characters into a story at all times and trying to develop each and everyone of them is a bad idea
I'd...argue that team neopolitan, particularly Maria, were at there most interesting in G and then proceeded to just flat line cause Kaneko couldn't think of anything substantial to them.
~~And stroganoff~~
~~Genocide carries the entire soundtrack~~
The blasphemy
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/676733306179420170.png?v=1
can't remember
Or maybe it was after
Maria's speech right b4 she and bikki both got naked in front of the whole world
ye
~~Nuke mountains with ease~~
I will hold to it that the daddy issues in that season had a logical throughline that Kaneko just stubbed his toe on somewhere in the writing process. That beginning with Hibiki still didn't need to happen tho
Lots of good in the action department and lots of potentially good ideas in the story department with piss poor execution
GX was a bonkers season
That would hurt me cause XV's 13th episode alone was more enjoyable than all of what I remember of GX
The more I talk about XV, the further down the season tier list it goes. I wish I were exaggerating on whether or not it deserves 3rd place atm.

I'm going to rewatch all the seasons eventually and I'm praying that I never find a reason to rank GX over XV
^
Eventually I'm either going to start hating or loving them cause of how much I bring them up <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968> I'm kinda tired of ranting about my raw apathy toward NR at this point <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>

<:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>

> I don't like subtext or slice of life or CGDCT and thus my life is suffering
<@!160142617940590594> Imagine having gay text in muh animes
Imagine being brainwashed
I just imagined the scenario just now where bikki was a male and immediately assumed they were a couple but didn't make that assumption in S1 when I first saw them. lel
media really fucked me up
Man
*Dense shounen protag intensifies*
I would say it was obvious even in S1
oof
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I hate it when english can't properly translate japanese
Does it have something to do with the kanji?
A lot of what bikki says can and will be interpreted as platonic
I can see an argument for why Bikki doesn't have feeling for Miku tbh
Be more open to discussion
Damn
I'm interested
Yo FireZero are you arguing that Miku and Bikki don't have feelings for each other?
lel
Damn I haven't read half of this convo
It's also not uncommon for that type of character to not be aware of their feelings
To add to that
It's not uncommon for that type of character to go all out for someone they consider their friend, but on the other hand the shit both miku and bikki do together is very gay.
Hibiki's character trope tends to be dense
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
I went into the game's files to get the music
Already did
I didn't even watch SAO and im having a blast
SWE is once again reminding me why SAO Abridged is the best thing since sliced bread
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
It had the soundtrack which I would kill for
Man I'm sad I didn't get the limited edition for the switch
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Rivaled only by VA-11 Hall-A
That read was one the best experiences I've ever had reading any story
I'm planning on giving it a reread atm
Kinda forgot to recommend it the other day
<@!160142617940590594> SeaBed is a yuri VN btw
Which are both conveniently on the switch
I've got a serious craving to read SeaBed and VA-11 Hall-A rn
They just disappear <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I was over here wondering where the commands went after you used them
Ah
Yeah i was wondering why you made me look at your acc earlier <:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
I need to learn how to fucking read
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
~~You never know what gender people are online until you fuck up~~
Should probably just use they
Need more open yuris in my life
~~She's starved for yuri~~
Yeah that's the one
~~cuck central~~
It's tends to be purposefully written that way to extend the "will they? won't they?" bs a lot of shows have
No character bothers to think about their feelings
That's more so a general writing thing i notice in anime
Never friends
I'm talking about sleeping in bed together and all the stuff. That's usually either romance or platonic sibling stuff
Well
Media in general doesn't like putting boys and girls in the situations bikki and miku are in outside of romance.
Mai-hime too
That seems more like something Aniplex or Sentai would pick up
When in the hell did Funi get Yurikuma Arashi
~~Good ol' Funimation~~
Still wouldn't get me to buy it cause Funi but that's still tempting
Oh Funimation released a SAVE edition for that?
sanitized?
~~Can you tell that I haven't watched or read 2wei in fucking forever~~
Oh right that
What was the birthday stuff again?
That last chunk of 2wei feels like it should've been a set of OVAs rather than a full season
||~~2wei's ending was still pretty magical girl esque tho~~||
3rei feels like the epidemy of that
A part of that comes with the creator dialing down on the magical girl angle and just making what's basically another fate story
Might just watch it as a standalone
But damn I lose interest every time in S1's manga <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
I want to read the manga up to the point where it's relevant
I still haven't watched the movie yet
A good chunk of that season wasn't even in the manga iirc
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Gotta extend the runtime of the episodes somehow turn what was left of the 2wei manga into a full season
2wei herz sure loved its kiss scenes
Anyone new should go read the manga, but if you don't care about what this anime throws at you and/or don't mind the anime cutting out content from the manga then you can watch it just fine
And he's such a weird director
I care about prillya's anime cause Shin Onuma is directing it
Think it was like episode 5 or 6
S1
I'm tempted to watch the show again exclusively for the ||Alter Saber vs (Chloe)Illya fight||
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
They anime went pretty nuts with yuri between the characters starting with Chloe's introduction
https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/655058014495047690.png?v=1
~~Yeah I happened to catch a glimpse of how bad the production values got at times in 3rei~~
I actually haven't watched 3rei yet, what happens in the anime that causes the issue?
Of course if you don't mind ||extensive kiss scenes between underage girls|| and cut content then you can watch the anime <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
yes
Didn't the movie become more rushed toward the end?
I was surprised to find that the fight was only like a couple of panels in the manga
I think the best thing he did for that season was expanding the fight between ||Alter Saber and Illya||
~~Shin Onuma is a weird director~~
The first season was dumb <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I feel like I saw a trailer around for that last year or something
Wasn't Neptunia supposed to get an OVA?
Speaking of a dead series
Oh right
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
~~I feel like this dived out of anime talk somewhere~~
No it was closer to Disgaea's battle system
So I can manage the framerate
Neptunia's first game is actually a 8/10 by comparison
I played through mugen souls
Then again
It was mainly framerate issues. The game is surprisingly choppy for what basically feels like a PS2 game  <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829> Textures I can get used to and the kind of unwieldy battle system is something I did adapt to the first time so I shouldn't have any issues there.
I remember liking it enough when I first played it like 7 yrs ago but I tried to boot it up again recently and immediately remembered why I struggled to play it the first time
It's like a 90 degree incline with no way to scale it
Is just such a wall
The game itself
I want to go back and play the first game for the story but
~~On the fence as to whether or not I want to say the story in that game is better than the first one~~
Neptunia kind of peaked as a game series in VII so I can be happy with that game until the next mainline game comes
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Sadism
Ah right
I liked HaneKana playing her in hindsight but she was really just another cute face in the pool of 2d waifus in that series to me <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Wait a lot of people are Plutia stans?
<@181591926636544002> is Neptunia even that big anymore? It feels like that series fell off the face the map after VII (at least in the west)
I have a hard time comparing it to anything <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Monogatari is just this weird singularity
It was a fun story
I forget when
I read HotW either after or b4
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
There were like 2 VNs I read inbetween Fatal Twelve and SeaBed and none of them landed because everything just didn't compare
I feel you on that
Lank
Never got me to actually watch the rest of part 1 tho
It was a fun time
I watched to alongside my dorm mates and they were just having fun rewatching part 1
Can't remember his name
Speedwagon?
I watched up to the point where Dio was supposedly killed. I think that's right around the time the new guy got introduced
~~Unless, of course, the only reason you watch Jojo is for the wacky setting~~
I'm just playing devil's advocate
I've only looked at part 1
To add to what Iskierka is saying, if the setting of part 6 is what killed part 6 for you then that kind of says a lot about the characters and story writing since that wasn't worth noting for you.
Wow I've never seen somebody have such animosity for a show <:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
They're listed as yuri on most sites
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
The studio is generally inspired by his style
Right
Other half is Nisioisin being an insane writer
Half of what's going on in the show is Akiyuki Shinbo being an insane director
She's just really athletic iirc
The show is something I want to watch after the books
I have the entire boxset and it's just been collecting dust for a year
Speaking of monogatari, I seriously need to read season 1
You can get away with just jumping to Nise tbh
I feel like monogatari doesn't quite hit the insanity of jojo
It reminds me of the phone game joke during AXZ's Zesshoushinai specials where YTT did something really funny with the subs
Lank I love subs that play around like that
I distinctly remember that dog thing from what little I remember of the show
Oh shit that?
Old subs are top tier
Though I feel like I should remember that
It's been like 2 years and I never finished
I can't remember anything from that show tbh
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
OK good, I thought my memory was failing me for hime
Is that specific to otome or is it a thing in general for the mai-series?
Wow I haven't watched this shit in forever
So clearly it's there but it's probably not the main romance like what Shinku is saying
Obligatory het strikes again <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829> 

I've seen two different sites list the mai-series under yuri
Lel
Aside from DB I guess
Literally the only Funi dub that matters
~~The only exception to the rule is Panty and Stocking cause that dub is amazing~~
I would buy it and still download the torrents <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Might need that
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I respect your grind
I had fun hearing other people fangasm over it when it blew up but I've never sat down to watch it myself
Haven't watched AoT yet
And now I'm off to go play best Neptunia game <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
The Neptunia talk here made me want to revisit VII
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/614634658499526671/627633608445919245/image0.gif
Just found out that Highway Blossoms is getting dlc <@!160142617940590594>
That particular artist is almost making me convert to the church of Jii
If you enjoy despair for the sake of despair then mahou shoujo site is your type of show
~~I mean listening to the show while doing something else is exactly what I mean~~
HidaSketch is a shaft show which is just going to keep my interest regardless
That's one of Digi's takes that I whole heartedly agree with
> And monotone media just doesn't do that
SoL CGDCT would be amazing if I could casually listen to the show like American sitcoms rather than sitdown and actually pay attention to the subtitles cause I don't understand JP
~~Slow Start is actually one of the ones I dropped~~
~~Looking at you Machikado Mazoku and Comic Girls~~
Admittedly the ones that did keep my interest did end up being one of my more favorite shows
CGDCT is one of those genres that just inherently doesn't interest me. I've probably dropped a lot CGDCT shows due to just losing interest
I can see what you're saying Akeu, but the second a piece of media enters the Animation landscape, any criticisms toward the animation are valid critiques
To be fair, if I watch a show that legit looks terrible why should I watch it over the product it's adapting?
People only shat on S2 for not having the consistently amazing animation of S1
I'm pretty sure a lot of people liked the story S2 adapted better than S1
I found that Saitama being completely unsatisfied and depressed despite achieving exactly what he wanted to be the most interesting part of the show.
Just to clarify
Btw what was the joke in OPM?
OPM was a fun ride, I did find Mob Psycho to just be better in every way personally
oof
> I watched OPM and thought "if this is considered good Shounen I don't want to see what bad shounen is like"
That implies that OPM isn't good shounen <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Subtlety in yuri needs to die in a fire
Now I will add that I found Bikki to be at her most entertaining when she's actually changing lives of the people around her for the better which is why I find to be at her best in S1, G, and AXZ
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
~~Then peaked again in AXZ but I'm ignoring that season~~
Say what you want about Basa or Chris, Bikki peaked in G
Wait *everyone's* character arc?
~~If you want a memey villain then Adam just beats Ver by a mile~~
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
The first episode's concert scene made me want to watch the rest of the season
~~I found the animation in S1 to be pretty good tho~~
I used to have time until XDU entered my life <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
~~Yeah Kindred Spirits is the ultimate yuri story~~
Would it be better to say subtext then?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Like it was flying through the story beats way faster than the LN did
I always found the Date A Live anime to have really weird pacing

Bro just buy the blu rays and torrent
Oh and even ignoring what I said earlier.
 
> Toaru S1 is S1. There's supposed to be a beginning/middle/end for the characters.

This line of thought doesn't work on characters like Touma who are designed to be static. Even if DB(Z) were adapted in a seasonal format, you wouldn't see this development on Goku because he's a static character post 21st tenkaichi.

The 3 act structure is more for story arcs rather than seasons anyway
From there on he was more or less static for the purposes of the story
I technically lied on Goku's character since he does see a significant change to his character in the first tournament arc with Jackie Chun but everything else that happened to his character wasn't a fundamental change.
I happen to like Touma's character in general but it's a perfectly fair criticism to say that you don't like a character from what is presented.
I don't...quite get what you're saying here? I get that his arc isn't over until DBZ is over. That's how his type of character arc is designed to be written similar to Touma's.
Railgun is too good <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
What I will concede to is that Touma is far less interesting a character in Index than he is in the novels and, hell, even the Railgun anime.
> Not developing the main character for two season, I'd argue three isn't good writing. It's not just a stylistic choice, it shows a lack of knowledge of how to write characters
<@278860841485598720> Can't say I agree with this take. That's like looking at Goku and saying that he isn't a good protagonist because he doesn't fundamentally develop as a character when he's supposed to be a static character.
Other way around
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Nana stay voicing every character in every show like HaneKana
Ah that explains why I like the opening then
Wait who did Nana voice?
~~Reminder to read and not watch Rosario + Vampire please. The anime is fucking trash~~
Index is the hot topic
Nah Railgun is amazing
Then again I did that with Rosario + Vampire and that manga was fucking amazing
Wow that's the complete opposite of what I'd do lmao
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
My favorite part of Railgun is how the ||festival arc happens the day after the Index Festival arc happens and it's this catastrophic event that no one in Index ever brings up because retroactive writing||
The LN is good, the anime is mid.
~~Shout-outs to the brilliantly done shit fest that is monogatari~~
A lot of that only got across in the novels where Touma's entire dilemma is ||trying to play hero the same way his past self supposedly did while keeping his memory destruction a secret from everyone else. He feels the need to constantly compare himself to his past self in every action he does|| which i find interesting. Unfortunately a lot of that is monologue which the anime can't adapt w/o screeching to a halt.
Just cause a character has no memories doesn't mean they shouldn't be interesting
While I'm at it, I don't find that to be a valid argument
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
You inspired it
It's not like we have a cartoon channel so shoot
You'd be hard pressed to make me think she's better than Touma and Accelerator but I guess I just have to read it <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I've heard people tell me she's arguably the best protag in the series and that makes me really interested in reading it
There we go
I've been hearing good things about her subordinate from the spin off of Railgun
That anime just had better writing and is more true to the index novels than Index's anime is.
I find Touma to also be a more interesting character in Railgun
You want to know what's funny
That's mainly what I'm confused by. They called Index's storytelling non linear which lost me.
I'm a bit lost on that
When you get back, can you define non-linear storytelling?
If you're asking who's the more interesting character in their animes I'd say Mikoto cause she's is a ball of fun in her anime
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Both Touma and Mikoto are written as static characters in their respective anime so that's a trick question Zaia
The Railgun anime slaps the index anime on its worst days
Yes in terms of anime
What are everyone's takes on Accelerator's spin off <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

Oh shit
Really?
Wait
I don't remember S3 being announced anywhere back in 2014. I was following the Toaru's 10 year anniversary and I can't recall anything but HO being announced on the last day of announcements. I recall Miki apologizing for not announcing S3 of Index but I can't recall anything else in regards to that season.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I thought S3's problem was the shitty production which made it so that everything was super rushed
That sounds weird, don't all anime receive more or less the same budget?
The pre-production and production was garbage
S3 was the shit fest with good reason
Index's first season actually had pretty good animation for the most part
I don't think they care enough about the distinction either
Yuri-hime is weird
Oh fuck read that wrong <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I'm not sure how MAL does it but Mai-Hime should be shoujo ai
Shoujo Ai is generally more innocent and cute. There usually isn't much things like sex in it which is what yuri has.
Yes
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I should buy the first volume of NTR to see how I feel about it
Yeah
I never really make the distinction between yuri and shoujo ai anymore
Kindred Spirits would be yuri cause sex
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Then again Sakura Trick would have to be on there since there's only like 20 yuri anime
Look at Sakura Trick being the poster child of yuri on MAL despite being boring as hell
<:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>

I said earlier that the static character arc is meant to influence to world around them. They're meant to go on forever if you can keep coming up with stories for them. No one actually does, yes, because you eventually run out of ideas or get bored of writing your story but being able to write forever is part of the design.
Not necessarily Carols. The static character arc is designed to go on forever as long as you can keep coming up with stories for them. The positive and negative character arcs are the ones that have a clear beginning, middle, and end.
Like I said earlier, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a story that plays the static character arc completely straight outside of villains like Freeza (who inevitably developed anyway in Super <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187> ) Eventually you'll create a scenario in which the character's truth is entirely challenged in a way that they'll have to change.
I fine with that as long as other characters are actually developing (looking at you DBS...~~backtracking on character development for absolutely no reason~~)

But really nothing in writing is set in stone. Anything can be good or shit in the right hands. I just find static character arcs fascinating personally.
Refer to my last message to answer that question. The static character arc is a writing tool that enables change in other characters. That doesn't mean that they have to stay assigned to the role. They only mostly do.
I don't think that there are a lot of stories that play the static character arc entirely straight anyway. Even Goku developed pretty early in the story.
Once the character's ideals start getting questioned is when they transition out of a static character arc temporarily and more toward the positive character arc.
How universally applicable is their truth?
How right is your protag?
That's a fun thing you can work with tho
So your problem with the concept is that it's unrealistic?
I feel like I digressed somewhere but back to the main point. The protag doesn't need to develop in every story. You can also write a story where a protag can get other characters to develop.
The thing about static main characters is that they, more than any other character arc, need characters around them to actually influence. So if you don't like those characters or if the main character doesn't do a good enough job in influencing, the main character will just fall flat.
The static character arc is one of my favorite arcs in general cause it's such a fun writing tool. Put a character who has a "truth" of the world around a bunch of characters that believe or embrace themselves in some sort of "lie" and that character will influence all the characters around them to kickstart their character arcs.
Not necessarily. The entire point of the static character arc is that the character itself doesn't change, but rather that they influence the world around them to change. For the better or worse.
*only?*
Are there any static characters you do like out of curiosity?
The one about the people who love gambling?
That just outright implies that DB doesn't have a story
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Now that's a spicy take
Oh man Cocoa
~~I can't recall a shounen that was just nothing but fights~~
DB would not be popular if it was just about the punchy punchy beam shooty fights
The fights wouldn't mean anything if there weren't a good story around it
That's fair
Which I will give you for the anime
> Yes, but playing it straight for three seasons as is the case with Touma is already far, far too long
For the record, if you feel this way about it, that just means the writing wasn't good enough <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
DB was the better time I'd say
lel
I don't see nearly as many people defending DBS either
*Something something writing 4 different antagonist for the heroes cause the editor said so*
DBZ kind of lost itself story wise post Namek saga
~~Implying that DB doesn't have a good story for the most part~~
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
In fact he was so good that they had to bring his ass back 3 separate times
It's almost like the goal of that arc was to beat the big bad. The Buu arc in general didn't have compelling writing anyway past Vegeta's sacrifice. As far as Villains go I like Freeza the best for being this absolute tyrant with a connection to Goku and the saiyans both thematically and on a meta level.
I said he's a force of nature
I like Kid Buu and he's effective as a force of nature
I can't fantasize being Naruto personally
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Gohan came back in DB and said he didn't want to be wished back to life
Answered
But you're really only able to say that in retrospect. The Z Fighters dying to Vegeta and Nappa at the time was catastrophic b4 we found out that they had another set of reset buttons on a different planet
Lank I get what you're saying
> rhey specifically want to watch goku fight
There's usually a *because* here and I wouldn't say it's just cause they like Goku. Perhaps there's a thematic reason? There's a reason I want to see Goku deck Freeza in the schnoz and it's to get catharsis for all the terror Freeza put the Z Fighters through as well as all the Namekians and Saiyans and avenging Vegeta who just died. ~~(Also cause a positive static character arc and negative static character arc clashing just sounds like fun)~~
There are story reasons for why people watch these fights. Even if they're simple in nature, yall are acting like they don't exist.
I haven't watched Kakegurui but it has to have *something* to keep people invested. A story with all fights and no story is going to bore people.
Ultra Instinct in theory is something I like but the story did nothing to actually lead into it from a character perspective similar to SS. Goku just got it initially from being bonked with a Spirit Bomb.
Wow I guess he didn't train and push his own limits to achieve said transformations <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Well I think that was the message anyway. I'm long overdue for a dragon ball reread
That there is always going to be somebody better than you so you should always be fighting to push your own limits.
The message Master Roshi wanted to instill in him
He was fundamentally wrong about one thing and that's what his initial character arc was b4 he went static
Hell Goku too
Which invalidates Naruto on principle
Blank slates also never want to ever be wrong
There ideals are a bit too different from me. And if they have ideals and goals they genuinely want to work towards I can't consider them blank slates
That's Snafu S2 and Flip Flappers for me <:Ver:704169051391524875>
You ever watch a show and not get it on the first watch
Snafu S2 was 2deep4me
Just from the shows I have seen on that list I can already see why you're not a fan static characters taking a protag role. All have really good protags with that genuinely develop alongside their side characters. Love me some monogatari.
Oh nice. 2 of those are on my shaft/shinbo binge
<@!278860841485598720> Can you recommend me any of those drama shows you mentioned earlier? I want to see where your coming from a bit better.
Oh by the way
In particular that the static character arc can potentially be boring depending on how it's used
I learned a lot of good things from this one

I'd like to see more of those
Those type of platformers are still pretty dead atm
Oh that'd be cool.
I'm having trouble thinking of games I can attach to the labels of action and adventure. The first one I can think off is The Last of Us but I'm not sure if that fits?
That genre is kind of broad
Wait, by action adventure, what type of game are you looking for?
That's partially why I said RPG. But I would like to see an action RPG akin to Kingdom Hearts <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Can still be just as story intensive
Like an RPG or something
Well specifically for *audiobooks* 
I'm not sure how you'd do it for readers reading at their own pace without making a visual novel out of it to fix the issue
Just do what games do and have the music play on repeat for the entire duration of the scene
I wonder if there are audiobooks that do what you're talking about

The only thing I remember about the Fate/Stay Night VN is that the sex scenes were long, dumb, and un-arousing in every way
*Waifu collector machine go brrrrrr*
Reading it did make watching Fate/Kaleid more fun though cause I got a good chunk of the references to F/SN
Honestly can't remember
Or maybe it was 6?
Oh I know. It's just that the sex scenes being the way that they are is the only thing I can vividly remember about my experience reading F/SN 8 years ago
Eh, not a fan of fucking up people that don't deserve the abuse
That entire trope is dookey

I can't say the same for his doujinshi
I surf through his twitter all the time
His art is perfectly fine
Damn that surprises me just as much as seeing Uo Denim do LN art
Asanagi doing what? <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

Oh fuck...I just read up on character arcs in stories for a bit. I got to the static character arc explanation and realized that I fundamentally misunderstood what the arc even entails.

I never got to see what the differences between the Angel Fall arc in the anime and LNs were
I'll start over and actually read OT3 and 4 this time
Yeah I think I tried reading NT12 a while back and I felt like I forgot a lot of stuff
Oh well I won't be there for another few months. 19 volumes is a hefty read.
Now I need to watch the anime whenever I get there in the books
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
The most i remember is the "fight" between ||Aiwass and Accelerator|| and like nothing else
That's the one OT arc I can't remember at all
Oh yeah you mentioned Dragon earlier
I need to read
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I was always interested in the new protsg
NT14-16 is the Kamisato arc right?
I'm going to have to get a refresher on everything that happened up to NT10 again. Oh well, that gives me a chance to see what's different between YP's and JS06's translations of the volumes
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Kazuman actually wrote something that tops NT9?
Then NT10 came out and I was fresh off the heels of NT9
Man I miss that entire 3 month span where I marathoned OT and NT back in 2013-2014
Misaki <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
I saw it
I still haven't read past NT11 <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
The borking was understandable considering the production <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Then again i haven't read OT in years but still
I read the LNs and I still had no idea what was going on in S3 <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

Most harems now aren't "harems." They're pick-your-waifu simulators. I'm more so looking for a polygamy type love story with actually good dynamics and relationships between everyone in the harem
Personally, I'd like to see more harems which have a harem end with healthy relationships between everyone in the harem. Where I can legitimately see everyone coexisting with each other. Kind of like Sekirei since the dynamic between everyone in that show was cuter than most harems I see now
And if you really want to have a harem in the story, switch it up and throw multiple different harems in like what Raildex did with it's multiple protagonists (plus that one dude of apparently isn't one)
I had to look it up twice last year cause I couldn't remember the name for the life of me
Yeah I constantly forget about it too
Hibimiku would probably be happy with that type of story
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
That creates competition for our self insert cardboard cutout
We can't have more than one dude in the story
But Fantasy
I like ecchi when they go all out in a ridiculous way like Seikon no Quaser or Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid
Fanservicey action LN adaptations keep getting produced cause producers know what sells. Bonus if it's a harem.
~~Looking at too many lowest common denominator light novel adaptations~~
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
The translation is shit
Not cause the story is bad or anything
Tachibanakan Triangle is hard to read
~~Unless it's subtext bordering on text like Symphogear~~ 

Or your Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid where what draws people in is the ecchi <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
You never find yuri crossed with action
Yuri harems are rare enough as is
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I want a fucking action yuri harem
*Quintessential Quintuplets* I think was the name
I've heard good things about that one show with the five twins
> I'm more so looking for a polygamy type love story with actually good dynamics and relationships between everyone in the harem

It saddens me that the closest I've gotten to this in the shows I've watched is Sekirei
But I do remember her getting fucked in more than just the romance
I've grown numb to close friends/childhood friends getting cucked by new girls
I'd never think to associate Sakurasou with depression
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Sounds pretty on par for anything anime Touma
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
So it'd be best if it were adapted in an ova or something
That one had stories from all over the timeline iirc
I can't remember. I only really remember the fight between ||Gunha and Ollerus||
Figured
Did they adapt the SS2 novel?
I guess
It was nice to see ||Leivinia Birdway|| in animation tho
I forgot they dropped that at the end of S3
Oh eww
Give bakarina the harem end <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
The manga didn't even get around to adapting it yet
Wow
There's enough material in the LN for a second season of Hamefura? <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I can only remember her being there for Touma. Can't recall what else she did <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I'm just not a fan of what they did to the fight. Was filled to the brim with nonsensical bs on T's side whereas in the novels there was a legit strategy that went into ||Touma fighting Accelerator with black wings. To give you an idea of what the anime changed, Touma should not be capable of rejecting Accelerator's wings||

Can't remember if they changed the meaning of the fight in the anime. Haven't read the novels in a minute.
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

Last episode of what?
I'm looking forward to seeing Kamachi actually write those 100+ volumes worth of manuscripts he has planned
NT9 especially
Idk what I'll do if they screw up in adapting NT8-10
Ah
KnT?
Sounds familiar but I can't remember which arc that was
Well both of them anyway
My memory of her is vague but I did like her in that arc
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I'm looking forward to seeing Baggage City and Othinus arc getting fucked over <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Accelerator never frustrated me so it's better than Index III on principle
Regardless the show was pretty mid
I probably have read far enough into NT to the point where that's relevant then
I can't remember it at all
I probably just didn't leave an impression
Did they mention any NT stuff that made its way into Accel?
It was just there
And honestly Accelerator is probably the most boring thing Kamachi's wrote. It never really ever got good or bad for me.
As in the Bible or the novels? Cause I can't recall any thing from Index's NT in the anime.
How'd you feel about it?
Kamachi loves his underdog stories
Lmaoooo
I haven't read his other works
But I digress, Heavy Object was a very Kamachi work from what I read so I can't see myself not enjoying it
I need his and Kamachi's work ethic
The fucking madman
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
It was a fun time
I think I've read the first chapter of HO b4 someone really started translating it
I'll take any type of yuri as long as it's not pointless fluff like Sakura Trick. But yeah I've got a craving for that atm.
~~I need to make a note to myself to read Akuma no Riddle since I keep forgetting to until you remind me~~
The squeaky anime girl voice is never fun to listen to but they crank it up to 11 with her
I'll eventually watch all of valkyrie drive. Just need to keep my ears from bleeding everytime I hear the virgin girl's voice.
Have your cake and eat it too
That's certainly a list
That reminds me
Oh fuck
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
*please share*
Wow that one was faster than NT10 which took a pretty short amount of time iirc
I'm convinced he's Kamachi in disguise <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
God bless the legend that is JS06
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
I believe he mentioned at some point that he had enough ideas for index to easily go up to 100 volumes.
Ah
The damn madman
I think I've seen some melee commentators stan that show
Like how I watch Yu-Gi-Oh having no clue how the game itself works
If there was yuri in this action show I would've told you
Haven't watched any Trigger show aside from KLK and I thought that was a fun time. I've heard good things about LWA.
And oh boy did everybody lose their shit halfway
Got to see everybody's reactions to it while it was airing
That's a show I should eventually watch
Can't be showing progressive stuff to the viewers. They need to stay conservative in their views <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
~~Why did the Tsundere trope become more about the girl warming up to the guy as oppose to the guy changing for the better to melt the girl's heart and potentially change her for the better~~
The unfortunate result of looking at a trope and saying, "hey I can do that too" without thinking about why it's used in a work
That's when a trope becomes a cliche
So is it bad because it's predictable or is it bad because it failed in its execution of what it wanted to do?

I find that a piece of media, even if I can predict what it's going to do, is fine as long as it does that something really well.

> with an all star seiyuu cast and.....hmm who would be a good choice for chara designer for girls for such a questionable series lol
<@!143254211918823424> Akio Watanabe <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
> dense + ecchi equals insufferable harem lead
So the lead of literally every lowest common denominator harem that's been released so far <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I feel like making it ecchi would destroy some of the charm
Bakarina works because its so wholesome and cute
Touma isn't a bad as Rito about it. He just tends to find himself in precarious situations more often then other protags.
Sounds like a car crash I'd watch
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Now I've got an idea in my head of the bad luck being something more akin to Yuuki Rito's or Kamijou Touma's brand of "bad luck" except the MC is a girl in a CGDCT show
Ganbare Shamiko
<:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
That'd be a fun LN title
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

Wow they still produce shit

I'm gonna have to drop this game if I can't find a way to macro everything and anything <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Another show to add to my eventually list which keeps getting longer cause XDU eats my time
Or at least has a similar creative team
I see that Google put Yurikuma Arashi in the related tab for that show so I'm assuming it's similar
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
That was a trip and is probably one of my favorite individual episodes out of any show I've watched.
Think it was episode 4
I never finished that show but I'll never forget the episode that went into the orange bear's backstory
Didn't we just get one of those <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
~~Eventually~~
Speaking of wholesome harems, I need to watch Sekirei again.
<:FudouEyes:672846284725682195>

Corny
I remember loving it at the time so that means I'll have to rewatch it soon
My memory is pretty shot since I haven't watched it in forever
Better than the romance at least
Its comedy is the best part of the show
Does Sakurasou even count as rom com
What a fucking epiphany to have when I'm dead tired
The Tsundere should be a result of a character's past/trauma and own lie they believe and can be a catalyst for the protagonist to grow as a person (regardless of if the relationship is platonic or romantic) and help the Tsundere grow in the process.
You can make the Tsundere platonic and it wouldn't change shit
In hindsight
That's fucking sad and hilarious
Wait did the Tsundere trope *actually* go full circle?
I need to rewatch Diginee's video on tsunderes again. That was a fun video.
lel
Melua said what I wanted to get at far better
The Tsundere trope itself became bastardized
Asuka from what I've seen and heard is a tsundere that was made before the concept focused solely on the love interest warming up to the protag as opposed to it being about the protag transforming themselves into being somebody who said love interest can warm up to.

There are a lot of LN authors that probably saw Asuka in NGL and thought, "Hey I can do that tsundere stuff too" and missed the point of the trope entirely by making it entirely about the tsun love interest magically becoming dere for their cookie cutter MC for no reason.
lmao
HBS wanted to party too

You've got to blush and run away
No Nevis that's not in the script
I always try not explain something away as malice when it can always be explained as raw incompetency or ignorance. I think that those anime watchers just don't understand that trap specifically refers to crossdressers and appropriate it to anything they feel is similar to the first time they saw it used <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
GNC?
People in the anime community have a tendency of using that word wrong
~~That's what I was trying to get at but I wasn't sure if Lily was a crossdresser or trans since I haven't watched ZLS~~
I thought I remember hearing that she referred to herself as a girl <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>
Wasn't she trans?
Remind me
"trap"
ughhhh that's nasty
As in you won't understand the setting as well or the characterization of some characters because of the details left out
I've heard that leaves too many details out
I have a feeling I'll find something to like about it

I'm not saying what I think, I'm saying what I recall from some interview or the like. I wouldn't be able to find it anymore since I saw it back when I was going through forums for index news so you can take that with a grain of salt I guess
I think Kamachi implied that she was meant to be a thing way earlier in the story but Kamachi wasn't confident in his story telling to go into her backstory until he smashed it out of the park with NT9
Misaki I was expecting due to NT11

Tl;dr it isn't direct about it if it is there
A lot of people in that fandom got yuri out of that story but I wasn't really seeing it. I like to assume I'm dense when it comes to these things considering that I didn't realize Cocona and Papika liked each other in Flip Flappers until the last few episodes (<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>) so you don't have to take my word for it.
"Kinda?" is the best way to put it

https://youtu.be/CXArovLJ60A
He's like Kurosai if he actually uploaded
Problem is that she has no feats other than being able to beat the bXDs who also have no feats other than their base forms being at least light speed <:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I feel like you could make an argument for Carol with that dissection relic being able to beat them since it's the Symphogear equivalent of Beerus' hakai.

Shemmy at full power, with the wanked feats of the gears, can probably take the early DBZ fighters on tbh.
I'll say that if you were to wank the gears powers to their max with the SSJ feat then they should be able to keep up with early DBZ fighters.

Beat them is another matter but they should be about as fast.
Vegeta destroying that one planet was filler but he exclaims that he's more than capable of blowing up Earth with his galick gun which isn't terribly hard to believe with Roshi being capable of destroying the moon in early DB with his full power and Piccolo casually doing it in early DBZ
<:FineShocked:672430513025187840>
I don't think Fine herself was capable of doing so
To be more specific, that cannon Fine had was going to destroy the moon.
I'm fucking around since it literally can't be true for the show to make sense, but for the gears to be able to dodge SSJ beams they'd have to be about speed of light level.
Actually fuck it, in the case where SSJ beams are actually comparable to the speed of light, I'll say that bXDs should be able to keep up with early DBZ fighters since they bare minimum should be speed of light.
I'll just call that an upper end feat if SSJ beams actually travel at the speed of light
Though that would have to mean the girls would have to be capable of faster than light travel to dodge that in their base states b4 they've even gotten their hands on ignite and amalgam
SSJ beams should be about as fast as ki beams since they're both effectively light.
I'm trying to think of ways for the girls to combat late shippuden Naruto and Sasuke/early DBZ fighters and I'm not exactly sure how they'd go about doing it.

Both universes get really stupid with their powercreep by that point
Naruto and Sasuke had some pretty fucking dumb powercreep towards the end of Shippuden as well
All those forms have feats but they were never on the same level as Dragon Ball feats. Hell Roshi was capable of blowing up the moon in early DB and they imply that Goku by the 23rd Budokai is fast enough to be able to dodge lightning (as stupid as that is cause you have to move faster than light)
The most they did was get bodied by shemmy until Bikki hijacked shemmy's power source
Burning XD is hard for me cause they really don't have any feats for me to compare.
Oh shit I forgot about Fine using that one relic to destroy the moon
Eh, you could probably make an argument for Carol with that dissection relic and full powered Shemmy being able to take them on (Raditz especially). I don't think anyone other than them is capable of busting planets with ease.
I also need to give VA-11 Hall-A another go cause I don't think I've gotten everyone drunk in that game yet <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

Honestly if you're looking at anything Index it should be the novels.

Index III isn't something I'd recommend to anyone and I thought Index was a pretty poor adaptation to begin with <:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
Not that I blame them
Yeah that's why I spoilered what I wrote. There are times when i forget that there are people who watch Railgun that haven't seen Index
||~~other than feel like half the girl she used to be~~||

Is that the LN where the girl gets isekai'd and becomes a prostitute?
Since what I read of the manga was not 12 episodes worth <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Heard they added a lot of filler to extend the runtime
I still need to watch the rest of the anime
Hamefura is a goldmine
Carol you seriously underestimate how bad LN writing can get. They'll find a way to insert the same tired gags but with girl protags <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I imagine the reasoning for it doesn't matter if they keep repeating the same tired joke or gag
It's really just average <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I don't think anyone seriously thinks it's bad anymore but they keep beating the dead horse cause it's SAO
SAO is only ever a punching bag

I've seen a couple of clips of Index III only to again remind myself of how bad it looks especially compared to Railgun and even the prior seasons of Index

Sounds like a path for character progression since it sounds like he super possessive. But I'm assuming the show never brings said possessiveness under scrutiny and makes the girl be in the wrong?
Is it not even trash in the "so bad it's good" way?
I wonder if I should give rent-a-harem a shot

The guru has spoken <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Never really fact checked anything I heard about shaft
Kid me heard that kyoani had a cafe and good working conditions so when I heard that Shaft had something similar I assumed that it was the exact same as kyoani <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Guess that was just me connecting dots that had no correlation then
That's a shame too. I remember hearing that Shaft and Kyoani both had good working conditions but I guess something happened to the former.
Average shounen with the Shinbou style touch to the animation direction which makes sense since a lot of the people who worked on it are ex-Shaft staff
> There was no actual screen time to even consider what was happening, it just goes from the first reveal to an immediate explanation. There's no build-up, there's no payoff. This is even worse since the execution on the explanation is so weak, infodumps are by far the worst way you could possibly do a plot twist.

Gonna agree with Lank here. When you want to reveal something crucial about the setting, a writer should be drip feeding said info (ala revealing chunks of the full picture one bit at a time so you can potentially put it together on your own but never giving you the full picture until it's necessary for a twist or something) since people don't want to read an essay on your setting, they want a story.
Shit was 3deep5me
I should really watch the first 2 seasons again
Her design in general doesn't appeal to me but I'm not really sure why that is
There's a lot of boy meets girl mangas where the girl is purposefully being a tease to the boy who may or may not be an introvert. The one that immediately came to mind that I like is the Nagatoro one

I want to contest you on that but I can't think of any other good LN adaptations off the top of my head
Monogatari shifted my opinion on a lot of LN adaptations <:LUL:503065035048747008>
DaL either feels like it moves too slow or too fast
At least compared to the LN
Even in S1, I always felt the anime was really awkwardly paced

With that said, fuck subtext

<@238855496797257729> 

Cause we can't make money off our otaku audience if they get offended from seeing gay relationships <a:15min:490152406475210762>
Subtext yuri is overrated. We need more subtext het romance <:lul:287463662002634752>
~~My favorite brand of producer intervention~~ <a:test:729388039826047007>
Subtext yuri
Ah yes
> the best definition I could come up with is that it's a story where the protagonist attempts to enforce their will on the world using a mechanical (or pseudomechanical)external prosthetic that allows them to enact change on a scale they could never achieve without it
<@!99695384296701952> I love this definition cause it's a subset of what makes the static character arc so fun to watch. Only it's specifically mecha.

Crunchyroll wants to be that but can't due to licensing hell
Steam made pirating such a chore because of how everything is easily accessible on the platform and the platform itself is convenient <:15min:406862587657977866>

Lank
Man
I know, I'm playing devil's advocate <:15min:406862587657977866>
It being based on an irl system wouldn't make it any less of an asspull if it isn't properly explained in the story
Kamachi is a crackhead when it comes to creating power systems or creating abilities ~~and making his character figure them out~~ <:kekw:702321631812649001>
I would say his limits are literally just whatever the universe can physically allow but... <:15min:406862587657977866>
Vector manipulation basically makes it so that he's the most versatile fucking esper around
Accel's powers are funny
Can't immediately think of one
I'm trying to think back on what would feel like an asspull in the story
But then again, the anime probably doesn't explain it at all
I feel like Kamachi does clearly define what a character can and can't do with their abilities
<:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
Asspulls?
<:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
I do remember fundamentally enjoying the science side more in  the anime but I can't remember if i felt the same way while reading the novels
And be mad at what J.C. did to arcs they adapted
Which was just kinda good
Then at least it will be as decent as the first 2 seasons
Well all I hope for is that NT doesn't go into production hell like III did
<a:15min:490152406475210762>

Uzaki's design keeps getting heat on twitter
I still need to read that LN where a girl gets isekai'd and becomes a prostitute
~~It might be missing the flesh fang though~~
Well you're right cause I saw some fanart that did exactly what you're talking about and made Uzaki look good <:LUL:503065035048747008>
That's the move
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
> longer hair and smaller eyes
I'd like to believe that having a civil discourse and understanding the other side so we can both come to a conclusion would be healthier but twitter is clearly not the place for that <:15min:406862587657977866>
No Lank, every short girl needs to be a child. We have to act like we're pc despite body shaming midgets/short people on our moral high horse <:LUL:503065035048747008>
I feel they probably should've dialed the eye size back a bit and given her longer hair or something. Though the flesh fang's gotta go.
They tried way too hard to make her moe and still failed somehow
Doesn't SS1 ||introduce Hamazura Shiage||?
OK so Cypher is technically lying. <a:15min:490152406475210762> 
There are 2 side story volumes in the old testament

SS1 takes place takes place just after the arc with Vento of the Front (?) and SS2 happens all over the place
We should probably spoiler mark this convo though <a:15min:490152406475210762>
||It returns the world to it's natural state?||
I believe it was a ||correction power||?
It's easy to say that
My bad
Anything with "supernatural causes" can be canceled by imagine breaker. I took this as anything that happens as a result of the power that couldn't have possibly occurred otherwise will be canceled. 

So explosions from a bomb created with esper powers will be canceled but the rubble kicked up by the shockwave wouldn't <:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
As far as I remember
<:HyperYrrow:578883022129201162>
I have a mighty need for lesbians
<:kekw:702321631812649001>
That was the punch that made no sense too
*crunchy*
I don't have a problem with a character being relatively simple as long as they can effectively do their role. Especially a flat character arc like the one Touma has. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
ass of main character?
<a:kanadedontfeelgood:706544690635472939>
Cypher keeps hyping up the end of NT. I need to catch up <:sadcat:695095364134502431>
Yeah you can read those if you want to
At the very least, we actually don't have a railgun blocking feat
I believe they stated this somewhere
And the coin is naturally created
Ok so as far as things go, I'm not actually sure if Touma actually ever blocked a railgun. He's blocked all the electric shots and "dodged" one but I can't recall him tanking one.
Well shit like ||Saints are counted as natural regardless of what they do which was Kazuma's way of making Touma's life harder||
Cypher, report
Has IB ever blocked her railgun?
Wait
<:kekw:702321631812649001>
||That's the sound of Iskierka shredding me with a chain saw||
I'm thinking that what Imagine Breaker is doing is a bit more specific. I'm thinking that it checks whatever it comes into contact with to see if it's naturally created. The explosion technically wasn't a natural creation because it was *made* by an esper, same with Misaka's lightning bolts. By absolute fucking technicality, the object Accelerator is launching is a natural creation, it just had it's speed altered. So IB would've be able to do anything about it as a result.
I'm still thinking
Hold Cypher
Actually got me thinking about this shit <:kekw:702321631812649001>
That was a very interesting contradiction to bring up though
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Accel is so busted that he breaks IB on a meta level
lel
I'd want to say it's throughout the entire time the power is still out but since everything basically boils down to vectors you run into the inconsistency with accelerator just outright being able to control vectors so imagine breaker would theoretically be able to cancel his powers and it's results by extension
Then you'd have to question where the esper's influence ends
Explosion created from esper powers - cancel
Lightning bolt created from esper powers - cancel
Object launched as a result of esper powers - uncancelable
If it's just canceling powers then I don't have to think as hard
It's why I have an easier time defining it as just cancelation
There's probably something I'm overlooking here then
<:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
With that said, I'd have to think back on the example more. He's able to revert anything that alters the natural state of the world which means that the entire explosion, which was created entirely by esper powers would have to be entirely unnatural. In the case of Accelerator's powers, the only thing that's unnatural about is abilities would be just his ability to change vectors on the fly. Once an object is out of his hands it would be back in it's natural state since Accelerator no longer has any influence on it with his vector manipulation.
The rest would still go flying at his face
Ok if you want to split hairs about the it, then that means only the part of the object that came into contact with imagine breaker would have it's vectors nulled <:15min:406862587657977866>
It was just everything that came into contact with his right hand
Iskierka he never fully canceled the explosion
Oh right
I need to read
<:sadcat:695095364134502431>
I do the same for Accelerator
I know that feel
<:kekw:702321631812649001>
~~Cypher is fanboying so hard about everybody's powers~~
What type of material would be able to survive the specs you listed to fire the railgun?
<:PogChamp:430233864833859584>
~~Listening to an electrical engineer speak is so fucking interesting as a person that's still not too far in that curriculum~~
Ah
Are you talking about b4 or after it fires?
<:15min:406862587657977866>
We should ask Kamachi for his blueprints since he seems to think of everything and the kitchen sink for his story
Well it wouldn't be the first time Touma lost an arm, I guess
Cause ||Misaka's electric shocks still work on him if they hit anywhere but his right hand. (at least until the current reaches his right hand anyway, I can't remember the specifics of that scene anymore)||
It'd have to be the former
Oh wait no
Either that or the transfer still cancels but I think the arm getting left behind is funnier
^
Kuroko using his right hand was what canceled the process entirely
What if Kuroko tried teleporting Touma with his left hand on oppose to his right
You know what's a funny image
Hey Cypher
<:AyaWow:431116971933827072>
Or at least that first episode where she shot it at Touma
Most times it's a flick, but the first season of index took some liberties iirc. It wasn't a flick that season <:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
You mean to imply that was ever wrong?
That I can't even remember properly
I'm over here panicking about the technicalities of the power system
<:kekw:702321631812649001>
Iskierka is over here questioning my knowledge of Index which hasn't been refreshed in damn near 6 years
Because in that scene she ||deliberately avoided Touma's right hand since she knew how the power worked at that point||
One was in the LNs
> ||"I could stop her from electrocuting you, but she's not gonna kill you and it's funny so I'mma let it happen"||
<@!213645184125239317> Are we thinking of the same scene btw?
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I need to read up on railguns
Regardless he's not stopping the coin
Railgun has always kinda been shown with electricity around it iirc but you can ignore me if not
And based on all other times Touma has used it in practice, we can assume that he'd cancel the charge but the coin itself would destroy his right hand.
brb
I've got a serious urge to watch Kanon 2006's opening again
<:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
idk, it's millh
I also keep forgetting that Air was Key's second VN
I keep forgetting that the more recent Kanon adaptation isn't close to when the vn was released
Holy
>1999
I'm more than willing to indulge in more Maeda
Does Kanon have a translation?
oh
> Wait it got translated?
> Wait there's more than one part now?
So I'm planning on reliving it through the VN
I can't remember shit
But that was like 8 or so years ago
Oh I remember loving Clannad back when I first watched it
I actually had a lot of fun with the latter
Clannad and Little Busters primarily <:15min:406862587657977866>
I still need to read through his prior works
Nice to see Key and P.A. Works work on a project together again
Just caught this

I'm gonna have to reread the novels at some point but I feel like i got the gist of it there.
So out of curiosity Iskierka, was my explanation of IB satisfactory at all?
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

I clicked on the game and saw the video
I'm lacking the knowledge to understand the comparison

I can't forgive you for dropping this bomb and making me want to play Air when i already have 3 other Key VNs I need to get to
Millh
I'm still surprised that I stopped watching it back when it was airing
That shit was soooooooooo good
Yeah it was def ep 4 in Yuri Kuma
I think it was episode 3 or 4
which also had a good op
Oh so it's similar to my love for that one episode of yuri kuma arashi
I need to continue that one
Kyousougiga too gud
<:kekw:702321631812649001>
The opening got me addicted to "MYTH&ROID"
ye
Oh, I mean it's not entirely what you're looking for, but how'd you like Boogiepop's opening?
But man I love Aragoto's so much <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
I guess Mob Psycho and Kanon would be my gold standards <:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
Though it reminded of Mob Psycho's openings
Aragoto's op is so cold holy shit
I do kind of wish more openings would be a experimental as Kanon's opening now. The closest we got was MHA S3's first opening which also had the slow buildup to a climax towards the end of the opening.
Not a single one <:kekw:702321631812649001>
reminder the key adaptation openings don't fucking miss

Smaller eyes and more edges to the face to make it look less round by comparison to the previous image (though that might have more to do with that one being a 3/4 shot compared to whatever the one you sent is called) <:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
<:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
nvm that it's a design choice <:15min:406862587657977866>
I'm still not sure what bugs me about her design
Both those characters look better than Uzaki though
What do you mean Iskierka? Asian characters made by Asian people for an Asian audience have to be white cause I said so <:15min:406862587657977866>
I'm still trying to figure out why I dislike the design
People are saying she looks underage because of the design choice to strap a chibi head to a regular anime girls body <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
Also
*checks notes*
Something about pedophilia?
Something something general public hates anime girls with exaggerated figures
<:kekw:702321631812649001>

Best girl
I'm of the opinion that any topic has its place in a story as long as you have something to say about it. You really shouldn't be using something as delicate as ||rape|| to say "bad man bad" though. There are plenty of other ways to do that without the added baggage and if you continue to do that regardless, it says a lot of interesting things about the author.
~~Is that a Jojo reference??????~~
~~Also Suguha being an absolute piece of shit to Kirito is bloody amazing~~
Pretty nice story in its own right
I watched that with no knowledge on SAO outside of what I vaguely remember from anitubers and enjoyed it
<:kekw:702321631812649001>
I still think my favorite take on the op protag is the dude from Mondaiji-tachi
Power Fantasy is a trope like many others that just needs to be done well imo. I never felt that it was a problem in of itself.
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Diginee used to "shit" on the show all the time and ironically grew attached to the show with time and so did many other anitubers

||That twist made me feel like absolute shit but the movie itself prior to the twist did provide a foundation for Homura's decision||

I'm not really mad about it anymore
<:PogChamp:430233864833859584>

||Though she ended up making the world better for everyone *anyway* despite shitting on Madoka's wish in an attempt to protect her and bring her back from the law of cycles but eh||
It's just that you don't have to agree with her line of logic which is really damn selfish
Her reasoning is all there in Rebellion
<:kekw:702321631812649001>
If he could think of something interesting to do with the story post ||last minute twist|| then I wouldn't mind what he did. The problem was that the sequel didn't happen

> hanebad manga better, it's fairly different in tone
> :wakaru:
<@!152896851660505088> I do remember seeing buzz about the differences between the manga and show
The antagonist is the person who conflicts with the protag is some way shape or form
It's just who the story chooses to follow
Being a protag isn't based on whether or not you're good or evil

Why is every fight I see in the last season fucking tweened and not animated reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
The last 2 seasons were animated really fucking stiff
I'm not going to give you that one Cypher
Eh
<:kekw:702321631812649001>
Hey guys remember Arifureta's CG?
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I never noticed
Hanebado had the badminton be entirely CG
<:15min:406862587657977866>
This is not surprising
Every decade has shitty looking anime guys
I don't care but some people can be put off. I just watch whatever the hell I want
I love when a series is too popular and its fanbase is obsessed with it, it can potentially have the opposite effect on newcomers thinking about jumping in
Or rarely any sakuga
Like there's no sakuga
The fights just don't move as much as the first season from what I remember
I don't know how to place it
https://youtu.be/S8efZrM0xN0
In hindsight maybe I have more of a problem with the choreography than the animation of the later seasons.
These trailers aren't showing me anything <a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
Maybe not 2014 but that last one just kept making me laugh cause of the sheer lack of sakuga i was seeing
lel
They keep destroying Vegeta's character every new arc
Same with Dragon Ball
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Can't say the same for Boruto
The people behind Clover seem to care about it
Studio pierrot goes fucking off in the animation at times
I heard black clover's manga is pretty solid
There are examples of good tweens but Fairy tail's isn't a good example
Oh tween is when it isn't actually animated and they just move an image across the screen Ayaya
~~So many stills and so many tweens~~
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Ayaya gets what I'm saying
I don't see what that has to do with making the fights look good
For immediately going to save his son first thing every chance he got every arc and the one time he fucked up cause he realized his son isn't a fighter he immediately tried to jump in to save him?
For what Zero
We can blame TFS for that one though
It's the same thing with that Goku is a bad dad meme
<:kekw:702321631812649001>
I don't know where the Dragonball is garbage meme came from but everybody is spouting that same rhetoric
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I disagree with you there solopy
So stupid
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Despite the tournament of power making it seem like stamina is this thing that recharges in a couple of minutes when fighting
Everybody has a limited stamina pool
Makes snese
What about SSJ3 is an issue?
Which is why people don't like them as much
But these new transformations weren't earned
I don't mind the colors
lel
Millh I think Goku just feels really weird in Super. Even ignoring the changes Funi made, Goku just doesn't feel like how he acted in Z half the time. He feels more like his Dragon Ball self but that feels like a regression of his character <:15min:406862587657977866>
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
No harm done there
Gohan was already damaged in Boo arc
Are we including Super? I think Super damaged the hell out of Goku and Vegeta's characters
<:15min:406862587657977866>
~~And we also have a full 4 years of Gohan's life that Goku was around for b4 he was kidnapped by Raditz~~
Every other time in the series, he's also quick to jump in and save Gohan first when he's there to save the day
I get your points Zero, him throwing a senzu bean to Cell was extremely stupid of him but he only did it cause he was absolutely confident that it wouldn't mean jack shit. His confidence in his son's strength wasn't unfounded (he was stronger than Goku to begin with at that point in time), he just didn't understand that his son didn't want to fight at the time. when he realized he immediately tried to jump back in.
<a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
Ah man not you too Degu
<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
Goku is a bad dad for not being around for his kids cause he's either dead or incapacitated.
<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Garbage takes man
That's what everybody does instead of moving out the way for some reason
Just tank it
Eventually you will grow lax
It's one of those things where you can say that in hindsight cause Boo did happen but he went several years without any complications or conflicts
Fuck now I want to watch that Gohan video Plague did again
I feel like if you don't have an immediate incentive to keep yourself in shape, you'd probably be like Gohan and stop training eventually anyway
<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
According to Toriyama's timeline shit
Since he does make a book on it
So that it'd make more sense for him to be the one to open up the wonders of the world of ki usage later to the public
As well understanding different ways of fighting and ki usage
That was really fun to listen to cause it made Gohan like Goku who had a passion for fighting but not for the thrill of the fight, but rather learning and understanding the other side.
I actually want to see a story with the rewrite Plague did for Gohan
<:PogChamp:430233864833859584>
<a:test:729388039826047007>
end of story
Videl's character died when she cut off her pigtails
Like I said, Gohan could've very well trained but opted not to
At least b4 Goku came back to life
Hell she trained Goten to be a fighter
You say that like she didn't grow lax with her children after Goku died
<:15min:406862587657977866>
It's not like Chichi can stop Gohan from training if he actually wanted to
<@!238855496797257729> I recommend you watch Plague of Gripes' video on Gohan
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Sounds like ADHD to me
But it was so stupid
I can't say the line on this server
That line Gohan spurted out when he first fought Super Buu is the most out of place, funniest shit ever
The Super community was a joy to be around
Those memes were jokes
Minus <:ree:601827887552659468>
Oh right those
Which is the cannon that Super seems to be following
Dead zone is like the only one that can arguably be considered Toei cannon
Gohan with his bang down is objectively superior to everything else
Gohan Blanco? <:PogChamp:430233864833859584>
<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
I'd rather UI be just Omen but just the ability to move the body w/o thinking. None of that power up nonsense.
UI became a glorified power up
Can't get that consistently in the TV show
But I want to see the animators bust a nut on the screen again
So better economic decision
Super tv would print more money off of merchandise
We need a movie as good as BoG <a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>

<@!152896851660505088> Damn millh what's with the sheer difference in tone between the manga and anime
Fun opening chapter
Just gave the first 2 chapters of hanebado a read
<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
They made a really good original
There we go

The fucking flex this mangaka has to put his viewers through almost a year of this shit
That's on average like 400 pages of sheer badminton and psychological warfare in just one match
I just went through 10 straight chapters of a badminton match
Why is this shit so fun to read
I'm watching anime badminton athletes play 4D chess with each other and engage in psychological warfare <:kekw:702321631812649001>

<:Boss_FeelsGood:727406337541013585>
Connie is so adorable in the manga good fucking lord
||I just got to the handkerchief scene between Koaruko and Ayano in the manga and while it more or less played out the same, it was still b4 Ayano became an absolute jackass||
I think they concatenated a lot of Hanebado's story so that a lot of things that happened throughout the manga happened at the same time in the anime
Oh I see what the anime did
Also the coach is so fucking cool <a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>

One thing I wish this manga used more liberal use of is the white lines. Some of these panels are clearly supposed to be telling me that a character is doing an action but I feel like there's not enough information in the panel half the time to specifically tell what they're doing
But is it unapologetically horny
Intersomething reviewers

<@!152896851660505088> Thanks for getting me into reading Hanebado. I'm not terribly sure if I want to finish reading the entire thing though. Something about it lost me after a certain point.

Yes he was that in group
A person who does bad shit for a good purpose?
I mean he kinda was that while he was still in group but he kinda stops being one after that
Accelerator feels like a weird character to call an anti hero
It's funny cause he clearly like physics enough to make a story around it but it's not like he's a physicist
<:lul:287463662002634752>
I mean it's not a hard thing to guess
<a:15min:490152406475210762>
I always got the idea that magic is closer to espers in that you can only really specialize in a couple of things
On the topic of the magic side, were there ever times where the abilities weren't clearly defined or explained while fighting. Maybe it's because I read the novels but I can't recall any times where I was actually confused or thought "hey this is bullshit"
Electromagnetism is actually a pretty diverse thing to work with if you go into physics
And electromagnetism
Putting a set of clear and cut abilities in situations that stress what their character can do to their absolute limit is interesting
I disagree there actually

Imagine having an ability that messes with the coefficient of friction
<:kekw:702321631812649001>
Oh and the black haired girl had an ability that made me lose my shit
I only remember them for getting shit on by accelerator and nothing else
I didn't even realize that dark side group that appeared in Accelerator were the ones in the Railgun manga either <:15min:406862587657977866>

<@!205859030051061769> I wasn't kidding when I said I couldn't remember shit about these characters
It set a trend for dark mahou shoujos that didn't understand what madoka did right
It's far more hopeful than that if a bit bittersweet
Madoka isn't like Magical Girl Site if that's what you're asking
> Ok but a low coefficient of friction doesn't mean a falling steel beam won't kill you from blunt force trauma
<@!205859030051061769> You can also fuck with Accel's vector manipulation by either throwing something he doesn't understand at him or reversing your vector at the moment of contact to make accelerator hit himself but that doesn't mean that vector manipulation isn't cool
It's where I got a look into akiyuki shinbo's history

Rebellion needs another rewatch
Alright then
So we at least agree that Homura wanted to perpetuate the relationship
> ||Why would Homura want to pair the two up if she’s never met Bebe? She only knows her as the Sweets Witch.||
<@!155150213445582850> 
Haven't thought that hard. It's something the movie just expected you to take at face value
||Homura may not have had control over Bebe, but she did alter Mami's memories and she deliberately made Bebe her main friend in Rebellion iirc||

I'd have to rewatch it. It's been a while
||Bebe wanting to be friends with Mami and Homura wanting to pair them up can both be true||
||I still don't see how that refutes that it's still what Homura wanted||
||All the intruders, minus Madoka who intentionally had her memories removed, acted out all of Homura's wishes in the labyrinth anyway despite being aware of the situation unlike Mami and Kyoko||
That doesn't change what I said
||Also since they're in Homura's labyrinth, the fact that Homura made a life where everyone is happy and even gave Mami a friend in the form of Bebe speaks volumes about her character. Also the false peace in that labyrinth sets the stage for the world she later creates when she hijacks the Law of Cycles <:15min:406862587657977866> ||
The cake song is one of my favorite scenes in the movie

It's why you don't make spin offs of main characters

Haganai is like one of the few shows that does that
It was a funny effect

I think I remember those that recommended the show drawing parallels to Konosuba so I should probably get around to watching that show too
if you don't you probably aren't gonna like the comedy
I think a lot of it is based on whether or not you fuck with the protag

I'll have to give that one a rewatch
Fucking Sabagebu <:Euphoria:688429724032172116>

This wasn't exactly what I was thinking of but yeah this is still bad writing. There's no point in making them that strong for no reason and arbitrarily fodderize them just to make them train for like 2 seconds to then beat their enemy w/o an issue. 

I'm assuming there was no character development or growth that went into him being able to beat his enemy either right? <:15min:406862587657977866>
Mediocre is the landscape of LN adaptations. Honestly don't know why people still eat this shit up <:15min:406862587657977866>
Having all the strength in the world doesn't matter if you're still incapable of saving someone or, in Saitama's case specifically, where his strength didn't solve the emptyness he felt about his life
Having super strong MCs can work as long as all their conflicts can't be solved through their strength imo
It also helps that Saitama's main conflict isn't external so his strength doesn't matter
She a genius born from raw drive and endless practice
Where the mc is seen as talented but really she's just been curious and obsessed about badminton since she was baby and her mother helped fuel that drive
I did like how Hanebado flipped that idea on its head

Abyss you'd probably like Progressive better then from what I've heard
So S1 isn't good cause Sinon isn't there?
tbh
The discussion would go by faster if both sides just explained what they liked and disliked about SAO
I had a blast reading them b4
I wonder how I'd feel about the index novels now that I haven't read them in like 6 years
<:15min:406862587657977866>

XDU ate up my time b4 I started macroing
<a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
It was a combination of college and XDU
Actually you know what killed my interest in watching anime
The anime did a lot of the characters dirty and Touma in particular got hit hard similar to Shirou in like...every Fate adaptation
In any case I will always concede on Touma just not being as interesting as the other protags if that's what you're getting at
I'm dumb
<:feelsthinkerman:590048222609801216>
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Misaki is a protag? I think Cypher mentioned something about her being more important but i haven't read that far.
||Accel's entire dilemma was based around his self perception as a villain for what he had previously done while trying to also emulate Touma and his actions as a hero||
<:15min:406862587657977866>
All the protags put their ideals out there with their chest
Though S3 of Index legit pissed me off so I'm not sure which one is worse
Accel was the only Raildex anime that actually bored me
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I already told you that accel is aggressively mid
That's a bad ratio
and how many volumes are that compared to the volumes where Touma is the focus?
And that narrator has a tendency of following Touma the most
The series is definitely viewed through his lens a majority of the time so its not outrageous to claim that he's the main protagonist though <:15min:406862587657977866>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
> i assure you, the series is not centered around touma
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696> The series tries its damnest to make you think that he is though

Hey the anime made what he did look like some deus ex machina shit according to Lank
<a:atopkek:541000170347823104>
plot armored especially
Unless you're Akiyuki Shinbo
But no one is insane enough to adapt the monologues
Removing his monologues destroys a part of his character
Index in particular is bad about this. A lot of Touma's character comes across in his inner thoughts as well as his actions
It's the result of the VN/LN writing not being good for adaptation purposes
A lot of the characters in the story wouldn't be where they are w/o Touma's influence. He's the one driving other characters to change while overcoming his own obstacles and staying close to his ideals. This is a story that follows him and the effect he has on others very similar to Dragon Ball's Goku. Stating that he isn't the main protag just feels off <:15min:406862587657977866>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I'm saying he's the main protagonist
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I'm not giving them the benefit of the doubt
They're going to fuck up NT9-10
Cypher bet you can't wait to see Baggage city get adapted and have all the good atmosphere and tone that volume had get shit on like Battle Royale
Can't wait till the anime destroys his character in NT
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>

Even the magical concepts are easy to understand cause Kamachi just flat out explains it through the character's figuring it out
Index isn't terribly complex in the timeline
yes
I'm actually not familiar with Aleister's book

Ah right
OT is Old Testament, NT is New Testament, and GT is Genesis Testament I think?
Well time to download it again
<a:test:729388039826047007>
Oh beautiful, everything in between vol 1 of OT and vol 2 of GT including side stories content is like 1.3 gigabytes
<:15min:406862587657977866>
So many pdfs of the volumes
<:MikuSmug:655125664986300457>
The one I had was a damn gig+
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Cypher all the volumes are already compiled on a torrent
I did read Yen Press' translation. It was nice albeit a bit more stiff than JS06's translation
So they had to drop it
baka tsuki got DMCA'd fz

He'll probably send you to the same place
Or Cypher can do it
Used to be baka tsuki but I can recommend you a place

I thought MHA got a faithful adaptation
~~The joke here is that MHA came out after SAO~~

<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
Where is the SAO stan brigade
demon slayer
That's the problem with his sheeple of a fanbase that can't think for themselves and need validation. An unfortunate reality with any celebrity really. People need validation from people they look up to <:15min:406862587657977866>
I feel like that's a little too cynical of you Solopy. Can a person not just have an opinion that happens to align with the majority consensus?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Is that the fault of him or his fanbase?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
He and the professional shitbag are trying to chase the bag
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
>Gigguk
Digi actually started the SAO hatedom with that video <:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
Very raw <:LUL:503065035048747008>
Nothing wrong with that but I do love the rant styled reviews like how Digi used to do his
Glass Reflection, as far as I can remember, is one of the anitubers that tries to construct his reviews like how professional reviewers do.
Which just boils down to opinions
All the anitubers I see just talk about and explain why they feel a certain way about an anime
Wait what anituber even acts like their opinion is objectively correct anymore
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
I didn't watch MHA, I'm just putting together info from what others are saying
enjoy the ride
It's gonna be doodoo
Don't kid yourself
Lank
<:15min:406862587657977866>
> Whats the point of confirmation bias like seriously

Doesn't it ever just feel nice to have someone you like also like what you like? When you introduce something to somebody and they end up liking it you feel a strange sense of validation? It's that type of thing. 

"If somebody likes what I like, especially someone big, then my opinion must be 'correct'"
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>

Oh nvm
I wonder if that's the word im looking for
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
if it doesn't do anything interesting with them then it turns into a cliche <:15min:406862587657977866>
Hey a show using its tropes well is fine
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
Entertaining binge culture
Netflix waiting until the entire anime is out b4 fully putting it out right?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Do people hate GoH and ToG?
Never finished it <:15min:406862587657977866>
That was a cute show
Oh Sweetness and Lightning
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Same
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
I want to say Highschool DxD
There was another anime that got close but I can't remember what it was
<:15min:406862587657977866>
~~Not that fake shit~~
Need more actual polygamy in anime
<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
One of the few harems I actually liked for the wholesome harem aspect. I really liked how it was an actual harem and not one where a bunch of people flirt and hang around the main person until said person gets the balls to decide on who to choose
Oh hey just passed by Sekirei
Shoutouts to Kanokon
<a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
~~Really can't remember if I actually finished this one~~
I recognize the name of this one but I can't recognize anyone from this story <:Euphoria:688429724032172116> 

Damn it's been years since I saw this one
I remember watching this one but I can't remember the story at all. All I can remember is thinking we got the wrong protag and the opening being the best thing since sliced bread
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Samurai Champloo was 2004?!
Holy shit
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
That didn't work out
I think I tried to watch FMA and FMA: Brotherhood back 2 back
Oh the first FMA adaptation
and decided to start watching it
When I was like 11 or 12
I watched a cool asf AMV of this one
I remember how I found this one
Another first
Can't remember how I found it though
One of the first shows I watched
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
What a fucking find
<:15min:406862587657977866>
rn I'm just scanning through a couple of shows starting from winter of 2000
Alright so I decided to finally get down to adding all the shit I've watched to my myanimelist profile
~~tmw I actually don't watch anime~~
I think I forgot the password to it
<a:test:729388039826047007>
Do I even have my account anymore?
Actually..
I only watched all of the part 1 anime
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Oh and Bleach too
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Haven't even thought about it until just now
I forgot I watched them when I made my acc
I wonder how my list looks with Naruto and the entirety of Dragon Ball added
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Then the novelty wore off and I could see right through the reused tropes which turned into cliches
My dislike of harem now probably comes from the fact that I watched it nonstop when I was younger
<a:PU_KEK:747989798144311438>
~~Got to the last episode and dropped it~~
~~I never finished the show btw~~
I think I watched this while it was airing too
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
Literally the second anime I watched knowing it was an anime
I get hit with a wave of nostalgia
I get reminded of this show
Every single time

It was dumb fun from what I can remember
It kinda is
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
Sweet memories
Oh dog days
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Also dense main protag <:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
Talking about Shakugan no Shana
All I remember about it was that it was slow
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Like 6-8 years ago
I've seen it
A lot of it was just the perverted shit around the main character <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
And there are parts of the show that I distinctively remember being grating
I watched SnO at least 3 times
It's been too long
<:PogChamp:430233864833859584>
>Madhouse made an Ironman adaptation
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
MM! was fucking wild
Sora no Otoshimono was fun from what I can remember

Another great find
holy fuck
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>

I did have fun reading the manga till I got tired of sifting through the bad grammer
ye
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I say supposedly cause the translation is ass
There was only one yuri harem show and it was an ass adaptation of what is supposedly a good manga
Lank plz
I need it
<:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
Was monogatari the one that got close?
Actually
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
wtf
wait
ah
That's ringing bells
Did the author die?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
This was a surprising find
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
I was thinking of Urara Meirochou when you said Inari kon kon
Oh I was thinking of the wrong anime
~~I'll just add that to the plan to watch~~
Never watched it
I had my eye on that
Oh Inari kon kon
*pain*
That might've been what contributed to the burn out at natural
I think I started watching Aria for yuri too
I felt this
Man
<:15min:406862587657977866>
> The big yuribait.
ah
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>
I thought you were joking
It's actually shounen
wait wtf
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Which Aria?
No I'm not watching MHA <:15min:406862587657977866>
<:NotLikeMiku:631519444501266432>
Jesus fucking...all the shows I completed were harems
Dropped it all 3
I think I tried watching it like...3 times
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I can't remember when I dropped that series
Oh hey Ro-Kyu-Bu
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
So I'll have to settle for digital
I wish I backed it for the physical version but I didn't find out the kickstarter until after it finished
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Oh man
<:15min:406862587657977866>
And seeing everybody slowly lose their shit
I was paying attention to that kickstarter too
Feelsbad for all the poor fuckers who backed it
<a:PU_KEK:747989798144311438>
Oh
We're talking about Kodomo no Jikan right?
They actually did
Millh
I already watched all of Kodomo no Jikan, I'm planning on reading through the manga at some point
Too bad it's hidden under all the fanservice of middle school aged kids <:15min:406862587657977866>
The heavy shit in that show spoke to me
Speaking of that show, I should eventually get to finishing an actual guilty pleasure that is Kodomo no Jikan
<:15min:406862587657977866>
<a:PU_KEK:747989798144311438>
I must've not made an impression when I was 12-14 cause I legit can't remember it
<:wack:386334796839911424>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I actually don't remember much fanservice in that show but then again I can't remember the show
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>
10 volumes in 12 episodes?
Next on the list of light novel harem adaptations I dropped
I do remember watching this b4 going to high school
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
It was junior high probably
Yeah you're right
<:feelsthinkerman:590048222609801216>
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
I think my friend in middle school recommended me to watch this one
*Man*
Outside of being a siscon
<a:15min:490152406475210762>
I haven't even watched innocent sisters yet so I don't even know her personality yet
"I didn't even watch the show"
<:lul:287463662002634752>
Didn't she also sing the apple song in G
~~Just hold hands like real people~~
Which according to the yuri master is larger than I thought among otaku culture
The same people who reject shoujo ai for "eww girls kissing" i guess
I'm surprised Yuri on Ice doesn't have a shounen ai tag
oh that
I can't remember it
I guess it was good
for qualidea code?
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Then I looked at the characters and remembered
> ~~u can still enjoy shows if theyre not gay~~
I say this cause I watched this like 3 years after it came out. I usually don't up and watch shows out of nowhere like that so there had to be a reason
The long running format needs to die
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Like MHA
Putting it out yearly
Instead of, you know
Why watch Boruto when you can watch that other show studio Pierrot is shitting out weekly
Why else would I randomly watch shit
Of course
I know why I watched it
Oh wait
<:15min:406862587657977866>
That was a...fun ride i guess
When did I even watch that
Oh fuck Qualidea code
Show by Rock was 2015 <:feelsthinkerman:590048222609801216>
<:LUL:503065035048747008>

Did i even finish Noragami?
Actually
<:15min:406862587657977866>
For my myanimelist profile. I'm actually giving a shit enough to jot down everything I've watched so far
There aren't many shows I know pre 2000
Nah I'm starting in 2000 and working my way to the current year
Went in for the animatioin
Was admittedly surprised by the yuri in that show
Shoutouts to Yozakura Quartet
The beginning of the edgy madoka clones
Oh fuck it begins
You mean the insight ova?
Very interesting season though
I remember being annoyed by the second season of Gatchaman Crowds
👌
Oh gatchaman crowds aired at the same time
I wonder why I stopped watching it a while back
I forgot about this one
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I think it was when that red haired senpai magical girl came in
The one I dropped about 20 episodes in <:15min:406862587657977866>
Oh hey doki doki precure came out in 2013
Cutest fucking show ever
It was fucking Mitsuboshi colors
Oh you know what made me stop watching the loli harem show
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
I was satisfied with the 4 episodes i watched
I dropped it 4 episodes in
Does anybody remember this one <:15min:406862587657977866>
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Oh this show was cute. I would recommend it to <@!278860841485598720> but he probably already watched it
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I've just wanted to watch it cause The Best Guy Ever was stanning the fuck out of this one a couple of years ago
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Are they?
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
And put CW on it
Past me already accounted for how forgetful I am
Oh I found it
<:MikuSmug:655125664986300457>

I already know about the pair in particular cause I accidentally spoiled myself
I need to watch Kakegurui <a:test:729388039826047007>

<:LUL:503065035048747008>
That's a lot of shows for someone who doesn't watch anime
Interesting
This show got surprisingly wholesome albeit tired
Man was I desperate for yuri...
Not some "Will he pick the girl" bullshit
For it actually being harem
I'm still standing by it having easily my favorite harem in all of anime
nvm that
Uses it being a battle royal as a negative against it <:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>
<.<
legend of the galactic heroes?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Speaking of I should probably add Akira to my watchlist
<a:YrrowPopcorn:577519698489638921>
Nothing wrong with liking a show the most
Hey let em think that <:15min:406862587657977866>
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
If a show isn't hooking you by the first 3 episodes at most then you probably aren't gonna like it moving forward. Surprised you even listened to the WN/LN fans there since the books aren't indicative of the anime's quality.
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Sounds like a show that would be better binged
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>
I already had this on the plan to watch
Past me continues to one up me
Guess I can add that to the plan to watch on mal
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
I need to watch bungou stray dogs at some point
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
wait horimiya is getting an anime?
Besides Angel Beats
That was that other show P.A. Works and Key worked on together right?
Uh
Oh Charlotte
<:15min:406862587657977866>
If it was the 2002 version you watched a shit adaptation
Really refreshing
Early 2000s anime still had the 90s aesthetic
F
The first attempt at Kanon
Full metal panic in winter
oh nvm
Nothing interesting from what I saw
Guess I'll add that to the rewatch pile
I wonder how I'd feel about it now
and I distinctly remember hating it more and more with each rewatch
I watched it multiple times as a kid
It's easily the most out there anime in terms of the year cause I rarely go b4 like 2005
I still forget how I found that one
<:15min:406862587657977866>
That shit was 2002
I watched UFO Princess Valkyrie
<:feelsthinkerman:590048222609801216>
This is a 2005 anime
Damn I thought you were a boomer
Or at least I recognize the designs
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>
I've probably seen this b4
Wait
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
biyori? As in non non biyori?
They've been mostly books
Wait have I even watched any drama *shows* recently?

God bless Sabagebu
<:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
Most of my favorite stories from the last while have been in the comedy/drama genre
Actually in hindsight
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Everybody loves that one
That's on the plan to watch
Don't have a preference for a specific genre
I just watch whatever interest me enough to watch it
I'm not too familiar with shows pre 2000 though
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
I can just give you my mal if you want to see it
Key's songs are really fucking good
I'll keep a look out whenever I get to the Clannad VN
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Oh sunohara did get an arc <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696> 

I'm guessing Kyoani adapted Clannad pretty faithfully unlike JC with Little Busters right?
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I really should read Clannad
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
I've been procrastinating on that one for like 5 years
I'll read it whenever I get around to reading Clannad
It was probably the second time actually
Maybe?
<:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
I actually won it the first time I think
It's a fun minigame
You mean that one that happens in the normal route?
I just wished I read it
I'm not
<:15min:406862587657977866>
There's so much magic in that VN for like the 1 and a half routes I played
Man I'm so pissed that I watched Little Busters first rather than read the VN
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
Didn't Tomoyo After get its own VN though or am i thinking of something else?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I am surprised by the amount of shit that didn't make its way into the anime
I started reading the Little Busters VN a while back
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Don't watch the anime
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I can't even read
Millh plz
Same with Little Busters
Clannad was saddening but I was happy towards the end
By the end of a Key show I'm usually more happy than depressed
Depressing is an interesting word
Key just does VNs <a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
I say P.A. Works cause Key isn't an animation studio
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
You'll get to see Aincrad reborn
Wait till Progressive gets its adaptation
I wouldn't have an issue with the same contradictions now
I was 14 and didn't want to think
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
I tried it a couple of times
It's something you can do if you want
No I'm memeing
<:big_brain2:695107615797149696>
Why figure out a contradiction on the cross examination if you can just throw all your evidence at each line of dialogue until you manage to find one
<a:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAnim:430233946186448896>
<:PhoenixThinking:430233864879996928>
I'm the king of save scumming in Ace Attorney
Little Busters is a VN I can't see myself save scumming for in story reasons
I'm cringing and giggling like a dumbass on every page
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
Boule this manga is bloody amazing
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
It plays the protag's need to see a girl's panties so damn straight and serious that it comes off so fucking funny
First chapter of that manga was amazing
Hard carried the show
Both him and Ruri actually
I forgot how much I liked Shuu in Nisekoi
<:wack:386334796839911424>
I-
Alright I'll give it a read
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Since when did this get a manga
Oh wait wtf
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
For which manga
The last 3 episodes of Bakemonogatari are ONAs
OVA is an animation typically sold on a disc while ONA is an animation meant for distribution online
It's pretty trivial
That wasn't in the ONA
I'm looking through the new shit he added on danbooru
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
40hara only got more and more powerful with disgust art
and goddamn
I'm not sure this next one is even going to do that
<:15min:406862587657977866>
At least the girls in that one make you feel like a piece of shit for even asking
https://myanimelist.net/anime/37021/Iya_na_Kao_sare_nagara_Opantsu_Misete_Moraitai This right? <@!278860841485598720>
Actually I think the idea of a dude going around on all 4s begging for nudes might be worse
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Objectifying girls three steps at a time <:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
Good ol anime
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Oh jesus christ
That's a good sign
Oh and Doga Kobo is the studio behind GJ-BU?
I'll give that a watch at some poimt
So the person who wrote for the Iyapan manga also wrote the GJ-BU anime that came out like 7 years ago
<a:kanadedontfeelgood:706544690635472939>
and fuck me im caught up
Reminds me of how I felt about YuriCam and Miru Tights
Iyapan has no right to be as fun and engaging as it is
Yeah
It's been like a good 4 months
I wonder if I recommended Carolnein the YuriCam too <:feelsthinkerman:590048222609801216>
Glad I got the Yuri Master to read it while she was still surfing this channel a lot
YuriCam was a funny ass read too
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Only instead of a battle manga revolving around a girl conquering other girls it's a battle manga revolving around a dude trying to conquer girl's panties
Fucking YuriCam
Oh that's what this manga is starting to remind me of
<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
What I want is an anime adaptation of the manga adaptation
That's all i said
<a:ChrisWhat:669566598247481346>
And I said it was trash
Iya pan did get an anime
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
The manga is an adaptation of those illustrations too
The original illustrations the manga was based on did
The manga didn't have an anime
<:wack:386334796839911424>
Cause whatever they did for the actual anime was garbage by comparison
Damn we should've got an anime adaptation of the manga adaptation
<a:PU_KEK:747989798144311438>
Bro Iyapan's manga adaptation is off the fucking wall
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
wtf
Bro why is this manga so unironically good
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
<a:test:729388039826047007>
Holy shit
Ok Anubis is already having great interactions with Issei
The main dude puts me through some ridiculous laughing fits and a fuckton of pain

<:worryKMSHappy:448791607794335764>
Man this manga pains me
Ah don't disappoint me Lank, I want to watch that one <:LUL:503065035048747008>
White Album 2?
Alongside Index
<:HyperYrrow:578883022129201162>
I'm about to have a lot of books to read soon
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Adachi
Ah
I feel like there's another LN I'm forgetting
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Best girls were the little sister/teacher but they weren't even on the list
I should wishlist that "I'm in love with a villainess" LN
Oh that reminds me
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I need something a bit more milk toast than NTR
<:feelsthinkerman:590048222609801216>
<:worryHyperPeek:569138069601648651>
Lank I like the way you think
Ascended the limits of human thought with their big brain
Someone on a higher plane of existence
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Always? Aren't you two both purple?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
I say it was weird but I don't remember hating it either
I vaguely remember S3 being weird
<:wack:386334796839911424>
Man I should give SnS another watch shouldn't I
<:15min:406862587657977866>
From what I can remember
But I think it has a lot of tropes that I grew very jaded to
I loved that show when I first started watching anime back in 2011 or 2012
Shakugan no Shana is probably a show I'd struggle to finish now
<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
<:wack:386334796839911424>
Eh fuck it I'm going to focus on the yuri books
This backlog only continues to fucking grow
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>
Kannazuki no Miko
I have another show to watch
Man
<:HYPERMIGHT:373272574865702924>
Ok the cons are nulled
Oh she does have zettai ryouiki
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
cons:
blond
lacking twintails
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>
Man good ol fashioned subtext yuri. My favorite
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Is it already the summer steam sale
$8.00 in price <:falconsweat:717158801970823229>
<:ff:695097434996736030>
That's already a plus in my eyes
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
iirc It got an original story
Sign me up
You mean I get to see twitter lose its shit for a whole nother season?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Not something meant to turn you on like actual ecchi
It was just perverted gag humor wasn't it?
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
I thought you were talking about something that was actually ecchi
Ah
Or Highschool DxD?
You mean highschool of the dead?
<:KizunaLUL:312964106028187658>
Which means the backlog only gets bigger
and the Kamachi machine never stops
Fuck Cypher keeps reminding me that I actually need to read through index again <:NotLikeMiku:631519444501266432>

~~Carolnein also hates Touma with a passion so it's not like anything you say will actually convince her to read it~~
I kinda wish I didn't think like that back then
What is Carolnein going through what I did with Attack on Titan back in 2013/2014 where the sheer amount of discussions revolving around the show is what turned me off from it? <:15min:406862587657977866>
<:PauseChamp:662691991934468136>
At least Lank will get more quality entertainment
<:Euphoria:688429724032172116>

<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
I usually don't use their subs but the fact that I'm not gonna see the horrible subs label on torrents for shows from here on out is gonna fucking irk me
<a:ChrisFlag:714356990301831178>
Wait wha
Also Rika's entire face in that screenshot is hilarious

Not being able to finish Sakura Trick will forever be the one thing I'm sad about. That feels like a required watch for a yuri lover <a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
> Romance on its own is boring without an actual conflict

Actually what I said here applies to pretty much anything in a story lmao
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
I am planning on watching yuri on ice actually Cocoa
<:HyperMakinoThink:382270355261227009>
Fucking no
<a:KizunaStareHyper:465947540286603265>
And dropped it everytime
I tried like 4 separate times to watch it
<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
I really wanted to like sakura trick
I really wanted to
Romance on its own is boring without an actual conflict
Sakura Trick had no story worth a damn which is why it was boring. That wouldn't fly even if it was het <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:HAhaa:586779645936926760>
Am I about to rewatch Code Geass just to remind myself of one scene

Wait I actually can't remember
<:15min:495770478678638593>
<a:SGuraBongo:754547941741428756>
Shut it cocoa let me be excited

You'd probably enjoy Seabed
Fenny
<:ChrisAwe:672579889685069889>
But still
Well I guess there's never enough
Got too much yuri to watch
Lank I need to start watching anime again <:NotLikeMiku:631519444501266432>

I swear there aren't enough tagged yuri anime on MAL to match that number

Spent too long helping my sister through Ace Attorney's first trial and arguing with her about Danganronpa <a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>

I try to imagine myself writing an action scene and it just feels genuinely impossible
P-90, I always wonder how the hell people can do action well in novels
he makes everything flow so easily from panel to panel
That shit is easy as hell to read
Cocoa hasn't read Toriyama's DB <:BigBrain:639457697556594698>
I can probably do the manga tho
I can't sit through the DB anime like I used to
Funny I can't do that anymore
<:BigBrain:639457697556594698>
Brb watching all of Pokemon
DragonBall super is included too now
<a:bapbapbap:638108545627455528>

Nah ill just look up a clip
erai subs

I loved the sakuga in S1 when it popped up
^
<:HAhaa:586779645936926760>
Since DB fans like buying the same shit over and over again but repackaged, Funi gets free money
Thanks DB
<a:KizunaStareHyper:465947540286603265>
Funi is having a field day with all this yuri
I'll just read the novels at that point

Are you guys saying Adachi is gonna have the same problems as Index and Fate?
Oh no
Funny as shit
Oh ye I saw that
iirc
And when a season 2 is announced, it's usually cause it was planned to get one from the get go
<a:15min:490152406475210762>
Who's Rem?
<:CatPolite:606455522757181441>
It's been like a good 6 years so I'm probably overdue
I just fail to see why people like vehemently hate Touma <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696> 

Do I have to give the index anime a watch again
<:HAhaa:586779645936926760>
<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
Or nyaa
Alright so I can probably find it on baka tsuki
Mondaiji didn't get licensed did it?
Hmm
Actually had a protag that didn't feel like a self insert
Mondaiji was a lot of fun
It took me a hot second to remember what last embryo is
Wait imma check the kickstarter

*pain*
<:HyperMakinoThink:382270355261227009>
I need to see that Frenda/Saten episode
Aww fuck I still have to watch Railgun T
He's not really that much different from most shonen protags from what I remember of the anime version
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>

<:MikoSweat:652083087689121802>
2.5k comments on the KnJ kickstarter and there are only 974 backers
Though in the anime I think it had something to do with how fun the 4 main characters were
The entire setting just seems like a lot of fun to be in similar to NGNL
Default to nyaa
Note to self:
<:CatPolite:606455522757181441>
Dmca?
How tf
Felt satisfied with that one chapter <:LUL:503065035048747008>
I read the first chapter of the manga a while back
Oh right Professor Layton
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Only thing I can immediately think of that similar to that is the ace attorney spin off game
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
<a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
To get baited and see a new story
It would've been a great surprise
I wish i watched the anime now
Ah fuck
<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
That gives me more reason to watch it now
I'm lost lmao
So this a sequel to the entire story from the VNs?
Wait, the hell?
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
<:GuraThink:763994528863486013>
It's what happens when you name weapons after those used in various mythologies and folklore

Yeah this season
What Adachi?
<:MatsuriPoint:737711119845818388>
Not so much nice things about the second season
I heard the first season was
It has some movies
<:PepeHands:624992669180887040>
But we loved you all the same
Your subs were indeed horrible
Rip horriblesubs
When you said BFG I Immediately thought of Doom

Wow Lank's being extra horny for the girls in Assault Lily

<:PepeHands:624992669180887040>
Especially from dmjii who had a literal confession in G and we got nothing big from them after
Like the subtext is obvious but fuck I want more than what we got
Which is why I said I wouldn't know <a:YrrowThinkLick:577519696405069844> 

Just make the entire list Adachi and we good
Also I don't know about the rest of this list but Kakegurui and the 3rd one are actually openly gay and not "have your cake and eat it too" subtext nonsense Symphogear liked to do <a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
<a:15min:490152378327105556>

<:15min:495770478678638593>
But Angel Beats is 13 episodes
I was gonna say "What about Angel Beats"
We got half of the story at the time
I probably finished the first season actually

<:15min:406862587657977866>
<:worryWeirdSmile:641391429427658752>
<:NotLikeMiku:631519444501266432>
This is starting to hurt guys
<a:PU_ppArrivePointLOL:750749796699996211>
In any het show they'd be kissing in the first episode <a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
Kinda like Symphogear actually
~~Being about as subtle as a brick wall to the face but not directly stating anything~~
Assault Lily is about to push the limits how hard you can be gay without being gay <:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>
Absolutely ear grating
I couldn't watch it for the main girl's voice alone
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
That was a thing
Oh yeah
Can we go back to talking about Adachi <:sadcat:695095364134502431>
<:sadcat:695095364134502431>
Raine plz
<:BigBrain:639457697556594698>
<:KiaraPain:756566132923695113>
<a:atopkek:541000170347823104>
Friends for life
More overt than Symphogear. I'm very miffed about them doing nothing with dmjii and hibimiku
The shit just doesn't exist
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>
Dw Fenny, the yuri master and I are still trying to find a yuri action show
Which leads to the HS fetishization
The other half is that HS is considered the last time people get to have free time and enjoy their lives b4 they have to go to college and work some job for 24/7 with no social life to speak of
<:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
I'd say that's a part of the reason Taq
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>
When did I get the digital versions of the Houseki no Kuni manga
<:GuraEyes:757621391250948178>
Maybe I will actually
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
Getting this and Adachi
<:PU_PepeHands:585216463187738624>
The shit I do for yuri
Digital it is
Alright fuck it
<a:PU_PepeCryJam:531807278689550357>
Ah fuck I wanna read it now but I like reading physical more than digital
<a:aMoriWorry:756410702461272174>
Shit the physical version of *I'm in love with the Villainess* isn't coming until November
https://sevenseasentertainment.com/series/bloom-into-you-light-novel/
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
They didn't write the manga for bloom into you but the LN spin off
Correction
Adachi's author also did Bloom into You apparently
<:PauseChamp:662691991934468136>
r/ZettaiRyouiki is probably also having a field day
Lmao
I haven't even checked that sub novanity
<:HAhaa:586779645936926760>
I must watch <:HyperMakinoThink:382270355261227009>
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<:AmeliaWhat:754662581909848154>
<a:PU_ppArrivePointLOL:750749796699996211>
<a:worryLickHyper:590567271911653381>
Alright I'm downloading the episodes now
Goddamnit
<:HAhaa:586779645936926760>
<:CatPolite:606455522757181441>
Accelerator is already a protag in Index with his own sorts of meaningful development so the story just can't do anything interesting with him here.
Accelerator just bored me from what I can remember which is why I brought it up. I was just thinking the entire time, "Why is this spin off a thing when it does nothing that Index and Railgun aren't already doing better?" <:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
That was aggressively mid to me
<:CatPolite:606455522757181441>
Oh so it's Accelerator
Almost makes me want to watch it to find out what people dislike about it
Danmachi slander in this channel <:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
Rookie do you mean it's the least subtle out of the subtle yuri anime or that it's actually blatant or direct 

The former isn't gonna do anything for me <:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
<:HyperMakinoThink:382270355261227009>
Zettai Ryouiki is king
Tights vs the superior thigh high
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
~~Sakuga nuts like me love this show to pieces~~
<:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
then suddenly making it the focus for XV
It was the show's fault for putting it off for 2 seasons
Miku's problems had to be addressed at some point
Is it more than you like it when *romance* is a background element in a show rather than specifically yuri?
<a:PU_ppArrivePointLOL:750749796699996211>
Haven't paid attention to much else besides the uh...sitcom they did
I am enjoying the little shorts their putting out
I would say buy it but since you're asking for streaming sites I'm assuming you don't have money
And Tony just torrent <:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
Well the other half was burnout
<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
That's half of what killed TFS too
Yeah that makes sense
Ah
I was having so much fun with that one
I found that out like a couple of weeks ago and I was shook
Goddamn abridged series
I'm not sure if I'll be able to appreciate the Bungou Stray Dogs official dub after watching Bungou Reservoir Dogs <:LUL:503065035048747008>
And then I said "What if that's their genuine opinion?" in response
I feel like we've had this exact same conversation b4 actually
<:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
Digibro and *especially* Mother's Basement came and beat the cash out of the dead horse and everybody parroted their points
SAO is like most other anime but it got singled out cause it was the most popular at the time
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
It's just mediocre. That's really it
<:Yrrowhehelollmao:577519699437551617>
SAO is in that fun place where even the act of calling out people who beat the dead horse is beating a dead horse
<:15min:406862587657977866>
More like people are kinda just calling everything mid now
Well shit on is a bit excessive
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
MHA has been getting shit quite often as of late the time from what I've seen
Can't keep a species going if you ain't gonna reproduce
That would have to be the implication. They're eventually gonna fuck <:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
Saiyans can also have children with those weird...alien looking things if we're still counting Tarble as canon
Schrodinger's furry
<:YrrowEyes:577519696820043776>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Ya'll are acting like he just sat on his ass and did nothing despite realizing that
The second he realized that his son was not a fighter like a thought, he immediately tried to jump back in and fight Cell
Never mind that
He didn't account for his son suddenly not wanting to fight Cell
Because he knew Gohan could whoop his ass with no trouble
lmao
So did Goku
<:big_brain2:695107615797149696>
Stealing a kid and forcing him to survive on his own for a year is good parenting
Yeah sure
Along with "Goku bad dad"
<:15min:406862587657977866>
"Power levels are bullshit" is another one of those memes that got perpetuated by TFS
Boule you'd be surprised how easy it is to powerscale b4 Super came and made the entire fucking thing make no sense
Cypher how much is that is headcanon b4 we actually go any further with this topic
<:15min:406862587657977866>
The movie is showing otherwise
Since he has no limiter
That would mean he should've beat Gogeta with ease
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
The movie isn't canon anymore though
They casually mentioned him there
He was in the BoG movie
Back to coding
Eh my head fried
No b4 that
<a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
After I read Adashima
I'm half asleep trying to push a point that I can't even remember
<:15min:406862587657977866>
This is a male and female we're talking about though
It's understandable that Hibiki and Miku wouldn't be able to have kids though
<:15min:406862587657977866>
But that saga should not have gone on as long as it did
I believe that it was fine to continue the story
It's just the climax to Vegeta's arc
Like I don't even care about much else in that arc
<:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
It has the best Vegeta moment period
That's too bad
Honestly the best part of the buu saga
I enjoyed his character arc and how it climaxed in Buu
Didn't he do that after an entire arc of purposely neglecting his future and present son <:15min:406862587657977866>
Just as blatantly insincere as calling Goku a bad dad
<:BigBrain:639457697556594698>
"Vegeta and Piccolo are better dads"
And that's the second part
Last thing I'll say on the subject:

I firmly believe that most of the people who spout that rhetoric unironically just haven't watched or read the actual series in a while and are filling in the gaps in their knowledge with headcanon and BS perpetuated by the fandom and (unfortunately) TFS who made Goku a piece of shit dad for laughs. Also doesn't help that Super flanderized his character too <:kekpoint:701649187351298048> 

People outright ignore the years of time b4 Raditz came that Goku spent with Gohan and his family, or how he died to save Gohan when Raditz came, or how whenever Goku comes to save the day the first person he thinks about and prioritizes is always his son <a:kanadedontfeelgood:706544690635472939>
I'll just download more ram
Dw Cypher
I remember liking UBW
Can't remember any of it anymore
I played F/SN
<:GuraThink:763994528863486013>
I always thought Monogatari was easier to understand though
<:wack:386334796839911424>
Though it's been like 6 years so I don't even remember what I loved about it anymore
I considered it one of my favorite episodes of all time back when I first watched it <:15min:406862587657977866>
Despite not understanding what was going on I still loved that 4th episode
~~I have now been knowned~~
Hardest disagree <:15min:406862587657977866>
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
I wonder if this is the type of opening Lank would like
https://youtu.be/Eq6EYcpWB_c
<:big_brain2:695107615797149696>
<:GuraEyes:757621391250948178>
We gotta beat this dead horse
It's SAO
There are plenty of shows like it but like
> I still do not understand why SAO consider to be the worst anime.
<@740195087895756820> It was the most popular mid anime to come out back in 2012 so it got singled out by the community and anitubers. <:HAhaa:586779645936926760>
<a:PU_ppArrivePointLOL:750749796699996211>
Isn't Gundam in the mecha genre?
<:wack:386334796839911424>
You mean you *don't* kiss your homies to sleep?
<:MikuPride:388020185069649923>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
It stops being bait if there's actual yuri
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
I can see that actually
<:wack:386334796839911424>
She voiced Tiki
Wait lmao
I was surprised to hear the latter's voice again in that animal school show after Asobi Asobase
There are only 2 VAs I can immediately recognize and that's Kana Hanezawa and Hina Kino <:LUL:503065035048747008>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
*T H I G H S*
<:15min:495770478678638593>
Or if you're talking about people being hyped over a show, it's the same thing
I mean if people saw something that they think is a 10/10 and they heard that an adaptation is coming i don't see a reason for them not to be hyped
<:PauseChamp:662691991934468136>
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Then super happened and suddenly more people starting actually give GT the time of day
Lol
Oh discord didn't update
So many Bandit Cs roaming around
Seriously Goten was probably one of the funnier parts of GT <:HAhaa:586779645936926760>
Except raise Goten to not be a playboy apparently
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
<a:bapbapbap:638108545627455528>
We were fucking robbed
Pan should've went SSJ in GT
You implied that Goku never bonded with Pan, that's what I was talking about <:HAhaa:586779645936926760>
No I watched GT
<:HAhaa:586779645936926760>
> ||Goku and Pan might be mistaken for siblings and you have a chance to have Goku actually bond with his grandaughter for more depth. Plus you'd get a female ssj 10 years earlier!||
<@676272618839605249> so what happened in Z and GT anyway?
Need to rewatch it again to be sure
That's probably top 3
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
Completely forgot about it
Really fun show
The reverse isekai that made fun of isekai tropes b4 the idea of making fun of the isekai tropes became a cliche
I forgot that one even existed
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
At least in the LN adaptation landscape where most isekais seem to come from recently
The genre became more miss than hit in the last decade <:15min:406862587657977866>
It's something I had to think about for a bit
Probably Mondaiji-tachi or No Game No Life
Eh favorite isekai
Thanks YuriMother for keeping me updated on yuri news

Just found a yuri manga called `Yuri Is My Job`
<a:atopkek:541000170347823104>

I just saw the second MHA movie at random today
a couple of months
like
Give me
Miso plz
<a:PU_HYPEPOGGERS:531807278232240129>
Well I have something to read in a week
Though I wouldn't know if the show thought that hard
I'm pretty sure the more expensive cameras still take better pictures than the cameras on phones
To play devil's advocate
<@!160142617940590594> `Looking up to Magical Girls` is probably the type of yuri you're looking for if you haven't already read it
That's like 6-8 hrs
<:NotLikeMiku:631519444501266432>
Fuck I jammed to Utada Hikaru's entire discography while reading this
<a:worryEyesBongo:545361378152546325>
She's always on the look out for action yuri
She probably did
Oh wait did the yuri master read this?
We're probably due for another chapter in a week or two looking at the upload history
<a:PU_PepeCryJam:531807278689550357>

This chapter felt like it took forever to read yesterday and I just read it in 5 minutes this time
<:PU_PepeHands:585216463187738624>
I went back to read that chapter where Baiser ||mind breaks|| that one magical girl while I'm wide awake now and something just feels off this time
Something about reading while dead tired is so fucking magical to me
Goddamnit

lmao
<:NotLikeMiku:631519444501266432>
Need to reimmerse myself in the story and 25 chapters isn't enough for me to do that
I might have to avoid reading this for like another few months
<:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
lmao
The chapter was just straight up shonen action
Nice twist
<a:PU_HYPEPOGGERS:531807278232240129>
Format is outdated
Can't ever see myself sitting down and watching a long running shonen like this anymore
God bless Crunchyroll collection for putting up clips of Black Clover cause I'm enjoying the hell out of this show just through the sakuga clips I've seen. https://youtu.be/VDoMUoDDJhg
<a:PU_PepeRunSPRINT:586228314541260802>
S was so good
Railgun rekindled it slightly though
But s3 left such a sour taste in my mouth from anything anime index related
eventually
I should rewatch the Index
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
||The joke here is that white bread *with* toppings is still plain||
Lank that analogy is funny as fuck
Forgot how much I liked the first season
I'm watching the first season of MHA with my sis
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
The funny thing is the "Railgun side" is stuff that Index goes into anyway <:15min:406862587657977866>
Kazuma has a lot of fun with his world
It does
It's been 6 years since I stopped reading
~~I should also really get on reading the Index LNs so Cypher stops hounding me to catch up~~

fuck
has it already been a year since that rewatch of railgun
wait
Oh
<a:Discokek:766492696608505886>

<:worryHyperPeek:569138069601648651>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Railgun gets plot heavy too as far as what i remember of the main story
Railgun is much closer to how Index is written as far as source material goes than people give it credit for
Maybe the filler is like that
When I think CGDCT Railgun doesn't immediately jump to mind
Railgun is...
I had a more fun time with the novels than the anime
<a:aworryPeek:425764565955903519>

ye that one

Accel is mid and Index is a bad adaptation
There's no contest
Easily Dino
Some parts are more half assed than others but for the most part it's just serviceable
The anime does its job decently up to s2
<:HC_pepeWeird:736229347769319458>
I was more so addressing that CGDCT comment from Dino

The censoring of the male nipples was funny as hell. Lights everywhere <:Pog:585797452712378368>
<:PepegaHands:639309756820881419>
was doodoo
The TV series
The OVA series was a fun distraction
I forget what specifically the turn off was
I wouldn't be able to keep watching it
<:PepegaHands:639309756820881419>
I needed to drop Kissxsis cause that shit was boring me to tears halfway through
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
That's not healthy
^
I need to watch Eva eventually so I can actually be involved in these discussions <a:smugspin:729388039826047007>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
The first "Madoka clone"
<:15min:406862587657977866>
I can't remember a single thing about Daybreak
Doki Doki Precure?
What was my first mahou shoujo...
<:Dorime:729802179510009865>
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
Every Mahou shoujo is a rip off of Madoka
Don't you know?
Kat
I think Samurai Champloo is one of the shows where the middle more than makes up for how it kinda petered off in the ending
A bad ending can damper the whole experience
It's one of the clones that missed the point of why Madoka worked <:LUL:503065035048747008>
I specifically remember being bored when I got done
I watched it when I tended to like a whole bunch of shows that I watched
<:LUL:503065035048747008>
No the actual first one
When Yuri on Ice gets its s2 it's gonna sweep all the awards again <:Pog:585797452712378368>
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Another anime added to the rewatch pile
Why did you remind me of Sakurasou
Ah fuck
<a:PU_FeelsOKAYMan:594133867032739870>
<:HC_pepeWeird:736229347769319458>
<:HC_pepeWeird:736229347769319458>
~~Let's just slide Daybreak Illusion onto the eventual rewatch list~~
<:kekpoint:701649187351298048>
Just watch the anime then
<:worryWeirdSmile:641391429427658752>
Season 1 was pretty good from what I remember ye. I vaguely remember enjoying s1, moving onto s2 and stopping for whatever reason
I can't believe my little sister cucked best girl
<:HC_pepeWeird:736229347769319458>
Poor Kuroneko or whatever the cat girl cosplayer was
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Same thing I said b4. Even if you add anything it's still somewhat plain
<:PepegaHands:639309756820881419>
I still love that analogy Lank
<:big_brain2:695107615797149696>
Kthx
Just leave CG shows to Studio Orange
<a:TsubasaPeek:737222424478744647>
<:wack:386334796839911424>
Didn't even have to delete that one
Cocoa plz
<:PU_PepeHands:585216463187738624>
Another book on the to-do list
Should get back to it
I stopped reading it due to life issues but it was def a fun read
I have the first volume and I distinctly remember the opening of the book
<:PepegaHands:639309756820881419>
I'll read it tomorrow
Ah fuck it
<a:feelsColorcry:757314091684462693>
<a:ChrisRee:671980374418522132>
too much yuri to read
Fenny plz
I need to read
Fuck
<:kekhands:795481916773236777>
I also have the first volume of that on my harddrive
IT does have a manga now though
It's an adaptation of the LN
<:PU_PepeHands:585216463187738624>
Fan translations always being better
Ah the usual curse
<:kekhands:795481916773236777>
I bought it a while back and haven't given myself a chance to read it
I already have the first volume actually
<:feelsthinkerman:590048222609801216>
I really should give the novels another go now that I'm older
It was probably 2
<:kekhands:795481916773236777>
week or so I spent reading it
I'll definitely agree on NT being a fever dream but I was really fond of that like
I can't remember the prose being too hard to read, but then again LNs in general are really sloppy so it's not that hard to be better
But it has been like 7 years at this point since I read the novels
Can't say I disagree with some of what Potato is saying
hmm
I went back to read everything
<:worry:384946988770131970>
The hell did I walk into

Alright I'll prob head to bed b4 the non existant shitstorm comes
<:MikuSmug:655125664986300457>
we good
Hey as long as cypher doesn't see it
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
I mean as long as it's not Index then we wouldn't go on another tangent
<a:PU_HYPEPOGGERS:531807278232240129>
Probably cause most fans prob haven't watched the show in forever so they ended up filling in the blanks with tfs on accident
But then the Fandom subconsciously started treating that parody as "canon"
That was a funny joke because of the contrast to how he actually acts in the show
And I can't even blame tfs either
<:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
Tfs rotted people's brains
It's so funny how quick people are to forget that piccolo treated his "son" like fucking garbage initially and that Goku is a bad dad for trying to protect and love his family whenever he isn't dead or busy defending the planet lmao
<a:atopkek:541000170347823104>
There's a reason this caption exists at all
EN gets me hype, JP actually does to me what EN does for you
<:15min:406862587657977866>
Nah them shits were corny. I'd happily watch them over again for the 1000th time but still
<:genjuro_exquisito:618975628292784148>
Also Broly's VA
https://youtu.be/WI2wCr2MSIo <@!676272618839605249> <@!152896851660505088>  It's so weird watching DBZ movies w/o the corny ass insert songs Funimation added in with the dubs
<:heh:806437319807860786>
They didn't hold onto the original audio so the initial broadcast audio is the next best thing
Crisper than the bullshit audio Toei's been handing to us
<:PepegaHands:639309756820881419>
That crisp broadcast audio is worth the hassle though
I need an external hard drive just to store the show
Bro that shit is insane and I hate it
Who's gonna tell him that these were literally just specials used to advertise the show <:heh:806437319807860786>
I fucking love everything about the Boondocks
<:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
It's been on my radar since 2013 but I just haven't bothered to watch it
Nah
<:TopClown:755508483230531585>
It's fun seeing DB references in other shows

Come on, only coolkyoushinja would take a kid design a slap comically oversized tits on it
I'm personally on the side of the design being so ridiculously stupid that it loops around to being good
Also tbf to Carol, the people watching dragon maid are about to get harassed to hell and back by anitwitter for liking Dragon Maid purely on the basis of the new girl's design <:LUL:503065035048747008>
<:15min:406862587657977866>

the funny thing was i could go to sukebei just fine but not nyaa
<@!87512939107450880> Is nyaa down or is my internet doodoo?
Up to the end to Goku Black
I actually did
Cause I like their final forms just for the raw meme
The set of girls that turn into old men as their final transformation?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I didnt actually watch dbs
Who?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Android Saga with the afro
eh
<:KanadeSmug:688191203178840064>
Forgot about Launch
Oh there's the missing link
Trying to figure out where I would place them in the t3
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
Bulma and Mai (adult) are in the t3 for me
<:PogChomp:734772184685346876>

<:kek:707853659622342657>
Tien got the toriyama hand job alongside Krillin so they should magically be stronger than buutenks was in Z
Cocoa is giving DBS' writing way too much credit <:PepeHands:828680302456864838>
<:poliworry:856379651152150588>
If Krillin was even remotely keeping up, I'm calling that a wank
Tfw suppressed Beerus was still whooping Goku's ass. Almost like the difference between God level and normal is stupidly vast.
<:WhoTaoWheeze:817344687646965771>
Pls stop denying that toriyama wanked these characters so they'd be relevant for top
On goku's base
And this bald fucker over here is magically keeping up
Goku absorbed his God level powers during his fight against beerus which means he's on that heightened level of power by default
For the record, I wasn't even talking about Goku going blue
Tien and Krillin shouldn't be keeping up with God level characters but since they can they have to at least be stronger than buutenks on principle
Who needs reasonable powerscaling
<:worryEyes:438351453669556234>
Seeing kid Goku with his tanned look in GT is so weird
<:poggers:716869666047262794>
Oh I'll agree that's pretty nasty in hindsight <:worryEyes:438351453669556234>
As long as what you like isn't hurting other people or taking advantage of others then feel free to like what you like.

No real reason to feel like shit over this show <:15min:787810184675852289>
AND HE SAID HIS-
Yeah I heard he was suffering from some health issues for a while now
Ah fuck

Nice introduction bro
I was just thinking that but I wasn't sure
Wait what lmao
Any excuse to post more yuri
<:natsustare:914838084514902096>
Was referring to this

<a:worryEyesBongo:545361378152546325>
The orchestrated version of the Houseki no Kuni opening popped up in my shuffle and, like everytime it comes up, it blows me off my feet <a:15min:490152406475210762>
ah
<@!457268466429329429> I remember you mentioning being a fan of sonic runners and while I'm not sure how much of a sonic fan you are I thought I'd post this anyway <:LUL:503065035048747008> 

Some people found some of the original recordings for the Sonic OVA soundtrack a while back <a:YrrowEyesBongo:579319112241512460>
