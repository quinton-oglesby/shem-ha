Aye matey, for now it's the pauper's life for me
I saw the Shokugeki no Shirabe meme on reddit lol, A+++. I am looking forward to Shirabe-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan.

I want season six though. And seven and eight and all of the game events animated and voiced, and ......

I think I've seen bits and pieces of the concerts. Is there a collection somewhere?
Oh, introduction.

I've watched all five seasons, some of them multiple times ~~(the ones with Maria)~~. I played the game on global before it closed. :<  I hope we get more content somehow some day.
Lol
It's from Sephiria actually, if anyone remembers that show. I use "Sephirael" as the long form tho
Whoa that's a nice one
I'm excited for the next event
I was skimming and I read this as "mofuagaru" which I guess isn't wrong
Saria content yes please 🙏
Oh my god Skies of Arcadia
Thank you for the food
Hayasaka best girl
Lol perfect
I had never heard of Wonder Egg. It's definitely going on the watch list
Good luck 🍀
