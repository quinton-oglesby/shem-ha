But delays kill my dreams
Still waiting on one
Very much so
They pop up on mandarake here and there
I'm about to go hunt down all the plushes
It'll pop up on Manda for 20ish max
A Hibiki prize figure prototype was shown recently
It's really messing up my detolf display
So the older ones get moved around places, but the symphogear stuff always stays
I rotate what's in the detolfd when I get new figures
Since I had them across 2 in a row now they're split up across rows
At least it looks intact
That box damage though
I have that figure too, it's amazing. I need more virtual on redesigns in my life
I have 2 with an executive desk full of figures <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Oh that setup for the noise is smart. Stealing that rn

Clearly bayonet is the best pairing
I think it's a photo filter

Probably either kaixa or Delta
Not sure what edge bikki is but it's probably the same
Regular hibiki looks like Faiz DX belt

<@255412045933969408> were you at momocon too?
Gay women seem to make better symphogear users so as a test site of course they would push them to be gay <:Cag:423197445644615711>
Why does MaMaria not have Chris?
Trout makes sense, I thought it was Chris bass

I'm lost on this pun
And what happens after the actual tying
It's the intent
Nah me and my fiance do it
Actually works irl too
Confirmed

Hmm, if and when I do interact with Japanese accounts I actually use Japanese so eh
Linkleft
Not kamiya, I'm still following him
I don't think I've ever interacted with this person yet I'm blocked. It's strange

They definitely made it straight black after S1

She's bland but not necessarily bad. Sometimes you want vanilla
Canadian dollars are polymer too and they're great
I go to Japan and Canada a lot and their money is so much nicer
I just want colored notes


Anything can be canon if you throw in a line saying portals happened and we don't remember anything after

Skater maids are pure
Oh yeah that's fair
It's not hard gore or anything
Really?
Really? All I can see is a bland fusion between mitsuru and makoto
It's meh to good depending on your taste for yuri
That's a vanguard
Kinda reminds me of Kaixa
