328601422
I started another one
let me clear a few
but thanks anyone who helped
never lucky
sure 328601422
I need 2 giga melody for lv 70 Chris, any help is appreciated
I don't know what you all are talking about
I'm just seeing someone clearing my raids
must be some super whale with a full lv 70 XD hibiki team
hey 9point8, teemo is half done with your raid
idc what anyone say, teemo is a philanthropist
only one more
yessss
amazing
based teemo killing my red raid also
what kind of multiplier does that skill have
the hell is that
so your followers can see your raids
what's the difference if you have mutual friend?
still no sign of that last giga melody though
I love you too teemo
well now
so far, mine, 9point8, grounter, and angela's got cleared
and what about the person
sometimes they just die instantly
teemo has killed my red so far
put up your own red
not for us non-lucksacks
well so far, red, green carol, and body are the ones that get cleared?
I'm US
see if teemo will take that too
actually let me put up a blue raid
why do this to me
I hate you game
thanks teemo
and that's 3 out of 3
yeah I know, I said it's from you
*btw there's this one from cow  with 1 hour left that needs legit help*
if teemo clear my last blue, I'll start a heart raid
so you're saying teemo is here in this chat
damn I want nerfme too
I'm out of carol to host
no, that's still the same lv 19 maria
oh it's Mr. Teemo now
would explain why he's been clearing my blue and red
or maybe he's been there for a while
teemo is now in my follower list
probably deeznut
we're all making the deal with the devils
I like this
yeah
<:MakiOmegaLUL:619820503921590292>
he's letting you share his gift
what a saint
oh damn, teemo is letting you join
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
did you follow back?
how is he lv 1 if he keeps raiding
how
amazing
but not the ones you follow?
wait which one is the one with 5 giga melody?
it seems our friend teemo has stopped
yes teemo take a break, you deserve it
now it's Teemo Jr
they are in here
teemo changed their name to not angela
whoever you are teemo, thank you
pretending to now know any better
teemo may just be one of us chatting right here
actually
so I would need that for AoT Chris also?
what is the body raid mat for btw
I haven't started any body, so I can put up a few
it's so beautiful
thank you Teemo, from the bottom of my heart
FINALLY
<:BikkiSmug:585655272459075596>
haz you're just jealous because teemo hasn't cleared yours
this is honestly fun
what a great night
must be because haz just cleared out some follower spots
NerfMe just cleaerd hazzy's
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I hope this entire channel doesn't get banned tomorrow
that's some dedication
alright, body raid up
let me just put up the raid first, then I'll see if I can clear something
my list is probably full
I don't remember this from the show
why is there a dragon in symphogear
give me a sec, I'm putting one up
I see
like Fine
what about the other ones
green carol is for XD?
so body raid is the best one for all the cosplay units
all teemo are best teemo
so no, teemo isn't a bot
teemo kinda responded to us earlier by saying they're not angela
last time teemo cleared before anyone else got in
grab it while you can
ok, my last body raid of the day is up
this is the only game you need to get dupes in
my body raid is up
I think that hibiki can nuke my entire pvp team by herself
teemo may be done for the day
there are a couple body raids up already that hasn't been cleared
take your rest
it's fine teemo, you have done plenty
I think I'm out of stuff to put up
thanks for the gift teemo
oh you need red
congrats
I wonder if our friend teemo will visit again
oh yeah teemo is back
basically it was con flip and they lost
that was really unfortunate
someone here spent $750 yesterday without pulling MLB XD hibiki
I think teemo stopped
I got the LU mat for lv 70 chris, but I don't think she'll help much more than lv 60 with raids
lv 70 bikkie is that strong huh
g9 teemo
how
oof
we don't deserve teemo
reminder that teemo is doing this for us
teemo often clears raids with no one else but the host
and that is certainly not their main account
so they don't even gain anything
Someone still clearing raids?
Well I don't have much to use cp on, so I'll start a few regardless
y'all doing legit green?
if I get banned then I get to quit gacha
win-win
praise Teemo
just what I needed too
he's here
<:thonk:514195237229559808>
I got quite a few giga fantasy but for the life of me can't gain any more mega fantasy
my code is 328601422
ok I cleared a few spots
guess I can still remove a few
honestly I don't know if I can
I have both carol up
sycgear
<:BikkiSmug:585655272459075596>
we'll take everything you have
<:BikkiSmug:585655272459075596>
teemo, maybe you can train a disciple to help you out
there's AoT Chris but she sucks
what raid should be prioritized btw?
right now I don't really have anything to LU, just saving up
nice
oh wow, sanic is here too
I said that what do when that runs out
oh it's rice
rice?
what will we do when CP refill run out
punch add me too
done
what's punch's code?
no teemo though
9point8 can solo hard red now?
no teemo tonight it seems
k
sycgear
second round of carols up
I can't tell because I can't kill any of them
which ones are hard anyway
well there may be more XD banners soon
second one up soon
thanks for the first carol
I'm going to go to bed soon so I'll appreciate it if you kill mine quick
is old sanic named sanic
I'll also put up a red carol
I also cleared a few spots
green carol #1 up
oof
sanic is here so I'll put up a couple green carols
watch the show so you can see them not explain why
I don't think I can save up for any of them
actually the XD hibiki banner is not even gone yet
one XD every 3 days
they are really speeding through this huh
I have one round of carols and body up
didn't stop them
well it wasn't hibiki's birthday last week
I expected XD tsubasa
huh
no ship you did tag my blue
no one is tagging my blue raid
I still have some 100 CP refills
nvm
oh there's more scrolling to the right
I may as well give up on them
I just realized yesterday that giga miracle and giga magic requires either hunt or highest damage
btw I put up a second blue
ok I cleared a few
oh you need follow spots?
given how stingy this game is with follower spot, I half expected them to sell extra in a package
ok, I cleared a few more spots
I'm doing the tactic book quest, so it may take some time
last green carol up btw
yeah I can put up one in a bit
I put up a new green carol too
sanic you have me right?
this is my best snipe yet
15 giga miracle/magic for a single LU
still, one LU costs a lot of giga
I don't even have one XD card
I don't mind
my current stock
that screenshot has more than twice the amount I have
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
now that's hacking
<@!357594748023734273>
last int raid I have is up
I can do practically nothing to any hard raid
or is nobody doing them
should I put up raids right now
teemo/sanic ded?
what's the raid situation now
I haven't touched raids in 2 days
done
I threw in a few carol
are we still doing carol
I'll put up stuff
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
this is getting more organized huh
oh shit
how long are you doing this for?
carols or heart/tech/dex
body next?
maybe not spoil XV here
hack
guess I can LU that welfare kanade

98
now all I need is 1 more giga miracle
and XD units to actually LU
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I got 12
I got to socialize before being plunged back to gacha madness
I now almost have mats to LU anything
if only I have 5* to LU
best hauls of the day


thanks for organizing this
<:PraiseTikki:398808517139628042>
don't see it
did it get sweeped by hacker?
heaven's wrath really does boost damage quite a bit for green advent
thanks
<@!197516016488677376> can you clear a spot?
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
time has changed certainly
<:BikkiSmug:585655272459075596>
even Mel has given in to these raids
alright thanks
don't mind me I'm just going to snatch 1 carol with 2 dragons and leave afterwards
dw I know how this works
ah rip me
are you all up to red carol yet
I'm joining
I could restock my giga melodies
what's left after tech?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
thanks onii-chan
I'm done after this one so make it 7
either is fine
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
getting a lot of giga melodies
ok I'm in
wait up
last blue
yeet
thanks again
well I'm done too
ah shit I didn't pause
I'm sorry
oh ok
weird, I don't see
6 should be good to go?
pause, react so we know how many has come in
here
that team can solo green carol?
ah
wait wdym poverty sanic
ok
all rainbow crystals
not really
thanks for legal kill
thanks
wait up
I need to restock for whatever XD unit I will get next
same
<:MakiOmegaLUL:619820503921590292>
there are 6 types and 7 XD, and yet no dex
there's no dex XD unit?
So you don't even have to win?
is sanic raid not a thing anymore
worst case, I'll wait for sanic
yeah, I'll put up a red carol also
help will be appreciated
all my decent units are red so not much I can do
I also put up a raid
no giga int unfortunately
thanks
ok dead
damn burns
I'm surprised the adds aren't dead
I'm in
I'll take
I'm 1 giga int short from LU
anyone here can do int raid?
I'm 1 giga int away from LU
sure
yeah I put one up
still no giga though, rip
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
thanks Cais
carol up
I got what I needed so I'm stopping
thanks for the raid <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
can you do int after this?
then when react counts reach the number of people participating, unpause and kill
pause, react
üê≥ teams are scary
thanks for the kill
why Maria first?
what's your team
<a:TsubasaBroken:663625017191432192>
Cais is that 5 or 10CP
which raid is that
I have a red
<@!96113323279421440> done
I cleared like 20 just a few days ago
though strange that I'm full already
thanks
<@!96113323279421440> got a spot you can clear?
because red carol constantly inflicts burn
I mean burnbasa
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
is doing good damage against red carol even possible without lv 70 burnbasa
<:Bakaguya:669209909153497118>
wait how did I deal twice what I usually deal
oh right, time
don't see that one
dead already?
thanks
kill or wait?
I'm in
sure, let me know when it's open
I can't do much with the adds, help pls
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
thanks
good haul
cheers
I'm in
me
it's just LU XD jii + ignite basa

<:HibiMikuPeek:661660014288568361>
ping me when you open
oof
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

quite an organized stash
actually Kerrik, do you have hibimiku in a stash you can just dump into a mega/google drive link or something similar?
thanks!

ojiiiisan
oh yeah, grand dad
we know Shirabe's dad is alive but no clue about her mom
Tsubasa's mom's status is unknown
Hibiki's mom is the actual loving parent who sticked around, but they make time for topdad instead
the only one who got focused on is Maria's "mom"
what's with symphogear and ignoring mom characters?
basically irl Hibiki
>>> Aoi: I would say more of "we've finally made it this far"... (laugh). I'm going to allow myself to be frank and say, back when season 2 was announced I fell into despair thinking "it's not over yet" (bitter laugh). Of course, I was happy that the series itself would continue, but personally speaking all I could feel was "I'm going to have to do these difficult recording sessions again." That's how hard I was pushing myself back then. Then when season 2 ended, "Season 3 is greenlit!" and after that ended "Season 4 and 5 have been greenlit!" Each time it happened I thought "Okay, I can't let myself stop just yet" and kept myself running headlong into it. And now, season 5 is the climax within a climax. It will reveal the truths of the story that bring everything to a close as a fully compiled series. So right now my feelings are: "somehow, I've finally made it this far."
https://symphogear.blogspot.com/2019/07/animate-times-interview-with-aoi-yuki.html
voicing for symphogear probably upgraded her a fair bit too
Yuuki Aoi is good
guess I'm muting this channel till saturday
does this channel post unspoilered previews?
millaarc also looked like she quite enjoyed digging through a child's heart with her bare hands
live announcement where?
imagine if they put bad end in XV and put a true good end in movie <:Ver:336656981144109066>
did they ever do animation polishing for BD in previous seasons?
probably not enough of a delay still
it got delayed a season, no?
or time
they probably ran out of budget trying to make 3 finale-quality episodes in one season
4, 8, and 13
then pull Miku out and then punch god
NR will get their 3 minute glory of self sacrifice
just have to reveal what's the deal with Enki and Maria's gauntlet is
not that many
new CDs aren't going to market themselves
divine power-fueled god slayer
and we know Bikki will get some grand powerup anyway
like previous seasons
well flame wasn't really sword
it's a conceptual weapon
it will kill a thing it's meant to kill, no matter how powerful
I just want Miku and Hibiki to beat up god with a duet
you know, if they just instead go out there and look long enough, I'm sure they can find people who are into cyborgs and half-monsters
Fudou being endgame makes no sense
the series started with the Balal curse deal
and Fudou has nothing to do with that
I didn't want to know that existed
I'm sure Carol won't mind a few chips
or just borrow dur da bla
shenshoujing for everyone
I mean shenshoujing is still around
they recovered most of it, and I assume both the symphogear and the faust robe was made from just a small piece of it
considering that amalgam so far is just one really strong weapons instead of multiple ones (with the exception of Hibiki being a pair of fists)
Chris' amalgam must be BFG 9000
even gayer cast
with new cast
just make a sequel show
beef stronganoff is a lullaby
also, shenshoujing's relic erasing effect was due to Miku's desire
since Shem-Ha is in complete control, I don't think it's going to work that way
god is pretty weak right now
can't even beat Maria
she can't use anything that may actually take down Shem-Ha, and Miku by extension
yeah, but she doesn't go full finisher
I mean
Hibiki is not going to hit Miku seriously
doesn't have to to sound like hype music
sad fighting maybe
your go-to place for all your weeb torrent needs
nyaa.si
want to hear it with context
I'll refrain from listening to that for now
so the song is out?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
of course it is...
pls not appul again
it's a stupid statement since songs have saved the world at least 4 times
it's not just one time
there's another example, but I don't have a screencap of that
that

oh right
with villains
and Adam
what weird sex thing were there aside from Fine and rocket boobs?
cute
Miku and Hibiki aren't affected by the curse, and they aren't any different
pretty much
he'll go nuts on his own, seeing how the people on whom he looked down succeed on his own goal
having a prideful, ambitious man rot away in prison is as appropriate a punishment as any
*now* you're making it a bit weird
I want my gay girls to be happy
no, it would be if you said you enjoyed seeing them suffer
I'm getting a bit too attached to this despite having started watching only 3 weeks ago <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
gohan and gohan?
also, Hibiki blushes because it's a measuring tape
she doesn't want people to know her waist size
girl problems
can't have parent problems if you don't have parents
Chris seems to have gotten shafted and Maria got pushed to main character status to replace her
being happy is pretty abnormal tbh, given the current state of life
a straight ship would be very abnormal here
the show knows no one would take NR's "tragedy" seriously
this show is proof that the illuminati is behind the moon landing
wake up sheeple
friendly prank
I hope they kiss as a prank
can I get source for that hibimiku
deep down, we all want to be a cute anime gay girl
possibly
this relationship is so good
that scene of them taking a selfie after making up in S1, talking about how bad they looked, and laughing together is just so good
too many people don't know the first thing about writing romantic chemistry
Miku is one of the better "MC's love interest" characters I've seen
I just want to see best gay wife smile again
all the shots of her sister in the OP will come into play again
Maria hasn't gotten her turn of being bullied yet
pls no jojo memes
our characters need to know how he's relevant, and there isn't really some earth records on that
almost certainly
the teleport potion thing are usually broken to be used anyway
side note, best shot in the episode
also they got separated from the rest despite entering the same portal because dramatic reveal
it was a very dramatic shot of Chris turning away
yeah
japan is weird
Ver was a narcissistic psychopath to the very end and we love him for it
a bit less so at least
guys just die without getting truly redeemed
I kinda wish Shem-Ha was a guy, so the show doesn't waste time on trying to talk no jutsu the final boss out of the fight
Shem-Ha will need to go back to earth to recharge with leylines and whatnot
I think they will resolve the moon plot and then go back to earth for the actual final fight
I thought they were going to the moon in AXZ due to the OP
Miku is a literal supporting character, as her role is to support Hibiki
doesn't make her any less important than the main cast though
in fact, I'd argue that symphogear can still work if you write out DMJii, but not Miku
fun size
hopefully that won't be the last symphogear concert
and that's how Hibiki can reach Miku
maybe she'll try to hijack Hibiki next
~~she can still shove them in though~~
he didn't stay behind
he just died
yes, the obligatory episode 11 exposition dump
wouldn't be symphogear without it
what plot point is there left?
next episode will explain the relevance of appul and vanessa fight
then last one for final boss and epilogue
yuri will provide the miracle they need
unless Carol learns instant transmission
I don't see earth sending anything to get them back now
load them all into her boobs and shoot them back to earth
Vanessa will turn into a rocket to haul them back
she lost points for bringing back NR
but guess this will do
I was hoping for that to be stitched with the full ED
thanks
btw, does anyone have Next Destination with the transition intro?
since it will likely be used to bring Miku back
that would be a weird moment to end an episode on
episode 8 was a low blow

oh damn, there is a Lasting song version with the intro
this song gives me dread <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
~~when will we get america redemption arc~~
doing what better?
poor Chris, she's not gay enough to get any duet
also Maria's amalgam can turn into a fly swatter
ouroboros
the coloration makes it very clearly a beak
looks more like a phoenix
yeah, was going to say
oh, missed that shot
also why is Tsubasa's amalgam sword different in this episode
convenient
they arrived 2 seconds after the fight was over
she's not even that hot <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
also Milaarc pls die
not that she actualyl died
I believed he said he *wished* Milaarc died
god damn Maria's trio suck back then
"remember when you threatened a whole stadium of innocents"
it's still pretty episodic though
last was Elsa
this week is Milaarc
Vanessa next
Lasting Song belongs to Hibiki alone
Chris singing it would be very weird
this episode's animation is a bit quality but every time Hibiki fights, it's still pretty awesome
not with all this endgame plot
I think it's fine?
I don't think this show can juggle 6 actual characters
4 real characters and 2 comic relief is enough
maybe she will, and Hibiki will enter her mind to rescue Miku
her "self" is in humanity
I think the vambrace just hold her god powers
reincarnation doesn't mean much if you don't have any power
vambrace is probably just a power focus
I make a point not to listen to songs before they show up in the show
Waikyo SSJ, that is
hasn't stopped them before
we have a love confession song back in G
I know symphogear makes a point to scoot around the HibiMiku deal
but can they actually get around it this time?
there is not really much Miku has trouble saying other than a love confession
it's not that farfetched of an idea
considering that they already rode Chris' rocket in space before
she's in the sub
11 is not as potato, but some scenes definitely felt a bit cheap
anyone know why XV had production problems?
it's definitely unfinished even with 1 season delay
and so is Genjurou
Carol is on earth though
> all of their best fighters are stuck on the moon!
rather than the season's main ED
in the same manner, I wish they had saved Lasting Song as an insert song for episode 8
I know vaguely what it's about, but I haven't seen the lyrics either
and that song almost certainly will
I kid
she ded
*was
similar to Lasting Song's lyrics?
haven't looked at keywords much
what kind of ominous keywords do they have?
"Padre Superior"
why is that SSS
wait what's Miku Hipoticamente
"Shemmy"
I mean his fist closed up *after* he cut it off
yeah the fist closed up a bit in the same scene
it closes in the same scene I think
I wonder if they are going to explain how Enki's arm ended up on earth
I don't recall seeing that
that's an edited face right
it's just the matter of how gay will the ending be
Geah is not going to have a bad end
her being consumed in darkness and disintegrated and all in the latest episode
it's just that the show tries pretty hard to say otherwise
I think SSJ's relic erasing ability only applies if Miku is the one using it
due to her desire to rid Hibiki of relic cancer
so a franxx end
symphogear has only been normal life to me for a bit more than a month
but I will miss it more than many others that I spent more time on
just tug and pull
nice dress with convenient stripping mechanic
so I guess Airgetlam is actually not that important?
their hair becomes energy towards the end
doesn't feel like it is
Bikki suffering never ends
so, this will be pretty rushed, won't it
they still need to fight Kamiku, lose because SSJ is OP
then Hibiki sings side B to get Miku back
then round 2 vs Shem-ha
wouldn't be much time left for an epilogue
all those indians IT being put to work
change concept something something to make SSJ purge Shem-ha somehow?
no sound drug, no Maria
Ver headed the project that created Maria
Shem-Ha's talk about striking her brethren makes me think they threw it in there to make a movie hook, just in case they decide to make one
come back ship, we need you for the last episode
oh wait <@357594748023734273> you're here
please no more suffering
I hope Bikki finally gets her long awaited happiness next episode
wait I thought the wings were her twin tails
just download it and go to starbucks or something
why live when she can't use buttplugs anymore
bracelet is probably just a powerful relic
so far it's just a wrist-mounted laser
link to preview?
I think they are leaving the idea of a movie open but still leave it in the air
since the rest of the Custodians haven't come into the picture yet
so probably carry again
the stake is even more personal this time to Hibiki
she's already had 2 highlights this season
doubt it
that S1 callback also explains why Hibiki is way stronger than the other symphogear users, despite no longer being half-relic after G
you may be putting a bit too much nihilism into a show about gay girls punching weird monsters
I don't know which would be more impressive
they either planned this all the way back then despite this originally meant to have only one season
or they adapted some throwaway dialogues in season 5 into actual continuity
how do people remember this stuff
I hope they have something good in store in E13 to make up for that
there's been a severe lack of gay this season due to Miku's absence
*your pal's bikini pic
very good friends
best friends

is it a good song, people who have heard it?
same
Tsubasa doesn't look impressed in that shot
would be a bit of a waste for her to be rescued and then just get put on the sideline
I hope they let Miku fights once they get her out
they already did a nod to gurren lagann in episode 8
a mirror, probably
~~more bondage gear~~
Carol was the hero we need all along
and genocide
genocide is the solution
Carol will just kill everyone 
no one to speak language, no Shem-Ha
or some weird rock growing inside of her
it's just much nicer to have Hibiki earning her OP status through putting her life on the line to rescue her wife from mind control
rather than genetics
her being demigod would undermine the entire show's theme about humans connecting with each other...
*from under water*
notable example being how she shot the giant coffin high into the sky
explains why Bikki has been extremely OP comparing to the other gear user even after G

yeah we talked about that a while back
yes, I know what you meant
what
> Listen the last time I listen with images was AXZ ep 13
also airgetlam had some plot stuff that reduced the backfire
I thought that was just from bad linker
was there ever such a thing as specific gear compatibility?
Maria always could use 2
damn apples
well, song kinda fucked the world to begin with
he'll probably just lose his mind seeing that songs indeed saved the world
I don't believe symphogear writer so incompetent as to do something that stupid
and that plot is done with
his main association was with Tsubasa
dw, Fudou won't get out
he has no connection with the current elements
it should still be the same
so if the explosion didn't blow matter away that the gravity of the moon couldn't retrieve
depends on how much matter got ejected from the moon due to the explosion
you have to shed mass to change momentum in space
which altered the orbit
Kadingir blew off a chunk, changing its mass
I hope they don't forget that the Lunar Ruins being active is what has been holding the moon in orbit, and now that Shem-Ha blew it up, it will slowly crash into Earth
just rebuild humanity then?
why does Basa need anything from Fudou to get closure?
that kinda makes her reliant on him
why do we need closure for Fudou?
not to mention waste of airtime
an approval from Fudou is really just empty
and it really doesn't do anything?
Shem-Ha is just kinda insane
other female villains have had some kind of tragic back story
I do wonder what kind of end they will give Shem-Ha
gungnir breaks, Hibiki and Shem-Ha just starts beating up each other with fist
Hibiki gathers ~~spiral energy~~ phonic gain to create a mech fist
Shem-Ha taunts about how humanity can never connect with universal language gone
to which Hibiki just replies, "DA TO SHITEMO" and finishes Shem-Ha
I can see a lagann-hen final battle happening
I guess the Lunar Ruin just corrected its own orbit back in G a bit so that the new orbit wouldn't crash the moon?
it wouldn't have energy to constantly correct the orbit of something that size
~~magic~~ alchemy
they're just weird golems
except Maria who indeed killed a couple of american guards back in G
but nobody remembers so it's fine
sure they ended up being alive, but as far as the gears knew, they were dead
most of our heroes didn't have much qualms "killing" the alchemists in AXZ so...
no full gay 1/10
SSJ looking like a wedding dress is as close as wedding as we get, I suppose
there's still hope of something, given that this exists https://twitter.com/ohkuboyoshiyuki/status/1177270228184514565?s=12
recap movie with true ending pls
gears are likely lost yeah
Fine was human
we can't really have Hibiki punches Miku in the face with max strength
I mean
it didn't provide anything on my wishlist
it's just that
E13 is great
well, this certainly is the most fun I've had with anime for a long time
~~granted I watch like 2 shows a year, but still~~
we will have symphogear live because there's more CD to sell
I don't recall anything noteworthy next season
probably not, but not like I have much else to look forward to
so 6 months for gay ending hopefully
first?
BD when?
hopefully BD will give us non-shemha SSJ trasformation
Hibiki was in max gay mode so she's stronger
HibiMiku is slightly more confirmed in S05 E13 than S01 E02
no kiss -1/10
for a high schooler, yes
"can I fist you"
it's already super gay from the first season
still, a kiss would have been nice to have, after all that build up
ignite doesn't really add anything
ignite is just a recolor though...
they lost it when they remade their gear 
amalgam is the replacement
the gay: the attack
what's a shinai
whether Chris is gay or not is ambiguous
it's almost funny that they formed a mech only to ram it into the spaceship and exploded
OVAs probably
Korra did it badly though
symphogear trended worldwide for a short while
not relevant enough to the plot
unlike topdad, he's still a psycho to the end
I don't think they would all come to visit Fudo's grave...
but what's the point really
there's a manga of season 1
with all the singing
symphogear is probably the hardest thing she has to voice for
she's finally free
not many shows go for this long
5 seasons is a good run, especially for an anime original
https://twitter.com/Xythar/status/1178136071206387712?s=19
south american civil war
gear is not a mecha anime
going back, S1 looks really bad comparing to what we have now
compare this episode to, say, the Testament finishing punch in AXZ 13
the way Metanoia finishes in particular really doesn't fit
it's a good song, but it's not a good symphogear song
I'm starting to see what Mel meant by too much white
I like the mitosis lesbian spawns
so three
Maria will just sing with Tsubasa
Kirika follow along as the emergency brain cell stash
Shirabe can do figure skating
they can just be singers in their 40s, doesn't have to be idols
Hibiki will open a martial art school or something
since they're underaged still, they would need parental consent for marriage
Metanoia was basically exorcising god with the gay
the flame hair whip was a strange choice
this one deserved a card, but it's kinda weird
but that card doesn't look good
yeah, that one is fine
not every *blue flash*
it should be saved only for big attacks
I've never liked them, they break the flow of fights
attack cards is kinda a time filler anyway, so it's fine
it's really obvious from behind
yes yes, we've noticed
episode 1-8 -> movie 2 -> movie 3 is the order someone recommended me
guess I'll pick up Madoka now that Symphogear is symphogone
speaking of which
just not in the west
symphogear is popular though
but that doesn't make it a good studio
that work pace would up people's skill fast
I don't doubt Toei is good for raising people
what's with their policy of making 7000 mediocre weekly episodes
does any show put extra main content into BD?
that would be a lot of added content though
like the top dad reunion with family at the end of GX?
what sort of added content?
so not gear
and yeah, no converter
done
XV's is a faust robe
OP adaptation has gotten a bit better, as far as I can tell
not great, but better
or I can just look at the quality of their work...
she probably could beat Adam barehanded if she tried
Miku must have one hell of an arm to have made this throw
looking back some old scenes
Aoi Yuuki secretly wants to kill this guy probably
amazing

*what's a shinai*
those concerts had higher mortality rate than russian roulette though
I'll miss those flashy concerts
thanks
anyone has Tsubasa and Maria's XV concert in a streamable?
what
`78) As the design of your mech approaches human, the probability that it's your mom approaches one.`
`61) If you start learning a lot of information about a member of your team you barely knew, get your funeral attire ready.`
that's just fiction in general
lest you become someone with shit taste
being elitist is the way to go
a lot of this is just gurren lagann
sounds about right
`12) Martial arts can beat advanced technology any day of the week.`
we know XV was Miku foreshadowing
so does anyone know if there's any meaning behind the titles G, GX, and AXZ?
that sounds terrible
didn't school just start for a month
exams already though?
ah
but 12?
I know 13 has many songs so that can be some work
some problem with 12-13?
you guys were pretty fast with 1-11
no I mean
busy with something else?
since all the subs are already done with the TV version
I thought that would be something that appears right away
doesn't seem like anyone subs BD yet
get back here
