if you didn't know this was going to happen then that is on you
youxdo kinda get when, just because of timestamps and all that
you don't get how from the thumbnail or title
Miku was genuinely the best thing to spoil from this episode because it was so obviously going to happen, unlike the Carol turn or the hibiki falling from the sky punchy thingy
that part is more unexpected than the Miku turn
`The fact that it happens gives away enough`
as if the show hasn't been putting up blinking signs saying "Miku will go bad again" since last season
or maybe they spoil it as a way to frustrate people into buying premium
that's a fair point
no
no
all advertisements are inherently spoilers, I'm saying that this spoiler is better than what they could have spoiled
I know that it's a spoiler
no you've missed the point
yeah and
nyaa.si
the actual fight is more spoilers though
they're advertising their show, if they clipped a less spoilerly moment it doesn't have the same impact.
yeah and they were going to spoil something nonetheless
I like them though
they still murdered a whole stadium even if they were told to do it
not like that changes anything
big difference
just practically
but she wouldn't have had a problem doing so morally
next episode
they won't do that though
I wish
fourth and final big bad when
they are both good by the way
I'd only compare Madoka and Symphogear in a negative way
they're definitely not dead lmao
they gambled on recruiting god, I guess, which was a very very poor gamble
not like they had a lot of options
no body no death, that's the rule
he could be anywhere
who knows
me too
yes. Fudo is a boomer.
more proof that Fudo is a nonpresence for a character ðŸ’¤
