hi ðŸ˜ƒ

Kanade still live, inside Hibiki ðŸ˜„
Dr.Ver will be back ðŸ™ƒ
Hibiki keeps sleeping in her bed, and Maria use gungnir to kill god in her stead with Apple
Fine will takes over her body
Tsubasa might try to kill her, if it saves people
hack your brain and get unlimited power
haha
I doubt everything can fit in the last 5 episodes, that would be awesome to have a part2
fudou -> dr ver
maybe shem-ha is not complete
kanade-miku-serena vs other
fudou > genjuro > tsubasa
same ðŸ˜„
so it's weird
but it seems she knew something bad would happen with her, and asked hibiki to stop her
maybe
is miku really possessed ? at this point everything is possible
elfnein said that shemha absorded miku and not the contrary
that would make no sense if he was the one creating the curse
why would he said sorry to finÃ© ?
no he was jamming the curse
I don't think so
huh, was it mentionned that enki created the curse ?
god has no backstory <:Ver:336656981144109066>
i'm pretty sure enki betrayed the other "gods"
fudou is actually izanagi <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
well, that would be too sad if miku or hibiki die, but I don't think they will be reunited at the end
i don't believe in the happy end
mmh, I feel like hibiki will really die this time and if she's not then that won't be the end
isn't this the end of the s1 ?  ðŸ˜„
only the first season iirc
she does have wings on the logo ðŸ¤”
Hibiki becomes an angel and saves everyone. the end.
Fudo is hilarious : "why did you mess up with power of gods ?"
but...it was you
haha same
ðŸ”¥ IGNITION ðŸ”¥
final boss is hibiki <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Hibiki destroys shemha in every possible timelines and create a new history (with the light god could not know ðŸ¤¡ )
