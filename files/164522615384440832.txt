A color would be nice too
We need a Ver role too
Hello everyone!
Tsubasa will have her "I'm a sword" moment, Chris will have some Angst and the B team will be the B team
I used to think that too, but then GX happened and I learned that some things never change
XV will be fun as always, unless they do another GX which I doubt, we will have our alien overlords and some cool fight scenes, the villains will either sacrifice themselves or die and the status quo will remain
Well, truth be told I'm just putting all my hopes on Dr Ver making a dumb come-back and whatever other memes happen
I like AXZ too, which only makes the finally hurts more
At least its not GX
Hehehe
The only OK part is Adam becoming a big monster
Giant hibiki is dumb, New form is dumb, nuke is dumb
The entire AXZ finally is dumb
A man after my own heart
God help if any other character gets to actually participate in a fight
My AXZ salt is that they just bullshit a new form for the gears and just have Hibiki solo the villain
Such hate for alchemists
Pulling a Kanade with the 3 villains is such a stupid idea, and yet I wuldn't be surprised if it happened
Hell now that I think about it, they are WAY to similar to season 2 FIS
I fully expect them to job to the custodians, also since they are "Failed experiments" I fully expect some angst in it all
